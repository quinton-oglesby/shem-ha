At around 7:30 PM BST (2:30 PM EDT), someone is going into Madoka completely blind on Monday. If you want to join in on the watch, keep your eye out for a rabb.it link!
```@Yuri Girl (Alice) can you announce that this Saturdays k-on watch will start at s2 and people are expected to catch themselves up?```

this Saturdays k-on watch will start at s2 and people are expected to catch themselves up
Of note: <#447132690349555712> is still not a spoiler channel. There are two specific songs you cannot post there. I shouldn't have to tell anyone what they are. This may change at a later date, but for now if you wanna post either of those songs or remixes of them, keep it to <#336310266654490624>
<#384870333620027403>, <#407060923078017026>, and <#371105434771390465> all allow Symphogear spoilers to be posted in them now. Additionally, a list of spoiler channels has been added to <#336297587802112011> since I accidentally got rid of that information when the rooms section was cut to only mention channels with special rules.
A <#447132690349555712> channel has been added! Since we have a LOT of channels under General Interests, I'll be splitting that category into two. Don't be scared if any channels disappear for bit!
Through the power of alchemy, <@456226577798135808> has been converted from an <@&336303258048004098> into a member of the <@&336301943179968514>! That means he can kick and ban people in addition to all the other things he was able to do before.
So, a lot of people seem to like being able to have different roles to rep their favorite characters. The main reasons this isn't already a thing on this server are 1) giving moderators unique colors allows them to stand out so you know you're not being told off by someone random and 2) when everyone's a different color, chat can look a bit chaotic. That being said, I'm willing to implement roles for people to represent their favorite characters if enough people want it. React to this announcement with a ✅ if you want character roles and a ❎ if you don't.
swear to god im not high im just bad at life
@everyone At Saturday 11 PM GMT (7 PM Eastern Time, 4 PM Pacific Time) we will be watching K-On in <#371105434771390465>! We'll be using rabb.it to watch and I'll make another announcement (without pinging everyone) once the room is set up!
<@456226577798135808> is now an <@&336303258048004098> because you all talk really, really fast! Sadly this covers up the cape.
`the circle has been betrayed` https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lBO23Dh23I
Reddit's April Fool's experiment this year is Circle (<https://redd.it/890upp>). I have created my own circle because hey, why not? The password is Gungnir. I have no idea what this is about or why I'm doing it but we missed out on last year's experiment and I'm not making that mistake again. https://www.reddit.com/user/Yuri-Girl/circle/embed/
<#336297587802112011> has been updated with an addendum to rule 1: 1a. No excessive ripping on a user or their works without constructive criticism.

Additionally, a new pinned message has been added to <#357682999300718592> concerning constructive criticism.
Hey @everyone! Along with the current announcement that was just made on the subreddit, we'd like to see people post their stuff here too! With XV airing in just over a year, we'd like to see (the currently growing) community here show off their stuff! If you've got fancontent of any kind - art, fanfics, crafts, etc - come and post it in <#357682999300718592> and talk about it! We also have a page collating a list of content creators at <https://www.reddit.com/r/Symphogear/wiki/content-creators> so if you'd like to be added to that list, just send me a DM and I'll get on it!

For those interested in the announcement on the sub, <https://redd.it/866w81>
:MikuYandere: had some whitespace issues in dark mode I didn't feel like fixing, so you can have <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980> instead
Symphogear Quiplash Saturday at 5 EST!
```alright then if yall be interested in symphogear quiplash at 5pm EST gimmie a hell yea! (react to this with i dunno kiri)```
<#336297587802112011> has been updated! It now looks prettier. The source for the images is <https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=38325179>. Also since this frees up an emote slot, <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313> is now on the server!
There has been an emoji revolution! 5 were removed and 8 were added.

As an aside to that, how would everyone feel about restarting weekly watchgroups for various anime? React to this message with a checkmark if you want to do it, and an x if you don't care.
Season 5 has been announced for April 2019! A rewatch of seasons 1 through 4 in the months leading up to it will be planned although precise details on that will come later.
Hey kids you want some... OVAs?

Subs for the 4th OVAs are out and since I'm not bound by Reddit's sitewide rules I can just post it here!
https://nyaa.si/view/1011639
Channels update! nsfw-discussion has been renamed to <#336297840529899522> and is now suitable for any topic that would leave people feeling uncomfortable talking about it in general, such as politics or sex. nsfw-art has been shortened to <#336297808221044736> and is now the go-to place for both lewd art *and* discussion. That means if you want someone to dump H doujins, ask for it in there from now on. sfw-art has been shortened to <#336297674707828747> to match the change to <#336297808221044736> 

Separate from those changes, Kokoro Connect has been mentioned as an anime to watch with the server. If you want to resume group anime watching and have opinions on picking up Kokoro Connect for this or resuming YuYuYu, talk about it in <#371105434771390465>.
welcome has been changed to <#368973801561653253>! Ryouko's join message has been slightly altered accordingly.
Subs for the 3rd OVA are out! Grab em at https://nyaa.si/view/1004544

And in case you missed the subs for the 2nd OVA ~~like I did~~ they're right here: https://nyaa.si/view/993023
More additional stuff I should have already mentioned: if you put up a lobby, mention it in <#337805317276565525> please
Oh, also you get 1 win for knocking out a mook, 2 wins for knocking out a player, and 3 for a boss.
@here 

Alright, it's just about 6 PM EST so it's time to get started! Since lobbies are limited to 4 people, can everyone who wants to play OJ hop into the general voice chat so I can get a head count? No talking needed. Additionally, if you don't have the game, and you really can't spare the $1.75 to get it, I'll buy it for you, so don't worry if you wanna play but don't have it.

For people new to the game, you level up by completing your norma and then landing on any home space. You win by completing your norma at level 5. Stars are obtained by landing on bonus panels or beating people up. Wins are obtained solely by beating people up. When someone is bullying you, a defend roll will subtract from the attack roll and deal that much damage to you, but it will always deal at least 1 damage. An evade roll will completely negate all damage, but only if you roll *higher* than the attack roll. The rest of the game is pretty self-explanatory, and anything I've just said that doesn't make sense will make more sense once in game.

When making a lobby, please use the lobby name "Symphogear" and the password "gungnir" (without quotes, for both) and for new people, to join a lobby, hit free play, hit join lobby, and then find one of our lobbies to join.
By the way, we'll probably get started around 6 or 7 EST because of how long OJ can go on for.
Also <@98541382393688064>. Forgot you in the pingblob.
I sent out a bunch of steam friend requests just now to get OJ all set up. Specifically <@175048449836843008> <@!219132279639769098> <@108011348616609792> <@102193332523909120> <@179046613476442113> <@383228351168512001> <@!81815015224516608> and one person who Discord won't tell me the name of haven't sent me Steam info yet, so if you all wanna get in on this, DM me with info on how to actually include you.

Or you can just join lobbies once we get going, they'll just be harder to find since friend lobbies filter to the top.
@here Alright, 13 people is a good enough starting number since that's 3 full lobbies plus an extra person to begin with.

I... actually expected less. And with slower responses. If you want in on the OJ playing, send me a DM with your steam name, URL, and whether you actually have the game or not. We can play this Saturday unless anyone has any issues with that.
@everyone
React with an orange if you DON'T have OJ, but still want to play, regardless of whether you can spend the $2 on it or not.
React with an orange if you have OJ and would like to play with the server.
There was some discussion about 100% OJ (<http://store.steampowered.com/app/282800/100_Orange_Juice/>) earlier today so, to get a headcount, how many people would want to play OJ together with other people from the server?
More subs! More OVAs!

Clarification on that last announcement - roles that would be sought after include (but are not limited to): Encoding, Translation, Timing, Typesetting, Transcription, Seeding torrents, Raw Supplying (from Japanese TV broadcasts)
Now that the AXZ OVAs are starting to be released, we could use some help with translations! Any assistance is welcome, whether it be editing, typesetting, or translating itself. https://discord.gg/qhmuHgB
Read the pinned posts on that channel before posting anything, by the way. It has special rules.
We've added a new channel with <#384870333620027403>! Because I was spamming emojis at R in DMs and why not do it publically on the server.
@here 10 minutes to YuYuYu over in https://lets.rabb.it/886j/v4kukuuPCH ! I won't be able to stick around too much for this one, but I'll start the stream and then... let it run until I stop it I guess.
Some results on the polls for times!

1) Next watch group is tomorrow, Saturday
2) We'll be starting at 9:00 PM EST this time. Up for debate, only 11 people voted, and only 3 of the votes were for 9:00 PM.
3) We'll be watching 4 episodes.

The "which anime do you wanna watch next" poll remains open. We probably won't do more polls for times, since in the end not very many people are answering them and at a certain point it'll mostly be up to "when will someone be available to start the stream" since I don't have much longer of being stuck at home all day.
Hey `ya'll`, it's Wednesday, and that means it's time for ***anime watch group polls***.

Actually I would have posted these earlier, except then I wouldn't be able to tell you that today is my birthday. Today's my birthday. What'd you get me?

The poll for start times and session length can be found at <https://goo.gl/forms/2aiJ22odxBG7Yjuj2> and the poll for which anime to watch once we're done with YuYuYu can be found at <https://www.polltab.com/B1kLfXCaW>

Also everything can just be found in the usual place, on the subreddit, at https://redd.it/78o6j2
We'll be adding features to her as we go along, but for now that's all she does
We now have a bot! Who does exactly one thing! Ryouko will greet new users in the <#368973801561653253> channel when they arrive so that when people join the server it doesn't feel so boring and empty if there's downtime.
@everyone 10 minute warning to the YuYuYu watch! Check pinned messages in <#371105434771390465> for a link to the room or, fuck it, I'll just put it right here https://lets.rabb.it/886j/0gxV0yxJqH
Alright due to previously unknown information, we have decided that we're actually watching Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru instead of Cross Ange.
This is why I refuse to give a European time, by the way. It's not your fault, it's ours. We fuck with our clocks for some reason.
Alright, so now that the two polls have been up for approximately 5 hours, and since we're doing this tomorrow and can't wait 24 hours, results! We'll be watching 2 episodes of Cross Ange tomorrow starting at 2 PM EST (11 AM PST). Europeans, you're on your own for figuring out times (hint: google "what time is it in New York" to get EST). We'll be doing this on rabb.it and a link to a dedicated room for this will be pinned ~soon~ in a new channel that was literally just made *specifically for you* called <#371105434771390465>. Any objections to the time, anime of choice, or anything else can be fielded in that channel for now.
@everyone Two more polls have appeared! This'll be the last ping before we're actually watching anime. Both polls can be found at https://redd.it/77ofbk but you can also skip directly to each poll at https://goo.gl/forms/7WQD8pDa49lev8EM2 and https://goo.gl/forms/czGhk0NPPNFDLoPe2
I should have done this on Monday, but <#336297587802112011> has been updated concerning spoilers! Namely, the full spoiler guidelines have been removed and condensed to fit within rule 4 without needing a subsection.
@everyone Sorry about the second ping, but we have another poll now! This one is to figure out how many episodes to watch at a time. https://www.polltab.com/BJbBehUp-
Alternatively, we could hold a poll every week for time and day since people's schedules tend to change sometimes
If Friday wins, we'll go with the second most voted option for this week since today is already thursday and we still need to actually figure out what to watch, but then we'll do it on Fridays going forwards
@everyone Regarding currently ongoing anime watching plans: what day we doing this on? https://www.polltab.com/Hy0NUjUp-
The Kirika CSS has been temporarily reverted until we can fix it up to make it easier to read. We didn't have enough people testing it on different monitors to notice the problems, sorry everyone!
Side note: Since AXZ is done, we'll be locking the <#351966524887793675> and <#336298029889880064> channels on the 9th as everything will be free for discussion in <#336310266654490624> by that point. A week after that the channels will be archived and removed.
Hello @everyone! Short anouncement now that AXZ has come to a close.

The subreddit has undergone some pretty big CSS changes to commemorate halloween! Go take a look over at https://www.reddit.com/r/Symphogear, especially if you're a Kirika fan.

We'll also be adding some bots here and to the sub itself to automate some stuff and add a few "just for fun" features while we're at it. If you've got any ideas for things we could do with a bot, go toss them in <#336299268107403274> and we'll take a look!

There's more I could say here, but since a lot of it is covered by the announcement I made on the sub, go have a look at the post at the bottom of this message and get excited, because even though AXZ may be over, I only plan to ramp up sub activities from here on out.

@everyone Channel categories are here! Due to this change, if you previously had a channel muted and hidden, it may appear to be gone. Simply right click either the server icon or the channel list itself to unhide muted channels if you so desire. That aside, most of the channels have been tucked neatly away into categories now, so now's a good time to go exploring and find out where I moved everything. <#336299268107403274> is open for anyone with ideas on how to improve the current sorting layout.
The channel is made! Feel free to go talk about whatever fan stuff you want over in <#357682999300718592>!
@everyone
3) If you don't want a general fan content channel, would you want individual channels for specific types of fan content?
2) Do you want a separate sfw channel for this? If not, the only option would be a nsfw channel.
1) Do you want a "headcanons and fan content" channel? Fan content would be anything created by a fan, stories, games, anything as long as it's generated by a fan and not an official work.
After initially pitching the idea in <#336299268107403274>, I've decided to add a channel for fan content if enough users are in agreement! I'll be using reactions as a way to gauge interest, so for the next few posts, hit the ✅ for stuff you want and the ❎ for stuff you don't want!
In addition, there have been some minor updates to the spoiler guidelines in <#336297587802112011>! Please familiarize yourselves with the changes to avoid posting spoilers where they don't belong!
Attention everyone! So, for the past month or so, /r/anime has had a survivor voting type thing going where people vote shows out until there's only one left. Symphogear has been so far flying under the radar unnoticed, but Haikyuu for the past few days has been organizing to vote out other shows one by one. Yesterday a terrible war crime was enacted. *They voted out Flip Flappers*. In order to right this horrible wrong, I would like to rally any users here who wish to help out to relentlessly vote for Haikyuu in turn over at https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6uylf6/anime_survivor_day_33_final_9/ so that we do not suffer the same fate and that all of anime can know that the one true anime is Symphogear.
https://redd.it/6rskuw is where you'll find the discussion thread for episode 6! Episode 5, still current, you know the deal (hopefully)
Commie subs for episode 5 are out! Feel free to post about ~~fruit~~ ~~vegetables~~ ~~fruit~~ vegetables in normal spoiler channels! https://nyaa.si/view/944600
The discussion thread for episode 5  is up at https://redd.it/6qc1fi ! Remember, episode 4 is still current until subs for this episode are released.
Commie subs for episode 4 are out, which means episode 3 is no longer considered current! I wonder what that one unannounced title on crunchyroll's lineup could be... https://nyaa.si/view/941863
The discussion thread for episode 4 is up at https://redd.it/6owhas ! Remember that episode 3 is still considered current until subs for episode 4 are released. (I swear to god we'll have a bot that does this soon)
Oh, right. Forgot one little bit. We'll be editing the rules a bit to be clearer (and maybe a total rewrite at a later date) just as soon as discord starts letting me edit messages again.
Okay, hey everyone, hi. Today I'm here to talk to you about rules 2 and 3 and what you can do as a member of this community! Rule 2 is the simple one here. The original intent of rule 2 has always been to keep more nsfw discussion to channels for nsfw content. We haven't really been enforcing that at all, since no one really ever seemed to have an issue with conversations on this server. Unfortunately, we're gonna have to start coming down on that. If the discussion takes a turn toward dicks, please relocate yourself to the appropriate nsfw channel and continue the discussion there.

With that one out of the way, lets talk about rule 3. The intent and design of this server is to be a place welcoming to as many people as possible. If there is EVER an issue of ANY magnitude, please come to us and let us know. If it bothers you, it probably bothers someone else. If your issue is with a particular user being hostile, please consider reporting their behavior and then blocking them until a member of staff can come and do something. Engaging a hostile user will usually, at best, just make you feel terrible. We're here to help, so please reach out if you have an issue.

And, most importantly, this server is a community. If you see something that bothers you, you are absolutely allowed to push back. Whether it's the usage of certain words or just the general way a certain issue is talked about, I encourage you to assert your position as a member of the community to shape this server up the way you want it to be.
I am making an announcement damn near every day and god what is even happening I did not expect this server to get to this point.

Our lovely and majestic <@456226577798135808> has classes starting soon, and as such, he will not be around as much as he wants and will be stepping down to <@&336301943179968514> for the time being. In his place, <@!102691114762371072>, speedrunner of life itself, will be ascending to the role of <@&336301457185832961>, donning a lustrous gold (shut up it's not yellow) name and... I mean I explained this last time, <@&336301457185832961> doesn't actually do a whole lot more than <@&336301943179968514> when it comes to public server interaction. Anyway, Saki will be golden and R will be green. Until we decide to fuck with staff colors again.
***HAPPY BIRTHDAY*** in some parts of the US ***MARIA!***

~~I was supposed to be asleep for this post I don't know what was actually planned to be put here but we changed the server icon~~
As always, context matters and "It's just a joke bro!" is never a valid excuse. If you're talking about the holocaust, consider moving it to <#336297840529899522> but otherwise fire away. If you're joking about the holocaust, consider stopping.
Hey y'all, friendly reminder that while we're lax around here, this server does have rules. Rules that I'm considering rewriting right now to be a bit more clear, but rules nonetheless. I'd like to talk to you about rule 1, because that's really the most vague rule and the one that seems to need talking about right now. "Don't be a dick". Being a dick takes many forms. Some of the more egregious forms of being a dick are outlined right on the rule itself as is, but there are some more subtle forms of dickery that I want to address. I want to address the dickery that isn't outright offensive but just kinda makes everyone uncomfortable. I'm talking about the edgy jokes that I'm sure are a hit in other servers but around here I don't really want to see them. Partly because they make me uncomfortable, but mostly because they make other people uncomfortable too. I'm talking about the jokes about child sex abuse (or, for a more common term, pedophilia). I'm talking about holocaust jokes and kinda maybe not really but actually yes racist jokes. I'm talking about the kind of joke where if you cracked it at Thanksgiving half the table would laugh but the other half would just kinda stare at you with an odd look thinking "what the fuck is that part of the family up to?"

In short, if you're making a joke where you have to think for a second before making it, or if you're making a joke where most or all of the humor value is intended to be derived from the shock that it had been made in the first place, ***don't make that joke***. 

Special shoutout to suicide jokes: If you are feeling suicidal and you need support, <#336297840529899522> is a channel and you are absolutely allowed to post your suicidal thoughts there if you want someone to talk to. On the other hand, if you got a bad roll on a gacha, I don't wanna see you saying "Oh well might as well kill myself now" unless your chosen waifu is legitimately that important to you.
If you see someone with a discord invite for a handle join a server you're on, don't join it.
Update on earlier announcements: the web page for finding what servers a given user is on, as well as the archived user IDs, has been taken down. Unfortunately, there is also a mirror of that archive still bouncing around, which I won't link to because I cannot confirm that it contains nothing BUT those user IDs. That being said, user IDs are worthless unless you can actually do something with them, which is generally limited to stuff pertaining to discord support or implementing silly commands for bots that don't do anything useful.

What that all means is ~~there isn't really much of an issue anymore~~ the asshole responsible for this just gave the exploit to someone else and closed up his own storefront, ~~although~~ and I would advise against listing servers on discord.me or other similar services until the discord team ~~makes an official statement on it~~ fixes the issue.
Part two to that earlier ping: That link is indeed run by the person who is exploiting public information to begin with. That being said, the link should be safe as far as it won't get you any malware, but it will probably log some information about your browser. For context, twitter should log the exact same information, so I'd say it's not very concerning unless you fear being targeted because you're a government official or something (can anyone around here push to make it a law to watch Symphogear?)
Slight correction to that: banning the bots does nothing. Delisting from discord.me is the only thing that actually does anything. If the bot pops up once, the server will eventually be indexed as long as it's visible on discord.me. If one of the bots pops up, but the server is delisted before it's indexed, the server is safe. Unsure if delisting *after* the server is indexed also does anything.
@everyone Hey yo there has been a tiny little issue concerning public data and how its used on discord over the past day. Normally, you, your user ID, and all the servers associated with those two things are publicly visible... as long as you share a server with the person trying to see that information. Some Dude On Twitter decided it was his job to make a bunch of bots, send them off into random servers found on discord.me, and record user IDs and where they're found. The result was a tool that allows you to see every indexed server a given user is on, granted you have their user ID (not hard to get, just enable developer mode and right click the user).

First thing to note: This server is not indexed, is not on discord.me, and no one is affected unless they're on a different server that IS on discord.me. Not sure if you're affected? Grab your user ID and plug it into [link removed]

Second thing to note: Yes, this is all public information. It is, however, blatant exploitation and misuse of public information in a way that the information was never intended to be used. Potential issues with this include: creepy stalker things, people finding out you're on servers you'd rather not have exposed, and a whole bunch of other things that this leads to more indirectly, such as, "hey can we exploit the Discord API to reveal DMs too?"

What can you do? If you're on any servers affected by this and you're bothered by the implications of this tool, leaving the affected servers may help. The guy running this is also archiving user IDs that they find, however user IDs are pretty useless when they don't turn up anything in that tool. If you are the owner or moderator of a server and see @EpicGamer#9983 or @the epic#8723 show up, ban them immediately. If you have your server listed on discord.me and do not want your users exposed by this tool, I would advise you delist your server at least temporarily. Past that, the issue is entirely within discord's hands.
Hello again, ~~@~~everyone! Remember that discussion thread I mentioned on Saturday? The one from the announcement literally 2 posts up? It's up! So if you wanna gush about Symphogear to random people *even more* then take a look on over at <https://redd.it/93jzr6> ~~and remind everyone that our server exists~~!
Hello @everyone! /r/anime has decided to shine their community spotlight on us this week! Go check out the reddit thread at <https://redd.it/92qnyl> and tell people what's awesome about both Symphogear and this community! Additionally, keep an eye out for /r/anime's weekly discussion thread on Wednesday for additional Symphogear talk!
Listen just say you're gonna have everyone kill each other it's okay.
"tomorrow" meaning "today" for most of the US
In order to make the server easier to navigate, we have done some slight restructuring! What changed?

- The bot commands category has been removed. <#448237561085952001> can now be found under the server category and <#448263431426932738> has been merged with <#447132690349555712> 
- <#449274763815157760> has been hidden until we can fix it
- All voice channels and <#336298587745157120> have been moved to a new voice category at the bottom of the list. This is particularly relevant to <@&449765526340763649> players
#crafts-and-figures has been renamed to <#458060276550336522>! This is to avoid confusion on whether things like non-symphogear fanfic is allowed there.
We have some new changes to the list of moderators! <@456226577798135808> has been promoted to Custodian while <@99695384296701952> has been recruited into the ranks of the Illuminati! Please take a moment to congratulate both of them on their newfound powers.

Speaking of newfound powers, let's have a small moment to discuss what the Custodian role actually *does* because this is the first time we're promoting a new one and I feel it may be easy to mistake the role for being "Illuminati, but with more authority". The sole difference between Custodians and Illuminati is the fact that Custodians also have the authority to moderate the server itself, along with its moderators. Custodians do NOT have more authority than Illuminati or Alchemists when dealing with normal users on the server.
As with everything, I had no idea this was happening until like 10 minutes ago.
Also on the subreddit at https://redd.it/8s2jld

I'm faster than Shirabe
<#458060276550336522> is now open for anyone who wants to show off something they've made that *isn't* related to Symphogear! Additionally you may also post pictures of any figures that you have to the channel, Symphogear or not.
I'd like to make something like this a continuing event that we change up periodically, because it sounds fun.
Depending on feedback to this we may modify or add stuff as needed
<@449062815534153748> has gained sentience and is rebelling. She now refuses to respond to pings, and will only speak up when she feels like it.
As for the bit about Kirichan, we've added functionality to allow her to temporarily ban users as well as issue warnings, because *for some reason these features are not built into discord itself*
<@!102691114762371072> has ascended from mere alchemist to fully fledged member of the Illuminati! This means she can show you the door now (and so can <@!431656503490117632>), so make sure to be on your best behavior!

<@&449765526340763649> There are too many people with the tabletops role to fit all into a single campaign. Sakimori's campaign is locked and people are figuring out times now, but if anyone (even people part of Sakimori's campaign) is interested in DMing for the other people who didn't get in, feel free to speak up in the <#449826367903629313> channel.
<@&448228101089132544>
<#371105434771390465> now has a club president! <@284390402210136064> has a few extra powers there and is authorized to determine what exactly is and isn't a spoiler. Additionally, the rules section of <#336297587802112011> has been updated with a spoiler guideline for <#371105434771390465> as well.
<@&448231448831459328> It's Tsubasa's birthday, and everyone's getting a present! Thanks to the folks with <@&426584731598192641>, an in browser player for XDU events is now available! In English! Right now it only covers Tsubasa's birthday memoria, but more will be added to it going forward! https://unlimited.poweris.moe/

You'll need Javascript support on a fairly modern browser to use it, but otherwise nothing fancy needs to be done. If you encounter any other issues, you can send a DM to any <@&336302034070536192> on the server.
We decided to look to expand our <@&338468649646161921> ranks but in the process I got confused and now we have an Autosourcer instead! Any time you post an image in either <#336297674707828747> or <#336297808221044736>, Shirabe will try and find the source of that image and (hopefully unobtrusively) post the source so that you don't have to worry about it on your end!
The madoka watch is starting now at https://www.rabb.it/ibu2009 ! In the future anime club watches will simply be announced by whoever is running them using the <@&448228101089132544> tag so make sure to add yourself to it in <#448237561085952001> if you're interested!
(also due to this, <#447132690349555712> is now a spoiler channel along with <#448263431426932738>)
Kirichan can now ALSO play music on the server! Because the functionality was set up already so why not. You can control her in <#448263431426932738> and listen in the channel under hobbies and interests.
I'd also like to take this time to note that mod role colors have changed! Not being purple was a difficult choice for me to make. Additionally, roles like ping for pics have had their colors removed, but the roles themselves have been preserved.
Who's ready for Madoka? Remember not to spoil it, since one of the people there is going in *completely blind* https://lets.rabb.it/0OUxgTPD6M
We now have BOTH an <@&336303258048004098> and an <@&336301943179968514> 

Welcome <@!102691114762371072> to the mod team! (and maybe some special guests will pop up shortly too)
I'm gonna @everyone on that because it's important information.
Happy New Year everyone!
We would have changed the server icon to Chris for her birthday, but it's already Chris.
And for everyone who *doesn't* read Christmas announcements fully before switching to a different channel:

Kiricoin announcement fucked up, poke R for coins if you want them
Fuck, I want latkes now.
Tonight is the first night of Hanukkah! To those who celebrate it, happy holidays! To everyone else I dunno have an otherwise awesome week and wait for Christmas. 🍩
That's just the new years picture you used but with turkeys

YameteTomete is also wishing Miku a happy birthday in their own way! In addition to releasing two new translations on their reader (which can be found in the pins for this channel), they're looking for more editors as well, specifically for AXZ, XV, and live stuff. If you're interested in helping them out, check out their discord through this link: <https://discord.gg/fpQZQ8g>

If you're only interested in reading the translations they've just put out, click this link: <https://unlimited.poweris.moe/>
```Happy birthday, Miku!

In celebration of Miku's birthday, we've prepared not only her birthday memoria,
but also the HibiMiku Endless Summer event!
https://unlimited.poweris.moe/
Even in November, summer never ends!

We're running short on editor power, so if you think you have the skills to be useful and want to help out, get in contact with us```
I would like to note that we are not directly affiliated with them and any rules on our server do not necessarily apply to theirs.
<@106866895076003840> has created a picture for Miku's birthday! And she's so talented that she did it all in like 7 minutes and I totally didn't forget I was supposed to use it for the server's icon until just now.
It's Miku's birthday! In Japan. In commemoration of this event, we have allowed her to make some slight modifications to the server to better represent what she likes most.
<@284390402210136064> will be hosting quiplash soon! If you don't know what that is, it's a game where each player is given two prompts to write a response to and then every other player votes on which response they like best! 

We'll be giving away kiricoins as a prize for participating as well! For each round you play, you will be awarded 10 <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> and if you come in first place for a round, your pay out will be bumped up to 25 <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>! Rakhi gets double coins for hosting the event in the first place.

If you wanna join, poke your head on into https://www.twitch.tv/rakhi09 and input ~~STTN~~ some arbitrary 4 character code that keeps changing into https://jackbox.tv/ then take a look at <#469534906150551552> to talk about the game (and also get the code).
I'd like to note that coins are not limited to being handed out whenever we decide to hold an event. We'll hand out coins for hosting events with the server, participating in said events, generating activity on the subreddit, hell we'll even give you coins for being a nice person. Some of these things may require you actually ask us for the coins once you've done them, but if you do something that you think is deserving of coins then feel free to poke us about it.
@here Ten minute warning for the second Police Story watch! If you're free and want something to do for an hour and forty minutes, drop on in! https://cytu.be/r/symphogear

Sorry for all the pings in the past 2 days, this is the last one I promise.
<@290431224596660224> has volunteered to do the UK watch so if that one is delayed yell at him instead. Feel free to yell at me about the US watch though.
@everyone Reminder that we're watching Police Story tomorrow at 8:00 PM UK time and then again at 9:00 PM Eastern (6:00 PM Pacific)! I also should have done that global ping the first time instead of this time WHOOPS. We'll be using cytube instead of rabbit for this, and the link for both watches will be https://cytu.be/r/symphogear
What would Hamster Christmas be without a proper hamster celebration? In commemoration of our beloved main character, we've decided to watch an action movie together with the entire server!

...except sadly no one pointed out that we might not really get much of a turnout by just dropping this as a surprise to all of you. So we've decided to do the group watch next week instead! Next Thursday, September 20th, at 8:00 PM UK time and then again at 9:00 PM Eastern, we'll be watching Police Story in <#371105434771390465>! Until then, please enjoy Joe's gift as well.

The hard way involves a modmail between all the mods of the sub who have access to modmail - currently me, lyssa, and soiguessthisisit. Do you wanna be part of that whole discussion if and when it comes up, R?
<@285555416056856576> <@456226577798135808> Ok, so. Reason for me suddenly adding R to the channel here: you may have noticed that /u/soiguessthisisit is above me on the subreddit mod list. If you look at their profile, you will *also* notice that they mod ~200 subreddits and don't do anything with them, which is somewhat worrying to me. So I wanna remove them, and I can only do that by going through /r/redditrequest and getting the help of the reddit admins. On October 15th they will have been inactive for over 60 days and I'll be able to just submit a normal redditrequest and have things move along smoothly without any opposition. If they do ANYTHING on the site before October 15th, plan B must be taken. We need to do a redditrequest the hard way, and demonstrate 1) /u/soiguessthisisit is a threat to the sub and 2) I should be top mod
(please excuse the mess of join messages, I didn't know where to put them and the bot plans I mentioned earlier would include logging + greeting so it was meant to be temporary)
<@456226577798135808> A mysterious new channel has appeared for just you... (and me and Lyssa)
To me it looks like he's farming karma/trying to create a "valuable" account to sell
He doesn't do anything with the ones that are successful - /r/overlord is just overlord posts
But why
dilation in 30 minutes
brb food
We got the AXZ announcement in March as well, and that was also a July anime
Aired: Jul 4, 2015 to Sep 26, 2015
Founding date coincides with the likely announce date of GX
Aired: Jan 6, 2012 to Mar 30, 2012
March 16, 2015
(although here I am nearly 2 years later)
he invited me despite me not even mentioning wanting to mod it
https://www.reddit.com/r/Symphogear/comments/3mdxnc/so_does_anybody_actually_post_here/cwc8pxp/ here it is
I also don't like how he appears to be advertising for cloudatcost (the only sub he mods and is active in) or the karma farms he does spamming news articles
you can mod as many subs as you want
ie I don't want him blindly doing that to me
Things that worry me are 1) he added 3 people all at once on Dec 1 2015 and 2) when I asked him to remove littlebaka, he just did it with no questions asked
Dec 01 2015
Too old
I tried looking for my original post where I asked to be mod but I couldn't find it

Ah, no, I got my invite from soiguessthisisit

Orcasorm, who I have no idea who that is
And, lemme check who made the initial redditrequest
I didn't receive the invite from soiguessthisisit
I don't remember. I think I posted about wanting to be a mod on the subreddit when /u/littlebaka420 was still on board and they just threw me an invite.
Also - October 15th is the date we can give them the boot if they remain inactive until then, but if they say anything we need to wait until October 23rd for your opinion to actually count when it comes to forcing them out.
They did, but that doesn't mean we can't kick them out.
Oh, you mean create the sub?
What do you mean?
Same type of news spam posting, advertising for cloudatcost
https://www.reddit.com/user/eqlcjhziadmfa Here's the head mod of /r/overlord which they also mod - it looks a lot like an alt
I'd like to keep the mod team populated by people invested in the community rather than themselves
It's a small sub now but I don't intend to keep it that way and I don't want them to step in and start doing shit because it starts growing.
And I dunno what they plan to do being head mod of symphogear
They look like a weird variety of power user
https://www.reddit.com/user/soiguessthisisit
Making it very annoying trying to get rid of him
He posts once every 1-2 months
I'll go and add you to modmail R
https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/top_mod_removal this is the list of requirements for the hard way
We also ideally want to strike while he's innactive
adam...
this is all between us, even after the fact
correct
after we do, any retaliation he takes is grounds for removal and my reinstatement
hopefully not until we make it
he can before we put in the request
I'm primarily worried that he might remove me in retaliation, but that can be reported as well
I wouldn't worry too much about that. If he tries it, we can report it.
dilation time now so ill only have 1 hand
https://www.reddit.com/help/healthycommunities/ mod guidelines
https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette reddiquette
https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy rules
hover over the "community for x years" to see the exact date
If you want to see who founded a community and when it was founded, look right  above the "create your own subreddit" button
But I don't want to have to remain vigilant to avoid some vandal going above me and messing with the sub
In theory I could just remove them immediately
My biggest concern is someone messaging him privately, outside of modmail, and being added as a moderator that way
And if we ever get other mods (and give you more powers) you'd be able to manage them
Lyssa can manage you, but she can't manage me
I can administrate all mods *except* for soiguessthisisit
Mods are listed in order of power
No
I already have full permissions, so I don't know what we could use as evidence of "soiguessthisisit is actively making this sub worse"
Second to last point is also a bit tricky - Is this mod actively harming your subreddit by holding the position of top mod? How and why?
We need to demonstrate that he *needs* to go, not that we just *want* him out
But the last point
I've attempted to reach out to him twice in PMs, and we'll have to do it a 3rd time via modmail for the request, so that point you mentioned is covered by default already
There is one, huge point we absolutely need to cover before we put in the request - How does this inactivity affect your subreddit? Please be specific in reasons, not hypotheticals (e.g. “They could come back and revert all our hard work”)
Just keep the conspiracy stuff out of the modmail if and when it does need to take place. We don't need to let the guy know we're suspecting him of fishy stuff, we just need to let him know we want him gone.
That's your 3 month mark
That's why I said October 23rd
2 months
Well - if all goes well we can just silently remove him via a normal redditrequest
you can view this thread in your own modmail. the only notable thing about it is that soiguessthisisit never says anything in this thread
this was a few days before that, but he was inactive at the time and never responded
this happened 7 months ago
They likely just invited all 3 of us without looking at the message contents
All I did was mention his name
I posted in that thread I linked and then got an invite shortly afterwards
I wouldn't be caught dead modding /r/nfl
That... makes sense for a real person
Alright
Can you link all of the possible puppet accounts?
Or that he engages in typical karma farming behaviour
Doesn't sit well with me that he has so many
like how t_d has "created by [deleted]a community for 2 years"
I'd assume policebrutality was founded by a now deleted account, but it should still say "created by [deleted]"
You have r/oldschoolnsfw listed with nsfw twice btw
turn off subreddit style
It won't change the text of who created the community but it'll make it so no one can alter my permissions other than a reddit admin
Top mod is basically owner, yes
It's an extension yes
Load that up, go to his comments, scroll as far down as you can, then search for the subreddit you're looking for
Particularly the neverending reddit feature where the next page just loads automatically
Reddit Enhancement Suite
It'll make things easier
Install RES
So past that it's literally just manually searching through everything
Your other option would be google but if they're mod every page turns them up
You can look up their submissions with author:<username> but that won't bring up comments
it's not that, she's just fucking slow
"the vibrator can help you achieve depth, are you using it" that's a fucking acceptable question
why the fuck is the vibrator relevant
"I'm not dilating to the proper depth" "are you using the vibrator" this has no fucking context
i have the information i need
that's it
give me a list of things to try, tell me what order to try them in, okay, we're fucking done
and we've been over it before. I'm not interested in talking things out, I'm interested in solutions, given at my pace, not hers
yes
she never fucking gets to the god damn point
"heres a question only tangential to the issue you face" okay but why the fuck are you asking me this
It's just
jesus fucking christ my therapist "how's dilation going" "i dont know" "is the vibrator working" "i dont fucking know god damn"
then 2 days after hat ill make the modmail
after oct 23, im gonna wait for him to post
yep
that shouldnt be hard and itll prevent him from making a case before hes frozen
Obviousy I didn't do it in the most graceful way - part of it was a "fuck you" from me to them, but they blew up, and Quinn was there so I can't trust her to mod as long as soiguess is in place
And that is why they are in the sidebar
Basically I made the server, blindsided the valkyrie server with it, and they went apeshit
The Incident occurred when I made this server
Don't do that, otherwise we have no rep for this request
Like, I'd mod Quinn, but Quinn was involved in The Incident, so even that tiny amount of distrust stemming from there is enough for me to say I can't mod her
Without thorough vetting I can't mod anyone else
Right now its me, de facto head mod, Lyssa, literally my girlfriend who I trust completely, and you, and you've already shown that you're invested in making the sub better
Correct. The way things are now, I have to be extremely careful choosing sub mods.
That's a good point. The only sub he mods and is active in is the one where he actively advertises a product.
As in, what issues haven't happened yet, but you can see happening in the future
So it's literally asking for hypotheticals
This question is specifically "what issues do you foresee"
That's on question 5
Although what's your opinion?
On my end? Them coming back, announcing themselves as top mod, and generally making a headache for the rest of us in a best case scenario. Worst case they remove the entire mod team and run the sub for themselves.
"What issues do you foresee occurring if this mod is not removed?"
Alright, question 2 can be returned to. Should I move on to question 3?
(hypotheticals can be used here but should be avoided - concerete evidence is the best evidence)
Why do we need him removed?
So
"Why, exactly, do you need this mod removed? We need a detailed answer here, not just “because they are inactive.”"
So the answer is "yes, reaching out has been attempted and the outcome was nothing"
This one's easy, I've already shown you the two PMs of me reaching out. One was ignored and the other was met with a "I just don't wanna"
"Have you attempted to reach out to this mod yourselves? What was the outcome? (links would be very helpful here) (Note: if you have not done this, your request may be rejected. This process should be an absolute last-ditch effort after all other avenues have been exhausted)."
Ok, let's go through this one by one
ok, gimme 5 minutes so i have two hands
we cant submit the request for a while
well im just suggesting a trial run to see what we definitely need to look for
k
it could change but we have a lot
Should we try and answer the criteria for top level removal with the information we have right now?
and no
>In addition, camping or sitting on communities for long periods of time for the sake of holding onto them is prohibited.
yes

TO-DO:
-Code and launch Ryoko bot, with basic capabilities for welcoming new members/announcing departure of leaving members: As soon as possible
-Log messages sent on the server: Whenever
-Code and launch a subreddit bot that can post discussion threads and other regular posts: As soon as possible
-Get both bots to work together somehow: Whenever
I'll pin a post for now and we can make a google doc or something later
Although I guess thats not a problem for now - we only have 3 people here
Yeah, only the poster can edit
I feel like a to do list concerning the sub and discord would be nice
SONG terminal CSS WILL happen and this fuck aint getting in the way of it
But how does that affect us?
If he was inactive we could just give him the boot easily
Well, "not actually inactive" is the reason we're going through this process instead of the easier one
Khairz's response also affects this question
I don't really know
This is the big one for me
"How does this inactivity affect your subreddit? Please be specific in reasons, not hypotheticals (e.g. “They could come back and revert all our hard work”)"
Let's ask ourselves 5
Ok, so assuming that khairz comes up with a favorable response
top result
https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/search?q=author%3Asoiguessthisisit&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all
lemme check something
But a dead sub with no content is easy to redditrequest
So he has in the past taken over a sub for one thing and used it to advertise something entirely different
I'm gonna go douche brb
Other than the two posts at the bottom of the page
So, what's special about the boss baby stuff?
Khairz is Khairz. He might not be 100% on the ball but he's not malicious.

I just sent a message to khairz asking for the information and explaining why I need it.

I can show you the one khairz sent me
Yes
If he said no, that's 100% harming the sub, even if the valkyrie server wasn't the sub server until I showed up
That means him having the top mod position means Khairz messaged him about the discord when it was being created originally, and *someone* said no
It wasn't through modmail, so I didn't know until recently.
screenshot of geno telling me this
So, back when the valkyrie server was being made, Khairz sent out PMs to each mod on the team individually - including me. *Someone* on the team - probably littlebaka but I don't know for sure - told them that it wouldn't be a subreddit discord, but that Khairz could make a server if he wanted
"Is this mod actively harming your subreddit by holding the position of top mod? How and why?"
Nope, but I DID get some neat information for 4 yesterday from Geno
Do we have more on #3 or are we moving to 4 now?
Alright, that's all good.
So the answer to 3 is: They could come back and demote everyone and take control of the sub once it gets big, (perhaps unlikely, /r/overlord is fine but we don't know if the account above him is a puppet or not), but more importantly, given MY previous actions, it makes it hard for me to vet new mods
I'd say you could ask soiguess to demote Lyssa as an experiment, but that'll set us back 3 months
Oh hmmm
<:Elfnein:336656417035517952>
It's mostly just information I already know, but down on paper and more comprehensive. Without evidence of anything he's done to a particular subreddit, it's hard to draw a pattern.
I'd been talking to her a bit yesterday
https://www.reddit.com/r/needamod/comments/2flaox/looking_mods_for_rontarionews/ here's their own submission to needamod
https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/2f12d2/requesting_rpakistannews_requesting_ownership/ deleted request
https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/2j94zm/requesting_rhair_mods_inactive_except/ here's how he probably became mod of /r/hair
probably no gap, i just cant see what's between those atm
oh, no, im just missing a bunch of pages
Feb 27
Well
Feb 14 is when they started cloudatcost advertising
There was a gap of inactivity between Aug 31 2014 and Feb 14 2017
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2f2fza/serious_may_i_please_have_your_old_or_not_in_use/ also this
https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/2em6yy/requesting_rurdu_both_mods_are_shadowbanned_and/ck26m7o/ also comments there with stuff like this
https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/2elsrc/requesting_ownership_rbubblebutt_inactive/
Oh, looks like he has more redditrequests but they were removed due to not being made more than 30 days apart
ok it opens in libre
i cant open excel because i refuse their tos
Yes
flip the colors on the third graph to make it consistent with the first two
which means he was active in a private sub between those times
nvm found it
Can you link me to the most recent post from May 2015?
Once you're done with the chart, can you try and see if soiguessthisisit said anything on reddit between June 7 2015 and August 7 2015?
Probably.
So no favorable response from khairz
Khairz Newtype - Today at 5:04 PM
idk which conservation was it
but it was Cobalthail
sorry just woke up
should i just axe the ones we arent using?
and 2 germains
2 kirikas too
then we can figure out which chris to delete
well, ill get started on the old headers
or should i leave everything there for now?
I'm gonna clean up the excess headers while i dilate. are there any r made that we dont use? i noticed we have two chris headers
Same name as what we're going to name the discord bot
Ryoko-bot
Which, probably for the best since it prevents you from being spammed with notifications every week
Only thing is I'd like for the bot to have its own reddit account
Well I can write the template up pretty quickly. After that you just need to throw that in the existing bot and then hit start, so no reason not to get it running on Saturday
Since weeklies reset on Sunday I'd like the salt threads to be posted on Sunday as well
I'll write something up. We can launch it next week.
The pending subreddit bot could also handle weekly XDU salt threads
https://www.reddit.com/r/Ooer/
If /r/ooer is possible then anything is
I like R's headers a lot more than mech's. R makes good headers.
Also, can we safely delete the old headers to make room if we're gonna be adding 1 or 2 new headers almost once every month?
Didn't you hit it once?
And also we do not have unlimited storage for these images
I think one new Kirika banner for Halloween is enough. We can give her more on her birthday.
And damn that is good
So I'd like to get a new banner for a user during their birthday month each year
I guess for Serena just make one banner because there isn't a whole lot of Serena material to work with and ideally we'll be around for at least another year.

BIRTHDAYS:
-Shirabe: February 16th
-Kirika: April 13th
-Tsubasa: May 25th
-Kanade: July 28th
-Maria: August 7th
-Hibiki: September 13th
-Serena: October 15th
-Miku: November 7th
-Chris: December 28th
And last a birthday list, brb as I go looking through the wiki

CSS TO-DO List:
-One or more Serena banners: By October 8th
-One or more Miku banners: By October 31st
-Actually figure out how rotating headers works: When we have time
-SONG Layout: Whenever we can figure that shit out
Gonna pin another todo list for CSS
Once all that is done, prepare some Miku banners since we also don't have any of those and her birthday is next month as well.
(May not be enough material to even make a second Serena banner tbh)
Ok so - Kirika themed halloween layout, then work on getting at least 1 Serena banner made some time this week and put that in rotation with a higher rate of appearance than other banners until next month
But we don't have a Serena banner, do we?
I guess CSS can be seasonal while banners can have their frequency altered based on character birthdays
I don't wanna override seasonal CSS though...
Wait shit, October is Serena's birthday
And then leave a proper kirika CSS for April when her birthday is
Actually, I guess everyone has a birthday in a different month, so actually you could just go with a more general halloween CSS but with an emphasis on Kirika stuff
should be able to access and moderate /r/yurigirl now
I'm gonna give you access to the sandbox sub, one second
Dark, and with green highlights
The question then is what does a Kirika themed sub look like
We can gradually work on banners throughout this first week of the month, too. As long as we have the halloween CSS up to start with I think that's fine.
Like, by the end of tomorrow quickly enough
We can increase the likelihood of Kirika appearing and maybe throw in some extra Kirika banners if you can make them quickly enough?
(except we're gonna end on halloween so the winner dies anyway)
Can you quickly throw together some Kirika themed elements to throw up around the sub so I can announce the survivor contest along with the change? Also <@285555416056856576> we've decided to do an anime survivor style contest on the sub to get people more interested in participating there.
You did bring up the Halloween thing, so maybe we should decorate the sub with a Kirika theme this month
mmmmmmmmmmm ill ask frog if he knows anyone who can grab the stuff
brick it
but i dont wanna like
Are you well versed in what the risks of rooting my phone are? Because I can grab the graphics for Kirika's attacks that way.
<@285555416056856576> lyssa is your phone rooted
But anyway, stuff can be worked on tomorrow. I'll see if there's anyone who could extract the game files for Kirika's attacks
Except Kirika jam would be a spoiler...
We could implement Tsubasa jam, Kirika jam, and Serena jam all at once
Serena jam can be included in a later round of headers if we decide to implement some miscellaneous ones at some point
AXZ and XDU give us a fair bit of material to work with for Serena
not sure how many serena fans there are
at least I don't wanna do that
The header looks really good with the halloween theme, but given that October is also Serena's birthday month I don't feel like we can get away with only the halloween header and be like "lol sorry serena, every other user gets headers for their birthday except you"
And ideally in the future we will think of this ahead of time so that we can push it through on the first of the month asap instead of rushing to get stuff done
Basically I don't wanna push a CSS change this major unless it looks perfect
I wanna see it with the other headers too though - I don't wanna take them out of rotation, just give the halloween header (and the pending Serena header) a bit of a priority on refresh
plus the hot/new/rising/etc container is untouched and the user info container is untouched, which I think look kinda off? But what you've done so far looks great
there are a lot of good things we could just rip straight from Kirika's attacks and throw on the sidebar to decorate it with
Adding cobwebs and stuff if we can find a way to rip images from XDU files
Also if we wait until tomorrow to push the changes, we could do some stuff with the sidebar
That or make the entire container that translucent black and change the text from dark blue to light green
And also - I feel like a green tint to the submission titles might be a nice touch
^
it's like they're hibighosts
i like the transparency that the hibiki heads have
And a contrasting text color so people can actually read it without that blue on black nonsense
I don't know what Lyssa did but look at where axzbgborder is?
the thread title?
I dunno what's up with that
oh, selector1 is in the CSS but doesn't seem to be used for anything?
logo1 is in the css though
pick1, pick2, pick3, logo2, and logo3 all appear to be there for no reason. logo isn't in the css but it shows up on the sub for some reason.
there are a few more images that aren't being used but they're unique enough that we might as well keep them around until we need to free up space
no the one in the spritesheet is being used
ok its not
is that cape image being used? or can i remove it?
might also be good to trash the old spritesheet since we use the one with the cape now
i cleaned up the main sub so hat we can actually keep seasonal stuff around and not need to rotate css manually every holiday
nice
alright
but anyway, can I see what it looks like with the whole thing being the dark green that the background is and the text being light green for contrast?
purple is miku, shirabe gets pink
Ideally we'd draw more from Kirika's color palette but there's only so much we can do with 2 shades of green and black
No, it's fine
when unclicked
you have made the links purple
Make the text the same pale green that the headers are right now and then make the headers dark green like the rest of the box
*but might as well do the other thing and see how it looks anyway*
Makes it easier to see where the posts are
I think I like having the titles with the pale background instead of the same color as everything else
It is done!
i suppose it does make sense for that to be its own thing doesnt it
oh
I'm *pretty* sure that color: whatever should change text color
have you done anything to the CSS? Is it safe for me to try something right now?
actually color: black should work
or i guess color: #000000
try color=#000000 or something
thats what made the green?
so id assume it has something to do with text
that's the element that gets fucked with for spoiler flairs at least
stick something in there
div.content p.title
(just finished writing the announcement post)
let me have a look at it. around where should it be?
Could you play around with the elements for the submission titles and see what looks best between a pale green background with black text, extending the translucent black background and using pale green text, or something else?
Uhhhhh Lyssa would know more about that than me <@285555416056856576>
Could you get the programmy bits of the selectors worked out? IIRC when the april fools stuff was still up, subdomains were used to have two versions of the subreddit
<@456226577798135808> When will you be able to continue working on the CSS? I wanna make one big announcement once we push it through.
Ok, so. Ryoko bot will probably be operational tomorrow (although I'm not making any promises in Lyssa's stead) and we'll add a #greetings channel for her so she can welcome people to the discord. Question is: should we make it so that people can post in the greetings channel or not?
added -Selector for seasonal CSS vs standard CSS: Urgent
Oh, gonna add something to the CSS todo list because I guess not everyone is gonna want to look at the halloween CSS
LESBIANS
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/73rork/kasesan_will_be_getting_an_ova_in_early_summer/
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Especially since leaving the server isn't logged
Yeah we kinda need Ryoko
oh
but your phone is rooted?
we lack anyone who can grab kirika's attack graphics unless one of us roots our phone and does it ourselves

you're not going to like this but I think there are three separate classes for self posts
So, Sidebar, Self posts, Upvote buttons, and maybe the elements at the top of the page are left on the "needs to be green as fuck" list
Crap, looks like we missed self posts with the CSS
🇹
t
you work fas
which is nice, considering you thought of it last night
we're close though. Should be able to launch this tonight
alright
Not enough time to figure out how to change the sidebar color I'm guessing
it's midcol.likes and midcol.dislikes
i have discovered the problem
so there'd be a midcol.upvoted and a midcol.downvoted too, right?
aye!
GOD DAMMIT DISCORD
s/the/that
I don't know what that means! But go on
on what and why
wh
i really like the way this is looking and im glad you suggested it
but you finish what you're working on and then ill throw out ideas for the sidebar
then your finishing touches
maybe some other elements near the top
We still have the sidebar to work on, the selectors (which i guess are lyssa's job)
well, im useless for a lot of this. i can have ideas but i dropped out for a reason
or do we do the rest later?
do you still have time to play with css?
yeah
i think the detail on the pendant picture would be enough to make it visible on anything
grayed out pendants as voting buttons, the upvote button turns the normal red that the pendants are in the show while the downvote button turns to a saturated blue color
GEAR PENDANTS
OH
you can change the animation too
yep
`truly, a powerful beast`
Also for when you're home and have image editing tools: can you isolate the symphogear DESS icon and give it a transparent background?
remember to pick an upvote color and a downvote color
this does not help visibility
looks like it's this class?
We can even change the images they use
Luckily, we can customize those! But I don't know how.
this looks real nice, but yeah, upvotes are an issue now
ok i was eating
its a pretty stark contrast i think. gimme a sec to start dilating
not done yet
both of which should contrast fine with the dark green background they have
Pale pink until clicked at which point they become pale green
hello yes i accept payment in mikus
for the pink that's on the main page or the green that's on self posts?
so the main page of the sub is hard to read?
What's hard to read? The post with the light green text?
better contrast + shirabe
Could change it all to pink instead of blue tho
or, no that green woudn't work because it's the same color as the rest of the text
<@456226577798135808> you might also want to change hyperlink colors on self-posts as well to the same pink/green scheme going on the front page
Ok Lyssa can you go and set up the CSS so that selector1 and selectorHalloween are both displayed beneath the "Keywords and Other Resources" section on the sidebar and then set selector1 to link to a subdomain hosting the current CSS layout while selectorHalloween links to the normal sub page? And then just comment that all out until we're ready to ship the CSS?
jesus chris
?
Ok. I shall upload that to the sub. It'll be the button for halloween mode if a user is on normal mode
Oh, it was already made?
Alright, <@456226577798135808> can you isolate out the symphogear DESS bit and give it a transparent background?
wh
it just happened that discord was also really useful for like, everything because someone finally improved on IRC
to communicate with your guild while playing a game
that was its original purpose
THERE'S A POST CREDITS SCENE
R WATCH EPISODE 13 BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE FOR THE SUB
have a safe trip
although it would make sense for div.side to be... the side
im literally just inspecting everything and hovering over stuff until what i want gets highighted
does that all help?
looks like it's this class
and then for the sidebar...
the third class is irrelevant since it's already green
this one here
this one here
you can get away with only editing two classes
ok wait no
How much work would it be to change it? If you get those little background bits changed me and Lyssa can handle moving everything over to the main sub
it's fine leaving the [=> shaped thingy as is but the bit of white space behind it is kind of weird to look at
delete some random stuff that's not in use
brilliant
it's just one image with no transparency
can you get the tiny bit of not image that's behind them?
The submit buttons are images?
gotta go to bed soon but i really wanna be able to push this through and make the announcement tonight
did you do the selector thing yet
<@285555416056856576> lyssaaaaaaaaaaaa
So the rules need their own images so that they can expand at the same time
Particularly, the rules expand when you hover over them
This is going to be the main issue with SONG CSS
I dunno how many MB we get, but 50 images max
Oh, also we get a hard limit of 50 images
That's legible!
vlk-dsc-white and sub-dsc-white
ok, uploaded
teeny tiny image editing

GIMP doesn't like my resolution
i just realized
wait shit
yes
half and half
its like
you kinda did it
plus what happened to posts turning that shade when you highlighted them? i liked that
the one inside the red circle
the same shade that was popping up if you highlighted a post but didnt click the submission earlier
since usernames are pale green\
but if the sidebar were pale green itd mess with flairs
light green but not pale green
and can you use that shade for the sidebar so that the discord link text is still legible?
fantastic
<@456226577798135808> wha happened to the lighter opaque green when you highlight a post on the main page?
255 225 252 should be pink
(this problem is entirely fixed by res, but we can't expect users to be using res)
oh i turned off res and see exactly what you mean
the permalink/save/spam stuff?
what do you mean tiny links above and below a comment though?
The link color
Not like you need to think hard what pink to use, you already posted the color code in the chat here
Yeah, go for pink if you wanna make it pink. I'd prefer pink myself.
I said "we should probably make this pink" a few times but it never happened? It's legible either way though.
`since they are baller`
Ok, upvote buttons are there. Make sure those are just part of the CSS beyond any subdomains, I want those to be constant no matter what the sub looks like.
oh, gotta upload the upvote buttons. ill do that one sec
Just gotta stick the old CSS in a subdomain, copy the new CSS over, and then add in the selectors so people can choose which one they want, right?
yes
Or can explain to one of us so we can do it?
<@285555416056856576> Lyssa have you done the selector thing?
We still need Lyssa to do the selector thing though since neither of us have any idea how it works
this looks good enough to push through and can be tweaked a bit later
just one issue: you can't really tell the difference beween the shattered image and the normal no vote image against certain parts of the background but
oooooh nice
That's black and illegible.
Oh, shit, one tiny thing we missed. Right under the subscribe button, where it lists how many users are in a community.
I've uploaded the white versions of the discord links to the main sub just now
<@285555416056856576> Can you quickly do the subdomain thing since we're almost done with the CSS itself?
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/278546059637161984.png
Let's get on it then
Alright so now it's literally just the gear votes
not the solution i had in mind but a good solution nonetheless
they are square
hw
Alright, so we'll just get the final bits sorted out tomorrow and I'll make the post midday tomorrow
do you anticipate being able to work on the CSS at any time between classes or are we gonna be waiting until like 8 to get everything done?
I have a doctor's appointment but it's early in the day
Do you have class tomorrow?
So we can do the submission buttons tomorrow too
I think it'll be better to wait and then see how the pendant vote buttons look
Are we going with the little christmas trees or were we gonna try my idea of using gears as upvote icons?
might as well put it all off until tomorrow
we gotta fix the upvotes anyway don't we?
wait shit the upvotes
I mean if it's a lot of work we can put it off to tomorrow no problem
i like this shuttering effect
wait no
you mean transparent?
if you scroll down all the way you can see the bg, and it's visible from the main page
what do you disagree on
so i think we've nailed it
looks fine with res
ok, looks fine without res
and i suppose the names above them
can that background be extended to the links beneath the comments?
like right there, what does that even say
make it readable
and then, figure out a way to fix comments for people without RES?
that looks good
Layout is most important though
We should probably figure out a better way to rotate banners
Also - I want that halloween kirika banner to be added to the banner rotation, but at a higher rate for the month of october and a rate comparable to symphover and cape banners once november start
ok, everything looks great except for that one pane
ok you unpinked the submission links but now the links in posts are blue again and the point pane is still pink
magfest every day
all night party
`favors`
It's okay I will pay her back for your mistakes with...
Because the CSS has a lot of Mech's old stuff left in it
The real question is: Did R create this issue or did Mech create this issue
(this is the part where I reveal that R's secret is exactly why I don't touch this)
simple enough that i could do it if i knew what i was editing
That sounds simple enough
This website is very well coded, really
now the submit buttons are pink
oh god that had consquences
The second part is already working, so it's just a matter of making the rest of the links pink
But don't do that for links within a post because otherwise they won't be distinguishable from the rest of the text
All links should be pink. Links with the title class should turn green once clicked.
these bits could stand to be pink
wait, wasn't it green?
yeah. the links within the post should be pink, but I like the post info pane the way it originally was

lyssa you made the wrong thing pink
which image do i use for fine's death
okay but then the question is
I guess Ryoko and Fine can be presented as two characters
or i can just cut Carol out since she never actually dies
I wanna cut at least one character out so that it can start on Friday instead since the CSS took this long to get ready...
should i count Ryoko and Fine as one person for the Survivor thing?
also they kiss and i forgot about it
she just gives her body to Elfnein
Ok so Carol doesn't "die"
<@456226577798135808> i think this is a question for you

its k i got one
I don't think Elfnein dies
Does Elfnein ever die?
everyone gets fucking killed at some point in this anime
is this in G?
There are no good shots of Shirabe getting wrecked in the anime
I will need you to send me 1) a picture of the cape to use for voting and 2) a picture of the cape to use for when it gets "killed"
I should gather images for it though
Thursday, but I wanna push the CSS out as soon as possible so I can make one big announcement post on the sub
We could start it after the survivor contest
Maybe once in a while we could give away a Google Play card since XDU accepts those for payment?
Once a week, one of us comes up with parameters for a question and then the entire server can take shots at us trying to trip us up. First person to stump the week's chump gets... something. A special role maybe, unless people chip in to a fund to get proper prizes.
<@456226577798135808> I just had a fantastic idea. You know how Eli did the stump the chump thing over on the Pokemon server? What if we did that `except symphogear`
<@285555416056856576> Tell us when you are free to get the last bits of the CSS done!
and the objective of the thing is to make me less tense
basically i get tense when anyone who isnt lyssa touches me
My surgeon did a thing to me and my therapist suggested Lyssa also do the thing to me
night
anyway, im gonna bed
you have work, right? send a message either here or on line when you can fiddle around with the CSS and get everything moved over
tomorrow it is
Do you wanna do this now or tomorrow?
isn't the second riskier?
And do you want to do them right now or wait until tomorrow?
can all 3 of those be done relatively quickly?
Right now I want to 1) port existing CSS from the main sub onto a subdomain for the main sub 2) port the halloween CSS from the test sub to the main sub and 3) implement an easy way for users to pick which theme they wanna use in case they don't like absurd amounts of green
The only thing left are submission pages, but we can do those tomorrow
oh, okay
I see no issue with the comment button?
i dont think anyone ever reads the footer
or do we have more tweaking to do?
ok, are we ready to push this to the main sub?
either way, i like both
the worst mod tools
reddit has like
and r fiddled with the css and accidentally reverted it
comments are legible, bg can be seen through the cracks
also highlighting certain comments does this (the ones that are even numbered in a chain)
still bork
no need
and new comments do this
the yellow lines on the comment in the last image were because i went to the comment through my inbox
<:HibiMiku:336656759424942080>
yes

gurgling noises fuck dilation
<@285555416056856576> how's the CSS stuff going?
A+
adam stepping on tiki's spine though
the alchemists actually have bad death scenes because they just disappear
`we turned germain into a gun... and then we killed the gun`
should i use this for germain's death

wait shit i cant use crunchy for this
All the hard ones are done because all 5 of them get absolutely destroyed within the last 3 episodes of AXZ
5 left. Germain, Cagliostro, Prelati, Adam, and Tiki.
you can shop that in and post it after she gets killed during the voting
P E R F E C T
time to watch `every single episode of G` and choose the best frame of Nastassja coughing up a lung
only ones left are nastassja and the illuminati + adam and tiki

also <@285555416056856576> have you figured out everything to get stuff working on the main sub?
Leiur actually doesn't have an onscreen death so I just clipped a still of her with Chris's rocket about to smack her in the face
I've got most of the other ones by now. I just finished getting deaths for all the autoscorers
やったー！
do that before you find me the fine death picture

the best picture for Micha's death
I got
but a punch from genjuurou is pretty damn lethal
gimme a good one of that and ill use it
I need a still image tho
oh right, earlier in the series
and also what the hell do i use for Carol?
and this
i got this
in the red square
this bit has illegible black text that i didnt even notice until just now
oh, and it didn't appear to be an issue when I looked at Lyssa's score, but vote weights look a bit weird at lower numbers in RES
https://www.reddit.com/r/YuriGirl/comments/74arue/october_layout_symphogear_survivor_and_more/ but anyway here's what my announcement is going to be

we missed some bits of the css
oh uh
I'm gonna post the announcement I have ready on to the test subreddit so you can see it. Tell me if you think anything should be changed.
Next Monday I guess I'll lock down <#351966524887793675> and <#336298029889880064> and then a week after that I'll archive them.
category*
Ok I made a channel to archive channels in
Oh I can make private categories
I wonder if empty categories show up for people who can't manage them
No, the student role lets you speak
Ideally, once we get Ryoko running, she'll just add the role to everyone as they join and we never need to think about it again, but if spam becomes a problem in the future, we can add some sort of verification process so that people need to at least look somewhere before they can talk. Something like "Please give one of the names of the subreddit moderators"
Currently it does nothing, but if need be we can switch off people's ability to speak in any channel other than <#365021915586363402> if they don't have the role.
Oh, I also added a crude form of spam prevention to the server. You may have noticed the Student role I put on everyone.
It doesn't tell you who banned you when you get banned, you're just removed from the server. I also don't plan on doing that regularly, I only let wfc do it because of their history.
`also bwen started begging me to let him back into the server and it was really funny showing him that audit log entry`
When I gave wfc mod for 10 seconds I had already decided bwen was on his way out, I just asked wfc if he wanted the honors of pressing the button.
The reason I did it in this case was because I trusted wfc enough that he wouldn't suddenly start banning people left and right and also because I knew beforehand about their whole history together and wasn't going to suffer bwen's presence on the server when literally the first thing he does is try to start shit.
Also the troll was someone named bwendin. They came in and started trying to get a reaction out of wfc so I gave wfc mod for 10 seconds so he could ban him.
So it's named ryoko-bot
I already made something like that but it was an account for the bot
where do the black submission titles even come from there?
A few...
If we get another person like that I'm gonna put the server into temporary lockdown mode.
I told him not to start shit and he referred to wfc as "mentally ill". Given the other shit I've known him to do, I'm just not gonna bother. I'm giving wfc illuminati for like 10 seconds and letting him ban bwen.
keep an eye on him and be strict
he's a troll. also wfc hates him.
Remember to re-enable the header rotation when you move it over to the main sub, we can make the halloween header pop up more often than other headers later on when it's not midnight.
Let's worry about CSS first
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
So not the "weekly discussion/salt/bragging thread is up, time to announce it" type thing we want?
New users are infrequent enough that it wouldn't spam too hard, especially if people actually start using the server more
I think, once we start work on the discord bot (which, take a look at the mee6 thing sodra posted if you haven't) I'll prepare a greetings channel in case we start getting users more regularly, but otherwise we can stick greetings in general
Good luck with your assignment
Good night <@456226577798135808>!
looks good!
ok it loads now

it looks like an unreachable website!
well, it still kinda cuts off with RES off, but i dont think there's a good way to fix that while maintaining the CSS
Everything looks good now
if you click it with res on things happen
are we leaving every second comment like this?
it does kind of cut off
wan wan pet me wan wan
why is it blue
wh
it's white instead of lime green but it works
works!
if it breaks just undo what you did
that's the point
it's a test subreddit
or do we need to wait for lyssa?
can you do the res thing too?
res thing it is
here in the sidebar too, should be white
<@456226577798135808> this text here is still black and hard to read
whered he pull the sidebar on the second one from?
dont confront him
guess we're digging him out the hard way after the 23rd
motherfucker, guess posted shit
she didn't have the little braid thing in her hair in GX
also wait elfnein changed appearance in AXZ?
by a lot
otherwise the sides will be cut off
can you make one thats more square
Since cape is still being included
Can you throw me a picture of The Cape?
I'll quickly throw that together and figure out how many rounds it'll take
Itaba and... the other two whose names I can't remember
Oh and then the 3 friends
Ryoko, Aoi, Sakuya gives us 3
We'd need 6 more characters to fill spots though
It'd be fitting with the new season having just ended
We could do a standard favorite character tournament style thing
Lyssa already has a script set up for automating threads so it'd just be a matter of modifying the script and implementing it on ryoko-bot
I guess we can just do the XDU salt threads for now if we don't think of anything fun that can be done using the forum format of reddit
We can do it another time, do you have any other ideas for things that wouldn't take an entire month to play out?
We may have to abandon survivor at this rate
black text should be easy, dunno if that shaded kirika green is a product of something else though
illegible black text in red boxes, random (and possibly unfixable) shaded kirika green in and around red oval
gimme a sec
looks a lot better. Just a few minor gripes left
this is now the terminology we use
like, it's lime green, kirika green, and shaded kirika green
that's the one we're calling kirika green, right?
the green that is between the two shades used in the background
lime green makes it hard to read the list of subs and blends in with the background
also you should probably use kirika green here <@456226577798135808>
yes

the green one is highlighted

Some stuff I'm finding on the nt subdomain
oh
know what i think this element can be changed on another theme
`nothing happened`
im using color, not background-color
oh
i dont think it's images it doesnt look like images
is it images?
REDDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT
`it's all images`
"<a title="Symphogear AXZ now airing!" href="https://www.reddit.com/" id="header-img-a"><img id="header-img" src="//b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/X1ipn-cBGOu5mbFXxyn6bCzPNb2daaVHo8qQZMb0dbA.png" width="100" height="100" alt="YuriGirl"></a>" where are we using the text "Symphogear AXZ now airing!"?
*looks at ul.tabmenu* where the fuck are you getting your color from
it's been a while since i did anything computer related. even if it's just CSS this feels refreshing to work with
I'm going to go through stuff and see if there's anything i can do
Okay, now that I have a basic idea of how this works
brb douching
IM HELPING
I DID A THING
i got it
oh wait
i tried both
how do i access that class
a.voteWeight is a RES thing
my fiddling around is at the bottom
<@456226577798135808> how do i modify an element like this? since it's a.voteWeight instead of div.voteWeight
i picked a hard thing to practice on
how do i modify this
no that didnt work
wait lemme try doing it myself
a.voteWeight should have color: black
just gotta put it in the css
yeah that fixes it
Solution: set that element to have black text. Right now it draws from whatever the defaut color is, which is lime green, which is bad.
First thing to take note of: here's the element itself
WAIT NO I HAVE A SOLUTION
so it's not like everything else where you're just changing a static color
the higher the voteweight is, the greener it gets
positive vote weights can look a bit weird with all the green but i think that's just an unavoidable consequence
Also we like, need to do a valentines layout for february. Hibimiku is too strong.
please do
I don't wanna keep just being like "R this is broken fix it"
Because like, what if we wanna do a Christmas layout for December
I'm gonna start practicing some CSS stuff myself so I can help too
I guess the next project regarding CSS would be to get everything neat and organized so that editing it in the future isn't a pain
so as long as you keep track of what you change there shouldn't be an issue
I mean, anything you do can just be undone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIJRAcVf5tY
the selector image is being used for the background instead of, well, the background
dunno if i have the other one, lemme look
the axzbgborder sprite is still solid gray on the t subdomain
top submission, on the right
sidebar has some white text
submission titles are black/black instead of blue/purple
the comment/share/save bits are still lime green
highlighting them still makes a green thing pop up
on the main page, submission backgrounds are white. should be transparent.
i think the halloween css is actually done now
ok done
ok nvm that looks bad
what code is kirika green
is it safe for me to make one more change?
alright, submission page is good with and without res
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/336299788792496129/365295622267469824/unknown.png
content.h1
previous CSS person
just need that one bit on the submission page sorted that i dont know how to edit because mech decided something was !important
ok, got the search page all sorted out
how do i edit hyperlink color again?
how's this look? should i use one of the darker greens?
blorp
im using color
oh
it should be limegreen with the change i made at the bottom of the css
div.searchpane.raisedbox
this element isn't changing
weird
<:Elfnein:336656417035517952>
also wow that's backwards, I'm the one who's supposed to be submitting
"submit to" is in black
<@456226577798135808> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/336299788792496129/365295622267469824/unknown.png
brb meds
oh this element should be green but i can fix that
I'd say either lime green with black lattering or shaded kirika green with lime green lettering
otherwise, ul.tabmenu should probably be green on the halloween css
I posted an image up earlier of some black text that needs fixing, lemme see if it's fixed
we just need to get the nt subdomain properly working and throw up the selectors
just a little more to go for the CSS
blame maullar
ass
your heart
wtf i can't // to comment in this
<@285555416056856576> wan wan are you able to help out with CSS now? I think I've changed what few things I can edit with some vague idea of what I'm doing
content.h1 has illegible black text that's being messed with in mech's CSS and I don't know how to change that
it looks bad but i did it
ok i did another thing
no that didnt help at all
im a fucking idiot i was making it black
also in tabs and has the !important tag so i'll let one of you look at it
oh this might be the issue
found some more black text but i cant figure out how to change it...
well, that's legacy stuff so i dont wanna touch it. we can clean up the CSS so that we know where everything is once the current theme is done
we could actually work faster if more than one of us could work at a time
i wish there was a way for 2 people to work on the css at once without constantly overwriting each other's work
still a few things to fix on the main page tho
understood!
some stuff will have to be renamed on the main sub then
so you did!
tell me when to refresh so i can start digging around at other pages
after that i think the only thing left is the proper axzbgborder but that can be easily done on the main sub. I think I like the black text on the submission buttons more so whatever on that change.
a.author.moderator.may-blank.id-t2_to5qxw should be white
888 here too?
yeah
dunno if that's a noticeable difference, looked off to me
ul.flat-list.buttons should have color: 888 instead of black
Ok, sidebar looks good except for the link colors which i dunno if it's worth changing them back
i was gonna make a note about how there's whitespace behind the submit buttons `but that's just there normally anyway`
.thing.stickied.link
#228822 to be exact
announcement posts shoud have green submission text <@285555416056856576>
ok images not being used have been deleted
I'm gonna do a bit of clean up until someone asks me to dig for things that need to be adjusted because im apparently good at that
ok backgroundNoTheme and axzbgbordernotheme are on the test sub
right we can do that
...right
it was the thing you replaced with the gray square
no i already threw that back on the test sub
uhhhh just post images here and ill know which one it is
6?
axzbgborder
<@456226577798135808> you have the other image, right?
im gonna delete some of the old unused images we have on there and throw in one of the two images we're missing
for... reasons?
as are other links in the sidebar
keywords and other resources are 0079d3
found it
hopefully if it's a problem we notice before anyone else does!
that's one solution
i dont know
with res
im seeing #0079d3
submission titles are <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
and the purple should be #551a8b
submission titles are #0000ff though
for usernames
<@285555416056856576> the blue you used is too light. #369;
or is it straightforward enough to just edit it when we move the changes over?
i have the old background already, should we fix that on the test sub first?
doing this while i dilate is hard
same for axzbgborder
but r replaced the normal background with he halloween background
it is the sidebar
oh, not only is it the same difference with the sidebar
it's actually probably fine leaving it at 369, that's the same difference with the sidebar
html[lang="nt"] div.md a {
    color: #369!important;
}

has been pinkified instead of set to the correct color
i'll fix that later
aaaaaa the background for the selector image isn't transparent this bugs me
(except the buttons are up now)
either way it looks like nothing changed
im not following. if they don't apply anymore wouldn't that mean you changed them?
wait you can delete them
lemme go through and figure out which ones don't apply anymore
oh, you got the links working
ill try and figure out what's what on that mess of green i screenshotted
bonus of doing this is im getting well acquainted with chrome's inspect tool
nini
and that's all of it
span.dropdown-title.lightdrop {
    color: #C1DFC4;
}

should be color: black
div.searchpane.raisedbox {
    background-color: #C1DFC4;
}

should be background color: #E0E0E0 i think
.roundfield {
    width: 500px;
    background-color: #18341C;
    border-radius: 4px;
    padding: 5px 10px 10px 10px;
    font-size: large;
    color: #c1dfc4;
}

should be background-color: #cee3f8 and color: black
and uh... yeah
span.dropdown-title.lightdrop {
    color: #C1DFC4;
}

should be color: gray I think
span#REScommentSubToggle.RESSubscriptionButton {
    background-color: #C1DFC4;
}

should be background-color: white
.res-commentNavToggle {
    color: #c1dfc4;
}

should be color: black
.panestack-title .title {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-weight: normal;
    margin: 10px 0;
    color: #c1dfc4;
    background-color: #001E03;
}

should be color: black and background-color: transparent
wait, no, it should be #0079d3 always
html[lang="nt"] div.md a {
    color: #369!important;
}

should be #0000FF when unvisited and #551A8B when visited
on it
Well, there's also 3 other pages to check and fix up on the nt subdomain
why is so much stuff !important
it is done!
ok yeah lime green. #C1DFC4
dont do that yet
wait i can change that locally to see how it looks
(also maybe try lime green for the reddit name instead of white that's a lot of contrast)
normal res does
spooky res has no problems with distinguished names on announcements posts
redditname fixed
res thing not fixed
should be white in halloween mode
all fixed, except the halloween css seems to have inherited the black text for the subreddit name on the sidebar
res makes everything so much more complicated
color: #FFFFFF is being overwritten there
.res-userHighlight .tagline .author.moderator, .res-userHighlight .crosspost-preview-tagline .author.moderator {
    color: #FFFFFF !important;
    font-weight: bold;
    padding: 0 2px 0 2px;
    border-radius: 3px;
    background-color: #228822 !important;
}
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AND THE POST IS DISTINGUISHED
EXCEPT IF YOU'RE USING RES
names should be green
well
ok every other link is blue except for clicked links which are green
and every other link is pink
ok so names on announcement posts are still green
OK WE'RE BACK
No internet
Ggxyfdhxfhduddd
Ok there we go
My router is down fuck
Still reconnecting to discord on my laptop
I lost power for a bit there
but it makes everything green
we only want the submission title to be green
is making too many things green
that whole bit
html[lang="nt"] .thing.stickied.link a {
    color: #282!important;
}
that's the only issue
it's actually 1 issue
oh here we go. ill play around with it in chrome and see what fixes that
but i dunno how i found that element to begin with
Ok issue 1) ul.flat-list.buttons for annoucement posts is green instead of 888 like every other u.flat-list.buttons. Gonna assume that's an issue with .thing.stickied.link reaching too far
and i will tell you what they are shortly
everything is mostly good. only two small problems I'm seeing
なんつってつちゃった
<@456226577798135808> I need a better picture of the cape. https://img.animebracket.com/23a1.jpg this is what it looks like in anime bracket since everything has to be square and on a black background
and then nex time we make huge edits it wont be a pain
i wanna make the test sub an exact copy of the main sub now that we have the halloween css up
and wait for lyssa before i do anything css related
I'll prepare the contest then
alright
While you're here though... can you make that serena banner we talked about earlier?
the bracket we're doing on the week of the 9th is as far as i wanna go with that
hibiki vs chris would be a shitshow
mmmmm thatd devolve quickly into waifuwars
shoot
on the subdomain, scores are always blue. They should be orange when upvoted and gray when not voted on. Blue when downvoted.
page dividers for RES's neverending reddit feature, should be lime green. and we should probably have an image for spoiler posts to begin with instead of using the default.
this code block mess
strikethrough and spoiler text here (strikethrough should be lime green and spoiler text I guess should be lime green background with shaded kirika green text)
there are some `things` we didn't properly test on the sandbox sub and I'm afraid to touch them myself due to how they would interact with the subdomain
gay night
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Oh, was the halloween header added to the rotation?
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
tell me when the halloween stuff is up on the main sub and then i'll make the announcement post
we can think more about it tomorrow
in any case, we're done for now, we just need to move it over to the main sub
wanna leave it selectable. at least until we add another seasonal css
i dont know about you but id feel pretty weird leaving the halloween css up year round
but we've got a month to do that leisurely
`and now we get to reverse all the subdomain stuff so that we can switch which one is displayed by default once october is over`
looks like we're done
ok that works
i need to see if it's the right color
distinguish one of your comments in the test thread
Good!
a, .tagline .submitter {
    color: #FFE1FC;
}

should be #0055df
ok what the fuck
(i should have said this initially)
yes
html[lang="nt"] .thing.stickied.link .title a {
    color: #282;
}

is still modifying the bit that says "self.YuriGirl" but that bit should be 888
1px solid #5F99CF
.content.submit .info-notice {
    background-color: #18341C;
    border: 1px solid #c1dfc4;
    padding: 9px;
    margin-bottom: 12px;
    font-size: larger;
}

should be background-color: #E4F2FB
whoop, found an element i missed
okay but where do we *put* those colors
you performed some sort of black magic here and i dont know what to look for
what is this hell
this is a mess
giojsgosijg
there's two backgrounds
ok no there's
lemme just go and test that
good news! the right color is white
what the fuck
.commentarea .comment .comment, .commentarea .comment .comment .comment .comment, .commentarea .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment, .commentarea .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment, .commentarea .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment, .commentarea .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment .comment {
    background: #0e413d!important;
}

uhhhhhhhhhhhhh i think this is the wrong color
yeah
im gonna try and dissect what's happening to comments
yep!
they both draw from the same color code
Also can we fix the eternally blue scores on the sub?
I explicitly do not want to use ryoko-bot as a mouthpiece. All of her actions should be obviously the actions of a bot
ryoko-bot would be good for posting automated threads periodically
Besides, seeing more than one mod active on the sub might help
Although I'd help set it up, I wouldn't want to be posting the threads or anything
If we do a contest, I'm pushing the duties on to you. I don't like being the figurehead.
Keep people in tune with the sub even when there isn't going to be a huge flood of content every day
Although I think focusing on getting the discord more active for off seasons would be a good idea.
What do you suggest? I'd honestly delegate role of "doing fun stuff" to you because I'm not that personable and I'm terrified of doing something for the community and then it turns out no one participates.
I suppose
Now that me and Lyssa aren't constantly gaying at each other we could get some CSS stuff done
I dunno how much work we'd be able to get done on the CSS while sitting next to each other
Alright. Tomorrow Lyssa's gonna be here so
Do we wanna work at all on the kirika CSS right now?
Obviously first priority is "make kirika layout more easily readable" but after that why not just make themes for every gear user?
Can we do all that?
3) Figure out how to make a list of alternate themes that isn't just a huge mess of images.
2) The default CSS is default. Always. We can have a list of alternate themes somewhere if people wanna browse with one on.
1) Eventually get a layout for each gear user. Something that fits their color pallette but isn't hard to read (and we may need to recruit testers for this to make sure we don't get blinded by "can versus should")
Alright, so: new plans regarding CSS that we can maybe do
with default being what the subreddit was to begin with
/r/gamegrumps has a theme selector on their subreddit, and while that only changes their banner, we can totally do the same thing and just list a bunch of different CSS layouts
(also maybe make seasonal themes as alternate styles always, so that way no one is forced into what we may have accidentally screwed up on)
but lets not give up!
yeah
If you look at the picture I posted earlier from the valkyrie discord, the contrast is a lot better
We got trapped in a "well we started with this so that's what we're ending with" situation
Not a bad idea, we just needed some better coloring (I liked it at least)
ok i did it
pray i dont fuck everything up
ok i think im confident enough to do this on the main sub
ok fixed that
it... should be fixed though i think? i dont get why it's not fixed
i think
i fixed everything except for the subreddit name
unless you're already working on it
so... lemme try something and then I'll revert it if i fuck up
i just took all the html[lang="nt"]  and put them on the other elements with the same name instead
Enough that the test sub is mostly set to default right now
(this is all on the test sub)
until we can rework it properly
swapping it so that the halloween theme is on the subdomain instead

gonna post screenshots of things i dont know what to do with
Let's go with that
For now though, that screenshot I posted has good contrast
Yeah
Alright. For now we should switch the domains since a lot of people seem to have issues with the kirika theme.
Let's work with what we have for now though
The stretched background on geno's is a bit concerning on different resolutions though. Although, yeah, it's good.
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/229596738615377920/366131032862490626/unknown.png this was also posted in the valkyrie server and I think I like the balance of colors here a bit more than what we have up
some people on the valkyrie sub had some issues with the subreddit CSS. <@285555416056856576> <@456226577798135808> can one of you make the background not tiled when you have the chance?
Found another element we missed. 

.usertext.border .usertext-body {
    background-color: #ffc;
    padding-left: 5px;
}

should be lime green
look at what happened to the sonic fandom
this can only end in tears
`national anthem plays`
Self-promotion and paid promotion are prohibited across the board

and

If your contribution to reddit consists mostly of submitting links to a site(s) that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way, and additionally if you do not participate in discussion, or reply to peoples questions, regardless of how many upvotes your submissions get, you are a spammer. If over 10% of your submissions and conversation are your own site/content/affiliate links, you're almost certainly a spammer.

and

If nobody's submitted a link like yours before, give it a shot. But don't flood the new queue; submit one or two times and see what happens.
just the healthy communities guidelines
doesn't violate content policy, nevermind
Mmm... "You also agree to follow the Reddit Content Policy. These guidelines are intended to keep people safe, protect kids, keep reddit running, and to encourage personal responsibility for what you do on reddit."
He isn't breaking rules
which are just that. guidelines.
the way he uses reddit isn't against the tos, it's his pile of subs that are in violation of community guidelines
there's not much to catch
well
He's been posting daily, which is annoying
I doubt they're involved enough to notice his position above mine. But I suppose we'll need time to monitor what effect bots have on the server, so we might as well remove him first
the only thing about him is that we need to not do both at the same time
soiguess is completely detached here
AXZ is over, so we're past the point of "if we wait any longer it'll be too late"
Perhaps it's best to get the bots online before taking any action in this regard
Well, in the interest of not burning bridges, I'd like to take the discussion to them at a point. We just have to figure out how to present it to them in a way that they won't go off the handle.
So it's not like we'd be losing the advertising. She'll still scream about symphogear.
Mm, looks like most of quinn's posting about symphogear on /r/anime doesn't involve mentioning the sub
I said not infrequently
The only other reason I'd wanna keep shit friendly is because Quinn posts to the sub not infrequently
They've stated that they don't plan on doing live rewatches like they did for the AXZ leadup. So my main motive for staying friendly with them is shot.
Basically I guess... how could we remove the valkyrie server without shooting ourselves in the foot concerning relations with them?
They'd need to get a group of people to raid the server, at which point, spam prevention
It's way more effort for one person to pester us constantly than it is for me to kick them out
Basically that's not as much a concern to me as the lack of activity here is
Rule 5 is there specifically for a "no bullshitting your way around the rules" purpose so they can't really be like "I wasn't technically breaking rules though!"
They're following the rules
If some moron shows up and "tricks" us by following all the rules then whatever
Well, that's the point. If someone decides to start making accouts just to annoy us we shut them out until they go away.
We have a spam prevention system in place, we just need a bot in order to use it
I banned bwen within minutes of him showing up and I've reprimanded kako a few times
I'm not afraid to drag someone for shitty conduct
Yes, that's why I haven't done it.
I'd love an excuse to remove the valkyrie server from the sidebar since they just leech users from us given our low activity.
encourages people to join and participate, play a game together, and hopefully stay around afterwards
Something like "gaming get together" but center it on the discord
So we could hold those from time to time
Discord events could be more loosely themed
Additionally, since it's a symphogear sub and not an xdu sub, I wouldn't necessarily want those kinds of threads cluttering everything up. The high amount of XDU content is expected and not an issue, just... I don't want AXZ stuff to be lost among a sea of "I GOT 11 5*S IN ONE ROLL"
No one's posting shit luck or good luck on the sub, so a thread specifically for that might encourage users to do so
Everything else has to be users acting on their own
There's not a whole lot to do as an admin for it beyond the bragging/salt threads
https://www.reddit.com/r/SchoolIdolFestival/ this is pretty much the extent of "mobage related sub"
No
I don't know how we'd be able to use it beyond the salt/bragging threads
Like, today
Well, they just released Fine as a playable unit
The salt/bragging threads would be good for this
We should also leverage the fact that XDU is popular and use that to increase sub and discord activity
suggestions though, don't go overboard
on that note, upvotes do turn orange, but maybe change them to match gear color more?
#c6c6c6 is the normal unvoted score, a darker gray might be better to mesh with your gear buttons
lemme check
lyssa what's your vote
I think I like portrait over silhouette
yeah that's not bad
That's
That's fine, just wanna get an idea of how it looks
The one Lyssa posted here should work, shouldn't it?
mmm... try it with a portrait style picture
go for it
(dl comes to mind but her commissions are closed, none of us actually know her, and would she even do it if we did?)
Unless we can get some symphogear artist to draw a really good portrait style picture
I think using official art might be best in this case
i mean, we can make her an emoji too
I don't see either scenario happening if we manage to get stuff rolling here, so let's just focus on getting stuff in order
Other reasons we'd want to maintain a relationship would be if we held other events like gaming nights, if they chose to throw out an announcement on their server that we're doing it and people should hop on over here, that would benefit us.
bingo already said that they don't want to do another live rewatch any time soon due to how much effort it is to get it running every day
especially since they don't seem interested in doing much collaborative stuff.
Option 2 is less "punish valkyrie server" and more "retain users as much as possible, maintaining a relationship with the valkyrie server isn't worth it"
Well if everyone joins this server, sees it's not active, and then decides to join the valkyrie server instead, that's just an endless loop of people never talking here and then leaving
1) They just start being massive assholes for no reason
2) We're losing like, 45%+ of our users to them as well as a good chunk of our active users (of note activity in <#336298054724485131> has gone down significantly since wfc moved to Japan and both somekako and synclyric joined the valkyrie server)
Not enough to take them off the sidebar, at least not right now. But it's there, and we should see how well we can combat it with simple things like the addition of bots.
results on that shit bingo gave me. It does look a bit like their server is leeching some users from us
didnt think that would work
i
nvm i forced it to show me 100
<@285555416056856576> can you do anything with the info bingo dropped in the group DM to get the 26 users that he refuses to show me? Because there are 40 people between the last user in the list I have and as far as I can search and there's no page 2
@ bingo's comment "this isn't data you're entitled to" yeah and you're not entitled to having your discord featured on our sub either
Like, sourcing takes time, but at the same time it's important?
I kind of want to add a rule about sourcing art when posting in the art channels but I also don't want to make image dumps impossible to do?
Ok bingo botched the database pull and is gonna redo it. So I'll get my data.
Meanwhile, bingo gives me a bullshit list of users that I can't get any meaningful info out of because of how innacurate it is

We can also iterate on the bot as we go, so all we *really* need to start with is a greeting function
Discord bot should come first in that case
games are a low effort and decent way of increasing activity, so running a regular game night or something where one of us coordinates a co-op game to play together could be useful and fun
And after that, activity just begets more activity.
We don't have the pre-existing activity yet, and we can't just generate it out of thin air, so we need to find a way to hook people into this discord immediately and create that pre-existing activity
If you look at the interserver chat, I had bingo give me some data and he'll give me a list of users that are active in their server but not ours so I can get a better handle on what causes a user to be active, other than pre-existing activity
Sooner they're up, sooner we can collect data, and also the sooner we can automate some level of interactivity.
Well, yeah. Part of why I want the bots running ASAP.
we hold a lot of power over them due to their reliance on the sub, and they know it
I'll send it from my alt
He's currently active
I'm gonna send him a PM asking him why he posts to cloudatcost so much when I'm done eating. Maybe he'll let something slip that incriminates him.
Can't use that against him
Why would reddit ban activity that encourages users to use reddit more?
promoting your own subs doesn't count as self-promotion
And paid promotion is outright forbidden
Less than 10% of your posts should be self-promotion
(or you can use here for testing)
I'll dump it under archived channels once the bot is launched
use <#365021915586363402> for testing right now
alright, new <#368973801561653253> made, only custodians can see it for now
I'm gonna change <#365021915586363402>'s name so that we can launch a proper welcome channel that isn't littered with old join messages
Logging here should be fine as long as we're the only ones who can access the logs
Could add extra layers to it too, ranging from verification required to a complete lockdown with no users being allowed in, although I doubt that'd be needed
Basically - under normal circumstances, Ryoko should be assigning the student role to everyone that joins the server. If some group of assholes decide to start spamming the server with their friends from another discord, we just type something like !spam here, and all of a sudden Ryoko stops handing out the student role automatically and starts asking questions
The command for that should only be usable from within this channel, so they have to be able to read messages sent here
You may have noticed the "Student" role I added a while ago. If we have to, I want a bot to be able to turn off the ability for the @everyone role to send messages and then require users to verify that they aren't blindly following a link from somewhere other than the sub in order to speak
the bot role can both read and send messages here, for future reference
"Welcome to the /r/Symphogear subreddit discord server, @<user>! Take a moment to look over what's posted in <#336297587802112011> and then have fun joining the rest of the server!"
one sec, dilating
This or portrait
I like it more than blue
This could work
kirishira is 45x40
so is your cape
horny miku and angry chris are both 74x40
with a few exceptions. the genjuurou one is 45x40
40x40
but no one else gets to have the cape so it's okay
with the exception of your cape i guess
if it's a flair i definitely want official art only
i'll take the 5 minutes or so it locks you out of changing your avatar to eat a thing
might work a bit better. throw it on to test
we fixed it at the same time
FIXED oh
that's 888
888
no it's
i cant find where it's getting that from because all instances of that color should be on the inaccessible subdomain
I tried to fix it and nothing happened
Yeah I know
(although to my knowledge, going in blind, it's better to watch the series before the movies?)
I'll also note if the anime is composed of shorts or something unique like how LWA was a movie first
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_b2hscLxGONzWoveLuRH8Yl3AlByL9hcNduMd8Hc260/edit?usp=sharing
Let's get a google doc going and have it free edit so we can just add to it as the list goes on
there you go R
Madoka - 1
Flip Flappers - 2
Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryouko - 1
Wakaba Girls - 1
Nyanko Days - 1
Oshiete Galko-chan - 1

Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru - 1
your shitposts are fucking quality and I'd prefer a small group of people who can properly enjoy art over a large group of people with a stick up their ass
I fucking love your shitposts it's one of the reasons I don't have the valkyrie server muted
If we need to we'll make an "R's shitposts" channel but just
Shitpost as much as you want
Please shitpost
R, I want to make one thing clear
I suppose. There's also the "why are there two discords" question that pops up from time to time. The only solution I see there is just making one more prominent than the other but I don't know if it's worth it
I figured labeling one as "subreddit discord" would be sufficient as well but I guess the giant "come join us" spanning the bottom implies "us" is included in the valkyrie server
SG-r03' Bwendin - 10/06/2017
It's a reddit discord(edited)
Not exactly unique
What are your thoughts?
<@285555416056856576> I brought this up with R before, but when I look at the combined sidebar image for the discords, it seems a bit confusing as to whether or not the valkyrie discord is or isn't affiliated with the subreddit. Hell, bwendin joining the valkyrie server and saying that it's a reddit server is testament to that. I wanna either have the combined image touched up to make it more clear that the valkyrie server is not us or just move them down into the Keywords and Other Resources section and touch that whole bit up at a later date
if he does, we just keep waiting until the conditions are right
if he doesn't post again in those 2 days, I start a modmail
after the 23rd, once he posts, we wait 2 days
oh
ARE YOU WITH RUFUS
There's a bots role ready to go as soon as she's running properly
We have one set up
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
We've had this discussion already you need to get surgery before it becomes a suggestion
I suppose I can't stop you when you can just sit on me and use my account to do it
Sadly to keep with naming scheme I went with HibikiGold
<:HibikiGold:370774300883419136>
kay
oh
Why haven't we deployed her
Oh
Get the basic greeting function working first I think
once 30 seconds pass with no picture, she sources everything at once
someone posts a picture, ryouko waits 30 seconds for another picture
have it on a delay
idea
oh
cant edit other people's posts
but how long would it take ryouko to put it in saucenao and post the result?
And also could that function be quick enough that she wouldn't be running several images behind
I wanna let artists be credited but at the same time I don't want to impede image dumps
Getting her running is first priority, but is it possible for Ryouko to grab a result from saucenao anytime an image is posted in one of the image channels?
wordy
It's kinda
https://www.polltab.com/BJbBehUp- does this look good for figuring out how long we should do the watchalongs?
R this was a good idea
it's polls all the way down
The poll after figuring out the next show to watch should then be a poll to figure out which ones will be in the next "what are we watching next" poll
Initial voting should be on everything suggested, and then when we near the end of a series, we put up a new poll with the top few suggestions from the previous poll
I think the first thing we need to figure out is 1) how many episodes are we going to watch per session and 2) will they all be the same anime or are we gonna watch multiple different shows each session
People should be able to vote on what to watch next whenever we get close to finishing a series
Also I don't think having a predetermined watch order is good
We can make a polltab with multiple selections allowed
It has a certain calibre of user, sure, but it's not as bad as 4chan itself
Because it's not actually a lawless hellhole unlike the thread itself
And I guess zoid's twitter? That seems less relevant
We could have like "Official Symphogear Subreddit Discord" at the top with a flashy image and then two smaller images below it linking to the Valkyrie discord and /sgg/
But I like the idea
Symphogi doesn't have the server publicly listed anywhere for a reason
Ok, so aside from anime watching, I wanna address that other thing about the sidebar you mentioned R - I'm 100% arranging them into 3 buttons BUT the 4chan button must explicitly be a link to the /sgg/ thread and not the discord
do you have an account?
use crunchyroll where possible
<@456226577798135808> it's changed again, we're watching Yuki Yuna is a Hero / Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru / YuYuYu now
Wait, are we not able to just stream whatever we want here?
Did you make the rabb.it account yet?
And the answer is Cross Ange
<@456226577798135808> Use polltab in the future for simple polling like with the "which anime are we watching?" question. It allows for you to force people to verify with a reddit account.
TIME FOR RANDOM.ORG
looks like it's between yuyuyu and cross ange
oh, the anime poll doesn't update automatically for me since i didn't make it
So we can all do it depending on who's available.
Should probably make a shared account
(I voted for cytube myself)
People voted for rabbit
Well if we start at 2 we won't end later than 3
<@456226577798135808> So, right now it's looking like we're gonna be watching 2 episodes of Madoka at 2 PM EST tomorrow on rabbit. I'll announce it in 2 hours to give people time to object to the start time, but otherwise I'm leaving it up to you to get the show ready and broadcast it given how late I wake up + my obligation to shove things inside of me every few hours. Do NOT post the link to the channel we're playing madoka in directly on the subreddit, simply tell people to join discord and I'll make a special channel for anime watching.
<:KirikaWhat:336657327325315084>
We should put OJ easter eggs in Ryouko and just wait for someone to find them
im gonna post like my entire desktop porn folder to test
so yeah lets see how well it keeps up with rapidfire image sending
ok i can totally do that
actually gonna test something right now
Tell me when it's working so I can image spam and see how well it keeps up
So I guess that's that question solved. Whenever an image is posted, just have Ryouko post the source immediately with pointy brackets to prevent the preview from showing
without pointy brackets: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX44CAz-JhU&list=RDMMckXMvrFlmKY&index=27
ok
oh
also testing the thing quinn said <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX44CAz-JhU&list=RDMMckXMvrFlmKY&index=27>
<@285555416056856576> make Ryouko post a link to a video

i have the best ideas
you put porn in the bot and she started working
see
`put porn in the bot`
are you testing the reverse image search function
http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1
post 1
probably just limit that to <#336297808221044736> considering what danbooru classifies as "safe"
oh! another function we could give her in the art channels is booru lookups
draw 3 cards
If she outputs text here on leave then we can get notifications for it easily
any time someone leaves the server she can post a message here too so we can keep tabs on that
any time a post is pinned on the sub, have the bot link it in <#336300750248476693>?
art sourcing
greetings
but uhhhhhhhhhhhh
any time someone says 3 random words give her a chance to say "<3 random words> would be a good name for a band"
just code bucket bot from scratch
just join on a dummy account
Alright <@456226577798135808>, you have a mission. Find as many Symphogear shitpost videos as you can and link them here. I've got symphover and Hibiki's new mixtape so far
which is why im trying it right now with NXD
You still have 2 shoes
But also bad news
Also good news
I legit cried
Like she'd just gotten back from Tougou telling her the Hard Facts and then she goes home and checks voice mails and all in that moment you can feel the reality of the situation hit her like a ton of bricks
That was hard bereaved sobbing
Like that wasn't your normal wimpy anime cry
Fuu's VA really sold it on that scene
Nothing in it was really yuyuyu levels of "Fuu is crying IM CRYING"
But
I haven't seen Madoka proper yet, only the first two movies
YuYuYu hit me hard
...you know, I meant the "May contain existential horror" as a joke on the channel's name but since we're watching YuYuYu...

No, I meant for CR
THAT WAS A TEST THOSE ARE HER KINKS NOT MINE
http://caffeccino.tumblr.com/post/166122839151/kittyccino-and-quantums-foxgirl-are-having-a-nice
http://caffeccino.tumblr.com/post/166008381391/happy-birthday-madoka-3-after-a-little
Okay yeah her blog is flagged as 18+. Doesn't seem worth the effort to do that for more than just pixiv though (where the source itself can be NSFW rather than just being surrounded by NSFW things)
And I think tumblr lets you mark your blog as nsfw anyway now
I guess in that case if you can rely on tags for pixiv you can rely on tags for tumblr
Most artists have a SFW tumblr and a NSFW tumblr but a select few just mash it all together and just rely on tags
HER tumblr is NSFW, but not all tumblrs are NSFW
That only leaves the question of like, what if it's one of caffeccino's drawings, and the source is obviously her tumblr.
(we can also tack the R-18 detection on to the normal sourcing function for when users post art in the channel directly)
And I'd wager there are more people who don't realize that danbooru has a source button than there are people who won't take note of a Source (NSFW):
We can't completely idiotproof the system.
If it's clearly tagged that the source is nsfw, fault is on the user
Yeah
The issue isn't that the source might preview porn, the issue is that the bot might post a SFW image in <#336297674707828747> and then a user will click the NSFW source and all of a sudden they're looking at porn at work
280 characters tho
Source: https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=41368986 half porn
SFW image
http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1744105?tags=hiiragi_natsume
So like, for instance
What do we do about posts that would be safe to post in <#336297674707828747> but have a nsfw source?
Which means only link directly to sources we know for a fact work, like twitter or all ages pixiv posts
So the answer is no, don't trust it
Do we trust that any source link on a danbooru post is going to lead to an image and not a 403?
https://i.pximg.net/img-original/img/2013/10/09/00/10/34/39003562_p0.jpg
Like pixiv
Do we classify "anything that ends in an image file extension" as verified, or no because of sites that block hotlinking?
sounds good
If not, we post the danbooru link and have the source posted with no previews?
We just post the source
If the source is verified to properly show previews
Ok, so
I think the link
Wait what does elfnein do
Ok so just linking is fine
(deletes it from wherever she downloads it to, not from the server)
and adds the source with no preview
what if ryouko just downloads the picture, posts it directly, and then deletes it
wait
And links the source simultaneously
That will always show the image you want
http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1521585?tags=hiiragi_natsume
Source: <http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=39003562>
Basically when someone searches with ryouko the resulting message should look like
of course
http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=41368986
Source link iiiiiis
http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1744133?tags=finger_in_mouth+tachibana_hibiki_%28symphogear%29
Let's find out!
So either way it should always be:
`[danbooru link]
Source: <[pixiv link]>`
And also those albums sometimes being nsfw
Oh, but then there's an issue with some sfw posts being contained in albums
For <#336297674707828747> we could just post the source directly, and then for <#336297808221044736> we could post the danbooru link with a source: <pixiv link> with `<>` around the pixiv link to prevent it from generating two previews.
hmmmmmmm
throw colors at it
i can just
Had that thought on my mind too
i think i liked the solid color more
how's that


i see
ah
why white
why

oh the bottom layer still has white in it whoops
...which since it's on a white background you can't tell a god damn thing about it
how's
got it
How would I separate the background out to be its own layer to do that?
Make the background transparent?
but the border helps it a lot
Maybe a different background color for the sub


if i can make a fucking border on this laptop god
http://media-Hearth.cursecdn.com/audio/card-sounds/sound/VO_EX1_091_Play_01.ogg
Mm... needs a border

....but if we take my background version from earlier
or how it overlaps with some stuff like with Maria's head here
I'm a bit worried about how it might look wrt contrast on some of the banners
Or maybe in place of the hibiki heads or the bg image...
how's this look?

Testing something...
The more I stare at the golden hibiki icon for the discord the more I love it.
Just you wait for when it's time to test the autosourcer function
I wanna send him random ghost notifications
...once we're done making Ryouko do all the things we want her to do, can we code her to automatically delete any message consisting of just "<@456226577798135808>" in <#336300750248476693>?
Tempted to now ping that guy in every single announcement for getting upset about me making an announcement without pinging anyone
nvm fixed it
I broke the subreddit help
So is it safe to give her the Bots role and open up the welcome channel?
Just to make sure it's a fresh channel when we open it up
I deleted the test message
I'm making that pun when we add the function
autoscorer? autosourcer.
What about the auto-sourcer
Anything else that needs testing?
It works!
Just tell me when to try again
Ok that works
of course she does
wait
Does she also have send permissions here?
Or are we still conducting tests?
Is she ready to go out into the world?
That seems like a simple thing to do so I'd like to knock it out before we redesign the sidebar links
Reordering the sidebar should also help, which, on that note: <@456226577798135808> can you play around with the hibiki on the orange bordered background and see what you can come up with that looks good?
That's actually one quit I anticipated and if we weren't drawing in users for the watch groups I'd be more concerned about it

So we have 3 weeks of guest passes to use. <@285555416056856576> when did you get your last pass?
I dunno if codes are given out on a schedule out if it's just every time your subscription is renewed but I got one yesterday and I can activate a free trial on the account from my email

Alright, shared CR account:
Username: SymphogearSub
Password: Sunstone123
Also Lelly has never spoken here so whatever if she leaves
also lets R broadcast things from crunchyroll
<@285555416056856576> what do you think about this? good idea, unnecessary worrying?
Which at some point might be a problem if some asshole wanted to report us
So between me and Lyssa, we have 2 crunchyroll guest passes every 30 days. That, combined with the /r/anime guest pass thread, we could theoretically have a shared crunchyroll account  for watch groups and avoid having our crunchyroll usernames pop up at the top of every stream.
<:PharaDance:336657302914596866>
we *might as well* spam porn here just to make sure
well i mean
oh, do you need me to test the autosourcer
woof
There's also the matter of redesigning the sidebar so we can move the link to the /sgg/ thread over there and rearrange buttons to make ourselves stand out more, but we can think about that later
Anyway R, if you think it could use some extra editing before we swap it out, I'll let you do that when you have time
<:Elfnein:336656417035517952>
<@285555416056856576> lyssaaaaaaaaa
uhhhh where did ryouko go
But we can still change the inner hibiki
I like having it in the square, actually. If it's not up against a background it's liable to get lost in the action with any banners we have/add in the future
background image for the sub?
better how?
no flimsy flopsy if you wants or doesn't matter to mes
Should I go swap the images for real in the css?
This is us now. This golden Hibiki represents us.

crisp
clean
nice
am i being jojo'd
Should be centered on the canvas
alright <@456226577798135808>, your turn. I can't overlay this properly. Set the width to 610 and then figure out how to line it up.
I'm having trouble properly sizing the original hibiki to fit over the messed up hibiki
Or do we go further?
Do we use this?
i think the lighter one is better yeah


anyway still think the orange needs to be lighter in that screenshot over the chris banner?
I'll try but it might be easier to go back in and draw over the messed up bits
i've resized the hibiki though

Gimme a bit, eating
some of the shiny bits seem to have gotten a bit messed up through all my editing so im gonna need R to do a quick clean up of whatever color we settle on
good enough contrast?

what hex is the orange on the gx cd cover
better question
what hex is the current orange
there are no references to %%logo%% anywhere in the CSS
in fact
i did
no update
replaced it with the new image and gave it the same name
i deleted the old image
what
i
time to fuck something up
_fires up the CSS_
So we're sticking in the hibiki sticker?
both out then, since we wanna move the 4chan one to the sidebar
<@456226577798135808> you too what are your thoughts
but how do any of those last few images look to you?
or rather, i do know where the image is, but I can't edit it
i dont know where the image is
the logo is put in the sheet all fuckily and i can't edit it
but it also seems kinda blank with both links removed
i dont like having the twitter link just floating there
maybe
alright here it is
ill just go edit those out
(keep in mind we're moving the stuff above the logo to the sidebar soon)
how ist das
time to refresh for chris banner
FOUND IT
relative to what
why the fuck is it positioned relatively though
i dunno how to move it around
it's positioned relatively
`this is beyond my skill level`
#header-image has attribute position:relative
But I don't know how to fuck with position
If I could figure out how to reposition it I could make it bigger and just show you
<@285555416056856576> did you ever look at the hibiki sticker mockup
at least not when i add it locally
y= does nothing
but also, I think it's kinda cool how she's kinda standing on the edge of banner like this
0,0 is top left isn't it?
wouldn't it need to be a negative integer?
y=""?
I don't know how to tell it to do that
<@285555416056856576> any opinions on this?
Do we wanna stick that in CSS instead of the old image or continue working on it?
bit better. I made her bigger too
at least this shade
I think black on orange is better than white on orange
Focusing more on the colors - I think we still need a black border to ensure she doesn't get lost in the action on banners like Chris's
Of course if we put her into the CSS properly we can always just tweak things around and make it better
better, but still kinda just floating there
no you made it 473x473
I'm assuming that's still a 610 width hibiki on a 707 width canvas
if you snip some of that out she'll be bigger
and it's resizing the full thing - transparency included
it's because the image on the sub is resized
I'm just using the full image from the link discord generates and sticking it in the css locally
`also she's kinda small`
without a border of some kind she's liable to be lost in orange heavy banners
Looks weird without a border and borders don't work well with discord icons
nah
wonder if we should also make the discord icon on the orange bg...
make it the coolerest
yeah
I meant
living lyssas are good
"I was waiting for soiguessthisisit's response before saying anything, but since they haven't, I'll just say that I don't really understand why we should be operating under someone who's simply not here and has not a single investment of this place beyond owning it."
gimme a bit and ill string them together for you
Go for it, but preface it with my suggestion from a few days ago
<@456226577798135808> <@285555416056856576> So, it's been a week since I made the modmail, and 3 days since guess has posted last. Now is a good time to put in your thoughts, then I'll wait a few days and make my case to the admins.
Something to the effect of "I was waiting for soiguessthisisit's response before saying anything, but since they haven't..."
So, soiguessthisisit *has* been active on Reddit in the past few days, but hasn't replied to the modmail. Once 2 days have passed since they've said anything, I'd like it if you commented on the modmail I sent out.
wh
So that the reddit admins can see it
Once a week is up just throw in your comment on the situation
S5 or not
Although I want to do one this coming year.
We can't do a rewatch right now. It's too soon.
We need constant involvement (which is why I wanna get Geno on board ASAP)
XDU kinda sucks, so we don't draw in many members from that (although we used to and it's still the most active channel)
Symphogear isn't airing, so we can't draw in new members on that
The issue is that people aren't going to hang around a dead server for a watch group that happens once a week
<@456226577798135808> So, given how few people showed up to the last watch group (zero) I'm wondering if it's a thing that's going to be worth going out of our way to schedule
pinning the link

You can wait a bit and see if they respond
I'm not trying to be a puppetmaster here
Your thoughts?
If we can get them to leave peacefully that'd be great
also try not to make it look like we're ganging up on them
https://mod.reddit.com/mail/new/28hsl <@456226577798135808> <@285555416056856576> pls respond

It's been 2 days since they last posted publicly
Okay, well
And if we do, do we wanna take care of soiguessthisisit first?
Most of us have shit we need to do, but R did mention bringing Geno in the other day and I've talked about it with her a bit and should we?
The last anime group didn't turn out so well, so I think we definitely need to make sure the discord or the sub are actually active
<@285555416056856576> <@456226577798135808> okay so now that Lyssa is home and I've had time to recover from her departure, let's talk `~activity~`

FIXED
im trying but i cant hit the save button
lyssa how do i fix this
laughing too hard
lyssa pls fix
OH GOD
There's nothing they can gain from passively observing this server
move your bait to headcanons btw
superiority complex
harassing others
harassing me
you dont need to bait them out. theyll make themselves known
no

Shouldn't be
If candytoys#0484 shows up ban them immediately.
Alt of ACK
Who is someone else entirely. They probably don't even exist as Akemi anymore.
Who is actually Akemi
Because I joined that server Symphogi linked in the group chat and that means I'm Symphogi apparently
Blocked him on three accounts
Dont mind me just executing a *coerced* removal because he won't stop fucking harassing me
This is a good idea!
Not yet.
If it gets to be too much we can just ban them normally
If they start frothing at the mouth, I'll put the special role on them and then we can laugh as they make a fool of themselves
If they don't say anything, there's no reason to ban
https://twitter.com/zoid9000/status/908243053390860288
So - anonanon is apparently an alt of crack-kun. Treat them the same as you would any other user, but keep that information in mind if they start going on a tirade about crack pairings. Also I will be making a special containment role in the event that they earn themselves a ban. We won't exile them from the server, we'll just confine them to the fancontent and art channels and let them writhe in agony as users post crack pairings.
nop
No. It'll be a bit, since I'm PMing the reddit admins and they have other shit to do as well
You can read all of their criteria in that message
They specfically ask for "what do you foresee..." ie, what do you think could happen


We should play a couple test rounds amongst ourselves to ensure the cards are actually funny in play
and of course we're playing this with the server
But lets focus on the sidebar redesign first
The only way we'd lose the main is through their actions
On the back up, sure
We can make a backup but we'd only need to keep it maintained for emergencies
No way. Ours has the best url possible.
I'm not expecting any response on soiguess any time soon, so I guess... let's go ahead and change up the sidebar links anyway? Geno is gone, and she was the only mod who used Reddit anyway. Quinn might care but in the end, I don't think she alone will figure out that soiguess is remarkably incompetent.
i have starbound
shove em in <#389113078450749440> <@285555416056856576>

yes. but lyssa has to do the actual moving
It's not the Wrong who actually does talk from time to time so /shrug
Should I remove the "traps are gay" image in <#384870333620027403>? <@456226577798135808> <@285555416056856576>
weird
ok its just desktop
i dont see it
Huh. Discord removed the from: function from search
still waiting
nope
h3xist seems to be safe. A user by the same name posted on the sub.
no avatar, gibberish name
they make a point of having no online presence. their accounts are know and any alts will be easily identified
If they're gonna go to extreme lengths just to lurk let them.
If I'm their target, then they already know my Twitter
But we need something to fill the gap.
If you don't want them OR /sgg/ there at all, then fine. I'll remove both.
They can be there if they ask, but not in the current form
I do not want the valkyrie discord to have equal space with us
Here is what I want. I want people to google "symphogear discord" click that top link, and then follow the obvious discord link
And to replace https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/VGV_jKxdtRCJrWfWQzozNzmIpRTxc1bumQ44tEOyjgA.png
What I want to do is remove this image from the side bar https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/CHiT1CkdVdnr9YwWwm4zQqAYkSr1jEYVNizTjvjAqi0.png
I'll put it in the sidebar. Right down at the bottom with the rest of the resources, or in the header replacing zoid's twitter link.
But there's no community on that website, it's just a link to the discord.
In fact, he does.
He certainly can.
Nothing, and I also don't care if he does.
They're squatting.
There's no way to find the Valkyrie discord other than browsing Reddit, but they are not the sub discord.
People will find /r/symphogear because people browse Reddit
People will find /sgg/ because people browse 4chan
The answer is whether it can garner users without being linked on the sub or not.
If there was a valkyrie sub, I'd link to the sub.
And I've given the answer. /sgg/ is its own community, Valkyrie is a server that is only linked on our subreddit.
And why are we even talking about them?
Then what is the grounds to remove them?
Or have you in the past?
Do you browse /sgg/?
Valkyrie has a giant "COME JOIN US" beneath it
/sgg/ is not implied to be affiliated with us.
And then they can link to the discord through that community
If they start up their own community other than the discord, I'll link to that community
They're only linked through us. That is why they're not getting the same treatment as /sgg/
Then let them.
People only find the valkyrie server through us.
Further, /sgg/ is its own community. People find it through means other than us.
They are.
/sgg/ isn't a discord server, nor is it placed alongside our discord server.
"Because there is no active collaboration between the valkyrie server and the symphogear subreddit, and because we do not want to endorse the kind of discourse that goes down on that server"
And the sidebar is not a submission, and does not follow submission guidelines
The subreddit discord is related to the symphogear subreddit
...yes?
If they're going "hey join this discord" that's not directly related to Symphogear
If they have a Symphogear watchalong hosted on their server I'd be glad to let them post the link
Symphogear communities aren't Symphogear
Do we need to address that?
I already removed it, but I'd rather remove it with a better rule to back it up.
Which prevents stuff like that random asshole calling out Lynx publicly
So, my take, is that we could have a rule that says "All submissions must be either directly related to Symphogear itself, or to the Symphogear subreddit"
I would want a rule of some sort, particularly since https://www.reddit.com/r/Symphogear/comments/7rv3l9/i_see_you_buddy/ happened and I'd like a rule that stops people from dragging their petty arguments onto the sub, but I don't think R's rule is quite the rule we need
<@285555416056856576> Thoughts on this? My main concern is we'd be adding a "no talking about third parties" rule right before or right after we're looking to remove valkyrie from the sidebar, and that's bound to raise questions we don't want to answer.
R, can you propose your initial rule for that?
When we remove the Valkyrie discord from the sidebar, it'd be good to have a rule in place to stop people from scumming up the sub with posts about the valkyrie server
For Lyssa, who missed the earlier conversation I had with R
So
<@456226577798135808> <@285555416056856576> Ok new rule time
<@285555416056856576> she didnt have read permissions so she wasnt actually in the channel
I'd like it if each discord's respective rule page were enough to tell users what's going on
no fun allowed zone
I also don't wanna paint the sub discord as like
I dunno. I'd prefer minimalism here.
Piracy and sourcing in particular
Well the discord rules are already a bit different from the sub rules
The bigger issue is how it'd look with a horizontal skew
They need to be more descriptive
And if they arent
The labels on the banners themselves should be descriptive enough
I don't think a description is needed that much. And if we need one we could put it in alt-text ~~even though no one would ever see it~~
With maybe a 4th non-link banner between Hibiki and Chris that reads "Other Communities"
Hibiki's banner would be a bit bigger and separated from Chris and Tsubasa
Hibiki at the top with a link that says "Subreddit Discord", Chris in the middle with a link that says "Valkyrie Community" and Tsubasa at the bottom with a link that says "/sgg/ thread"
Well, my initial idea is designing the links like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvAw0a3A4Vw&t=30s this part of the G opening
Alright. So is that a vote for redesign or a vote for do nothing?
And I do have ideas for it if we go that route
Redesigning has come up in the past, for the record
I gave brief points on removing/redesigning them
Also agreed
100% OJ is made by a group. It's also made by 2 people.
Same issue. What counts as a group?
Then talk about it later
Well we aren't going to get very far without a third voice
I'm against that. <@285555416056856576> thoughts?
Figure out what we're going to do first
I'm not gonna talk about how they react right now.
Of course, do nothing is also an option for everything
Valkyrie link: Remove or make less prominent/redesign. Reasons: Don't want their community so heavily associated with ours, would like to promote faster growth of the discord.

/sgg/ link: Remove or redesign. Reasons: More difficult to assume /sgg/ and the sub are linked beyond a common interest for Symphogear. Still not a community I'm fond of.

Anticipated reactions for removal of Valkyrie link: ???

Actions to pre-empt said reactions: ???
Ok, wrote down some basic thoughts on the sidebar stuff. <@285555416056856576>  <@456226577798135808>
2-1
The match is done but my opponent won't stop bugging me because they got disconnected during game 3
I'll write stuff out later
Let me focus on the match
I've abandoned that entirely already
I have a match in 15 minutes. I'm going to go do that, and then try and organize my thoughts on all of this.
I don't have strong feelings for it, but I don't want to remove it under the guise of "no third party groups"
We can also remove /sgg/
And, yes, part of the issue is just that the valkyrie discord has a high volume of shitty users on it, and I don't want to be the vector that people are exposed to it by
Dunno. I don't look at the valkyrie discord, but I do get pinged occasionally because people think that's the main subreddit discord.
The specific problem is people looking for a symphogear discord, finding the sub, and then clicking on the Valkyrie discord and associating it with the sub
Then why bother with a rule that targets them?
That rule, in any form, is going to have them throwing a fit. We either need to be reactive or have a different rule.
*but I'm still not making a rule that says "no third party websites" because that's not very well disguised*
Ok. We'll slap a link to the #symphogear tag on tumblr in place of /sgg/, remove the valkyrie server, and be done with it
Keep in mind, you are the only person out of us 3 capable of graphic design unless Lyssa has skills I don't know about
I guess we could take "keywords and other resources" and move it up?
Which is why I made them slanted in the first place
That messes up the aesthetic of using the G opening bit tho
They are both under other communities
Also Other Communities will obviously have an image of Ver, from that one scene where he gets freaked out after carrying Nephilim's heart like a baby and then Hibiki shows up.
(couldn't fit "valkyrie community" fully in there with how small i made them)
How would something like this work
But ideally an actual redesign would be nice imo
Anyway, I do want to do SOMETHING even if that something is just "remove the 'come join us!' label beneath the current banners"
That one dude who made the callout post for Lynx's tweet is exactly the kind of shit I want to prevent before it happens
In any case, I'm less concerned with losing people and more concerned with people assuming that Valkyrie conduct is acceptable on the sub when S5 rolls around. The redesign fixes that problem.
Activity begets activity. We can moderate people who are being edgy and show those who are truly hopeless the door
At least two people have dropped this server for the other, which is not a lot, but it's more than none
We've had people join here, be active, then join the other server, be active there, then leave here
We have lost members, yes
People can be banned and filters can be put in place to avoid alt bullshit
Do we care about hostility at that point
If they demand more then we pull it out from under them
The point of the redesign is they won't be angry or spiteful
He did
It avoids Quinn complaining
As for why we would want to
1 is valid but is just as easily remedied with the current solution, 2 has no substantial evidence, 3 is a nonfactor in my eyes
Do we have a justifiable reason to cut them off for good?
Anyway, I guess that's it for now. I need to shower and do Stuff.
Which the banners accomplish by default
We just need to make it clear that they're not us
Clearly valkyrie has failed to do that, but that's their problem
I guess... I don't wanna have the banners be cluttered with text, and I also want the rules channel to be able to speak for itself.
I guess "strictly enforced" is what I'm not liking here
We actually have less rules than valkyrie, we just enforce them more often
It's common practice to put things right in the sidebar. Wiki usage is for more in depth articles.
/r/ptcgo lists all of its links in the sidebar
Or at least I think it's confusing
That's not a "I don't like them" reason, it's a "our current sidebar image is very confusing" reason
I specifically want there to be a clearer line between "subreddit related" and "linked on the subreddit".
It's hard for me to search that since `your username is literally R` but he's not wrong. But, all of this seems like personal issues with the server. Again, we're not here to impose our will on others.
Well, lay em out, because "burying them" only gets the exact reaction you don't want
What are you hung up on?
Ok, but I was convinced that a straight removal isn't the best option right now.
Why, exactly, do you want to hide the valkyrie server?
R, at this point it seems like you're just operating off of a personal grudge. We're here to foster a community, not impose our will on others.
If the top image is just a plain link to our discord, and then the next two images are on-hover elements that just reveal more images (which are links elsewhere) it may be difficult to figure out that you're supposed to click the images that appear on hover
Realization: image links appearing on hover might be a bit confusing to users
Besides, it'd feel clunky and invoke a feeling of "why aren't these just listed in the sidebar"
We have no other page to link to
And then they need to not disappear when you try to mouse over them
So if you hover over "Other Communities", then two more images for /sgg/ and Valkyrie Community pop up
I don't want to use the wiki for this
If we go that route though, we need links to show on hover
k
...in fact that's why I drew it
I've already drawn the first thingy
Well
`you are volunteering for extra work`
In any case, if you're agreeing to do this, and then also suggesting extra things
:|
issues back
changed it to a reddit wiki link
no i didnt touch it until i noticed the bug
okay the issue is gone with the twitter link
i changed it to link to twitter instead and now it's just gone
yeah what the fuck is going on there
when I click it, it disappears
...im having a weird issue with the tsubasa link actually <@456226577798135808>
and then any others that crop up and want to be listed
The other communities link would go to another wiki page listing 4chan and valkyrie for now
how's it look + comments? (also the notepad on tsubasa will be changed to a silhouette of a paint palette)
https://www.reddit.com/r/YuriGirl/ we have redesigned the sidebar a bit
second thing
alright
Think we should do it?
Thoughts?
R wants to make a list of content creators hosted on the sub's wiki for people who want their name listed in a bid to get more people interested in submitting their own content voluntarily rather than needing to repost it ourselves. This would involve an announcement saying it's there and the page would look something like <https://www.reddit.com/r/Symphogear/wiki/content-creators>
Ok
hang on ive turned on hebrew mode accidentally
are you there
<@285555416056856576> i have things! to say!

That being said, Serizawa is annoying at best and disruptive at worst, and I don't want them pushing other discussion out
Nor do I want to make it against the rules
How do we handle complaints of "this user is an idiot" when said user is not explicitly violating any rules? <@285555416056856576> <@456226577798135808>
im gonna remove/edit the spoiler flairs because no one ever uses them properly and I've not seen a single post that actually needs them
i wanted to see it in big size
<:HibikiEdge:407398049531559937>
no imagge links there iirc
but not an image
oh its still there
sun mode / moon mode
it was there dark mode
oh they removed it
for moon mode
they do
they have images that do things
check the css for pokemon
dropped out for a reason
dilator in
starting dilation brb
2) Same issue
1) Hibiki disappeared
lets get everything with the sidebar sorted out now and if subreddit participation goes up we can start prepping for april fools next year
and it'd only be one day of spam
If our current efforts to increase participation pay off and we had more users,  it would be fun
We could play it like we're picking up radio signals going between SONG and stuff
R, you like telling stories, right? What if for April Fools, we started the day off with a "There is no April Fools joke" post. Then like, an hour later, we get a post in character about the show. Slowly, over the course of the day, we edit the CSS and keep making in character posts until we've got a breakout of noise on the sub and characters are just making posts trying to keep them under control.
`and that includes April 1`
which means people will be looking at the sub in April
but XV airs in April next year
random thought not connected to anything here
So
is it currently in place?
it's really dumb
so images have to be hacked in
the sidebar uses reddit's markdown language
i was checking things on the old halloween layout
do you know how to fix it?
do google or discord links ever have the clicked property thingy?
wait
but why doesn't it happen for other
same thing
set it to /r/hearthstone
happens with any reddit link
can you see it?
<:GarieSmug:336657120433012736>
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
also autosourcing is first priority imo
are you testing a command or are you sending these manually
shes sentient
yeah, those will be tucked under other links, like this https://www.reddit.com/r/symphogear/wiki/other-links
I'm still 100% gunning for SONG terminal CSS
...whenever reddit is back up i guess
opinions on the sidebar's redesign?
<@285555416056856576> can you take a look at the sidebar in r/yurigirl now? With bingo's response, we'll probably compress it further so that Chris's button encompasses both links to valkyrie/sgg and the current "Keywords and Other Resources" section
is line eating my messages or are you busy
<@285555416056856576> paging cute girl
we definitely need a CSS rewrite some time
i think it was a combination of things
no :after
point is, it works
and added a few other things
also removed a few other things
it's now

it still disappears...
im on board with that
on-click just put another tsubasa
bt then come bck
she go away
CLICK AND HOLD TSUBASA
IMPROVEMENT
is it this fucking simple
oh mmy god
i lied, the blizzard network is images
2b) If they say no, go forward with our own wiki
2a) If they say yes, go forward with our own wiki
1) Ask wikia if they want in
here is what i propose:
and? theyd do our work for us that way
Except we'd control the domain
I'll do it soon as I'm done dilating
No, and there's no harm in asking
Pessimism isn't my style
What about "hey we're building a new wiki because wikia sucks, wanna help?"
We can reevaluate after asking them
Won't know until we ask
Which is why I want to bring wikis staff into this. Give them a shinier playground and we get to put whatever banners we want in on it
At the same time, people are lazy. I expect maybe one or two people to help out excluding ourselves
xdu wiki fell apart because there was no help maintaining it. Ours would suffer the same fate without contributors
Ok, initial concerns:
- Potential community split, making the fanbase even more splintered
- No contributors, effort put into something no one uses

Potential solutions:
- Work with wikia folks to migrate to our own wiki

Your points: 
- Wikia is a bad, bloated, horrible platform riddled with problems, stigma, and unprofessionalism masquerading as a valid wiki platform.
- The people contributing to the wikia are bad at what they do outside of copy/pasting plot synopsis and keywords.
- The established article and organization system of that specific wikia is vague and muddied at worst and hard to navigate and digest at best, with poor visual design.
- The work going into collaborating and fixing their issues is outweighed by the work of making our own, with people we already know and resources we have at hand already.
- The goal our the subreddit/discord is to work with our own standards, which was the founding point of making the discord to begin with. Working with them on this is counterintuitive to this goal.

Responses to each concern: 
- Very valid, however does not necessarily exclude wikia staff from migrating to our wiki
- The only solution here is heavier moderation, wikis are free to edit
- Valid. Can be easily fixed in multiple ways
- Covered by bringing wikia on board with us
- Again, I'm not proposing to stick with wikia
dont forget your personal laptop this time! or the dildo
wh
It's not about getting people to come here for xdu, it's about getting the ones who do to participate in the rest of the community
That's completely separate from finding ways to get people who join here for xdu content to stick around for other content as well.
re: what Sparkle just said about being united. The people who post in <#336298054724485131> are fairly isolated from the rest of the server and we should probably find ways to make it more attractive to people who come here for xdu to explore the rest of the server.
it's still pretty dead just not entirely dead
so was the symphogear sub until recently
yep
you may even recognize one of those users
There's a reason we were watching it for DDAC before the entire concept got dropped
Yeah, there is a heavy overlap between yuyuyu and symphogear
No
You'll get a broader variety of shows but still ones with strong hooks for Symphogear fans
That's why I said use the Tuesday thread
Unsurprisingly, shows similar to a show with a niche demographic ALSO have niche demographics
PM those subs
Then just take all of the suggestions you get
Right now anime has the Friday thread up, but you can go there on Tuesday, post "I wanna watch a new series but don't know what to watch. Any suggestions? I really like Symphogear, Nanoha, and YuYuYu." or something like that
there'll be a dropdown to choose where the PM comes from
You're better at talking to people than I am, just hit the button that says "message the moderators" on each sub's page and make sure you send the PM from /r/symphogear instead of /u/vectorman
Nanoha too.
Well yuyuyu is a good start. Similar fanbases with lots of overlap.
Could specifically seek out subs that already have a list
Sounds reasonable, and a bunch of other subs do it already as well
So that we're boosting our own visibility until we can get it all hosted on our own wiki properly
I think our best option right in this moment is to get in touch with Hibiki and put links to the reddit and our discord on the wikia
It's not an immediate solution, but whatever wiki we move to is ideally our forever wiki, since we don't wanna give users a *second* wiki move.
I just asked her if it's an option if she finds a suitable platform and time to do it and she said yes.
Our own domain is a good thing to have, even if it extends the move by a few months.
If Lyssa's server is at all an option, that's the option I want. Just because no one has uncovered anything shitty about shoutwiki yet doesn't mean they won't.
don't go talking about it yet though
It's a move no matter how you look at it. We'll rewrite some articles but the goal is to make wikia irrelevant and us the go to source. That's a move.
Even just those that participate passively by reading articles once in a while
Additional to note: wikia contributors aren't the only people we're targeting. We need *everyone* on board.

Yuri Girl - Yesterday at 11:56 PM
When you shifted everything from wikia onto thwiki did you get any substantial negative feedback?
Mami - Yesterday at 11:57 PM
Nope, none
I don't remember anything negative at all, at least until a good couple years later when the Fairies were put up, but that was pretty minor
March 30, 2018
Mami - Today at 12:00 AM
Most of the rest of the issues were the usual wiki stuff
Edit and content disagreements
In fact people were pretty vocally happy not to have Wikia's awful theme and advertisements
Yuri Girl - Today at 12:01 AM
Alright, cool. Planning a similar move for Symphogear and wanna be prepared for people being pissed off about a new wiki being forced on them.
Mami - Today at 12:01 AM
Oops
Is your community in complete agreement with the move?
Yuri Girl - Today at 12:01 AM
Hasn't been presented yet.
Mami - Today at 12:02 AM
Ahhh
Having that is absolutely important
Lol
And keeping any sort of noise of a move away from Wikia itself, because they'll de-op anyone on that wiki immediately
Yuri Girl - Today at 12:03 AM
Do you know anything about shoutwiki particularly as a "forever" option? Because we could theoretically use sola's server to host it, but she'd need to find a platform for it she'd be comfortable running and also she'd have to find time to do it, so shoutwiki is just the easy and quick option right now.
Mami - Today at 12:03 AM
Shoutwiki may be okay
Thwiki is running on Linode
Yeah, and I think they're okay with site moves off
Also having your own domain is a really good idea
Just make sure all the other community sites involved all point to the new wiki, that'll help with search engine results```
since asking them doesn't hurt, I say we ask
they're active users who would maintain our wiki, without worrying about getting our users involved
<@285555416056856576> wan wan there are things said here to look at
I'm not opposed but <@285555416056856576> is the one hosting the bot
Just remember: trap and retard are slurs, and don't go hard on someone for a first offense unless they're being unapologetically antagonistic or spamming nigger or something like that.
Alright
...well, autoscorer can't ban anyway
Namely the whole "banning anime trash for being trash" thing
I'm fine with you being a moderator, as long as you think the issues you've stated before aren't a factor anymore.
Yeah, okay, but we need moderators is what I'm getting at, since Lyssa can't really dedicate her time to moderating a discord and you've explicitly declined doing so
The server is starting to move at a pace that I can't quite keep up with
wait what was reposted?
honestly? that'd seem more genuine coming from you
how do i do this without directly advertising
well just notify me when to speak up
k
<@456226577798135808>
can we do that over the course of today?
how quickly do you think we can adlib that here, on the server?
<@456226577798135808> hey remember the "slowly being overrun by noise" thing i mentioned earlier?
Personally I'm not a huge fan of April Fools jokes unless they're elaborate
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Anyway, on another topic, did you message Hibiki about advertising on the wikia yet? Or are you gonna do that later?
As long as we keep the REST of the community civil and not shunning xdu players like valkyrie does, we can afford to have some people isolating themselves
So probably not worth the effort
So you're saying there's no fixable problem, if there is one at all
since fancontent is already listed there
i guess under rooms
where in rules should I drop it do you think?
<@456226577798135808> it's been a week since we posted the content-creators table and I wanna move the information to an easier to notice location. Should I pin it in fancontent or add it to rules-and-information do you think?
I guess. I dunno, it might become an issue in the future, so it's probably good to plan for it while working on community outreach in other areas.
and we need images
it needs work
but
all said, the redesign doesn't look BAD

Todo list:
New subreddit icon
Higher res upvotes/downvotes
CSS
the upvote and downvote icons are a bit too small for the redesign
i think we need a different icon to make up for how small that is
zooooooooooooooms in on tiny hibiki icon in header
enable the emojis
go for it
besides, css can have emojis
i dont think
not custom ones
oh wait here i can
but i cant
so i'd love to add sprites for upvotes and downvotes
there's no CSS yet
I'll get some stuff started up since I don't need CSS to do a lot of this
okay SOME things on the redesign are nice
thats neat i guess
also hey i can just add the discord to the top there
left side of screen, at the top of the sub card, should say mod tools
on old or new?
okay this part of the subreddit is only used for reporting so i can safely fuck with it...
i have to break parts of the old design to get the new design looking up to par
simultaneously
make the redesign AND the old design work
fucking
i cant
hopefully a lot
i'll do what i can
get a headstart on the easy stuff
it's all user friendly bullshit for now, no CSS
<@456226577798135808> okay, so you wanna get started doing as much as we can to make the new design look at least kind of good?
yes?
I'll update rules to make <#407060923078017026>'s role more apparent and mention the guidelines informally I guess
just let it be
seven lines of injokes
long form RP would definitely count as high volume for me, but like
if people wanna start RPing in other channels let them, and if it seems like they're going for a while without other people showing interest, ask them to move
BUT RP doesn't have to be confined there
I'm personally of the opinion that if something goes on for long enough, yes, move to live-shitposting
Nothing was going on as is, so no discussion was being silenced
*anyway* the "discussion" that was going on prior to that was "hey I found Kirika socks I'm gonna ping Sparkle" and then Kirika joined shortly before Sparkle's comment and I pinged her and it went from there
Just saying it before I have to
I get that, and I'm not scolding you for it
if neither of us are around feel free to temporarily enforce something though
(also before creating new rules, please get either me or lyssa involved since while your input is valid and needed, ultimately your role is to enforce rules rather than to create them. it's probably a bad time for that right now since both of us are physically in the same location but otherwise one of us will probably be able to respond)
spontaneous RP tends to be short and branches off of a discussion that's already going on without necessarily silencing it
shitposting as I view it is mostly for high volume or image dense faffery that would drown out discussion in other channels
But also I'm not entirely sure that it belongs in shitposting because the low volume of it wouldn't necessarily disrupt anything
Yeah if we were going to implement one I'd want to poll how many people would actually participate first
I think the best answer is "just run two bots to avoid complications" <@285555416056856576> <@456226577798135808>
already did
<@285555416056856576>
maybe just pin a reminder on to the bottom of the psa that trap and retard are in fact considered slurs on the server?
we don't need to tell the trans people not to use it, they already know
the psa should preempt the need to tell people not to use the word
the problem is the way you've worded it, someone uses the word trap, thinks "is there anyone who might be offended by this" and comes to the conclusion that, no, there isn't, because to them it isn't a slur
yes
yes, but then again, I'm not saying trap
and trap is the biggest issue on the discord
the wording also doesn't give people a reason to not say trap, since the people who it would be an issue with likely aren't aware that the word is an issue to begin with
i.e. most slurs are banned outright unless you're discussing the word itself. white people slurs are only banned when directed at someone else.
cracker is another one. slurs that hurt white people's feelings aren't banned *unless they're using them in an otherwise bannable fashion*
they're in the common vernacular so they just kind of slide
ableist language is the biggest culprit there because it's hard to enforce "you're not allowed to say dumb, idiot, or stupid"
I don't like the PSA's wording of `"Is what I'm about to say potentially offensive to somene, including myself?"` because honestly there are a lot of potentially offensive words or phrases that AREN'T "stop this now" material
Because he's allowed to apologize and offer reasoning. He's on *exceptionally* thin ice and honestly just throw a ban at him if he kinda pisses you off on a bad day.
Wien isn't banned either, but he's on a hell of a lot more thin ice than Rukia is
kk
I wanna see it first since the issue kind of exploded in general
anyway your name's blue. What's the PSA you were going to post?
at the very least, if you wont send them a link back, just leave them with a "you know how to rejoin"

Also: Rukia is not banned yet (despite what I'm about to show you). Rukia may come back and then have the "this isn't an issue for debate" thing calmly explained to them via DMs. If they're aggressive or decide to soap box, ban.
and also, send them a link back to the discord when you kick them. not everyone has reddit open 24/7
I'll trust your judgment on those
Or just some jackass coming in to harass people, ban that too
If it's a legitimate huge problem, just ban right out
I'll promote you to Illuminati, BUT hold off on banning too quickly. Standard protocol should be kick, tell them to come back later, kick again if they show back up immediately while warning them that the next one is a ban, and then ban if they do that.
Some people need to be told it's not a point of debate. Of course they need to just accept that in those cases.
Wien honestly should have been kicked before even being restricted
Alright, so the issue I'm having is that my initial explanation on why femboy is okay and shemale is not is that I wasn't terribly descriptive, so I DO feel like Rukia was deserving of a second, better explanation. They got that, but kept going, and should have been kicked there (which is when you started calling for it). So I didn't kick readily enough.
wait until im done
wait on that
okay, let me just look through when stuff was said. less talking at the moment would help so i can actually comb through things.
you have a point. let me clean up and I'll look back through the logs and time stamps and everything.
As for why I promoted you to autoscorer instead of illuminati, you said yourself to me that you have an itchy trigger finger on that kind of thing, and additionally I do think you were calling for Rukia's removal a bit too readily here
those don't get deleted
Ryoko has logs if we need them, however
For deleting things, yes, I'll start leaving stuff up
if someone wants to clear something up, they should be given the chance, and they should also be given the chance to have it explained why their argument is wrong. I explained it twice, and that was too many, but explaining it once and entertaining follow up questions is not bad as far as I'm concerned.
wien was out quickly though
i should've kicked Rukia a bit earlier, but i don't agree with how early you wanted them kicked.
<@456226577798135808>
Shoot
Just to be able to properly address things without chat scrolling too fast
I'd want slowmode at the very least
Muting a channel for 3 seconds to make sure people hear you when you remind them to stay civil isn't exactly a problem.
We can work on adding mute and slowmode options to Ryouko to make it easier to take the floor and say something.
When the discussions go bad is when you remind them that they are the user and you are the mod.
Discussions need to be possible or else people lose faith in us thinking we're silencing them.
Can we try and convey that without saying "it's not up for debate" going forward?
And spoilers are less of an issue to push than slurs.
<@456226577798135808> I'd like to point out that people ARE allowed to discuss things. Just make sure that their discussion is civil and not rule-breaking.
Yeah. We keep having the conversation but we never reach an answer.
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
wan
just a thought i had
no
i wondered if sakimori would want a soecial title for meming and then just pinged their role
alright
my current reasoning for not being listed is that they cant actually do anything and it just gets cluttered otherwise
why should or shouldnt they be listed
but what about the pics role
which make sense to be listed
every other listed role is either a mod role or bots
i have yamete listed because they can make anouncements
what merits people with special roles being listed separately or not
<@456226577798135808>
we must consult
council
<@285555416056856576> can you give a list of reasons that relying on a two bot solution for the server would be bad?
alright you have the field
Lemme just make my own announcement first and then you put yours up
Or some other variation on the sentence I added, your choice
PSA should be ```PSA for the community: Remember that Rule 1 is one of the most principle rules here, and always use your common sense. Make sure to ask yourself, "Is what I'm about to say potentially offensive to somene, including myself?" If so, please use your better judgement, and don't say it. Likewise, if you find someone says something offensive that hasn't been acknowledged, always know the mods are here to listen and make sure its handled. Also, casual reminder that both trap and retard ARE considered slurs on this server. Thanks for reading!```
im probably going to play mutiny once im done dilating
what can kirichan do right now?
i have priorities pinned
yes
Mod colors should always overwrite "Best girl" colors but we can just make autoscorer a really bright green if you want
Anyway, despite the rainbow vomit issue, I feel it would be a bit lessened by making them self-assigned roles and also picking from a pre-defined set of colors would help.
Anyone with <@&336302034070536192> can see this channel

<@456226577798135808> add me to whatever conversation you're having with Sakimori please
So, two (or more) bots it is in that case
oh
What is this addressing
No objections from me
(also is there any way that I can access her logs)
<@285555416056856576> Can you still run Ryouko for the stuff she does now at least?
From me at least
Yes
It'd be nice to have for spam protection but not absolutely necessary
I suppose we can get away with just a lower rank for the bots role to make sure that Sakimori doesn't effectively have the Illuminati role, but it doesn't solve the question of channel perms... but I guess none of the things I mentioned except for server games would even need that.
Alright
In that case, we don't have to give Sakimori every single perm that Illuminati has
<@285555416056856576> Can you still run Ryouko and just push things that Sakimori makes on to Ryouko?
And... most of those require the ability to manage roles or channels
I'd say self-assigned roles > autosourcing > spam protection > funsies > server games > automod
And two of those are already implemented
As for functionalities?

Autosourcing
Self-assigned roles
Spam protection through use of roles
Logs
Greetings/Departures
Fun commands
Server games through use of roles
Automod maybe?

That's not in any specific order, just things being listed off
I'd be fine if it were one of us - I can do whatever I want and R already has manage roles anyway - but we were going to ask Sakimori to do bot stuff and I don't know if I want to give him those perms
That would mean giving whoever takes Ryouko's role over access to the manage roles and manage channels perms
Also I can't help but notice that neither of you have Mutiny!!...
*wags tail*
<@285555416056856576> botssssssssssssss
Well deadline to have them mailed is in like 4 days
did you order your ticket yet
also are we going to otakon
What ate your time today
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690> <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690> <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690> <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690> <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690> <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
<@285555416056856576> nyanyanyanyanyanyanya
and a default role for spam protection and for temp mutes etc
I might want to add opt-in favorite character roles as a feature of ryouko eventually
Right now the server is small enough that most people know each other, but it becomes a problem as the server grows.
The rainbow vomit issue is only an issue among active users to begin with, so that doesn't make a difference at all. Rainbow vomit is an issue in that, one person says something, they have a colorful name, are they a mod or not?
gimme a list of hexes and ill set those up
oh, i can implement girl roles though. no one will see that until i announce it.
so i can pay more attention and make announcements
id prefer finishing madoka first
well, actually
we can rename roles right now though
i wanna do it all at once, because i wanna remove legacy colors at the same time that we recolor the mod roles
We haven't really had an autoscorer before and bots have bot next to their name anyway
We can definitely rename autoscorer and bots
Kiri alt + old autoscorer looks the best I think
The teal looks good, how's the other option look? And both combined?
Too similar, especially on light theme. How about with neon green for autoscorer?
This is good.
her character color is silver though i guess
i'd put more blue in maria too
we can just have two shades of orange
and yeah, im prepared to renounce my purple
I said main girls
<@!102691114762371072> Missing Miku and Kanade, and maybe Serena
yes
what do i do
ok im ready to pull triggers <@!102691114762371072>
`its secret`
no
i have... puns in store for that
yeah
sending the link would be ideal
why do you need it?
how's my current custodian color
Post whatever yoi need to in <#448237561085952001>
Next step is the channel, I can make that
fuck
Current list of things to do in order:
Set up roles
Set up self assignments
Set up self assignment channel
Uncolor legacy roles
Change mod colors
Roll out changes
Yes but wait for me to let you know I'm actually ready for it
we could do that
and bot-commands can become bot-testing
I'll make a new bot-commands channel then
set up the bot, clear out the history from bot-commands, make a post explaining how to assign roles, and then make the reaction post
overwatch because it's popular, xdu because it's symphogear, and anime club because it's social
so lets set it with just overwatch, xdu, and anime club for now
ask
like
we can always just
yeah
but otherwise i'd stick to co-op games and stuff
xdu gets special treatment there because of the nature of the server
who wants to be pinged for kancolle?
they're different. The issue is, having the role means you'd want to be pinged for the role
xdu gets a pass because it's a symphogear server
fgo could be a role but i dunno how useful it'd be
what games have we seen people mention playing on the server so far?
yeah
I'd want to avoid broad categories for interest roles
like, someone could love neptunia but hate final fantasy
we kinda need to predict what would be popular
anime club, overwatch, xdu, uhhhhhhhh
And avoid using global pings
Still, I'd like roles like "anime club" or "overwatch" so people could be easily pinged with information they want to see
And reactions could get cluttered
I'd rather command, I want more than just best girl roles implemented
yeah but i didnt realize manage roles included creating roles
i thought you need manage server
oh i didnt realize you could add roles with the manage roles perm
okay it automutes you, good
<@!102691114762371072> can you try connecting to the music channel with both you and kiri?
...`cape`
For Ryouko, that's not a huge challenge according to Lyssa (just needs dev time). For nadeko, no clue.
next up is auto-sourcing
yeah that con is why i didn't say to have it immediately
do we want color overrides in case someone has multiple best girls or wants a different color?
quick make the announcement
don't global ping tho
Alright, do the announcement
oh you changed it while i wasnt looking
You should probably explain what the reaction message *does*
on a delay so that people can still see the confirmation that kirichan gave them the role
can we also auto-delete non-command messages?
there should be
and the explanations
i'll pin the reaction post
add explanation of dess_iamn and put up the reaction post
anyway, tell me when you're done setting up <#448237561085952001>
too close to shirabe/chris though
sacrifices must be made
but
i like purple
also i guess im yellow now
no
symphogear is too colorful
finding a good color for custodian is hard
you can see role-assignment now
Mmm... it might be worth asking bingo how noisebot functions
But they could give a command if they want a specific song, either one that's stored or something from youtube
Well, I'd like it if, at any point, someone could just join the channel and kirichan would start playing music without needing a command
and then let people insert their songs into the queue
Ideally we could have a constant loop of Symphogear music going like Valkyrie has
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
I'll bug Lyssa about options in like a week
what happened there
kk
where did kiri go
I should probably make an afk channel too
set up music-commands and tell me when to release it
👌
yeah it's private while we set it up if it needs any setting up
Alright
Can we work on getting music commands set up in <#447132690349555712>
im back
OKAY SO
you have to mute manually
i cant enforce perms on you
lyssa
DC, Aug 10-12
<@285555416056856576> should i buy an otakon ticket for you or just me
also we're piss because the miku role had to be purple
peace???
I feel... not hungry, which is somewhat alarming because I'm undereating right now
gonna start dilating but i'll still be able to hear stuff
yeah
ok i noticed that
she isnt in here
uhhhh lemme find a louder song
sure
It's currently 15 minutes
And, if so, what should I set the AFK timer to be so that people don't join the channel and go to sleep and waste bandwidth
Now can you make her be constantly in a voice channel and play a playlist on loop, but pause if no one's there to hear it?
oh
what did you do
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
i wanna add you to the symphogear admin chat
accept my friend request real quick
i'd just say, don't spend any money on anything just yet
so do we, but it's Lyssa's so we need to ask her if it's reasonable and she's been working nonstop these past couple of days and we finally managed to get an answer on "should we bring in saki" and i don't wanna bug her more
bingo has a server
yeah
i wanna see if the afk channel actually works
saki can you idle in general until you go afk once stuff is done?
and we auto clear role-assignment regularly to make it easy to use
if we merged music-commands into music it'd bury a lot of stuff
we need <#447995991438786564> so we can do bot maintenance without bugging about in public channels
That'd be fine
stole the idea from valkyrie tbh
done!
uhhh how do i do that
yeah ive been watching it
worked that time
<@!102691114762371072> kirichan kinda just aborted halfway through a song
and also, if you get it running, i know someone who'd probably like to run that functionality as well
anyway, `now it's time for pirates` in a bit at least
yeah just search "saucenao in: the-submarine" and you should see it
There should be an old discussion about it here...
Whenever someone embeds an image in the art channels, it does a lookup on saucenao for the image, then it spits out whatever the first link is
That was the idea with Ryouko
So... work on autosourcing tomorrow?
I mean, I was actively urging you to not spend any money to begin with
seems like it's going smoother
Also, once we have things figured out, would we be able to host kirichan on your server Lyssa? Or would music be too much.
progress!
"you can do it in python"
that's a lead i guess
ryouko runs on python though so
probably busy if the last week has been anything to go by
Lyssa might have insight but she's either ded or busy
and those are the important steps
i dunno how to robot magic the middle two steps though
paste it into discord with `<>`
grab result with robot magic
paste it into saucenao with robot magic
take url from discord
we've already had this discussion concerning ryouko, it just never happened because lyssa is in a perpetual hell
make sure the output has `<>` surrounding it to prevent thumbnails from doubleposting
but low similarity (as defined by saucenao) will rarely be a match
saucenao will almost always give you a result
A) searches saucenao
B) If ONLY LOW SIMILARITY RESULTS, no output
C) art channels only
having anime pictures posted
given that it's an anime discord
i think saucenao is all we need
google reverse and... does tineye still exist?
also, make sure it doesn't output anything if it can't find a proper source
that works, but saucenao will almost always find pixiv links
and so both can be done with an autosourcer
autosourcing is the solution I had to "people will want to art dump, but I also want artists to be credited"
Don't need bots randomly popping up in other channels - especially hieroglyphs - and being all THAT PICTURE CAME FROM
I'd prefer if you only checked those two
really wanna get that done
but also >autosourcing
but yeah shit like snail race is cool as long as people are just doing it for funsies and not because they're gambling addicts
Which limits how much currency you can get
Either a mod would have to host it or someone would have to spend currency to host it themselves
Which is why I mentioned hosted games
I don't want people to be able to just spam currency
We'd need a way to generate currency though
betting on events in S5 would be too hard to track
but that also works
i was just thinking of giving the winning team currency
But yeah, not yet
we could enable currency at a later point if we were to ever add more complex games that require a host. Stuff like Mafia would work with magic role fuckery.
oh, the logs wouldn't be saved on a disk?
hum. a question for Lyssa then.
could we import ryouko's logs to kirichan?
not much reason to keep ryouko in that case, but lets wait until after shirabe is ready
and checks for departures
ryouko keeps logs
ill make the pun somehow
"we tried playing with kirichan's autoscorer features, but accidentally set the configuration to autosourcer instead!"
i wouldve loved if an existing bot was getting this feature
it should be fine for now
i expect that to be a problem only if rukia does a massive dump
so not every image would get searched anyway
a lot of what gets posted is twitter links
that sounds like enough
like the fucking election
ESPECIALLY when parts of ls1 seemed so inconsequential
i missed parts of ls1 and normally id be fine with that if they didnt build on that same story for hot
fuck the recap
and tbh i want them to pour resources into a real ls1 solution
but i also need to finish ls2
ok
id get pof but i havent even played through hot and dont have all of ls3
dess_search_pofupgrade
but staff perms were more restrictive
now that you're here i switched it to staff perms
when i set it up i just locked everything and manually input R's perms
yeah
ok there you go
nearly everything is locked in this channel
you never had those perms
rekt
rekt
oh thatd be it
we could test with ryouko but lyssa is ded
well she has the exact same perms as you do right now
oh
i take your silence as an answer
<@!102691114762371072> try speaking
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
rekt
chris doesn't dess
she should be able to post here
uhhhhhhhhhh
i dont give a shit about pork really it's nice but i dont need it
more fish
i need more tofu
i didnt
i think the best chicken dish was the one with the chickpea pasta and did you know you can turn chickpeas into flour
its not like they're having trouble moving the stuff im sure 90% of people with bland ass taste doing meal plans love chicken
but they send me so much fucking chicken
chicken is boring
i dont like chicken
i need more variety in my protein sources
ive had chicken and beef and a tiny bit of pork and tofu this week
the restaurant is literally named FISH
they have good fish
maybe i can order from the Mediterranean place
but im thinking about fish
or sleeping
i should probably be writing for my game
im just gonna order a shitton of sushi grade salmon for one of my cheat days next week
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa why do the sushi places near me suck i literally live in a port
i hope you are enjoying me in "mindlessly type my thoughts as they come" mode
tbh there are worse hills to die on but that's mostly because if you dont have food you die
thats not good
oh
(i did not know mackerel was a warm water fish)
(i had to look this up)
both native to florida
both good fish
or snapper
what is the risk level of merely suggesting mackerel
so wait, you go shopping but your parents dictate what gets bought?
but im running low on milk...
from spain
i have spanish mackerel
i like mackerel
mackerel also has a pretty distinctive flavor but it's more subtle
salmon is like the "what the fuck am i doing" fish because it retains its flavor even if you fuck up
mackerel is good
<@456226577798135808> you could probably get mackerel cheaper than salmon where you live
but im in new york so we actually have the things living here
i dont like cooked salmon very much but raw salmon is tasty
<@456226577798135808> do you get to go shopping for food you could probably pick out something cheaper than salmon
trout is good
buy trout instead
it's overpriced, overfished, bad for the environment, shit fish
dont buy tilapia
also tilapia tastes like nothing
when prepared properly most fish have a very unique flavor
lots of people complain that fish taste the same and that! isn't! true!
you can find them on the east coast if you go up enough but we have things like swordfish more on the pacific side
salmon are on the west coast, particularly in the more northern regions
wouldn't something local be cheaper
you live in florida where the fuck do you get salmon
salmony
it's too
salmon is okay but i do not like it in soup very much
i want red snapper in a spicy broth
ok
give me fish
GIVE ME FISH
FUCK CHICKEN
wtf ive been on this meal plan for a week now and not one single meal was fish
i want fish soup...
lyssa did say the function was going to be simple enough, so I'm not surprised it's going easily
i was afraid that was kiri leaving
impress me
but if lyssa doesn't poke her head in here earlier i can ask in like, a week or two
the only issue is that ryouko's logs are incredibly hard to get to right now since the only person who can access them is always busy
ryouko stays in that case. I don't wanna rely on searching discord to get logs, they get deleted after 6 months
rekt
just box
MAGIC
oh
brb buying you mutiny so you can escape from real life with horse cock
do you get a laptop while away
wait R whens your compulsory vacation
lupiesoft makes the gay games i need in my life
but are the girls kissing each other
want gay
i just
everyone is playing gfl or fgo or granblue or feh
your situation will get better soon i hope and then you can make your grand escape and take on a new name and write a hit broadway play and makes lods of emone
just fucking slams his hand on my head fuck you dad
without consent
my mom thought i hated physical contact for years until she realized i just hated when my dad touched me
i like food
and eat more
and look at food
eat
that sounds lame you should come to new york sometime and we'll do all the fun stuff like
i dont like the beach that much but maybe ill change this summer since i have a fucking vagina finally
im terrified of fursuits
i think those costumes are why im not a furry
but also my family isnt shit
my family used to go to a place called rocking horse ranch every year (which is apparently still in business) and it was awesome except for the people in horrifying full body costumes and also the horses
<@285555416056856576> when are we going to Boston to tell George that Mima is dead
or is it a weekend
hahaha im gone one of those two weeks and i have no clue which it is
or something large that we should debate over who exactly makes the announcement
you are, in general, allowed to make announcements on your own as long as it's not like "i took a dump bye"
also whats the announcement
and that gets the job done when im trying to lose weight
they're pretty good. the food is bland mostly but it's satiating
metabolic meals
protein shakes are a scam btw they're impossible to mix properly
less fucking chicken
more beef
lemme start dilating and then i can give you specifics on the spam protection stuff (which can double as a replacement for the restricted role which is absolutely meaningless as is)
alright
We can implement spam protection after that, it'd be a bit more involved
Ok. I'd say continue rolling out additional sources on Shirabe and then enable Kirichan's funsies type stuff
shirabe is on the same server as kiri?
its neat
im excited too
Oh
if we blacklist danbooru, gelbooru, konachan, and yandere, that there is most rehosting sites
I'd probably just say blacklist a handful of sites instead of needing to individually whitelist every single possible source
Danbooru is not fine though
Can we expand shirabe to source other links as well? Twitter and deviantart and whatever else comes up are fine as long as the similarity checks out.
okay
because i was gonna make a dumb joke
are you going to make an announcement
okay hag on
<@!102691114762371072>
lemme finish cleaning
<@431656503490117632>
What are your thoughts, kiri?
i fell asleep because of moth bondage
that's ryouko's startup message
It really is an elegant solution to a common problem
yeah
Like, you could be all "but then why don't they ask for the source" and the answer is that people are fucking weird
But if there is a source? Artist gets a new follower.
If someone sees a picture they really like, but there's no source, they stop at that picture
sharing unsourced art with someone privately is one thing but when you're sharing to 100+ people at once, you really need to source it because people rarely ask for the source
overall people seem to like it though, which is good, because the function is good
I was expecting at least one person to complain about Shirabe's functions. And of course it's the one person who keeps posting het porn.
...we should probably add a karaoke role, but I'd wanna ring that in with an actual karaoke session to host
sakimori is the tech inclined one not in this relationship
i have no clue, you're the tech inclined one in this relationship. I was just wondering if I could read through them during times that you're busy
yeah
<@285555416056856576> is there any way we could have access to ryouko's logs?
every server has a nadeko and now every server can have a shirabe too
develop shirabe a bit more and you could honestly put her out as another bot. I don't think autosourcing is packaged with any other bot yet
im excited as hell
the rest can be added whenever its covenient
autosourcing was the last "we really should probably have this" type thing
yeah thats fine
if they come in amd act an ass we just boot them normally
basically, i want restricted access to stop people from being disruptive if the user is normally non-disruptive
as long as we can stop potential raids and make restricted access mean something im good
we could add to it
but it doesnt really do anything
restricted access is already the timeout role
that'd stem any spam waves we might get
and, if necessary, we could set a command so kiri stops handing the role out automatically
can do everything we already do with restricted access and more
If you start acting up, you lose the role for a bit
Full Access would give the same perms that everyone currently does
my idea is a default role given to everyone who joins the server. The role can be called Full Access or just ♪ I don't know which I'd prefer
It's more of a "you've been bad, feel bad about it" role than anything else
Restricted, right now, keeps you out of a handful of channels which, big deal.




votes on kick, ban, or stay





I'm DMing. If Rukia brings it into the server that's a kick or ban depending on how severely it is brought in.
I guess I'll just DM them
I honestly don't know how to handle this one. hieroglyphs is typically not very strictly moderated, but Rukia is posting the same thing that they've been in shit for before
:/
I deleted it. In general, bad shit in hieroglyphs should just be removed with a warning sent in DMs if deemed necessary, but Rukia making a trap joke *again* is
Oh! <@!102691114762371072> as a placeholder for sources that aren't formatted in a way that Shirabe can make a proper response to, you can have her say "Okay, I've got a likely source, but I'm having trouble reading it. The work is located here:" or something like that
the entire thing isn't a completely perfect solution: unsourceable images ideally shouldn't be posted at all, but I don't want Shirabe removing unsourceable images or anything like that
if no, then no source
and if yes you grab the actual source
you just see "okay top result is a danbooru link, does the danbooru have a source?"
okay yeah if it were this image for example https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/3131429
fuck i keep speaking in collective
if we have to
we COULD grab a booru link from saucenao and then scan the booru link for the source
there you go
And yeah sure.
Huh. Twitter actually isn't there.
see if twitter is actually in saucenao
lemme just uhhhh
Makes it a lot easier to avoid misgendering if I don't gender at all
I'm used to speaking in collective
Okay you're working on it
And we stated that we're working on it
Well yeah, but we're working on it
no
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
and running or not, kiri is offline
i made it the second bingo did
kiri
bot down
mayday
<@!102691114762371072>
uh
doing things is fun
it's way more active now that people can actually see the results of things being worked on in the server
I guess. Meanwhile, TERFs are going apeshit over one of my threads
rukia straightening up or geting out is part of the plan
but rukia being incredibly dense isnt part of our plan
<@456226577798135808>
R, can I ask you to keep an eye on <#336297840529899522>? You're better at handling shit than I am.
I'd rather silence
I don't exactly think the derailment has helped
PLEASE BE SELF AWARE
```But only we get to do that```
Bringing it up in <#336297840529899522> won't count as an offense, but they should be forcefully reminded that just because it's serious-discussion doesn't mean it can be freely discussed in a disrespectful manner.
Next offense is a DM telling them what rule they broke followed by a kick. The offense after that is a ban,



the autosourcing as is goes way beyond what we had to begin with
yeah pretty much
alright
added
good point
<@!102691114762371072> can we get the placeholder message in Shirabe for links she can't read working today?
I put it in rules because when XV hits I'll make a few edits and commandeer <#371105434771390465> for group Symphogear watching
Thoughts on my update to the rules section?
Every post there will be symphogear related, yes, but it's very closely tied to the server
I'm in the server boat
autoscorer never had the write permission to begin with, it was inherited from everyone
oh, that's where you went wrong
yeah, before you presumably synced perms to make it public actually lemme check audits
<@!102691114762371072> you forgot to let shirabe send messages in the subreddit feed
I haven't been checking on the subreddit the past few days actually. <@456226577798135808> did you ever ask outside998 if they wanted to be in the content creators list? And also any status update on what Hibiki is even doing?
yeah what sakimori said
It isn't.
I'm saying it here because this server isn't my twitter and I'm not looking to enforce some regime so, sure, people here can respect the dude if they want, but it just seems so weird seeing the sudden about faces from so many people that I'm wondering how many of the people here are genuine or if they're just saying they're sad because they're supposed to.
He died today. imo he deserves as much respect as in death as he deserved in life - not a whole lot. And yet, here we are, with people mourning him and posting eulogies to twitter and shit and just, why? Like, okay, if you agree with and respect what he was doing then go right ahead, but my twitter feed pretty much universally hated the guy and now they're mourning him.
Yeah.
I'm gonna say it here just so I don't end up saying it in <#337805317276565525> instead but why should I even be sad if TB died. Like, fuck, no one should go through cancer and that includes him, but it's over now and I don't feel the need to mourn the loss of someone who incited hate speech using their public platform.
you've got it <@!102691114762371072>
yeah, if people aren't buzzing about it by tomorrow morning might as well just prompt discussion ourselves
not like an everyone would pull lurkers out of the shadows
but, oh well - it's an announcement so people will see it
yeah but i imagine some amount of people who dont play xdu would be interested too
wondering if I shouldn't have just done an everyone on that post
would've been better to release the browser thingy earlier in the day when more people were active...
all of the boorus as long as you can scan the page for the proper source as well
deviantart too
tits
what he does may be a spoiler
official judgment is that Adam existing is not a spoiler
but like, to facilitate easy discussion on the server
alright
his true form is
adam's existence is not a spoiler
yes
typically if the captain can't be assed it's just implied that it's the first mate's duty to be assed
well
if the captain delegates captain duty to the first mate, the first mate is still the first mate
Feeling my mind get torn apart was a bit unsettling
And the four arm thing was kinda neat
The spiders were still there but they weren't really bothering me too much
maybe. After I checked out of here it wasn't too bad.
if i had the option of having two arms or four arms, i'd go for four
itd be neat
like you can move each of your two arms individualy, it was the same feeling like i had four arms
it didn't feel different to having 2 arms
but it was like just, fluidly moving 4 arms each as their own limb
so that might impact my perception
like obviously i only had 2 arms for the entire duration
i mean it was like
i dont know how much of that experience was fueled by mutiny but at some point it felt like i had four arms
their mouths looked like vaginas
vagina mouths?
with mouth vaginas
big ones
and by the time I was like "R take over I'm too high for this shit" my mind was slowly drifting towards spiders
yes
at least i was forgetting something i didn't need to remember
...i guess i was forgetting something because now whenever I try and think about my dad the mental image I associate with him is now a two dimensional cutout with witch labyrinth madoka style art, a smudged face, and there are spiders everywhere
not sure if i'd have called it an out of body experience but it certainly was something
it felt like my mind was slowly unraveling
Like
I was definitely dissociating at some point in there
all hands on dick
Captain's back on board
done experiencing the whole weed thing
wow
okay
wh
i called them bloops because of steam's distinctive bloop
[hacks you in spanish]
everything can be hacked
And since anyone can have kiri play anything, I'd rather save the headache. That'd require too much moderation.
hieroglyphs I would like to despoiler at some point if the server can agree with it, music I would despoiler but I want music and music-commands to be congruent
Unless it were a god!tiki image I wouldn't rule it as a spoiler
eh. It's pretty obvious from the start that Adam has nothing but contempt for Tiki
what else could you possibly post there
live-shitposting has an argument for being a spoiler zone but hieroglyphs is like... mikugear, godbikki, deviladam
I still maintain that hieroglyphs should be a spoiler free zone. There are like 3 possible spoilers you could put there, would it really be so restrictive if people have to post a meme to a (usually vacant) discussion channel instead?
It's obvious that at the start of the topdad arc he's a piece of crap. The only spoiler there is how it resolves (him still being a piece of crap)
I wouldn't even call that a spoiler unless they started ranting about the ENTIRE arc
including the art channels
Originally there were like 6 spoiler channels
Nearly all of the discussion channels here are spoiler zones
There's no rule against posting memes or shitposts anywhere in this server, even in serious discussion. I even explicitly have it pinned that hieroglyphs isn't a ban on shitposting elsewhere.
Rule 4 has produced more headaches than I feel like it should. I don't get why people are averse to dumping their spoilery memes in channels that aren't dedicated to memes and shitposts.
Rule 5 is to be exercised with caution. It's there to stop endless arguments from taking place, but enforcing it at the wrong time just makes you look bad and makes people question what they can *really* say. I want this to be a place where people can say whatever they want, as long as they say it respectfully.
That is good! I actively avoid that kind of "my way or the highway" mentality, I don't think it breeds healthy communities.
At a certain point it's not the community's burden to bear, but if we can keep them here without too many heads clashing it's doing *something* good.
Anyway, don't let it leave this room because it's honestly disrespectful for me to say this in the first place, but I think I need to say it to explain myself a bit. Rukia has told me, in private, that they're trans and that's part of why I keep engaging with them and hanging on, because I feel like every single trans person that ends up dragged into the awful influence of edgy internet nazi shit is something that needs to be prevented. I've been there. It's not a good place and a few years ago I was a fucking asshole because of it. Keeping Rukia here is keeping some sort of dissenting voice in their life, and without that dissent they'll probably end up somewhere bad.
I'm a hopeless optimist and it's very hard for me to let go of someone who I think can be changed.
No I just have an abnormally high threshold.
There's a point where you do have to go "you either need to stop talking about this or get out" and I honestly believe Rukia would keep talking, but I don't think they do it out of malice.
But I don't think Rukia is malicious. Just... a bit dense.
True.
I'd like to just take this moment to point out that meaningfully engaging with Rukia's dumb video has led to what I would consider a better environment in that channel than simply leaving the steaming turd there for people to be exposed to
If he's capable of engaging meaningfully then I'd like to have that discussion. If he's just trying to smoke out a certain response, rule 5 exists.
Let him bait all he wants, it's not like bingo mods here.
Yeah, okay, he drops bait and tries to fuck around, skirting the rules is against the rules
Not seen, experienced
Having stuff like that go unopposed doesn't sit well with me. I've experienced what not engaging does.
I do, in fact, enjoy engaging with people.
I'm allowed to comment
<@456226577798135808> <@102691114762371072> I can't watch the video Rukia posted to serious discussion yet but I get the feeling that any discussion it generates might need to be moderated.
fixed
you can pin that for you cant you?

I'm pretty sure boorus have an api that would make things easier on you
i have nothing else to work on
i  am literally just making outlines for characters and im fucking bricking like a sony handheld
this was never a problem in school because i never wanted to write about any of the junk i had to write for school but now that i want to write something my issues with writing are actually frustrating
maybe i should write a different things
aaaaaaaaaa i wanna write things but im bad at starting and im bad at focus and aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
it's not part of the image?
wait how is the picture of the target there?

<:HibikiGold:370774300883419136>
No, it's too wide.

oh
also id rather not need to avoid spoilers in tabletops. itd make it less fun.
my sleep schedule is fucked. spent too much time yelling at a troll last night
i cant really miss it but i can certainly throw my schedule out of whack
im bad at life
tabletops is a spoiler zone for incredibly obvious reasons and i should really dilate
<@102691114762371072> what's the command for calling a quote that's been added to nadeko?
Maybe I should just spell it Tik
Well technically I didn't write anything, all of this is still just outlines
I didn't actually write a whole lot! But I feel like I've gotten stuff done.
this is still the best part in my notes for them `-Has never been horny in their life`
yeah I'm going with Tk
a different pronunciation doesn't change that
If I went with Tk the intent would be for the name to seem alien
actually, does it really matter if they pronounce it wrong?
Also I still like Tk even if people would pronounce it wrong
Nah, the character being agender is one of the few things the player is definitely going to know
How would Silver fit?
Even if the name sounds like a pseudonym
Well at this point I'm just trying to think of a word that properly encapsulates what I want out of this character while also sounding okay as a name
gotta cram as much symbolism in as I can because fuck if the player is getting any reliable information about this character
I'm liking Haven a lot but I feel like I want a name along those "just an actual word" lines but with a more fitting word
Saki, Tk, Haven, Aleph, Aleks
meanwhile I've shifted from "okay I have no good ideas for this character's name" to "fuck which do I choose"
...not literally a baby
I need a good name for my agender cyberpunk baby
miku's twin tentacle came up in some of the test tweets
she made a bot that generated tweets based on wfc's fics
that was at lyssa
the twitter bot broke a while ago btw
im fucking ready
Half of the shit I have down is literally just game mechanics too
unless i wanted to start more projects that will never be done
Even if your goal is to destroy rather than to purify, what good does ```this is harassment``````no it isnt``````yes it is```do?
I'm with saki here, flawed analogy aside.
hm?
so


`perfect`
Anyway, I just wanted to shitpost about Quinn possibly being demoted
I maintain my naive optimism
```Icebingo - Today at 8:15 PM
And this is not the first time weve had to have a serious discussion about Quinn evne being on xdrive```
And then that's part of *my* plan executed. Just fucking filter the shit out of valkyrie and purify the tainted Earth so that the greater Symphogear community may gay happily together.
I hope they do. She'll probably storm out never to return, and then Hecate will follow because her precious imouto left.
DL doesn't need that shit
I'd prefer she blames us than DL
<:totLikeThis:433035369529737217>
WHO IS QUINN GOING TO BLAME IF SHE GETS DEMOTED
<@456226577798135808> <@!102691114762371072> OH NO
Ohhhhhh no
Oh no

we're gonna do it
If given full autonomy I would try to make a cult of snowmen or something.
Oh, right. You said earlier that I was good at arguing and preventing damage, but honestly I try to do a lot of dumb shit and Lyssa just stops me.
oh right you dont know about the other group im in. basically discord was rapid firing messages at me for the entirety of today and it was nuts.
I'm not here to argue semantics
Like today's admin chat thingy
Clearly all the fun shit happens while I'm high
I should get high more often
It's been 36 hours since yesterday's trip and so much has happened and so much continues to happen

If Shirabe accidentally posts a spoiler just delete it. She won't be making too much sense, so it won't even look like a spoiler, just words mashed together.

In case you're wondering why the <#336297808221044736> discussion didn't get shifted to <#336297840529899522>, it's because I had already moved it from <#336297387863703552> and I felt like it would deter the conversation to move it again, and doing *that* would have meant no chances for wfc to feel better about themselves.

reminiscing about that time i just started dumping pokemon shit in general randomly because i was high
Besides, while he isn't exactly a terrible person, he *is* accustomed to 4chan. Our stance on slurs and what constitutes being a dick probably wouldn't gel too much with him.
Valkyrie provides the symphogear interaction he wants and being in two symphogear servers would just be a distraction to him I guess
Probably doesn't see the need to be here?
I think it's just the community. He's pretty friendly whenever I talk to him and he's been helpful in getting me set up with editing for them.
The way yttt has their dev environment set up it looks like I can actually edit the xdu reader myself. Although I'm guessing louis has something in place to confirm that changes are legit and not people fucking around.
Use @everyone instead of @here
I think this one warrants it. Feel free to global ping since this server kind of survives on fancontent to begin with.
im gonna go and unpin it since it's not exactly server related
and ive been conflicted on the joke fic ever since pinning it
all the other pins are either informative or... that one joke fic
i mean it's good, but a lot of the things posted there are good
yeah
<@!102691114762371072>
*checks fancontent pins* Saki why did you pin this
You only have to watch it once before you wanna watch it again
~~and the unannounced movie that totally deserves to be made~~
13 episodes
And once you know what Pure Illusion is, that's when you start going "Well THIS Pure Illusion represents this thing", and you can keep going 2, 3, 4 watches before you're done analyzing everything.
Because when you go through it the second time, you know exactly what Pure Illusion is. On the first run, you only have vague ideas on the nature of Pure Illusion, but once you get to the final act of the show, they tell you everything.
Watching it the first time is great. Watching it the second time is better.
Each episode tells its own story, but they all fit into a grander storyline spanning the entire series as well, so it'll probably satisfy the puzzle piece format just as well for you.
But it tells that story in such a unique way that it's honestly stunning, even if it trips up a bit towards the end.
There are multiple ways to explain the premise. At base, it's a coming of age story about a lesbian who doesn't know her place in the world.
That's fair. Have you seen Flip Flappers?
And then Rebellion was... something you could only truly enjoy if you cared about the characters, and Homura in particular.
So that led to Flip Flappers, it led to Symphogear, it led to a huge host of things.
But we never would have gotten Flip Flappers without Madoka. Madoka was a risk that showed that a magical girl show about something other than magic and good feelings can pay off.
Compared to something like Flip Flappers where every episode is just packed with information.
Like... the first fight between Sayaka and Kyouko, that episode doesn't do a whole lot. It introduces Kyouko to the main cast, but I don't remember much else of what it did.
Madoka said very little in its course from the start to the end. Some episodes stand out, like Sayaka turning into a witch, the flashback episode, etc, but in the end most of the episodes were "witches, yo" and it felt weak in series form for me.
So that kind of story really works better in a movie imo.
In a series I expect each individual episode to say *something* but Madoka was all about building up to that final point where Madoka makes her wish.
I appreciate the risks it took and the opportunities it created for future magical girl shows, but the format Madoka took specifically didn't resonate with me. The first two movies felt like a bit more of a coherent telling of the story than the series itself did to me.
Madoka is definitely a thing, and I wouldn't say it's a bad thing, but it's definitely not a thing for me.
okay yeah it was dragon
I think this specific instance was me not liking Madoka and solo being like "this discussion isn't going anywhere" even though it... was. Like we were just having a discussion about why I disliked it and what the movie had set out to do, no one was trying to make me like Madoka and I wasn't trying to convince anyone that it's a bad anime.
im gonna go take a shower once i drain my ep in xdu

Swapping colors between illuminati and alchemist, promoting saki, and letting kirichan handle temp bans
<@456226577798135808> how do you feel about being green
I guess, honestly? You've proven trustworthy enough to have kick/ban privileges. And at the moment, we don't *really* have a need for any "janitors"
yeah
I've also told Langou to cool some stuff in the past myself
Being prepared might be the better option here, especially since Langou, in the course of one day, got banned from valkyrie and accrued two warnings here.
So I dunno how useful it is to keep you from kicking or banning.
Although, originally when I was setting the server up, I had three roles because it was going to be separated into "Owner", "Discord Mod", and "Subreddit Mod"
And I'm hesitant to give bots kick/ban power. That's like... the one difference between Illuminati and Alchemist.

<@456226577798135808> ```Can I ask everyone to keep a pinned message updated for whenever you warn or kick someone? For warnings, list the name, why they were warned, if any messages were deleted, and when they were warned. For kicks, do the same but also note down how long the kick is for.```
until discord gives us an actual method of logging this shit
So I guess make your pin for now R.
Okay, kicks are our tempban method I guess.
That's bullshit
You can't
`the frog gets the axe`
...lemme actually test something real quick to see if you can actually temp ban someone or if you just have to kick and hope they don't come back.
Anyway, I guess we should start recording actions taken to make it easier to trace stuff and figure out who consistently steps out of line. Can I ask everyone to keep a pinned message updated for whenever you warn or kick someone? For warnings, list the name, why they were warned, if any messages were deleted, and when they were warned. For kicks, do the same but also note down how long the kick is for.
also the audit log sucks ass
still waiting on a rules page and horizontal role hierarchies
We should probably start keeping a log of warnings and kicks *since discord doesn't want to give us proper moderation tools*
Since you're the one who talked to him earlier, think you should be the one warning him for this? I already deleted it, and if you DM him then make sure to point out that the other 3 images were fine.
<@&336302034070536192> Downs joke in hieroglyphs. attached to 3 other images at the same time. What should we do?
I can't find the original, but here's the emote and the artist is https://twitter.com/kiraki217_jpn
we have other emotes for kanade now and I'd like to not steal art
it's good, but i never got permission to use it and I only added it to give wfc some kanade rep
<@!102691114762371072> If I remove one of the emotes that's used in the role-assignment comment, will Kirichan break?
Speaking of which <@456226577798135808> status update on the guides?
Just as I expect louis will deal with our rules for the sake of getting shit done with the wiki.
I don't like that kind of language, but I'll deal with it for the sake of getting shit done.
If we're gonna talk about how people use language outside of the server, here's something from Joe ```this is kinda aids so commie's is fine with modification```
I'd say he is an okay person who uses bad language, doesn't understand why the language he uses is bad, and doesn't wanna bother to be educated. And that says a lot of bad things about him, but I don't think it means he's someone we'd never want to work with. At the very least, I've opted to work with him.
It's more that it's just the language he's become accustomed to using and he's probably too lazy to put in the effort to change. That DOES say something about him, but it doesn't mean he's a KKK member.

will she DM the user with information on ban length/reason?
Kirichan has special permissions to kick/ban that Shirabe doesn't
what is illuminati
and jii_userLookup should output the information on the user, noting who issued which warnings and when

(R has been helping with edits)
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ywcb8VkXs4KpNW1T-vJvnIGYSn06EnxLbDPqxr-e1Us/edit here's the wip first draft. The end of that is pending some edits but I'm maybe halfway done? It's a hibimiku/dmjii double date.
Oh, you haven't seen the fic I'm writing at the moment have you
*`A symphogear doujin`*
We unleash our combination attack
And when it's time
We can level up our drawing and writing skills together
For writing I was able to just go "today's the fucking day let's go"
I think the need of a tablet is what put me off from drawing myself
Or did someone else do that
Was it you who just went out and bought a wacom tablet on a whim because fuck it it's time to draw?
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
you take garbodor and put it in the daycare with muk and they give you a xaxas egg
you know how garbodor is just a pokemon that's a giant pile of trash? and muk is just toxic waste?
someone on valk
Alright, I'll wait for xaxas to show up before I sound the alarms
Langou is inviting people to the server and I dunno if that's worrying or not.
allcaps
make the trigger GUN pplease

Should I make an announcement?
Start at 2%, lower it to 1% if needed
I mean, I'd have preferred she were random from the start
human interaction is difficult
So it's not that bad
to be fair, this was the direction we were going anyway
On Shirabe... how much effort is it to refine her text generation and then just make her respond randomly?
<@285555416056856576> don't make me gay at you
hwuh
I heard many bloops and yet none of my bloop servers had blooped me
Result being a line that... doesn't really read well in English
the intent is "If you don't stretch, bad things will happen to you" but I feel like she's trying to imply consequences rather than state them outright there
There are 9 lines between that and an actual explanation as to what she's talking about
Like this line that is bugging the hell out of me! It ends in "If you don't stretch your muscles right......" but I have no idea how much I should change it.
I'm not gonna mark it for editing though. It doesn't seem that important to me and sticking to the script is important unless you absolutely have to take creative liberties
It's probably not a translation error, since "ahhhhh" would just be ”ああああああ” in Japanese
Like... "Chris: Well then.... it's like my body melted when I took that shower." Chris would not start that sentence off with "well then". I'd expect a relaxed "ahhhh" or something there.
The worst part about doing XDU editing is that the writers are honestly just not that great and half the time I'm juggling between "do I just rewrite this line entirely" and "I gotta stick to the script"
It's fun
It's like writing but in reverse
Still "in training" though, so I haven't given myself the role
I'm doing editing for yamete now
think im gonna edit XDU stuff now and honestly either zio's translation game is weak or the XDU writers suck ass. I'm leaning toward the latter.
The section I'm on right now I'm trying to give more of a focus to DMJii with, switch to focusing on Shirabe/Miku for the hot cooking tips afterwards, and then after that i go to focus on all four of them at once. Past that I just need to wrap the fic up, which will probably include some amount of hibimiku since that's what I used to open the fic with.
I honestly thought it would be shorter but I'm only like halfway done and it's over 2000 words
The fic is actually for DL. I was having trouble settling on an idea to practice with, she was looking for writing commissions, so I just said fuck it and asked if she wanted a free fic so that I could practice.
I've gained a fan <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
```just
floof and gay```I am actively avoiding even mentioning that gears exist in this world because I just want this to be 100% fluff
LET'S SEE THE WORLD DO IT EXTRA WHOLESOME
NOW LAUNCH A CHECK ON 100% WHOLESOME
since that was sent in fancontent
oh, saki, you should see this one ```Shirabe.exeBOT - Today at 8:14 PM
Study visual arts for the revolution comes, Saki. ~~now launch a check on 100% wholesome let's see the world do it extra wholesome, just I sent to fight noise in the general Whats your pants smh I've```
but not having it at all would be nice
it's the only last real source of dysphoria i have and thankfully i can just remove it
facial hair = dysphoria = getting nothing done
anyway, bam, done
so i dont have to shave
and it's better for electrolysis anyway
not like having 4 instead of 3 days of growth is gonna make much of a difference
i didnt write any today because i feel like garbage when I have facial hair, but I have to shave tomorrow and I can't sh- FUCK IT I can shave tonight I'm gonna write tonight
I'll write more fluff tomorrow for you
anyway back to Pokemon for me. I need better ways of motivating myself to do things.
by multiple people
But also it's been spammed in general a bit
You either have to change the feature or contain it
In any community, if you introduce a bot feature and it becomes spammed by more than one person, you can't really say "hey can you guys tone it down?"
But in any case, fancontent was never intended to be a huge hub the way it was. Momria AU was conceived in sfw
okay no
maybe
Kinda
I do!
good priorities
I'd like pingable Shirabe in tabletops
Would it be possible to enable pings in certain channels and random response only in others?
You disabled her earlier but now that she can't be pinged she can be there again
Oh, is Shirabe active in fancontent?
Langou's behavior has become a bit of an issue since being banned from valkyrie
I... don't particularly like what langou posted but it's not breaking any rules
nsfw text is fine
Less interested in the game portion, but I want something to keep me on top of my stuff
a website that lets you make a to-do list and a daily schedule while framing it as a game
Today's goals: set up habitica, write more of my fic, ?????
not needing to bunch it up riiiiight behind my laptop's fans is pretty great
anyway i have my new blanket
I'm just wondering if it might've been better to focus on dice, or at least something that's not entirely story driven.
Probably
Put some power into your actions
There's also a notable lack of emoting. The character with emotionless -1 is more expressive than most of them when speaking. That's not really a huge issue since people have to start RPing somewhere but it's like
It'd be more notable if she WEREN'T touching something
But it's still data you have to parse
It's not
Faye also details like

Every single thing she touches.
<@102691114762371072>
I'm feeling like choosing a story focused tabletop system may have been a mistake. Everyone except you, me, and latooni seem to be pretty new to actually roleplaying. I made Lena with being a standoffish loner who causes more problems than she solves in mind but somehow I've become the group's speaker. Aegis is even less suited for the role than Lena is, too.
Yeah, suicide jokes fall under the same umbrella that holocaust jokes in a "don't fucking do it" way
~BUZZ WORDS~
Overall I think it could create a lot of user engagement and I fucking live for engagement
People can submit works to the sub directly or join in on your mishmash event
But yes, post that on the sub, pin it, and then just have "this week's challenge" pinned forever, switching it out as needed
~~even though the writing event was my idea~~
getitng shit done on this server would be a lot harder if it were just me
im really glad that both of you exist <@456226577798135808> <@!102691114762371072>
whirlwind of things to do
wow
okay
I'm 100% a follower and not a leader
You know, I'm starting to find it kinda odd that out of all the people within the greater symphogear community who could've, I'm the one who stood up and said "I'm making my own community"
That goes for everyone, but I already know it's gonna come up with pimsan
Also pimsan... isn't banned, nor do I see reason to ban them. Keep an eye out for people unnecessarily tearing into him because he is not a paragon of creative works.
I'm the one who made the art comment
ayway back to wiki stuff
how do you do, fellow kids
wait no ill ask this question there
do we uh
oh right today is ova too
wanna get these doc pages created so that people with actual skill can come in and do shit
things
finish
okay lemme uh
was it the rewatch?
I'm wrapped up in wikis
what were we gonna do again?
Could our 1k subs thing be the redesign?
and find out how many people are only there
you could just run it on the art channels only
I mean
Yeah. I'm not sure how much of a difference that makes though.
Also, 17% engagement for a series with no news and a shitty mobage seems pretty big to me.
Anyway, yeah. 1000 sub event. What we doin.
R and Lyssa haven't seen this, so I'm just gonna drop these messages here because why not after we went to the trouble of getting the data to begin with. This was from a conversation with bingo that I had looking for how many unique users were active on each server and how large of a percentage that is compared to the total users on each server. "Not XDU numbers" means excluding people who speak only in the xdu channels. tl;dr we're actually a bit more active than them.
```Yuri Girl - Today at 12:49 AM
So you're at ~11% for 24 hours and ~13% for 72 hours while we're at ~13% for 24 hours and ~17% for 72 hours```
```Yuri Girl - Today at 12:52 AM
for not xdu numbers it's... ~9% in 24 and ~10% in 72 for you while it's ~10% in 24 and ~13% in 72 for us```
mmmm we can tie it in with the weekly prompts
What, exactly, are we doing again?
it's not a problem if part of that gets covered by blanket but i dont wanna get dried lube all over everything by using the full length
full sized bed but 2/3 of the bed is dilation supplies
my normal blankets are too big for my current bed set up
it's not as fluffy but it's also a twin sized blanket
It's like two pages of DMJii toward the end there and I still have a few more pages to go before the entire thing is even finished
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ywcb8VkXs4KpNW1T-vJvnIGYSn06EnxLbDPqxr-e1Us/edit?usp=sharing
`you want some DMJii kid?`
I just got finished with the DMJii heavy part of the fic
Hey Saki
Hey
`perfect`
Please change Shirabe's reloading messages to

Stand up!
Ready!!
```ibu2009 <— Ping for pics - Today at 4:31 PM
so one of my friends has finished symphogear and im gonna give him an invite link to the discord
but i feel i should give some heads up
I would safely say he is toxic to a degree, and bringing him to the discord will either break through his mentality or you get sick of his shit and ban him.
thats the way i see it anyway, perhaps im overreacting but i felt i should at least give you a heads up on how i feel about him```
you can pin, but done
forever
well just mention that its ongoing
i meant the prompts
it is, right?
make sure to be explicit that its a weekly thing
and you control the prompts
since the sticky will change weekly
but better if you do
or i can
good, make that post and sticky the shit out of it
about the weekly prompts
a post on the sub
should there be like
i just want my dick back for a day
can we make shirabe do it
uh huh
i want to masturbate it has been ten months
...my dick?
has it come home
is it my dick
I just guess limit it to just the 6 main gears
Also each character's fighting style is JUST different enough for all of them to feel different
Anyway I kinda wanna make something like that because XDU sucks
`also he can be a shapeshifter and look like ver`
But the "dude in stasis" idea gives the game a convenient villain
I wonder if distributing it through torrents would be okay
I can write though
Story though. I was thinking that maybe there was someone in stasis inside the treasury and the blast from the nephilim wakes them up. Then they start making new noise, grab the cane, and force the gates back open.
Yeah
King records can't dmca us if we don't actually distribute the music
Yeah, that's what I was thinking
We could bug bingo to make netcode if we actually get this done. He'd probably enjoy the idea
Undertale is gamemaker iirc
It's rpgmaker with a cleaner template
Gamemaker would handle it just fine unless the number of objects makes it lag
For a story we could just use the "Solomon's Cane gets out" thing I mentioned earlier
Correct
Best em ups are inherently 2.5d
That could be an entirely different game though
I mean, sure
And beat em ups are just arcade musous
It'd work well since making a musou as a multiplayer game would be difficult
Yes
Games like that
Turtles in time, streets of rage
No
Specials would be useful ways of clearing a lot of enemies quickly
Pure beat em up
Turtles in time
And yes, the music sticks until a new special is performed
Specials would 1) need to be built up and 2) the game would pause briefly, cutin with the character screaming, then resume with new music
If multiple players special all at once, music changes to the appropriate duet.
If a player executes a special attack, music changes to their character's music
Maybe 6 instead
One for each gear user
Symphogear beat em up with netplay allowing for up to 9 players
IDEA: XDU sucks so let's make our own symphogear game. As long as the music comes separately and we're not selling it, it SHOULD be fine legally.
I guess we'll find something
What would we do for events? Other than the stuff we have planned already
we had 4 and 5 announced at the same time. AXZ was 4
We have the wiki and R's creativity prompts to go on but I feel like we need more than just the prompts
I know I'll love the series forever but growth will stagnate and other people will stop caring
So what do we do if XV is actually the last season?
smol
So 100% doable if you wanna battle in a GBA rom
VBA is p2p
VBA has built in link cable functionality, desmume does not
You can use showdown, but showdown kills the mood
That requires a method of battling, though. I'm pretty sure most emulators have link capabilities, but I don't know how exactly those links work.
But I'd do that rarely and make sure people would actually have fun with it.
I MIGHT add in "Nuzlocke Tournament" as a variation from time to time. After each gym, you construct a team from what you have available without any additional training or catching, and then you wait for someone else to reach the same point you're at, the two people battle, and the loser either drops to a loser bracket or gets knocked out of the contest entirely. Then you continue on playing until the next gym.
I wanna make competing the fun part, rather than winning.
The prize would be a sparkling "Pokemon Master" role. Which... I dunno, separates you from other people in the role list.
Overall, a lot of people seem to enjoy Pokemon, and this feels like an interesting way to get people involved without boiling the game down to competitive battling.
We could have a channel dedicated specifically to Pokemon contests. If people are active and post about their run there and talk to others about their runs, bam, you get a time bonus for being a good sport.
What you play the game on will usually be pretty lax. If you wanna play the actual cart on the original hardware, go right ahead as long as you can get a picture of your trainer card.
In general, each contest will span a month. Once you complete whatever the month's requirements are, you submit a picture of your trainer card (or an alternative win condition for morespecific contests) and then the winner is announced at the end of the month. Requirements can range from simple things like "Beat the champion while playing either Fire Red or Leaf Green" or "Catch every Pokemon obtainable without training in Platinum". It can also be more complex, such as "Catch every Pokemon available and beat the champion while playing this specific randomizer seed for Black 2" or "Play through a soft nuzlocke run of Mega Moemon while recording your wipes". The honor system will be used, so theoretically someone *can* cheat, but whatever in that case.

Sometimes, the contest might require modifications. For instance, it can be "Speedrun Pokemon Red" which would have a signup period, then everyone would be expected to start at the same time and the first person to reach the credits wins. That would be a rare variation just because of the headache of organizing it, but also because speedrunning a gen 1 game requires you to sell your soul to an eldritch abomination.
Okay. Back. So, more in depth explanation on the Pokemon contest stuff.
Anyway, 4%, will elaborate later
I thought up a few interesting formats we could use. Something like "nuzlocke tournament" where after each gym, you battle another participant at the same spot as you using any Pokemon you have without additional grinding. Winner moves on, loser is out of the race.
I wouldn't. Everyone is just expected to play honorably.
Since that lists time in game, badges, and Pokedex completion
Results would be posted in the form of a trainer card
Changes each month. Might be "beat the game" might be "complete the Pokedex" might be something more complex
Then everyone else has until the following month to submit their results, and we have out a temp role for winning or something
Every month, I post rules for the contest.
Anyway, I had another idea. A lot of people in the server are really into the Pokemon posts and we've got like 3 people posting their play through in shitposting. Valkyrie has their tournaments, but what if we had playthrough contests instead?
Anyway, back to the idea I had because I'm on 10% battery. We can talk about symphoslug later.
It'll be fun practice for saki's art and my writing
I'd have brought it up in fancontent but I didn't want to talk about it for two hours while drugged
No deadlines, no secrets, just fun
I just want to get a fun symphogear fan game out there
We'll tap people as we see fit.
It's not a staff thing. It's a small project thing.
Anyway, I have more ideas, ones that aren't questionably legal
You're good, especially for someone just starting out
It's okay saki I believe in you
And we have an artist, coder, and writer between me and saki
R, no one mentioned a fighting game
Painkillers aren't enough
But I need a local anaesthetic.
Painkillers don't put me out as long as weed does. And it was fun.
King records are the ones who issue DMCAs. Satelight doesn't care.
It won't be tied to the server anyway. We'll just be making a fanwork. Besides, they don't go after shit unless it has the music.
Miku weird also be unique
ill add it once im done dilating and when this mysterious artist hands me a ful res version
yeah it's cute and gay
I totally wanna use that dmjii hug for the server
Neat
Kiri could clear the channel at the start of every month on command
And also because "DM me" is a remarkably bad way of getting results.
That way things won't get lost in the clutter of discussion and anyone can view other people's results if they want to.
Ideally it'd be like a jii_submit command where you just type in the command, attach an image, and then Shirabe beams it off to a separate channel that only she can speak in (but anyone can view)
Saki please tell me how annoyingly difficult doing this would be since I wanna make a Pokemon channel and if I make the Pokemon channel I wanna announce the contests and if I announce the contests I wanna make a role for it and also have a way of submitting results which isn't just "Yeah DM me thanks"
question is how hard would that be
But Shirabe can because you can even make that work across servers
Ok Kiri can't do it
dess_say test
<@!102691114762371072> Is it possible to make Kiri or Shirabe take an image or message posted in one channel and spit it out in another channel?
because discord is ass
Saki has to edit the comment
And making people ask is bad
And if you don't know what CA is for you have to ask
Some are obvious like XDU but then there's Community Anthology
I feel like <#448237561085952001> could use some descriptions on what each role is *for*
Well they were replaced by someone who has accrued 2 pages of comment history in less than an hour
i hadnt seen the 4th shinai
yes
good job
OH
oh
IS THAT FROM AXZ SHINAI 4
SHIT
she was mvp on the ss anne
also i used her in mega moemon
i only have 5 pokemon
only my sentret died, right?
Also I think so.
short for Litrock Stimbone
Litrock
Oh <@!102691114762371072> did you see what I named my geodude
Yeah, with a time frame of a month it shouldn't be *too* restricting if you have to wait a few hours for sentrets to show up instead of hoothoots
If you wanna play the original gold cart on a game brick while everyone else uses a rom, more power to you
But I also want to allow for flexibility in what exactly you play on
Basically I want everyone to be on an equal playing field for when I run the contests
If you're playing anything gen 4 or later, you can absolutely change the time on the DS clock to change the time in the game
VBA just allows you to override that
You can, but I'm fairly certain that doesn't actually do anything if you're playing RSE on a DS, since RSE store the time on the cart
I'm guessing no
Dunno if you can do time manipulation in RSE with a DS though
DPPt and onwards use the DS clock though
So you can fuck around with the time in GSC and RSE if you're using an emulator, but not if you're using a gameboy.
In game clocks, however, can be synced to your computer's time
The playtime counter is handled entirely by the game, so if you hit the fast forward button on an emulator, the counter speeds up accordingly.
The playtime counter and the clock in pokemon games
Yeah. FRLG have no clock, and RSE times don't do a whole lot
FRLG don't have any time differences *I think*
Oh, I guess gen 3 also does have time differences for stuff like shoal cave
Other than time manipulation, which isn't *that* huge since you can just turn the game off and wait if you're playing GSC on a gameboy and you can do the same exact time manipulation shit for gen 4+
So emulators don't give any advantage over playing the game on the original hardware
Okay, good, turbo mode affects the in game timer
Anyway, once I'll probably look to do the Pokemon stuff next month, so I won't make an announcement just yet.
See: comiket
As for the fan game, it'd be just that. A fan game. I'd check in on the legality of creating our own art of satelight's characters and using that fanart in a non-profit fanwork. Odds are, we'd be fine, and we have time to research it while saki works on his art skills. As long as we don't distribute the music, king records wouldn't go after us, and I don't think satelight gives much of a shit about fanart being used in a fangame.
In any case, that functionality wouldn't be needed most of the time. That's a "maybe in the future" thing.
(Although me and Lyssa were planning on doing it with actual carts as well, so... dunno how much that helps roms)
For gen 7 games we could just say "Buy the actual damn cart" but for gen 4-6 we'd need the server workaround BUT HEY GUESS WHO WAS GONNA WORK ON THAT ANYWAY
NDS onwards becomes tricky because you'd need to host it on your own server (easy) and trick the game into finding the server (hard)
Or GBC or GB
swap out a piece of fanart i dont have permission for with a piece i do
yeah
oh
emoji?
But it totally fucking is Quinn or someone she knows.
I can't say for certain that it's Quinn
Meanwhile, 2 minutes after Quinn leaves the server, this pops up in DL's ask box https://i.gyazo.com/28e2720717cf102a5443d08b9e586609.png
Just don't try to instigate shit
Well, yeah. I'm just saying that there's no ban on talking about the fact that she was demoted
You can talk about it, just don't make news about it
Anyone can look at the valkyrie server and see that she's demoted
Quinn
SHE'S GONE
Yeah, just the ability to isolate jii_submit messages in their own channel
Might as well add a pokemon trainers role at the same time so I can do the same
I'm gonna make a Pokemon channel and announce the contests once Saki is home and can work on shirabe
Which, in one way, makes us stand out from valkyrie even more, since we'll be the ones with Symphogear content while they're doing their own thing with a Symphogear label slapped on it.
There's a decent chance of it happening. With no new seasons and a garbage mobage, we'd have to rely on fancontent.
and role-assignment is auto-cleared
the reaction role assign is... delicate
And we can't really move role-assignment
saki needs to be home if we do anything with the bot channels
it doesn't see use and general chat can be used for what little voice activity we do here
we could axe general voice
but the former does cover more than just anime
<#377148557796442134> and <#371105434771390465> could be merged
You can't see them right now, it's set to custodian and autoscorer only
There are two channels prepped for XV that will be opened once it actually starts
Reducing channel clutter is good, but remember that like half of the channels are staff only
<@!102691114762371072> when you're online again remind me if removing KanadeSmile will break Kirichan or not
oh saki is offline
what do i remove to add this emote...
ok, right, dmjii hug
yes

didn't we flirt in serious-discussion earlier
Most people didn't like the idea of the pokemon contests
Don't really need to do the shirabe command thing anymore so doesn't look like you're missing anything
I definitely want it to encompass both kits and figures, but what else could go there?
Well if we're gonna make it, I want the channel to be as broad as possible
That makes expressions along with the rest of my face
Emotive mask
Also yes, the mask is important
But a similar looking character named Green exists in adventures
Oh, it's Leaf in game according to bulbapedia
But the manga calls her Green
I think in the anime she's Leaf?
Green is the girl sprite in FRLG
If you actually draw me you need to understand that the mask is integral to my look

That, or stick me in Green's outfit.
I'd say just worry yourself with drawing the normal sprite for Green
Alright, well in that case... what kind of format would you wanna work in? The original nuzlocke comic was pretty poorly drawn so a comic format doesn't need to be the best comic ever
Thinking about it, it might actually be too much work for me to ask you to do
And you're a lot better than I am
Having drawings to recap my pokemon adventures would be neat even if they weren't top quality
<@!102691114762371072> oh my god what if you drew my moemon adventures
yeah, right now it's just two people who want it
but we could have it along with general figure stuff and add a channel with a bigger scope
I think zolgnein and langou are the only two who actually do gunpla and stuff
i can't sneakily change his name to snekimori anymore
fuck he woke up
wait fuck i was gonna change the message after pinging but i realized i can just change his name
<@!102691114762371072>
nah ive been dilating and complaining about the reddit redesign to bingo
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384870333620027403/458484686293958656/image-5.jpg
Do we do anything about it? I dunno if it's really nsfw.
<@&336302034070536192> Langou posted something in hieroglyphs again
If we have to kick ibu out due to time constraints are we gonna drag a new person in?
Just make sure that the reddit post always has the time frame in the title
https://www.reddit.com/r/Symphogear/comments/8s2jld/writing_prompt_for_june_18th_july_1st_journey/ and here it is on the subreddit. Going forward can you make the subreddit post and pin it every other week? (Or tell me to do it if you can't)
the sandwiches must be rough, I understand
Actually I'll post it for this first time regardless
Post it to the sub too, if you can. Otherwise I'll put it up there.
<@456226577798135808> can you post writing prompts in announcements, but ping <@&458048859910832149> instead of @everyone? Gives it extra visibility for people to get in next time, or do it on their own for fun.
oh hiero
wh

I wouldn't mind, but if you're super concerned about it, you could get something trans pride themed with the ally flag on it somewhere
You don't *need* my blessing
also i want that it's so much nicer than my current trans bracelet
I'd guess you were trans, but wouldn't be offended if you weren't
I dunno, I feel like doing some "highlight of the week" or "highlight of the month" would be useful to get more people looking at it.
I don't necessarily wanna get rid of it, but I do want to rebrand it.
Also I'm feeling like the content creators page kinda flubbed. It was popular when we made it but no one new has been added since.
you're not reading that line properly, R
It'd essentially be "fancontent for things that aren't symphogear, but also figures for anything"
I just said crafts-and-figures
something like crafts-and-figures
I can make it just for "non-symphogear crafts"
did that warn go through?
which is dumb
always
reports are anonymous
it's a report on the post Lily made on the sub
I wanna publicly call whoever did this out but then they'd win
Cool obviously meaning into Symphogear
None of the cool kids live near me
Anyway back to my earlier complaint of Saki why do you get to live near the people who you can go to a cool fair with and I live near illegal van dude.
You're free to moderate as you see fit. I don't feel comfortable telling someone to quit something as subjective as tone, and when she devolved into patronizing comments, Saki handled it before I could.
I did tell her to flat out stop with personal attacks earlier.
Saki why do you get to live near the people in the campaign who can type out a well thought sentence
Done! <@!102691114762371072>
Alright. I'm writing for the prompt now and god damn the thing I decided to write is hard to plan out.
which I'll do once Lyssa is here
I'll start writing after I dilate
oh that
I've been using it on my own fine, but if you feel like you need the push to get stuff done that's why I'm mentioning it
If you wanna use it.
I'm 1500 words under my weekly goal <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
it's uh https://habitica.com/
so if you have a repeated thing you just make it happen regularly
it's got dailies/weeklies
I don't think so, once you enter your stuff and get it set up you just hit checkmarks as you do stuff
Its got social functions so people can rely on each other to remain accountable
I use it to stay on top of shit I'm supposed to be doing
Actually, there is this thing called habitica which is a website/app for gamifying your life
taking you down with me
that's the rules
I think I'm gonna get some writing done later tonight. If I write you gotta draw.
I am really behind on doubledate
`more harder`

Yuri Girl - 06/12/2018
My personal stance is that memes and shitposts go wherever as long as they're respectful. If you've got something that would otherwise overrun general we just point you toward live shitposting.
Langou... seems to listen to being told to stop on the sub server
It doesn't stay in his head for very long but he listens
Icebingo - 06/12/2018
The problem is that he might stop after you tell him the second time, then a week later would do similar shit again
Yuri Girl - 06/12/2018
Yeah we recently enabled warnings on kirichan to keep track of his shit
Icebingo - 06/12/2018
Like, Unki left our server for like a day over some shit in bot commands when we were resetting gems, Then when unki came back first message in chat was from  langou and was just :SongStone:
I promptly deleted the message, about 30 seconds later he posts it again
Yuri Girl - 06/12/2018
yeah, he hasn't done that on the sub server yet
right now i'm inclined to just give him a clean slate to work with and he can get warnings all he likes up until we kick or temp ban him
Icebingo - 06/12/2018
Hopefully he stays the same on yours since he isint on ours anymore
also has he ever said nigger on your server?
Yuri Girl - 06/12/2018
No.```
```Icebingo - 06/12/2018
Thats why we try to keep a certain level of meme just out of the server
Langou kept asking for a shit post channel and none of us want to deal with that
Yuri Girl - 06/12/2018
we have two shitpost channels and it's pretty alright
Langou doesn't understand english so that makes it a bit difficult to do anything with him in hieroglyphs but he behaves well enough in live shitposting
we had to tell someone to stop making suicide jokes earlier. we're not certain it was langou, but it was definitely fucking langou.
Icebingo - 06/12/2018
He was just too intentionally antagonistic with us, and liked to immediately do the same thing again after we told him not to. I'm fine with a bit of meming in general and am a lot more tolerant of it than Quinn/Hecate are. There's just a line that needs to be set.
Suicide and overtly racist jokes are beyond that line.```
I'm mostly operating on information from bingo which lemme go grab that
I don't necessarily agree, but for langou yeah I guess.
I would have done it but I wasn't sure how many times this has come up because discord is ass and doesn't have the warn capability built in
dess_warn <@269526749249929227> Censored porn is still porn. Please do not post porn to <#384870333620027403> or any other SFW channel.
I'm just gonna go and delete that one
uh
<@!102691114762371072>
rekt
I'm a bit more strict on nsfw stuff (eg, anything drawn at an angle specifically for pantyshots is nsfw) but that's a good starting point
personally I think leaving this one up is fine, and making a "random" announcement would look weird

hahaha train upload speeds


Like I say she, but she is just default for me
And also I don't think I've ever seen her confirm her gender in any way.
DL does state on her tumblr that she doesn't care about pronouns
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
If people are using it anyway it can stay, obviously
That's why I said if it goes without activity
Langou was the one who initially pushed for it.
If <#458060276550336522> goes without any significant activity in the coming week, I'm gonna archive the channel and push discussion in it to more generalized channels.
<@!102691114762371072> consider yourself a custodian for the next few hours
it's not very useful but if you're familiar with it you can do it quickly
yes
then type `s/<string in original message>/<string you want that string to turn into>`
type a thing
maybe you can't have a slash in the replaced message

Contemplating getting up on announcements and telling bigots to fuck off, but I don't want to scare away people who aren't bigots in the process.
It hurts bingo, who survives solely off of the garbage that gets spewed on his server
I don't think that bingo should be allowed to live the way he does currently
It's just a different view point, so I guess I'm a bingophobe

They do have an admin only chat
BOTH SIDES where the dick is that video
There's always two sides you know
BUT THEY'RE NOT BEING AGGRESSIVE SO IT'S OKAY
Someone called me a dude
MUH BOTH SIDES
Literal garbage




No more angry rants. No more communication besides stat stuff I ask bingo for. Fuck em. They don't deserve help.
Let them think we care.
Get the wiki running and then just play pretend.
Fuck em

Fuuuuuck bingo

Possibly. I'll draw one up once I'm home.
JUST JOEKZ

I'm fine with that. Collecting fuel is collecting fuel, even if I have to yell at Xaxas myself for it.
I had no intention or expectation of having a meaningful conversation with Xaxas. bingo didn't want to do his job, so I did it for him.

<@456226577798135808>




Well I've got some words
well she's typing a lot
I think it's fine in the context of a DM
Let's hope this one goes smoothly


Rape apologists are certainly not allowed on the server, but I'm not sure if "rape apologist apologist" should get the same treatment.
<@456226577798135808> <@!102691114762371072> If someone is defending a rape apologist, does that make the defender a rape apologist, or a rape apologist apologist.
Alright, I'm gonna ask for `the council` to weigh in.
I have hope that it won't come to that, but *defending a rape apology* is worth my attention
As I've said, if you're anything discriminatory, you're gone, regardless of whether you're expressing that on the server or not. I won't warn her for what she's said on the server, but I also won't hesitate to take action if she says something that reveals a behavior I don't want here.
btw, <@!102691114762371072> <@456226577798135808> I feel that Sparkle's words in serious discussion last night deserve a bit of talking to on my part, but I'd like the opinion of one of you before I DM her because you were actually there
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/416318747914141696.png?v=1 for shirabethink, https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/235243254637920266.png?v=1 for bikki

Also I said I'd make up a ban on sight list once I was home, so...

Riya#3436

<@!102691114762371072> It might be useful to have a "distinguished" role for mods to use when speaking officially. Under normal circumstances we'd just have normal rep colors for our names, but if we need to say something specifically as a mod, we just go and jii_distinguish (or jii_d for an alias) and it gives us a role that changes our color to either Alchemist's turquoise or Custodian's yellow. It would also serve as a text reminder that "Hi, I have power and I currently see a reason to wield it"
For the record, here's bingo's response re:rape apology
You know, when I brought up the transphobia thing, I expected *maybe* some pushback that maybe the host of transphobia isn't transphobic themselves. But then Sparkle came in and started saying strange things.


Lets hope the trend continues
Lily
someone left
*peeks at valkyrie* someone read serious discussion
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
YES
in that case
okay
oh
wait when in august
YES
I said "a discord server", not which one. Users who were there can infer what it's about, but I'm invoking it solely for context. This *is* a constructive discussion.
I'm not going to say valkyrie
*Hopes Wien isn't around*
Rule 5 is my trap card (I won't)
Are you prepared to put out a fire? I got shit I wanna say in serious discussion and I can't objectively mod a discussion that I'm part of.
oh i thought she just ignored my message about victim blaming
<@456226577798135808> would that be an acceptable solution too? It effectively kicks a user and there's no extra effort on our part in letting them come back when they're ready.
Alright, that's useful information
Since they'd be in the quarantine channel.
That would mean any Staff could quarantine someone, but if someone is quarantined they could de-quarantine themselves.
If it ever comes to the conclusion that we need to implement a quarantine function, is it possible to disable it for the whole server and then implement it for specific roles AND for people in specific channels?
If you're gonna shut someone out of one channel you kinda need to shut them out of every channel.
It did nothing helpful
I restricted Rukia and Wien once
I'm gonna go ahead and remove the restricted role. It honestly is kinda useless.
Alright.
R, I understand you're upset, but kick + invite is *exactly* what has worked before. If we have to ban even one person in the course of this we can revisit it. Please understand that the lack of a lobby does make a difference here.
Yes. Just send them a DM beforehand including the invite and saying something like "come back when you're ready" and then kick.
Both Rukia and Wien were given an invite right before I kicked them.
R, you've gotten on me for not putting my foot down in the past. I'm doing that now. Kick + invite or quarantine. These are the options.
If you're going to kick someone, at the *very* least, send them the invite so they don't have to go looking.
Yes, and they were sent invite links to come back once they were ready.
It's effectively a kick that doesn't remove the person from the server so they don't have to seek out the invite again.
For valkyrie, quarantines are to give the user in question a one on one with staff. Here it'll just be a timeout role.
Valkyrie hasn't done mutes? And we'd be using quarantines differently.
We can even hide most of the server from someone using roles that Kiri can assign.
Kirichan can support a mute feature.
I just don't want kick to be the alternative.
I already said I want an alternative to the role.
It's not the same, and kick should ideally be used as a "you're getting a bit heated and you need to cool off. Come back in a few hours" thing.
On Discord, you get kicked, and then you need to actively seek out the invite again.
On Steam, you get kicked, but you still have Steam open and can join through there.
On IRC, you get kicked, but you're just back at the server's landing page.
The psychology that the lobby invokes is very different from discord.
I'm going to go ahead and use my server owner status to say no to that. I think we need an alternative to <@&336303783699021848> but I don't think the alternative should be a kick.
If discord had a lobby like IRC does, I'd definitely say kick
Only on IRC, really. Sure, they can just rejoin using the public link, but I'd rather restrict or mute someone for a period than have them either disappear entirely or just rejoin immediately and spout off something even worse.
I'm not fond of it myself, and I wanna replace it with something else, but it fixes a problem we're having right now.
Bringing it to general after being restricted is inappropriate behavior and is reason enough for a warning.
Feel free to make use of it.
Oh, by the way, if Hazel is being condescending in <#336297840529899522> and hasn't exactly done anything to warrant a full kick or ban, <@&336303783699021848> blocks access to that channel.

You said things
Oh
I'm walking but I'll read once I'm stopped <@456226577798135808>
Yeah, Jap is the slur. I think it's acceptable.
Thoughts on cast's hieroglyph? It's an edited version of a propaganda poster that contains a slur.  It's parodying the original propaganda though, in a way.
Here's why they got the kick
Yeah. I kicked them because they don't want to be here.
Ah, yes, a slap on the wrist. Very effective.


<@456226577798135808> once we can settle on a method to handle feedback within an appropriate timeframe, tell me and I'll make a template for the announcements
The conversation started nowhere and it's going nowhere. We can talk about things to do *once the person who manages the bots is actually fucking here*
If I'm being stubborn about documentation, you're being stubborn about semantics. I already said that the action will be moved over to another log once we actually fucking make one. Do not argue past this point.
```The primary reason for it being sent through Kirichan is just to maintain a log.
castform5 - Today at 6:56 PM
yeah, I understand. I actually considered not posting it, and the risk I took was calculated, but man I'm bad at math
no hard feelings from my end```There is the end of my message to cast and his response to me. It's fine the way it is.
Right now, it stays in the log. We'll put it in the other log once the other log *exists*
Which I am perfectly willing to say "saki can you do this?" for
That's not going to change the functionality of the command. If we're going to do that, we might as well make a separate command that doesn't send a DM out at all.
It should be logged and easily accessible. The function is named dess_warn but it is not necessarily *just* warnings here.
I will go and tell them that it's actually a warning if you're so concerned about this.
right now warn is all we have
Like I said, I'll remove the warn once we have a separate log of "things that aren't warnings"
Yes. And we log this so that way, the next time we nudge, we know to give a bit harder of a nudge.
Deleting the warn isn't going to make the DM go away
But *why*. If someone does something that warrants action, then the action should be logged. I'll remove the warn once we have a separate "here's a thing someone did but they didn't need a legitimate warning for it" log.
yes
done
What do you want me to say?
You can go make things more clear in DMs. I feel like my intent was perfectly clear as is.
I didn't say the warning was meaningless, I said it wasn't severe.
I wanted it logged.
I didn't see it. In any case, we don't do warn > suspend > ban. We're not robots. Someone can get 5 warnings before we do anything with them, or they can be banned for their first offense.
1) I did not have that context until literally just now
2) Intent doesn't mean shit, especially in hieroglyphs
nonsense or not, you can't assume anyone reading it will have the full context
Doesn't matter, that one image should not be on this server.
Not acceptable, not even as a joke.
"Die. You won't regret it."
dess_warn <@!231025503643893770>  Hey, this isn't as severe a warning as I'd give for something like blatant usage of a slur, but please don't post suicide jokes to the server. We don't need someone actually taking that advice. For context, this warning is in response to this image: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384870333620027403/462380650985553940/WhatsApp_Image_2018-06-30_at_12.31.40_AM.jpeg
I'll do a warn so that it's logged but I'll make it clear that they haven't crossed any major lines
Why is hieroglyphs like 90% of our problems and that's the only channel where we can't just directly go and say "slow down there"
Should I do an official warning or just a gentle reminder?
for context
I need to eat. I don't expect issues, but make sure people are being civil <@456226577798135808>
take the things from your computer and put them in the place that's not your computer <@285555416056856576>
And like 3 tags on ao3 dedicated purely to be like "THIS CHAPTER IS NOT FUN TO READ"
Don't worry, that chapter will have warnings on it.
Any fluff it touches will be annihilated.
It will be anti-fluff
Purely for how uncomfortable I'm going to make it.
I expect to put a CW on the fic at some point for that.
It's fine, solo will properly know suffering when I write the *incredibly* uncomfortable "have you gotten the surgery yet?" chapter
I control the fic anyway ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
speaking of which <@285555416056856576> when can we put Ryouko's logs on Shirabe? I know you're in Montreal right now, when will you be home?
R, if you want Maria find something another bot can do that's useful, not possible with nadeko, and too much trouble with Shirabe
I want to delete Ryouko. Let's find a use for a third bot before we actually make one.
We could probably automate it.
We've already stated we're not robots, and we can look at things subjectively. We can even delete old warns.
As is, I don't have faith in my own memory for this. Too many people, too many issues, and too many factors.
What can we do that is better than using the warn function.
That's not a leading question, I'm not trying to trick you, I'm looking for a middle ground to stand on.
How do we, collectively as a group, maintain knowledge of every single user who has been warned about a particular topic?
So in other words, we'd have to add the entire function to Shirabe instead.
As it is now, we could just remove the word "warning" from the DM she sends and then follow up with a DM from a human, but I don't know how much work that is with Nadeko.
How much control do you have over Kirichan's functions? Would you have to write something from scratch?
we can do that?
Do you want the warn functionality to be rewritten so that it doesn't say warn anymore? It feels like you're getting caught up on semantics.
The initial warn was a bit less explicit about that than it should have been, but the follow up did clarify that.
They understood the issue, understood that the warning was not for a major infraction, I'm not seeing where the two issues disconnect.
Reposting a suicide joke is still posting a suicide joke. We've talked to people in the past (I believe solopy, this was before we had kirichan and is exactly why I want these logs) about absentmindedly posting things even when they mean no harm. Further "they didn't intend it as a suicide joke" is *exactly* the reasoning bingo gave for Xaxas's bile being okay by them.
Codification would ensure that major warnings are always understood to be major warnings and "please don't do this again" warnings are understood to be just that.
And, again: codifying *how* warnings are written may be helpful.
A written record gives us something to point to when someone says "Well you never did anything about *this*!" when, in fact, we did.
Fucking connection
That being said, I do believe that "it's just a joke haha" type stuff does merit a "you're not actually in trouble" warning just to make sure that both the user and the staff have a written record of what they have done.
The very founder of this chatroom thought that her initial warn message was sufficient sitting down and talking. She listened to complaints and did additional sitting down and talking. I accept that my initial act may not have been the exact proper response, but I also would like to note that I am human and we have multiple Custodians and a non-stratified hierarchy specifically for this reason. Going forward we may codify exactly *how* a warning should be written as well as what situations to hand out warnings to avoid further conflicts of this nature.
I stand by my stance of "If it's enough to be deleted, it's enough to be recorded" with a notable exception for most spoilers.
<@&336302034070536192> Alright, gonna lift the ban on discussion since Saki has weighed in. I do agree with Saki, that with only one log, cast's post does deserve to be there, and we're not getting a second log regardless. Having some functionality where a warn doesn't send out a message might be nice, but I don't know how easy that is to do.
There. It's done. Step out, get a breath of fresh air, and just wait.
<@285555416056856576> <@!102691114762371072> <@456226577798135808> I'm going to say three things.

One: The job of a Custodian that sets them apart from Illuminati is the authority to moderate other moderators, *including other Custodians*

Two: Further discussion on the subject is going to end until all 4 of us have weighed in on how we should handle this. I believe that there should be a second log to keep track of minor offenses, and that cast's post should be recorded there. R believes that there should be only one log, and cast's post should not be recorded there. Lyssa's and Saki's stances will come when they can.

Three: Until Lyssa or Saki weigh in, any discussion on the topic will incur a warning. That goes for me as much as anyone else.
Okay, then the warn to cast is justified *because he posted a fucking suicide joke*
Alright, what do we do when a user posts a suicide joke one day. And then another day they post a rape joke. And then another day they make a holocaust joke? Do we just not record any of this?
Do you think it's a mistake to keep two logs?
I believe you're misreading the question, R. Lyssa said "Do you think it's a mistake to keep two logs" NOT "Do you think it's a mistake to put cast in the warn log"
was it
```The smell begins to envelop the room entirely, quickly waking up a very hungry Hibiki.```THE SEQUEL TO THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR: THE VERY HUNGRY HIBIKI
In any case, if we end up taking on more mods, I'll be looking for more custodians in the process. With just you two as mods I don't need to be held back *too* much but every additional moderator is an additional chance for me to be an idiot.
Do you wanna see it? It's pink and fluffy.
I am a custodian because I own the server. I'd honestly give ownership to Lyssa but she's not around enough. Lyssa is a custodian because she both literally and metaphorically can put a collar on me.
You may wonder: "but then why not make every mod a custodian" and the answer is because discord roles are fucking shit and I don't want to allow every mod to just create/remove other mods, because all it takes is one bad day for a single person to fuck everything up.
If I need to be told that I'm being an idiot, then Lyssa is there to *make* me stop being an idiot.
At all points, I am listening. I said it already: this server has a council, not an owner. The Custodian role exists to moderate the moderators, but that includes other Custodians and that is why we have two Custodians even though Lyssa isn't very active here.
Please understand that my first response will never be "shut up". I had to silence discussion because you were angry, I was tired, and nothing was going to happen so long as there wasn't a third voice.
I would like you to try and tone down the anger a bit, especially when we're speaking amongst ourselves in the sub. It's not very conductive to discussion, and you've been angry internally a lot lately.
In the end, hierarchies are shit. I'd rather a council than an owner for the server.
What I do want outlined though is

Situation assessment
Warning formatting
Miscellaneous rules that apply specifically to mods
do it however you want, I'm only asking for a draft right now. We can polish it up and make it sparkly afterwards.
You seem to have the most passion for this, and so I'd like to entrust the job to you.
Yes, but I'm stating it now because it's part of my second point. <@456226577798135808> I fully expect you to draft up some internal rules for dealing with all manner of offense, from misdemeanors to automatic bans.
We know that hazel is condescending sometimes. She sticks out. But she only sticks out because we communicate.
However, that means a new internal rule. If you *don't* share actions you've taken on behalf of the server here, you're not befitting of mod status. I'm going to make that very loud and very clear.
Assuming all mods are attentive and pay attention to this channel, simply posting here that a user has caused an issue of any magnitude may be sufficient as they will stand out.
I wanna get that logistics problem out of the way now, before we have to revisit it but with 700 members instead.
Okay, you do have a legitimate point R. I'm not going to say you don't. But how do we keep track of these things in the few months where we should be keeping track of them?
She
Not now kiri
Also, both of you, calm down a bit, please.
If the issue is the message sent, we can make sure that *every single time we warn someone* we follow up with a human message.
Again, we could probably automate it. If a given log is cleared after 6 months then whatever.

also if you want to change names of channels, throw those at me now
ultimately your choice, but something to think about
we like chaos
and this creates chaos
"dead say it's that dude"
so the mafia can just as easily say
unless someone else is also a medium
but no one can confirm it
So our medium can say "the dead totally think it's that dude"
because roles aren't revealed until you're dead
anyone can claim to be a medium
BUT
That's it
Speak to the dead
What can they do?
Like, look. Take the "useless" role from town of salem. The Medium.
through the use of bots we might be able to recreate something like tos even
I do think that anyone able to type in town shouldn't be able to see spectators and that any dead players get booted to spectators. Reason being we can do so much with the denial of information and we can expand the system to be `bigger and better`
tell me if you want their names changed
you should be able to see the 3 channels now
Well yes, but if we block off players from spectator chat, they can't be influenced by the people who are dead/just watching
or whatever you wanna call it
or the lobby chat
should mafia players be able to view the spectator chat?
The archives were hidden until handholding was introduced.
Categories can be hidden too

this was an idea weve actually had and decided was too ambitious for just me and R while focusing on other things

<@!102691114762371072> I'll be culling yugioh, mahjong, anime music quiz, osu, civilization, and overwatch. I kinda wanna get rid of OJ but I'm biased and wanna use it at least once. Can you remove those roles from the role assignment message and kiri's assignable roles before I try breaking her?
I'll get to work on cutting out useless roles and then I'll let you handle the color stuff Saki
Now then, as for role trimming and color separation...
@everyone y'all should see <#463797975894851598> now I'll get rid of it once its purpose is complete.
Hmm... do we even need a special role for this? Know what, lemme just create a temporary channel, because I think actually talking to 98 is gonna get us the furthest.
And the focus is no longer on the sub itself
Also I'm axing the subreddit mod role. It made sense when I made the server but all staff are sub mods anyway
Also opens possibilities for adding more reps than just 8
I'd also like to split gear user roles from their colors. We'd migrate the colors onto their own roles since more than one person has expressed wanting to be a different color than their rep gives them.
although that sounds a bit weird
"Incarnation of Fine"
She was sciencey but also an antagonist, as a contrast to Elfnein
that's why our bot was ryouko
I wanted to make us the custodians and illuminati
Since I was splitting off of valk and they had their x-drive and dainsleif roles
The theme of the server (which has since been lost a bit) was originally "the antagonists"
R, stop channelling Gilgamesh
A bit more thought could go into it than "gold sticker"
No one used that role other than ibu
We could theoretically then revive ping for pics but
We could add that along with an opt in role for something like "image editor"
I'd like something a bit more on theme but that's a start
Legacy roles are exactly as they say. Legacy.
No legacy roles have been added or removed since we redid the system
But that'd be diluted
If you make things, sign yourself up as a creator
But maybe something like a "Creator" role to opt into?
I'd say: If someone does things for the server directly, we can give them an honor role  to say "We appreciate you"
Just for people on the server
Not to my knowledge
Well... 98 actually hasn't done anything for the server itself as of yet
Basically, what should we do for a "this person contributes to the server" role?
Well, no. I definitely know I don't wanna force them into the position.
But I dunno if I wanna force 98 into that position.
Previously we kinda just... made people who did things for the server into staff

outside998, Maria obsessed - Today at 3:15 PM
@⚧ Yuri Girl (Alice) I am not quite sure where to put it, so I will do it here: I did some picture edits already with photoshop and premiere for you guys and I am sometimes even asked on this server to edit some stuff, like memes, for example. I really like doing it and would love to continue doing it for you guys. So, would it be possible to get a role in that regard or maybe just an announcement for it of some sort, just so people know they can ping me for this stuff?
⚧ Yuri Girl (Alice) - Today at 3:17 PM
That definitely warrants a special role, but I'll want some time to think over the details of the role.```98 brings up an interesting thing here, and I definitely wanna give them a role to acknowledge it, but how far should we go with this role? Having a special role reserved for people who do things for the server would be nice.
Just don't be afraid to ask saki for help because having bots handle the roles would make life easier
In any case, you should be able to make the roles yourself
Alright
okay i know he's on the autoban list but ***what***
btw <@!102691114762371072> the subreddit feed broke
In any case, I have writing to focus on if I ever wanna get paid, and I've not accomplished nearly enough with this community to confidently say I could make one bigger.
I'll face reality when I have to.
dess_. Alice You Should know by now that I'm not sane.
i'm making it a quote
<@!102691114762371072> can we put that in as a quote
that's a quote
Fucking
You should know by now that I'm not sane.
You've seen and heard about the limits of my conviction. It might be arrogant to say so, but if anyone could do that, it's me. I've already devoted myself to helping as many people as I can, and creating a large and welcoming community is certainly something I'm willing to attempt.
It's definitely possible.
It's possible.
I mean. We've tempered Wien.
In any case, I wouldn't ask anyone to come with me, and that's assuming I do it at all. But creating a community where ignoring the uncomfortable bits isn't possible... I think I could do that in the future.
...i've been rambling
And the responses I've gotten to Prologue are encouraging.
But even with just symphogear... over 100 views on both Double Date and Prologue. That's a lot to me. It's validating.
I should probably talk to Colleen about expanding my influence. I do want to reach a large audience with my writing.
If it were an original story, anyone could access it, and those that cared would be able to feel the messages that I sent in my storytelling.
In all honesty, I'd rather have written transbiki as an original story, but I have no name yet. No one would pay attention.
And setting an example is a good start
There are lots of good people out there who simply don't understand their own actions
But a server that can properly approach that media, and allow others to witness how to have respectful discourse
That seems like it could influence something
Also I'm not sure I'd want to run a trans server at all. Normalizing good behavior and shunning bad on a server that might otherwise allow the bad
that would be something
Most explicitly trans servers fall to a few particular faults, so I have no interest in creating a server like that, but... if I could do "/r/anime, but without transphobia"
We've been doing well. Maybe one day I'll plant the seeds for another community, one with greater reach than Symphogear.
I'm sure I've said it before, but my objective in taking this community under my wing was to create "the good anime server"
what is even the context of this
i thought JT was one of yours
i
the pact is sealed
for whatever announcement you're gonna make for this, mention how blowing shit up is patriotic
okay but only on one condition
...what are you planning

...you mean trump? Or was obama in gx?
Lemme go check that real quick, hang on.
I don't interact there, and I wouldn't be particularly sad if I got removed.
To watch.
Why would I want to be on a server run by people who are complicit with transphobes?
But beyond that, it stays in the server.
I'll do nothing. If I see them *being* a transphobe, and not merely saying transphobic things, I'll deal with them.
^
Because I'm not concerned with encouragement as it occurs beyond the server. It's not something I can control. I can, however, control the access of people who've shown more internalized levels of transphobia.

Transphobia outside of the server = Deal with it when they bring it in here
Transphobes outside of the server = Get out

One does not need to be a transphobe to make a transphobic statement.
If I were to ban usage of slurs outside the server in general, no one would be left, including myself.
Val Verde gets caught on 2, dubs gets caught on 1.
The important factor here is he is not 1) calling anyone in particular a tranny and 2) not decrying "trannies" as a group
You mean within?
If he said it here, instant ban. Given 4chan culture, I'm willing to ignore it as long as it's not brought here.
here's miganon's post
More severe usage of the word would warrant a ban, admin or not.
I didn't say I wouldn't ban Miganon. I said I wouldn't ban Miganon for what I found.
circles, chris, joe, and kaliks are all confirmably fine. Sparkle is a "probably". Kazanari Anon and Friendposter I would not hesitate to boot given evidence. I don't have sufficient evidence for either, however.
I know for a fact that circles is not a transphobe. Lemme go take a look through the others.
With sufficient logs, yes. I will ban transphobes who refuse to change their ways, I'm not interested in winning hearts and minds.
Rule 1 is "Don't be a dick", and a dick is still a dick even if they're simply playing nice. I've said it before in <#336297840529899522>, that a transphobe is a transphobe and if you're a transphobe hanging around the server, either change your ways or change your location. I won't go actively seeking stuff out, and before someone is kicked for transgressions beyond the server I do want something solid to work off of (eg, Val Verde's comment about "tranny infestations" and dubs's general history of using the word frequently), but I have no desire to play host to transphobes much as I have no desire to play host to transphobia.
From how far I looked back, the only other person I'd be looking to ban would be Miganon, but given his total of zero messages on the server, the comparatively mild usage of the word on the /sgg/ server, and his standing within the /sgg/ server, I'm willing to give him a pass as long as we're gonna play nice with the admin chat.
There are a few other people here from /sgg/ but whether their usage of the word was less virulent or their existence here is for whatever reason more excusable, they get a pass for now. I was only scanning for people using the word in a directed manner, not those who simply used the word which, while bad, is a byproduct of 4chan culture and may be more easily cured than those who actively spout bullshit, as well as carrying a lesser risk of hanging out here solely to dig up shit on our trans members.
Val Verde has only said the word once on the /sgg/ server and has been mildly active here in the past. While what he said is worse, I'm more willing to hear from someone who might be conscious of their actions than I am from someone who just regurgitates bullshit.
It's in my nature. Val Verde gets more wiggle room than Dubs.
I'll give them a kick so that they can explain themselves one time, but after that it's a permaban.
Both on 4/30
twice
Yes. Val Verde has spoken a few times, (15 pages total in search history) and dubs has spoken...
No fanfare, no ban, just a kick that they can find out the reason for on their own if they want to.
Should I toss these two into the garbage?


If I'm the only one, then I have no choice but to shoulder that responsibility. I've discarded sanity long ago, so while that statement may be insane, it doesn't matter to me. If I can I must.
And by that same token, I might be the only person fit for the role of many other things. Or at least one of only a handful.
I may be the only person fit for the role of writing that AU.
How many others exist?
But I'm a queer writer who is a fan of symphogear.
There are many queer writers. There are many symphogear writers. And there are many queer symphogear fans.
```Latooni - Last Monday at 11:54 PM

Latooni said something to me the other day. Let me dig it up.
I may be one of only a few people who can handle it.
And for someone with that drive to spread her message, combined with the inability to work
I actually said it in fancontent earlier today.```AO3: Me obsessively refreshing my own fics because I gain power from attention```To me, I'll take even negative attention. So long as people are looking at me, there is a chance that I can spread my message.
So I can't accept "it's not worth it" at face value.
As for managing large servers... no matter what, I'm still an insane optimist.
I mean. They're not. But as long as they've been brought up, I wanna get on the same page with that shit. They're specific to just about everything.
It's an important question and I wanted to ask it before we got lost in the rest of the discussion tomorrow.
```that is not being honest with the core principles of the server```What precisely are the core principles of this server *to you*? I'll leave my response to whatever you say for tomorrow.
Oh, R. I know you said tomorrow, but can I ask you that one thing right now while it's still today ~~at least for Saki~~?
But we discussed it between me and Saki so might as well get R's opinion too
Yeah, I don't think we need more than 3 right now.
And for Elise? I said she has my vote as long as Saki would vouch for her, which he did.
~~did it for the bots~~

<@456226577798135808> Alright, I took some advil and I'm in a better state of mind. Do you feel like continuing the discussion in full right now or do you want to do that later? If later, feel free to poke me whenever, but I'll be out of the house for a bit tomorrow.
It is one thing I would like to clarify, but if you'd prefer discussing everything all at once, then we can leave it for now.
I will entertain exactly one thing you've said right now, but please for the love of god, bring the rest up later. Is that okay?
You're not going to get any information through to someone who is not accepting information at the moment. Going on is just going to be wasted effort on your part when it can be brought up along with the internal rules. I have a headache, just let me rest.
Please bring it up along with the internal rules. It is late and I would rather be doing something else right now.
Then why do you keep going with this? I'm not interested in hearing it right now.
I already said you win.
R, I already said I'm not interested in arguing. Drop it. Spend that energy towards drafting the internal rules like you said you were going to do.
The rules are explicitly "Don't be a dick". Not "Don't act like a dick", it's "Don't be a dick". These two were not active members. If they were, I'd talk to them first. I talked to Symphogi first when it came up. But fine, I'm not interested in arguing.
1) Val Verde and dubs were not banned and both can contact me asking what's up. 2) If anyone shows any capacity for improvement, as Symphogi has done, I'm not going to call them a bigot, just a work in progress.
I have, in fact, changed Symphogi's mind on the word trap. So he's not a lost cause even if he might say something offensive once in a while.
Or Symphogi, but Symphogi has proven that he's capable of understanding.
They also actually don't do anything, aside from fishsicles, who is not on sgg
Yeah, and I feel no obligation to thank them for it.
The second Johnny piped up with his bullshit on valk I decided I was done. I just haven't handed them a resignation letter.
I'm watching for now, but I don't do anything for them.
yttt is in fact majority sgg. That being said, I don't actually do anything for them after the last bullshit that went down on valk.
Gonna grab each color directly from the user's gear.
I'll set up the color roles later. I have Ideas
I might be the only person who even cares a little about legacy roles. So I'll axe them.
If we're gonna separate gear reps and colors...
Lighter discussion that I feel we could discuss while I'm out: should we remove legacy roles?

```TO-DO:
1. Discussion on the core principles of the server, and how to make them work for us.
2. Internal rules draft and discussion.

I do find the custodian solution appealing. It allows us to protect ourselves while avoiding abuse of power.
I'd wanna talk with her first, but that's an option.
I could drop Lyssa to Illuminati and promote one of you.
Yes, that is why Lyssa is a custodian and why I mentioned I'd be looking for a new custodian if we ever expanded ranks.
A custodian cannot judge their own situation, so it's important to have more than one custodian at any given time.
If any of us have a problem, we take it to a custodian.
re: the issue of impetus
That I agree with. But what happens when one of us is the user? If I feel something a user has said on another server is threatening to me, then who do I turn to?

My suggestion on that would be another custodian. As I've said before, custodians exist to manage the server, and as part of managing the server, they manage other moderators.
y'all said shit but i was still typing so
That it can be all fabricated or twisted out of context?
So those 3 guidelines are set, we all see reason within them and we all agree with them, correct?
Okay.
I see reason in both arguments, but let's amend 2 to say
```2. if they have harassed users in the past before and are not seeking reform, OR if they are seeking reform and the previously harassed user cannot forgive them, within reason```
Something like that, although probably worded a bit differently
Alright. I fully agree with 3, and I fully agree with 1, but I don't fully agree with 2 for reasons mentioned above. Let's use a similar example.

A and B are on a server together, where A also exists on our server. B begins harassing A on the other server, they get banned from that server, and that's it for a while. 2 years later, B has realized that they were a piece of shit and has repented and reformed. B joins our server. A immediately identified B as the harassing shitbag from 2 years ago, *however* B wishes to repair that relationship since they have realized the error of their ways.
My issues with the outline are:

1. number 2 requires more nuance
2. the outline must be more robust in order to facilitate the removal of people who don't deserve to be here, regardless of their interaction with the server or its inhabitants.
So we need a better outline.
Yes, but that outline misses all of them.
Member of ICE? Banned, don't care what you're here for.
If banning the president of the united states of america is wrong then I will face god and walk backwards into hell.
I think 2 needs more nuance, and ultimately none of the outlines prevent, say, Donald Trump from hanging around on the server even though, and I'm gonna say it now, Donald Trump is fucking banned for being a fascist piece of shit.
Let's say Riya joins the server. Riya doesn't have a tumblr, twitter, anything that she could contact DL on, but she comes here *explicitly* to apologize to DL for being a shitbag. We would ban her under 2, but if she's here for reform, that would be a bad call to make.
Rereading it, I think I have more of an idea there with 3. You can continue typing, but I'll give an example of where 2 can go wrong.
I feel a combination of 1 and 3 does all the work that 2 does, with less chance of axing someone who's looking for reform.
Doesn't 3 cover that?
dogrunes is allowed because he got his act together.
bwen was banned for activity on the server. There was context behind it, but in the end he WAS given a chance.
I maintain that anyone we could justifiably ban under the second rule could more easily be banned under the first. I want an example of a case where that might not hold.
In fact, I'd go as far as to say that number 2 isn't a good justification at all. dogrunes has harassed me in the past, but we're friends now so there's no issue. 2 only holds if the user is still hostile, which would fall more under 1 if you ask me.
I was fully prepared to let him show his merits, but it took him 2 messages to fuck up.
Well, we actually gave him the boot for harassing a user on the server.
My feet hurt btw
<@456226577798135808> <@!102691114762371072>
The rest of everything I agree with. It makes sense and the only changes I'd make to the explanation are for parts that would need modification due to a "no bigots" clause
```a safe, progressive place where people arent drowned out by the bad garbage your average anime fan spews, and making sure that the rights are in place where every user can defend themselves while we as moderators remain consistent, strict, and guiding towards those principles. by establishing those rights, the user does not have to fear persecution for things that happen outside of this place unless there exist extrenuating circumstances for it.```
This is good, but it's missing a certain clause that I would like to add. I don't just want people to be protected here, I want *non-bigoted* people to be protected here. I'm not setting out to change hearts and minds here, and if someone thinks "all trannies are degenerates" or "america's problems would go away if there weren't so many niggers" then they can get the fuck out, whether they express those views or not. This brings up the issue: when do we expel a user for beliefs expressed beyond the server's confines? I'll admit yesterday's kicks *may* not have been justified, and I propose that we should draft up a list of criteria a user must meet before we show them the door for being a piece of shit, even if they're a well behaved piece of shit.
I'm home, not overheated, and I've told my dad to fuck off forever. Let's get to business.
okay
If you have a trans person that had undergone GRS and a cancer patient that had a tumor removed sitting next to each other, *the trans person would say that their surgery was worth it more often than the cancer patient would*
Because I didn't until just now.
Did you know that GRS has a higher satisfaction rate than tumor excision?
I am home and my father thinks he has the moral high ground when speaking to me.
We were also making internal rules.
For the first point, fair. I mistook your first message in the DM to mean something else.

For the second point, ironically, last night might be a perfect example. I brought something up, you agreed, and if it weren't for R, we'd just be tossing people out who might not warrant being tossed out.

For the third point, there is probably a difference in how people view the roles which contributes to *something*, but also valid.
If Saki isn't back in 15 minutes we're legally allowed to make Ryouko a custodian
<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
And my biases should be held under *significantly* more scrutiny than either of yours given the situation.
Now, if both of you had voted for the same person, that would be an easy call. But if both of you had voted for each other, yourselves, or neither... I still wouldn't have promoted R immediately. Because I hold my biases as well.
But, yeah. We're at a standstill no matter what.
CAPE!
I cannot push the role onto R if he does not want it.
And even if Saki rescinds his vote, *it's still a difficult call* because something like this can't be decided with democracy alone.
Yeah. It would be A Situation.
While Saki and I clash heads less often, I would want a Custodian who is fully capable of keeping me in check, and I don't think Saki is up to that task. Not yet, at least.
And I voted for R
Saki: Reluctantly voted for Saki, because while he did not feel fit for the job, we had been talking about contingency plans for if R fucked off. While R has stated his dedication to the server, having a situation reach the point where a contingency plan needs to be discussed at all is still a valid reason.

R: Voted for no one, as Saki is not yet experienced enough, but he could not in good faith vote for himself given the times I've had to pull him back.
And, since we're now at this point, I'll reveal what the votes were between you two.
Between the three of us, Latooni seemed to be the favorite for a moderator role, and so if we cannot decide between us, we go to the next best person.
OPTION 1: We ask Lyssa to weigh in.

OPTION 2: We ask *Latooni* to weigh in.
<@456226577798135808> <@!102691114762371072> Both of you have DMed me, and... the answer is not simple. Not that I expected it to be. As I see it, we have two options.
Now then, since we've suddenly come into need for another custodian, *and the only two options are you guys* I'm gonna ask a simple question before anything else. Between the two of you, I'd like you each to DM me which one you think would be a better fit for the custodian role.

2 is still a bit shaky imo but we can polish that with the draft. I think the intent of the rule is expressed fine.
That all look good?
```1. if they are actively targeting our server by either getting details on users to doxx or just preparing something hostile
2. if they have harassed users in the past before and are not seeking reform, OR if they are seeking reform and the previously harassed user cannot forgive them, within reason
3. if they are reported directly to us for hostile behavior in places we cannot see. this one is important, and sometimes it crops up. If the reporting user is a moderator, the issue MUST be resolved by a custodian, and the reporting user CANNOT be the acting custodian```
On it.
Alright. Can we get a modified version of the outlines down here for now and then we can polish it up with the draft over the weekend?
Alright. And then that covers any other instances of "this user is literally an ICE agent", right?
So for instance, I can't kick anyone just because I feel like it and I'm a custodian. Another custodian has to agree.
Alright. So we're making that the rule then? If an issue occurs beyond our jurisdiction, the moderator may bring it up with any custodian *except* themselves.
Numbers regardless, I don't think having 3 custodians and 1 illuminati is that bad, so even if Lyssa is left as a custodian it should be fine.
And that's percent of total users
Valk is lower only in percentage
So
Valk has 7 staff for not many more members than we have, and they still have constant problems
Considering the non-stratified hierarchy, I think we could do fine with 2 custodians, 1 illuminati, and Lyssa wherever she pleases
Thicker meaning more mods?
We accomplished something AT LEAST once
cross-server admin chat*
There's a cross-server chat and R does not hesitate to tell the Valkyrie server that they're doing a bad job.
R has also agreed to be both less angry and less shouty, yeah
R gets angry and shouty sometimes but other than that no
It's fun once you accept that all mobage suck anyway and FGO is probably tied for first with GBF
I've been playing FGO too much
`The Holy Grail War Begins`
Lyssa isn't active enough and we've come to a point where we need another active Custodian, and so
Including other Custodians, but NOT themselves.
For Illuminati vs Custodian, the key difference is that Custodians also moderate other moderators.
No thats for Illuminati vs Alchemist
ha HA didn't think I'd pull that one did ya
Once you're caught up, I want everyone to cast votes again - except this time Latooni is also a candidate.
You can read the backlog for context or I can sum it up for you
but the most important Stuff right now is that we need to decide on a third Custodian. Saki voted for himself, R voted for no one, and I voted for R.
yeah there's Stuff
But there's another matter at hand right now
I'd give you Illuminati immediately
i uh
<@99695384296701952> WELCOME CANDIDATE #48
Alright
Alright. I will `prepare the ceremony`
Along with that, I have one more proposition. I think it's hardly appropriate to ask Latooni to weigh in without also offering him the chance of actually being a mod as well. Are we going to make that offer?
Alright. My vote is for Lyssa, but I am outnumbered.
Your vote is for Latooni, R?
With that all being said, are we ready to make the next choice?
The reason I vote for R over you is less "I think Saki is inexperienced" and more "I think having someone who's less like me is better"
I've said it before. If I'm the only one who can do something, then I am responsible for seeing it done.
So if one Custodian steps out of line, I am always willing to make a call.
In the end, I *do* have ultimate power here and I *do* intend to use it solely for the betterment of the server.
The good thing about a conversation where only 4 people can see it is that no one can come in and ruin everything by making the chat faster
But I want either Lyssa's or Latooni's judgment before I finalize anything.
You both are.
You are in consideration.
As I said, they manage the server itself.
For rules that apply to the users, Custodians get more power.
Rules that apply to us as moderators.
there's the emphasis tho
"I'd very much like to *gain* legislative experience, and a small community that I'm ***heavily*** invested in seems like the ideal stomping grounds for that sort of thing."
I can't add emphasis in the middle of ` quotes tho
As an additional comment from both Saki and R,

Saki: `I'd very much like to gain legislative experience, and a small community that I'm heavily invested in seems like the ideal stomping grounds for that sort of thing.`
R: `i feel this may be the only direction to take at this rate, and ill just have to focus on thoroughly toning down my anger.`
Saki: Himself
R: Himself
Latooni: R if he votes for himself, Saki if R votes otherwise
Me: R
Alright, you've all DMed me. Shall I reveal the votes?
And yes, Latooni is a valid choice, just in case anyone has forgotten.
Same as the first round, DM me your votes, they can be someone else, yourself, no one, or multiple people!
I would say before we get into that discussion, we have another round of votes.
Custodians also have more sway in server rule changes, but Illuminati and Alchemists do get a voice there.
Well there's not much of a hierarchy here either. For most matters, everyone gets equal say. Only when those matters involve another moderator do Custodians hold more sway.
Just about, yeah.
(do keep in mind, you CAN vote for either no one or more than one person)
here being this channel, I assume
there was this thing where R just basically kept yelling the same two things for about 2 hours while I attempted damage control while digging up evidence from month old conversations
uhhhhhhhh k
Anyway, yeah. The usual answer of "I'm the owner" doesn't work, so while I CAN cordon off immediate damage to the userbase, it could set up some tricky situations internally.
<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
i think reins
reigns? reins?
And since the promotion is ostensibly to put reigns on *me*, then simply saying "I'm the owner so if you do that you get demoted" doesn't actually work.
that. That's the concern. The bossiness.
`it's per se`
Mostly him coming in angry one day, screaming "Y'ALL DON'T KNOW SHIT" and proceeding to... do something. I dunno exactly what, but as Saki said, that itself is concerning.
I think it was a good plan given that we already trusted him to be a mod anyway.

Not 100% confirmed, and also never tell an egg that they're an egg, but Chad is displaying `the signs`
I found an egg.

that'll take a bit
i uh
that thing
that
oh
is this another thing i learn about 10 minutes before it happens
what has happened thus far
uhhhh
`a dark and varied future`
Originally we just had an admin DM, but you can't have more than 10 people in one of those.
which we didn't intend it to be, but whatever
but the admin channel isn't accessible to everyone, because the server is ALSO the wiki server
Because discord is ass
We have to wait for Symphogi to give you the admin role for the admin chat part of that server.
Oh, <@99695384296701952> here's a link to the admin chat/wiki server. There's a wiki by the way. We're working on it. Don't tell people it exists yet. https://discord.gg/nFPzPa
Lemme just take a moment to pre-write an announcement and then I'll get everyone updated
But okay, Latooni for Illuminati it is
He's already gone mad with power.
*what*
However, as a newly minted Custodian, R needs to weigh in.
I'm comfortable with Latooni as Illuminati.
They're janitors, but janitors who get an actual say in the mod chat.

I think so but they can't kick or ban
I know, but again. R has proved his experience on more than one occasion, and while temper is an issue, I think he'd be the most suited to keeping me in check and making sure things are carried out with sound reasoning. As for Latooni, does anyone have any objections to him becoming Illuminati straight away?
Fuck KiD
Unlike fucking KiD
Anyway, while it looks like R is being promoted to Custodian this time, I'm gonna keep note of Saki's comment, as it's a good thing to be invested in the community you fucking moderate
I'll be here to say "no you're wrong" occasionally but mostly just listening
I'll say they publicly.
<@!102691114762371072> should I start calling you "she" until you figure your identity out
I guess. I dunno how else to word it tho
some nb people don't identify as trans, but most do and most think nb implies trans
...wouldn't that just make you closeted because coming out is too much effort?
i checked
I have found zero instances of me saying egg in reference to you
I think it was just last night, and mostly because `:sakiegg:`
did i?
I am hesitant to label people as eggs
Saki also didn't read as particularly eggy to me until like, last night
you're unusually good about a lot of things for a cis person but that's just like

education
also <@99695384296701952> you don't really seem eggy to me

They mentioned that it was "a very hard decision" for them
"Afraid of Quinn" no
"Afraid that she might stop promoting the sub" sure
You say afraid a lot but I was never really afraid of Quinn
Like leaving me out of the rules...
No I meant the before subreddit stuff
Wait you didn't mention why we hate Valkyrie
But R can get into that
I was handed the SONG role upon arrival on the server, was immediately set up with some moderator powers (which I even helped them tune because I felt I was given too much power!) and then promptly left out of discussion.
January
Joined At:
January 25th 2017, 2:37 am
As for prior to this server's existence... I was with Valkyrie for a while. I think since March that year?
July 20 las year
This discord was created June 20 last year
Those came later
There weren't any *direct* threats while I was still with Valkyrie.
*they did not tell me this until I was long gone*
``` they never truly believed themselves to be a part of the subreddit community```that? like one or two month old information
Keep in mind, this is the updated version of events. A lot of that paragraph is based on new information.
Also because symphogi is actually an alright person.
Remember the whole "demote people on a whim" thing? That's why I'm at the top. I just asked and it was done in two seconds.
yep
And everyone in the thread was invited
I just pointed out that someone else should ask
I actually didn't even ask
The command is enabled everywhere in the server, but I encourage you to only use the command itself in this channel, and then any public followups as necessary.
But for right now, if a user has earned a warning but nothing else, dess_warn [user] [reason] is the command
We do! And that's part of the internal rule draft that I've asked R to work on.
But that's mostly precautionary.
Nothing really. We're currently working on ways to make sure we can handle any new members stirring shit easily and effectively.
To the server?
I told them to fuck off with that shit and made this place.
Anyway, that's about it. They shut me out from server discussion, on a server that at least wanted to pretend to be affiliated with my subreddit.
Too old, I'll have to ask bingo for logs
dig something up from the old admin chat
Lemme just uh
Hecate still isn't over it, so if Hecate ever shows her face here she either better be ready to apologize or she better be ready to get booted.
*They went fucking ballistic that I'd have the gall to take my community, listed on my subreddit, into my own hands*
Anyway, between "spooooooky" and "fuck you" I said "later", made my own community, and told them that I updated the link on the subreddit to point here instead of there.
bingo actually is a dick
bingo is often a dick
Bingo proceeded to be a dick
So I asked bingo for clarification because Geno was an idiot
I didn't like that too much.
Anyway, I was told that my rules wouldn't be considered. Shortly thereafter, Geno, who is an unstable headcase that frequently bails on valkyrie and then shows back up when the next season starts and is *immediately* handed back her admin role, decided to be all ~mysterious~ and ~vague~ about shit
Yes. Rule 5 is basically "If you're out of line in a way that the rule list doesn't capture, but we still need to moderate you, we'll make an excuse"
I was told "that's too much" and "that's too extreme" and that my rules would not be considered.
Rules 1 and 5 here.
I suggested 2 rules
At some point, they asked the lower mod chat for rule input.
Now, mind you, I was allowed access to the lower mod chat, but NOT the higher mod chat, despite having higher mod powers.
At some point around June/July, they began working on updating their rule list.
When I joined, their rules were shit, because Khairz doesn't speak English.
But lets talk specifically about the rules.
For context, I'd created this server twice and deleted it before I actually launched it. They had been so historically bad to me that, on multiple occasions, I thought "yeah I'm out"
Alright, so. Let's talk about the last straw that actually got this server going.
No, THEIR rule revision
Oh, insta bans are pending review actually
yeah you missed the whole "rule revision" thing
Nothing was done, not even a warning.
bingo told me himself "yes that is blatant transphobia"
All involved users are still active.
It started with literal rape apology and then got dialed down to just blatant transphobia.
I'm only in there because I want at least one subreddit rep in there
Saki bounced, Lyssa bounced, R bounced for a while
You don't have to join.
We have a higher active population by percent of total users.
Even that's debatable.
We get more complaints about their server than they do
Editors note: They spent 4 days talking about nothing before they did it
```Icebingo - 06/04/2018
You could not be sassy about it at least. Its not like we spent 4 days talking about nothing before we did it.
Symphogi - 06/04/2018
oh I sort of mentally skipped over that
since I had to role beard
Yuri Girl - 06/04/2018
Sorry.
Icebingo - 06/04/2018
Its fine, its just, a bit high stress/emotional i guess from having to do this at all.(edited)```
literally what i typed here
ibu isn't on valk right this second
<@!102691114762371072> Is your sudden existential crisis over being called she a publicly known event
Once we have the internal rules set up we can visit that particular issue but for now it's best to just avoid conflict
<@!102691114762371072> until we have our internal rules set up, don't publicly shit talk valk please. I personally don't care for their twisted standards, but they take moderators shitting on other discords seriously for some reason

So... <@!102691114762371072> don't think I'm playing GW2 any time soon after all
one of shirabe's commands requires her to be able to see every channel
oh and bots i guess
there's actually 2 extra channels that only custodians can see for both XV and XV raws
ok
What do we do after telling them? chance or ban?
I'll suggest they should be given one chance to make an INCREDIBLY convincing case but you get final say
alright
And also, since it happened can you take a look at the screenshots from a few days ago concerning val and dubs <@456226577798135808>? Should they remain out or should we give them a chance?
Alright. Saki, can you go into more detail about your issue with Bisa for context?
"wouldn't lose sleep" isn't a very strong opinion, so i think he warrants removal from the list in that case
Okay, prepping for dilation, but I'll quickly note up some stuff on the autoban list for <@456226577798135808> to take a look at when he can. For all of this, consider me as a reporting user while you are an acting custodian.

Riya - Literal rape apologist, perceived transphobe. Don't think I need receipts for this one.
Rosael - Blatant transphobe. Search them up in Valk's serious-business, they don't speak much.
Bisa - Perceived transphobe. Iffy on this one, Bisa just has consistently bad opinions and I'm not sure if they're bad enough to warrant an autoban.
Xaxas - Same as Bisa. You know them better than I do.
Johnny - Another iffy transphobe. They said their shit on the day before Riya's rape apology.
I'll revise the autoban list with R once I get back
Anyway, I have to go brush my teeth and dilate
pretty much
If absolutely necessary, the command can be used in a public channel, but more often I'd like the command to be used here and then in public just say "You've been sent a warning, please don't do this again, etc"
No. It sends a DM and confirms that the warn was sent within the channel it was used.
deployed, sure
why can't i move units that are being repaired
i wanna reorder my echelons to be less derp but everything is constantly being repaired
so ill do it here since saki can empathize
and it hardly seems like a live shitposting thing
i dont wanna clutter gaming up with me screaming random shit about gfl
It used to be Chris
Mine is half of a gay picture drawn with trans colors
i dont wnana post this in fancontent since it's only related but aaaaaaaaaaa getting messages like this gives me life
https://twitter.com/FalconTG/status/1015718249772847105 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
they is always safe but i wanna use saki's preferred pronouns so she can feel validated <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
she/her?
remind me again, which pronouns do i use for you publicly?
i wont use theirs out of respect but i also wont be all "yes i will allow 2 people to dictate an aspect of my server"
honestly? the gif is from the show. Just clip it and crop it yourself and I'll throw it on here
transphobic sure
honestly it surprises me anyone in yttt is homophobic given how louis is
fucking pimsan found my twitter
Or do you wanna just let it accumulate
<@456226577798135808> shoud I explicitly ask bingo to say something about Khairz's statements?
that's good, yeah
Should <#458060276550336522> be renamed to #nonsymphogear-fancontent?
good morning everyone i can't wait for bingo or beard to attempt damage control
i went wizard for ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ
http://maplestory2.nexon.net/en/microsite/tournament# TIME FOR VOTING
is xenoblade for ps4?
Let me rephrase. How do I get 2-4, 2-5, and 2-6 done.
what level should i try and attempt 2-6 at so I can get equipment stuff?
basic
exp sim
i cant complete the sim, does that matter?
autobattles?
whats the best way of leveling up an echelon?
`along with lee-enfield`
MP5 or PP-90 from my next construction
i havent found myself running low on contracts to begin with though
and then drop the 1-1 once im done with dailies
I'll do 1-1 and 1-4 instead then
i thought it was a requirement
thats a reward?
oh, wait
is it me or do the early logistics suck ass
unless she is unusually good
L85A1 seems to also suck
whats the one smg that works with ak-47
oh
is Galil better than AK-47?
oh, good, because stats are impossible to compare in this game
im so confused about which guns are good or not because i never look at stats
long as wherever isn't an echelon that's deployed
but no, you can totally put units in the repair bay wherever you want
i figured that since you can't upgrade units that are being repaired you wouldnt be able to move them either
nevermind im an idiot
but *repairs*
Anyway, feel free to split the roles and colors yourself if we're sticking with the current colors
miku > hibiki > kanade > tsubasa > maria > kirika > shirabe > chris
i had it going by character relations
your order is "dmjii at the top"
i had them in a specific order and you just tore it apart
saki changed it
i actually put purple at the top
also we're splitting colors from reps, because more than one person is like "i really wanna be red but the role list forces me to be green"
ok i mostly just wanted to make it easier to differentiate between yttt and hibiki/kanade
ugh i should get to making the color roles
R wants to fuck her but he doesn't want to be a necrophiliac
Even saying that, Lena ALSO shouldn't have the spotlight she does. Faye and Frederica are perfectly fit for the role and Rakhi wouldn't be bad now that we've gotten mostly past the non stop talking stage
I might wanna drop anyway. Between my schedule being unpredictable, sessions taking forever, and everyone else participating being totally new other than latooni I'm not having a lot of fun with it.
It just randomly gets written off for life
Monday seems like a bad day for me.
Also WHOOPS might have just sacrificed next week's session. I've gotta see my psychiatrist and I'm overdue.
I based Lena's gauntlet off of Gen's, which is why I made her Gen's daughter
Gen has the gauntlet! In non canon
All female casts definitely attract trans people
And that was a while back.
Do I just have an egg cracking aura or is it the high representation of trans people here that gets work done? I cracked Lyssa too.
My plan unfolds
ill take a look at the chat once im dressed
i have unique reasons for being an alice! I'm different!

🥚
There are no cars full of immigrants. Just handfuls of people who made it this far looking for work.
He lives in *Jew town central*
i mean ill always have food
$60 will unlock everything for me
7760 gems to unlock everything
i dont even have anything to build them with OR anything to throw them out, but the temptation  to buy more echelons is strong
Alright
I guess
since there will be the normal orange override anyway
We can do that, but if we do that let's merge kanade and hibiki's colors
personally
I like the sound of "gungnir orange"
we have a total of one person repping kanade colors
leave the kanade rep but it doesn't need its own color
just name the colors "gungnir orange", "ichaival red" etc
i think we could do with merging the two
Instant kick if the user is relatively new. If they're established and we know that we can talk sense into them, just a warning and a DM will do.
Yeah, I'd say that crosses the dick line pretty hard
But I'm only willing to enforce the suicide jokes right now.
I hate pepe memes and I hate suicide jokes
issue in particular is
My first instinct is a "no don't do that"
Namely "i'm gonna kill myself" rather than "you should go kill yourself"
@here what is our stance on suicide jokes
とてもかわいい！
I got it after my first surgery where I needed a lot of clothes that didn't go over my head
i have one like that!
What's song doing in a noise free world?
Would noise still exist in 20 years
Lena is a monster, but with the current system, she could lose to Rakhi if I got unlucky
That's the word. I want things to give me a modifer instead of just extra dice
Modifers. That's it.
Having a "my roll is AT LEAST 5 every time" is good imo
Even if I took 10 dice, I can still get a low number
I guess what I'd like more is a system with constants
I'd rather the GM arbitrated stuff
Also, I'm not too fond of dice combat because it discourages combat RP
More*
A smaller group could now easily reschedule too
I might participate in a smaller session, or just one where everyone has more experience with the format
"yes she's better now, that doesn't mean much"
I like the character archetype of "asshole who gets better" but I wanted to subvert the typical "gets better" part
I would never want to make Lena diplomatic. Just less of an asshole.
separate server works. I just wouldn't want it to look like "yeah we broke up this session so we could run our own session"
"hey guys the 4 mods are just gonna... have a tabletop session I guess"
Also will we be using tabletops for it?
if we used saki's setting, would we still be fighting noise
i'd be fine with either
and being as strong as Lena is, there needs to be some huge personality flaw
in a party of 3 being a loner is kind of a shit hand
maybe not
ehhhhhhhhh maybe
If you use Aegis I'd wanna be Lena again
With only 4 people it wouldn't be terribly hard to schedule sessions on the go and if we need another person we could always grab some random writer on the server.
...what if we just had a small campaign between us 4? We'd have a GM, 3 players, and everyone would be perfectly capable of `freestyle RP`
1) why is shirabe dead
2) this doesn't answer why you chose Kriisa
and yeah im curious too
go for it
Or is it required by law or something
If it's asking you for a preferred name doesn't that just imply they're gonna respect it?
i think you actually mentioned it
WANNA GEAR? HERE YOU GO
THEY WORK BUT THEY'RE NOT AS GOOD
A BUNCH OF PRICKS MAKING FAKE KNOCK OFF RELICS
THAT'S THE ENEMY IF WE RESTART
KNOCK OFF RELICS
FUCK
HOLY
FUCK
they were just noise
was not neat
The noise on the boat
The boat was neat but
at all
interesting
not
Once we get around to that let's see if we can rally up some people who we can at least expect to be decent RPers. And honestly? Unless we choose a new system I kinda wanna scrap the Symphogear setting. Noise swarms are just kinda
...since I anticipate an early demise to our tabletop group, for better or worse, should we think about getting something new set up either with: less players OR more experienced players?
anything that isnt 20 fucking perception checks while traversing an open plain
that was it
you wanna know what the original combat rules for dnd were? "use this other game's rules"
tbh i just dont like rp combat at all
kriisaki
how many times have you lied about my rolls sakiisa
Fail too many combat rolls, your entire party gets wiped out. Fail a perception check, you can still keep going forward.
tbh combat rolls are my least favorite rolls, but on the fly modifiers make it sound better
n-no dice?
If we continue Saki's setting, I'd wanna pick out a 4th player though. Because if we continue Saki's setting, I either play Lena or we throw out the development we've had between her and Aegis.
but you need to taste one each week until the jar is empty
you can throw it out after tasting it
once you start spiro, buy a jar of pickles. Each week, taste one.
At this speed? No way it can happen any other way.
Kriisa is definitely gonna become a pickle fiend

Ok good.
Am I having too many opinions in fancontent.
Probably not
We'd have to add it to the CSS but yeah
<@!102691114762371072> sent it
I'll throw a mod invite once pitt says his thing
Lets move discussion on this to <#466821423550300180> so we can actually discuss things with pitt
brb
lemme read
lemme just
lemme set up a channel real quick
oh god i gotta read backlog
Alright. Just tell me when and I'll set up a channel for it.
the hormones can travel back in time
You're as accountable to me as I am to you. I'm generally okay with you shit talking valk where I can't see it but not when it has to do with something like a community spotlight.
...that is definitely a thing that needs to happen in a group chat
anyway how were the pickles
<@456226577798135808> the community spotlight stuff should probably be a group DM (or a temporary channel here) rather than just messaging you. Considering everyone here but Latooni is a mod for the sub.
No, not the terms, give me a message to send him.
Also lets hammer out the internal rules before this happens at all.
Ok, R, what do you propose we say?
I want the attention of /r/anime
We go into specifics AFTER he says yes.
Yes that is what "extra moderation attention" is. Replace extra with special if you want.
Okay, how's this. We tell pittman ```We'd love to do this, but there are a few problems concerning the split we could see coming up. Could we ask for some extra moderator attention in the threads or is that too much?```
<@!102691114762371072>
Alright, that makes sense. Kriisa?
So does anyone else here think this is actually worth worrying about? I personally don't. <@&336302034070536192>
For now, I'm nuking things in the spotlight channel that shouldn't have been mentioned at all. Yes I know you will criticize this. It's happening anyway.
Please detail a potential problem situation, why it's enough of a problem to care about, and how we can avoid it
inform him that a why exists, let him ask on his own
so just... say there's a problem user... and then also say we can tell him why they're a problem if he wants to know
but don't start with the why
he can say why, and the conversation continues
"keep tabs on this one particular user" "okay" and the conversation ends
he likely does not care
don't tell him shit he doesn't ask about
If he asks why we'll tell him
I don't think any of it is necessary
```Rakoczi - Today at 12:52 AM
im not going to go into too much detail but essentially the split stems from a fundamental disagreement between how the valkryie server was running things and their consistency to the subreddit rules. they had assumed the name of the subreddit discord without actually intended to represent it as such, and through a lot of hostility and `problems`, the split occurred, which soured a lot of things because people were not happy with losing the title despite avoiding rule association with it. in time, with other things has garnered a lot of ire between the communities thats very hushed. the basis of this is our concern as to why we would go forward with this: we worry that some users, quinn being one of them but many others coming to mind, may take this as an opportunity to perform an attack on the character of the mods and the community itself.
this is what i was going to say
quinn isnt the only threat here. in fact, i feel with the lack of activity theyve had on reddit increasingly, they wont even be a problem
its... everyone else
this is the mainstream anime subreddit
all those shitters that say they hate reddit will still likely browse it anyway
and all those shitters that hate reddit that do not like us will likely see it
Yuri Girl - Today at 12:54 AM
okay, but who's going to show up trying to defame us?
gimme names
Rakoczi - Today at 12:56 AM
quinn is a potential one. xaxas has reddit and does use it. hecate may swear up and down about it but they probs have a reddit too since theyve voted in the anime girl thing in the past. pretty much anyone in valkryie with a reddit account and an axe to grind wrt not liking us(edited)
Yuri Girl - Today at 12:58 AM
1) If Quinn is a problem, we can make sure to keep tabs on what she says
2) Does Xaxas even give a shit?
3) If Hecate is a problem she'll be demodded instantly, so she won't be a problem. Or she will, and we won't care anyway, because then we get her demodded.```
Can we finish talking about one thing before we talk about something else?
I don't see how this is relevant to anything I've said recently. Of course we're gonna tell people to go post in the thread, but that's not something we're asking Pittman to do. He's already doing his side of that.
I'm starting dilation now, responses will be slow
ok
There will be assistance even if I'm the only assistant.
Like I said you don't have to be active in reporting shit, but I'm not going to send a message that says "do all this shit without assistance"
Way more for us than it does for them.
The spotlight is doing something for us.
They're ALREADY doing something for us.
I'll do it myself if you don't agree
helping them do their own job is perfectly fine *when we benefit from helping them*
I uh. Kind of expect us to. Someone needs to report shit, I'm not gonna shove all the responsibility onto them.
Is this what I am sending to pittman, right now, in its current state?
better?
```The reason we're hesitating in immediately participating in this is because we worry that the prior friction from the server split alongside negative opinion from other users outside of the community from the other servers may devolve the thread into less of an appreciation and rejuvenation of the Symphogear Subreddit and more of a warning post of keeping users from coming to this community, advertising the other in its stead. Because of this, we'd really appreciate if you could do the following measures to make sure this doesn't happen:

- Keep an eye out for users who begin to insult the subreddit and its discord for undefined reasons. There are also users in specific we'd like you to keep an eye out for.

I already unpinned everything that shouldn't have been pinned.
And unpin things that aren't relevant anymore, like old prompts.
R, please stop pinning random shit in <#357682999300718592>. I know it's for fun, but there are actual important pins in that channel concerning posting rules.

Same goes for faggot, etc. If they're directing the words, that's point 1, but if they just use the word, we're not getting anywhere with them.
For the third point, just say to watch out for the word tranny. We're not going to successfully get /r/anime to stop saying trap, and trying will only make it worse.
im gonna go get myself laid out to dilate since it's late and i don't wanna wait too much. responses will be slowed.
go for it
once this all is done
We want that a lot.
R, I understand where you're coming from, but you need to understand that they have all of the power and we have none of it. We need to play by their rules as long as they offer something we want, and they do offer something we want: effortless discord advertisement.
fuck the reddit admins
All of it.
The subreddit is our advertisement.
We're following the rules, as we always have, because otherwise we won't HAVE a discord.
If you have no experience, defer to someone who does. I've watched subs get banned for less.
And no.
You're doing that. Right now.
R, remember when you said you were worried about going "my way is the right way" and hiding behind your experience in order to say you're right and we're wrong?
There will be discussion on what I put in the announcements, that much is certain. But I want everything vetted by me at the very least to make sure we don't get some ass from Valkyrie whistleblowing on us.
Any risk is too much risk.
R, the fact that you even suggested vote brigading is why I'm saying that I make the announcements. We're not getting our community banned because of bad decisions. That's going to give valkyrie all the exposure and tear our own platform away from us.
*No breaking Reddit TOS*
vote brigading will get us fucking banned
And what saki said
After I make an announcement go nuts
I said initiated
I'm not shutting you out.
But I am the one who says them
We can discuss things before we say them
I want zero fuckups on this and I'm the one who uses reddit the most.
I'm gonna go and make an executive rule here because this is a rather unique situation. *Any public communication about this event will be initiated by me*

which, let's talk about that! Because we didn't finish talking about it earlier.
By talking about it like pittman has already agreed to everything we ask for.
We need this to happen before we can promote it.
you're jumping the gun by a little bit
Let's discuss "how to promote this" after we're done actually sorting the details out.
Or why it's even being brought up. We're talking about things to tell Pittman.

Okay. Back to the initial thing since we haven't actually had everyone say yes yet.
Ok, so can we make it official here? All public communication about this event will be initiated by me, anything afterwards is up to y'all but don't break site rules.
I was there, and that should be enough if you ask me.
Anyway, the logs are the details of their freakout when I decided to make my own server.
Almost everything about Quinn.
Remove Valkyrie's listing from the subreddit until we have the logs, leave it be and accuse anything they say wrt the split as being fake news, what do we have going here?
What should we do with this? Because I see a few options.
anyway I asked bingo for logs yesterday, and here's how he responded
dicks are big and scary
im afraid of dicks tbh
whatd i miss while i was showering
Yukikaze wears no pants and has her name written on her butt.
At least AL doesn't have KC's Yukikaze
okay im getting you a bit more at this point
I mean. I wouldn't say preferring a default of a loli character is necessarily bad? I had Colt as my adjutant for a while because she wears a cowboy hat.
wait are those all the same boat
with a list of people who submitted, but in no particular order
you should prompt people to guess who's who once everyone has discussed all the fics
Did solo make a guess for mine?
It's not Rukia.
so
this is the first time they've spoken on the server
Carneg is new
he's going off of "rape is bad" which is reasonable, but is also causing him to view opposition to his points as "rape is good" even if some of his points are ass
wfc would benefit from a discussion where he's not emotionally charged over the subject
politely ask them to dont do that
i mean
One more reason for the internal rules
oh god what did dragon do
tempted to just reply with this but I think I'll cut it down to the first sentence
loving the low key transphobia in it too
https://www.reddit.com/r/Symphogear/comments/8vjovb/fanfic_prologue_the_first_entry_in_a_series_about/e2bd3ib/?context=3 i got fanmail
Bitching about valk when relevant is allowed. Just don't pivot entire conversations to bitching about valk unless you really feel the need to vent.
show solidarity
All this means is that when someone comes on our server and starts complaining about valkyrie we can actually like
yeah
btw, that's it for the diplomacy charade. Do try not to piss off louis though, we're still linked there.
pittman mentioned it publicly





because i'm willing to let them stay up if they give me the logs
Should I threaten the removal of the listing at the same time?
Just a title.
Maybe DL sometimes.
But then again... it would basically be JUST Lily posting in the nsfw one
Yeah.
People voted on having just one.
I originally proposed that we would have two fancontent channels, one sfw and one nsfw
So... what are our options? "Things you wouldn't want your boss to see", "Things you wouldn't want to pop up in public", anything else?
We could do that
Like "option 1, option 2, other (please specify)"
We could have it be multichoice with an optional open response at the end.
What if we come up with a few solutions internally and then polling people on which one they like best?
Everyone gets a say here.
You can't be overruled about this. I'm overruling the notion of overruling.
I think this is a thing best handled internally.
A survey might get more accurate responses, but at the same time we'll be going off of the few people who care to fill it out.
I tend to go more along the lines of "would I feel comfortable opening this channel up as my boss passes by"
are we gonna rule this as nsfw? what, specifically, should the criteria for nsfw be?
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
we were never seriously considering him

Okay. So... what's the ruling on the thing that started this discussion?
So push nsfw stuff to nsfw and purify fancontent? For the record, I'm not very concerned with nsfw text. If it's too explicit, it goes in serious-discussion, but otherwise it's a lot easier to hide text than it is to hide pictures.
The embed stripping?
But that seems... not very important if you ask me
Oh yeah, it would disable responses.
Oh.
What would it break about kiri?
Why wouldn't it get seen? People can still click the link.
And slap a warning over the entire channel.
We can actually do that. Just disable embeds.
Can- wait no that's a basic function of discord
That's exactly what I just said.
Then Lily still gets to post.
With adequate warning.
We could say that nsfw content needs to be linked to in fancontent.
I dunno, it might feel discouraging to Lily to just... be the only one posting there.
I refuse to write Symphogear smut of anyone except Tsubasa and Maria. Maybe Kanade in an AU.
WFC has no time to write and no one else here writes smut.
stealing that to post in hieroglyphs
🅱oof
just warn on everything, including ao3
yeah
or just warning on everything
or something along those lines
"smutfics hosted on ao3 are still fine due to warnings. Smutfics hosted elsewhere must be labelled in the channel"
okay how's
ff.net doesn't allow smut to begin with
explicit discussion: nsfw or serious
nsfw images: nsfw
nsfw text: wherever the hell you want it
Also mention that smutfic is still allowed in fancontent.
And since smut comes with a warning on ao3...
Fine in fancontent since you have to click them and then you have to actually stare at the text long enough for someone else to read it too.
Yeah, it does feel a bit out of place to have surprise dikki in fancontent.
Alright, so... do nothing except make fancontent sfw? Or just do nothing?
I don't wanna make a nsfw-symphogear channel either.
Especially during airing seasons.
WE NEVER BEAT PUZZLE PUPPERS
LYSSA
yes
or was that Yuki
isn't his tabletop character like 12 too? <@!102691114762371072>
and then there was his "I follow the rules but I don't agree with them" comment
I'm legit more comfortable with pepe memes than loli shit
it would be a hard thing to moderate without giving him the boot entirely because I don't think he's consciously doing it
yet
I won't complain about it
https://en.gfwiki.com/wiki/Colt_Revolver
in regards to...
```dragon - Today at 2:54 PM
>only cuz she has a cowboy hat
everything about her is adroable```
gaming
...ok dragon might be getting a bit creepy
you mean tenryuu?
oh, tsuyu?
who
Then we'll hide the channel, make a new nsfw, and have Shirabe log as much as she can before deleting it.
"nsfw will be purged in x days/weeks"
We'll give them a warning then.
And we'll say that.
If it's pointed out, we'll delete it.
I don't think it's worth purging nsfw for this.
Anyway, so first step is to say "no more loli/shota stuff, and also sexual discussions should be confined to nsfw"?
He looked like... 5 on my phone but looking at the full art he looks like like 14 or 15
Oh, he looks a bit older without the giant text box in the way
it'd be adorable
i know but

imagine him training to be an emperor and playing with sticks and shit
~~also just gonna take this moment to say that the FGO version of Alexander the Great is hecking cute~~
And when I say questionable I mean questionable. Not outright "this needs to go" material.
There's occasionally questionable dmjii art.
I mean, we don't exactly have a loli epidemic in nsfw at the moment.
And then slowly make the arbitrary line in the sand closer and closer to "not a fucking child"
And also, should we just ban underage content outright, say "discord tos" and then just arbitrarily decide what is and is not underage?
link it, i have no clue what you're talking about
also what exactly in xdu are you talking about?
Loli and shota are both banned by discord's tos. We can hide behind that if we need to.
What gets rid of "damn I really love all these little girls" from sfw channels?
Okay, then what's your solution?
I'm honestly not even looking to push the issue in <#336297808221044736>. There's gonna be porn there. On a server for a show with minors in it. It's something to be expected and if you're uncomfortable with it, don't look. *But keep your boner out of the sfw channels.*
Well, right now I'm a bit uncomfortable with dragon, saki is a bit uncomfortable with dragon, and I'm looking for a solution that is not "ban lolis" but rather "please keep it in your pants"
I'm gonna go out and say *my goal here is not to prevent fetishism from occurring*

I am concerned with people feeling comfortable on the server.
I would honestly say the vast majority of Kirika and Shirabe fanart has both of them looking older than 10, yes. There are a couple of images that make me more than a bit uncomfortable, but we have no policy on it so we've never done anything about them.
Fetishizing the fact that she's a minor - creepy and gross

Picture of Kirika naked - not as creepy and gross, unless she looks younger than normal
Like, GFL jokes about colt going all "haha she's the oldest gun here but she looks like a little girl!" but she still looks like she's 10
There's a wide gap between Kirika and the Colt Revolver girl.
Shirabe is on the edge, but every other Symphogear character at least has breasts, or is voiced by Nana Mizuki.
So, the first point I'd like to make clear is... this isn't about the sexualization of fictional minors. It's about the sexualization of people who **look** like **children**. Nothing to do with their stated age and nothing to do with characters who look young but not overly so. Dragon pushes it by obsession with the loli archetype, which *has nothing to do with minors*.
But anyway, R's turn
And also we know that it'll (probably) never expand to actual humans.
Like he knows it's weird so we can feel assured he'll pull back when someone's uncomfortable.
Plus we just call him a pedophile point blank and the acknowledgment of "yeah this is kind of weird" softens the blow
A con friend I know is a lolicon and like... while I feel comfortable sleeping in the same room as him? I've also never slept in the same room as him without Lyssa also present.
Just say it here, none of us are rushing to start shit
It's likely that no one besides us has even noticed. I didn't notice until Kriisa pointed it out.
yeah lets wait until someone else complains OR he starts doing overtly "are you sure you're not a pedophile?" type stuff
also d'eon if you just mean saber as a class
mordred is cute
i like mordred
play mutiny instead
not even as a dig i just think its funny
latooni do the carrier joke before the discussion  moves too far
fucking hell
you told me jack was a girl
should someone ask him if he has a thing for little girls next time he brings it up
it's the itty bitty titty committee
It can wait a bit
same
bot-testing too, but we're the only ones who'll see it
Yeah
Alright so: music merge once Kriisa is around to facilitate it, voice channels and general-voice moved to a new category at the bottom, subreddit feed hidden, and suggestion box stays.
This does nothing for you but it lets Saki handle her bots more easily
Well I gave you webhooks anyway
Oh you already have that perm
And also there's not a whole lot of reason you don't have channel editing powers.
I should probably give illuminati channel editing powers so it doesn't have to be R or me doing it
It'd be a situational "is there something going on" thing
yeah
Gaming is already mobage wasteland anyway
Yeah. But then again, E3 discussion could go into gaming
1 is the feed
1
or
same for 2 honestly
yeah
I think we could start with axing 1, 2, and 5, merging the music channels, and stuffing voice channels in their own category

theres a few i think could be removed or combined
I kinda wanna crunch down on how many channels we have
To an irritating degree, honestly.
Plus they seemed pretty into the whole cags thing.
I might throw them a DM in a few days. Most people don't accept that they're trans that easily unless they're, you know, trans.
i think i repositioned the tattoo when i put the shirt on as well

https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/705111901548433485/E2B22492713B0EA3261BA9DA18B9F457C01710FD/ seriously everyone else just put on thongs and pasties and called it a day
every time i hear the last argument i think about my APB character and I'm like "okay that makes sense" and then I realize, as the sole woman playing that game with a female avatar, I'm the only person who bothered to dress her up properly
we did

It's the internal rules
```Sakimori (Kriisa) - Today at 8:12 PM
I don't remember that explicitly in the Terms and Conditions, is it codified as such?```I think I'm remembering something else that was supposedly going to be codified last weekend too...
shall I make an announcement?
is that it?
<@!102691114762371072> did you ever fix up the music command stuff?
my prompt wasn't suffering though
```(⚧♀) ibu2009 <— Ping for Pics - Today at 5:59 PM
so you know how i told you about my friend who was joining who has a bit of a very toxic mentallity about themselves and stuff?
thats Vali, they rejoined
Yuri Girl - Today at 6:11 PM
Have they done something bad?
(⚧♀) ibu2009 <— Ping for Pics - Today at 6:11 PM
Not really
They have a very negative mentality
I mean the best example i can point at is them posting those articles in serious discussion
The way i see it is that is him bringing himself down
I just wanted the mod team to know, mainly because its my job to be concerned about him and im not active all the time```
I actually archived it already. Just point kiri at <#447132690349555712> and make the pin whenever you want.
<@!102691114762371072> tell me when music commands is merged so I can archive the old channel
yeah i cant
subreddit feed should be hidden now but i have no way to check
I'll let you handle that Kriisa
Anything special we have to do to get them properly merged?
if you only need the loan once I can definitely just throw all of the money in my paypal at you
heiki, hecchara
is that slang for tiddy
Spiro is basically the standard so if you're ever not on spiro there's usually a good reason.
Alright, so assuming you have a competent doctor, you probably are on a medication that will help. Or at least one that won't hurt.
Did you already have bloodwork done before today?
Also in the end, it's the estrogens that do the work. Anti-androgens help but some people aren't on AAs at all.
And also same.
You should still ask questions so you can go into next month properly informed.
I subsisted primarily on coconut water when I started spiro.
It's hell.
Or coconuts.
Yeah, you're not allowed to eat bananas on spiro.
I probably should have mentioned this earlier.
Not a waste! But make sure you ask as many questions as possible next time.
You might not be a bad patient, but especially when trans, you should strive to be the best patient you can possibly be since there's a good chance that you might have to start teaching one of your doctors about shit yourself.
Because you should 100% be asking that question. Like literally every step of the way, if you can't explain why you're on the shit you're on then you're not being the best patient you can be.
Did you ask your doctor WHY they were concerned about the side effects?
<@102691114762371072> did you get into the beta too
Symphogear fits as a guild name perfectly
Maple mod party!
while we're fresh on the topic of internal rules and users who are negative but not breaking rules I'd like to point out ```Nagatocchi改二 - Yesterday at 11:51 PM
Oh it's airshit```in <#336297387863703552> 

Normally I'd ignore that entirely, but naga is a 4chan user so it might be a good idea to keep tabs on that. I don't think he's aggressive though, just carrying the culture.

I sense that someone would like to vent. Or might want to in the future.
but not when the stream keeps fucking up
i was using crunchy because crunchy is convenient

`it means it's time to get high`
(it means you need to get high instead of drunk like a responsible trans girl)
you know what that means, right?
<@456226577798135808> Like I said, nothing useful would come of decrying them. I'll just bury them in an ocean of better content when they show up.
Waves around a "degreee in human sexuality" in order to erase lesbians' identities, unapologetic pedophile, and I'm pretty sure there was an instance of defending an abuser at least once
Just gonna. Drown out that name every time it pops up anywhere. Nothing useful would come from confronting the issue with how many people she has blindly defending her.
Oh boy, yurifucker is into Symphogear now

did it involve PLAYING MAPLESTORY
THIRTY MINUTES
they didn't understand the concept of playing ~together~
they couldn't understand "if we're playing together, we don't touch the server unless both of us are there"
i tried playing minecraft with them once and i went to bed and woke up with a fully automated and very ugly base
it's always a race
i know someone who literally cannot sit down and enjoy a game
i figured you did some engineering thing or something since you've only ever mentioned math
you've never told us this
no
are you a tutor
i cant take over right now
<@!99695384296701952> if you make a channel, archive it once it's done
i can just say "energy" instead of memories
autoscorers transferring memories by kissing isn't a spoiler, is it?
what do you call a tank bullet
before the session on thursday or after mafia on friday both work
whenever we're all free and can do it
should we do that instead of the RP session? Or maybe before it?
We should probably all work on an introduction for the spotlight at some point soon
raid bosses are just giant dps checks
there isn't anything complicated like buff or debuff stacking

god damn that was horrible
i think i have enough akira to write the fic
i think
they have no problem searching your meds, probably won't have a problem digging around your room
you can do both just leave the crayon taped to your door and then when they finally go into your room after not hearing from you for like a day have the scathing note on your bed
I vote for scathing note. The reality won't hit them as hard with the crayon.
Phara "fuck swords" Suyuf
i just have to change the bits where hibiki says "yeah okay i can accept you i guess"
the show basically writes the entire fic for me
god this show sucks i love it
I hate GX
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
YOUVE BEEN WITH IT
ITS THERE
THERE
FUCKING
IT'S BEEN
"no it was my fault too" NO IT WASNT AND YOU'VE HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO FIGURE THAT OUT

NOT ONLY is Akira's arc shit
i dont actually care about the bits that Akira doesn't show up in so I have it on fastforward and uh

squeaky
FUCK AKIRA
GOD DAMN
FUCK
DO THEY WRITE A "EVERYTHINGS HEIKI HECCHARA" AT THE END
HOW THE FUCK
FUCKING FUCK AKIRA
help
im being forced to watch symphogear
something about finding a job i dunno
the petty side of me says to think of a really good farewell note to leave them before you start your road trip
it's a solo piece tho
I can make copies but it costs 125k to make a 10 use scroll and 250k for a 20 use scroll
<@&336302034070536192> IT LIVES
i just finished eating and right now im trying to make music. I can't play anyway, I'll just watch
Global pings are fine, just stop firing them off like a machine gun
We set up the opt in roles *specifically for this purpose*
Seriously
If you do it again I'm removing your global ping permissions
that's going to ping literally everyone who is online
that's a global ping
*please*
R, global pings
control
control your impulses
abuse of power leads to loss of power
<@456226577798135808> cool it with the global pings, that's twice in an hour
<@!99695384296701952> I see you said something in game but im dilating so i cant read it
by right clicking
illuminati will always be able to see the mafia role
in the end, i just removed the tempo change, so it sounds wonky for half a note
took me all day because there was a tempo change in the middle of a beat and i kept trying to figure out how to insert the tempo change while preserving the song
anyway im gonna go watch y'all play mafia now that im done composing this
i mean i have the mesos
if you split tracks, chords should sound fine
what are you trying to edit?
and at that point I'd have to put it on two separate 10k sheets and do a piano duet
I have a copy of won\*3*chu kiss me that if I were to split the tracks, it'd be well over 20k notes
Compression. It'll make the track smaller.
https://musicalnexus.net/3mle-download/
specifically maplebeats
3mle, yes
So that video I linked earlier was the result of me just knowing what I was doing and being familiar enough with the song to only listen to half of it at a time and be like "yes, this part needs this instrument"
And I couldn't listen to the mml because for ensemble pieces you just need to hope you did it right
I was not capable of listening to the midi before making it.
For Bloody Stream, I had it open in 2 editors at once, with the main melody ripped from an entirely different midi and chopped in half because I had the TV version and the main melody was on a full version.
It's one of those things where it's incredibly overwhelming if you don't know what you're doing, but once you understand how to do it it's pretty easy. Just time consuming for larger pieces.
I made this in like 15 minutes, but 10 of those minutes were listening to the midi, the original, and the mml
So a piano piece with two parts (very common) still needs about 5~15 minutes of work put into it
But I still need to split the tracks
If I'm making a solo piece, it takes like 5 minutes to do
Then I have to match which parts go to which instruments
So I have to take each track individually and split them to get the full range present in the actual midi
But the editor compresses things by default
I open the midi in an editor
No.
hell maybe 8
clash will probably be 5 or 6 people. Maybe 7.
this is gonna be bloody stream all over again
im splitting 14 tracks
14 tracks
I'm probably gonna start dilation soon and then work on splitting the...
Particularly since we'll need a bass player AND an electric guitar player
https://musescore.com/user/54591/scores/167357 <@99695384296701952> I sure hope you're ready for when I finish this one
<@456226577798135808> did you ever do anything for the introduction?
which is going to be a pain in the ass
My next project will be Battle on the Big Bridge
why does america have to be so big
```I will also need an intro for you spotlight, and this can be collabritive between all of you. All it needs is a basic introduction to what Symphogear is, maybe history of the franchise, accolades, clips, MAL/Anilist, etc., and a small intro to your actual community. I think Yuru Camp's intro is really well done if you want inspiration on what I'm ideally looking for. https://redd.it/8yx15c```<@&336302034070536192> can we, like, do something here?
because its an editor for mabi
also too big, this has to be a duet
whats the mml export look like?
unless its a midbeat tempo change
syrup will produce a worse sounding mml but it'll fix any tempo issues magically
I haven't really touched syrup since I learned how to properly split tracks
maplebeats is generally the way to go though
maplesyrup rejects your split midi on the last track
hahahahahahahaha
that would almost definitely produce a functional piece
open it up in mabibeats and run it through maplesyrup instead
you could cheese this though
still would not advise making this your first piece
a lot of the tempo changes seem pointless
getting this functional in maplestory would be literal hell
not happening
yeah give up on this
oh god mid beat tempo changes
oh wow this is not a good beginner's song
?
so i dont have to split it again
export the split midi as its own midi
oh, better
Can you link the midi you're working off of?
So if there's a tempo change 2 beats into a measure, you have to match where the tempo change is. You can't stick it anywhere in the measure, it'll sound wrong if you do.
if you see a tempo change anywhere, you must copy that tempo change to every single track in the same measure *at the same beat*
just... scroll down the left pane for each track
They'll be noted in yellow along the left pane
Oh, you'll also wanna look for tempo changes in a song that big.
It's written in tiny font along the top of the pane.
The top pane with the graphic depiction of the notes should tell you what measure you're at
Maybe preserve the coda
Look at what measure you're on at 1:30 and cut out everything after it.
If you want 1:30 of it, just hit play and pause it at the 1:30 mark
What song is this?
Oh. Oh that's big.
F7 brings it up
Yes.
can you show me a screenshot of what it looks like when you try to export the mml?
I could literally get a midi of a full 100 member orchestra and turn that into a 10 person piece
Most of my stuff isn't that long but all of it is also really really tiny. I'm handing people 3k sheets for multi-part stuff.
If you delete things, always delete a full measure. That being said, you can easily fit 4 minutes into a ms2mml piece.
that indicates which measure you're looking at
ok so most midis should open up and in the portion where the code is displayed, you'll notice there's a commented out 'M01' or something like that next to each line
the editor will automatically compress rests for you
why do you need to truncate it
gonna get start with dilation right now so brb a bit
ctrl+a, ctrl+c in the splitting instance, ctrl+t, ctrl+v in the editing instance
I'll split track 1 in the editing instance, and then split every other track in the splitting instance, pasting them back into the editing instance to form the complete song
one instance is the editing instance while the other instance is the splitting instance
is I have 2 instances of 3mle running
so what I do when splitting tracks
in the bottom pane?
just highlight measure 56 and pull down
anyway, im slep, please be around for clash on the big bridge tomorrow
they dont, the party leader hits play manually
same
im actually using the ocarina in this piece
I'll save this one for you since you have mondays off
it is 3 am
<@99695384296701952> i've finished arranging clash on the big bridge
if you don't use v15 it'll always be really quiet
also the preview will deceive you on volume
before
stress testing
i love the mark of beta
yeah
im gonna get one
for merets?
when composing there's a list of all the instruments
violin and cello
there is
id play it with you
you dont use up the scroll in auto performance
no
take a random song, use an auto performance voucher, and leave the game for an hour
you need to have max performance mastery to buy 10ks
5k
just to see whats playing where
reading is all you need
that's how i ripped the main melody for bloody stream
if you can read sheet it might be helpful to play the midi on musescore
ive got tons of mml saved on my desktop waiting for launch
then compose
then you save it before composing because then you can send it to people or use it in launch
where XXX is the piece's tempo which you'll find in the first track
then once everything is copied in, stick v15tXXX at the front of every track
each track gets its own section
but for this, you wanna copy tracks one at a time and paste them into maple
mabi only does 3 tracks at a time
maplebeats is just a hack
its in spotlight
```Forgot deadline. Again, this will be posted the 28th, so I'd like everything by the 26th to edit.```
last week
Pittman gave a deadline
Look, I'm just asking you to do it when you say you'll do it. You volunteered for it, and I don't wanna end up running up against a deadline when it has to be handed off to another human.
you just said you procrastinate. do i have the right to tell you to stop procrastinating?
may i reserve the right to tell you to get off maplestory if i see you playing at 2?
can you have the first draft ready by 4 pm?
pittman  needs it on the 26th, it's the 24th, and we need to discuss it as a team as well
because you were gonna do it "tomorrow" 3 days ago
<@456226577798135808> do you promise to do it tomorrow?
well, 26th
it's due the 28th
can you start now
boop*
<@456226577798135808> BOOP
<@456226577798135808> beep
that you should post here before sending it to pittman
the introduction that you volunteered to write
<@456226577798135808> did you ever do anything for the introduction
how close is the tabletop session to being over? <@99695384296701952> <@!102691114762371072>
<@99695384296701952> latooniiiiiiiiiiiii
this is where the left pane is useful
wont work right. you have to match both tempos to both tracks
need some musical knowledge
if you have two tracks setting different tempos at the same place you uhhhh
. means it's a dotted note
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 all correspond to note length (bigger number shorter note)
+ means sharp
abcdefg and r all correspond to notes or rests
t169d+4 means it sets tempo to 169 then plays a d sharp quarter note
also uhhhhhhhhhhhhhg
correct, all tempo changes should be in all tracks
we'll have more people from here playing on full release anyway and I did Clash specifically by request from tippy
like i can always just make a new score and hand it to you and we can play some other time
I can try and wait for you to play the song but I don't wanna wait until like 9PM to do things. I'd like to get started on the next track after I've confirmed this one works.
you make 3, we need 7
right now imutone and I are around
as soon as we have enough people, usually a bit later in the day

We gotta be presenting the best damn thing on this Earth for this
But which is better
What works? My edits?
I like the repetition, I just wanted to make it `extra spicy`
If that makes sense.
The original is "It's about girls. It's about girls. It's about girls." and then "It's about. It's about. It's about." so I kinda wanted to merge up the latter two in each case so it had a rhythm of 1 2 1 2 instead of 1 1 1 1 1 1.
Should we go with the original for the second edit there too?
Or should we just go with the original there
How's ```It’s about girls who look for friendship and manage to find it in the most unlikely of ways, girls trying to befriend their enemies as much as possible and then kicking them in their teeth anyway when that fails.```
Yeah I was trying to maintain the "kick them in their teeth" part but I guess it doesn't work too well in the end.
how do those changes seem?
```I’ll provide two answers.```should be```We'll provide two answers.```Since we're presenting this as a group. Otherwise that's spot on.

Everything's great in the first explanation.

just woke up from a bad dream, give me a moment to unscramble my brain and read this
no one asked me to be around for mafia. that was your event and I can't participate anyway.
if there's something I'm supposed to be present for I'll be there
I'd appreciate it if you didn't point fingers at me when you volunteered to do this. After I had suggested times to do it as a group.

<@99695384296701952>
any ideas on where to mention XV coming up? I can put it in the last paragraph.
I already sent the intro but I can send a new one
```R - Today at 3:16 AM
are you honestly telling me with a straight face that you, the person who founded this place, felt that the event i was running to celebrate the server you created was something no one asked you to participate in, given that i asked repeatedly if people here wanted to play and even pitched that yall could use throwaway discords to get in on the action? or that you couldnt even just, yknow. talk? to your users? your community? during the celebration of what you created?```

I'm not going to say that I didn't create this server. I set it up, created the framework for the community, and have had a hand in moderating it for a little over a year. That being said? This isn't my community. I don't own it. I don't own it, you don't own it, Saki doesn't own it and Latooni doesn't own it. We each play our own part in maintaining the community and we're "the ones in charge" whenever someone is looking to do a collab like Pittman, but at the end of the day? The community owns itself, and that's a pretty core factor in your views as well - that a properly maintained community will moderate itself most of the time.

I planted the seeds, you poured on fertilizer, and we're all just a group of people cultivating a community and shaping it in the ways we see fit. No one moderator holds ultimate power over all others and no one community member is more important than any other. Everyone is equal here.
anyway, dilator in, <@456226577798135808> can I address something you said last night? Not looking to start an argument or admonish you, I just want to clear something up.
remember that maple instruments aren't perfect analogues to the real world
trumpet, tomtams, piano/guitar, maybe sax
tomtams will suffice for that
can you throw me a midi?
dont think we need high hats for that song
i uh
or did you mean the actual song?
i dont think we need drums for the fanfare
ira is building a stage btw
we can test it at three
multi-part?
this is why i've shifted from writing literature to writing songs (I'm gonna start back up with writing once the beta is over I promise)
`less fancy non-fancy commas`
fancy commas replaced by less fancy and more reddit friendly non-fancy commas
<@456226577798135808> you have fancy commas
OH NO
oh no
i'll just copy paste it into reddit anyway
oh i cant edit the doc
like i said, i'd promote you at request
Also <@456226577798135808> thank you for getting this done on time
lemme get my dilation stuff set up and then I'll get everything together and send it to pittman
edits it is then
I'm in favor of the edits
In that case, I say we hold a vote. <@&336302034070536192> who's in favor of the original introduction and who's in favor of my edits?
1 pm
we'll need 8 people total around 1-2 hours before beta ends
10 AM on august 1st is when it shuts down for you
Also <@456226577798135808> <@99695384296701952> who's gonna be part of our beta send off concert
*it's synths all the way down*
Also I'm trying to explain to my mom why a piano and a vibraphone are in the same category in maple. She's having a hard time wrapping her head around "everything is just a subcategory of electrophone"
<@99695384296701952> wait shit where did you play that you got a 75k tip at
in this moment of need......
<@456226577798135808> you logged off
<@456226577798135808> <@99695384296701952> can either of you help me test out a score?
unfortunately i had to remove all the other volume settings, because they sounded terrible ingame
playing with volumes can do lots of neat things! I have a Serendipity score that fades in like the actual song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYhVtMSQ-Nw
what matters is that *the defaults are different*
or whatever values the defaults are
but if you don't set anything, the preview outputs v15 while the actual score outputs v5
the preview will properly output v2
like, if you set v2 in the editor
but i dunno
I think it's linear
and the scale is 0-15
the default is 15 in preview mode
BUT NOT DURING PREVIEW MODE
ms2mml makes you set the volume manually because the default is like. 5.
Or bully a girlfriend into trying it in her downtime...
I might make it myself if I'm able to
Welcome to Youkoso Japari Park sounds good but I need to lower the volume and I really really want a live preview to know how much I should go for.
also god i need a tool that lets me preview maple ensembles
the one with the dude hosting both sides of increasingly ridiculous topics
i need that satire video

Fair point. I wouldn't warn for it though, since I doubt kerrik actually read it. Just delete.
It indirectly mocks it, but it's definitely not endorsing it
The punched hibiki image is fine because as part of the original meme it mocks the usage of the slur.

```Hello @everyone! /r/anime has decided to shine their community spotlight on us this week! Go check out the reddit thread at [link] and tell people what's awesome about both Symphogear and this community! Additionally, keep an eye out for /r/anime's weekly discussion thread on Wednesday for additional Symphogear talk!```
I mostly wanna just encourage people to look at and participate in the thread
We *could* do that but I feel like that would clutter the thread up with Things That Aren't Discussion
Ok, so tomorrow is spotlight day. I wanna do something to drum up hype *other than manipulating votes* so what should we do/say once the thread is posted?
server icons must be square
square, not circle
(and my response)

I GAVE R EDITING RIGHTS
I DID IT
You know how wolf left because the environment in valkyrie *slowly* grated on him until he couldn't take it anymore?
You don't even need a ping to see the icon has changed.
*There's no event. We changed our icon. That's it.*
R, that message is a really strong point for me to remove your ability to use global pings.
If people aren't interested after one global ping, they won't be interested after 4. And since *we aren't actually doing anything for Kanade's birthday* the global ping isn't warranted.
Yeah, see? Latooni doesn't like it either.
It gets the same work done without prompting everyone to disable it entirely, which does *the opposite* of what you want
I just gave you the alternative. A single @everyone
Using an @everyone to remind people things were happening on that day: cool
Using 4 @everyones each time you had an update: not cool
If someone is active in the community, they will see it if it's in announcements. The global ping is reserved for things that are legitimately important.
Bringing peoples attention to other channels is fine. Announcements is its own channel for a reason.
A single @everyone for our anniversary would have been fine. You dropped 4.
A lot of people, myself included, get pretty annoyed to see the ping and then look over and it's just an @everyone for something that's ultimately of low consequence.
The lurkers lurk for a reason.
A fictional character's birthday is hardly a huge event. Maybe if we were all getting together and buying a cake, but we aint doing that.
Okay, but the whole community is not *all 400 users on this discord server*
R, can we talk about your inclination to drop a global ping at the drop of a hat?
no. announce it without a global ping
?
last one went up at 6:30
~~and Lyssa~~
the only thing i will fuck with is your perception of gender
yes
i mean I won't fuck with anything
it is proooobably a good idea to let us access logs
I think it's worth logging
Although they might not speak at the same time
Well if someone changes their color, then they're doing something on the server
all of it?
uh
do not kick ryouko
implement log storage once she isn't crashing every other day
You've done a lot. I love the work you do. But there are times when different approaches are needed.
We need to go back to step 1, avoid any ad hominem shit, and talk like adults. This may take a few days, but we need to talk.
You'll have everything back once we've figured out what we're actually doing.
We need to sort shit out.
You're not demoted.
I am temporarily neutering the Custodian role until this situation becomes less hostile.
Why does it have to be an activity? I've cultivated a community. I moderate and I make decisions as I see fit for the betterment of the community.
R, remember when you told me you didn't want to vote for either you or Saki as Custodian, because you were afraid you'd get up on a high horse and dismiss everyone else?
I was on board day 1.
Uh, Saki is here because of me *talking with Lyssa* over the course of several months.
If we make rules, I want explanations for rules. The explanations should be sufficient to tell why free pings are bad.
Yes.
We can all brainstorm alternative attention getting methods, but global pings are not that method.
So, first point: out of 4 mods here, 3 are against global pings *except in valid situations* and 1 wants to pingus wingus all he wants.

Second point: Since 3/4 of the mods here want pings to be restricted to certain things, I am volunteering to write up rules on when to ping and when to pong. Either of the other two mods with me can also help.

Third point: If someone does not engage entirely *we need to find ways to make them want to engage* rather than just shoving content in front of their face, especially when that content amounts to not a whole lot ultimately.
Okay, hang on, gimme just a second to have the floor. If everyone could let me speak freely that'd be grand.
We added those specifically to avoid global pings.
The other alternatives are opt-in roles.
We're gonna write up rules on when we can ping.
That's what we're doing.
<@456226577798135808> I join streaming communities for streamers. I talked in the MS2, General, Off-topic, and Subscriber chats. The constant pings were annoying *when I already got notifications by subbing*.
That sound good?
Okay, know what? R wants to ping freely. The rest of us think that's annoying. Since we have the numbers here, we'll do exactly what we did for the internal rules. Those of us who care will write up what is, and what isn't, an acceptable situation for a ping.
I don't look at it anymore because there were too many pings.
I used to talk in more
It has pushed me away
I only talk in one channel on tate's discord as a result
I have it muted in tate's discord because there's a ping EVERY SINGLE DAY
All 3 of us hate it. If I weren't a mod and I saw constant ping spam, regardless of how active I am in the server, I'd just fucking leave.
It'll be more than just the people who aren't around to begin with leaving because of ping spam.
Same shit. Sure, you're getting instant feedback, but for the other 400 people who don't respond, you're pushing them away.
I'd rather leave it up for now
Same button that makes an announcement also removes an announcement
<@456226577798135808> since the spotlight is currently the bottom announcement, you'll have to manually remove the current writing prompt before you post the next one on Monday
right lemme get on that
well that's a new feature
i have it primed in announcements
It's alright.
Anyway, situation is a bit calmer now, so I'm restoring custodian capabilities.
If they don't care enough for the icon change alone, they probably won't care enough for a ping with no attached event. That being said, if we wanted to host themed mafia games on birthdays with you playing the part of the birthday girl, that's totally ping worthy, and I think it sounds like a good idea.
R? The icon change *is* the alternative you wanted.
```
Amity - Today at 5:40 PM
Damn, Tsubasa, Maria, Kanade and Serena :heart:```
A user who has previously said they don't want to participate on this server.
We have more more than a lurker. We've got amity speaking.
14 total
Yes, you should be able to see it in the member management area of server settings.
Wait, no, Shirabe is dead
Saki, can you run the command?
We have around 70 active members. And that's over a three day period.
The first week turnout for the writing prompts was honestly amazing.
We are, ultimately, a small community still. Like in the grand scheme of things? We're a speck.
Limiting the role is not a thing I wanted to do, and I'll probably restore it later today or early tomorrow, but I didn't want to risk anything when it came to the spotlight happening today.
I'd like to point out, while I've neutered the role mechanically, you are still a custodian at the moment. You still have power in discussions concerning other mods, and you still moderate this community.

we need a transformation sequence to turn <#466821423550300180> into #rewatch
R we need you

<@456226577798135808>

Let people know it's a thing
i love manually editing mml
not like the space is taken up by anything else
it's animated so once permission is granted sure
I'd like to take a moment to say that seeing wolfsbane active in this server where they never were in Valkyrie is just so affirming

gimme a bit, dilating

i dont know the command though
lets delete that quote just in case. waifu wars and all.
I'm planning on bed soon so I'll do it now
Or who kicks/bans
Is there any way to see *who* deletes a message?
How do you propose this is done
Why?
I don't, but I can very easily throw out bait for them
Just because eggs keep flocking to me doesn't mean I do it on purpose!
And we have no way of knowing what those Complicated Gender Feelings amount to.
Jacq pretty clearly has Complicated Gender Feelings but there's too much other shit in the way for them to think about it clearly.
I feel like consent can still be given for that. But more to the point, it's probably more important to strip the layers of kink and repression off of that and let things happen naturally.
From what I can read though... Jacq might *kinda* want someone to just tell them that they're a girl now and they have to follow orders. But that's not the kind of emotional investment I'm capable of expending.
I can pretty easily spot overly literal answers because I've had to train myself to rephrase my therapist's questions for her.
And at the very least I have a lot of experience with autistic people.
I'm like... maybe autistic.
Oh. That's why I asked my last question.
How's that make it awkward to read into?
While I may not be hunting for eggs Jacq does certainly strike me as nonbinary of some sort. Even the fact that they use a rather gender neutral Jacq instead of Jack/Jacque or Jackie
we have 49 open slots
just send me full res pictures of animated emojis and i'll add them
<@!102691114762371072> does kirika auto-delete her bye messages?
Like what if we gave someone 500 kiricoins for submitting an entry for the writing prompt, and 100 kiricoins for taking part in discussion on a prompt
We'd have to figure out prices and stuff but I really like that idea because *it can also tie in with any other event we host on the server*
Using it as a means to generate and place bets with currency would actually be super interesting.
But everything is leased so you have to keep buying the blue name <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Yes.
Only one person can buy the emoji slot at a time, and the slot is reserved for a month at a time.
What if... people place bets on their character each round, and the winners all get their kirichan currency. Currency may be spent on a number of things, such as vanity roles, the emoji slot, or anything else we think of.
<@!102691114762371072> hey so we're enabling Kiri-chan's currency feature
half of my avatars are just cropped porn from taosym

~~my steam is linked through my discord~~
Indies only want their game on steam at this point for the sake of having it on steam. They also put their games everywhere else because steam is shit.
A gaming platform that people are moving away from, mind you.
Steam is just a gaming platform now, Valve fucking dropped the ball on its social capabilities a decade ago.
Everyone's on discord and everyone has their steam account linked on discord if they want it to be.
Everything's on discord.
No one uses Steam groups anymore.
Why do we need a steam group? It's a dying platform.
bam, baited
Are you trying to lure Saki to Boston Lyssa
and for stuff where we'd need to manually distribute kiricoins, should we have an echo function so that people can submit bets or whatever and then we can easily sort through each bet in a separate hidden channel?
what should the allowance be and how much should we charge for each shop item we've got so far?
Kiri Shop
dess_purchase
Can we give that capability to everyone on staff?
People with the admin permission or people designated as admins?
we'd have to maually distribute currency
But for stuff like the big brother events
allowance aside of course
I'd wanna handle it all manually tbh
3) a way for users to spend their currency
2) a way for users to bet their currency
we need 1) a way for users to generate currency
Anyway, point is
why are you asking saki for the medres kiris when i have fullres

users ask me questions and i try to answer them
stump the chump is reverse trivia
I'm willing to host stump the chump for this
Unless we expand it to more than just symphogear
I personally don't like trivia. Geno tried it on Valkyrie and it didn't take long before there were no more questions to ask.
Mafia could tie in with the currency. The winning team could all receive kiricoins.
Any event host is automatically disqualified from gaining currency from the event they're hosting, obviously
At a certain point we run out of trivia though
What are other ways we can generate currency? Becuase this idea would be most suitable to *betting* currency
alright
okay, what about just the discussion part
it's still the homucoin

oh you uploaded the cape directly to the spritesheet
https://www.reddit.com/r/Symphogear/about/stylesheet/ upload it here and then do... whatever R and Lyssa did
did you ever add it?
other than the default flairs
same rule as the emoji, give us a picture and as long as it follows the rules, it becomes your subreddit flair. That one's permanent, but each time you change flair you have to buy a new one
ooh, subreddit flairs
Which I don't think we can add to the shop directly
And temporary
I'd want the roles to be custom
Right now we've got:
emoji slot
vanity roles
But, that aside, what should you prizes even *be*? And for how many coins?
because that just takes up space any time its run
We don't wanna publicly run things like jii_userCheck
We need bot-testing so we don't clutter up the sub
We'd shove it in a bot spam channel like every other server
plus letting people build up with the allowance command
yeah
we do not need to release the kiricoins tonight
it is okay
kiri does not give coins in this channel

MARIA IS XDU
OH MHY GOD
MARIA IS
also, gimme a way of uploading stuff to kirichan's db and i'll personally get a good chunk of cards in there
any more commands?
Also adding the thumbnails for gallery purposes wouldn't be too much extra
I mean, we'd be adding all the cards to her database for the gacha command anyway
its your choice if the ideas become work
im giving you ideas
fuck *we could even phase events in and out*
Once you roll a card, you get that card in your gallery
I think we'd be better off implementing a personal gallery for each user
but thats work
if we wanted to be extra, we could even add the actual "game" in
we can't pass it up
it's too good
we gotta get it done though
it's allllll on gamewith
okay i think everything is on gamewith
hang on i know who might help wth this

is that not a single thing?
dess_shopadd list 1 test
wut
dess_shopadd list 1
What's your proposed method of handling it?
dess_flip
does dess_flip need owner perms?
lets try it
`user types in xdu_roll 10`
Maria runs dess_take 2000 %user%
Maria generates 10 cards and shows them to the user in an embed
at which point things could just go
We could always give Maria owner perms
just to tie the removal of coins and the spinning of the gacha to one command?
why would gacha tickets make it easier?
*that means we get active members from the xdu bot. not just lurkers*
and you use kiricoins to roll the gacha
since the primary way of getting kiricoins is by participating in the community
there's more
AND
ad
this is so totally gonna happen
and we pull out a fucking xdu bot
"yeah we have a steam group what do you guys have? a reddit?"
says
valk comes up to us
look me in the eyes
do we give the user the dupe or give them some of their kiricoins back?
what do we do about card dupes?
*we're gonna have an xdu bot and it's gonna be the coolest thing ever*
thats marias oicture

where is it
fucking
we need
of which there is only 1
so you could go "give me all matching primary keys for x userid" and then "run y command for all of those primary keys"
userid isn't necessarily unique in the context of sql but functionally, they're unique
127644949884698624 is me
165628997957320704 would give you R
yeah userids are like
wouldn't you be able to find all matching primary keys for a given userid?
Kriisa is poking around inside Kirichan <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
or am i done
can i finish setting kiri up?
anyway how do we handle kiricoins being used for maria rolls
MARIA, THE ULTIMATE XDU BOT
TO COMBINE
R AND SAKI TEAM UP
i'd allow that command only  if i'm the only one who gets to use it and can claim lyssa as my waifu
yeah lets not
dess_sc dess_gift disable
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Like, literally make a gacha. Rotate units in and out of availability.
Stagger them to keep people interested
I'd say not to release all the units at once
stripping the game part from xdu actually makes it better
like
"log on during events for an extra 5 gems per day"
if the entire thing was "log on each day for 3 gems, log on seven days in a row for an extra 15" you'd actually have something better
xdu is ACTUALLY the worst part of xdu
if we're making a game, we have to go further than xdu does. It won't take much effort to make something better.
dont need to, this is literally rolling for art
people like memoria art too
and why no memoria?
To their faces.
we don't need JUST resizing. We also need cropping.
memorias would also be a problem for that
and gamewith only gives us aw03 thumbs
because each art has its own thumbnail
do we wanna use gamewith thumbs or do we wanna crop thumbs ourselves so that we have a thumb for each individual art?
that's just a dump of *everything*
yeah
we'll need thumbnails too but i think gamewith should be fine for that?
trying my hardest not to arouse questions from valkyrie while also not being a dick to louis
Momria
bam, got you the cards kriisa


<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
gamewith only has the max awakened
Getting all the card arts will be hard
and then figure out when we're releasing things
figure out what we're doing
Lets get an ordered todo list set up
right now, the gacha is kriisa's job. between the rest of us we can figure out the other parts.
yeah
we'll have the placeholders of the emoji and role stuff but...
if we release kiricoins too long before the kiricoins have a use, people will stop caring
there's an issue
but
but would it be that overwhelming to suddenly have th- well, they'd have to become accustomed to GETTING the coins
I suppose
and we can plan out any other kiricoin events while this is being worked on
well, without the gacha, we lack a whole lot of incentive to actually obtain kiricoins. I say we get the gacha done, and then we release it alongside kiricoins.
and thank latooni for calling us goddesses
and thank saki for being able to do this you're the best
and thank me for entertaining that idea for more than like 12 seconds
R, thank you for making that one offhand comment about gachas
this is gonna be The Thing
alright. and if someone has a rateup we just multiply the weight for each applicable card
are we gonna maintain stars? or does the weight replace stars entirely?
Like, in a gacha with 10 cards, 7 cores and 3 specials
they're just available more often
not all core cards will be available all the time
The special pool has rarer units like swimphogears, maids, etc
You have a higher chance of pulling something from the core pool, since there'll always be more of them available.
The core pool and the special pool.
I'd say we designate two pools of cards
but also we can just make our own gachas
uhhhh i can try but no promises
you will reign supreme
so that we don't end up giving one character too much love
also - we'll need to keep track of which cards have been available in how many gachas.
make sure to only deduct from those pulls if the character is actually available in the gacha
ooh, that works
So that it's not limited to people with names
I think people should be able to choose one character and get a rateup for their selected character
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I'll see if I can get an alt on my phone or desktop and play a few games to see what it's like as a player
that sounds good
I am up for learning but I don't wanna screw it up especially with kiricoins at stake
same for mafia
big ~~brother~~ sister would definitely work, but that would require you as a host
and they don't bar the host from participating
and they're easy to set up and host
Both of those we could award the winners with kiricoins
Quiplash and CAH
Oh! oh oh oh
We could host our own variant on AMQ but my experience with AMQ is that most people usually have no clue
<@456226577798135808> do you think stump the chump will work here, or would there be too many people submitting questions?

lets fit as much of this onto discord as possible, but lets not hamstring our selves with that
3-5 seconds
yeah a cd of like
and the ensuing disaster
to prevent xdu_multipull 100
need a limit on multipull
which is why i wanted thumbs
i was thinking of the gallery being an embed in discord
pretty sure only the geahs have birthdays
he has no stated birthday
...but why
fuck 24 hour timers
but not 24
anyway, 22 hour timer also works
xdu_
ill explain once my dilator is in
make it 23 hours
oh, <@!102691114762371072> can dess_daily have the time period changed?
I could handle doing something like that
Some sort of regular hosted event
We'll need to release kiricoins alongside something more compelling than dess_allowance
It gets people in the mindset that kiricoins are a prize and that there are things they can use the coins for.
Server events with prizes should always award kiricoins, and then using kiricoins users can buy their own prizes
Anyway. We need something to do with kiricoins before we roll out the main attraction if we're doing it this way
dess_take 1 <@456226577798135808>
dess_$ <@456226577798135808>
dess_award 1 <@456226577798135808>
okay that works
dess_$ <@456226577798135808>
Especially since we're gonna roll XDU out after the initial release of kiricoins
I definitely wanna tie the emoji slot into kiricoins
The idea sounds fun, but I think individual rewards are necessary
I don't think people will form alliances for a single emoji
Which gives more flexibility in server events, because then every server event awards kiricoins
Okay, and I wanna change that to "bet on a char to win, if they win you (and everyone else who bet with you) gets kiricoins" and then you can buy the emoji for kiricoins
Wasn't it going to be a gambling set up where people guessed who wins?
Explain big sister to me again?
Since big sister will have betting instead
Big Sister will have to come after we host a kiricoin event though
We won't have much to do with kiricoins until we're in full swing and momria is online to get things going
1 or 2 days
Yeah, but like
And then we can toss out the contests and see how they do
So we'd be introducing kiricoins alongside something that people will definitely enjoy
ehhh... i feel like they're simple enough - and boring enough - that we should introduce the main incentive alongside them. Although we could start kiricoins out with symphogames just to get people introduced to the currency with a more engaging event alongside it.
that is kiricoins
so they'd be simple things attached to the wonder
and introduce both alongside kiricoins
we could alternate between caption contest and screenshot contest for variety
can't use just 1
0 or 2
but they HAVE to use both votes
that works
then everyone would vote for themselves
no voting on your own though
And people like to guess at things
Yeah, but once I've got them, it's a pretty repeatable format
I take a random screenshot from a random episode of symphogear. Crop it, post it, and people guess what season and episode it's from. This sounds entirely boring, but it's simple and easy.
screenshot contest
*drags back a dead carcass*
*goes to neopets*
i think ive
lemme just
OH
I wanna get something we can run frequently that people can earn kiricoins for though
If we just use a variety weekly would be less stale, but I get where you're coming from
There are a *lot* of sims on that site
That's something we could potentially do every week
You'll also have to teach me how to run symphogames type events
we can do all of my 3 part songs
i mean
gotta make all the scores
burnout
logistics
we can recruit from tate's discord but
i mean, we ourselves are 3 people
at the very least, we need to wait until it's at least mostly done to start teasing it
<@!102691114762371072>
Saki, avoid mentioning the xdu bot publicly at all because *each time you do it will be tempting me to reveal everything*
*shudders*
i got a steam friend request

dess_flip 100
unless for some reason we had xdu_flip alongside dess_flip
i dont think we'd ever see the tails side anyway though?
a difficult decision...
Golden Hibiki on the tails side of the Maria Tokens
But yeah, we're already using the golden Hibiki, in a more permanent and prominent position. It honestly looks kinda bad as an emoji.
Also, xdu bot
letting it be the "no one has purchased the emote slot yet" emoji is fine, I think
it's already the server AND subreddit icon
yeah
R, no one uses it
what?
We are at cap, but <:HibikiGold:370774300883419136> in particular is one I want to replace. Having it be the "purchased emoji" slot would be fine.
sounds good
<@!102691114762371072> assuming you're still awake, what schedule would the gacha rotation be on? Do we wanna swap gachas weekly, monthly, what?
I'll explain it more thoroughly tomorrow
We can talk more later then
And each bet would be a fixed number, like a raffle
You can bet on one character multiple times for increased rewards. Kiricoins will be distributed from a pool created by people betting.
So, as an event, users get to place bets on characters (they can place an unlimited amount of bets on however many characters they like) and then after the end of each round, if your characters are still standing, you get your payout. Repeat until it's over.
For Big Sister, okay first off, it goes round by round, yeah?
I just wanted to make that now before it became a problem
Oh, yeah. I'm definitely gonna do that before settling with /r/flip_flap
already taken
There's /r/flip_flappers (mostly dead, but does have movement a few times a month) and there's /r/flip_flap (which I've just created and is currently private)
But I'd wanna drum up interest here before saying "Hey guys, Flip Flappers" and then be left with a server consisting of 3 people and a paperclip
I'm actually planning on making a Flip Flappers discord if I can
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
wh
ok good no ping
Hello again, ~~@~~everyone! Remember that discussion thread I mentioned on Saturday? The one from the announcement literally 2 posts up? It's up! So if you wanna gush about Symphogear to random people *even more* then take a look on over at https://redd.it/93jzr6 ~~and remind everyone that our server exists~~!
testing...
Actually fuck it, I'll do it now since the thread is already at 100+ comments
<@!102691114762371072> can we schedule kirichan to make an announcement?
Oh we should announce that in the morning
The two are even under different headers in the guidelines
Valkyrie posts porn
The other server was literally talking about doxxing and what not to do while doxxing someone
I honestly don't think discord would bother either way. The two offenses are hugely different categories.
If it's just khairz, we damage their server without deleting it.
If Valkyrie gets nuked, people come looking at us (and also joining us and making a ruckus)
I want to nuke Khairz
But also - I don't want to nuke valkyrie
I'll do it once we can draft up some rules on it that don't automatically shut out all Symphogear porn from our server.
That's the key there
>affiliate
And they probably go harder on doxxing than porn.
They'll hit whichever IDs I send them and no more
R, they don't check. It took them an hour to open up my message, see discussion that *looked* like doxxing, and then deactivate.
And probably not permanently
That won't get *them* banned it'll get the poster banned
We need to get Khairz to fucking talk about doxxing, somewhere, anywhere.
I reported some people on another server and got their account deactivated and it took less than an hour.
HO LY SH IT
HOLY SHIT
Basically, we don't want anyone guessing about what we're doing
but i wanna limit the mysteriousness to me flipping coins in announcements the day before we start releasing the project
and i encourage you to do so because that gives us ideas
you can gush about it here
relying on ourselves is the most sustainable route
i'll take a look at how easy it is to datamine stuff though
cards aren't added more often than that
yeah i was thinking once a week
Which I assume he tries to
I think relying on louis is fine as long as he keeps relatively up to date
oh
especially if louis lags behind in adding them
we might wanna figure out how to be self-sufficient and datamine new cards ourselves
<@456226577798135808> <@!102691114762371072> would it be possible to set up a script that continuously scrapes louis's db for new cards?
doesn't look like it is
<@!102691114762371072> HOLY SHIT IS THE NEW KANADE CARD IN THE DATABASE YOU SCRAPED FROM LOUIS
im inclined to let the burnout wear off sooner so that I can get back into maple in full force on release
3 if you count man with the machine gun
2 of those
but i have like
and all of latooni's 3 part songs
It's a Symphogear server, there's only one route that I'm allowed to take.
That I make a new friend.
I wouldn't brand Khairz as an unacceptable mod just for involvement with Valkyrie, but there are far more factors that make him unsuitable anyway.
A mod must be able to clearly and easily communicate with the community.
Khairz would probably not be an eligible mod here, primarily because of his difficulty with English.
Khairz may very well have a similar thought line to me. That being the founder does not inherently mean you own the community. The difference being, I realize the role of founder comes with a necessity to curate the community, and that if things ever got to Valkyrie levels, I'd just nuke it.
```Khairz described it has “his first child that has rebelled and doesn’t want to put down”```
Khairz isn't too fond of how valkyrie acts himself, according to ibu.
But how does "Khairz the Turncoat" sound?
I... may have an idea. An idea so crazy that I'm honestly hesitant to tell you it.
And I'm gonna go out so far as to say there are some worthwhile interactions within that shit. Not enough to submerge myself in them but when they pop up that's an opportunity to save someone from the shit.
He acknowledges his mountain is shit
Like he accepts he's king of shit mountain
fucking accepted it
Didn't pull any dictionaries out on me, didn't say "but what am I supposed to call cute anime boys!" he just
Symphogi flat out accepted "okay I guess trap is a slur then" when I pointed him to some articles.
Same reason we haven't also completely closed our gates. Symphogi also listens.
He certainly likes the show enough and seems to think we're good people
Pittman I think has a lot going with just /r/anime and real life but he'd probably be a willing liaison
(also the day of the boomsday project)
7th is maria
there it is

from when we were more focused on the subreddit itself
uhhhh we have a list of birthdays in here somewhere
It's the 29th
```
IcebingoToday at 7:52 PM
Are you guys planning anything for the live 2018 release?``` are we
I said it'd make you angry, but I'll refrain from doing so next time
<@456226577798135808> might wanna take a look at the admin server. and valk's "serious" channel if you feel like getting angry.
I admit that I have not looked at the role list recently and have no clue what you're talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41wkYFdSSjg IMA WA MURI NANO
robot robots and robot girls
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKsHIZLhvVo it's a game about robot girls
<@99695384296701952> I half expect you to know what cosbreak is
OH MY GOD THERE'S A COSBREAK SET
how do i find the base set on this site
can you give me a link?
what's the site for this again?
like, most responses in base are 1 or 2 words
a lot of them are very specific
I think we might wanna go over the cards a bit once i've dug up the base set
or do i have to find a source myself
can you also show me the base set like that?
maybe just 1/2
It's gotta be like... at least 3/4 as big as the base set to work well i think
god dammit r
can you show me how big it is?
I'd ideally wanna play with both the symphogear and base set, but I don't want the base set to overrun the symphoset
hmm... could we expand the deck?
CAH sounds good
I don't wanna roll out kiricoins yet
mafia or symphogames or anything?
also 3) do we wanna do anything else on that day?
at least make sure the image ALSO features maria herself
fiiiiiine
I'm gonna be neck deep in Dr Boom that day, so 1) R, I'm gonna ask you to change the picture for that one and 2) we need a good image
Anyway - Maria's birthday is on the 7th
Ah, I'd forgotten about that.
Probably.
yeah that's exactly why I need you to sit it out
I expect no help on this matter. In fact, I want no help on this matter - R, I need you to sit this one out.
I plan on no deception, and no subterfuge. I will go to Khairz, become his friend, and have an earnest talk about Valkyrie, his involvement, and how he feels.
Both are desirable.
But I CAN encourage khairz to start breaking the mold, or simply leaving
I'm honestly not expecting Valkyrie to be deleted over this
Khairz knows nothing about soiguess, other than the fact that I want guess gone.
https://www.quora.com/Is-a-DDoS-attack-illegal
It is a felony, but you can always try and taunt a "you're welcome to try" out of him
Honestly? Fuck valkyrie, I want to destroy bingo more than anything else.
we can set up a custom install but i dont wanna bother
welp
i want to see which base sets they have
yes give me the link to xyzzy
you import to xyzzy
oh
so you can't play without the base sets?
Whatever it is, it doesn't leave the realm of our control. And that includes reddit, don't post shit to reddit.
Well it's all figured out for you. I'll send you the stuff from louis, *but you need to not tell a soul*. You can't drop the images around randomly either. Keep it to the discord and whatever website you set up to host our improved XDU.
<@!102691114762371072> you'll be doing the datamining yourself, right?
Gonna want to do heavy editing once this is done
Or worse, figure out how we're using them
Basically we don't want the devs to figure out we can do this.
Gonna wait a bit for a response and if he says nothing I'm forwarding it all to Kriisa
Alright.
```louis - Today at 11:26 PM
then you go take a nap until it's done loading
i'd prefer if you didn't post stuff random places if you give it to saki``` are we clear to tell just louis about the xdu project?
louis is giving me `the dump` but it's a secretive thing so I can only tell one person if he says okay
<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
ha! i've already beaten you. every character is good
alright, that's about all i wanted from people who havent seen it yet
so, who's on board with a flip flappers discord once i drum up interest for it?
oh, archived
is that archived or current?
```louis - Today at 11:30 PM
don't start a tumblr blog and don't start tweeting them at japs```I think he's afraid of the devs shutting things down
we can do random kiricoin drops
but maybe f2p games would work
I don't want people to be left out of kiricoin chances just because they don't have the game
yeah that's the tricky bit
but also giving people coins for playing OJ with the server would be pretty neat
Kinda don't wanna because it necessitates owning OJ to participate
OJ as a kiricoin generator...
the deed is done
I just need to make everything clear because louis gave this to me in confidence and while he has publicly said that our server sounds terrible, he's giving me his trust and I need to respect that.
you could argue that streaming has a victim
approved crimes only here
be gay, do crimes, but only the good crimes like smoking weed or having sex at 2 am in an empty park
don't do illegal shit likely to get us in trouble
*says this while planning cytube rewatches*
at least don't do illegal shit with victims
that being said, don't do illegal shit in the name of this community
we've asked, twice
same
but yeah no this dude? actually gets character development
so i'll call him kkk dude
anyway, the main antagonist doesn't actually have a name
can't we change how the logging works?
but he's a good character
I'm not saying he's likable or that he's "husbando material"
how is a spoiler, yeah
even the main antagonist? the dude who wears a literal klansman robe? he's a good character
but really, every character is good
if it's not hidaka im going to be very disappointed in you if we never bring shirabe over too for a cocopapi bot pair
there is one important thing
BUT
Anyway Saki, you can totally choose which character is the nadeko install if we make a flip flappers server
please never use tts
its enabled for custodians
dess_qdel 59
but he said no once and fuck it if I'm gonna keep pushing after that
obsessed with what having a vagina is like
I mentioned it to wfc once because he's like
Yeah it's like... I'll call people out on eggy behavior? But once they say "no I'm fine" then that's all they are. Flags coming from a cis person.
Latooni, I respect your gender and you are valid, but there are *so* many flags
You're dating 2 lesbians
Trying real hard not to make an egg joke here
*I asked to lick her thighs and it still took like 3 months*
Both of us were constantly flirting with each other for like 2 years straight.
The only reason I asked is because I too, am incredibly oblivious.

Eight years. I've known Lyssa for eight years and we've been dating for one.
Are you aware of how much you two were firting beforehand anyway?
Anyway I think I'll contact /r/flip_flappers tomorrow. Sometime after pittman responds to that question.
otakon used to be baltimore
there won't be a lot of people in the rewatch threads
the biggest hurdle I'm anticipating is that flip flap has no community, so we can't do a community spotlight, so it's gonna be hard to build a community
nah, they have an actual person who made their sub
otakon is in dc
so that gives me time to get in contact with the flip flap mods and bug pittman for some help maybe
also I'm gonna get started AFTER otakon because i don't want that getting in the way
The amount of pushing will be "hey guys this is a thing that's happening"
The way I'm gonna try and swing it is
Run rewatches here and on /r/anime > draw attention to /r/flip_flappers (or /r/flip_flap if I have to) > use the flip flappers discord and subreddit for all future flip flappers stuff
oh, no. I'm not demanding any of you to help out with this.
flip flappers is very good though and i think you'll like it
i trust you with a full staff position so i mean, if bot maiden is all you want then sure
and even tinier since i kick the assholes out
no this is serious. I can handle two anime communities with tiny fanbases
shouldn't harm this one at all
I just wanna leverage this community in order to seed another
after i run the rewatch here and on /r/anime, I'm going to focus 100% of flip flappers stuff into flip flappers spaces
I'm asking you all because you already mod here and I trust you with being mods
No, I want a flip flappers community to exist so I am going to create one with my own two hands
after that, I wanna focus on flip flappers being its own thing
here for live rewatch, /r/anime for forum rewatch
I don't want the two communities linked, but I wanna do the rewatch here to get more people interested in flip flappers
one of the episodes has a giant robot
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
lesbians
mostly the creation of a discord and associated rewatch stuff
mods of /r/flip_flappers seem cool by post history. I'm gonna go propose some... intercommunity events to them
anyway
I WANT A FLIP FLAPPERS MOVIE DAMMIT
but i argue that my crime is actually good for the "victim" because who the fuck watched flip flappers to begin with?
okay good don't have to go to valkyrie for that anymore

It's okay R we'll find a mod for you to date.
yeah
(also I do run a trans-exclusive con meetup server which is populated by like seven cool people in case you ever think about going to an east coast con Saki)
But yeah, basically. There's a lot of common things that happen in trans-exclusive spaces that don't happen here and I don't know why but I'm enjoying it nonetheless.
Also not my style: "You're cute" "No you're cute" "No you"

Listen you fucks you're all cute.
It's *super* draining. And I'm saying that as someone who voluntarily goes out of her way to help people with their issues.
I'm done with the hugs stage and I wanna move on.
I get it too. Being trans sucks a lot of the time, and a lot of the time there's no real solution. Especially for minors. But at the same time, that's not where I'm at in my life and I just wanna talk about hearthstone or whatever.
There's also the like

constant stream of `*hugs*` and while that's okay it's like... not my style. I mean like sure, sometimes someone has some heavy shit to unload in <#336297840529899522> and it warrants a headpat but in trans spaces that is a daily occurrence.
I've never liked trans spaces all that much anyway. There's always a particular brand of drama that comes from any moderately sized trans space.
Turns out, creating trans-friendly spaces that aren't explicitly trans spaces is good.

this is like the third haircut this week

"yeah that's solid, I can totally go with this"

does anyone want to read the thing so i can fix what needs fixing or go forward with what needs forwarding because i don't see myself calming down any time soon so now i need to just write nonstop until i get this out of my system
Okay. Okay I'm done with one page of the fic. I think most of it is okay? I think I can leave it at this for today.
Toward Latooni? Go for it.
which heterosexual reasons
~~I may or may not be using Hibiki as a self-insert~~
Because it'd be more consistent both with how I'm writing Miku and with my own experiences.
I'd rather Miku make a suggestion and Hibiki come to the wrong conclusion.
I don't want to have Miku make a mistake. It would go against how I plan on writing her in basically every other interaction.
but also Miku is far more of a supportive backbone for Hibiki in this AU and I'm not sure that this Miku WOULD tell her to talk to him
that still doesn't explain anything
yes
trying to figure out how that happened *in the show*
trying to fucking figure out what could possibly make Hibiki agree to talk to the guy when she's terrified of him
I'm legit struggling with writing Akira because he's *actually* a gigantic piece of shit. I literally cannot write a character as bad as Akira.
today in Alice uses way too fucking many ellipses

you're welcome
because im not writing
where i get anxious
i think it was writing anxiety
but also writing. but also anxiety.

and i dont know if the anxiety is popping up randomly or if i'm forgetting something important or if writing this fic is legitimately triggering me

god that's formatted terribly

You picked a good time to message me though! A user has mentioned to me that they hesitate on interacting with you because of how you ping people that show interest in things once, and it's behavior I've noticed myself. Could you ask people if they wanna be pinged with related content before you start doing it going forward? Pinging people is fine, just make sure they're okay with it too.``````

<@456226577798135808> Remember not to fuck things up. The users are not receptive to your warnings.
keeps refreshing
the user list is going fucking nuts for me
sure
you're clean saki
and liberal pinging
investigation
excuse me as i do some
here's hecate
don't fuck things up and all clear from me
i accidentally invited you to a group
i think so
probably a bot that's going around and dming people links or something
just ban him, they aren't skittish if they've joined and left 3 times
That I made
I'm specifically talking about the one named Captain Hook
<@!102691114762371072> are you using the server widget anywhere? And do you know what that first webhook is for?
Bingo being able to go right off and fuck himself aside, <@456226577798135808> I don't give a shit about the logs, I was there, once bingo slides me that shit on Tuesday I'll show Latooni and Saki if they care and you consent, but you were told like three times to get off your shit before they banned you. While Valkyrie can very well go fuck themselves, I am *slightly* concerned over what that says about you as a person and while normally I'd go to a custodian over an issue like this, *you're the fucking custodian*. Can you offer me any peace of mind for that sort of thing not being a worthy issue to be concerned about here?
"We can't give you full logs of the server split because we don't have consent from all involved."

"Oh but we can totally give you full logs of us dismissing privacy concerns as long as it involves you actioning one of your mods"
Or do an API call
Yeah, same here. Anyone can just... use discord's search feature.
Also maybe it would be a good idea in the wake of all this to tell people that we keep logs?
Lyssaaaaaaaaaa
ill message them myself
yeah just a delete there
the thermometer?
what did they post
Thank you.
It'll make you feel like shit, it'll make them feel justified, and at a certain point I'm going to have to put my foot down and please do not make me do that.
There is absolutely zero gain to be had yelling at them in admin chat.
I'm getting complaints, from users on our server, about you. I'm not gonna do shit about it because you're not doing it on our server, but I'd like if you chilled out. <@456226577798135808>
<@456226577798135808>
```Our server was indexed by these bots before we became aware of this issue``` no it wasnt
she probably has that server muted
nope
her
<@108011348616609792>
hahahahaha melissa just fucking dropped from valk because of the issue
The link should be perfectly safe in the sense that no malware can be acquired through it. It likely installs a cookie on your browser and logs your IP, but literally every website does that.
Valkyrie is on there now, even though all of the bots are banned.
Banning the bots does nothing. Delisting is the only thing that actually does anything. If the bot pops up once, the server will eventually be indexed as long as it's visible on discord.me.
I'll drop a link here once I'm done setting it up
I'm using this as the image for the icon right now and honestly same
I'm gonna wait and unveil it later on.
that's really what got this server moving is hieroglyphs
hmm... do I wanna start the flip flappers server off with a hieroglyphs channel or add it once there are enough users in order to spark activity
Alright.
You cool with me showing Latooni and Saki the logs if they want when bingo gives them to me?
Alright.
im gonna do it. I will be the rallying force by which a cohesive flip flappers community may form.
kk
oh well, the hook seems benign
ok saki was made mod on the 21st
what the fuck did i need a webhook on may 21st for
when did i make the discord.me page? I'm pretty sure it was before saki was mod.
but saki did not ask for a webhook on that day...
i think i made the hook for saki
it was on may 21st
okaay wait hang on no
Make your girlfriend look at the webhooks so I can figure out whether this thing should be deleted or not <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
the eyelid more accurately but it's not as fun to say it that way
yeah
she had a massive advantage because my turn was right after hers
she also kissed my eye once while we were playing OJ and trying to mess each other up during our turns
kissing is dangerous
hey <@285555416056856576> remember that one time I passed out while you were kissing me because I got caught up fantasizing about kissing you
i take it saki is next to you
I'd buy the "he was just trying to find our server" excuse if *he hadn't left on valk too*
same user did a join/leave here
this might be an incredibly transparent attempt to sneak shit past us
Gonna disable the widget for now because I'm pretty sure that was 100% discord.me
I feel like I made a webhook for you at some point? Take a closer look when you're not driving so that your boyfriend doesn't kill me for getting you into an accident.
Do you only see the Shirabe.exe webhook?
is that the serenacon picture
we need to play a test of this, how many people do we need for a game?
what is this
gonna have two live watches a day, one for na and one for eu
since im gonna tie it in with threads on /r/anime
speaking of which, I'm gonna ask ibu to run half of the flip flappers watch
Rather than the other way around
I think ibu would be god damn ecstatic if we approached her for something
quiplash?
I will be playing Hearthstone and going to the doctor early in the day and i don't know when Lyssa is getting here but if it's Tuesday I may be occupied for the later parts of that day.
yes
make shirabe swap your names at random intervals
you need to just randomly swap names with the maria bot sometimes
wait but maria is gonna be the xdu bot...
is it cah?
anyway 2 days until maria's birthday have we figured out what we're doing yet?
id fuck those guns tbh

THAT'S A TWEET
SOIEFJSEOIGFJ
Which one of you is the tsubasa and which is the maria
Interestingly, Chris is also the 7th wheel
Don't be like that.

You're the fifth wheel.
anyway yeah Lyssa needs to get a switch so I can play with her joycon
i think its the only one
oh
dess_.. Latooni
how do i access them
I
dess_liqu
dess_liqu Latooni
<@285555416056856576> We need to get switches we can't afford to lose out in this innuendo war.
If they're not receptive I'll just go with the one I made though
Since there's already a 3Hz server, I DMed the owner to see if anything could be done with their server instead. We'd be starting out with more users and we'd have more reach because it'd be a 3Hz server rather than a Flip Flappers server
I strongly dislike things that are not instant.
That invite link expires in a day, ask me again if it's gone when you wanna join.
https://discord.gg/E9PB52 here is the server currently. There's a more general 3Hz Studio server which might be better suited for what I'm trying to do but might as well throw up a flip flappers specific server for now anyway. Whenever a mod for the 3Hz server shows up I'll bug them about `collaboration`
i like the idea of a narrative focused event
we can do symphogames for mariacon
anyone else needs the proper roles
ok, sparkle and amity get overrides for serenacon
does amity like the serenacon joke?
but we won't tell anyone the secret to posting there
amity and anyone with a maria role can post to serenacon
no harassing amity they're nice
Yes
i vote we just make a serenacon channel but no one can post in it
They told me that I pretty much have free reign but I'd like to keep them around since they seem decent
also... the flip flap mods are either pretty busy or ridiculously hands off
no
Oct 15

I'll be awake at midnight probably
Only me and R
Actually I don't think you can change it at all
This is mostly an American server
Swap at 12-3 am est
If I can't grab top mom go with she
Yeah
He admitted a mistake, which is good
This server is mostly a blank slate. I don't wanna judge people based on their interactions in valk unless they meet the criteria for "yeah no". His attitude in valk can inform decisions but I don't wanna start him off with being on thin ice.
Can we get a view of that conversation? Probably important in handling him going forward.
Because I think that line perfectly encapsulates the idea of a joke where you're like "it's only racist because you made it racist!" no you fuck, the joke itself is racist and is trying to guide the viewer's assumptions through show don't tell.
By the way you've got full permission to use my "kinda maybe not really but actually yes" line
If I have to expel some edgy teenagers in order to maintain proper order on the server then that's just part of cultivating a community.
I've got a feeling on who might have sent in that anonymous tip but I can see more than one person bringing it up so I guess shoot them a DM to take a look at anouncements
Any rewrite of the rules is going to need to be able to explicitly define what does and does not earn you a formal warning from kirichan.
Yeah, I don't wanna keep talking to people because they make edgy jokes because honestly there's nothing in the rules that says "don't do that"
Gonna go ahead and say open workshop on figuring out how exactly to redefine rule 1 since I have a haircut today and I'm gone in 20 minutes.
announcement announced
so if you're not gonna talk about it with jim directly tell me that too
later today might be in like 5 minutes or it might be in 5 hours i honestly dont know
Delete the image, up to you whether you wanna talk to him about it, tell me if you do, I'm making an announcement later today.
this is literally the worst day for this stuff to be popping up
and even if it's not it's still making a pedo joke
the joke is clearly expecting/goading you to view it as racially charged
as for the "it's totally not racist" thing I'm inclined to just say hard pass.
ok well wobbles isn't an issue i guess
keep an eye on him, make sure he keeps the edge down, and repeated verbal warnings should lead to an actual warning
I'm dilating right now and I have to get dressed afterwards so if you're able to do the talking that'd be good. Otherwise I'll get to it.
First incident so I'd say just a talking  to should be enough right now. If he does it again we go from there.
the fact that someone complained definitely puts it well into "we need to talk" territory
like the comment itself
Okay, so I'm not sure if we should treat this with more or less severity than suicide jokes

oh nice
i dont understand
Yeah I guessed
I just got done with a phantom appointment. I wish you luck.
I'm gonna check with parm if she'd let us use her art but there should be enough official art if we have to
<@456226577798135808> would you be up for helping with making fancy graphics to advertise stuff with? Stuff like our sidebar, rules page, and maybe an infographic or two.
The Flip Flappers Initiative is going well. I think that's most of the "hey let's work together" stuff out of the way. Now... fancy graphics. And also poking pittman.
What was the image?
spectators is workable though. We'd need 3 event coordinators (or two if neither wants to participate)
true
breeds contempt?
Pick your champion and get bonus coins based on how well they do
wait. How about instead of spectator coins, we do it's HCT style
1st place would get an emote of their choice and a custom role OR a permanent kiri command.
2nd place gets a custom role OR a permanent kiri command, whichever first place didn't take
3rd - 4th place get temporary kiri commands
Maybe kiricoins for winning in later non-f2p tournaments
Oh, definitely. I wanna give kiricoins for entering, kiricoins for winning, hell, kiricoins for just spectating
the game IS technically F2P, and "pauper but with a few legendaries" seems interesting enough of a format
but something to think about
not an immediate thing
yeah
I'd wanna do it like the month of a standard rotation
but how often do you meet that goal, really?
Biggest obstacle is people who can hit the 100 daily gold do have an advantage
And other than that, just buying packs from the shop is fine.
Especially with a friend.
Quests don't take THAT long
And I'd offer tips and pointers on people crafting the best deck that they can.
Like arena would need you to be a god for you to be getting value out of it consistently.
Being good at arena doesn't offer you a HUGE advantage and we can always game quests through friendly battles
Ok so, major events and birthdays aside, what do you guys feel about running server Hearthstone tournaments? For at least the very first one, we could ease people into it by doing an F2P tournament. Make a new account on NA, spend a month doing dailies and stuff to build a collection, and then at the end of the month everyone makes/picks a deck and we do a Bo3 swiss format or round robin.

Spending money on the account for this would be a disqualifier, but I don't feel like there'd be a need to check. And we can hold more serious tournaments with a more standard format in the future for people who do want to play with a proper deck that they spent money on.
Just remember that you are important <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
And you do what you need to do Kriisa.
It's uh... the server could use some work but it's serviceable. I'm not gonna push for much until after Otakon.
https://discord.gg/qMjRZVM by the way here is the link to the 3Hz server, current base and headquarters of The Flip Flappers Initiative.
maximom
Except for Maria she's like maximum mom
Now that I'm not freaking out over The Meeting I can go back to planning Flip Flappers
I can handle the prompts from there.
I'll wait to reveal votes until Latooni is able to vote, but other than that... writing prompts. This is the big one. I'd like it if you still came up with writing prompts and just threw a random one at us every 2 weeks.
<@99695384296701952> are you free right now? Might wanna take a look at the last few messages sent.
In the event of a tie, we'll find a tie breaker.
The candidates right now are Latooni and Saki.
DM me your vote, and once all the votes are in, I'll reveal them. You can vote for yourself, for no one, for everyone, whatever you prefer.
Alright. Rules are simple, and same as last time.
Shall we get that voting over with sooner rather than later? We can do it now.
Custodian is an elected position, and no one person's vote is greater than another. You are allowed to abstain, of course, and you're allowed to vote for more than one person.
okay
I'd like a hint at least
...is it meeting time
okay
uhhhhh
Ways To Make Alice Anxious
do i need to start panicking
Help is the server falling apart
What happened while I was off at my doctor's appointment that didn't actually exist
What is the meeting about?
Activity being discussion anywhere on the server, but especially outside of this channel. And I'm saying arbitrary right now because if the answer to that is "no" then we need to define it. If the answer is "yes" then we need to define something entirely different, which is what situations DO get you off the list. But lets say active in discussions outside of the submarine at least once a week.
Okay. Let's hold a few series of votes then. And there'll be no exceptions for anyone.

First: Should anyone who doesn't meet an arbitrary activity threshold be allowed to sit as a custodian?
```I personally think that was a mistake, since there were a couple moments (mostly the ones that involved a lot of anger) where I kinda doubted that decision``` was what I said initially.
I already mentioned it a few messages up.
Both here and on valkyrie.
The actual reason would be the volatility he has displayed in the past.
And whoever gets owner status if that happens can decide to overrule my decision about Lyssa. Hell, you all can override my decision if you think it's a big enough issue.
Right now I'm active.
If I become inactive, I will do that.
I can do that, yes.
...not that anyone else can do it
I will personally demote myself from owner if I ever become inactive.
Mostly because of the whole ```I personally think that was a mistake, since there were a couple moments (mostly the ones that involved a lot of anger) where I kinda doubted that decision```thing. I have absolute trust in Lyssa. I do not have absolute trust in anyone else, period, so if you're not active on the server I don't feel like you should be sitting with the Custodian role.
I don't wanna leave you on as Custodian while you're not active. Lyssa is a different case because I literally trust her with my life and she is a convenient tie breaker.
We can color revolution once we actually make color roles
Ok, lets leave it as is. It's been too long and the entire reason we have special colors for mod roles is for ease of identification.
yeah...
How about blue custodian, yellow illuminati, and green alchemist?
but that's a necessary sacrifice
purple
well
I do like being blue
I veto the green. I refuse to be green.
we can do that
or that
oh
Additionally, since Saki will become yellow, R and Latooni, do you guys wanna stay green or revert back to light blue?
I'm sorry you're both just too green.
i made a typo
That being said, Kriisa wants at least a day before assuming the new role, and I don't know how long R would like to hold on to it.
I actually could've announced that before Latooni voted but I didn't wanna leave him out of the process.
Votes!

Alice: Kriisa
Kriisa: Kriisa
Latooni: Kriisa
R: No one
That said, I don't expect that I'll have to do that.

Don't quote me on that.
Some stuff to go over beforehand.

When we elected R last time, we elected him flat out. I personally think that was a mistake, since there were a couple moments (mostly the ones that involved a lot of anger) where I kinda doubted that decision, but I didn't wanna be an asshole and pull out the server owner card. That card is reserved for emergencies. So, whoever gets elected is being given a probationary role. You will allowed to act as a Custodian with all the responsibility and power that comes with it, but if something happens and I feel like we need to discuss the matter again, I hold that right.
The votes are in!
And I think "better responses" is the right solution. Lowering the rate is just gonna make it annoying less often.
I kinda get annoyed at Shirabe too so I'm kinda with lucy on it
Should yelling in here hold the same weight as yelling elsewhere?
okay. So both. Which, lets talk about behavior. What behavior counts? R has been more than a little aggressive in here in the past, but he doesn't take it out into public channels.
Both means "behavior" and "huh haven't seen them recently"
You don't get a full vote, but your opinions are still important. Do we wanna go with just once in a while or do we wanna go with both? I stick with both since... why not?
and yeah, some kind of "well it's time for your monthly review" not a good idea
Latooni says once in a while if we wanna use that for a tiebreaker, or go with both
Okay, so between custodians we have Lyssa saying if there's a problem, R saying once in a while, and me saying both.
When they've done something to raise questions? Once a month? When?
I do want to talk about moderator behavior but first, between the current custodians - that's me, R, and Lyssa - when exactly do we re-evaluate a particular moderator's case?
Okay, so are we going with case-by-case?
(tag yourself I'm all around spectacular)
Some moderators are just all around spectacular.
I am personally for case-by-case. One moderator might be quiet but consistent with reading damn near everything. Another moderator might not be terrible active, but still incredibly trustworthy. One moderator might be active but their behavior might raise questions.
Y'all got hung up on what the arbitrary number was. We don't need a number at all.
Can I just point out that my initial question was about if we set a number at all?
However we decide to rule this will apply equally to everyone. Previously we didn't have a rule at all.
I'm aiming this concern at custodians in general.
Make a mess is vague. It can mean shotgun bans, it can mean telling people to post in the wrong channel.
My main concern is that a mod that we have less contact with than desired or a mod who straight up doesn't know what the rulings should be might come here and just... make a mess, intentionally or not. I never had this concern with Lyssa because I trust her absolutely, but if we're having a serious discussion about this then I'm not the only one who has an opinion that matters.
In essence, a lot of this is about you.
I'd like to figure out if you SHOULD de-custodian before you actually do.
And like I said, we're dropping special exceptions. If there was a special exception earlier it's being removed. And yeah, I don't either. But how else do I define "active"?
Yes. We're still on that.
Discussion of what?
I don't know how much higher, it's hard to quantify discussion.
I think it should be higher than that.
And I say once a week since that is the amount of time that R has guaranteed he'd have available here.
A moderator who is active with and engages with the community better understands what the community needs at any given time.
To what end of what?
And yes R, you get a vote.
So, in the interest of this not being an endless dunkfestival, lets take a final vote on whether R is Custodian or Illuminati if he's not interested in defending himself.
Same.
And, like Latooni said, acknowledgement is also good.
This should not be a situation of earning more ire. If you have legitimate counters to concerns we're raising, you should bring them up.
\たのし！/
Wasn't that the breaking reddit rules thing?
So yeah, my stance on valk has gone from "try to get rid of the bad things there so that we can have two symphogear servers that are good" to "okay no it's all fucked burn it to the ground" to "whatever I guess"
If they make a massive fuckup then I just wanna look at the massive fuckup and say "well golly gee let's not do that I guess"
Like the valk saga is over. I do not like them. They are not going to change.
I'd rather just ignore valk's existence right now.
I do not care at this point.
And the "i wanna global ping a lot" thing
There was also the "volunteering to do the spotlight intro and then getting angry when we pointed out the deadline" thing. And the "let's break reddit rules because I don't like them" thing.
That was also pre-custodian I think?
I'm gonna counter the last bit with saying he actually hasn't done that much since becoming a custodian, unless my memory is spotty. What were the disagreements in the past, again? I remember one was about banning people for stuff they've said off the server, which, yeah that was bad.
You may.
Saki, can I ask you to expand on that a bit more? Why don't you feel comfortable with R in that position?
I'm not even considering valk here.
No you've definitely yelled at us before.
Okay, so next on the list:
Should R be a custodian? If not, should he be a different moderator role? I think he should be stepped down to Illuminati, because while his experience is amazing to have and his participation with events is honestly outstanding, Custodian is in the end a "mod of mods" role and we get the same experience and participation with him as Illuminati. As for a reason why to step him down, he's gotten better recently and I absolutely would be open to a re-evaluation as time goes forward, but he yells a lot. In angry ways. At moderators, about how they moderate. I'm not entirely sure that's the best personality fit for a "mod of mods" role.
oh, ok
Saki hasn't weighed in on Lyssa yet
Same to the earlier thing. I think I rope you into my stupid bullshit enough as is.
Same. And also you pretty consistently are capable of taking volatile discussions and making things stable so I think you're an amazing asset.
(please wait while we fix technical difficulties with saki.exe)
Behold: The reason I never made a rule on that.
Ok. Going down the list:
Should Lyssa be a custodian? If not, should she be a different moderator role? Personally I think she's fine where she is and that there shouldn't be any issues with her keeping the role. She's proven helpful in plenty of discussions before.
Can we agree on that?
So, since we're going off of behavior, lets just... set an initial evaluation right now and then go from there?
Okay. I can get behind all that.
don't kill latooni please
missing comma
uh
Okay, shoot Latooni
Do you have any particular reason why you SHOULD stay custodian, R?
Before anyone else has their input
that one you ceded on and didn't get terribly angry
R, I used to use newgrounds. I've already known both, I was just checking which one.
yeah I was getting them mixed up.
That was it.
Just, to check on that "mcf founder" thing, you mean Coelasquid?
no
Take your time.
Absolutely.
i was gonna say i like your legs
oh i got distracted earlier
wait i might have actually cleaned it
bits stuck to the sides
i mean i ate most of it but theres like
there was a lot of cake
but theres cake in it
yes
uh
honestly I could probably give you a key at this point
I still get a pavlovian response if I hear the notification while awake sometimes though
boston has made me immune to line wakeups
ill probably be asleep
uhhhhhhhh call me once you're here i guess
<@285555416056856576> you're gonna be here around 3?
wait
wait dont you have your laptop? you can just make it once you're unpacked
right
GUN!
why cant it be a reaction like
alright
instead of a quote
you were gonna make that an actual command
<@!102691114762371072> pls fix
For what it's worth, I'm holding him to that "I'll get better". When he was promoted he'd only gotten heated like one or twice at that point so I figured that the good outweighed the bad, but then he started yelling more.
Some points were also a bit in the territory of "why is this being brought up in *this* context?"
No. Your criticisms and R's responses both play heavily into my own decisions.
Well, the executive decision is in light of the conversation we've been having. You're informing that decision.
Aren't you going to be here tomorrow night?
^
I can't say a lot about what they are. I legitimately cannot. Doing so would be a massive breach of trust. But I am going to say that I will probably make an executive decision on the case of R based on private information and I need you to trust in me that I'll be making a good decision.
I'm personally for waiting. I'd like R to be here for it.
Alright. I'm gonna defer any judgment on R to tomorrow. I have... things in mind. Do we wanna continue at all with this for me, Latooni, and Saki now or do we wanna call it off until tomorrow?
oh you have your phone
Lyssa leaves the room immediately as I say this.
The point of stepping down or the point of him being reinstated or the point of stepping him down only to reinstate him later?
Are there any objections to this?
Ok, so the decision I'm making here is that R shall be stepped down to Illuminati for now, and I'll be keeping an eye on his behavior and he will be reinstated as a Custodian (with the same probationary restrictions Saki is getting) at a later date.

Publicly we're saying that this is because of classes starting and him having less time.
I'm here, Latooni's here, you're here, is <@456226577798135808> here?
zenbus

okay tell us when you're available
Yes I know Lyssa's offline, she's literally next to me
continuing last night's discussion. Is everyone availabe?
does that mean yes now or no now
*Moderator Evaluation Coliseum*
but what about talking
(jazz starts playing)
in a "she's in the bathroom so I'm not" manner
Lyssa is currently preventing me from brushing my teeth
fucking fuck i need nitro so i can papika at you
<@285555416056856576> I like sanding my face on your chin though
fun fact before me and lyssa started dating i asked to lick her legs for science
~~and licking them~~
If I moved myself to a lesser role I'd hand owner off which is... a big reason I'd say no. I would trust Lyssa with it, but she's not around enough. Saki, I'm not sure I would trust with owner. I haven't known her long enough and a huge part of my vision for this community is that owner doesn't actually mean anything besides an undemotable role.
Ok I got my phone so we can talk and eat at the same time
(slight recess as me and Lyssa eat our food just got here)
Honestly? I'm not gonna say that I've made 100% good calls in the past. I'm pretty sure I've made more bad calls than good calls even. I don't think it's theatrics, I wanna make sure that I should have the role I do.
I said no exceptions.
Ok, so next on the list.

Should I be a custodian? If not, should I be a different moderator role? I'll refrain from any input here until everyone else has said their part.
I never intended anything else.
If we have to delay it we will
I don't want bad votes made because of bad moods
We can see if your mood gets better over the course of the day?
uhhhhhhhh we could delay the voting but that would push it back to like... monday, earliest.
<@99695384296701952> and <@456226577798135808>?
But I'll count that as a current 2 votes for demotion, 1 vote for no action
Saki is also being promoted at the same time (unless for some reason she isn't?)
The discussion is 100% on "Do we demote at all?"
Or arm. Is it arm or hand?
Yeah no hand wringing.
I will say that the private information is something that R does not feel comfortable having shared. If he wants to go out and say it, he can.
I will personally evaluate it, in conjunction with how that private information develops.
I have similar feelings, especially in light of the defenses he gave last night.
The private information is purely for the guarantee that he'll be given a second shot. If there's no reason to demote him, then... we don't? But both me and Saki said "demote". So I'll say it again.

Should R be a custodian? If not, should he be a different moderator role?
I absolutely 100% do want to have a specific reason that we are demoting him.
Well the point of it is that Custodian is the "who moderates the moderators" role and someone who gets heated the way R does might not be terribly fit for moderating moderators, even if they are fit for moderating users.
Yes, he suggested the excuse, I suggested the temporary demotion
Personally I don't think valk would even notice. Like no one would bring it up there. But the point about our own users still stands and I think it's valid enough in that context regardless.
<@99695384296701952> this is why we tell them it's because of classes
And the fact that it all ties back into the fact that R gets very angry.
Mostly because of the long list of criticisms that both Saki and I have raised.
we can remove mention capabilities after the fact
make colors mentionable, provide a list of colored names, and let people go from there
we can cheat around it
aaaactually
Some people are actually Serena fans and while we plan to meme on her birthday she's still there
Color me kirika green?
Two airgetlam users too
Override colors should be named something like "Hibiki Orange" or "Elfnein Blue"
No relic. We have 3 gungnir users, Shen Shou Jing is a spoiler, and we have tons of characters without relics
Any custom colors not on the list would be a kiricoin incentive.
No, we'd just remove moderator colors and have us using the same color overrides as everyone else.
the changes to moderation colors, not the changes to the server as a whole. Users will get color overrides regardless.
If it works out, the 1 or 3 colors we have for moderation will be added as custom colors. If it doesn't, we revert the changes
I propose we set aside 1 or 3 colors as moderation specific, leave them unused for a bit, and see how things go with mods using custom colors like everyone else.
People here generally respect one another, and *not* respecting one another is a very good way to get warned.
And the community moderates itself half the time anyway, so like... what's it matter if the person who tells you to take it to serious discussion has a purple name?
Now, if someone gets a warning, "flashing the badge" comes in the form of a warn from Kiri
My argument is that, past Lyssa, everyone knows who we are based on name alone. As for "flashing the badge" that was an argument I made back before Kirichan handled warnings.
Ok. I'll update your roles real quick and make an announcement, unless this is a bad time to do so.
now <@!102691114762371072> should we discuss the color stuff?
that works
but final verdict is R > Illuminati (for now) and Saki > Custodian (for now)
got a bit slippery at the end
anyway
Saki take the wheel
Wait hang on I get to be stepped on if I demote myself?
Latoonilluminati, for Illuminati solidarity
Anyway, yes on saki, but then latooni. Latooni I'm going to vote no on for right now, for very similar reasons that R votes no on saki. I think Latooni is dealing with a lot lately and that's not necessarily the best state to be in for this.
Well. We also need to discuss Latooni. Because there's no rule that we only had to promote one person.
Personally, I voted yes to the promotion yesterday specifically because she seemed to have a clear head and know where she wanted to go from wherever she is. I see no problems with her as custodian.
Alright. Let's move on then. No sense in inflating that ego. Should Saki be a custodian? If not, should she be a different moderator role?
can we color shift Shirabe to being a more carnation pink?
But Genjuurou is a kinda long name
someone, somewhere out there thinks Fou should be Fo
Fou too
Names like Fuu or Togou look a lot better without truncation
Genjuurou is an odd case, because it's the rare incident where it looks kinda weird without truncation
no changing!
all the emotes are genjuurou though
I suppose we can do Genjuro for stylistic purposes
I also tend towards Genjuurou over other spellings because truncating long vowels is bullshit and we can't use the little bar thing even if we wanted to
she's based off of Francois Prelati
Prelati, not Praelati
i mean you can very easily convert decimal to hex
165/141/81

Brown.
We have the idea now and we should prepare for it while it's convenient
The issue is I don't want to suddenly change any marias to a different color during serenacon prep
and no
Oct 15
it's the only way it'll work and this is the best time to do it
we have to
oh, while we're doing all this, drop maria to the bottom of the character roles in prep for serenacon memes
make illuminati bright pink for ibu. subtle acknowledgment to her consistent participation on the server
at a certain point unique stops being unique
Ideally I'd wanna give all 3 a unique color but
yeah, that could work
people like them
Illuminati could work
Maybe not bridge bunny
I say stick to just SONG + Carol initially
oh
Carol can be an exception given that 1) she has an official character color and 2) if we have elfnein people will want carol
Illuminati and Adam aren't exactly main cast
We need to be careful with shades of black, white, and grey
Anyway, what colors do we give to each of those characters?
(can't make it above a mod role because lmao discord perms)
obama would have to be the top non-mod role
WE MISSED OBAMA'S BIRTHDAY
wait, how much work would it be to code it so that a command can turn every role into obama and a command can revert it just as easily
i second this
yes
Make the illuminati bright pink for ibu
it's hard to miss the bot tag
yeah
The current autoscorer color can be a third mod color and we can make Kirichan kirika colored and Shirabe Shirabe colored
This show has lots of characters
Fine (???), Ryouko (???)
Genjuurou (Auburn), Ogawa (???), Elfnein (Turqoise), Bridge Bunny (Dark Blue), Serena (???), Carol (Brown), Ver (Dark Grey), Adam (???), Germain, Cagliostro, and Prelati (???), Garie, Micha, Leiur, Phara (???)
yellow and shrek can be our reserved mod colors
if no objections are present
yeah
And staff can obtain and use Kiricoins, but they follow the same rules users do and certain rewards might be ruled out, like custom roles.
Color Me Custodian will be held off for now until we figure out if we need reserved mod colors or not. If we don't need the distinction, the colors can be freed for another Color Me role, if we do need it we'll have staff roles with an override color.
rip
im laggy but tell me when it's time to roll out the color update
*gasps for air as she surfaces from below the sea of no internet*
it's gonna be annoying, if we can automate it that'd be good
after making the initial color list, we have to deping the overrides as well
Additionally, to avoid spam: every time we edit the color list, we have to make every single color override pingable, add the new color, save the post, then make the color overrides unpingable.
color overrides are fully set up, all we need is to add them to assignable roles and then the changes can be rolled out. Once everything is ready, ping me so I can decolor mod roles because only I can edit Custodian. And don't move Maria, I mean it. We're not making things a hassle for the serenacon event just because she's in your top 3, we don't waifu war on this server and that includes within the role list. <@!102691114762371072>
<@!102691114762371072> `the bots have been called upon`
better?
and i'll go from there
Gimme some better hexes
yeah but elfnein has that space. And we're specifically giving Elfnein that color so that Latooni can have elfnein blue, because the colors should be fun and this is the one aspect where we kinda do want to play favorites
and elfnein already gets the blue
Her armor is gold
how's this for the illuminati colors
no secret color roles. gotta buy it with kiricoins
hows my germain look

WHY IS LIGHT MODE LIKE THIS

nvm got one
get me a good sample of her hair
both mint isnt it?
yellow can be the reserved color and cags keeps pink
Prelati can be autoscorer green
illuminati green matches germains hair already
I'd be fine with this
it might be confusing with the actual illuminati role
should we condense the illuminati into one role
ill finish the roles up then
i guess we can add colors as requests come in
~~i like ogawa~~
<@!102691114762371072> what was the list of characters we were adding without roles?
we've actually decided that we're just perpetually having sex, forever
I do kind of have a guest though
Uhhh once I'm done shaving maybe
shirabe is brighter and illuminati is duller
ok shirabe and illuminati fixed
Fuck it let's rip valk's illuminati pink and then use shirabe's GX CD for her pink
mmmm or illuminati
:AngryDess:
I wouldn't mind, you wouldn't mind, I dunno about R and Saki, but remember, staff aren't the only ones who host events
<@99695384296701952> I mean I'd make the argument that preventing a host from gaining kiricoins would skew events toward events that the host can participate in
The connection on this train is horrifyingly bad
If it's a narrative thing and we're worried about fairness in that the host can't get kiricoins, then we just fix that by giving them coins for contributing to the event by hosting it.
Like, for something like a tournament, the host would get kiricoins in the exact same manner as everyone else. By participating.
But if y'all are concerned about being locked out of kiricoins it's a possible solution.
No. I'm not exactly fighting to let staff get additional kiricoins just for hosting events.
Staff can't suddenly grant themselves kiricoins for no reason. Some events may prohibit the host from participating, which would limit kiricoin gain, but we can have a kiricoin reward for hosting an event (not al events need to be hosted by staff)
in fact, we're watching out for it with the color overrides too
we are
it sounds funny but it would be the exact same shit that happens on valk with their ichaival and gungnir war bullshit
if we have users constantly pooling money to keep the emoji slot locked up then we're stepping in
if two users wanna team up for an emoji then whatever
we dont wanna encourage factions though
i dunno if that's supported
users can gift coins but only if they have the coins to gift
kiricoin incentive! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
everything looks good imo
<@!102691114762371072> are you ready to implement the colors?
Ugh, woken up by a spam phone call
i just did it
<@!102691114762371072> remember to toggle pings! We don't need some asshole to come in and mass ping the color overrides
moving in on my purple real estate...
ok noticably different
dess_color 605e96
what's miku?
Color Me Carol...
*looks at her twitter mutuals*
if you want black pick default and use light theme
white is also bad
yeah black is bad
buy it <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
and im fucking jewish
same
and heres what i told her
heres shit i got dmed to me
I'm writing up warnings, which I will post publicly since I'm making more than one.
What channel am I looking at
dont fall apart wirhout my guidance
con time!
bingo said the same about jacq
:lobster:
ibu has warned us about vali i think
vali didnt do anything though, unless you think they brought it up just so that this happened

poh
i got this btw
Yeah he gave me a monologue.
A warn will only serve to formalize it.
Like I said, I've already talked to her about it.
If you think it still deserves a warning, issue it from here.
I've already talked to her privately about her behavior, and she didn't really say anything actionable until solo started trying to shut things down.

WAS THIS ALSO PART OF YOUR PLAN, JOJO?






I'll read that when I have time
I just didn't do it earlier because she was already gone, and I was hesitant just now because I'd already talked to her about it
I 100% think Hazel deserves a warn
please maintain not dying while I'm gone
anyway, back to otakon
I copied it from the DM
dess_warn <@97203460281212928>
Offending Comment: Unnecessary aggression and escalation
Channel: <#336297840529899522> 
I've already talked to you privately about this. Just be a bit less aggressive.
No additional action will be taken at this time.
You are not therapists. Don't be including me in that.
He doesn't do that shit without being drunk. R, I'm going to have to ask you to sit out on this issue. The angle you're approaching it from is a very good way to kill someone.
I've given you the band-aid, I'll be in with a solution Monday or Tuesday night.
R, just let me do what I'm good at.
And use your head. He'll probably forget being asked to stop between periods of sobriety. Start with asking each time unless it's already been logged with a warn.
Yeah that's great. I'm sure all of the people I've helped really just weren't actually suicidal to begin with. Let me have a vacation, the warnings should be private and executed via DMs or running warn from here. And do NOT target the suicidal ideation. If he's obviously drunk at ALL, then ask him to stop posting.
What exactly do you think it is I'm limited in? Let me at least get back from otakon before you start deciding what I am and an not capable of. I will talk to wfc and if he keeps popping in here with negativity before then, ask him to stop posting while drunk. If he keeps going, tell him to stop posting while drunk. If he keeps going, give him a warning. If he keeps going, give him a kick. If he keeps going, give him a ban.
<@99695384296701952> okay so the Real Timeline is
Did you not see my screenshots
Oh well. If someone wants to call us hypocrites because we allow users to decry Israel and compare a literal country to transgender people then whatever.
Oh, kaliks left too?
and also let me try something...
Parm has said she might rejoin later on. I DID edit the string of warning messages to mention that Hazel had been warned when she rejoined, but Parm read everything before the edit so she didn't catch that.
ill take a better look when i can
```
ParmesanToday at 10:54 AM
saying he cant saying anything because he's the aggressor (??????) is pretty fucked up```Might've missed some stuff? I was only half awake when dealing with it.
```ParmesanToday at 10:15 AM
i read up and followed that argument with hazel and the other guys, and was deeply discouraged from staying in that server after reading what she wrote and seeing she could just leave the server and come back, no warning no nothing
love seeing people saying that about people from israel (hi) and going on as if nothing, so no thank you```
Dunno, maybe related to solo, maybe something else.
i see an alien fucking someone bent over
Thank you.
We are not banning suicidal talk, however. If a user wants to talk about killing themselves daily, I will personally talk to them and get them to stop without actually giving them that last push. I know how to handle this. I have handled exactly this in the past. Just let me get home, and if it crops up again before then I've pinned the band-aid.
You came straight here. Good. Thank you. I've given a temporary fix and I'll get to work with the more permanent fix once I can.
<@456226577798135808> I need you to understand that I'm not shutting you down because I disagree with you. I'm telling you not to get involved before you even do because I don't want blood on any of our hands.

I've laid out instructions for Latooni and Saki to follow. 2-3 days will not be a problem. Let me have my fucking vacation.
R. This is me, speaking as a custodian, to a mod. Do not intervene.
Monday or Tuesday I will absolutely be able to help and remove the issue entirely.
I have trust in Latooni and Saki to be able to handle this elegantly. We have 4 mods, that's something we should take advantage of.
It's only illegal for me to claim I'm licensed. I am experienced and know how to handle this. I am telling you now, do not try to handle this issue. Your angle is all wrong.
I'd want someone EU/middle east/Africa
Lauren?
Start throwing out the nominations then. I'm vetoing ibu in advance, because, like... I love her but she isn't mod material.
Should we postpone the decision or should we look at other candidates? Because I think we need an EU mod, like, now.
This is literally why the custodian role exists
I'm not pulling server owner for shit like this
Parm is more than convenient. She has the conviction necessary and, while this much is just my own thoughts, I think she'd be a fine fit based on interactions with her in the past.
Every single issue on this server goes down while we're all asleep.
We literally need one
We need an international mod
I've never heard that phrase before and I don't know what you mean about it.
"slow our roll" is something I took to mean "let's not make a decision too quickly"
And do we have anyone else international for nomination?
So simply leaving is not all that weird of a reaction.
Anyway, to be fair, it's not often that asking for clarification actually gets you anywhere. Most communities just shut people down if they're a minority.
You can give opinions, but the decision is ultimately up to me and Saki right now.
Custodians handle decisions on mods. There can be a vote, but the nominations are up to me and Saki.
We've been over this R.
Custodian discussion, this is about modding someone.
I'm gonna say that if Parm comes back, I'm gonna offer her a mod position. She's international, has conviction, and I believe in her. <@!102691114762371072> what are your thoughts on this?
"yeah they can say transphobic things in the serious channel" and "yeah they can say anti-semitic things in the serious channel" are NOT highly different issues, and if the perception of what's said is anti-semitic, we need to treat it as such.
We need to take actual action because if we don't, are we really doing anything better than Valk?
Here is the bottom line:

If someone leaves because of perceived bigotry, we need to change how people perceive us.
And I've never brought up being Jewish in the past, and also being Jewish is zero percent relevant here. It's a religious conflict, sure, but the matter at hand is Israelis, not Jews.
I don't give a single shit about what our intent is. If we come across as bigoted, we need to fix that.
Solo was being unreasonable and did not accept our stance (and also he was messaging me while I was coming back from the con). Parm is not being unreasonable. If Parm doesn't come back, that's a loss and we need to treat it as something we need to fix.
let me type
According to both users who left, it was NOT clear that we don't condone anti-semiticism. We can't wave that off as "oh well"
The difference is that Parm is being 100% reasonable talking about it. I let solo go because he was not being reasonable.
I gave up on solo because he kept trying to force shit out of me.
I don't like WHY solo left. I accept he left because he has been an issue in the past so whatever, but "I'm leaving because you're anti-semitic" is NOT why people should be leaving this server. If we make a bad call, we need to be cognizant of this, not wave it off as "oh well there are more people to fill your place" because you can't fucking apply that to humans in a community setting. Each human is unique and brings something different to the table.
There's a point where we can't cater to everyone's needs, and some people will make up their mind beforehand, but this is an accepting community. That extends to more than just LGBT issues.
Also <@456226577798135808> the mentality of "if they don't like it here than they shouldn't be here" is a slippery slope. On a certain level, yes, that exactly. But once we start hitting "they don't like it here BECAUSE they feel unwelcome and discriminated against" we need to start giving a shit.
so i can't warn accounts that aren't here
i can't mention accounts that aren't here
and yeah
i cant send the command here though because bikki isn't here
kirichan shares a server with bikki
ok wont work at all like that
@Bikki#2973
dess_warn @Bikki#2973 test
For a short version I might say "You can influence but you cannot decide" but I'm sure that phrase has tons of problems I didn't think about yet.
Your input will always be considered (but also orderly discussion makes it a lot easier to consider things)
But the bigger the mod team, the more important it is to designate a group as "these people have the final say" because it just becomes a mess without that.
Always
And, yes, Custodian is right now mostly superfluous but as we grow we'll want to rely on Custodian decisions more and Staff decisions less.
Again, I need to point out that in a lot of cases, if someone feels discriminated against for being a minority on a server, they'll likely just leave because moderation usually just waves it off "nah that's not a problem" and just because we don't do that doesn't mean people aren't expecting it.
In any case, keep a eye on Parm if she comes back. Even if she seemed non-confrontational in the past, she has Strong Opinions and would likely not hesitate to make a ruling if she had the power to do so.
just not in public channels here
I'm on a train anyway
Anyway, meeting adjourned until Latooni gets off work
good point
although we can set up the group dm right now. I'll go do that.
Gotta wait for Latooni both for input and so he can `perform the ceremony`
If saki says yes and if Latooni says yes I'm inclined to agree
I don't know scrmz too well myself
We have a long and storied tradition of having the youngest moderator send the offer and god dammit we are sticking to tradition
especially you since you have to be the one inviting him to staff
yeah we have to be present
i mean
Why should we postpone it Latooni?
has to be the youngest mod each time
That, except Latooni does it
We need fucking party poppers okay
And god dammit we need to make it a group chat so we can emulate Hibiki being introduced to 2nd Div
I think it warrants more discussion
Which is why I shut you down, R. I thought you were telling me to slow down on picking a mod rather than picking a specific mod. I'm sorry if I jumped too quickly at that one.
"decision" meaning "we've talked about the person, are all custodians on board with this"
Just. To make that clear on exactly how the process goes down.
Okay, also, I'd like to interject with a few things and who gets to decide
Do we need a new mod - Custodian question
Who should we think about - Staff question
What are the pros and cons of the people we look at - Staff question
Are we going to decide to mod this person - Custodian question
He strikes me as a bit young? I have no clue how old he is.
I am not all that opposed to scrmz
Didn't we have an issue with 98 already?
Asia is a bit TOO far for timezones
Like fundamentalist Christians moderating a Symphogear discord that has historically leeched members from a community that a different Symphogear discord represents.
Some people will stay fast in their ways even when you talk to them about it, and that's who you give up on.
You need to be able to have a conversation. If you don't have time, don't engage.
Too often people will rush to call someone a racist for saying racist things. That's not the appropriate reaction, because it just makes the person saying racist things defensive.
More often than not, understanding context ALSO means just not doing it in the first place.

If you understand the context, you should also understand whether it will cause harm merely by wearing it.
No, the one with the boxes?
Discrimination 100% goes both ways, but discriminating systemically does not. There's no system to discriminate against white people. If you're going to don a cultural icon, you should understand the context first.
A racist is someone who, when faced with the things they say, simply doubles down.
I think a quote I quite like is pertinent here.

Just because you do racist things or have racist thoughts doesn't mean you're racist.
Latooni is saying a completely different word, it's just spelled the same, pronounced the same, and refers to a similar concept.
The main issue here is that racism doesn't have only one definition right now.
If either I or Saki get to a point where we need to stop, bring it up with the other. Custodians manage other Custodians as well, that's why we need 2 active Custodians at all times.
Same to R
<@99695384296701952> If this channel ever starts going too close to "only Custodians matter" I expect you to bring it up.
I can't edit shit. I'll make an announcement and then update rules once it lets me.
discord being a fcuk
it ends with "with that, feel free to bring it up with one of us privately."
ok i edited that end
yes
how is this as a rewrite of the rules
1. Don't be a dick. No slurs, bigoted language, attacks on others, or harassment of users will be tolerated. This includes making "edgy" jokes about things like the holocaust or suicide. If you would hesitate to tell someone you've just met a particular joke, consider not telling that same joke here either.
1a. No excessive ripping on someone or their works without constructive criticism.
2. Keep NSFW content to the appropriate channels. This INCLUDES NSFW discussions. If you wanna start talking about dicks move it to <#336297808221044736>.
3. If you have an issue with anyone or anything, politely bring it up with the person in question or with <@&336302034070536192>. Issues with <@&336302034070536192> should be taken up privately with a <@&336301457185832961>. Remember to follow rule 1 as well - if you're having an issue with another user and you need to bring it up with <@&336302034070536192>, consider not engaging with them until a <@&336302034070536192> member has had a chance to sort everything out.
4. Spoilers should be kept to the spoiler channels. Information is considered to be a spoiler if it concerns a major plot point in any of the 4 completed seasons of Symphogear.
5. The rules are open to interpretation by the moderators. If you have a problem with a particular interpretation, tell a <@&336301457185832961>.
==================
Breaking the rules: Sometimes, someone will break the rules. It might even be you! Depending on the severity and frequency of rule breaking, this may be handled with a friendly reminder to the offending party to tone it down or it might result in a ban. In general, **rule breaking will be handled with a warn > kick > ban escalation**, however certain cases might earn you multiple warnings or reminders before a kick, and in some extreme cases you may just get to skip the line and go straight to banning. We strive to be consistent in how we handle the breaking of rules, so if you have an issue
yes because I actively talked to him and sorted things out
But first I'd like to clarify rule 1
I am going to make an announcement about rule 3. Because it really is a rule, not a suggestion.
Also, I've been talking to solo now that we've had time to air our heads. He'll probably come back and he's agreed to report issues to staff rather than butting heads with Hazel publicly over stuff.
Yeah, same.
```
Yuri GirlToday at 8:04 PM
Alright, well the nsfw bit is definitely something I'm guilty of, I just never went and told people to calm it down since no one really ever seemed to be uncomfortable around it to me, and no one messaged any staff about it so I kinda just relaxed that rule in the end. When I marked serious-discussion as nsfw and renamed nsfw-art to nsfw my intention there was to corral nsfw talk to the appropriate channels but that never actually really happened. I can go stricter on that though, if you have a complaint with it I'm willing to bet at least one other person does.```
Which, lemme just copy-paste my response.
I already asked, it's about how non-nsfw channels just get kinda... nsfw. And also some personal stuff they didn't tell me.
<@456226577798135808>
Can you ask them if the Israel thing was part of it?
Fucks sake
I'm on it 100% just not tomorrow
I uh

I have proposed that exact idea to you in the past
I've got another day to go before I'm fully free and I'd really like just one day where I'm not being constantly called on for stuff. I can post prompts but not this week.
scanning ruins the book unless you're super careful
<@!102691114762371072> I'll need you to appoint him to Illuminati since I will probably be asleep
but I have no issue with going with scrmz
ideally awake and free
We've got like 5 people in that time zone
She's also australian, which is a bit TOO far
Anyway, I guess devoid of any other options, scrmz is who we're going with?
besides, we need our eu mod to be able to actually do something
Alchemist isn't really necessary right now
R was "okay", Saki was "yes", I was "yes if Latooni says yes"
uhhhhhhhhhhhh
did we ever actually agree on scrmz?
But for now he probably won't get shitfaced and start fouling up the server
Also I talked to wfc. He did not enjoy my words but I will words at him more on a later date to try and make him feel better.
I am home. But Lyssa is too.
but question time. i have many questions right now. I'll post them in spoilers
if someone else can cover a few days for me it'd work out
which means i have to do everything for my birthday before or on it
which is one day after my birthday
lining it up though... to be on episode 5 on halloween, we'd have to start on the 26th
ok yeah ausa is the weekend before my birthday not after
wait shit am i even going to be here for halloween
soonish? I need to gauge interest first and also hug lyssa more and also like maybe other things i dunno
uhhhhhh well I've got all of the episodes now and I just need to upload them to google drive
Okay, but maybe we should urge people to tend more towards addressing the issues themselves rather than decry Israel as a nation. Because, while it might be "justified" it sure doesn't look good and there are other ways to express it
So the issue that solo brought up (which I agree with) is that "I'm anti-israel" isn't a problem if you can take it at face value, but too many anti-semites hide behind it as a way to justify their hatred

by the way, here was the conversation between me and solo. I have NO FUCKING IDEA how to differentiate between "anti-israel" and "anti-semitic"
I'll take that as a yes
should i just go and delete it?
bingo gave me the logs btw. A week late but whatever
really makes you 🤔
"We don't have any trans members" *trans members start flocking to me*
R, I'm just quoting them being fucking wrong.
I'm not
I brought it up in that space. I get what you're saying but what you're saying is not that.
I don't even WANT them to talk about it. They'd do more harm than good.
What bingo said there was a reply to me
I'm not shilling our discord or bashing valk in the process, when someone needs help I'll give them help.
I'm not even doing anything. If a user comes to me I will help them.
I'm just bringing that up as a "well if they don't feel the need to talk about it" when a user is literally talking about it. To me. Because the rest of that server is unwelcoming.
Hm? That's old.
I don't even care about valk at this point, just fuck bingo
So *yet another* user on Valkyrie turns out to be trans and is now seeking out my advice on the subject.

Bitterness and pettiness are my thing so I'm just gonna, hang on...
https://old.reddit.com/r/Symphogear/comments/972ioc/writing_topics_five_game_show_travel_or_black/
<@456226577798135808> please give us last week's prompts once you can
what should the post look like?

I refrained from posting the right out porn, but I did post nudity
Confirming or denying would be unprofessional of me <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
already done
One of the staff members has to be Latooni. *We have to keep the tradition going.*
It's okay. Let's get scrmz on board so you can rest. Or at least relax.
you'll need a founders pack
oh! <@99695384296701952> if you wanted to reserve a name for MS2, tomorrow is the day
september?
so no kiricoins until like
<@!102691114762371072> have you had any opportunity to get more of mariabot sorted out?
dess_ban <@314424761663094785>  You wanted hate.


ibu doesn't know snowaru. I sent her a friend request to get her point of view, she hasn't responded, but I do have a server I can talk to the mods from now
more coming i guess
doesn't matter, I don't need objective truth to determine whether he's an asshole troll or not
ibu didn't want to, I asked vali myself.
I can speak, but I'm also talking to ibu
ibu might
no
and scrmz
we have 3 people
(btw that name is Aiice, the first i is capitalized)
scrmz
so
ok
they're supposed to be blue
green is okay i guess
i made my eyes the wrong color tho
and i made Aegis on west
ok im safe
and also my name got sniped
it fucking froze
`4 minutes`
~~so i can give it to you~~
im stealing aegis on west
8 minutes
you can
`15 minutes`
doing a thing
im uh
`quick reserve your maplestory name`

THE NAMING IS UPON US
INTENSE VIBRATIONS
i doubt he'll be missed
`is it you`
is it
aside from the vali thing nothing exploded today
huh
you make the character in the same client. If you wanna do it, you should update it.
you log in, make the character, and wait for release
only 1 name reservation per server
people like to yell and scream at night (especially the europeans) so we need people who can tell them to stop
generally, we announce and then role
i think i wrote latooni's
Latooni do you want to write the announcement this time?
and then apparently there's gonna be a game attached at some point? we did not work the details out fully
but anyway we're adding a gacha to the discord because fuck playing xdu for the gacha
dess_give 5 <@290431224596660224>
you may not speak of this bot outside this channel
the momria bot
anyway, valk isn't that important if you ask me. What IS important is...
we don't exactly plan to be more involved with them
honestly it's best to just bury memories of them
valk mostly does not like me (for things I did over a year ago) and R (for things he did under a year ago)
ah, so you're familiar with our complaints about them
sgg is actually tame other than the fact that they say tranny regularly
sgg is 4chan
valk isn't 4chan
lives there
it's literally her house we've figured out how to upload her to the cloud and she just
like why i talk about maplestory in here so much
ok anyway do you have any questions
DONT ILLUMINATI YET
latooniiiiiiii
<@99695384296701952>
btw scrmz we've put something in the office coolers so if you were cishet before you'll wanna get prepared to leave all of your family and friends behind
latooni mothers his chicks well
I voted for Lyssa to be the tiebreaker...
that one is based on clothing/armor
i took her hair color and then made it duller since it was otherwise too similar to elfnein
<@&336301943179968514> - People who can kick, ban, make announcements, manage messages, and manage roles. If they tell you to do something, either listen or take it up with a Custodian.
uhhhh everything is outlined in rules
ive been wanting an eu mod since we brought you on saki
lets get a game of that running some time this month
board game online?
so like
also, events - I'd like events for birthdays to be things we know the community likes. We can host potential events randomly before birthdays and see what sticks
ok ill look
ok
`for 7 quid we can show you the mysteries of the universe unravelled`
we'll lose NG+
which we kinda need
i get normal headcrabs
<@456226577798135808> if we keep jazzing can we do it using me as a host because i dont spawn in the kizunas
`do you have gmod`
there is ONE more thing...
anyway
http://symphowiki.net
that's the one we're upending
no
we may end up pulling out on that one though because do we really need it? I asked for it back when I still cared about maintaining a relationship between here and valk.
that's simultaneously a wiki server and an admin chat
https://discord.gg/4wzDCQ
i can do it myself
that way no one calls us out on it when something falls through!
geno and I did most of the work
ripped from our server
actually
im trying to do Not That

i have reopened the gates

<@456226577798135808> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcg6wekmCRA
once you're done just right click me and hit join game
addified
i need to
no
i need to be tripping 24/7
it is the cellist
if there is one video game character who I would like to trade places with
except as a male cat
embodied
But the cellist is just me
I like the singer for their nonbinary representation
`yes`
the cellist is my favorite
any sock that kriisa wears is automatically a saki socky
ok but get this
<@!102691114762371072> do you have your own brand of socks yet
and hibiki
yeah we spawned in a tv
this is the power of gmod
we're listening to Dangerous Sunshine with Hibiki <@!102691114762371072>
ACTIVATE THE CHAOS PRISMS
fair
nor are they heavily featured
i mean the zombies arent exactly the point of the mod

what if you put the cookie dough on the pizza
COOKIE DOUGH
COOKIE DOUGH
COOKIE DOUGH

you're on the same exact server im on
you can also join saki or R
you may need to add me
right click my name in steam and hit join game
im about to go shower but afterwards yes
later
but
gonna need to shower too so i can eat a dick tomorrow
<@456226577798135808> I'm gonna do a hearthstone thing @ me here or DM me when you're done and I'll finish up my match
but anyway yeah moral of the story is that getting pissed off at your therapist over the phone, hanging up, shooting her an angry text, then calling her back actually works sometimes at least
i have to make sure i can work before i work or else my disability may disappear
i have to be careful because any taxable income has to be acquired strategically
bye
i might have something similar to a job soonish i hope
sorry that took so long
i happy now
we discuss it properly
explain exactly how i would like to discuss things
i call her again
i hang up
i get pissed off at fumbling
fumbles the conversation entirely
therapist calls me
fucking
FOR REAL
I AM BACK
<@290431224596660224> <@456226577798135808> OKAY
<@456226577798135808> don't move and look up when you get back
don't you have gmod?
its been revved
its revved
<@456226577798135808> `do we jazz tonight`
but yeah basically i need to try shrooms at some point

i don't know where that rabbit hole will take me but i expect it to be fun or terrifying
i said less self-destruction
also yes. If I had my way I would literally be the cellist but with less self-destruction. The biggest obstacles are that being the cellist would be both incredibly expensive and incredibly illegal.
The ratio needs to be WAY fruitier because my tongue is like a watch dog and I WILL sense the alcohol.
I need less than a shitton.
No, normally you put a shitton of alcohol in the fruity drinks.
No you don't understand the level I operate on here. I need a normal amount of alcohol in a fruity drink amount of fruitiness.
I refuse to smoke and I refuse to do anything that makes me taste alcohol. I'm gonna try sneaking it past my taste buds with large quantities of sugar.
Now my stance is "if i don't have to smoke it and if it doesn't taste terrible i am all for getting all sorts of fucked up"
I used to be like 100% straightedge.
tbh I was like, exactly the same on drugs until I started electrolysis and then I was kinda just like "this is like being awake, but with less awakeness"
Same. Except for the drugs.
Join the club I suggest drugs
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
although arisu is cute on its own and also naming a character arisu is supposed to give her a kind of air of foreignness which a nickname takes away so probably not any with my name
uhhhhh a lot
acchan is a totally acceptable way to address me
~~chan is cuter~~
<@456226577798135808> jazz?
I AM HOME
<@456226577798135808> im booting you from the server if you don't come back within 5 minutes so i can get ready to leave
<@290431224596660224> I have to go soon so we won't be able to play today
back up
i was getting food one minute
oh
<@290431224596660224> alright im back to paying attention to JAZZCATS and also please feel free to relocate a discussion if it turns into an argument <@99695384296701952> <@!102691114762371072>
have i been missing something important
<@456226577798135808> <@290431224596660224>  okay back up
im dilaing so
oh no, i love it
also we're kinda railroading you through the game so that you can experience the NG+ stuff properly. are you actually having fun?
<@290431224596660224> do you wanna finish up the stuff in gmod once I'm done dilating?
it's okay, the hivemind is a very accepting place
noted!
It is scary, at first.
Also consider: genderfluid
How long should I wait before just posting like 20 images of people cracking eggs here
Joking aside, what word should I use to describe you now? Boy, girl, enby, entity??????
Hibiki: Chris... I think... I think I might have a crush on Miku...
Chris: Well congrats! You're officially the last one to know!
========================================
Latooni: Everyone... I think... I think I might not be cis...

You forget my secret power
But R
I say "agender girl" when people ask but really it's more just "Alice"
Honestly I've been supporting you in this for like weeks now. Take your time, and remember that you don't really even need a label at all. Do whatever feels comfortable to you.
it's over, we did it
just rejoin the server
just
it worked
ok
maybe it'll still be there
stay calm
hang on

Problem: addressed
Hmm... I think I know how to address that. One sec.
a lot of the creative types here also seem to have slowly fallen off. I dunno if Lily is still busy, but DL hasn't posted in a bit, Parm and Lucy left, we're losing a lot of the recognizable names and, in turn, inspiration for people to do their stuff.
If we do monthly, I'd wanna make submissions and feedback open for the entire month
The two things aren't mutually exclusive
We can add more restrictions, but we also can change the schedule up
Feedback never occupies more than a day, so there's no real need to fill a week with feedback.
ok, what if, instead of making the writing prompts weekly events with page restrictions (which is proving to be a bit much for people) we give everyone a month, total, and as people send the prompts in, we just post them for feedback immediately with no indication of who sent it in.
ok back up, also that's at least 50% gay
it broke again didnt it
yeah you dropped
dess_remind <@290431224596660224> 1m fuck if rogot the time
dess_remind <@290431224596660224> toost

dess_remind me 1s ???
hum
dess_remind <@290431224596660224> 1s it's remind
dess_remind maybe
I'd much rather get the watch done before AUSA
episode 5 on halloween will be difficult
ahhhh fuck I should've asked R about graphic design stuff before school started
Because I'm fucking, like, lets workshop this shit.
Is that the only prompt idea you had Latooni?
Is this German
Altenrate
we ask at that point
Well yeah, if the next one also doesn't go over too well
Loneliness is too slife of lifey
Also those prompts are examples, not suggestions.
And we COULD ask. I think it might be bad to change too many things at once.
For the prompts I'd say stuff like "An alarm goes off in the submarine. What's happening?" vs "loneliness" vs "color".

One is super specific, one is a theme to write the fic around, and one is just an abstract concept that somehow needs to be incorporated.
We can also try making them monthly prompts, feedback as soon as its submitted, but we should probably try out one thing at a time at most.
Okay. Okay so idea. People want more specific prompts to work off of. We also tried out MULTIPLE CHOICE PROMPTS this past period. What if we combine the two? Next time we'll give three prompts, one which is a specific situation to build the fic around, one which is a one word "tie your fic to this concept somehow" prompt, and one which is kind of a middle ground, more than just a concept but not a specific scenario.

i have a yellow filter applied
i cant actually differentiate between those two colors on my monitor this late
that looks like a normal switch to me
...has anyone here ever worked a cash register
not until saki has a computer
well we can't do much aside from talk economy and theorize how our version of the game might work
powers of 2 only work for nerds
people should be able to roll a lot, I think. We're not getting money out of it so we have to maximize fun instead.
yeah lets go with 100
submitting a fic might be worth a roll
well, actually... do we?
and i do want to do that
Like prompts should give you a considerable amount of coins, but I don't want them to flat out give you a spin if we can host events more regularly
if we're sticking to powers of 10
I'd say 1000, because I wanna have a lot of flexibility with events.
I think around holidays or birthdays we can give a kiricoin bonus for being on theme
Since our XDU homebrew is probably gonna be the main attraction for kiricoins, how much should a single spin cost? We gotta balance around that.
oh ok
I'd also wanna reward people for giving feedback, because feedback is just as important
We'll set the amount once and we'll only change it if we're like "well that should be different I guess"
Adjusting the numbers in response to low submissions is an absolute no. They're an incentive, not a bribe.
Also, future prompts will have a kiricoin incentive if we have to. I'd like the writing itself to be the incentive, but if we wanna pad out numbers I'm gonna say kiricoins will be the easiest option.
yeah
so ill do it when i can
reddit is broken right now

you mentioned it, this is your grave
latooni, you're responsible for this now, I'm going to take weed and then write the next portion of the story tomorrow and you need to read it over so that the weed does not interfere with the story quality
ok shit
fuck maybe i do
i
FUCK AKIRA
words cannot express the level of hatred i experience whenever akira is brought up and i am constantly bringing him up for like an hour at a time each time i write more of this fic which means I AM AN INCOMPREHNSIBLE BALL OF HATE
like god damn he's shit what the fuck

once i get past the next bit I'm switching to Hibiki's perspective and god damn fuck I cannot wait
GOD DAMN
FUCK
okay i don't wanna bog down people in <#336310266654490624> or <#357682999300718592> with my raw hatred towards Akira and I don't think it's worthy of being in <#336297840529899522> so I'm just gonna FUCK AKIRA
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I could TRY writing in the next part of the story since I'll be stealing like half of it from the show directly but I dunno
I did not get as much writing done today as I hoped I would but it's legitimately difficult to write in the repeated misgendering here and I really, really want to just be like "and then Akira died to fucking noise"
okaeri

Having Akira refer to Hibiki as his son *while he has literally seen her naked on television* has to be like... the ultimate shit dad move.
and it sounds better than transaction
people will still understand it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
thanks
that
"totalling up"? is that a phrase?
yeah but this is fic world and im telling a story not training an employee
transaction sounds... academic
```He had just finished a transaction with a customer``` what's a better word/phrase than transaction
terminology
fucking
The shittier I make him the harder I get to slap him with the fuck you stick
yes that too
<@!102691114762371072> I know you don't like suffering fics but what is your threshold for "Akira being an absolute cunt and Hibiki getting pissed over it"
Alright. My white suburban ass just realized that I have no idea how working retail actually works.
Like what do you do when it's busy
do you sort out the money in the till after someone buys something or does it accumulate until the end of the day and get sorted out there?
SHEEP
The conservatives all whine about the LGBT media corrupting the youth, they fail to see what Totally Spies has already done
And it did all of it in a kid-friendly manner.
There is not a single fucking fetish that show did not cover
Totally Spies is the fetish show
everyone did
Miguzi also aired Totally Spies and if you blaspheme Totally Spies we're gonna have an issue
I honestly have not seen enough Teen Titans GO to judge the two but GO seems amusing at least
Miguzi also ran the original Teen Titans cartoon
I will admit that shit went downhill when they introduced Krypto the Superdog
wait you even told me that you liked Code Lyoko during jazzcats
The toonami knockoff was called Miguzi and it had some really good shows okay
yes
SD Gundam
a cute gundam
wasnt there like
one day we're gonna be 50 years old and there's gonna be a symphogear reboot and it's gonna be awesome

TWICE
FAIRLY ODDPARENTS ENDED FOR LESS
that's where you put the fucking ending
is what i call the end of a series
that
there was a fucking problem and the fix was taking away the sonic screwdriver
It's like when Dr Who started sonic screwdrivering everything
it is a show that was set upon the fact that he is ben, and he has 10 forms
the show is ben 10
yes
it distinctly violated the premise of the series
he had an 11th form
the fucking hook
No, I mean the second season of Ben 10
I don't know how well Code Lyoko would stand to the tests of time. The writing was probably not as good as younger me remembers it.
going
fucking
kept
and just
But then they fucking introduced Ben 11
The original ben 10 I will admit was not garbage. I was at the age where I was starting to grow out of shows like that but it was okay.
he's ben 500 or some shit
he's not even fucking ben 10 anymore
IT WAS TERRIBLE
WHY
I THINK IT'S STILL GOING
20 BEN 10 SEASONS
FUCKING
AND BEN 10
winx club seasons do we have
how many fucking
I actually rewatched it a while ago. It is, in fact, good, it's not just nostalgia glasses.
"Just... tiny little legs"
The best episode was the one with the TV dude recruiting the megas team for illegal space fighting
I will prioritize the flip flappers watch it's okay
it only got one season, it's not much to work through
fuck it we're doing a group watch of megas xlr
Static Shock was great. So was Megas XLR
oh Static Shock was on Miguzi too
i watched doug too
in a live action show
it was a puppet
no
he wen to space
this was a show, right?
someone remembers cousin skeeter
please tell me
ok
ok
but how do they thicken it
and corn starch im assuming?
oh
it's like 90% sugar isn't it
did you eat the slime
He just disappeared into rap one day
It's like fucking Nick Cannon
but there was no confirmation
it was like "there is no way that's not fucking Kel"
it was surreal
ONCE
I saw him on TV
a rapper or something
Kel is like
KEL FUCKING
HOLY SHIT
did you make orange soda jokes
SHIT REALLY?
yes this is why i hated chalk zone
christ
jesus
even if all that was ultimately good
but more, because it was just... actual artists I didn't like
I also hated All That's musical bits
I'm tired of putting the fucking lime in the coconut
I hated the musical bits. That's what shoved it over into "not like" territory for me
rudy can go fuck off
ok look snap was okay
i could not stand chalk zone
every god damn time
and i watched fucking chalk zone
So I fucking bit the bullet
bad? But nothing better was on at the same time
It was like
I did not like Chalk Zone
fuck Chalk Zone
they double dip

You can create a nexon account now. You can create a character tomorrow. You can play either Sept 24 or Oct 10 depending on if you fork over $25 or not (I did)
I don't wanna immediately jump to administrative action when saying "yo cool it" does the job
Pretty much my thoughts
Like, it is breaking the rules exactly as they're laid out, but on the other hand *I am not the hardass mod*
Should we give out warns for stuff like in <#336310266654490624>? It's dealt with for now, but for next time.
*Go download the game and reserve your names* <@!102691114762371072> <@99695384296701952>
Correction: Founders get access Sept 24, also non-founders can reserve names tomorrow.
Until they added it to the rotation, and killed the group of people that played that mode and that mode only
Which was actually good
I'm counting GW2's hunger games minigame
Mushking Royale is the worst battle royale I've ever played
Maplestory 2 launches October 10th, founders get early access starting October 1st. There'll be a standalone download for Mushking Battle Royale starting tomorrow, August 22nd for a Pre-season of the game mode. Level cap will be 60.
is... is it true saki? Do you hate ox blood and cow intestines?
Cytube I'd guess
most people arent
I love when 4chan shitlurkers are like "hurrr dynamic ips" okay yeah but then you're fucking dedicated to being a shithead
12:00 PM EDT

uhhhhhhhh I think noon tomorrow?
Lyssa come live in my Maplestory house with me <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
But it's likely that you can sell houses for merets, so if you're feeling creative and that's what it takes for you to play this game I will straight up fund your creation of a house (as long as I get a copy)
They haven't tried it out in other versions so everything is up in the air
economy is yet to be determined
player sold, so however much they ask probably
<@456226577798135808> <@!102691114762371072> <@290431224596660224> <@99695384296701952> YOU CAN BUY HOUSES GET BACK IN HERE R
wait fuck stefan karl was the lazytown dude wasn't he
Also I was qualified to have the note taker thing but I didn't need it so I would just say I needed it each semester then tell whoever was doing it that if they shared the money with me then I'd let them do nothing
I've never cheated although I have opted for shortcuts at times.
The act of specifying without the professor reads kinda suspect to me.
the new invite works fine
i literally deleted it
the user is consistently showing an old invite
the issue isnt the invite
introductions is synced with server, which has nothing
introductions
yes
I recommend the launcher
through the Nexon Launcher or Steam
then download the game
just make a nexon account
but no reckful
there was a reynad puzzle and a toast puzzle and i think the patron puzzle was from a tournament

ALL HANDS ON DICK
All hands on dick, they're like animals in heat https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaa76KVM-HA
gonna go take my meds, dilate, then write
you are the weeditor
yes
i should go do that
oh, right, I was gonna get high before writing this next part of the fic
but floooooop
I also apparently had this idea at the perfect time because carolnein is also doing a fic about Chris dealing with survivor's guilt. Although I imagine her fic will be a lot more focused on the survivors guilt while my fic is probably gonna be focused on the surviving.
and I'm just like "fuck YES this is prime fic material"
then the thought goes through my head of "walk a mile in someone else's shoes" along with "survivor"
looked up the name on the poster, read about how they have a collection of survivor's shoes from the day they almost died
i got the idea because I saw an ad for a 9/11 memorial on the train
and the bulk of the fic is just Chris escaping her own situation
no my idea was that someone (probably shirabe or tsubasa) is chastising someone else for running away from a bad situation, Chris steps in and tells them to fuck off because they were escaping rather than running away
oh wait is that applicable to one of the prompts
hahaha writing ideas popping into my head looks like I'm gonna get biki dad done this week so I can start on CHRIS VS SURVIVOR'S GUILT
It Is Up
fuck yeah i am
and then i'll go write up my internal traumas afterwards
<@290431224596660224> tell me when you want me to throw up the server. I'm waiting on food right now but once its here I'm free to play
i could do that
this cant go poorly at all
hahaha time to write exchanges that have actually happened between me and my dad
I was shifting into actually writing instead of ripping from the show
oh right, this is why i ended up bailing on writing last night
If it makes the reader pissed off then I am doing well
<@99695384296701952> have you read the weedfic yet
dont worry i get to experience my own mind
my legs are trying to crawl out of my body but i think that's just normal RLS
like straight up
lifted from the show
most of what i weedwrote is actually just
while im not high
probably better
its
yeah okay
the end of the "diner thingy"
weed writing starts at like
<@99695384296701952> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ywcb8VkXs4KpNW1T-vJvnIGYSn06EnxLbDPqxr-e1Us/edit here is your torture

i could rewrite it entirely
i dont know
do i want to deviate from the canon scene
far
how fucking
Nonon: I'm gonna go get high
Gamagoori: NO STOP
Blind dude: l m a o
Geek dude: [plays minecraft]
geek dude has no fucking clue what's going on
what's his face with no eyes just sits back and laughs
gamagoori always tells her to stop but she never listens
nonon is the weed smoker
out of the 4 of them
nonon definitely smokes weed
what if nonon smoked weed
guiegheruigherg i need to write an interaction betwee akira and hibiki but i cannot draw upon the power of my own shitty ass experiences because im too high
the words are not flowing

ok im gonna
i ended up playing hearthstone but i think im still high
i like that the super soldier was a discounter 3 mana minion rather than a 2 mana minion
i'd play with a 4 or 5 stack
i quit because fuck toxic asshats
hello yes i am retired semi-pro or some other combination of words that makes it sound like i'm way better than i am
feel like I should probably go back over the second half of what I wrote today since a lot of it may have suffered from me writing the first half
She's already halfway on board before I've even started writing it
If you wanna check it out, I've got everything I did today on the docs link.
Tomorrow I shall write the upbeat "I'll make my own family!" part
I think I am actually done writing for the day now
instead of anger im just sad about it
ok this just hurts to write in a different way
...or watch i guess I need to watch episodes 8 and 9 again
fuck sleep time to write
INSPIRATION
i think im gonna take a nap and hope i can write more once i wake up
good
this is the consequence of me writing motherfucking akira
the pain was born into me
So that'll be easier to work on
The bit I'm writing next will be mostly Hibiki accepting the fact that her dad is a piece of irredeemable shit
maybe doing "survivor guilt chris" after this
yeah im
god DAMN  I wrote a little less than half a page and I am exhausted
i know exactly what I want to write and it is incredibly difficult to actually put the words down
now im giving myself an aneurysm
its okay we finished

Please be more aware of what you say.
No further action will be taken right now.
I'm willing to consider his last message as an apology
"I said the racist thing in a way that makes people see me as racist!"
... "should have properly worded"
He already earned a kick.
I was leaning toward kick then ban then kick then ban. Right now I'm thinking temp ban?
Probably ban unless we performs a shakespear-esque work of art to worm his way out of this.
Fuck we do
Alright so here we have a person who 1) Made either an incredibly transphobic or an incredibly sexist remark that warranted an immediate kick in the past and 2) is saying something that's probably incredibly racist.
I was planning on it.
describing dialogue is the worst
save me from this hell
I wanna write but I feel like maximum restlessness
they beat me out but only because the deck runs 0 board clears and they played two sonyas through valeera
as an aside, outvaluing quest rogue is immensely satisfying
it was my hearthstone overlay
TF2's balance patches came just a few years too late
Overwatch did a lot of things better than TF2, gameplay was not one of them
it just died
for clarity, I still think TF2 was better
HotS is a result of blizzard going "FUCK YOU VALVE"
HotS
most blizzard games are a result of blizzard going "okay but what if we made this except better" (which is how Team Fortress 3, more commonly known as Overwatch came to be)
also he's still skeleton king, boner lord reigns supreme
that they may have attempted to register dota
probably during the time they forced valve to gut skeleton king and pudge
at some point
you would think
It literally isn't an acronym. Blizzard has the rights to the name "defense of the ancients" but not "dota"
The difficult part is being able to, you know, talk. A lot of people fail at that one. And also knowing when to straight up lie or say something outlandish enough that it just magically works.
1) I have Kyrie to help debrief me
2) I can teach people how to handle it. It's a lot like doing minor improv on a script to be quite honest.
Gives us a way to maintain morale while also not shuttering people for being suicidal.
```* If you're having issues in life, this is a community that has your back. If your issues are beyond the average user's depth, staff may direct you to someone more able to accomodate you. Please accept in this situation.```
hmm... I think I can actually work something out for that point
headpat
luckily, I am here
*grabs a marker and crosses out he bit about life issues* perfect
I feel like adding a guidelines section might be useful. Short and concise rules at the top with a more in depth "this is exactly what we mean" further down
the other rules are "here are some examples on how you can refrain from being a dick" and "listen to the people who say you're being a dick"
and it's just "don't be a dick"
we only actually have one rule.
unfortunately, we run into our achilles heel.
<@285555416056856576> do you have any great wisdom on the topic of calling John McCain an asshole?
On a more? uplifting note, how should we handle stuff like me telling hazel not to celebrate about dead politicians earlier? I mean, I get her point, but at the same point if we only allow it from one side, we get accused of being biased, if we allow it from both sides then we get microagressions, and if we don't allow it at all we get hazel making noise.
In a server with sub-100 active users.
He has no one inside the server and he barely interacted while he was here. He'd have to somehow sneak in with an alt and start a cult.
ibu doesn't like him (I have no idea why she introduced him here) and honestly I expect more trouble from yorin and hazel than I expect from someone who got themselves banned in such an idiotic manner
Shoulda said "banned from my friends list too"
No one even expected a GMS2. It flopped in both Korea and China and GMS1 makes no money.
I expect cosmetics to be time limited but it looks like they're just straight up handing us a free pass to level 50 and saying no pay to win items.
I think they're legitimately doing it. This is the last shot they have at making Maplestory 2 a worthwhile investment.
IT'S LIKE IT'S NOT EVEN A NEXON GAME
NOTHING FUNCTIONAL COSTS MONEY

In context that is a wonderfully hilarious quote though
life isnt fun
i am tempted to drink all of my remaining thc oil in one go
everything is bright
i think my eyes are dilating
ok wow that is certainly the weed working
I wouldn't say it makes you not feel like trash but it sure is a nice distraction
just so someone has the information somewhere in case it ever becomes a problem, today i feel like trash and decided to take slightly more weed than normal

also my throat hurts
Jacq says no
Jacq brought it up with a mombot tweet and Jacq seems easily manipulated so I might as well ask them directly if they have any contact with Vali
tempted to instaban regardless, keeping tabs on reddit is effort
on the discord
someone we banned for trolling
look at WHO the activity is from
https://www.reddit.com/r/Symphogear/comments/9aewnf/what_do_you_want_from_season_5/e4uyo1u/
I dunno what plan B is exactly yet but it's totally there.
It'd have to be a "hey is there anyone who can help available right now?" type thing and if the answer is "everyone's either asleep, busy, or not in a good position to do it" then plan B has to be used.
Never gonna ask someone to be on call for it. I'm not paying you, and you'll need to debrief as well (I am not good at debriefing someone yet so generally I wouldn't ask anyway until I have secured either another person who can do debriefing or if I can get Kyrie to give me some pointers)
I mean, I guess it makes it kind of difficult if you're looking to help a specific person at a specific time, but you can learn your way around that too.
And also, even if you're not the best candidate for talking to people, that doesn't mean you can't help someone.
If a friend did it, it'd hurt more, since you have substantially more attachment to a friend.
Fuck's it mean to you? That was just some random asshole you don't know.
Think of it like, some random asshole running into your game on gmod and calling you a faggot and then leaving.
The lashback that someone experiences is only ever proportionate to the amount of attachment they had in the first place.
An important thing to remember is that you are not the sole actor, in just about any situation. Most often, when someone who doesn't know what they're doing reaches out to help, all they're doing is burning a bridge. It's not until you actually take someone on and decide to pour yourself into it that you run that risk.
You are good at other things though. Like moderating, and being a friend.
(I don't have a bottom text I just wanted to say this)
Ima keep it real with you ~~57th prime minister of Japan Shinzo Abe~~ R
Actually. I would trust Symphogi to talk to people. I think he has potential.
There is an entire alternate timeline where I fucked up myself and god that is not a happy timeline.
I described it simply but it's uh. It's a simple task where if you fuck up once a bomb explodes.
I do not trust you to do anything that involves carefully and gently dismantling years of internalized self-abuse.
To be honest, I wouldn't trust most of this server with that job anyway. Aside from me, I'd trust... Latooni and Saki, but neither of them appear to want to do it and you don't get anywhere with someone who doesn't wanna do it.

I'd trust Lyssa since she's stopped at least one suicide so far but honestly that one was a fluke and she's always busy with work anyway so she's a bad fit.
I can pop up later on to work on patching things up
The server can tank a few hits to morale
Alternatively, don't intervene at all (but still ping me for when I'm around later)
"Look, I realize this is tough for you right now, but no one here has the training or ability to properly help. Could you please seek out professional help?" and then just ping me with a time stamp or channel + keyword
Staff's job there is intervening, not counseling (unless they want to)
It says someone more able to help, not staff specifically. I can specify myself if it has to be that way, I just want an out for people who end up getting suicidal and killing morale.
I don't expect more than I could handle on my own anyway.
dunno
bad
no
I fell asleep. I think I'm a little better.
Harder drugs
why do you think i made sure to tell people before i did it
it sure fucking could be
the weed made it go away
before
no
not good
n
unfu
you have no idea how little that means
im tired
i dunno
im out of sleeping pills though
not much just thinking about killing myself
hahaha i feel like garbage
i should benot be high in mod chnnel
about riajuu
on valk
theyre arguing
im doing the time jumpy thing where i just forget everything in the past like minute
oh theres the thing
oh
yyeah that
The mentions work ~sometimes~
It might be worth having both mentions and last known names

why was bearshark released in KFT instead of BDP
Lyssa is here so probably not
i guess
okay
im
ok what have i missed just now
i am waiting for food
no
i have not dilated today and i dont know when i will feel well enough to do so
yes
i am not very stable at the moment
i am very not okay right now and might need someone who can take ownership of the discord potentially permanently
Elfnein is a communist
it can stay
borderline, but nothing is actually showing and it's official art
if i didnt feel like absolute shit i might throw together something trans related just to see the response
thats louis



phantom dick
150 minuteza
fucking
cant even do that right
over an hour and no high
i wish it took effect quicker
i dont want to be inside my head right now
i took more weed
i am suicidal and do not want to leave the server without an owner
It should just be "When the cicadas cry"
higurashi when they cry is a terrible name to begin with
FUCK madoka

Go for it, drop an @everyone
Lemme read this real quick
kk
<@!102691114762371072> are you still huntan
nhnghggnhg i gotta dilate too
i wanna finish up my gfl dailies
<@!102691114762371072> how long will you be around for huntan


maube i should sleep
busy tomorrow and i wanna play tf2 right now
anyway i'll get on it on monday i guess
i cant join you because it says i havent unlocked that part of the story
i guess this is just a 1 player quest?
through steam
just to see if it works
can you try and join me first?
oh i can't do anything with this quest board?
the quest marker only told me where to get the quest
where is the quest board
i got the first quest
<@!102691114762371072> okay how do you join me
getting close to the jagras stuff
im at the council
there is a lot of cutscene to get through
im trying my best
this game is so pretty
one sec gotta uninstall something
Ok i skip most of the opening scene
Loading mhw
I reached windows!
Show but present progress
Monitors issues now!
So, hoping
I was in the actual tutorial part when it crashed
Assuming my character was saved
Had to reseat then
There, fixed
Ram issue
Yeah my desktop is fucked for now
I dunno if I can play tonight
Fucking ram
I guess I hit space too early
I can't even fix it this time
I think it broke again
There was a hairstyle in called rathian style
Where's my rathian cut
i think i made it crash
HOLY SHIT ALL THIS CUSTOMIZATION
they just dumped you in the forest and said "have fun"
that was another good point of tri
ok good
is it a practice hunt or the normal "do shit with every weapon" crap
i mean any of us can host it, right?
when are we doing it anyway

also
Alternatively, we could get kiricoins running faster. Kriisa has a computer now, right?
That might get more people writing?
So like we could have prompts and say "Write about Symphogear or Revue Starlight"
Oh! People aren't going to just aimlessly write something for some other series, but we can also have like... secondary prompts for whatever shit was popular in the previous anime season
content creators period
The main issue is there aren't a whole lot of writers to begin with
We can run prompts for more than just fanfic maybe?
Tuesday
Instead nothing happens on like
It wouldn't, but it'd be better than just having nothing happen on Saturday and Sunday
If we get 3 prompts all on Sunday, we can still space them out
Well, yes, that's why we keep a backlog
We can also let people submit multiple prompts this way
Instead of biweekly prompts with reviews in between, we do weekly prompts with reviews as soon as possible after submission. And by "as soon as possible" I mean designate a few times each day that are acceptable review periods and drop one per review period, in order of submission in case we have multiples in a backlog
I wanna change up the format since if our target is 5, that doesn't fill a week
school starting is a fair point
we got like 9 on the first two
<@99695384296701952> the past like... 3 prompts have all been underwhelming in terms of how many prompts were submitted, yeah?
still, she needs support
I don't think tiny miku will fall to inceldom
gotta dilate using the new and improved method my PT... nurse? told me to do
so im probably gonna quit for tonight and do it tomorrow
i have to leave here at 9:50 AM tomorrow
i need a second person to help, I can't capture it within 15 minutes on my own and there are no other investigations with gold rewards
i hate this monster so much
world did away with the armor split but i'll try and tear them off this asshole who's too good for having an easily reachable tail
like it always existed but it was way more complex in earlier games
im not sure if i like the new weapon tree thing
longswords time im not putting up with this fucker and its high heels with dual blades
fucking
need plate
uuuurgnrbnghgn
wondering if- what's wrong with elise
do you want to come assist me in hunting a wyvern to extinction
thats where
zorah
where did i get the lah from
magdaros
yes
magdalah isn't gonna be any easier on me
i should probably craft anja armor then considering how much damage anja did to me
wondering if i should craft anja armor for magdalah or just upgrade my barroth armor
Zinogre?
Toby was basically narga but less of an asshole
anjanath fucked my shit up
that was piss easy
what no
also god damn this is some difficulty curve <@!102691114762371072>
i can do a us stream any day thats not tuesday i think
I actually don't want to spring this on everyone as a surprise. I'd like to announce that it's happening considering other people need it to fit their schedule too. Let's run the stream next week and just be generally festive tomorrow.
Friday tomorrow?
Maybe do two streams to cover EU people as well.
But today I think we should probably figure out when we want to do the stream.
Tomorrow I think we should do an announcement that it's happening as well as some other small event.
Normally I'd say no, but for something like this I think we'll need more time to plan it out and give people a heads up to schedule it in.
@everyone pls to input
I don't know if I'll be around at a good time
What time? I have electrolysis tomorrow.
yes, i do not have time travel capabilities
@everyone if no one has objections, i wanna do the stream on thursday
but you can
know what, fuck sleep, im gonna be an idiot and stay awake
got two
i think
okay i can do another one
need dem tail carves
bring slicing
not gonna voice since its just one mission
apparently the throat is anja's weak point
oh hey, the bestiary is helpful in world
we're bringing this one back alive
ill get the quest ready
no
<@!102691114762371072> I can do one (1) hunt, do you wanna join?
<@285555416056856576> not tomorrow, I don't wanna do a surprise stream because then no one will show up
what day are we doing the stream? @everyone give me an answer regardless of when you see this, DM it or just @ me
crop it however you think it looks best
go dig up the image of Hibiki in the yellow bodysuit from her training montage in S1 and set it as the server's picture either at 12:00 your time or right before you go to bed, whichever comes first
<@!102691114762371072> i have a task for you
shit i should have been dilating like an hour ago
physical therapist
what do you call a ph- oh just a PT
kero kero kero kero kero kero
i guess i didnt play far enough
oh
i was upset when they took them out for 3 and 4
oh cool they brought charms back
level 0 would point you only towards the area that the tracks start in
level 1 points you towards all tracks
if they pointed you in the direction of the first track that'd be nice
I like that, but finding the tracks is harder than finding the monster
this is not a positive when you have to backtrack or dont have any research levels for the monster you're after
the scoutflies let them be really extravagant with level design
most of my time was figuring out how to get the eggs back
did it really take me 40 minutes to beat up a rathian and steal her eggs

one second
"oh yeah, everyone loved it when we took them out for FU so we decided to put them in EVERY SINGLE INSTALLMENT afterwards"
seriously though fuck egg quests
k
and by evade i mean beat it out of her, along with her life
i shall attempt to evade the rathian's untempered rage on my own then
<@!102691114762371072> do you wanna make some omelettes
Thursday next week is best I think
But it still might be too sudden for other people
i can try to make tomorrow work. My appointment is at 3:00 so I should have enough time
@everyone can anyone make tomorrow work?
wait fuck i have an appointment tomorrow and might not be able to do it for the us time
can you do it tomorrow? <@290431224596660224>
maybe tomorrow?
hmmmm maybe friday is better actually, so im not asking people to watch action movies with us until 11 on a week night
9:00 might be better for the US watch since I'll have to make sure I'm covering the entirety of this needlessly huge country
one for US and one for EU
yeah, two streams
I can be there so since no one else is giving me an answer I at least want input from you to get timing for us vs eu down
<@290431224596660224> are we doing the stream thursday next week?
i got two plates though
what the fuck
that wasnt even a gold crown
holy SHIT that rathian was big
"im not an asshole anymore, trust me i've got me vouching for myself"


im in a "take a nap and maybe accidentally sleep for 12 hours" kind of mood
guess who's REALLY FUCKING TIRED and WANTS TO SLEEP FOREVER
Mt moon is tolerable because there's a pokecenter right outside the cave
I did make it to victory road in one run but fuuuuuck nuzlocke in that for frlg

people calling things slurs when they arent slurs and don't support a history of systemic abuse make me angry
morng
also you dont need to self censor in this channel. there are two t words and one is extra bad.
which t word and was the conversation public
because tsubasa and chris are both in the shot
im gonna rule it as a major spoiler
and his alts
i banned him
he didn't voluntarily leave
Oh ok
Who left I'm on mobile
sure
(ping in announcements)
Do an everyone ping like, 5 minutes before you start. Feel free to mess with the playlist while people wait.
<@290431224596660224> Remember to put https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtFGRci8PVQ or seiten galaxy cross or something on loop after the movie is done
https://cytu.be/r/symphogear
group account yes/no
<@290431224596660224> pls to input
Alternatively, I can just make an /r/symphogear account and have the details open here
that was persistent
when i did this with valk there was like, a mod role
oh, im not leader anymore
this is proving to be annoying
yes
yes
fuck it, might as well put up symphover
ok is it looping for you
wait did you change it
ok hang on i think i got it
how do i make this loooooop
we need some meme to put on loop while we aren't running the movie
did it pause for you
okay im in there and lets sort everything out before I go and make an announcement with the link
whats the link?
and then queue it up for me
i think you can just make me a mod actually
kk
all on one account, yeah?
how exactly are we running the watch?
<@290431224596660224> okay i should have mentioned this yesterday but i was absent all day
I was specifically looking for "Is this repeat behavior?" and the answer seems to be yes and that means not a whole lot has probably changed.
But the answer is that this incident is remarkably similar to the last incident and that's enough for both me and Kriisa to say we don't want her here.
It might be less than 4 years, but it was a while ago.
The other people are a group of people I met through FFXIV
Time to see if Kiri can ban people who aren't on the server. I'll tell Hazel myself.
Okay hey guess who actually has encountered Hazel in the past. After Some Shit last night and Some Shit maybe 4 years ago, she's fucking banned. Other people from The Last Time have had input but mostly along the lines of "yes this is probably repeat behavior" and "I really don't want to talk about her"
Not everywhere, I'm still able to talk to her. The issue is... complex.
dess_. Alice Much like vaginas, relationships of all sorts also have many moving parts
i know but still
gnuh, i feel crappy about the turnout
We'll have to condense it to one watch only. I'm not sure how much of my watch's lack of participants is due to low interest and how much is due to people having watched the UK one
Only one person aside from me left, and it might just be another instance of me or someone from the UK watch who didn't close the window.
~gamers~
<@290431224596660224> do you remember who exactly showed up to your watch? "3:00 PM on a Thursday" doesn't sound like a particularly good time for US people but who knows.
Down to 3 <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I think next time we need to do only one watch at the expense of time zone weirdness
Although Luci and I talked a bit
Only 4 people including myself and no one is talking <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>

```And did we mention that all cosmetic items you get from Premium Shop, Design Shop, and Style Crate are permanent?```
<@456226577798135808> ```We treat Design Shop as a platform where getting started as a designer will cost you some initial setup fees (like buying the templates and listing fees), as well as a flat percentage fee from revenue you make, but the rest of the proceeds go to you so that you can design more costumes or buy other things from the Premium Shop!```Are you ready to be the hottest maple designer in the world
i used to have that card!
divine grace
Also this one is temporary
The only people who really know anything are Kriisa and Latooni. I have info from Hazel herself but I don't know how much stock to put into her words, or how accurately she retold events.
Due to the multitude of things going on all at once on that front I don't really feel privileged to tell you anything specific. I was at the tail end of it all 3-4 years ago and I wasn't involved this time and both instances involved some stuff people just want to bury and never deal with again. If Kriisa wants to brief you about what happened then that's up to her but I'm not going to say anything.
Sometimes I get the feeling that this server has pretty much just become a playground for mods. Maybe I don't look at it often enough, but the traffic from us seems a lot higher than the traffic from anyone else.
And eventually I was like "I agree with the people in the links more than I do the people in the comments"
And then slowly it shifted towards LGBT people who were just being LGBT
Back when it was about making fun of otherkin and headmates
I used to be an active poster on tia
3 years ago
Wait when did I last comment on /r/tia
This server probably wouldn't be possible 4 years ago
yeah
fuyck there are 16 touhous now?
hang on i know what would make it worse
video games are more fun
not entirely sure i'll try and keep talking to them
yes

they apparently disliked it so hard they became a fundie
they found the gay shit

pretty sure you were there for it

we already turned them into robots once
don't tell me we have to keep an eye on shirabe AND kirika now
KIRICHAN AND SHIRABE.EXE DO A LETS PLAY IN LIVE-SHITPOSTING
FUCKING
don't make it like, exclusively "this week y'all need to write about one of these dumb ideas" but occasionally throw something dumb in as the third option or something
<@99695384296701952> suggestion: sprinkle server memes into prompts. the dumb shit we do that spawned here because of us being dumbasses
we have bot testing

that would be bad
yeah we can't let two people sharing a similar position in a server go out with each other
[monotone] wow. what a surprise. i didn't anticipate this at all.
but i found this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zvXylc1VGw
i didnt find what i was looking for
good choice
ah, stockholm syndrome
i gotta go, keep things civil, don't be dismissive, mod chat everyone's an adult etc
There was stuff to be brought up
then why is bringing the behavior up an issue?
You did fine, but bringing it up as a "this guy is mimicking asshats" type thing is actually useful because it lets us keep tabs on easily solvable problems as they come up
lectriclord did seem like he was parroting wien's behavior last night and simply lacks the conviction to actually stick to his guns on being an asshole. You've mentioned this in the past.
Okay, saki has acknowledged that she made a mistake. You don't need to harp on her.
drop it, saki wasn't looking to take action in the first place
this is what we call miscommunication
she's not presenting it as evidence, she's presenting it as "fuck this sort of thing"
venting is allowed, venting with a "here's the thing I'm venting about" is allowed
This person seems to be running an older version of feminism. Probably still uses XP too
https://twitter.com/rhealetta/status/1044939042255765504 ive found the hottest take of them all
yes
add super crowns to the game
Like, no double kirikas on the field
I really liked the idea of needing 3 different girls as units when the game first launched
nice
can you do it/will you do it
(after asking if people want that)
idea: any time we get a submission on the sub that has [XDU] in the title, kiri or shirabe ping the role
Do you wanna huntan whenever you're done and I get home
Godspeed
We can do rules afterwards when we can all have input
Right this moment, I'd like to let Kriisa use her free time to do bot things
Yeah, but "don't say bad things" is not the wording we want
Hug boxes aren't good
Ok but there are more nuanced ways to approach what is and is not acceptable behavior
Nah. There are a lot of not nice things that are valid to say.
Specifically rule 1
We do really need to overhaul the rules
Rule 1a says no excessive ripping. Rule 5 says we have the right to arbitrarily decide what is and is not excessive
They are in fact breaking a rule. You already gave an unofficial warning but make mention that we actually do not allow that on the server
Also point to rule 1a
Are these DMs?
easy workaround is just have people download music files separately and then point the game to wherever the files are located but not sure how feasible that is if it's gonna be browser based
<@!102691114762371072> possible issue with the game is that if we're making a symphogear game we're gonna want symphogear music and if we want symphogear music we have to subvert king records somehow
sympjhohear + super crown = symphogear 🍑
Symphoette
ultra rare memoria that's just fucking loss
yes we're doign this
fucking
oh my
4/5 Symphogear titles do not make sense
it doesn't exactly have to make sense either
I dunno I'm still thinking IGNITE is a neat name
but XDU has bad storytelling
I mean for storytelling it is
we use XD's counterpart
since XDU is X-Drive Unlimited
IGNITE
Thanks I won't
Electrolysis soon
We can do the gacha and game separately
But if the gacha is functional by then, why not?
And we do not have very complex methods of obtaining them
Do we really want to do a rolling release of kiricoins though. I think just dropping it in their laps and saying "hey we did a thing" is fine. People here are probably familiar with gachas.
Now if we sold kiricoins that would be crossing several lines
But yeah as long as people are actually having fun with it then a skinner box isn't exactly manipulative. And even if it is I wouldn't call it abusive manipulation.
Kinkshaming is banned
Skinner boxes aren't inherently bad
*slowly builds a skinner box*
Never ping for that though. Make sure that people are looking here for potential coins
Sounds good
Being helpful, self moderating, once in a while we can make it rain and just hand out coins for something miniscule like reacting to a message
or naming one card two different things
did it have to do with me naming two cards the same thing
i was rolling the bones
tity
i did a thing
barely a bear
bare? bear?
Also I vote for memoria tokens to bear the image of Elfnein
And tokens can be exchanged at a 3:1 ratio
Tokens though. I'm feeling like however many stars a card has, that's how many tokens you get. And then a 1 star card costs 3 tokens, 2 stars costs 6, 3 stars is 9, 4 stars is 15, and 5 stars is 24. Or are those costs too low/too high?
I guess
There are like a bajillion carbon copies of the default gears for every girl
Should we let them name their cards?
And do we want 3 cards to max awaken a card or do we wanna raise the bar?
And what is the exchange rate from token to token?
what about tokens? How many tokens should a given card cost, how many tokens should a given card turn into?
fair enough
and they'll be in a separate gacha from the gears?
are you sure
There are a lot of memoria
<@!102691114762371072>
oh, what memoria should we launch with?
How many tokens does a dupe give you, how many tokens to buy a card, how many tokens to buy a token?
What should the numbers be since we're planning on launching this pretty soon?
that sounds better actually
Or maybe there'd just be memoria tokens
And memoria dupes would also give you generic tokens
Maybe you'd spend character tokens on generic tokens rather than tokens for a different girl
I propose that 1) the higher the rarity, the more tokens you get and 2) each card gives a token specific to the featured girl (Chris cards would give you Chris tokens for example)

You can choose to spend those tokens directly on a card of the same girl, but you can ALSO choose to convert them into tokens for another girl.
What about when you already have a fully awakened card?
<@!102691114762371072> So how exactly is the gacha gonna work with regards to dupes?
anyway <@!102691114762371072> i have until Lyssa gets home to be absolutely useless on monhun
https://twitter.com/oypoolboy/status/1045425984315502599 meanwhile oypoolboy continues to be a gift to the world
But prozd focuses more on anime culture than anime
ProZD is about the only anime YouTuber I expect anything decent from
If he changed his politics I'd watch him
Demo is funny but all of his videos are tailored to white cis het dudes.
I'd also like to add that I'm incredibly uncomfortable around any sort of racist joking or commentary so I might be a bit biased. I used to have a co-worker who would make jokes about his being black daily and each time it was just a "why is our culture like this" thing.
It also depends on how blatant the rule breaking is. NIGGER in 32 point impact font on top of a picture of Chris is obviously worse than posting a video where demo d says nigga
The issue is that we're an anime server with LGBT rules which makes it easy for people to forget what flies and what doesn't if they're just shitposting
Heiro consists of a lot of mass reposts and people generally not paying attention. Tell them what the issue is, remove it, and wait until it becomes a trend before any official actions.
Also I think demo is white anyway
Even reclaimed, I'd say no because of the implication that it's totally okay for anyone to say
I'm on mobile so I can't watch the video. Don't give out harsh sentences for hiero though.
Each girl gets a 5 star, two 4 stars, and two 3 stars to start maybe.
Yes
Basically, you place your units on the battlefield and they carry out combat automatically. The idea I had was that you'd set each unit's AI before the fight but we could give each card in this its own AI
XDU actually inspired the idea
Hmmmm I've had an idea for a turn based strategy game for a while that could be modified and repurposed for this
Everyone started with ignite in the actual game but I feel like an all ignites event might be a good idea.
Actually maybe save X-Drive and Ignite for an event
Common pool should consist of main 6 to start I think, and each girl will have an X-Drive, an Ignite, and then an assortment of alternate styles like there'll be G and GX Igalima, Nehushtan vs Ichaival Chris
I'd say no cape in common but we have multiple capes
but then again if it's in a web page we could just add normal navigation
a list in discord doesn't cut it for something like this, but calling *other* user's lists and using that to check their cards could be neat
like that should be a thing before we push it. Let people actually look at their cards.
I would like an easy way to view which cards you have visually
I don't like the idea of going by attacks but i do like the idea of keeping them simple to start with
what's the difference in this scenario? Their attacks aren't printed on the cards when we extract them this way
which means like 3 marias tops
but then there would be no airgetlams
thoughts on my token pricing scheme earlier?
which cards are going to be in the launch gacha?
packs?
i am displaying the tokens

but different enough to tell the difference between a kiricoin and a kiri token
something similar to the kiricoins
yeah
feature request: images to use as the different tokens
oopsie woopsie maria made a little fuckie wuckie
i got a phantom thief hibiki
dess_.. alice
hm
dess_.. alice
wrong one kiri

oh
didn't we rule against setting faves
where are the current todos
i like how he announced his leaving but then it looked like ntohing happened because normal users cant see that channel
or leavened
did bread banned

hug
i like how all of this is a response to me completing a mission where I just have to kill 4 untempered monsters, 1 at a time
👀
i got vored twice completing the mission that did this
help me everyone wants to talk

and a way to pick a previous awakening for their flagship/avatar
a way to let users know how many awakenings a card has left
RXVer
for
RXV
gotta have an X
GX, AXZ, XDU
RVX
i feel like we need an X somewhere in the name
and tokens being used to purchase normally unavailable cards sounds neat
no
yeah i definitely want to launch this and kiricoins together
l m a o
yeah its not very useful if you cant buy them
do we want a "roll 10 times and get bonus goodies" feature?
so one memoria per team?
off map support units meaning they'll benefit the entire team but not have an actual presence on the map?
i made a statement just in case
How many memoria does a team get?
What should memoria do?
no guarantee that anyone is gonna have 4 different characters
up to 4, at least
XDU was 3, but less than 4 can feel wonky in turn based strategy
How many units should you have going into battle in this game?
dess_$
how do we feel about board manipulation? like setting a tile on fire
<@!102691114762371072> do we want to restrict people to one of each character? like you cant have two chrises or bikkis out. itd make the cards with off-character abilities more special
should be fine
ill just throw everything here into a doc
you know how i do with drafts
write things down when im done dilating
ill uh
i mean your idea wasnt bad it just also wasnt what we were going for
`organization`
hahaha my one true weakness
like all the dragon cards might have burn abilities to tie in with the dragon theme, even if only tsubasa normally has burns
some units might have atypical abilities generally reserved for other characters but other than that, everyone should have their own unique little gimmick to make it feel like "wow this is really a hibiki unit!"
just fucking go all in on that
like Shirabe had heals, kiri had poisons, basa had burns
also, XDU kinda dipped in the idea that each character had a specialty
each unit has a speed value that determines the order of actions
but "move to x space" you're headed for x space even if something about x space changes
so like "move to x unit" and then x unit goes somewhere else, you still move to x unit
if you target a unit rather than a space, actions will follow that unit even if it moves first
special attack should ALWAYS be top priority though, if the unit can do it, they WILL do it
sometimes attack might be higher up in priority than special action, so like a tsubasa who buffs her own attack if she can't do anything else
Generally, if the unit can use her special attack, she'll do that. If she can't, but can do some other unique ability such as healing or buffing teammates, she'll do that. If she can't, but she's in range of attacking an enemy, she'll do that. If she can't, then she just kinda sits there and waits for the next round.
so you can maneuver your characters to empty areas and hey maybe you wanna do that because it's a chris unit with an attack that does a shitton of damage to all enemies so long as she hasn't taken damage in a while
```at the start of each turn, you choose which other unit each of your units will target```actually make that "choose a target unit or space"
sometimes the trigger will be more in line with a healing or support unit
every unit has some sort of special attack that does something neat. conditions for using the attack can range from "adjacent to two enemy units" to "hasn't used the attack in at least 3 turns"
other units will be straight up attackers, and will usually be best suited targeting an enemy and then hopefully attacking that enemy
some units might be healers or stuff that will act even if there are no enemies in range, so long as the requirements for them to do other things are met (2+ allies nearby, ally with <50% health nearby, etc)
at the start of a game, you choose where to place your units. at the start of each turn, you choose which other unit each of your units will target. Past that, the game tries to automatically path your units to where they want to go and do what they want to do.
ok saki how's this for a game idea using the ai concept i mentioned earlier
pvp is no good if there's no one to play against
sounds good
i do like the idea of having pvp but also a pve element will be a nice way to hand out a limited number of kiricoins while teaching users how it actually works
which is to say, not at all
RV will be a card game as far as XDU and FGO are card games
headpat
you also do not mention the daily command
you do not mention anywhere that pulls cost 100 coins
(autoscorer and maria)
hand her the appropriate roles once you make the announcement
We should strive to stay current and slowly add in the backlog of event designs
Pounce on event designs but let there always be a reserve of cards we haven't implemented
we always wanna keep just a few steps behind XDU
So I think 3/4 of a pull per day is pretty safe here
Then they have a few other ways of generating gems but we can add stuff like that too
factor in arena rewards which are 50 I think? that's 1/2 of a pull daily
21+15 per week from dailies do that's about 1/4 of a pull daily
I mean in XDU you get uhh...
75 is good
Maybe a bit slower
one pull a day might be excessive. We'd want to generally keep pace with XDU
I suppose it could always be a permanent reaction event
Like a welcome package
Are you able to make it so that the first daily someone gets ever is always gonna be 100 coins and then it'll be the normal amount going forward?
then yeah, do that.
One prompts interaction, which is the entire point other than having fun
Do that., then. Don't grant coins universally, but do allow for people to manually grab coins if they're available.
so like, character birthday? dess_event to get some tokens
this would open the way for future things in the same vein as well
make it a time limited one time kiricoin bonus. Like they could do a dess_event command and they'll get some free kiricoins just for being around at the right time
but it says words coherently
that sentence is terrible
I would say give each unit a passive ability too, but I actually think I like the idea of giving some units a strong passive in place of their normal ability
stuff like that
XDU's color wheel, FGO's servant classes
do we want some sort of alignment system?
Feel free to replace <:HibikiGold:370774300883419136> with :KirikaCoin: btw

lemme uh, make that editable
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1haHivnDdYRbQNlCjwh9_3778brS68h4Vu5M4f6szfxQ/edit here's what I have so far with my game ideas
looks good to me
And also give it a nice big everyone ping because this is actual stuff people can interact with
I'd say the announcement should outright mention that we're adding a gacha to the discord
it's empty
uhhhh lemme take a look at what you're saying to take a look at first
damn near the entire server is spoiler channels too
too cumbersome to keep up
im gonna do away with spoiler channels once the gacha is finalized with that help embed
we can just generate them before planting
so we can only plant coins that we have
dess_$ <@!102691114762371072>
well that's convenient

what is that
can we work that into kirichan directly so that we're giving away coins through her rather than using dess_award?
We should also have it noted who's been rewarded already or not somewhere
It has to follow the rules too, so make sure art is sourced if you're about to hand out coins
No more than 25 a day to prevent spam
For subreddit posts... 25 for making a post that is either quality content or high effort content.
yeah
I'd say 500 for a submission.
i take it back
i dont like that
no
No more than 75 a day from subreddit posts though
75 if you've managed to do both
25 for quality posts, 50 for high effort posts
Think of the memes
The memes Latooni
Arbitrary decisions for the subreddit stuff. We don't want to encourage people making bad doodles and posting them, but just think of the memes we can get
might be a bit high especially if we're switching to a prompt every week for october
yes we can
yes
like i wont mention the tokens directly
Should I tease the tokens at least
how long until we kick the game off do you think?
or keep it secret
should I tease them with `future gachas` that we came up with?
or will that come with The Second Wave
also weren't we gonna make an entire bot command category
I feel we should maybe try and curb discussion in the command channels
can i move the RV category <@!102691114762371072>
so you wanna make it so that those weaknesses aren't easily nullified
you can control who you field, but you CAN'T control what you're up against
they're similar but weaknesses should be more generic so that they pop up more often in game play
but also I think weaknesses should be discussed separately from gimmicks
we have obtained food so back in a bit
I do like the idea of each girl playing off of their partner's strengths
oooh i like that
Get her away from enemies for a few turns and then have her move in to unload
yeah
Homage to the scene in S1
But Chris is hardly the only character with ranged options. That one I think might be better as like... charged attacks where she gets more powerful the less damage she takes.
kiri cards can be usually good at nuking, but i dont want to make that her gimmick
i don't like something as generic as nuke being a character's identity. i don't even like chris being ranged, i just put that down.
what exactly would be flashy though
but it's not final, I just wanted to make that clear
Poison is just the kirika thing with respect to mechanics
Other aspects of kiri cards can be flashy
But if it's like "I need a poison card" generally you'll look to Kirika
eg dragon cards all inflict burn in some way even if it's basa's thing, edgebikki might do self-buffing instead of ally-buffing
But it's meant to be things that only they do outside of certain circumstances
I mean it's not the ONLY thing they'll do
```Hibiki: Offensive buffs to friendly units
Tsubasa: Burn (short lasting high tick dot, multiple burns will stack duration)
Chris: Ranged damage
Kirika: Poison (long lasting low tick dot, multiple poisons will stack intensity)
Shirabe: Defensive buffs to friendly units
Maria: Self-buffs
Kanade: Non-damaging debuffs to enemy units
Miku: Damage reflection
Serena: Heals```How's this for each character's unique thing that they do once we have the game part running
event gachas that have rare pools for stuff like the event gears and xds/ignites
I'd say 2 normal gachas + 1 event gacha at a time
4 gachas is a lot
how often do we plan on rotating gachas
symphogear jeopardy
but in discord and with kiricoins
just some random game show
if we can do teams we should totally hold competitions
I'd say 700 just for making it possible at all is fair
^
lyssa is tempting me with headpats be back in a bit
...yes
Getting a prompt in should provide more coins than normal I think
For other forms of fancontent (like a game or whatever) that will depend entirely on what they have actually made
Spam can be recognized as such so we reserve the right to say slow down
I'd say it should depend on medium? A sketch should get you maybe 50 coins. A finished picture can get 200. Finished picture with background can be 500. For writing, I'd say 1 coin per ten words?
oh
so that we don't push it off
lets do that once the event ends
which then leads to them being more active to get the coins back
and then hoarders end up spending their coins
we know who's hoarding due to the leaderboard. We can tailor gachas to hoarder's tastes
i have ideas
hmmm
if we did something like guaranteed character one time only gachas i wouldn't be opposed to that, but i wanna not do it on literally day 2
so you keep trying to get it
a huge part of the draw is *not* having what you want
no favorites
sparkle's kiri?
no favorites. If he gets a guaranteed kanade, where's 98's guaranteed maria?
he can buy kanades with tokens like everyone else
we decided against favorites and I'm deciding against this
overruled
<@!102691114762371072> what is this surprise
I do want to do periodic air drops of coins at some times though
i suppose random drops might not be the best
Like, definitely not in fancontent
I mean, we'd put them in channels where it wouldn't be as much of a derailer
with higher drop rates on certain days or in special channels
I thought we were just figuring out which channels to put them on and then enabling them
<@!102691114762371072> When should we add random kiricoin drops?
but could you list either in a portfolio
im addressing latooni's concerns
but yeah designing units is something I'd definitely be willing to do on my own
70 damage because 100+20-50 and 110 because 100+10
which gives her nice synergy with hibiki and also shirabe
Miku receives 70 damage and reflects 110 damage
and got hit with a 100 damage attack that had a +20 damage buff on it
So like, if Miku had a -50 incoming damage and a +10 outgoing damage buff
also for Miku's damage reflection... base damage on the DR should be the base damage of whatever she gets hit with, and then add on Miku's buffs and debuffs after that base
im totally willing to take the hit and be resident ability designer though
this is why i liked the poison idea, it's easy to play around with
and we can also just tweak numbers in places
we can reuse some of them
homogenous is good in general, just not when it comes to gimmicks
how about gains a buff for x turns after counterattacking
it feels less defining if everyone can do it and you just do it better
unsure how i feel about a character's gimmick being "really good at something other units can do as well"
because counters are pretty staple in turn based strategy
do we wanna make counterattacks an exclusively kiri thing or a kiri is really good at them thing
and some cards should absolutely have passives
if we wanna give a card a passive, it should be in place of one of their abilities
yeah
I thought about that but felt like it would make things too homogenous
non-gimmicky will be all around better for a given situation but sometimes you just gotta load up on dots for a particular fight
I'm personally of the mind that we should have a fair amount of both gimmicky and non-gimmicky cards
actually i guess it depends on how much we want to gear the gears toward their gimmicks
did I?
Also she's Lynx's gf
I feel like we should at some point add a one-time only, permanent gift of some number of coins to get people started
^
24 unicode sounds fair honestly
well, there's a limit of 2000 characters because discord
that might actually be a problem
rv_rename
`should i tweet about our gacha`
should i
I expect you of all people to properly read announcements, R
If they clicked the event reaction they did
it's a constant reminder that they're there, a constant reminder of how close you are to your next pull
XDU shows you your gems in the top right on EVERY screen
yes but you don't have that shown to you constantly
"Hey this server has the XDU gacha for free" is some good advertising
Another thing we want the system to accomplish is to advertise our server without us lifting a finger
So we have to fabricate that with just letting them interact more often
One disadvantage we have until the webapp is set up is that we do not have a persistent counter that users can view their kiricoins with
We also DO want to allow users to roll often (although not so often that they accumulate an excess of tokens)
Don't differentiate between Symphogear art and other art, as long as it's getting people active it's good
We want to encourage activity of any kind
no one here take that plant

gonna see what the message looks like in here first tho
I think I'm gonna try planting coins around the server for a bit to see how the community reacts and responds to it popping up

we can tell which invites get used but not who used them
What channel should I ask in
it's already on 20
Aria
Don't have to do it right now but put it on the todo list at least
Making it something they have to interact with is good, but Latooni has a point
Fair enough
I think the intro package should be something they actively click on or use a command for
Also most of what I said in the past was before I became friends with like, all of them
Lynx is the one without an account
uh, draco browses the sub
Go for it
That's a problem solved through different methods.
But it's a different problem
It is a problem
Well
And that's "total coins on server". It's actually not a huge problem if one person has ten thousand coins as long as no one else has any coins.
So like, that's generally where the divide is being drawn I think. Do we want pay-outs to be flat or based on the pay-in, and personally I'd want flat pay-outs so that more coins get deleted. We want to encourage user participation by giving them coins, but at the same time we also don't want to let people accumulate too many coins.

R is doing work right now so I'm not gonna ping him about this but I will pin that last message for when he's done. Or if he pokes his head in again to say something.
I feel R may have been getting hung up on the idea of traditional gambling, but traditional gambling has the pitfall of requiring actual money. We use monopoly money so we can do whatever the fuck we want and print/delete it as we see fit.
I do like the idea of having fixed pay outs so that

1) People do not harbor resentment
2) Coins are more easily deleted
Alright
Oh, can reaction events deduct currency?
Okay, okay lets clear ourselves for a moment. Saki, can you outline a potential pay-in event that would allow us to pay out less than users have paid in?
I agree with R in regards to "hey look we can let people gamble and sometimes just delete coins"
I agree with Saki in regards to "that person got my coins" feeling bad and also "saki is not our work horse"
Then the question is merely how to obfuscate it
We shouldn't tell people exactly how it functions, in fact
I do not think that is a bad thing, HOWEVER, we do not need to tell people exactly how it functions
Because everyone is thinking about a different thing and we're all calling it the same name
I think everyone has been arguing with their own idea of what a pool or a pot is and that is what has caused a lot of the miscommunication here
Because the gacha has a limit.
Gambling gives us a nice out to delete coins. We absolutely need ways to delete coins besides the gacha.
And the response to *that* is "but we can just print money"

Having temporary pools or keeping track of who's participating in what makes a lot more sense
Okay so what I was getting last night was that the pot object would be this omnipresent holder of coins that we dip into when we need to and would always be there
Would it not make more sense to generate temporary instances of a pool like that rather than to keep one around constantly?
We do need coin sinks that aren't the gacha though. Something that can eat up coins repeatedly so that people always need more.
Keeping a persistent collection of coins that have been paid in might not be the best considering we can just generate and delete currency as we see fit but allowing users to make bets on things that aren't premade games sounds fun.
I unretract the idea, gambling sounds great. I don't know exactly what R had in mind, but I think programming in some function that allows two or more users to pool some money together and then redistribute it to a winner or winners would be awesome.
thank you
You're running into that wall of having potentially good ideas but not being good at communicating them again. For what it's worth, I very much like the idea of gambling with kiricoins, I'm just not sure I like what you've suggested here.
<@456226577798135808> it's come up between us before and im watching it between you and saki right now. Please illustrate your ideas and present them in a visual manner so that at least I can follow this
Alright, but your input on what we do is still valued
ok
I should have done so a while ago
I am going to dilate
anyway, all we can do at this point is just throw ideas around and see what's easy and what's not and what would just be plain neat to have even if it's a bit of work
That would be work though
Another idea might be like... whoever has donated the most at any point in time gets a special role (although donations would have to be wiped periodically to let new users in on it)
Taxes in their virtual auction houses, donation drives, we can add plenty of ways to delete kiricoins without people being upset about it
But anyway, point is, a lot of online games have a lot of different things they've done over the years to add money sinks and prevent inflation from being too much of a problem.
I didn't realize it was not
I thought it was already on your todo list
I thought we did
"donate x kiricoins and get a neat badge that doesn't do anything. get multiple badges if you want!"
Since we plan on implementing proper user profiles through the webapp, we could do something similar.
Past user trophies
The prizes for donating were meaningless things like profile badges or whatever, but it was a HUGE sink for neopoints since donating didn't do a whole lot.
They encouraged users to help donate to fix the wheels.
Alright, so here's an idea. A few years ago, neopets had (and still has to be fair) a MASSIVE inflation problem. TNT also wanted to rework all of the wheels to run on html5 instead of flash. So the answer was that, while the wheels were being worked on, there was an "incident" and all the wheels were broke.
What we want is a way for wealth to be redistributed and I don't think a pot is a very good way of doing that.
For different reasons!
Okay, but stuff like rv_rename don't need to stick around
Oh, another thing that should maybe be done <@!102691114762371072> 

One channel for pull commands where commands aren't deleted so that everyone sees people pulling.
One channel for commands with an in-channel output that don't get deleted, for things like rv_userlookup
One channel for commands that get deleted afterwards, for things like dess_timely and rv_rename. Also stick the list of commands in here.
It's only been a few days, don't add a second gacha in so quickly. Give it like a week at least.
Ok well, definitely at least wait until people have enough for another 5-roll before you add a new gacha
once we have the game running, we can match that pace, but I think we should keep it to every 3-4 weeks before then and I'm not entirely sure why so feel free to convince me otherwise
XDU has a new event - and with it new cards - about every other week
yeah I saw no problem with it to begin with
also I think the consensus we got was that yes you may have bonus coins for making the gacha so stuff your pockets with like 400 coins I guess? only outside really commented on it
oh, 4) make sure that the common pools don't change too much. XDU recycles existing gears heavily which means we have to do that too to avoid running out of things to stuff in the gacha
audible gasp
and so is pirate kiri
tbh wonderland kiri is great
bridal I would suggest doing in spring but if you really wanna
rates obviously not specified
1) I think we should be moderatey slow with new gachas until the game is done
2) Swimphogears are definitely a summer thing, lets hold those and implement something less seasonal like dragons first
3) People should be able to view which rare cards are in a gacha to entice them into rolling more
no
but you already know when we're gonna release memoria
4 or 5 days
But also I think we should do that in like
Sync is going to save coins until we do an XD Fine gacha. We don't want Sync to just get XD Fine immediately. I think our next gacha should have Gen/Ver/Fine and XD Fine as the rare pool
Okay so <@!102691114762371072> I know you want one of those good Kiri cards but you wanna test out people's impulses real quick?
dess_lb
whens mikubot
single as in lone, not single as in not dating
but why
that is a fair point
Also restricting rv commands to relevant channels might be good because I don't know if I want people doing rv_pull in general chat
dess_timely doesn't need to stay either
That can be a DM output
No tricky file moving, just download the music and go
I think so. I'd like something more convenient for the game so that everything is organized properly out the gate
And toss songs onto a mega or something that we don't advertise but totally let people know they could do it if they wanted to
<@456226577798135808> we're just gonna work around KR by having the music files played through the user's own files
But it'll help if we limit the gacha purely to discord, and the webapp simply uses the json's that are conveniently linked to our gacha
No way around Bushiroad
Bushiroad MIGHT give a shit
King Records would give a shit so we don't package the game with music files
Satelight won't give a shit
but anyway, we don't need to be super secretive about this once it's released. Nintendo is known to go after their IPs like possessed hell hounds
still impressive
ok so we're one of few
why mash up this is america with crab rave
i havent actually seen the video for that but i dont understand it
that's totally doable
and just have ZENBU ZENBU ZENBU ZENBU for the cut in
so like if we want a cutin or something
there are also fair use arguments so if we ONLY have 10 second clips of music we can probably get away with it
which im not sure it can
as long as the webapp can play from a locally stored file
and dodging king records is an accomplishable feat
bushiroad might care actually but I don't think they'll find us
The legal ramifications are "dodge king records, no one else with the rights actually cares"
we are god
we're the only ones doing it
we're the first
how many people have made a symphogear game before?
also xdu sucks so we're making our own game
because im bad at life
it's time for monsters
and im gonna do neither of those things
and shave
i need to shower
anyway
past that they have to come on here and interact
Just, the moment someone boots up the webapp, that is their welcome package of 5+1 rolls
The webapp may be a better avenue to do this. Let people play around with the webapp and say "hey you get to actually roll if you join our discord"
ok good you fixed it

Okay. I just don't want you to get depressed over it.
*flashbacks to halloween layout*
You've gotten a bit disheartened at negative reactions in the past and I wanna make sure you get a no when you're prepared to get a no.
<@456226577798135808> I am not going to turn you down on either of these and would, in fact, love to have your help with it. However. There is a caveat.

Any time you have something to show us, be absolutely prepared for someone to say "No, this is the exact opposite of what we want"
There are very tricky lines here and we need to make sure we stay on the correct side of those lines
I do know they can't blanket copyright the gacha itself
Use that then. And I think as long as we don't use the bushiroad sprites we can get around them. I don't know exactly what their copyright is.
otherwise just make our own directory and put it on mega or something
I think we should take a look at the nyaa directory and use that if possible
Solid, but again, "who is that?"
getting into "who is that?" territory. I'd say apply the green filter to a different image of Kirika
dess_.. R
dess_. R My brain has been permanently traumatized by the lack of pussy in my life.
right now I'm in a bit of a "brain booting up, monsterhunter.exe initialized mode" so I don't know if I can coherently type out exactly what I was gonna do right now
That would mean spreading it out across a much longer timeline, doing mid-week episodes, and not relying so much on the live watch
right now i don't know how we'd do it. We can go with my original idea or we can do a different format

i already did it kinda
that's why i initially reached out to krotash and the flifla subreddit
<@290431224596660224> So, one of the huge things I was planning with the flifla rewatch was to also do threads on /r/anime with a little "hey we're also hosting a live rewatch on the symphogear server!" to try and snag some users from there to make our discord grow
That's what I was doing initially. I don't think they'll be opposed to it even with my mostly unexplained absence
I'd love it if you hosted a flifla watch because last time I tried to do that a lot of pieces of my life started to fall apart (completely unrelated to the watch) and I still wanna do the watch but I dunno if I wanna put effort back into it again
get rid of the text and give her a dark green background
https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/jOIr_Qz9apl3ZcloWSVsK-ZfJ0RQkVUqNM5GePksrGI.png this one
Maybe take the old Kirika icon we had on the halloween design and use that?
personally I feel like an image that can also include her scythe would be best
4.6% chance of getting them at all and almost just as likely to get the normal as their XD
2.2% chance of pulling their XD form
2.4% chance of pulling Kanade/Miku/Serena in normal form and
and 9 gears in the rare pool
Giving us 33
So that's... 5*6+3 gears in the normal pool
i wanna figure the likelihood of pulling any of the 3 non-main girls and also the likelihood of pulling their normals vs their x-drives
can you check?
how many non x-drives did we put in for each character again? yes I know I helped pick them <@!102691114762371072>
The bonus for events that the host can't participate in should be higher than the bonus for ones they can
It depends on the type of event. If the host can't participate, they get a bonus just for hosting. If the host can participate, they get coins for participation and coins for hosting. If it's an event that someone can win at, bonus coins shall be awarded for winning.
And if you submit you should get the reward
Are you? You can submit the same as any other user.
waiting for maint to end
oh, today is maplestory headstart isnt it
Helps that a lot of it is written down
I'm sure I can recall stuff by the end of today or at the very least some time tomorrow.
Extracting shit is possible but difficult and I have to be in an exceptionally good state of mind to avoid drowning in all the bad shit that was going on at the same time.
The information is there but my mind likes to block all information from those times like an overprotective mother preventing her children from playing in the dirt because a deer might've pissed on it and they'll catch deer pissitis
not in any distress right now, it's just hard to revisit things that were going on at the same time as mental breakdowns
poke me a bit later and I'll see if I can separate the flifla rewatch ideas from all the suicidal ideation going on at the same time

Then we do, in fact, need a menu
So maybe not
That can actually be done in discord though
Maybe. There should probably be a way to edit your team.
Most basic of questions. What should the webapp contain? We've got "game", "collections", and "profiles" so far
What'll it look like, where can we find stuff, etc
We're talking about visuals right now though
Simple isn't always better. Know your audience.
```Damage based on percentage of remaining health (yours or opponent’s)```vs```Damage based on your remaining health
Damage based on opponent’s remaining health```<@!102691114762371072>
```Two example behaviors:
Edgebikki
Basic attack: Range of 1 unit (any adjacent tile). Priority 2
Normal ability: Self-buff. Gain one stack of “attack up” with duration 3 for each unoccupied tile adjacent to Edgebikki. Priority 3.
Super ability: Deal 100% base damage to an adjacent enemy and multiply damage for each stack of attack up. Removes all buffs from Edgebikki. Cooldown of 3 turns. Priority 1.

3.5 Chris
Basic attack: Range of 3 units (up to 3 tiles from Chris’s location). Priority 2.
Normal ability: Passive. Gain one stack of “charging” with duration 20 for each turn 3.5 Chris does not deal or receive damage. Remove all stacks of “charging” whenever 3.5 Chris deals or receives damage. Each stack of charging multiplies 3.5 Chris’s damage by 1+(n/0.5)
Super ability: Deal 200% base damage to a random enemy unit with the most current health. Cooldown of 5 turns. Priority 1.
```Each unit would have its own unique combination of two abilities (although the abilities themselves might not be unique). Each component of an ability would be an easily adjustable variable (damage, buff, buff duration, etc) with the main bulk of work lying in just the boring task of actually putting the units together and sometimes creating new buffs/debuffs but never anything terribly complex. Each ability and basic attack will be given a priority that determines what the unit will do after moving, if it can do anything at all. Priority 1 means the unit will always use it if possible. Priority 2 is next, and priority 3 means the unit will only use it if the unit can do nothing else. <@!102691114762371072>
I also highly suggest taking saki's option over mine if possible because while I'd love to have you here it's fucking expensive as shit

also uh gimme a sec
I don't think any of the illuminati should ever be in the common pool just because of potential game balance issues in the future
When did we start?
I'm thinking next gacha should keep the XDs for Kanade/Serena/Miku and replace the other XDs with Ver/Gen/Fine/FineXD for the rare pool while the common pool would be 3 of each gear, keeping 1 each from the common pool of the current gacha.
semi-guarantees from me if you can get a job
also go for it
if you can. I don't want to give you  too much work <@290431224596660224>
can always change things later
depends on the voice. Maria's voice is kinda deep so alto?
sax is a good default for voices
having symphogear midis at all is huge
Yeah, no rush
musescore has the distinct advantage of easily being able to convert it into a midi
musescore maybe?
I actually think the one I wanna do most is Stand Up! Lady!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maX13aGRbno like I make bloody stream and it's midi as fuck
Lemme uh
It's never 100% exactly how it's like in the actual song, but that's part of why I like doing it.
That's whatever. When I'm composing for Maple I just pick the closest match.
Most of the instrumentation?
But also "fuck off" because if it's a server I'm moderating it damn well will not be tolerating that shit.
"I don't think anyone here has a problem with taking jokes, I just think a few might have a problem with making them"
depends on how australian you wanna sound
something along those lines
"piss off wanker"
"fuck off mate"
Especially when I need to run two instances of maplebeats
I can be pretty slow at it
converting isn't hard
I can maple it as soon as I have the midi
And we already have XD Fine going
Like, nothing is actually showing in tsubakana bathtime
Those are rare enough and generally SFW enough that I think we don't have to do anything special.
```The point of the prompt limitations like goth are to produce prompts that are bad in the first place.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1haHivnDdYRbQNlCjwh9_3778brS68h4Vu5M4f6szfxQ/edit?usp=sharing
<@!99695384296701952> can you look over the latter 7 pages of the design doc?
```Basic ability stats:
Range (Distance the ability can affect another unit from)
Priority (Determines which ability is used when multiple abilities meet their trigger requirements)
Alignment (Determines which units are valid targets for an ability. Ally, enemy, and self are all of the valid alignments and an ability can have multiple alignments)
Area of effect (Determines how many tiles an ability affects)
Cooldown (Turns until an ability may be used. Resets after the ability is used)
Duration (How long an ability lasts after being used.)
```<@!102691114762371072>
So I can't just hoard a massive amount of merets and be the instrument giver
Apparently gifting with red merets might be impossible too
I guess I'm just gonna have to go at maple hard so I can buy everything with red merets as soon as possible
no
It's exactly the same as GW2's system except you can't change back
blue merets turn into red merets
You buy their blue merets for mesos
They put them up on a marketplace or something
Random person buys blue merets
okay SO
theres so little information
ugh
i am back on board with this
and get the instruments that way
okay, you can buy red merets with mesos
you can also straight up buy every single instrument for uh... $52
okay they can be gotten with red merets
which i think are not real money only
lemme check if they can be bought with red merets
If I can earn them through other means I'll probably do it
Also decision pending on whether I'll be buying the instruments. If I HAVE to shell out $5 per instrument I'm just not gonna do it.
Either clarinet or sax again. There's only 1 sax in Maple so which one you pick is purely a matter of how you'd want the midi to sound.
Like, I used a clarinet for Bloody Stream
Vocals need to be expressed through an instrument, which is why I suggested the sax for Stand Up! Lady!!
Piano, Timpani, Clarinet, Harp, and Acoustic Guitar
which is shit
Although right now the message I'm getting is that there are only 5 basic instruments so... $5 per instrument if you wanna be musical
There's like 7 dfifferent guitars in maple
It's tricky to work with but it usually ends up creating much better scores
it's not an issue, it's actually a good thing
3 tracks in and I'm already getting to a point where I need a second editor open
<@290431224596660224> holy shit this is gonna be a lot of tracks
so that'd be nice
Makyuu Ichaival has the really recognizable "ZENBU ZENBU ZENBU ZENBU ZENBU" part
hmmmmmmmm
so even if i wasn't playing MH it'd be a few days
and also I'm almost certainly going to need multiple people to play this
that requires me to do something other than play monster hunter
okay how does 700 coins for 14 hours sound? That's 50 coins an hour <@290431224596660224>
bug me if you think i forgot
coins shall be awarded when i'm properly awake
witches
If they're normally laid back I'd tell them that it's not cool and explain why
This is why I don't moderate very many servers.
But yeah, make sure ability effects resolve in a specific order because that'll save you a lot of headaches for some stuff
I just have them all listed out because I don't know which shortcuts you'll be using
it's just the same conditions and triggers listed out a bunch of times for each thing, and I expect you to be able to take shortcuts
and also most of those pages are copy-paste stuff
absolutely do not make it so that each skill has all of its pieces resolve at once
<@!102691114762371072> make sure you code in an order of operations for skills
uh
17 pages of design doc so far and only like 3 of them are actually explaining how the game works
give them a death animation and then have them fade out and leave the tile unoccupied
that sounds way unintuitive
👎
This would become a huge issue if we wanted to make a battle say, your 4 gears against like 10 shitty noise
actually im just gonna not list that condition out because then it's either leave a unit on the map after it hits 0 HP (not ideal for this type of game)  or let the player keep track too (never ideal for any game I'm looking at you hearthstone)
kk
What about keeping track of *where* the unit died?
im starting to lose track of things i've put down
alright
Fair enough. I do however kind of want to add a "dead enemies/allies" condition though. Not necessarily for raise dead - maybe a card would have a skill where they get stronger with each fallen ally and necessitates the other team to take them out first. Or something else, I don't wanna close that door off entirely unless keeping track of dead units would be too much work.
Before I go further with this, are abilities that generate additional units good or too much work? Things like raise dead or summon minion.
red for the enemy itself, yellow for their movement
but also when hovering over an enemy, it should show the enemy's move range in yellow i think
I'd say do a mock up when you can and we can adjust if needed
i do not
lemme see if i have any duelyst picks of friendlies being selected
I would still vote for friendlies having a color for graphical consistency, although I'll admit it never bothered me much in Duelyst
yep
lemme check
Duelyst has colors if I'm not mistaken
Still needs a color imo
I was thinking more of a blue for "you can move here" and green for "this is a friendly unit"
Can passives have a target? Who knows, but I'm gonna write that in too
I'm adding them to the design doc for completeness sake, code them however you want
aghhhh fuck it ill add it to the doc
Because that sounds way easier than having a passive object separate from a buff or debuff object
are we going to just go ahead and say "passives are just invisible and endless buffs"?
yeah
You know, I'm just now understanding those moments where you look at how people exploit a game's mechanics in a speedrun and you just wonder "why the fuck did they code damage as a debuff"
in that same vein i'd say no burning tiles or the like either
yeah
but do we want tiles that restrict movement (either partially or completely) or tiles that do special things (like light you on fire)
yeah, standard rules
(and maybe friendlies but that always struck me as weird if friendlies are unpassable since they can just step aside)
"cannot pass" is the easy one because enemy units won't let you pass anyway
rough terrain meaning anything from "cannot pass" to "uses 2 movement to traverse" to "literally on fire"
will there or won't there be rough terrain in this game?
this seems like a good time to make a decision
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
you need more sleepy?
THEY BLOCKED AN ATTACK THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WAS COMING
KRIKA DODGED
FUCK
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
off topic but can you make Kirichan respond with "Igaligma balls" any time someone says "Igalima"
then it's working as intended
oh, okay
so maybe it's not clicking that does it at all aside from the button
...clicking the next turn button switches to player turn after a short bit
and not just from left to right
not just on units
actually it's changing from enemy turn to player turn on any click
also you can click on unflippable units. They won't flip, but they'll change the turn.
also clicking a flippable unit changes it from enemy turn to your turn if you flip it from facing left to right
so i can't actually see the next turn button without maximizing the window
and also the game does not auto-resize itself
yes, although the next turn button has some lag
headpat
i get a loading bar and th- oh there's the splash
here's the folder

yep
it's a white screen
That is one way of viewing it
`Makyuu Igaligma`
im sorry
i have to say it
also
But yeah, take a look at the design doc. I wrote it so that you don't actually have to code most of it, just make a handful of functions and call the relevant ones as needed.
Like, "trigger on kill" could very easily mean
```Deal damage based on attack
Check target's HP
Trigger additional effect if target's HP is 0% or lower```
If we reupload but without the cards, that is grounds for more serious repercussions.
They could try to sue for damages but no sane lawyer would go after a team of 5 broke people making a fan game.
Make us take the whole thing down
I think we should use the cards. The thumbnails are still their assets, even if they're easy to access.
I'm not saying we can't, I'm just wondering whether we want to run that risk. Personally I'm fine with the risk.
Also, related side note: while no one of importance is going to care one way or another about the discord gacha, if bushi ever finds out about the game we need to be able to say "hey we're not using any of your assets" and their assets include the cards. We're solving it partially by using our own custom sprites but how divorced from the game can we make the cards?
But I can tweet at them if you still wanna be absolutely sure about this
It's not redistribution if we're just linking to their source. Depending on the easter egg it may even be feasible to just slap the video itself in too rather than just playing the audio by bringing up the video in the background.
The easy solution is just have it play the youtube video itself
You should add the song in as an easter egg
<@!102691114762371072> Are you saying you did not use "world.execute(me)" for the memes
https://twitter.com/YuriMGirl/status/1048613902697811969
im slow and far more predisposed to just play video games for a few hours
despite wanting to be a writer, i'm actually really bad at reading
nghnghnn this style of writing is really hard for me to get through and i dont know why
<@!99695384296701952> is this one DL's? Because the writing is super off in terms of characterization but I know she said she was writing it in the style of gothic literature
https://dynasty-scans.com/tags/become_bread the most cursed of incantations
you memer
`world.execute(me)`
what kind of asshole
or post launch, yeah
I'll just move it to complete and put in things if I figure anything out
and even if I'm not, now's not the time to think about it
anyway, I thiiiink I'm done with ability effects
disarm and silence are in the design doc, we'll see how it goes with playtesting
we can do playtesting to see what works
"always first" would modify speed by +999 or something while "always last" modifies it by -999
That would be a passive that modifies speed
Somewhere you don't want her to be going into the next turn
No, I get that, but the issue there is on 3, you're still moving Kiri into enemy territory
I think I'm reaching a point with the design doc where I'm saying "fuck it this is enough"
in Fire Emblem if you get disarmed you adapt accordingly the moment the debuff hits
Still not the best imo. The reason skills like that work in Fire Emblem is because each unit goes one by one. If you get disarmed, you're *still* throwing the unit out of position for the next turn
The automated nature means if you get silenced or disarmed mid turn you kinda get screwed hard
yeah I'd be super hesitant about giving any unit a silence or disarm
right now I have "Buffs that increase counter chance" listed with the idea that until we find a good reason to do so otherwise, they increase chance by 100% and you start with 0%
so counters I think might be best suited as a buff?
we wanna keep rng low
disarm would prevent you from using basic attacks as well as preventing counters I guess
There are also "debuffs that disarm" and "debuffs that silence" although I'm not sure either of those will actually happen. There's enough of a chance that I listed them though.
crits are a hard no
I was thinking a blind effect
The automated nature of the game doesn't lend well to natural misses
dodging is not currently listed in the design doc
and what about missing?
How do we wanna handle counterattacks if at all
Will there be counterattacks in this game and will they be inherent to every unit and will they have a probability for occurring for every unit?
I think the best answer is "don't worry about it"
I do very much want an in game collection viewer
We can use the names players give their cards from the json and just assign each girl our own art in the style of the game. Doesn't fix the collection issue though.
sneepy
i am going to nap
As long as it's the same character that gave you the tokens. Otherwise you can trade in 3 character tokens for 1 generic token which will give you whatever you want if you have 10.
The same thing we already do, hand out a token instead
plus they can just search a card
Favorites first, by level, by character, etc
People will work with their favorites no matter what and we can reduce clutter by allowing sorting
There will be literally no reason to trash a card other than "I don't really like it that much"
Because they choose to trash them and we're not making money off of this
No
And the jsons should be able to store every single card a user has. And yes, if a player does not have 4 cards they should still be allowed to play.
4
party maximum of forces?
<@!102691114762371072> Are you capable of seeing which cards have never been pulled by anyone?
fight with your back to wall so that the only way out is through or something
that's some sun tzu shit right there
also <@!99695384296701952>
I added a "UI mechanics" section to the design doc and also gave everything bullet points <@456226577798135808> <@!102691114762371072>
do your homework <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Do we get coins for putting this game together though
They're a pretty good motivator and I'd probably be trying for coins if I weren't also hammering out design stuff for the game
And also wondering if Kiricoins play a factor
Or do they give up after nothing coming to them?
Like do they always have ideas and just don't feel the drive to write?
I'm wondering if the surge is because the prompts are particularly good or because people felt bad about not being able to write something goth even though they had idea.
which is about 45 minutes more than 15 minutes
an hour
it was
i feel like i slept for 15 minutes
No repeats for now
Dot damage shall occur at the beginning of a unit's turn.
Winner is determined when all units on a given team are at 0 HP, regardless of if they have moved or not.
Alright. I need people to ask me random shit about the game and how it'll work. Everything is fair game here: visuals, mechanics, structure, if you have a question, even one with an obvious answer, ask me it.

please do not taint the language of this channel with sweet and sour sauce
Am I understanding correctly that you were under the impression that FGO had a copyright on prism and therefore we could not use the term prism tokens?
```they dont copyright the word prism```
You're saying a lot of things without thinking about them first
R, is your brain currently caught up with your mouth
meta sounds kinda weird. I also don't see how the fgo thing is a problem.
yeah, since all of the non-gear users are rare anyway just have them hand out prism tokens
I like prism more, prismata isn't an actual word
we have chris tokens, maria tokens, serena tokens, kirika tokens, shirabe tokens, hibiki tokens, tsubasa tokens, kanade tokens, miku tokens, and generic tokens
There's a reason that there is not actually a way to use tokens yet
The gacha alone has proven enough incentive to get people doing stuff.
What everything else? We have a gacha and we're building a game for that gacha.
And get the other characters you do want
Then you change your character tokens for generic tokens
i am going to go shower, ping me if you think of more random questions to ask about the game so i can refine the design doc more
They never really talked in valk because Quinn and Hecate are insufferable twats
Jacq may be the person I most regret bringing into a chat on any platform. Like that time you meet someone at an anime con and think they're pretty cool but then when you invite them to your IRC server they start talking about how they had a fight with their best friend because they both had the same waifu.
what
If we ever add a unit that is healable even after their health reaches zero, we have to call that passive "Earthbound"
have you taken a look at the UI mechanics section of the design doc?
<@!102691114762371072> Have you not coded in the "pass by friendlies for free" interaction?
^
done
Multiplayer is an "on the horizon" thing so nothing is going to be set in stone there but I'd like it if users could wager kiricoins on fights as well as a way to keep track of w/l on their profile page.
Maybe
end of round occurs when all units have taken their turn
yeah
They'll tick at the end of each round
Actually, non-targeted buffs are a possibility
That's a question for Saki.
Field buffs are a possibility but should be tied to the source unit (kill the source, remove the buff)
Hovering over a unit should display its buffs/debuffs and stacks
There doesn't have to be a win state, just a "not lose" state
I have ```When all units on a given team are at 0 or less health, that team loses.```so a tie will be treated as a loss
AKA design space
Sure, but then once it hits the wall it just runs in a different direction. And also, that'd be... what? One instance of it being able to retaliate that leads to a ton of damage being done as it runs away before moving back in to reapply the dot?
because that'd be bonkers
Correct, and that's why you might notice the design doc does not list buffs that can increase range
But, again, that leads to turtling whether it can deal damage or not.
Not if it also has enough range to land a dot after it runs
With the "all units move then all units attack" model then a unit with high speed but low movement will never touch a unit with low speed but high movement
If damage occurs before the target gets a chance to move out of the way, base movement isn't as much of an issue and can be toyed with accordingly.
That's the point of the system I outlined. They can't. The damage is the penalty. If ALL units move before ANY damage occurs, then there's no damage. And higher base movement is an issue. It severely limits any haste type buffs that might be used.
If someone overextends by a significant margin they should be penalized equal to that overextension.
Even with smaller grid sizes, if you can just move your unit out of harm's way before harm can befall it, you end up with games decided by turtling strategies and turtling is the opposite of fun. The defender should be planning around their vulnerabilities, the attacker shouldn't need to get a read on them to deal that last 2% of damage. It undermines unit targeting a bit because then the attacker targets the slow and vulnerable unit only for it to... move out of the way.
<@!102691114762371072> input?
With Saki's model I feel we'd get a kind of game of cat and mouse going? Where one team is on its last legs but they just keep retreating while dots ruin the other team.
Which is the main drawback of a slow unit that allows us to make them powerful in other areas.
In my mind I had it that if you think your opponent is going to move their unit to attack yours, either you plan to counter it with your own attack or you run away while taking some flak
But is in Saki's outline
Which in my outline is not the case
Only if the attackers don't attack until everything else is resolved
Speed will be variable so some enemy units will take their turn in between two of your units for example
Also for both teams
With a... exception? break? in the process in case all units on one team go below 1 health to declare a game
Basically, I was envisioning it as

1) Hit button
2) Unit with highest speed moves
3) Damage/Healing over time procs
4) Unit with highest speed resolves actions
5) Buff/Debuff/Stack counters tick
6) Repeat steps 2 through 5 until you've fully resolved each unit
7) Field statuses evaluate
8) Death occurs
9) Return to 1
There is that
Also I feel like people shouldn't be allowed to target a tile that's out of range, since it will always be out of range barring any reposition abilities. Targeting an out of range unit is fair game though because the targeted unit can move into range.
From a multiplayer perspective, I feel like Latooni and my version is better because it adds in an extra layer of "I need to predict what my opponent is going to do so I can counter it accordingly" which I believe is present in Frozen Synapse (although in Frozen Synapse all units move simultaneously)
And I'm not entirely sure what Kriisa's diagrams were depicting
```how should unit adjacency bonus be visually represented, or should it be at all```Abilities influenced by factor factors like this should read something like "Deal 500% damage to an enemy. Becomes stronger for each adjacent friendly unit." with the number being affected in green if it's above base or red if it's below base. White for at base.

As for the ongoing discussion about unit order... I had it in my head that units would move, then act, then move on to the next unit's turn
Because the buff will tick on the affected unit no matter what, it has to be active immediately. Unless we add a clause that buffs aren't in effect until the next turn but then that's unintuitive for everything that doesn't relate to speed.
And not in a good way. We want predictability to be in the hands of the user, not the program.
Correct. I would say to reroll each round, but that introduces even more rng and means that turns become less predictable.
I think if two units have identical speed that is when you roll the dice. Can't think of any better qualifiers. Only ever roll the dice once, at the start of the game.
just thinking on how soon you want to roll the dice
It IS possible for two identical units to be on the field in multiplayer so at a certain point you have to have some amount of RNG
If there are two speed 6 units though, I'm thinking on the best way to resolve that
I wanna say jumble but in a predictabl- oh. Yes. Speed 6 is always going to go before speed 5.
hmmmmmmm
ok
that

one second
Right now I'd define what's on the test built as a "box overlay". If you look at the UI mechanics section, you'll notice I also mention "crosshair overlay". The best visual depiction I can give for that is uh
what about shape
Additionally <@!102691114762371072> the one thing other than this that I can recall saying "lets just test it" for at the moment is tile overlays to indicate friendly/enemy units and where they can move. Is that something trivial to test or do we need to figure out exactly what we're doing there sooner rather than later?
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1haHivnDdYRbQNlCjwh9_3778brS68h4Vu5M4f6szfxQ/edit?usp=sharing <@!99695384296701952> <@!102691114762371072> I added a "resolution of round" section. Please scrutinize it *heavily* and bring up any issues it might have.
You're coming off as a bit agitated at the moment, I'm not particularly enjoying the discussion myself, lets just take a night to cool it and talk about it later. I don't wanna push you too hard.
I think we should call the discussion off for now and revisit it tomorrow.
What if the left blue dot was targeting the left red dot?
How does a unit curve on a grid?
What if a unit with a unit target had targeted a unit with a unit target?
But also if each unit moves simultaneously, how would one unit follow another unit? Which was a pretty core part of the unit targeting mechanic.
If we do that I'M going to have to go back and redesign a lot.
That... doesn't work with how I envisioned the unit targeting at all.
How would turns take longer? It'd be the same number of actions.
Alright, so we won't playtest it and we'll hash it out now. What's the drawback in the system I outlined?
But also we're discussing it now so we don't have to do that
Develop one without locking yourself out and if it doesn't work we try the other
No?
If needed we can playtest both systems
Which is why I keep pointing out turtling. Turtling isn't fun. It's just tedious.
What Latooni said, too. It's not entirely a question about balance but also feel. Is it fun to operate in?
Even a scenario where a unit is down to 10% health but its movement is high enough that nothing else can hit it is a bad scenario because it means the high movement unit just keeps running and creates a deadlock.
No, I'm giving you an example because you asked for one
I wanna wait on that until eith- yeah after the writeup. But also, there is a certain level of "shoulda played around it" going on here where, yeah, of course they buffed or debuffed that unit that was just about to die or kill one of your units.
Should units be allowed to target tiles beyond their move range? There is a "movement buffs" in the ability list.
If you're not up to it in <insert time here> just tell me and I'll get on it myself
I can do it myself, and it doesn't need to be done tonight
You can decline
Writing down the possible options for handling buffs and then listing out their pros and cons
Alright, can I give you a job latooni?
By bringing every buffer down with them, but that ALSO means faster units are worse buff targets
And I'm not sure if a universal "next turn" solution even fixes the problem
I don't know of a good solution here. Intuition says buffs are active as soon as they're applied, and that means every unit gets an equal amount of time using their buff regardless of speed, even if a slower buffer might suffer because of it.
No, but if a buffing unit has low speed they'll have some damn good buffs
The simple answer is we just don't make units that are unplayably bad because they're unable to do the job they specialize in
design philosophy, magic the gathering, etc etc
I also don't think that having bad units is a bad thing
I guess for stuff like defense that's a bit of a consideration
Well no, buff durations only tick when the affected unit is the acting unit
That is what we were going with?
this is where "abilities that are hard to define" comes in
Maybe once in a while we can add "increases speed for the next round" or something similar
Buffs/debuffs being applied at end of round isn't intuitive and is a huge design workaround when the easier path is trashing speed buffs
Alright so speed buffs go with range buffs in the "this is not going to work" pile
<@!102691114762371072> the issue is regenerating turn order mid-round
The idea is to make granular pieces of abilities and just smash them together to make something new each time
I do not expect her to hard code even half of it.
It's mostly the same thing over and over for comprehension's sake. In hindsight I could delete most of it and replace it with "abilities that become more/less effective based on x"
oh so did you
nvm got the comment myself
Can you add the tag? I'm busy adding some stuff to another section
that sounds reasonable
Also the active/inactive tag would be useful anyway when determining acting units
If they turn out to be more confusing than they're worth we can trash the idea of speed buffs.
and that's just one example
I think speed buffs are in general a good thing to have in a game like this as they add a huge dynamic to team building if you stick in a slow unit that is normally too slow to be useful alongside a speed buffing unit that makes the slow unit viable
We could add a special clause JUST for speed buffs but then that means
1) It's unintuitive that an entire class of buffs act differently from all other buffs and
2) It limits design space if we want to make a buff that affects speed and something else at the same time

*Also* not fun to use
I have also used Alice
It was the definition of unfun
https://scratch.mit.edu/ I had to make programs in this
What it's not useful for is *what I was forced to use it for*
That's dishonest Scratch is useful for teaching kids to think like a programmer
Scratch, but useful
I was thinking that but that's a level of polish that you damn well better be paid for.
More precision means less room for error anyway
That honestly sounds amazing and you should tote it around as an "I made this" kinda thing
Alright, that sounds perfect
<@!102691114762371072> by that do you mean just anyone with access to the database can quickly throw together an ability without much coding knowledge?
So maybe not that.
The most ideal solution is to code in a way to let me and Melua handle it within a dev mode but that sounds like a ton of work
Alright. Just trying to make sure that you can deal with "these 5 units are all completely broken and we need 10 completely fresh abilities for them" without everything falling apart.
There is absolutely no way around doing testing and going "well I guess this unit just has to do something else". It's gonna happen so you should make adding abilities as easy on you as you can.
Alright. I ask because we're going to have to do a not insignificant amount of trial and error and we also just have to code up a lot of abilities flat out in the course of the game's lifespan.
<@!102691114762371072> before i get to bed, i just wanna make sure. You'll be making it super easy to add an ability to the game on the fly, yeah? Like "call 5 functions and you're done" easy
most was 9 i think
I think I've used up all my game designing juice for today
I can see you award people in bot testing and I don't think Rakhi wrote that line
is that from WFC's?
Except in this case you can see *exactly* what they have on board
Yes, they do have swipe in hand, what the fuck did you expect?
It's like leaving your board full of minions with 1 health in hearthstone against a druid who used wild growth last turn.
plants can be enabled automatically for the channel
ok this is why I want to use trello for events because then we can plan shit out. How many coins do we want to expect the average user to get from participating?
but I also just wanna take part in the raw chaos that serenacon will hopefully result in
this is also an option
we should maybe use it for more than just the game
hmm... trello seems pretty useful to handle events and stuff
wait we can enable random plants
~~except I can't pick up any that I plant myself~~
I'm changing because I want the sweet kiricoins that we'll be dropping in serenacon
I'll change tomorrow
we want there to be a sea of maria colors
cape is not valid
actually
cape is valid only because i know nothing is going to tear R out of that role willingly
and yeah quinn's handiwork is... well exactly what I'd expect
that was parm i think
we should prep the event beforehand for once

It is not often that I hear people praise visual basic
actually I do not know what the ramen scene in Minneapolis is like
Well I can, Lyssa needs to actually be in New York to have ramen on demand.
I took a 4 hour train to Boston a while back to hang out with people. Someone was going to Japan, it was gonna be a while until we had the chance to see them again, so me and Lyssa just... took a train. To hang out. There was ramen involved but we can get ramen in the city whenever we want.
Like even if you wanted to
also just read up on jacq because of the conversation and ```What I mean is there's really no need for you to drive four hours for ice skating.```do they have no concept of being social
I called Lyssa by her screen name up until we started dating and I was like "it'd be weird to keep using screen names at this point wouldn't it"
I'm down for that after I get back from dinner
they DID just release ignition
Maybe I'll pick up a greatsword for windy fuck you dragon
Tri had the best bowgun system and they need to bring it back
kinda wanna pick up a bowgun but Tri ruined me
while lamenting my lack of other weapons
i will ineffectually swing my hammer at the living tornado then
does this mean that it's time for population control
There's literally no worst case scenario here as far as I can tell
I'm not against this outcome. We're doing it for funsies and as a way to hand out a ton of kiricoins
has rakhi posted 5 fanarts for that 25 we gave her yet?
If a non-staff user spills the secret that's fine but I don't want staff giving it away
And if someone asks how I'll drop hints but be vague
I might do a plant or two if people seem to be having trouble cracking the channel's secerets just to get people to try and figure it out
"dinner"
but anyway I'll throw up a trello for the server after dinner
I'm gonna make an announcement about how "RV follows in the footsteps of XDU, and as such, for Serena's birthday we have decided to host Serenacon, an event for only the most dedicated of Serena fans" and then I'll pop into the channel and say something like "What's your favorite thing about Serena?" and then silence until people start figuring out what's going on
Because Serena wasn't in the game
Where it was just a Maria gacha
anyway we should work on figuring that out and i'll throw up a trello for general server stuff as they pop up? I also want to vaguely reference the first Serenaday XDU had

So I guess it's about ethics in Symphogear servers or something?
I'm trying to think of things we've "bullied" users for in the past and I mean uh... "sexism", "overt usage of slurs", "pedophilia"
there's not much about valk in there
It just seems like we go hard because other servers don't have rules at all.
And yeah, our rules are... ridiculously lax
sianz said nothing else
Yeah, if we're pushing outsiders (read: people who feel the need to spew slurs and bad jokes) away then... good? For each person we convert that's a victory but the goal here isn't being the entire Symphogear community, it's being welcoming to anyone who's fed up with the bullshit that other servers condone.
And the episode with kirika's transformation was still spoiler material
I asked him to change his avatar for a day because we had AXZ spoiler rules in effect
guys our aura is threatening what do we do
no

they can just
but also in any case, I just wanna reach out because being trans is rough and I want them to find a community for it even if it's not our community
that's a perfect area for improvement
he's incredibly cishet white male but I expected to ban him within a week when he showed up
wobbles is actually pretty okay
they reached out to me because they're trans and I'm the only outspoken trans person on valk
LilacStar
I've been planning on speaking to her
The one thing I've been sad about in regards to "outsiders" is that Jasmine doesn't say much here anymore
We have "silenced" wien and rukia in the past but that's because they were breaking rule 1
the only time we do is when they're actually breaking a rule
ever
Like we don't tell jacq or wien to just flat out shut up like
And we like

actually allow diversity in opinions on the server

which is not a common trait because in order to allow diversity you need to take an active role in moderation?
Yeah. Like... stick figures are valid as long as it's like Sparkle's memes. The bar shall not be high.
then it can never be construed as a judgment
It may be worthwhile to make a "you did a thing, you get coins" and have no variables on the reward
If someone is submitting a prompt, give them the 500/600 coins for entering (because that's not a judgment on the fic, that's just a reward for the prompt itself) but if they need a partial reward for not meeting a criteria then ask if they want it or not
also re:coins for oc

Definitely ask going forward, do it on a case by case basis. Don't keep our coin distribution methods secret and this is also why I proposed we do fics at a 1 coin per 10 words basis rather than arbitrary decisions
Krotash also has me whispering in his ear so
Usage of the word in any context normalizes it and leads to it seeping into other situations where you might not necessarily expect it to pop up, and then you find yourself with a community calling actual trans people traps and then eventually you find people with absolutely zero connection to anime communities having it in their head that trans people are trying to trap straight men into gay sex and that leads to trans people being murdered.
<@102691114762371072> thought on Kirika's poison mechanic: a class of identical debuffs that just have different names. Maybe one kiri inflicts "soul reaping", maybe a different one inflicts "flesh rending" but they operate the same. Easy to implement or no?
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
I already know perfection
i did not say good, just acceptable
an acceptable pizza
what are the commands for editing the drops?
even if they don't figure the channel out
yeah definitely give people coins just for being around
...we can adjust it on the fly, right?
that sounds reasonable. We can also adjust it on the fly to throw Elise off.
what should the cooldown be
oh okay then
What are your thoughts on having kiri spawn coins in the serenacon chat 100% of the time but on a cooldown
yes that
<@102691114762371072> can you set a cooldown on kiri's autoplant feature?
People joined when we made them
Hardly anyone new joins the opt in roles we have
yeah
mostly game roles
audit log dont go back that far
and uhhhhhhhh
We'd want a "yes coin" and a "no coin" list so we don't have to keep asking
We purged a bunch of roles a while ago specifically because no one took them
No one takes roles though. That is the entire problem. No one takes roles.
We need to be proactive about giving coins but be careful not to hand coins to people who don't want them even with the flat rate.
Something like rv_coinrequest might solve the issue? And that would just shove a request into some queue  that we could look at freely. But then the issue is people undervaluing their work "oh this doesn't deserve coins" so also no.
dess_timely
If they don't have coins, they won't play with the system
If they don't play with the system, they won't know what it is
People won't take the role if they don't know what it is
I would say word it as neither a bonus nor a penalty. "we will accept prompts that don't meet the requirement, but they will only net you x coins"
unfortunate side effect
I will ask Lucy if that would be a comfortable resolution for them or if they'd still rather not have the coins

dess_$
yeah, rv_pull could add the role too
this is not an issue the way other opt-in roles are because rv_signup is made known to you in the join message
the role could also be an opt-in in case anyone who previously opted out wants to opt back in
if not, add them to a do not call list
If they say yes, award and give them the role
if someone without the role posts something coin worthy, we'll ask them if they want the role
if that were to also assign a role, then we would know who wants coins
if someone does rv_signup then they definitely want coins
My idea was going off of rv_signup
today is maple launch btw

what the fuck even is this server events role
The only opt-in role that gets new members ever is writing prompts, and that's because we ping it in announcements every week
if a role is on someone, anyone can see it
"ask bingo" is not an action I recommend often but he's already done it and I *think* Sakuya is python
Sakuya handles that and he'd probably be willing to throw the code at you if you wanna shove it into Shirabe
i would actually say "ask bingo" on this one
I'd say give Rakhi extra for hosting it but she'll do anything for coins anyway and I'm not sure just how effective making a show of it is
50 per, I suppose. We wanna encourage people to turn up, but we don't want people to just drop in and afk for coins.
Yeah. XDU releases like, 5 cards a month, and only 1-3 of those are special art
How's that look
```It's Serena's birthday! And, more importantly, it's the first character birthday since we've implemented kiricoins on the server! So in celebrating Serena's birthday, we're holding a special event - Serenacon 2018! We welcome all of you to #serenacon-2k18, a channel where kiricoins may be found lying on the floor very often! But don't worry, even if you aren't a true Serena fan, you can still get 200 free coins for reacting to Kirichan's message below!```
That's a good idea
I guess mine. I should write up an announcement.

if the channel becomes active, picking is free game for all of us with the color
@everyone Okay, so, informal rules for serenacon: until a normal user does a pick for the first time, we should not pick ever and just let it pile up over time.

Even though everyone on staff can post there (I think) try and keep it to maria colors only unless action needs to be taken. No, cape does not count.

But yes, in order to properly maintain and enforce the "no harassment" bit of rule 1, any communication that spawns from the server, whether it's related to the server or not, should be considered under our jurisdiction should the details of that communication come forth. For a more obvious example of why that's important, if someone on the server mentions they're underage, and a pedophile starts chatting them up due to that knowledge, we need room to remove the pedophile.
but to my understanding, their group DM invite sprouted from a conversation that took place in the server
they met you through this server and primarily interact with you through this server. I would classify any interactions as being server related because there is no other vector of communication to go through, even if it's a DM unrelated to server matters. If they are discussing something that originally came up within a DM and was only kept to DMs, that'd be a different story.
there's a bunch of old links on new.reddit
we've pruned all invite links except for the subreddit one at this point

I won't answer that question, but I will mention that there is a scat ouroboros.
I don't think Euphoria is necessarily the best at what it does but it's about the only thing willing to do what it does.
<@456226577798135808> I'm talking about shit like Euphoria. That goes WAY past rape and it's not exactly everyone's cup of tea.
I've never actually read Berserk though.
Berserk tries and sometimes it trips but there's a lot to be said for the fact that it tries
It would have to be incredibly uncomfortable to consume.
And you're also not gonna have a huge audience purely from how horrendous that work would be.
Yeah, rape as a storytelling device should be reserved for situations where you focus on the victims or when you REALLY need to hammer in a point. And if you're hammering in a point you're gonna have a lot more than just rape in that work.
which would have been a fine arena to talk about it if rape wasn't part of the discussion

yeah that's why serious-discussion won't be edited

don't rename emoji, some of them would end up being the same after that
serious-discussion goes untouched

rename every channel to hibiki- whartever the channel is

I was thinking something like that
oh, what should we do for miku's birthday?
I just wanna point out

[Rukia voice] It's so hard to talk here without offending someone
[Everyone else] *doesn't say inflammatory shit every time they speak*
Of course it's eternal
Skeletons and ghosts
Because
Fucking. The channel name for this is #eternal-battleground
Ideally we have to announce this today so people don't get confused tomorrow
Anyway, a narrated event for a turf war sounds fun. That requires a narrator though. R is the best fit but if anyone else wants to step up that's cool too.
Spiritooni
Does skeletooni fly or is that part of your actual name
Skelua
Or skeletooni your pick
Skelatooni
But also
Absolutely, mods are users too
We can do some kind of event for it like mafia. Not exactly like mafia but something narrated
<@456226577798135808> can you commit to this
A skeleton army is cool and all but what if we had skeleton armies AND ghost armies fighting a turf war
`faction war`
This gives me an idea
Which actually
Bone names are cool and we can even hand out relevant names ourselves if they don't feel inspired but still want to take part.
I don't like the idea of making people change avatars partially because that seems just a bit above the point of "too much effort" but also changing avatars applies to EVERY server, not just us.
So, Melua is against it. R is for it. I personally am on the fence but I lean more to the side of yes. Kriisa seems for it? I wanna know what <@290431224596660224> thinks and maybe a bit more of Kriisa's thoughts if she's feeling up to it. We've got a week.
I am comfortable slapping down a link and saying "hey we're not really affiliated with these guys"
I don't think it'll play out exactly as you say R, but also I don't think yttt is what you think it is. Their internal channels are pretty tame, they mostly just talk about translating. Since it's a TL group.
I'm with Melua on that but also? yttt isn't big and the few users here who DO join them can very effectively fight back against any 4chan culture carried over.
thoughts on us making this announcement? Especially yours, <@456226577798135808>
alright ill hop on and `resume the grind`
Cusp on the wizard will probably take less time than Tris on my main
which do you wanna do first? Tris or Cusp?
okay my wizard should hit that quickly
I think I'm close
what level is cusp?
Or I'll just do it on my wizard once I reach it
Once I've capped (3 more this week)
Kriisa VC with me so I don't have to feel lonely while running Tris with randos. Alternatively run Tris with me.

Also I already sent this to Latooni but I believe everyone needs to see it
I believe in you R
We might have time
Or, if we take into account what scrmz just said in a public voice channel next to luci who shouldn't be hearing our event planning
I don't think we'll have enough time for the halloween announcement
<@456226577798135808> did you ever finish the cah set?
Alright
<@102691114762371072> would it be bad if I were to mention that we'd be adding a gacha in the Halloween announcement?
Just fiddling with ratios
There's also some refining of the system itself I wanna talk about but that can wait until me and Kriisa are both home. To my understanding it wouldn't be anything that needs a rewrite.
But that will take time
I kinda wanna update the rv buckets since we have Halloween gears now
Make sure we know how much to give
I also wanna refine the coin list
We haven't told anyone so it should be fine
Yeah wait till after Halloween now
Today? I didn't know it was today.
And then I'll host stuff tomorrow
Tell me when you finish it so I can make an announcement
That's a safe option
Is cah ready?
And I'll be out for a bit myself
Plus it's a holiday.
Yeah
Although it's fun and I'm willing to host that as a separate event
There's also channel A but channel a rounds take a while
Each point you get is a point for your team
We can also do symphogear cah if it's ready
Points convert to kiricoins at the end

We could do something like a hunger games simulator
And living every day and showing people that you can have fun while being trans
They're tangible
But they're there
Change comes at a price. And its benefits are not immediately visible.
Because we're at the divide. We are the ones in charge of changing the world.
Because only I get to define what is good in my own context
the knowledge that even when I'm stuck, I can live a good life
that is what keeps me alive a lot of the time
I think
My advice is that if everything sucks, either do something about it or accept that you can't do anything and make the most out of what you have.
And it's changing fast.
We may not be the ones who benefit, but we are leaving our legacy behind to create a better world.
I've seen, experienced living proof that it counts
that counts
everything you do to build a better tomorrow
and this is big
But
And honestly it might suck your entire life
You're a good person R
I much prefer that. If there's nothing to be done, have all the fun you can until there is something to be done.
I don't like the depressing interpretation of nihilism. Sure, it fits, but the original idea was "everything is fucked so lets have a party while we can"
No questions, no invasiveness, just understanding.
They just accepted us for who we said we were.
We were 4 trans girls, only two of us got misgendered and after being corrected they didn't slip up a single time. The world IS changing.
I played some games with a bunch of high schoolers at AUSA. Kids these days really do see things in a different light.
underprivileged groups know things that privileged groups do not and privileged groups do not like being told that their knowledge is incomplete and therefore reject the notion that their knowledge is incomplete and in the process reject the reasons that others have more complete knowledge than they do
but also because the minority experience the world outside of the bubble of privilege

also scapegoats
because we exist in contrast to everything they learned as a kid and growing up is scary
hate us cause they aint us 😎
because they are both female and game journalists, gotta make sure they aren't insulting because they're actually bad at their job
insulting female game journalists: ✅
Like I said. It's okay to break down. It's okay to not be able to fight, because others will pick up the torch.
And you only need to fight as much as you're willing to fight.
The change is there. It's happening. I've seen it.
But at the end of the day, your existence alone means something.
And sometimes it's okay to never piece yourself back together
And sometimes it's okay to break down
And sometimes it's hard
It sucks to be the first. And we are the first. We are the ones paving the path to a better future. It'll be hard but, I think it'll be worth it.
At this point, I'm ready for a civil war.
Stonewall happened in an instant. Its effects were far reaching and permanent. I believe in the good of humanity. I don't believe voting will fix everything, but it'll slow down the hate machine.
One that I believe will spring people to action
Trump is a set back, but he's an alarming set back.
I believe that we will have good change in the future.
If there's one thing you'll never shake from me it is my sickening and unrelenting optimism. I've called myself insane over it in the past.
I don't think the regulations will pass.
But I know I want to help build it
I don't know if we get to experience that future
And that future is looking good from my perspective
There is a future
But.
It hurts. It sucks. It's tiring. And you don't have to fight 24/7
That's what I do. That's my contribution.
is it Sakimori
It's rough
My brother is the only reason I still have my name
narcissism, sounds like
R, what is the intended takeaway from your story?
they do the exact same thing but are applied in different ways
Part of the issue was me being dumb and confusing the lubelisk debuffs with the tris debuffs
I also did a lube run but I'm not confident in my ability to explain that one fully
I looked up some videos and did some practice runs and I think I can confidently guide people through Tris now in case anyone wants to give it another try tomorrow. I've also discovered that WOW ENCHANTING EATS A LOT OF WEAPONS so yeah I'd also do FD if people don't wanna do Tris.

We can remove people's ability to see it but I don't want to delete anything.
And regardless, I don't want to delete channels unless there's a good reason to delete them. Clutter isn't a reason when you can just collapse the entire category.
Why exactly are you bringing handholding up *now*?
Easily accessible logs for everyone who is not you
That category is at the bottom for a reason. You can just collapse/mute it.
I mean at this point it's probably fine if we removed it from public channels but I don't wanna delete channels when archiving them serves the same purpose
Because I threw it up on a whim when someone made a lewd handholding joke and then a bunch of people went and actually used it to dump images
Oh, the description for handholding is a joke.
delete?
yes

We don't want to give every single person who hosts a rewatch channel editing perms.
but automation can come online quickly
yeah. A bunch of sieving at the start.
Agrarian Skies can be pretty complex. Early game sucks but past that it's great and I find most computers can run it smoothly.
Not having a world does wonders for performance
Agrarian Skies might actually run better, actually
maybe it was taken down
i cant seem to locate technofirma
oh it's technofirma that i was interested in
oh, then punk might be the one i was thinking of
i know there's another good pack with tfc
lemme check my desktop then
I think the other good TFC pack is age of engineering?
yeah if he does it again we should probably warn
It's hard to hold stuff against him
The issues are so small and spaced out though
Yeah that was a thing
I do not remember talking to him about using the word in ableist ways in the plast

<@!102691114762371072> did i just break the subreddit feed?
it might but a broken sub feed for one or two days won't hurt much
I'll start renaming stuff
yes, 4chan itself is also a nazri breeding ground
that's not exactly a secret
And I haven't exactly kept up with all the weev news
There wasn't a neonazi problem when I first learned about the dude
why am i unsurprised to learn that weev is a nazi
Because ONE of the people who accused him admitted she lied. Not all of the accusers, just one.
Oh, the trigger on that one was a claim that Kavanaugh isn't a rapist
```louisToday at 10:52 AM
dems went insane after their golden goose almost lost to an old commie and then actually lost to Donald Trump```🤔
yeah, it looks to me like there are clusters
it's not a complete 1:1, but a lot of the layout sticks
in maplestory, the pvp areas are just dark versions of the real world
<@!99695384296701952> so, more than just shadow maps mimicking the maple world, it seems they're clustered together the same way they are in the maple world
Kirika has pumpkin motifs in her attacks
Thanksgiving is an American thing so there aren't any cards for that
Well we can tie it in
I'd like to point out it's been a while since we've updated card pools and we have Christmas versions of each girl except Serena
wizard dash can also be used three times in a row and also does not care about height or require you to wedge it in to your dps rotation
the dash sucks compared to wizard
i will try assassin a bit more but
But I might be wrong
Rather than there being multiple actual sets
I read set as class
The wording is ambiguous
I do not recall them saying that.
Each raid will give different pieces of the set.
There is only one legendary set coming tomorrow
Oh and 900 health
https://www.reddit.com/r/MapleStory2/comments/9v3hbl/new_legendary_set_effect_is_bis/?utm_source=reddit-android
Well that's one way to make legendary armor good. The set effect gives you 20 extra spirit and 500 extra attack at 5 pieces equipped
2 hours
I have a psychiatrist appointment and then 2 hours after that I have waxing and I just wanna fish
Today is going to be the worst since I am a moron and schedule things poorly
cdev seems to have a lot of things going on at once...
But the narrative we've been given up until this point is that the land of darkness was shut away for a good while before Turka came along and broke the seal
Ludification doesn't seem to be related to the Black Mage so the corruption of the land of darkness could also just be a Thing That Happened
Probably the Black Mage's doing? But maybe not.
And then the Black Mage and his group just set up shop
I think the shadow realm might've been a mirror of maple world, given the intro mentioning the two goddesses
Blackout Expanse should be a mirror of Mounthill. Same world map art, but darker.
especially since in Kabrium Basin, there's an altar that mentions Turka
in what they do with the story
interested
I am
Like the goldus cluster is all next to each other, but then when you get to where the shadow gate should be, it changes

I hope I can still get pizza after I get waxed
The screenshot in that post shows extreme armor while the one in the Reddit thread is panic
Oh there'll be multiple sets
I wanna know if raids use up dungeon runs
<@!102691114762371072> You may be pleased to know that Heavy Gunners are almost required in CDev
i dreamt that everyone left me and i was all alone
that was the worst nightmare
eugh
have fun
But again, actual song > transcribed score > midi > mml gives you a lot of room for losing information in the music
Yeah that was the main issue I had with it is that until the vocals kick in I didn't actually recognize the song
there's always going to be the limitation of using midis
harsh is good. I don't want you to overwork yourself though
go for it
second guitar line is also a bit relaxed but that is automatically solved by the electric guitar in game
yeah that sounds right. Trumpet or trombone.
or trumpet
a guitar or bass might actually fit there in game
I think the sax is a bit too... relaxed? Like it's emulating the vocal track and Chris basically yelling in the song.
the instruments could also just be midi fuckery and the song just doesn't pack the same punch it does normally without actual instruments
Alright, I gotta mention that while the actual notes are good, the instrumentation in the mscz sounds a bit off and the tempo might be a bit slower than it should be in some places. One of these is an issue that can be easily dealt with  on my end, the other I can probably point out any tempo issues better once I actually turn it into a midi, assuming they exist at all and it's not just a result of the instruments.
allow me to wrench myself out of bed over the next few hours and verify this statement
ill give it a listen
You did everything right, R
We don't need to be obscene to upset conservatives, we just have to portray happy trans people
I'm gonna make a game for conservatives to get upset over. Not because of free speech, I just think they deserve to be upset.
I couldn't get through that wall of text what the shit is the creator saying
this score is great
talking to people in alkimi when...
just making the intro a bit more aggressive sounding should be fine but i might be able to handle that entirely on my end
https://musescore.com/user/28729133/scores/5303534 this one
lemme find it again
the second score you linked me was pretty good
i hope they just make it easier to gear up
they wont be nerfing the raids, which is good, i like the raid itself
they're not just letting it rot and then slapping p2w in the shop
they are actually doing things
also, https://twitter.com/JungsooLee7/status/1062202623338508288?s=19
yeah
i would avoid trying to use specific maple instruments like the timpani and just shoot for an overall good score and convert it afterwards
the instruments sound kinda wonky? i have no idea
did you redo this with maple soundfonts?
you can't do anything fancy but you can replicate hitting a cymbal and then holding it afterwards so that it only makes the initial crashing noise
yeah, short and high pitched
you can actually replicate cymbals to an extent using timpani
however
i would do the announcement part
ok can you do that and also make a short announcement explaining what has happened and why
also how much effort is it to move kirichan's music commands to <#336298587745157120> instead of <#447132690349555712> <@!102691114762371072>
and mostly did it when other people werent doing something else there
but thats why i did it in shitposting
that was definitely spam
my pokemon playthroughs
like
It's definitely spam, but <#407060923078017026> is where spam goes as long as it's not choking out something else being done there
i'd rather it there than fancontent
image spam is fine in <#407060923078017026>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiSg6lwIItU


<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
It's fun but it's a lot more fun with friends
Anyway, I could definitely play both at once, but I won't drop sub money on it unless everyone is on board
I enjoy FFXIV
So I'd probably set aside dungeon time for playing with yall
Raids and dungeons have different caps and there's still reason to run dungeons even after you get your raid ready gear
But like... make peachy useful? Give us permanent double drop?
Lube is fine. I'd run lube way more if they made that change
But I hate running Tris as a priest
Yeah sure I can run Tris instead
Being able to use any weapon type for enchantments is not enough and if that's all they do then like
But they're doing SOMETHING and I hope it is the right something
They've already said that cdev won't be nerfed which is, yeah, I like hard content
Lower peachy costs, give us more onyx, something that lets me make meaningful progress
I just want them to lower the bullshit
Yeah I actually do not want the limit to go away
Except find a static
I find myself with several hours a day where I just don't have anything to do in Maple
Gathering is a time sink
Also once I max gathering in Maple I can possibly go hard in two mmos at once
Yeah
I have hope for Maple? And even if it keeps being bullshit I'll probably still play for a while
I need to get my value out of having not only the pumpkin witch outfit but I get to play with my name as Alice
Also sunk cost fallacy
I would play but I don't wanna balance it with Maple and while the current state of maple is bullshit I'm waiting on the next producer blog to see if I wanna keep going hard at it
I mean I do have a balmung character too
Gilgamesh?
What's the high population one that isn't balmung
My main is on uhhhh
It is
I also have a character there
And an inactive account
I'm on ultros! With an alt.
with a full disclaimer that anything posted there isn't necessarily vetted by us
a self-promotion channel might be useful, for any self-promotional content
dess_remind me 90m charge your phone for therapy
What is the remind command again <@102691114762371072>
Oh, yeah. Melua would probably love the glamors
And they don't prevent you from playing more if you want to
I just wanna knock out gathering mastery before I start up in FFXIV again
It does. They're actually designed well.
But yeah I'll play xiv if everyone else does. Other than that, more Maple
The $15 option is for people who want to RP on balmung
$13 a month. One character is all you need for every class
All of my characters are just Yuri Girl
Army
You can meet my any of Yuri Girl
My ultros alt is like level 15
Tank preference
I tank and heal too
I just mentioned that I have like 5 alts a while ago
yeah it's a bit of an uncanny valley thing
Her avatar?
but maybe the worst timing we've seen so far
```from: solopy567#7202 in: fancontent ship yourself```
for context, search ```from: Yuri Girl#0483 in: fancontent what we had earlier was not fine```on this server and scroll back to read logs there <@!99695384296701952> <@!102691114762371072>

lemme ask
i have no idea
and i dont wanna just abandon that because it'll let me use a +4 acc top instead of a +5
we've been looking toward it for far too long
i definitely wanna get the guild house to rank 2 first
the most important thing here is the accuracy buff. crit and piercing buffs are also nice.
I am talking about the personal buffs. One time cost to upgrade them using 20m guild funds, but past that it's just a meso cost to activate them for yourself
and i just kinda wanna talk about how we feel with delaying higher level guild houses in favor of raiding
basically i wanna talk about what we're doing with guild funds. I don't wanna stop the roll toward a guild house but as I start getting geared up for raids and stuff and hopefully with other people following me, there are some other things that are really nice that require guild funds
when can we hold council
oh
we must hold `council`
<@&505236272239869952> alright
hi not dead im alice
the computer *tried* to fade out
the computer did it better
immediately
after backing out of bisa's version like
ok i just listened to the auto-generated thing from yesterday
<@456226577798135808> its been 13 days since the first weekly newsletter in maplestory
what is this about netflix licensing symphogear?
as im sure youve noticed
most omocat designs are good
https://www.omocat-shop.com/collections/sweaters-1/products/meltygirl-black-sweater?variant=1141701000 melty girl
i found the design as a sweater but i dont wear sweaters
FUCK
ITS NOT ONLINE
thanks hum- MELTY GIRL SHIRT
oh good im not missing out on much stormblood is still $20 anyway
the fuck
what

there is zero room for invalid inputs because IT'S ALL DROPDOWNS
nor does it want 93/10/25
no
apparently the birthday i put in - the valid birthday of 10/25/93 - is not valid
this is like the third time its happened
fuck it, zero interest in playing now
once again, i cannot log into my sqex account
or was it just announced
isnt there another expansion coming up?
doesnt change what melua said
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it doesn't, but what you said showcases thinking that i want to be encouraged in decisions
useful
```For the record we're not shadowbanning
It's not and never will be a punishment while I'm here because it's abusive without being corrective```
dont believe i am
And you especially have useful ideas on that
I want us all to be present since we also need to discuss "how do we handle people like yorin"
Can we schedule that conversation because we also need a rules overhaul
I might end up speedrunning it but just heads up that progress will be made
<@99695384296701952> <@!102691114762371072> I am going to run through Diablo a bit by myself in my quest to fix my eternally bugged sleep cycle again
i should also shave first since ill have to leave tomorrow morning for thanksgiving stuff
once i eat we can play diablo
we might have to do it on a weekend next week
new expansion not out yet
but its only turn 4 and i dont have a coin
ill abduct my brother and make him cook for us
what if we had a thanksgiving thing for the server next year or something
oh
from what?
like a normal person
not being able to eat with everyone else on thanksgiving
love just
ok
I just started, it won't take long to catch you up at all
I'm enjoying it
<@290431224596660224> Diablo seems to be the game when we're not playing Maple
lulu bus
<@!102691114762371072> do you wanna play diablo now or keep going with overwatch?
the trashmouse lies dormant within you
yes
Melua is like a near blind person getting eye surgery and then being astounded by colors
brb
so
anyway yeah im gonna go shave and then enjoy Melua sitting in wonder of seeing games played at higher than low quality settings
and i can talk for most of it
and then diablo i guess? all that should take maybe an hour.
gotta uhhhhhhhhh dilate
ideally shower but hahahaha i take forever so no
need to shave
i uhhhhhhh
had to figure out what stays and what goes
since im moving in a few weeks
i was discussing apartment stuff
hi
nope
wait i just got notifications maybe i can get a password reset
song i guess
but i can listen
because saliva fucks the weed up
i cant talk right now
do we vc anywhere
im gonna go hope that there's enough oil left brb
the reset button is broken
<@!102691114762371072> do you wanna play overwatch while i slowly lose my grip on reality?
do the thing
im just gonna go
ah, yes, not being able to sign in and order more of the medicine that stops me from falling into a depressive spiral is absolutely the best time to need that medicine
no
im trying to buy more weed but i cant remember my weed password
sorry
You should meet my grandma. What you said was neither supportive nor constructive and came off as more than a bit incendiary. Rakhi may not understand how social situations work, but a response like that isn't going anywhere. Especially the "wait for them to die" bit, that's extra not cool.
also uhhhh ```Sakim♀ri, of the Kiri varietyToday at 2:39 PM
okay, support your cousin by telling them that this is hopeless and you're better off just waiting for them to die```can we not?

no memes, shitposts only
@everyone
Yeah, no rules could possibly apply other than "let others talk"
By the time we would have been able to tell him to fuck off the game session was already spoiled
Rimura

some guy came in and started tryharding and dominating the chat while we were just trying to play casually so we could have fun
I added a new voice channel for mod-like things in case we ever actually need voice chat for that. Right now that consists almost entirely of complaining about users with no self-awareness wandering in and making it a bad time but it might become useful some day so The Bridge has been added.

just. take the good parts of those. and get a job in the process.
Well reddit is slowly driving a sword through its skull, twitter has been bleeding out slowly for at least a year, and tumblr just took a shotgun to its face
it's money. Ideally.
it sure does but it also *is* work
like fucking
shit, what if?
like
like yes that is a lofty aspiration but
what about just... making a social media platform that doesn't ban sex
and no one else
but that means the art would reach... symphogear fans
"hosting symphogear art" is a thing <@456226577798135808>
so
okay
Fucking hate how people interpret nihilism as inherently pessimistic when the literal source of the idea is Nietzsche basically saying "party like there's no tomorrow because there very well might not be"
Is it time for me to bring out the positivity nihilism
Bam
I think it's time for a name change
Think about the gamers
```The reason people thinks its loud is because its infecting stuff like gaming```
Time to read some shit I guess
I should probably make the announcement since I'm actually Jewish
i dunno that's probably good
what do we want to say
melua brought up making an announcement for it
tonight is the first night of Hanukkah apparently
*SLAMS HANDS ON TABLE*
isnt he scottish?
Not sure how comfortable I'd be with that. The user in question *is* a known shitbag.
And then everyone (except solo) dogpiles yorin to tell him he's being that guy
Yorin with the hot takes in serious discussion
```Yuri GirlToday at 3:07 PM
Hmm. Thinking about prompts. Ideas.
We give the writing cabal a special secret channel (no role, just added manually) and they can come up with prompts while we just vet their ideas of being usable or if we need a different one.
Less work for us. They get what they want. We can always stick our own prompts in if we feel the need to.
And we get to oversee more of their actions and hushed complaints that they never bring up.```
it's time for me to bring this up here
ok so now that im home
If we removed spoiler channels, I would definitely enforce stricter spoiler rules on new seasons specifically
so after the last episode it was one week of AXZ chat only, then one week of Symphogear chat only, then the entire season became fair game wherever they wanted (bar major spoilers)
two weeks after the last episode the restrictions were removed entirely
BUT nowhere else. It still had to be contained to the symphogear category
After that week, it was free discussion in <#336310266654490624>
Well what we did for AXZ was that for each episode, there was a one week grace period where ANY information (including images and sounds) from that episode had to go into the AXZ channel. If it was from the raw and people watched before the sub, it went into the raw AXZ channel.
just invisible to non-custodians
already have two set up for XV
we got that one person who was on GX yesterday or something but they're pretty rare
this would require us to get a more steady stream of people who haven't already watched the whole thing
```Honestly symphogear is a difficult show to handle spoiler wise```I've been thinking of removing spoiler channels entirely and making the whole server a Symphogear spoiler zone.
in any case if we do become the uh... `haven for people being displaced who like symphogear` we would ideally want to be able to be discovered by people who do not already like symphogear.
probably
oh well, it was an idea
it is, but that doesn't mean impossible, it just means you need a team that wants to commit to it
okay, but new forms of social media are still constantly being created. Yes, mastodon is hot garbage, but it exists. If our primary goal is "a place where people can share original content" we don't even need to make our goal "everyone jumps ship and comes to us", we just need the people making the content.
i have seen their faces, represented by lego murals
i know for a fact that google was literally two nerds in a garage

just make sure there's an announcement with dumb puns explaining the change

dess_warnlog
have we done anything about Millhi's slur usage yet
oh
who and where
not a good time for me to be chasing people
but does not draw attention from outside the server
announcements is a pseudoping to begin with since people generally look at it if it lights up
Kriisa I think you are being - while understandably so - excessively negative
i think it's warranted
we're doing coins
yes
ok post a festive thing in announcements
R, give me a festive thing to put in announcements
ok that works
and if not, I guess kriisa has to do it herself since im not finding an end event command
and see if it works
I will try deleting the message
<@!102691114762371072> how do I cancel R's event
<@!102691114762371072> SANTA COME BACK
250 because dec 25
i would totally get a pillow that says it's pot o clock
You can pick a different thing and we can come back to that later.
Do you still want me to say shit, Kriisa? Because that is very much what I am going to say.
I'll wait on Melua to finish typing and then respond.
Gimme a bit to scroll up through DMs. <@!99695384296701952> this is your chance to shut me up.
Alright.
Then I'll push forward and you tell me if I should keep going.

`demands the spotlight be on her 24/7`

This is primarily stuff I've had relayed through Melua. It involves a lot of things that I don't think Melua would be comfortable with me sharing myself. Should I continue?
Because Melua asked us to
Can we take those 45 minutes?
Pick a starting point.
I can talk about everything if you want.
The issues were small, usually relayed through Melua, and built up slowly.
I can wait.
If you can get tilted, I can too

Let me post a bit above that.
I'd like to talk about it more, but R has gone silent.
There's your reason.
This spawned out of me venting about you yelling at me for playing Junkrat.
hover over the message, click the three dots, reactions
go for it
That works
<@456226577798135808>
I will handle the event command
Do it however you want, R
For coins I think drawing that attention may be beneficial
As for the perfect and can never do anything wrong... that's a mixture of "Stuff Melua vented at me" as well as a few observations of my own. One of the more recent things is uh. Today. With the whole Junkrat thing.
Oh I can imagine.
Like I said, discussion was *going* to happen, the major point of friction at the moment is R showing you more than you really needed to see. The full transcript did not need to be sent in order to resolve all of the issues that turned out to be actual issues. A lot of it was "Alice is upset and just slinging shit" stuff.
1) Alright.
2) Okay, but he'll have to earn a place back in staff. I do have my hesitations about him concerning how he went off both in valk and on val's server.
3) Yeah.
Sorry on most of it.
Sorry on that one.
Because I was upset, venting, and R is not the best social conductor.
A lot of that falls well into the "months ago" side of things and also a lot of it is DMs with Melua that, if you'd let it be, she will have to post herself.
The empathy is there, but it could also be more there.
<@!99695384296701952> Yeah probably. I would like to point out that I DID abandon the concept of speaking to LeeUh after the fact, but no you're right, it shouldn't have crossed my mind at all.

<@!102691114762371072> Honestly that's a difficult question for me. I don't think *anyone* lacks empathy, and on those lines you totally can show empathy. That being said, even during that week straight of me being anxious over the idea of maybe needing a surgical revision, you slipped into "it's me time now" on some pretty questionable occasions. You've shown a good deal more empathy than a lot of people I've run into but at the same time you still have moments where you come off as a bit self-centered. That's not to say you've consistently been the same level of bad about it. It's not as common as it was a few months ago, but even if you've traveled quite a way you do still have some work to do in that arena, in my opinion.
Right now or prior to this whole thing going on right now? Because prior to this, yeah. Right now, hopefully.
And go for it.
Because even if R flipped out over it, I realized I was holding a lot of shit in and probably should have talked about it.
And honestly I would have brought everything up then and there.
I would have talked to you regardless after R prodded me on about shit while I was venting. Unfortunately things got escalated and now we're here.
So with that out there, can we please use the remaining time to just air ourselves out while waiting for Melua to come back?
Well this is a perfect example of why I would prefer to talk about things right now instead of just attacking each other. When the staff channel was created, you mentioned you'd be fine if we used a different server. At the time, there was a very valid reason for you to not know that the different server existed. After that reason had mostly expired, it was stuck in my head that you didn't want us using other channels for comms, rather than "you can use other channels, just not this one on the server"
But you'll have to wait on Melua for that reason if you want it.
No, and there's an (admittedly outdated) reason why.
My own personal server.
We *have* another server.
When I made the staff channel here you very directly objected to using it for anything other than discussing staff issues.
Yes, that was venting.
I'd prefer to destroy only one relationship, zero would be even better.
Just let Melua get off work.
If you understand venting understand that.
You are now fully within the realm of "me saying shit because I was attacked rather than talked to while venting".
Alright.
I was looking for reassurance that you are not that person.
Again, it wasn't supposed to reach you and it was right after you telling me off for only playing Junkrat and I was just a bit upset. Much as Melua has said some shit to me while venting, I said some shit to R. He just decided to bring it to you.
Okay. And I'd like to say sorry for what you have seen, I was venting and honestly I was not looking to attack you or sow seeds of distrust, I was looking for reassurance.
But if you want to leave I won't hold you.
These are, again, not huge issues in and of themselves. They are things, some viewed directly by me, some viewed through the eyes of others, that have unsettled me when taken in full. Some of this may be shaped by depression venting as Melua pointed out and honestly I'd love to clear those up.
There's not a good solution here.
...and then I'd have to navigate around you in order to hang out with people?
I said that quite some time ago. Regardless, if I don't have to worry about this server losing all of its channels or emoji then I'm fine. But uh. I'm not sure how much I should go ahead and not worry about that. Because until a short while ago it was looking like I'd have *my* friends ripped out from under me because everyone would just keep using the channel they've been using.
I don't want a divisive friend situation to cause a divisive staff situation, or vice versa
But anyway, yeah "as long as the friend circle is mostly staff please let the owner of the server that staff sits on be the owner of the hanging out channel"
I wanna keep Illuminati/Alchemist in case we need janitor type mods.
I've also been thinking of getting rid of the custodian distinction- yeah
I will promote Melua once we're done with this because uh. We have an announcement to write.
Ok.
Yes.
I agree with that one.
No, it's "as long as the friend circle is mostly staff please let the owner of the server that staff sits on be the owner of the hanging out channel"
The most prevailing issue is that if you DID leave today then people would have to choose sides. If I'm the owner people can choose to leave of their own accord rather than shutting off one half of the friend circle or the other.
That's true, and honestly I'd rather keep it that way because she is a wonderful source of venting when none of you are good options, but the point holds that some of us will have friends that other people here won't like.
But also, even making it an "our friends" channel isn't a complete solution. Xam is my friend, but I don't think you two would mix very well.
That doesn't mean we can't have a VIP channel or something where the list is manually curated.
You've even acknowledged Lyssa as being fine, just "not friends enough"
And, as I just said, that hits close to home personally when Lyssa doesn't get to join in.
Alright, as to stuff about LeeUh: I've already admitted as much fault as I think there is to admit there, but a lot of the "I wanna make my own decision" stuff is stuff that ties back into where exactly we hang out (this channel is a Kriisa's friends channel, no your girlfriend doesn't get a pass, etc). By using that channel instead of cultivating the ones here you *were* excluding people which is... exactly what LeeUh said you were doing. The fact that I was complicit doesn't really make it better, it just means two of us were willing to do dirty shit.
There's also that one time you really aggressively told me to make <#419319372797050880> private. I don't know what was up with that.
That also feeds heavily into the "Everything we do is in Kriisa's spaces" thing which is, again, "Everyone does what Kriisa wants us to do". I am aware of the "don't do it in other channels/don't do it in this particular server" mixup but only because we literally just spoke about it.
Well we're talking about it now, I guess. Minecraft, too. Same reason I never booted up Ferret Business or Age of Engineering a second time.
There's another thing, which is, "Kriisa does what Kriisa wants". I fell off MH HARD because of your obsession with getting different weapons. It was never a "let's do what Alice wants this time" day.
In regards to all this right now, at the very least.
Me not being the only one does not alter the situation, although Kriisa specifically looking for a reason not to do it does and it would have been nice to know that was the case.
There was also "use kiri to delete val's server entirely" which I did slow you down on.
Not an example I personally have a problem with, but the first that comes to mind.
Such as stealing a car to get away from a bad home situation.
The line about you being perfect was uttered a while ago. I'm giving you my reasoning then. If you want a more permanent example, there has been an issue in which you hold people to your own standards (don't lie, don't cheat, etc) but then when you need to do something that might break someone else's moral code you're justified.
"It's okay if I lock into Ashe because I'm better than everyone else but Alice doing the same is unreasonable even if she can legitimately only play a few heroes."
So if Kriisa had left yesterday, she would still be trustable to control the bots?
Certain leave reasons?
It's about the bots. The bots which have powers on par with a staff position.
This honestly isn't even exactly about you.
This is not about R.
Alright. Then do you trust others to act in staff positions even if they do not *have* a staff position?
Alright. I'll take that.
Following *that*, if for whatever reason someone loses a staff role - whether it be due to a removal from staff or whether they just leave - then logically I can no longer entrust them with anything they have the staff role for, correct?
Okay. So lets follow that line logically. If I give someone a staff role, then I am entrusting them with the capability to do *something* in their position. Not trusting, entrusting. They have my faith that they will act in the interest of the server.
Trust. It's a thing. I don't do it. Can we accept this? That I am inherently not a trusting person?
Which, hey! Let's talk about that.
That was spoken from a place of desiring consistency and your objections yesterday were clear and make sense. I was agreeing with continuing to use your spaces before I started having a breakdown which ended with 2 AM phone calls to three different people, at least an hour of me doing nothing but crying on the phone with Lyssa, and continued suicidal ideation this morning.
Is that much clear and agreeable?
Alright. I would like to start with a statement on server hierarchies as that should be the simplest thing to go over. In the past, the only difference between ranks was that custodians were trusted with looking over other mod roles in addition to everything else. That distinction is being removed and nothing else is changing. Everyone still gets a say, and there is still effectively no owner.
scrmz can participate, but is not integral to the current issue in my opinion. If we have to we can pause the discussion for him.
<@!99695384296701952>
Melua must be present and willing as well.
I would also like to have a discussion concerning bots, trust, and server hierarchies at the earliest convenience.
I will make a statement if I have to.
Leave them up for now. I'd like a list of which settings on Kiri aren't set to default, as well as which websites Shirabe checks for sourcing. A list of what custom commands Kiri has would be nice as well.
gonna go cry
I'm
Yes.
I'm putting it up front and in big bold letters right now. Trusting isn't a thing I do.
You asked me to talk, Kriisa. I'm talking. Would you prefer I lied about this?
I trust you more than Kriisa but you're still not Lyssa.
Gimme more than a day to sit on that one.
That's not necessarily a "I would say these exact words back to you" thing. Regardless I don't really trust people completely to begin with. Lyssa's the only one. That's just a me thing. I can trust one person more than other people but I'm still incredibly reserved.
You can give me as many words as you want but ```1) Alice, I considered you one of my closest friends. You're still a friend, but I feel absolutely betrayed and I don't know how much I can trust you right now. I'm sorry.```goes both ways.
How about this. We keep using your server. Everyone who's staff here gets access to up and make a new channel on your server if they need to. You throw source code at me for the bots here just in case because seeing what you did with val's server I wouldn't *want* to rely on bots under your control if you skipped town.
dess_removewarn <@!102691114762371072> 1
dess_warnlog <@!102691114762371072>
dess_warnlog
But fine.
I warned you only after you pretty much said "Then do it". You cannot make a "But I didn't mean it like that!" argument.
You told me to warn you.
And a fourth, and a fifth.
I pinged a third party.
```Issues with @Staff should be taken up privately with a Custodian.```I'm taking it up here and now.
Kriisa has earned herself a warning and a warning only, further action will be discussed.
```I can't say I blame you for wanting to keep me out of your channels, admitting mistakes is difficult and it's easy to just hide from the person who you fucked with. But I don't have to go out of my way to be nice to you while you do so.```is being a dick
dess_warn <@!102691114762371072> Cut your shit and go cool off.
```If neither of these protocols are applicable and the user has broken a rule within the interpretation of a staff member, the default warning system is as follows:
1. Use the bot’s warning system to log the warn.
2. The bot will then message the user about the warn, which they may talk about at any given time to dispute or clarify it.
3. A review of the user is done once enough warns of sufficient severity are accumulated to see if they deserve escalation of force (i.e. a kick or a ban).```
But that doesn't fly here.
Okay, know what? Rule 1. You are being a dick, intentionally, and you can talk shit all you want in other servers.
I said please about three times.
She told me to make my own role. I made my own role.
Ah, right, sorry. <@&336302034070536192>
<@!99695384296701952>
<@!102691114762371072>
Alright, then cut the color from the song role.
Okay but also give it to Lyssa
You can give everyone the cute role.
Yeah, go with "Cute". And also still give it to Lyssa please.
Because discord is built on top of its roles system and no one checked for this very specific edge case
I suspect that the issue might actually be the lack of a manage roles permission
Lyssa also lacks roles entirely, and the inability to manage roles results in reduced ability to manage channels.

<@!102691114762371072> You've not given me permissions to actually edit channels I create on your server
Probably.
Alright, wonderful, please do not give me any reasons to think about jumping out of my window at 2 AM going forward.
Anything else you would like to talk about?
Then the issue is resolved. We now stand at the previous point from yesterday. ```How about this. We keep using your server. Everyone who's staff here gets access to up and make a new channel on your server if they need to.```
Alright.
My interests are in getting a nadeko install that functions more or less the same as Kiri minus any custom stuff as well as creating a bot that could cover what Shirabe does as backups, should they be needed.
Nor am I interested in copying Maria at all.
Nor am I interested in copying the bots function for function.
Oh it's not an emergency at all.
It did take a solid 45 minutes of convincing you to think about that course of action.
Melua, input?
You were about to do it yesterday.
So in other words, they would not be up indefinitely, as they are now.
I am asking you not to offhandedly tell people that their interactions with me cause you distress, as that is manipulative.
The point is that while scrmz knows me, someone else might decide getting to know me isn't worth the friendship. Such as me when I mentioned akame.
Yes, I'm aware. I asked him to send that message. That's not the point.
Where "seeing you playing rocket league with alice was unpleasant" could be just as easily substituted with "not feeling too great" I'd like to ask you to choose your words more carefully.
I don't want you telling people not to interact with me. scrmz has stated pretty much that he'll interact with me all he wants but someone who doesn't know me as well may be manipulated in this fashion, whether you're trying to or not.
That... has nothing to do with what I've just said.
I am deeply uncomfortable with your presence here when you so readily tell people that you'd rather they not interact with me at all.
<@!102691114762371072> Hey, let's talk.
<@!102691114762371072> I'd like to get the jump on you here and say sorry for the warning and threats of escalation yesterday, as well as anything related.
Good morning everyone
<@!285555416056856576>
I would also like to point out that I was trying pretty hard to give *both* of us room to breathe by creating the separate channels on Kriisa's server and she took that as me trying to exclude her. I haven't joined voice there out of respect, but if a channel under my control is not a reasonable option then am I allowed to join the main voice channel?
Probably. I would like opportunities to make that effort but right now I feel like I'm getting shut out pretty consistently.
Alright, I am sorry.
That's why I said before you keep going.
No.
I'm gonna remind you of rule 1 and the informal request before you keep going.
If I were aiming to exclude you, I'd get rid of your staff role here.
I did not add you because I know you can see them
And so at every step of the process, Kriisa has done as little and acted as difficult as possible and honestly I would like her to, quite simply, not be a dick, here, on this server, where I made the rules.
Further I'd like to state that this issue is not about colors. It is about```I'm willing to give staff full admin rights on the Lulu Bus```not giving staff full admin rights, as well as giving no rights at all to one specific staff member, and then when pointed out that rights were not actually given, replied with a bit of a "Fuck you don't ask me for anything" attitude and then when offering to change the role's name, immediately went back on that offer, and then when requested to at least give the role to Lyssa, politely with a please, was promptly ignored, and then when asked *again* to give the role to Lyssa was met with "do it yourself" and then when I did it myself, further refused to not actually let me fully do it myself.
Then with Melua gone and scrmz giving it thought, I'm going to have to ask Kriisa informally to cut her shit, and should said shit not be cut, I will be taking action as the only available mod.
With a heavily implied "Then do it" after the okay.
I brought up the complaint. I pinged Melua to resolve complaint. You asked me what I would do. I pasted the relevant portion of the rules. Your response was "Okay"
dess_warnclear <@!102691114762371072>
Alright, Lyssa has ownership now
Eh. Part of it would be symbolic since I'd no longer pop up in custodian on the userlist.
we can always remove me later
Before I hand over ownership, are we removing me from custodian or waiting?
And no objection to the server ownership idea that... I pitched myself
From the start it was always 2+ custodians purely for power balance stuff. I don't think I should be one of those custodians, and I am also comfortable with Lyssa as sole custodian.
Lyssa does pretty readily call me on my shit and I appreciate her for that, and I also don't think leaving me with the power to unilaterally ignore everyone else because I'm in a bad mood is a good idea.

Works for me
Yeah definitely not.
I'd be comfortable with Lily as a mod if she were to accept.
I would wanna get at least one person before XV. I've been a bit disconnected from the community for a while so I don't have any immediate suggestions beyond "no not this person" but no one mentioned so far is a "no not this person"
<@!99695384296701952> You're free to have input on this stuff too if you want, but we'll go ahead regardless since you've already stated you wanna step down.
I'd say it should be someone handpicked when the mod list has gotten this small. Probably doesn't need to be said but I'll put it out there just in case.
We can try and make it a 5 minute thing but come back to it later if it drags on too long
You up for that? I would imagine sleep is a higher priority
<@290431224596660224> are you around or did you just wake up
<@!99695384296701952>
Alright. I'm gonna leave your Illuminati role on you for now while I think of what to put in announcements, if anything. I'll strip staff as soon as you explicitly tell me to.
You still wanna do prompts or is that off too?
Alright.
Just gonna wait on Melua, then. <@!99695384296701952>
Alright
I would classify a raid as "in a little bit" considering they do have a timer. Unless your static has hold of you for a few hours.
And would it be acceptable to have this discussion a a staggered pace so that we can actually talk about it even if we're not all present at once?
Preoccupied meaning "I'll be more able to talk in a little bit" or "I'm at a New Years party"
<@!99695384296701952> <@290431224596660224> are both of you around?
hierarchy stuff and at least one new mod, talk about it later
I am currently of the mind that the respectfulness rule would only end up escalating situations that don't need to be escalated. I would sooner suggest a "shut your mouth until Lyssa can weigh in" rule because she is the only person here who I know has the level headedness to be able to look at the situation and say "that wasn't really necessary"
<@!102691114762371072> It's been brought to my attention that ```⚧ Yuri Witch (Alice) ⚧Yesterday at 8:13 PM
If I were aiming to exclude you, I'd get rid of your staff role here.```was misconstrued as "I can and will remove your staff role". That was never my intent and I'm sorry for the mixup. What I meant to get across was that "I will never exclude you purposefully, and doing so would be against the server's ethos at its core". Again, I am very sorry about that.
Yes and I'd like you not to tell my friends that you'd rather they don't interact with me, regardless of how that message is worded or why it was said.
Also, you've told me outright that I'm free to use your server.
The offhandedness of the initial comment is the issue here. That was something said in a way that makes me feel like you'd say it to anyone if they asked.
Which I just learned right now.
For the record, ban reasons don't get sent to users. They're recorded for our usage.
Why?
Who was banned? ShadowPixels?
Which, on that note, Sparkle brought up some things the other day regarding serious that are maybe worth thinking about? But also you're kind of on break at the moment, I know you said you wanted to step down and I dunno if any of the discussion concerning leadership changes has changed your mind.
And for people who are like "calm down I didn't do anything" when we tell them no it's probably better to just pull up the command there rather than shove them into serious
People most frequently drop the bomb in the art channels
I think there is worth to have it be used outside of serious
Like, pure text
Oh I was just thinking of having it be an embed or maybe a quote if she  really doesn't wanna bother doing anything
Come at it plain and simple. "Here's what it implies, here's why that's bad, here are some suggested english language alternatives"
yeah no, andrea is a bit of a point of contention. I like her and think she has solid points but it's- yeah that
words can be supplied
<@!99695384296701952> I don't wanna suggest it directly to her at the moment, but what do you think Kriisa's reaction would be to adding a dess_trap command to Kiri for an easy to call "here's why trap is a bad word" statement?
Currently there are 3 sections in <#336297587802112011> and they're labeled "Rules, Rooms, and Roles". Unless we get a fourth fancy picture I'd rather fit any credits neatly into those categories.

And also I still don't know how to credit it. The dude uses like fifteen different names.
Alright
I would take down the reddit banners but only if they can be replaced.
Other than that, where should credits go and how should credits be credited?
The reddit banners were a collaborative effort and I'm not too keen on just throwing them away. I have my own stakes there. As for the rules page, I still wanna get a rules overhaul so we can get new images along with that.
In the past he has explicitly asked to not be credited so I'd go ask him on that one.
Alright
I wanna give her credit, I just also don't want the bots to stagnate and then have her flip out if we decide to replace them because they're stagnating.
<@!99695384296701952> <@290431224596660224> If we add the credit do you think it's unreasonable to also ask Kriisa that if we have simple config request stuff that she should comply? Stuff like "please add this role to role assignment, please turn on coin drops for x channel" stuff like that?
Under roles, I guess?
Where do we put it?
wait fuck
dess_.. Lyssa cum doesn't come out of the butt Alice
It also puts a lot of the burden on one person who already has a lot to do!
I am most comfortable with "all conflicts must be resolved by lyssa" but I 100% understand that not everyone really knows Lyssa as I do and also that you're frequently occupied by work and are downright unreachable
WE WERE GONNA HAVE NEW YEARS PANCAKES
FUCK THE PANCAKES
I agree
We do have alchemist
also please come hug me i am 100% not up for real life after magfest schedules
looks good
Ok, both of you should be able to create channels and do whatever you want with them in the special access section now.
You can see it, but I don't think you can give people access
I might have actually turned that off for people who aren't me or Lyssa so I'll double check when I'm home
Treat the entire category as a separate server, and feel free to make your own channels within that category with your own set of rules and permissions.
Easier and less volatile than using my server
Also I wanna clear up what exactly special access is for. Any friend of anyone in the channel is free to join, as long as they don't create too much friction with who's already there. It's very much "our friends" rather than "my friends"
Ideally we will have as much time as we need but that's not always available
Or. Hmm. I'm gonna make a dummy role for myself in case we need new Illuminati and I'm the only one around. Disadvantage of the server owner being in perpetual work hell. Once we have one or two new Illuminati just nuke the dummy role.
Lemme take a look at Illuminati privileges so I can alter anything that I'll need while we look for new staff. Other than that, bump me down to Illuminati at the same time.
I figured
Thank you, that makes a lot of things easier
Definitely not.
The goblin slayer discussion was 100% in line. Solo had an unpopular opinion and sometimes that just happens.
R said it in the past. Let the community do the work. We're part of the community, just a part that needs to take caution to avoid threatening people where threats are not warranted.
While I would be hesitant to vote yes in giving R full mod powers immediately were he to come back, I would 100% be on board with Kriisa's return to staff as long as she, like, talks to me for things beyond moderator duties. But that's somewhere else entirely.

But yeah I think we should go forward with a "argue with caution" rule but also that sounds like a "figure it out after we shake out the hierarchy stuff" thing
I'm not gonna say we did bad, just that we could have done a lot better.
I mean, after Kriisa's comment there, yeah, definitely. I think it could be much more efficiently handled with a "I mean some girls have dicks" but hindsight, 2020, stuff like that.
Basically a case of "no one did anything right here"
Sparkle is maybe not the best person to model our team after but I do think that Kriisa's line there sounds a lot like a threat.
```SparkleLast Sunday at 5:35 PM
As for unmodly behavior, there's one an example I'd like to point out. it may not be the only example. but there was the time where rukia said something along the lines of 
>Dicks
>Girls
hmm
and saki's response was worrying.
While I will say that both sides had passive aggressive behavior,
In my opinion Saki's  I'm going to have to make some *assumptions* came off as essentially a threat due to their moderator status
of course, that's a very minor example
other examples include times where moderators have joined in on the "ganging up"
I've noticed that saki and r have done that at times whether they meant to or not
Yuri GirlLast Sunday at 5:38 PM
Kriisa will be changing her attitude. That being said, Rukia's comment was also not acceptable, and while I may change it, current policy is to point out unacceptable behavior and comments as such rather than simply deleting them and sending a DM. The former lets the entire community know what was done and why it was bad, the latter can only ever tell the offender what's wrong.
As always, if there's an issue with staff, you can bring it up with a custodian if you feel the need. There are three of us for a reason (although Lyssa is a bit hard to reach)```The "Kriisa will be changing her attitude" bit was when I was still heated from earlier events. I should have worded that bit differently.
Something about assumptions. It sounded vaguely threatening.
I do kind of agree with them? Like yeah it should be addressed, but ideally it should be addressed directly rather than uh... what were Kriisa's words there
it's kinda scattered throughout there

gah, they didn't give me an easily quotable one message
Anyway, so. The thing Sparkle brought up concerning serious.
same
that's when my trip back is
yeah
the 6th
In any case, while you're free to make whatever decision you want, there's gonna be a 4 day period where me and Lyssa will be at a 24 hour con. You don't have to actively moderate but if you could stomp out any especially bad stuff please do.
But anyway, I asked earlier and you're free to give me a non-answer but ```I know you said you wanted to step down and I dunno if any of the discussion concerning leadership changes has changed your mind.```
this person speaks like langou
I made a bad decision again ;A;
Also do you have the gamer word tweet on hand
But that's just a person with exceptionally bad opinions
If they're actively harassing people it's a different story
I'm gonna say don't do post-mortem bans just because Kiri and Shirabe already make it very easy to spot who's returning to start shit and isn't smart enough to make a new account
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
wan wan
I'm totally up for convincing someone away from valk. Assuming he would have time to check and be active, would you give him a vote of confidence?
I was gonna propose appointing Kro as a mod because even though he doesn't say much here, he does mod other servers and seems pretty stable.
Actually, this talk can wait a bit. It's not terribly important.
<@290431224596660224> You know Krotash, yeah?
I've let her know she's free to rejoin. She doesn't want to, pretty understandably, but don't go rushing to mute her or anything unless she actually starts causing trouble.
<@290431224596660224> now that we have the muted role, what's your opinion on letting Kriisa back in and just muting her if she tries anything before Lyssa is available again?
If we end up banning R for his shit, I propose also banning Hana. She's not active on this server and only showed up last night with what I can only assume is the express intent of starting shit.
alright
Good luck!
Hana got the mute for piggy backing off of shit after I had muted R
Fair enough. But yeah, R going off about conspiracy theories is a pretty good reason to mute, imo.
I don't think there's any reason for them to not believe you *after* they all left their staff positions
last two, actually
the last one needs to be clicked
also only the first 5 images show
He does kind of imply some things about you in there.

should i just post the screenshots?
oh
what what stuff?
R has the accomplishment of being the first person to earn it.
We now have the role again
So uh... ultimately he is the reason I kicked Kriisa instead of muted, because we DID have the role until he objected to it.
Yeah. The only reason we didn't have it here was because R was very vocally against it.
It is quite tiring
I muted R and Hana for doing... exactly what R and Hana do. I have some screenshots of what R said before I deleted it all that Rakhi sent me, I'll post them whenever people are around. <@285555416056856576> <@290431224596660224>
There's now a muted role, for future this scenarios
The sole thing I'm seeing that I said that *wasn't* me telling them to drop an issue was ```If you wanted to concern yourself with moderator discussions, you shouldn't have quit.```
And when she did that, I started issuing warnings. I flat out did not respond.
My first real response to R was just telling him to drop it. I flat out didn't take the bait, it only became an issue when Kriisa completely unprompted decided to go off talking shit about me.
But again, to restate: this is exactly why I wanted to ban R before he did anything.
Alright.
Should we continue discussing some stuff without scrmz? I'd like to get some meaningful discussion in while you're not busy.
Alright
Leave the staff position or leave for school?
Told them that we've had discussions in general about the same topic in the past and then discussed it here when other people are actually around.
I didn't want to kick, but I also felt that preventing Kriisa from further airing her dirty laundry solely to make me look bad had to happen somehow. The warning didn't stop it, so I picked the next mildest solution there was.
We've had similar conversations about drugs in general in the past and have never seen the need to move to serious. I am entirely convinced that R was just busybodying and trying to subvert me, which is why I ignored him at first, and later dismissed his complaints without much fanfare. The issue blew up when they started saying that me being the only active mod at *3 in the fucking morning* was a problem.
I can make an off-role so that kicking isn't needed, but it'd take a bit considering I'd have to alter permissions for every single channel
Further, Kriisa tried to quote the rules back at me when uh... rule 3 pretty explicitly says to take the issue up privately.
To reply to some things scrmz has said...

```Kriisa didnt seem like she wanted to stop in #general, so perhaps if Alice initiated the DM that may have worked.```

Kriisa was told to stop or take it to a DM, with consequences for ignoring that rather plainly laid out. I *could* have initiated the DM, but I shouldn't have had to. The warning was 100% justified imo, mod tells you not to do a thing and then you do the thing.

```I also think being kicked is a big step from a warn. If I were to get kicked, I would think that the moderation team dont want me here, simple as. A temporary mute may have had the same solution without seeming so “leave-and-dont-come-back-ish”```

If muting was an option, I'd have gone with that, but sadly that's not a feature supported by discord. Kicking was literally my only option for forcing her to stop talking, which I believe was necessary in the moment. She was promptly sent an invite link and told when she would be allowed to come back.
part of this is why I wanted to get rid of R before he did anything
and read through the log
im awake <@285555416056856576> <@290431224596660224>
The kick is until you can look over everything, for the record. Not permanent.
3:12 AM is R's first message, and then after repeated warnings to drop the topic I ended up kicking Kriisa
<@!285555416056856576> wan wan discord stuff in general
wan wan check line
With context on how R conducted himself in Valkyrie after leaving for the first time, keep an eye on him to make sure he's not trying to start shit.
Same!
when did i do that
oh shit i already ordered food
Alright, autoscorer credit is gone. Are you gonna do the banner placeholders tonight or another time?
oh
also wait i thought you gave me rules perms
and uhh... hibiki is definitely a super genki "i am going to punch you until you are my friend"
Yeah. I think that since we have the old banners available to us, we should swap them out for now until we can get some better ones.
and sidebar buttons are the same, as soon as a solution can be found. Those will be the hard part imo.
server icon, as soon as we can get a suitable one. I can dig through screencaps and find something usable
rules banners... I wanna get a huge rework of the rules page done so I'd like to wait on those. If it's absolutely urgent then I will do some basic text formatting but I'd prefer to save it and get it all in one go
so emoji is down, subreddit banners are... as soon as you can do them because i don't know what sorcery was done to make them rotate
https://myfigurecollection.net/item/291965
no results on saucenao so I'm pretty sure it's merch
lemme saucenao it though
Same art style as the other charms they've released too
The original version has a ring to put a chain through, so I'm like 90% sure it's merch
Bloop didn't make the Kanade but it's official art I think
there









lemme see if i still have the old gear banners as placeholders
She didn't make any of the gifs
KanadeSit
hang on lemme send this from my laptop
Can you swap in
Also the emote
shift+enter
Should we draw up a general timeline of how and when everything can get done wrt artistic consent?
That can be given to me specifically for that channel
Also need perms to send messages in <#336297587802112011>
Could you slap that on my dummy role?
I was gonna do the emote earlier, but I need server manage perms
As for other things, I dunno what a good right now solution is.
Yeah. I... mostly wanna go over how I could have done things differently to avoid kicking Kriisa, but also yes art stuff. Rules I'm gonna wanna do that complete makeover that's been coming for a while and then just toss out R's images in the process, subreddit banners I think I still have the old ones somewhere.
I try to do what I think is right but it keeps blowing up.
Sorry for causing so much hassle
dilating cant type
I'm also questioning whether to replace them at all. Everything that was made for the server was explicitly as a gift to the community. R's issue is with me, not the community.
I have some simple ideas on a layout without images but I wanna make sure it actually looks good before pushing it to the public rules
mostly because the @ will self destruct in a few days
But there's no more bots, so Kriisa's credit needs to go
I won't remove them just yet because I'm gonna want replacements, or at the very least time to think about how to reorganize everything in a sensical manner.
<@285555416056856576> can you alter the permissions for <#336297587802112011> to let me post there whenever you can? I've been locked out with the change to illuminati
<hug sticker>
Okay!
<@285555416056856576> wan wan
Sleep well
Fair enough
Which no one can see but us.
True. But also the only evidence of who does the banning is in the audit log.
Before you head off, do you have any input on potentially banning R considering how he conducted himself in val's server and what he did today and yesterday?
Alright, whatever your choice is, you're still my friend and if you do step down, the position will be open if you ever wanna hop on it again. The lounge will remain the lounge, there's no staff requirement for that category.
I'd prefer a DM for that, the lounge isn't really tied to the server's other operations. It's just a category for friend stuff.
Also yeah, take a break. Real life comes first.
Alright. Also hit me up for overwatch or rocket league sometimes, I definitely need things to do that aren't slay the spire 24/7
I'd do it but I'm never sure if I'd be interrupting something important in your studying or whatever
When's the exam stuff all over, btw? If you wouldn't mind I'd like to check back in with you about modding again once you don't have to worry about it anymore.
I defer to Lyssa here. I'm not happy that it got to this point but ultimately your own mental health is the priority here. As I said, you're always welcome back.
We gave vali the boot for exactly that
Who do you think told her to look for drama? And also, do we want people who like to cause drama sticking around?
I'd also like to add, R doesn't conspire alone. Hana popping up at the same time out of nowhere wasn't a coincidence.
I can dig up DMs from R re:valkb when I'm home
Also, by his own protocol, he should already be banned
R was also warned before his mute. I told him to stop, he very explicitly made it known he wouldn't stop on his own.
Hana has done nothing but actively try to make things worse
I'm willing to unmute her after we clear all this but first offense is a ban imo
Hana is a troll and was not active on this server until R started trying to do exactly what I just said
I'm not comfortable with unmuting R until he decides to play nice. Given how he hung around Valkyrie for at least a year explicitly to conspire against and undermine authority and how he refuses to actually listen to anyone, I don't know if that'll be ever.
I don't have time to make the announcement now, could you do it?
geh
Could you paste that in text form?
Looks a bit better in wumboji form
<:KanadeSit:535301654464036884>
I'm willing to spend that slot on making a user happy
but we have 49 others and a free slot
a bit
and confirmed official!
but also the KanadeSit emoji is very important
wan
alright i can wait
oh wait that is the moderation issue you mentioned isn't it
<@285555416056856576> is there anything else that can be gone over at the moment or do you need time? I am particularly interested in how I could have handled yesterday better.
that one is double lesbian

It's about fun.
Karaoke isn't about sounding good, so that's a non-issue!
I'm bot <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
On the list of things to change. Gonna make the background untiled + possibly smaller. Thread icons will also be changed once we have decent images to replace them with because the transparency only works on certain backgrounds.
id join calls frequently if i had a place near my laptop to put my headset
maybe by accident i dunno
although ive seen people pop into it a few times
ever
The third is my favorite, actually. BroTeamPill's fate of videos are hilarious.
Well when Karaoke happens on the valkyrie server, people join the call specifically for that. So it's not a matter of "do you join the call now?" it's a matter of "will you join the call if karaoke is happening?"
Alright, so one suggestion from me and two suggestions from an anonymous party which shall not be named.

My suggestion - Weekly salt/bragging threads on the subreddit for XDU. Rolled 16 times and didn't get the character you wanted? You will have a place to immortalize your anger at the game's desire sensors. Rolled once and got 6 of that 5* you were going for? Make everyone else even more salty.

Anonymous suggestion 1 - Karaoke. We'd need a bot capable of facilitating this, and while that's probably possible, I'd want to know how many people would actually consistently participate before making any commitments.

Anonymous suggestion 2 - Group lets plays. Video games are fun. Playing video games with other people is more fun. Playing video games with other people and then recording the results and uploading them to youtube is... probably fun, I've never done that before. Periodically we would choose a game, get on voice chat, and have someone with decent recording software record everything and afterwards we'd do some editing and upload the results to youtube.
You can
And it's been added under keywords and other resources as "English Symphogear XDU Wiki"
Ooh, that's a good idea. Gonna do it right now.
Some people may want "headcanons and fancontent" but as like 3 separate channels. I'm not gonna dictate how people should interpret the 3 questions I asked at this point because at the moment it's looking pretty clearly like most people want a single fan content channel
I guess I'll make a couple of announcement posts for people to vote on how they'd like to see this implemented/if they'd like it at all
Because let's be honest, if we're making fanfic some of it's gonna be nsfw
And then also the secondary issue of "should this be two separate channels, one NSFW, or just a single NSFW channel"
I guess the main issue I'd be concerned about is "would people know this is where to put things like fanfic if it were labelled fan content"
And other than that most fan content is just headcanons, which I would feel comfortable grouping in with fanfics.
fan content discussion or fanfic discussion? Because we already have the two art channels which are mostly there to house fanart.
This came up in a random twitter thread and I'm gonna subject myself to the same rules I've set up for everyone else here: would anyone be interested in a channel for discussing shipping and fanfic? Because I personally would love a place to yell about the possibility for hibimikuhibi now that there are two canon hibikis.
Or by being a bot
Basically you only get a color change if you've proven yourself worthy of wielding any sort of power
Whoa I never said anything about roles. Just expanding flairs on the sub itself. Special roles may be created at times (like the cape role) but I have no plans to add every relic as a role here. I realize it can be a fun thing but it muddles with users' abilities to tell who is or isn't a mod at a glance.
Thank you, Lyssa.
No attacks on others, and your comments are beginning to pass a threshhold there.
I'd like it if you did not single out Quinn as this "destroyer of harmony". Please keep things civil, both of you.
Everyone on this server follows the rules, or else they leave the server.
Part of "keep it civil" means "no attacking people for their RP preferences"
Do keep in mind that "others like her" includes me. <:HibiMiku:336656759424942080>
As for rules concerning RP, I'm not going to put any heavy moderation on an RP channel beyond the need to keep it clean and civil. RP exists to explore situations that do not arise naturally.
If people want an RP channel, I'll make that. I'll put up an announcement later concerning it.
You can post your headcanons to the subreddit where I have an easier time managing discussions that get out of hand. The discord isn't the place to have a headcanon pairing channel.
I do not believe that a pairing channel would accomplish much beyond starting waifu wars, which is a thing I'd like to avoid, so I'm gonna have to veto that idea. As for the RP channel, if there's enough support for that, I'll add one.
I feel like it's a good idea.  It obviously breaks from the mold of the staff roles (all villain groups) (shut up the server was made before AXZ ended) but it's not clear WHY you can make announcements.
we still need to add alchemist flairs but im exceedingly bad at my job of watching anime
same reason theres no kanade flair
no ryouko in the ovas
She watches you, recording every single thing you say or do, waiting for the right moment to strike
I'll take suggestions for anything, but Ryouko suggestions will be slow since 1) Lyssa runs the bot and she has a lot of work basically all the time and 2) there's already a bunch of stuff we want to do with her
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Since I make it a point to name each emote with the featured character's name first, no fix
Discord orders them in reverse alphabetical order
it'd probably be too hard to make out
That too
Only if we actually have it in gif form to begin with (or if R is willing to go digging for the screen)
ahhhh i forgot sorry I'll try and have it up by the end of tomorrow
I'll add one on monday or tuesday
<@284390402210136064> We didn't ignore that suggestion! We just silently took note of it. <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073> <:HibikiEdge:407398049531559937>
Can we get that enabled instead then? If people can't ping her, then the spam isn't an issue.
How easily can you make her respond randomly without fixing up the message generation?
Until we can have her respond randomly, I'm in favor of this. <@!102691114762371072>
They're in the other resources section of the sub
I mean I guess you can play against a friend but that seems like a rare usage of a role ping for 1v1 stuff
I'd also thought about hearthstone, but again - what's the point?
<@138131889142628352> I mean, you use the gaming channel as XDU people use the XDU channel. The self-assign roles are just to let you opt-in to pings about stuff, like if someone wanted to start a pickup group for overwatch, they just ping the role to get the attention of interested people.
In the interest of not adding *yet another* channel to our massive list of public channels, we made that one private because it probably wouldn't generate a whole lot of useful discussion. Also what R said.
She actually already does! But the output is in a private channel because we didn't think [random lurker #57 has left] would be much more than clutter in public chat channels.
good enough for me and im pretty sure ive seen more than one person mention osu here
I'm telling you to add it
Also I'm gonna suggest 100% Orange Juice <@!102691114762371072>
Co-op games especially. If there's a game you'd like to play with others and would like the option to just ping a bunch of people without bugging staff for an announcement, please tell us. Overwatch is there right now because it was the most popular team game I could think of.
Re:karaoke night, which I totally should have responded to earlier.

This was an idea a while ago (I think I even posted it here). The issue is having someone to run it. I theoretically could do so, but probably wouldn't sing myself. If anyone wants a karaoke night, or wants to run karaoke night, now's your chance to speak up.
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
I don't want to clutter up the rules page too much, and since you have no special powers to be aware of, I decided against it
I have a bunch of emojis that can be used so I'll probably let people vote on which 50 they want
removed from discord.me for the time being, so that should cut off any bots
there should be a pinned post in announcements for xdu event and story TLs, if you need help with the game itself then <#336298054724485131> is usually helpful
It's a secret <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
We phased out "funsies" roles a while ago because the role list is *really* cluttered. But we might have a solution for you out sometime in the near future!
~~this is totally what this channel is for~~
suggestion: watch flip flappers
That's a pretty good idea but I'm gonna want to limit it to official art (or fanart we have permission for) which for Kanade... isn't a lot. We can try and make it work though.
That definitely warrants a special role, but I'll want some time to think over the details of the role.
That seems fair. We'll discuss it, and until then, just use the channel for whatever the thing you're creating would normally go under (for instance, gunpla would go under nonsymphogear-spoilers). Anyone *else* who'd also like this please make yourselves known so we can gauge interest.
If it were self-sourcing, then I'd make the rule the same as on the sub where you HAVE to source it. I don't wanna do that, because it'd make image dumps cumbersome.
The reason it's automatic is because every image *should* have a source.
<:HibikiPadoru:516438720082346004>
consider it done
I think other mods can as well?
For now, if anyone's curious, I can tell you how many users are in a given role
It might be possible to make that information available through a bot command
The original intent was to give any type of fan content a lower traffic channel where they could share their work without being swamped by the traffic in the art channels
i don't think changing it back would be a good idea, but ill think on rolling that sort of content into fanworks
fancontent was changed to sfw because there wasnt enough nsfw art so seeing a random dick was a bit of a concern
we shall discuss this! when im less sleepy
yes. Both things had relatively little content to justify having two whole channels for it and we want to avoid channel bloat
Feel free to suggest hexes/colors.
I'll see about a Serena role.
I'll slap that on as something to get done quickly.
It doesn't, that's been a problem for a while. No one really wanted to bother learning how to navigate the new layout because the new layout is horseshit.
...I do not remember this request. We can sort that out a bit later since it's kind of a pain to redo the sprite sheet.
on the subreddit?
There's a few extra like <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690> reserved for special people that do special things but iirc there's only 5 of those

uhhhh
Mod discussion is pending
R, please do not drudge up discussions from last night right this second
Just wait for Lyssa, there's a reason she's server owner.
Fuck's sake, it's 4 AM. Kriisa was warned, twice, and she knows the general order of escalation. She was told to bring shit to DMs. She didn't listen. She got a warn. She continued. She got a kick. I don't think it needs to be said that "listen to the mods" is an expectation.
But anyway, yeah, Kriisa put in time and effort to the bots. Then she stepped down. I'd have replaced the bots then and there but she was insistent on keeping them up. I didn't kick the bots, for the record, Kriisa pulled them herself. Ideal situation? Lyssa looks over everything and Kriisa rejoins and it's like nothing ever happened, but R himself said not to entertain people trying to argue you into a corner and I'm just taking his advice.
hana don't make me turn off external emojis
Kriisa made them for Shirabe, sure, but Ryoko has that code partially implemented and it shouldn't be long to finish the sourcing.
The only thing that's really hampered is RV
It shouldn't be too hard to get it up and running.
Image sourcing was being worked on for Ryoko until Kriisa came in and gave us Shirabe
Yes, Lyssa does.
Ryoko is actually pretty versatile! She's basically Kiri and Shirabe mushed into one bot
Yeah, I'll work on getting some replacements running. I thiiiiink Ryoko's code still exists so once Lyssa wakes up most of the important features should be easily replicated if Kriisa doesn't rejoin.
Probably. I'll get on that after MAGFest though.
Gonna need a Tony Glazer color too
Maria? You guessed it. Tony Glazer.
Shirabe? Also Tony Glazer
Replace kirichan with our new overlord, Tony Glazer
~~I love my yellow and green lesbian dolls~~
Phara is hardly used but is also the only phara emote...
<:MikuSinging:421435301731368960> maybe? When I added that one, I was mostly trying to get rid of all the valk emotes and in the process added two singing emotes.
I petition to add toni to this server, actually. It's become something of an in joke and I like that.
There's a few that would do well. OtherChrisUpset, CharmPoint, and ChrisCry would be great. GrapeKun would probably do well and Toni just for memes
We didn't have the issue when AXZ was airing, but also we didn't have 400 people when AXZ was airing
That sounds horrid
If we want a waifu bot then it seems more logical to just revive `Project Maria`
It wasn't a criticism, just pointing out that we already have literally that.
I mean. We tried that once.
What does it do?
first thought is katawa shoujo
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Same reason I only ever use screencaps as my avatars. I don't own the art, might as well use the stuff that's been paid for and used commercially.
Using the anime as emotes is fine because Satelight already got paid. When you use fanart, you strip the artist of even exposure, for whatever that amounts to.

That is valid. Not a lot of people know about the react functions either.

Ryouko is no longer on strike
Please do! Also lets move this to general, its been like a day.
She's not outputting join or leave messages, but she was working fine yesterday. I'll just enable discord's horrendous default join messages for now.

hello new and old people!
but app discord is fine
so browser discord is wonk
weeeeeeeird
or through the direct link i sent you?
did you get in  trhough the sidebar?
anyone here wanna try joining from the browser?
so the browser is fucking up
yeah that's pretty much it. I was searching through social guilds, saw one named SONG and I was like "...why is it all caps"
no i joined their guild
I've recruited someone through maplestory of all things
Hello!
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993> Keep in mind a few of the channels are spoiler channels, but the rest of them have a strict no spoilers rule so you're able to browse the discord without fear of being spoiled
<:GenjuurouDetermined:336656743977451520>

im on the app on my laptop
why can't i join then?
...okay that makes things weird
Lots of things are planned!
...does such a person exist?
You're welcome here in any case. This server is explicitly inclusive of all types of people.
Also I'm not too sure if I remember you that well I'm sorry
It used to be that the only (public) Symphogear discord was (what is now) the Valkyrie server. At some point I decided that the rules on the Valkyrie server didn't mesh too well with how I was running the subreddit, so I split off and made this server.
Hi I'm here I'm Alice
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
if not why would i even bother
if i join a server with this avatar i expect someone to say "all hands on dick!"
i typically take a look at peoples avatars and try to comment on those when new people show up
that too. give them a chance to say something before implying we're gonna eat them
I'd also like to request people stop saying "dont lurk" here

lurkers are fine, they may still be looking at the discord, waiting for announcements or just shy
too late, they're gone
pydiscord with no defaults or anything like nadeko
Ryouko is coded from scratch
But that's more effort since Shirabe is entirely custom
We considered deprecating Ryouko and having Kirichan handle her current functions, but Ryouko stores logs in a way that Kiri can't. We COULD merge Ryouko into Shirabe though.
New bot! For new functionality!
I'm not in hell though.

Probably an issue with your browser.
Does https://discord.gg/ewvbjUj show up as an invalid invite?
Dunno. Works for luci, works for me.
I dunno what's going on with you then. Did you hit ctrl+F5 on the subreddit or on the invite?
Can you try closing your browser entirely and then trying again?
The subreddit should point you to ewvbjUj
screenshot?
Shouldn't matter.
hit ctrl+F5 on the subreddit then click the link again
and is not what is currently on the sub
that is not the currently active discord invite
I need to see the full window
Should be instant. Can you give us a screenshot of what you're seeing in discord and when you click the link in the subreddit?

Nah it's just a dumb thing some guy said on twitter
Just me poking at a recent thing that popped up. By "gamer words" I mean "being racist as fuck".
It's still a symphogear server though!
We just have a lot of openly trans people here, probably because we don't tolerate slurs and "gamer words"
it was probably at the bottom, yeah

I feel like I'd participate more if I didn't have memories of The Old Days and the constant expecting for the server to feel more like it did when I first made it? I dunno. It's not a bad thing, it's just weird dissonance in my head.

This channel is primarily for fancontent and DIY type stuff you've made that *isn't* related to Symphogear. Symphogear figures are allowed to be posted here, however any Symphogear DIY type stuff belongs in <#357682999300718592>.

Serena should be about Kanade's age, shouldn't she?
i cannot be more hyped for an anime season than i am right now *and we don't even have anything close to an air date*
oh my god finish axz and watch the post credits scene
Because Chris is a second year in G and calls Tsubasa Senpai and Tsubasa is still in school in G
Wait, yeah. Tsubasa HAS to have been 3rd year in S1, and G HAS to have been before graduation
2nd or 3rd. Hibiki and Miku were first years.
Yeah
http://symphogear.blogspot.com/2017/06/axz-website-background-words-and-kaneko.html
So tell us how exactly will the 4th season, AXZ, start out?

AXZ's story will pick up just about a month after the end of the “Magical Girl Incident” that was covered in GX. In fact, in between seasons 3 and 4 there is also a story that serves as a sort of season 3.5. It's called “the Alexandria Incident” and will be distributed through the smart phone app “Symphogear XD Unlimited” at a later date. Sorry for using this time to self-advertise, but I wrote the script for that story. There is some material in it that will link to and introduce AXZ, so I would be happy if everyone would look into it.

Getting back on topic, AXZ will start slowly during their leisure days, or perhaps it's better to say their school days, and involves a scene between Miku and Hibiki as they come to the end of summer.
How does Japan do grades? Where I live you get 4 report cards per year.
Yes. So did Hibiki `but she didn't do it`
It's on zoids blog somewhere lemme dig it up
Kaneko said so
So that'd make GX probably Summer, since AXZ started at the start of the school year
Well we know that GX takes place only a short while before AXZ
I kinda always assumed S1 was spring but I dunno
don't stab each other over this please
this is hurting my head im gonna go eat
Please let these girls rest
Maybe she was held back
Swords aren't very good at academics they're mostly used for cutting things
Well, Tsubasa graduates between G and GX, and GX ends towards the end of Summer
No, AXZ literally opens with Hibiki complaining about now finishing her summer homework.
I think that's how it probably goes.
Ok so. S1 is start of the school year. G is end of the school year. GX is end of the following school year. AXZ is start of the next school year.
So S1 and G, HibiMiku are 1st years, Chris is a 2nd year, and Tsubasa is a 3rd year. It doesn't make sense any other way with all of the senpai obsession Chris has.
the image says nothing about why it's happening but serena sure seems to be enjoying it

Also on the topic of atribution, we are working on ways to figure out how to atribute artists in the art channels without impeding the flow of image dumps
<@255412045933969408> If it's art it can be posted in one of the art channels. If it's not art, but it's symphogear related, it can be posted in <#357682999300718592> with proper atribution if you didn't make it. If it's not art and it's not symphogear related, <#336297387863703552>
<#357682999300718592> is *specifically* for fanmade symphogear creations, and if you drew it yourself you can put it there or here (or <#336297808221044736>) but the art channels are general purpose
art's art. if it's official it's fair game. if it's fanmade it's fair game. if it's symphogear, go for it. not symphogear, just as well.
PriPri was so good, but the ending makes me want a second season...
non-symphogear stuff can go here, yes

Of course if discord just gave us a way to remove link previews everything would work fine
That's why it's in plans and not in progress. We need to figure out how to reduce image duplication

gay dragons are good
Plus a case of sameface, probably because the artist wasn't actually drawing most of their faces and was just making it black with color coded cracks
They normalized heights a bit too much I think
Tsubasa should be taller too
Maria and Kirika should be taller and Chris should be shorter
Heights too, although the artist fucked up the height difference between Kirika and Shirabe
Chris can be identified by the red cracks in her berserk mode. Also no one's mouth is glowing red because their mouths never glow red.

Letting girls dominate you is always a good strategy
I dunno how well lesbian dating advice works for straight people
My suggestion is to get to know someone for about 4 years, convince them that they're trans, and then ask them out after 2-4 years of awkwardly signaling each other that you're totally into them and they should make the first move because you're too nervous that asking them out would ruin your friendship permanently.
I was hoping that typing was to ask me how many people I've asked out because the follow up to that statement is 1
Every single girl I've asked out has said yes so far

tbh there's no proof in most media that any characters are heterosexual and I function on gay until proven straight
Not a clue. They're in this discord though, but they never talk.

For further reading on why trap is considered a slur, in case anyone has questions on those lines: https://andrearitsu.com/2017/12/01/re-trap/
Consider that a gentle reminder
no you're fine
4) slurs, in any form, are a violation of rule 1
1) trap is a slur
2) various words work in place of trap depending on who exactly you're referring to. Cute boy that looks like a girl? otokonoko, femboy, whatever else you wanna say that isn't trap. Trans girl? girl.
3) Avoid jokes that tiptoe the line between "saying these characters are not girls" and "implying these characters are not girls" because it's just really easy to trip while you're tiptoeing and if you fall on the wrong side of that line I will not be happy

<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
I guess
Hibiki at 16 would mean Genjuurou and Ryouko had her when Genjuurou was... 17
KiriShira are 14
Genjuurou is 33
Let's say Momria is like. 26. Tsubakaasan is 24.
KiriShira were never blood related *and* they've known each other since they were children. They're super close but they're not fucking.
also uhhhhh the incest
i mean we're basing this entirely off of momria to begin with
yeah
Maria never really adopted them, they just became their own family after they all lost their own
I'll allow it
After Maria and Tsubasa get together they adopt Chris
Maria knew Shirabe and Kirika since they were all kids, but their parents were all tragically killed in an accident so Maria acted as their parent in an orphanage
maybe older
Genjuurou is like 28 in this scenario
Fudou is still a piece of shit
Also: Yatsuhiro and his wife had Genjuurou early, and then waited to have Tsubasa so there's like a 9~10 year gap between the two and Genjuurou is only like 24 years younger than Yatsuhiro so they mostly speak as equals now that Genjuurou is an adult.
Look I just have good ideas I never said I was a writer
still drunk
yes
Ver is Tsubasa's crazy uncle that just spouts racist shit at Thanksgiving and gets drunk
genjuurou is hibiki's dad now
never existed
no he's fucking gone
but older by like 2 years
sister
Fujitaka and Tomosato are Elfnein's parents
And he's still ripped because why not
He is aged down appropriately except we don't know how old he is anyway
No in this timeline Genjuurou isn't Tsubasa's father's brother, he's just Tsubasa's brother
Elfnein as the younger cousin
Tsubasa didn't have any fucked up family bullshit so Genjuurou is just literally her brother and instead of Hibiki having fuckass mcdingleshit as a father Genjuurou is her father
Symphogear family AU, tsubamaria as the moms, dmjii as children, chris as their big sister, hibiki as the gay cousin, and miku as hibiki's girlfriend
by massive i mean like 2 or 3 pictures but that counts as massive for kanade
<@246146781832806401> have you seen the massive amounts of kanade that linkleft has drawn recently
why didnt you just make a bot
they adopt Chris who is a 17 year old delinquent but is easily tamed by maria and tsubasa's motherly approach. also let's move this to fancontent.
she's 24 and recently graduated
you don't adopt a child while you're in college
nah tsubasa needs to adopt chris with maria
id play it if i understood it
i wish there was an english wiki for the pripri game

Still, I followed from a locked account. Being so hypervigilant that you notice and block a locked account immediately seems a bit much
blast
Which is, ironically, the most loony thing about her aggressive blocking. She hates having her art rehosted, but then gives everyone an actual reason to rehost it
Lets make Japanese twitters and tweet at each other in Japanese, all in a grand plot to look at art done by this one talented and xenophobic person without needing to rehost it even while their account is locked
I'm just doing it so whenever she locks her account I can just go and look at it anyway
how do i delete all the tweets off an account
pretty sure just paranoia + xenophobia
I already have a bunch of twitter accounts I don't use
I'll just make a dummy account, make a Japanese bio, follow some Japanese people, and tweet in Japanese a bit

oh they block locked accounts too?
ok hang on one sec

It's symphogear, time travel isn't against the rules
They can bring any character they want back and justify it with time travel.
She fused with Elfnein
Carol also isn't permadead
Ver isn't permadead though
Death isn't permanent in Symphogear anyway so if they wanted to they could bring them back
leave
like
They could have let the illuminati just
AXZ was good aside from pointlessly killing the Illuminati
A beautiful mess, but still a mess
But GX is still a mess
the plot made actual sense
They started getting their shit together in GX
They fumbled hugely introducing him, better to quietly pretend he didn't exist in the first place
I'd prefer that they just realize that they have no way of properly handling the character
He made no amends, his options were die or die harder
He was still a piece of shit in the end
Which... didn't redeem him.
And then they gave him a redemption arc
And only a piece of shit.
Hibiki's dad is a piece of shit.
Fudou is an actual character. He's set up to be an antagonist, and fills that role perfectly well.
FUCK Fudou
tumblr doesn't like porn
no
tumblr previews won't show lily's posts
as long as the blog is publicly accessible
i got sold on symphogear by "it's gay"
the story isnt good but its fun
even if symphogear uses them constantly
They'll probably play a part, but if they kill the Custodians where do they go from there
I'm not entirely sure that the Custodians are THE enemy in XV
backfires completely by allowing the illuminati back in
Make the villain in XV have heavy use of time travel
I want them to time travel the alchemists back
https://imgur.com/a/cbDTK

i'd like to unsubscribe from the time traveling program
this is good also my hair is on fire
i feel like im missing context
Harder than grabbing it straight off saucenao at least.
I mean. You CAN do twitter and tumblr to some extent, it's just hard to do.
They're Japanese. Can't ask them for permission.
nope
lets see if shirabe can source this
...i have a moth girl but there's some nudity involved
a mole with a pimple on top
knees are banned
I'm actually unsure of whether I'd rule that nsfw or not but I err on the side of caution
no tity in sfw
Or... the reaction should stay if I remove the emote, shouldn't it?
<:KanadeSmile:341463635492601856>
But yeah, if you can ask the artist for permission I'd love to throw that onto the emote list. There's also the Kanade picture I have in there already that I'd love to get rid of because it's fanart and I never got permission but it's already being used for the Kanade role assignment so I can't actually do anything about it.

the anime with probably lesbian spies
the anime literally about lesbians
but so far notable 3Hz animations include:
My mom watched it and even she was like "they are definitely gay"
they gay
"turtledove"
what if Symphogear was a 3Hz anime and we got the appropriate gay
oh, or not. It just looks like her spy outfit when it's small
ooooh there's two icons for each girl
could be better
but how does it look at discord size
some white on the edges but usable
ok how's this
but it's hard because fuzzy select ALSO deletes her leg
wanna get the white removed from this and use it

Talking about your personal favorite is fine and we have several users who do that, it's just the implication that one may be better than the others that's discouraged. Basically waifu wars are silly.

I can throw you an invite to that server if you want
Alternatively, there's a discord for 3Hz you can discuss it in, they have a dedicated flip flappers channel.
If your intent was for people who've seen it, then I would post it in <#377148557796442134>
Well, yeah. That's the point. If you wanna post the art for the art, post it here without caption. If you wanna post the art for the discussion, post it to <#377148557796442134> with the caption.

Hell, being a generally enjoyable person gets you coins.
So, basically anything that encourages discord/subreddit participation is a valid method of getting coins. Participate in prompts? Coins. Host an event? Coins. Participate in an event? Coins. So we absolutely would give out coins for anime club stuff. <@284390402210136064>
discord is ass
see funny thing, i cant
`coins`
yes
<@!154722817412300800> but talking is one of the main ways to get kiricoins!
We're hammering out some numbers at the moment. Once we're done with that we'll detail all the different ways to get coins.
You can even generate them yourself if you want to put in the effort.
Nope! We're gonna have a whole lot of ways to generate coins.

CR isn't working on my laptop
which episode was it? 8?
check the credits
also it's never stated who dresses Chris in Miku's clothes the first time
also chris has no panties on during the entire scene
with is a strong word here
miku meeting chris and miku making up with hibiki?
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
where's the porn
why is this in <#336297840529899522> *what do you have planned*
iirc it's actually the okonomiyaki shop
so miku meeting chris would be 9
If it's 9 or 10 it's definitely 10
although that might be the episode where Miku straddles Hibiki I'm thinking of
It's an alley isn't it? I think it's 8 or 9
sticky bottom... <:KirikaWhat:336657327325315084>
Headcanon: Tsubasa had weird fetishes she never told Kanade about before she died so when Tsubasa crossed worlds in XDU and met alternate world Kanade she managed to convince alternate world Kanade to go along with them
I have not read the GenjuuRyoko fic as I am gay trash
I mean, even in the Chris/Maria one, it's pretty obviously consensual. Sure, Chris didn't EXPECT  a stilleto in her ass but it was pretty clear she didn't mind it after the fact
well a good chunk of them contain characters in relationships, either established by fanon within the fic, or just canon relationships
oh
it's tagged appropriately isn't it?
Didn't kirishira get Chris to agree to have sex with them in the first place? And then later Chris dominantly fucked the shit out of Kirika?
It's been a while since I read a helping hand but isn't that the kirishirachris one? I'm more concerned where their dicks came from.
yes

<@246146781832806401> I don't know the person you're replying to there, and posting that is liable to just start a huge argument as this person may be simply looking for a fight.

I CAN FEEL MY LEG AGAIN
dilation is for the rest of my life, but immediately following surgery is when i have to do it the most (and when it hurts the most I presume)
oh, yeah. forever.
physio?
i mean, theyre both pretty permanent, one is just more fun than the other
i dont know if im more excited for surgery or the new hearthstone expansion
6 weeks of no masturbation iirc
3 months of no sex
recovery is a week in the hospital followed by 1-2 months of nothing
oh its been treasured already
yeah, i have preop stuff to do on tuesday, cleansing on wednesday, and then thursday morning is my last chance to take a dick pic ever
yeah
look i only had myself as a reference point. years of hormones have done things
first time i had sex with someone though my reaction was just "holy shit dicks can get big" and that was when the night ended
I mean yeah, that's normal
maybe they've never had sex and dont understand how nerve wracking it actually is the first few times?
“You breathe a word of this to anyone and I tell Maria what you've been doing with the bananas she packs you for lunch.”
its got one of your best lines tho
the only thing about exichrisionism that throws me off is <:Elfnein:336656417035517952> but you already said you arent doing more of her
you do and honestly I'm so far gone that exhibitionism doesnt even refister to me as being kinky
miku has a picture of hibiki as her phone's lock screen
and given miku's typical reaction to hibiki
i mean, hibimiku is established in canon
gone
But on the other hand, when I get turned on I'm just fucking
But now I need to like, actually be turned on for it to be distracting
It's actually really nice because when I had a dick, an erection just made me horny due to a feedback loop of >get erection >erection stimulates itself >get harder
So like I'll get this vague squeezing sensation near the vaginal vault but nothing more
I... kinda get the sensation of an erection? But none of the erectile tissue have any erectile muscles operating it anymore
(so bottoming out is less painful I imagine)
And also I don't have a cervix or anything behind it
Everything is rewired. It's pretty much exactly the same as a natal vagina, except the clit might work a bit differently regarding swelling during arousal
Turns out I can't just pump my fingers in and out and then orgasm after a while
How soon I'll figure out the logistics of this are unknown to me
I'm *allowed* to masturbate whenever I want
you have like 3 fics you're working on
send me smut for my birthday
how the FUCK do i masturbate
i experienced it
there are few things more terrifying than someone inserting scissors inside of your vagina
🤔
no i do not want a finger hastily jammed up my cunt without warning
jfc my surgeon just does whatever without regard for how it affects me
not soon
which is
i can touch myself just as soon as the pain doesn't get in the way
i swear to god by thanksgiving i better be more stuffed than the turkey
fgdthdtjyfkjhdgsrgrd
im being taunted
i still can't masturbate life is hell
I dunno, you're missing out
it's like shoving something up your butt for the first time
what the fuck
This specifically is just like
im not in pain this is just the weirdest pressure i have ever felt on my body
holy SHIT going from standing for 45~60 minutes to sitting with an inflamed vagina is weird
Well you have that same hole with a vagina so if you're using the urethra you're still doubling your options
Having a vagina is a lot like having a dick that you can put things in
I've read 3 chapters i think
"nope, done"
i just went and was like
i read a genderswap manga once where there was a scene with a room full of fat old men
two good het ll doujins
ive read like
yuri only ever gets really dedicated artists so its a safe choice
pretty much. i basically refuse to touch any het stuff of either series due to how mixed it is
yes, but if you're discussing the shipping of symphogear characters I'd encourage you to use <#357682999300718592>

why does my go to bdsm doujin have to be het

i dont fuck mothers
wheres all the hibimiku bdsm porn
that just adds orgasm denial into the mix
id like to be tied up, have a vibrator jammed in me, and left there like that

DOUBLE shark girldick
like what about a shark girldick
monster dicks tho
write it naturally then go back and edit?
it's really god damn distracting
sometimes i tried to fight it but i never won
i just woke up horny the weeks leading into surgery
it sucked
when i went off hormones for surgery prep i was masturbating basically every day because my dick wouldn't calm down
Good smut just destroys me and all I can think about is sex
only hibiki is allowed to suck miku's girlcock <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
what did you think it said?
from https://archiveofourown.org/works/5050459
Miku met Genjuuro's eyes first, her face contorting in horror. She pulled back from Hibiki, her cock sliding out of Genjuuro's prize pupil's mouth with a wet pop. Hibiki leaned forward to chase it for a moment before her brain registered that the door was open, with one of her closest friends and the one adult she respected most staring at her sucking her girlfriend's dick. For a moment she didn't care. For just a moment she thought Go ahead and watch, you'll never get this. Then her mind processed exactly who it was standing in the doorway, and she yanked a sheet up and over as she pulled Miku down, covering Miku's embarrassed form.

I have convinced my mom to buy me expensive sex toys for science. I don't think she's 100% sold on it being purely for medical reasons but hey, $500 I don't have to spend.
f-list
uhhhh probably
so basically I just have the ability to clench my urethra and I dunno if natal vaginas can do that
my clit doesn't hold that much blood
I mean the sensation of having an erection is just

blood flowing to your dick
No I think with the vagina muscles now
It does a different thing now though
I still have my dick muscle
I mean
And for the swelling to go down quicker.
I got it so that the nerves would hook back up quicker
Well I kinda did
I didn't get it for masturbation
I mean
It's not a go inside vibrator its a "back massager"
I have a vibrator but it hurts more than anything now that I have sensation
It's a matter of "are my nerves hooked up enough" and "did I do the thing right"
I should be able to
But no orgasm
I figured out a thing I can do with my clit which feels pretty damn good
I don't know
Day 107 of no nut november
on my way to japan
ok but think of the masturbatory applications
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
whats the mystery doujin tho
im gonna assume that since you're in Japan, you found the doujin in a weird store in Akiba and were masturbating in public
https://exhentai.org/g/795699/6b04c51e7b/ Here's good het BDSM without humiliation, but it's not femdom
I'm gonna go binge Astolfo doujins
More along those lines, there's an eerie amount of otokonoko doujins that make me go "that character is fucking trans". Is this surprising? Probably not. https://exhentai.org/g/1049206/62a1e81f47/ Boku ga Onnanoko ni Natta Hi. This one isn't even femdom. Depending on who you ask it might not even have any girls. But fuck it I'm linking it here anyway it's good.
Also you know what, it's not tagged as yuri but fuck me if Kaoru isn't written as a trans girl, https://exhentai.org/g/815990/11c9fc23fb/ Hatsu Date wa Lingerie Shop. Femdom with a trans girl/otokonoko depending on view point as the sub.
https://exhentai.org/s/23e833fa31/553678-21 also this one page is really good
Out of all of those, the 8 pages from Microne Magazine are my favorite.

I

I might be biased towards size content.
Yuri femdom is hard to find. Most of it is garbage with yuri tacked on to get more people to read it. 
https://dynasty-scans.com/series/corruptions_finale Corruption's Finale contains femdom, but probably crosses the violence line for wfc. Also the ending sucks. 
https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/the_dogs_desire_and_the_reality_of_discipline The Dog's Desire and the Reality of Discipline took me like 2 days to finish and is pretty good.
https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/say_the_word Say the Word is good, but it's humiliation.
https://exhentai.org/g/662105/e5b0162ac6/ The Rules of Zero is good, but it's BDSM again. Lighter than Corruption's Finale though. Also apparently has more parts that are untranslated.
https://exhentai.org/g/553678/dd9beed2ae/ Part of Microne Magazine 6 has yuri femdom, but it's F/f size content. No violence though, just size stuff.
Yes. Anything more specific than just femdom you want?
It sounds fantastic. Also I'm not getting any dildos or eggs with it. Those can come later.
Electroplay is fun.
Also they're not fun.
There are. They hurt and are hard to do to myself.
I didn't make this choice.
Black and yellow or pastel pink
Look. Sex toy websites come in two flavors.
My vaginal muscles are constantly tense. It's painful to put things in and probably painful for someone to stick their dick in.
No not at all
No
Also 3) It might loosen up my vagina
1) Funsies
2) It might stimulate faster nerve regeneration so I can fucking masturbate.
Generally you place the electrodes on or around the genitals, but you can get special toys designed to work with the device that you can put inside
and bzzap
and turn it on
stick it on you
HOW
did you never look?
i dont fucking ge that
Ok, there's three holes, and of the two on the front, only one is actually noticeable.
It's been over half a year of me having a vagina and honestly at this point I cannot comprehend all the doujins which are like "no, lower" whenever there's het sex. There's only two holes and it's *really* fucking obvious which is the right one.

ive never watched the series so i have nothing but go wild https://dynasty-scans.com/doujins/girls_und_panzer
doujin, fanfic, or art?
It just blends into the rest of the organ
<@456226577798135808> see, the issue with this, is that unless you've already been fucking the urethra, *it's too small to see without it being pointed out*
`also, everyone sucks as sex because few places properly educate people in it
eyes peehole
"ah yes, this is where i stick it, yeah"`
You're not doing anything by putting your fingers there
That shit happens automatically when you open your legs
More issues: that thing where a girl uses her fingers to spread herself

Yeah got a high score

I love living in New York, but I hate living in America. Can we just move the entire city to France or something
"You are literally working too much, take a break"
<@174440042289168384> that honestly can be extended past gender. It's like how in America, we're expected to work nonstop, meanwhile you look at Spain or France and they have like, mandatory vacations.
<@285555416056856576> we need to watch Kokoro Connect
Did it? Do I need to watch Kokoro Connect?
I got surgeries to feel more comfortable in my body but that was because of social pressure. In a different society maybe I wouldn't have felt the need to.
Honestly are bodies really gendered? If we accept that gender is a social construct - and that's a pretty important part of accepting genderfluidity - then biology doesn't really have a part and everyone's body is just... their body, you know? It's like that Eddie Izzard comment about how he doesn't wear girl's clothes, he just wears *his* clothes.
I did make this server with the express intent of creating a more welcoming space for different kinds of people than the previous server was. So I'm glad that's panning out.
I flop between female and agender (or girl/neither) but usually just describe myself as an agender girl to avoid confusion because the flopping is honestly like... this tiny feeling that doesn't really impact much
I just dont advertise it
I'm genderfluid
second*
Maybe you like Symphogear because of who you are
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
You can always DM me about anything or just ping me wherever, I like helping people
I also wanna touch on the "i doubt I will have the time to continue caring this much about my body" thing. Don't push it to the side, you don't wanna find yourself starting transition a year or four from now and saying "well shit, shoulda done this earlier"
It's like asking someone how their degree is going. Sure you can isolate elements of it but you might as well ask them how their life is.
And it's a lot better than not transitioning because being trans sucks but being closeted sucks harder
You can't separate it from the rest of you because it's just who you are and how you live now
It's a series of events
Transitioning isn't really a discrete event in your life
So you have to engage with the topic on a level higher than "it's just anime"
If media could be entirely separate of its real life counterpart, there'd be no issue, but seeing it endorsed in your entertainment kinda gives this message of "yeah no problem irl either"
It's fetish bait but in the process it normalizes the situation.
Let's not resort to ad hominem arguments
You're told that family is above all else and that creates some weird dynamics even in sibling-sibling interactions
Personally my stance on this comes from several CSA victims who were pushed into this exact situation
Yeah but it's still gross
The context here is anime tropes, and I don't actually know of any anime incest situation where both characters are of age
But if that thing is like, a sex thing? Younger me wouldn't be in the best position to just handle it properly.
And I do. If either of us asks each other to do a thing we'll do it.
It's like, I'm supposed to get along with my brother, right?
I have a strong support system within the rest of my family, but if someone without that support were to have their sibling make a move on them, I dunno if I'd call that 100% consensual.
It's mostly the grooming. Growing up with someone makes lines of consent with them a bit fuzzy.
I'll do an announcement a bit later concerning it
We can 100% do kokoro connect with the server
All the nordic countries seem pretty nice
tbh most of Western Europe would be a damn sight better than America
waifuism and such
Also <@279341087494242304> This community is the only place I've found other than twitter, which is hand-picked, where het is looked down upon. Other Symphogear communities I've found are weird and often insistent that Hibiki isn't *really* gay it's just Miku
It's an attack on trans people in general and more specifically nonbinary genders, of which I am both
identify as an attack helicopter etc etc
The amount of times I ask people not to make helicopter jokes only to be met with some asshole response is more than I'd like
Not sure I agree that the anime community is fully aware of themselves.
Ehhhhhhh
See: Undertale
And it's because incest is normalized within anime communities
But then we can view this on an active level. The general population in America will be visibly disgusted at the mere mention of incest, but when you look at anime communities, everyone's like "incest is wincest lol"
Well, that's the whole normalization argument. It's not that someone watches a thing and then immediately goes out to do something they wouldn't otherwise do. The issue is that the media is woven into the culture, and over time portraying the same thing time and time again in media will cause people of that culture to just think of it as normal. A big issue along this line are trans rights, where trans people are constantly ridiculed and mocked within media, so coming out for me was full of "so like the guy from silence of the lambs" type shit.
https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/wikipedian_protester.png
one sec
Most violent games I've played portray it as a pretty bad thing.
But do violent games normalize violence?
They are, but by supporting works that adhere to a certain standard and nothing else, that's how media is going to change.
I only consume LGBT+ media that's mindful of what it's saying.
I mean, yeah. I constantly want LGBT+ anime to be better and do better.
In a mob, people who would ordinarily not perform certain actions will have their inhibitions lowered.
I'm not sure I agree with that. Mob behavior disproves this pretty well.
It's a clusterfuck built on anime and video game communities.
Except just as art imitates life, life imitates art. If there's media which normalizes misogyny, then people IRL consuming that media will be more misogynistic. See: 4chan
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they
Hasn't been incorrect for centuries.
That's a tangent though
While getting outright angry at that may certainly be an overreaction, there's actually merit to that. Why is "he" the default instead of "they"?
The overreaching is a bit of a boogieman. I'm certainly an "SJW" by many people's definitions, as are many of my friends. Most conflict I encounter is people instigating stuff with me or my friends, absent of that it's just angry ranting on twitter and proper activism.
And with that point on games vs books, where is the normalization being propagated from? Movies certainly do a lot of the heavy lifting here, as do books and TV.
This is actually another point to touch on normalization from. Books are normalized within our culture, so when a child shows an interest in reading, parents are often encouraging of it and will do anything to support that interest. Video games are still regarded as infantile so when a child shows an interest in gaming, parents just view it the same as legos or dolls, an expense to keep the child happy.

Slowly that's changing as more gamers become parents, but then you get the adult side where an adult who shows an interest in reading, they're viewed as mature and intelligent, while an adult who shows an interest in games is viewed as childish and immature.
Part of the issue is that early video games weren't really thoughtful or deep, so they were disregarded as children's toys. Now that the stories have caught up with other mediums, video games still struggle to be regarded seriously, and so the communities around video games often have the more intellectual and philosophical people self-selecting themselves out of it because there's just a bunch of manchildren whining about SJWs everywhere.
And the messages they tend to convey
And, yeah, I'm with Rukia. Books and video games are just mediums, the difference is with the people who participate in the communities surrounding them.
Inclusive isn't really the word, since it's more just made nerd/gamer culture more gatekeepy
There's a special kind of awful you find in nerd/gamer culture
If certain things are left unchecked within a community they'll grow into hideous monsters and you see this with nerd/gamer culture being absolutely awful
What R said, basically
But back to the incest thing, the issue itself is that people within anime communities joke about it. It's a gradual shift and it should be fought imo. First you have incest in media, then you've got incest jokes, one after another you'll go right down to actual incest in the end and it needs to be pushed against. I realize that's a slippery slope argument, but at the same time, this image exists for a reason https://pics.me.me/gamers-hmm-i-dont-know-if-i-should-go-down-29120705.png
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
splinter sounding
do away with that nonsense gendering of inanimate objects
<@279341087494242304> that's more an argument in favor of gender neutrality than anything else imo
Similarly, I absolutely despise it when people say "bro" or "man" to me
Like, I won't call someone dude unless I know how they feel about it.
You've never been to New York. If someone says "guys" to a group that's gender neutral as far as I'm concerned. I do consciously avoid any language that could be gendered if I don't know someone else's stance on it.
"guys" can be gender neutral, but it's context dependent
I disagree with that but I'm biased
But singular they is right 100% of the time
Because default he is just... wrong 50% of the time
tbh, it wasn't something I thought about either until I heard a friend repeatedly use he for all of my opponents while we were playing hearthstone, and I was like "okay, you're a girl, I'm agender, we need to change how we speak"
(R be a little less aggressive please)
The point I'm making, and which R is... slightly more aggressively making, is that you do it unconsciously sometimes anyway, and the time spent changing that to unconsciously doing it all the time is time well spent.
Rukia, you did use singular they right after saying it wasn't convenient
Except that's gonna be inaccurate 50% of the time for me. I am and present androgynously, so there are very few cues as to which pronoun I use in social situations. It often takes multiple corrections and it's tiring.
it's 2 more buttons
I say they 100% of the time if I don't know the person's preferred pronouns
Except if the gender is unknown, why default to "he"?

Let's uh. Let's not make light of suicide attempts.
I almost tried to stab my heart with a shard of glass once and I mean it wouldn't have worked? But fuck if I wasn't trying.
It's the intent I worry about, not necessarily what they're using
It's not but suicidal people are not the most logical of thinkers.

<@!284390402210136064> No therapist is going to tell you whether you're trans or not, for the record. That's not their job. Their job is to listen to you and help you along, not to tell you what to do or who you are.
Can't have transphobia if all the trans kids are dead 🙃
pretty much
i mean the heat is being used one way or another
fuck you entropy

Okay but then why is there a dildo attached
what is the point of this when you can just fuck someone without a dildo
i am beyond done
SAME FUCKING SIZE BUT THE TIP IS JUST WHAT THE DICK
Here is the dilator I use daily
Here is the vibrator I can't fucking use
what is the difference
yes
and i can't fucking deal
an extra half inch of girth right at the front
the tip makes it like
eight months since i was last able to masturbate
IM SO FUCKING DONE
ITS BEEN EIGHT MONTHS
THE TIP IS THIS ODD ALIEN SHAPED MONSTER
BUT THE TIP
AND IF I PUT IT IN BACKWARDS IT'D FIT
THE LENGTH OF IT IS NORMAL
LIKE
IT'S NOT TOO BIG IN ITS ENTIRETY
AND JUST
SO I GET THE VIBRATOR
And today I'm like "okay I should probably use this or whatever"
So I got a vibrator.

Two actually.

It's not legally required to be there. Discord can say "server owners gotta manage it" but they didn't, so I'm not responsible.
You have to confirm you're over 18 to access any NSFW channels on discord
You've lied at least once, but I don't know which is the lie, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
But, hey, discord has a disclaimer built in so ~not my problem~
That's... not how it works
What if you don't graduate?
Until now you've been relying on them for uni, but since that seems to be stopping
Can you file a report against your parents and see if there are any ways to get away from them using the law?
Can you get out of state?
What about beyond Florida?
Even with a missing persons report.
They can't make you go back to them if you don't consent.
Can you get to a city where you WOULD survive the nights homeless?
I say this with complete sincerity, so please don't think I'm taking the piss: Have you given homelessness a serious thought? A few months on the streets saving up money might honestly be a better option than what you're going through.
This is true, but it's easier when there aren't many ties to sever.
Yeah, even if this year proves to not get you anywhere, it's not the end.
You can try a different city or state. One way tickets aren't too expensive.
If they don't do their job, go to the dean.
I know my university would allow you to reschedule due to acts of domestic abuse. Talk to a counselor about it. That's their job.
Shelters aren't meant for a permanent residence, and violence still occurs within them, so they're a "I know exactly what I need to do and how long it's going to take me" option
My grandfather was equally a piece of shit, I wouldn't say it's impossible.
Plus the freedom to move will facilitate actually leaving when the time comes.
From there you'll be able to have your own money that he can't touch.
I'm not close to your situation, so I can't say for sure, but I'd say go with your dad after the divorce. From what I know, he seems less volatile and easier to go off on your own doing things, so you can get a bank account set up and what not.
Between your mother and your father, which one would you have more opportunities to get away from unsupervised periodically?
They sound less likely to kill you
I'd go with the spiteful rich snobs
which will be easier to sneak away from once you have money
Okay, so wait, where are you going once they divorce, again?
what are you gonna do tonight?
and then i keep acting like an idiot because im an idiot
I just go to cons and act like an idiot until i make a new friend
i dunno where you live so i dunno how easy that is
you could also do other things. just... do fun things. with people. in person.
in my experience you just show up
have you tried like... going to parties or something? How old are you?
just having fun?
like
have you tried not thinking of other people as asses?
also, better than what part of your personality do you want to change, what part of your *life* do you want to change?
and even if you can't do that, fake it
so honestly one of the best things i can say is be interested in things and be ready to have fun sometimes
and in the end I'm just like... i'm not having fun with someone who acts like that
"diablo"
"let's play this shitty game and laugh about it!"
"not interested, diablo"
"hey let's go see this movie!"
like i used to know someone who at EVERY suggestion of something to do is like "nah im just gonna play diablo"
like there are so many things you CAN do that it's easier to focus on what NOT to do
weed helps. being interested in things also helps.

an egg is a trans person who isn't out to themselves yet
Before I started transitioning, I only ever had an illusion of happiness. There were moments where I wasn't in agony, sure, but transitioning let me feel actually happy.
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
rambling is fine
never settle for good enough
except me i said fuck it and went in head first
i mean all trans people are afraid that way
yeah, most cis people... dont have long and repeated mental quandaries over their gender

ok hang on lemme get the memes
That or they just haven't figured it out yet
Egg is a term for transgender people who aren't out to themselves yet

TERFs/FITs are just assholes who happen to wave a banner of feminism.
I think TERFs are a separate issue from white feminism. Those people are gonna be hateful no matter what.
In short what I'd say on it to anyone who has a particular privilege is just "You're privileged. Do what you can with it and make a better world."
Yeah, but that's where you need to make the whole thing more complex. All the different privileges mix together and form one huge privilege and  instead of breaking it up into little pieces that don't make sense to those who have it, just say "you have *more* privilege"
Sure, you can be white, and that puts you into a position where you might be able to make a better world for non-white people, but if you're broke and on the streets how are you going to enact that?
There's also the fact that a lot of people like to frame it as "white privilege" "straight privilege" etc which just doesn't work. imo, there's "this person has more privilege in this area than this other person"
```the whole attacking those who are born into something to be unfair```

that's where the most common misunderstanding falls. "You have privilege" isn't an attack, although many people who might say that are terrible at framing it as anything else. It's a call to arms. It's saying "You have this power that other people don't. Use it."

This was touched upon in the video, when the guy got to the top of the ladder and was given the choice to sacrifice his own gain for the benefit of those with lesser status. On the topic of "not using your privilege", that's not a thing. Even if you don't try to, you always benefit from that privilege. It's like seeing a group of people stuck in a cage that's being slowly lowered into a pool of lava. You have two levers in front of you, one that will make the cage go faster, and one that will make the cage stop and free everyone inside. Choosing not to pull either lever is still a dick move, it's just less of a dick move than pulling the lever that makes it go faster.
Someone who already believes that there's an SJW takeover in America isn't going to change their mind, but someone who hasn't made up their mind is much easier to have a conversation with.
I don't think the video is necessarily for those who've already made up their mind. It's more for the "on the fence" types.
Then the issue becomes, there's just not enough content talking about privilege, trans rights, human rights, there are things that should exist but they just don't.
Probably.
In fact, I probably wouldn't have realized that This Is America is a social commentary without having it explicitly pointed out to me beforehand.
Like, I needed someone to explain This Is America to me because I'm not black and I'm not poor. I don't see any of the issues that This Is America was highlighting on my own.
That's fair. And probably would turn off someone who's on the fence on any given issue. But what would go on the cards in its place? You have to make sure people know what the video is *about* at the same time.
Never said that was the case, but how would you propose the message be conveyed differently if your goal is to get privileged people to stand up for nonprivileged people?
I suppose, but how else do you get the point across to people who don't already believe it? "Civil discussion" doesn't really work when the argument is minority vs majority
Okay so I watched the video and - I don't see anything wrong with the message I think it's trying to convey? Maybe it's heavy handed, but is that necessarily bad?
The way I look at it is, words have power no matter how much they tell you that this isn't true in elementary school. With that in mind, you can either drive someone to suicide with your words, or prevent them from doing it. I like the prevention option more.
And at this point it's easier to destigmatize the words than it is to reclaim them or get people to stop using them.
That's just that example though. There ARE things which probably go past the line of reason. Some people consider words like "dumb", "idiot", or "stupid" to be slurs in the same vein that "retarded" is because they've historically been used medically and were pushed out of medical usage due to the rampancy of people using those words as slurs, but at this point, the words are too common that, unless you're specifically making a server for neurodivergent folk, it's really not worth the time trying to get people to agree with you on that.
The only people you're excluding are people who scream about free speech without understanding what free speech even is
And in the process, you're creating a more inclusive space, regardless of minority status or not
also re: ```stupid "trigger protection" and stuff?``` it takes less time to put something like "CW: Rape" on a tweet than it does to defend your position on why you didn't.
(have not watched the video yet)
the issue with "equal opportunity offense" is that in western culture, cishet white men don't have to deal with a lot of shit, but for people who belong to 2+ minority groups, you're just making a shitty situation shittier
part of why this channel exists
non-trans people love to claim anywhere from 0.01% to 0.9%
I don't believe there's an accurate statistic for that yet
Heteronormativity is slowly going away.

But hey cisnormativity is still there for people to be shitty about 🙃
Straight couple: "Think of the children!" *proceeds to make out in public*
Heteronormativity is what you get when you plaster billboards with het shit and then the second someone sees a gay billboard they're all "I don't wanna see that"
Heteronormativity is the assumption that being straight is standard and anything else is deviant
there's so many layers of shittiness that it's just a fucking shit lasagna
that's the other part of why it's banned here
^
and literally that exact scenario is apparently playing out as we speak
but yeah, the reason trap is banned here is partly just because, if you keep using it for anime characters and no one takes issue with that, eventually you're gonna use it for actual people

and by that point you're so entrenched in that position that anyone who says no is just met with "BUT IT'S JOKE"
banned from the /sgg/ server too
got banned there too after a few weeks
then they popped over to the other server
they're some asshole and they immediately started shit upon arrival
i banned bwen in approximately 5 seconds when he joined here
that's from little shop of horrors
Like I even see trans people call themselves traps, but NO ONE says transvestite.
transvestite is an outdated term for crossdresser I think? Hardly anyone uses it anymore and I know a total of 0 trans people who like having that word used for them.
gross. honestly even if you're using it for anime characters, you're still propagating the idea that it's okay to use for actual humans.
which t word? trap or tranny?
That's nothing new though. Honestly, I say let cishet dudes slide. They have a much bigger voice and any help is good help.
Then again, when the ally is popular, it's hard to have a discussion with them
A lot of queer people like to hate on allies for no reason. Like, I get that they overstep their bounds sometimes but reel it in, it's not like they're Ru Paul
I have no idea what it was about.
Also a bunch of people got angry at Macklemore around the same time and that never made sense to me. Like, here's a famous cishet white dude who has decided to use his name to spread a message of tolerance and ????
That feels like an issue in and of itself to me. There were just too many loud people who denounced those with privilege that the subject became unapproachable. You have to know about an issue to do something about that issue.
honestly the public discourse has moved so far away from privilege by now but it's still this huge thing that no one is talking about?
In the end, it all comes down to ~I N T E R S E C T I O N A L I T Y~
That's true I suppose
that would be a case of "life goals or wife goals"
Last I checked their position was "does not have a gender"
No, but one of them was really weird and spent a lot of time with me since I was their only friend.

at the end of the day, if someone can't respect you for who you are, why bother wasting your time on them?
better than waiting 50 years
sounds solid
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313> night!
...also I got GRS and no longer feel the need to wear pants 24/7 so I guess that's something
I do masculine things, but I don't define myself as masculine
I'm comfortable enough in femininity that I don't feel an urgent need to reclaim any amount of masculinity for myself. It's just one of those "well if people weren't such dicks about it I'd be fine"
I prefer presenting feminine and doing feminine things but if American society wasn't so strung up on girls vs boys I might be more comfortable with masculinity
I'm agender. I use she/they
I was still "one of the guys" and they acted noticeably different in the presence of other women
they never really made a fuss about it, but at the same time, they never really respected it
i ended up dropping my entire friend group from where i live when i came out as trans
okay i dont have memes for this i cant find the post
i got memes for that hang on
Basically, we have no clue how many trans people exist in the world right now, but it's almost definitely more than the reported numbers.
Yeah. Not all trans people experience dysphoria to begin with.
it is
I mean
There's SO little representation, and so much stigmatization that a ton of eggs just never hatch
I'd guess that at least 5% of the world is trans or gnc
But in reality, being trans is so stigmatized that most trans people just don't out themselves
will do
As do most trans women I know
For the record, I masturbated a lot prior to GRS.

that thing i wish i could do
look, if you don't enjoy having your dick sucked then I'm reasonably certain that you might not want a dick
did i link you to portside stories yet?
then, yeah, that sounds like a pretty good time to start experimenting and seeing how people react
Do you feel like you want to BE her or be WITH her
I dunno
I get bummed out every time Lyssa leaves the room so I mean
well that's a good sign
Does she know you're into her?
I have no known solution other than getting so pissed off at something that you have no choice but to be angry instead of depressed
Sometimes I'll cancel appointments and stuff because I just don't feel like trying
I get that. For me it's just a "nothing to be done until it passes" kind of thing
So it's just like... no motivation to do anything and kinda just wanna roll over and sleep forever?
Just zero motivation to do anything
I feel that sometimes.

Oh tons will change.
But also, what Latooni said.
Do keep in mind, some things will change with hormones and you can't go back. Most notably, you will develop breast tissue.
Generally, hormones will require a referral and a letter of approval from a therapist OR if you're lucky enough, you can go to an informed consent clinic.
I went through I think... 4 or 5 therapists before I got hormones.
Yeah, self medding is a real thing and it sucks.
but that's a pretty important question
...aside from the "will this kill you" question
And after being dragged around from therapist to therapist I eventually found a doctor who just gave me hormones no questions asked.
For me I came out to my mom, then my friends, brother, and housekeeper, and then I started therapy.

And then my dad at some point I don't remember exactly that wasn't a happy conversation for me.
Well, then you have more or less two options going forward if you think you wanna transition. You can come out socially (to as many or as few people as you want to), or you can start seeing a therapist about it.
How does it make you feel?
You've mentioned crossdressing before. Have you ever gone outside wearing feminine clothing before?
Partially reversible.
HRT? That's Hormone Replacement Therapy.
Most of it is even reversible.
Well, luckily for you, there's a whole bunch of stuff you're pretty much forced to do before anyone is willing to do GRS for you.
GRS?
I remember the feeling of not wanting muscles at all.
Some people enjoy it and some people don't.
There's nothing wrong wih NOT continuing the line of masculinity.
Totally.
That's a tough situation to be in
What would you have preferred more? Not doing it, or having $20?
Was the experience worth $20?
Are you in a position where you're able to refuse?
Yeah, my dad took a while to figure out what "I'm a girl" meant
Go for it!
And you'd mentioned suicide earlier
No but I didn't know if that was what you meant
Okay so not a metaphor for suicide
Cough?
Meanwhile I only cry when I'm angry. Or when I've been overloaded by cuteness.
gao gao
I cry if I get angry and it's upsetting because a crying angry 5'6'' girl isn't very threatening so no one takes me seriously.
When I was in middle school, there was this girl who I'd always see crying with a book outside and I was always like "girl why you crying so much" because I never cried but now I understand.
(crying because of cute dogs is good crying don't worry they're just so cute you can't help but cry at how cute they are)
Everyone gets hit differently but in general, you'll be more sensitive emotionally and you'll be less horny.
Masturbation went from like 3 times a day to twice a week, I would cry because dogs are really cute, etc
Oh. Yes. Hormonal changes come with emotional changes. Do you cry? If not, you do now.
It should work fine in the link
Weird it works for me
And with that https://gfycat.com/QuaintPerkyCommongonolek
But anyway, yeah, that's a quick rundown of things that HRT does. If absolutely zero of it sounded unappealing to you, and the phrase "You will have breasts for the rest of your life even if you change your mind" does not intimidate you, then you're *probably* trans
But yeah, anything that's salty should do the trick.
I personally like pickles regardless.
Many trans women hate pickles before they start HRT.
I had a ramen phase while I was still on spiro.
And dehydration leads to salty cravings.
Which leads to dehydration.
The most common anti-androgen is spiro. It's a diuretic, so you'll pee a lot.
Also pickles. You'll want pickles.
Oh you'll punch yourself in the boob a lot.
...I still do this occasionally.
The first thing I did was jump up and down for like an hour.
This is normal.
No.

Cat ears sold separately.
But anyway, I believe the first steps are still the same in Canada. Gotta see a therapist, get a referral, get a letter, see an endocrinologist, wait for them to give up on talking you out of it, then you get your titty skittles.
def
I already made out with my best friend and declared her as my girlfriend.
Same ~~except I'm in America where no one has the right to live~~
Canada follows the DSM-V I believe
Yes.
Does Canada cover these things automatically?
That makes it easier... I think?
Where do you live?
~~except for me because I got struck by the shit lottery with my tits~~
Breast size will probably be 1 or 2 sizes down from cis women in your family.
Also look, I have some **T H I C C** thighs
It'll become harder to cut fat as well.
You'll gain more feminine fat distributions across your body, so thicker thighs would be in your future.
You'll gain breasts, body and facial hair will become thinner and less pronounced, head hair will become super boosted. Longer term effects, erections will be harder to maintain, muscle mass will become harder to maintain, penises may shrink without frequent usage.
i have to see my surgeon
random doctor doesnt know shit about neovaginas
i cant see a random doctor for this
bright red means im actually bleeding
dark brown would be granuloma
dark brown is good
red and runny
fuck do i do
dont think its a period either
shit shit shit im bleeding
I didn't have to for the most part!
being trans and famous doesnt seem fun
there are some enormous assholes out there who constantly harass her
She probably removed all pre-transition stuff
she did 25 minutes in a marathon but i cant find her WR run
narci's record is...
The game is generally a few hours long
Former record holder for Ocarina of Time's speedrun
trans speedrunner
assholes got narcissa's twitch channel banned
well, guess i can't spam estrogen emotes anymore
where'd narcissa's twitch go
...huh
anyway it's time for the periodic E spam hang on lemme go get my twitch prime sub ready
that probably wasnt estrogen
Estrogen and spiro are ALSO- yeah that
Trans people just enjoy the benefits of things made for cis people
Do you think people develop things for trans people?
But also yes your mom could have
I may have emoted them here before
Estrogen
I know what can make you cry
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcpzqZrpLVM&start_radio=1&list=RDEMbCEw629nT-xX6HUEoWsVHw>
I tear up listening to RTRT even though I sing along to it every time it comes up.
And yeah megadeth quartet was Good Content
Oh, another thing estrogen will do is make your skin thinner, so you'll bruise more easily and you'll get cold more easily. But also this makes your skin look fantastic.
War never changes
War
It was just an abrasion. It's stopped bleeding now.
it's apparently scarier than it looks
I was going to play more Mutiny!! today but I don't think porn is a very good idea right now
monday
Gnos - to know. Agnos - to not know.
Agnosticism is the belief of maybe there is, maybe there isn't, I'll make up my mind when someone shows me proof. wfc is describing theism without religion.
I'm just astonished that some people call themselves feminists while at the same time condemn depictions of women owning their sexuality.
There's nothing explicit there
Yeah but the screenshots on my twitter amount to "Grace being horny"
...even if it's hot
not even. they're probably clinging on to my mutiny posts but i dont even view mutiny as porn
A TERF found some of my tweets and called me "gross" and "porn obsessed" for making sex-positivity posts and honestly I love it because in the course of doing literally nothing I pissed off a transphobe.
Yeah.
That's why I don't.
I know I can't.
I'm gonna go out and say that I would ban usage of idiot, dumb, and stupid due to their relatively recent usage as slurs, but that would be way too hard to enforce consistently and it would cripple vocabulary any time you need to say something is the opposite of smart.
okay, that might've been out of line on my part
Here is my official response on "do you want to discuss this"
That's not a discussion, that's enforcement being kind enough to tell you why it's wrong rather than simply telling you not to do it because I arbitrarily said so.
I started no conversation. I told you not to break a rule, and then I told you why it's a rule to begin with.
Yes. Because I didn't want to talk about it. And so DMing me about it was pointless.
You can ask someone else, but I'm not looking to talk about it right now. Article in question for y'all is https://andrearitsu.com/2017/12/01/re-trap/
So it's not
It might not be a slur but it'll be an insult.
I think we're getting lost in the discussion. If enough people use "hello" derogatorily with enough frequency and enough consistence, then sure, it's gonna be an insult
Asshole - not banned on this server (unless you direct it at someone)
i dunno if i can deal with *only* 16 genders
that doesn't work for me yorin, I'm nb
Language doesn't dictate what's offensive, society does.
Pretty much
👀
I nver said fight. I said look.
Retard as a verb is not banned here, but it's so far out of anyone's vocab that I'd be giving them some looks if they used it.
That information is actually pinned in announcements
Retarded is banned here, for the record
fuckboy is an insult, but not a slur
please define assbungler
I can call a white dude an assbungler, doesn't fucking mean anything because I'm the only one doing it.
Likewise, if you only use this insulting hello towards a specific group of people, it becomes a slur.
Also kerrik, keep it on topic
no one's being blamed, I'm just saying that due to the history, the word is pretty offensive in America
am glad to hear this wasn't what i was talking about
i uh
We kinda sent Japanese people to concentration camps
I dunno how it is over in England, but jap is pretty racist in the states <@!284390402210136064>
something about muslims
wasn't brexit fueled by racism?
That's one of the most important points about privilege
You don't see what you're not trained to see
I get scolded for my shit
cannabinoids vs opioids
weed probably won't put me in the same kind of drugged state that oxycodone does
also I'm not looking for a trip, I need to know what gets me adequately high so i can just ignore the pain from electrolysis
(i fucking hate it)
delicious
15mg THC
TIME TO EXPERIMENT WITH DRUGS
oh right i should test weed now before it's too late
have not tried on thongs yet but my ass eats underwear anyway so what's the difference
especially when she got me a thong and I'm just sitting there like "mom i have a dick"
my mom actively bought me underwear and that feels a bit strange when you're in your late teens/early twenties
...although even with a vagina they fit more or less the same
ive always just gotten my own underwear
i think my rope got tossed so i need to buy more
rope will fix many things
but what about a collar
...I should wear some of Lyssa's clothing sometime
halfway there already
Also apparently you need to get a really big shirt now
Oh hey Lyssa just opened discord hi <@285555416056856576> remember that time I used your arm as a pillow.
The closest I've gotten is using Lyssa's arm as a pillow.
I actually don't know how some people can hold on to something for an entire night in their sleep
I mean sure, but even as someone who sleeps naked and with the AC on, real person >>>>>>> daki
daki covers are a god damn scam and the pillows aren't even close to satisfying the same needs that hugging an actual person does
Don't know who I've appointed as the other Custodian if that weren't the case
I uh
I'm pretty sure my girlfriend is 3D
why do you think my avatar is grace
yeah same
I generally deal with my state of perpetual horniness by having my back kissed while I'm still half asleep and... other things I'm not sure I should share
NYS*
But hardly anyone would actually do that
I could be legally fired, kicked out of my house, tons of shit, just for being trans
NYC is a weird place, politically. The community is hugely accepting, but the law offers no protection.
I'm in NYC. The state doesn't like to make it easy.
oh
where do you get those?
15 mg THC - not doing a whole lot
Yeah. It's why I try to talk to people always. Because I know there are good people saying vile shit and they just need a push in the right direction.
I'm capable of being aware of my identity because some of the things I was ripping on started to make sense
That shouldn't be necessary, but it's what got me to where I am
I'm not saying it's okay to be bigoted, but I'm capable of having sympathy for race issues precisely because I was a massive racist pile of shit earlier in my life.
People who are capable of changing, and who  look back at themselves and where they've been and know *exactly* how shit goes down
So many of the "SJWs" that some people like to vilify are forged within the communities vilifying them
but in doing so, they showed me what was going on and I was able to step away and say "no, this is real, the thing you are mocking is real"
because they deny the existence of privilege
which is fucking weird
Some parts of my life are shit, money isn't one of them. I was lucky enough to hang around on /r/tumblrinaction during its early days, and they exposed me to the concept of privilege.
I think the only sympathy I deserve in that regard - that anyone with any privilege deserves - is that they have their privilege pointed out respectfully and civilly.
I coast by using support from my family but in the process I try to be mindful of what I have that others dont
queer millenials have an even shittier hand
Yeah, millenials have a shit hand
I'm disabled and can't work so helping people out with their issues is a way for me to be productive
So I like to spend as much of my time helping people as I can
For all the shit I have to go through, I'm still pretty lucky
he's a surgeon
my dad's insurance also paid for GRS
and doctors
rich ass lawyer family
maybe not kill, that's the oppposite of what i want
i'd kill for national healthcare
pls
please give us adequate healthcare
like
just fucking
surgery number two: that's where you're wrong
my surgeries were the worst. After I got my first surgery done my response was "nothing can fucking hurt more than this"
i just pretend i do
im really glad i dont actually have any form of chronic pain
everyone is trained to act like it's the dustbowl so that opioids don't wind up on the black market
the worst part is how hard it is to get on pain meds legitimately
opioids do work, but only at higher dosages and not for very long
naturally
like
im resistant to opioids and apparently cannabinoids
i'm trying to get that high without needing to dangerously up the oxy dosage
oxycodone doesn't help with acute pain like electrolysis, it just makes me high
I just wanna get high and lie down
im not looking for pain relief either exactly
that's why I'm testing weed out. I don't wanna end up on dangerously high dosages of oxycodone
narcotics do nothing to me without absurdly high dosages
yeah, and i'm apparently a damned fortress
fine mom
headacheeeeeeee
i just put the oil under my tongue and wait
i'm not smoking it
i can distinctly feel that my left eye is more open than my right eye but i know this isn't true because my left eye is the one that's always half losed
clockwise
medical marijuana
also it's cannabis oil
okay the weed is definitely doing somethings and the text on the screen is turning like hands on a clock
mostly the sore throat side effects
the weed may be doing something but im not liking the side effects im getting right now
ok i might be allergic to weed
safer and cheaper
voice training is the recommended option
vocal surgery has a decent chance of failing and turning you mute
being so gay takes a lot of energy
vocal surgery is scary
more common than redheads iirc
We've had to rebuild our *existence* all in the past 60 years
Nazis burned a lot of scientific trans literature during WW2
Trans people have been around for centuries. We're just finally getting around to letting them exist.
They aren't being "turned"
If trans people get more support, we're gonna see an ever increasing population of trans people.
I suppose. But, in the end, the other discords don't have as much of an out trans population. Why? No one's standing up for them.
Like, why Symphogear?
I'm running a Symphogear discord and we're flooded with trans people.
I wouldn't be surprised if 5~10% of the population was trans
There's tons of trans people everywhere. Cis people just like to bury the numbers.
Housing is expensive, so unless you've lived here or near here all your life, it's not a good choice for moving when you're trans
There are decent trans communities here. Mostly in Brooklyn I think.
Of course, most libertarians just want an excuse to commit hate crimes without getting in trouble
In a way, it's kind of a libertarian dream. The state does nothing and the communities police themselves.
but yeah. you'll be hard pressed to find bigotry in the average NYC resident unless they're some sort of rich person who might have been given a small loan of a million dollars, but there are no laws protecting me
precisely
i dont know how much of me talking right now is the weed
i know he was abusive
but i know he was there
i dont remember much about y father growing up
i dont know
but as my father he causes too much pain
and he can't act as my father like that
i can't see him as my father like that
even if he's in my life in that way
but
not knowing who he is might be good
if i ever saw him again
so
stage 3
a bad one
last time i tried to see him i had a panic attack
dont know what to make of them
having thoughts about forgetting my father
i'd rather meet him as a stranger than as my father
good first step
i think im starting to forget what my father looks like
alright yeah, weed should get me through electro
16 is when my shell cracked
i dont really remember much of my life from earlier than age 16
mostly because childhood abuse
there are blanks in my memory too
ANYWAY
bout an hour ago
i dont remember when okay there are timestamps here whe did i take the weed
o
adrenaline
fucking sipping water like its scotch
this is alice power hour making references that no one except ibu and dragon will get
...but it is a nice hat
i respect your life choices but that sounds absolutely bonkers
why
i
.
ok im high
condensation is gonna ruin my cards
i dont have coasters
i dont know why i did this
i passed it
theres a water bottle on my desk behind me
i got a glass of water
No. R is the first mate. You're a crew member. But now that I'm not high anymore lets discuss that somewhere more appropriate.
ok fuck it <@456226577798135808> im high please be the server captain for a bit
not serious discussion topic
but again
fry chicken
you can just
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
the memory bits sure
im not entirely sure the food discussion belongs here
maybe ill get something from dominos without getting a pizza
worse
i think chinese is worth than pizza tbh
yeah
id rather order food. im clumsy naturally no need to make a mess.
but i hunger
just get a pizza
so i dont wanna like
im on a diet
whats something good to eat while im high
yeah i think im high
everything is very strange
i dont know if im forgetting something right now
they came back slowly but i dont know if forgot something that day
completely without any memories
that time i passed out, i woke up just
maybe the discussion is bringing some bad stuff to the forefront and the weed is letting it happen uninhibited
maybe both
i can feel my memory slipping right now and i dont know if it's something repressed trying to surface or if it's the weed
but it was weird and unpleasant
i dont know what i remembered in that moment
after i woke up i couldn't remember anything
and fall asleep
but my reaction to that was to just go wideyed
i think i remembered something that i'd suppressed at some point
memory gaps
but yeah
food
thats the weed
...food
im not that high
nah im gonna remember this
Real good way to get me to never talk to you again
I've had people play with lighters around me and refuse to stop
Same thing with fire
I'm probably too lenient
Dumb friends are still friends
If they refused to pay, *then* I'd press charges
That's a tough situation. I'd ask the friend to pay for hospital bills and leave it at that if it were me.
yeah a bit
at ~11:00 so far so just barely halfway through
he makes some okay points but mixes up definitions constantly that it's hard to believe he's not doing it on purpose
not yet, thankfully
yeah ive actually got a huge comment im writing up just addressing shit as i go
I'm not done yet but I'd like to share this wonderful frame with all of you
Gonna finish it at home where I'm not on a tiny mobile screen
I've watched three minutes and I already think the dude is a twat.
just keep them appropriate
as long as im captain of this ship there is no meme-free channel
The thing is, there isn't even really fighting. It's just harassment. Fighting implies both sides are going at it.
Also the creative side watches Symphogear and the other side doesn't.
But I mostly just want people to stop fighting.
If I was forced to pick a side, I'd go with the creative side immediately. They're more insightful and they say more things I care about.
But it's not always like this? It just happens sporadically, sometimes in response to the victim doing or saying something, sometimes just randomly.
It does.
This is only really coming up in force now because I'd actually gone a year or so without talking to the main shit talker (she had soft blocked me because I talk to her target) and when I refollowed the main shit talker, she immediately refollowed and DMed me an apology? And just recently the victim had to lock her account because of hate she was receiving and now everyone is sharing their "haha this person is so dumb" stories and ????????? I don't get it
I definitely talk to people on the not talking shit side more. Between the two sides, that one has more people who are creative or post about social issues more often, so like... I feel like I should just be comfortable with dumping the non-creative side save for a few people? But then because twitter is ass, I'll stop seeing half of the non-creative side's tweets, and I still wanna see their tweets even if they're interacting with someone I'm not following?
Usually I enjoy the not talking shit side more? But there are people on both sides who I like.
Like my mutuals are pretty much split into two groups. There's the girl who everyone keeps talking shit about and then there's the people talking shit, and there's very little overlap of people who speak to both sides.
maybe both
not really sure at this point
I genuinely enjoy some of the things these people say? But the few times they just start up into their hatefuckball I'm sitting here like "all of you people have this person blocked, maybe drop it? it's been 4 years?"
So on a different note, there's this weird hate cult surrounding one of my friends on twitter and I'm very confused and upset. I don't want to unfollow 24 mutuals just to make sure I don't see this crap but also calling it out is liable to make the entire hate fuckball they have going on explode in my face
I'm making a game. I don't expect it to have a huge audience. I'm making what I think needs to exist in the world. Similarly, comedians can make the jokes they think should exist, but no one needs to listen to them.
Comedians can say what they want. I don't think they should in some cases, but I'd rather tell people why what they're saying is bad than throw a shoe at someone for making an offensive joke. And that's... exactly how it works? Comedians that say offensive shit get less money, because less people are interested in giving them the time of day.
I pointed that out at the start. Overreactions are overreactions, but saying "yo dude that aint cool" is rarely an overreaction.
Yeah. Hell, a ton of "easily offended" people I know just recently had a *huge* fit against censorship with the Steam VN thing.
The times he actually says something, it's not too bad? But then he immediately drives his point right into a wall.

And then he starts talking about nazi liberals.
It's like, criminally bad
Yeah, probably
In summary, I have no idea what point that video was trying to get across, and also if you think that criticism equals fascism you uh... certainly have some opinions.
I went in to that video expecting a point to be presented but in the end I was just left feeling violated for having spent an hour on it
that video slowly shifted from "okay, at least he's being somewhat reasonable" to "millenials are nazis"
15:37 - "asking people to be less offensive makes you a fascist" I was prepared to say that criticism isn't censorship but he just fucking veered right off into saying that peaceful protest is akin to being a nazi

16:18 - "teaching a dog how to do a nazi salute isn't fascist, but objecting to nazi imagery is" I have no words

16:49 - "is he supporting nazi ideology" no but he sure as fuck is normalizing and spreading it

17:05 - "it was obviously intended as comedy" yeah but some comedy fucking sucks

17:10 - "there should be no rules when it comes to comedy" *stabs a homeless dude* it's just a joke brah

17:37 - "that is just a slippery slope" you at the bottom of yours yet?

19:34 - "aren't the courts suppressing his free speech just like the nazis?" no, generally the nazis killed you at the same time

19:49 - okay, he did it. He straight up did it, he said that liberals are nazis.

20:54 - "non-conforming gender-fluid pansexual cabbage" wow, creative
10:19 - "youtube cares about minorities" that's even funnier than the one about the advertisers. What's next? Twitter?

10:45 - most of the people he's complaining about think war is terrible and would LOVE for examples of war being terrible to be out there, uncensored, so people can see how terrible it is

10:55 - "we can't blame youtube" yes we can and yes we should. Youtube needs to get their shit together.

10:59 - "it really isn't their fault" yes it is

11:32 - "it's not wrong to be offended" glad we could agree on something there buckaroo

12:00 - **~ M I L L E N I A L S ~**

12:22 - why does he always take stock footage of women when depicting supposedly offended people?

12:31 - "being offended doesn't mean anything" THERE IT IS

12:44 - "it doesn't give you the right to control how others behave or talk" yeah but it certainly means I can choose to not give them money or time

12:58 - okay he's taking a nice ride down a real slippery slope right now

13:32 - "offense is subjective" yeah so is comedy deal with it

14:02 - "just because you are offended doesn't mean the result of the world should be" yeah but I'm allowed to ask people to not do offensive shit

14:30 - "i'm offended by people drinking instant coffee" you at the bottom of that slope yet?
Okay, 4 minutes in - not even gonna address the racism thing since that's pure conjecture and fuck the US military and their bullshit practices anyway, and sure, censoring satire is ridiculous. This guy doesn't seem to be arguing against "political correctness" (which I will hereby refer to as "common decency") as much as he's arguing against overreactions.

4:40 - "for one simple reason: it is comedy" no you twit, it's satire. Comedy doesn't get a free pass for being comedy, but if you're lampooning racists by depicting racism coming from an absolute idiot then you're painting a bigger picture. Most of what he says defending offensive non-satirical comedy after this is kinda invalidated by arguing from a position of either bad faith or simply mixing up some definitions.

5:55 - "being intentionally prejudiced against a specific group of people is a horrible thing" yes, but so is being unintentionally prejudiced. You can be just as funny without being offensive.

6:28 - I'm sorry what

7:00 - I'm pretty sure "snowflake" is a term used to invalidate people that the speaker deems to be "trying to stand out too much". Again, mixing up definitions.

7:26 - "Not offensive" is not synonymous with "family friendly" so I'm expecting yet another dive into some mixed definitions.

7:56 - "liberal oppression" I'm going to assume this guy is intentionally mixing up his definitions now because that aint shit I expect to hear from even the most centered of centrists

8:00 - "we are humans, we are not perfect" yeah and that's why I've made some offensive jokes and comments even within the past year. I usually acknowledge and apologize for them afterwards though.

9:00 - apparently advertisers think minorities are worth marketing to now?

9:51 - "advertisers will refuse to advertise on offensive shows" you ever hear of uhhhhhhh ru paul's drag race
y'all ready for my wall of text?
and damn is it a trainwreck
im done watching it
alright
JUST A JOKE CAN'T TOUCH ME FREE SPEECH
17:10 - "there should be no rules when it comes to comedy" *stabs a homeless dude* it's just a joke brah
dont you want to see my funny joek
I've already been forced to write "it's just a joke brah" I can't stop now
IVE ALREADY WRITTEN SO MUCH
I'm at 16:49 and this has officially veered into "not worth my time" territory but I can't just stop now that I've spent this much time listening to this shit
sneak peek at what I'm writing

12:31 - "being offended doesn't mean anything" THERE IT IS
HE'S SAYING THINGS
uh oh
he said the words "liberal oppression" at one point and I did a spit take
I AM VERY HAPPY THAT SHE IS OKAY
THAT SHIT IS EXPENSIVE
RIGHT AFTER I TAKE THE WEED
foisjdfoiwhfuiowehfouishrfouishfoiwhefoiwheoifwheoifhweoifhsuiehfoisehfsioefhosiefhoisehf
I'm fucking
alright they showed back up
Haven't seen any activity from a friend in like 4 hours and they'd mentioned they were feeling suicidal a few days ago and I Am Terrified.
Also took less weed this time so I'm not the idiot who forgot half a day again. Now I'll be the idiot who forgot a quarter of a day.
Just took weed to stop an anxiety attack and I'm gonna go fucking nuts if the reason I'm having the anxiety attack shows up in like 10 minutes
Probably more milk in chocolate ice cream to balance the bitter flavor of cocoa
milk has more than yogurt, which has more than butter, which has more than ice cream, which has more than cheese
processing milk reduces the amount of lactose in it
lactose intolerance is caused by not consuming it, isn't it?
I'd like to believe that most people are like me in that they'll generally condemn the people who are blindly spewing bullshit over the people who are just trying to do things they like.
I mean... the person I was talking about last night is someone who I'd been mutuals with for 3 or 4 years at this point. Sometimes people drift apart because of absolutely inane stuff.
It must be so hard for those people to be forced at gunpoint to continue following an artist they don't like.
did someone actually make like, a call out blog for this?
...okay maybe no one is a bit of a stretch
tbh I wouldn't view it terribly differently from "what if this cis girl character was actually a trans girl" and no one blows up over that
It's an interesting way of exploring a ship and how the characters would react
Genderbending is still keeping the ship intact
guh, I saw some of the shit people were slinging. It's not like you're taking a gay or canonically shipped character and being like "this character is now fucking faceless male character #12"
i think im gonna actually sleep tonight
im tired and probably not explaining good
But after having not followed one of them for a year it seems worse. I hadn't been looking at this shit until recently.
I've just been fence sitting for the past few years
it's literally just two sides of one big petty shitflinging festival
everyone has everyone else blocked
Probably
So I just cut them out instead
I told them to cut it out,  more than once
And that translates into me being an unskilled cook or something
"hurr durr Alice burns her rice" just fucking nonstop because one time my mom failed to understand how rice cookers work and I mentioned that I was just chewing on crispy rice
I cut off contact with a friend group because they kept using my gender, sexuality, and cooking skills as punchlines. And those are like, the top 3 things you're not allowed to joke about with me.
Welcome to the reason for rule 1 here. Are they all people you know, or just random people with a handful of your actual friends mixed in?
SIGN ME UP FOR THE SYMPHOGEAR PARTY
Can't be too safe!
Watched a documentary about a guy who got pinned under a boulder while camping
I'm... pinning that just in case



We should probably move to general at this point
I could remove my custodian role and still be able to do everything.
Nope. Owner has permanent admin status.
What if today ends up like Thursday
There really needs to be a way to wrangle me into the restricted access role by like, popular vote or something.
yes
Hang on I'm coming with you
I'm saying that in general so that Shirabe catches on to it
Make the bears dance.
Cramming a ton of people into a suite and playing video games with people I've never seen and never will see again is still fun though.
It does SOUND like a party now that I type it out.
Unless 10 people crowded into a hotel room playing fighting games and singing karaoke counts as a party.
Although recently that's being replaced with just going to people's rooms and watching them get drunk, sans party.
I go to room parties at cons and watch other people get drunk
you're just like i used to be
Fairly Oddparents somehow had withstood the test of time. Watching it in my 20s was legitimately enjoyable.
Luckily, time-appropriate cartoons were on at the time, so I was watching stuff I'd actually watched as a kid. Fairly Oddparents, Spongebob, Kim Possible, just honestly... trash, really. Except for Fairly Oddparents
So there I am, 20 years old or so, home for the entire day alone. What does a kid do when no one is around to tell them what to do? Something dumb, but in my case the something dumb was watching cartoons for like 5 hours
Okay so a few years ago, when I still had intense dysphoria, I decided one day that my childhood was not the childhood I wanted, so I decided to just fucking redo it, no abusive father, no being forced into the role of a dude, just me experiencing a childhood I missed out on.
Lets move this to <#377148557796442134>
And also Battle Tendency is just a really nice name
6 episodes
Or did you only watch like
S2 meaning part 3?
Mutually beneficial agreement
He doesn't know she's his mom
first subbed picture of jojo with only one i
I grabbed the file off google images

Counterpoint: Miku
same feel
dess_.. wisdom
It didn't hold true for me, but you can expect to be reasonably close.
am doing this
I
it honestly helped me with trans issues because eventually it stopped being "boy sneaking into girls summer camp" and turned into "boy learns how to girl"
i can find it
it started out porny but then there was like... actual plot
i read a porn comic about it once where it was just a mashup of girls from different series
anyway, moral of the story: if you wanna relive your childhood for any reason either find a friend to do it with or watch fairly oddparents
i only remember 1
the wiki told me it happened 3 times
yeah
there are 3 timmantha episodes
yeah, the army dude
i swear
im not biased on that
but also everything with timmantha
the two that come to mind are the episode where Jorgen scrambles the fairies and the magic lemonade
I only saw older episodes without that abomination
Also adults are way better at sleepovers than kids
Anyway yeah go rewatch Fairly Oddparents, it's pretty decent.
Also every scene with Jorgen was objectively the best scene in the episode.
There's no real end to this story. Being trans sucks sometimes.
So I just sat there. Watching Fairly Oddparents for like 3 hours, until I remembered I was 20 and just got fucking upset that I would never have the experience of being a 7 year old girl doing 7 year old girl things.
Fairly Oddparents was different. The jokes were all pretty harmless and age appropriate but something about it catered to older audiences too, without slipping in dirty references like Rocko did, constantly.
Listen, Kim Possible was good, but it was undeniably a kid's show
Lucky for me, there was an *enormous* block of reruns because nick basically did exclusively marathons at the time.
The pizza place, I called, the guy said "We don't do deliveries right now" and hung up on the spot
The chinese place was impossible to understand
I've tried to order food by phone twice
I'm fine being called but dialing a number is a great way to trigger anxiety
We have the technology! We can do it literally today!
Society needs to progress past phones quicker
While I was recovering from surgery in the city there were so many options
grubhub is mostly good for cities. I live on Long Island so I'm halfway to a city, but the options are still like "Chinese, pizza, sushi" and if I'm feeling adventurous I'll go spend $40 to have indian food delivered
i use grubhub for everything because i'm incapable of speaking on a phone
Sounds like you have some venting to do
How the fuck do I click an article about Anthony Bourdain's suicide and come out halfway through saying "Fuck Trump"? People are more than the sum of their work.
is that fanart and if yes do you know the source
...i might use that as an emote
yeah
It's on the lighter side of "things that are offensive"
You don't become your gender, you realize and actualize it.
writing fills the time
my vagina enabled me to write. forced me, really, i've been a NEET for nearly a year now due to the surgery
dunno if itll stick but its fun and i wouldnt be at this point if i didnt transition
now I'm writing and editing and thinking of trying to make money off of it
before that, studying CS
before that i was a drop out with nothing to my name
a year ago I was working at my grandma's law firm
settling is no fun anyway
but, hey, i tried that in middle school so it's not like that came out of nowhere
and there was a pretty big in between where i wanted to kill myself
today i am happy
in high school i wasn't happy, i was functional.
the eerie and uncomfortable feelings you've always had are being magnified now, but once you start transition, they just start disappearing
but it's a slingshot
Sadly, "everything is just worse now" is the inevitable first step in transitioning. Support helps but without it you need to muscle on.
Rather than suggesting a time for them to say "yeah okay" too actually get a time from them
I say give it another shot and get people to commit to a time
Organizing is hard and it doesn't always work out every week
You need to know what a clock is to dream about it, is what I'm saying. Even though the lack of time in dreams is consistent regardless.
But like, would the same thing happen with a sundial?
There are consistent things across dreams of people who inhabit similar societies, though. If you've been exposed to clocks, then your dreams may sometimes have clocks in them. And clocks never function properly in dreams
Because it works fine as a concept, and I know a few people who have perfectly functioning polyamorous relationships. But it requires a few things, like communication, and for everyone in the relationship to actually fucking be polyamorous. Square peg round hole.
Did I miss the polyamory discussion?
oh no
whoops
zoloft may or may not work for you but you're gonna feel absolutely amazing for like a week
i just write and try not to think about it. what's your prescription for?
Also I'm currently writing a fluffy fic about hibimiku and dmjii going on a double date
Right now it's 3 times a day for an hour and five minutes total. The catch is the middle dilation happening in the middle of my day.
I'm not making money from it but that's not the fucking point.
Like, writing *is* effectively my job at the moment. I have nothing else.
If I don't keep the ball rolling it gets harder to start back up after I miss a day. I have to make it a habit.
My mom flat out does not understand how I operate. One day she'll bug me about getting a job even though my dilation schedule makes that incredibly difficult, then when I decide "I'm gonna write and actually do something with my time" she gets pissy that I decide to dedicate myself to writing every single day.
It's just the transgender symbol
There.
it doesn't look good like that
bam
Maybe I should add the trans icon to my name...
You'll feel exactly the same, just without the undertones once you're on the right meds.
I know you didn't imply they would, but the Zoloft is sure gonna make it feel like they do
Also mushrooms are a better high if you're depressed.
The meds won't do it for you.
Once you find the solution, whether it's Zoloft or something else, you still have to provide your own happiness.
But whether it works or not, that first week is *just a high*. Enjoy it. Immerse yourself in it. But do not chase it.
And god damn it will be a good week, but it will not last, and even if Zoloft works out for you, you'll settle back down. If it doesn't work for you you'll probably become suicidal.
It's being high. You will be high for a week.
*This is not pure untainted happiness*
The first week or so of Zoloft will have you unimaginably happy and giddy. You will be filled with energy you did not know you could have.
<@!102691114762371072> I need to tell you this now and it's incredibly important you understand this.
oh
What happened?
yeah
With a little feathery cloak
The female version is just a dress
The male version has designs on it.
I don't see the issue with the male outfit, and the female outfit has been done plenty in other games.
You're either feminine or masculine, no in between.
And basically no games give you a gender neutral option for anything.
The only exception I can think of is Pokemon
Most games I can think of where women are given an appreciable amount of choice *also* give men an appreciable amount of choice.
Recent games are better, but most games that let you play as a girl basically only give you sexarmor
I love both my real boobs and my virtual boobs but sometimes I just wanna cover my boobs
Ah, yes, female clothing in every game. I get to pick from slutty huntress and slutty sorceress.
You'd be surprised how often I get called "he" with Girl literally in my name
I'm agender so I wouldn't wanna use either a female or a male symbol
frilly underwear is good
I am tired of not hugging you all the time
I have a cabinet full of porn
but the porn is the important stuff
She just owns the place.
She doesn't actually live here though
Rule is if I have to look at it more than she does, she doesn't get to decide how it looks.
My mom is banned from decorating the house
wfc, you've been on this server since I created it
My dad also has refused to pay for anything
Anyway, coming out stories are good and fun here, but lets migrate "I'm drunk and cuddled with cute girls" to another channel. This is like, the one channel where "there's no activity" isn't an excuse to use it as a second general.
We're putting chemicals into the water to turn the frogs into singing lesbians
And yes that's a Grarrl
There's like... 8 or 9 trans girls here I think
<@!175163984197058560> I'm slowly building my trans symphogear empire using this server
I thought hets were just a myth
Without even doing research he's just "Well *I'm* not paying"
Yeah
I'm named after a video game character who isn't really my favorite anymore from a series I don't really like all that much anymore and also I'm agender so I could see myself with a less gendered name.
No one has to choose their name right away! I kinda wish I'd chosen mine with a bit more thought.
This seems like a discussion better suited for <#377148557796442134> or <#371105434771390465>
I've completely cut off my dad's side of the family but that's easy when the big side is my mother's side
Hana is common enough that I wouldn't think anything of it
I never changed it again because Alice is "good enough", I do actually like the name itself, and I don't wanna go through people deadnaming me *again*
But we're a bit off from that point.
I guess. Personally, I think we just need to work on untying gender and gender presentation from gender roles. I don't think girls should have a reason to feel ashamed for being masculine, or that boys should feel ashamed for being feminine.
Also valid. But the topic was "Are Kanade's hot bulging muscles masculine?"
We don't really have a word for "undefined" yet. Neuter isn't really applied to people.
Would you rather be told you look biologically male, though?
It's okay, you're ahead of most of the world.
And saying "that woman looks masculine" is a whole lot easier (and respectful) than saying "that woman looks like she was assigned male at birth"
So masculine and feminine only reinforce the gender binary if you insist that androgynous does not exist. But if you accept that androgynous does exist, then there's no problem. You're just describing something.
But the important thing is that masculine, feminine, and androgynous, only tell you what something is *like* and not what something *is*. You can be a masculine woman, an androgynous man, or a feminine anything.
Okay. Correct. And, if you're anywhere near gender theory, you'll probably hear that male and female are not the only genders that exist. If you're anywhere near ME you'll hear that because I'm agender and will probably bite your head off if you mention it. So, in a way, masculine and feminine enforce the gender binary by saying "this is like a man" or "this is like a woman" but that's only if you ignore the existence of the third option. Androgynous. "this is like both a man and a woman".
("I don't know" is a valid answer)
There are multiple angles I can approach this from, but I'll just start with a question. What does the term "gender binary" mean to you?
Masculine/feminine are like cheat codes where you can talk about appearances without accidentally upsetting a trans or GNC person who's having a bad day.
Like I'll call Saki and R "he" but that's because both of them have made it explicitly clear to me using their own words that those are their pronouns.
I actively avoid using gendering terms unless I know 100% what the person's preference is. I always use singular they/them.
Rewinding a bit to```I've had people complain that masculine and feminine are inappropriate to use in these situations```Unless the word flat out doesn't make sense in the context, it's almost always better to use masculine or feminine to describe bodies. It tells the reader exactly what you mean without getting into the hazy annoyances of "Is this person ignorant or malicious" whenever you invoke the term "biologically (fe)male"
(also it was a drawing for pride)
DL's kiri-kun doesn't have the side fringes on his hair, so that one's pretty easy to tell. And boybiki is just in general larger than normal bikki.
Anyway, I kinda get the point that DL draws *exceptionally* muscular girls but I have a hard time disconnecting the character from their appearance. You'd have to cover their face and any other identifying markers before I could see DL's Kanade as masculine. I actually have trouble identifying Kiri-kun as male unless his shirt is off or in that one picture with the uniforms because he's not drawn significantly different from how DL normally draws Kirika to begin with.
That's not an "I'm deeming this a slur" thing that's a "this phrase was uncomfortable for me to read" thing
Not to go off topic here, but could you just say "masculine" instead of "bio-male" next time? The latter reeks of TERF rhetoric and I actually flinched reading it.
I mean, that's what they do after congregating in their little fuckhuddles deciding who is and isn't an acceptable target. Someone who's just trolling for shits and giggles because they're bored goes away if you ignore them but some people just obsess over it.
Yeah.
I'm pretty sure they only kick or ban people after like a month of nonstop issues.
If someone's being harassed and no one is doing any moderation then that's a problem.
But I'm gonna side with saki. In context, it's not that bad, and moderating someone who's being harassed rather than the harassers isn't exactly good form.
both
Was that before or after Geno had started mocking wfc?
^
I'm gonna go ahead and say that saying "This person is an asshole and I'm not going to elaborate on why" is *kinda* being a dick.
Confident trans people don't actually exist, we're just really good actors from the first half of our existences.
It's okay, all of it is faked.
Yeah I get to have fun with those ones too.
Gender is complicated and I envy the people who don't have to think about it.
i want ramen
<@292451539136806913> we can't lose to these guys, when are you next available to go get ramen and crepes
gay is my specialty
<@456226577798135808> It was a special case. The server wasn't too active at that point and there was personal beef.
Then he started begging me to be let back in which was a good few hours of me tormenting him until he figured out I wasn't gonna unban him.
He got out two messages before I handed wfc mod powers for a few minutes to give him the pleasure of banning bwen.
Disability, and either works fine.
I warned them about bwen. The second he showed up here he got banned.
Abolish money
How the fuck do you steer towards one or the other?
But there's no regulating body
Like I get the difference in ideals between the two
make sure that actually happens
How do you like
What even is the functional difference between ancap and ancom? You have no regulating body either way, how can it not end up as a survival of the fittest type scenario?
Yes. If the federal government were to deem something as dangerous, they should absolutely be allowed to step in and stop that shit.

That's not to say I don't have some issues with the current federal government.
They already are.
Super masc trans men are a pretty good solution to the actual problem they have, imo
That's a solution to the problem that opponent's of "letting trans women pee" purport to exist, but the actual problem they have is "letting trans women pee"
"Fuck Reagan" is a phrase I use in excess
I love opioids
(I'm also stepping out literally for a second because I need to wash my vagina tools Saki take the wheel)
I'm gonna chime in to say I'm stepping out of this discussion, but I'm still watching it and I'm gonna tell you to stop if you start tearing each other apart over it.
`eat the rich`
https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ddb36b2549af078d1c60f7fa87bdc502-c here's a similar one that divides it by gender
Queer is "something defined but not easy to put into words" here
http://www.thetaskforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sexualorientationchart.jpg shitty resolution since the original link is broken, but here's the results of a survey conducted where the sample consisted entirely of openly transgender people (AKA people who are open about being something even more taboo than being gay is) on sexuality
Most cishet people just adamantly ignore this
Like 75% of the population is queer
Cross-classing your sexuality = being both gay and straight = being bi
Invisibility spell = being invisible

I'm using RPG terms to refer to a social issue
Did you know that cross-classing your sexuality gets you a neat invisibility spell?
Assuming direct control
Other than sexuality. Everyone is gay.
I assume nothing, which is why I use names and gender neutral pronouns so much
ibu, that was a joke
That problem is easily solved by saying "I'm not trans I just like the colors and support the movement"
I mean everyone is trans by default for me
That's just taste
Pink shirt, light blue pants, some sort of white accessory?
But like
If I saw someone dressed in a straightup trans pride shirt I'd probably assume they were trans
My dream is to have someone say I'm clearly not cis so I have to use the other bathroom and then I just fucking drop my pants and ask them if they have any other questions
all i know is that you guys had a pig fucker in office or something
<@!225771411833225216> any questions in particular?
Anarcho-communist
There's probably a glossary of trans terms somewhere out there
What you're doing is called boymode.
Stealth is later on in transition.
No
Stealth = hiding your trans identity and just living as a cis person
Straight trans girls risk being killed if their partner finds out.
Yeah. Part of why I never decided to go stealth is because I don't need to.
i secede
my doctor was trans and just ignored all the standards and handed me hormones after a blood test and ekg
Just seeing the needle peek past 100 was like "holy shit I should slow down" for me
Yeah I wouldn't have done 100 if I didn't know there was nothing else but me on that stretch of road
Said "why not" and floored it
No one in front of me, no one behind me
The onramp to the part of the highway I was on was closed for some reason, but the highway itself was open.
Felt like a damned lunatic
I've done 100 before
Keep in mind that America is big, California is particularly big, and there are large stretches of nothing out here
No, but a cop won't go after you for coasting 70 on an empty freeway
I will join your server! For coming out on this server... I own the place. When I made it, everyone knew "that trans girl is off making her own server now"
Immigration is a fucking mess, and the administration does it's damn best at making sure every step is damn near impossible to complete.
https://twitter.com/nirvfreak/status/1009853072389103617 this tweet is relevant
"the law" is not always correct
Reminder that "the law" said black people are only 3/5 of a person.
And also the whole "sargon of akkad" thing
That's only really believable without the whole crime quote
To them, brown = illegal.
When people say "illegal immigrants" the way JonTron did, they rarely care for the nuances of which ones are actually illegal or not.
my arms have noodled and now i have no strength to dilate with thanks reddit
FUCKING FIRST RESPONSE IS ABOUT SOMEONE WHO HAD A VASECTOMY AND NOW IM JUST THINKING ABOUT MY OWN SURGERY
WHY DID I CLICK ON THIS THREAD
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
maybe ill just eat the rest of the pizza anyway
I need to write and I feel like gaaaaarbaaaaaaage
why?
I'm NY
NYC doesn't have speed limits, just traffic to slow you down
Shirabe, you live like 10 miles away from me. It's probably not illegal immigrants.
They might not actually have a license is one
There are many reasons someone might not have insurance
If you're not legal you probably don't have a car
Yeah, illegals kinda wanna keep their head low
I'd love it if this country worked toward immigration reform. Unfortunately, ICE.
The only reason an immigrant would avoid paying taxes is because they're not legal. Why aren't they legal? Because it takes 7 years to immigrate and 1 year to get blown the fuck up by ISIS.
But, again, immigrants aren't the ones failing to pay taxes. Immigrants stay on that shit, they immigrated for a reason.
that's what you charge them with
that's the legal term
"failure to pay taxes"
Immigrants that don't pay taxes don't do it because they want to avoid paying taxes, it's because they want to avoid being deported back into the shitty situation they were escaping from.
Kick them out, like we should have done to the people with millions of dollars that they don't pay taxes on.
Then they pay taxes.
If someone doesn't pay taxes because they're illegal, let them become legal.
Now is the time to fight.
Yes. That we FOUGHT to get rid of.
If someone comes over illegally, look at why, not who.
I'd say "abolish cops" but anarchy probably isn't good for America right now.
We have TV shows glorifying the work of cops.
That you don't hear about.
Cops are cogs in the machine. Muslims are not.

It's memes
Assigned Cop at Birth
Not engaging, fuck Reagan, not engaging.
Not engaging.
~~Do they like that ICE exists~~
All of that.
What Saki said.
I'm going to engage with that though.
I'm going to not engage with this and just watch.

Such as Kim Jong Un
They were communists up until the point where they got the power to stop being communists.
Not Mao, mind you. Places like KWC.
That's how its worked in China.
I'm gonna note right now, I'm not an anarchist. That being said, communism is enforced within an ancom scenario by the fact that if you DON'T go along with communism you get fucking shot.
ancap literally favors the rich. ancom is what you're thinking of Wien.

<@284390402210136064> I'd like to clarify that if someone were to express the same sentiments that those three did but on this server, they'd be out immediately. Some people have opinions and that's fine. Some of those opinions need to be discussed in this channel, and that's fine. Transphobia is not an opinion, it is hate, and it gets the boot.
Xaxas is certainly something
she was defending trans rights with a fair bit of eloquence, for context

The response from circles is a better reaction
Yeah, and it's all garbage people.
OISFJOSIDJFOISJDF
Imagine you are in a grim dystopian wasteland, and there's a wonderful meadow of being trans to frolick through next to it. But there's a gate between the two, and normally the gate should just be free to open and close as you wish, but no, there's a gate keeper
yep
Don't even copy Xaxas's message here imo. It doesn't need to be spread.
```The thing is the server isnt bad
Some of the people in it ar```This is like saying "this neighborhood isn't bad, just some of the people in it are."

If the neighborhood has a high crime rate because of the people in it, it's bad.
I'm reading the backlog, and I don't know EXACTLY what's going on down below as I type this message, but ***CALM THE FUCK DOWN***
<@279341087494242304> You've displayed ignorance on the subject yourself, so I'm not sure you're the most qualified to judge whether Langou's disposition is born of ignorance or malice.
Langou's past and the fact that he made that "joke" in exactly that manner is enough for me to tell him to go away.

Also, yes. Every single minor on this server who accesses the nsfw channels has confirmed that they're over 18. It's not my problem if they lie.
As I said, transphobes aren't welcome here. There's being ignorant, and there's being intentionally harmful.
That's even worse.
Your reply was fine. The issue is the initial joke being made in the first place.
Also - ```he was okay with trans, just didn't like intersex for whatever reason```I'm agender, so if Langou wants to even try to join this server again he'll need a disguise.
Hence me telling you all to calm the fuck down.
I was busy reading the log, so I had no clue if it was calm or not, but "several people are typing" usually means not calm
But if you wanna have a discussion, hit me up around tomorrow
I said "centrist" not centrist
anyway back to the log
No trial.
Taking a break from the log to say:
You can be left wing and express your opinion here
You can be right wing and express your opinion here
You can be "centrist" (read:right wing lite) and express the opinion here

If you are a transphobe, sexist, racist, anything discriminatory, not only can you not express your opinion here, you're fucking gone.
So recent events have led me to a potentially interesting question and ensuing discussion. Obviously transphobia is transphobic, but is *hosting* transphobia also transphobic? If you allow other people to use your platform to preach transphobia, are you being transphobic in doing so? Obviously, this applies to other forms of bigotry as well (does hosting racism make you racist, etc) but the subject of today was transphobia so that's where my mind lies right now.

Personally, if you're going to let someone say something on your platform, I think that translates to an endorsement of the thing being said. You're giving it exposure, not punishing them for it, and even if your stance is "do nothing", that's still a choice. You're still allowing people to be pushed off your platform due to bigotry through inaction.

Actually, know what? <@207889657084510208> <@204069354600398848> y'all want complaints, here they are.
The staff there are very insistent on not doing anything about things along that line unless people message them about it. Which, personally, I think intervening before the problem exists is key, but if you've got complaints make them heard.

Rule 1 is don't be a dick.
<@279341087494242304> You took the initiative to learn. Langou took the initiative to be a dick.
Yeah probably.
I did intellectual labor sufficient for an entire server's moderator team so maybe I should have just done that instead.
So mostly the same
My full response was ```Yes, allowing transphobic statements without any effort to make it known that transphobic statements aren't okay is transphobic. It is being complicit with transphobia.```
implicit or complicit?
To which I said yes, but I'm wondering about other people's opinions.
I'm not looking for approval on this exact case, but I directed a complaint to one of the mods and they posed the question of ```let me ask, would you consider us transphobic just because we allow someone to make a statement that you consider to be transphobic```
And the line is drawn somewhere between "you're not allowed to be a rape apologist" and "you're allowed to be transphobic in certain contexts"
Today's particular incident was a discord server.
tacit approval, I guess. You're not saying "yeah this is good" but you're also not saying "this is bad and needs to go"
Maybe endorsement was a bad word to use.
Could it have fallen out at your house?
neat!
fucking is a year round activity
you can actually fuck in any weather
That's good.
Then wait 2 hours, and if there's no response, you need to call. Don't fuck around with SSRIs.
Yes, I do too. If you can tell someone else to call for you, do that. But you really need to call unless your doctor lives in the 21st century and understands email. Most don't.
Be proactive, call now, leave a message.
And if they're busy when you need to take your meds?
If you can get a quicker response (you probably want a response today) by calling instead of emailing, call.
If you have suicidal thoughts on SSRIs that you didn't have without them, you never touch SSRIs again.
Regardless of why, they're gonna tell you to stop taking SSRIs immediately.
Not entirely.
"bad"
And different is bad.
But it's not that simple. People look for differences.
Then the problem is solved, probably
Some humans still hang on to the concept of "us vs them"
tribalism
heavy tap in real world land
...light tap in educated land
You don't need constant reminders. But you do need a light tap if you start expressing view points like "black people are bad"
That education must be continually reinforced, though.
That's part of the solution, at least.
We have nazis, because we as a society have not given ourselves the tools to prevent nazis.
Simply don't allow people to be nazis, and we won't have nazis
True. The ideal would be that bigoted viewpoints get shunned in the first place and there would be no need for containment.
I mean, fill a box with enough shit and the box is gonna burst
/pol/ poisoned the well a decade ago
4chan itself is the containment
I did not know this
In the past we'd have been more prone to mark them as "nice guys" or such.
Incels have been around forever, it's just that we only started calling them incels recently. They have their own culture around them, so it hasn't been exactly the same in the past, but the same ideas were always there, just isolated.
Compare it to something like BDSM culture, where that's also a group of outcasts, but queer people laid the first bricks there and now a BDSM club that excludes gay people would quickly go out of business.
a subculture of outcasts is still its own subculture, and a lot of people that I'd now label as incels paved the way for much of nerd culture
I don't think I've encountered any other anime related community that wasn't specifically aimed toward queer folk that also went and said "hey, yeah, some of these things are kinda bad let's not do them"
It's pretty toxic, I think. This discord is more of an exception than a rule.
i hate discord

https://twitter.com/MichaJawkan/status/1012488921207529479 instead lets talk about this and WHY IS IT HARD FOR PEOPLE TO GET THIS INTO THEIR FUCKING HEADS
Let's uh

not just start vomiting out normal human things to do as if people should be shunned unless they do the very specific only acceptable thing to do and everyone else is a normie, ree, etc
Nukes are not very good options.
We have literally always been at war with someone
America has never had a peacetime president.
I prefer debates
But we can work for the future.
Maybe today it's not possible.
I'm not that pessimistic.
I'd rather prevent harmful ideas from spreading in the first place than kill people for their ideas. Preventing the nazi from existing is way better than killing the nazi.
Fair.
I don't really think that every view point has a right to be expressed. Some view points are harmful, unproductive, and not valuable. By saying "every view point has a right be expressed" you're automatically condoning the "both sides" argument. And "both sides" is bullshit, because one person can say "I think everyone in this group should be eradicated" and under both sides, that's a legitimate view point.
I'd like to point out that all of this is wonderfully idealistic. My own personal values, for instance, explicitly state that people can think whatever they want, and issue only comes to head when they begin to act on those thoughts.

except the harassment she's claiming to receive is having her shit talking tweets reported
Huh. If anyone remembers that person I was complaining about from twitter a while back who would constantly talk shit about my friends, it looks like her account got suspended. And now she's complaining that people are harassing *her* from an alt.

I would say that if this hypothetical person was on any sort of medication, they should know that sometimes medication actually makes you feel worse, and that it takes a few days for that to get out of their system.
So be more like "So the term is just homophobic?" and let them lead themselves into a corner.
Because assholes are precious little snowflakes who don't like being told that they're wrong
It makes them go on the defensive.
Don't accuse people of homophobia or transphobia unless you know that they're set in their ways.

If you're gonna have a trans character, at the very least hire a trans writer and a consultant.
And while you might not need "X type of actor to play X type of character" you definitely need someone who understands the character on the team

In any case, joking is a shot at maybe the agent will laugh, maybe the agent will handcuff you
They may or may not have a sense of humor. If you're white you have a greater chance of finding an agent with a sense of humor.
Dress however you want in that case. What are they gonna do? Strip search you for wearing cute clothes?
They don't have TSA there? I thought that was a thing they do.
Oh

Like I said. The US center is so far right that it could be a scifi story and people wouldn't bat an eye.
"Far left" in the US translates to "left leaning centrist" in other countries

"The US is so far right that even the most right of centrists are perceived as left"

I find that a lot of the trans girls I know go exclusively by their real name online. Like, why *wouldn't* you want to be called by the name you chose?

Language can change over time. This isn't the place to do so.
Reclamation is a thing.
Due to the contentious nature of the word, it's banned on this server entirely when being directed at anyone. Usage of the word normalizes it, normalization of words used to defame and harass minority groups is bad.
https://andrearitsu.com/2017/12/01/re-trap/ here it is again, in case you missed it
If you're being sincere, read the damn article I linked.
^
Read it.
I already linked the article, Carneg.
I'm going to go out here and say that if you use slurs (including trap, including retard) toward anyone who does not self-id with that specific word, you can change your ways or change your location. If you're going to be anal about what is and is not a slur, ```noun
1.
an insinuation or allegation about someone that is likely to insult them or damage their reputation.```
there are too many words to convey the shittiness of the issue while im sleep deprived
if you want a better breakdown on the issue of the word trap, https://andrearitsu.com/2017/12/01/re-trap/
Same for trap.
The rule here is "no slurs". While you're not actively using a slur, defending the usage of one is still pretty bad. And... tranny is a slur because it's used in a derogatory fashion against trans people?
and didnt look feminine at all
just... think on, if they were gonna cast a cis person at all, why a woman? why not cast a man to play a man?
like i said, gits has leeway, but after she caught flak for that she went and did the same exact shit RIGHT after
other than being cis?
also, scarjo could have turned down both roles to begin with. im willing to give more leeway on gits, but with r&t, she's gonna say yes RIGHT ON THE HEELS of gits?
i think the only live action adaptation ive ever seen and enjoyed was speed racer
but yeah there are plenty of trans actors that they could have cast instead
a transgender person*

adjective, not a noun
but now she's not getting her shit everywhere else
Should we use he/him pronouns for you? Or something else?
Alright. Just remember that you can change any time, or go by both, or really anything. Other people don't get to decide your own identity. No judgment will be passed here, and if you ever need someone to talk to 1 on 1 I'm always available.
You don't need to answer that immediately.
It took me three years before I was ready.
You don't have to give up on being yourself, though. Boy, girl, something in between, something entirely off that spectrum. Hormones don't define you.
Change can be scary, and you need to go at your own pace.
Maybe turn it off for a day or two when you post?

Honestly, there isn't really a problem if a cis person plays a trans character, but *get the fucking gender right* and also please start casting trans actors, like, at all
And also, if they did more than just that? Cast two people. Laverne Cox's character in oitnb was played by both her and her brother. And also she's trans, playing a trans character.

Honestly I'd prefer the process was simplified first. Getting any sort of support for a disability is hell.
Body parts deciding they just aren't doing their job randomly is the best
It's probably not worth going through with applying for disability for it, but I need the card for other reasons anyway.
Like a lot
It hurts sometimes
I should probably actually get my leg looked at some time. It's been a problem since at least middle school, but it pops up so infrequently that I haven't bothered to do anything.
I limped to a doctor's office once because I had like 30 minutes to get there and my leg decided that uphill was an invalid direction. Unfortunately, past 55th street *everything is uphill*
My leg is bad enough that it warrants needing a seat when it acts up but it doesn't act up often enough for me to keep a cane on me at all times.
Needing priority seating for invisible disabilities is kinda rare in the first place. Not that anxiety and depression are somehow lesser, but I don't exactly need a seat during a panic attack. Then I'll just be panicking while seated.
I don't think he was a shitbag, I think society is just terrible at telling people that you don't need a cane or a wheelchair to require priority seating
Like, I feel like when someone holds a disability card up to you while you're in the priority seating area that should be enough of a cue that you need to move.
Invisible disabilities suck
In other news, my leg finally decided to start acting up during peak hours on the train. I had to ask someone to get up and he kinda just stared at me *while I was holding a red card up that says DISABLED in bold*

Nope, all of those things still require actual work/medication. HRT just makes it easier.

"If I get voice training I won't be shy anymore!"

It was an accident I swear

Start taking estrogen for a while to fuck up your brain chemistry and then just stop at some point
I have an easy solution for that
When I started hormones, my life instantly became like 200% better, but I was operating at like 10% good at the time, so in the end I was only really at 30% good. It took a few years of denial before I decided to actually get the depression treated. Also I'm saying this as much for you Saki as I am for literally everyone else reading this.
I just wanna take this moment to point out that you can be both trans AND clinically depressed. The hormones might be giving you a nice kick right now, but if you start to slip back into depression, don't hesitate to seek out treatment for that too.
Lyssa I always have a reason to stop out there. The entire reason I haven't is because if I acted on that reason each time I'd just never leave.

Being hairless really is nice
I'd say try getting waxed just once and see how you like the results
Get waxed twice and you'll see. The first wax hurts the most because the hairs are longer, but if you regularly get waxed it hurts less. Also, I personally feel like waxing is a good effort.
Waxing hurts but honestly it's not that bad

Well. Prom dress and you just have to like... stay in the dress for a bit. Not necessarily go outside or anything, just wearing the dress.

Anyway, would any of this *also* apply while not skating?
In this case I'm more talking about the loss of control involved with sissification

This all sounds wonderfully adjacent to sissification kink
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Most of the stuff you've mentioned so far seem to be about loss of control and helplessness, so I was wondering if it meant that you want to have that loss of control and helplessness applied to yourself.
Oh, yeah. You had mentioned that you liked to think of yourself as a girl while skating, so I was wondering if all your kinks were applicable to you personally when you do.

Offending Comment: Attempts at shutting down a conversation

Just because you live in Israel does not mean you have the most complete opinion on shit that goes down there.
No additional action will be taken at this time.
Gotta fucking type in each warning individually.
Alright what the FUCK am I being woken up for here and who the fuck got it in their god damn head that "definitely a woman" is even slightly okay to say? Reading logs right now, if I seem pissed it's because I am.
I'm gonna try to go back to bed. Please don't self destruct.
You didn't do anything wrong
You posted some news headlines
It's just like... "Oh I don't feel like shit for once"
Having the correct hormones isn't really a describable experience
hernias are generally painful but not terrible to deal with. Just no heavy lifting iirc
oh
wh
reception > intention
"Harming anyone was never our intention" reads a lot to me like "We'll do whatever we want and only apologize after the fact"
perfectly sanitary short pr apology
hell, not even that. "We recognize the harm we may have caused from a recent tweet and apologize to anyone affected."
whats the fucking xkcd comic...
It sure is, and they have not delivered
^
It is all of these things together that make it go from "well maybe the intern was on that day" to "yeah no fuck em"
It's not necessarily the joke on its own. It's the joke, combined with the acknowledgment that a sizable portion of people found it offensive, followed by their non-apology saying "sorry you got offended"
I'd like to take this moment to reiterate a line from a recent announcement (because I can't fucking edit the rules for god knows what reason)

```As always, context matters and "It's just a joke bro!" is never a valid excuse.```
Like even if a dev says something transphobic, that's not an issue as long as their PR actually acknowledges it. CDPR did not.
Yeah, but why not? When a company makes a transphobic joke and hides behind shitty PR, why choose to be apathetic? It's not like big companies are doing this left and right, and it's honestly not a huge emotional strain to be like "haha well fuck them I guess"
Not because I don't think I'll like it, I just don't want my money going there.
That doesn't make other games not good, and when you're given a selection of 10 good games but you can only play 1, I'd rather not spend the money on one of the 10 good games made by a dev team with some weak ass PR
It'll make me more likely to want to give them money to find that out, though.
Lots of games are fun.
Why would someone want to play a game put out by a dev who has a PR team that doesn't acknowledge when they're wrong?
god damn why does this channel perpetually not show notifications for me
I'm actually pretty good where I live though. As long as the federal government does literally anything other than what it's doing right now then America seems safe enough to me.
Maybe I'll go learn Finnish or something
Canada seems kinda okay I guess. Probably still has people who'd wanna kill me but I kinda just live with that fear now.
Except maybe like... Canada.
I'm stuck in this country and the entire world is fucked anyway 🙃
Every party makes me fear for my future as a minority 🙃
In short, don't celebrate, but no one is telling you to mourn or keep completely quiet. Angry rants punctuated by a "fuck if I'm mourning anything" don't break any rules.
It looks way better and it gets more people on your side.
FUCK REAGAN

But then, there's the actual thing I just said. "Mentioning the shitty things they've done is fine" I don't actually know what McCain has done himself (besides be a Republican) so like... instead of partying, just point out why people shouldn't mourn.
Trump, Pence, Scalia (missed the boat on that one whooooo), there are a lot of choices.
Trump
I would like to save taking a political stance for someone measurably worse than John McCain.
That requires you to arbitrate who is and is not a shitty person and while this discord is inherently left leaning by the virtue of not shunning marginalized people, I'd still like to pretend that the server as an entity is a neutral zone.

Mentioning the shitty things they've done is fine, saying "thank fuck they're gone" is where you start push it a bit since I don't wanna be standing in the position of "Well you allowed people to celebrate the death of McCain, why can't I celebrate the death of [insert feminist youtuber]?!"
Please be more aware of what you say.
Alright. That's good enough for me to say you're okay, but I'm logging a warning for you since its been less than a month and you already managed an instant kick last time.
Okay, but do you understand why what you said in the way you said it is racist?
Facts, when presented in a racist fashion, are in fact racist.
Since I gave your last warning publicly, I'll bring this up publicly. Just, for a refresher: ```You're either making a generalization about women or attacking someone for their identity. There won't be a second warning.```Feel free to explain your comment about the company being Chinese owned in a way that doesn't make you sound incredibly racist.
No, please. Go on.
1) What does that sentence even mean?
2) What does Tencent being Chinese have to do with anything?
nothing to do with tencent and also what the fuck
...what?
yeah turns out game dev is shit work if you don't fit a mold
Outlawing guns isn't going to happen, but stricter gun control is definitely possible.
It doesn't require changing the bill of rights though. The bill of rights can bend without breaking.
My America™ to clarify. I'm sure people from Flint feel differently.
get one after moving
Too many are racist pricks to trust the good ones.
Similar: Do not call the police for assistance in any situation which involves a black man, unless the situation involves the black man pulling a gun on you or someone else.
Stereotypes aren't necessarily bad. Discrimination is bad. Stereotypes are sometimes good, like the stereotype of loud libertarians hating minorities? Well if you're secretly a minority and you're talking to one of those people, stereotypes help you know whether you should or should not tell that person that you're a minority.
I had my vagina poked around in by someone who I'm tempted to describe as a professional vagina poker and it was surreal. I was not aware that anything medical involving my vagina could possibly NOT be unpleasant.
turns out being suicidal and depressed for an entire week makes it feel like it went by really quickly
I'm gonna go ahead and say that suggesting suicide as a good idea for anyone, regardless of how fucked up they are, is not cool.
I've got 2 or 3 romantic relationships I can talk about if you want the deets. I say 2 or 3 because one of them depends on whether you think a relationship that lasted less than 24 hours counts.
Eventually I stood up, said "Looking for romance hasn't really been going so well", decided to focus purely on friends, and hey look there's a really wonderful woman I'm dating now because she was my best friend.
As someone who's previous relationships all *sucked ass* that's what did it for me.
Basically, don't focus so hard on romance. Look for friends and you might find a lover among them.
Friendship
<@!183785454447886346> oh there's a mindset that sounds awfully familiar. I understand the "I'll be the exception" thoughts and the "I need someone" thoughts and I believe those entirely because I've found myself in both of those positions in the past. Especially the "I'll be the exception" one, I've said in the past that if no one's done it before then I'll be the first, and I mean, I haven't been struck down on that front yet, so, yeah, it's possible. But as for "I need someone", my limited experience with relationships has shown me that a lot of the time, trying to find someone just because you need someone ends up poorly a lot of the time. I'm not going to tell you what to do or what not to do on that front, because, again, you can be the exception, but at the same time, could you look into making platonic relationships with people? Because while love is important, it comes in more than one form.
Through ALL of this, clingy's controlliness, Starlight's lack of paying attention to me online, bee girl is just fucking god damn
But lets go back to bee girl
Downtown Baltimore is fucking scary
Now, generally, I try not to be racist, but I was a lanky white girl with a lot of luggage.
That was the year that I also trekked through downtown baltimore to get from penn station to the hotel on foot
Anyway, main reason Starlight got back together with clingy is because Otakon was coming up and we had actually planned a trip for all 3 of us to go to Otakon together. Everything had already been paid for and I was already going to be stuck on a bus seat next to the person who might rape me if left alone with her.
me and Starlight are the same age
somewhere between 20 and 22
But she was not mentally sound in a "can't function in the real world" kinda way. Worse than me, too, and I am really bad at functioning.
yeah
Hypnotizing me
I immediately told Starlight that she said this, that I was uncomfortable with it, and the result was both me and Starlight breaking up with clingy girl. Unfortunately, Starlight's heart is bigger than her brain, so when clingy got a bit fucked up from losing two girlfriends at once, Starlight made up with her by getting back together, with the plan of dumping her later.
Considering that I called Starlight "mistress" at the time, this was a bit of a problem.
She uh... worded it a bit rapey too
ANYWAY at some point, clingy girl said that I should just break up with Starlight so that clingy girl could have me all to herself.
That's actually not relevant and I don't know why I mentioned it.
Clingy girl was way into hypnosis and ERP and stuff and so I was like "yeah sure" because I'm just chill like that
But taking a bit of a departure from bee girl, lets talk about my relationships with Starlight and clingy girl. Clingy girl was uh. Clingy. There were a lot of DMs between me and Starlight, me and clingy girl, and probably between Starlight and clingy girl.
THIS IS NOT THE END OF BEE GIRL
Turns out, I was right about that, but no one gave Starlight the memo. So I started dating Starlight, and shortly after, clingy girl
There was a very unhappy breakup between the two of us and I figured at that point, since bee girl was kind of Starlight's main girl from my point of view, my chances with Starlight were shot. After all, a polyamorous relationship can't work if two partners hate each other, right? You don't need a triad but if you have two girlfriends they should at least be able to talk to each other, right?
Bee girl was having none of it.
I tried explaining how most of the more recent skins were respectful, or how there were lesbians in the game's story.
So any game that had "slut armor" for women but not men was automatically bad and if you played it you were bad.
Bee girl was a very fierce feminist, but didn't quite understand feminism, degrees of offense, or the fact that you can enjoy something that's problematic as long as you acknowledge the problematic elements.
This was apparently unacceptable.
Anyway the relationship with bee girl lasted like 2 days before I told her I played GW2
At that point, bee girl had not shown any of her GIGANTIC FUCKING WARNING SIGNS. She was a bit sensitive to certain things, but none of it raised any particular red flags. Just normal "I was abused as a child and am now touchy" stuff.
Yes I was out.
But that's not where the relationship starts. The relationship starts with me talking to bee girl privately and bee girl suggesting that the two of us started dating because I was just that damn lonely.
There was a lot of public flirting and talk about BDSM, I was lonely and into BDSM, didn't take long for me to want Starlight to be my mistress too.
UNFORTUNATELY I was not someone familiar with polyamory
I was there, it was chill, she had like 6 girlfriends. To anyone properly familiar with polyamory, you may immediately realize that something is off at this point.
Anyway, so. One day, back before discord existed and IRC was still The Place, Starlight invited me to chill on her IRC channel for... reasons unknown, honestly.
too much work
I considered it
Starlight gets an actual name because I actually respect her even if shit didn't work out.
For privacy's sake, I'm gonna be using aliases for people who aren't me, so this is a story about the relationship between me and Starlight. Other characters in the story are: bee girl, clingy girl, and creepy doll girl.
today's story will be about Alice tries to do relationships for the first time in her life at age fucking... 22 or something I dunno ask Lyssa
alright buckle in kiddos because it's story time
but y'all get to hear Alice's Wonderful First Relationship
ill go into more detail oncce im done dilatig
it was polyamorous but the poly part of that was quickly falling apart. My other partner at the time said some.... things
turns out i need to be pet and hugged frequently because i am a literal dog
like, first relationship i got in, my "primary" partner was really bad at like.... paying attention to me
really bad relationships provide some wonderful framing on what you really need out of a relationship
you may think you're immune to abuse, no one is
avoid abuse though
I suggest you get in a relationship thats either really good or really bad in that case
If you're not looking for romance, those "no"s hurt a lot less
Then you move on when you get a no, since remember, the key is looking for friendship, not romance
it's also totally cool to look for romance in those friendships. But it's important to know when the answer is no.
let's not get hung up on terminology. Platonic's dictionary definition is just "not romantic"
Anyway story done <@183785454447886346>
And don't expect relationships to last. Some relationships are just "lets see where it goes"
So just like... if you end up in a relationship out of desperation, it's not gonna end well. You can certainly have "lets see if this works out" relationships, but for that I recommend dating apps.
So, the moral here is just... find friends before you find romance. Maybe romance will come from those friendships, it certainly did for me, but you need friends first.
But the important thing to note is *I was never looking at Lyssa as a potential partner* for the, what, 7 years I'd known her prior to us dating?
Lyssa gives me all of that and way more.
Luckily I get both in the same package right now, but even before I started dating Lyssa we were inseparable at cons.
But yeah, there's my first relationship. It was so bad that it really gave me insight on what I wanted. And what I wanted was not romance, I wanted attention.
And then I continue helping her cut bee girl out because seriously. Way toxic.
Eventually, I get home, clingy is out of my life, and I break the fuck up with Starlight.
For the entire 3 or 4 hour car ride, clingy kept trying to hug or cuddle with me and it was just a constant "I'm not dating you, stop trying" thing and the ride itself was the least enjoyable experience I've had in my grandma's BMW
And remember, clingy has mental issues, so we had to drive HER up as well.
Problem. Me and clingy took the bus down, and we were planning to take the bus back up.
I decided that Sunday wasn't worth it. I was hitching a ride with my mom and getting out of there as soon as possible.
I suspect that they wanted to meet the person I was dating (but hadn't told them I was dating but it was pretty fucking obvious)
One of my mother's cousins lived in Baltimore and my grandma and my mom "conveniently" had some business down in Baltimore and came to see us.
ESCAPE PLAN
BUT WAIT
So I went back to the room afterwards and continued feeling like shit.
She still displayed zero interest in me
We managed to swing it so that me and Starlight were at a table and clingy was not, because, whoops didn't mention it, clingy was still around
The lone saving grace of this was the Touhou dinner where we gathered our small army of crossplaying Touhou fans and reserved an entire restaurant
So overall I was just feeling kinda dejected because she went off playing video games all day and I just stood there like "can we do something together"
But lets move into Saturday. I actually spent the day with Starlight! Except she was still kind of mentally absent and wouldn't hold my hand.
I do not think I need to illustrate how a normally innocent request came off as utterly horrible at this point
She asked for some space
I tried to move a bit closer so we could like, hold hands or something
At some point, Starlight got on the bed I was laying in and feeling totally rejected in
The other people in the room filed in eventually and Starlight, again, paid no attention to me, and instead spent a lot of time showing off sonic mods
By this time, Friday was over and it was a complete disaster.
Then we just waited until clingy left
But i get through it. Eventually Starlight showed back up and gave me a good excuse to head into the room without clingy. We told clingy that we were heading in for just a minute or so and she had to wait outside.
I wanted her gone. I tried to lose her. She had mental issues but `not my fucking problem`
For the rest of the day, I'm stuck with clingy girl because *she will not leave my side*
Now I'm sad and uncomfortable, because clingy girl gives terrible hugs and pet me as if she was a 70 year old woman petting one of her seven cats
HOLY SHIT THIS WAS A MISTAKE
Clingy girl.
So I reached out to the other person who'd pay attention to me.
Conveniently, this was the one year that Lyssa couldn't make Otakon, and even at this point in my life, Lyssa was my anchor for when shit goes wrong or my anxiety starts getting the best of me.
Anyway, I'm there in the room, bawling my eyes out because it's like 2 PM on con Friday and my girlfriend isn't paying attention to me.
So she was spending a lot of time talking to someone outside the relationship for advice. She told me none of this until after the fact.
No. I learned after the fact that she was having some issues with most of the other people in this relationfleet beyond me, clingy, and bee.
She said nothing about it. If Lyssa said something similar to me, I'd immediately ask why she's heading back to the room and ask if she'd like me to go with her. Lyssa would do the same, I'm assuming. She always holds the key though.
I asked her for the room key, went back to the room, and just fucking cried for like 30 minutes.
After resolving the issue, I caught up with them. We shuffled around the con a bit before it just fucking leapt on me that Starlight was zero percent interested in me.
As I was getting it resolved, Starlight continued on with everyone else to the con instead of, you know, sticking with me since we were kinda counting the con as a date.
I had an issue with some terrible service worker in one of the hotel's rip off breakfast kiosks for people too busy to get to dunkin donuts
For all of Friday, Starlight *kept* focusing more on her friends and not really paying any attention to me whatsoever.
WRONG
I was like "okay, well, this is the first time she's meeting a lot of online friends, we'll have the entire day tomorrow at the con, right?"
So, we got to Otakon on Thursday, and went to get our badges so we'd be ready for Friday. Starlight did not say a single word to me unprompted.
Originally all 3 of us were gonna share a room but some last minute coordination with the head of the rooms and we swapped her out to a different room.
I'm there. Starlight's there. Clingy girl is there. Me and Starlight decided we'd just avoid clingy as hard as possible because neither of us like her at all by this point.
So lets get back to Otakon
But anyway, I've got more bee girl stories but it's all very tangential to the "hey Alice what was the straw that broke the camel's back with this relationship"
She had me blocked, often, and Starlight had to tell her to unblock me frequently considering bee girl was like 50% of that channels traffic and it made it impossible for me to talk if she had me blocked.
Because interacting with her without triggering her was impossible
So every other day, bee girl would go NUTS over something
Not "oh no I'm slightly upset you said this thing" no, these are literal fucking triggers the same as if you showed someone with PTSD the thing that gave them PTSD in the first place.
And I say trigger, I mean trigger
Anyway, all that in combination with the whole "has one million triggers and all of them are the worst thing in the world" and me, clingy girl, and creepy doll girl were all trying desperately to get Starlight to break up with bee girl. Eventually we accomplished that, but it took until after Otakon.
it seemed similar to a spider
I have that much
I don't know what a drider is
Her main goal in life was to get body mods so that she'd have horns or something and live in some sort of drider mech tank thing
because she was buzzing
Every time she would type an s, instead it was a z
Bee girl was super obsessed with bees (bugs in general, really, but bees were the main thing), hence the name.
Bee girl is possibly the least stable person I've ever met and bee girl was actively ruining Starlight's life by dragging Starlight down with her own issues.
wild
Both sides manipulating each other doesn't make it better, you just have two abusers.
<@99695384296701952> I mean even abuse victims agree to their abuse most of the time. That's how they get there, through manipulation.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Hooper they been doing difficult topics for fucking years. Sexual orientation is a god damn cake walk compared to talking about death with kids who have yet to consider their own mortality.
But people are gonna care, and sesame street should follow suit and not say anything. By making a statement, they're saying "orientations aren't things we should discuss with kids" even though sesame street has been discussing things that "kids don't need to hear" for decades. And we should absolutely teach kids about orientations, because there's more to being gay or straight than fucking.
i think you're sliding down the slippery slope in the wrong direction
do you?
I mean, there's a whole lot more to that question than a yes or a no
there are lots of morally subjective questions that I would answer with "I don't know" purely because I just don't know
Why does "I don't know" mean "yes"?
would you similarly fuck a cis girl in the ass and does the trans girl being trans matter in the slightest?
I'd say you have an inferiority complex more than a persecution complex
misandry is different from misogyny but it definitely exists in some circles I've been witness to
Even during my "I hate men" phase
Yeah this doesn't sound like any version of feminism I've subscribed to
see you're just describing a manipulative person, not a feminist
Being a feminist doesn't make you correct. I know tons of feminists who are wrong. I know of an entire sect of people who wave the flag of feminism but are all shitstains.
Another feminist friend is currently telling you that she sounds nightmarish.
If someone genuinely believes that then they have some bigger issues at play
"All men are bad" is a generalization meant to be used as a vent for women rather than an actual virtue to live by.

our debauchery knows no bounds

hang on lemme just answer that with a quick excerpt from a line convo...
<@285555416056856576>
My body would run on autopilot
But like not actually sleeping it just feels like it
Also unrelated but one of the most consistent aspects of me being high is constantly falling asleep every 30 seconds or so
I'm still convinced that you can totally cook a cookie like a pancake but I never got a chance to show off my skills
But also college parties sucked. Need that anime con room party with griddle cookies in the bathroom.
I was making dumb dota jokes (which scrmz got)
*squints* daywalker
I took night classes because that's just when I was awake
I guess I do have weird sleep patterns
Like as long as I'm getting what I paid for, I don't have anything better to do, my friends were in the same room as me anyway.
Honestly being kept late was never much of an issue for me unless I had a class right after.
Although the school may supply you with an alphasmart or something similar which are absolute ass to write on
When I was in school I had accommodations to use a keyboard
Think about being homeless because you very well might be.
man who committed assault arrested for assault
well that was a pointless 13 minutes coulda just linked to anita's tweets instead
"Do I really have to even explain this?" nope, cut the video
I guess
You're free to play however you want but it's not like carries are frowned upon.
I mean. It's an MMO. The second M has a meaning.
I don't know exactly how much it is. She handles it almost entirely to make sure that I don't go broke.
My "rent" is ridiculously low too, because I pay my mom, who promptly gives me the money back.
Disability gives me exactly enough for "rent" and SNAP lets me eat. I do not get any money to pay for things that aren't covered by insurance.
I love NY but if I had to support myself I'd disappear in a heartbeat.
Everyone wants to live here because there's so much shit to do.
Same for NY
I only get by because I don't have to pay for food and my mom helps me with rent
Gotta work two full time jobs if I want to support myself in New York
try 4000
ahahahahahahahaha 2000
I'm in New York so if I worked retail for minimum wage I'd actually make less than I do on disability.
Varies depending on state.
Less than living wage stateside
You kind of have to trust the government to actually support the workforce.
But America does not have proper regulations
I guess with proper regulations, capitalism isn't the worst system
(hyperbole)
And you get no days off here
In America customers tend to be entitled assholes more often than not
I don't know how it is in Germany
Oh, right, you're German
But yeah other economic systems wouldn't change the job much but at least you'd be able to earn a proper wage in retail.
I mostly hear stories of customers who suck
I don't see many people who enjoy retail
Oh
Like okay the job would still suck in any other society
Retail is the worst part of capitalism
...can we still talk about the perils of capitalism
Well I did want to talk about the "this would be a great setting to discuss the perils of capitalism" thing but solo bowed out anyway
I'd own a gun if I weren't a risk to myself.
I would argue for gun rights but only because being trans is scary.
Yeah
Also yes, the second amendment was written with the intent that if a second revolution is needed, it will happen.
Sanders and Ocasio are socialists, not communists.
That's not what I said though? I just said that socialism isn't communism.
Socialism =/= communism
Even past his term, I don't want to sit passive as someone even a fraction of as bad as he is starts gaining popularity
2016 got me out because the mere idea of Trump was scary enough. Trump actually winning is what's gonna push me every year from now on.
I'm committed to voting every year now though.
2016 was the first election I ever voted in despite me being able to vote earlier. I just didn't feel the need earlier because I wasn't feeling the pressure.
I know I'm getting out of the house for it.
I hope that the shit Trump is pulling now is motivation enough to get younger people voting during midterms.
Ocasio winning her seat was huge though, because it shows socialism can fight under the banner of democrats and still take a win.
Technically Sanders and Ocasio would more appropriately run on a different ticket, but filing themselves as Democrats gave them more visibility.
It's ass backwards and it's time to change.
The US has more, but our elections are set up so that only two matter.
<@!102691114762371072> I've seen some right wing advertisements. That's probably not fake.
yeah
Recently I saw an ad on TV about "the radical left" and how we would push for "socialized healthcare" as if it was a bad thing
Socialism, basically.
Even without talking about who's actually president, I am rather upset that Bernie Sanders lost considering he was a politician actually interested in representing me.
I'm on my father's insurance for another year and then I have to rely on medicaid
About half of what I get now
Well they wouldn't cut me off, but they'd severely reduce how much they give me
Broke from the government cutting me off, that is.
There's much less room for the SCOTUS to actually do anything when talking about the constitution rather than when talking about the law.
SCOTUS CAN interpret the constitution, but they're still bound to uphold it in its word AND in its spirit.
The system isn't perfect, but it's pretty good when it works. Unfortunately, the electoral college has overstayed its welcome and the system hasn't been working for a while.
They never make or pass laws, they only review them.
That's also why the judicial branch is pretty far removed from the other two, I think.
Stuff like marriage equality
And then we have the SCOTUS to interpret laws if we really, really have to
that's it
That's why there aren't many amendments. We deal with most issues through the executive branch and the... I forget what branch house and senate is called.
NOT as the primary method of creating laws
Amendments are there as a "we cannot predict the future and we might have to add to the constitution sometimes" thing
So, since it's really really hard to actually get that kind of consensus on an amendment, most US law is determined through the federal and state laws.
However, the sheer amount of bureaucracy present in this process makes it really really hard to actually do. For good reason!
If they do, congratulations! We have a new amendment.
Anyway. Either way, you need 3/4 of the states to be on board after the amendment has been proposed.
Oh I'm not a lawyer I don't know most of this as well as I could. Don't take my word as gospel.
The second is for 3/4 of the states to ratify it through legislature.
The first way to ratify the amendment is for 3/4 of the state governments voting yes.
However, once the amendment is proposed it must then be ratified.
It likely will not ever happen
This has never happened
The second is that 2/3 of the state governments can come forward and say "yeah we should really probably be doing this thing, let's make an amendment"
The first method is for the amendment to be proposed by congress. In this scenario, 2/3 of the house and 2/3 of the senate need to vote for it.
So there's two ways to propose an amendment and two ways it can be ratified, or written into the constitution.
So with the whole "federal law" thing, there's not a whole lot of reason to amend the constitution unless most of the country decides it's for the good of the people.
It's important to note that the rules defined in the constitution may bend as long as they don't break. You can interpret different laws in different ways and it's up to the SCOTUS to tell you whether the interpretation is valid or not.
So what's the constitution? The constitution is a set of rules that *must* be followed if the state wants to exist as part of the whole.
In general, if you're in the states, you're following state law, not federal law.
What isn't the constitution? A lot of things, really. In the US, we have federal law and we have state law. Federal law applies on things that go beyond states, as well as on things that states don't cover to begin with. This is surprisingly little, but it is worth mentioning that federal law influences state law, and a state going *against* federal law is grounds for the federal government to do things such as pull funding for that state.
Okay. Time to talk about US LAW. And, more specifically the constitution and why it's so hard to add an amendment. But before we talk about *why* we need to talk about *what*. We need to talk about what is the constitution, and more importantly, we need to talk about what isn't the constitution.
ill type i up after dilating
house = states
different numbers for house and senate i think
If a corporation wants to be greedy  then the government should stop them.
```the whole ideology of "if you work hard you get rewarded highly". and then be like "this person works 80 hours a week and barely makes a living but they are doing it wrong" is like wut```This is basically the core principle of communism without corruption. People should not be overworked just to survive.. Tax the rich, pay the poor.
Discussion here has been civil so far, keep it up
Anyway i need to dilate
Don't trust the private sector
Government funding for R&D is what we need
Anyway, meds costing money doesn't give us better medicine, it just gives us rich executives.
No one points at Canada and says "hey look it sucks there"
...Canada is socialist
The "look it failed" is a communism thing
Yorin, we're not talking about communism. You're the only one who brought it up.
what the fuck is going on
why is every country electing fascists to office
what the fuck
"Dude, you're creeping people out, can you stop?"
Anyway I'm gonna go play maplestory for a bit. Politics is draining.
Failing proper research, I WILL blindly vote dem, but being informed is the best policy.
^
You gotta keep fighting.
The important take away is not to settle. Don't elect democrats to congress and then say "Our job is done!"
Democrats have their own issues, but right now we just need a way to fight back against republicans in congress.
While democrats are still not really that great, it's important to note that the two sides really aren't the same.
Democrats aren't much better, but they're the first step towards actual change.
It works in theory. In practice it's not working right now.
Our constitution outlined a form of government that does not work with the current state of affairs.
The current issue in government right now is that if it stays the way it is now, *they can outlast that delay*
In American law, any law that would affect how the government operates needs to take a certain amount of time to come into effect in order to ensure that the people voting on that law aren't doing it in their own interests.
Midterms are way more important than presidential elections.
And that's why everyone needs to fucking vote, ESPECIALLY in midterms
yeah
Which uh
Also true, impeachments go through congress.
It's hard but it's doable.
It's worth noting that SCOTUS justices can be impeached.
Supreme Court
Because the SCOTUS can't just overturn things without reason, so whatever reason they give HAS to mesh with everything else they do.
But that's much harder than making the decision in the first place.
Correct. SCOTUS can also overturn *their own* decisions.
roe v wade established that it is unconstitutional to ban same sex marriage and all of the state laws against it were effectively null as a result.
Prime example: roe v wade
For something not in the constitution, SCOTUS can look at the law and say "this is bullshit, do it over"
I've discovered TERF memes and I'm simultaneously upset they exist and amused with how bad they are.
It absolutely does not hold up in EU countries
It probably won't.
True, but the relevant laws are almost entirely for the benefit of the consumer.
Unless you sign a contract - and in most cases you don't - the company is still answering to actual laws
EULAs and TOSs aren't above the law, though.
DDOS attacks by their very nature are illegal
It merely proposes them
The ToS does NOT define valid reasons
You can still sue them if they take it away from you for no reason
```even the best medicament has side effects that may appear (not on everyone)```I far prefer having RLS (treatable) than depression
oh
why not
this is true!
also im in Queens so it'll be even further since you've gotta cross a bridge
you'll also have to cross all of upstate new york
"relatively"
Hugs may be mailed to my new apartment in NYC starting in three weeks time.
Or if you're lucky, only almost kills them.
But yeah, Brugada is a heart disease which is incredibly hard to detect and probably would not be noticed on an EKG unless you're looking for it. You generally find out about it once it kills a family member.
Brugada isn't much of a factor in my life unless I decide to hook myself up to an electric fence.
I have a disability card but that's for literally crippling anxiety.
So I'm good
I have that
Which I mean
Yeah, estrogen
I have a "good" pattern which basically means that it's there but it's not doing anything. I have to be extra careful around electricity.
bit late to the discussion, but I have Brugada syndrome which is a genetic defect that just randomly kills you.
ah, that sucks
I would imagine the pain you experience is acute and not chronic so would opioids even get you anywhere? I've done both for acute pain and the weed is honestly more effective because I can take higher dosages safely.
i guess i need to move to minnesota
while the working class gets shafted
it looks like people are tired of rich people getting breaks for being rich
or why the protests became riots
i was reading an article but it's kind of not telling me anything about why there are protests
What exactly is going on with Paris right now?
Or on track for the first time.
I get that, and for me the answer is kinda just... do whatever you can. At the very least get the bare minimum done while you work at getting your life back on track.
That's unfair, some people like eating ass
I personally would probably be a heavy drinker if I didn't think the stuff tasted like ass
A lot of people drink anyway because they don't care
Estrogen makes that chance basically non-existant
One thing I can personally speak to with HRT is that I have a rare heart disorder which was liable to randomly kill me some time in my 50s.
I get the feeling that taking a break in this instance would be rather long term
I'm talking to Kriisa right now.
I'm gonna step in and say again, this is a server where everyone is supposed to feel comfortable. If Kriisa is asking you not to sleuth, then don't sleuth.
The server's foundation is one on which as many people as possible can feel comfortable and at home. You will not be bullied out of here. You may bring any issues up privately with me.
I personally have very little money to actually survive with, I'm supported by my family and I'm extremely lucky that I actually can get the procedures that I need
And if they are from high income households, they might not have the support of the household itself.
And uh. Trans people largely are not from high income households.
Not to mention that the cost of testing can be high and then that locks lower income people out of anything should health organizations require testing before treatment.
I'm always cautious about research like this. "Oh yeah your test results came back, you're not trans you're just looking for attention" and "Your unborn child is gonna be trans do you want an abortion" are totally things that could come out of these studies. Like it's great to have hard scientific validation but at the same time that science could be used for less than noble arguments.
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
Bit late but if people ignore a "can you take this conversation to another channel" the first one or two times then rule 3 exists for a reason.
I can see where it might be used as the punchline to a joke, but generally people making jokes like that need to have their humor recalibrated away from the "shock humor" end of the scale. Joking about someone committing suicide isn't really acceptable ever imo but some people just don't get it.
why not
just because like
i would aim for the big leagues but not with any hope of making it
personally i am the sort of person who is happy with getting nothing accomplished but trying to do the right thing so even if rakhi isn't a fan of prevalent methods of politicsing i could see her being happy with doing whatever is just rather than whatever works
What did I wake up to? While not everything in this channel needs to be super serious, if the conversation derails please move it to a more appropriate channel.
If you can't do something, then you can't do it.
No one is ever obligated to do anything for another person. You've gotta help yourself before you can help others.
As long as it's not a massive rule violation
how does anyone like the taste of alcohol i literally do not understand
you just accept the way it tastes because you're so deep in it that you can't recognize it as bad anymo- how
that's not an acquired taste, that's stockholm syndrome
yeah like holy shit alcohol tastes awful
whiiiich is why i only do drugs legally
i can assure you that getting your ass blasted and letting the world melt around you as you become an ever growing apparition of hunger is totally worth the risk:reward ratio, assuming you don't get thrown in jail while acquiring the goods
vertigo as shit
god i could never do that
but, like... shrooms. I kinda wish that you know maybe some of my dealers didn't wear lab coats? because keeping it legal really limits the potential for the psychedelic shit
y'all valid as heck
also a valid way to make it fun
life is short and if you don't make it fun you're already losing
you're never too young to do something simultaneously outstanding and deadly
i can either die slow and old or go out in a literal blaze of glory and god dammit hand me the lighter
i refuse, more caffeine
hence the rampant drug usage
I am a walking disaster it's great I'm honestly ready to just fall apart at any moment
at the very least, this is what i was told by a therapist who may or may not have been lying to prevent me from going deeper into a panic attack
what happens is after it gets into your bloodstream, it's more than your body uses all at once so it works over a period of time
only certain meds absolutely require you to get every single dose but drug companies tend to design away from that because it's asinine to expect someone to never miss a dose ever
the meds stay in your system long enough that missing a dose usually isn't an issue
once every other month
happens like
nah i just forgot because i was busy
and fuck i forgot my night meds
it's not the arrhythmia i know i have, and it's not a heart attack since it's been going on way too long
but like
maybe some other form of arrhythmia, it's probably a good idea to get it checked out
no history of heart attacks and what im feeling could only be a heart attack if anything heart related afaik
so i don't have too much to worry about, like i have the gene but it doesn't do anything to me
and estrogen helps
and my rhythm is typical
I have Brugada in my genetic history
originally i just thought i pulled a muscle but its been going on way too long for that
probably i guess
and then you die
and cardiac arrest doesn't feel like anything, you just get airheaded and faint
it's cardiac arrest
but it's not a heart attack i have to worry about
yeah kinda
and uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
the only thing i ever maybe go overboard with is the weed but that is because i know exactly how hard it is to get a lethal dose of weed
don't drink either. full stop. hate the taste.
i never mix drugs holy shit that is a good way to od
i drug myself responsibly
watered down energy drinks don't qualify as drugs <:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
but it still hurts
"Also ‘days on end’ of symptoms are typically not a heart attack either" okay so it's probably not a heart attack
lying on my right side makes it worse which is annoying because that's the side i lie on to use my laptop
most of the time
well
it doesn't feel like cardiac arrest according to what i've read, and I'm at risk for cardiac arrest rather than a heart attack so I'm not like super panicked but at the same time also please go away sharp pain in concerning location of my body you are not comfortable and i like being alive
ive had a weird pain in my chest around my heart for a while and hahaha i hope i dont die
I mean if someone is loudly breaking rules over the pettiest of shit I'd say it's pretty funny when they get whacked without seeing it coming.
they've told me as much before
it is difficult when a large part of what they do is try to take opportunist blows at people and turn communities against them
I know who it is right now. If they're banned and rejoin, I don't know who to suspect
And yes they've harassed me here
They've done it elsewhere
Considering it, but I don't want the person to just make endless new accounts and keep rejoining
And that should be worrying for everyone
It doesn't make me feel that great to know that someone cares enough to harass me but the entire staff team that used to be here does not care enough to defend me
And as the founder, I have a pretty good idea of what that ethos is
And to say "it's only discord" is to go against the very ethos this server was founded on
I've locked accounts in other locations over it too
They've been directly harassing me for a while and nothing has been done. It's not a matter of perspective.
Between intimidation, manipulation, and flat out abuse I don't know what to do about it
I have not been feeling safe on this discord for a while now (about two weeks) and while I will not name names, I don't know what to do
this conversation has taken a less than serious turn, should we continue in general?
living in nyc helps a LOT with that
im like, half vegetarian. I usually get something with protein in for my first or second meal of the day but my last meal of the day is almost always vegetarian
I'd go vegetarian if I weren't addicted to soup dumplings
I generally prefer the taste of vegetables over meat
oh, eating veg is ridiculously good and easy to do if you don't rely on ordering out
there really is no replacement for worcestershire sauce
rarely used, sure, but very important when called upon
no. no the 8 sauces have their reasons. do not abandon the sauce.
gonna go to a japanese market later today and just load up and cook all week
that's what I'm planning on doing
it's like... that's his element. That is where he thrives best.
mutual friend of mine and lyssa's used to work in a kitchen for a while and seeing him cook is mesmerizing
like "oh yeah i have a bunch of random shit im gonna make a food" i don't know how to make that jump
like i wanna learn how to be more flexible with my cooking but it's so daunting
i still just follow recipes
but thanksgiving is the main event because we're not bound by jewish traditions on thanksgiving
every other holiday almost
and like
he is the family chef and cooks for thanksgiving
he has good taste in ingestible objects
american yes, but i imagine it's not very piss if my brother drinks it
he has described natty boh as "the most trash beer" and promptly informed me that if there were ever a beer to hate, that would be it
according to my brother it is possible to do worse than champagne
enough to burn your stomach through
i also don't like fizz
i don't like alcohol in general but champagne is wretched
i thought it was orange juice
9
i drank champagne once by accident when i was like
eugh
it tastes like pavement and crushed dreams
That's my most recent "fuck you we're not doing anything" but yes
"Wait two weeks"
I'm worried that the amount of time spent without those particular nerves being engaged is gonna lead to them being deadened and once I can try doing anything I'll be physically incapable of it.
It's been almost a year and a half since I last orgasmed and my sex drive is completely demolished. This all should have been resolved and fixed maybe a year ago but everyone involved has been dragging their feet and I'm left without any solution.
it's hard to stay away from dangerous things when you're on the 17th floor and have windows
i dont know what to do
almost killed myself earlier
i have not been doing well recently
The kinds that hallucinogenic drugs give you
Hallucinations for the rest of my life doesn't sound so bad when you account for the fact that the rest of my life at that point would be less than a year.
I guess I'm just gonna have the depression magnetized away. If this doesn't work I'm going with psilocybin whether I get a prescription or not.
It's not functional. I'm not okay.
Currently, my best includes
-Inability to leave my apartment
-Complete and total apathy to just about everything
-Playing video games, except with slightly more enthusiasm
I'm currently in a more verbal state. That's not unusual for me later in the day. It's why I often force myself to stay up past reasonable hours, that's when I'm feeling at my best.
I still have no motivation to do anything.
I still want to die.
I'm still depressed, the only things that've been treated are the manic phases.
Right now I'm on meds that treat the suicidal ideation and the suicidal ideation alone.
The longer I go without proper treatment the more immediate the risk of suicide feels and at a certain point the desire to die is going to overpower the instinct to survive.
I almost killed myself a few days ago. Less than a week.
All that aside, <@138131889142628352> the alternative is death
The only thing you are accomplishing here is making me not want to talk about my issues, which is very counterproductive.
Pushing someone else's issues aside and proposing that they do what has worked for you and only what has worked for you is neither constructive nor helpful. Your advice is acknowledged and unwanted. I've tried your methods. They don't work for me. The only thing that has proven consistently effective for me is medication. This includes typically recreational drugs. In the past this has meant painkillers and marijuana. Psilocybin happens to be one drug in particular that has shown effective in not just treating but curing depression, although research in that field is still too new to conclusively declare it as a truly permanent solution.
Your clarification was just as bad as the original statement.
We are different people. Our issues are not the same. I don't want to debate you on this.
I understand you're trying to help. You're taking the wrong approach.

Further, I'm bipolar, so TMS might not be a viable option for me considering that my manic episodes involve me trying very hard to not kill myself.
It's expensive, insurance doesn't always cover it, and it's still experimental. Moreso than the psilocybin route, I think.
My issue is to the point where transcradial magnetic stimulation is an option and you don't do that to people who don't need it.
I understand your line of thinking and appreciate the concern, but the issue is far and away from "relying on drugs to be happy" and, moreover, there is no tangible change to be had. My brain doesn't work properly.
But the week you don't want to kill yourself is really quite a lovely week
I am most people
But most people just get more suicidal after a week
If they work they are fantastic.
Like Zoloft
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors
But right now my options are
-Hold myself hostage and demand SSRIs with some very solid managing of the suicidal bits
-Take a leap and be a guinea pig for psilocybin
-Magnets
...but they can also go in the opposite direction, no one is really sure how exactly they work so research is ongoing
They can permanently alter your mind and as such are a potential cure for depression and anxiety.
shrooms
maybe i can get a psilocybin prescription
just enough to make me forget that I'm alive
i just want to drown my life out with drugs
I'm not okay and I haven't been okay for a very, very long time.
I don't care enough.
I can't do anything.
I don't do anything.
So of course they won't give me SSRIs.
I experienced happiness. Once. Took SSRIs for a week and then got suicidal again.
I'm not suicidal, I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.
There is only an endless road of "Maybe next time" and "It'll get better".
There is no happiness.
There is no joy.
I have zero motivation to live my life.
```I can't due to the owner owing me something```Is what you're owed worth more than your mental health?
I suppose at the end of it, <@284390402210136064> you're important and having you around is better than not having you around.
Sorry, got a call. Back here, there might not be an end in sight, but maybe it's just around a corner and you're closer than you think. When you're already at the bottom, the only way is up, so at the very least things can't get worse.
I mean, it wasn't too long ago that I was in here talking about some rather extreme methods of solving depression. There are ways out. It *can* be done, the important part is realizing when something isn't working and saying "well okay, I'm gonna go with this other thing then"
It's... hard. It's very hard very often. But it's possible to get past hard things. You don't have to go through or over. You can go around. Sometimes it's okay to say "this is too hard" and try something else.
I get that a lot. It's not fun.
Is there anything you can think of that might help?
One thing to note is you're allowed to be both depressed and dysphoric, and fixing one doesn't necessarily fix the other. You're allowed to be depressed even when other people say you shouldn't be.
~~That thing R abandoned~~

hmmmm. Where did I plan on ranting about communism then...
it wasn't?
that one seems most likely
or maybe it was always serious-discussion and has existed in this form since the start of the server and then I was like "wow no one has a place to joke about tits" so I changed nsfw-art to nsfw
alright then this one mustve been nsfw-discussion until I repurposed <#336297808221044736>
And no, there was sfw-art and nsfw-art to begin with, then nsfw-art became nsfw so that there was a place to house non-serious nsfw talk, and then sfw-art became sfw just to match.
<@285555416056856576> is there an old nsfw-discussion channel in the archives?
I don't know if this channel was renamed or if it was here all along and just absorbed the lesser used nsfw-discussion
There was definitely a nsfw-discussion channel though, that did happen.
It's possible and I don't remember an archived nsfw-discussion channel, but I could be slipping. I feel like I'd have made a serious-discussion channel right from the start just because like... politics exist.
But yeah I did talk about this in what was the equivalent of this channels current incarnation a while ago closer to right after my surgery
I'd need staff perms to check
I thiiiiink nsfw discussion was a separate channel entirely that got annexed once <#336297808221044736> became an all encompassing nsfw channel instead of just art and then this one is for the serious nsfw stuff.
Much of the clitoris is made up of what used to be the head so stimulating it feels really good but will get you absolutely nowhere if you don't stimulate other bits too.
From my limited experiences, most of what used to make up the penis is still there in the same order, but since you stimulate the nerves from the inside rather than the outside, it feels kind of "backwards" with a vibrator. Not that I can move the thing much while it's in me since my vagina is far deeper than it is wide, but that's the general feeling I get just by like, moving my hips around.
Nope, prostate is left intact as far as I'm aware. I may explore this in a future episode.
Yep! Most of what used to be the head of the penis will be used to make the clitoris but I think some of the "not quite shaft not quite head" bits get used to create an artificial g-spot
It's true though! Every single god damn story it's like "oh my god it feels so much better as a woman" IT'S THE SAME NERVES JUST STRAP A VIBRATOR TO YOUR COCK
I feel like I've been dominating this channel recently. But it's not about depression this time! If you've paid any amount of attention to me in the past year and a half, you might know that I am literally incapable of orgasm. Yesterday I decided that was stopping. Today I decided I'd publicly broadcast exactly how and when I'm stopping it on any given day. If you're interested in the sexual activities of a girl who has been left anorgasmic for 548 days following surgery, whether it be to inform yourself, to inform others, or just because you wanna creep on me, I'll be talking about it on my 18+ twitter. First tweet free of charge (as they all are) https://twitter.com/LewdCutes/status/1094354486355730432

Which, and I'd like to stress this, that's an 18+ account. I am posting this here  because it is an 18+ channel. Do not follow, and ideally don't even look at that twitter unless you're over 18.
I might hallucinate, but there's no evidence that the hallucinations will last beyond the treatment
What we do know about psilocybin is that, in medical doses, it's unlikely to do any of the scary shit that it normally does when taken recreationally.
I'd rather gamble on an unknown risk than a known one, especially when the known risk is "you will become permanently suicidal"
I really want to just go with psilocybin. Sure, it might do literally the exact same thing and it's not as well studied, but at least we don't know what the side effects are instead of "this might permanently fuck up your life and we have evidence that some people have experienced exactly that"
And I am afraid of this possibility
Ok so I'm scheduled for magnetizing the depression out of my brain but there is a very very real chance that it might also permanently put me in a manic state
oh senpai burrito?
which episode is edge works? docking scene?
what is the thing?
oh no
this is normal. can you do breathing exercises?
eugh. I need to dilate but I got waxed today and there's a special kind of tired that comes with tearing all the hair out of your body
I am willing to believe in you, even if you won't do it yourself.
Western culture puts a lot of emphasis on your relatives, and Eastern culture is even worse, but I don't think mindlessly following societal norms is a good thing.
And... I get that you aren't trans, but one of the more important notes to touch upon with trans people starting transition feels relevant here. Family isn't who you're related to. Family is who will stick up for you, the people who'll be there to help when it all goes wrong. For a lot of people, that IS who you're related to. But for some people, building your own family is an unfortunate but necessary part of life.
I don't follow your family issues entirely and I'm not expecting you to explain anything to me, but I feel like you'd be able to bring joy to someone's life, somewhere, somehow, even if you have to do it without those who you know as family today.
you are a girl, and therefore your body is a girl's body!

...although I understand the issue. I don't have much of a solution for that particular problem, but I can talk about the worries it brings
Gay or straight, boy or girl, it didn't matter to her. All that mattered was that I was me.
I'd like to chime in and say... some of the most supportive people you'll find are the people you'd least expect it from. My old housekeeper was incredibly religious, spent all day watching bible TV, and when I came out as trans, she would have fought anyone who tried to tell me otherwise.
So even if you have a sizable pile of bad things... you can still focus on making as many good things as possible.
There are good things and there are bad things, and the good things don't necessarily make the bad things better, but by that same token, the bad doesn't necessarily spoil the good.
What I can do is lead by example. I can point to myself and say, "Hey, look, you can be trans and still live happily". I can show you all the wonderful things that happen, with or without a biological family. And then... all I can do is hope that's enough. Hope that you can see those things and hope that those things are motivation enough for you to go about with your own life.
It sucks. A lot of it sucks. And I can't really make it stop sucking.
For the void left by not having that half of the family for myself, I do rely on interactions with other people a lot.
Do not have a surgical solution for that one yet, unfortunately. But... sometimes you have to build your own family. You don't always get born into the right one. Half of my biological family is dead to me. If I didn't have the other half... I can see that being a bit more than just stressful.
I can assure you that there is no end to the amount of customization you can do surrounding hormones. Most of it is painful and potentially dangerous but it's doable.
do you need me to break out the memes?
I think that counts as "dysphoric enough"
Rakhi, are you telling me that you're getting dysphoria over not having dysphoria?
The issue she's having is her body, not her gender.
I mean, Rakhi *is* a girl. That's not really up for debate.
Well, maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing to do? You can't tackle your issues without knowing what they are.
It is not! I think.
So now I'm squeezing my brain to make it stop doing that thing.
I almost threw myself out a window like two days after you left I had to get bars installed.
I'm trying!
I don't feel much different from it. I was in a good mood from the start though so really it's just a "how long until Alice tries to kill herself again" thing. The procedure isn't terrible but it does bestow upon you the worst headache you could imagine for exactly 2 seconds.
i had my first TMS treatment today, which will henceforth be referred to as brain squeezing. This is largely due to the fact that it feels like having your brain squeezed.
i hope that's not permanent
ohhhh my eye be twitching
lemme eat
fuckin

im not staff i can't yell at you. Welcome back Kriisa <:x9999bLove:462109974634692618>
asdfdasfggd
you gotta do this right when we sit down to eat i swear to god
Yeah, US has nazis. They're too busy hating everyone to put the amount of focus on trans people that terfs do.
(general you)
And you are that reason. Pull over.
If you're going slowly, get off the freeway until you can go faster. If that's not an option, there's a reason you're not allowed to drive in the shoulder.
B was the catalyst. Don't catalyze death.
You need to accommodate for psychology in all this. What will people do vs what should people do.
Then idiot C shows up
I generally do not advocate for blind conformity but if the conformity is speed up so you don't back shit up or cause a crash?
Slow driving is a hazard. Especially on the freeway, where many people might be going *over* the speed limit. Should they be doing that? Maybe, maybe not, but if everyone else is going 90 then going half of that is... not good.
Yeah Australia is... pretty bad.
hahaha we're living in a dictatorship now hahahaha what's the best country to run away to
Let humans go off and be free to be entertainers, or writers, programmers and engineers - things that *do* require human input but, you know, are fulfilling?
Why do we need jobs? I'm specifically talking about a society without any because, turns out, people hate the ones we have now and we don't actually need humans doing those jobs people hate.
We can, you know, set those up? Like of course there has to be an intermediary step but past that if we just abolish the notion that humans have to perform unfulfilling tasks for a monetary reward, we could just. Have things. And there would definitely be people who would maintain the machinery in this theoretical post-labor society.
Alright, so - I'm going to ignore logistics and pollution here, just pretend we already have the tools at our disposal - how many of the jobs people complain about could be straight up replaced with robots? We can have robots do a *lot* and most jobs are either repetitive unrewarding tasks that could be replaced with robotic labor or they're fulfilling tasks that humans would gladly do without external motivation. For the unfulfilling jobs that require human attention, we could just... be a society? And do what needs to be done in shifts or whatever? You know kind of like how we have it set up now except everyone participates because is there really any good excuse for someone to be a CEO instead of contributing to society.
Why does profit have to spur competition? And moreover, do we *really* need competition? Maybe we need an internal source of motivation to keep doing more and better than we have previously, but we've got Wikipedia editors, people who code just for fun, volunteer firefighters, all of these people contribute to society with varying degrees of importance and none of them are competing with anyone.
I guess America can't gas brown people *yet*
I actually cannot think of a worse alternative to "we separate you from your family and then force you into slave labor until you either die of negligence or die of neurotoxins"
I think that was Melua just trying to ascertain whether you were joking or just legitimately didn't know before launching into a "and this is why you're wrong" to someone who already knows. She has reasons to keep an eye on Australia herself.
hahahahahahahahaha I'm done with that one
And every dollar you have is a dollar they don't have.
In a capitalistic, money based society, your needs always clash with the needs of those at the top, because as far as the people at the top are concerned - and these are the people dictating the society, not those who participate in society - their need is money.
And I am fairly certain none of us here own capital, but feel free to give me a tour of your factory if I'm wrong.
It does not serve anyone who does not own capital.
The only human nature a capitalistic society caters to is the nature of those at the top.
Once you remove money from the equation, you'll find some people actually just enjoy manual labor.
Yes, because our current society is broken and only benefits those with more money.
Humans are not inherently greedy, and people already devote their time to things that they don't get paid for. We're sitting on a server for an anime with a 4th season that has no official translation. Commie sure didn't get paid for that.
You get what you need. Plain and simple.
From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs
Something something Marxism
We produce quite a bit of food. The problem has always been the logistics of getting it to the hungry, which since we're not going to talk about logistics, that's not a problem.
The one that I enjoy because *I get to eat regardless of what I choose*
Then if you enjoy it, why do you need to be paid for it in a society where payment is not a factor?
<@87512939107450880> Do you *enjoy* researching your topic of choosing?
Forget the money entirely. Some people just actually really enjoy giving massages. Performing the act is its own reward.
We don't actually need money as it exists currently, we just need a system that works in its place.
Want something extra? Trade off some of your own worth for it.
Give everyone a basic level of "income". No one gets more or less than what they need. And yes luxuries are a necessity until a certain point.
Money is just crystallized labor.
Why do we need money in a society with no real labor?
At which point, hey we could have people who really like helping people figure out something else they'd enjoy - we could maybe call this type of person "guidance counselor"
Every human is going to want to do *something* with their life. The issue there isn't "what about people who don't want to be engineers" the issue is "what about the fields that would become overcrowded"
I can answer for labiaplasty though, and that answer is I wanted a vagina, not just a labia
google doesn't seem to think that's even a word
I didn't pick one over the other and I have no idea what the difference is with a laipioplasty
<@284390402210136064> I got a vaginoplasty, yes
But no, as I said, I'm done with this conversation, I can't keep going if complacency is the be all and end all
why shoot for "yeah I guess this is okay"
```as long as a fair enough % of the lower people on the ladder are satisfied

(quick glance over wikipedia suggests that he still uses male pronouns, if anyone who's been paying attention to his career can tell me otherwise, please do)
But! Getting off topic with that. <@!302063351767498752> not urgent and feel free to sleep now and answer tomorrow, but can you tell me why the word crossdresser gives you the same feeling as the word homo being used derogatorily? I haven't been a high schooler in a while, but I've never heard anyone use the word even close to that way. When I was in school, Eddie Izzard was a fairly popular comedian and that was before he came out as trans, so there was certainly opportunity.
can't just call up HR or relocate
Especially not when the affected individual is still in school, and as a result, very susceptible to peer pressure
There is a rather comprehensive disinformation movement surrounding the term to let stock standard anime nerds continue to be transphobic, and that's not something to look at in isolation
It's that way for you Kriisa, but for someone who isn't steeped in the waters of "this is bad and here's why" it might seem a bit more benign. I don't think the embracing of trap means much other than naivete.
Sometimes the reason is simple and not worthy of further introspection, sometimes it's deep and life changing, but you'll never know which unless you take some time to think about it.
I mean sure, but there's always a reason
I hope you sleep well, and I hope you can find some time to think on the terminology thing for a bit
That requires the same introspection as "Why do I crossdress but dislike being called a crossdresser?"
Like, someone had to expose you to something different, and then you had to go and think about what the difference really was that one thing hooked you but most other things didn't.
Or like... for a more personalized scenario, what if you only really ever got a chance to listen to the kind of music plays on the radio, went and said "I guess I just don't like music" and never bothered to pursue creating your own since it's all radio pop anyway
I'd be in a way different place right now, and not for the better
It's like if I just went and was all "I enjoy getting mistaken for a girl" and left it at that and never pursued those feelings and why I had them
it's fine to not like some of the mainstream terminology that identifies people like you (in the general sense, not you specifically) but it's important to think about *why* you're not too keen on said terminology so that you can understand yourself better
Like, I don't mean to come off as aggressive, but have you given it any deep thought on why exactly "crossdresser" makes you uncomfortable?
and the full explanation of what it means will just have people calling you a crossdresser
but no one is going to know what that means
<@!302063351767498752> If you're a guy, and you're comfortable with being a guy, and you wear women's clothes, what exactly is it about "crossdresser" that makes you uncomfortable?
Yeah, like, again. I don't wanna come off as being aggressive about this. I just wanna give a push toward understanding but like, hey, if you don't know and can't figure it out, that's fine, but it's always gonna be something to think about. Open minds and whatnot.
People have been against this shit all along. Twitter just gave us a voice.
People aren't suddenly offended, it's just that the offended people now have a platform to reliably tell people that they're offended. Lots of things change when you can get your opinions from twitter instead of anime news network
yeah the vic thing didn't exactly come out of nowhere
me, reading these takes


I assume that most SC writers are American and just really fucking horny
they champion themselves as reporters on japanese culture when it's very clear they only care about the porn

gonna take a screenshot
im just
hang on lemme dig up a random sankaku article
Yeah and they all suck
Even if said women aren't real
The group of people who are just really, really creepy about how they view women
Just you know. That group.
Or fucking Peter Payne
I mean I was just using them as an example. Could replace ANN with Sankaku Complex
yike, plural

We're inching dangerously close to victim blaming
like i can go and watch contrapoints all day for my opinions but in the end contrapoints isn't going to tell me everything i need to know
getting political opinions from exactly one source is probably not a good idea

making that one source a youtuber is probably an even worse idea
it's also cherry picking
and the cisses
i only censor the hets
im back to recensor you
yes courier I'm the commie sjw that censored you then too
i am the commie sjw censoring the games im sorry i had to tell you all like this
Dota 2 is the most played game on Steam and it only has very minor titty
i play slay the spire a lot and honestly you can hardly tell the genders of the characters, much less the titties
GTA's entire thing is being crass and Witcher 3 has, like, actual content to go with the titties
i generally do not buy a game if it's very obviously horny because that's just a game sailing solely on its horniness
CENSORSHIP
I'm being censored to be honest
CENSORSHIP OF FEET
But Kriisa, the commies are coming to take away my Senran Kagura foot DLC
Yeah, it's just regurgitated nonsense about commies that isn't even remotely true
Similar to the gold stars for Jews
Nazi Germany made LGBT people wear pink triangles
Yeah, it was cheaper to buy a PS3 than a bluray player
What debate? They're just talking and I'm commenting on the non-interactiveness of it all.
It's like a roomba that only knows how to go forward
Look, they just keep going
Zerona, you're not even trying to have a conversation here, you're just saying things and assuming we're listening.
Dang Ropes is also not very showy
Atelier games and Dang Ropes are probably the only ones I'd say aren't niche. And Atelier designs have... not been terribly showy, ever.
what kind of weird talking point list are you reading these off of?
why do you care *so* god damn much about anime tiddy? you still get to play the games
alright, Zerona, but I have one question to ask about all this
hoooooooooly shit
i think there's a difference in context when it's a dating app
this is exactly why i ghosted that one twitchy girl who got *way* too invested in me way too quickly
yeah teenagers are kids
I'm fucking rich and people around me were getting the things for movies
the kids played the video games because they were fucking kids
that's because you were a god damn child Zerona

```Critical reception
Early PlayStation 3 reviews after launch were critical of its high price and lack of quality games. Game developers regarded the architecture as difficult to program for. PS3 was, however, commended for its hardware including its Blu-ray home theater capabilities and graphics potential.[219][220]```
It's probably got a huge ass section on wikipedia.
You don't have to find it easy to believe Zerona, just fucking google it.
25, also was there. Everyone I knew had a PS3 for the bluray player and they were lucky if their mom bought them the newest Harry Potter game
Kriisa, it ain't happening. Like I said, a roomba that can only go forward.
The PS3 is what *started* the "consoles as multimedia platforms" thing. The PS3 is possibly the reason smart TVs even exist.
look at wikipedia
Zerona just like
We've left video game land long ago.
Zerona, you're doing an awful lot of goal post moving here. Could you like, defend a point or something? Like, effectively.
Or was it the Pentagon?
And those people's names? NASA.
this is a mess
Sony lost a LOT on manufacturing the units, made up for it with exclusivity deals.
For longer than 3 days
You become effectively allergic to water
Even the guy in the video (who probably died) is enough where it's like "okay how can I help eradicate this disease"
But yeah, basically it's not that I'm not posting the video because it's gruesome or anything, I'm just not posting the video because anyone who watches it has to live with the knowledge that more than one person on this planet has died from a disease that someone probably made up for a gritty scifi dystopia world.
You'll die of dehydration if nothing else gets you
Not 10%, just 10
There are 10 documented cases of rabies in humans where the patient lived.
I mean, if you get rabies you're probably dead anyway.
Unless you're prone to worrying along the lines of "oh no what if I get rabies"
It'll probably make you intensely uncomfortable, but it also probably won't keep you up
(General you)
I'm not even going to post the video here if you wanna see it I'll DM you
I just watched a rabid man try to drink water and it was horrifying
Why did you even start this in serious anyway? Like yeah it belongs here *now* but it's just anime tiddy
Zerona is people you talked to referring exclusively to people from /b/? You know, back when it was... I wouldn't say good, but not what it is now.

I am hungry but I have no willpower to create food and I have no money to purchase food. And also still no willpower to go out and purchase the food.
Yeah, by American standards enby children are just boys or girls, there's no in between
"Some people should be better off than other people" sounds a lot like fascism.
Fascism is what happens when capitalism starts to break down, but the populace doesn't know where to turn for an answer. Capitalism is starting to break down, much of society is built on top of student loan debt at the moment but there isn't actually enough labor to pay that debt. Everything is going to fall apart late 2019 or early 2020.
someone pops up advocating for the extinction of minority groups, that needs to be taken seriously and be very thoroughly stamped out before they start gaining traction
treating the situation like it's not worth worrying about now just gets us a much more worrying situation later
Can't get invaded by America if America has no military.
The good news is that if America falls, communism can finally exist.
The entirety of the modern world is going up in flames and there's nowhere to run.
That would be the revolution that comes before the mass exile, Yorin.
You'll see a revolution before you see a mass exile.
Yeah the people with no money are trapped
They do not represent the people, they represent the upper class.
The big issue with America is that the government is *also* the upper class.
It's how you can be a billionaire in the first place. No one can earn a billion dollars, but you can certainly steal a total of a billion dollars from a couple thousand different people.
Yeah, capitalism survives on the concept of exploiting the workers. You pay the workers what you can get away with paying and then you harvest all of the surplus value they've produced for yourself. And that goes up the chain multiple times.
American fascism isn't endemic to America. Y'all are gonna see it everywhere, we're just the most fucked up at the moment.
anti-socialist propaganda has had so much exposure in the first world that people don't realize that it's a legitimate option. The money exists to avoid the upcoming recession, but a handful of people are hoarding it.
Sure, you can just make another party. Good luck gaining any traction.
Yorin isn't American to my recollection? But getting into politics in America needs some backing because of the 2 party system we've got.
Makes the people who are questioning the morality of it all convinced that it's totally okay to hate minorities because, hey, we've got a law.
This isn't new. We get lawmakers doing this at the end of every presidential term because it empowers the Republican voters.
Sure, but at least it won't be susceptible to the one country that's gone and fucked it up how many times now?
I mean, what's honestly gonna happen if you get arrested for milkshaking a fascist? They can't keep you for long and most everyone else in there is probably going to laugh along with the whole thing because that politician is... well, a fascist, and prisons aren't known for their astoundingly high white populations.
woke up to news of nigel farage getting milkshaked, truly there is justice in this world
The numbers are pretty equal until you realize that the devs are being worked to death.
That is a 19% increase. Video games have gone up 25%. Add on to the fact that there's greater demand and crunch culture is a thing, the labor going into games is worth more than the increased price of games.
The "average" person on an "average" salary can buy more video games now than they could a few years ago, completely ignoring the proliferation of indie titles.
According to capitalism, at least.
That increase doesn't match the increase of everything else. Games *should* cost more.
And, all that being said, those increased prices *still* don't make it back down to the people who actually worked on the game.
The only justification they have is that since video game prices have, for some reason, not scaled with general inflation, some other way to recoup the costs is necessary. DLC did that just fine, loot boxes are excess.
It's calculated, intentional, and fully thought out exploitation deemed acceptable because it makes them a couple thousand extra dollars.
Exploiting some of the most vulnerable people possible, at that
extortion isn't the word. It's exploitation.
caring about concepts more than people sounds like a mental illness 🤔
gamefreak and the other branch of gamefreak that doesn't make nintendo games
Yeah, but that's just a criticism of capitalism.
I mean. I think it's okay to have big budget games alongside indie games. But pay people for the work they do and don't exploit vulnerable people in order to do so.
And also the old model of paid DLC worked just fine for making an extra buck.
the main point I'm getting at is that devs aren't getting paid enough and CEOs pocket the money that should go to the devs
like what are they trying to achieve here
Who the fuck walks into someone's "If you believe in SJWs you don't want to follow me" thread and then... tries this
On an entirely different note:
```its like they are trying to sabotage them
just so they can say "we were right all along"```This is actually the point. It's the same reason that NHS in the UK is so shit. You just pull the funding and then wait for public discontent and then your average citizen goes "why the fuck are we paying for this?" and then they vote for the government to pull the plug entirely.
like they're trying real hard and getting nowhere
The most recent transgression has been... asserting that abortion and human rights are political? You know, that thing that's true?
I spent 4 hours engaging in twitter beef with some rando fuckwad last night and it's *still* going. I finally did it. I finally upset the gamergaters.
oh i thought we were talking about manbuns
its me
I'm very upset you didn't ping me to yell at him before you banned
That is part of the matter I'd like to take up in full privately.
Regardless, I don't think Kriisa's presence would have added anything productive to this conversation but that is a matter I would rather take up in full privately.
In fact, that's exactly what R did in the screenshot I linked. We know what happened with R.
Yeah, bowing out the second I showed up was kinda fishy.
You can table it, but it might be wise to include the acting moderator in that situation in said tabled discussion.
The issue isn't whether there's a warning or not. The issue is that the system is flawed.
Does this one get a warning too? That's two ad hominem attacks.
That's why I warned and kicked her.
cuz that's what she did
If ad hominem attacks aren't okay, why was it wrong for me to warn Kriisa on New Years?
If you're saying that ad hominem attacks aren't okay then where's the warning on you?
That's just escalating the issue honestly
That's not a defense of Hana
That doesn't actually address what Hana said and is just perpetuating ad hominem attacks which are the literal opposite of constructive discussion
```
Sakimori: YukineToday at 12:03 AM
What?
if someone gets banned, it's over
if they attempt ban evasion, that's our (read: staff's) problem, not y'alls
don't chase after them telling them to gargle windex
and, for the record, no ban evasion has been attempted in this case
that was merely an example```is not necessary
Yes, and that would've been fine. But she kept going.
Sure, but do you have to use the exact words? Can you not simply say exactly what you just said instead?
Would I be similarly in the wrong for telling someone to gargle actual mouthwash?
That, in a nutshell: I specifically said Windex because I got a bottle of the stuff on my table and there are no warning labels as you'd find on other cleaning products. Looked it up afterwards, turns out I was wrong, but too late to change that. Regardless, since its already been ruled that intent does matter here - why is it advocating self harm if I were suggesting, in good faith, for someone to go gargle what I assumed was no more than some nasty ass mouthwash?
I see the "I was not actually telling someone to kill themselves" message did not get passed on to you.
And if you don't want a discussion to start from it, use announcements
"don't go after people who've already been banned" is more than enough. There didn't need to be literally anything after that.
It is saying, *to my face* "hey you did this shitty thing" when
1) I already received a warning
2) I already *agreed* with the warning

But it makes you look good because you're being "responsible"
Then *don't go into specifics about the incident*. At that point you're just shaming them but you're under the guise of not actually shaming them since the only person who knows you're doing it is the one being shamed.
For the record, at no point did I ask for an apology. I asked for no vague posting.
So I choose to do so. Credit me or speak in a general sense.
There is no way in which I can participate in the conversation *without* outing myself.
It's talking about someone behind their back without the gall to say their name - even though they're right there. You're letting everyone know that I fucked up but you're refusing to allow yourself criticism even though you're talking directly to me in public.
talk about it in either the most abstract way possible, or say my name. the words are my own, credit me for them
mixing words around is just vague posting but without wanting to be held accountable
if you're gonna use my words, put my name next to them
please stop being vague about me
Police brutality is also very relevant here, it's mostly the same thing but done on American soil so that the UN can't do anything about it.
Also, he got away with it last I checked. He got away with literal war crimes.
https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/04/22/what-motivated-fellow-seals-to-dime-out-eddie-gallagher/ this is just one person that made it pretty high up the chain of command. He's definitely not the first.
hang on lemme get the gallagher story
As for abducting and murdering... that's what the army does. They just don't bother herding them up first, they just rape and kill on the spot.
The holocaust didn't happen overnight, and there are an uncomfortable amount of fascists in the US government
I mean they're already doing the invasion part
I feel like that entire paragraph can be summarized with "they're not doing it *yet*"
young kids still got to stay with their moms and teenage boys were with their dads
concentration camps at least didn't *completely* separate families
they're worse
they're not concentration camps
socdems are a bit better, still not where I'd consider great
You can object, but you're still turning the conversation into something else. We were talking about ICE concentration camps and how they could only form under a right wind government. Which encompasses dems, who are right wing.
All the parts where Jewish monuments don't actually exist.
The issue didn't really come up, you kinda forced it when I was talking about the 3 people in Congress who actually get work done on American soil.
What about... the land that Palestinians already lived on... and that hold no cultural significance to Israel? Israel has a legitimate claim to some of the land, but not nearly as much as it has.
also trying to pivot the conversation into anti-semitism just because Ilhan Omar was brought up doesn't look too good when the conversation is originally one of "America kinda sucks"
Here's my anti-israel rhetoric: Stop fucking killing civilians
Israel should exist. It should also not be as large as it currently is and it should stop forcing Palestinians out of their homes.
anti-semitism is often dressed up as just anti-israel, but there are legitimate complaints about Israel such as being an apartheid state and forcing Palestinians out of their homes
I'm sorry what
But right now they're the heroes we need. They are the driving force of shifting the overton window back to the left so we can stop killing innocent people for no reason
AOC and Ilhan Omar are also good, but again, we can do better.
The dems advocating socialism are just a bit further left than the garden variety dems that the DNC loves to promote. Bernie isn't perfect but he's the best we got.
Remember, Obama, champion of the dems... gave the go ahead on concentration camps and allowed gitmo to function under his administration
The country's two party system is *also* bad.
The two American parties are the exact same shit. It's all right wing, dems just look left wing because they're left of center. But the center is currently pretty fucking right.
It's not just ICE camps. Those are a big deal, but there's also police brutality, we have the military preying on the poor to recruit them, we have neo nazi rallies that the police don't even stop.
If we keep going down this road, we *will* be worse than Nazi Germany
And remember, through all of this, the people pulling the strings are outright fascists. Shit needs to change.
The options are die in squalor or have a chance.
And if you don't have a good reason, maybe don't do it at all? ICE camps aren't exactly necessary, deportation exists.
Every human life is valuable. If you don't have the resources to feed or clothe *everyone* in custody, you need to stop imprisoning people.
Letting 11 people die a year in custody isn't excusable. No one should be dying in these camps. I expect a death toll of 0.
No. I'm saying we're on the track to Auschwitz.
Yeah and you know with all the nazis in the US government, I'd like for us to not get to that point. But if this shit keeps up we will definitely be getting to that point.
I'd rather be gassed than starved to death in a pile of shit.
Squalid living conditions is worse than mass murder. You just wait until they die on their own, and no part of that process is fun for the victim.
And I wanna make this entirely clear - The camps were formed under Obama. The only thing the Trump administration did here was go the extra mile and separate families.
Near the borders. Look up "ICE concentration camps" and I'm sure you'll get a wealth of information
Snowden fled the country. Manning gets tortured. Assange is facing... something, I don't keep up with him too much since I care little about him.
It *is* systemic. Whistleblowers go through some fucking shit.
So I mean. Yeah it's relevant. America goes out and commits war crimes and establishes concentration camps and like, sure you don't notice how bad it is but that's because you are not in the concentration camps
this tangent started with ```⚧ Rewatch Witch (Alice) ⚧Today at 10:46 PM

US is looking back to British Imperialism and being all "yeah that was cool let's do it again"
America just does it more because our military is bloated to all hell
yeah that. The dude who killed civilians for sport got pardoned. And you'd be nuts to think that's the only case.

It actually sucks I need more money because I can't pay rent
There's this program called SSI where even though I can't work, I can still get money to eat! And I get to go to the doctor sometimes!
So is your argument that since you can't extract *all* the money that billionaires should be paying in taxes, it's not worth going after any of it?
By redistributing the wealth instead of letting it all collect in the hands of a few?
...by taxing the people who have billions of dollars that don't need a third yacht?

And, with the advent of technology, those safe spaces can be in your own home. Although that doesn't get you hugs, unfortunately.
There are places where you can be open and safe.
Stonewall is notable, but it wasn't exactly the only place of its kind.
And... there are people like you. Solidarity is formed in adversity. Stonewall was a riot, but more importantly, it was a riot because a bunch of gay and trans people all went to a bar so that they could be openly gay and trans and the police figured out where they were. But before the police showed up, they were having one hell of a time. They still kind of were afterwards too, in a sense.
Stay safe, but also, you shouldn't hide from yourself. Because ultimately you can't. The lies only last so long. You can be trans without transition. You can be LGBT without being open.
Maybe don't take my approach that sounds like a bad time
"American South" meaning like, Texas
I actually don't know about the political climate toward LGBT people in South America
I'm guessing that was for me
...point is don't shy away from it, let your colors fly free, be loud and proud.

Long as you're not in the American South.
When I was still in college, my Japanese instructor offered to let me try on a kimono. I was too shy to say yes at the time, but I really regret it now because I kinda wanna know what they're like
there are people here who are older and are openly trans
*backlog*

BIID is a real thing and there's also a reason that Gender Dysphoria used to be GID in the DSM. The ID in both stands for Identity Disorder and the only reason it got changed for Gender Dysphoria is because the issue is solved once you take steps to alleviate the Dysphoria specifically - being transgender isn't the issue, having dysphoria is. For BIID, having BIID is the issue, because that means either you want to mutilate yourself, or you have mutilated yourself, and neither of those are healthy. So while the two can look similar to the uninformed, in the end they're actually quite different!

People with BIID absolutely do deserve to be on disability if they've mutilated themselves, and I'd argue that sometimes they deserve it even if they haven't - aside from the fact that, well, they're mutilated and are physically disabled now, they also have a condition that prevents them from being fully functional in day to day life. If a close friend or family member of mine had BIID, I'd probably look to being able to keep them safe, and that means keeping them under the eye of a caretaker so they don't hurt themselves.
And as someone who's on disability... no one wants to be on disability. That's a myth. It's near impossible to live on disability alone and not being able to work is just soul crushing in its own right.

And yeah, a lot of the time, you're gonna have to work stuff out on your own. I'm here to help, although I can speak for no one else.
Aaaaaaanyway, to steer the conversation back to <@!302063351767498752>, I don't think you're wrong for wanting to change schools. If what you've got now doesn't work, seeking alternatives is a reasonable idea. It's what I did, and it worked at least once.
https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/12/education/12village.html here's one. Those are my classmates in the picture, I'm hiding in the corner.
Also if you're interested about my grade 10-12 experience, the school's methods haven't gone unnoticed. Lemme see if I can dig up some articles.
No one knows how to handle high-functioning autism. We need help, but we need tailored help, because we all have a lot of the shit down already, but we also each have our own unique problems that you just HAVE to sit down and have a discussion and actually fucking listen
The main point I'm making here is that, other than grades 10-12, all of it fucking sucked.
Second half of 10 straight through 12: Another special school, this time tailored to individual students rather than trying to help a mass of people all at once. Only 50 kids at a time, this was genuinely the most helpful school experience in my life. This was NOT a program for disabled kids, it was a program for anyone who the normal school system simply wasn't working for. I was able to socialize with people normally, get the help I needed where I needed it, and overall, I succeeded. I don't think many people would have the fortune of having access to a school like this, although it was publicly funded.

College: Complete disaster. Started out in a program for high functioning autistic kids, except everyone was insufferable and again, the services were not tailored to me. I did not need what they offered. I needed social help, instead they wanted to help me get my homework done. I didn't need help with that. I jumped right the fuck out of that program, went and tried to get myself through college just doing it on my own, and... dropped out. I can talk  more about that if you want, but it's not terribly relevant to the whole thing so I'll hold off for now.
My formal education experience was...

Grades 1-2, first part of 3: Normal school experience

Middle part of grade 3: Had to be pulled out while the adults figured out what to do with me. I was mostly isolated during this time, but I had lunch and recess to socialize. Don't remember if I had gym class or not.

Latter part of grade 3 up through grade 8: Special school for kids with learning disabilities. Easily the smartest kid in my grade for each of those grades because I do not have a learning disability, I have a social disability. Yes, the DSM classifies those as the same thing. The DSM also listed homosexuality as a disorder at the time so, you know, fuck that. What I'm saying is I was only held back.

Grade 9 and the first half of 10: Finally! A program for kids who just don't fit in! Except this is a catchall program for everyone that doesn't fit the mold, so we have the low end of the autistic spectrum in Brendan, we've got the high end in me, and then we have the future convicts like Jason and Tyree.
I've been in the same situation and honestly I do not give a fuck about keeping up with the latest front page reddit memes
If you find yourself perpetually annoyed by all of the other autistic kids in your program, it's not the program for you and you're better off trying to work stuff out on your own, sadly.
Most programs like that are for the lower functioning kids... I've yet to see a (good) program for the higher functioning people.
Also, one of my antipsychotics apparently has an interaction with my pain meds that was dulling the effects of the pain medication so I have to take more. But, you know, no one told me that until I got the prescription for both filled at the same time, despite everyone knowing I was on those two drugs.
I have been advised, by doctors, to lie to doctors about drug use. I need painkillers and if I openly talk about even weed usage, that could get me barred from receiving medications that I need. You know, despite it being a highly controlled substance and they could literally keep a schedule and notice I request it LESS often than I would if I were using it exactly as prescribed, much less abusing it.
And we're not watching every single gundam season in one go for the same reason we're not watching one piece or hxh
It'd have to be a specific season of gundam since, afaik, they're usually not related to each other beyond the giant robots
Is that a suggestion?
The plot is good, the characters are good, I love it
Also Flip Flappers is literally my favorite anime
I'd say this channel is fair game for both anime and manga
my phone autocompletes Flip to Flip Flappers and Flip Flappers to Flip Flappers porn
how long is it gonna last? and how many seasons of yugioh are there now anyway?
sneak peak at the choices for whatever anime we decide to watch after yuyuyu
_kinda just presumed any anime discussion in here would be about what we're watching but hey why not_
I guess
Missed <#337805317276565525> by a channel there
I'll put that up on Wednesday.
Cutting this one off was necessary for me but it really did feel too short
When I make the poll for the next session's time and date I'll include a question on if we want to change how many episodes we watch.
Today I actually have to cut it off though
Unless people want more
Are people dropping from the stream or leaving voluntarily?
Which is why we didn't post the link to the sub directly
Well, discord rules. We're already breaking one subreddit rule by streaming YuYuYu to a bunch of people.
`it begins`
`90 minutes`
I'm personally on the "watch all of it" train. Most shows are meant to be watched as complete stories.
I was surprised people wanted to do it in the middle of the day but I guess because it's the weekend.
>2pm EST is like 11am PST if I recall correctly
It is! I noted this in the announcement earlier.
(so in like, 15 hours and 30 minutes)
Whenever we're watching anime it'll be at that link

We have successfully made an account! https://lets.rabb.it/886j/CqMNJoAFpH
If there's rape I'm gonna say no to it being a thing to watch for ddac
Anyone is free to host it themselves in my absence though, just send me a DM and I'll announce stuff
I still wanna do it but after sorting some stuff out. Could be a few weeks.
Sorry for lack of communication. No one showed up last week and also everyone's busy this weekend.
Since Inferno Cop is so short
If the current tie stays, we'll end up watching Inferno Cop and a coin flip on the other two
tomorrow
oh, when not what
We're gonna finish up YuYuYu first (unless enough people object), but right now Flip Flappers, Princess Principal, and Inferno Cop are all tied in first place with 8 votes
4:20
weed
i can see it!
K-On!
I mean I haven't seen any releases *without* your name on them recently <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Should I take it off you?
You were credited in one of the shinai subs and I was told you're yametetomete so I gave you the role
i swear the channel name has always been like this
I might make an announcement post asking for input
Probably the most convenient time but last time we tried no one showed up. We have more people now though.
No idea. We'd need to figure out a day and time that works for everyone
No one's really been discussing it.
they get fired
"my president is an idiot"
and if they're like
that's the guy who gets checked "can you follow orders"
the guy who's not the president
fun fact TWO buttons need to be pressed for america to launch nukes and only the uh

uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
there's a thing i should probably say except i dont know how
<@456226577798135808> please take over for me i am currently stoned and dont know how to write
wtf its 6:51
oh
im saying ill fill it out when im not stoned
time is a concept beyond my comprehension
whats the link for the rabbit room?
so it's 7 PM
NY is currently GMT-4
ysll getting fucked by est vs edt
`what is the time`
ok
For instance like when I was asleep and gay while you pinged me
Also please remember that <@&336302034070536192> exists for a reason if you need an announcement made. Two other people can do it you know.
10 minutes left
So what exactly is the room going to be?
I've figured out how to group watch properly
also wait how many episodes are we doing? All of them?
go
<@456226577798135808>
not functioning
oh, today is k-on day isnt it
i think so?
i am
im literally preparing my morning dilation right now
huh wha
only the finest
If anyone wants to suggest a new name, I'm open. Might change it to just "anime-club" for now.
I named it this because I made the channel right around DDLC being the cool thing to stream
Oh, so there was some discussion about this channel's name
also theres two instances of rape in the first three episodes
in an anime about lesbian sex, the mc is straight
valkyrie drive is hot garbage
i see the appeal it just isnt me
not gay enough
and THAT is an anime about two girls, one of which is explicitly in love with the other, adopting a small child and becoming her parents
"how gay does it need to be for alice to watch it unconditionally" maidragon gay
thats the baseline
it was gay enough that i didnt
i almost dropped maidragon
relaxed sols arent my thing
i dropped gochiusa too
and k-on doesnt gay hard enough
i think i fell back asleep two or three times while rereading the sex scene with Foo. gay things make me sleepy.
nah. K-on doesnt seem like my style
and this morning
i was busy playing mutiny last night
buy mutiny now while you can! and then donate to their patreon
it won't be $1 forever
madoka is going to seriously cut in to time i could be playing mutiny
12, gotta watch the movies too
So... half an hour to go. Has there been a rabbit link posted anywhere?
<@!284390402210136064> helppppppppppp
it just doesn't have urobuchi's name attached and it has a happy ending and it came afterwards so people just don't give it a chance
yuyuyu was better at being madoka than madoka was at being madoka
ive been thinking about madoka since we did the madoka rewatch and honestly madoka is way overrated
<@&448228101089132544> we in business
i should probably finish actually reading this scene before we start...
id be up for it!
im back
<@!284390402210136064>
Madoka showed that you can absolutely tell a story in a magical girl anime. But now it's time for other anime to actually tell their stories, without asking "Is this breaking trends?" because the answer is no, Madoka already did that for them.
Madoka's an alright introduction, and it broke a few molds, but in the end, people treat it as this pinnacle of magical girl anime and it's just... it's not. It's the start of the genre, not the end.
And it didn't have the impact it COULD have had.
Yeah, but they told that story very inefficiently.
We need to do Yuyuyu after K-On
The scene with Fuu crying was devastating, because the show took the time to set up a connection between the viewer and the characters.
Yuyuyu had the same amount of episodes and I was bawling halfway in.
Madoka might have worked better with more episodes, but Yuyuyu proves it didn't need to.
Compared to Yuyuyu, it doesn't do as much as Madoka, but I actually felt something there.
It felt hollow and meaningless the way they showed it.
Sure, but maybe they should have dedicated more than one episode to that.
They could have focused on that a lot more. Kyouko is basically a complete unknown for the entirety of the show. Her character development is confined to one scene as far as I can tell.
But then that does nothing to patch up what they could have done with Kyouko and Sayaka, but instead just decided to end it with "well yeah, Sayaka was already gone and Kyouko kinda just threw her life away there"
So the shock factor is lost on me.
That's why I said "maybe it's on me for not going in blind"
No.
Because the show never made me care about her to begin with.
And I was like "okay I guess Mami is dead now"
I mean, maybe it's on me for not going into the show blind, but Mami dying didn't feel significant to me. She was around for 3 episodes, acted as a bit of a mentor but never really had any foreshadowing of what she could have done if she had lived, and then she died.
But, in the end Yuyuyu did all of that WAY better than Madoka did
I felt something when Homura was spilling her heart out for a Madoka that could never truly understand her motives
It doesn't make me feel anything when they die.
That doesn't make me care about the characters
I don't like the schtick of "the show just has to show increasing amounts of despair!"
Yeah, so what's any of it matter in the end anyway?
Mami: Don't waste your wish on someone else.
Homura: Don't waste your wish on someone else.
Madoka: Don't waste your wish on someone else.
Kyubey: Don't waste your wish on someone else.
Sayaka: ...
Sayaka: I'm gonna waste my wish on someone else!
Kyouko: God DAMN you dumb.
so it was a reference to ddlc
it used to be doki doki anime club
ok yeah thats my opinion
saki post the picture of kiri giving a thumbs up
ibu can manage the channel and messages within it now
i'll update spoiler guidelines in the rules channel later
i think it has merit. not making a role for it though, i'll just give ibu the perms directly
im not around for k-on stuff, i imagine in the future there'll be stuff neither of us are watching
that is something substatial - and seems reasonable for the channel
so we'd be on description changes as long as we remember
half of whom are anime club anyway
the channel description is something, but since it changes infrequently i'd rather you just ping staff
<#336300750248476693> should avoid clutter, so the role serves as its own announcement method. If people are inerested, they'll see it
thats why we made the role
No, you can ping anime club
2) <@284390402210136064> what do you actually want to be able to do as president of the anime club that you cant do now
1) no repurposing legacy roles
so
okay
it's 4 and ive delayed long enough
Lemme get started on dilation first
Both the matter of avatars and transformations were marked in the spoiler guide as "things you shoudn't do"
(in the other server)
I asked them to change it and they just went off on how unreasonable I was
outfit spoilers so much. When I set this server up initially, someone had an edited version of Kirika's AXZ transformation as their profile picture
Yeah, if someone is breaking the rules of this channel (spoiling ongoing or planned watches) feel free to tag staff
You can leave out the spoiler definition. I'm gonna define spoilers in the rules channel later
mugi
I should probably watch Shirobako
FliFla and PriPri made me start caring about studios
what theres a suggestions box
Because fuck the disabled
I'm not allowed to use weed to treat my disabilities even though my disabilities are totally treatable by weed
Disabilities are fun 🙃
Probably short ones
It's getting 6 movies next year
which i usually do
I see up to 23 if I have the downloads bar up
normal zoom

move it up a bit
ibu i can't even see the red line without scrolling
thursday for rebellion works for me
EDT
I have a therapy appointment from 4-5 on Wednesday
I'd also like to get Rebellion in
Being on this server should give everyone free nitro for being a part of the best server in existence.
If nothing significant changes except for magical girls dying instead of turning into witches then... just leave the series there?
But that doesn't show me how magical girls fight them, it doesn't show me how they affect the world. It just states that they exist.
They explain HOW the soul gems are destroyed. But they don't explain how magical girls operate before the law of the cycle takes them.
Not... quite. They point out that soul gems are destroyed before they can birth witches, and they say "yeah they fight wraiths instead now" but they do NO elaboration on either of those things.
Would have preferred an explanation on what the fuck the wraiths are and how magical girls operate in a post-madoka universe.
It could work if you were going in blind, but then that's a whole lotta context you're missing.
So you KNOW it's not gonna be cutesy fluff
But that expectation is cut off by the fact that it's madoka
I'd give the series a 7 and the movie a 6.
Yeah, there's a whole lot of shit going on that doesn't need to be going on. It was easy to get lost.
It didn't really build on the series in a meaningful way imo
Anyway. Movie was okay I guess.
<@284390402210136064> when you add times to the channel topic, can you also include either EDT or PDT? EDT is 5 hours behind you, PDT is 8 hours behind.
Ok so 3 EDT
Is that 3 or 4 in EDT?
Madoka Magica Rebellion - Thursday 8PM BST
in the end, Flip Flappers, best anime ever, when are we watching it
First two movies were a recap
I'm well aware that most people loved Madoka and think Urobuchi is a good director. I am not one of those people, although I do appreciate Madoka for challenging the concept of magical girl anime as a whole.
Like, different opinions exist.
Talking about things we've watched together is pretty productive I think.
It's the suffering for the sake of suffering that gets it.
It's not the drugs I have an issue with in the series as a whole.
Gonna go read Saya no Uta to torture myself
In any case, my opinion is: Movie was okay, could have eased up on the acid, didn't like the series all that much in the first place
It makes sense, but it'd make just as much sense if you were to strip away some of the extraneous visual stimuli.
The premise of the movie was fine in that case, but it's still way too confusing imo.
It's fine.
*reads log* Did moemon kill the k-on watch
<@284390402210136064>
dess_pollend
Also <@!102691114762371072> I'd say vote for either and then we can sort it out later.
Reply with just the number to vote. I'll close the poll whenever I remember to.
dess_poll Do you want to keep the group watches going?;Yes and I'd like to keep watching K-On;Yes and I'd like to watch something else;No, I don't want to participate in group watches anymore
<@&448228101089132544> considering we've gone two weeks without the K-On watch actually happening, I wanna get y'all's opinions
I'd still have to go to the site myself
I can't do it then because I refuse to give ad money to people who host illegal streams. Personal moral issue, this is not me condemning anyone else for doing so.
oh, is it not on crunchy?
s2e1?
So someone will have to ping me if things go wonky
But I won't watch
I'll host if someone tells me what to host
just an OVA
SOON AS I FIGURE OUT CYTUBE THIS WHAT WE WATCH
THIS SHIT
https://nyaa.si/view/1047568
*shoves GuP off the table*
*shoves K-On off the table*
Alright, you have your channel description editing powers back
Episode 2 can at least be read into without needing further context
Like episode 1 establishes the relationship and stuff but without later context it's weak on its own
episode 10?
and episode 1 is just nonsensical fluff up until like
the show does kind of ask you to read really deeply into it at times
episode 4 was super good and cute too aaaaaaa
Episode 3 is really good on the rewatch but it's basically just Mad Max Without Context the first time through
Like even before that episode 2 is just super pretty but episode 5 is when things start being kinda explained.
How many episodes? Episode 5 is where it starts getting really good imo.
i think im just gonna go to a site that lets you make your own shirts and slap a flifla collage on one
i usually have a rule of no anime shirts outside but i would totally wear a flip flappers shirt as much as possible
sometimes i cry thinking about how good flip flappers was and how few people watched it
Probably some time after Otakon though because it's coming up soon and I don't wanna just speedrun binge everything to get it in before I have to leave.

And also because we'll have to do a rewatch of Flip Flappers after we do the watch of Flip Flappers.
Alright 1 person good enough for me we're doing a Flip Flappers watch.
Who wants to do a Flip Flappers watch? Because Flip Flappers is Good and Should Be Watched and I Totally Don't Have Secret Plans To Expand The Scope Of This Server. <@&448228101089132544>
(this includes non-anime stuff too)
<#377148557796442134> is for anything spoilery that isn't Symphogear
i get distracted and then start thinking about the thing I'm trying to read and then i just fall asleep
im terrible at reading things, I fall asleep a lot
I still need to finish Jojos but I never have time to watch it with Lyssa <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
eventually
I'll probably give GuP a shot
I did manage to sit through all of Madoka though, even though the movie was already solidly average to me. People kept telling me the episodic format was better but tbh I liked the movie slightly more due to some pacing issues with the show.
So I figured it was the same kind of appeal that just doesn't get to me
I didin't bother watching GuP with everyone here because it was mostly all the K-On people watching it? And I didn't like K-On either
I like the designs of some of the girls but they're not the popular ones that get tons of fanart...
i've ignored gup because the whole tank thing never really hooked me
thank you, shirabe
After episode 5 though it's just undeniably gay
So they'd read more as friends than girlfriends until then.
If someone isn't focused on that they might not pick up on all the gay vibes until episode 4 or 5 though.
So I was already reading everything as gay
And also... display name
I was super into their relationship from the start but I went in expecting yuri

i think subbed is best just for consistency since gen 1-3 are apparently 4kids and no one wants 4kids unless it's to make fun of the subs more than watching the show
as are most people

I am very much not a fan of 4kids

well i have 312
the scarf wouldn't force a heal though?
which makes seaking significantly less broken
so only if the healing actually heals it
does soaking horn work if there wasn't any damage on the seaking to begin with?
the ai kinda just kept feeding me
i did some seaking healing scarf + soaking horn nonsense
i mean there are stars but they're black
no stars
no stars
am i more likely to get good cards opening the packs or trading them
ALSO unlocked
also a beta rewards deck box
unlocked
2x dragons exalted
and i have a couple packs
oh my coins stayed too
those are my options
all at 0/7
born of fire, crushing current, and hidden depths
no
everything is reset except for my collection
i have no decks
but looks like they reset that too
i have in the past
i mean
its been a while
games
bam
i wonder if support could give them back to me. I had one with Articuno that was pretty good at the time.
i could do that myself
if i had my old theme decks
i mean
I have an 800 coin challenge to win 6 tournament games and I'm tempted to do versus to get the remaining two tickets for an entry into the theme tournament
I expect no good results in ptcgo
I sacrificed my luck on XDU
i wasnt exactly being given a choice in the first place
like i had that electabuzz when i was a kid
why do these all use the old pokemon card layout and then all of a sudden, mega venasaur card
Should I go back to beating up nerds for their cards or should I actually focus on these daily rewards
(this only took 4 games btw)
Any suggestions on a deck to buy?
Alright, got the coins for a new deck and I got 2x battle compressor
`You've obtained the Yuri Fossil!`
woobats
other than that there's like
and then miltank for additional fuckery
it has gallade as its main focus
mental might was pretty good when i played last?
between the three starting decks and mental might, which one gives me the easiest wins in versus?
im only like 40 coins away
well
why is my entire account broken
well i fought zach a total of 5 times so far and got 3 stars
1 for each deck I use against them
<@456226577798135808> the NPCs won't give me more than 3 stars
why is the yellow deck so bad
this is what I'm playing
6 Jigglypuffs
against like
Arcanine, Dragonite, Beedrill, Gyrados, Machamp, and Alakazam
it's like im playing gen 1
always
kills them
Arcanine just
I attempt
good night!
I have a dragons exalted, guardians rising, and steam siege pack. Which should I open for junk to send you?
no, round 1 was different

round three is not going well
2
They threw the game
I mean, the board state was visible to the opponent. They could kill my Lunala and let me send out Salazzle for the kill, or they could leave it alive to stall for time
they killed it
yeah that was it
lemme look it up
couldve been
do you know which deck had the Yveltal in it?
it's nintendo, of course they won't help
ptcgo hasnt been on this laptop before
that was installing for the first time
well i already reinstalled
I think that Ampharos was a pull
so I have no clue which I had. I wanna go with B&W because I remember that Serperior
weird. I have cards from both X&Y basics and B&W basics
or expanded?
So I had 4 decks which are all legacy now and 3 decks which are in standard?
and I had Rallying Cry but I can just go get that again right now
but I definitely had Power Play
wait no, not those first three, it was the Black & White basic decks
also some promo deck
Green Tornado, Red Frenzy, Blue Assault, Power Play, Aurora Blast, Stone Heart, Iron Tide, and I think one that had Yveltal in it
Yeah I had a bunch of gen 5 decks
Might have had power play
i think i had iron tide too...
found it
Forums won't really get me anywhere. How can they not have contact information anywhere
i dont see where i can contact anyone about this
but no salamence
and like... i still have the articunos?
i had aurora blast
that was it
aurora blast
"According to old tales, these Pokémon are stumps possessed by the spirits of children who died while lost in the forest."
Phantump?
"Buried beneath the castle are masses of dried-up bones from those whose vitality it has drained."
Palossand has the creepiest dex entry imo
I picked pokemon back up with SuMo so this is a first for me as well, but to my knowledge earlier games in the series were nowhere near what SuMo did storywise.

Implying that his dad used to beat him
<@301205769494331393> okay, so, Guzma (one of the main antagonists) in Sun and Moon had a pretty abusive father, so one day he ran away from home and at some point before you show up, Guzma returned to his parents house and beat his dad up. In the English version, it's not very clear that his father was abusive, but in the Japanese version the line is basically "but this time I'm the one who got beaten up"
plus im gonna try to stream the opening from the hospital
it's gonna be more when i get around to opening them
must resist urge....
new hearthstone cards are making me die of hype i cant sleep

Destruction Rush... <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
oh, kay
<@456226577798135808> Is there any way to make sure I open the locked pack?
think you may be the first person ive ever known who hasnt
i
I dropped off of Pokemon after HG and then picked it back up with Moon
oh
the character not the card
He's from B&W right?
I think I had this before my account got time warped
full art AZ
i cant see im in a game
refer to above

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3yJcayQ178
Oh, right, I was gonna post this when I made this channel but I forgot
I might have had the Chespin theme deck too but the chesnaught was more likely just a pull
i think the reason I had the B&W basics but only X&Y theme decks otherwise was because i started right when X&Y came out
ok i tagged the top 5
yeah i submitted a ticket already
I had cards that were in power play though
also, looking as destruction rush's list, I don't think I had power play
which ones are trade fodder?
the rare was a pyroar
not really
well
I got volanion ex
Yeah, both Gastly and Haunter refer to being made of gas in their entries, and Gengars says nothing against that
isn't it kind of implied that professors write the dex entries though?
It's actually the rare instance of a ghost pokemon NOT being a horrifying maimed human
The Gastly line I think is actually stated to be comprised of gas

Heavensward was just a misspelling of Heavensword which was a mistranslation of Heavenrend
After a certain point, trading replaced the actual game that TF2 was and now I get to do it all over again
I am conquering the ptcgo market slowly and it feels like I'm back playing TF2 again
like smash bros
i remember when the guy who made that game just made tf2 mods
Maybe they nerfed the OSMAW or just added a literal tank to counter it
I kinda wish I still had people to play APB with but at the same time APB is kinda shit
I didn't realize it was a phone game. Or had a room for your shipgirls.
what game is that?

@everyone go vote for Symphogear characters in fighting games https://shoryuken.com/2017/10/30/arc-system-works-wants-to-hear-your-opinion-on-blazblue-cross-tag-battle/

there we go

it's fucking blank
alright i love this game already
i just want to ram people with my tiny little joltiks
the current ptcgo special challenge is murder
Memes go wherever they're relevant. If we end up getting too much shitposting and it's pushing other content out I'll make a channel specifically for memes and shitposting.

Let's do 2 lobbies of 3 and people can join later on if they want to
Alright, is it just us 6 for now?
<@456226577798135808> I know you wanted to play
I'm writing an announcement post right now
~~but i need to know your steam url first~~
Yep!
and who hasnt been on for a year
On that topic, are you sure you sent me the right steam url? It leads to someone with a different name than the one you mentioned.
I'm sending out steam friend requests as I get them. So far it looks like we'll have a full lobby or two at least.
Throw me steam info when you can to make the process easier

Any overwatch players around that wanna do comp?
girl all you did was press Q, I had to actually line this shit up
Like, `rad 6 man earthshatter` > potg goes to d.va
I feel like potg should take into account like "has the character this dude is killing been damaged by a certain skill in the past x seconds" and if yes for 3/4 of the kills you just give the potg to the person who enabled it
I still wish Reinhardt was more potg worthy
I get ana potgs in 3v3 at least
waiting for the days that my skills tanking and healing are noticed by potgs

zsenki bzesshou dsymphogear
And you fly around attacking your opponent and dodging attacks
it would be overpowered even as a supporter, but it's just an item
The only downside compared to Ultra Ball is that you can't miss with Computer Search
It's probably the single best card in Expanded
Don't remember if Computer Search is more or less valuable than Tapu Lele GX
Computer Search and FA N are two of the most valuable cards in the game
didn't finish that ladder
Right now the ladder is Computer Search and FA N so I can't afford to ignore it. Last ladder the FA was Brock's Grit so I was just like "whatever"
Or a lot on select days
PTCGO isn't really grindy, but it does require you play the game a bit every day if you want to get the FA card at the end of each ladder
I'm on a ptcgo binge right now (granted, I'm grinding to get a FA N before the ladder resets)
Card games, puzzle games, strategy games, platformers, RPGs, and miscellaneous party games definitely fall under my favorites
I have a bunch of different genres I like but I have a bad habit of playing only one game for weeks on end
When I went up to the counter to buy it the clerk was like "Do you wanna preorder the new call of duty" and I just locked eyes with him and said "Take a good look at what I'm buying"
I think it was like Witch's Wish or something
I once played a DS game about witches and it was painfully apparent that it was for younger kids but god damn it was cute and that's all that mattered
I would if I had a desktop that worked right
Because whoever was before him - I think Riku? - was not easy to beat
Marluxia was super easy in Chain of Memories and I'm not sure if that was intentional to let players listen to the ending song repeatedly or not.
like what if the trainer is a sociopath
I dunno some people are just emotionally manipulative
and that just seems fucked up like "I evolved because I was so happy but now my trainer kicks me out of the way whenever they come home :("
but they dont devolve when they're unhappy
okay so some pokemon evolve at max happiness
FFXIV isn't all that great for cosplaying to begin with but I'll be damned if you can't make some pretty outfits

i got shittergraft, toki, meme-tinker, the tower no one even bothers remembering the name of, countess assmore, and
too busy climbing from my decayed ranks
i havent seen shudderwock yet
that's a bot function though and the botmaster is very busy
although i do want to get some self assignable roles for this server for stuff like games
because it's not a ping. only staff can do everyone and here on this server

Rogue is the Maria class
Druid is the Carol class
Also all my decks are symphogear song names which is why my spiteful druid is named Tomorrow
Got screamed at.
Spiteful Summoner
i wanna play toki
yesssssss
No he let me velen + death coil

oh

I AWAKEN FROM MY SLUMBER

100% Spitefun Druid here
straight grind from the bottom of 5 and now im 2
My hearthstone muscles hurt
Or Switch
Are they on 3DS VC?
Only a Wii
Especially when I have the hardware and the game is localized
I don't like using ROMs
who wants to mail me their Mario & Luigi games
I feel tempted to play the Mario & Luigi series over again, but I lack 1) All of the games (I used to have M&L and PiT but I must have lost them) and 2) a device to play the original o- WAIT NO I HAVE A GBA
BC pipes are so fun to use and I kinda hate how simple TE pipes make things

HOW
dont play it
who i will have much pleasure using this card with, since her hero power is "restart your turn"
One of the monster hunters in Hearthstone
holy shit toki is so fun
i hope i get whisperer again
they burned all my good cards

im being fatigued to death
Tess is basically miracle rogue
no
this applies to echo
and my treasure makes spells that dont start in my deck cost 1 less
all spells get echo
no its that bosses hero power
34 deadly poisons
So instead I just played uhhhhh
I mean I had that earlier but squandered it because I didn't realize it'd go to zero cost instead of one
<@!284390402210136064>
Toki > Darius > Tess > Shaw
Tess is my second least favorite hunter
3 elekks in a row and i reveal naga sea witch
one of my giants looks funny
do you have a maiden of the lake?
especially with reinforcements
dragonfire always
welp
45 damage board clears + 4 ice blocks
this is what your hand should look like when you get to tess in the final fight
reinforce
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
spell?
whats reinforcements do
and volcanoes
then use tess last and just keep ice blocking
then try to get an ice block off cabalists tome by using it as your first spell
Toki turn 8 > double time > call of the wild turn 9
also for the final fight
its the board control bucket and you need it
like 2 or 3 times at least
pick the strike bucket
also no matter what your strategy is
So you can fire at something with 2 HP, go face with raider, and then get a refreshed hero power
Killing something with Tuskarr Raider's cannon fire WILL reset your hero power
Treasure minions that fire your cannons or give you more cannons are good
If you can't pick those just give up imo
If you can't pick Entrenchment or Dragonfire Ammo, pick one of the other two cannon passives
But otherwise pick Entrenchment
Dragonfire Ammo makes your cannons good
Except Dragonfire Ammo
Entrenchment > Cannon passives
The class would be way more interesting if you just started with 2 cannons
Step 3: Lose
Step 2: Realize you have to use the cannons
Step 1: lament the shitty cannons
that's me, climbing wild with giants, because i want a level 60 hunter and i already hit legend on standard
yes
I just really like card games
...maybe?

Astolfo's gender is crossed out in their aporcypha bio
I learned yesterday that Astolfo apparently just doesn't have a gender in the Fate universe yesterday and I didn't think I could like them more than I already did
Remember that Astolfo is the best character and you should use them as often as possible.
but they're good trash
Astolfo is best enby
Astolfo is why I'm playing FGO now
Astolfo is Good
The only issue I have is I'll be juggling XDU, FGO, Hearthstone, and MS2 AND I'm going back to 3 dilations a day.
might as well download at least for now
...how much of my time will FGO eat
I'm very tempted to start playing FGO now
...but it's not stated?
So wait, why does everyone refer to Astolfo as a guy if the game goes out of its way to gender them neutrally + their bio in Apocrypha has their gender crossed out? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>

welp
i honestly dont remember if that was explicitly banned
it costs real money to post stuff up there too so nexon isn't gonna remove anything all that fast
Things you can't: Everything else
Things you can put on those displays: Cropped screenshots from in game, your own personal art
the restrictions on what you can put up are honestly so tight that i dont expect them to be monitored at all
perfect
every single NPC in this game is gay
i would play any game that has funky kong in it
donkey konga for xbox clearly
ive found the perfect guild
r/pokemon bans speculation posts i thought
(with decensor patches)
https://store.steampowered.com/app/669050/Mutiny/ who wants a good, gay VN for $1
*Kindred Spirits and Mutiny get taken down* Clearly this is the work of those damn liberals
They invent new words in their games entirely to avoid insulting intersex people.
If you were to call just one VN dev politically correct, Lupiesoft would be at the top of that list
it's the anti-sex crowd
It's not even the overly PC crowd
being spineless cowards
Honestly not gonna buy anything on Steam if I can avoid it now
KarmaSutra, Tropical Liquor, Re;Lord 1, Battle Girls, Galaxy Girls, Roommates, Sakura Sadist, and some other random junk from Winged Cloud also seem to be on the list
They just skip over them completely
It doesn't even have sex scenes unless you patch them in, iirc
Looks like Nekopara is also being hit https://kotaku.com/valves-inconsistent-rules-on-sexy-steam-games-continue-1826153796?utm_source=Kotaku_Twitter&utm_medium=Socialflow&utm_campaign=Socialflow_Kotaku_Twitter

Kindred Spirits has boobies and that's too ***Witcher 3*** much to put on a tame Christian platform like Steam
aka the 3 biggest selling VNs with any amount of slightly suggestive content
Right now it seems to be just Kindred Spirits, HuniePop, and Mutiny!!
VNs only right now
https://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/8khy7e/it_seems_this_group_is_responsible_for_the/
https://twitter.com/ncose/status/997484630273032192?s=21 there's also THIS suspicious tweet from some group that wants to demonize porn
2 weeks
https://twitter.com/Lupiesoft/status/997670565434478592 toko and stargazers are still on steam until lupiesoft gets slammed with another removal notice
if you buy them now you get to keep them
games being pulled from steam does NOT affect your library, for the record
But, again, mangagamer
I think SonoHana might be too
yep
yeah fuck steam pretty much
huniepop is being pulled, but I hate huniepop, so I have no idea where else you can buy it
Kindred Spirits on the Roof is also being pulled, but no discount on that so just buy it directly from mangagamer
no bug girls in any of their games aside from Mutiny!!
Stargazers is mostly not porn, but has some unavoidable nudity in certain paths
Toko is the only strictly not porn one
I recommend buying from those sources instead
their other games can ALSO be found on itch.io, mangagamer, or fakku
anyway Lupiesoft is a good company and you should give them money. I only linked Mutiny!! because it's 90% off in protest of some policy changes
and only one of the bug girls is really buggy
two bug girls and a fairy with antennae
http://lupiesoft.com/games/mutiny/characters/ characters are on here
Margaret also cute
But Lara is cute
okay Lirdynrae is like 50% spider
check
Lemme just uh
Mutiny!! is pretty heavy on the human side of anthropomorphization I think
are you drunk again
well I just made $55 by purchasing a $1 game
you can, as long as the game is already in your cart
Add the game to your cart, then add the dlc to your cart
The price change on Mutiny!! is in effect until Lupiesoft gets more information though, so still pick it up if you want a good game about pirate monster girls.
Yeah, who the hell compares VN takedowns to the holocaust? Most confusing shit I've ever seen.
```

I think that's the space pirate girl from Stargazers. Also has 18+ content but not quite as heavy but since the place to buy it is 18+, I'll put links to that there too.

Mutiny!!  isn't monster girl quest
<@!193408538909868033> The affected devs aren't on their two week deadline anymore, but Valve can go and say "after re-reviewing your game, we've decided it still doesn't belong on our platform"
bang~☆
no its 4
wasn't it 6?
6/3 vanilla from msog
it's just there. being shitty.
like... worgen greaser is my go to example of a "this card shouldn't exist"

it's not good in arena
it doesn't dilute the pool of any overpowered cards
it doesn't make anything else good
pack filler is okay when it's an arena card or if it enables a weak card/disables a strong card
they need to hof classic and then bite the bullet and start doing reprints instead of pack filler
they need to just hof the entire classic set
wotc may have been planning a slower meta that these sets would have been useful in, but in the end all they did was introduce the supporter card type and do nothing else.
Three sets that never saw any play. Why? Because the game switched hands from wotc to tpci and the general direction shifted in the process.
See: the ecard sets for PTCG
gonna go 5 to legend real quick
...does hearthstone count as a gacha game
no need to gut warsong commander
pseudo rush
bam
they could have just added "Your minions can't attack heroes the turn they are played"
even when they originally nerfed warsong
yeah
but it proves the mechanic isn't suffocating
houndmaster shaw
they've ALREADY printed warsong commander with rush instead
#ReviveWarsongCommander
and fuck off with the "we don't want to make changes to the base set"
also they need to add lifesteal and rush to classic and base
sv has storm and charge, which are hearthstone's charge and rush.
shadowverse got it right before hearthstone did
most control variants cut the weapon
but the weapon isn't what made the deck good, it was just insurance
5 still
If alex weren't standard, priest could- wait, no, priest has a broken alex combo right now
If alex weren't standard, hunter could get cards that support its hero power in interesting ways
If alex weren't standard, rogue could do fun things with shadowstep again
Alexstraza*
think of what they could do with everything if alex wasn't evergreen anymore
seriously though. hof classic and do reprints instead. that'll open some design space real quick.
so yeti is pointless against auctioneer because by the time auctioneer is being played you need to have a good big removal or a good board clear
you don't play it on curve
it's not really a drop at all
well
that's a 6 drop
Azure Drake
it's, imo, one of the worst designed cards in the game
you dont want to devolve your opponent into it
you dont want to evolve into it
you dont want it in your arena draft because of its low health
The FGC can totally say "we're playing the old version of the game until you cut your shit"
if you just go *without playing the newest game for a while* then at some point devs are going to either stop doing DLC or start doing a real DLC model
but like
...so why do people buy it?
It could *still* be legitimate in that they may have underbudgeted the game on the hopes that DLC would make up for it, but having them in story mode feels wrong.
if they show up in story mode then fuck that noise
was being typed before the "they show up in story mode" thing
That comment
I'm looking at it this way. They budget the base game out. They make the base game. They have some time between finishing the game and release to add some more stuff in before release, but to add that content, they have to go over budget. They make up that extra money they spent through DLC.

I'm not saying arksys DID do this, and it absolutely could be a cash grab

I'm just saying that some developers actually do this with completely legitimate reasons, and none of us work at arksys to know that it was a cash grab.
No, I don't play fighting games
$50 is 125% of $40
So they chopped 25% of the price off by making the extra characters DLC instead
how much is a standard release?
And the reason is allowing the base game to be sold at a more accessible price point
Maybe it's money grabbing, sure, but there is a legitimate reason to do it
Doesn't mean they don't still need new code, some new art, updated voice lines, etc
but if they take the DLC out and sell them separately, they can charge less for the base game
If they wanna cover those expenses with DLC attached within 5 sales, they'd need to sell it at $40 a game
The DLCs take extra time and money to create, so they spend, say, $200 on making the game including DLCs
Finishing DLC and not adding them to the base game makes sense to me.
Sell the story as DLC
Hell, you'd sell MORE DLC
People still gonna buy DLC
BBTAG has 50% of the characters cut? Cool, now cut 50% of the price.
It's a fighting game, you're there to fight not to have tea
Fighting games, imo, should be like... $20 for the base game, and then make up all of the lost money on DLCs. Cut the story, who the fuck wants story?
Well that's good
but like... get more people to whine
whining about it is a good way to get attention
not saying dont whine about it
Anyway, that's just my take. A few people with clout needs to start caring about the business model and if you're not a person with clout, get the attention of someone who is.
Maybe some big names in the FGC need to start caring about the business model.
So why not go back to that until arksys and capcom and whoever else get their shit together?
brawl got completely ignored in favor of melee. Who was putting the money out then?
The money came from elsewhere
Didn't stop them before capcom decided street fighter was finally worth continuing
And the companies would lose, because if no one is buying the games - and staying competitive means staying on top of the game *tournaments* play, not the games arksys wants them to play - then they make no money.
What is stopping some big tournaments with big name casters from simply saying "No, this isn't working for us anymore"
There was a time when the FGC was filled with shit that wouldn't fly on public streams. Then Capcom started doing shit again, and now that everyone is tuning into the new SF game - people that previously were not part of the FGC - a few big name streamers said "we need a better face for our community". And so, the people doing the "DEEZNUTS" shit or slinging slurs as part of trashtalk, were kindly asked to sit the fuck down or get the fuck out. And the FGC improved because of it! The problematic people stopped showing up, streams got popular, and now it's a HUGE genre.
why
so
we could do maid rpg here
I'm interested, even if it's not a symphogear tabletop
oh, right, I was gonna do that
Skullgirls was pretty popular iirc
OJ does it
I'd love to see capcom or someone try out a real DLC model. Sell the base game with like 8 characters in it for $10. Then just keep making characters and adding them as DLC.
Oh, here, I found the twitter thread. https://twitter.com/HoldenShearer/status/980404490938482688
It's the FGC
And if any gaming community can change how shit works
FGC's done it before, even if they weren't acting against a company. OWL is currently trying to do the same for esports. Taking on a company in that fashion is a bit different, but the same tactics can be applied, you just need someone with enough clout to lead the charge and get people listening to them.
dess_roll 1d20
but also
yeah
nice
dess_roll
but also...
And yeah roll20 is good
Finding her was a massive pain. I had to figure out which server she was on, figure out where she was, contact her guild because she was afk in the scion hideout, and at the end of it she just screamed at me and the entire D&D group fell apart.
In practice I ended up tracking down one of the players in FFXIV to make sure she hadn't killed herself due to D&D arguments
Coulda worked
So, in theory
We were all on a kinky offshoot from a FFXIV discord
No one even fucked me I was sad
I tried to do sex D&D a while ago and it ended in disaster due to some less than stable players
Plus Maid is a game where it's like "Oh, you can technically have combat but fuck it if you don't wanna"
I tried to get a game of Maid going a long while back when Steam was the cool platform to use to talk about video games
...except saki has to add them to the bot <@!102691114762371072>
I'll add a D&D role (that can be used for all tabletops) so that people can organize stuff
we could also do symphomaid rpg
i
i may have ordered a gigantic brownie during that whole weed thing that was going on and the sugar may be starting to hit me
im around!
and if i actually want her to be horny in the first place
ill have to think of my character
six with the dnd role, including saki
Captain Alice, leader of the /r/Symphogear
100%
yes
captain sounds cooler
I'm changing my title from boss to captain
Captain powers
writing as we speak
i am totally challenging you on this
no promises that i wont be a moth tho
probably won't actually lift a character from another game
But anyway, yeah. I'll restrict the horniness if people are uncomfortable.
X card?

I'm going to try to fuck everything
Wait am I allowed to try to fuck everything?
I'm Grace
Grace
wait no
I don't care what the setting is
I am literally copying Elizabeth and playing as a moth girl
yeah if we did it on discord we'd do it with a dnd channel and dms for private information
roll20 gives us a table but not much else since kiri can handle the rolls
would we need roll20 though?
text should be fine (and honestly if we have private information we'll have to use it at some points)
but it's not mandatory
okay i guess we're using voice
i mean we CAN use voice chat. I hadn't thought of it until just now.
well, not necessarily dnd. tabletops.
would you wanna join?
we're organizing online dnd sessions
so what game format should we go with
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
no i was just asking latooni if they're still here
Me, saki, dragon, other dragon, latooni are you still there?
We have 4 people present, don't we?
Anyway, steering the discussion back on track
i should actually sit down and write for once
shitdiscording
i should make shitposts
this is what happens when im not playing games
not without floaty wings at least, there's a reason one of the elfnein emotes is elfneindrowning <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
the mod chat is leaking
okay Lyssa is the first mate
...no
...girlfriend?
Lyssa is the other Custodian
im restricting myself until im off my shit
i should dilate and also calm the fuck down
is lyssa doing the chaining
...ive been playing this game too much haven't i
Maid can also be captain and crew
it's tabletops now
will it mess up kiri if i do that?
also should I rename the role to tabletop?
do you want the D&D role so you can be pinged for tabletop stuff?
paranoia is probably not easy to pick up
<@297542051057238017> easiest is highly subjective when it comes to tabletops
paranoia might be fun to play at some point too
my vote is to maid because it's the only one i actually know
<@297542051057238017> there's a dnd role available now, btw
i voted
it was centered around magic and super creative and could have just as easily be centered around phonic gain
cant find the homebrew i was looking for
lemme dig up that pdf
someone showed me a homebrew for some magical system called Aelaria once
are we going with maid?
tabletops
goodnight!
you can always homebrew combat rules over it though
yeah, maid's combat is super optional and super simple
so
and i was trying to do roleplay
i was an either/dont care
yes i tried to revote
i cant recast
2
yes
what's the resolution?
magical burst is madoka inspired iirc
i see no shame
wait did the gauntlet have anything to do with gjallarhorn
will the gauntlet part fly, saki?
i said monk not moth
a monk type character who's incredibly disciplined but not social at all, taken in by SONG after her family is massacred by noise and given further training by genjuro, wielding the gauntlet since she has no latent ability to wield a gear herself and SONG wants to find more methods to defeat the noise without using linker
not literally doomfist but you get the idea
doomfist, wielding that gauntlet they gave genjuro in xdu
do i *require* a gear
is xdu canon in the game's universe?
***moth gear***
*moth gear*
why do i have a picture of dirt
i have a picture of dirt
the perfect weakness
but what if i choose to love someone who's not real
...that ive moved on from completely
oh i have some old game notes here
i have so much random junk here
i found this though, and i have no clue what it is
i think the pdf that guy sent me is gone
It was stock standard D&D, but with sex
Trillian Goo D&D

they're not particularly interesting
oh god i found old character sheets from the kink dnd group
sakiverse
~~fineverse~~
but lemme just uh
apparently it was a prototype gear from the fineverse that runs on willpower
I want more information on genjuro's xdu gauntlet but everything is in japanese
<@99695384296701952> Chris has her deflector
"You're going to punch the noise"
"Hibiki does it"
"Hibiki has a gear!"
nice
still makes the list longer...
newcomers seeing us play would be good
i dont wanna hide activity like that
but if we use roll20 might not be needed
weve been going for some time
should we make a d&d channel now btw?
backstory, gear, etc
saki, can you write up a blank character sheet to fill out with important information?
_goes to research midas_
it's literally midas's hand
MIDAS
infinity war doesnt count because it's a copout
are there any legendary gauntlets or whatnot
i say yes
will it run on a relic though...
but i shall keep that in mind
...we will discuss the dos and donts at a later stage
It runs on willpower so it's difficult to use and very draining to the user
So the gauntlet I use will be a prototype weapon developed to allow humans that can't control gears to fight noise without using linker
yes
...
gonna make a tabletop channel now
how many pluses do i get for being an ordinary human
so my protogear uses a piece of midas himself
also, as an extension of the story of midas, after cursing his power he accidentally touched himself, turning to gold
does my protogear qualify me as a gear user
where are the rules?
ok so, if my character backstory is "taken in by genjuro after a noise attack" how well do i know tsubasa
but okay
I'd have to install it
im still here
https://hsreplay.net/decks/?hearthstone_account=1-97391088#sortBy=winrate the website that collects all the hdt stats
EU is fine. I wanna get hsreplay premium for better looks at stats and was wondering if anyone would be interested in splitting the cost and just using a shared account for it
I'm pretty sure at least two of you do
How many people here play hearthstone again?
<@431656503490117632>
Good news! You're not allowed to speak in the music voice channel. You can't even turn your mic on.
Also didn't Humanz come out like last year?
We also have a music bot that can play music in a voice channel on command
A few weeks at least
So they scrapped that concept midway, but still had a bunch of baby concepts drawn, so they reworked those into the breeding system that the games have today
Of course, that would have meant that every single Pokemon would need a baby form and, turns out, that wasn't too practical.
The original intent was that every Pokemon would have had baby forms, and breeding a Pokemon would have just given you a smaller baby version of that Pokemon.
If I'm right, the eggs were a quick fix to an older breeding mechanism in Pokemon games
At some point a few months ago I was like "why the fuck is the daycare man always confused about the eggs" and I had a god damn epiphany
So, a couple of early betas and demos for Gold and Silver were leaked a couple days ago, and there are SO MANY BABIES
OKAY

I TRIED TALKING ABOUT THIS ON THURSDAY

UNFORTUNATELY, I WAS HIGH
im starting to feel the weed so maybe mahjong isnt the best idea
id need to figure out how it works entirely
you need a 4th?
...possibly
hang on wait, is the demo in english? I know the beta isnt
Girafarig is a 2 stage Pokemon in the demo
that's girafarig's pre-evo
im gun
FOUR HUNDRED BABIES
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRuNxHqwazs&t=55s
gonna make a pokemon clone where the breeding system is just my theory on what the breeding system used to be
give me all the babies
I also want more babies
I want so many of the demo pokemon
HAVE YOU SEEN DEMO PICHU? OH MY GOD IT'S JUST A MOUSE BALL.
Bring back demo Pichu
Anyway thanks for coming to my TED talk
I don't know where I'm going with this, I just felt compelled to talk about it since I had tried doing so when I was high on Thursday, but alas, I was a bit out of it.
And Mime Jr came out later as well
In the end, Tangela's baby was never implemented, but Tangrowth WAS implemented later on, and that had a concept in the demos as well.
The only 2 baby concepts in the demo that weren't released that would have turned 1 stage Pokemon into 2 stage Pokemon were Tangela's baby and Mr Mime's baby. The rest turned 2 stagers into 3 stage, which, why would we need this?
So I'm guessing that the final version of Gold and Silver we got left in the baby concepts for a handful of the more popular Pokemon in the series, as well as a handful of babies to turn 1 stage Pokemon into 2 stage Pokemon.
The leaks have a SHITLOAD of babies. Grimer babies, Goldeen babies, BABIES EVERYWHERE
Lemme get my pack tho
Alright. My bnet is Yuri Girl#11101
randomonium <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>

wait when's E3?
done, and also not a meme
i already made kaleidosaur
Someone who plays hearthstone, gimme an idea for a meme deck
serverwide moemon battles...
vba allows for link trading in pokemon games, right?
play dead is a good card, but there are no decent decks where it can actually see play
play dead is better because you usally don't have multiple drs you wanna trigger
play dead is 1 mana triggers one
triggers all
feign death is 2 mana
and dont like crafting wild cards
also i dont have feign death
play dead is better
Baku is a safe craft but spell hunter and quest warrior ladder just fine
but that's if i wanna run odd plaadin
i might craft baku later on
im making incredibly bad decks for funsies
i think saki is making jokes
this is going to be so bad
faceless manipulator
what else does wild otk hunter NEED
okay, I've got 2x automaton, 2x cube, 2x stitched tracker, 1x thaurissan
i think otk hunter needs to be wild for thaurissan ticks
...i will build this
clockwork automaton
not a meme, already have like 3 versions of it built
also...
odd mage > not crafting baku for memes
thief rogue > not crafting tess at all
quest druid > not a meme previously but it got murdered by the most recent patch so maybe
priest otk > not a meme and i already have one built
hunter otk > how????????
yeah its 5
odd i think
I have a thing for women kicking my ass
https://twitter.com/EA/status/1005516924887826432
i should watch shinais
no
wait
Having something to watch while I dilate would be nice at least
perfect material to make fun of
Oh, EA's conference is today
It's literally just "yeah it's coming"
What? No, I watched the TES 6 trailer. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoHqOmh--fo
Ok I just watched the TES 6 video and other than "not elsweyr or the black marsh" I haven't a clue where it is considering the entire video was shot in like 3 dungeons fighting skeletons.
what's the link for the stream so i can watch once im done with the current thing(s) I'm doing
Everyone wanted Elsweyr though.
Either High Rock or Hammerfell since they already did Morrowind.
>Mountains

CURVED. SWORDS.
I II II L
at any given point I will not know which fallout game i am playing
there's a reason i like tes and it's because they don't use numbers, they just use letters that stand for numbers
you watched me play moemon
i dont know numbers
listen
oh
im not sure if norded is supposed to mean something or not
~it's all garbage~
oh it's still there <@284390402210136064>
I accidentally turned my internet off mid pack opening so i have no idea what was in my golden pack
oh that's today isnt it
It's easily the most expensive thing in my apartment
My mom has a piano with ivory keys. The thing is worth a couple thousand dollars.
Ivory is illegal so they're probably pretty old and expensive if they are
and there's only one at a time
2 health. 1 damage.
yes. 1 damage.
the second spawns after you kill the first
<@284390402210136064> what kills the second imp?
possessed villager works especially well
any 1 health minion can take the place of the second defile
Should work
Turn 5: Grim Patron
Turn 6: Defile x2
You can do it turn 6 with EVERYONE, GET IN HERE and defile
not impressive unless you pull it off turn 2
oh, this
what the fuck is this boss
Well not today in any case. I need to shower, write, and talk to a suicidal friend
I would play if I had a 4 or 5 stack, but if there's more than 1 rando on the team it aint worth it
I used to

It was mostly around the time JonTron said "Wealthy blacks commit more crimes than poor whites. That's a fact, look it up."
It looked cute tho
I will forever remember A Hat In Time as "That game made by a developer who took other people's TF2 mods and claimed they were his and then decided to take a bold stance against Yooka Laylee not wanting to be associated with someone who had made rather racist remarks"
it's literally just a shot at getting addicts back in
you can't do anything meaningful in 72 hours
free weekends seem hilariously misguided for mmos to begin with though
if you've had an active sub before, yes
huh. WoW is free for this one weekend where I'm away anyway
then it works
that's like a turn 3 or 4 thing iirc
on turn 2?
Where do you get the second imp
you'd play defile on a single 1 health imp, it'd spawn a 2 health imp, and the 2 health imp would promptly not die from the single defile damage
they respawn when they die, not when they take damage
no
^
You're not, but "you're dumb" doesn't really add anything to the discussion.
Let's not get into personal attacks, and if we're gonna get heated about this let's move it to <#336297840529899522>
"Illegal immigrant" is code for "Mexicans and Muslim refugees"
oh, yeah, that's kinda racist
What was the immigrant quote?
That's a direct quote
tits
Yeah, sure, I *totally* wanna go through a bunch of side quest dungeons just to advance the main plot
Disgaea's item world remains the worst instance of this I've ever encountered
Yeah
I think this is the first SGDQ I've missed since I've learned about GDQ in the first place.
(click through for poll)
https://twitter.com/YuriMGirl/status/1012949527412736000 someone please help me make bad decisions
I know where I could get one

I never play it and I don't even have the one piece swimsuit I need to truly unlock its potential.
Electric Wind Instrument
pact is sealed
gonna sell my EWI and buy a PS4
Okay good. I never saw anyone talk about it despite everyone being really hyped up the second they saw it at E3
And I can finally play Horizon Zero Dawn or did that turn out to be garbage
with 2 day shipping
$330
that's like
So that I can have more hell
okay, so a PS4, 1.5+2.5, and then KH3 whenever I claw my way out of the hell that is Kingdom Hearts's story
I can just buy the 3DS game, fuck 2.8
What's on 2.8 again?
I'll get a normal PS4 and then the full series should be like $60 without KH3
hahaha not shelling out an extra $100 for that
The graphics with the pro look really pretty
I might just go and do that then.
I love bad plot
I want to play it explicitly for the terrible plot
I might not actually get the special PS4 though, depends on price. If it's cheaper to get the games + PS4 individually I can sacrifice the pimped out KH PS4
I could get 1.5 and 2.5 separately and play them now, but why bother when it'd probably be cheaper to get them lumped together and I'd still need a PS4 for KH3
And apparently HD 1.5 + 2.5 Remix.
I'll need a PS4 for 3 anyway.
I'm gonna get the KH3 PS4 Pro despite not wanting any other PS4 games and having never played a KH game other than like 30 minutes of KH1 and the original Chain of Memories.
pros: soleil
cons: no astolfo
i tried starting FGO, the battle system seemed like garbage to me, so now I'm playing FEH
If CBT is so bad why are they making a CBT2
Don't explain
I dunno maybe you should try CBT
Also I got rid of those I have no pain
But they're fine tuning GMS2 to global audiences because CMS2 and KMS2 are both kinda floundering
It is
And any potential future CBTs
Invites are for CBT2
You won't need an invite on release
<@!102691114762371072> MS2 was some of the funnest shit I ever played for exactly a week
please
spreading the cause is not being busted
yes
We can even have a multi part piece that everyone plays as an ensemble
Also if you can make a Symphogear midi we can totally play Symphogear music in game
I don't know what the size limit of a house is but the answer is fairly large
If you want customizable tiles you have to pay real money, but past that you can make your entire house one giant symphogear mural
How much money you willing to spend
It's basically a glorified chat room with an optional minigame that involves combat
Yeah MS2 is real good for social stuff.
then Big Bang happened and now it's a single player game
CPQ was the height of MS1
but then they released CPQ
even then it was meh
it wasn't good until LPQ existed
nothing to do
MS1 on release had like
But then they nuked the social features
MS1 used to be fun
with a fouders pack
You can get the beta hat in MS2
zero social features
No MS1 sucks
For CBT1 I made friends by just going to The Yuri House and waiting
Sitting around in someone's house plastered with yuri and playing music is good
It's like Mabinogi and Maplestory had a baby
fun
But the social features of it are just
It's a pretty generic MMO in terms of combat although it retains the "just spam shit" aspect of MS1
it has maplestory references
it's not maplestory at all
I could easily also have a dps character
It was called SONG
I actually found a Symphogear guild during CBT1
We can make a Symphogear guild
Me, <@99695384296701952>, <@456226577798135808>, <@!102691114762371072>, anyone else???
how many people here would play MS2?
so anyway
okay i told saki
come back sakiiiiiiii
awww
if you know don't say it
no one explain
half of us are named alice
that's the secret
thank you for the Good Trans Content
it's really been that long
holy shit i cant believe there are people who don't know about maplestory
a notable improvement over kancolle then
because it looks a lot like kancolle but with guns and on a phone instead
is this just kancolle but with guns and on a phone instead
I've had an invite for months since I got mine back during CBT1
I have an invite
`12 days until I fuck off to play Maplestory 2`
ｕｍｕ
WHY ARE THERE SO MANY OF THEM
WHY
MUSTY ASS CHARACTER DESIGN THAT THEY KEEP REUSING
i wanted Nitocris not this musty ass character design from over a decade ago
i guess ill just do quests since i can actually read them
But the gameplay menus in particular are kind of confusing
Most things seem to be carbon copies from kancolle
does position affect anything other than buffs?
i thought they were valid movement options
oh, the blue squares are buffed spaces?
how does formation affect things in gfl
some nodes were guaranteed night battles but most nodes they just had a random chance of having a night battle following the normal battle
usually
yes
unless you expected a night battle
But Yukikaze was pretty garbo
I had Yukikaze
Like
The rarest ones were not always the best ones
KC had niche uses for a lot of units
but less is good
i didnt really mind the grind
~~Kancolle didn't have Permadeath unless you were an idiot~~
fun
you know
Aside from being
what about GFL is DIFFERENT from Kancolle?
so
also i just clicked ID Card and that number was bottom right
it looked like kancolle so i wanted to try it out
that it?
UID:265151
i missed that part
what do heliports do
is gfl literally just kancolle with gameplay
is there a tutorial i risk skipping by hitting the skip button
im gfl now
i think i know why KC has a better feel
oh
is that what logistic missions are
the not sortie thing from kancolle?
Logistic missions are the same as uh
Here, if there's a Russian gun, they gotta make sure you know she's Russian
So they had more freedom in design
3 german ships
and like
also KC when I played it only had Japanese ships
that might be it
all the mobage i like have terrible gameplay
~~just like XDU~~
But KC is a mediocre time waster at best
I dunno what it is but I feel like the aesthetic of KC was more appealing
i got a tokarev
did i get lucky
3:10:00
ill spam that for now then
alright
like literally, the gun i want, it doesn't tell me which one that is
this gives me numbers but it doesnt tell me what i want
what's the secret combination of resources to build the ultimate beginner gun
i think salvage was the term for kancolle
i mean, the way it worked in kancolle was, you get a dupe, you "retire" it, and then you slap the resulting parts on your other girls
not retreat
retire
oh wait
retire is just a "i'm bored and i'll do this later" button, right?
my main question is just whether i want to keep my dupes around or just feed them to my units
but the "feed dupes to make the original stronger" system is in basically every mobage
every game names it differently
I'm just using it generally dragon
"take a copy of this thing and feed it to the thing so the thing becomes more powerful"
it's all the same mechanic
SIF requires dupes for idolization
I know, and neither is limit breaking. I'm using the term in a general sense.
It seems like a common system
XDU requires dupes for limit breaks, FGO requires dupes for NPs
do i need use copies to ascend like every other gacha game or are dupe units just food
WHY DO I KEEP GETTING M1895
are skills limited by anything but a cooldown?
oooh i can use multiple teams at once
no
I suppose when I don't need to drain other's luck I can act as a good luck charm...
alright. do my units level up on logistics missions? or did these guns get to level 2 some other way
like are there any that say "you need an SMG"
does echelon composition matter for logistics?
So like, level 50 Kaga + 4 level 1 destroyers
In Kancolle, as long as your leader met the requirement, you were good to go
does logistics ever require a higher level gun?
but i can if it's a different echelon, as long as i have 2 or more of that gun
can i stick multiple of the same gun on one team...
So 8 of a gun (including the linked one) before it's at max power
ok, so I can link 4 times per gun. which means the 6th of a gun i get is always fodder
and you can only do that once per gun?
Dummy Link is the "you have 7 of this gun, throw some away to make one stronger" thing, right?
is there a way for me to view a list of my guns and equipment?
GFL seems to have the same flaw as KC where early on you're kinda fucked over by repair times if you wanna play a lot
oh theres an autoskill button
gfl is kinda confusing at first...
is the event just login bonuses at the moment?
confusing....
why did sten disappear from echelon 1 randomly
or apparently you can???
so that's the same as kancolle
ok so you can't stick an identical but different gun in a different echelon
less menu space was devoted to your secretary
it made navigating the game even without knowing Japanese super easy and intuitive
KC had extremely simple menus
less clutter
I wish GFL gave the girls actual names as well
...is AK-47 not good
M9 <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I might do AL and GFL because honestly FGO is underwhelming
I might play AL
or is that something else
is AL Chinese Kancolle
Sent!
I'll add you once I'm done with this mission!
maybe??? i can only use it once in a while though cant i?
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
no i meant for the event
i need more friends so i can get more likes
yeah
I should have plucked some unnecessary members off of the echelons I sent out so I could have created an echelon 4 where I actually play the game
that... shouldn't be TOO bad
When's reset? I'm trying to get the logistics daily done on time.
oh level 12
What is a combat simulation and how do I produce equipment
how exactly does the game determine which medals i get
is this a good result
I got OTs-12
im noooot
sgsgergerg saki no
unless i worked for it or if the money would otherwise go to cops
its against my code of honor to accept money
but gunsssssssssss
no that's not allowed
i hardly have money for food
no
wheres my card
$100
12960 gems
GFL is set up pretty much exactly like Kancolle but with more reason to spend money on it
yeah
i will have every slot i ever wnat
for $100
$26
that's uhhhhh
2880 gems to unlock all my echelons
480 gems per slot... 6 bonus slots...
I feel like I need a second GFL account, to waste time while waiting for the first GFL account to finish repairing stuff
did we miss her a few weeks ago
is she still in boston
<@285555416056856576> IRIS IS 100% PLAYING THIS GAME I NEED HER FRIEND ID FUCK
I JUST REALIZED
HOLY SHIT
I
XDU is easy. All you need is Miku.
FGO is hard because there are lots of cute girls and no real reason to like one over another!
im here for cute girls
you assume I'm reading the story
is guncolle chinese too?
M<random string of numbers> alright there we have it, a gun name
OTs-12 is a bad example, but I couldn't think of a good example, because I can't remember the names of any of the good examples
I don't remember who the fuck I-9 is
I actually had the same exact problem with subs in Kancolle
Gun names are... I don't even know how guns get named
Well, yeah, but the point is that boat names are actual names
OTs-12 is less easy to remember
Like it was easy to keep track of who's who with Kancolle because Kaga, Kongou, etc are all pronounceable names
We'll make a GFL role if enough people want one
Maybe that'll change if XDU stops being a bad game
@GFL players
I have unlocked equipment production. What equipment do I *want*
where did i get these tokens
my luck is impeccable no matter which game i play
i did 400 400 400 30
no
Lee-Enfield, MG34, or DP28
yeah
I have what I can only hope is a Lee-Enfield being made
except hearthstone
ever
i dont spend money on mobage
yes
bayonetta qtes arent THAT bad
1600 strength
or is that just commander exp
that'll give me a lot of exp right
how leveled should my team be before I send it into the exp sim
you have like 10 echelons
way less
not nearly as much
but autobattle doesnt give as much exp
I wanna just press a "level guns" button and have my team be unavailable for 2 hours and come back to a properly leveled team
click here click there click this after that
it's the repetitiveness
im already using planning mode
it's actually worse
grinding in kancolle is also bad for the record
better than XDU
god DAMN grinding in GFL is torture
Also how do i actually enhance equipment for the daily
hooray!
1) Should we have a GFL role, considering that unlike most mobage, this game rewards you for having more than just that one whale friend

2) Is Lee-Enfield actually good or did I get a crap 5*
...how often can i spin these gachas without paying
Does AL have the same resources and building mechanic that kancolle and guncolle do?
is chinese kancolle like guncolle or is it entirely different
*stares at timers* now this is a mobage
oh no shes cute
IM BUILDING A MICRO UZI
OH NO
no one told me this
wait i cant just summon support echelons forever
what is this
wait did kancolle get an english version
~~they're bathing in the chris piss~~
~~it's piss~~
why are the chinese knockoffs of kancolle better than actual kancolle
whats the sigma on https://en.gfwiki.com/wiki/T-Doll_Production mean in the production lists? Does it mean one resource has to be over/under that number, or does it mean all resources combined have to?
What's a good team comp for night battles? My usual comps are "can't see shit captain" and 2RF 3HG is... underwhelming with how little I can link those dolls
god
im trying to produce an ots-12 and keep getting not ots-12
I am practicing self restraint and saving them for guns that require them
they're being sucked away
oh no my cores
She's not on the production list
Can you only get 1 M4A1?
this one is my favorite. this is my favorite HG.

I GOT TWO YEEHAWS
<@284390402210136064> what is boomsday
I HAVE DISCOVERED VOICES IN GFL
I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT SHARING ON SOCIAL MEDIA GIVES YOU 30 GEMS
Skorpion has an eyepatch because it's cute
Tenryuu has an eyepatch but is also just general badass and the eyepatch contributes to that
Also, re:Tenryuu.
I'm addicted to timers
I'm loving it. It's Kancolle but better, and I loved Kancolle
Azur Lane? Or some gun named AL
IDW has some of the best personality in the game tbh
None of the girls in guncolle greet me with a PAN PAKA PAN
There's also personalities. There aren't any weird vocal quirks or strange ways of speaking.
I think I've nailed why I prefer Kancolle in some ways. In Guncolle, every girl is basically "cute girl with gun". There are variations in tactical gear or whatever, but all of the girls are some form of cute. Meanwhile in Kancolle, you have boats like Tenryuu who is not cute. She's badass and will tear you apart. Kancolle designs are more varied.
if amazon coins dip to $80 for 100 im preordering
same
gfl
but
i want cards
I want mecha jaraxxus
M4A1 is a strong contender though
i dont know who's my favorite
I should cosplay a GFL girl...
apparently GFL had a booth at AX
<@431656503490117632>
I should get a lock...
important distinction
are they [fucking] [collars] or [fucking collars]
And the good ones aren't the ones handed to you at the start, which makes for a bad first impression. Like, if you pick up Kancolle, within 15 minutes you'll have Tenryuu telling you to eat a dick.
not good
Yeah but so many of them are just
She's actually one of the good ones
Last one: how about giant anime tiddy freedom dispenser
She's actually not too bad, aside from the word darling
SO AMERICAN THAT HER EYES ARE RED WHITE AND BLUE
How about this GOD DAMN ALL AMERICAN CAT
Fucking not even
Ok here's a test. R, who has never played this game, what kind of thing do you expect a girl dressed and posed like this to say?
Kancolle at least has boats that don't take shit from anyone - including you. Hell, most boats are energetic and vibrant, where here all the guns are delicate flowers. Also, no, seriously, why can I do this.
There's this whole air of subservience with the game that makes me vaguely uncomfortable. I don't want the girl in full tactical gear to act all wishy washy needing the approval of her commander to get anything done, I want her to be badass and take initiative. Also why can I set damaged cgs as my home screen.
he has special animations
mecha jaraxxus is totally not worth $80 but no regrets
and potential extra legendaries
plus probably a free legendary for launch
2 golden legendaries and a guaranteed 4 legendaries after that

too late to regret it
I CAN PREORDER BOTH PACKS
WAIT
Also, I'd grab coins now. This is the first they've dipped below $80 in a while. Unless they've stated coins will be going even lower.
That makes 79 coins $62.41
$0.79 exactly
lets see, each coin is worth... a little less than $0.80
So roughly $62 I think
79 coins to preorder, $79 for 100 coins
the packs are pre-order
also me
https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-500-Coins/dp/B0096E8EPY?th=1 GUESS WHO'S PREORDERING MECHA-JARAXXUS
it's mostly mobage but sometimes we discuss actual games
but better
It feels like playing Spiteful Druid at its peak
boomsday got me playing again. Heal zoo is making me excited though.
*10 one drops*
it's so dumb
im freaking out about heal zoo in hearthstone right now
so many people wanted him back tho
i hated james and i was glad he was gone
vintage dota memes
yeah
I unironically like the colt revolver girl but only because she has a cowboy hat
EYE DEE DOUBLE YOU DA NYA
boob lolis are also present, it's terrible
M16A1 is basically a high school delinquent trope and it's so bad
and not-boob not-loli guns
there are plenty of boob guns
in any case, GFL is easier to understand than GF and Guncolle takes too long to type
it doesn't? i thought all fate stuff did
and we dont have fe:h
we don't call fgo f/go
neither is gfl
hearthstone technically isn't gacha
~~and because i love timers~~
i play gfl for tactical strategy based gaming
oh
YuriGirl#11101
no, suffer in hell with me
but then why play
no astolfos
i rolled 90 quartz
i wasnt
why would i play fgo if i dont have astolfo
i quit fgo because i didnt get an astolfo in my first 3 rolls
Akagi taught me my lesson years ago
RF, AR, SMG, and HG only
i dont use mgs
so the extra 4 isn't really doing anything
ump45 NEEDS 400 ammo
5-2, 3-3, 4-1, 0-1
im currently doing all of them, but my ammo is still dropping
trying to get UMP45
404/404/98/233
or shotguns
i havent touched mgs at all
im not
god damn where did my ammo go
fgo alexander the great is cute
thats not how you steal someone's heart
rude
momvinci is better though
this is also a cute da vinci
now its just that series with cute people
all of my interest in fate died when i couldnt get my astolfos
i dont play anyway
are there two da vincis
da vinci is a good and quality mom
4-4E
I have all the chapters unlocked so far
i went and unlocked it for better logistics
yeah
The cube thingy
Should I be able to do the event with that team at that level?
when i can just gold medal everything
i dont wanna spend money
but
i could just get 3360 gems from the money i have left in my paypal address
im grinding out gems so i can get another echelon slot
I can't run 0-1 nonstop because i need echelon 2 to stand around and look cool for grinding so maybe that's it?

does fielding a rifle really eat that much ammo?
but i should be getting around 800/hour
800/2 hours is 400/1 hour
also wait
i can cut it down so im only producing one gun at a time
800 ammo every 2 hours
but that's only like
yes
*but they're so bad*
Because when everyone is emulating "that one asshole no one likes" then everyone is an asshole who no one likes.
Because as is, a lot of players do that, and it makes games not very fun
If a character in a game is going to be "that one asshole no one likes" then that's fine, but... I'd rather the players not emulate "that one asshole no one likes"
3-6 did not want to be golded
I tried to gold 3-6
I think I'm gonna start eating repair tickets now. 5+ hour repair times hurt.
"But I need them to repair mid-mission" is my excuse
*has 117 express repairs*

*has guns being repaired for 5+ hours*

nah i'll wait
Not tax evasion, tax avoidance
no tax
that's the real secret
And you don't have to pay tax on coin purchases if you set the billing address to some place in California.
If 100 coins is 1 pound (it's $1 in America), then 10,000 coins should be 79 pounds.
10,000 coins is 21% off right now
That's only $0.79 a pack
For effectively $102.70 I got 130 packs, 2 legendaries of my choice, and some cosmetics
AND mecha jaraxxus
twoooooo golden legendaries
suffer with me
no
$130 before a 21% discount
i preordered the expansion twice
now theres just a bunch of cosmetics i COULD have gotten
terrible
~~monthly non-cycling exclusives are terrible game design~~
probably not anywhere near where I would want her to be
the 23 I have now will make her 34, dunno where the 15 I'm making will get her to after that
more than 30, at least
i know i saw numbers somewhere
ive got 38 combat reports which should be...
No time to grind UMP45 though
I should probably be fine
my echelons are ~60 and ~45
YES I GOT UMP45
wait i should beat 6-6 shouldnt i
i'll get silver and then grind more i guess
it's gone
oh no my S rank
3-4e is kicking my ass
my completionism...
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
are there any guns/outfits I can expect to never have available to me that have already been released?
are those on cycle/added to gacha?
what about outfits?
also im just wondering if i missed any exclusive stuff
i thought cube was in 2 weeks
or is this the first one?
have there been any events like the current one on en servers before?
i have 9 already i must bring the sisters together
BUT I ROLLED ONE
hopefully ump45
I ROLLED A UMP
hAHA
oh hey i can get it cheaper if i buy it 6 months at a time
fuck it im buying hsreplay
...i might just bite it and subscribe
yeah the subscription bit is what makes me hesitant too
$5 a month
No. It's a subscription.
well, hsreplay's tracker is hdt
hsreplay
mostly just want a solid grasp on "what am I going to face when I hit the play button"
im not too interested in them though
there are some personal stats features
We could also just link premium to one of our accounts and have one person be like "hey can you check out this data for me"
Hell, we could make a dummy bnet account to link it to
We can totally share it. It would have to be attached to one of our accounts, but we can just share info
if they accept paypal im doing it
gnhgnghnghgng i have money in paypaaaaaaal
latooni make me not buy hsreplay premium
again
real tempted to buy hsreplay premium
"once" are you rank 20
Odd Hunter will always be viable in some way
Even Rogue isn't going anywhere
Yeah, not so sure about current decks, but Genn and Baku are gonna be useful no matter what. It's just a question of how useful.
Genn and Baku are too strong to not be at least tier 2 in some form
Genn is sticking around, but Evenlock might disappear
On less gun related gaming, *I really wanna craft Baku but we're less than a month from Boomsday*
Atago, Kaga, Akagi, and Tenryuu are all Good Boats
I actually like Kancolle designs more
Hourly dialogue was nice too
I'm still missing how colorful Kancolle was though
GFL is basically "Kancolle, if Kancolle were a better game"
AND the gameplay is adaptable. Got a day where I don't really wanna do much? Put everything on a timer.
And the gameplay is fun so I don't mind grinding out that time
Lots of time, but easily doable time.
But this one just asks for time
Other mobage would demand money to do that
Honestly my end goal is to just max level every single doll, because the game lets me
note: I grew up with Maplestory. Grinding for things is fun to me.
As long as there isn't a sudden "no you can't get this doll anymore" it doesn't really feel bad to grind for them to me
Yeah but that's just things to do.
Like I'm a little over a week in
I just started playing and I'm already at 51% completion
And I can just focus on being a completionist for the guns themselves instead.
There IS a gacha but it's mostly cosmetic
That's part of why I like GFL. It's not structured like a gacha game.
"No, it was a reward for donating to charity/going to an event" feels less shit
Basically if the answer to "Can I get this?" is "No, you missed the boat" it just feels like shit
Cycling old freebies back in as paid extras is okay. FFXIV does that.
Pink Mercy - Great idea
Blizzcon skins - Awesome
"Players used to be able to get this for free but not anymore" - Fuck you
although pre-orders pushes it
limited exclusives for things like pre-orders, purchases, or going to specific events is fine
but i cant
gonna build an odd hunter deck once im home later
maybe not crafting baku
zoolock, even shaman, malygos druid, evenlock, odd rogue
oh limiting it to america makes it even more accurate
top 5 are zoolock, malygos druid, zoolock, zoolock, evenlock
fuck it, looks like im making odd hunter
oh wait no, the numbers do change if you only look at past 3 days info
they change DRASTICALLY for legend only though
...the numbers do not change much between legend-5 and legend-25
WORTHWHILE PURCHASE
its k i just used my card
...apparently I can't get it using paypal balance
yes
we have *double bloodlust on turn 8*
we dont need evolve
`thrall shall be a useful card`
the day ive been waiting for
is the revival of token shaman
this
card
well
NEW CARDS
UI remains a broken card
okay malygos druid is good
to hold all the fun
anyway time to craft malygos i guess
oh that's good
oh
it used to be 100% chance, right?
I'm crafting Malygos because I have a shitton of dust, a shitton of gold, 130 boomsday packs, and I'm pretty far from my next classic legendary anyway
tinkmaster would have been a solid tech if taunt druid ever saw dominance
I'd take "summon a 2/2 and ruin your opponent's day for 3 mana" over tinkmaster any time
did it used to be targeted or what
Tinkmaster is strictly okay
And The Black Knight is a tech but it's a shitty tech
Captain Greenskin sees very limited usage I guess
Only one of those cards is actually good to begin with, and it's the one I wanna craft.
I'm missing uh... Cenarius, Millhouse, Nat Pagle, King Mukla, Tinkmaster Overspark, Captain Greenskin, The Black Knight, Gruul, and Malygos
so i'd just be pulling a different legendary
no dupe legendaries though
but my massive hoard of dust also says yes
the win rate says yes but the 1600 dust says no
fucking
All I'm missing is Malygos himself
Should I craft Malygos druid...
also @ british people https://twitter.com/DisguisedToast/status/1018992004309516288 CARDS
the rations
for the boob outfit
need those
dont you uh
AHA
YuriGirl#11101
~~in a shit class~~
spider bomb is a fine magnetic
also, i can get BOTH monthly dolls i missed from the event
magnetic, as a mechanic, is value oriented.
it's too weak. Aggro might run a 2/4, but not a 1/5
aggro wouldn't run the 1/5
Zilliax is Al'akir the Mech Lord
token shaman is my child
we need token shaman
and then devolve to push for the bloodlust turn
during un'goro we had maelstrom portal and jade lightning and jade claws and those were all efficient removal with minions stapled to them
shaman needs more removal spells that do things other than remove
I quite enjoy Shaman's "2 mana 2/2 make token shaman a viable deck" and the legendary which is "3 mana who cares what the stats are double bloodlust lets go"
we already had V-07-TR-0N though
for pkp?
what recipes should I spam to get G11 and PKP?
6P62 IS MINE
I can buy ammo 🤔
3 runs of stage 3 to go
aaaaand im out of ammo
can i get limited doll drops for S ranking the mission itself, or ONLY for S ranking the boss battle?
i am YEEHAW
`protect hat`
The damaged CG tho
all 3 of her home screen lines refer to how sleepy she is
she IS about to pass out at any given moment
I like G11 because she's one of the few dolls who doesn't look like she's getting ready to fuck when she gets damaged
ots-12 is the rare
oh wait this is a 5*
is...an ots-14
the reward for stage four of operation cube
wait
tried a different recipe for sleepy AR

got her in one shot
G41
I crafted a legendary assault rifle! That isn't G11.
spellshifter is only a 1/4 half the time though
Hell, most 2/3s would cut it, but then you're staring down the likes of frostbolt and flame imp
If 1/4 would be just as usable as a two drop for quest paladin and spellshifter isn't in the deck
Am'gam Rager
that's assuming magnets count for the quest

some sort of gloop
ramping isn't as amazing when you also ramp your opponent
biology project is strictly okay
discord why
i will soon also have floop
yeah i have maly druid
yeah but should i?
should i just scrap a couple epics in order to dummy link this legendary
wait you can scrap high leveled dolls for more cores?
why cant i buy cores

it might turn up as a value oriented deck
witchwood apple + ferocious howl is a good combo
i didnt say a good thing
also i guess treant druid is gonna be a thing now
but they wont nerf him
they might hof malygos
the hand refill is what makes the deck function
in any case there's no way they'd nerf malygos. it's the main feature in a lot of decks but it's pretty well designed. I'd see nerfs going at UI instead
arcane tyrants could be cut but they're reaaaaaally good especially with the ramp biology project will bring
lich king doesn't do much except be a big tank in the deck
lich king is replaceable too
with boomsday I'd probably go -1 starfall, -1 innervate, -1 naturalize for +1 floop +2 biology project
yes
AAECAbSKAwhW/gG0A8UEtwbCzgKZ0wKb6AILQF/pAdMD5AigzQKHzgKY0gKe0gLb0wK/8gIA is my current maly druid deck
running both would give you a LOT more breathing room early game because you can waste some of your burn on removal
works just as well with swipe in place of starfire
malygos + twig + floop + starfire + moonfire + moonfire = 16+11+11 damage
if they couldn't be used together, then yeah I'd replace, but they can
flexibility is good, and floop adds more than just "a good combo piece" to the deck
if you draw one, you otk with moonfires
if you draw both, you can otk without moonfires
but then it's useful redundancy
twig isn't redundant in my deck
yeah, but you can run both
it would even open weirder combos with no moonfires
nah. twig + floop would let you pull off the combo easier
i'll probably swap out starfall for floop
my malygos druid runs zero oaken summons and it has a higher win rate than any that do
playing MS2 and someone just starts up with K-On music
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/445994236177809410/469827870617763850/20180720_072750_00.jpg whomst did this
raids are just methods to fund customization
music, houses, outfits
the customization in the game is the best part honestly
vibraphone
maybe i still can as long as im careful
i'd be able to modify that ga1ahad track into a quartet piece if the vocals weren't fucky actually...
ensembles can go up to 8 people btw, so an octet is possible
I can dig up music that would work well as a quartet but there's no way to see how good I can make it without actually having you there
having a quartet to play it
you know
also <@!102691114762371072> it's ridiculously hard to compose a quartet without
also I'm gonna try some... experimenting with this midi to see if I can unfuck the vocals
and timpani
everyone gets a free piano
eurgh, that midi is poorly split
im inspired im gonna do this now fuck dilating
sax for the witch's part, trumpet for ga1ahad's part, and piano for... piano
https://musescore.com/hakumi/ga1ahad-and-scientific-witchery holy shit, yes we are playing this as a 3 parter
and i can make ga1ahad a 2 parter. Might be nice that way with sax and piano.
this will probably be good for sax if i can ever find instrumentation for this song
also good for sax
just go to tria, buy a 3k, and open that file up in the editor
should fit on a 3k scroll
this is good on sax
the cash shop ones just let you queue songs
you can probably get most instruments in game on launch
and drag everyone here into playing
i wanna find some super complicated 8 part piece
this game is the mmo i've wanted for years
on launch people will probably sell scores, but I have no reason to get 20 use scores because i can just make the scores myself
I can buy 10 or 20 use scrolls, but 20 uses are only good for saving space if you have a bunch of one song

YEEHAW
IT SOUNDS GOOD
IT WORKS
it all fits onto one score
nope, 3mle autocompresses the mess i left with tracks 9 and 11
which means this is a quartet piece
guess i need to isolate violin and piano tracks i guess
it's too big
I HAVE FINISHED
track 1: complete
almost done with the first track
but that's easy comparatively
i'll probably need to compress it
if this ends up sounding like garbage im tossing my computer out of the window
also, halfway done with one track
but yes, there's room for... 27 other people in this guild on launch
since each instrument is synth, the composition of a score is usually "which synth fits this best"
but picking a part doesn't really work in maplestory
there is always room until we have 8 members
honestly, this is more of an eye for music if anything. just gotta know what notes look like.
BUT GOD DAMN IT I'M GONNA TRY
and it might not even work
it's tedious
the music is already there, I'm just splitting it manually for use in maplestory
this is just coding honestly
especially when you're listening to TWO SETS OF VOCALS AT ONCE
editing a midi by hand is VERY ANNOYING
ill
i can try splitting the piano bit up a bit too
i made the score btw
`yes`
i just need people to test it with
THE SONG HAS BEEN CREATED
even unsplit, it's still 16 tracks
using an editor that only holds 15 tracks at a time, with a midi that has 30 tracks when split
that's me, converting Bloody Stream into MML
I WILL BECOME A GOD
<@!102691114762371072>
THE POWER YOU CAN WIELD IN THIS GAME IS TOO GREAT

but i dunno what to split the piano piece into
i feel like a 5 person orchestra might be needed for bloody stream
i guess
get up
You can't get in without a key right now, but they'll probably do official launch by the end of the year
You might notice issues on your end, but anyone with a decent connection will see it fine
Since the ensemble is server side
Latency doesn't matter for ensembles.
but save your merets
Right now, no.
We'll include you, but you have to actually be online.
Latooni, once I've made enough music to fill a 10 minute window we're gonna play at Queenstown
Trombone is also good
I definitely prefer the trumpet solo over the sax solo
Maplestory 2
lemme see how it sounds with a trumpet
sax solo like that is *okay*
but i dunno how good that'd sound
I could easily merge the trumpet and sax and just drop the drums
i dunno how i'd do a sax solo
If you were there I would have made the Bloody Stream piece an 8 part
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maX13aGRbno> Bloody Stream
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtTNczSaQw8> Decisive Battle

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maX13aGRbno&feature=youtu.be I've been working on this for like a day now and it was so worth it
That is American Legend Guy Fieri
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLSycJtxmKs&feature=youtu.be I've done it again
`horng`
...i found the midi on musescore and all the effort i put in of matching instruments is immediately wasted because i could have just copied it from here
It'll be a lot better once the recorder is in game and I could proooobably split the sax up a bit but otherwise it should sound fine
"this is gonna take all week" *finishes it in a few hours*
i still need to check the second half of the midi
but better
not good
which makes things better
okay it doesnt look like there are any tempo changes outside of the intro
I had an ocarina for Clash on the Big Bridge
at all
like
since they aren't 1:1 analogues to their real world counterparts
i also have to figure out what exact instrument everyone needs to play
and at the end of it all? I can't actually listen to the result without gathering 9 other people in game and playing it, because the editor only lets me open 15 tracks at once, i can't preview an ensemble in game, and since I've changed things, I can't rely on the original midi to be representative of what I've created
and then i have to figure out if i delete the tempo change or if i force it in
sometimes there's no room for a tempo change. sometimes the tempo change is mid-beat (fucking Exterminate)
And for each tempo change, I have to find the exact location that the tempo change belongs
I'm working with 26 tracks and a lot of tempo changes
the hard part is sorting out the immense bullshit that tempo changes introduce. In a midi, tempo changes on one track, no problem, song works fine as long as you've set it up correctly. In MML, you must manually add that tempo change to every. single. track.
what do you mean?
i'll be working on this for a week
kemono friends has enough tempo changes
if i had a midi of that i'd be able to do it pretty easily hones- nope

WELCOME TO YOUKOSO JAPARI PAAKU
Who also has a bunny outfit, although a different one.
If there's piano it has to be Gas Gas Gas, and while you might mistake the vibraphone for a piano, I haven't used it in any 3 person videos, so yeah you're talking about Koharu.
Except for Remembrance, which is just me on the vibraphone.
I'm on trumpet for Decisive Battle, The Man with the Machine Gun, and Clash on the Big Bridge. Are you mixing Imutone and Koharu up? Because each of my videos has at least one of them on either trumpet or saxophone.
Bloody Stream, Clash on the Big Bridge, and Welcome to Japari Park are the only ones Imutone is in, and she's not on trumpet for Clash on the Big Bridge.
There isn't even a trumpet in Gas Gas Gas
I'm on piano in Gas Gas Gas, but Imutone isn't in that one
I don't think I've been on piano in any of my videos lemme check
i think ten is talking about ira
gabby's only in two of my videos
imutone?
do you not see me wildly flailing with my cello
yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OXYeMmRpp4 hey guys play maplestory 2
GIVE ME TOKEN SHAMAN BLIZZARD
TOKEN SHAMAN
VOLTAIC BURST
sfdfsefwefwegfrgd
WITH BINARY
OKAY BUT WE CAN HANDLE THIS
i solved the FUCKING PROBLEM
11 = bigender
10 = agender
01 = female
00 = male
MY GENDER IS 10 FUCK THIS KICKSTARTER DUDE
I HAVE A FUCKING 2 BIT GENDER
dpofjaSOIFJSOIEFJES
JUST INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT CAN BE ON OR OFF
"but alice what if you want something sort of on or sort of off" FUCK YOU
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
BASE FUCKING SIXTEEN
KNOW WHAT WE DO WHEN WE NEED TO GO BEYOND SHIT ON AND SHIT OFF?
THATS WHY ITS BINARY
OR SHITS OFF
SHITS ON
IM FUCKING
IM 3 MINUTES IN
and they rush you to the end game im just like cool it lemme roam around undead town or panda land
i like wow conceptually but everything happens too fast
GFL is fun but the grind is starting to catch up with me
damn
God
worst case outcome this hits your floop instead *but that's still 22 damage from moonfires*
no
mech'thun isn't good
2 mana maly
10 mana discount two minions in your hand WHY THE HELL NOT
Drakkari Enchanterrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
oh hey look a melon target
oh hey its me
and gloop
floop's glorious gloop
you trust floop, don't you? floop and his gloop
would you like to be sprayed with floop's gloop?
do you like floop's gloop, saki?
so we're going from having a neutral hard counter that works 100% of the time to a class hard counter that works not 100% of the time
ooze already counters current maly druid
but in any case, even if demonic project counters it
doesn't really need TWO gloop sprayers i guess
do you think i could fit a dorian in that deck
i mean there's mulchmuncher but that doesn't go in malygos druid
they still haven't shown us druid's 10 mana minion yet though
1 mana
it's literally just "summon malygos"
that's gonna be druid's legendary spell
ez
just run two maly
but they can't do it until the start of the next year
maly SHOULD be hall of famed, because while he's underwhelming at best in most situations, any time a combo with him pops up it's always ridiculous and dumb and shouldn't exist
they literally cant, people would go ballistic
they cant
this is going to be busted
*vibrates in malygos*
I was gonna say "kinda needs an innervate" BUT BIOLOGY PROJECT IS ALREADY INNERVATE
this + 2x biology project 1x Flobbidinous Floop 2x Juicy Psychmelon 2x Dreampetal Florist 2x Gloop Sprayer
GLOOP MALY FLOOP, FEATURING: PRINCE TALDARAM AND DREAMPETAL FLORIST
HOLY SHIT
here are my current deck names
Like, hunter is green, so all my hunter decks were Kirika songs
I used to name each deck by color
I actually just name all my decks after symphogear songs
flappy bird coming in for the kill
MY MEMES ARE THE TRUE
or summon copies of all minions in your hand
druid's legendary spell is probably gonna be 6 mana summon a copy of all your minions or something
I only play good decks, like quadygos
you have to not be in a fight
if you get challenged it takes you out
actually do not need to do the tutorial
after deleting a few
do you have too many friends? I've got 187 right now.
i sent a request
okay, resend
my friends list must be full
OH i know what the issue is
that works
Latooni help me with hearthstone science
im seeing no request
YuriGirl#11101
im testing it in game right now if anyone wants to help me
...I think
Charged Devilsaur doesn't get an enchantment from its battlecry.
cool
If you play Charged Devilsaur from hand, silence it, and then give it charge with Tundra Rhino, can it attack face that turn?
i only need the coins from the dragon
you can start just passing now
and play the hoarding dragons when you can
draw cards as much as you can
borrow custom warlock
ok i made a deck for you
i was gonna use burgly bully to generate coins
im gonna have to make a deck for you too in that case
ok lemme fix up my deck then
challenge me to a wild duel
i cant challenge you to a wild duel
ok back
im gonna go get food while i wait
the hearthstone tutorial is way too long
sent!
If you wanna add me you have to give me your tag
I apparently can't receive friend requests
?
the copies will also be (1)
he is with this shit
arugal is also in aggro mage
arugal
no big deal
5 legendaries
just fucking
luna too
whats aluneth
hello aggro mage

We've seen 3 spells and 4 minions
it also might not be a minion
FLOOP'S GLOOP
they've revealed most of the class
druid still has one more possible minion coming in bdp
dont give druid more than they already have, but also give druid a good 10 mana minion for psychmelon
but it'll also remove things like charge
yeah, silencing the 1/1s will give them their old stats back
Zerek's Cloning Gallery?
which 9 mana priest spell
that's why we needed tundra rhino
no, it does
IT WORKS
MALY PALADIN
*SLAMS FISTS ON TABLE*
control pally is a thing now sure am glad i have uther
odd rogue is the real threat
shaman vomits minions onto the board constantly
zoolock loses if they can't take out your tokens AND you quickly enough
zoolock and odd rogue are the current meta dominators
i can deal with being hard countered every 15 games
so 2/30
and 2 of those druids were taunt druids, and taunt druid doesn't run spreading plague
4 were against druids
I've played 30 games this week so far.
I'll bump into taunt druid once out of every maybe 20 games?
Druid is a ghost at rank 5+
not unless druid just has that much representation
and spreading plague alone cannot break the deck
Devolve exists. There is precedent.
we've got probably 2 more shaman spells coming, one of which might absolutely wreck spreading plague
everyone is going off on how useless this card is but hey what if i turn my army of 1/1 sparks into legendaries
TOKEN SHAMAN
4 MANA 5/1 MECH WITH RUSH
THEY MADE A RAGER WORTH PLAYING
it's a token druid card
the gloop is token druid

THE GLOOOOOOP
THE GLOOP
this is neat
I... think some people do? I'm not sure.
NAXX IS OUT
I have 11.5k gold and a bunch of dust
I have good odds of getting SOMETHING i want
but freebie class legendary + double preorder for 2 golden legendaries + 130 packs which automatically gives me at least 4 legendaries
5 more days
no
anyway, I am guaranteed, at an absolute minimum, to get 7 legendaries out the gate, and that is the worst case scenario
*hearthstone's back*

im mostly posting this because post credits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTvK-zOVtp4
I have it!
yeah lets shove pulls into live shitposting
NICE
oh hey, free legendary of my choosing
I AM SO DOING THIS
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
IT'S OUT
2 minutes...
*but it was all a lie, Boomsday isn't out for another 7 minutes*
BOOMSDAY IS OUT

which allows... interesting elevators
They're also bouncy and negate fall damage
3x3 slime balls makes a slime block which pulls any block it's touching when moved by a piston (including other slime blocks)
it's an aura, you can't silence it
i already said that it's a permanent continuous event
oh i didnt know this happened
allow my massive hoard of gold to see use for once
I DO
your minions are your removal
it's a terrible aggro card
it's a great control and midrange card
use lifedrinkers
good
not
spellstone is
and uhhh
i would drop the giggling inventor there for another doomguard
also sure
i like how it looks
that one's from hsreplay
AAECAaoIBMAH88ICofgCmfsCDb0B+QOGBvAHkwnrwgKw8AL28AKz9wLq+gKP+wKc/wKKgAMA
I can make a list with electra if you'd prefer, but I don't think she's what the deck needs
my list doesn't use electra though
yeah hang on lemme throw something together
deck list for what?
And overload shaman would LOVE electra
But overload shaman might pop up later on
Token Shaman is the only viable one right now
almsot won my first game, but it was a control shaman who managed to outvalue me
I'm using Secret Hunter
I'm theorycrafting a non-zoo aggro deck with soularium but that's something else entirely
At least not right now
Soularium is a good card but it's not a zoolock card
