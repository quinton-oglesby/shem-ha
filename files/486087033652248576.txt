What is going on here
Not all heroes end up winning in the end
Just bittersweet
Regardless it was still a good ending
If I had hit at least once the campaign would still be alive
The first and last session of a campaign that ended in a bittersweet defeat had me in fights where I rolled 4 natural 4s in a row
Tetraphobia
Fourth- fuck, I hate this number. Fifth.

A lot of petting.

These are all good.

If they wish so.
Brain's getting slower the closer it is to midnight
But either than that, we won't say anything further until there's further points to be made about needing more mods
I suppose so
Little issues confronting people, though.
~~We've muted certain channels just for less clutter, to note~~
We're just not very tech savvy
I wouldn't *mind* being a mod

<@722121666641133608> What do you want gay
Who pinged us
<:TriplePeek:689568598938615939>
One step closer to Geah World Domination, I'd say
Brunei, on the Island of Borneo.

Number of Symphogear fans among the populace: 2
Yeah, I tend to go around the Geah subreddit - and lately the r/anime rewatches (though I'm always a few hours late since it happens in 6 AM where I am)
Awesome
I will assume that '21496 pics' isn't an exaggeration 

I've been there myself
Can't go wrong with the Symphogear Fandom after all
First time actually using Discord

Hi Sparkle
Terminators are jokes now
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Tanks cool
Yeah, but they work best when you're slapping all your Strategems on then. Which you can only do on one squad. So one unit of three is ideal but I'm not paying more money for a box set just to get one more model
Yeh but that's about 640 points of stuff and oh boy when they whiff everything it hurts
They're pretty swingy though so I still tend to use my Havocs/Predators
Just two lol
I do have them
But I like taking Noise Marines as Troops (regular Marines die too easily and I ain't painting a horde of filthy Cultists)

You're talking to two servants of Chaos here, sadly
No idea
As expected from a scion of Tzeentch

I hear my plastic talk on a daily occasion
Maybe
tmw I played Soulstorm a couple hours ago and I read that in the Warriors' voice
the first 10 of 20 Warriors that will ride in Venoms
And so it begins

<@189283693557186560> Dark Eldar models are amazingly customizable <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
Took a break from painting to do some building instead

<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
been about a couple weeks since I started painting it up

With the lower body done, I'm halfway complete
Right leg done <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
It's only when you stop searching for it, that the piece will appear once again
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
it's a reality you will accept at some point
that part goes to the shadow realm
and a part comes off
When a model kit falls
<:PharaDab:336657302914596866>
Will probably take another month to finish everything
Meanwhile Imma stop painting all my Marines for a while because 1) Trims and 2) my entire Chaos army uses White which I have ran out of and don't like using regardless because white is so damn easy to fuck up
for a while
you're gonna be staring at those models
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Play what you think you'll enjoy painting and building in the end
Pretty much the deciding factor that made me go for their edgy cousins (aside from the fact that they're just cooler to me)
half of their shit isn't even in plastic
Beware of Craftworlds
*"Did you sell your soul doing these?"*
I see their checkered colour schemes and just
and Orks
except Harlequins
Makes me appreciate Xeno aesthetic more
Me with my Knight's armour pieces
This felt like a breeze in comparison
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>

fitting called Dark Eldar
in spaaaaaaaaaace
basically Dark Elves
err
They need so much *gold*
Imma just put all my non-Drukhari models on hold for now
<:KirikaScared:672584678993297431>
> the trimming for the titans for example was a bitch
Yeah, painting the trims on my Knight is eating into my gold paints
and I was worried on how it would turn out in execution
It took a while to come up with the scheme
Thank you <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
I hate Space Marine armour trims so much now
2 hours on a single Warrior (complete with edge highlighting, shading, etc) compared to the 4-5 hours on just doing things for a Marine
I'm definitely having a lot more fun painting them than anything I've done thus far
<:PharaDab:336657302914596866>


<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>

But yeah, white paints are infamous
~~fuck gotta stop flirting~~
I'll hold your hands
<:OgawaRead:688429716507721770> Which would reflect a lot better on my spending list
the price of 2 Talos
and 4 Scourges are like
cause I want either 4 Scourge boxes or 3 Talos boxes
Still gonna think about Scourges VS Talos
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
impossible to hide, blocks your units, etc
and yeah big models are ass to move on the field
Nothing like stabbing yourself on your own models
Get rid of those horrid trims I have yet to paint
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I'm thinking about selling parts of my Chaos army for more Drukhari too
Missile broadsides can be real mean though
but yeah Battlesuits eat $$$
Can never go wrong with the Tau SC
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
at least Crisis Suits come with the Start Collecting
Everything that isn't a Crisis suit basically eats your $
Oh yeah Battlesuits are pricy asf
My four Venoms, three Ravagers and two Raiders already make me think about buying a bigger transport case
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
It's more due to transporting them
> Talos Pain Engine are very good
It's either this or Scourges
Make people wait for plastic models all this time just to shove that price up people's asses
Absolutely zero logic aside from "fuck xenos" really
like what lmao
5 Banshees are the same price as 10 Reivers
Incubi and Banshees both
I'll probably just buy an ass-ton of Scourges for Special Weapon spam <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
can fuck right off
Five Incubi being the exact price as a Talos Pain Engine
except Incubi <@!471416654346321930>
Can't wait to get more DE models
<:PharaDab:336657302914596866>

and that's because shipping has been ceased due to recent events
I have yet to build at least 26 more infantry
Hopefully buying another spray can won't hurt my wallet too much
<:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377>

I just need the weather to be suitable for spray painting <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the size of my thumb
compared to the capsule which is
Then again it's a big can
but the time it's gonna cut down will be insane
The can was three times the cost of a capsule of paint
to apply all the gunmetal silver - the primary colour I chose - all over these in a matter of minutes
I got myself a can of spray paint (basically a can version of the colour I handbrush onto these guys)
Well yes but actually no
Space elf ships tend to be a bit funny-looking
<:PharaDab:336657302914596866> but it does make them easier to transport I guess
These vehicles are oddly smaller than I expected
Nothing like spending 5 straight hours just building plastic models

Me when deciding my paints
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
This afternoon's progress

These aren't the official models though. They're supposed to have a BDSM gladiator aesthetic. Wasn't a fan of that so I just bought more Warrior models and gave them knife and pistol arms (which are the official Wych weapons) instead of rifles.
compared with my gun-wielding "Warriors"
essentially gladiators that run in and stab thing
They're called "Wyches"
More Space Dark Elves
10 models done in a weekend <:PharaDab:336657302914596866>

First five done yesterday. Time to do 5 more Wyches today. <:LeiurFlashy:674522617989955595>

God I don't like the Harlequin aesthetic at all
*notices Skyweavers and their Haywire Cannons*
Now I'm planning on either sticking with pure Dark Eldar or extending to the Craftworlds/Harlequins <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
In just a week, I've done about over a quarter of my army
My dumbass is still considering what else to buy honestly
Finally painted up the leader of my army <:PharaDab:336657302914596866>

Still working on the cockpit, but the body is done <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>


Which is why the gold on the right looks less fake
and then added some extra paints that act as shaders to make certain colours look better
Everything on the right uses the same paints as the left, except I switched white for silver
It's why I changed to gunmetal silver nowadays <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
*shrugs*
Something about the pigments
Apply it on when you're not careful, you get a result that looks like chalk instead of a white smooth finish
Paint dries up in the capsule when you're not looking
Too bad white is one of the hardest colours to work with <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
"You shouldn't compare yourself to anyone except the you of yesterday"
10 in a week. Guess I'll paint some vehicles today as a break.

<:PharaDab:336657302914596866>
An entire Warrior squad done in one and a half afternoons

Yeah, sounds about right
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Now if only I knew when the other half of it will start shipping
Three weekends in and I've painted up almost half of my army already

<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
just makes the model easier to break
> what's up with Geedubes and their dumb platforms lately
God I hate it
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
I thankfully have a lot of spare Daemon Prince heads and Knight faceplates
Yeah
I need that Drazhar model so bad. Will modify it a bit to remove some bling because Drazhar is a no-nonsense fighter but regardless I neeeeeed
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
but I think it looks neat
It's not optimal
and a lot of it is through conversions and kitbashing <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>

Yeeeeee

I had one big boi that had a some big doggo tagging alongside him
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
That's no fun
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>

I don't have pictures of them
I miss my old toys

More Kabalite Warriors and Wyches for the army


~~also yes it's ninja-themed~~

Nice to see that I've gotten better at thinning my paints and colour scheme creation after 7 months of painting
Nah, I got 5 more to build and paint
Added the finishing touches to my latest commander.
Long way to go, but my country's lockdown got extended to June so I got plenty of time apparently <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Hopefully they'll arrive by Monday or Tuesday
and Drazhar to do
14 Wyches, 10 Scourges, 2 Venoms, 2 Raiders, 3 Ravagers
I still have 10 Warriors
Errr no
<:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377>
Just me being me
Could've come out better but eh, I should get around to planning what to paint that severed head with.
Some progress made on another one of my commanders. One good thing that happened today at least. <:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>

About 3/4th of the whole thing yeah
Now I can just focus on applying all the other colours
Somehow I did it
Spent 5 hours turning grey plastic into chrome silver

Excuse me if this is rude, but I feel this is leaning towards <#567740255273222175> more than <#458060276550336522>

Zoooom
I'm just reorganizing things
It's all the same shelf
<:sipp:642295718933037057>

plenty of units to use so my army lists aren't always the same
An excess of over 2500 at least
~~it will definitely seal the pain of being stuck outside my home country for an unknown period of time~~
Can't wait to buy two more boxes of Scourges and two more Start Collecting boxes to finish the entire army up while still having some back up models in case several point drops occur for the army
take in the scent of plastic glue ~~don't actually do it~~

And that's all I can think of at the top of my head.
As if time is slowing down so you feel every aching moment
In tense moments, I always get more descriptive of environments, feelings, etc
The part I'd expand on is perhaps her slowly backpedaling
so that part being short isn't too bad.
For quick movement such as fighting, I always recommend them to keep them brief if you want a sense of speed
Similar to my previous comment, maybe describing whatever emotions (fear, surprise, etc) the POV character is experiencing either through body language (hairs on the back of her neck rising, etc) or something else
The next three paragraphs are short, but it's a draft, so it here's where I'd expand on more
So the first two paragraphs are solid. Nothing much to say about them except for a little bit of spelling here and there. Perhaps going into detail of the POV subtly fighting back against the cold like tightening whatever they're wearing?

i.e painting everything in silver and then just filling in everything else so you don't have to worry about that damn armour trim.
Thankfully, you learn how to find cheat-techniques to get paint on faster.
For the rebuilding of an army that I boxed because our self from over half a year ago hated how the old scheme was and couldn't find the will to paint Chaos models because of it.
Testing out a new colour scheme.
Three test models complete

both armies are perty different in terms of design too so we play what we're in the mood for basically

I don't like seeing what Voy and I used to paint like
Mm.
I suppose I'll talk about it in general.
It's an entire subfaction's gimmick.
Oh they are
But yes. I need something to back up this infantry-heavy force.
Heh.
Inevitably. They're troop transports, which I need to ferry the grunts safely to the front.
Rules-wise, it's a mess to play with.
Sadly the ~~Chaos Knight~~ spiky mecha is more of a display piece now.

So about 888 dollars of models when converted into USD.

Sunaipa
Druids who hail from the Circle of Bloom keenly observe the cycle of life that goes on within the natural world. They particularly surround their focus on their knowledge of flowers, the medium in which plants carry out their daily reproduction. Through a complete understanding of the relationship that lies between these flowers, a cycle of life, and the inherent mystical nature of the world around them, these druids are capable of channeling the power of life to bolster themselves and their allies.

Love the customization in 30 Minutes Mission kits
Alto Assault
Alto Artillery
Alto High-Mobility
Alto Regular
But the backpack felt the best
or waist
or legs
Could place them on the arms
Yeah, no regrets buying the Option Box for those guns
It really is just an off-brand GM

From just the base kit, to using an option parts box, to using two option parts boxes + a space pack from the model in the back.

You got a picture on the Dilanza's manual?

Chris feeds her all the time
Hibiki would influence her as that one awesome aunt

So pretty much all of that except the drinking
I just want some sort of happiness to come out of this
I'm just reading it so I can see how it ends now
now it's full blown kill-me-please

hmmmmm
Tall, long, messy hair
~~I prefer Idolmaster tbh~~

<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
You're just seeing things
What an absolute unit

~~The teacher trio were hooooooooot~~
Hilariously wholesome
trying to do teenage things
Side M was fun, especially since most of the cast were adult men
to no avail
Tried looking it up on Google
I haven't yet
~~I have no bias for hot guys I swear~~
Side M was cool tho
2011 has my heart, but the other Idolmaster shows were kinda eh
I honestly can't remember much outside of the 2011 anime
She is one of the more likeable CG girls tbh
182 cm tall

and armour that you can't penetrate without a special item
Apexes in Gen Ultimate are just the regular monsters except with bloated stats
Deviant
satan
Not to be confused with Genjuuro, who is her blood-related brother but is her adopted!father
Tsubasa's not!blood-related brother

God Eater outfits good
No amount of Bayonet can wash this taste away
Why XDU
No coincidence that the kid is - of course - blue-eyed, blonde and white.
Even Gundam sometimes.
Never trust Japan with Nazi Germany stuff.
They really tried to make an "uwu shota" out of this
Someone in the XDU writing team had a vision, and there was sadly no one there to club them over the head with a steel chair.
Shenanigans ensue with Chris protecting him from his fash pursuers
Goes to earth to see the ocean.
Kid is a born out of a program involving kids with knives to make the strongest Fuhrer
Replace "I want to be a Hokage" with "I want to be a Fuhrer"

your*
"Beyond the Mirror" is the title, I believe. Probably what you're friend was talking about.
Well there is a video on Youtube that mixes Waikyou Shenshoujin with Beyond the Blade Ignite to make it sound like an Ignite version
You say that like it's a bad thing
>Incomplete Love Split in Half
How much further can they go with KirikaXShirabe
>kirika b-side is named happy birthday song
And I thought Kirika singing Christmas songs was already cute enough
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
grab ye pitchforks
Isn't Chris' birthday on December?
Must be the Dark Hour from Persona 3
inb4 the new antagonists get sidelined in the end and don't get much screentime
That new ED is a banger <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
You had me excited for a second there <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
He only mentioned Symphogear once in his videos, I believe
Sometimes the truth must be spoken with passion unchained
That sounds like something better left in the dark
I have a bad feeling about the newcomers
No better way to end it all
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792> Indeed it is
Doesn't the OP typically play in the 2nd episode?
Hibernate for a week
Shirabe looking fierce <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
It's all because of love
In the end
I just wanna see Genjuuro punch out a villain like in S1 again
~~does this mean a new sequence to get new people to watch Symphogear~~
Weekly Symphogear is almost upon us oh God what is that even like
If Chris gets to shoot god in the face, I will be satisfied
*record scratch*
Narrator: "They weren't fine"
Yeah, that would be terrible
DarKanade
Dark Kanade
What manner of Chris bullying will they plan again, I wonder
Oh the temptation...
You can never have enough dakka
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
**new guns**
*new guns*
New guns
but I need that Geah fix
I want to go in as blind as I can
I'm conflicted whether or not I want another trailer
Hibiki just drops F-bombs all over the set
Ver's actor would be the type that's really shy in real life, but bombastic in-character
If it's a play, then I can't help but think of the actors being the opposite of their characters

Like Tsubasa being really snarky and outgoing
**The girls will be back soon**  <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
I shall nap until the subs are up
It's almost time <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
100 dollar smiles
I have half a mind to take a nap before the episode is available for viewing
I'm shaking all over
and I am a ball of excitement
It's 4 AM
I feel happy to be alive
For the first time in my life
phrase*
I'm reciting Hibiki's henshin phase over and over
It's 4 AM and I can't sleep
A combination of squeeling, analyzing, tears and applause
I'm probably gonna spend an unhealthy amount of time just looking at Chris' henshin sequence when it arrives
~~I wonder if I could meet the Geahs if I did~~
Sadly(?), no
~~Now I want to wear a scarf even though I live in a tropical country~~
Hibiki ain't my favorite chara', but this nearly brings a tear to the eye
My beautiful girl
My girl
just to see the evolution overtime
I even went and rewatched all of Hibiki's past henshin sequences
an hour and a half from sunrise
Just relentless screaming
My feeling for the past hour
Kanade had that in spades
Definitely not blood
It's jam
they're outright *posing*
They didn't just flex
His sacrifice was not in vain
Let us all take a moment to realize that Doctor ~~Sugita~~ Ver watches from above with a smile on his face
Reason to not live: 0
Reasons to live: **SYMPHOGEAH**
so many things to look forward to
Oh lawd
It's 5 AM but I'm still gushing so bad
I love them so much
Shirabe and Kirika outright had a ice-skating attack
Kirika can life her up cause Kirika never lets Shirabe down <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
probably
Science babies
They didn't say that they can sing in space, but they didn't say that they **couldn't** sing in space
level of*
Foreshadowing implies a level subtlety
5 22 AM and I still can't relax...
God the instrumentals that kick in around the time that Hibiki's charm-point is shown is so good
I said it here first folks
She's the elder sister of that girl that Hibiki saved in Season 1 Episode 1
<:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
Scarf Hibiki is making me reconsider my Geah tier list
Oh man
The man fired the beacon that paved the way for that glorious 6-way song
it was Signal Flare Man
Nah
Something something heat-field
Villain power scaling: Yes
Seeing the Geahs struggle in the opening for once is a nice change
Shirabe is the power bottom
Hell yeah
Well. The hype has settled for me. I'm gonna collapse now before sunrise appears. That was a fun episode guys. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
*This is not Fine*
This is not Fine
Oh noes
Crunchyroll ~~or yarrrrrrrrr~~
<:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
The fact that they could possibly top that
Kirika already had an amazing henshin sequence in AXZ
It's work of goddamn art
Nothing like waking up, and then rewatching that transformation first thing in the morning to get the adrenaline pumping
<:Germain:421434126856486912> Determination to rewatch
You say that like it's a bad thing
She needs more food
Chris is still the shortest
Shimapan + Striped Stockings <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Hope they don't job too badly to the Geahs
rip intense wubs
Not fully feeling Hibiki's new song, but I'll probably like it overtime
It's only been a few hours since the episode came out and I'm feelin the withdrawal already. So this is weekly Symphogear... <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
God this is practically a culmination of everything that came before

~~Watching again for the 30th time~~ I just noticed that Hibiki sung out her transformation phrase while making a martial arts stance, instead of just simply holding out her pendant like the previous seasons. Which makes me wonder what kind of stances are we gonna get with the other girls when they initiate their Geahs. Got help me if Chris makes a finger gun...
Alternatively, he played monsters, or was the transformation belt's voice itself...
Even when he got into Kamen Rider, a famous henshin hero show, his character was transformed the entire time
Sugita has no luck with transforming heroes
Oh man, these edits never fail to surprise me
Tsubasa, flat, but has a round bottom. Just like a good blade and its round pommel.
yes
Then again, with all the seasons combined, we're far beyond that number now
compared to being a 40+ episode show
at least Symphogear is only 13 episodes
I see this so much in henshin hero shows like Kamen Rider
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Everything else feels tame by comparison
Symphogear officially has my favorite henshin sequences now
Symphogear is a lot to take in
It's okay
that was hilarious
I remember using a guide just to know what was the watch order
Doesn't help that this is the 5th season in a long-running franchise
<:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>  <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
High five <@139432096023183360>
gotta hit that angst quota
I expect more Chris suffering as usual
What will they do with Maria this season, I wonder
named after a great person
Daughter to Hibiki and Miku
Starring Tachibana Kanade
Senki Zesshou Symphogear NEXT SymphoGeneration
*Oh*
Oh
what
Yeah, that would dumb. Let Ver stay in heaven, where he is.
The moment Hibiki says "Will you marry me", Miku just goes Winter Soldier on everyone
Miku is a sleeper agent
Hey, a 20 is still better than a 0 <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
have a tomato
I clap for those words, Maria
It's a goddamn Holy Corpse
God I love her
Thought something looked different in the Carol fight lol
... Their outlines changed because of that?
Took me a while to remember Ignite has Phases lol
like Chris
I liked Ignite for certain characters
they stuck out a bit next to the new transformations
somewhat bothered me that AXZ reused Ignite transformations from GX
At least they won't have to make more transformation sequences
~~Kanade was cool tho~~
Pretty much
So much want
So many questions for XV
I was squeeling, despite it being 4 AM
I need more of Hibiki's Kiais whenever she transforms
Oh yeah, that happened
but goddamn this sequence is the *bomb*
I know animation and live-action are different things
blew it out of the water
This just
Just a few days ago I witnessed the a henshin sequence that culminated 20 years of Kamen Rider
Gotta love how when everyone jumped down, Kirika just smiles all the way while everyone went to business
Regardless, gonna be afk for 2 hours. Hope XV can keep up the energy for the following eps
That's something else entirely ~~that we won't see animated for at least half 5 years~~
Part 7
Until like
JoJo is very much that
Interesting to hear other opinions anyway
It's alright kek
Hello Geah Weekends
Goodbye JoJo Fridays
Lol
I have to stay up till 2 AM just for my Geah fix
probably
Someone's gonna die in the end
Elfnein has her own battles to fight, after all <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
Wouldn't mind having another male character that is reasonable
We don't know if all the Custodians are bad
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
We probably wouldn't have gotten a man like <:Ver:336656981144109066>  though
We often forget how terrifying faceless mooks can be when the scene isn't focusing a henshin hero
body horror as in excess jam amirite
She's gone a long way
then seeing her now, breaking out the martial arts as she henshins
but man, seeing Hibiki's first transformation where she's screaming in agony as Gungnir ~~datto?!~~ awakens
"don't you love it when you're enemies-turned-friends die to power up your form-fitting super armor?"
~~I'm having Kamen Rider flashbacks~~
~~Maria is gonna die~~
Like the whole thing with how her relic is spelled
A wonderful pair
Chris and spelling shenanigans
Considering how the two started off in G, Shirabe and Hibiki for them chainsaw fists
*for a year*
OH MY GOD I WAS LOOKING FOR THAT
XV would be unimaginably great
AXZ was already great
*adds to list of things I want in XV*
That just reminds me of the fact that Shirabe is a yoyo-god but we never get to see her do yo-yo tricks in the slice-of-life scenes
the thought of Kirika messing up during practice is amusing
When did the two get the time to learn ice-skating techniques, I wonder
"lemme smash"
it's too much for the minds of mortals
I can't imagine that
~~while it lasts~~
let us enjoy the peace
Silence
Well there's liking a character, and then liking them for who they are
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
I try not to
I do
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>  <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
It's gonna bee a Mega-Dess Party
Or characters outright weaponizing their barriers while transforming
So you get scenes with characters giving a beat down while still dressing up
I don't see much Mahou Shoujo, but it typically appears in Kamen Rider
Real-time transformations are pretty rare
"The unexpected is always expected" <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Do you have the Determination to Feel
~~ai yo~~
Inb4 it gets played in the finale, fisting everyone in the feelings
we got Part 7 earlier than we thought
~~I wanna hug a Geah even though I probably won't feel that warmth~~
The Kazanaris have one hell of a family tree
I'd get to pummel my friend and his Tsubasa with my dakka waif
I wouldn't mind an ArcSys Symphogear game
or have waifu war with your friends with a fighting game
Depends if you either wanna beat the crap out of a thousand NPCs
for a variety of reasons
We'd get riots in the streets
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
That bush, red mane is just
I would like her hair to just flow in all of its red glory
Opinions, I suppose. I love that blade flourish Maria does at the end of her AXZ henshin. Though her GX henshin *was* a bit lacking in some areas.
So I have high hopes for the rest
I feel that Hibiki typically has the weakest ones out of the 6
~~it kinda loses its effect when it gets its ass kicked the next episode~~
It's main appeal comes from the fact that it's pretty much a walking monument to 20 years of henshin heroes
I have half a mind to edit Hibiki over Zi-O when Woz starts fanboying over what the henshin sequence
~~DarKanade~~
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
This calls for a riot
Kurisu has become one with the spelling shenanigans
Sounds like my kind of party <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Settle a decade of costant waifu wars
Woah Hibiki's new songs are bloody fire ~~and depression~~
Madoka is pretty much in a constant state of "We're working on the sequel"
~~I know cause Rule 34~~
I mean, we got Phantom Thief outfits in XD
Adam is a half-boiled boi
*Alchemic calculations fly all over the screen*
"I've found the winning formula"
BEST MATCH
ELFNEIN
CAROL
The Two Alchemists in One
Elfnein singing? I can imagine Elfnein stepping onto the field, then in Minorin's voice, "Guess I'll take over from here for now"
I miss the GX Autoscorers
Something something Chad Ver and Virgin Adam
Carol clearly hasn't learned about the whole "No body, they're still alive" thing
Shirabe, "I'm about to end this whole girl's career"
So are we punching the solar system now
Ah right we got a new trio
My half-serious prediction would be Hibiki and Miku proposing to each other before punching a heart-shaped projectile into god
We're all on this pain train together
3-4 days till the next episode <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
O
Y
U
S
E
D
I
A
except Red Hot Blaze
firing all of them
She better be pulling out every single gun she's used in the franchise
straight out of the Matrix
is just an armory
Chris' henshin arena
Y'all thinking too simple
No don't jinx it
We shall die as martyrs then
We can finally get that Revue Starlight X Symphogear collab
AXZ had the most hype visuals, having that training montage and all
I'd welcome more ominous visuals considering this is the final season
OPs and EDs are typically in the 2nd ep
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
never
So
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
It has that nostalgic feel to it
Hibiki's B-song honestly reminds me of an old, sad Vocaloid song
if we're going by CD releases
Probably Kirika
2 more days <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
Though I'm still looking through the season, so there might be some good stuff aside from XV
Dumbbell is just my motivation to workout, ever since I read it way back
Geah is my main fix
But aside from that
Dumbbell is great
I know that feel
They have to make up for their lack of numbers somehow <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Kanade
Still Kanaded
Get into music creation and do it yourself <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
so every anime season then <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
7.3 hours in total thus far
I look forward to slowly amassing my Ultimate Geah playlist
Hell yeah
Are in orbit
My sides
To just generic Symphogear 1, Symphogear 2,  etc
And all the Seasons got their titles changed
Oh man I just looked up XV on Kissanime
At least he didn't add the possibility of her going splat
Kirika and Shirabe are probably just playing baseball
"The Light that Lives Here and Now" ~~is that a death flag~~
While not as bombastic as the GX or AXZ, the fact that they're actually struggling makes it for me
Really, are any of us are?
Do XV shitposts go here or the live-shitposting chanel
Imagine being cute while being metal as hell
Kyoushitsu Monochrome [Ignite]
*God please play Chris' B-track this season*
With SOL singing in-between
rip Bridge Bunnies
Oh man
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>  please no
Emojis aside. 
We're a day away from episode 2 now. <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
it's 11 30 and my brain can't follow this conversation
~~at least people talk to you~~
I can imagine it having at least one somber scene of Miku and Hibiki enjoying their peaceful lives ~~while it lasts~~
The thought of being able to gaze upon the visuals of Symphogear's 5th opening is making sleep difficult
I will never forget Signal Flare Man, for sure
~~too bad anyone that doesn't have a name is considered Guardsmen-level expendable by SONG~~
Genjuuro losing his bridge crew would be rough
Their deaths weren't even instantaneous
12 hours till episode 2 <:Germain:421434126856486912>
No one has caught on the fact that things go wrong whenever a concert goes on
It's Secret Agent Maria from the OVAs
**I was enjoying the gay, then suddenly traffic jam, followed by actual jam everywhere**
**What just happened**
but I approve
Lewd
*umph*
is just
Maria in a suit
Man
I wanna pinch their cheeks dammit
while wearing scarves
I can't get over how damn cute everyone is
makes sense for a marksman
consistently
High marks
Chris getting into college
Chris and her birthday
Chris speaking with her parents
Honestly this episode brings so many conflicting feelings
Goddamn vampires and their obsession with cherry donuts
JAM
holy shit
Seeing people getting mauled and cut in half before disintegrating
the lewd is just a side dish
I don't know about you guys, but I was more impressed with Shirabe's yo yo skills
I probably won't be able to sleep tonight after what happened ~~the same probably goes for Tsubasa~~
can escape his crap
Not even Genjubro
Something something shame to the family
At the same time, my tetraphobia is going off by Chris having the 4th henshin this season
But I need that Shirabe henshin first
*heavy breathing*
and all it can do is bite, and bite hard
They're like a rat that's been backed into a corner
The Illuminati actually feels threatening now lol
Vampires and hypnotism go hand in hand
I don't like where this is going
Chris' parents
Serena
All the focus on dead characters in the opening
is by having the last Swan Song
The only satisfying way I'd see Tsubasa going out
The holy corpse is gone, but its conscious could be within the bracer
God's about to catch those hands
everywhere
Noise
and then
Imagine getting hyped to see that the solo live you went to turned into an amazing duet
~~right?~~
I'm sure it'll tone down in the middle of the show
In the end, the relatively safety of the previous concerts were just to lull us into a false sense of security
that went to shit behind the scenes
Well there was GX
thought that was before the entire stadium got bombarded
There's possibly some civilians left
best match
Vampires and donuts
YO YO MASTER
Shirabe just dancing around
in the darkness
the pink light
like
The animation on Shirabe's dance-esque attacks are bloody amazing though
As a recent college drop-out, Chris... <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I always expect Chris suffering, but with how XV is going, I'm scared for what they could have in store for her
then *wham*
They bait us with cutesy SOL scenes
Light just makes the darkness all the more apparent
is in a right shape at the moment
I don't think anyone
I can't even enjoy the action because this was straight up a disaster movie
oh god
instead of just focusing only on the Noise
Seeing the actual panic
I don't even anymore
It's been a while since SONG has had to deal with such a body count
WE'RE NOT EVEN ON RAILS
But I can't get the seatbelt off
I want off this crazy train
I don't know, at this point I'm going <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
aside from fucking up the concert
and it looked like that it was her main objective
that was suspicious as hell
She did some weird eye thing in that fight
killing all the important figures
Tsubasa just brings havoc to SONG
the moment she hears the key phrases
Tsubasa is now the Winter Solider
Oh god there's so many things that I wanna see get cut in half by Ame-no-Habakiri at this point
Shimapan
**Maybe she'll actually fire Red Hot Blaze**
Chris has a revolver now, so that's one new toy she has
I want to appreciate these Rebuild designs since they just look good
but this is the final act
I liked Ignite
No more upgrades please
that's Geah levels of insanity right there
like
Nekomimi fights with a suitcase
13 episodes *could* be fine depending on how they pace things
to cope with this episode
I need something
*hah*
There's no light in her at the moment for sure
Let's not even get into her Bunny Bride Outfit
it's useless
The studio already lewds here
I remember some banana noise during AXZ's opening
Either that, or they weren't as prominent as the others during the slaughter
I don't think we did
did we have any banana noise here?
I just realized
Goddamn
in this one attack
7 or so of em
They unleashed like
Goddamn, that gigantic drill noise that appeared once in AXZ?
If these are the cards they're playing, then so be it
Only *dess*
No redemptions here please
Cat girl seems pretty infatuated with Vanessa
The Noise attack in episode 5-6 was pretty bad
Eh, not really
Uhuh
be mindful of the spilled jam
we got plenty of seats
Join the pain train
Nope. I ain't looking at the episode titles now. **Nope**
German is cool
Oh god the 00 movie please no
Turns out God loved Fine, but he wanted to focus on his *gains* more than anything
~~so Machio from Dumbbells~~
of a god
but with the body
Bishounen face
but we don't know his side of the story
I would blame god
Language, I think
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
now they're back
and buy some jam
The writers had to go to the store
the sheer amount of civilians overwhelmed even him
he was more worried about the civilians than himself
he should be fine
Ogawa is a ninja
MaMaria probably already has her hands full with this sword
>Ver having any spawn
Hibiki is a Primarch, at best
to this
From complaining about the cold in episode 1
Top notch debut right there
The SOL scenes understandably didn't look as good as the action scenes
gotta have edge in the right places <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
She's a sword
This channel has been a ride for the past few hours
CarolNein duet would be pretty sick, not gonna lie
post her music online as Mana Nizuki
Tsubasa should take up being a Virtual Youtuber
like season 1
I was thinking of Hibiki just hopping there
Couldn't even assist the idol he's in charge of
and feels disgraced for it
Or he saved no one
I set myself up for that one
Nothing that happened was fine
This episode is too much
help
I can't sleep
It's 6 AM
The Two in One Alchemist
shitposting about Symphogear 6 30 in the morning is not how I expected my life to go
it's time to *sleep* for me <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
I can't sleep, sunrise is imminent, so I wanted to add some levity to this entire situation
I wake up a couple hours earlier and people are still screaming <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
"hah, I love these two girls and I hope nothing bad happen- oh god oh fuck oh shi-"
It's to lull us into a false sense of security
DMJii has always been l00d
You know damn well they will
just pure emotion
no finesse or technique
Not gonna lie, seeing Tsubasa clumsily swing her sword is just wrong
Someone get Tsubasa a hug
Chris first and forever
This thread has been filled with screaming for the past few hours and I love it
Welcome to the pain train<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
inb4 Miku was the one that showed her the ropes
Shirabe: <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
after Maria used Gungnir
GX had a bit
From the subreddit
What else can they do with Maria and Serena at this point, I wonder
All the potential hazards
Imagine if it was
Stahp
Yo
That terrifies me
As someone who lives in a country where the buildings barrly above 10 floors
Independence Day occurred but it only lasted for like a day
It's just that recent events have pretty much overshadowed everything
I care <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But I had to
I feel bad for making that GTA meme
The Concert Connumdrum was an inside job
Of what fate has in store for her
Completely unaware
Look at her

A small price to pay for salvation
Welcome to Symphogear, kid <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Okay this is getting weird
It doesn't like you either
When you spill the ketchup packet
being Geah is suffering
It's incredible that one episode can incite so many different feelings
And ran on the water
He probably leapt out
WAGA MAOU
To a whole nother level on episode 2
Batgril went from complaining about the cold (kinda cute thh) in episode 1
Maybe several
Batgirl definitely needs a sword through her
Sasuga Kerrik
Vampires
Bat
"from the bat" ... Is that a pun?
How would they translate <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
They day we get dubbed geah is the day I fear
~~i came here for Geah dammit~~
~~that comment section scares me, I don't even watch MHA~~
Fine English sounds fine, not gonna lie
Revue Starlight bothered me with it's switching between Japanese and English when it went from talking to singing
How would a dub even work
Oh boy that comment section is a doozy
Something something shamful to the family
The thousand civilians really didn't do any favor for focus
They probably wouldn't have attacked of all 6 were there
~~inb4 onee-san~~
Miku didn't wave any flags this episode
I'm sure nothing bad will happen to HibiMiku
Oh god my tetraphobia is acting up again
One is punchy Aoi
One is moe Aoi
"hibiki become geah"
lewd
I joined because of all the buzz around Golden Hibiki
The hype ability of Geah is insane
<:Germain:421434126856486912> This is the power of Geah
inb4 the V-Cinemas ain't canon
~~but half of me wants it to be Hibiki's B-song~~
Tradition says a song that screams finale ala First Love Song
Yeah, no, I can't wrap my head around that
F(A)Ine
If you watch the opening backwards, it tells the story of three alchemists who gave up their plans of destruction and went on to live peaceful lives while watching over the girls that talked them out of their destructive paths
I'll be legit mad if they try any redemptions though
Metanoia has yet to top Testament for me, but it'll give it time to grow on me
It's strange, considering the openings never showed *too* much
At this point, I'm hoping they have more than just gold bikki in store for us
She's been getting older
Kinda
that opening doesn't tell much
Aside from that one new form
might as well have fun with it
It's their daily routine
Hibiki_fucking_dies.jpg
Love my Tsun
The wait is gonna kill me
~~I wanted my Chris birthday scene~~ <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
this is something I can get behind
The things you do for love
*Lightning Sonic*
lmao
The third one is Mach
straight out of Fourze
A rocket-powered kick
b-but the yoyos are cool
HibiKirika God of Dess
Same thing applies to the AXZ Faust Robes, I suppose
Ah, right
Gotta admit. She's cute, but considering I thought the same of batgirl in episode 1, I'll withhold my judgement until we get more episodes.
Wolfgirl
How old is she even
or Hellsing Ultimate
is this Symphogear
around a werewolf
dancing left and right
Glowing wires flying around
for paw print headsets
the Illuminate possibly gave funding
like
I can't get over those headsets
This is exactly the kind of conversation I like to see at midnight
run by local instructor Cags
Alchemist plug training
unless people think you're just a cosplayer
Stalking as a wolf girl or vampire sounds pretty hard
but this one tops it for me
I liked Seiten Galaxy Cross
The concert was absolute fire
[YABEI]
"this baby can hold so much divine power"
and slap it on Miku
The alchemists just take the bracer
Miku, put that down
~~time to shill~~
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
I saw that
Vampire girl fucks people up instead
Time to grab it before it gets nuked by Kingu Rekordo
tomato
something something
Maria trips but puts on a brave face
Killing everyone out of spite
And it ain't on rails either
This suffering train has no breaks
to the next 11 weeks
I look forward
And we're only in episode 2
We still got jam tho
2 episodes left for Chris
2 episodes
~~Didn't expect to talk about D&D in a Geah discord but alright~~
That's a good DM thought process
At some point I just abandoned writing and wrote a henshin hero class for DND 5E
~~most of my work is shite anyway~~
It's been so long since I wrote
Summoning a BFS is wack
Like, Tsubasa has the most Chad Rider Kick with Heaven's Wrath
Or something
Must be Kanade
It's red
FOURZE
oof
inb4 Kanade appears in her nightmares to assist her
and its underboob
Nothing tops that terrible Nehustan armor
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
like AXZ
Chris needs the dakka
Oh god please no more jiggles
It's iconic
I don't actually want it
It was just a joke
No CyVer pls
Oh god
~~right?~~
I'm sure they won't
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Choo choo here comes the suffering train
Sounds like a good idea then <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Would it be annoying if it was a song dedicated to Tsubasa?
Not having 'English' for the American scenes again
That was a missed opportunity
All this talk of Americans being prominent to the plot again and y'all ain't mentioning the possibility of them bringing back Fine-level English back for the final season
TK from Angel Beats?
Sooooo
~~and fantasizing that it's Chris singing them~~
I say that having several of her songs
Ayahi's English is pretty good
~~what just happened in the past half hour~~
But today is not that day, it seems
~~the only girl that Adam ever attracted was a thot that didn't even have a hole ayyyy lmao~~
~~Warframe Nightwave makes me wanna die tbh~~
with Elfnein's moe voice
so we get Carol's personality
Carol and Elfnein sharing the same body
about Ver coming back as an AI
It's a gag
~~I just wanna hear Elfnein sing dammit~~
While I think CyVer is a joke, CarolNein is something half of me actually wants
but a commander?
I wouldn't mind Hibiki being SONG's combat instructor
~~guys, this is xv discussion~~
A true tragedy
~~oh god I have so much Chris merch and she's all over my wallpapers~~
~~or just the Stockholm Syndrome kicking in~~
is a good sign
imo The fact that I can pick this franchise apart and still get hyped over it
Probably something related to the fact that she was Fine's next body
~~I will screenshot this comment for future uses~~
Mill-arc or Mil-larc?
How do you pronounce Millarc tho
Hibiki got traffic jam while Tsubasa got strawberry jam
I wouldn't mind seeing Hibiki fist Kyubey so hard it kills all his copies
Kyubey would be rolling in suffering
or masked heroes
be it magical girls
Blue swords-wielders have it hard
*CarolNein*
I said it once, and I'll say it again
Hence, I can understand why they didn't expect an attack right there
Strategically, the Alchemists would have no reason to attack since nothing important was at the stadium
Seriously, the more I look at Eliza, it's like seeing a cosplayer that's carrying around a suitcase full of merch they just bought at a convention
I like em so far
Furry cosplayer
Batgirl
and her having freaky expressions in battle
The biggest character trait was her constantly staring every sentence with the word "basically"
~~please don't remind me of that~~
sometimes all you need are people to hang around with
Chris just needs friends imo
So a perfect fit then?
especially in episode 1 when she was just freezing her ass off
I used to think she was cute
Yeah
wack
but bat girl is just
Eliza seems *kinda* neutral
Batgirl kidnaps Miku
Can't wait for batgirl emojis tbh <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I'm not surprised something like that got more attention than the concert
It's r/anime
The thought of Symphogear getting more attention pleases me
but this is a whole new level
The concert clip got some attention
lol that r/anime thread exploded what the hell
The equivalent of drunk talking
Oh man that looks like an emoticon
Two, if we counting XD
Imagine watching Symphogear and not thinking Miku is gay
~~inb4 Sonya and Stephan come back just to die~~
oh boy i sure can't wait for what they have in store for something as grand as the final season
They need to reach their seasonal Chris suffering quota
YABEI
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
Listening to Kiri's A-track, I just love that finger *snap*(?) noise at 2:03. Why is this song so good
Is this gonna be a reoccurring thing with the B-tracks <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Her B-track sounds kinda sad though
<:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
yo Kirika's A-track is fire
Over her knee
She breaks Batgirl in half
Get gains
It's how Tsubasa gets out of her funk
For pole work
Gotta work on that core strength
I saw it in sfw I think
MariAbs when
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Oh man
Imagije Hibiki bench pressing some weights
"My friend saw Hibiki in the shower once. She said she had a six pack. Hibiki Tachibana is ripped"
Susanoo? The Persona or Mobile Suit? <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Thighs
Kirika's
It took me hours to process
Yeah, I did
And Zenboobs Dallas after
Can't wait for YoYo Master next week
Damn right
-100 to Sanity
And despair
Gaze upon its form
With the spinning she does
Tsubasa must have some killer legs
Saved
I ain't gonna explain shit
It's Phonic Gain
Holy shit
~~ayo dess flag~~
More shots of Miku in general
~~Yes~~
~~I feel irrationally worried about the future~~
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Oi
Oi
The girl seems to be efficient in all subjects
Makes me wonder what Chris intends to take in college
Thinking about grades
And Miku
She smart
I wonder
How much farther will XV go
In light of ep 2
Speaking of brutality
A lot harder irl
Like Hibiki did to Chris
Doing the whole defeat = friendship thing
At least most of Ryuki's cast were assholes
No pesky conscious when fighting mindless hordes
And the trauma
Especially with the secrecy
But yeah, being a hero is hard
14 weeks of Geah generating this much hype is amazing indeef
Sounds rad asf
Dying as a henshin hero
Thh
I would too
Shirabe probably helps Kiri
~~end me~~
~~hahahahaha~~
At least Hibiki ain't blowing it all on worthless merch
What's left of it anyway
Tsubasa prob gets paid well from her idol career
Shrine being Canon is sweet stuff
First season or second
I think the OVA had them getting their paycheck
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
This is the only Discord server I'm on
wisely
You have chosen
Excellent
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330> Pick your answer carefully <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
The cd release probably got hit by the Noise attack too
Because it is the truth
not a sex offender
But Ogawa is a bro
Funny enough, the MC in that shares his voice with Ogawa
Death probably thinks she's too cute to die tbh
Just pure tranquil fury
Bikki going Zerk *without* needing the red eyes would be a nice change
What's next, Chris shooting an innocent bystander by accident? Hahahaha ~~fuck~~
dear god we're only 2 episodes into XV
or 1 week
2 weeks
less GX and more AXZ
i want my dakka henshin pls
oh god the chris lewds
Lewd Kiri henshin? 7000
Action scene with DMJii? 100 votes
We found the code bois
is Kiri's henshin
and the one thing that explodes with attention
There's so much Geah on r/anime
I don't know
~~we're doomed~~
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
My brain would overload
Oh man
Unless we get two henshins in one episode like GX
But no Shirabe henshin
The Symphogears sing to attract the attention of the Noise
It's big brain time
You're on to something <@185949743321579520>
in 1-2 weeks
see how well it ages
Gonna save this discussion
dess
I shall now lash myself for uttering such words
~~and poledance on it~~
I want a henshin to make Gundam Heavyarms Customs look tame
lewds
Before
Me: No fear
After reading this thread
Me: **One fear**
They're probably gonna do a duet when Eliza decides to go all-out
Well, it always is the case for those two
In a nutshell, it's a gonna be a season of suffering, therefore it's reflected in the opening itself
But Testament is still the best one for workout
I'll give a couple weeks to grow on me
distract you from that
Then again, it's hard to notice when the events just kinda
Had a feeling that was the case
Anyone else realized that batgirl's arm was immediately clean right after she jammed Donut Girl
~~but we got a couple of months till the series finishes, so maybe they'll chance their minds~~
I believe the animator said it wasn't possible
Oh god this is how it leads to Commander Kazanari
Genjuuro being team dad needs to brought back
considering he was also present in the first concert massacre
Genjuuro needs to step in
or something
True Divine Hibiki
Otherwise, you end up steering towards Grimdark
Stories that attempt to be dark without striking some sort of balance tend to falter
Darkness just makes the light all the more apparent, and vice-versa
Hence, low-key sellers
who just makes them for fun
who's never been in the tragedies
but there's probably some morbid guy with a 3d printer
I can't really it compare to how military vehicles are made into model kits
Hmmm
Would've made batgirl's entry a lot less impressive if they laid it thick
to the second half being DEATH
Yeah, I think I like the whiplash of the first half being DESS
does that count?
I choked
Kiss or riot
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1caE-KFGdKRha_DAYCNKNVIsJKAQ26iNx

ship wars
And this is also something I enjoy
people screaming about Symphogear
This is what I enjoy
Yes
It would be perfection
*tosses out horriblesubs episode*
Noice
probably
is a typical thing in the fandom
Confusion about Symphogear
thinking we were getting more experiments
I legit had a heart attack
for implied attempts at growing fruit in the form of killer monsters
Banana farmers would be targeted
in the Symphogear world
Europe in deep shit
Isn't like
This is a pleasant conversation
Problem solved
Bam
Buttplug Furry
It's too good
I'm not ready for Kimi Dake Ni to be played within the show
The pain train is always eager for more passengers
"This wasn't what I meant when I wanted your sword"
Oh noes
~~so we can get another popular post on r/anime to draw more attention to Symphogear~~
how lewd will it be
Now for the real question
Move over, Mista
this is the real gunslinger of 2019
Revolver action
Yo
Phara felt it
It was literal fire
~~FMP Season 5 when~~
Neither of her Gears didn't even begin with her to start with soooo
That sword whip gives me flashbacks to Bloodborne and I love it
Maybe something to do with her sword whip
~~trips and falls~~
I can live with that
~~no lewds pls~~
Multiple 'bangs'
Multiple finger guns
~~Shirabe~~ Yo Yo Master
Love is literally the solution
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
being geah is suffering
~~this was all a long ploy to make HibiTsuba canon~~
Back to the original pair, eh
It's great, isn't it
We gotta go deeper
with everything else forming from it
causing her gauntlet to appear on impact
is Maria doing a superhero landing into her henshin arena
So far, the coolest thing I can come up with
They should've brought back the cape
There is that Satellite Cannon she uses from time to time on her arm
That wasn't very cash money of you
Milaarc: *I'm about to end this whole girl's career*
~~not gonna lie I still think Millarc is kinda hot~~
JoJo
Monogatari
now Symphogear
Vampire and donuts
~~cause they did BanaNoise dirty by not inviting him to this party~~
Do Noise lives suddenly matter now?
and I'm already losing it
By tomorrow we'll only be roughly 1/4th into this crazy train ride
I know dread for what's in store next
Ever since episode 2
inb4 the fandom raises funds to put a hamster with a boxing glove on the moon
Chris, *"Fastest gun in the West"*
Still waiting for the Geahs to just shoot those escape tools one day
Oh hey, the BanaNoise is back
It's YamateTomete
It's the little things like this that crack me up



Sometimes the souls still linger afterwards
Open it during an episode's release, you hear the screaming of a thousand souls
This channel is like Pandora's Box
Inb4 we get Noise with sunglasses swords
~~sounds like doujin dialogue~~
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
It's canon that Carol wants to pose to look cool
Awesome
On top of a cardboard box
That means SG made a speech
*it's silence time*
Don't do this to me
Revolver Chris Hyyyyyyyype <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
The madlad
~~rip I ain't sleeping till 6 AM again cause hype~~
2 henshins in one episode
But goddamn
Not even 24 hours ago, goddamit Symphogear
I swear to god, I was *just* complaining about this and we finally get it
It's 3 AM
Jesus
I audibly screamed
Chris firing Red Hot Blaze gave me more satisfaction than most romance animes
We're only 3 episodes into this train and I want off
dear god help
I can't stop fucking shaking in my seat right now
it's become a parade now
So many flags
His defeat better be the biggest "Fuck you, Dad"
God, I thought Fudo had a stick up his ass before
It's just Geah now
It's 3 AM and my thoughts aren't coherent
I don't know
We predicted the future
We did it <@185949743321579520>
FUCKING BUZZSAW SLINGSHOT
I love them so much
Kirika and Shirabe have been constantly been pulling out nonstop combi attacks
Can't wait to rewatch the episode with YT. Dialogue subs being the same as song subs always screw with my mind.
I can't even
I LOVE IT
THE FUCK
SEGWAY NOISE
Like
Segway Noise is the last thing I expected
She's definitely thirsty alright
Batgirl crying gives me a sadistic sense of joy
*aren't we all*
At least Bikki's parents get mentioned lol
you could call it Kadingir II
He has a stick so far up his arse
GENJUURO GOD PLEASE FIST THIS GUY TO OBLIVION
*I'm not ready*
God, if RHB gets fired, then they really intend to wrap up a lot of stuff
~~help~~
I legit thought that
When I saw those  lyrics
I want her to shoot me
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
I can't even right now
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
ISN'T THE NEXT EPISODE THE ONE AOI YUUKI SAYS IS GONNA BE SAD
compared to GX
at least
but it wasn't *that* lewd
I expected lewd
the holy Chart
The Chart
sasuga Geah fandom
It's almost been a few hours and here comes the edits
Batgirl wants to rerorero
no other anime feels necessary ~~except maybe Dumbbell~~
I don't even know what's going on anymore
How the fuck is she so cute
Before Chris absorbed it lul
Since it's Hibiki, I doubted it working on her that easily
Batgirl's Geass seems to only work when someone is at the point of breaking
~~Oh god it's 4 AM why does time fly whenever I talk about Geah~~
It's a shitty meme, don't mind my degeneracy
I shall now jump off a building as well
~~"Maria, I'm trying to deal with the deaths of 70000 people, but I'm dummy thicc and the clap of my ass cheeks is making my dad scold me"~~
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Yeah, I think I shall be using this as a response picture now
*inelegant blubbering*
HOW CAN A MORTAL MAKES SUCH CUTE NOISES GODDAMN
she is so precious
Fire Emblem *and* Symphogear XV
I'm not ready for next week
~~I mean oversized oppais are pretty common in fanart so you can look there for something similar~~
a normal man's mind
that would break
Don't ask questions
Yo
I would've been mad tbh
If she didn't
YES
Shira's henshin was great
While Chris is best girl in my heart
All the salt about being beaten
Batgirl crying is great tho
No one liked Fudo in the first place
would be kinda hilarious
Fudo being ripped underneath all that
You can still be a villain and care about family though
I love it when the XV channel is just screaming
"I think Chris' henshin and song will be in episode 4"
*shows in episode 3*
"Fuck me, I love Symphogear"
BLAZE
HOT
RED
sucks up your time and energy
Having work sucks
My friend is still in the middle of GX lol
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
until I found this Discord, that is
It's saddening
I only have one person to talk to about Symphogear
I love Zenbu and Yo Yo Master so I could die right now tbh
they're flexing at this point
2 henshins in one episode
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Because Chris is perfection
yes
my ears
Oh god
The chink chink chink when those bullets went into the chambers
Vanessa's pose is killing me help I can't even right now
~~dear god it's 4 AM, I'm full of hype, hungry as hell and i need sleep~~
My thought process is a mess
I don't know
Gynoid is basically a fembot like Ghost in the Shell
*big brain time*
or whatever
or gynoid
or cyborg
it's something to do with her being a robot
Or maybe
I thought it was that at first lol
telepathy
Cause Geah has like
Noble Red
Right after she says
Okay yeah I saw that animation error
Timestamp please
God helps this soul
but not a single soul talking about Geah
Everyone in my D&D group be hyping about the seasonal anime
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
In my day, action scenes were filled with recycled footage up the wazoo
inb4 Vanessa has a voice box that sometimes isn't in sync with her lips
doubt they really thought ~~about years anyway~~ <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
straight out of Mazinger Z
she has a rocket punch
might as well reference the famous Aphrodite
we have so many mecha references
Might as well
*XD is canon*
*Multiverse*
<@238855496797257729>  She's Y-posing. Damn Illuminati and their advance tactics.
shock.jpg
is working with the baddies
the asshole
Oh no
stahp
~~god it's 5 AM and i'm going crazy~~
RED RIDING HOOD JUST SNIPED THE BIG BAD WOLF
I JUST REALIZED
YO
Maria has a Satellite Canon yo
Now I'm worried Basa is a sleeper agent or something
The whole Geass thing with Basa still worries me
Went from kawaii ugu to kill-on-sight in an instant
kinda wack
Not gonna lie, buttplug furry getting all tense when she detected them
is this even real
is
my sides are still in orbit
Segway Noises
so much going on
It's so dense
my tetraphobia
oh god it's 4 44 AM
the Holy Chart
The Chart
Yes
Oh god it's gonna be next ep when he founds out, isn't it
~~i wanna be underneath that~~
Not gonna lie, I still love the stomping in Bikki's henshin
Pure, solid bullets
needs more dakka, for sure
it's too cute
I just can't
the 'bang' really fucks up my ranking though
Needed to go a bit slower with Chris
or the afternoon
I'll probably decide in the morning
*cough* Kiri *cough*
I can tell different people worked on them
They're all good
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
but I'd legit watch that
You joke
now she faces karma
She shot Tsubasa in the head before
Chris pls
inb4 Hibiki and Miku punch a country-sized Fudo with a heart-shaped projectile
Fuck yeah
the hype, shitposts and discussion
this is why I stay up all morning for Geah
subarashi chart
Tsubasa, "Henshin"
Ame no Habakiri "ERROR"
oof
and punch Fudo at some point
MaMaria needs to step in
aye
kinda cute
Shirabe moving down her headset pieces
Yo we're getting too deep with the theories
and he rolls with it
all the time
and he just clicks it by accident
Or maybe the power switch is right next to his call button
god he's such a prick
yes pls
I'm not even mad
Guns and boobs
she managed to up her AXZ henshin
Yo Yo Master
i'm going to bed
hype is settling down
yep screw it
oh god it's 5 AM
can't damage the costumes lul
Japanese live action shows, like Godzilla/Kamen Rider
if this was a Tokusatsu, the Geahs would just be rolling around with sparks flying every time they get hit
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
I will not stand this slander against my daughterus
The Geahs are tough girls
not zetsubou
i need kibo
stahp
have we not already seen enough suffering
45 seconds
~~no not the lewd details~~
should've given more time to appreciate the details
and needed to be slower
It needed more dakka
a silver side-car
Tsubasa needs a side-car for her bike tbh
He has a son that could be considered the peak of physical fitness
Fist fights Genjuuro
Gets ripped asf
Fudo absorbs divine power
Would probably kick a puppy if it's for the glory of Nippon
Topdad probably does the whole "end justifies the means" thing
All these callbacks just emphasize that this is gonna be the final season <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
~~i know want art of Chris in a Zeon uniform~~
would inevitably lead to asteroid drops
and ascension to Sazabi
She's already Gundam Heavyarms
and how it slowly panned over her as she transformed
Like Hibiki's
The movements were great, but the camerawork could've been better
It took me a while to notice what they were doing with Chris in some shots
Something something magic is just advanced science something something
It's a historical moment
God
I need that CD release
Good stuff
And the emphasis on the lyrics
Those shots
And the whole bloodline shcitck
He was how we found out about Tsubasa's parents
Yep
Get fucked, old man
'failure'
Probably a sleeper agent thing
Tsubasa's suffering as well
HibiMiku still have plenty of time to ~~suffer~~ shine
we're only 3/13 into this crazy ride
It could still be
Miku be waving so many flags that I can hear the writers cackling in the distance
It could be living within the amulet
Vanessa is a human-sized Mazinger
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
~~can you imagine the feeling of Chris' revolvers emptying the contents of your skull~~
because of it
Many were screaming last night
Yes
Inb4 this is how Cags and Prelati got their perfect bodies
And Chris shooting Tsubasa in the back
i dun like it
It's my first time experiencing it
Weekly Symphogear is bloody nightmare
7 day-wait again <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
everything seems too convenient for Tsubasa (when it comes to what Bat Girl did) at the moment
I'm already losing my mind in these 3 eps
I am dreading episode 4
He wore extra warm underpants for starters <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
XV is EndGeah
AXZ was Gekkisho Infinity War
Imagine hating your daughter's singing so much you stage a terror attack on her concert
It's the craze nowadays
Tsubasa should take up Virtual Youtubing
Depends on the language they're speaking really
On a spiritual level
It speaks to me
I need that Chris image
Goddamit Maria
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
We're getting too deep with these theories lol
Fudo, 'For the glory of your country- I mean loved one"
The Kazanari bloodline is already wack as it is
yo stop
Need to set up hope before you crush it after all
I'm gonna cry when it's all over
Saturday has become Scream Night
Before, YouTube was the only way to watch anime online <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
YT for rewatching
Horrible subs for quick Geah fix
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Genjuuro is everyone's dad anyway
~~are they gonna bring back the shrine priest from AXZ tho~~
Oof
About as relevant as Miku's parents
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
Or they wanted to break out the Segway Noises for the first time
Batgirl got a taste of <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Elfnein is now the hard boiled Alchemist in my eyes
~~then Carol disappears for good in the finale, leaving Elfnein crying~~
YES
CarolNein
The Two In One Alchemist
~~as well as Carol's attitude with Elfnein's moe voice~~
thus, we get two consciousness in one body
Carol existing within Elfnein's body
I still hold my CarolNein theory
Let's just hope Fudou literally doesn't get under someone's skin
For fuck's sake
~~they lost but it was a fucking fun campaign~~
~~I outright had my party outfitted with Geahs and had them fought the Infinity Stones~~
I've been there <@106861977086779392>  lol
if she hit the FIS with it back in G
I wonder what would've happened
Looking at Red Hot Blaze
BLAZE
HOT
RED
*shivers*
never four
Five guns or three guns
red riding hood
meet
Big bad wolf
~~probably because I played Bayonnetta~~
I, for one, love Chris' confidence with her body
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
kanade butt
This is a no-ara ara zone
It's ketchup, man
Ketchup
mazinger alchemist
buttplug furry
Their B-team is batgirl
but she's wack
not gonna lie
She's cute
it would be so moe
But with Elfnein's voice
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Being DM is suffering
<@440138597539119114>  I'm feeling personally attacked right now
Oof
~~D&D parties are always dumb and that's the best part about D&D~~
to the satisfying pews of her crossbows
from the heavy chunk of her miniguns
Chris' guns always sound great
fucking unreadable
The drink label would be in the same font as Kirika's attacks
and I don't even watch streamers
to an unhealthy degree
I'd watch Chris
Yeah
then gets back up
gets upset each time she dies
Maria probably plays Dark Souls
Luckily Kiri and Shira were there so things didn't get too bad
There was art of Chris playing that
Tsubasa plays For Honor
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
I want to listen to Kiri crying each time she dies
fucking wow
2045 Fortnite
Fuck you dad
Fu dad
Fu dou
Fudou
*Vacate the premises*
I still can't get over the Illuminati Y-posing on everyone
also now that Meta is done
Can't wait for the biggest "Fuck you, Dad" in the franchise
are weaksauce
meanwhile the Alchemist cosplay group
cause they were pretty strong
It kinda helps that SG and co didn't have to worry about losing
hated Adam
they just
SG were pretty chill with each other though
who I shipped with the character my names comes from
she shares a voice with my childhood waifu
I have a bias for Shirabe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chpmONLYjzQ&list=FLVB23e9i6PnQb3B9LC8PvKQ&index=8&t=0s
YOYO MASTER
That's some good stuff
Maria has fed Basa
two onee-sans
Basa has like
*dozens*
*We have dozens of fanart*
<@141531216200466432>  I stand by you on this ship
and lots of hugs
and friends
Chris just needs food
what's gonna happen
Makes me worried
These two have been rather happy the past few eps tho
~~so are the rule 34~~
DMJii is great
Kombini food
Dess
Shirabe
*quietly saves everything*
that would be fun
Kanade and Cags
Oof
Shirabe be feeling those strong thighs
chad kanade
I would've loved to see how they would interact
Chris and Kanade
being cool and all
Besides
What would Kanade even do though
Serena is jealous Maria found new sisters to take care of
It's why Eliza is being billed against DMJii
~~it's 10 PM, so it's *that* time of the day for me~~ <:Ver:336656981144109066>
*hence Serena's presence in the opening*
*Eliza was made with the remains of Serena*
*big brain time*
Oh god
this picture is hilarious
Out of context
Like the bullets being loaded into the revolver
Chris needed more metallic sounds
2 hours plus from the sub release
A couple minutes from raw release
But DMJii don't play
BanaNoise were awesome
SEGWAY NOISE
You're forgetting
Oh hey someone joined Papa Fudo's Crazy Ride
Headpats should work fine
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
gottem
lol
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Shhhh
making contact with your sternum
Imagine the feeling of those fists
fuck, she is pointy
even if doing so may end up with stab wounds
I just hug my Chris nendo
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
The madman
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
~~alright I should sleep before I end up talking about Geah until 5-6 AM again~~
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Can't find anything else like it
And I love it
It's a glorious mish mash of a lot of things
But I need more Maria
DMJii have been amazing
~~ayy gottem~~
She never did Tsubasa either
Ayamine is from the future
BD special
They're all still top tier
Good stuff
<:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>
Desstination
Final
This is your
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
for a while
I'm gonna be listening to this
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
HibiMiku had the choice of sleeping in different beds long ago
I'm still on my phone <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
~~i want Shirabe to tie me up now~~
What the fuck
How cursed is it?
I'm on my phone and at a dnd session
*80s trumpet intensifies*
*Anime ja nai*
From humble beginnings
"Hibiki, you know you could-"

"I PUNCH IT"
"Chris, I know you're laying down the firepower and everything, but could you tank for once"
I'll take what I can get lol
>oppai jiggle
>ominous creepy henshin
I didn't know about all these crazy theories and keywords until I joined this discord a month back <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I wake up and see an Eva reference that makes me want to not ever wake up again
B-track is pretty good, too. Though, unlike Bikki and Dess, I'm not sure if I prefer A or B in this case.
A-track is great <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
46% complete <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I'm sure with our combined might, we can gather enough to support the war effort against the Illuminati and the Noise
Your Phonic Gain isn't good enough
Shirabe is so cute it's almost a crime
I love my net
13.2 kb download speed <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Shirabe's my personal favorite out of all the A-tracks shown thus far
God I can't wait
<:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
It's just the twintails, isn't it
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Insightful dialogue
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
This image radiates happi-dess <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
She was busy being salty that Ver said her dreams were nonexistent
Instead of giving him the Disney Villain fall
Carol should've checked for a body
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Carol makes it worth it
It's okay
Or anything with Top Dad
Especially the Chris episode
Going through GX again recently was rough
One during episode one and again in the fight where they got trapped in that dimension.
Yep. AXZ had Hibiki's transformation play twice in the early episodes.
inb4 they repeat another transformation
Suddenly it's Senko-san
But it's good shit
Low effort
Then gave it to her with a note telling her not to blow it up
Everyone probably chipped in
i'm not ready for ep4 <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
and is just like
My drunk-ass is reading all this
Even Vanessa is rocking some clothes that look even better than what SG wore
All of the outfits in XV are on point, really
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
i'm not ready
And ep 4 is gonna be a wham episode
Freaking out over Symphogear usually lasts until 6 in the morning for me
God I should nap before ep 4
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
BEST MATCH
FAUST ROBE
SYMPHOGEAR
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
Just
Just
Hearing Saint Germain sing again
to comprehend everything again
the entire ep
like
I need to rewatch
compared to Hibiki, who outright activated it
They were probably confused just what exactly was going on
Watch him flex and rip through his clothes like Machio from Dumbbell
They outright confirmed Fuudo is packing some heat under that dress
Genjuuro VS Fuudo when
*RabbitRabbit*
*Build intensifies*
when I listen to Kirika and Shirabe say Ready Go
Not gonna lie

getting pulled by the tail
Poor buttplug furry
I will now call Vanessa "Aphrodite"
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
<@185949743321579520>
*I don't like where this is going*
Miku is undefended
Lydian is undefended
If the Geahs have their hands tied now
Sadly, ninjas aren't great at protecting multiple civilian personnel
Ogawa could replace himself with a bloody log right before Shul Shagana could hit him
how to throw hands
Genjuuro needs to show these fools
no way she's *that* weak
Batgirl sliced a man's throat in the same scene
*i'm calling it here*
wuxia movies
He watches
The Kazanari bloodline is fucked, really
Now they could be actually going for it
Fuck's sake, I was just joking about Fudou being strong underneath that dress of his
"THESE MUSCLES HAVE BEEN PASSED DOWN THROUGH THE KAZANARI BLOODLINE FOR GENERATIONS"
one week was all it took after someone called it
literally one week
Boob missiles
Abs that you could grind fucking cheese on
I need Hibiki abs
After Dumbbell
I literally cannot handle this show right now
if they actually do it
much later
CarolNein should be like
we're just in episode 4
Yo
I must pay penance for my sins
My mistake
Vanessa is just Mazinger Z/Aphrodite A as a waifu
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
just
Saint Germain's voice is just
Now I'm just listening to the Alchemist Trio's song agian
Everyone except Bikki, "I have no idea what the heck is going on right now"
Should I bring up my CarolNein ramblings again
elegeant
so
MaMaria
Fudou got some *gains*
when she played with the claw machine
that glorious Hibiki scream again
if it gave us
I wanted Karaoke night
hamster jesus
two seconds
she ate two whole sandwiches in 2 seconds holy shit
Vanessa needs to become Vanessa Kaizer
Batgirl pulling out a fucking batarang is great
as all this happens
down her spine
Miku feels a cold shiver
most of them working on the lower part of the bridge
I think the bridge has at least 10+ people
Genjuuro has plenty of personnel to worry about
I would be doing so many Kamen Rider/Geah shitposts right now
If I could edit in things not MS Paint
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
*boom*
but nah
A minotaur would fit with the whole maiden in a labyrinth thing
*absolute unit*
like the banaNoise in episode 3
don't forget being tied up
Kirika radiates big <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>  energy
Kirika was influencing Chris
like setting a big fire to bring away attention from a robbery
Divert attention off the relic
~~the real monster was the fact that cubes could form a pyramid~~
*This is why the Sin of Balal was created*
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Thankfully I have my anti-sin shades
My eyes
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Shit, you right
Miku probably had some dirty thoughts upon seeing that
You saw how Hibiki ate that sandwhich in 2 seconds
Elfnein is trying best best in that picture <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
They play dirty and I like it (though I doubt they will be weak for the entire show)
Loving Noble Red
Transitioning to that
That long transformation
But shit character all in all
I love his voice actor
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
How hype were you
I had to do a double-take
I remember that term being used for Goblin Slayer
It's so weird seeing him not do that thing with his tie
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
Right from the start
Flags were being waved
ep 1
Someone do a yo yo trick in celebration
Early Chris-mas gift
Oh yes
forever
and keeps it
Maria picks up said sword
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993> "gotta befriend them all"
She's weak to onee-san energy
Hibiki has never shown so much fear before
It's *blazing*
Absolute fire <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
Chris' new A-track is close to topping *Ichaival* for me
Don't give up <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
That is something I can accept <:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
Literally minutes after I go to sleep
A torrent to Chris' song gets posted
Seriously
One For All, All For One is more connected to MhA than the Three Musketeers nowadays <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
*end*
the two then fire a heart-shaped projectile empowered by Phonic Gain, killing what remains of the beast as Fudo controls it
Hibiki monologues about her love for Miku, eventually bringing her out of the beast
Miku becomes a divine kaiju the size of a country
^ this tbh
*"ERROR"*
"Henshin!"
To quote another show about henshin heroes that had Aoi Yuuki
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I'd give 2-3 more episodes
4/13 is still roughly halfway through
Or maybe 1 day <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
An excellent addition to my collection
*saved*
It's finally SymphoSaturday
~~i.e those cute ears~~
It helps that Elsa has enhanced senses to help her with scanning a battlefield
Vanessa seems like the Charismatic one that binds the group together overall
More Saint Germain singing is something I have 0 doubts about loving <:Germain:421434126856486912>
~~it looks kinda cool though~~
I'm not sure what to make of Amalgalm, honestly
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
"Hail Illuminati"
*Tsubasa stabs Genjuuro*
At least we can get a chuckle over the mistakes they make <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Evacuations in Symphogear tend to be pretty good when it doesn't involve concerts
after how many seasons?
Tsubasa got a new attack
Either way
If Elfnein sang Tomorrow, wouldn't she not recognize it due to having Carol's memories?

that occurred right before Ver geahnapped her
with the explosion
Like G
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
The sheer ferocity shown
Tsubasa's expressions made it imo
Emphasis on 'bit'
either that or 'big bro'
A lot of shows/games do that
Localization
right?
that's the brain diving system
So my memory is fuzzy
narrow her eyes and it's like she's ready for GENOCIDE
Elfnein always looks so moe
It's the determination
*please be foreshadowing*
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Hibiki's Kiais and martial arts movement sells Hibiki's for me
I don't Biology
or something
All the blood was rushing to his head when got decapitated
Strawberry jammed
*synchronized Jiiiiii*
*Both* Jiiii shots were amazing
The amount of swords in this one sequence would make Gundam Exia blush
getting screentime all of a sudden and all
I honestly though Yatsuhiro was going to bite the dust this episode honestly
Whenever you work out, remember that a hamster punched a mountain
Ver probably got scrapped off the floor at some point
The segment of them doing their poses as they recite their chants takes a decent amount of time
But goddamn that is hilarious
No I won't say *it*
She has two right hands
First mass murder, and now destruction of public property. Oh the horror.
*must headpat*
More like a gasp for air <:Ver:336656981144109066>
At this rate, someone needs to make a video of all the noises Kirika makes in this season alone
~~Miku gets her arm cut off and gets the arm of Nephilim which is all that remains of meme man~~
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
That's just an easy 5 bucks
"Tsubasa is looking intense cause SONG is still wary of Carol after GX"
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
and making them think Carol lives past GX
Imagine showing this screenshot to someone that's still on GX
While stomping on the ground hard enough to leave small craters
*Multiple* rounds
~~it's how I stay awake till 4-6 AM~~
Indeed
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Hiding in plain sight
Been that way for a long time
nighties
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
I must sleep
But I digress
~~if anything I want more Autoscorer screentime fite me~~
Pacing is one thing, but how they handle it is another
Roughly calculating, at least
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
If all seasons past the first were 2 cour, we'd still be in the midst of GX
Yatsuhiro's probably getting too deep investigating Fudou
if it were to happen, I give it 1-2 episodes
We're about halfway through the season now
Too bad the sword didn't join in
I don't wanna rank the henshin sequences cause I know I'll have to put Chris last <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
And here I was being able to watch Crunchy's Geah vids until today <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Would a ghost's hands feel cold or warm
*please*
Let's not jinx it
Mass riots would ensue if it didn't <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I'm guessing all the blood Millarc gets goes to her thighs
Nothing violent at all
Hibiki was just running over to her with a hot dog and she ended up tripping and spilling her ketchup
Delayed cause sword bulli
4th September iirc
Alchemists don't slouch when creating bodies <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>

I only joined the fandom just two years ago but I will still say that I just got here dammit <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
It feel so short <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
54 days of Geah left
Carol what are you doing
So they sharing bodies or does one consciousness go into the other body while the 2nd body lies unconscious?
It's the loincloth over the crotch
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Immense rage that would make Berserk Bikki look harmless
Hibiki crying is not good civilization
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Oh boy
A status quo ending after 5 seasons
Oh wait
Auchwafen version?
Don't forget
- Madoka ending (both of them ascend to a higher plane of existence)
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
Holy crap really
Probably the latter but it ain't a problem
*dozens*
They are dozens of them
Look at all the ~~Rule 34~~ Bunny Kirika art
i want off this crazy train
~~AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH~~
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVIdYtrI8rU the title sounds like a 90s Mecha anime
So technically halfway if we round down

The 2011 Idolmaster anime's first Opening was called I'm Ready
Shirabe and Kirika have the words "Ready Go" as part of their new song
*It's all connected*
That's the 2nd shaky picture they had I think
A thousand fists will be clenched tomorrow
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
kerrik pls
~~i even do it while driving, but that's probably dangerous so don't do that folks~~
I can't be the only one who brandishes an imaginary katana whenever I hear Tsubasa's songs
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
Fisted harder than a monster in a Tokusatsu show
Whatever was left of Adam showered a city in the form of divine fire
Tomorrow is 6

holy shit
his techniques apply to a fucking car
Also Ogawa is fucking broken as shit
I feel so blessed
I finally get to see it on a cute anime girl
The fucking Dom hover legs
~~mute time~~
It's time to hibernate for those in the East <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I should prepare to hibernate for the next few hours then
How long was the delay again?
I will not stand for Elfnein bulli
Some Manchurian Agent stuff is going on with Tsubasa

I honestly thought that guy was gonna make a lewd comment about Chris ala the plane pilot from AXZ episode 2
Of course Vanessa lost, she's based on Zeonic tech that lost the war lul
her hands being wired guns are pretty much straight out of the Zeong
Vanessa is practically an MS Girl
Rewatching the fight
~~i'm easy to please~~
Had the whole alchemist heart thing
that's an absolute win in my book
No new song, but we got Chris' full henshin sequence at least
Without their tricks, it doesn't take much to beat down N. Red
<@177109369228361728> Phrasing, Jesus
He packed warm underwear
~~fuck you Top Dad~~
The side characters in Geah are great
I didn't even blink
Missile redirection by using making a slide out of a sword whip
~~obligatory CarolNein comment~~
I wonder how long it took to scrape Ver off the ground
Asking how to deal with emotional, blue-haired girls
He probably drinks with Producers from Idolmaster on a daily basis
written all over it
"Just a regular Saturday"
Look at his face
~~new meme format when~~
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Segway Noises were back in all their glory
We got our weekly vehicular destruction by Maria at least

SONG should be glad to have someone like him to deal with espionage, emergency deliveries and idol production
Shinji Ogawa
It's probably not a good idea to speak your evil plans over a phone call
https://youtu.be/cS_O6XACJtA?list=LLVB23e9i6PnQb3B9LC8PvKQ&t=21 More or less this
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
They wouldn't point that out in the first episode if it won't
I'm sure it'll come into play at some point
*What lead to Noble Red's current plans (2019)*
Fuck please no
It's time, brethren
"What are you?!"

"A-An idiot Alchemist..."
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Alright, that's enough excitement for one night. I shall go to bed.

~~yes that's my wallpaper i just used for a meme~~
"The reality that you will never reach"
"Symphogear isn't gay"
I'm gonna wake up to a fuck ton of these edits after a few hours, aren't I
HibiChris, TsuBikki, DMBikki, Hibiria
I find that actually cooler than the Zeong's arms cause solid ammunition has that dakka charm
Vanessa's hands are a combination of the Gouf's Machine Gun fingers and the Zeong's Wired Arms
~~The mecha were sticker nightmares though~~
I still remember them
attempting to justify it
The flame wars over that one scene
Especially *that* scene
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I do not want to be reminded of that show
Be Ogawa
And also blindside you with awesome ninja bullshit
Even when the show slows down, it's more of a breather to let you process the incoming dread
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Ogawa's diligent
Can't just leave it behind
That car was probably company property
Peak superhuman strength + ninjutsu would make him a lightning bruiser of nightmarish proportions
hilariously broken
That would be
Even a crossover would be fine since they introduced that one relic in XD
I think a lot of people have constantly asked for either a Symphogaer Musou or Fighting game at this point
I don't think they'd be willing to put out something that might not roll in profits for something like Symphogear
In a financial sense, I suppose
I can't find the word for it
What's the word
For a franchise like Symphogear, the risk of failure sounds a lot more
~~like all things I come up with when it's midnight~~
Okay that just sounds dumb
Symphogear NEXT Ge(ah)neration
TIL it's not a static picture
Melua that picture is adorable goddamn
It probably goes perfectly with whatever the user words as his desired effect
The Snap affects living thiings
Clones are just illusions
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

what follows after that isn't
Elfnein talking while her cheeks are being pulled is cute
That scene makes me feel so complicated
Fudou : *laughing in Japanese*
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Exactly the way Fudou would want it
Like something straight out of a samurai movie. No special attacks or anything. Just pure blades.
Not gonna lie, one thing that makes me interested in a Geah fight would be seeing the swords clashes between Maria and Tsubasa
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
So the ending of Gundam the 8th MS Team
It's a complicated relationship
had a lot of things I love
Had a lot of things I hate
Somehow I watched the entire thing
The biological wonders of Relics
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
what is going on

Now we're getting in too deep
~~goddamn this weekly wait feels long~~
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Done
Rename episode 6 to episode 7
Go to your Symphogear folder
Credits to <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585> for Maria's new toys
Punished Tsubasa, "YUKINEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
That wasn't a crossover I expected, but I'll take it
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
The revolver was one of the best decisions they made for XV tbh <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
The despair on his face when he got strawberry jammed <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Not if Tsubasa can help it
~~yes~~
Imagine being close friends with someone and not having them as your phone's wallpaper
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
~~yes it's late and my brain cells are on the loose at the moment~~
the rest of the show is just each pairing getting 1-2 episodes dedicated to their ending
The plot is solved 5 minutes into episode 7
How about Episode 7-13
Just Episode 13?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>  <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
~~Being straight is called anti-linker~~
<:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
about wanting to touch the girls directly
Cags and all her dialogue
What was even *with* Carol's loins
So the Nehustan wouldn't kill her
Meanwhile the rest of the Geahs weren't at ground zero of the massacre
~~Maria is too irrelevant compared to Tsubasa to suffer the same things as her~~
That sounds like a complicated away of proposing lewd time
~~Cause I herald the songs of Slaneesh~~
Are we really spreading the word of Chaos in a Symphogear server
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
It's almost SymphoSaturday
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Curse of Balal
The Anti-Bully Squad has arrived
Now it's all cheap 3D arena fighters ~~with the most horrendous case of voice clip spam my ears had to suffer~~
3-4 years ago
which was ummm
think the last one was for Ghost
I can't remember the last time they released a Musou game for Rider
~~*chuckles in Gundam and Kamen Rider*~~ <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
inb4 we get a game but it's a cheap cash-in title by Bandai Namco
The sword has lost it
Someone call the police
Tsubasa's smiling
~~can't believe they decided to spoil the dance party that occurs after Hibiki and Miku's marriage~~
This art is great
Noise attacks have affected CD production
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
~~Nanjo is best~~
funny where life takes you sometimes
and the namesake character is often shipped with a girl that shares her voice with Shirabe of all people
This name comes from an old anime
Funny enough I don't even like ninjas all that much
~~and i love it~~
Despite being a ninja, Ogawa felt like he stole the show with his shinobi bullshit
*Genocide*
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Overtake me
Sinful thoughts
I read make up as make out
Would Maria try to talk again considering Basa smacked her hand away before
Talk? Nah. Curse of Balal is way too prelevant.
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Did someone say Carol
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Torpedo tits
A lot is an understatement
I'm gonna need the big jug for this one
Stay hydrated, y'all
*slaps glass of H2O on table*
'singing' sessions
Ah yes
<@!263983345669505025> Something something Armor Purge
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Maria would probably be the type to undress someone with her eyes
Like
Her imagination would be a lot more risqué, no?
College Chris SOL
Cause college is a hoe
~~a part of me wants to joke about how Airgetlam's real unique feature is **** related purposes but i shall not cross that line~~
She'll show that she carries that silver arm for a reason
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
or my filter broke at some point
This server has either corrupted me
~~okay that sounded way more lewd than i intended~~
just a little sensitive
This sword ain't little

Miku:
SG, "Which streaming service allows me to watch Fullmetal Alchemist again?"
~~Fine's pretty ded sadly~~
fucking fund it now
while munching chips
20 minutes of just her lazing on the couch
*aggressively readies folder*
I heard someone talking about TsubaChri
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>

~~time for silence~~
3 minutes till the Raw arrives
Aunt Chris has arrived to get the fun started
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
HOLY SHIT
I FELL ASLEEP
FUCK
The girl's been living for centuries. I'm sure she has a list of shit she hates to deal with in life.
Vanessa, "You know, I'm something of an alchemist myself."
Carol, "Out of my face, poser."
cause that's terrible
So are we adding unpaid rent to the list of Noble Red's crimes
The man got turned to a stain on the floor
No CyVer pls
I see a lot of fanart of adult Hibiki with long hair. I grew accustomed to it. Then I loved it.
Carol, "This headspace of hers is really comfortable. Going through memories that haven't been burned as fuel yet is quite nostal-"
Milaarc, "Knock knock."
Carol, "This bitch be trespassing. I'm getting my harp."
Adult Hibiki with long hair <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I almost bought her cause she looked cool but I had no idea what was Geah at the time (it was probably still in Season 1-2)
during a festival in a local shopping mall
I remember seeing a Hibiki figma almost a decade ago
I have much regrets
but nah, she arrives in all her glory
You'd think Carol would take another episode or two to appear
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
It's both for me
Except even gayer
Bring back Shirabe and Kirika's handholding Double-Rider Kick
I would ask about Rider punches but that's not fair cause <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
*absolutely beats down Alchemist Halloween Squad*
Carol, *"Ore Sanjou"*
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Oh not not the heart-shaped pupils
<@106861977086779392> Elfnein's henshin is like if the visuals of Wizard's henshin decided to combine with Den-O's Let-Another-Conscious-Take-Over-Your-Body thing
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Elfnein would probably think it's cool cause she's sweet like that
So yeah, it's just Carol
Elfnein is a homonculus, but her thoughts are clearly different from her genocidal original
If my brain cells are working right, the Death Puppets were based off Carol's personality
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Reminder that Carol herself thinks it's cool deep down
I don't believe so
Imagine Carol not programming them with proper running forms because of how much they jump, fly and slide around
A good running form takes way too much memories as fuel <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
despite their conditions
They went out in a blaze of glory
~~unless Carol decides to build an incomplete version of her anyway~~
Her imouto would probably a lot more than a few scrap parts to build
I could barely contain myself
I was screaming when I saw that
They dug too deep, too greedily
Batgirl unleashed what's essentially their Pandora's Box
I need my closure between the two <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
~~but he's only in flashbacks so that doesn't count~~
Unless you count Carol's dad
<:PharaDance:336657302914596866>  <:GarieWink:336657101273169921> <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
That means Top Dad is now the only GX character to not be shown past GX
While Carol and the Autoscorers get to be here in all their glory
I like how Top Dad gets one mention of him fucking off
On a meta(?) note
a lot of the GX finale came down to beam spam
Such as using the thread to form that one drill that she hit Chris with
I just want Carol to start using her arsenal again
Today is a blessed day
It's been several hours and I still can't believe that <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980> is really back
Lieur wants to prepare it in front of Carol like a live-cooking show, Micha can't get her arse to the counter to even start cooking and Micha can't even hold anything right
Except the Autoscorers can't decide what kind of preparation they want to take so it all goes to shit even faster
Her Autoscorers going through that would sound hilarious
"Why do your robots refuel by kissing?"
"Cause I'm a goddamn genius, that's why."
It's broken as hell but cool regardless <:PharaDance:336657302914596866>
We need a Papa Genjuuro moment
Even Genjuuro felt something was off
<:MichaWhat:336657148627124225> <:GarieWink:336657101273169921> <:PharaDance:336657302914596866> <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Now that's true horror
~~pls make it an "AI DATTO" when Hibiki proposes to Miku~~
~~ah right the public kissing~~
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
Wait what
She'd be the type to carry out any mundane task as dramatic as possible
Considering the creation process of the Autoscorers, Carol is probably a chuuni deep down
Forge that smile, there's something uncanny about her eyes <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
please
anything but that
Oh god not Muv Luv
Just screenshotting both cause why not <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
from what these subs imply, at least
Definitely not the first time
RESubs and Commisbus
F
I would take more of that than  more of *him*
alongside 'body rejections'
All the talk of memory transfers and stuff
Has it been implied that Carol has gone through multiple bodies before, or did she lose her first body to Hibiki
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Solo no
~~Put an X inbetween Carol and Nein to make it seem like shipping~~
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952> <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
I love your new name
Crunchyroll's fuck-ups with their youtube vids makes me feel less bad about not being able to watch their vids in my country
"You died too, huh?"
"Yeah. Nuke."
"That's rough."
A Carol and SG conversation
I want Carol to last long enough so Carolnein can fight alongside Amalgam
So Carol gets to do the villain sacrifice for the heroes twice
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Let the babies hurt the Halloween Squad instead
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Chris, "Finally someone points out the gay tension."
It works as it pleases
~~and now here's an idea for a shitpost~~
I'm not reliving Kamen Rider W thank you very much
A henshin sequence with a partner who's conscious will die out after the fight is over
I have been screaming about Carolnein for so long
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
don't do this to me
I've waited so long for this
Fudou's stare is somehow creepier than the rest
This image disturbs me
Hibiki was out of commission and they couldn't do anything to the Fetus God Thing without the punch hamster so *shrug*
Let's be honest, if you saw Garie and the first thing she did was not shit talk you, you would assume that wasn't her
They probably assumed Elfnein was genius enough to reprogram a couple of spare bodies
Thankfully the Geahs had minimal communication with any of the Autoscorers in the newest ep
Hibiki would've turned her into an oil stain on the wall had Garie not tagged along
Micha nearly killed Miku before
Don't forget the potential bad blood between them and the Geahs
Carol programmed her to talk mad shit
Garie is a bad girl but I love her anyway
GenjOgawa would be the most broken thing in the franchise
throw up now
I'm gonna
I don't like what Jr. implies

Imagine if Carolnein brings it out again
inb4 Maria is the one that gets to punch the main villain to oblivion
Horrifyingly cool.
It appeals to me, I guess. She goes from looking like she's wearing a prop from Saw, to looking like a Blazblue character.

<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
tfw you crashed a girl's concert and ended up in a swordfight with her but all you can think about after that is her sweet ass
prompting her to get to business
Maria just hears Dr Ver calling her a useless lesbian
If "Ai desu yo" is the only Ver thing we're getting in XV then I'm all up for it tbh
~~Maria's chances of kissing Tsubasa is lower than HibiMiku tbh~~
So that's the sourc

Someone hammer this sword into shape
Phrasing
The one moment she bit Hibiki's earlobe, Miku probably felt a disturbance at that very moment
Nothing Fine did was fine
~~Considering she lived most of her childhood in terrible conditions, getting access to fiction so she can have some sort of escapism would be amazing~~

especially the ones with real good room service
High-quality love hotels

I think I understand now
Banging on metal wires were used to make the sounds of Star Wars blasters
Star Wars has giant four-legged mechs
Therefore wires = mechs
cause string = giant mecha apparently
The zoid Carol summons at the end of GX

That's the meta answer. These are quotes from the actual characters themselves, which is hilarious.
actual - albeit paraphrased - quotes from a show with talking henshin devices
"Why does this thing have a voice?"
"Cause why not?"
~~ie more Elfnein hangouts that don't end in misery please~~
I wouldn't doubt Elfnein being the type to work to the point that others have to remind her to take care of herself better
~~why is my mind such filth~~

Inb4 their new fighting style is Elfnein making perfect calculations to demolish her enemies while Carol executes the required maneuvers.
but she's been growing on me the past few months
Gotta admit that Hibiki used to be one of my lower picks

What filth is this
*CEASE*
CEASE
encouraging them to get together by being gay asf the entire time
Kirika and Shirabe are the two characters shipping the others
Hibiki is the dense best friend with her own relationship

~~A love triangle ensues~~
One day, her skills bring to her to fame and she ends up collaborating with the famed Zwei Wing

~~no idea where to put it tho~~

Y'all me want to upload her stuff
~~All I Want For Christmas Is You~~ is best tho
My Heart Will Go On, too
True Colors is a blessing
Ayahi has lotsa good English songs
This channel is filthy enough
Good
It appears nothing has come out of its mention,
Did someone say orca
Hero stahp
as long as the body is alive, one shall always be with the other
They're the Two-In-One Alchemist
If she stays, I want Hibiki to have one more moment with her

For every time I called CarolNein the Two-In-One Alchemist, I always though of the possibility of Carol getting the Phillip treatment
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Too much possible bad blood between the Geahs and the Scorers
and crying
lots of bleeding
just painful stabbing
No dying

<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
~~Chris sings this with her parents in an AU where they all live happily without suffering change my mind~~
The violins in it just remind me of the fact that her father used to play one(?)
but Ayahi is amazing
I'm aware
It's beautiful, ain't it
*WOOOOAHHHHH WOAAAHHHH intensifies*
Too bad G Beat got hit with Garie and Micha
<:PharaDance:336657302914596866>
the last duet song goes to HibiMiku
*inb4 it's a duet song ala Zababa*
~~tears abound~~
~~as they ascend to a higher plane of existence~~
~~of Hibiki and Miku finally coming together~~
It's a love song, at best
I'm gonna go screenshot something that summarizes what I expect
Oh god 48 hours till the next episode
but as long as they want for them
a long conversation that lasts only one second in real-time
I'm looking forward to at least one last conversation between them
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
No one wins in that situation
and unlike the FIS, she'd probably be in prison for a long time, assuming that's the sentence they give her.
As much as I love her, I can't see SONG allowing her to be more than a prisoner at best
Carol is still *pretty* much accountable for her actions.
Considering the patterns of the franchise, this is just Carol's last way of doing something right before going for good
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
That's just Loony Tunes
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
They almost never failed a task if you look at it that way
too bad their jobs were to get beat
I did enjoy the competency of the Autoscorers
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673> <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
this is gonna be fun
48 hours till we get our answers (assuming they will be answered in the first place)
Honestly that isn't *too* much of a stretch
ala the shit with Ver in that dream thingie
You're implying that this is a personality that's based on how Elfnein saw Carol?
I did watch them.
The one person that can make Elfnein really realize her abilities would be Carol imo
he's let go of the bike long ago
and when you think your dad is guiding you
Think of it like your dad teaching you how to ride a bike
Carol is just guiding her
etc
Calculcations, combat tactics,
Such as maybe in the following episode, Elfnein is the one that does all the heavy-lifting in the fight.
Ah, never mind. Either way, I think it would be healthier overall for Elfnein to be able to live past Carol.
Oh god we only have 5 episodes of Geah left <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>

Look at that sass

A bit of a stretch
Wanting to still destroy the world after everything in GX

somehow with more parts than before
Symphogear crashes then reforms itself from the burning wreck
I feel satisfied in a sense
Being on one like this after several crashes of disappointment
This hype train is one of the best I've been on
*the fight lasts for the entire song purely so Genjuuro could punch to the music*
*slides in Jackie Chan cassette*
*Gen walks up to the big bad with stereo in hand*
XV finale
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
and being badass regardless
The contrast of having Gen wearing something really corny alongside the modern Geahs
then he just punches things to oblivion regardless
goofy helmets and everything
Even better if it's closer to the Showa-era Riders
Lasting Song?

Hibiki was busy looking cool
That's episode 13
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
But that's just a hallucination of mine so pay no heed to it
and the remaining eps are just Romantic SOLs
Just gonna bring back my old shitpost of the plot finishing up next episode
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
But due to the size of Leiur's little sister ,we get 4 Tinyscorers and 1 regular Autoscorer
Something something charm point
13 minutes until the raw

SymphoSaturday is the best day
Holy fuck
Ho
I like the attack itself
that was weird
As much as I like Chris and her assets
~~it's 3 AM please forgive my lack of brain cells atm~~
~~don't mind me just shitposting~~
Same energy


how appropirate
Just like Leiur's little sister
even if he's only on episode 1
I want to scream to my Geah friend back at my hometown to get his ass to finish AXZ
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
It's 3 AM and I doubt I can sleep after this
Fuck

at the middle of the night
I can't scream
I live in a dorm now
Fucking Symphogear
"I'm about to do what you call a pro-gamer move"
Carol "Can't even generate a billion people's worth of Phonic Gain smh"
"I see"
"We're fucked"
"Carol, what do you think of the current situation?"
"I believe we may be currently screwed"
"Oh dear this is bothersome"
Every episode from here on out
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
I just had a realization that Miku's first on-screen transformation doesn't have that awful boob jiggle SSJ had
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
~~not yet~~
It won't be too hard
Considering the typical pace of Geah
I'm breathing so hard right now
7 days till the next episode
oh god
Somehow despite being in a freezing room, I managed to sweat
~~seriously of all the GX callbacks you had to do~~
just not that
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Ah, right. Sensible.
or do they inject it or something
So can someone remind me if the Halloween Squad just ingest the blood

She's a bad girl
orz
"I'm just gonna stay quiet while you settle things out"
"This is awkward"
"Oh"
"I'm gonna help you save your wife now"
Imagine being SG here
And I thought the NTR-Inspector had a bloody death
OOF
"NO"
"Fuck's sake, leave your buttplugs"
God 7 days
It's 4 30 and I shall now retire for the night
"Welp. They're getting punked out there. Guess I'll just toss 'em some toys."
That works too

Kimi Dake Ni is a death song confirmed
Ah, just shitposting
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
just makes me think she's just Lalah Sune crossed with Zeonic tech
Vanessa's dark skin
Red Hot Blaze
~~don't get mad i love zeon too~~
~~No wonder Vanessa is considered a failure by the Illuminati~~
Hover legs, wired arms, finger guns, etc
Vanessa is clearly Zeonic tech instead of Fed
She's a walking GP03 D. Orchis
Why use grenades when you're packing more missiles than a Gundam
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I was thinking more on Vanessa just spinning along with the gatling gun's rotation
~~fuck that came out wrong~~
I wanna imagine Vanessa jamming her finger into her gatling gun
As much as I loved the revolvers
Which was sick ngl
Last time Chris fought Noise she just used her homing revolver
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
~~Red Hot Blaze is as prominent as her quad guns this season~~
Indeed, the gatling guns have been underused lately.
This ship will sail regardless of how many times it gets hit by canon
delet that ryu
Did someone say Basa VS Chris

Looking at this shot just makes me realize that she can't sit comfortably in that chair with all that stuff on her back
Simpleton: *Kimi Dake Ni* will be played to break Miku free
Intellectual: **Hibiki will break Miku free by singing Itsuka ni Niji, Hana no Omoide (Shinai ED song) with her**
That cushion is cute tho
Miku's change in speech pattern is just <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I wouldn't mind another finale without the X-Drives tbh
but hearing *boing* after lots of explosions was jarring
Maybe it was just the headsets
Ah, the prominent sound effect of it too
Seeing Hibiki turn into a mighty glacier kinda makes for less fun fights imo
They could literally have SG info dump about Amalgam
that's important, y'all
Genjuuro has extra warm underpants
And make everything up until now pointless?
But why
A little bad dream from Hibiki isn't enough
if she was gonna die, they'd do it much more painfully to our emotions
The cynical part of me doubts they'll just kill Miku off like that
we're the ones that remain in the back as we hype the shit out of our Geahs
is the fanbase
The real Woz
~~the hype part is asleep~~
~~Currently that's the primary mood for me right now~~
The more cynical part of me says no
You say that as if people have the ability to stop watching episodes at arbitrary moments

<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980> <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952> I want Eleven9 Karaoke
"Hey, we're releasing AXZ ~~eventually~~"
The clickbait titles, spoiler clips, AXZ "release"
Oh boy does it have problems
While I like Crunchy actually giving Geah e exposure
"-de arimasu"
Onore Fudou
Oh man I need it
Bikki singing gently compared to all the shouting up until now
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Shirtless Gen pls
He already wanted to take the field since the start of XV
"Pity about the DVD though. Kung Fu Hustle is too good."
"Don't worry. The DVD casings within my shirt prevented the blow from being fatal."
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
He gets stabbed and everyone is sad, then following ep he said he was just napping
Heard it here first, y'all
Warm underpants payoff incoming
Gen and Fudou better fucking thrown down
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
I come home excited to see the preview images and the first thing I see is top dad
Akuma Homura VS Kohinata Kamiku
Why do every goth gfs that love Aoi Yuuki get these nicknames
it's cute and cool at the same time
I can't get enough of that headgear
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
and we get one ~~last~~ Gen song
is Genjuuro bringing his stereo box
The only way to improve it
Can't wait to stay up till 2 AM for the episode release again
It will be something straight out of Fist of the North Star
Ayahi yes
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Takatora deserved better
*detail*
It's like seeing the costumes in live action hero-shows actually break instead of showing sparks
Well he's not wrong to assume that
*Kimi dake ni stops*
I doubt they even need to eat
Imagine needing blood instead of kisses to power yourself <:PharaDance:336657302914596866>
Typing is hard while gluing together model kits
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
His body shrinks with his clothes on
He's Machio from Dumbbell
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Straight shipping isn't
There we go <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
(sorry i forgot his name)
I'll take Carol's dad over either of them
I'm just gonna go back to painting
going on here
What is
Empathy be damned
There would be those kind of people that joke about Tsubasa's concerts being a death trap
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Gotta make that crossover money
The intensity of it when it first played in GX made the song for me
Radiant Force especially
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
You were experiencing unintentional time travel for a moment
Instead of something that drags on for decades as its body rots the entire way
It will be a beautiful ending
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Don't remind me
<:Germain:421434126856486912> <:Germain:421434126856486912> <:Germain:421434126856486912>
>see group song
>wake up <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
~~hehe~~
KaMiku doing's god's work
But yeah
Tsubasa unintentionally
Like holy shit only Nehustan has drawn Gen's blood
I'll admit that it's impressive that Gen didn't get fucking *impaled* on that hand thrust
What a ride
Whew
Body armor to the max
Sunglasses
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Anything better than suits and pistols
They're Imperial Guard Conscript-level of expendable
with the enemies they face, you'd think they arm them better
SONG needs better agents
She'll do Kirika
yo
Bat girl, "It's just a flesh wound"
She had a lingering shot with no blood
Only Vanessa has the chance of surviving
from everyone
Lots of hugs
Tsubasa needs a hug when they get back to base
How many pictures of smol Bikki do you think Miku has
Scream time
It's that time of the day/night again
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Which is surprising tbh
I didn't hate them nor like them
*all of us*
Top dad's scenes were the only ones I tuned out in
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
and improve morale
It would give the body shields a false sense of security
but still sunglasses
*shing*
*pew*
Yesh, that's dark
Prob crying among the pieces of her friends
He should've lifted
Yasu needs to lift
Nah, he's fine
Tsubasa everything is heartbreaking
Did you not see his abs when he was upside down
His abs protected him from impalement
Gen literally too manly to die
Geahs in Sentai Suits beating up God with giant weapons
So no X-Drive, but en-masse Amalgam
*gets slapped*
"You hit me! Not even my father- wait..."
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
that was cool
She duel-wielded
Oof
So good
God
Gen VS Fudou looked amazing despite its length
NR certainly saw that dress
Why did he take off his shirt in the last part again
^
They awoke the sleeping dragon
I WANT MY GAY
Kimi Dake Ni next episode right
She's the wild card that has no true pairing but is the most popular
Symphogear Romantic Sitcom
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
Shinnais are our only hope for her basuday
instead of fighting monsters every day
Get some of that peaceful life
The man will not cease as long as his beliefs fuel him
Only way to defeat him is to strip him of his pride and honour
Oof
but chose to punch instead
He was going to impale him
Did Gen hesitate?
Looking at the fight again though
Inner damage is temporary
thos abs
to impale
It takes Nehustan
Like I said
Breathe, man
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Solo is here lol
It's the 7 week wait again
Gaijin would probably be in pieces
The infidel
Kazanari bloodline is fucked
Man too angery to be regular sized
Jesus Christ
Fudou got *big*
rip
I think only Agent survived that entire thing tbh
Ogawa was busy tending to what was left of his men
The fact that Gen didn't die is still impressive
Which isn't a bad thing
Ah, I should rewatch that
is all I can say
WHAT TEH FUCK
breaking it
and did a corkscrew spin
He grabbed the sword tip
That animation
Seeing Basa without that hair
It's so weird
Err I think
Not helpful when there's people sleeping in this hostel
Symphogear once again got me screaming at 3 AM
and some abdomens
and a leg
Noble Red needs a hand
Y'all gonna get a heart attack at this rate
Chris "Goddamit I literally took a cannon to the face to protect that damn moon"
either next ep or the ep after that
HibiMiku montage combined with Kimi Dake Ni
Especially the second half
God, All Loaded is amazing
*bang*
DefenderZ is a banger
Yeh
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
Chris not suffering for this season
Unstoppable Force/Immovable Object Form
Just being near the blade made him bleed
pure offense
Amalgam is like
7 billion phonic gain something something
<:CarolPout:617039564313198602>
I need Carol and Geah interactions
NO
That would be such a shitshow
Imagine if they had Ver motivate Maria to bring back Tsubasa
With each passing episode, the chances of Ver coming back decreases
KaMiku has nice shoes ngl ~~yep i should sleep brain cells reaching low activity~~
There's so much going on
the funnier it gets
The longer I look at that picture
and Eflnein is just overwhelmed from their questions
I wanted to see what the girls had to say about Carol comin back
<:CarolPout:617039564313198602>
"DO IT"
*about to be sliced by Tsubasa's kimewaza*
I kinda want Milaarc to live just a bit longer so she can process the suffering of what just happened
That picture could be sent to someone that wants Symphogear summarized in one picture
They could always sew Miku a new dress
Killing with style
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
~~More of a gentle shove~~
Doggo went split
level of anatomy
General Grevious
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
She's just the Zeong now
Vanessa now just being a head
Vanessa was surprisingly 'calm' despite everything
*shing*
*zap*
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
To suffer more
Keep them alive
pew
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
XV in a nutshell
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
~~Hazard is better than RabbitRabbit/TankTank and Genius~~
Facts
Tsubasa songs increase sharpness with LS
Chris songs give attack bonuses to Gunners
Same
Same ~~energy~~ Phonic Gain
Can't wait for Vanessa to spend the finale as a head ala the Zeong
We closing the XV channel? <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Clearly the video was a spoiler <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
The real question is when are we getting that DMJii duet
Probably next episode or the one after that
A man can dream
Strong willpower right there
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
*Ame-no-Habakiri*
It is a blessed day
Boom, here it is
I hang out with my fellow Geah fan and I tell him about his favorite Geah's song releasing soon
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
tomorrow <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Speaking of songs
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Just like a Beef Stroganoff song release
Can't get it anywhere else
Their dynamic is more akin to Rider's tendencies to have them beat the shit out of each other before becoming allies than the team-oriented Sentai
Geah is just anime Kamen Rider
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
~~Seriously, if they're posting a chat long, I expect more memes, poor grammar and incoherent messages chains for some level of entertainment~~
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
So it's just a chat long
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I didn't even click it
What is that description even
Gen is too sturdy to die
Chris shoots her while getting shot herself
then she just flies around like a Zeong head
I bet she has a thruster in her neck
So where does <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>  rank
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Feels amazing
My Geah mega playlist now clocks in at 8.4 hours
Several times
Getting bisected would probably leave him with plenty of energy to degrade his children
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I wanted to see more of Hibiki's mom and grandmom cause they looked like completely normal people and we are in a severe need of that <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
~~not like Genjuuro can die anyway~~
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Her situation can't get any worse right
Poor Basa
Genuine tears here
I come back on and I finally read those lyrics
I'm so confused
What are these previews even
I wanna see her break the tape with ab power
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Fudou's Happy Fun Ride Time begins soon
I love this shot
Rocket fists aside
Not fun to watch
Bikki being a mighty glacier is kinda uh
Yeah, I can understand that
*But ghost duet*
Explains why Vany was quite calm about them getting jammed last ep
*Voltec Finish*
I feel like they just threw a couple of words from the dictionary for that
Turning it into a hamster ball of death
That spins into a sphere
I think
It's a bear trap

These girls are so cool goddamit
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
Solo is here
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
her Shem Ha voice is just
As much as I want Miku to come back
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
or else he'll come
Do not mention the name
Shhhhh
I have to question how an arm-mountain scissor would work
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
clearly that's how it works
so they can breathe
They think they can breathe
She tries her best
Considering the Halloween Squad is poor asf, you'd think they made their clothes for each other
Her outfit is pretty nice
Same place where she keeps all her ammunition
a secret compartment
She stored it in her body
Don't forget the killer fashion sense
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Like a mundane road trip with your friends
then chat during the travel
They could just ignite their thrusters and head in the direction of Earth
one word that describes Geah
Exactly
Not the first time they've done so
~~How romantic~~
At this point, Maria loves flicking Tsubasa
~~Does anyone think Genjuuro gets Hibiki and Co. to watch Jason Vorhees movies on her birthday~~
This is one weird game of caterpillar
Curse of Balal- Wait...
171 squad rise up
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
The realization when me mum shares Chris' name and her height
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Huh, so I'm around Maria's height
This thread is making me insecure about my height now <:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
Gotta love those sparks
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
So... FMA Brotherhood?
Is AVX a new season?
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
I see stuff from Turn A, I approve
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
A movie to the AU line, yeah
~~is Code Geass even still relevant~~ <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
<:PharaDance:336657302914596866>
It's a kamen rider gaim reference
That's more bedroom smug imo
👀
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Might come back in the finale ~~and finally pass on~~
She's sleeping, probably
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Punching the devil/god together is one of the most romantic things ngl
G Gundam was too good
*breathes in* I must calm myself
G GUNDAM END PLEASE
YES
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Fudou a hoe
~~even then don't, just don't~~
Don't drink alcohol unless it's Chinese/Lunar New Year or something lol
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
There's more soda than cola?
It's an unspoken rule around these parts <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Suddenly this is Bayonetta
lewd
I see.
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Oh dear something went wrong there
Miku is best divine vessel
Fixed that for ya, lad
Chris is best ~~meme material~~
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Checkmate
The sun can't
The moon can power a cannon capable of wiping out space civilization
*A clear decision*
I'd still shoot it anyway <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Imagine spending half an hour looking decent, then you go out and your hair becomes a fritzy bush from the heat
She's go go gadget if he were made by Zeon scientists
<:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
Double the Bikkis
Shhhh don't jinx it
Nope.
Never mind, that's just the regular appetizer
except the appetizer sets the entire table screaming
It's the appetizer before the main course
That's an underwhelming amount <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
You need some tea, lad
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920> Can't wait for several hours of incoherent screaming
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I bet she can crush a melon with those thighs
Comfy murderers
It better be the most romantic damn thing ever
God, my hype for Hibiki's B-side
Imprisoned Miku is just giving me more and more Devil Gundam vibes tbh
Today is a glorious day
XDU songs?
Wait what
She loves doing it at this point
It's kinky time for Maria and Basa
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
~~what are you gonna do, arrest me for lewd crimes~~
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
four times the fun
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Air got lamb?
<:ShirabeWhisper:620073899001905153>
I played Earth Defense Force so I'm sure I'm right <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Gatlings seemed better for endless hordes
I think something like revolver is more suitable for targets like the Halloween Squad
Billion Maiden got to shine in episode 1
~~Yeah, but I had no other comment tbh~~
Every Chris smile is the best smile
DUEL WIELD
Goddamn there's such an easy joke to make about bunnies and couples, but I'll refrain from that
bunnies
Ah yes
*Mommu peeks out from the corner*
Batgirl got skimpier
Packing more heat than a damn Gundam
yeah, waist
or waist
Why a grenade launcher when she has missile silos on her thighs
?
padding
So are Vanessa's boobs just
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
would not wrestle naked with
Adam has a 10/10 body but his personality is dumpster/10
oh no
<:ShirabeWhisper:620073899001905153>
for that
curves
there were clearly some errr
Didn't the yoyos roll off her tho
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
That's inappropriate
ie Geah is better with the armor aesthetic of Kamen Rider than the spandex of Sentai <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
and I'm depraved as hell
Dino, you're going a *bit* far there
~~This discussion is now cursed~~
pls
did you really
Oh god Dino
More stuff I can't get and can only look at from afar <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Megane Yuuki looks cute asf
~~God I hope the 2nd image becomes canon~~
**yes**
Just
One thing I love about Flamme being used here is now that it has the context of being used to beat up ~~Bayonetta~~ Milaarc instead of just being played in a concert that ended up with a hostage situation
Never gets old tbh
We've seen that plenty of times
**Ignition**
Holy shit
Oh fuck not that again
~~is that a fucking Mazinger Z reference~~
Enki's left arm is his fossilized severed arm
Like, a simple kiss or a makeout kiss
It's still good tho
Second half of the song, I think
A-side
~~Maria is the Dragon gundam~~
Oh god Shem Ha
Gotta say, the arm poses they use for Amalgam is so cool
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
2 episodes left. No Ver in sight. This is a good thing.
or do they now
But they don't even have Carol in XDU
I expected a shining finger but alright


How the fuck can I sit down when I'm shaking all over
<@141531216200466432> <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
but it will be glorious
It will probably be cheesy as hell
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
Miku is not having a good time right now
~~Hot aliens~~
<:PharaDance:336657302914596866>
part of the fun
Screaming for Symphogear is like
Who didn't
YES
Oof
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
and the overuse breaks her
What if Elza is forced to use her buttplugs again
*worry*
She's not
*bang*
Arms
Wild Arms
Scraping Ver off the chateau's floor must've been fun
>_>
~~he would fit in a ditch~~
whew
Crotch tattoo and everything
Millarc got kinky as hell
Damn right Enki is hot
I expect Shem Ha licking in the picture
or less
Prob in an hour or two
We need more <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952> screentime
or accesses the chataeu
carries it to the moon or something
Carol lifts the submarine
I'm not ready for the finale
the noise Tsubasa makes is hilarious
I wanna see Maria flick Tsubasa more
~~So that's where the food she eats goes to~~

This episode was lewd
pfftt
~~and matches Chris' colours well~~
It's aesthetically pleasing
for Kuroneko/96Neko
It's an album art
Yeh
*Give me the cheese*
Both it and what came right before it
I need that so badly
as a stain on the floor
Just a cameo
No Ver
Oh sweet
Do we have any info on his voice actor?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Gotta hand it to him for being brave
So much going on
Prob my favorite reaction image thus far
IWAE
sasuga CR
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Ah okay
or...
submarine
Sub as in
Vanessa just becomes Dendrobrium Orchis
~~no don't mention GX~~
Assuming she never is
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
It made for a cool shot
10/10 Kirika
Oh lol
~~welp brain cells failing i should sleep now nights god i can't wait for next week~~
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Control X
Control V
Carol sleepy
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Better late than never <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
~~at least Maria isn't insufferable like Ryuki~~ <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<@209126772069892096> Looks like I'm not the only one who had the same thought about Maria's arm
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
every XV episode thus far
Isn't that like
~~I completely forgot First Love Song played after Synchrograzer~~ <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Something something *ignition*
Nah. I doubt they'd break the OP [Aufwachen] tradition
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
I think they can quite handle it
It's bait, lad
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Good grief
What the hell am I looking at
🔥
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
<@279341087494242304> G Gundam end confirmed
*panicked bird noises*
Oh god Tsubasa
I'm not sure if lyrics from the Symphogear wiki are reliable <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Google time!
I honestly can't remember the lyrics. I can count the amount of times I've listened to it on one hand.
Then there's the apple in the Adam & Eve thing
It's the song Maria sings to her little sister
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Shem Ha did what she did cause Enki handed her an apple that he didn't know was spoiled
don't forget the KiriShirabe and TsubaMaria
Oi
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
yandere bad
Batgirl got demoted to shinnai form earlier than everyone else
Elsa's useless so she can't fight back ~~probably~~
I'm betting they just go to jail
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
You mean the weekly wait for that one shaky image
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
Is it SymphoSaturday yet
God
I think Ogawa can sew
They can always sew
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Miku definitely still has something to eat tho
<:ShirabeWhisper:620073899001905153>
Does that count as loving yourself
Love that emote
There we go
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Ogawa is worksexual
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Who mentioned straight shipping in this server
Eh, he'll probably drown me out with Tsubasa music
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
~~I'll just do that when I head back to my hometown at the end of the month~~
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I live 5 hours away from him
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
My friend (doesn't like Hibiki): Okay, that's pretty cool
When Hibiki started punching tank shells
I'm gonna miss hyping for the next episode once it all ends <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
as a stain on the floor
Namedropped during a chateu cleaning service
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330> no ver pls
That dress <:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
👀 I have a feeling where this is going
But Elsa has them too
The spiked chests are throwing me off from recognizing anything
~~Elsa looks so damn cute tho~~
I can't recognize the belt
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Shem-Ha took over Picture-kun
Vanessa trying to clobber someone with a folding chair is the most hilarious thing I've seen today
~~you'll never reach the truth~~
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
whew
~~Star~~ Moon-Crossed Lovers

<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
I think you mean KaMiku
SymphoScribes, you have our gratitude <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Elfnein getting screentime again?
~~I want my G Gundam end okay~~
they then punch the monster to death with a giant heart
Freeing her
Gold Bikki confesses to Miku
Yggdrasil forms a giant monster that spans all of Japan
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Custodian biology must be different in some areas
He probably turned to light/ash
Fuck, that's deperssing
No one to give words to except the cold air
Dying alone without anyone knowing what you did
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
D'oh
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
So can I expect FineXEnki SOL fanfics after the show is over or should I pick up the pen again
Nighties~
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
~~i'm gonna go now srry~~
I'd rather die to a broom
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
*no bulli*
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
With the gayest lyrics in Symphogear pls
Miku and Bikki punching a giant heart into a monster
Yeah but
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
~~and then making out~~
Bikki feeling a bit grabby since Miku ain't around for a while
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Elfnein thought Carol's weapons needed a new look
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
While I like Steel Ball Run, ||the Another Diego lowered my opinion on it ||
I'm sorry for having a filthy mind but that could've been phrased better
I want more Revue Starlight <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
So satisfying
to finally experience weekly Gear
I only joined in after AXZ ended
>_>
Being dead doesn't stop anyone at all sometimes
Or do something plot relevant
~~i should control my thirst better~~
Enki is hot tho
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
~~All I have ever read is sinful things~~
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
But why
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
It just gives them a reason to draw the characters as translucent figures instead
very bad
then that would be bad
unless you lose internet connection
Symphogear ain't gonna go away
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
With *bang* spray-painted on each bullet
Chris Amalgalmmmmmmmmmm <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
Time to cast Silence on this channel
Someone replace this clock. It's too noisy, in my opinion. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Middle is cute
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Then we shall suffer for the sake of Geah
and you make sure the alarm clock is Symphogear music
That's when you bring in the alarm clocks
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Oh god I'm trying to nap before the episode releases but I'm too excited to sleep
**Composure**
Composure
*breathes in*
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
IT'S LIKE DANTE AND VIRGIL HAD A CHILD
YO THE OGAWA CLAN LEADER IS HOT
~~they murderers tho~~
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Easier to say they do than they don't
Really looking like the RX-78 at the end of Mobile Suit Gundam, Vanessa
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Next week will be the final week of this channel being nothing more than screaming
**thank god i was wrong**
I thought they would be no more than just keyword material
Ogawa's bros got mentioned in keywords
^
Solo here
NO WONDER THAT LOOKED FAMILIAR
OH
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Oh god
F
IWAE
<:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
*god please*
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580> I need that b-track
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
no pls
*frantic shaking*
*incoherent screaming*
I realize that Kimi Dake Ni is next ep
As I control my thirst
Oh god
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
They can triple attack me
*immense thirst*
She ain't big as she was before
Carol just being careful with her new body :v
Tsubasa and Maria were the only ones that didn't seem to forgive NR, sooooo
Fudou probably just laughing in jail right now
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
WEEKLY GEAR IS COMING TO AN END
I CAN'T CONTAIN MY HYPE FOR THE FINALE
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>

Equivalent of exchange
~~F for buttplug furry~~
Well, hindsight
~~also hell yeah no Ver in sight~~
the Bikki eyes
It's so good
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
Chris rocking forever
when she said that
Elfnein probably blushing inside her
~~shit where did i put that Kanade and Hibiki art comparison~~
The chick finally became the hen?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Kirika Dess-Scythe Custom
But Takumi in Fates tho
^
to make up for the lack of Billion Maiden
Kinda wanted it to be a gatling gun
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
"I have seen the human form contort in ways unimaginable"
~~Kung Fury was a good fucking movie ngl~~
Oh my god
~~probably the same people from the Area 51 raid~~
tfw the Ogawa Ninjas have no symbols on their headbands
Next week is gonna be a fucking ride
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
So did Noble Red get their Dead Redemption
~~tfw too poor for nitro~~
It is a blessed gif
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227> <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Both is good
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
I must retain composure
among other things
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
I already had my screaming with the Ogawa bros
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
The screams fuel us
Imracles <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
*keels over ded*
right nighties~
I'm yawning so much to the point it's painful since I have an ulcer on my lips <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Oh god the week wait will be a killer
I should sleep
it's 4 27 AM
Welp
Most definitely
The moment it plays will definitely be a pivotal one
They had no reason to play it here considering who the song is aimed at and the fact that Hibiki was on the moon the entire episode
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
definitely followed by crying
probably followed by crying
Next week is going to have so much screaming and incoherent shouting
Bikkini pic*
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Imagine not having your pal as your phone's wallpaper
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Bikki is just desensitized to everything they do
It's a song I will slap someone with when someone tries to imply that Symphogear doesn't have lesbians
Very
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
In the middle of fighting next episode
Another short explaination maybe?
~~staying up till 4 am for Geah is suffering~~
Aaaaand my memory is limited cause I just woke up from a nap
Serena and Maria are Ukrainian iirc
~~Serena screwing us over from the grave~~ <:Ver:336656981144109066>
NR emotes <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
~~to channel Kanade~~
Their hair went floof
I couldn't wait to rewatch that one scene  <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
*shiny hair*
Rewatching the girls do the super hero atmospheric reentry landing got tears out of me ngl
Need a bottle before you start screaming?
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
Good idea
I have no mic <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Tbh
I'm gonna cry when it's all over
We got Ninja Virgil Dante. That's the last thing I'd expect from Geah
<:PharaDance:336657302914596866>
It is a glorious season
~~it's difficult alright~~
Ogawa Clan is hoooooot
Carol and Elfnein farewell scene incoming
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
She a hag
Nah
It might be Carol's last ride tho <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Before Hibiki uses the power of gay to free her
Maria probably has some words for Shem-Ha while they're flinging giant swords at each other
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
She was cool
I had a seven-legged spider in my old room named Nana
Tfw the college hostel is so clean there's no spider to befriend
I left my pets at home since I'm studying outside my hometown
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
But I have Geah friends here at least <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Around me
No one else has gotten into the Phonic Gain
I only have one Geah friend but sadly I'm hours away from him for study
Ayyyyy
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Was nervous about joining since I never Discorded until now
Then only joined Discord recently with the news of the rewatch
I remember coming here when I saw a clip of Gold Bikki fisting Adam
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
~~marriage when~~
He would be a great JRPG main protagonist <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Rip Enki tho
To literally God knows where
Then fled
The Custodians buried Shem-Ha in the artic maybe?
I bet Shem-Ha got real upset when she went into the net and saw thousands of blue-haired characters that reminded her of Enki
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Shen-Ha's just a language so just unplug your speakers
It ain't even real
Just look away from the screen lol
*hackermen*
Pimp Ogawa is just fine tbh
*swoon*
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
~~i bet he made the area 51 raid event~~
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
When it comes to cool guys with authority
My composure being kept is reliable as getting consecutive 6s on a dice roll
*takes big sip*
*must retain composure about ninja dante*
**Carol**
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I like its finale regardless, but Shem-Ha- ah they're probably gonna do it anyway
like GX had
I just hope it doesn't have *too* much beam spam
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
fucking Christ
Tsubasa's b-track
rip papa bird
then Gen just flexes and tears his suit apart
I need Gen preparing one big giant dinner for the girls to celebrate everything they've done
and much vocal intensity
lots of mouthwork indeed
Practice
Ah yes
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>  "Miku, watch this!"
*crumples dumbbell between her thighs*
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
thousand Kilograms
but the girls are still able to benchpress
The Gears are gone forever
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
~~nah too much shit taste~~
I wonder if mecha anime becomes more popular in Symphogear's time
~~they even bring back rage comics~~
all brought back like a necromancer-lead army
Imagine 4 decades worth of memes
all from the grave
Since it's 2045, they just bring up 40 years of shitty memes
inb4 clogging the next with shitposts was how the world blocked Shem-Ha
1% is enough to beat Carol GX
He ran away cause he is too powerful
An improvement is an improvement ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
He's better than before, for sure
*catchy tune*
**CarolElfnein**
**Elfnein**
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
They just flood the net with TsubaMaria art and Shem-Ha recoils at the sight of a blue-haired warrior getting action that she never could
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
"YO GREG JUST GOT THANOS'D BY A BLOB AND I SAW THAT IDOL WITH CAT EARS TEAR IT APART AFTERWARDS"
*looks at Rany*
"Am I the only one that pays attention to Maria's toned body. She looks like she could benchpress me."
"DAE think that *insert male celebrity* would go well with Tsubasa-sama?"
"Get your hetero shit out of here smh"
"BasaIsBest hasn't come online for a while now. F in the chat for him"
What if we're the same people in that universe <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
The black leather trenchcoat did not do him any favours for his mobility
he trips and breaks his neck on his way to fight the Noise when they actually appear
Among the crowd is a fedora-wearing, katana-wielding fan that came to protect his waifus
*one of them starts looking eager*
*song ends*
*crowd starts looking around nervously*
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
~~I wonder if the amount of shitposting going on is enough clog Shem-ha~~
"DAE think that Maria-sama has a good idea?"
It's <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367> passive charm
Oh that
what
"just survived a hostage situation lol idol concerts are wack"
"What a waste of a good ticket"
*Noise comes out of the screen*
OP "Hey guys, I got tickets for the new Tsubasa concert!"
Anon 1 "lul get fucked"
Anon 2 "F"
Anon 3 "God I wish that were me"
Anon 4 "That's one expensive funeral lol"
*trumpets*
*anime ja nai*
Oh god it's almost over....
I'll probably start writing Geah fics once it's all over
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
~~Sorry Kerrik but i'm in thirst mode today~~
and fingers
in those hands
imagine the power
Maria is a hand to hand combatant
<:PharaDance:336657302914596866>
in more ways than one
Basa likes getting flicked by her gfs
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>

<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
This channel has really degenerated dear god what have I done
smh
how can people not know that
Gungnir gives all their users dicks
~~I'm sorry~~
Waffle was an old thing passed around the internet
This channel is on fucking fire lol
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
shhhhhh
Far worse
was meant to keep away
Something that the Curse of Balal
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
Oh god why must you mention that
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
Bluebird
Yeah
Honestly
It was super effective
~~is that how the phrase goes~~
Pot calling the kettle black, eh Kerrik
Smh
Much sinning is going on here
And I thought I was mad
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I don't think Carol's gonna live past XV tbh
~~alright i'm gonna go and watch my Kamen Rider so my rampant thirst doesn't set this channel on fire again~~
It's like a fucking boomerang
it's so cool
God that pendant
By kissing KaMiku, Shem-Ha's first kiss and life was stolen
soul just fucks off into oblivion
HibiMiku kiss and Shem-Ha evaporates
Everyone be gangsta till they meet aquatic life
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Must be an Ogawa thing to have multiple things on your CV
while his older brothers took up the clan duties
he was allowed to pursue whatever job he wanted
Iirc since he was the youngest of the brothers
~~Ogawa's always cute tho~~
sorry Producer Ogawa
Dante Ogawa best Ogawa
with Shirabe in bed with Basa
There was that one XD thing
I don't dislike it, but offing a chara for a pairing is <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
God help me
That would be so wrong
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
What am I looking at
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
inb4 she survives but they put her on house arrest for genocide
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
4x speed and it still felt slow
was doing a Dragonball marathon with cousins for some laughs
I've speedwatched anime before
But the way it's sung in the anime is typically different from the CD releases
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
You what
Thanks <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~but Fine is deader than ded so probably nah~~
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
inb4 ghost Fine comes back and stabs Shem-Ha's spirit as payback for stabbing her man
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Both looking fine but only one is Fine
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
sad scene
Cute hairstyle
Hetero in *my* Symphogear? It's more likely than you think
I'm gonna watch, then cry ugly tears, then get back into writing fanfic to sate my need
then you see that Maria didn't even touch her glass
Maria is the craziest
seeking consolation from Maria
immediately becomes a whimpering wreck
Tsubasa takes one sip
~~I doubt Geah can have that but a man can dream~~
Over a hundred 4-5 minute shorts
so many shorts
Idolmaster had the Puchimas series
Despite the really ominous line she had in the start
I'm glad to have gone through a season with ~~much~~ Chris suffering, that's for sure.
*breathes in fanfic*
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
~~and then after the Lives it's all over~~
Glorious SOL
We still have the Shinais
Shhhhhh
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
My reading comprehension farted for a second there
5 more days (for 13) fam
~~maybe they'll use their gears for bedtime fun idk~~
So I'll agree that I can't see all of them, if any, getting destroyed
Usually stuff like that has build-up with characters wondering what their lives would be like without their powers, in this case, the Symphogears
God I can't wait for Kimi Dake Ni
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
I joke about it, but nah
Ech
Kissing someone while possessed
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Cause why not?

Also that one with Shirabe and Kirika reaction to Milaarc's appearance
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812> This is great too
I wouldn't mind normal series animation if we get more expressions like <:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
*enormous swig*
Thanks
~~okay i should stop before i go even further~~
Surely they bond over the hot steam of a single, crowded hot spring
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
and only each other
clearly they have good bonds with each other
It's a clan of only men
Pffftt
Considering Ogawa's capabilities despite his focus as a Producer, the thought of an Ogawa that is purely made for combat is a terrifying ~~if a bit arousing~~ thought
Bad to eat late at night
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Symphogear May Cry ~~over tomatoes~~
awesome
Backed up by ninjas in headbands and everything
Dante Ogawa is better tho
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
tbh
I can see why Fine went mad for Enki
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
At least it ain't on fire like it was yesterday
*fear*
*Are there more cursed pictures I have yet to know*
*What pic*
Touched by the hands of Nurgle
This channel is unclean
All the holy water
Lots of holy water
I'm getting the holy water
*why*
Oh my god I recognize that reference
Kazanari Eternu Yami Shin
Wait a minute...
Ragna Kazanari the Bloodedge
solo why
I think I just threw up in my mouth a little
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
You mean the franchise that literally became a zombie
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
Vanessa with an folding chair is still the best thing these comics have given imo
This is psychological warfare
that the Curse of Balal tried to contain
This was the real Shem-Ha
~~fuck the bits of white around it bother me so much~~
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Thanks
I need your cross
<@!247701824335904770> help
It's pendant form is also a lighter shade of red.
My relic is the super relic. Anything you can do, it can do but super.
I doubt the topic won't be brought up again in the near future, to be honest
Sorry guys but <#336297840529899522>
~~I have 3~~
Pffttt one and only?
*grabs cross*
Who mentioned statue fetish
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
This mouth ulcer *is* making me ingest more water than usual
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
My question still stands
~~which lips~~
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
I think my immense thirst caused that one
Nothing beats the one from a couple days ago
Nah
Though I'd probably fall asleep after a couple of drinks
Will share drinks with tho
He's good, but not to my taste <:PharaDance:336657302914596866>
~~Dante Ogawa has that will-be-your-caring--but-rough-senpai vibe~~
Producer Ogawa has that dependable vibe
Host Ogawa is the lowest of the third imo
*big sip*
~~I bet their ninja outfits is just to hide their pretty boy features~~
No one stops me whenever I talk about the Ogawa clan 👀
*sips water*
~~Also mecha musume is among the best fetishes and no one can tell me otherwise~~
Honestly that knight cafe is a couple of steps away from being a possible Dungeons and Dragons cafe
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
I must go to that cafe
Same thing for Radiant Force tbh
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
XV ep 1 still feels like yesterday
All for oneeeeee
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
No, I won't
Thanks~
~~I feel like this is partly my fault but who cares~~
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I'm ~~not~~ sorry
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I'd imagine bed legs don't last with him around
*very big sip*
*big sip*
<:PharaDance:336657302914596866>
He would know his strength
and then melt them through pure body heat
Abs that could grind cheese
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
~~i need more fight scenes~~
Gen is great
Maya's stare <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Off to cleanse myself of my filth now
I was going to make a follow up joke about my homeland's outdated laws on homosexuality but I'd rather not
My thirst will kill me someday
choked on my water bottle
Godddamit
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I don't need those thoughts in my head
Goddamit I'm just about to head to the shower

Post Season 1, at least, if I'm not wrong
Anime version always sounds different from the released tracks
*immense headbanging*
and switch to this
Welp time to immediately stop my Vocaloid song
I think it's on Earth or somethin
Somewhere in the East
Borneo
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
"not available in your country"
And lots of screaming each time an episode comes out
It's been lost to the sands of time
*stockings*
big brain
Cause it's good stuff
I'm just gonna go watch a Bloom Into You episode

~~Monochrome best song fite me~~
And S2
They're all good, really
And really sad
Which is sad since I really liked Basa's one
Nobody has sung their b-track yet
if said work is singing Kimi Dake Ni while everyone looks on then I wouldn't mind tbh
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
Imagine giving everyone shiny ~~hair~~ forms and Hibiki still does most of the work
~~So you wouldn't mind TsubMari taking a backseat to Hibiki in a fight if it means them holding hands while all the time~~
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658> <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
Especially when considering the ear that hears them.
Words have a degree of power.

You mean generalizing a country isn't?

<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
~~Shem-Ha~~
like, just flick it back on
There's probably a switch for that
<@506219877724454929> it'll probably get back up and dust itself off
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
Oh that's a good emote <@!247701824335904770>

Kimi 👏 Dake 👏  Ni

<:Germain:421434126856486912>
even she can't speak, she'll sing
Hibiki has a song in her heart

*fact*
Symphogear is the best Sentai show in the post 2010s
Eat your fruit and grow big or somethin idk I don't eat healthy tbh
it's what summoned her new form
Turns out she did ate those bananas
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
We can cry and enjoy the fuck of it
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
This channel is now tainted
<@!119492161900118018> Let us raise our drinks for tomorrow
👀
I have mighty need to read that Ogawa keyword 👀
and one leg is sliiiightly shorter than the rest, so it constantly shifts
It probably squeaks every time you see move it in too
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I bet that chair doesn't even have an armrest
I can't believe we're going to see the end of this iconic trio's journey tomorrow
wanting a better ending than shows that ended poorly can still set up for failure lol
let Symphogear have a good ending in general
My last ever SympoShitpost before the show ends ;w;
The Gaijins are all crying as they gave a farewell salute to the Geahs
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>

<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>

<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
it will continue
Even if it ends
It's missing Hibiki in a crossed-arm pose
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
really now
More statue mentions
in Hibiki's case, from several people who she's recently reconnected with
Far away from the rest of your loves ones
tbh
I doubt that will be the case
what
~~and Miku probably likes to smell it~~
compared to how I will be
Tsubasa looks graceful
*shivers*
~~most of the time~~
Henshin heroes don't go to hospitals
Silly Dino
Lots of gay
tbh I didn't know shit about keywords existing until I came across this server
and the SymphoScribes too
God bless the SymphoArtists
Shemmy Fanon personality becomes canon
Shem-Ha become Shemmy
I don't want Symphogear to be another franchise that I see attempting to run past the finish line into another race
5 is a good spot

How did it feel?
canon

Gonna miss staying up till 6 AM on Saturdays
I only got on this train post-AXZ, but it's been a fun ride, and one that let me meet a lot of cool people. Won't be forgetting about it as long as Chris remains ~~plastered on every single one of my devices~~ in my heart.
Even with everything that happened, Alchemist CarolNein was still the best thing tbh

Even more disturbing are the ones on the internet that encouraged this kind of behavior
Horrible situation all around
Good luck
Looking up recent events, it appears he posted what is presumed to be a suicide note before going missing

Wasn't much of a fan of his work, but the man knew how to garner a crowd and entertain.

Oh god
This entire situation, the casualty count, all of it, horrifying. Dear god.
I can't imagine what's going to happen after this
This incident has become global news
Even most of Muslims around here think that it's complete crock
Syariah Law is complete arse
I live in an Islamic/Muslim state where most people just mind their own business, so hearing anything related to it in Western news just feels tiring
hearing people bash each other over religion
It's numbing sometimes
Caffeine is a necessity for some such as I to keep on living <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>

At least this Discord is good for screaming ~~even though I have to sacrifice sleep for it~~ <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
I need someone to scream about XV with in person
I should get my friend to finish GX already
If they're back to blaming video games for violence, I can't wait for them to go back to blaming tabletop gaming for stuff like Satanism
that's enough internet for tonight
Oh now I really am rambling
The brain is indeed a mess. At least I managed to straighten myself out and not latch onto my much younger cousin just because she was the only one talking to me during my life as a disgusting shut-in. <@284390402210136064>
This may just be midnight rambling, but I can't help but wonder how does one tell whether you love someone because you have genuine feelings for them, or because they were your friend since the days where social contact was minimal (hence you latched onto the few you had) and those feelings just so happen to linger.
Even the smallest bit of contact is great
Nothing better than laying down with the person you genuinely love anyway
Ever seen the Delightful Children from Kids Next Door? Pretty much what I'm reminded of
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
You can do it kerrik
me and my mom
Living in my home country pretty much sheltered me from anything LGBT
But yeah I'll read up on this stuff
Especially when the party accepted him for who he was and the feminine name he had
Felt fulfilling in a sense
Not gonna lie, I have a D&D character who had a thing for men, wearing glorious outfits and being a hero
Thanks
I'll read up on it then
Hmmm
Hard to say really. Especially since all the boys around me are either the typical dumb college students, guys that are old enough to be uncles or kids.
so the thought has been swimming in my head lately
Well I'm *out* of it at the moment for studies
Living in a country that has the death penalty on LGBT is... hard
Errr most likely both
But when I think about my best friend (who's been with me for a decade now), the mere thought of being with him gets me redder than a tomato
it never really satisfied me emotionally
but I've noticed that while being with women grants fulfillment on a hormonal level
since about half a decade since high school ended really
So it's a question I've been pondering for quite a while now
Is this a proper place to question my uncertainty with my sexual interests (and is this question too blunt, I really don't know how to word this without it being long to be honest)
linger
So the thought tends to
I drive an old car, to boot
So the thought of getting into a unlucky car accident tends to pop up in my head
but doing it would be so inconvenient for myself and others
Tying the noose is a common thought I get
Aye
I'm far too busy to die, is what I try to think.
and having fleeting memories of it
despite having only gone through Season 1 once
A common quote I find myself thinking of
The veil of anonymity really does wonders, doesn't it?
And not being able to return home for a while
Nothing like getting double fucked by your college administration and border patrol
Now they're telling me to wait for three more hours to pick up the passport so the fine I had to pay can be processed.
Immigration was a complete fuck though. Said they'd call me when my passport was processed. Checked the documents when I came without them calling me and I saw that it was already done yesterday.
I'm finally heading home tonight
Malaysia, Miri
I know it's not hard to do but fuck me I am dying on the inside and I don't wanna fucking step in my car unless it's to get out of this bloody country
> Stuck in country anxiously waiting for immigration to call and tell me when I can finally fucking leave

Gets text from home, "Please check the prices for this hairdryer in your area please"
I was a nerve snap away from commiting assault on inanimate objects
Nothing like being told to drive 40 minutes to immigration only to see that they're not open until Monday on arrival
Stuck in a foreign country until Monday
Should've bought some beer before entering a country that has no bars
I haven't ranted like this in a while
~~also my semester break will be spent working yaaaaay~~
So tired and very hungry
But I'm home regardless
It kinda was
One last kiss of fuck you from god before finally leaving I guess
Even when heading home I end up having someone damage the front of my car
Sometimes
Sometimes it's necessary
I'm used to it
Asian teachings honestly
Yep
I can see why
Considering the harsh working demands of our country
They want me to experience hard labour more than anything really
And we agreed that I'm keeping the cash
It's three weeks of hard labour
I should reword that
I am
So at least everything will be sorted by tomorrow
And getting paid while getting assigned to proper work
Well I'm getting a proper orientation tomorrow at least
even asked admin
Nope
Probably
Even the workers are confused
There was no submission of a CV whatsoever
While trying to get out of this position
I'm just screwing bolts together for now
I'm at my wit's end
As someone who's not had the most spectacular past few days, how should I react to being told by my parents about getting a part-time job - a day before it starts - without any input from me whatsoever.
The job involves manual labour in a shed near the jungle with people who expected someone with technical skills such as welding when I'm an office lackey at best.
Next college semester is starting in 3 weeks and 1 day. That'll be fun.
but I had no time to paint anything for the past week or two
I would paint to ease my stress
Yep
I'm just growing more and more aware of how pampered I was for most of my life as a single child, and that my parents aren't getting any younger
I don't know anymore
I'm *this* close to smoking my first cig to ease my pain but I still refuse to touch narcotics
But part-time's only lasting until the 24th (initially the 28th until I bargained for early release)
doesn't help 2 years of my post-high school life was wasted away in a college that didn't anything for me to begin with and I dropped out of Nursing college on the first week
It's frustrating because I know my parents are just trying to mend my mentality into one that can possibly survive for cash
Had this job dropped on me right after I came home from exams so I didn't take the news lightly to say the least
Part-time involves any measure of physical labor, painting furniture, etc
Fake smile's been getting heavier and heavier with each passing day
I need a drink
I certainly enjoy crippling reminders that come by and hit me with the fact that I'm 21 and still have little experience in physical labor while also not having the mentality to survive living in a world that requires one to have a mindset that lets you work yourself ragged just to get money and survive
I never knew about the concept of democracy until Iate high school
Since I live in a monarchy
Reading through all this is interesting in my eyes
God this is not how I wanna spend a morning that I should be using to recover
Apparently, the site I was redirected to - and backed out off fast - was essentially a first-stage site used to bypass email security filters before redirection to several other sites
Took a while to scan, but it's reported safe. Also did some research, and I can only assume that it's related to a multi-stage phishing campaign known as 'heatstroke'
Well, just for my sickened and tired conscious, I used AVL Pro to scan my phone this time
and the fact that I just recently installed mobile banking on my phone
I'm just worried due to past experiences
Right
the paranoia
Ugh
Several apps
I'm seeing an app on the Warning list that I don't see anywhere on my homescreen
Downloaded an anti virus software
Desperation, really
I've lost money due to phishing before
Downloading anti virus on phone regardless
it's a new phone
not that I know off
thing is there's no email I have that is associated with paypal
site loaded but I closed it immediately
Sent me to a site
How fucked am I
I clicked on a link on a 'paypal' email that wasn't regulated to my Junk Folder
while browsing through my inbox during my fever
So umm
Probably due to the side effect that is the stranded feeling one gets from staying instead a barren dorm
Is it normal to depressingly recount the final month of 2019 as several horrible things coming and ending one after the other
Probably wasn't a good idea in hindsight to come back to the dorms a week earlier than everyone else
I do intend to head out and do socialize tomorrow
Probably
Stay strong, lectric
And how much they're willing to listen
You don't know where to start and when to stop
Talking with friends can be difficult
There's only two people that I have ever talked to about that in-person in the long time I have had these feelings but it still feels like something has loosened around my neck regardless
There's something nice about being able to be open with my orientation in the presence of a friend, after years of always needing to hide such a thing among other friends and even family.
Never thought my dorm bed would feel more comfortable than my home bed
I'm just gonna try and close my eyes before my hunger gets worse and to lessen the pain of waking up later
so mind's wandering
and i'm starving
well it's midnight
oh
other mom in her 30s
My mom's in her 50s
Eh, fuck it, I can't sleep so I'll just vent here. Is it normal to become restless because of your parents getting into a fight in the next room. Coming back home for the Lunar New Year feels like a mistake all of a sudden.
The fact that Lunar New Year can get people to try and crash in other people's parties uninvited gives reason to be cautious
Hah, bullshit. I've heard countless superstitious stuff from tradition and that ain't one of em that's for sure.
Take care, Lectric
Considering I've spent the years in my hometown where stuff likes this gets used as a punchline for laughs
Would it count as irrational - that upon being asked about my interests by a few people during a hangout - and I answered that I was bi, I felt a sense of relief/happiness(?) that my answer just flew by normally and the conversation went on as normal?
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
Religious teachings are what the government is influenced by and what they like to use as the reason for having their heads so far up their asses that they can taste stomach acid
I won't bet on it honestly
Fun fact, when they put up a low where gays can be punished with stoning, a hotel in Europe(?) was boycotted due to it being under the royal family's ownership.
<@302063351767498752> Borneo. Home town, Brunei.
I'm just gonna sleep off this feeling
DnD nights feel more uncomfortable when stuff like this gets thrown around and you start to realize why you don't tell anyone
I suppose
~~now I'm just venting~~
And on the other hand, coming back home for a day and then spending a night with the old DnD group reminds me of how sick to death I am of someone being gay being the punchline for most jokes, and why I probably don't miss playing DnD back home.
Feels great
And he doesn't give a damn - which, in our sweet-and-sour friendship dynamic - is acceptance
Finally came out to my best friend, even telling him that I felt this way for years
I finally got something off my chest after years of hiding
Well
Despite painting while blaring music semi-daily in order to ease my worries, I only find myself hearing voices each time I sit down and pick up the brush. Unsurprisingly, the fact that I continue to hide in the closet from most people I once felt comfortable sharing my thoughts with is eating away at me again.
It would just be contributing to what's happening
I doubt they would give you that, to be perfectly honest.
I'm the last person that should be in this channel, but do you actually think it's a good idea or is it just a solution that you think will solve your problems only for the meantime
Shit's fucked
It's funny when there are multiple cases confirmed in your country and yet the government has yet to put a stop on the religious mass gatherings that goes on every week
This year is the first ever year I've spent National Day outside the country and I'm glad for not even realizing it
Fuck em regardless
So far nothing has actually happened - the country speaks more than it actually does things - but fuck it
that question was posed almost a year ago
aside from hiding behind the blanket of religion
To this day, my home country has yet to answer the UN for its reasoning behind stoning gay people to death
unlike a lot of things I've seen
At least it's funny
especially since it's more pricy than regular water
no one bought it
Similar to 'Kosher' for Jewish
deemed 'halal'
It's literally just bottled water
'Halal' water
> extreme religious people believing it's safe since it's not standard water
There's a brand like that where I live actually
~~I hate posting in this channel but shit's been bad lately so fuck it~~
Easier said than done sometimes
The barbarity of some people never ceases to surprise me
Local hospitals back home are getting their hand sanitizer repeatedly stolen due to shortages in the shops
make it a matter of when, not if
You can do it
nobody's going out unless they wanna be slapped with a 50k fine (11,500 USD)
Dorms are practically deserted
I'm always here to talk ~~when I'm awake~~
o u o /
You're playing a part, Kerrik
Stay safe, y'all
in many situations
That's the only reason plenty of people need
double digits where I live
102 or so back home
Godspeed
I've been seeing how things are over there
Godspeed
Wasn't there a point about Indian Railways - now closed - never having done so even times of conflict?
so I get less heated
We should move to <#449826367903629313>
I rest my case
The actual USD price they put out is 170 USD
Their recent "set" sells at 105 pounds, about 120 USD equivalent.
It's a load of crock fucking shit
please
on GW prices
Don't get me started
<@!471416654346321930>
Not as of this time, no
Your country should have an emergency line for it
Better safe than sorry
like that
Unfortunately, some people are just
to put it lightly
one hell of a headache
This is just
I am so sorry you have to deal with this
This is not coming from the same person, is it
it's just a couple of bread buns
how viable is surviving through one-meal-a-day is
Question
Well now
Blame me for not realizing what channel I had posted on just now
Sometimes you just have to live with it. You'll carry things for a long time. How you do so will be up to you, in the end.
But does it make you a lesser person when the voices in your ears and the hands of your memories grab you? No.
Speaking as someone who's been haunted by ghosts of the pasts for half a decade, closure isn't something you can always hope to expect
But Cocoa's right
I rarely come here (clicked on it by accident)
You get used to it
Do not stoke flames.
Not that I'm complaining about it (the models look amazing), but yes, it is very much the case.
Today they just announced a new Edition, and spearheading the new lore advancements is a hole new swathe of products
> Although you could very easily make the case that stuff Warhammer is consumerist, since the lore is built entirely around selling the latest and greatest model kits.
Funny you said this
There is quite a lot of focus, trust me. It's just that there so happens that *almost* everything released for smaller game modes just so happen to be usuable on regular 40k.
It's a three-part hobby that does a lot with each segment (building, painting, playing)
Regardless, gaming isn't an essential part of Warhammer
> it's designed to get you to buy a *lot* at steep prices, though
Gonna chime in and say that this varies depending on what game mode you're playing to begin with. While 'regular' 40k does require you to invest in an army, smaller skirmish games such as Kill Team allow you to play with barely much at all.
It's a nice place to be when you've lived all your life being the butt of jokes around you without no one actually realizing it.
Yep.
Also, yes TTS is great. Alfabusa is among one of my favourite 40k creators.
Oh, I'm aware this isn't the first time. But I suppose this is the camel's back eventually breaking in a sense
Anyways, I shall head off this channel again. I often feel uncomfortable and drained venting about serious topics in public.
Aside from shitbags like this, I have no regrets entering the wargaming hobby, as it's shown to have a great community aside from all this, like many fandoms.
But yes, 40k is a setting with horrific aspects and it's good that GW makes constant efforts to remind people to separate reality and their setting.
where you show how hilariously bad something is to the point people like it
I feel like it's in the same vein as the Starship Troopers movie
It's clear considering the current, recently-arisen 'voice' of said civilization (Roboute Gulliman) also feels that there is almost no point in saving such as civilization, and that the choice of not slowing its inevitable death underneath the weight of its religious dogma can be considered a reasonable one.
> Turns out how when you make a franchise that is written in character a lot of the time to glorify fascism, people who like that stuff stick around
What I will say is that the setting doesn't hold back with the fact that the Imperium is a horrendous place to live in. With each and every Edition thus far, the company has described them as the "most brutal and grueling regime imaginable" (paraphrasing), and how inept and idiotic the entire civilization is underneath all its glamour.
The ripple effects of the company's statement against people like this will continue with time
So far this 'exposure' has lasted less than a day
And I will gladly feel joy when the community doesn't *stand* for shit like this
Aye. Regardless, better to see it all be emphasized before your eyes, rather than let things stay quiet and people suffer in silence.
Disgusting people abound, but plenty of loving people as well.
Games Workshop's recent statement about their stance on discriminatory assholes has done wonders, for sure.
All my years I've waited for this person to just be shown to the fandom for the horrendous piece of shit he is. A textbook example of somehow missing the horror of the entire damn setting - that even in its current more-softer times, is still often emphasized - and embracing its disgusting qualities.
With topics such as ***(Warning)*** ||CP, glorification of fascism, degrading racial slurs, anti-trans behavior, encouraging shooters/race crimes, anti-Semetic jokes and so on, so forth (I'm still going through it myself)||
What they say is absolutely horrendous ||https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/gxhma4/to_those_saying_the_gw_post_wasnt_necessary_here/||
Warning
to the point it created a compilation of him and his moderation team
And one Lore channel with a wide reach, ArchWarhammer, essentially had his abhorrent personality fully exposed with screencaps from his Discord
For context, I'm currently in the midst of the 40k fandom - which is currently on fire after the creative company released a statement that essentially told all assholes to fuck off
After having all of his disgusting behavior exposed overnight?
May face not only having his platform being removed, but also the termination of things such as his patreon?
Do you believe one is justified in feeling nothing but absolute relief and sheer amounts of joy when a creator with a wide-reach in your fandom
No one's going anywhere.
I'd suggest taking a break, Star.
Especially when you were never there when they went.
Unforgettable numbers, no matter what.
August 10th 2012, August 29th 2018, June 12th 2020. It's amazing - no matter how wide the gap, the days you've had to see or hear about a good dog needing to be buried all feel like they're barely a second away from each other.
Bloody arrogance.
> Kept referring to us as "aspects" and not only that, but just generally gave uncalled for medical advice
Jesus Christ
The server will still be here, in the end.
Regardless, I'd suggest you take a break to catch up on your work.
That's nice.
Your teacher?
I'm sorry to hear that.
That's good
for help
I've gone to my old teachers before
Maybe give a call for advice?
Do you seek their help often?
If anything, we'd be more concerned about your well-being if you're not taking care of yourself right.
Regardless of what happens, I'm sure everyone here will still treat you with open arms.
This is a great place, but equilibrium between what you do here and what you do outside is still important.
when I was 13?
Though I started

A few weeks back
Kerry's sweet
Now that was scary
by him
Even if I got choked a few months back
I mean it took a while for *me* to catch on
Yeah
nowadays
But yeah, we link up seamlessly
before it was still useful ~~even if it did lead to violence~~
well, now better than before
I meld with Voy very well
Kinda fostered this
I suppose my upbringing uh
Errrr
Until a while back.
Honestly, I didn't either.
Voy has an insulting lack of punctuation and capitalization
also the typing gives it away
whenever you see this account
You see me in this channel
> have I met you?
Yeah
Took a while to convince the kid
We agreed to this
> Ten, does Voy know you are out here openly not being Voy?
Yeah
A kid with an attitude, but yeah
He's like a little brother to me
Goddamn
a kid
Voy's like
God no
*No*
No
A few months back was when I found some level of equilibrium
drag him out
Maybe I shouldn't
And he's off
hello

<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
not fruitful communication most of the time, admittedly
It's seamless communication

We just argue on what to do with it.
We share our knowledge

Sure, hit me.

Yeah, Voy and I made some agreement on who gets the body when and where
~~Voy would rather say unpleasant things to them though~~
Same
because I looked too bland, he said
Clothes got dragged up here
I suppose
> But can you like, make things appear yourself?
Ehhhhh
all the time
Why did he have to bring one that squeeks
It's so noisy
<:Znombu:701464491132453034>
Like this thing
Without my knowledge
Things tend to appear here
Don't know
> But you can't control the headspace with your imagination?
I uhhh
The other half got set on fire
sometimes
I feel like I'm operating with half
One is a lot
Voy has been hostile to me in the past.
Sometimes it can get hostile
Well
If anything, I have aspects formed only later in our life.
Way back
But Voy has parts of me that date
I can vaguely tell I was here 'first'
In our case
Yeah, that's convenient
My metal is heavy, I suppose.
Even though Voy's light as a feather
Good one
Heh
I'm dense, sorry.
Oh
DPRK, eh
Heh
Hi Lucy.
He's just messy relative to me.
Exaggerating, of course
Voy can't even make noodles without spilling stuff everywhere
Plural, Bi, etc.
I suppose he did the same. Except he echoed the voices of family in our heads, condemning us for who we were.
~~guilt gang~~
Good to hear after all the things I pushed on Voy after all these years, hah
That's sweet
I'm not very touchy
Voy would
Or rather
Eh, I'd give you a hug, Rad
Truly, a simple yet effective physical act of affection
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
Lotta hugs
Progress is good
Hi Lucy
Kinda dumped most of my problems on him for years
Unsurprising.
a lot better than before
yeh we good
haha
thanks
hi
sure
yeh
yeah
sometimes
crying about voices
when Ten kept coming here
but yeah that was me
so we got friendly
from a good friend a few months back
we had help
i haunted him for that
to wear
and treated me like a mask
when Ten kept pushing things me
that was me
yeh
hit me
Perhaps adding in sentences with changing speaker names?
Overall I like this idea
So I shall lessen the blow
I'm trying to be sympathetic with Rad
Mecha is objectively cooler than most things, sadly.
Sounds good.
To be honest
Plenty
Fun, too.
It's not a bad analogy.
Like headspaces
If a bit spoilery.
yus
actual food
so soon
cause no Covid cases
but things are opening up
noodles
then we ate like pigs
we had a month break when we came back home for semester break
with spending
we got better
B r u h
"we are never having less than 500 bucks"
mood
yeh
nah he just penny pinching
repetitive
it was tasty but
> Was it always one type of curry
yes
ish complicated
> Wait, was Ten around first or something?
well yes but actually no
before our face was thicc
now we sticcc
he dumb
saving money
no
butter bread
small loaves

for dinner
and then loaves of bread
for 4 months
because this dumbass had triple curry bread for dinner
hissssss
<:LeiurFlashy:674522617989955595>
Asian upbringing gang
Ten is just restrictive
das me
cat hiss
hah
im noisy about it
NSFW is fine
because it's fun
i tend to hiss at a lot of things
im more a kid so uh
bread
errrr
<:LeiurFlashy:674522617989955595>
being open helps
My condolences.
A natural result of frustration, unfortunately.
But not a sin.
Witnesses, yes.
I wouldn't place it on your shoulders as a sin.
It's unfortunate that this was the result the situation came to.
How are you feeling?
^
yeh
we bought a lotta cans
few weeks
enough to fill a stomach if you didn't do much for the day
and it was cheap per can
big can
like
it was just one part of the shelf
last month
like
we emptied out one store of its canned pork haha
store supplies matter
we know
yeh
soon
i want rice
hisssss
instant stuff is bad tho yeh
it's like rice
depends how you make em
noodles aren't always monsters
smort
unlike instant broth noodles
it's really filling tho
mii goreng
yeh
Bleh.
> Only to turn around and say the complete opposite when in public or around others
I do love it when people lie for the sake of appearing 'better' in the eyes of people who most likely wouldn't spend more than 1 minute caring about what they actually liked.
And being pissed about it is an understandable reaction.
People can be assholes, yes.
You alright, Meiyi?
Gaze not at the side road you could've taken, but at the possible junctions far ahead of you, Lectric.
thanks melua
wasn't exactly comfortable to sit through, to be honest.
aye
It's alright, Fizzy
The brain conjurs terrible things for sleep.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Spiteful, more than anything.
Jesus Christ
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
Even a slight turn of the page for us is important.
Even slightly.
We look upon how idiotic we were and try to improve.
<@!238855496797257729> <:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
As of now (3 weeks since everything went public), the Megaupload that compiles screenshots of how he carries himself is currently up for download and free to be used against him.
It took someone going into his cursed hell-hole of a Discord server, screenshotting a gallery of how it's like there, and then posting it all over the internet
Archwarhammer's shitty persona had not been revealed to the public until quite recently.
Half a decade is a long time to wait for someone's actions to get back at them, but it feels great.
I feel nothing but glee in seeing someone who has sapped money off a community for over half a decade, made amateur 'lore' videos with prejudice injected within them, and acts like some 'community hero' that admires fascism within a fictional setting that showcases the horror of it, slowly losing all his financial backing as his shit stain of a personality begins to attract the glare of people in higher places.
I will gladly hope for the best.
It's alright, Emily
No, he just has a tendency to grab biscuits.
I'm merely glad the only times I feel him act on our body while I front nowadays is when we argue on what to buy for food
It was the lowest point between us
But I felt it.
It was for a few seconds.
> How does that work, Ten?
Felt my breathing cut off suddenly
> I'm pretty sure she still struggles with everything she's done
And I'm sure plenty of us will gladly smile alongside her regardless
I still feel the marks of when Voy tried to strangle me.
People change
I just work hard to give that impression
Not really in our case.
<@84811738653929472> Thank you
Words are easy to give, but godspeed.

Godspeed
Take your time.
Take your time, Rei.
No matter how small.
In times like this.
It's good to have company
Indeed.
You don't have to answer.
That slowly built up
A lingering thing?
Has this been
I'm sorry, I'm unfamiliar with topics such as this.
Time that will eventually come to pass.
It will take time.
A difficult thing
I assure that the voices are
It's good to cry, Rei.
(this gets a bit much) ||and fall into the drain||
it tried to fly away but then its hurt wing made it collide with a wall
but we ended up scaring it
we stopped and tried to help it
we saw a birdie with a hurt wing
and then when were near the dorms
we were grocery shopping
bird didn't deserve ||to drown slowly||
animals are honest
ten got more worked up over him accidentally killing a bird this afternoon
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
"but there are obituaries i would read with pleasure"
"i don't wish death on people"
ten's favourite thing to say
so ten and i don't exist eh
and i thought i say stupid shit sometimes
and vibe
imma just shitpost on the internet
woops
my fault for derailing in the first place
it's fine
accident and all
think too much about what happened
errr
hope he doesn't
the sight of a flock of birds on the way to lunch made him panic
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
after shutting himself in the room to paint for 5-6 hours and having dinner
he's sleeping
and then for the next half hour was just panicking while were doing stuff
but he froze
he could've helped it since it was barely a few meters away from us
||spasming and everything||
||ten watched it slowly drown||
a quiet head is freaky
had that happen couple of times
that sounds scary
mood
Apologies for typing so much about nothing.
It's hard for people to understand when you play everything of as a joke.
It's alright.
Harley and Sasha. Sweet girls they were and are.
We've had to face the news of losing a cherished member of the family all of a sudden upon returning home. And we've had to experience of slowly seeing a loved one just physically deteriorate over the course of a month, no matter what medicine you employ, or what treatment you attempt.
Now we're stuck outside our home country, and the anxiety builds in the month of August once more.
Both times.
It's hard to accept that you were never there when they passed.
Sweet girls, they were. Best companions in a time where you had none, even in school. We'd always trust a dog over a person anyday.
August 11th. August 29th.
Even though it happened several years in-between
We've lost the closest things we've had to family on the month of August.
To explain things.
When you suddenly can't hold back emotions that linger beneath.
In the middle of an episode when he said that.
We were
Of having lost those you care about.
Feel so much more palpable when it's nearing the two anniversaries in the month
Feelings of loss, mourning, and so much more just.
<@!457268466429329429> August is a rough month for us.
ymmv but god it's uncomfortable
went through that before
yeet
tell em to cut that shit out tbh
Neat.
When you lift a rock, disgusting creatures tend to scurry everywhere.
> So don’t be a jerk!
Oh, how I wish this was something that more people would find easy to do.
"WhY WoN'T yOU LEt My BIgGOted aSS Stay"
it's like that one stupid fucking belief where not letting assholes in yer community somehow makes you non-inclusive
fucked up situation in the end tbh
"We'RE NorMALIziNG iT sO IT's OKAy"
(shout-out to snipe & wib cause they're real wholesome and indirectly helped ten and i figure out we're pan instead of bi)
imagine reading a wiki for your lore vids lmao
luetin just shits all over him in terms of actual lore vids
everyone else just got better than him (which isn't hard i know)
just a fuck with a big ego
arch ain't the biggest anyway
called that shit, but hoo boy the shit that got shown was disgusting
couple months back
we posted that here
we know
plenty of stupid fucking people but i'm glad shit's getting better over time
"hurrr duurrr they don't care about flesh since they replace it, so they should still use he/she"
i remember people getting their nuts twisted when a story about a culture (Adeptus Mechanicus) that praises ascendancy from flesh to machine, is fine with their people using non-binary terms
people can be real fucking stupid even when shit seems obvious
https://intoomanywords.com/2017/12/05/why-trap-is-a-bad-term/
plenty of assholes be just hiding piece of shit opinions behind 'memes'
fucking animemes
Plenty of cunts out there, to be brief.
Indeed.
It astounds me that some people can be proud of their insistent ignorance.
Refusal to learn is the shitty part.
i vaguely remember our dad telling us to not be in the same room whenever south park was on his computer (in the short time he had it)
i wouldn't be able to say any of what she said that easily/calmly
god the woman in the last few seconds
i remember not even being 8 or 10 yet
Jesus Christ
That's my case, at least.
It never feels too long ago.
Never got to say goodbye, so, make those moments count.
I remember going through this almost exactly 2 years ago.
Cherish the time.
All too well.
I understand the sentiment.
You'd think someone wouldn't be able to say that without a hint of sarcasm.
Ugh.
I suppose the signs varies from situation to situation.
It was difficult to look her in the eyes.
So much.
I remember my girl shaking during the last days.
Is she shivering?
What channel do you think you are in right now
Anyway, how is she right now?
Nuker, please.
Ah
No way to calm her down?
I see.
Won't move, right?
They just
Aye.
we're all ears
we just don't wanna have someone else end up like us
will hurt for a long time
not being by their side
be by their side

<@!160142617940590594> <:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
It hurts because I'd trust them over a person anytime.
Even when you have to carry them just for them to be able to move.
Even when you have to start cleaning ||blood|| from their fur.
Don't stop trying.
Oh, how familiar all of this is to us.
Did you have to handfeed her the medicine?
That's good.
Cherish the time left with her.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Godspeed, Allison.
Glad to see that you two are alright.

Some people are so easy to resort to being abhorrent pieces of shite the moment their toy gets taken away.
Fucking disgusting.
Time is a bitter medicine.
So as we stand now, I do appreciate this place.
We entered this server as one.
closing everything is a pretty general statement considering not every country does the same thing despite saying the same thing
doesn't mean what ye doing is fucking pointless
just because shite happens despite what ye did
and we can *improve*
because we can *control* the damn thing
a reoccuring thing
reviewing safety measures is like
m8 we study occupational safety and health
control yer fucking deaths
if you can control yer fucking deaths
it's like saying fuck seatbelts just because people die in car crashes
fuck that line of thinking

there's two 'kais' in this chat
not taking any action is as much action as an action itself mate

ah yes gonna let people enter the grave cause ye can't bother to give a shit when ya could
But the results are always worth it.
It takes effort.
My condolences.
But I feel that it makes its better moments more apparent.
Of course.
This server is good company, indeed.

The fear can't help but linger within, huh?
Afraid that you'll unintentionally hurt them in the end?

<@!170641480791228417> <:ElsaPat:637356110415659063>
Ah.
Since you're expecting the opposite.

I can understand.

Godspeed, Kai.
Still getting used to that feeling of seeing something affectionate your fingers wrote, but not feeling anything that was supposed to be behind them.
Thanks for the advice.
These thoughts were just occurring to me more so than usual, due to upcoming things.
Makes sense.
Despite how things were before
I suppose it's only natural that some bonds just wither away
Ah.
But I suppose it's not a surprising thing that some bonds just don't feel the same anymore, is it?
Sometimes I look back on bonds formed between others and us, back when we were just I. Now, most of the time, things have gone thankfully well.
Could I ask for some advice?
Kai.
Do get some actual rest tonight, Lectric. For your health.

Please don't.
Rei, please.
be certain of that?
How can you
...
ten and i know a lotta things that we can't say tbh
carefuls
lotta things are in da dark so like
careful what ya say, pls
btw
thanks y'all
but the doctor says she'll be aight
coulda been faster
they managed to get to her quick for help
so like
rei's got a nice sister-in-law/doctor watching over her
I appreciate the effort.
Thank you for the words.
But she's currently in the care of her doctor.
I won't disclose much.
At the moment.
stable
Rei's
Everyone.
Thank you.
We appreciate your efforts.
Everyone.
Rei. Please, rest up. Please, I'm begging you.
Rei, no....
Rei, please.
Rei.
Rei, please just... rest. Please.
Rei. Please.
The flesh vessel is a strange thing.
I rarely ever feel so. Meanwhile, Voy...
I do hope you're doing fine as you are now, at least.
> I mean, I'm against it.
Oh.
still concerned about that.
I'm
You are.
Is there heavy consideration for this?
Might?
<:shibapat:681170886241681439>
Gods.
It's been a reoccuring thing.
Worrisome
Which makes the specificity of these gifts
It's one of Rei's hobbies
Indeed.
I really hope this trouble would end soon.
Regardless.
I see...
Has there been any progress in trying to catch the person?
I'm really concerned with how exactly they know
....
<@84811738653929472> <:shibapat:681170886241681439>
<@84811738653929472> <:shibapat:681170886241681439>

We all have things behind us.
<@84811738653929472> <:shibapat:681170886241681439>
Acknowledging your own thoughts is also important.
Acting upon them is a very different from merely having the thought.
Indeed.
<@!605753436763586573> <a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936>
Slightly relieving, if anything.
to hear.
That's good
What's going on?
Rei?
What on earth just happened
stay safeu
<@!605753436763586573> <a:HibikiHug:656221774240808960>
ughhhhh
before anything bad happens
we hope yah can catch that person
but yeh
gods
we're so frustrated with not being able to help tbh
siiiiiigh
<:KirikaWorry:695044370696765510>
they know when to not come
> He/she would never come whenever my brother or my dad waited all night.
<@!605753436763586573> that's scary
People will latch on to any popular term and eventually overuse it until it's lost all meaning
Rei deserves all the care, after all.
<@605753436763586573> <a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936>
Rei.
Take care.
Rei, no.
That doesn't change the way I see you.
I know. Still.
Pardon?
<@605753436763586573> <a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936>
<@161155855524298752> <:shibapat:681170886241681439>
See "cringe" for example.
Let's not get into that territory, thanks.
I'm holding my breath for when that person gets caught.
Stay safe, Rei.
Anyway. Back to the topic on hand.
You've been keeping practice, at least?
But I wouldn't mind.
Drastic
Sigh
No luck thus far
It's been several weeks
Mm.
I can't wait for that bloody person to be caught.
The fact that they know your specific hobby is already worrisome.
But no less frustrating
It's been weeks at this point
Another envelope.
God
<@!161155855524298752> <:shibapat:681170886241681439>
<@84811738653929472> <:shibapat:681170886241681439>
Any results from the camera?
Sigh
God knows what they're actually laced with.
The envelopes.
Good. Still, they're clearly dangerous.
I'm heavily concerned with what those things are laced with.
Ugh.
'Addictive'?
Still suspicious, regardless.
Vexing.
The fact that they've been at this for a long time now is
I remember that.
Before receiving all these letters
You mentioned that you lost a perfume bottle before, yes.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to tend to dinner.
<@!605753436763586573> <a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936>
In the end. Stay safe as always, Rei.
I shall continue to hold my breath.
Hopefully the apprehension of that person provides some sort of progress
Regardless.
It's a sick joke
Indeed.
Vexing.
Sigh
Progress, regardless.
Mm.
Still
A hired third-party
Courier, huh
I understand the feeling.
I understand the feeling.
It's alright, Aya.
<@238855496797257729> <:shibapat:681170886241681439>
That's rather ominous.
Alright
Ah
I worry about how exactly they're figuring out everything they need to know to send.
They're getting more and more specific
Those envelopes
But know that the time spent with your dog was the best to them.
It's going to be hard.

Lovely one.
My condolences

Don't be afraid of talking to any of us, even if it's just for the sake of conversation.

Take your time grieving.
<:shibapat:681170886241681439>
Take your time.
It's alright, Rei.
Rei?

Don't be afraid to talk to any of us for company.

We're just lucky that we're living in the least-effected states over in the East, thus far.
32.7 million?
To think the numbers of new cases in Malaysia were once double digits.
Holding in-person elections last year sure was a good idea.
A record of 3000 new cases in Malaysia today.
And no one else but us is outside of home's borders.
At least home is clean.
Fuck.
Nothing like hearing your state go from single digit cases to 94 cases in a day.

oh nah this is a new thing im startin to talk about
fuck
why were getting things we wish were just bad jokes
it's already past april 1st
A Chinese family.
And only "son"
As we are, we are the "first son" of our parents.
Certain cultural expectations don't help.
A similar concept is used in accident reporting for Occupational Safety.
i.e. The increased occurrences of x being due to x not being actually looked out for (or just actively ignored) until some point of time.
No. It's a general occurrence that happens in many fields.
It's not hard to spend two decades of your life trying to believe you were something other than what you felt when what you felt is often the target of a slur, joke or treated as nonsense by everyone around you everyday.
And instead tries to fit everything into either a square or circular hole.
Alongside a culture that refuses to teach you about things you are.
Peer pressure and culture can stuff you in the closet hard.
I feel as though any attempt to genuinely explain the terminologies would fall on deaf ears in posts like these.
Smells like bait.
X: Even if I doubt it.
X: Hopefully it'll be this easy coming out to others we think we can trust.
X: Dammit, I'm crying.
X: That's one parent down.

Glad they moved away eventually.
We didn't understand the language, but they were not good neighbours.
They decided to pick a fight with her while she was sending me to school.
No.
More women than men.
To our memory
She's been with both men and women.
||Being less than 10 years old and seeing your mother's girlfriend being beaten up by men on the way to school doesn't leave you easily||
We notice men would gladly pick a fight with a woman not in a dress
We do have memories of our mother's girlfriend getting flak for being very masculine in appearance.
Bastards.
I'm beginning to question if they did watch Symphogear themself.
Sigh.
Mental gymnastics.
What a shitshow.
Ah, the unexpected sequel.
They can no longer hide the fact that aliens ||say trans rights||
Couldn't be bothered to just admit they're being shite.
Scrambling to find so many reasons to try and justify being an asshole.

Great outfit
While the full extent of her situation is horrific (her father can barely be called human), I don't believe people would appreciate global suffering being compared to a celebrity's pain.
Marathon playlists of cat videos until you're tired.
They just happen to be gay.
Simply being gay doesn't make you do such things
Gay and straight people grope butts, Cecil...
A person can claim that they're not homophobic as much as they want, it means absolute jack when the thought of gay people living their live gets them frothing at the mouth.
Actions always speak louder than words.
That mentality is rife in Brunei.
You'd be surprised how many people think being gay immediately indicates that a person does certain things: men being feminine, girls being tomboys, etc.
The sheer mental gymnastics people can do to claim that they're not homophobic can be impressive.
I've seen 'opposed to homosexuality' and 'disagreement with the gay lifestyle' a dime a dozen around Muslim circles.
<:ElsaPat:637356110415659063>
The climate certainly is already
Which is a reason to try and live long, in itself.
Until we can change our circumstances, it's not a high possibility.
As morbid as it sounds
Living long isn't exactly on our list
It's strange to read this conversation, honestly
Tis a shitty feeling, to be blunt.
And the futility of the waiting that follows.
We know full-well what it means for important people to just incomprehensibly vanish
It's something we've accepted. It's why we can't really do that in good conscious.
Getting out of here is a main drive for us.
You wouldn't want to be here anyway
It's a reality we're well-aware of.
X: Happens every single time.
X: Honestly, I'm not suprised when parodies fly over the heads of fashies.
X: When Vyn posted the link earlier
X: Have any of you actually gone into the entire song, I wonder
X: Considering we spent most of our life riding wherever life throws us to, sometimes we do. All the futile chasing done just to not look bad compared to relatives while the mind slowly shatters. Could barely call that living.
I understand that sentiment.

We're numb to the point that it's hard to see feel anything except a downward spiral.
Is this gaslighting
"You being transgender is not the problem"
Also 
"When you told us you are transgender, we decided to no longer send you for a degree"
It's going to be a long time until we can claw our way out of this hellhole
Hopefully
Maybe we're just too numb at this point.
At this point, I'm not surprised about the curve balls that get thrown at us.
The first trans-masc person we meet in real life, and this is how it turned out.
All the paranoia with people who genuinely just want to help Voy and I.
Their hardcore masculinity as a 'tomboy'
Would explain a lot, really. Their inability to understand our desire to be fem.
turns out to also be a trans person, i.e. our mother's 'girlfriend'.
the person trying hardest to suppress our identity as a trans person
How do you process the fact that
<:ElsaPat:637356110415659063>
I don't how to begin nor do I know to end it. All I know is that we're skipping work today to process news that I honestly wish I didn't end up being the bearer of today.

Reitia, or most knew her as Rei, was a previous member of this server, but due to certain circumstances, she had to be barred from it. In spite of all that, I wished the circumstances following that incident had turned out to be better for her, as I now have to write this to announce that she had departed 10 and a half hours ago after another period in the Intensive Care Unit.

Both her and I knew a long time that this would happen someday, considering her worsening health. Still, in that time, she did enjoy her time here in the server, and did ask me to send her regards this place a while ago. I didn't then out of hesitation, but now I do it for the sake of the departed. I miss her.

Good
No, sadly.
I appreciate the words.
Rejected quite often, from what we've heard
Currently am.
Manager of food distribution here, essentially.
Yes
She can threaten to withdraw support and screw them over if she wishes.
Our mother's partner backs the company financially.
They have the power to do so.
"Don't make me angry" after being refused the $200
Since they know the company owner
They threatened to take away our delivery job
Well
They scoffed.
Tried $100
Our life is only where it is because of them, and they don't want us detouring to a path we want.
That's essentially the case.
But yes
Her/them.
A reaction to us donating clothes, for context.
But these days? The mind refuses to.
There was a time we thought we could mend things with our mother

much social power.
And our mother and her partner has
We live in a small country
And most likely abandoning a lot.
I would mean uprooting a lot of things.
It's hard to see someone as your mother when she's been gone for most of your life.
Nor do they intend to address the years of neglect in our childhood.
But it's clear that the future they want doesn't involve us being trans.
Sure, she and her partner has paid for our car, our phone, our college
Especially in an extremely conservative country.
It sunders this mind to be saddled with the responsibility for taking care of our mother, despite it being clear that such a future has no room for us being who we are.
None of it feels real.
Honestly.
we're in
trying to determine what kind of situation
Just
Honestly, we're not looking for a solution
In the end, it always leads back to our mother's house.
Ran there for a few days after the response to us coming out.
Tried before
House is rather small
Mother especially doesn't like him after breaking the marriage long ago.
He has little impact.
But we don't want to bring him into a situation like this.
Our father is neutral with us.
Our father and mother separated long ago.
I will admit that we're very much distant from our mother. Hard to stand her presence. Especially after the horrid response to us coming out as trans.
and expectations.
They're definitely pushing boundries
We're Chinese but
Cultural expectation assures that the child should give money to their parents.
Happy to see you back
Therapy and police statements in later days.
Going to be under care of the extended family for a while.
Sorry if we made you worry.
Will get back when we can.

Police statement in an hour.
Police statement tomorrow. Ugh.
There's a part of us that enjoys this considering we know they're already paying thousands for a court case that we don't know much about, but they're going through regardless.
Thankfully, we can grab PDFs regarding our earnings from the company.
Mother's partner tried to claim we make big bucks a month on deliveries.
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
That could be applied to several laws here, honestly.
Thankfully, we have the extended family to assist us.
It's part of written laws here.
Sigh. Paperwork is going to be a headache in a few days.
Boggles the mind that attempted suicide counts as a crime.
So we should be sleeping fine, at least.
Three days worth of xanax.
Mm.
Suicide attempts are a crime here
It went fine
Is is strange to feel hesitant about a job offer - i.e. a chance at continuing on our life - when you're still in the process of absorbing the fact that you nearly ended your life less than 10 days ago?
We're glad to have you around, though.
If I'm not wrong, Star has no access to this channel

Poor Cert.
<:ElsaPat:637356110415659063>
Mm.
Haven't seen them since, too.
Been a month and a half since the attempt
But it sure does feel like a piss in the drink.
It's not making us relapse into ||suicide||
Welp, there goes the lingering feeling that I should maybe try to mend things with them soon
*sips Milo*
Got a few lovely posts from the mother's partner.

Went on Facebook to check some local shop prices
Just going to go paint.
A complicated feeling considering we doubt they'd show any respect for her identity.
Never a person we wished to outlive, being younger than her.
It's hard to believe how long we've known her at this point
Rest assured that she's alright.
Nya
For all the performative acts of progress she speaks, she sure loves allying with people that will gladly take away human rights from queer people.
If it's one thing that keeps us going, it's to see Rowling slowly being recognized as the cretin of the woman she is.
Stay safe, Lily.
It would be just as uncomfortable to read if you had typed "and the heir is apparently black, hah, like they give a fuck about the cause, doubt things will change"
Could do better by pointing out someone's actions rather than aspects of their identity as a reason to rail against them
The cruelty is the point

And believe in their strength to get past this.
Have faith in your family's ability to persevere, if anything.
Hopefully she comes out alright.
Sadly, it's not matter of deserving, as terrible as it is.
Isn't Bill Maher the boomer that ranted at a girl for rightfully pointing out how fucked everything is

Actual witchcraft worries
Lovely.

But we have little patience for people trying to play 'religious cop' in an already shite country

Oh, it's not an official unit
Br*nei making hotlines for queer behaviour when the country went 2 days without water in 2 out of 4 of its entire districts
V: we have half a mind to toss it out into the wilds to get it flooded with trolls
V: if we had the contact number
Br*nei is a 1950s country living in the 2020s
I shouldn't be surprised they used 'transsexual' but goddamn
'un-Islamic behaviour'
A hot line to report if you see you-know-what
This country has a fucking hotline for stuff like this. Really now.

Again, that's just movie discussion.
lol
Endgame just didn't give a damn about showcasing the effects of the Snap outside of Earth
I mean, her responsibility encompasses multiple words outside of Earth so her powerset isn't a worry with just how much relies on her
Okay. Buddy cop dynamic with Fury.
~~Definitely preferred Infinity War though~~
Being overpowered isn't a justification to not give scenes that focus more on characters rather than physical strength but that's just a movie discussion at this point
Endgame was disappointing in how they had an opportunity to better flesh out her character. But it feels like they caved in to fan hatred and just made her not appear until the last 10 minutes.
But nah
If being vocally political got you heat, then Chris Evans (Captain America) should be a big target by now with how vocal he is about the Presidency
She's just an easy target because "woman" and how she's willing to point out how a girl-centric movie (Can't remember the name of it since it's not an MCU film) was mostly criticized by old men
And it's barely anything compared to all the other actors in Hollywood
People blow it out of proportion
Nothing about him seems real, but it sadly is.
I think he also pissed in his basement in reaction to his wife having dinner without him?

Look at the online video reactions of how people like Matt Walsh react to a LGBT club shooting
Because you're specifically talking about right-wingers?
Have you not listened to any of the rhetoric that Matt Walsh, Ben Sharpie, Blair White spout
Let alone the fact that it's yet another attempt at kicking trans people while they're done
The fact that it's even being displayed already makes it viable for discussion
"Nothing can go wrong with this"
"This law shall ensure that you can only use a fire extinguisher once your house is halfway burned down"
For anyone that tries to insist they're just 'joking around, bro'
> Her anti-trans tweets went especially viral. She called on her followers to contact schools that were allowing “boys in the girls bathrooms” and pushed the false conspiracy theory that schools were installing litter boxes in bathrooms for children who identify as cats. She also purported that adults who teach children about LGBTQ+ identities are “abusive,” that being gender-nonconforming or an ally to the LGBTQ+ community is a “mental illness,” and referred to schools as “government run indoctrination camps” for the LGBTQ+ community.
> Libs of TikTok gained more prominence throughout the end of last year, cementing its spot in the right-wing media outrage cycle. Its attacks on the LGBTQ+ community also escalated. By January, Raichik’s page was leaning hard into “groomer” discourse, calling for any teacher who comes out as gay to their students to be “fired on the spot.”

A 12-minute video going over it

<:StaresAtYou:622844417518206986>
The gameplay has nothing to do with what's going on, Cypher.
Somehow more Ls than Games Workshop has taken recently and that's impressive
They had the gall to have a "Oh, we rolled a Nat 1" joke when they tried to enforce rules that would legally permit them to steal work from third-party content without royalties
> “you’re going to hear people say that they won, and we lost because making your voices heard forced us to change our plans. Those people will only be half right. They won—and so did we.”
Came off like a supervillain speech
WotC put out a horrible attempt at PR earlier in the day
<a:PetTheFenny:933400780893995058>
Bad omen for that zoo
Really now
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
<:kermitsip:865927558007488532>
Yep
<a:PetTheHibiki:753122237359587358>
Tsk
If you're dealing with well-known figures like J.K. Rowling, you're expected to go over every nook and crevice to point out to the common person why you despise her
Feels strange
A lot's changed since then
Been precisely a year now since our ||attempted suicide|| (self-harm)
<:kermitsip:865927558007488532>
Second paragraph honestly explains why this shit-hole gladly let him in here. The Ministry of Religious Affairs wouldn't complain about his rhetoric.
> “On May 16, 2022, Somad, accompanied with six individuals came to Singapore, claiming to be on holiday purpose, but his entry was denied and he was deported to Batam on the same day. Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs cited his past "extremist and segregationist" preachings as the reason for the government's refusal to let him enter the country.[27] Somad was not the first religious preacher to be denied entry or banned from Singapore, for example, an American Christian preacher Lou Engle was also banned from entering in 2018.[28] The Singapore Ministry of Home Affairs added that Somad, in the past, had preached that suicide bombings are legitimate in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and are considered "martyrdom" operations; and he has also made comments denigrating members of other faiths, such as Christians, by describing the Christian crucifix as the dwelling place of an "infidel jinn (spirit/demon)".[29]
> 
> Somad then reacted in a video, claiming that "Singapore actually belongs to the Malays", and that Singaporeans of other races are just immigrants there. He added, "In the future, God willing, the time will come, perhaps in the era of our grandchildren, the ones who will be in power are the Malays and that country shall be conquered back, so they will feel the pain, impudent!"[30] He also remarked that if "all Indonesians take a piss together and channel it towards Singapore, the island will sink".[31] His supporters spammed the social media accounts of various Singapore's political leaders and governmental organizations, with several threatening to wage a repetition of the September 11 attacks on Singapore.[32][33] Somad also added that he would not "give up" in trying to visit Singapore.”
<@161155855524298752> Are you familiar with this speaker?
The fuck is wrong with our country
> "Take back Singapore"
> "We will attack Singapore 9/11 style"
> "Singapore must be bombed. We will destroy Singapore. Just one missile and it is finished"
> "Muslims who buy from Starbucks will go to hell"
> "Listening to music is Satan"
> "Muslims should not travel in Red Cross ambulances with crucifixes because it has a cross"
> "Fight for ISIS, if you are a suicide bomber, you can die as a martyr and receive rewards in heaven"

Jessie Gender makes great content to begin with.
More dog-whistling, really.
Matt will be assimilated for their failure
Especially in court.
Matt Walsh's voice is auditory torture, but it's definitely fun seeing him getting clowned on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3469PmDVPA&ab_channel=conure
Man, Girls und Panzer is great

Only halfway through the series, but it's a fun time
I'm not ready
Oh god today's the last episode?
Badly translated as in translated straight from Japanese to Chinese to English
For context, they're just lines from a really badly translated manga
The fact that it wasn't intentional is the best part
Duwang is sacred
But Part 5 was terrible to read back when proper translations weren't out yet
Part 3 did have an almost year-long break halfway through it, compared to the other Parts which ran non-stop
Didn't help that SC has the longest anime so far
Y'all probably gonna fall asleep an hour into that
It's surprisingly helpful
Not gonna lie, this got me into actually getting fit
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920> Misery loves company
Demon Lord for my Daughter looked cute until I looked up a spoiler|| where they end up getting together romantically||
sometimes, people just don't need a reason
Human can be vile and petty
*Tsubasa fans would like to know your location*
Pretty much hit the nail on the head
*approves in mono-eye*
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
Helps that half the cast aren't even Gundam fans themselves lol
It's amazingly watchable as both a Gundam fan and not a Gundam fan
~~she's also voiced by Hibiki but that's a fun fact~~
she ended up genuinely enjoying the hobby
Well, there *was* one character that was using Gunpla as way to gain attention as an idol
The characters even being representations of different Gundam fandoms
From the way shots were drawn, the dialogue, character cameos, titles and everything
Build Fighters season 1 was pretty much a love letter to everything Gundam
so it got wild
G was a special case of being the first non-Universal Century show
The military part is pretty much the main draw
Unless you're Kira Yamato
when the enemies get better machines to close the tech gap, the pilot at that point has gotten better that the tech gap (or lack of one) doesn't matter
sometimes it's just a better machine making up for a shit pilot
Kinda varies in the show
and lack of resources
unless they still broke down because poor logistics
That could've helped Zeon win the war
~~even if his father got kooky from oxygen deprivation much later~~
And his father built the thing
The Gundam was an unbreakable punching bag to Char and his Zaku II
Amuro was pretty garbage at the start of Gundam 0079
it's one thing the fandom will *never* ignore
multiple times
He survives a mech blowing up in his face
and yet it's goes about the same as other Gundam wars
vs average joes
a race of super soldiers
That setting was wack
~~G Gundam is great anyway~~
I can imagine not liking Gundam with that reasoning
Yep. Their skill can vary.
it's 50/50 really
Some protags are actual soldiers
Depends
Most hilarious one is getting thrown down a mountain while also walking on a crutch at a time
and gets consistently tossed around by Kamille
The man debuts by getting punched in the face for insulting someone's name
Zeta Gundam's Jerid
Well Gundam did have one rival where the main character just consistently beats
~~doujins were everywhere so yeah I guess~~
~~SEED girls weren't exactly well-written~~
rip Savior
that lasts 5 seconds against Kira
then he gets a Gundam
sometimes he had plot armor
Athrun had it bad
to an extent
Kira and Lacus were self-inserts of the main writer and director
then again
Oh, SEED
But yeah, CGI mechs are hard asf to pull off
I remember Majestic Prince ~~but I was so young that everything felt fleeting~~
still jarring
I'm aware
Turn A Gundam looked great though
But hey, at least the MC's voice actor gave us Ninja BrOgawa
I'll never understand it either
lol
mechs with literal aimbot
such as bringing out some of the biggest hax machines in the franchise
SEED is a whole can of worms
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
It's almost something meant for Premium
but there's too much of a good thing
I like the Unicorn
~~pls no P-Bandai~~
It's a great design, but the HG does it no justice
Got I want an MG G-Self
especially since tech from it got showcased quite well in Build Fighters
Though an OVA would be great ~~to sell more Blue Destiny kits~~
It was a video game to begin with
Nope. Just a manga that only adapted part of its storyline.
in the span of a movie
too bad it's basically a full-length tv show
F91 had a nice concept
Victory was fucking wack
which I found a bit funny
just Hathaway's fate
I don't know much about the story
Yeah, Sunrise had a fair bit of meddling in Victory
~~not gonna lie, i'm gonna buy that Penelope Gundam because it's a big boi~~
with the advent of Hathaway's Flash
Though that could change
Too bad late UC barely gets any love
giving the main characters even more ridiculous firepower
then SEED comes along and casually brings in two of its own versions
I remember Stardust Memory introducing the massive MS attachment, the D. Orchis, and everyone in-universe were freaking out about it
what's going on <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Classic guncannon
~~it's 6 30 PM uwu~~
Fair point <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
by right, that should be a 5-4
I still don't understand the mindset of mediocrity being placed as 7 or 6
ratings are for dummies most of the time anyway <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Good idea
Typical trolls going around voting 1/10 on episode ratings
trying to bombard scores for an anime
Imagine spending your life
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
~~he directs MHA now, so he's probably never coming back~~
Too bad a change in director changed all of that
or gunpla
amazingly watchable without fuck'all knowledge of the franchise
Build Fighters Season 1 was lightning in a bottle
lol
*picks up saxophone* T-Thunderbolt?
Next work out music <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
also Hyaku Shiki
*Big Zam time*
The whole thing gave me mixed feelings
it wasn't fully translated at the time
I read a bit of it
*Katz*
compared to
Kamille and Fa were fine
My only experience with LBX was playing it on the 3DS
*leave it there forever*
put it on your shelf
You find a pose you like
Just sitting on your shelf makes a grand impression
regardless the GP03 is mainly a display piece
Looking up reviews on kits can help you decide whether it's worth it or not
*Absolute unit*
as well
massive
It's
Yep
1/144, 1/100 and 1/60 are the numbers that you should be looking out for
or grenades
RG can either be bricks
The result of this can vary
give us more, *cowards*
They gave us the Psyco Gundam
The Japanese fandom can do amazing things
People have probably attempted that
it's a night of tears for me
still not playable
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
i'll cry myself to sleep
if it still isn't playable
~~this is a fun conversation but i'm gonna sleep now~~
another month of waiting for suffering amirite
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Just gonna save that, don't mind me
oh hey Phos
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
you mean the harem where Banagher becomes a black hole that sucks in every girl nearby
~~A punching bag can knock me into a wall probably~~
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
More progress than Hibiki at least
Sadly no
but the voice acting is just superb
The manga got me into shape long ago
I now scream **Muscular** after every work out routine
Time for a rewatch eh <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
It's good workout motivation
cause mc special uwu
in the end, a society where only females can wear power armor is just something that's there in the background
The show would improve dramatically if it just had the girls doing gay shenanigans inbetween plot
~~the show would be better if it just had the german girl and char as main characters~~
Sold like hot cakes, last I heard
At least we got Kemurikusa out of it
Trying to find that r/anime thread that explains everything
hard to replicate
Overall, KemoFure and Kemuri have an endearing charm
It was a quite addition
Feels melancholic while being cheerful
The direction of Kemuri is great overall
||Rin's smile at the end is the most beautiful thing ever though||
I just see episode threads
Nope
the thread, at least
Doesn't help that it's a year old
I can't find it <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
~~Rin best girl~~
It felt like an amalgamation of Girls Last Tour and Kemono Friends
It's probably going to get lost in time
but that's info I heard years ago
Last I heard about ZnT, notes about how it was supposed to end exist
Not really average
~~an average D&D session is typically more compelling than Goblin Slayer to be honest~~
Where's the one character that acts as the resident asshole just to make the MC look better by comparison
the ones with.... you know what... are rightly despised
Every season is the best and worst season <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
To paraphrase one of them, going back to work this quickly after what happened is their way of not letting the arsonist win
Do note that several workers have already gone back to their daily routine
Japanese work ethics are hell of a thing
None that I know of, at least
I don't believe any of their projects get delayed
Girls und Panzer <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
~~oh someone remembers it~~~
~~they're probably cheaper anyway~~
Some look good straight out of the box anyway <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
"Damn. These things don't require glue *and* come in colour."
It's why Warhammer 40k players think Gunpla builders are lucky
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Nope
~~and way too expensive~~
Way too tall

~~i'm just gonna post it and then stop before i derail this channel any further~~
I consider myself damn lucky
Yeah, I'm lucky to find a group that aren't made of pieces of shit
~~and not fun to play against with infantry~~
Those things are massive
Unless you buy a Titan/Imperial Knight
~~Stay with gunpla, kids, it's much easier on your wallet and sanity~~
~~Too bad I've been sucked into 40k~~
I miss gunpla
Makes me realize how far it's been since the glory of season 1
That I can feel genuine nostalgia for Build Fighters
The fact that it's been so long
The Loto is cute as hell and badass at the same time
Thank god...
>Someone else likes guntanks
~~ALICE deserved better~~
Just looking at that thing makes me twitch for gunpla again
Ah
Ex-S is a beauty
I'm sad the Gundam Mk V doesn't get any love outside of the games
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Just looking at the detailing on that thing, let alone the size
Yes
Holy fuck
Daemons of the God of Excess, after all
but they exist
Not as big as the one in your image
Yep
~~I mean there are giant titty daemons so that's pretty close to one tbh~~
Oh
"proxy minis"
That's a thing some people do
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Combined with a fuck-ton of GMs backed up by Mobile Coffins
Exactly
and it punched through most of Zeon's heavily armored units anyway ala the Dom
but still packed a punch at close range
It was shit in long range
They were stuffing in new pilots into machines that they couldn't even handle
Some of the time
Most of the time
Good eyecandy tho
MSV is a whole can of worms, really
while the Feds just slapped on a few parts on a GM and called it sea-worthy
Zeon had a whole department of underwater MS
Aye
Imperial Guard-level balls of steel
Man shot an experimental MS in the face with a bazooka
~~not to mention funding mad scientists like Ghinias~~
My UC history is hazy
Hence, the Zeonic Remnants in Unicorn episode 4
I believe many Zeon forces were trapped after Odessa was taken by the Feds?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
~~cut down~~
It would probably get fucked by departmental conflicts
*Chinese* cartoons <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
<@141531216200466432>  Has the best answer for this <:PharaDance:336657302914596866>
Music-wise, the show is a banger
OP is catchy is fuck, not gonna lie
Overall, it's alright
It goes up and down
<:PharaDance:336657302914596866>
Gen can just do it more than once in a short span of time
Anyone can punch concrete
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Gambatte
Lewd
Gaim is one of my mid-tier shows, but I can't really agree with any of this.
While other Riders have had their fair share of suffering, it's important to note that Kouta is a naive teenager that treated the Rider system as a chance to become a superhero. Also several Riders *have* become mopey. Sento for example, became a wreck after using Black Hazard to murder one of the Hokuto Trio.
His first encounter with Zengetsu nearly kills him
Kouta literally had a near-death experience in the first few episodes though
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
The Gundam Unicorn and Girls und Panzer route
My eye drifts here and there, but nah
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
~~meanwhile i have nothing to watch~~
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
~~assuming it's good~~
then go through it after it's finished
I guess I'll just wait out Build... whatever the new one is called
*stares at Gunpla kits*
those things
Oh right
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Gunpla Builders felt like a one-off thing to me until Build Fighters came tbh
After Try and Divers, I'm just about done with the Build line
Is the new Gundam Build series any good
Even in reality, Senshadou can't catch a break
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
<:PharaDance:336657302914596866>
Still looking forward to it regardless. The anime was plagued with production problems, so I'm eager to see what they can do with a compilation/sequel movie.
~~if the movie ain't that good, I can just ignore it's existence anyway~~
I, too, think the anime wrapped up nicely
*incoherent fanboying*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wItS0ERcMm0 Oh my god <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
f
PANZER VOR
There ye go
i'm going to bed
Tomino talk is always interesting to read tbh
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Is cute
My dad's cat likes playing with one of those
That was
Four gets the shaft earlier though
It's just an alternate, happier take on Zeta
Aka a happy ending, nothing bad happens past Zeta
And alternate ending
Cut out a majority of the plot
Unless you wanna rewatch *parts* of it in new animation
Avoid the Zeta Complication Movies for sure though
The story quality remains despite its animation having aged
I'd still recommend the series tbh
The movie version compiled a lot and cut out quite a bit into a couple of movies while fixing some animation since the production issues within the crew (ie hospitilization and needed rest from cardiac arrest) occured.
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Big Zam spam in regular matches
Goddamn flu
I didn't mean that
Wait shit
So confused
I was
It got into the games
Bleh
that it's hard to convince myself to get to it
but I'm so fatigued with gunpla as a setting
I hear good things about ReRise
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
<:PharaDab:336657302914596866>
When you have a franchise that puts out stuff every year, at least half of everything in your franchise is bound to be crap
||we have a hermaphrodite leech girl||
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>

"shit-eating grin" you mean
I would joke about starving myself to get it but I've done it before so I'm just gonna say I want it so bad
*envy*
but anime characters
The cute things that look like bean bags
I heard someone mention Katawa Shoujo <:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
I mostly came for more Revue content between the cast
I never played Gatcha before Revue so *shrug*
Okay it took a two months but still
Fast
Got bored
I did
Regardless it's Revue Starlight so I'll eat it up regardless unless it's gatcha
As well
They said it's meant to explain some stuff that the anime couldn't cover
Alt Chris is just 👀
While I'm fairly neutral on Magia Record, the only thing that really had me questioning the show was transitioning from Ep 2 to 3 ||when Kaede gets kidnapped during that haunting sequence at end of 2 and the start of the 3 immediately skips to the girls already calmly planning to get her back without any tension in the scene||
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
The show looks pretty at least
She doesn't stop there
It's real
Fanservice can be something like bringing back a well-loved character or making a reference to another famous moment/line/person in the same franchise
Of course
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
Ikxi knows what's up
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>

even download it
I'm *really* struggling to just
Was it?
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
People don't recognize Haruhi...?
Not only does it follow a different continuity in the end, the constant transition from new animation to old animation every time gets real jarring
just stick with the series, to be honest
The Zeta movies are pretty bad
alright, peg legs
🎷 🎷 🎷 🎷 🎷 🎷 🎷
The Vagans did it
Like Harry Ord and Meijin
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
On the rare occasion, they use sunglasses
so damn obvious
Isn't that like
and his VA, Tetsu Inada
I fucking love Harry Ord
Harry Ord is also Quattro Bajeena but you replace Ambition with Loyalty
<:PharaDab:336657302914596866>
Lacus Clyne can't say she worked in a WW1-esque military hospital and saw all the horrors that came with it
Also Princess Diana > every other Gundam Princesses
It wasn't a show about war like other shows, but one were many were trying to prevent it
but I thoroughly enjoyed it
Been too long since I last watched it
so much of a joke people forget he exists
Introduced one of the biggest jokes of a Char Clone too, Chronicle Asher
otherwise, skip
If you want to see a show get worn down like it's creator's mind, sure
but oh boy Victory wasn't very enjoyable
makes sense considering Tomino's mental state back then
Victory felt like one big murderfest
~~also Master Asia is still one of Gundam's better villains don't @ me~~
I would definitely still G a Gundam show considering the Gundam Fight is just one big proxy war
while listening to Rip & Tear
Imma just go cut my nails sadly for a few minutes
<:KirikaSob:674720015047720961>
~~god i miss those days~~
AGE was a full on almost-50 episode show
but only through the perspective of Asemu and Zeheart
The movie also covers Age 3
you're gonna miss things about certain side-characters but Zeheart and Asemu are the main focus so fuck 'em
hit up the movie
turn off the ep
basically as soon as the timeskip for Age 1 to Age 2 happens
then pick up the movie
I would just watch Age 1
Nothing like having a compilation movie that only focuses on the best parts of the series *and* rewrites most of the worst parts of it
the Memory of Eden movie, I actually love
Age 3 was garbage
Age 2, I'd put somewhere between good and alright
Age 1 was mediocre
Age wasn't that bad until Gen 3 tbh
I'm too far deep in to stop already
at this point anymore
I can't leave it
I'm just
Author comments like this sure go well with ||seeing glorious Gemocide in the process <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980> ||

I was there

Revue is great
<:ChrisSunglasses:654428105590439939>

I've done the jacket-on-shoulder thing a few times after watching Revue tbh
~~On a side note I would definitely wear those Revue outfits gosh they are so *stylish*~~

Yeah, I'm trying to look at the ones that most watched back then
Can't say anymore so have fun <:kiriAYAYA:530158198771023872>
Honestly, every girl in Revue is gay to an extent so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Shhhhhh
||Karen and Hikari are preeeeeetty gay. Now, it's been a while since I watched the show, and it doesn't help that Revue is only about 1/5 of Gear's entire runtime, but they're *pretty* gay||
> But yeah the translation seems slightly iffy?
Yeah, I'd suggest the fansubs <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
||Karen and Hikari or Karen and Mahiru?||
The official subs for Revue (though I'm not sure if they got any better after airing) were horrible ~~please don't have your subs cover half the screen please~~
I would suggest going for some of the fansubs for Revue
> How gay is it actually going to be?
yes
it's good stuff

Haven't heard that name in a while.
Ah, Hayate.

All of 765Pro is precious
Nice.
Yay
Idolmaster 2011, yes.
Been a while since I looked them up.
Though at this point, I believe the first games are only accessible through emulators.
And how it played out with the Producer as your POV.
Episode 1 was based on the game.
So watching together isn't necessary.
We share memories anyway.
Yes and no.
Nothing else.
I only have interest in Idolmaster.
Chihaya is Chihaya.

And so old wounds reopen

I should get around to playing the game.

Takane is on levels way higher than Maria.
not the other way around
tsubasa is sword chihaya btw
Idolmaster 2011 is good civilization
That's Takane
But yes, Kemurikusa is good civilization.
Animation spikes here and there, to be honest.

It's hardly the end because chapters are still on going
Also ||loli white blood cells. Right.||
Stopped after there because ||it felt like it was just dragging on at that point||
Aye.
> Attack on Nicotine?
If only it were just that bad.
Was a great read, although admittedly I only read up until the first arc which, to be honest, concluded nicely to the point the manga could've ended right there.
And no fun.
> Ohh , I'm soooo looking forward for this spin off
Get ready for grimdark.
Then we would truly be in the worst timeline ||Rewind time, Homura||
And they have something to announce.
Reminder that Madoka's anniversary is coming up next year January(?)

Overall, Cinderella Girls is a weird one.
Ranko is neat, though.
I'm comparing the CG Producer to the Cinderella Girls themselves <:OgawaRead:688429716507721770>
The Producer is the best character in the show, honestly.
Yeah.
Cinderella Girls is
We were 14.
I don't think anyone's reactions have yet to top seeing our best friend burn a cheap, old Gunpla model out of frustration.
Oh, someone watched Madoka Ep. 3
Kalafina is great.
How nostalgic.
Ah, Madoka
Ah, the memories when this aired.

We need to make time for this show
Goddamm.
But we're curious about the adaptation quality
We have yet to watch it since we read it way back already
How is the adaptation?
10 minutes of anime original content is not what we expected, but that was great.
Just went through the first episode of Hataraku Black
V: shia's just another girl to fond over the main protag dont @ me

The shorts are also good.
Indeed.
One's a compilation.
There's also 2 films
Those should be the shorts
There's an upcoming sequel OVA
V: <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
V: all the gay
V: like the gay
It's a 2-hour stage play, so much was expanded when the anime came out.
They certainly give off that impression.
V: good for the gay <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
This is a good change. <:OgawaRead:688429716507721770>
The 2 hour stage play had them more like rivals.
Friendlier to each other.
Interestingly enough, the anime have the girls be a lot more
Which is a good point of the series.
All the stage girls are likeable.
~~I do prefer Futaba though~~
Kaoruko is quite the girl.
Kaoruko?
Powerful voice.
Quite the lady, Maya is.

*must not rewatch in the middle of the night*

We enjoyed the first Ultraman episode.
I see
So now we're curious about watching it
We have Netflix now
Has anyone had any experience with the Ultraman Netflix anime?
V: <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
V: this duuuuuuuuuuuub
V: omg steve blum
Absolutely adored his voice acting for years at this point.
Liam O'brian as Moroboshi *really* makes it difficult to decide whether or not to stick with the Japanese track for Ultraman.
owo
Seto Kaiba is always soothing to listen to.
Neat.
Fun fact, her actress is capable of baton spinning as much as her character.
okayu is the same iirc
so yeh
only d'arby and jotaro had their voice actors returned

X: The biggest salt in the wound the finale gave us was how ||in a show about women dealing with men who have wronged them horribly, the main character's closest friend is told to have driven someone to death and only died because she tripped and fell to her death in the middle of publicly accusing a man of things he didn't do.||
Exams pain.
Should get around to watching the 1st movie.
Never heard of it.
What episode is this
*Cough*
Time to wait for the next Princess Principal movie
hobo meguca finally got the cash money for drip

oh yeah the better one
they exude *filthy peasants dont touch me* energy
pretty wack ideals
the sahakus are a rich asf family with some
<:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377>
painting the gold on the gunpla to actually look good is pain
also gundaminfo only having SEED as large as 480p on youtube is a fucking war crime
rip ||blitz|| we hardly saw ya
most of the designs look a lot simple when you buy the gunpla and leave the backpacks off
cosmic era definitely has a fetish for chunky backpacks
its supposed to be an underwater mech from the manuals so idk
duel is cool
the earlier GAT units are pretty neat yeah
man that thing is either back heavy or wearing a whole damn MA on its head
the forbidden gundam for example
also rewatching seed some of our favourite designs def dont age well
unless youre part of the clyne faction
people in the cosmic era are fucking wack
yeah but at least in UC a lot of char's extremist talk can be countered with a lot of the good that exists in it
xenophobia cranked up to eleven here
with how absolutely shit the cosmic era is
anyway tbh a lot of rau's nihilistic shit-talk sometimes feels genuine
so much het shipping in these three ships
clyne faction just be absorbing characters that could have given the other factions some depth
especially into destiny
still sad on the alliance just degenerates
yeah
WMDs up the wazoo in the cosmic era i swear to god
kinda wish the earth forces were less cartoon evil
rewatched the gundam seed remaster cuz we were bored
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
but 00 is also only available in 480p on youtube
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
The sheer speed at which two Hunters ||unceremoniously die off was surprising, if anything||
Plenty of jank and rushed due to only being one hour, but the writing team definitely tried to adhere to the Hunter and their role in preserving nature
The Monster Hunter animated movie was alright.
the ||pets|| are precious
run away and dun look back

turns out a local store got the hguc gundam g05
gonna grab a pbandai kit this sunday

or Build Fighters season 1
00
Just don't make them as memorable as say
Something about the way that the fights are directed
Honestly, a lot of IBO fights aren't as impressive as the whole medieval theme could have given
Straight-up happy ending.
||Aila|| definitely got a better ending than her counterparts in other series though
And exploitation of people born with strange abilities
Build Fighters still has experimentation
Too used to the black which gave the Nu a simplistic but elegant look.
Blue Nu Gundam is a surprise.
Ah yes, Doan's Island. Iconic.
practically the same filter he used for evolto
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
it was real easy to spot
he even had a robotic filter for his voice so like
didnt expect kamen rider evolto's voice actor to be here tho
star wars visions is pretty sweet
Among other things
Lank's point is that a lot of Senki's world-building reflects the rhetoric of Japanese nationalists.
Especially in the realm of Sunrise mecha.
Plenty of fiction has non-fiction roots.
yeah babyyyyy
love that shit like the large ass  B A N D A I  sticker on Barnaby's chest

It's been a while since we've seen a fang that wasn't just an extension of the lip.
Not a movie I'd recommend watching if you're not sober.
V: bananas have never looked sexier

Going to have to rewatch it a few more times.
The Revue Starlight movie was one hell of a *trip*.
dual wielding katanas mfer
Also, fun fact, Kouji in Shin Mazinger is voiced by
Ever since
How long has it been
V: inhaling that revue gay
The more we rewatch, the more we love the imagery in this aggressive lesbian drama movie.
Ferocious
Banana don't play
Get ready for some surreal stuff.
~~More reasons to rewatch so we can think~~
Honestly even we've watched it and we're still figuring it out
For the 2nd movie
It's something.
Yeah.
Rondo Rondo Rondo.
Nana ||singing the last verse of her Revue with Karen is one good example||
Always watch to the final minute for these movies
It's also the name of Nana's OST.
Yes
||Extreme homosexuality||
Entertains the audience better
Enjoy
Well put

Keep on flying

Cheering for you
And go drink tea
Looking forward to it
Can't get enough of the movie
Dazzling
You can do it
Show Must Go On is based on the Stage Play
Fun and fluffy
Overture is a prequel manga to the series
V: so much to digest in this movie
<:ElsaPat:637356110415659063>
After all that time
The movie was satisfying
A long time passed since the show released
Very
V: 🍿
<:ElsaPat:637356110415659063>
Faltering all of a sudden?
https://pastebin.com/yZQMxv88 From an interview based on the new movie.
Interviews with the Director of the Revue anime/movies are certainly interesting
They're just stuck in gacha jail.
Their school names are present at some point in the sequel movie
The other schools definitely exist in the anime
V: <:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
<:ElsaPat:637356110415659063>
Certainly interesting.
Yes
V: damn mizu went for the jugular
The anime simply expands on her
Nana is still the same character but the ||constant loops is only in the anime (because the Stage Play is of course not as long as a show)||
It's fascinating when you've seen the original Stage Play
Indeed
SYMPHOGEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Especially with the theatre troupe its based on.
Revue has more believable shipping for us.
X: No you
X: Banned
X: Nana's singing is superb

Stage magic
Claudine is always happy to comment on their relationship issues and it's great
V: <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Even if what's shown is meant to represent real feelings.
It's all a play
Stage magic ensures no one gets hurt
She definitely plays the Relationship Vent Friend to Futaba
None of what you mention so far, but we've yet to watch the 2nd stage play
They definitely hurt each other
Maya is absolutely vicious in the stage play
The anime and the stage play definitely take different routes in certain places, like the girls being better friends with one another in the show.
V: gay gay homosexual gay
At this point, you could make a list about how the stage plays, anime and games have characterized the girls
banana dont fucking play
so she gets an opening to ||cut kaoruko down with ease||
and she proceeds to ||move just enough so that kaoruko's naginata deflects one of junna's arrows by accident||
nana ||getting attacked by kaoruko up front and junna from afar||

gotta love some of this fight choreography when played in slow-motion
rewatching the revue starlight movie
god
Glad we got to have the pleasure of seeing such art.
Very bananice
What an age to live in
Spice and Wolf
What a work of art
Also, Blue Rose and Dragon Kid are CGI in-costume now.
It appears that they're keeping the logos unlike Season 1 on Netflix

Yep
Really wondering how none of them suspected ||Anew|| of being an Innovade when she had outright lavender hair and that name
Tiger & Bunny season 2 tonight, huh
Glad that the sexual tension is still present at least
Really doesn't feel like there was a decade gap between seasons at all
Straight out of Warframe
Was honestly hoping for a weekly release
Just finished rewatching the first season
Partner insecurities, cheating insecurities, etc.
Almost halfway into Tiger & Bunny 2 and so far everything has this undertone of a relationship drama
its been 10000 years
emo enby rocks
Ai yo
No third movie yet
Yes
Even if a lot of hit hits close to home for a lot of people
Half-responsible for breaking our egg
This one is a blessed work
Grass is greener on the other side, huh
Interesting friendship
Ooo
||Too bad Kalashnikovs won't save a doomed love interest||
Vampire in the Garden has an interesting start
The punishment is bed time with a gem.
Betrayal
2 days after our birthday
Oh hey
Hellsing Ultimate was the same.
to graduation from Secondary school entirely
Oh boy that lasted from the start of our Secondary year
The last time we endured this sort of release, it was with Gundam Unicorn
V: also booba goals
Drives like mad, loves a good drink and tired of everything
Dorothy is our spirit animal
Funny where life takes you
In the end, another friend (who cosplayed Hideki) and I got hit with the trans beam
Especially since a friend we were crushing on cosplayed as Otonashi
Cosplaying Ayato Naoi years before we broke our egg was a trip
Just say rock people anime /s
People will be begging more for the rabbit girl
The very thing that got us to buy a PS3 back then
Full Burnen/Vernier/Whatever
It was a GP01
It's the liquid of life regardless
Blessed voice.
All we know is that 96neko sings for this
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
We bought it on release
What the fuck it was 9 years ago
Project Mirai DX.
Yep
Haven't been there in months.
Our 3DS is stuck in our mother's house
Sadly we did come to a day where we stopped playing that 3DS game
And they would get mad at you if you didn't play the game for long while
We remember a Hatsune Miku game where you could interact with one of the Vocaloid characters in their room
🗞️
The manga ending was fun
She's doing the the finger-pointing-at-the-sky-pose
What else could she even be referencing
Ah, yep. The living portal gun.
Isn't that the one that makes portals with his spots?
Just no time/car to go watch
We have it here in our cinemas
Depends where you live
Charlotte/Nagisa's background for an example of the latter
A lot of "Jesus Christ"
A lot of good ideas
Partly
Magia Record feels like what would happen if Symphogear XDU got an anime, with all the writing quality implications.
"The fuck's going on over there" really summarizes how we feel as someone who mostly stayed within the vicinity the series/movie/some manga
Stumbled into details for Magia Record

They gladly announced a Code Geass gacha
Certain characters don't appear ||Mao, if I'm not wrong|| and of course, the big one ||Shirley not having that one encounter with Rolo||
Different continuity, too.
No v-fin because cannon fodder statuses typically robs you of that ~~unless you're an M1 Astray or Murasame~~
as the Victory Hexa
It becomes widely used in the second half, if I'm not wrong
V: oW0
That glorious shot of ||God holding up the Shining's corpse is up there with some of the most memorable scenes||
Except for when Shining got ||impaled halfway through||
It's almost time for enby rock suffering
Don't get me started on the BS of 'fuel consumption' during the Crossbone fight
When it should have just been a background piece
Like when Sekai blew up the moon
Try has a lot of 'why' going on for it
Instead we get a character who disappears after the fight (and they're voiced by Romi Park to boot)
Could've have just had the 3 of them overwhelm the Crossbone by sheer numbers to begin with
But that whole fight was just silly
There's definite nerfing when Turn A isn't an instant win suit
are freely vomitting out beams
a team of 00 suits
There's also the weird nerfing of Crossbone when the team it's fighting
The Crossbone, no less.
A late UC MS certainly should perform better in its energy generation
The peacock smasher should not be that fuel inefficient
Fuel consumption talk is ridiculous when its enemies are firing way more insane shots than the Crossbone itself
00 tech is UC tech on steroids, sure, but the basis is the same.
Universal Century Mobile Suits reactors generate infinite energy, for god's sake
makes shell weaponry better again
Which ironically
The closest argument is that when guns are so good that not getting hit is the best option, your silhouette might as well be smaller and your speed should be faster to not get hit
<:meowsip:752303015397949481>
SNRI being a very subtle reference to SuNRIse studios
SNRI came in with the new hotness of small MSs
They fuck off somewhat in late UC then come back a bit
Unpredictable products make for bad profits, probably
Anaheim says psychoframe unpredictable
technically
And Daguza shooting a flashbang at the Kshatriya with a shoulder-carried rocket
Unicorn's funnel hijack
Unicorn had two variants, one being indirect
Wufei is the kind of guy that people would kick in the shins though
Sai Saichi was great
Disaster lesbian Mahiru
Played by a famous Kamen Rider actress to boot
<:meowsip:752303015397949481>
If the games are even slightly canon, she has a tomboy from another school pining for her
Disaster lesbian
Vampire in the Garden for example
How many gay shows are there with the name Fine in it
Oh no, the horror
Suletta got some great eyebrows
Also ||science babies, truly a miracle||
Can't get enough of how the artist draws the actual fight scene shooting locations from Rider/Sentai in many, many chapters
Lesbian Tokusatsu was good stuff
<:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377>

Speaking from experience
It's a great base for a Jehuty-based custom kit though
Sounds like Inoue alright
Writer of Jetman, Kamen Rider Agito/Faiz/Kiva, DonBrothers
<:kermitsip:865927558007488532>
The manga is written by Toshiki Inoue?
Both of which had arms that functioned like wire weapons. So they probably had a big stock of those arms lying around.
Since it's derived from the Silver Bullet, which was derived from the Neo Zeon Doven Wolves
The Silver Bullet Suppressor already had detachable arms to begin with
Not like it they had to change much
Concerning
Haven't seen any of his works outside of Tokusatsu, so a Gundam story by him is uh
Pray that Toshiki Inoue doesn't go wild again <:kermitsip:865927558007488532>
<:Felix_Sip:721537605845647421>
so the 'upgrade' honestly didn't do much
Phillip already looked beautiful in live-action
Wouldn't have recognized her if she wasn't standing next to her father in the bar they've been running since the Accel movie
To red-head beauty
Lily straight up went from black-hair
But for side-characters like the cops, the townsfolk that help the agency, etc. they're pretty much just 2D versions of the actual actors' faces
Got to love how Fuuto PI gives anime-esque designs to characters like Shotaro, Phillip, etc
TV-Nihon is one, I believe <:meowsip:752303015397949481>
Quite a few of subbers actually translate them
Been some time since we've read the start
I don't think so
Just cat things to be honest
Weird that they changed the breed of the Sonozaki family's cat though
Fuuto IP nailing it good so far
Since it's an animated version of the show's Cold Open (albeit tweaked slightly)
The only thing to note is that everything in the first 2-3 minutes of the anime only get resolved in the Tokusatsu show itself
since they explain things anyway
Apparently the manga it adapts is written in a way that doesn't rely on knowledge of the show
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Spider lilies
Sasuga loser ojou-sama
Kaoruko doesn't have a good wallpaper for her lock screen
V: gonna bet twenty that sk8 is loris fav show
Thank god for Fuuto PI keeping the suit actor movements while transformed
Our only exposure is the absolutely memorable dub line 'Bitches, bros, and non-binary hoes' but either than that, it has a lot of cute ikemen
Powered by homosexuals
<:PhosYanProud:868175922870763540>
Houseki no Kuni in terms of visuals
<:girlsip:892354171628564502>
Sometimes less is more
Man's got terrorism-induced PTSD with a flavour of clown
Chibodee being a chad who isn't afraid to open up about his feelings
G Gundam handles its masc characters well, to be honest
For all it's insanity, it still carries the theme of humanity ravaging the earth for its resources and then going into space to continue doing it there
G Gundam good
<:kermitsip:865927558007488532>
Hopefully Accel's bike form doesn't look as bad as it does in the live-action
Terui will get introduced later once he's relevant
Because they wouldn't have screentime for ||Tokime's final scenes in that episode||
Unlike W's later forms, the anime doesn't hesitate to show Accel Trial and Accel Booster in its opening
So we can only guess ourselves on either ||FangJoker being used|| or Accel finally being introduced in the show
We only went as far as episode 3's content for the manga because translations for the manga weren't too much
There's no sparks when W gets hit though 0/10 anime /s
Even in the new episode of Fuuto PI, they straight-up have someone explain all the forms of W excluding ||FangJoker and CycloneJokerExtreme|| for anime/manga-only fans
since she's a brand new character for the detective agency
Tokime essentially acts as a narrative device to explain what's this and what's that
Literally just this
||Tron uses a regular bike, Accel IS the bike||
Thank god for ||Trial Form||
||That only looks half as dumb as the live action||
Next Fuuto PI
Finally
The A in Akiko stands for 'ally', apparently
<:Felix_Sip:721537605845647421>
Makes us wonder if a line like this would fly in the live-action
<:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
Really wish Fuuto PI would tone down the horny
Still no HG Leopard to go along with the Airmaster
On the topic of Build Fighters, I am passing by to vent our annoyance at the designers bringing back the Leopard from X and then slimming it down from a heavily armoured gatling MS to a generic thin suit with hardpoints all over
*Stares at the 8th MS Team novelization*
"She just like me fr" - Whenever one of those people sees Yukari

Sound design good
Should probably break out for the headphones for the Witch of Mercury Prologue
While also showing Mao's new heights as a builder
The Crossbone Maoh at least participated in the G Gundam esque finale
~~Last minute appearance just to advertise a new toy~~
Yep
By this point
How many times has Fenny died
I can't tell
Is that the actual title to look up online or a plot summary
<:ChrisPeek:706913632386285588>
Roll a d10 to determine how apologetic your setting is about slavery /s
Roll a d100 to determine your gimmick please
In hindsight, the one good thing that came out of Age-3 is Seric Abis. The ace pilot who leads the MS corp of the Diva while relying on nothing more than natural talent with his mass-produced machine in battle.
Sadly, ||while his death was great, the fact that it goes unmourned by the *pacifist protagonist* is mind-boggling.||
Also ||Zeheart actually gets romantically involved with his subordinate, and his TV-series motivations gets changed to a more believable downward spiral caused by all the deaths of those following him||
||Dark Hound VS Legillis went from a 15-second fight to a full-on clash that's up there with vicious Gundam fights||
and rewrites a lot of scenes to be better
and the scenes taking place in the 3rd arc leaves out the 3rd arc's protagonist
When your third arc goes so bad you just make a movie about the 2nd arc
V: beats to shoot spacenoids to

Or feathers
Was the spreading of the white flowers too on the nose?
Since Shino was straight as far as everyone saw
The closest we got before this was Shino and Yamagi (in IBO) but that was one-sided
Curious as to why Gundam.info got delayed though
WLW
After all these years of implied MLM
Suzaku has a kid with Lelouch but not with Euphie, to be fair.
Shirley is destined to be given the proverbial shaft
Blessed girl
Suletta's lack of any braincells makes her top tier
Mobile games.
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
It's perfect
Not a single thought going on in that head of hers
Turn A had Guin Lineford for example, but that guy was the epitome of rich bastard
Not the first time we've seen same-gender stuff in Gundam, but it's a lot less subtext
But yeah
Like Haros
It has some of the usual easter eggs
Who knew that if we wanted Armoured Core kits, we just needed to wait for Witch of Mercury kits
||Additional points for Suletta inadvertedly saving the man responsible for the deaths of her father and an entire research team||
Suletta 🤝 Shiro (8th MS Team)

Sound design on point
No regrets watching with headphones
to watch the show to begin with.
We have a way for her if she wants
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Probably not
Curious if that would work for her
Yeah, Lily's Irish
Episode 1 in other places
Episode 0 is on Youtube if you want it
So far, it's an academy show with political assassinations so that's fun
MC is later sent to attend a school for Mobile Suit pilots by her mother
MC's family was a part of the company in charge of it before everyone but her and her mother were murdered in Episode 0
One company utilized a system where you bond with it through your body - possibly leading to bodily harm
Giant mechs known as Mobile Suits were developed
Corporations run the system.
The entire episode is rife with good Suletta faces
Her inability to speak without stuttering is too real
Maria simps
Gundam in 1979: "Gihren, do you remember Hitler?"
Gundam is rife with homoerotic tension
Forced x is just typical screaming whenever minorities are involved

Bits of pink. Not entirely.
If we had a penny for every Gundam character with bits of pink on their hair, we'd have two. Which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happenned twice. (Chibodee Crocket)
Can't be us
Imagine not stuttering on every conversation
Bit of a reversal of the usual stuff aside from G Gundam
While Earthnoids enjoy poverty
The Prologue showed a snapshot on how the spacenoids are rich as fuck

Gundam Fighters are legally protected from any damage they inflict on the earth
While all the rich and wealthy moved into space
The earth got turned into a glorified fighting ring in G Gundam

G Gundam: "Can't you see what the Gundam Fight has done to the Earth, Domon?!"

<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
She's got the Garie underhair
It's definitely one of our favourite anime with an adult guy as a protagonist
We also have Sky High who's just modern Rocketeer with the personality of Fred from Scooby-Doo
A loooot of gay subtext
Ditches the classic hero stuff and represents the newer traditions that we've seen since the 2000s in superhero movies
Barnaby (Bunny) is Bruce Wayne but he became a vengeful Iron Man
Has the classic secret identity and all
Tiger is essentially adult Spider-Man with a kid
It's essentially a buddy cop show that pays a lot of homages to Western superheroes
Makes sense since it had a tone shift in the second half
Apparently it was like this for season 1 almost a decade ago
Second half of Season 2 releases today

Suletta is already wooing these kindness-starved students with her sheer gooberness

Chuchu really has joined the hall of Gundam beatdowns

The Zowort Heavy sure looks cool in spite of the police brutality part
This was an Armoured Core anime all along
Yep
If you're outside Asia, you're gonna need Crunchyroll, the seven seas, or just YouTube if you have a VPN you can set to Asia
Other episodes will depend on your location
Prologue is free to watch on Youtube

I know this was several hours ago, but the armour type is Trans-Phase armour
Whatever went on, those fingers did work
Something along the lines of 'replacing complicated maneuvers typically relied on Coordinator reflexes with procedures that would be carried out automatically by pre-programmed movements'
He wrote an OS that allowed the Earth forces to actually pilot Mobile Suits
||The first officially never happened||
This is pretty much the best Armoured Core 4 anime, really.
The cast is fun, at least.
||Tear gas canisters the size of cars||
We already got ||protester suppression with fucking mobile suits||
But nothing has tipped it yet
It's *brewing*
It's more along the lines of Gundam The Origins
Brutal consequences of war but they take the time to develop their cast at least
Except without the teacher stuff
It's just Three Houses
Literally gathering all of the corporate big wig's heirs in one place
When the corporate war breaks out, the school is going to be a target
Come a long way from 'Dangar' in Zeta Gundam or 'Help!! I'm going to killed Ms. Lacus!' in SEED Destiny

Thank god for Witch of Mercury having good English
||Her student phone notes as her as being in the Business department, but that doesn't stop her||
Corporations will abide by rules and play nice until profits are on the line
Pretty much just Armoured Core <:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
Departments are: Pilots, Mechanics, Business
From what we've seen on their phones
as well as their corporate students
while training their new pilots and mechanics
The 'school' is pretty much the corporations' way of showing off their new products

It's not a bad idea to develop your characters before throwing them into the grinder, really
||That microwave gun that fried Elan sure made for a good candle||
||Shaddiq is now taking an interest in Suletta too after seeing what she inadvertedly did to the both of them||
||One House prince is now homeless, while another prince became Kanade||
Apparently, a staff member posted a tweet of Aerial brand chips with the collab cover of ||Elan being grilled corn flavour||

We've already seen her clobber a wall with a wrench, denting the metal.
She's a delinquent
Yes
But it's still a week without Witch
It's not replacing episode 7

||Local corporation shoots themselves in the foot by 'laying off' an underperforming worker||
||Brainpower faltering||

On the day of the episode, yeah.

*cough* Wonder Egg *cough*
At least it's not replacing an actual episode
Will Hobo Guel have anything to wear to the ball, we wonder

As far as we remember, gold also delayed Hyper Muteki's debut in KR Ex-Aid and Cross-Z's first ever henshin back in KR Build.
Ah shit, here we go again

G-Witch is the best Armoured Core 4 anime
Her father definitely gives middle-eastern vibes, at least.
https://tenor.com/view/suletta-mercury-g-witch-gundam-witch-from-mercury-gif-26914141
Well
And she's still
Suletta is essentially quite tall by Asian standards (She's our height and we rarely see people taller than us around our parts)
https://64.media.tumblr.com/dd86a8d2866c2dc92fa50b409aa34e45/a58e53653a44c38e-61/s640x960/fc3711b4c76b448d14f05e0d30dac7a0b8556cc4.jpg

That girl was lying on the ground for the whole scene
Like the 150 cm ball of fury that is Chuchu
And yet she's always hiding behind everyone else
At about 170 cm
Suletta is physically the tallest among the girls
It's the season of Tanuki protagonists and that's nice

Him pointing out Miorine losing her tsun over time is especially fun
Shaddiq just becomes more like Claude with each episode
||And even then Peil may or may not be allocating all of the Elan-related stuff into said department since that could fall underneath the role of a 'medical' department.||
||We're not sure if it's Peil directly since the subs specify only buying out the development teams in charge of the companies' respective Gundams||
||The space-pack is made in the same purple colour as Shaddiq's company line of MSs||
Miorine: "I only care about getting to Earth"
Also Miorine: ||"Give me money to start a company for my tanuki wife's sake please"||

||Suletta got put on a second Witch trial and she didn't even care afterwards. Even sent her away to fetch drinks just so she could tangle her finger around Miorine||
The episode is rather interesting in how ||Delling is shown to be not a complete bastard, while Prospera is absolutely manipulative of her daughter||
Same guess that if Delling went with his plan in Episode 1, Peil Technologies or even Grassley would still take the throne from them.
||His father is to the corporations what Guel is to dueling||

Ramba Ral in Build Try, as far as this brain can recall
ZZ isn't an anime
A New Translation is pretty much different canon though
||The mind surge never happens to begin with|| in A New Translation
Yeah
Yeah she's
Historically the first transforming MS on screen
Sort of miss the Messala
Too bad it's piloted by fucking Reccoa
The Athene is a nice suit
If we're not wrong
The Boloniak Sahman (I don't care how it's spelt) and Palace Athene were also his designs
He throws out designs left and right, yeah.
There we go
Titania
Name's on the tip of our tongue
It was err
Which would have been another woman he brought into his fold
for his puppet monarch
He had another suit in mind
So it's a fast fucker
It's a suit designed for the heavy gravity of Jupiter
And it's *still* fast enough to keep up with the Zeta
Its armour can shrug off beam shots
It's beam rifle packs a fucking punch
but specs-wise?
The O looks alright
A mirror to Kamille himself
He's a genius designer, essentially
||Titan's death throes, basically||
https://tenor.com/view/ultraman-zero-gif-20738341
Mamoru Miyano being Zero

We remember seeing comparisons between Symphogear and Saint Seiya
https://twitter.com/catsuka/status/1597721577487224832
||Kamille being a broken shell by Zeta contributes heavily to Char's spiral to|| CCA though
Kamille's dialogue as he ||performs the Waverider Crash is also different. Series is "Begone from this world" while A New Translation has him going "Go back to where the woman are" instead||
Second one is arguably more realistic after being ||impaled on the nosecone of a fucking MS but yeah||
In the series he ||has that whole speech of how he's going to take Kamille with him into the next life||
In A New Translation ||he just goes "Onna datto?" and dies||
||Haman just puts down her arms instead of going on a blitzkrieg to Earth|| in ZZ
https://tenor.com/view/sip-gif-19554755
Char's Counterattack wouldn't have happened if Char, Amuro and Lalah simply became a polycule
It's glorious
||Nobody dies with grace|| in CCA ||Astonage gets hit by stray fire while his girlfriend gets crushed in a suit's manipulator. Gyunei dies like a dog. Rezin gets gunned down by ship turrets. Chang is team-killed. Char goes out ranting about his mommy issues while Amuro is just confused||

Apparently Lilique's character bio states that she's popular with the boys
Kabuto too
The two weeks after Episode 6 was especially entertaining to see when it came to fandom discussion
Bi-weekly Witch could be fun
Depending on how the finale goes
Suletta would probably kill Jesus on his birthday, too.
Talk of the finale initially would have been a bit clogged since it's on the night of Christmas
For the better, honestly
Faiz if you count child actors
You got two weeks till the next episode
Also, this is just becoming the plotline for Armored Core 4 For Answer and that's great.

Same for Micha's VA, apparently
Oh hey Aoi Yuuki is in G-Witch

||No mention of Chang so far, no. But the Hathaway storyline is not one that ends well for him anyway.||
<:ChrisRead:688429724334161987>
Read that as "the one kaiju fan" and felt pity for a moment
More akin to a orbital gun that sits on the rails that goes around Earth, collecting solar energy
Not really a 1:1. Gundam likes its doomsday gun trope.

Spectacular had an amazing Symbiote arc, at least.
Where ||Peter loses every relationship he has, his friendship with Harry is a shell of what it was, Norman gets away after faking his death and Black Cat loses her faith in Spider-Man when it turns out that Uncle Ben's killer is her father||
Causing his show to end on a downer ending
After they cancelled Spectacular Season 3
Just strange seeing him back again
Is Josh Keaton back as Spectacular
A bit fruity, if we're not wrong.
She gets better later on, we hear, but none of it is adapted

Of course, Igloo also decided to dress up some of their Zeon personnel is the fashiest outfits possible
The Feds in the one featuring the Big Rang in particular ||had them firing on Zeon forces during a cease-fire||

A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
Indeed
The hardest level for its Deviant is a level for masochists.
*Fuck* that thing.
Not as bad as the lightning bug wyvern though
I have annoying memories of its Deviant version, alright?
As much as it slaps you around.

Nothing new.
It's the same phenomena we see in the Vocaloid/Utauloid/Utauite communities.
It's hardly surprising.
Hence, the covers.
It's a good song

Shame about FromSoft not doing anything with the license
It's a good game
Cleared only through abuse of the AIs inability to fly over walls sometimes, all to turn that mission into a series of 1v1s.
Ah yes, that mission
