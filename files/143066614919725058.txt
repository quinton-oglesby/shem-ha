true, I think that's why I was fighting her to begin with, since I need red giga crystals, but no one seems to be doing her, its easier to find the power raid
I'm an idiot and thought I needed both Carols for mine, but apparently I only need the Green one and the power raid
correct

Wish I did more raids before they were fixed
<@!177328724759281664> it should be up
I had a green one up since I'm trying to get materials for my XD Shirabe, I've noticed that green Carol dies easily, the regular power raid is iffy, and I've had like 1 red carol killed ever
I'll get another power one going, those are harder to get killed than Carol for some reason
alright
removed some people that haven't logged-in in awhile
I should still have a raid going
