Also, when I see nuns
because the title for the prayer is called "Ave Maria"

It always comes to mind when I see a priestess Maria
*Dios te salve, Mara,
llena eres de gracia,
el Seor es contigo.
Bendita tu eres entre todas las mujeres,
y bendito es el fruto de tu vientre, Jesus.
Santa Maria, Madre de Dios,
ruega por nosotros, pecadores,
ahora y en la hora de nuestra muerte.
Amen*

I have dark skin tone but a really bright sun will have me looking Spanish
I think it's just lighting
I like Caulifla tho
I actually don't like her
Shirabe could be an armadillo and kirika a crocodile
And Maria a bat
I hope Basa would be a lizard or a fast moving cat

<@83626774000308224> you know how hard that is tho?
I smell a conspiracy
Wow coronavirus confirmed in Indianapolis
Also it would be pretty difficult to get ahold of someone knowing the family. I just want to pay my respects
Just found an obituary online would I ask the church that interment her or the cemetery?
Umm.. Does anyone know how I can go about finding someone's grave?
Also my friends would "jokingly" invite me over
There just isn't any leadership to prove the boogs gonna happen
Anyway I got my ways
Not too sure
I might get one next time I go to mexico
I don't own one but I like the M249
What's your favorite firearm?
Yeah
You don't support la revolution?
When the government oversteps we overthrow
Boogaloo
<@302063351767498752> glad to hear you support the boog now
I had a rough "patch" with family years back. I prolly woulda ran from home if it wasn't for my two little brothers. Basically I found strength through them.
<@266379640069685252> Stay strong. Do you have any siblings?
Thxs
I mistook no vaccine as no treatment
Lol smh
Oh ok
So basically I would get tested,then quarantine myself, and hope I don't die?
Yeah I know that much but there's no vaccine for it?
If I get it what exactly can I do about it?
Your parents don't purposely do this ya know
People don't know how to deal with stress
Sometimes people don't do anything because they don't want to get caught up in the situation.
If you report a crime from inside a house or car you basically don't really get yourself involved that much
I've always thought the people reporting crimes where at home anyway
You should also keep in mind that you may never get closure with that other person. That's tough for anyone ,but you'll need to learn to move on and just refocus on  looking toward the future.
What server was it? Is there anything we can do about it?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>

Diet is important too
How'd you get zits? Eating too much greasy food eh?
It's way better than popping zits
Buy cream

If you try to report him without evidence you get nowhere. 
Also you might not be able to rely on others especially if he has friends on that discord
I mean that mod might not get punished for what he did
At least until you're at a position to hope again.
You have any coworkers that make the job worth it? Three years ago I had a really shit job that I couldn't afford to lose but a coworker held me down without them knowing it.
I haven't loved anyone in a while so I'm in no position to give you relationship advice other than "You can manage being lonely".
<@192304778938679296>. Want to let it all out?
But I've learned a lot for better or for worse
I was raised by thugs and the internet
Shemmy there are people out there that would laugh at that beheading video
I used to hear alot worse in the locker rooms
True
This video didn't which caught me by surprise
But graphic videos usually have a gray thumbnail asking if you really want to watch it
Former military friend
Hopped on Facebook and the first vid I see is someone getting shot to death.
Wow
My high school had police and people still sold drugs lol
I can see that
You're right ,but they might able to get help regardless
Once a year?
What about a mandatory psych evaluation?
Onsite police is more realistic
Isn't that too much work?
Who's ezra miller?
Lol
It's too early for civil war
Coalitions are great but they are only temporary and there are no guarantees that politicians will work together for your cause.
Yea that really explains why two parties have been in the running for the longest time
My vote doesn't even matter because "libertarian"
George Washington was right
Tbh Hillary wasn't likeable either
Don't antibiotics only work for bacteria and not viruses?

Since 1991 North korea has been in

So like ISIS?
Wow
I just pinged you because you seem to be knowledgeable on current events over there
<@284390402210136064>
So what's been going on in India?
An MOS is basically a trade or specialty
a light infantry unit would probably do things differently compared to a mechanized unit
and Unit
It depends on your MOS
Lol
My units combat ready rn
I'm army, but more specifically national guard. Two years ago my unit got absorbed by an active duty unit tho which is when all the fun started
Also ~~sometime~~ most of the times there'd be a sudden change in mission plans where we would legit just walk in fuckin circles for miles
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
This emote sums me up during training
Mostly everyone would agree lol
I would always joke around with my squad and say " I wouldn't mind if I got ran over because it'd be better than this".
Like, you know you have to put on your boots but you know you'll regret it
Waking up is always the worst too
I remember being so desperate for warmth I would cuddle with my squadmates
Our gear was wet and we were freezing in below 30¬∞f. The first night hit like a brick. I remember chilling, having a nice dream only to wake up to thunder and sleeping in a puddle. Since the weather never really got better we never really got a chance to dry off our gear.
My worst experience had to have been training for a month in Lousiana during a tropical storm in November
I can't even imagine training in the snow
I've been lucky to have good leadership. Usually the training conditions are what really blows cheeks
It usually is until we go out into to field lol
I serve your neighboring country

You got three types of people in the navy

2 those who aren't
3 those who share a bed 
Lolololol
I bounced schools a lot as a kid up until high school. You're gomna have to build up that courage at first but then you realize things aren't so bad as they seem and it's pretty easy to make friends.
Thanks for the well put out explanation. I'll try to spread backstory on that word and why people shouldn't use it in the future.
There's probably a whole lot more that I missed
So is the reason the word  trap is offensive is because it implies deceit?
^
You can's always keep your beliefs without running into conflict. Sometimes you have to hold your ground on *what you really want and believe in*.
I mean even if he doesn't follow the advice he'll have something to think about. You never know when things might click for a person
I wouldn't go that far as to say stop asking advice because at that point you've given up
I think you should just talk to more people and meet others
As someone with a waifu in a military uniform with a gun I would rather not go to war. I just have it as my pfp because I've served and I've met some amazing people there.
Like are you gonna complain about your boss to your boss? Naw you do it with the your coworkers
Sometimes it's a sign of frustration in a relationship. Mostly it's just people joking around
<@84811738653929472> I think it's a certain subsection of guy culture tbh. Also there are like different types. Most common type is where they just complain and they don't really hate their significant other. It's just small talk
I try to be grateful for the people around me now
Still, I try to not focus on that
The topic of friends always brings bad memories, what ifs and I wonder whys.
I had someone who would just push everyone away. It hurt. Eventually I gave up on him
Y'all ever have a friend change for the worse?
I do phone him but he hasn't picked up yet. I know he's probably busy so I try not to call him as much
Ever since my best friend moved to Texas I feel kinda lonely but what can ya do
^
What words could be serious to you could also be harmless to that couple. I had an older manager who the first time I met her husband I want to knock out for being disrespectful. Turns out that's just how they talk.
There definitely are
I assumed since it was on your mind so heavily that it might've been something you had seen recently
If it's alright with you could you post screenshots of what's being said?
Also, your friends will probably understand that your joking and be in a similar situation. So that might also be another reason.
I mean yea you can also joke around with each other but you don't want to pile it on em.
Anybody got any tips for warding off possums? If not I'll just hafta shoot it

If they legit just talked to each about it a little bit more they coulda save that poor doge :(
1 day later they put two and two together and were like O.O
The neighbors up by then so I let him handle it
Then she decides to wake me up to get the dog but I only see 1
They picked up a lil too late. But it turned out they weren't outside.
Even tho my dad saw the perp, he never knew they had gotten a new pup so I understand that. My mom just saw the dog run around so she called em
So yesterday my neighbors dog got snatched
I swear my parents sometimes kinda slow af
Good luck!
You have roots in Norway or just because?
Didn't they only show it once tho?
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
They could  have made gs without that scene tbh
They could have def made the show better in regards to how they showed it
Rape is obviously bad ,but I think the healer is a well written character. It shows someone who has been thru rape filled trauma recover from it.
Hitler is definitely not more worthy to die than anyone else then, huh?
It's instinct to proctect ourselves and survive
Tbh I don't think that you would stand there and let someone hurt you
I've seen trolleys in british movies
There are still people that trust Trump too
Tbh I dropped rotsh because of the possible romance with raphtalia
I never got the it's ok to own slaves vibe from the show
Thomas Jefferson used to have slaves and people don't harp on it because thats how things were back then
In xdu for april fools the noise could talk
Nephilim emote when?
Some people get hurt by the word weird
Posting nazi stuff is pretty rude too
Just cut them off already

Typical police

What is going on in those Minneapolis protests?
Man, I can't fall in love for shit
Is that a mood here too?
I thought u didn't like this sorta stuff lec?
That's why I try to not get involved with people too much
I'm fine making friends but tbh sometimes I don't treat them the way they deserve to be treated
I haven't had it happen since
I've loved before it's just that my heart is too picky
>  every single one of them abandoned by the government that told em to go die for em
I wish this better too

Y'all weren't complaining when oil prices were low were y'all?
Lastly, people can choose their job otherwise known as an MOS
If you don't want to see action that's fine. Be a water specialist or intel bud.
A lot of people join because their family members have served. I mean wouldn't you be proud of someone who fought in world war 2?
So what do you propose those kids do to get out of their situation?
Still a volunteer force though
The reason I'm so doubtful is that I've met people in the army that have been short, skinny, and pretty young so I'm not surprised if it's just a combination of these
I mean unless y'all interview that person without the gear it's just assumptions at this point
You can't 100% tell under all that gear
It's possible that the interviewee is female with that high pitched voice
Yea I didn't show up for a min
I can't tell if that's a kid tbh but I hope it's not
You can enlist at 17 with parental consent

Immortal technique has been the bgm for me
My cousin got pulled over yesterday and the cop handled it pretty well
I don't hate all police but eff the system
Have you tried talking to him in private?
Not calling them out  is.
Giving people another chance isn't being soft
One of the comments said 
"Blink twice if you've been hacked"
The military is strict on it's rules of engagement
It's because we worry about others
It'd be smart to carry a burner
I doubt that many protesters carry their phone on them
Hopefully
If anything this hurts small businesses because the don't have that money safety net that big chains have

Hated it but drank most of it
My dad handed me a Sapporo one time, said it was soda
He's like me without the trauma and drugs/bad influences
I want to try and build him up to be a better person than me
Same environment
Same school system
Probably
I mean, it's too late for me anyway. I just don't want my sibling getting involved with anything
Now what about alchohol and tobacco?
What about 13-15?
Does drug use stunt mental growth as a teen?
Also, we probably won't see or notice significant change till some time un the future since these things take time
A lot of officers are getting charged and or fired because we have recorded footage of police brutality. Hopefully that'll make officers think twice before just mindlessly hurting people and thinking you'll be safe because you were just following orders
I mean those 4 officers getting charged now so who's to say it hasn't worked at least a lil bit?

They legit had to have been scouting the house because I was only gone for 30 minutes
They took my shotgun and ps4 during broad daylight :((
If only I was at home at the time
Also, 3 years ago someone actually broke into my house so I wasn't taking any chances
I had thought the guy had come back
Gladly it was a false alarm and my neighbor just got a little too scared
Around 1 month ago someone left their wallet after having sorted through the belongings in my neighbor's car and I had my guard up
The kid said several lights were on and the backdoor was slightly open
I checked all the rooms except the basement
I came home to my neighbors kid( who was home alone) and he told me he suspected that someone was home
and a breather
I need to buy ammo
Imma post a meme in live shitposting that came to mind from CHAZ
Percentage points obviously
What you're saying is he has a small pp?
Nice
Anyone know if T-mobile has said anything regarding their service outage??
I've heard the word tulpa used before when someone tried to make an anime girl esque companion
Which one are you ok with?
What types of people get discriminated against there?
You from Poland right?
<@203444794737950720>
for a kids show
Sesame Street is woke
Thxs I might look into therapy one day
Like if you know you had a bad experience but you can't remember why
What if you can't remember from the shock?
If it's 1am you should try to rest
Like as if you were under sleep
I was thinking more along the lines of bringing out old memories
That's not what I had in mind
It sounds interesting
Rakhi, would you mind talking a little bit more on hypnosis?
Good luck
If I were to create another being I'd like it to take on my younger self
I wouldn't mind either
It would be nice to have someone remind myself to turn off the stove
Was he a Catholic priest?
Shocker
What are they talking about?
I think it might've been related to me hearing the word "hoe" early in the morning
Yea
<@170641480791228417> 
Probably not related
This kid just nods yea to anything XD
Shoulda bought her candy or sum cause that made my day lol
Also went to the dollar star and saw a cute lil kid begging me to help open the fridge door for ice cream. Asked her if her dad was a nearby employee of the store and the kid nodded yes because she looked lost too. Mom comes in and we both just giggle.
Managed to use that energy to find motivation for things I need now
I've been in a bad mood since 7 am and I can't change it
Y'all ever just wake up mad as hell for no good reason?
There wasn't a chance
If yall don't mind me askin
When did y'all first realize yall were plural?
Im mostly in the xdu channels so I didn't pick up on voy being different
Wow, thats poggers
> Isn't there some cases of plural systems having new headmates who speak totally other languages?
Is this real?
Rakhi you answered my second question before I could even type it out
Have you ever played chess against yourself, Meiyi?
Sub, do vegetarians argue over what is vegetarian and what isn't?
These posts are like a rabbit hole for me
Understandable
The context was in the comments section, but yea your right
God I hate Trump
Lectric posted this yesterday
If you can live without one, then you could live without any of em
Aren't cows important in India?
I think burger king has a vegetarian option
I mean civilizations always collapse and restart
By selling drugs and guns to the cartels
The war the US helped ignite
Yea
I'd at least be able to fit in Mexico
Plus I have a ranch there and some land
Italy sounds nice
We should just build our own country at this point
M√©xico it is then
wow
I mean they already have Hispanics in cages
I mean Canada lookin kinda nice
Well I wouldn't like to see nipple
||Especially if it's hairy||
Im from Indiana
What state you from Lec?
Just curious
My state has gun info that I needed to review before getting my hunting license
But you'd also gotta know what you're doing
It wouldn't hurt
Only to get taken into custody with his wife after having purchased 4 rifles and inciting hatred against jews and muslims
That guy got released from prison in 2009
Think about it
I mean being stabbed more than once is kinda torture already
Especially if it was in different parts of the body
It says he planned to torture the guy he stabbed 20 times
Torturing and burning down churches
Fuck varg too
Just googled lost prophets
That guy is sick in the head
That article came out 4 months after his death
I thought these were just rumors
I meant as in I gave him the benefit of the doubt
Idk why It was so hard for me to see this tho?
I'll still bump some of his songs because I think the money goes to his mom and kid but I can't ride with X no mo
I def ain't getting that RIP xxx tattoo now
Guess that settles it
I've always been torn
I like his music but knowing he did that kinda makes his music hit different now
Did xxx really beat up his girlfriend?
A friend of mine almost died from a drug cocktail
Luckily, the hospital pumped the drugs out of his stomach in time.
He's doing wayyy better now thank god
Stay strong
Also, I find myself saying the wildest things
To be honest, I'd rather *not* be horny so much because it can get pretty annoying.
But Trump thinks it's an organization
It is
Rahki posted it this morning

Ill pull it up from this morning
The red triangles?
Lost the election
Al gore won the polls
You shouldn't beat yourself up too hard over this Kaiyo
Oh wow
Why do people hate the Romani so much?
Ahh, the good old nature vs nurture topic
I'll die in my dreams sometimes but I won't get worked up about it if it's a normal dream
Are they nightmares or normal dreams?
<@354236264595324928> 
Anyway, how much do you recall from your dreams?
As some1 who's hanged pi√±atas I know that ain't it

People have lived straight lives and have had families before realizing their sexuality haven't they?
<@284390402210136064> Since when did you notice your sexuality? Earlier, when I said you wouldn't be able to know. Would you have realized sooner rather than later, or never at all, depending on the environment you were raised in?
If they never developed wouldn't that be more of a miscarriage type situation?
Could you be a little clearer?
I might have misunderstood you
> would they develop the system if exposed to a different environment?
But, would you be as openly as you are now?
Would you even be able to tell?
True
I mean, you wouldn't be able to know?
All I can say is we appreciate your work( as someone that has been in critical condition before) and hopefully you can teach that guy that was just watching you to check the pulse next time
Are you an EMT right now?

Also this isn't a 1 time thing for D1
negligence ain't an excuse
It hurts to think about everyone who's gotten sexually assaulted/abused/etc just because they want to play their favorite video game
On of the main reasons I'm even into smash as much as I am is because of my younger brother who has gone to tournaments since he was 12

Sad day for the smash bros scene
Idk if I can ever let my younger sibling go to locals anymore with everything that's going on
My past has given me a lot of trauma but, even so I've still done a good job at bouncing back.
Like the infamous tattoo I got "no regerts"

Sorry to interrupt but, 
RIP
Wouldn't be surprised
I saw ANTI defend someone
Guess they weren't good people to begin with
True
Ngl I think the problem comes from the video games themselves
People spend too much time in game that they forget how to act irl
I've definitely got blackout drunk my first couple of times drinking,
Luckily I was blessed with a responsible friend that babysat me

We all knew Kanye was going to run eventually
Btw I broke the news to my little brother and he handled it better than expected
Smart
This is gunna be hard for my little bro who loves watching his vids
SMFH
How old was zero when this happened?
For anyone who lives in the U.K.
Is it true that y'all have knives banned
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
I mean
Sadly I live in the city
It's fun if you have acres of land in the country to shoot
<@456226577798135808> I own for both
Stayed until the situation de-escalated
USA
I don't have any proof because I was ready to call 911
He was finna get whupped
The litter-er got defensive
I just saw someone pull out a gun over some trash
Kinda off topic but don't litter guys/girls
<@195044406343106560> https://youtu.be/vVuEST8RdL8
We'll have to wait and see
I felt the need to make this public since I said it in public
I'll definitely be stricter on myself
<@!106866895076003840> I wanted to clear everything up from earlier  and apologize. I'll be open to any and all criticism
The thing with being popular is that you know your fans are going to go after someone anyway
It happens with real sports stars all the time
Hopefully legal action starts to take place
The community shoulda been there for him instead of banning him
I mean Zack is still a minor so therfore he can't consent regardless if he sough it out or not
He's gotta be hiding something
I think sky williams is nervous because a lot happened at his house
When the going gets real, the real get going, which obviously doesn't include em
<@170641480791228417> it's a good thing you have dem "hands"
Like, I saw a meme of a butter knife being off limits
<@195044406343106560> You vote?  If so for whom will you be voting for
He will if I vote for Kanye
<@195044406343106560> rarely goes outside of <#336298054724485131> or <#371105434771390465>
Sorry for derailing
I'm still  going to vote third party regardless
My vote for jo jorgenson won't matter
Anyway, it's getting late for me 
If you ever want someone to talk to on discord we ain't goin nowhere
A lot of good people can be found thru volunteering
So what type of people do *you* wanna be around then?
I can see where you come from even though it ain't alright to generalize
Also keep in mind that, you can be there to make friends, that then might introduce you to other people
Sometimes they even get held together in the same space as card games
I still chat with people i've met at video game tournaments
I mean, these are just ideas until covid restrictions loosen up
or you could just spectate and chat about your fav decks
Card game shops allow for playing with others
Yu-gi-oh, Magic, or Hearthstone?
Tell us a lil bit bout yo self
Aite, so what do ya like to do?
Did ya ask?
Maybe it was their birthday?
?
The hardest part will be starting
Just post pics
Cause it requires less
Insta is a better
It's a double edged sword
Connects make it easier to get into groups
You can use social media to build up connects
Social media?
I've met people at gyms or at bars
They let you in at 20?
It's never too late to make any
It's better with friends tho
You could also look at it from this angle
You paid to have fun
Not to mention that he ain't a üêç
Yea, he's one of my favorite players
I've never even made a list of my top 10 here
Am I even surprised you know so much about me
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
This alongside other things got me tearing up now
I just hope leaves her at this point, brother is too damn hurt and I feel like he still loves her
The icing on the cakes is that some people ||praised Jada||
<@195044406343106560> I hopped on Facebook because of work, only to see people clown Will and remind me of that mess. Seeing his face like that, especially on memes as the punchline got me in my feelings
Is your brother older than you?
Isn't Ted Cruz the ~~zodiac killer~~ politician from Texas?
Rush Limbaugh a clown
If he doesnt respect you then I wouldn't fight it.
All it'll end up doing is causing strain in the family dynamics with them still being ignorant
What?!
I used to get hella anxiety talking in spanish as a kid/young adult because people would tell me I didn't "talk right"

Turning election day into a national holiday is pretty smart
I'm surprised that it's not already something people have brought up before though

Oh that prolly doesn't hurt
He's been causing you so much trouble that it's only fair
Now tell him to get tested
Good luck Dess
People can make it work it's just not for everyone
>Like Kanye once said, always sign a prenup.
Yea
When you say fuck it lets get married
Unless she/he is crazy
It wouldn't hurt to put yourself out there and find out what works for you
<@354236264595324928> you tryna get married or just find a girlfriend?
> A sexual, non-romantic relationship
People learn the hard way that feelings ain't that easy
Flights seem pretty cheap
I might go to europe to meet my irish friend one day
It's just platonic tho
I'm meeting up with someone I met on discord in august
<@189146272865845248> I'd work on myself for a lil bit if money's tight. Good luck!
I'm usually pretty straightforward with it
Sum of this only y'all know about or can find out about
Eins right
I know for a FACT
Naw theres love for the thicc
<:HibikiDab:688190074395164696>
I wouldn't recommend the army esports to anyone who is a civilian. Everyone in the army knows take what a recruiter says with a grain of salt
My swab test just came out negative too
Meiyi is on the money
Wow
I've met some british soldiers in joint training exercises 
They were cool , but they were probably hand picked so I have a biased view
They usually get out tho
Thank god
But there are left leaning people
So it's more conservative here for sure
It honestly depends on who's in charge
It can also be a toxic pool where you hate life
It can be a good community where you make close bonds w others and find a lot of support w each other, especially if you have good leadership
Not every MOS is like that, but most recruiters will still try to get you to be infantry or sum other intense job even if your ASVAB or GT scores are high enough :((
That's how I got in
Yea
It's scary
Trump has a lot of support from people tbh
China's ego is too big for that
If good people leave Hong Kong, what will happen to the rest that can't make it?
I think it's because of it being a relatively new concept for most people
Actually, I might put chris on one of my photos
Gotta assert that I'm a weeb
I think my bio is carrying me rn
I actually don't like to swipe too much
I matched up rn, but I guess you just gotta take it easy and be patient
Just redownloaded tinder
I feel like I rarely match up with people even tho I get likes.
It's like they're trying to lure me in to paying
Ah ok
So like ethnic jews come from Isrealites?
I'm trying to explain this to someone but I don't know how
Or is it just a religion?
Is Jewish an ethnicity?
Don't forget Sephardic Jews too
So it was negligence

Circles really went hard in the paint
I was worried that Ruby wouldn't be able to whale anymore
Sometimes you just gotta let go
You can do everything right and still not be able to reach someone Oct.
Pouring you heart out to someone only to get stabbed in the back is as bad, maybe even worse
You are most definitely a good person Matt
I've probably seen your post only to not say anything. I just don't know what to say or be scared that I might say the wrong things
To be fair to Aria, she has explained things before only to not get anywhere, which can seem kinda frustrating
I don't hate em, I pity em
<:Rorry420:582812716582830101>
I can't tell you about ASIP because I've only been on the moon everytime I've watched it
Fuck, I started in elementary
It's because we all watched these shows in middle school
Probably a lot that I'm missed as a kid
I'll rewatch it
The main issue is that we watched em as kids with no supervision
I think if handled correctly, shows like South park ain't so bad
White supremacy and antisemitism existed long before south park and will most likely continue to exist
They don't always have the best representation
Speaking of debates

Homer and Peter griffin are so hard to watch
I like the serial killer guy better than homer

Even if you are f2p it eats at your time
Some positions are also a bit more lenient, like a 3pt shooter just has to shoot 3s
So they last longer
It is
Most basketball players tend to be better athletes than those who play other sports
No, teams just won't sign em up if they can't keep up
Basketball players can play up to age 40

You can still build your body up but ya gotta really stick with it and put more effort into things than if you were already maintaining that

Nice to see you back Lec!
I remember Trump not wanting to start a war with North Korea though
People really believe that a different system of government can fix issues that people have always shown throughout history?
That's rough
I never hear anything from Tennessee
I just assumed the quiet meant everything was ok
Tennessee or was it Kentucky?
Y'all would really hand over more power to the federal government?
This ain't it chief
They aren't very trustworthy
Tbh I don't expect states to fix themselves either tho
*remembers the whole civil war and civil rights movement*
I can totally see the states raise the cost on imports/exports to each other for petty reasons if we were to separate
US splitting up would be a bad thing
I feel I ain't got no rights, the stores aint got rights either
NZ isn't as big and diverse as the states though
You can do interesting things without it being having to be conflict
I'd take the boring life 100% of the time

It might be a similar situation to what you go through

How do I help someone get over a fear? Someone I know is scared of the dark
This got me so heated
Sadly enough, these types of people have always existed and will continue to pop up
I've mostly seen white people wear masks near here. Everyone else still does it too ,but poc kinda been lax since lockdown ain't in effect anymore
It still sucks if you don't have that option to not go
Does the trip include them?
Is it fear? Is it pride? 
Whatever it is, you gotta toss it aside cus it ain't helpin you out
You know you have a problem, that's a big first step.
Next, ya gotta figure out what's not letting you?
You gotta dig in deep and ask yourself that
Changing isn't going to be easy 
If ya can't do it by yourself look into getting outside help.
No one said you have to deal with things alone
Change isn't ever easy
Don't ever think you aren't deserving of help, cus you are
No, you're not

I would never come out to my parents but, that's ok because there can and will be other people to go to.
The economy can be terrible and you should still be able to find work

What if they comment on my posts?
I don't want co-workers seein anime thighs
Newsfeed I guess
If I add someone in facebook with anime pics, will their posts show up on my timeline?
Cus I go dummy mode when my heartbeat skips
Like, I rarely ever find other people attractive or interesting so when I do, I gotta check myself
I don't really chase.
I just worry that I might be too bold in my approach sometimes?
Wish I could help you, but I got nothing
At what point when trying to talk to someone and trying to date them, does it become inconsiderate?
Just take it off every once in a while 
Even in a place as populated as Chicago,  there are many moments where I can take off my mask because I'm 6ft apart from people
Out of 50 I uploaded 2 to tinder
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Sometimes I'm glad I wear a mask cus these selfies got my ass lookin like
I don't think you can force some things to happen
They just do
Like, where I'm at now, I can go to the movies by myself and the mall without worrying about being alone
I don't exactly know for sure 
I guess some things helps me be content with myself include doing things that I enjoy, focusing on a career, and knowing that love comes and goes.
Both
I usually don't pick up on change right away.
Three weeks ago when I hung out with someone is when I noticed
These last couple of days I've actually felt kinda happy again <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I always wear a mask and keep my distance too
As someone who went to sightsee in Chicago for the weekend, I know it wasn't safe ,but I needed to go outside and interact with people again
I'd take a bullet for several irl friends
Maybe I haven't used the social media or the internet long enough but, I ain't doin for everyone here what I'd do for someone irl
> you'll fucking hate every single thing they do. Not because of anything they are doing *wrong*
This is a real thing tbh
I guess it depends on what you define as a relationship
I can say with certainty that most of my irl relationships are stronger than my online ones
Yeah, I can at least agree with that
> You don't actually get to know a person through the veil of online interaction
It depends on the other person tbh
Getting up close physical is a necessary thing for a lot of people.  Virtual hugs don't hit the same and I ain't even getting started on romantic. 
Not to mention being able to get  information off of body language, which is a big deal for me. You can't always trust words
This convo seems less about online/offline and more about a deeper dive in the relationships
You can talk to people how you want too tbh, regardless of it being online or offline
> Online relationships don't work
Ah, I see now why Shemmy got so defensive.
I could at least visit their house or something irl
Also, whatcha going to do when that online person can't be contacted? 
Nothing
Compared to being a dependant under the same roof
I mean you can live close to someone and not interact with them as much because you deal with your own life
Maybe you won't care about it as much as an adult because you live your own life away from them ? It'd still be a lot to handle tho
<@263534352422404096> Try taking a break from em. Harder to get over someone if you talking to em everyday

Also, people know ,but they'll say things like why'd the try to come to the US
It wasn't as bad as it is now

She is a real one
Wow
I liked tulsi gabbard
> Also to be clear, there were totally people who voted for Trump because he's racist, they're just not why he won
Trump's people voting for Trump cus he's racist, which I agree is a  naive take
Lanks sayin that it doesn't matter who you vote for?
It's almost like we're in <#336297840529899522>
I don't think Biden will win this year tbh
Lack of sleep will do that to you
I've met these people irl
They just aren't patient enough
Same as Isk
The option is there but it's frowned upon
Thanks
Lets say I got a metal plate in my body
How would that change how my body reacts to hot/cold weather?
I got cold once on sunday morning and I haven't really warmed up since
OPSEC or something similar probably
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
When my best friend's aunt died last year, I took a long drive, ate at a soul food place she recommended me, and shot some hoops all while thinking that she lived her life to the fullest.
It's harder to remember the small little details, especially when you got a lot going on Meiyi
> I _used_ to be super close with X but kinda gradually stopped being that close the more I realized the scummier shit he did over the years.
That'll do it
Or maybe you were already expecting it in a way. 
Like when my great grandfather died, he was already sick with no other outcome possible
It doesn't have to hit right away
Sorry to hear such news. I hope you find some peace and strength for both you and your grandmother.
It's like printing copies out
Can't wait for those glasses to tell google how horny I am
Oh shit
Kata I thought she was just a meme
Sabotaged?
Inb4 voter fraud
Im eating steak n shake
Was gonna say fuck
Compared to uhh...
Bastards aint even a bad word
An American one
Didn't know much about that tbh
Yea
*phenomenally*
<:RobinGasp:662186851444064257>
*I wanna see peace*
Bruh
Elizabeth warren clowned herself but he should just let it go
Trump told em to stand down and stand by
People talking over each other
Maybe it's a midwest thing?
see
I mentioned her once and no one said anything
But I didn't know she was popular
I mean yea
Joking about your children? Seems to me like slight jabs
She was slowly starting to change since like last year
I'm pretty sure it was a tongue in cheek statement
Which is why I don't mess with it like I used to
Rap is full of misogyny tho
I have 1 of his songs on my spotify but I ain't really know him too well
what's JPEG?
You went from 
> I had a few ciggies and that's ti
> to It's just like every few weeks
With cigs and dip
I've seen it happen
I trust your judgement Meiyi
They do
I know so many people that struggle with tobacco
Do you have a smokin issue?
<@170641480791228417>
Mike Pence is strongly anti-abortion and supports conversion therapy for LGBT
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vp-mike-pence-karen-pence-test-negative-for-coronavirus-spokesman-says
Beat me to it
Having had Pence as governer? I'd rather wish for Trump to survive
Good luck and take care Meiyi!
Like if ya get the craving, to just buy some gum instead
I hear gum works
It's confirmed that he doesn't
Pence was governer of the state where the KKK had it's headquarters. Don't think he'll lose too many Trump supporters
It takes time
Pump the brakes a litte there
Arrested?
Why not let Lec find out on their own that it won't work?
You a discord user
> what if someone sees you as weak because you are a medic though.
Sounds like a them problem to me
Think of getting your flu shots
People think of something else to distract them from it
Ye
<:worryClown:450199347188203521>
It was still some
Just watched the vid
I get what your point is
<@383228351168512001> the word ||porchmonkey is a slur that refers to black people as being lazy||
and the process starts over again
Some other big country would just say hi
For sure
I don't think Hawaii's problems would be solved by it
Best course of action would be independence
Did they talk about Hawaii in the debate last night or did that person just bring it up?
<@255412045933969408>
Unrelated
Go ahead
I still see Trump winning, regardless
But it doesn't help either
Nope
People actually will vote Kanye
Oh god
Now who would do that?
I fucking hate the system
That's silly these days?
President Carter
Lil Wayne Is a stage name anyway
Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. is his real name
Although, Lank might just be referencing a song he wrote
Pretty sure Lil Wayne isn't involved in politics
Yes
I've followed him for a while and his mental state is nowhere good not to mention his conservative policies
Kanye presidency would be terrible
I don't see anything changing until the people in those organizations start to change. The problem is that all the decent people end up leaving
I actually brought this up yesterday to another soldier in a discussion and he was *indifferent* towards what the US does
Best bet would be some sort of internal collapse. I see no reason why the US won‚Äôt stop doing what they do already.
nowadays
global policeman is a cover up for private interests
What's the distinction they make?
I most definitely have learned from my time in service and made strong bonds, but I also feel like I have had my emotions invalidated at times and have just felt truly miserable. Your environment (Job, Location, Chain of Command and peers) will have the most impact on how you will perceive your experience. People who do jobs like water unit specialist or a human resources specialist will generally have a better work atmosphere in comparison to a combat job. Who you get as leadership and fellow soldiers will be a huge dice roll. I would not recommend it unless **you** have clear goals in mind on what you want to get out from your time in service. I‚Äôm not sure what the benefits are in the UK, but in the states they offer decent healthcare, basic housing allowance, tuition assistance among other things.
Anyway, good night everyone 
It's about to be 2am
That's how it is for the US...or at least it should be. I sadly don't doubt that people have gotten away with it though.
What type of civilian control do you have in mind?
We get screwed over hard by Military Courts if we don't
"Only lawful orders are to be followed"
"you must follow orders"
While this is a problem, I honestly don't think it was as big of an issue given that the military stresses putting the institution over the a person. An example would be Edward Gallagher, a Navy seal whom even after being pardoned by Trump, service members weren't happy.
No one stares at walls Rady <:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Thanks mac
Also, I can't find it in me to sue the person who rear ended me for reasons that I don't feel comfortable talking about
My front left one is fading out tho, I bought a new bulb and replaced it but it doesn't seem to have fixed it. The chip on the inside is good and the wiring is good so it has to be the whole light itself. I hope it doesn't run out before the aftermarket lights I bought online ship home
Just one on the rear right
Will I get a ticket for driving without a light? I don't know when I'll be able to fix it
No one got hurt
I chose to see if he was ok
It was either go after the person liable or stay back and check if the guy who rear ended me was ok
feeling like shit tho
Yea
I got into a car accident
<@!170641480791228417> Can't believe my luck today
"Why worry about them when you can throw em in jail is a take I seem to be hearing in my state"
Hope Gwen is alright <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I dont think this would work in every country
I got mine after being in the woods for like 3 weeks
Yea
I've had boots rub some skin off before
You could've just stubbed your toe or maybe you wear boots?
Bruise that wasn't disinfected quick enough
Small cut
I've had an infection before and it sucks
I would go
<:SerenaOhoho:671901865625124870>
preventative antibiotics
Healthcare here is different that in Australia
<:borryHug:457521689472008203>
Don't forget to stay safe y'all
I'm just also worried cus my mom went to go visit them on sunday
Thxs y'all
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
Grandma, Aunt and Lil Cuz got Corona
> words he has said himself
> media fabrication
Jee I wonder why
<:worryEyes:438351453669556234>
I enjoy seeing his points torn down
Maybe too open minded
> The government has tanks
Soldiers don't have to obey orders
The biggest issue is that people are comfortable with the status quo
> That's an accountability nightmare
Agreed
Gun restrictions make it so citizens are powerless against cartels since the local police forces are corrupt
It doesn't work
Look at Mexico
Friend of a friend does the old hoodie trick
As a victim of a mugging once, more likely than not throwing money at em works
Lank hasn't met these people and it shows
> electric cars are driven by sissies and pussies and words that are banned in this server
I heard this like last week irl
Trump supporters can hide their dislike for Hispanics under the guise of illegal immigration. In 2016, build the wall was a main talking point of Trump. If calling a whole group of people rapists and putting them down isn't in line with what white supremacists do then Idk what is :mikushrug
General chat got serious for a bit
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Is simpleflips in the clear?
I know his private life has been full of controversy but I don't recall him being a terrible person
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Thats something
Well
He rejoined
I can just ping him for his thoughts
Not really outta nowhere
It seems like that's how they had felt for a while
Yep. Matt had posted this earlier
Sorry to hear that. Hopefully ya friend heals from this.
All I got from that was that Is that Chase is a horrible person who runs a Discord server? I still don't know about the community this took place in.
Who is Chase Pritchard?
Yeah, that makes sense
Maybe it's not meant for y'all then huh?
US
If it wasn't a slight problem, it wouldn't be against discord tos to post lolis wouldn't it?
ü´Ç
I don't have a problem with prostitution as long as it's regulated.
I misread the line "exceptions or factors for consideration". I had thought that the items listed below *wouldn't* have been enough to warrant prosecution.  I fucked up pretty much
Looking over the list, I did overreact to some of them though
Prostitution and Criminal threats though?
So would that LA county be considered lawless?
"The persons ability to pay shall be considered"
Imagine AI trucking in Alaska
Midwesterner here. It feels like Black males can also get socially pressured into sports like Football and Basketball, especially if a dad or uncle played it back in the day or if yo friend group has people on the team.
A lot of black culture in the US is kinda homemade in a sense
Give him the serious answer anyway

Meiyi must've snuck some bucks under the lil sisters pillow
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Speak for yourself
Not interrupted
Because if my mom died, I'd want her body to rest easy
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
Let Meiyi talk!
Choosing to give out my organs is different than having them forcefully taken out
I mean, I don't mind if ya take my organs but, if you try to do that to a dead loved one, we gonna fight
the act of treating something sacred in a sacrilegous or disrespectful way
It would be an act of desecration to me to forcefully remove a dead loved ones organs.
If the accident is that bad they wont be able to identify you
I mean
And what if they don't have a drivers license on hand?
Once I was in the ER for a bad accident, I was barely in any condition to answer the nurse.
You might not be able to do it when alive either though
Should've said something sooner <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I think that people should have a time limit on an opt out because that body is only going to decay.
Oldest child perhaps?
That should be a spousal thing only, in my opinion
Tbh
<:khaled:274391084233129986>
Beef with *Motherfucking Smokey the bear*, of all people
Really?
Hope y'all get some nice sleep
Yea, Imma exit out too then
Good night
That's why you bring it up?
WAIT, What!
So sapphic is exclusively wlw?
Can confirm that things are exactly the way Meiyi describes in the states too
Senate elections
Nuker is from Georgia
Scrolled back up and I see the context now <:portdoll:794024353518977065>
You honestly can't tell anymore
Kanye west and Joe exotic have attempted presidency before
Was this really by him?
I'm assuming since it's in DC, you'd need permission on a Federal level
*we*
Wow
I just see that as being impartial.
hopefully
I could see the Pentagon doing something
Yes
Smh
Figures
I needed that batman one. I'm too tense rn
It's still there
Doesn't make em *seem* quite as high
Yes
That CIA one got me in tears
I'll pass on the hug
Gimme some teargas
He has Nazi tats on too
Smh, now I wonder why yall don't know
Alolan coronavirus
Which I most definitely heard about yesterday
A pipe bomb counts under I.E.D.
I watched the video for slim shady and I am now highly disappointed
Yes
Heck, once we had to actually use it because of an angry trespasser
We had shooter drills
<a:Bonkcat:766366204100345906>
Loris should get to bed
Marks a good guy
Robinhood isn't the *main* problem
They are both revenge porn
ecchi isn't even close to hentai
<:portdoll:796600541874487326>
I don't feel that it is
There can be more than one
Goblin Slayer is anime Batman
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Es3chlMWMAAcar3?format=jpg&name=large
I'll say something in <#371105434771390465>, dw
Anyway, if you google shield hero and vic...you'll find
I thought he was most famous for his role as Broly?
It's a slippery slope
<:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
I'd call that dangerous
how are goblins not dangerous? On their own sure, but they almost destroyed the town
But knowing *people* back then, I wouldn't be surprised
They can
Scroll up
I just think it's a stretch to link a fictional species that is evil with not much thought behind it's conception with a very much real groups of people
It was in response to this
*Wow, an inferior race! Let me just associate with them because these thats how some white supremacists think?*
I've never played DnD, but I know penalties can kinda make sense in a general sense like a species from a cold climate not adapting well to a warm climate
Armis has heard it enough times to comment on it. At this point I'd be surprised if they didn't know
Armis can handle it
You should watch it
Someone somewhere out there is gonna tell you that you are wrong
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I'll definitely check it out
Try to think of anything that gives you energy
Productive mood
What gets you in the mood?
Take a break from discord and games
What's stopping you from finding work?
First comment said "fowl play"
This hits hard when you realize you were born two weeks apart
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
they lived and breathed running
or some peeps I've played soccer with
You haven't seen my lil cuz then
Running being fun, that's subjective
I also think it depends on the culture
The type of car also has a big effect. I used to own a Mustang which is RWD and even with snow tires, I couldn't drive past 10 mph
Rain is no where near as bad as Ice
I also want to bring up weather. In the north we prepare for this sorta stuff since it's pretty common and I'm not sure how much a factor this can be in southern states especially
Stay safe yall

Ive seen National Guard troops drive in  convoys here on the state roads just fine
Humvees are the easiest military vehicle to buy over here
You can buy alot of other types of military vehicles I assume and even stuff like a fire truck. I remember a soldier once bought a firetruck on base and got shit for it
Las Vegas and Texas, alot of other states just seem to rent you tanks
He was on meth??!
When not in use
Yea, things are never loaded up
It's a trust thing I figure
<:blobsweat:523906344076705818>
Thanks, gonna start wearing my funky sunglasses before heading out now
Is it just me or does the sun hit harder in the wintertime? I'm always stepping outside and I end up blind for like 15 seconds and this never happens during the summer
Sounds like Latin America for ya
Wrong channel but ok
What happened to talking about anime?
butterknife meme just another name for the English im assumin?
You should be fine, Matt
I mean, in most cases you should be fine since you aren't Hispanic
But if they know me or are a friend of a friend they will sorta give me shit
Normally I can tell people if they aren't friends or family to give me space no problem
You could tell em that you haven't been feeling so good lately
Lotsa of hugging, handshakin, maybe even a peck on the cheek
For Hispanics, Id say yea
Personal space wise?
I could prolly help
I've known people that have used this to get away with shit
It's pretty common I'd say
we not British
fam
the queen had a bday
I didnt even know
there
Hes 26yo
His bday is the 21st
4/20?
Baseddddd
*blimp
I can be attracted to someone over time and I can also be left smitten, especially if they've made a good first impression
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I have so many questions rn since this happened in my city
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
*"it is my god given right as an American to carry a longsword*" --some random guy
üò±
tfw I actually have some throwing stars somewhere

I know most stores have a no guns no knives rule
So I was joking with my coworker about bringing a machete to work and was curious if walking around in public spaces with like an item like that is illegal?
This is disgusting
<:hibiki_confused:584042438738313243>
Even undercover cops?
That's like teens in horror movies telling serial killers to show themselves
I'm glad your district is politically active though
I don't trust the kids under here to vote
Don't forget the homophobes saying it's gay to dress like a man
I'm sure there are a lot more examples to draw from but the point Im trying to make is that we are slowly moving there
Have you seen how celebrities dress? They don't care. Google Jaden Smith or Young Thug
I feel like y'all gave the poster the attention they wanted
someone from another server
reminds me of Koko
It'd be a waste of time
its looks like a discord type website
Take care of yall health guys
we wouldn't ever go this farrr
we all just spend time and money on gacha but like
They all  Genshin

and people wore them because it was cool
Like when Kim Kardashian made the Hindi wear a trend
People get mad at cultural appropriation is what they mean when they say "my culture isn't your aesthetic" , but it isn't relevant in this situation because Gear is set in Japan
My guy, you just described cultural appreciation
Japan didn't even want to let foreigners in for a long ass time
The point of tourism is to make money
Not everyone does though
that's a great idea
you know
there's a public high scool nearby and I don't wanna be trespassing
not to mention it's a lot safer than using the streets or park
I remember seeing a rando use the tracks in HS at 6am and I would be cool to run around a track again if I could
Are schools considered public or private property?
I'm donating cus of that sick country accent
Do you like kids? If not then you aren't a pedo
I think this is more of you should think for yourself situation tbh
Honestly you take things too seriously.
You can always collect another card again
Lank, you ever met a Catholic?
I'm not 
I should just back out of the convo tbh
in every possible way
Censor everything on the internet
Maybe just have an age limit on manga reading
I think the readers should know better than to want an abusive relationship because they read it in a manga once.
If you want to potray an abusive relationship in a manga you can. I just won't read it
I'd say encouraged because it isn't discouraged
When I read a yaoi manga with an abusive pair I don't go "this is the relationship I aspire to build with others"
It's just something that makes my life feel less like shit since there could be worse
Idk how Fenny views it though
I agree
I wasn't trying do deny this and myb if that's how y'all saw it.
I just really didn't care about it's effects on others. I should do better
What Armis is trying to say is that it still effects people regardless of whether or not you think it doesn't or if it just doesn't affect you
<@84811738653929472> <:Zababies:672238628398956594>
There's a certain point where you ask yourself if you can handle her
It's fine
Is it financial?
You don't owe him shit
politics and money always getting in the way of solutions
But u are a fox
Cypher is kinda quiet rn
It's also Florida
conservative
my neighbors are elite
wow
Fox news
after the whole president thing happened
I thought they were outlawed
It's ok to be wrong
Honestly, no one cares even if true
Join some clubs
Start some hobbies
Good luck with whatever you want to choose to do
It didn't say hay back
The police system can be a lot better but I am glad they exist. I had to call them when I was younger on family before
<:kirisweat:655092291643637760>
What claims?
Yo Dr. K knows his stuff
You can use "Latino's" when describing a large group of people regardless of gender.
Are people just mad that it's a term to describe Latinos made by people who aren't Latino?
I was having shower thoughts and was wondering why the word Latinx is a big deal. Like I've never even heard of the word till early 2021. I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of context.
Off the top of my head "What's up my friend", "amazing", and "sexy"  are the most common words I see
but it's less mythology and more conversational words and adjectives
Exactly
I hear telenovelas import words all the time for the cool factor of another language
Neymar killed it
My parents accept English words all the time but they also live in the United States
The twitter versions of they/them
How you gonna modify they them though? El they? La them üíÄ
And you won't have as much resistance from people wanting to keep everything the same
Why don't y'all just steal non gendered words from other pre existing languages? It would be easier to get the point across
McAfee like the web defender?
I would just make my own version set in China that way it could be more appropriate thought
I personally wouldn't do it because it could be seen as ignorant
I guess they could üíÄ
BS topics will usually die down if you ignore em anyway
Even if it wasn't a trash site, sometimes it's better to just stay off topics like these
Well said.
Honestly news like this just I try to avoid
That's stupid. I can't believe a lil extra testosterone bars you from the Olympics
Based?
That's tuff
New orleans?
Stay safe!
After HS everything just fades away
Not really much advice here since I didn't get bullied but any drama I went thru in HS didn't stay with me

You can't nuke your entire population if they all get tired of your BS

He's kinda corny sometimes but I like his trolling type vids
Any1 watch nuxtaku?
I mean 13 years ago....
> As long as you don't forget that in universe the movie are propagande !
Im not gonna ask
What movie?
Is it fine if I skip ahead?
what are its strongest points?
I might watch at least 3 eps because of the symphogear collab but It looks dated
is nanoha worth watching?
Is that meep city?
That pfp tho
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
Spoilers ||that mom a ****||
So just finished the first nanoha movie
Nana mizuki makes the best openings too
^
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
His name is "tusk" for a reason
The way they were bold with the show was refreshing
Cross ange is dope
Guess I'm gonna bust out Viking alestorm
Can't find nanoha
I just rewatched s1 fresh off of watching XV
Hibiki, miku, and tsubasa stand out the most
Also lupin the third feels like its aged well
I played the mazingerz song and my gramps walked in the room lol
Flcl aged well
When I say dated I usually mean old
Don't worry he had braces 
He just didn't like to brush
I did the toothbrush thing with my sibling before it was a thing
I just started bakemonogatari
I usually go legal for convenience
If there are no legal ways then I guess
Any1 know who streamin Super Dimension Fortress Macross?
Also guess this means I can also finish land of the lustrous
Cause I'm binging
Time to do a free trial
Alongside chowder and flapjack
Yea gundam 00 is up there for me too
I want to ride it thru but idk
It took 12 eps to get gud
Hide doesn't get enough screen time it feels like
Hinami and Hide are aite
The characters are all unlikeable except for Riza and Jason
Just started tokyo ghoul

I swear I love symphogear! My fav char is hibikis dad! See I told u
I thought it was going to be super serious cus of the amvs lol
Is mob a comedy cus this shits so funny lol
Just started mob psycho its hella funny
> SNK 
What's snk?
Wouldn't be surprised if u ended up with a new fetish or two by the time u finish that show
Lotsa fanservice that one

I might be wrong tho
I'll screenshot when I get home
Funi has an option for 840p
I do 840p fine
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
It still takes a long time
If my internet didn't take days to torrent I wouldn't have to pay funi
:(((
To make time for xdu
Just quit work
If y'all want explicit yuri just watch hentai
Tbh anyone can tell miku and hibiki love each other
They even got 540p lmao
It turned out to be 810p lol

That mangas alright
<:MikuPanic:640289659452129310>
<:ShirabeSob:701475635025019000>
Wat is this manga?
I gotta read this
Subtext is cute sometimes
Like if the characters are shy or tsunderes
bruh yall talk about yuri everyday
I wish I had noticed 2 months ago when all I looked for was yuri
but then I was like, this girl is 14 year old gamer me personified
At first she was kinda annoying
wow yall feally dont like umaru chan huh?
Wow
With the music and the tournament hype
I think dragonball was the best
Made me mostly quit shounen
Dragon ball ||super was kinda ass||
From things like being prideful of his heritage to raising a family
Tbh goku's development is subtle
On pure reflex
My dumbass clicked on a spoiler
Noooooo
So like index is like captain america to railguns mcu?
Wow railgun got y'all kinda heated
I'll give the LN a try then
Is what y'all are telling me
So the index anime is bad and the LN is also bad??
I've read a manga spin off that looked pretty dope
So railgun yes or no?
not so much for the prequel
Is that the martian manhunter episode lmao
Not only were virgil's problems relatable but the way they went about solving them was neat.
Plus he was pretty funny and an overall badass
That show was woke
or justice league unlimited?
Any1 ever watch static shock?
Can I talk about cartoons here?

Same artist
Yes
She's from song of the nightwalkers
So what are some spicy domtext yuri titles?
<@195044406343106560>
It's yuri time
It has ||symphogear xdu au vibes||
My fav dc animated film has gotta be flashpoint
It shows how they got together
Justice league
||bloom into you is packing heat out the gate!my godd||
They are enjoyable
What good is a spread if it ain't good?
Stains not a villain
Name 1 villain in mha better than kid buu
If every1 was super fleshed out all the time it'd get kinda boring tbh
Broly from dbz is the definition of stagnant. He is a fan fav tho
üëÄ
Daddy Goku
Dbz wouldnt be what it is without the frieza saga which is the closest thing it has to a story
Tru
Nomu don't even think
Nomu vs all might was one of the better fights in mha
Dbs was booty and not the good type like Chris
Also dbs is not a part of this convo
Story wise dbz aint it 
But people enjoy it
It's appealing and fun
There is a reason why dbz is as popular as it is
All I'm tryna say is stagnant characters can still be enjoyable, even more so than fleshed out villains on **occasion**
I don't classify stain as a villain
Who's to say he just doesn't care to talk
Kid buu can feel
Preach Hanabi
Thank you
I'm talking about kid buu rn tho
Rock lee is da real üêê
Naruto was a simp who got carried by kurama
> I can't fantasize being Naruto personally
This
I think at this point we just have different tastes
Hanabi beat me to it
It was too late
Millh just eating popcorn rn lmao

Aite so we obviously not getting anywhere
Hanabi tapped out
Just like the show itself
It's thrilling
Y'all ever gone to a casino before?
Kakegurui is dope

Wow she's hella cute

Wat anime?
I don't know what this says about me
Idk why but in Tokyo ghoul || I ship kaneki x rize ||

Shaman king remake
Hxusjdhjsshhwhssgsvu
Are you bilingual?
That rocky style music is dope
You could also just go with the tier list template
Fin√© had to save her
When her and shirabe had that fight
Symphogear G
Hit too close to home
I just don't like how she tried to take the easy way out
But I just love every1 else a lot more
She's still fun
dess is my least liked gear
Maybe taiga too
No1 would be the only one on my list tbh
Persona and fire embul
Some video game in that list
No7 tho<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Respectable no1
Actually got me into anime
The only og anime I've completely watched

and I'm halfway through the monogatari series
I've seen bunny girl
What are some shows with supernatural/buffy/ x files vibes
Does symphogear fit?
Ah I see
Toku-like?
<:ShirabeSob:701475635025019000>
Also that side story
But mangaka said no
I read the manga thinking it'd be cgdct
Girls last tour was big sad
I mean not everyone can handle araragi
no toothbrushing
definitely more normie for sure
I got into bunny girl first
I've already watched in-spectre too
Posted a real harem in <#407060923078017026>

Hey, how do you finish a yuri manga?
|| Yu*riead* it ||
Action and romance work hand in hand
lol
Reading the post as you edited it made me dizzy
üëÄ
Not used to writing long posts so my thoughts might be a lil here and there
||I thought the relationship between Haru and mc was neither fast nor slow. Their contrasting character make for a really cute sweet/sour combo
Now what I was really interested in was the angel trumpet girlx chitaru romance. From the get go I figured it'd be too good to be true. I expected a plot twist from the moment they started telling us Chitaru's motive for being at the school. I liked the interactions between em but I wish they woulda shown us more between em. Loved the kiss at the end and the pic of what everyone is up to. ||
Might start the anime soon
Gotta lookup those doujins
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
||Also she goes from dodging bullets to losing in  uncharacteristic fashion||
I wanted to see more ||of the robot lady||
||it's a lil too short but it's too cute of a manga for me||
Haru and Azuma|| give me Karma and vibes from assasination classroom||
<@160142617940590594> Just read akuma no riddle.
||Dissapointed nobody died but, I like the wholesome ending||
||I'll help if touch boob

I needa to read that shit fam
Link

üòÇ
Or even dbz
My first anime is prolly pokemon or yugioh
But I prolly woulda stopped as a teen
Like I watched anime as a kid
Expect for Dbz
Wouldnt gone my whole life without anime
Thats actually what got me into anime
I've watched Saint seiya
Lololol
Thats the joke
I was 4 so I don't remember jack shit besides tuxedo mask saves the day
I have seen the dic dubbed sailor mon
Even we aint watch shoujo once would we even be here?
Story itself was great
Took me 8 years to get over the art style
My bff would tell me to watch aot everyday
I didn't like the animation for AoT at first either
Wait u viatnamese??
Og db has some cringey scenes that only work as humor in the 90's
Og dragonball aint that old too me
I prolly need more backstory and context
Because I do wanna see the gundam series with camille in it
I might watch parts of OG gundam
Kinda hard to go back
Nooooooooooooooooooooo
I had it loaded up in a tab on google but then I closed them all on accident
It was an older anime
Not sure
Along with another show
Ive seen u mention it here before
Ive never watched needless
Uhhh

Ur mom
Maybe in a day or two
Comics/anime included
Imma come back with a guantlet
Hax too stronk
Shemmy could atleast mind control them
Thats like 2 hours in dbz time
That galick gun beam battle took 2 episodes
Anything past raditz or maybe nappa is a no
Alright so
It took vegeta like 10 seconds to destroy a planet in early dbz
With her dying breath she literally pulled a chunk out tho
Also early Dbz is kinda weak
And the s1 gears put fine to sleep
We know fine did numbers on the moon tho
But if they can dodge the beams they can sorta keep up
I might try making an anime gauntlet for the girls
That's gotta be quick
Also aren't the SSJ beams reflected light?
And piccolo
Yea muten roshi could blow up the moon but he still gets slapped by raditz
Its safe to assume burning xdrive is past all that being in the final stretch and all
Well ignite and Alalgram have feats
Also they could probaby take on naruto/sasuke too
I def think they could in burning xdrive
That was s1 too
Strength wise the gears pushed back the moon
<@195044406343106560> Do you think XV gears could take on the vegeta,nappa,and raditz during the saiyan saga?
Lmao
What manga are you talking about? Sounds like a train wreck
Rental girlfriend is the one ||where he rents a girlfriend to show to his grandma but the grandma is friend's with the rental girls grandma so they fake a relationship||
The mc for that manga is the worst
I wonder if the anime for Scryed ends the same way the manga does
||looks at hanabi||
My stuff might me corny but it still be flyin over yall heads
a lot of books have an "index" and a "table of contents"
On par can also be used when playing golf
Index is good but, ||have yall seen the table of contents||?
It's a oneshot for anyone looking to cry
Any recommendations similar to this?
Anyone ever read love letter?
It makes SAO look like anime of the year
Smh can't believe some1 stuck that long
I dropped early on
It's just feels so forced and all the mc thinks about is your typical I'm horny shit.
Kanojo mo kanojo is kinda funny

Look I was just answering Raines question
We all know they lovers
He ain't gay, we just close
Also, I've fed my best friend before
Friendly as in best friend close, not lovers close
Because cousins can get away with being too friendly or close to each other
What's wrong with that?
Just friends like me and Hanabi
I just had a cursed thought

What anime has the no1 hypest fight?
Never seen fma and don't care for it
Don't see that every day
Someone else who lile hokuto no ken? Wow
If y'all really want a completely non toxic fandom
The Paw patrol fandom isnt toxic
Rick and morty
It did...
I just share whatever I'm watching atm
Im a first rate duelist with a first rate pfp
I remember hating bleach
Can't remember why
Takutooo punch
Monochrome slaps
Especially the soundtrack
I love it
Yes <@152896851660505088>
I like jojo but I don't overuse the memes
Jojo fandom I can believe
<@279341087494242304> as long as I liked the anime that's good enough for me. Shit, up until last week I didn't know other people liked star driver
I thought they were just married
Tarble had kids?
They can have kids with one
Checkmate
Boom
Saiyans are also people
Aren't furries people with an interest in anthropomorphic stuff?
Saiyans are interested in themselves
Actually, I wonder if I have the right definition of furry to start
Vegeta in oozaru is capable of complex thought
I mean they'd be fully anthro
<@195044406343106560> <@87512939107450880> <@279341087494242304>
It's big brain time
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Just need to start this one
I usually finish mech animes in one sitting
I remember from the September memes
Macross

Another aot meme
Western noir vibes
I fucked up my hashbrowns <a:ChrisRee:671980374418522132>
<:bigbraintime:616457937711529995>
Goku also gave some1 who was abusing his son a senzu bean
Piccolo died for gohan
Its not that goku bad dad
Its piccolo better dad
Inb4 italian dub
Yes
He woulda got knocked out the ring before he'd reach ss3 level

Really?
Idk now
He was before super
> Can't keep a species going if you ain't gonna reproduce
Not everyone marries to have kids
Look at HibiMiku
Piccolo just seemed better
Goku is a decent dad
Banger
https://youtu.be/vBm2sNYPAyo
He can't health regen if knocked out
If goku black can't do it, dbz broly can't either
Back to cyphers point
How would pre-goku fight goku Black do in the ToP?

I think the reason why it's so hard to remember is because It's so unstructured
https://youtu.be/5ApwVGT7LKA
<@195044406343106560>

Hatsune Miku the video game
<:SerenaWorried:665925475809493005>
I think yea

<:SerenaWorried:665925475809493005>
Well, youve posted ur basa figure in this exact channel before
BluRay disc?
Plush?
Symphogear figure?
I was surpised too
Yup
Musta been a different one then
I thought we had more?
I should still have it saved up on my PC
Took me a while
Remember when I posted 1/4th of the bee movie script?
Yo Hanabi
<:SerenaWorried:665925475809493005>
Just saying that theoretically someone could do it
Yea, I wouldnt do that
Discord has like a 2k character limit
I could also just manually ping at least 500 people
<:SerenaOhoho:671901865625124870>
There are people who dont know that though
It is
@everyone who here can speak Spanish?
Lets ask them
Out of all 2000+ people on the server, you asked one of the few people who could
I just found it funny
<a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>

<@!181591926636544002> we got another one
Before the hate bandwagon and even a little bit after
> Nobody cared for gt when super didn't exist
Latooni#4913 This is actually wrong
Goten was worse than Gohan
I mean its shit besides the Baby and 17 arc but still
**Wth**
**Ôø¶oÔø¶**
You never watched GT?
||Goku and Pan might be mistaken for siblings and you have a chance to have Goku actually bond with his grandaughter for more depth. Plus you'd get a female ssj 10 years earlier!||
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
||What if pilaf had turned gt goku into a Loli?||

Id recommend Assault Lily
Huh

Ill go 12 eps in then
Expectations are high right now and I got sights set on this
But Cypher compared this to Dragonball
Can't handle a whole season of this
Maybe 12 eps
How slow? Cus it has 48 eps
I just replied to the wrong text
Futari pretty cure
||The fight scenes felt like they weren't trying to hurt the other person||
So ||ep1 the fights are kinda sluggish. Is it because they are new to this or because it's a shoujo? ||
Reminds me of 6D audio
Thanks Millh

I got the opening when I was playing amq yesterday and the artstyle caught my eye
<@782841825069236236> Im debating with myself on whether I should watch Cyborg 009 or not? What do you think?
Its a pretty long shounen so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but you still get a good feel for the show with just these short clips
https://youtu.be/1G2a2px1IwU <@195044406343106560>
Nvmnd found it
Whats the name of this mech pls?

Quite the surprise
||It's Tanya Degurechaff||
So on ep 4 on Seraph of the end and I recognize a certain voice
<:genocide:655087951101034498>

No disagreeing here from me
Is that when scully got alien cancer
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>

The sexual tension between mulder and scully had me feelin blue balled
Buffy and Angel?
Lexi Luthor, you've seen X-files?
That show was like a gateway show for me

No spoilz pls
Im still reading the ln
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Hey, don't insult Mob tho
Itd make sense to have him built like this
But Saiki k is also a comedy
In comparison
He seems limited
I'll rewatch mob
He mostly has raw strength
He is stacked
Yea
<:portdoll:794024353518977065>
Ur kiddin
Really
Wait
Saikis best friend reminds me of Amiya

It's funny as shit bro, plus the way he evades dem girls
<:portdoll:794024353518977065>
Maybe I'll go eat some rabbit stew
Anyway I'm finna go eat

üëå
Jujutsu Kaisen tho
Trueeee, I tend to forget those scenes by the end of the show. I tend to forgive em for inconsistenty because of G being a bit long tho.
<:worryStare:441044706269331456>
What's wrong with the G gundam art?
Jesus got laid?
Hearing Shirabe in the opening is pretty nice

<@297554276539170826>
Cute
Best girl confirmed?
Two episodes into FMA and Edward won't shut up complaining about being short, which I'm kinda short myself so it just really bothered me
When he crushed his own *father* to near death and launched him onto an enormous comet all while enjoying it, that left me speechless
Goku: can ya give us a handicap?
Broly: is that another word for coffin? üôÉ 
He was an absolute psychopath
Maybe the second and third Broly movie didn't have character, but that first one, even with so few lines was amazing and you really felt fear and awe.
This is just a subjective. I dropped FMA because of Edward being an annoying brat
You aren't wrong. I still have yet to go to an anime convention to this day plus I really didn't interact with the anime community until maybe 4 years ago. This definitely was something that I didn't know.
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447> **mic drop*
My argument is that DBZ is still the bigger anime in comparison to FMA and he even had *three* movies with a cult following to boot, that was so big it managed to bring a noncanon character into the canon Dragon ball universe. It wasn't even once, but *twice* in the form of Kale and Broly.

<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
clearly anti-pancake
you never said you did like pancakes tho
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
Loris doesn't
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
~~stacks of pancakes~~
But its prolly different
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I was always told to not eat gum tho
Ive never heard of Xanthan gum before today, interesting
To both
Thankies
huh
An anime about astronauts adapted from a video game
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
How do you make em
gluten-free?
I wish I knew what anime this was
Non canon
So are both of my answers good emough?
Ki sword as Vegito
What about the technique in the broly movie that he used to subdue broly while in god form?
What about solar flare?
Stolen would be like Cell or Kid buu
King Kai taught him
But ok
That no one else in the verse can do
Instant Kamehameha
Motherfucker had a pet phoenix at one point
They coulda easily brought him back
Roshi has a lot of years on earth and cool stuff
The mafuba technique
Remember the jar
Go on
But ok
Etc
Sealing Zamasu
ToP did it
And gave us a new angle that isn't aliens and maybe even have the human z fighters be relevant
They could've brought back magic
Dabura was cool though
Since that was part of the saiyaman stuff
I put that in with Gohan shenanigans
Pui Pui, Spovowhateves, all of them was a snoozefest
Too bad we get to see Videl almost die not too much time after
They could've condensed so much of the Buu arc
Hot take: Goku vs Vegeta rematch was bootycheeks
Everything else in between was boring
Only decent thing was ssj3 and fusion at least until super buu
Early buu saga Gohan shenanigans was fun
Looks like Shenhoujings light attack
Just another reason to stan Lexi
Bop
brain rot üòî
but nothing about the plot
I remember this opening clear as day
WTF
Shiiittt, they don't even know that there's a manga
You think these kids watched dragonball?
Hana

He definitely isn't winning any parent of the year awards though
I mean, even normal people have trouble with that one, much less an alien thats always busy fighting off crazy shit amd was raised by a single old man in the countryside
He's ok
Ehh
Goku only technique
Yep
https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/God_Bind
That looks like a new technique
Look at real life fighters that build success on techniques that are already there
I mean, you don't have to be an inventor to prove you are a great fighter
1:03
https://youtu.be/ImpjILd0sYg
What about this?
Wolf fang fist is scratches and thats still a technique
I'm pretty sure my point still stands
Thats dragon ball heroes
Bruh shallot

Until Vegito and Super
I see that list being xenoverse and movie villains
I don't think anyone used (canon wise) it until Vegito
Are you base form Amiya now?
Dw, it comes with the big fandom
<a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>
Dragonball fans vs Persona 5 fans vs Dark souls fans
<:KEK:745485222367330305>
Goblin Slayer is fun...bs aside
Where can I stream?
This looks enjoyable
Im most likely gonna wait till beastars is done to binge it
spider

AoT

I can record au marias voice real quick
if I should watch it
<a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>
The new anime got me *wondering*...
Ill check it out
Name?
Its like an, if i die i die mentality
Fear makes it easier for me.to sleep
Maybe you can get some sleep now
Well
But its really cute...so maybe Ill ignore that
||this show is a bad influence by showing that it's ok to have a lack of self control||
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
||everyone got food too, after just eating||
where is the justice at

<@!222517038042710017> which soundtrack do you prefer?
<:Serenapudding:767690785788657676>
this is why I just use Funi
lmao
I guess I'm just used to the JP soundtrack since the Spanish versions of Db/Dbz kept it
which just adds hype for me since it's fresh
JP makes it seem like just another episode, EN makes this feel like a movie
https://youtu.be/NsW8c9bgSu4
EN sends down the chills down the spine
But they don't hit the same
The JP versions are still great
Those songs was heat
Wack take

Anyone here ever watch the Boondocks? If y'all haven't it has my seal of approval
Kinda surprised they didn't go that route in the anime
Yep
oh
I thought that show was just ecchi, not adult?

<a:ablobblewobble:580595722798235648>
honorable mentions are Leonardo (2003), Tuxedo Mask and Wolverine

Ooooh
What movie?
Good night matt

U said it was an objective fact tho üôÑ
~~I know its subjective~~
But it aint young
Like it sounds high pitched
Imagine needing a super deep voice just to sound like an adult
Damn
https://youtu.be/E3hnRevzf24
https://youtu.be/BHQKa6McdcY
he doesnt sound like that against Cell tho
Thats early dbz
Yes
üôÑ
Its not like VAs can change up their style
wow
I don't hear it
which has an A D U L T Goku
but Shemmy brought up DBZ
<@84811738653929472> ofc dragonball goku sounds like a kid
So I can binge it
So I can binge it
Is ex arm finished?
They also had the original broly movie in theaters
but I was busy with work
I was supposed to watch it the first time around
yea
An interesting new anime
Finally
Wait whattt
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
blu rays are just blue dvds
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Imagine buying dvds
which was just an odd time for me
the always had the showings for thursday
I missed the cowboy bebop movie in theaters
this theater about 15 mins away streams old school anime movies every now and then
which was nice
Who?
send the invite link
then itll just catch on to the wider public
and convince everyone there
Why dont we just join the slime discord
~~I've been killing ~~ Slimes  ~~for~~ 300 ~~Year and Maxed out my Level~~

didn't finish Buffy but made it a good 4-5 seasons
I put it on my list after I finished Angel
By josh whedon?
üòÇ
Thats been on my list for years too
Bruhhhh
<:AquaDoubt:819998756703174748>
BRR?
it felt like a failed attempt to make the characters look cute
especially them big ass eyes
I agree with this so much
Zombieland cg made me drop the show
Instead id buy cookbooks Id never use
I used to do that
Naruto summary lol
He turned?
in that case
They mostly just wanted numbers quickly
Cus I remember that one person getting their blood sucked and then feeling better after it had stopped
They had it coming then
Suck blood without killing
I meant like
maybe it's because they are assholes
hmm
so they wouldn't die
I wonder why the vamps couldn't just change victims
Those kids didn't deserve to die
Let people just die
What are you gonna do
it's either them or us
To be fair
||and tortured his wife||
I sided with the doctor until he went off the rails
If so then ye
That the vampire show
You should write some Symphogear Ben 10 fanfics my guy
Agreed
masao guy was a huge dick tho
but thats about it
which seemed unrealistic
I remember them brushing off the city dreams
I don't quite remember them treating her like shit
Didn't see the issue people had with it
I didn't mind the ending
I watched it early last year
Yea
Like Millarc
ü•¥
Why not use blood bags then
huh
Wow
Who here really likes DBZ?
üòÇ fucking tony
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
All the gears have twintails in XDU
in nature type of story
and is more innocent
boys love has non lewd content like hand holding
Good üò§
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
both yuris are really cute
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
this is unfair üò†
That's like getting mad at Gohan from DBZ because he is named after rice, which is more widely known
Btw
Main characters name is yuri
not my fault you didn't read the summary
Words can mean more than one single thing
Oh wow
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Yuri on Ice was a masterpiece
The playboy channel is also on tv
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Bern is driving while using a phone
Not naisu <@199928870810419200>
nice emote there Bern
one of the more entertaining mangas I've read recently
<:xdd:815041848896520222>
They animated this shit now
but the whole shy thing gets a bit annoying at times
Her base design is cute
Shit was dumb
Idk
Sooo
But they also made Trunks hair blue
from the saiyan aura
it's probably just the lighting
plus he even has bigger boobs
when she is a carbon copy
It's just hard to like Kal3
plus his regular saiyan form is cuter than Kale anyway
I have OG Broly for Brolic
But I'd put Kefla at 5th
~~It's cus I'm a furry~~
I prolly like hop cus she reminds me of Wolverine
Sorrel is 4th
so actually third
Hop is 2nd best behind Vados
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Next ur gonna say u didn't read the manga

Not to mention stage presence
Ribrianne also has charisma tho
Monna?
And Ribrianne is from Super, not Z
But that's a game
Android 21
Literally the definition of thicc
Prove me wrong
<@195044406343106560> <@222517038042710017> <@152896851660505088> 2nd form Ribrianne is the best waifu in DBS
Fax
That afro was terrible
Yikes
Super Bulma is the best version of her
Bulma was never really hot for me
I liked when she talked shit to Goku
Caulifla has entertaining exchanges
and maybe Cabba
I think it woulda been better to have her at least open up around Caulifa
<:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>

They also use the Canadian op in the UK
I find Rock the dragon more or of a hype song
I find it catchy
Y'all ever heard the Canadian opening

Give him earrings
~~Also if that's still an issue just have him absorb Tien~~
They wouldn't let the kids in because they'd be inexperienced but with Buu who is like who knows how old, that wouldn't be an issue

What if Buutenks was in the ToP??
Majin Buu with Sentience pretty much. He would replace Tien <@152896851660505088> <@195044406343106560> <@222517038042710017>
I'm on that Hopium
~~maybe~~
<:MikuPanic:640289659452129310>
Is what I'm tryna say
Goku could be in blue but if his power is being suppressed to like Android Saga SSJ, I wouldn't call it wank
Because those level characters never went serious
But not to that level
He did wank em
Android 17? Sure
Gohan? Ye
Krillin? :cap:
Keeping up w God level chars
üíÄ
Everyone they fought was weak
He's a master martial artist at this point with complete control over his body and strength
He can still suppress his power tho
but that was just to prepare him and I'm pretty sure he still held back tons
Ye Goku went Blue against Krillin
They don't
