That commission may be for "Little_Moist", but both Miku and Chris there are looking VERY moist to me...

We've gotten short hair 'Basa.
All that is known is that Chris and Basa are criminals. The other differences are all speculative.

Shirabe? Maybe?
And I think Prelati is Scarecrow?
Looks like Harley Quinn.
My secondary question: who is Hibiki supposed to be?
My main question: whose the Joker?
Yep.
She does look good in that suit tho, I'll give her that.
Riddler Kirika? She's neither self-absorbed nor intelligent enough for that.
<:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
Because if she had been alterChris, the whole fan base would have swiftly come down with diabetes before the end of S1.
This was why Chris was made a tsundere in the series.
So, guessing purely based off of context clues, Miku got jelly of Tsubasa and is suggesting to Chris they do the same to bring Bikky back around to her OTL by making Bikky jelly of Chris?
The thing is, I bet it was "accidentally". Which is why she is getting punished. The real question is whether it's Chris or Miku doing the punishing.

Well, yes. But after that comes rice and rice.

I know what I saw.
Ah, you deleted it.
I observed that being yandere *and* possessive is a redundancy.
You said that Miku walks a line between attached, yandere, and possessive.
Therefore redundancy.

Yes. True.
Because, like Miku, AlterChris is cute and fluffy... but also has a hidden core of steel.
I feel it more like AlterBasa is Bikki while AlterChris is Miku.
Prime Chris is standing off to the side, her own mouth open to deliver the same line, but now is staring at Edgebikki in total shock.

There’s alway fics.
And some of the OVAs I believe too.
There was one or two *brief* bits in XV.
Yet Tsubasa is looking at Bikky and Chris is looking at Miku.
The interesting thing there is how it’s S1 art and symbolizes the S1 relationships pretty well. Hibiki and Miku are facing away from each other yet still linked in hands and both are looking at the viewer in unison with each other.
Chris looks so happy to be finally able to have a sleepover with other people.
Could you link to the rest?
Kerrik, is that first image the start of a series?
The bunny will probably be used to beat Hibiki over the head.
And Tsubasa will just smile and pull her in closer for a hug.
And Chris will just pout and go “nothing, shut up.”
And Tsubasa is all like “what brought this on?”
Regardless, Chris will suddenly just collapse into lean on her.
That too.
And Tsubasa will be “sure, anytime Bae”.
Now maybe afterwards she’ll go call Tsubasa and go “hey, can I come over?”
Not at the moment in that image she doesn’t.
Being Chris is suffering.

Miku: “Let’s see...”
Hibiki: “Ahahaha! It tickles! Quit it!”

Miku: “Oh wow. It’s true.”
The only one of the Chris-eating pictures posted that I can even see as kinda shippy is the one with DMJii with Shirabe wiping at Chris’s face. All the rest are either her solo or don’t code as very romantic to me.
Hm... any good Chris-eating pics where she's eating with someone in a shippy sorta way?
What are they saying?
Seems friendly enough...
Is that... Shem-Miku and Shem-Bikky on a date after apocalypsing the planet?

Nope.

~~Which I am totally stealing for a later chapter in Distortions.~~
The event also introduced a Hibimiku Unison Attack.
Tikki gets involved in an antagonistic role somehow, but I'm not clear on the details.
From what I've heard second-hand, Hibiki and Miku are cast as the Prince and Princess in a cinderella-esque play. Much gay between the two promptly ensues.
The event title was "Unmei no Aite", which apparently translates as "Soulmates" (although maybe one of our professional moonspeakers can vouch for this).
Also, <@!160142617940590594>, here's a memoria from XDU-JP in November. which features Hibiki in a tux (or at least some kinda suit).

Why they such precious gaybabies?
Also, “The Moon is really beautiful tonight” is supposed to be an indirect way of saying “I love you” in Japanese.
“Tsukuyomi (月読, Tsukuyomi?) - Means "Moon Reading". It is also short for the name of the Shinto moon god, Tsukuyomi no Mikoto.”
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436> <:KirikaWink:689564310908960900>
The triple-meaning. Perfect.
A photo of her girl (although anyone know what Kirika says there?).

But basa can't aim
I like how Kirika's version of Ichaival has a tiny little bayonet on her revolver.
Also, the whole "zombie" thing is definitely a form of alchemy.
The more idol-oriented Zombus are over the moon when they get the (official) backstory on 'Basa and Maria.
They run into Franchouchou...
The Geah's are sent down to Kyushu to investigate some supernatural oddities.
Also, crossover fic when?
Zenbu and Zombu.

Anyways, the reason I was originally here...
But I've always taken Astolfo as just a crossdressing, androgynous looking man rather then a transgender individual.
Hm... that's a good point. I only know of a grand total of two animes which have handled transgenderism with an appropriate sensitivity.
Right, then there's no need to spoil.
Wait, does Alfotso identify as male or female?

Because clearly Shirabe at the bottom of the first image is giving the love-eyes to Kirika at the bottom of the second one.
They also compliment each other.

Oh wow, I just noticed they are Disney princesses.
Miku with purple hair was different enough that it took me a moment to realize it was her.

Kirichan still works as hard as ever, but I suspect her loss will affect her too one day.
Sadly, yes. Without Sakimori to maintain her, she has started to pass.

This is actually the artists birthday, but one can easily interpret it as also celebrating Chris’s B-Day in XV.
Also, it has a smug, happy looking Chris (albeit in that tsundere fashion of hers), which is also always good.

Tsubasa looks so *bored*.
In fact, an even better question is how they're supposed to cram Kanade into *ten* panels.
Only way I can see that working out is if they include Elfnein.
Wait, how are they gonna cram carol into... nine panels?
Hibiki: *outraged* "MIKU?! CHRIS-CHAN?!"
Chris: "Uh... oh god, dumbass, this isn't what it looks like!"

Well, given the sci-fi aesthetic, it could be an energy blade or have a retracted monomolecular edge.

Then Chris probably walks in and goes “What in the-!”
Maybe translating the text will unveil some clues. But probably just because they’re derps.
I think Shirabe joined her under there for some reason.

Yeah, Axia's pretty great. But they have a pretty big hate-on for Maria which is a bit of a let down (I understand if they don't ship it, but hating her just for Maribasa strikes me as uncool). That said, it's pretty ignorable. I'm looking forward to this.

The question is whether she's the biological child of all three or if Maria's only a nursing parent (is that the term?).
Orange wing plus sword (& Maria).
First one is Hibiki and Miku's. The second one is Kanade and Tsubasa (and Maria).
Apparently fanchildren.
(Chris is obviously needy, but refuses to show it)
But do you think Hibiki's more needy with Miku or Miku's more needy with Hibiki?
Hmm... I bet *both* of DMJii are pretty needy.
Man, Tsubasa's a *needy* gay mess.
If she’s a gamer, she probably already does.

She might not use "dess".
She seems more subdued then OG Kirika. So probably she's someone whose more serious and focused.
True enough, I guess.

Miku probably has a much smaller band size then ‘Basa, which would give her the larger cup size. It might be the same with Maria vs Chris, although that’s less clear from the line up.

Oh? What are the Japanese shipnames like?
Add that to the shipname list for Marichris.
There was a little streak on my computer screen that was positioned *just* perfectly enough to make it look like Chris was drooling when this image popped up.
If we're lucky, she'll upload an online copy.
This is true.
True. And just because you might get a digital copy doesn't mean *it* is a translated version.
When I said a online copy, digital is what I meant. Such doujins *are* becoming increasingly a thing and are sometimes sold on certain sites like fantia or the pixiv fanbox.
Is there any art of Chris just getting pampered?

She's sorta got her hands clasped behind her back and the way her shirt is colored make them seem like their just the sides of her torso.

Yeah. The manga has different characterizations and plot threads and such.
Love Live's like that a lot.
According to my headcanon, Mari's "dad" is simply the one who didn't carry her. My logic is flawless.

How it should’ve ended...

I remember thinking that Shirabe's a giddy drunk for some reason. And Kirika's a suave/flirty drunk.
Would Maria be a giddy drunk?

Funny thing is, we know from the OVAs that Chris would be bawling her eyes out right alongside Tsubasa.

Where'd you get that translation?
I'd be concerned about what they're writing in, but I'm pretty sure the book might be too confused by everything they are scrawling to do anything.

So this is actually the first in a series of commissions I've mentally titled "Giant Geahs, in their Gears, enraged and on a rampage." The artist working on Kanade got back to me first. I've already got Chris, Kirika, and Tsubasa works in the works and I've ID'd good artists for Shirabe and Hibiki, but haven't approached them yet. If anyone has good artist recs for the Maria, Serena, or Miku... drop me a line.

Not exactly? It would be a Chris still dealing with much closer to canon-'Basa than AU-'Basa and she'd get to know Kanade possibly for at least awhile...

The basic summary is: the Zababies were huge for some reason. Chris responded first and got picked up. Hibiki responded second with something devised by Elfnein to shrink them back down. As you can see from that pic, it overcompensated.

The Japanese communist party probably has largely managed to squeak by through virtue of being more a mix of classical Marxists/Neo-Marxists and Social Democrats rather then any strand of Leninists.
Nah, not just anime themes. They remix pretty much anything.
It was Miku and Gen who they pushed in a direction I didn't like. And the Stroganoff trio, while okay, I felt represented a lost opportunity.
I figure Discordgear did some things great for the characters. Like, Chris and Tsubasa were pretty much on the ball for me. Hibiki herself was pretty good.

Yeah, I was under the impression we were musing on the phenomenon and its permutations as a whole rather then a specific instance.
The key is to make the joke about the situation rather then about the person.
That is true. That's something my parent's don't do. They may make the occasional joke, but they don't harp on it.
And their relationship is pretty okay.
My Mom and Dad, for example, make plenty of cracks to each other (and me) about how being married is a constant state of misunderstanding each other.
It seems to me, the sign of a healthy relationship is if you can make those sort of jokes with your significant other as well as your acquaintances.

What about medical-visitation rights and spousal decision making if one half is incapacitated and the like?
Actually, even while typing this it occurred to me that the latter can be done via legal means regardless. You can go up to a lawyer and go "in the event I'm put into a coma, this person is my legal representative" and draft a legal document to that effect. Less sure about medical-visitation rights though.

That’s the flip side to it. Someone has described most of the Trump Administrations actions as “Malice Tempered by Incompetence”.
But given the Republican Judges, two of whom are Trump appointees... well, Roberts isn’t a *complete* ass so maybe he’ll be persuaded that it’s unconstitutional under the 1st Amendment (which it pretty blatantly is).
That’s probably why we’re going to see a Supreme Court case on this.
Well... this can go one of several ways.
Yeah, I think it should be retained, even if it gets appropriated by hypocritical corporations to try and play the PR game. Because awareness is more important then that.

Wow. A real promotion. Used to be they were supposed to be patsies for the communists in paranoid-right-wing-land.
It could be a bit of an inversion. Like, Trump suddenly went “Oh, hey, it’s pride month and my base hate the gays and the ||trannies||. Why not suck up to them a bit and try to own the libs.” God knows, he does so much else pretty much on sudden reflex.
The philosophical roots of the two are radically different, despite certain similarities.

> I'm worried that I've ruined my brain because I don't have any urge to have sex
Not having any urge to have sex isn't any indication you ruined your brain. It's just an indication that sex isn't enough much a priority for you. I'm pretty much in the same boat: I'm satisfied with just the occasional rosy palms date, without any urge to actually go out and find a partner. Nothing wrong with that.

<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
Mr Rogers.
That said, there is one guy I'd probably glorify.
Which is what conservatives like to do with Churchill, hence that quiz.
Eh, it's just as easy to paint someone who at some point made noises in support of your position/goals as a hero.
Yeah, that's all true.
Oh, wow. Yeah, we had the same thought at the same time.
But then, not everyone has the time or energy to devote themselves to reading thoughtful analysis.
Because when you actually look closely at what these guys were actually doing, saying, thinking... it all becomes too much of a *muddle* for it to really work as glorification.
Well, I find that honestly and objectively studying their place in history does a good deal to disperse a lot of glorification.
Ah, yes. The creation of the myth after that man. I get what your saying.
But I have serious doubts from my studies that it would have gone on to start WW2 without Hitler.
Like, I can be reasonably sure that Germany in the 1930s would have still wound up a right-wing authoritarian dictatorship without Hitler.
Great Man Theory isn't something I'm a fan of either, but by the same token to deny that the decisions leaders make *don't* matter either strikes me as equally denying of individual agency.
But while I regard Churchill as a deeply flawed and morally tainted figure, I do hesitate to classify him as a "human monster" like I would someone like Hitler or Stalin.
It rarely is.
*shrug*. Well, I underwent my education as a history teacher from a historians perspective, so presentism isn't something I like to indulge in. Even shitty people are complex figures that I am very rarely like to simplify down to such things as "hero or villain" like that quiz does.
Quite frequently, yes.
Anyway, my view on Churchill is that he had a very romantic outlook on life that could lead him down strange paths and dark roads, but which also proved indispensable at compelling Britain to keep on fighting through WW2. His record as a strategist was mediocre at best, but fortunately he had a solid General Staff that he knew to listen too serving under him which ameliorated many of the consequences of this. His attitudes on things like race, gender, imperialism, and so-on are of course utterly abhorrent by today's standards and he is responsible for criminal negligence on a number of counts for stuff like the Bengal Famine. But in the context of British society of the 30's and 40's, he rests very much within the overtone windows of the time.
It wasn't until the early-50s that the US had not just the number and quality of bombs, but also the aircraft, crews, and support infrastructure to effectively execute atomic strikes against the USSR.
In fact, having done extensive research on the late-1940s US nuclear arsenal, it's short-term potential was more of a bluff then a functional system of war
There's also the issue that none of the infrastructure for the storage, assembly, and basing of 1st Gen atomic weapons had been set-up in Europe or the MidEast.
[snip stuff on some other agreements]
So all that happened at Yalta was that a rubber stamp was put on a lot of ugly, ugly things which should have been bound to happen for at least 2 or 3 years because of the way that the West had planned its strategy through the 2nd World War.
[/quote]
No British or American government could have survived that, because the other thing one has to remember is the colossal popular enthusiasm for Russia especially in Britain. British people are saying that they thought Russia was absolutely wonderful. Reading people’s diaries from that period it is absolutely extraordinary, the euphoric expressions of enthusiasm for Uncle Joe Stalin and what he was doing. The man whose armies had killed 2 or 3 million - the heroic Soviet people. And all the time there was a rage towards their own government for not getting into the war more. So any notion that the British public or the American one would have supported Churchill or Roosevelt in “standing up to the Russians,” it was just never on. And yes it’s true that things were made explicit at Yalta, which looked pretty ugly, but the nature of the Yalta decisions was settled in advanced.
Churchill was also naïve. Churchill worked himself up into an almost emotional fever in his distress about, especially, the sacrifice of Poland and, especially, the fact that Polish freedom, for which Britain had gone into the Second World War, was to be sacrificed to the Russians. But Churchill refused to recognise the logic of his own position, that if the western Allies had been serious about wanting to see that eastern Europe was free, they would have had to have got into the war on a very big scale and they would have had to have had D Day in 1943. If they then fought like tigers and accepted casualties many times the scale of those that they did, then they might, they might, have been able to save eastern Europe and Poland from the Russians, though even then it’s pretty doubtful. But what would have happened if Roosevelt and Churchill had gone to their own electorates and said we are actually going to launch a major campaign on the continent which is going to cost hundreds of thousands of extra lives, not in order to accelerate the defeat of Hitler, but in order to make sure that all these poor Polish and Romanian and Czech and Hungarian peoples don’t fall prey to the wicked Russians?
To quote one historian on the matter...
As morally odious as they may have been, a lot of the concessions the WAllies, not just Churchill mind you, made to the Soviets were the product of them having to deal with some rather harsh military realities.
The nearest WAllied forces were hitting logistical culminating points on the Western Frontiers of Germany or engaged in grueling mountain battles in Italy.
What? You mean the percentages agreement? By then, the Red Army had rolled over Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, half of Poland, was driving on the Hungarian capitol, and was preparing to advance across the rest of Poland into Germany itself.
> Given that he sold out Eastern Europe to the Soviets
Eh... I mean, with a massive, battle hardened, mechanized Red Army that had more then two corps for every division in the Anglo-American army already in control of Eastern Europe... there really wasn’t much he could realistically do?
So basically reddit banned both a meaningless left-wing and meaningless right-wing sub? Go figure.

Yeah. That sounds pretty typical. So is it a law thing then?
At least when it comes to tax money stuff. Although are there provincial taxes in Poland like there are local and state taxes here?
But... wait. That basically means they are shooting themselves in the foot.
Oh. So they *hate* the money making center?
I mean, that’s usually the motive for that kinda thing here in the US.
Ah. So they want to yank the moneymaking center into it’s own thing and fuck all the rest whose service budgets will have to suffer?
I mean, history is replete with examples where some bastard overextends themselves from what could have been a stable position. It's *also* filled with bastards who only set modest goals and played their powergames conservatively, seeking to operate within the confines of the system rather then overturning it. The former tend to achieve more spectacular results before they crash-and-burn, while the latter tend not to crash-and-burn at all.
> The point of calculated greed is precisely to not piss people off enough to screw you over
Pretty much. Knowing when to stop and consolidate is a skill. Sometimes maintaining the current rate of screwery is a lot more beneficial then increasing it while also being more stable.
Unhindered greed, yes. Greed tempered by calculation can have a lot more longevity behind it.
It actually seems like the deal was going pretty smoothly until Sigismund turned it around, so yeah... major misstep on his part.
```In January 1612, part of the Polish army mutinied because of unpaid wages and retreated from Russia towards the Commonwealth. The Second Volunteer Army joined the other anti-Polish Russian forces in Moscow, besieging the Polish garrison remaining in the Kremlin. Well-armed and organised, the Second Volunteer Army took Yaroslavl in March 1612 and set up a Russian provisional government supported by a number of cities. Minin and Pozharsky entered Moscow in August 1612 when they learned that a 9,000-strong Polish army under hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz was on the way to lift the siege. On 1 September, the Battle of Moscow began; Chodkiewicz's forces reached the city, using cavalry attacks in the open and new tactics such as a mobile tabor fort. After early successes, Chodkiewicz's forces were driven from Moscow by Russian-aligned Don Cossack reinforcements. On 3 September, he launched another attack which reached the walls of the Kremlin; Moscow's narrow streets halted the movement of his troops, however, and he ordered a retreat after a Russian counter-attack.[11][12] On 22 September 1612, the Poles and Lithuanians exterminated the population of Vologda; many other cities were also devastated or weakened.[11] Although the Russian victory in the Battle of Moscow secured the city, the Polish garrison in the Kremlin remained until it ran out of supplies and capitulated on 7 November; news of the capitulation reached Sigismund at Volokolamsk, less than 30 kilometres (19 mi) away, the following day. Sigismund, on his way to assist the garrison, stopped and returned to Poland.```
```Popular discontent had increased by early 1611, and many sought to end the Polish occupation. Polish and German mercenaries suppressed riots in Moscow from 17 to 19 March 1611, massacring 7,000 people and setting the city on fire.[11] Although the Polish garrison in the Kremlin was besieged by the First Volunteer Army, led by Ryazan governor Prokopy Lyapunov, the poorly-armed militia failed to take the fortress. The volunteers fell into disarray, and Cossack leader Ivan Zarutsky murdered Lyapunov. Kuzma Minin, a merchant from Nizhny Novgorod, used funds donated by the city's merchants' guild to form the Second Volunteer Army (Russian: Второе народное ополчение) to oppose the Polish garrison. Minin recruited Prince Dmitry Pozharsky, a high-ranking boyar close to the Russian throne, to lead the army.```
And then:
This is what wikipedia has to say about the issue:
```Shuysky was forced to abdicate by the Seven Boyars after the Battle of Klushino. Before False Dmitri II could gain the throne, Polish commander Stanisław Żółkiewski put forward a rival candidate: Sigismund's son, Prince Władysław, who was popular with pro-Polish Russian boyars. Some people in Moscow swore allegiance to him if he maintained Russian Orthodoxy and granted them privileges. They allowed Polish troops to enter the city and occupy the Kremlin, and the Seven Boyars accepted Władysław as tsar of Russia in September 1610. False Dmitry II was abandoned by most of his Polish supporters, and his campaign ended when he was killed on 11 December 1610.

Władysław's reign was interrupted when Sigismund opposed the compromise, deciding to seize the throne and convert Russia to Roman Catholicism. This aroused anti-Catholic and anti-Polish sentiment in Russia and infuriated the pro-Polish boyars who supported him. Sweden strongly disapproved of the move (fighting the Polish–Swedish wars on the Baltic coast, ending their military alliance and beginning the Ingrian War. The Swedes supported their False Dmitry III in Ivangorod. By this time, Russia was a failed state; the throne was vacant, the nobility quarreled among themselves, the Orthodox Patriarch Hermogenes was imprisoned, Catholic Poles occupied the Kremlin, Smolensk was still besieged, and Protestant Swedes occupied Novgorod. Tens of thousands died in battles and riots as bands of brigands swarmed, and Tatar raids depopulated and devastated Russia's southern borderlands.```
The Polish garrison defending Moscow surrendered several days before the relief force could arrive. That's what prompted Sigismund to turn his force around.
Not to mention, the Russians had Moscow back. Sure, maybe the Polish relief force could have taken it back off them again... *maybe*. Or it might have beaten it's head in on the defences. That's a unknown. But without the heart of Russia, any attempt by any Pole to proclaim themselves Tsar would have been pretty hollow.
It neighbored Poland though. And a Personal Union between Poland and Russia likely would not have gone over well.
You'd have to read the fic to understand. Any more conversation should go to <#357682999300718592> though. We've probably already clogged serious-discussion a bit much.
Currently, though, most of the attention is on East Asia.
Not a main focus. But *a* focus, to a degree.
The problem is that a good chunk of that power vacuum was filled in by the Russians. So there's a continent wide Cold War between an Franco-German alliance and the Russians.
Yeah. By the time the fanfic I'm writing is taking place, Europe's been clubbing itself back together after the power vacuum the Illuminati left there.
OH!
It was in the keywords.
Found out what?
Which, because of the Illuminatis just-before-AXZ shenanigans, is under de-facto Russian occupation. *Again*.
But there is a future arc that takes place in Poland.
Not the *next* chapter, no.
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Shockingly, that tends to result in stuff happening.
That tends to happen, yeah. The accumulated effects of untold numbers of choices by huge numbers of people across a few dozen countries over the course of decades...
Yeah, history since the 17th Century hasn't been kind to Poland. Sorry man.
The part where it never actually managed to come into existence, whereas the Deluge did?
I mean, I can see it being used as a fair bit of evidence that, for the Swedes, that it removed a relatively friendly bulwark against the growing Russian Empire, but then the contest between Sweden and Russia over the Baltics would last for a few more decades yet.
... So how does it then serve as a counterpoint that the Deluge was good for the Russians and Swedes even as it was bad for Poland?
I mean, it helped that the Russians managed to recapture Moscow for a bit and had a hard time accepting a foreigner as Tsar.
But this is all *before* the Deluge?
Wait, you mean during the Time of Troubles?
Or was that just another term for the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth?
I'll admit, that's a piece of history I'm not familiar with. Clarify?
I mean if you're Polish (which, yes, okay, you are), sure. I'm sure the Russians and Swedes had very different opinions.
> Don't even get me started on suffering adverse effects from historical hard shifts
The Deluge wasn't very nice, was it?
Really? I mean, to use your own country as an example Rady, Poland's suffered it's own adverse effects from historical hard shifts. WW2 was a "hardshift event" that finalized the destruction of the Eurocentric world order that had dominated since at least the Napoleonic Wars, and Poland didn't fare very well from it or it's aftermath.
So... uh, pick your revolution *very* carefully. A wrong choice could see you be consumed by it, even assuming you win.
What makes me leery of many hardshift proposals is that historically hardshifts can very easily spin out of control and result in unforeseen negative consequences. That said, trying to keep a business as usual attitude is quite clearly also not working and as the theory of the system only diverges further from reality, it's going to result in an involuntary hardshift eventually when all the nasty second-order effects start kicking in.
Or it devolves into screaming...
Welcome to late-stage capitalism.

Primary them.
What a difference seventy-five years make.
Nukes distribute their energy a bit more efficiently, but yeah.
The US in the 50’s even planned for the post office to keep running in the aftermath of a nuclear war with the Soviets.
Well, I'd certainly hate to love the PRC.
> I don't know if we could run a fully post-scarcity society but we could absolutely run a society where everyone's needs are met, even if not everything is as abundant as we'd like.
Now *that*, that I can buy.
Yeah, no. I don't accept the premise that the US has the resources to manage post-scarcity economy. I agree that it certainly could manage to be far more fair and just than the current system and that the current neo-liberal capitalist dynamic dominant in government is responsible for much of the injustice and inequality certainly seems correct, but the claim that it could manage outright post-scarcity strikes me as far more of a reach. Plus, US involvement in various wars is as much about preventing the rise of real challengers to US dominance who may realistically threaten the US domestic resource base through means other than nuclear destruction (which is a threat that can be deterred by the US's own nuclear arsenal).
Which can matter quite a bit.
Or changes which subjugator does the extracting.
This is true. Yet it is also not the whole story.
The struggle for power encompasses the international as well as the national level.
You don't think that also doesn't apply to the conflicts between nations?
Which is unfortunate, because those three variants basically encompasses the entirety of the history of international politics, whether at the regional or global level.
I'mma be frank: neither unipolar, bipolar, or multipolar international systems actually have that great a record on the "peace, justice, and kindness among all mankind" front.
Well, it'd be a start?
And if you go back to the 19th century, Britain’s global empire gave her military global reach.
Yeah. You’re actually starting to see Chinese bases popping up in places like Africa and the South Pacific now that their military capacity is beginning to reach that point.
Gotta keep the Reds from taking over Eurasia. Because if they did that, then it’ll only be a matter of time before they’re subsuming the CONUS. And if we get driven off the Continental Eurasia, gotta maintain those foreward island bases to nuke them into goo.
> That’s so fucked
*shrug*
Functionally speaking, the modern US base infrastructure was established either during WW2 or in the first half of the Cold War.
You need to “protect your interests” with military force? You need a nearby base for your aircraft and ships to operate out of and for your ground forces to be supplied from.
> Why does the US have so many bases around the world?
Power projection.
But scarcity exists as long as any human cannot have all its *wants* met. If not everyone who wants the house on that hill, Jimi Hendrix's bandana, or the front row seats at a concert can have them, then there is in fact still scarcity.
Yeah, being able to meet everyone's needs and give them the adequate basis to pursue self-actualization is certainly there.

That’s not exactly something we can establish with certainty.
Sure, dogs aren’t as intelligent as us, but whether they are *un*intelligent to understand that...
We don’t know whether it is a function of intelligence or just communication.
Like I would a human being.
I’d respect it’s wishes.
No way to establish that without doubt.
We don’t know for sure whether they want us to end it or whether they want to keep struggling onto life.

The Block-2's description on interception capabilities against MARVs also still leaves it unknown how well it would work against the new generation of hypersonic glide warheads.
To be specific:
"Aster 30 Block 1NT (New Technology) - wide area defence capable against 1500 km-range ballistic missiles[10]
Aster 30 Block 2 BMD currently being developed for anti-ballistic defense against 3000 km-range maneuvering missiles."
For reference, these are IRBM ranges. ICBMs are 5,500 kilometer+.
Aster-30 tops out at IRBMs.
ICBM-warheads are outside their interception envelope.
The SM-series tops out at IRBMs.
While the American system only protects the western hemisphere.
The Russian system only defends Moscow.
They are also rather positional.
And there's doubts whether it could handle North Korea's relatively ragged arsenal, let alone a sophisticated modern system with penetration aides, as is the case with China.
There is, as it is now, precisely two missile systems rated to intercept ICBMs.
No, no we do not.
Yeah.
Thermonuclear civil war (with plenty of potential for spill-over)... not so much.
I dunno. "Great Power dickery" is something humanities has had millenia of years of experience with.
If only because anarchy in a country with 3-400 nuclear warheads could mean VERY BAD THINGS.
I also wouldn't be particularly enthusiastic about a Chinese collapse scenario.
Even the bloody universe is destined to end.
I mean, my perspective is: EVERYTHING ends.
2006, 2011, 2012, 2016, and 2017.
This one guy, Gordon Chang, he predicted that China would collapse in...
I mean, there have been "experts" predicting that China would implode in a couple of years for decades.
*Solid* predictions about the future are a total crapshoot in my experience.
Maybe China goes onto become the dominant superpower, maybe it implodes a month from now.
The US could last for another 200 years, it could utterly implode tomorrow (which would be very unpleasant for me).
I don't take anything as a given.
The EU offers some prospect of a potentially powerful alliance bloc all onto itself, but then you take a look at all the infighting and... yeah.
Europe these days is kinda it's own deal.
Although it is worse, don't get me wrong.
Quite. But I don't see it as being *considerably* worse then the US's behavior as a "neo-liberal/conservative" democratic great power.
Yeah, China's behavior is fundamentally that of an authoritarian great power.
They're currently installing the ability to manufacture weapons-grade material and components at a rate of 2,000 warheads a year.
Also, do keep in mind: that 3-400 number is China's current arsenal.
And, of course, any ICBM worth its salt will be loaded with penetration decoys.

He's... not wrong. There's a large section of American Christian Evangelicals that are DEEP down the Dispensational Premillenialist rabbit hole. This groups basically a doomsday cult and Israel having it's capitol in Jerusalem is one of the requirements for The Prophecy(TM).
Regardless, the historical HoD is more a lesson on how the optics of war can be awfully distorting than it is any kind of morality tale. ***Far*** more people were dying in the massive armored clash that was going on at Objective Norfolk at the same time, which tore the guts out of half a dozen of Iraq's best divisions. But those bodies and burnt out vehicles were strung out over numerous desert tracks, which doesn’t lend itself as well to panoramic photos of destruction.
That being said, the US air forces would have had no way of picking out civies in the vehicles from the Iraqis. Particularly since Iraqis soldiers were using a lot of looted civie vehicles in their retreat. If any civies were intermingled amongst the retreating columns, the US Air Forces pounding it would have had no way of IDing which columns had civies. Regrettable and tragic, but not an act of malevolence on the USAFs part.
Hm... this is the first I’ve heard about that, but if civies died, the numbers were probably pretty small. Not a lot of actual Iraqis soldiers died on the road either.
Generally, civilians can have a very rosy view of how war is fought.
Killing *surrendering* soldiers is another matter. But retreating forces? They’re fair game. The Iraqis forces withdrawing up the HoD were falling back to a new defensive line under orders from the Iraqis High Command. Many of the forces would subsequently participate in the brutal suppression of the post-war Shi’ite and Kurdish Uprisings.
But none forbid the attacking of retreating forces. Even today, We killed retreating insurgents in Afghanistan all the time. I’ve chatted with NATO officers fact the whose first experience in a bombing run was by a B-1B against a group of Taliban desperately fleeing advancing ISAF troops (although they didn't kill them that time, because the Bone missed completely).
No, there were several conventions prior to WW2.
When German forces retreated from France in 1944, WAllied TacAir showed no hesitation in bombing and strafing their retreating columns.
Yes.
The historical Highway of Death was conducted against a legitimate military target, that is retreating columns of Iraqi soldiers, not against civilians.
Actually, the Higheway of Death depicted in Call of Duty, from what I heard, was much worse than the historical Highway of Death.
As a military nerd, the whole “Highway of Death” thing is particularly baffling to me, because the historical Highway of Death honestly looked a lot worse than it was.
*reading back over last nights convo*
Holy shit, we have someone who believes Cultural Marxism is an actual thing?
Quite. What the US needs is reform to both improve and better democratize the federal government while also strengthening that governments power over the states.
One of the big reasons the former Soviet countries crashed so hard in the 1990s was because what was once one economy suddenly became sixteen different ones and this royally messed up supply chains from administrative chaos. This wasn't the *only* reason, mind you, but it was a factor.
Mmm. Yeah, that's a good point.
So, regardless, it's pretty clear that the CCP isn't dynastic in nature and parental influence is no more of a factor then it is in most other major countries political make-up.
The Central Secretariat of the Communist Party and the chief engineer of China's current foreign policy, Wang Huning, on the other hand, is a completely self-made man. No parental influence at all, some patronage from friends but no more than found in any other bureaucratic state system, and largely worked his way to his position by merit and politicking...
A legitimately self-made man who deliberately distanced himself from his father's influence to start at the bottom and work his way to the top.
Xi himself is actually an odd example, because he's what Trump claims to be.
But there are also a lot of people who rose through the ranks through legitimate meritocractic methods.
There *are* people within it who earned their position mainly because their dad was also a high-ranking person in the CCP.
But frankly, the CCP is above all a ruling body, not a dynasty.
I've heard the CCP described as a "Dynasty with a unique style of succession".
*All over* the fucking place.
Yeah. It's utterly reprehensible, but Xi's pretty clearly knows what he wants and is acting reasonably effectively to get it. The leadership over here is just...
Those who make peaceful revolutions impossible make violent ones inevitable.
Eh, deformation isn’t abnormal during high rainwater periods. The dam deformed last year too at the peak of the rainy season but didn’t collapse. Engineers keep this sort of stuff in mind and there’s built-in redundancy and tolerances on this. What’s the degree of deformation?
Same goes for Guam and any other US territory.
I mean, if you move in from Puerto Rico, you can vote.
If you move out to Puerto Rico, OTOH, you can't.

Eh... given that a Great Depression-esque economic collapse is liable to result in violent ideological extremist governments being brought into power by promoting the ideal of reachieving economic prosperity via expansion or eradication of a scapegoat (which is basically what happened with the actual Great Depression in Europe and Asia), then it's liable to be first one, then the other.

It might not be necessarily racist, just insensitive. But it sadly probably is.
Most Buddhist conceptions of karma I've seen *does* appeal to cause-and-effect more so than most Hindu conceptions.
Depends on what conception of karma you are working with.
That said, there is stuff he can do to make life more difficult by shifting resources away from enforcement of the rulings and other such shenanigans.
So even a proper Pence presidency (rather than a powerless lame-duck before he gets replaced) is very unlikely to result in him undoing it all.
Well, the *only* way to overturn the 2015 ruling on same-sex marriage would be a constitutional amendment.
What, with a Supreme Court ruling that declares prohibition of same-sex marriage is unconstitutional.
And Pence... well, it'll be a bitch for him to do so.
Wha-No, Biden isn't going to undo gay marriage.
That'll depend on how the congressional elections break.
There are some things, though, that will require a lot more than just himself.
Eh... odds are good that he'll undo everything he *can* undo.
And Biden... well, he's painfully center-rightish, but a fascist or theocrat he ain't.
But there are rather decent odds that he'll wind-up either coming down with the virus himself or just being a seat warmer for Biden.
And yes, he might wind-up actually in charge.
Oh, don't get me wrong... Pence is a theocratic scumbag.
That'll make Pence a total lame duck.
Well, here's hoping that the votes break the right way come November 4th.
So much for that hope.
Aw, dammit. I just checked. Pence has tested negative.
And Pelosi... eh, there's undoubtedly better out there. But fuck me if she doesn't hate the current GOPs guts.
Well, that depends. If Pence catches it too, then he might also be incapacitated or killed too, thereby invoking the 25th amendment. In which case the next one in the chain of succession is... Nancy Pelosi.
Of course, I only wished this happened *after* the elections. Having it happen over a month beforehand represents too much possibility for them garnering some sympathy from the catastrophe from more simple-minded centrists.
But they aren't guaranteed to win those campaigns and the Republican Party already faces a very difficult future in the longer-term.
I mean, it won't kill the party for good: the upper-middle ranks would take over and organize the campaigns in the subsequent emergency elections.
That's a good question.
Really? My reactions more hopeful. I really do hope most of the GOP leadership succumbs to this. The parties 99% of the way into becoming a fascist vanguard party. They frankly *deserve* it.

Who is Josh?

Yeah... that sounds about right. He’s massively obsessed with image after all.
... Given the level of intelligence and insight he’s been reported to have in briefings, the evidence indicates that he is, at the very least, not the brightest bulb in the closet.
Far more likely is they'd use some paramilitary or military-adjacent organization (like the national guard).
But I recall back in May and June, when Trump and some other of his bootlickers were suggesting using the regular armed forces to police the rioters, the officer corps reaction to the idea was... *extremely* negative.
Not that I think it's *impossible* either, mind you.
I mean, given that the US military is drawn from the civilian populace, I actually don't think that's a very likely possibility.
*God* Afghanistan is such a clusterfuck.
I mean... yes and no?
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
No.
I don’t know whether Trump is fascist, per-say, because to be a fascist is to buy into an ideology that is much bigger then oneself and I don’t know if Trump really believes in anything beyond his own self-aggrandizement.
That is an academic distinction, however, only of real interest to historians. In terms of practical outcomes, the difference between a genuine fascist and someone who panders to fascist followers because it strokes their ego is a distinction with no difference.
(At least, not on this server)
Can't think of any other place you'd talk about it.
I mean... whose the next justice that is most likely to die? Please tell me it's one of the conservatives...
That's confusing the power of the *office* with the power of the *individual*.
Before the election, the state has the monopoly of violence. After the election, the state still has the monopoly of violence.
> Funny, I didn't know we called elections civil war
Elections don't see any breaking of the monopoly of violence.
Those are *not* pleasant.
> I think for one is the idea of permanent monopoly over violence.
> No individual or group maintains permanent hold of violence.
That tends to be a condition known as "civil war".
How is that not actually a state?
If anarchists call their thing that is in every-way-a-state-save-the-name something other then a state...
> it's anarchists who struggle with the idea that they could be called a state, not the other way around, so if they rename it to avoid their own problem it's fine
That... doesn't make much sense to me.
> If the wording of whether something is a state or not bothers people so much, then let's just rename it.
That seems to me that it runs into the issue of having something that just isn't called what it is so we can pretend that it isn't that thing, rather then it actually not being that thing.
> there is a metastable position of cooperative rule
That happens. But such conditions are rarely permanent. We've had such situations develop historically and the tendency is that after several months or years, one of the groups invariably falls out with the other due to a conflict of interests or something else.
Quite. And if you break that monopoly and hand it to multiple groups, what you wind up with is *multiple states*.
(Well, okay, obviously I don't buy it)
I... don't buy that.
The *institution* of the presidency is what holds the power, not the individual that is the president.
Wha... what happened with Gwen?
(Not to mention playing X-Com and seeing squaddies whiff 90% chance shots over and over)
That said, after 2016, I've learned to take nothing for granted.
Early-voters tend to vote democratic more however.
Well, some of those mail in votes have already been counted during this day, but it is true there are a bunch more that remain uncounted.
> Uhm searching on the net
> it says that trump is winning over biden by a 10%
As of 8:09 PM, ABC’s Electoral Vote tally has Biden with 44 and Trump with 15.
I'm dubious about how things might turn out if it goes to the courts.
Trump came along and managed to tap into that radical rightist populist zeitgeist in 2016 enough to catapult him to front-runner. And then the way the electoral system was set-up meant he managed to win despite convincingly losing the popular vote.
The difference is, the radicals in the democratic party are largely marginalized, whereas the the various extreme rightists in the Republican party have basically managed to conduct a total hijack of it's political momentum over the past decade or two.
So generally, communists have voted democrats (in fact, the CPUSA officially advises it's members to do so) and the fascists have voted Republicans.
And when I say "the left-wing" and "the right-wing" I mean ALL of it.
The exact groups have switched parties for various throughout history, but since roughly the 1970s, it is generally understood the democratic party represents the left-wing of American politics and the republicans the right-wing.
Something you've got to realize about the nature of the American political system is that if *de-facto* enforces a two-party system which sweeps a variety of ideologies into what are essentially coalition parties.
That said, parties don't last forever.
The Republicans *are* pretty opposed to genuine popular elections though, because higher voter turn-outs have correlated with them doing less-than-well in elections.
At least, until it'd inevitably get challenged in the federal court system.
Yeah, that'd be nice.
Ah, that inter-state compact?
Either that or a constitutional convention, but the only one of those that has ever been done... was the first one.
Fundamentally, the constitution was the result of a *lot* of compromises between the populists and the oligarchs who led the independence movement and then had to club together to get a country going under conditions that were fundamentally different from what they were today.
Eh... more the "big" states win then the cities particularly.
Yeah, because the way the electoral college allocates votes is bullshit.
Ohio looks promising. It's one of the states that already counted its mail-in ballots and the counties with the big cities are all sub-60% reporting in, while most of the red rural counties are above 80%.
Oh, yeah. A landslide win is out of the question now.
But a win isn’t.
> Is it just me who thinks Trump almost has a lead.
Yes? As of now, Biden’s sitting at 223 electoral votes to Trump’s 145. Popular Votewise, the balance is 49.8% for Biden vs 48.6% for Trump. Ultimately, it’s the electoral votes that will matter and they’ll fall as the battleground states do, but Biden’s already won by popular vote measurements and we can expect that lead to widen as more votes are counted.
Those are the bluest counties in the state, so who knows how they’ll tip the race.
My own state, Georgia, remains a toss up due to uncounted votes from Gwinnett and Fulton.
W00t! Another step forward!
> sounds like Mi, PA, and WI wont call it tonight
PA has something on the order of two million mail-ins that haven’t been counted yet, so yeah.
Looking at it historically...
Hoover - Great Depression
Ford - Wasn't really an incumbent, inherited his office and had fallout from Watergate.
Carter - Inability to deal with 70s economic malaise, foreign policy/military disasters (Iran hostage crisis, initial Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, etc).
Bush Sr - GOP vote was divided due to Ross Perot, and it still took Slick Willy to win.
Wondering if maybe it was just simple incumbent advantage...
Yeah, the whole "never Trumper" thing seems to have largely been a myth.
I mean, it is rather alarming that America hasn't been able to repudiate the fascist death cult that the Republican Party has increasingly become over the past two decades all that strongly.
Closest thing we've had in modern history was 2000.
Yeah. Roberts, the Chief Justice, has been voting over the past decade with an eye towards his legacy and he probably doesn't want to go down in history as the man who totally destroyed the legitimacy of American democracy. So I'm *slightly* more optimistic about a Supreme Court challenge not working out the way Trump and company thinks it would.
Wouldn't the vote count actually be done by the time the lawsuit saw court?
Yeah, that's like... what, a few hours old?
Fox and ABC called it yesterday, but best I can tell pretty much everyone else is being more leery.
There are still some uncounted ballots which leave things a bit unsure.
I'd wait until Biden's sworn in before starting that.
Even adding Trump to this list, it seems pretty clear that it's damn difficult to unseat a sitting president.
Supreme Court decisions are arrived at by simple majority.
That... depends on the judges.
Given this is presidential election issue, this is probably going to start at the level of the Court of Appeals, if not going straight to the Supreme Court.
There isn't a singular "constitutional court". Rather, there's a series of lower and intermediary courts in the District and Appeals Courts (respectively), culminating in the Supreme Court as the high court.
It's gonna be federal courts running this, almost guaranteed.
So the moment Georgia or Pennsylvania turns out, we can expect the AP to call them and Nevada. That way, even if Arizona still turns out Trump, they can just whistle casually and still be right.
The problem is that the AP called Arizona for Biden a fair bit too early. Then it turned out that AZ is still up in the air: trending Biden but not beyond the possibility of being wrong. So if the AP calls Nevada they'd either have to call the race for Biden which is disastrous for their credibility if they're wrong or admit that AZ was wrong while doubling down.
No, google's updating. It's just the AP.
Does patrolling the Mojave make you wish for a nuclear winter?
Fair.
Nevermind Pennsylvania. Whose thought of *Nevada* as much this week as we have?
Arizona, Florida, *or* PA is all Biden needs.
We like... still have a few tens of thousands to go.
Oh, I’m sure the courts will find that line of argument absolutely *compelling*.
Congress can be impeach judges, but at least for the Supreme Court that is as difficult as it is to impeach and convict a President.
Though, once appointed, they are largely beyond the ability of the US President to influence.
> that can't be elected by the PM/President
Erm, in the US, the federal courts are appointed by the executive branch.
Judge threw out the case pretty much instantly.
Same thing happened in Georgia.
And this shit's liable to happen.
You pump people up with the idea this is an existential election, then feed them bull about it getting subverted...
*Of course*.
But I'm an American, and every American I've talked too whose studied the issue generally agrees with the latter historical perspective rather than the former.
The claim is that the common American belief among those who think about the origin of money is that it was something of a social contract, with communities developing it grass-roots style for it's efficiency when in reality it's an innovation by state (or pseudo-state) institutions and then enforced down upon the larger populace.
> Using money instead of barters is still pretty good I think
Well, yes... kinda. Circumstance obviously plays a role here. But that's not the claim.
Pretty much everyone I know of who has ever considered the issue of "how did money get started?" realizes that economic exchange without any sort of state or pseudo-state organization enforcing it boiled down to bartering.
```To understand it, you need to understand the difference between the Chinese and American "money story." In the US, there is widespread, unquestioning faith in the fairytale that money predates the state and is separate from it.```
Wait, what?
If nothing else, judges are probably fulfilling their sarcasm quota here.
I think there was an onion article about that once...
Unless the margins are within a few hundred votes, which it might be, that isn’t liable to shift them enough.
I’m starting to get suspicious. If Georgia doesn’t finish up the count tomorrow, I’m definitely gonna start thinking the state government (which is GOP dominated) is doing it on purpose.

What's wrong with "crossdresser"?
Is there something time-consuming you find? A game in which you can blow hours away on?
As to an actual answer... hmm...
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Eh, embassies are a function of extraterritoriality.
Doesn't "transgender" cover that though? Or are we talking about someone who presents as a different without identifying as that gender?
Given that it's origin contains *no indication* of that.
I'm actually still unsure how the word "weeb" made the leap to mean "Japanophile" specifically and "anime/manga fan" more generally.
I love when it was nothing more than a Star War's meme for when people landed in *actual* traps.
Someone who labels another person or character a ||"trap"|| obviously has their own intent in doing so.
Well, no bearing on those *other* peoples and characters intent.
Am I?
I figure the 4chan rhetoric is *why* the t-word is bad. Because that is what it's trying to imply through it's use. Delegitimizing transgenders and/or crossdressers by implying their behavior is deceitful rather then expressive.
Oh, damn. Right...
Well, it also indicates that the intention in presenting is *purely* to decieve others, rather then to engage in some form of expression.
<:KirikaScared:672584678993297431>
I hadn't thought of it that way.
Oh... good point.
If you are a male presenting as female, yet you do not appear as female to others... then you have been unsuccessful in presenting.
That strikes me as more an issue of intent vs success.
But we're looking at trying to describe someone whose presenting while *not* actually going the full length of crossdressing yet does not necessarily identify as the gender they are expressing.
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
I mean, that's also crossdressing.
But not necessarily the converse.
I figure they'd be deeply linked. As in, if you identified with that gender, then you'd generally want to present and express yourself as that.
That is just begging for some sorta freelander to try and get his luggage back at the airport by breaking into the back.

Not exactly...
Yeah, although if you know what to look out for you can tell the difference between the most religious uses of the Swastika and the one the Nazis did.
It's less insularity and more exceptionalism.

Make sure to link her the message so she can exercise full judgement. Dino did put them in quotations to indicate he wasn't actually calling anyone that, although he should have at least also spoilered the words, if not avoided them altogether.
So, looking around, I am finding discussions involving people who are attracted to manga/anime bodystyles, but find nothing in *actual* photos of real life children... or are even repelled by it. So tusks claims about attraction to manga/anime childen automatically equating to attraction to real life children are clearly bupkiss. Otherwise, I don't really have any particular feelings about this matter and this will likely be my last message in this convo.
Such groups tend to have nothing heavier then small arms. They'd be dead meat in a open battle against a military and insurgency... well, insurgency would require at least localized popular support. Which could concievably be forthcoming depending on the details.
I mean, ideally the military gets coopted. That's what separates revolutions from civil wars.
That... kinda depends on the sort of definition of capitalism you are using.
I'd describe tribalism as a lot of things, but laid back is not really one of them...
(I know, that's the joke)
True, we could even wind up with Anarcho-*hyurrrk*-Capitalism.
Ah... but what sort of anarchy? Anarcho-Communism? Anarcho-Syndicalism? Mutualism?
More extreme rightist parties are the *last* things we need.
According to Sean Hannity, probably yeah.
American police unions are a unusual example in terms of their power. For the most part, unions have lost *a lot* of power since the 70s and have been heavily demonized by conservatives and more free market oriented liberals.
They exist.
*quiet laughter turning into sobbing*
It's not *just* them, they're just the starting point for it.
Is this another "Finland doesn't exist"-type meme?
Although I have joked about Zababa accidentally overthrowing global governments in an effort to legally get married.
Probably not a discussion for this channel, lol.
Ah yes. The Whiskey Rebellion, Shay's Rebellion, the difficulties of national governance under the AoC, among other things.
(Or... well, you can't, because they're all over a century dead)
True. Just ask any of the loyalists.
All it's leaders were already major leaders within the American colony.
In a very real sense, the American Revolution was a example of the local regional government rebelling against the central government.
It's why you have to be quite careful with them.
Ah, yes. The phenomenon of the revolution eating its children.
Yeah, coopting enough of the military for success is an *incredibly* unlikely endeavour. Civil war is more likely and civil war in a nuclear-armed state is... not a pleasant prospect.
Given this sort of imposed cognitive dissonance, I'm unsurprised that Unions can simultaneously poll as having a lot of support yet still constantly get voted down in referendums and legislation.
Due to propagandistic shenanigary by the Republicans, inadequate counter-pushback from democrats, and a mainstream media which loved to "teach the controversy" over accurate reporting for far too long, a lot of American voters are actually rather opposed to legislation that frequently would push policies they support. I think nothing better sums it up then a Tea Party sign from the early-2000s which said "I don't want government in my medicare!" Apparently completely unaware that medicare is a government program...
Egypt has honestly not been all that cracked up either, at least not since the Arab Spring.
2020 just couldn't go quietly, huh? It just had to claim one last victim.
I'm not gonna call it until it's settled, but things do look promising.
From what I've heard, it's lower relative to the 2020 November election, but higher then it has been in most previous run-off elections.
"Why vote if the elections rigged?" sorta thing.
The data does suggest that the aspersions of the legitimacy of the electoral process may have depressed Republican turn out.
It's possible that two wins for the Democrats in a row may buoy the normally demoralized minorities into realizing they have the capacity to permanently turn Georgia blue and maybe flip other states too.
Quite.
Which effectively means a Dem controlled senate after January 20th.
Of course, I see Melua is right here with this guy:
https://twitter.com/Taniel/status/1346644872216932362?s=20
Which is overwhelmingly a democrat area.
But the signs so far ***are*** good. Repubs have been underperforming in their strongholds while the democrat areas for the state are doing relatively superlative for this sort of election.
Since this is just a pundit.
Obviously, this is *far* from definitive.
I mean, I dropped in to post this:
https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1346647684900417536?s=20
Would've voted by absentee ballot, but it never came.
I voted early.
About 30 minutes.
Yep.
Things are looking pretty good. I feel good.
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Your right, I am.
Latest on Georgia: Democratic candidate Ossoff is liable to squeak by with a win at 95%+ odds. There may be a recount, but that won’t shift things enough.
War nick, the other democratic senate candidate is projected to not just be the winner, but to win by more than the 0.5% margin that will trigger recounts. Again, 95%+ odds.
If Warnock and Ossoff really both win, I can't help but think that the first thing the DNC should do is lock Stacey Abrams in a nice, remote mountain cabin for a few weeks so she can write a manual called 'How To Win Elections Without Being Satan... for Dummies.'

And then take every leader of every state Democratic party and force them to read it - A Clockwork Orange style, if necessary.
Major networks won't be calling it yet, but it's based on the areas left to count. So yeah, becoming increasingly convinced.

The Economist has called it for the dems.
Police seem to be holding the capitol building itself pretty effectively, though they had to evacuate two other nearby structures. Magats are still melting under just a bit of pepper. DCPD are getting more serious though. Their liable to reinforce and start bringing out heavier riot control ordinance: rubber bullets and tear gas.
DC Mayor just declared a curfew.
Which may mean they are gonna skip the rubber bullets and go right to the real ones.
Capitol police are treating this as an active shooter situation.
Of course, there are other agencies which don't have to worry about such restrictions...
https://twitter.com/camiloreports/status/1346911156372324355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1346911156372324355%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=

Bidens speaking now.
Police/feds seem to be massing just off the House-side of the capitol.
Even a couple of NatGuard humvees.
Oh, watching NBC right now. There's a BIG convoy of police and federal emergency vehicles rolling in.
"Tensions" *are* a matter of "seeming". It's based on the perception of the likelihood of crisis or war.
It may not lower them, but it also doesn't make them *quite* as high.
You'd *think* so. But it turns out it does.
No, it does. In the complicated world of international relations, attacks by proxy forces tend to have a level of... "acceptability" is really the wrong word, but it's the closest I can think of atm, in a manner that direct attacks don't.
One more level of deniability there.
Those rocket attacks were technically fired by Iranian proxies in Iraq.
At least, not yet.
But it's not like it was last January, when they fired a volley of ballistic missiles into an American base after the US assassinated one of their generals.
Oh, I'm *well* aware. They hijacked a South Korean tanker about a week ago.
Remember the WW3 memes?
At this time last year, we were staring down another crisis with Iran.
I mean, if we want to be technical, it's a violent uprising.
Even moderate repubs are calling this a coup attempt.
Dammit, where's this Mitch been over the last decade?
Well, they *are* British...
Really? Do you have a link to the text?
I mean, the *whole* of the city isn't federal land, but obviously large chunks of it are.
DC's an oddity, because it isn't a state but it also isn't a territory.
*Fuck yes*.

The DCPD has nearly 5,000 men. What's the estimate on the number of insurrectionists?
<:bayohug:708757355960991764>
Morbid curiosity makes me wonder how Fox and their even more extremist contenders in OANN and Newsmax are reporting on this...
Yeah, police, feds, and nat guard have let off some teargas. And they've pushed out the insurrection and set up a classic riot line set up outside the capitol building now, but it's still a far cry from how they treated BLM back in the summer.
Then he's not discussing this in good faith and is not a "centrist". Call him out on it.
But we're not seeing that much ATM.
They should be.
Ask him when BLM tried to break into the US capitol building to intimidate or harm the electoral process.
Insurrectionists are still in the streets and seem to be congregating towards the Supreme Court, but who knows if they'll last over the last next thirty minnutes before the curfew makes them arrest-on-sight cases.
There's been some gatherings outside of DC.
(It's joke)
https://twitter.com/ales_kot/status/1346916156439818240?s=20
Yeah, we shouldn't let the Republican moderates off the hook for enabling and going along with this for so long...

Maybe even gets extradited to face his charges over here.
I mean, at that point he's intercepted by Scottish/British police, arrested, and charged for illegal entry.
Personally, if he runs, I hope he runs to Russia.
Then he'll get to find out what happens to losers in the Russian political process. And precisely how much Putin actually cares about him.
Scotland has already refused him entry.
I imagine the New York State Prosecutor has charges already drawn up for Trump and is just waiting until after Biden gets sworn in on Jan 20th to file them.
Only if he is impeached and convicted by Congress.
The President can literally not be arrested for anything.
Given Cruz's level of intelligence, that might have flown over his head.
Romney's disconnection from the Republican Party continues...
https://www.businessinsider.com/mitt-romney-scolds-republicans-this-is-what-youve-gotten-2021-1
Some reports that arrests *are* being stepped up.
Looks like they are going to go to ground before the curfew makes them automatically persona non-grata.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Make no mistake, I'm not critiquing or anything.
I mean, it *is* logical.
Yet they were able to evacuate there without encountering them.
I mean, it's curious. Because at the time they locked down, the protestors were in the building too.
Interestingly, it sounds like congress never actually *left* the building. Instead, it seems like they hunkered down in some sort of bunker beneath the place.
Man, to believe how good we were feeling last night after the news from Georgia, right?
It's particularly beautiful, because he's on the way out by January 20th, so he basically has no legal means of adequately intimidating into rescension like the last time this happened.
I mean, it's 12 hours *after* he removes the tweets. If he does *not* remove the tweets, then the account will remain locked until Twitter decides otherwise.
I wonder how loudly he's screeching at his staff ATM.
https://mobile.twitter.com/reaIDonaldTrump
So, turns out Twitter decided not to wait...
Blame your opposition for what you yourself are doing.
It's called projection.
Ignore /pol/. It's a political cesspit.
It's 4chan.
Oh, conflict in the MidEast. The dumpster fire continues to burn. News at 11.
https://www.npr.org/2020/10/06/920849439/secret-service-agents-frustrated-with-trumps-unnecessary-coronavirus-risks
Pretty much...
Yeah, everything I've heard is the Secret Service don't like him very much.
I mean, after today's example I'd hope the Secret Service will be on maximum alert on inauguration day...
Sorta wondering why warning shots weren't fired over the groups head first. But maybe they were...
Now that doesn't necessarily make it *completely* justified.
She was leading the charge of a violent mob into the chambers.
I mean, it strikes me as far more justified then any of the police shootings of innocent people that have prompted BLM protests.
I'm hearing scattered reports that the senate and house republican objections have lost all steam and are buckling to reality. So the counting may be finished by midnight after all.
Correction: that was about two days after the BLM protests started.
It's about 1.35 kilometers (nearly one mile) to the northeast of the White House..
https://twitter.com/martinmatishak/status/1346968550498467840
Something just exploded?
Might be a technical issue.
Yeah, there's been some reports that you can still access previous caches through google and such.
Hence the "self-proclaimed".
Quite the legitimate question indeed! Undoubtedly after the clusterfuck that happened yesterday, they've beefed up security immensely, but god knows how much this might agitate the whole "deep state at war with Trump" conspiracy crowd and Congress isn't the only potential target such nuts might shoot after.
I don't recall any real timespan on the impeachment process. It can be as slow or as quick as the two houses wish it to be, so long as each step is followed.
And undoubtedly, they could use "he's on the way out in less than two weeks anyway" as a justification.
But I can see it just as well that they don't want the first American president who would be impeached *and convicted* in history to be a Republican one.
I can see *possibly* enough Repub senators being yesterday by this to agree to go along.
Well... *maybe*.
Oh yeah, I guarantee you there are multiple prosecutors eagerly awaiting for when 12:01 PM of January 20th ticks along to file already-drawn up charges against Trump over multiple things.
It's like saying "he was tried, but not found guilty".
He's been impeached, but in the process of his impeachment, he was not *convicted*. Remember, impeachment is the process.
The 25th Amendment is not an impeachment process.
That'd be the practical impact of a post-presidential impeachment conviction. Once impeached and convicted, those charged are incapable of ever holding federal office ever again.
It *might* be possible to impeach a president even after they've left office.
That's actually pretty funny. But why'd they add Piccolo?
Play stupid games...
In other, more positive news, Biden’s pick for Attorney General was Obama’s pick for Supreme Court Justice that the Republicans blocked in 2016.
I’d have to review how the state government and it’s elections are set-up to determine how hard that would be.
Sadly, yes. The state government is still dominated by the republicans.
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
When they say “crack open a cold one”, they don’t mean make it hot.
I heard they found pipebombs at the capitol and further unspecified IEDs at the RNC and DNC offices.
I like how their "unrest-arrest data" starts on *May 30th* last year. Nice way to play accounting games to anyone who glosses over that.
Also, lol.
Although maybe those aren't counting the RNC and DNC devices and purely focused on what went down at the capitol.
I actually heard there were more then two.
You hadn't?
Basically, this is the petulant child being forced to give an apology they don't believe in, only there's no actual "I'm sorry".

Proabably my favorite one is the NatGuard troops bedding down in front of a plague in the Capitol Building stating this is the same place that federal troops under Lincoln assigned to guard the Capitol were quartered during the Civil War.
And that increase to minimum wage!

Tell me about it.
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
That’s how their constituents are determined, not what they do.
Presidential Appointments, for example, are approved by the Senate, not the House.
The Senate is supposed to be the more powerful of the two houses.
That’s the case with the House, but it’s actually the inverted problem with the senate.
The senate, on the other hand, just grows at a rate of two senators for each state.
Yeah. The House froze the total number of seats available, but remains proportional to pop. So if a new state ever joins the Union, there will have to be a reshuffling there.
Well, that's been predicted for about a year now. Glad to see it finally come to pass. In other accountability news:

Is the new strain more lethal as well?
Most Russian citizens who are fans are probably just going to shrug their shoulders and use VPNs and other assorted tricks to bypass those bans anyway.

I recall it *was* 12 when it set out but one of them sank or something?
Watching the ongoing press secretary conference back-to-back with the first Tump press secretary conference is giving me a giant whiplash.

Nazbol gang!
I remember back when Obama was riding high on the "Thank God He's Not Bush!"
Yep. The "Thank God He's Not Trump!" Approval.
I mean, executive orders are pretty big deals. They're how the President gets stuff done *without* having to go begging to Congress to get off their asses all the time.
Sadly, no.
But that's harder to do with what are essentially voice and chatrooms.
On well-run forums of that scale, generally there is an extensive moderator staff for individual sections of the forum and a tiered system of appeals, judgements, and so-on.
Speculation is that Machin's public statements ahead of time was sort of as a political figleaf for his right-wing constituents. The Republicans have done something similar: made a lot of noise about doing something only to quietly do the exact opposite when the time comes. Because people rarely actually check the voting records...

Worth noting: I never finished Spice and Wolf. So if there is or isn’t I wouldn’t know first-hand.
There’s scientific knowledge ahead of it’s time in Spice and Wolf? I can see the sociological...
Economics?
Never thought this would be unironically relevant to a serious discussion, though in hindsight it seems inevitable now.

Fun fact, in the original draft of the script the bio-energy explanation didn’t exist. The original explanation was that human minds were hooked into a vast neural net for the extra-processing power, which was a far more sensible explanation. Execs made them switch because they didn’t think audiences would understand the explanation.
Do we have any indication whether they’ve renovated or otherwise overhauled the living conditions?
Pretty much.
I wonder if this is to offset the recent airstrike in Syria...
Ah yes, the ever intricate dance between the US political and defense establishments over our Middle East policy. Best summed up in the following picture:
Orientation being a sliding-scale more then a off-on switch, after all.
I mean, on reflection it's because the vast majority of people *are* at least a *little* bisexual.
It's almost certainly the Houthis.
And whatever you might think of Biden, he ain't Trump.
So far, the only president dumb enough to try that has been Trump.
This is "overturning basic American policy that's been entrenched for decades".
This goes far beyond "breaking campaign promises".
I mean, the Houthis have lobbed missiles into Saudi Arabia before.
Probably the latter, for the extra degree of deniability.
It's undoubtedly either Iran or one of the groups they've supplied.
The US and Saudi Arabia are simply too in-bed and intertwined in terms of economic and defense policy for the US to just turn on the Sauds like that.
There's no way that's the US.
Sure. DM me a link.
Other examples of such "tugs of war" is something like the world wars, where two nearly-even power blocs basically tore into each other in full military force at the costs of untold tens of millions of lives.
In some cases, the latter looks like what you mentioned, with two competing economic blocs driving the price of oil through the ground.
When you have two power blocs of approximately equal strength, what you tend to get is either nervous probing at one anothers strength or tugs of war like what you mentioned.
Those are either one country having so much power that they can force everyone within a certain proximity (in several meanings of the word) to do what they want, countries agreeing to use their power in certain ways, and so on...
Fundamentally, the international order is one of anarchy. There is ***no*** higher authority then that of power and the inter-related will to use it.
How much you can get away with is rather proportionate to how powerful you are.
Nobody did anything when the Soviet Union did it either. Hell, we didn't go to war with Germany because of the holocaust, we went to war with Germany because they got aggressive and started taking down everyone around them.
A lot of those people tend to have *something* to lose in the event that the countries of the world begin to undertake the changes necessary to truly combat the issue, even if it's something as little as their own pride.
Think of the people who deny it's a problem or who deny that it's a problem we can do something about.
The comparison that comes to me most naturally is climate change.
Because the answer to *that* question might involve some deep-seated changes in the system that run against some sort of ideological belief, or might mean the individuals in question relinquishing a advantegeous socio-economic position of some sort.
In part, because treating a hypothetical downfall due to internal factors as a inevitability offloads the responsibility of going "oh, okay, what might we be able to do to stay ahead?"
I find it's more people *wanting* China to eventually fall behind the US again and latching on any problem it has as evidence of some deep-seated inevitable reason that it *will* happen.
Yeah. I can't help but feel it's aggravation at the fact that it's because China is a rising rival that poses challenges to foreign policy.
*shrug*
I mean, Japan's been dealing with far worse for decades now and while it's economy has been rather stagnant following the Lost Decade, nobody really talks about the country *collapsing* in the same terms as they do about China. It's a *challenge* to be certain, but I'm more leery on predictions that it will be a challenge that *inevitably* causes the countries downfall or some sort of insurmountable block to it being a superpower.
Like, just a sudden "oh yeah, this entire thing *might* be fake news, we don't know, but anyway".
But I remember reading one article just a few months ago talking about supposed brownouts in the Chinese electrical grid, portraying them as fact and some sort of sign of a overstressed Chinese power system, only for it to suddenly go, almost a thousand words in, "we cannot verify whether these brownouts are actually occurring".
To be sure.
Of course, it's rather difficult to tell because western reporting on China can be, quite frankly, *awful*.
Now I can't find solid data on the Chinese population right now to verify it's predictions in those terms. But the economic predictions... well, China's economic growth *has* slowed somewhat, but not to the degree as predicted by the article and most analysts I see who have some kind of track record about being right on China tend to agree this has been as much about the impact of global events like the recession and Covid as well as conscious policy on the part of the CCP to rebalance economic growth to be less *rapid* and more *sustainable* then anything to do with demographic shifts, real or imagined.
"As a result of China’s very low fertility over the past two decades, the abundance of young, inexpensive labor is soon to be history. The number of workers aged 20 to 29 will stay about the same for the next few years, but a precipitous drop will begin in the middle of the coming decade. Over a 10-year period, between 2016 and 2026, the size of the population in this age range will be reduced by about one-quarter, to 150 million from 200 million. For Chinese aged 20 to 24, that decline will come sooner and will be more drastic: Over the next decade, their number will be reduced by nearly 50 percent, to 68 million from 125 million."
All I can say is... well, look at this guy from 2010:

*shrug*
Eh, I've been hearing for the last two decades how China's demographic issues will be it's undoing any day now. The consistency of these predictions, and their failure to bear fruit, have made me a fair bit jaded on the prospect.
Indeed. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it threatens to crash your entire economy.
On Jack Ma: someone explained to me what happened with him in detail and it’s actually an interesting example of innovation almost going wrong...
And I gotta take my Dad on a walk.
And interesting point about Cuba and Bolivia. Definitely something to watch.
They singled him out because Ant Financial accidentally’d a ponzi scheme was threatening to implode their entire financial sector.
They didn’t single out Ma because he didn’t toe the party line.
No doubt it doesn’t *hamper* it. What I’m leery about is the assertion that it automatically *causes* it.
That is, the 1970s.
Erm... Taiwan’s transition from cheap, labor-intensive manufactures to advanced electronics took place right about the same time as South Korea’s.
Notably, democracy and liberalization in both countries came *after* they had developed the innovative economies you are talking about.
Right. So did South Korea.
Pluralism is another matter, he’s definitely killing that, but causative the link between pluralism and social mobility... isn’t really there.
And I’m still not seeing any evidence that Xi’s reforms actually strangle innovation.
He is a red prince who didn’t follow the trajectory of most red princes.
And in terms of social mobility: Xi’s reforms have been essential in breaking the power of the “Red Princes”, Communist Party members who owe their positions purely to being the children of older Deng or Mao-era and who have been heavily *against* measures that promote social mobility.
Again, that sounds like an ideological plank rather then one based on the evidence.
China has been relying heavily on SoEs for it’s economic growth *this entire time*.
> Existing research sometimes provides mixed evidence on China SOEs, probably due to lack of consensus on theories regarding China SOEs. Most important, the literature didn’t provide clear answer on the question: If China’s SOEs perform poorly, why has China achieved the fastest economic growth of the last 40 years by relying on its SOE?
Is 40 years not considered “long-term”?
“Oh no, SoEs never took off in America and Europe. That means *they must* fail in China...”
What kinda response is that?
“State-owned enterprises (SOEs) play an increasingly important role in today’s global economy. There were 27 SOEs in Fortune Global 500 (FG500) in 2000, and this number increased to 102 in 2017, accounting for one fifth of the FG500 corporations.”
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755309119300437
Not what the numbers suggest.
Which is nothing new. China’s economy has always relied heavily on SoEs.
Again, these are talking points I’ve been hearing for the last two decades. And not just about Xi either.
And most evidence that is provided about that tends to strike me as standard regulatory moves by governments to ensure that the economy keeps going. I don’t know what article you are copy-pasting from, but Government-driven economic expansion *is* an accepted part of economics outside of neo-liberal and libertarian economics.
Also, I can’t help but notice how much this assumption of “more regulations=less economic freedom, less economic growth” mirrors Republican talking points about such.
I’ve seeing *precious* little evidence for that assertion.
What does that even mean? If it’s about economic freedom, then that’s already by-and-large occurring. If it’s about socio-political freedom, then that strikes me as based on neo-liberal assumptions about economic and socio-political freedoms being joined at the hip, an ideological plank with uncertain evidence in reality.
This is another prediction I’ve seen about China for the last decade or so. That somehow it will fail to make the transition from a manufacturing to service-based economy...
Yet as of 2020, the Chinese service sector already represents a majority of both Chinese GDP (54 percent) and contribution to the nation’s total economic growth (60 percent). So it seems to me that it *is* managing to make that transition...
It’s how they got Capone...
Mmm, fair.
I don’t know. To me, illegalizing and prosecuting the scammers seems like a better way to hold them accountable. Because they’ve destroyed people’s lives.
And developing products to cater to the scam strikes me as the wrong response...
Innovative scams do not cease to be innovation just because they are scams.
I mean, it is. It’s just not a good one.
Given how much of a scam cryptocurrency has proven to be, that strikes me as a bad example...
Eh, to quote the explanation I got:
> 2. In China, finance IS politics, and state capitalism will make a lot of leeway for innovation and tech ascendency, but not at the cost of accountability.

I mean, in this day and age you’d *expect* the to realize their incredibly fortunate to even be permitted a ceremonial role in government, instead of losing all their titles and estate at best and their lives at worst.
If God didn’t intend for commoners to be so filthy, he would have made them royalty. *long, stuck up snort*
Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.
"Oh no, forcing corporations to not treat Freelancers like dogshit is more expensive and this is bad" is certainly a take...
Broken windows fallacy.
If either WW1 or WW2 or both hadn’t happened... there probably would’ve been trade offs. You’d probably see stronger economies in Eurasia and greater scientific growth as a result, but less social development since the greater stability provides less incentive for social change.
WW1, on the other hand, definitely does seem near-inevitable.
Stalin, on the other hand, was an even more a cautious opportunist. While the Soviet economy was well geared for war (it’s one of the few things command economies are any good at), the purges had left the Red Army’s organization and skills in a woeful state with which it would take until ‘42 or ‘43 to recover and he knew it.
Probably wound up more like Franco. For all his absurd bombast, he only ever tried to play vulture in Hitler’s conquests, only jumping into the war when France has been defeated and everybody thought Britain would sue for peace any day now.
Even many of the pre-WWII crisis you just don't get if you don't have Hitler driving things along.
You just don’t get WW2 without Hitler. At least not remotely in the same fashion that it did. Yes, it's likely that there'll be a rise of right wing sentiment in Germany, and a re-militarization of the country, but without Hitler the German leadership won't be nearly so dedicated to starting a war. This is particularly the case since the French and British were willing to make some pretty extreme concessions to Germany in the interests of avoiding another conflict. Virtually any other German leader would have taken Munich as a triumph and cashed in at that point, as indeed most in the Nazi Hierarchy and the Wehrmacht leadership wanted. It's not that other German leaders of the day were peacenicks or anything, but none of them were willing to take the gambles Hitler was.
Pretty much any more rationality would do it. Or would have thrown away rearmament at an earlier stage and sought economic reintegration with the global community, but obviously such a government would not be seeking conquest like Hitler was.
By which point, the Anglo-French and Soviets, with their stronger economies, would have rebuilt and reformed their militaries to the point such a war would be a foregone conclusion.
A more cautious and rationale German government in the late-30s would have stopped at Czechoslovakia, if not early, at least until the economic consequences of rampant, breakneck rearmament caught up with them in the early/middleish 1940s.
Unlikely. Not *impossible*, per say, but still unlikely based on extrapolation from what we know of the attitudes of German political-military elite in the 1930s.
And there’d probably be *some* military research even in peacetime, since even leaving warheads aside, nuclear power offers a attractive mechanism for capital ship propulsion. It could, as you say, never evolve beyond an endless exploratory program though.
Japan or continental European countries would probably be much more comfortable with that degree of government oversight and involvement in peacetime than the US.
Rather depends on the country.
FWIW, I do agree that there isn’t *100% certainty* that what I’m arguing would be the case.
Yeah. It might sound more ornery then it actually is, since tone can be hard to communicate across the ‘net.
But since it made it easier for Germany to weather the British blockade, it probably made it more willing to go to war, however infinitesimally, then would otherwise have been the case.
It predates WW1.
Haber process is actually an inversion if this phenomenon.
I mean, my fundamental assertion is that though demand may be lower, it’ll still come and the greater supply of resources will make it easier to fulfill when it does.
No, it’s not. The assertion that for all it’s acceleration in a timeframe of a few years years, the overall resource drain and distortions imposed by hugely destructive major wars causes a slow down over a longer-timespan of decades that offset it is quite supportable.
That’s a unsupportable assertion.
If you actually look at it, WW2 basically *gutted* scientific advancement outside of the USSR and the USA for about a decade or two after its end (and the former case only kept up by looting the technical-industrial expertise of Central and Eastern Europe, further impoverishing then for a generation). Even during the war, most of the major technological advancements (not all, but almost so) during the war occurred in the only country whose economy actually grew during it, rather then stagnating or collapsing: the United States.
Sure, and economic competition would still exist without the world wars. And there would be more resources for industry to throw at them globally.
Particularly since your hyper-focusing on the cutting-edge, high profile cases and ignoring many of the less glamorous but no-less important stuff. Advancements in chemicals, textiles, and medicine could very well have come *faster*, only they would have been applied in civilian life first rather then military life.
No, I did not. Your confusing specific advancements with the cumulative state of scientific development *overall*.
I am. The advancements may have been spread out over a greater period of time, nuclear power in particular would have probably taken 20 more years, but it would’ve come. You’d just see power reactors before bombs rather then vice-versa.
I don’t buy it. The war’s resulted in a loss of economic resources and potential scientific talent that probably held back scientific development just as much, if not more so, as the extramilitary  investment.
Because that economic loss has a direct impact on scientific investment.
No, I *am* using it correctly.
Well, you just happened to find some fellow big history nerds who understands a lot of the nuance of Nazi Germany while still abhorring it completely. There aren’t a lot of us who venture to these parts of the ‘net, but we exist.
Actually, Adam Tooze investigated that and found that generally the German atrocities were baked into the plan as a logistical necessity and the Wehrmacht was heavily complicit in the planning and preparation for it. As it's failure before Moscow so dramatically demonstrated, German logistics simply wasn't up to the task of supplying it's forces in the field and that's when they were able to forego large shipments of food by having the troops loot from the civilian populace like a horde of locusts, condemning many of them to starvation. That this would inspire vicious resistance that would have to be put down through heinous reprisals was taken as a given. In order to make the invasion seem possible even to Wehrmacht planners on a very basic level, the barbarous treatment of the Soviet population (and indeed, much of Europe) was a feature in the military and economic planning for Barbarossa, not a bug.
Of course, many of his supporters who survived the war (and the war crimes trials) subsequently tried to downplay their involvement, attempting to rewrite history in their memoirs to try and make themselves look better, both morally *and* professionally.
Of course, by the same token, he also enjoyed a lot of support since the military elite happened to like a bunch of Hitler's ideas (German greatness, expansionism, militarism out the wazoo) even if they were suspicious of the populist elements of Nazism. Fundamentally, those who opposed Hitler in the German military elite were a minority, and those who went so far as to try and kill him were a fringe minority.
Stalin's actually a similar example: he started out as a cobbler's son and a failed seminary school student who managed to backstab his way into one of the prominent leaders of the Bolshevik party and, from there, as ruler of one of the world's two military superpowers by the time he died.
Quite. It's worth noting that a lot of the smart guys he surrounded himself, like Manstein and Rommel, were in awe of Hitler's military and political acumen... at least until the bloom came off the rose in the later years. If you read any decent history of the German leadership in WWII, there are plenty of instances were Hitler cut right to the heart of the matter and asked the most important questions, or raised the most important issues, displaying the kind of penetrating intelligence that is generally taken as a hallmark of genius. Both the madness and drug addictions were stuff that ramped up over time, in reaction to the increasing stress of him trying to take on the burden of running a massive war almost by himself.
I mean, given how much of a monologuer Hitler tended to be in private about anything and everything, I wouldn't be surprised if he addressed it at *some* point.
Other times it's just either a comfort thing or because they identify as a rather specific non-binary gender that the pronoun describes in some way.
Possibly. According to the LGBTA wiki, one of the potential reasons *is* to avoid confusion with the plural useage of "they/them".
Or ey/em/eirs, which I just discovered now while researching neopronouns.
Could say the same for Fae/Faer.
Pretty much. A whole buncha the news media have latched onto this but their falling for a big Republican swindle in doing so: the crisis was already existant under Trump because Trump was the one who created it, but it was ignored. Now Biden's president and *suddenly* the Republicans are shouting about this big ol' border crisis and blaming it on Biden. But it's Trump whose left Biden (A) without the infrastructure to deal with this and (B) with a bajillion *other* problems that he simultaneously has to address which makes it difficult for him to spare resources for this in a timely enough manner.

Welcome to our post-ironic entertainment culture...
80% odds it's being written tongue-in-cheek.
Fair enough.
You underestimate Republicans and their constituents willingness to shoot themselves in the head to own the libs.
Well, that’s a picture perfect discrimination lawsuit...

From what I understand, the 40K community is still in the relatively early stages of the "chase out the fash". I've heard that Games Workshop has only recently explicitly walked out and gone "No you morons, the Imperium's social policies are *not* a role model to emulate. Jesus Christ..."
Every fandom community seems to run through this process. The Nazis and other shitheels flock in as it gets popular, the moderates deny there's a real problem, then eventually *something* gives that causes the community and even the official creators to turn on them and start driving them out.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure there are several countries in the world that fit that description right now. The US among them.
Well, they'd have a hard time pinning anything on me. I don't even *know* how to bot-fake impersonate people.
Great, so who are they going to prosecute?
Because that's how it works: two videos are made that contradict each other, therefore they cancel each other out. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Well, fuck that noise then.
Because the former would make it alright, but the latter is voter suppression.
Is the state issuing photo IDs or is it up to the citizens to get them?
Or is that not the type of Shadow Government we're talking about?
I don't know. It seems to me like having a cabinet already laid out and ready to displace the old one with their own policies would ease the transition of power if the opposition party manages to become the ruling one.
Fair enough.
Plus, every time they've fought Israel, the IDF has kicked their ass. Arab armies in modern combined arms warfare have a frankly *unbelievable* (as in, people still don't believe it even though we have actual, consistent records of it) history of incompetence behind them.
Saudi Arabia's too worried about Iran, Egypts trying to keep a lid on it's domestic problems, Jordan has been apathetic since '68, and Syria and Iraq are literal wrecks.
I find another Arab-Israelis War to be impossible given the Arab World's current state.
I think a perpetual status quo like you said where everyone just apathetically soldiers on despite all the suffering-with-no-resolution is what's probably going to happen.
Definitely "worst case" scenarios here.
Oh, I don't regard them as *likely* outcomes, mind you.
Bad End #1: The Jewish supremacist wing of the Israeli hardliners manages to gain enough critical mass to implement their envisioned ethnic cleansing and succeed. The real tragedy in this end isn't just the effective genocide of the Palestinian populace, but also that Israel basically becomes that which it was supposed to be a safehaven from.
Bad End #2: As in 1, except said supremacists attempt *fails* because it provokes a international backlash of such magnitude as to turn Israel into a pariah state. Stripped of all outside economic and military backing, the Israelis state crumbles and the Palestinians take revenge for such an attempted ethnic cleansing with their own.
Which, given the dynamics at play here, could lead to one of the two "bad ends" I mention.
Yeah. That's why I view the "good end" (that is, the Palestinians are made full citizens of Israel, with all the rights, representation and voting privileges of all other Israelis citizens) as incredibly unlikely. Even if it might work out, neither side actually *wants* that...
We do *not* want the Kahanists preferred option being tried.
Some options that have been considered haven’t actually been tried for one reason or another. And do note, that for some of those options, that is actually a *very* good thing...
I do think there are three potential ends: two bad, one good, all extraordinarily unlikely to happen.
It’s a sorry state of affairs. Hamas exploits anger and resentment towards the Israelis occupations and blockades among the Palestinian populace to gain recruits and funds. They use those to launch attacks against Israel and kill some Israelis. The Israelis government, which is increasingly being controlled by hardliners with theocratic views on how the Jewish state should be run, then retaliates harshly, which kills a bunch of Palestinians. Rinse-and-repeat.
The problem is that the Israeli and Palestinian populations have become inextricably too intertwined and any moral resolution of the conflict is going to have to accept they they will likely have to exist within the same state's border and learn how to live together... even though neither party wants to.
A practical two-state solution in would, in part, require large-scale ethnic cleansing of the Israeli settler population of the West Bank. Even if the vast majority of them only moved on to the land in the last few decades, I find that morally problematic..
I mean, no. Because many of the initial wave of settlers also came from Britain.
I mean, if we're talking about what's going on *today* rather then *several thousand years ago*, the creeping expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank are very blatantly a unofficial ethnic cleansing attempt to displace the Palestinians who live there already...
Many Palestinians are simply the Islamic descendants of Ancient Israelites the Romans didn't evict who were converted when the first Caliphate conquered the region.
And converted many of the people who weren't pushed out.
You might want to set-up a sleeping spot in a shelter Solly...
It's looking like this'll be a long one.
No. As I've said, it's precisely because I don't expect the Israelis to ever attempt it that I don't expect that outcome.
Oh, sure. But that's not a roadblock on it *working* if attempted. That's a roadblock on the Israelis *attempting it*.
I assume that's an actual group and not just a statement of methods?
Haven't heard that term before...
Because in the closest example we have to something like this happening (that is, South Africa in the late-80s/early-90s), the result was **not** that the previously apartheid'd majority turned around and oppressed the new (still substantial) majority. As it is, 10-15 members of the Israel parliament are already Arab-Israeli these days. They do not call for Jewish Israelis to be genocided or even ethnically cleansed. The Arab-Israeli base that elects them do not generally call for Jewish Israelis to be genocided. It's almost like being given citizenship, suffrage, and civil rights can shift peoples priorities from "drive them to the sea" to "the rent is too damn high".
I mean, we've been here. In South Africa in the 80s.
That's not *equal* rights though. If the Palestinians were on the same footing as the Israelis as citizens, they'd probably have the majority share of the Knesset through raw voting power alone...
Which is actually one of the reason Israelis don't like the idea. Israel would cease to be the "Jewish state".
Its what the USA, South Africa, and every other colonial state has eventually had to do, because unlike the former overseas imperial states they could not simply divest themselves of their colonies and let them become independent.
Israel accepts it's responsible for control of the West Bank, formally annexes it, and gives all the Palestinian people within equal citizenship, rights, and voice in it's government.
A good chunk of those being moved *die*.
It sounds so easy doesn't it? Just move hundreds of thousands of people...
Except we know what happens every time that *has* happened, practically without exception.
Because what's required for a positive resolution, in my opinion... well, the will just isn't there.
Regrettably, that's probably going to be the case.
I mean, don't get me wrong. Ethnic cleansing is a "solution". It's just a *awful* solution that we don't want.
Do you know how many people *died* in doing that?
You did? So those hundreds of thousand of Israelis settlers currently in the West Bank are just... what, a mirage?
And to my own point, I can be sympathetic to some of the tactical problems the IDF faces in having to balance the safety and security of it's citizens and soldiers against the difficulty of adequately targetting and avoiding collateral damage, as well as the callous attitudes that invariably develop towards those perceived as "the enemy" in warzones and how that might affect the aforementioned balancing act.
There's different levels of caring and different levels of not caring.
Frankly, I find these sorts of details to be unimportant. It's missing the forest for the trees. As it is right now, no Palestinian group has the military power to be remotely the kind of threat to Israel that Israel is to the Palestinians it has under it's thumb.
And yeah, that's a non-sequitor. China really should be doing with Uighur's what Israel should be doing with Palestinians... hell, if anything the Chinese have less of an excuse, because it's not like giving the Uighur's equal rights to vastly larger Han populace will threaten the CCP's control over all of China!
Well, part of that is because the Israelis have the overwhelming amount of power in this conflict. It's not that the Palestinians are powerless or anything, but they don't have the same amount of power to wield that Israel does.
I suppose "worked on more successfully", maybe?
Fair enough.
It does not absolve Israel of it's sins, any more then it does them.
But saying "oh others did it too!" is whattaboutism...
That's always going to be a work in progress.
Yes, not that I believe those solutions have been perfect or complete.
They've also been solved.
That's my point.
It's hard to deny that a state where the majority population in the territory under it's control is denied citizenship and equal rights is not an apartheid.
Actually my point: the only places that look like the West Bank are places like Chinese treatment of the Ugyhur or Burmese treatment of the Rohingya. But those are authoritarian developing nations. Israel, by contrast, is a developed 1st world democracy in theory, economically prosperous and militarily strong.
That's a similar argument to what was advanced in South Africa by supporters of Apartheid. The reminds me of the "nothing can be done says only country where this regularly happens" meme associated with the USA and mass shootings. The Israeli are somehow unique among all non-overseas imperial colonial power in that they can neither definitively divest themselves from their colonial holdings and colonized peoples nor fully incorporate them into their nation proper. I don't believe them. Every other developed nation and/or democracy has done so, often imperfectly and in progress, but with real tangible progress once real effort was put into it.
Well, the Palestinians only have so many rockets themselves.
Apparently, some of the mass attacks have managed to overwhelm Iron Dome recently through the tried and true method of putting up more incomings then it has interceptors.
Oh? Then what Islamist desires are motivating the mostly-Catholic FARC? What Islamist sentiments motivated the nationalistic-marxist desires of the Vietcong?
Is that why the phenomenon has also been observed in South America and Southeast Asia?
The Vietcong in Vietnam, and many of their VPA allies once they infiltrated down to the south, practiced the same approaches, hiding weapons and munition stockpiles in civilian villages.
And no, it is not. It is the universal rule of guerrilla warfare. "The civilian populace is the sea in which the guerrilla fighter swims."
Not unique. Military powers love to pull those shenaniganry.
It's keeping in the letter of the law, while still violating the spirit.
Yep.
That's the paper thin excuse given.
White Phosphorous is used for "target marking".
Oh, I can imagine the IDF's excuse there. It's the same as the US's...
That's inevitably a product of the Palestinian insurgents being the weaker power. They can't protect their installations well enough to have them be out in the open and visible separate from civilian installations. Because then the IDF would easily wipe them out no fuss and all that investment on the insurgents part is wasted.
But OTOH, the IDF can't just sit around and do *nothing*.
That's the problem.
The military answer is suppression of the launch sites, so as to curtail or prevent further launches.
And honestly, "a military's force has moral lapses in the middle of a warzone and conducts intentional civilian casualties"... well, that happens. It's war. Soldiers develop very callous attitudes and those attitudes invariably affect their actions, even if it's not the official wish of the official overall institution. It's universal.
I'm seeing some accusations of ad-hominems being thrown apart by both sides, but those are (ironically enough) the only ad-hominems I can find reviewing this conversation.
Well, I gotta go get dinner. Again, <@!279341087494242304> and <@!476058996315389953>, I hope you stay safe. Whatever the larger issues at stake here, you have no fault in them. Best wishes.
"shoes are a tad bit too heavy to fill"? I'm afraid I haven't heard that saying before...
It is the nature of the beast.
You'll be hard pressed to find a country that doesn't have skeletons in it's closet.
States mainly exist through a combination of monopoly of force and recognition of other countries. Whether it's "right" or not runs straight into the "is/ought" problem and is unproductive.
I always find the question of "right to exist" to be... besides the point when it comes to countries.
I'm unaware of any munitions the Russians *directly* provide to either side.
Now indirect provisions (ie: the Russians send stuff to Syria or Iran that then gets transferred to Hamas and friends), that's certainly possible.
The Russian state is extraordinarily self-interested, even by the standards of state actors.
When that happens, they just don't comment.
They have no stake themselves.
Russia just doesn't have any interest in the conflict.
I feel it's more simply then that.
I know I'm making it sound mechanical, and I apologize for that Solo. I... well, I don't think I can say I *know* the fear that must be gripping you being on the receiving end of these attacks, but I can imagine it. As Shemmy pointed out, I have the luxury of space to view this conflict. You and all the other poor souls, on both sides, caught up in it... don't.
Modern warfare can chew through ammo like nobodies business and even relatively well-supplied non-state actors (as well as poorer state actors) have to operate in "bursts" as a result.
That's why these battles tend to spurt up for several weeks, then quiet down for months or years at a time as they restock.
Apparently they’re bringing in border police units to try and quell these mob attacks.
I’ve been seeing reports of mob violence on both ends. One Israeli was even misidentified as Palestinian by a pro-Israelis mob and attacked.
Oh, here we go. The complicated dynamics of intentionality in war zone action, and confusions of individual and group actions with that of the (larger) institution...
In fact, one of the main reasons counter-insurgent forces don't tend to shut down cell infrastructure, despite the fact that would effectively kill the insurgents wireless communication ability, is precisely because allowing insurgents access to such comms is generally considered an acceptable price for the ability to gather masses of intelligence, track insurgent activity on a wide scale, and target and kill various fighters and commanders.
I don't feel it particularly like that Israel has cracked any sort of "secret comms" on Hamas's side. Hamas is a non-state organization, they don't have the resources to acquire high-grade encryption exclusive to their organization. At best, their using appropriated and modified open-market encryption that is fairly easy for any reasonably modern national cyberintelligence agency to crack. The explanation is likely far simpler: Groups like Hamas, when they can't use things like couriers, tend to use open comms but pull shenanigans like speaking in code and jamming the airwaves with junk chatter. But the margin for errors on these techniques is hellaciously small and it's easy to make mistakes that eavesdroppers can capitalize on, requiring fairly rigid radio discipline. That makes it rather likely that one of their group fucked up and let something slip in using the open comms that tipped off the Israelis.
Oh, well, hello 2006 again...
Apparently the IDF also hit the Associated Presses offices and they are pissed about it...
https://blog.ap.org/announcements/ap-statement-on-destruction-of-gaza-bureau
Yeah. While there are legitimate criticisms to levy against either side in the Palestinian Conflict, part of the problem with effectively making them is that assholes like this love to hijack them for their own racist or ideological ends and it poisons the well.
*ooh*, I'll have to pick those up at some point...

CNN is pretty damn centrist, lovingly hiring all sorts of right-wing analysts and giving them plenty of platform in their efforts to appear 'unbiased'. But they'll happily regurgitate right-wing talking points in doing so without any critical examination of them.
> Yeah No. The PRC is an evil state that commits genocide, infringes upon human rights and freedoms on all sprectrums, and has imperialistic ambitions with all it's neighbors especially Taiwan. Please do not defend that kind of state. There's literal evidence of all of those things.
And you'll be so kind as to point out where I did actually mount a defense of the PRC on such counts? That the PRC does do genuinely bad things is no reason to spread lies and fearmongering about things they have **not** done, like the Epoch Times or China Uncensored are prone to doing. All that does is ruin your credibility with moderates and fence-sitters when objective informers debunk you, thereby propagating a "boy who cries wolf" effect and helping the PRC.
China Uncensored is like the Epoch Times: a known Falun Gong front. While the group has been suppressed and victimized by the Chinese Government, they have responded by developing such a virulent Anti-PRC bias that they are known to be willing to make shit up and peddle conspiracy theories. As accurate and objective sources, they are deeply suspect.
That'd be "the video is really about more than that", yeah...
But the video is really about more than that...
He basically destroys the "science" in 52 seconds.
From what I can find, the entire thing was being handled by the Wuhan Municipal Health Service up until sometime between January 1st and 10th. That's when the national dispatched noticed it enough to dispatch a group from the National Health Commission, who in turn issued a report to the WHO around January 11th/12th. And even then, they did not yet know that the virus was capable of human-human transmission.
Claims of the virus being of laboratory origin have been popping up since at least March 2020, possibly even earlier, and always wind up getting debunked. Analysis of the virus's genomic data is consistent with a virus which originated in the wild, mutated in the wild, and made the jump to humans through the usual open-vectors like animal wet markets. This is solid, scientific evidence and that far outweighs wild speculation about why a couple of workers at a lab might have taken some sick leave a month before the outbreak.
Yes, they are often advanced as being part of the conspiracy. Sometimes incoherently so, but it's not like conspiracy theories can be consistent on that point.
> Would you really lump the Wuhan Virus potentially being an escaped experiment from a lab in the same catergory as stuff like Qanon?
Given that QAnon folks are foremost among the types who push that theory, yes.
Something of a New Age cult that started up in China in 1992. The Chinese Government banned and started suppressing them in 1997 for a variety of reasons, forcing most of them into exile. It briefly caused the cult to become something of a cause célèbre among human-rights groups until they started to notice the groups more... *eclectic* beliefs. Basically a textbook case about how not all victims of authoritarian oppression are automatically "good guys". This is a pretty good overview:
https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Falun_Gong
But it's also one of a whole bunch and isn't even necessarily the most important one, globally speaking.
Well, to be fair to Tamamo: China *is* a problem that is steadily increasing. They got that right.
Well, let's not be universal about this. The consensus I've read from most experts in the field is that China's response to the virus was flawed and suffered from an initial failure to appreciate the situation, but once it *did* realize the situation, it moved pretty effectively and decisively, though a number of flaws were still noted in said response. Moving away from China, it is true that there are plenty of countries who handled the virus a lot worse then China did... and but in fairness, there are also ones which handled it a lot better.
I heard about it by early-January. And I was reading both large-scale action being taken by the Chinese and warnings from said government about how the virus would go global by the end of the month.
> They did suppress the leak about it at the start tho
A bit more complicated then that. Most of the immediate suppression was regional, with the Wuhan government in December ordering all government agencies to act like everything was "normal". Best evidence is that the central government appears to have become aware of the virus sometime in early-January, but was apparently slow to realize the seriousness of the situation. The authoritarian structure of China is a bit more decentralized then most people appreciate, with regional and provincial governments given plenty of latitude by the central government so long as nothing big happens.

When the Chinese government *did* wake-up to the seriousness of the situation, however, is generally regarded as pretty effective. Their blockade on most travel into and out of Wuhan is generally regarded as having slowed the spread of the virus by up to a month.
> Organ harvesting is not a myth. There's facual evidence of it.
It's a myth. The practice was already rather limited and regulated prior to 2015, but it was outright banned in 2015. Since then, some doctors have been arrested by the Chinese government for practicing it illegaly, but that they were arrested and jailed is proof enough that it is not an sanctioned activity.
> There's facual evidence of it. Coronavirus is NOT a bio weapon. There's indications that it might have been bad security procedures at the Wuhan Virology lab that set it free.
Uh-huh. And why would a virology lab happen to hold a never-before-seen virus variant unless it was engineered as part of a larger program? As opposed to it already being an existant virus that developped in the wild. Frankly, the origin of the virus is well-established as one which was a freak mutation that made the leap from bats to humans and which was provided an opportune vector in the form of the Wuhan "wet" markets. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 shows that it shares about 96% of its RNA with a RaTG13 coronavirus strain found in a bat, and has strange and unusual mutations that are nothing like anything a human scientist could possibly create.
Hmm... would reporting this to Discord do any good?

What's worse is that we *do* lock up the criminally insane. Being found "Not Guilty For Reasons of Insanity" may mean you get to avoid prison, but it also means you are sent to a "high-security psychiatric facility"... which is just a euphemism for saying "prison for people with mental illness". It's not a *pleasant* experience either: regular American prisons is bad enough, but I've heard it remarked that if you are a sane person who was committed to one, you'd probably develop a mental disorder living in it. And it's also incredibly hard to legally get out of: you have to stay there for *at least* the same amount of time as a regular prison sentence before they'll even *consider* letting you go and in all likelihood, if you are genuinely ill enough to get sent to one of these, you'll probably stay there for the rest of your natural life.

The Classical Chinese Dynasties viewed the Roman Empire more as a mirror to themselves: *a* center of civilization, along with themselves, rather then *the* center.
Some amends have been made. There have been some apologies issued. I don't know if one can say *all* amends they have made.
Note: many of those people have never been interred in a shrine, so their spirits are presumably viewed still as impure and guilty for... whatever.
Or they were close enough to the previous one in attitude to stick with it.
I imagine they had bigger concerns at the time.
Japan has had precisely two governments in power since 1945: a brief one in the late-2000s, and then essentially the same one continuously throughout the entire rest of it's post-war history.
Yeah, and those people tend to be regarded as bigoted dipshits by most sensible people.
Yeah, there *are* Japanese who don't see it that way.
Oh yeah, I can see definitely why people would have a problem with declaring "These spirits are no longer guilty of their horrific crimes not because of anything they did, but because we did a ceremony after they had died."
If some Shintoists objects to people objecting too that, then they need to do some soul-searching on what they value.
That's true. She probably will still continue ties with many other Chinese companies, and certainly will suffer no harm in her opportunity to get careers in Japan.
But I can also see the Chinese companies side of this.
I don't know, I can be a bit sympathetic too Ai Kayano...
Now, is it possible the company let go of Ai Kayano because the CCP ordered the company to do so? Yes.
Is it possible the company let go of Ai Kayano because the company on it's own initiative decided to do so without much input from the party or the government? Also yes.
The recent stuff around FNAF is a really good analogy, yeah.
Yeah, either/or.

Kinda is, kinda isn't?
The apologies have been a bit more muddled, with them being made only to then be walked back later via contradictory statements... and vice-versa. Similarly, the issue of teaching it within Japan is more irreugular than standard.

Yeah, in terms of shit the CCP *has* actually done, they do indeed seem to be coming around to supporting, or at least okaying, the Junta after remaining relatively aloof from this for the last few months. And Russia started backing them from a relatively early period. Sucks royally.
That's the good news, the bad news is that they've lost faith in any hope of peaceful mediation with the currently in-power junta and have openly declared they are now training militia's amongst their supporters for armed revolution when the time comes.
In more... mixed news, the National Unity Government for Myanmar has announced a new citizenship plan should they be returned to power.

I just checked the Floridan constitution and it’s provisions on vetoing and yeah, you still need the requisite 2/3rds.

> SECTION 8. Executive approval and veto.—
(a) Every bill passed by the legislature shall be presented to the governor for approval and shall become a law if the governor approves and signs it, or fails to veto it within seven consecutive days after presentation. If during that period or on the seventh day the legislature adjourns sine die or takes a recess of more than thirty days, the governor shall have fifteen consecutive days from the date of presentation to act on the bill. In all cases except general appropriation bills, the veto shall extend to the entire bill. The governor may veto any specific appropriation in a general appropriation bill, but may not veto any qualification or restriction without also vetoing the appropriation to which it relates.
(b) When a bill or any specific appropriation of a general appropriation bill has been vetoed, the governor shall transmit signed objections thereto to the house in which the bill originated if in session. If that house is not in session, the governor shall file them with the custodian of state records, who shall lay them before that house at its next regular or special session, whichever occurs first, and they shall be entered on its journal. If the originating house votes to re-enact a vetoed measure, whether in a regular or special session, and the other house does not consider or fails to re-enact the vetoed measure, no further consideration by either house at any subsequent session may be taken. If a vetoed measure is presented at a special session and the originating house does not consider it, the measure will be available for consideration at any intervening special session and until the end of the next regular session.
(c) If each house shall, by a two-thirds vote, re-enact the bill or reinstate the vetoed specific appropriation of a general appropriation bill, the vote of each member voting shall be entered on the respective journals, and the bill shall become law or the specific appropriation reinstated, the veto notwithstanding.

Eh, given the way the Republicans have deteriorated to raw knee-jerk populist reactionaryism based on nothing more than cultural warring, QAnon conspiracies, and the Cult of Trump, I'd be *very* surprised if they manage to rebrand themselves against in the future.
If the Republicans ever collapse, we can expect the party to split along those lines.
That's one of the growing divides within the democrats ATM. The Progressive/Socialist Wing is growing more and more dissatisfied with the Neoliberal Wings dominance of the party's policy platform.
Then I'd err on the side of caution and refrain.
Do you have any independent means of getting the information on whether they've gotten better?

"China" or even the "Chinese Government" is a complex series of interacting systems whose decision making process can't be boiled down to such reductionistic conclusions. I *have* to give China a lot of credit, because it's a major industrial, economic, and military power, which implies the existence of a society every bit as massively complex and intricate as that of the United States, Great Britain, Russia, France, Germany, India, or any other major power you care to name. Let's not try and pretend that Chinese actions are not present in many *other* global powers, either presently or in recent history, and in recognizing that thereby acknowledge that the reasons for Chinese actions are not somehow special or simplistic.
I've always found that to be the wrong way to think of it. It's not a question of intelligence, it's a question of the interaction between power, institutional "instincts", and both domestic and international structures and systems.
Great Powers gonna Great Power...
I don't have much hopes of that.
Are you talking about the climate summit a few days ago? Because that didn't produce any agreement at all..
How about Country Roads?
Yes, they are. We've only had a small proportion of safely vaccinated catch the virus and even in their cases, the symptoms were only mild instead of life-threatening.
Maybe. On the other hand, the existing vaccines do seem to be functioning well enough against the new strains.
1. Rather indisputable.
2. Not so indisputable. While there was some delay in them recognizing and admitting the seriousness of the situation (it took them two days from the initial WHO request for information), but they did admit things were serious and cooperated with the rest of the world before the virus got out of Wuhan and their response in terms of containment has generally been regarded as pretty good: too late in stopping the spread of the virus, but fast enough to seriously slow it's spread. The WHO itself notes that Chinese officials were informing and cooperating with them as early as January 3rd, 2020, resulting in the WHO's first published worldwide disease notification on January 5th. The first recorded case of Covid outside of China was on January 13th. (Note: this is per the official timeline on the WHO's own website).
3. Again, indisputable. If not exactly unique to China.
4. See 2. There was plenty of warning the virus was coming. Failure outside of China to prepare for it's spread is definitely not on the Chinese government, whatever their responsibility in acting too late to halt said spread outright.
5. The official Chinese government position is that the virus started in the Wuhan region as a result of zoonotic transmission. Unofficially, some of it's government officials have indulged in conspiracy-theory making in regard to the United States, likely as a response to conspiracy theorizing from some US government officials about it being a Chinese bio-weapon.
The problem for the government is if there's no holding force behind the commandos then all they can win are temporary victories. They need a regular army and a police that can remain in any territory they recapture, otherwise its just one long game of whack-a-mole.

Reports are that Taloqan has fallen, provincial capitol of Takhar. Local government forces are saying they surrendered the city to prevent it being destroyed by American B-52s like Lashkar Gah and Kunduz. That's a rather humanitarian sounding excuse.

The government's special defensive plan was apparently to concentrate on defending the ten largest cities, but that list includes Kunduz, which fell just as quickly as the smaller cities, so more words and talk without any reality to back it up. It does not, one should note, include Lashkar Gah. So good job sticking to the new plan, guys.

The government's kill claims are growing more and more frantic. They're up to claiming 500+ killed a day. If the Taliban are keeping any sort of accurate accounting (dubious), I wouldn't mind seeing it when this is over.

In any event, the government does still control the airports, so theoretically it could try to organize clearing operations to attempt to retake all the lost cities, but that's a LOT of real estate to clear now, and they're still stuck chipping away at the perimeter of Lashkar Gah. The government operational tempo is also way slower than that of the Taliban, so while they're preparing to attempt to retake this city or that the Taliban will be making their next four moves.

Usually, yes. I did say the risk of full-scale war is slight.
There is the risk, slight that it may be, that conflicting influence spheres could boil over.
Which wound up pissing off the aforementioned ethnic groups, who also dominated the military’s lower ranks. So they started deserting/surrendering en-masse.
Well, I’ve seen precious little to suggest the Ethiopians were trying to emulate China. The main trigger to the recent military collapse was trying to displace the military leadership and make it less dominated by the traditional ethnic groups.
“Fucked up” so badly they are only the second most powerful economy on earth and second or third most powerful military.
Which if China were interested in exporting it’s model, would mean more to me.
I doubt Sudan’s really on either side. They seem to be maintaining and mutually-profiting off of relations with both China and the west. Not so much Russia, but then the Russians seem about as uninterested in them as they are uninterested in Russia.
China’s been rather low-key with the Ethiopian conflict over the past year, but the Indian-Chinese conflict is as eternal as ever.
So basically more of what they’ve been doing for the last decade or two in Central Asia as is. Hardly see how that’s outside their ability.
As they have been since 2016 or so, so what?
That strikes me as misunderstanding what China is actually doing in Afghanistan. China’s interests thus far are indicated to start and stop at some mining and there’s zero indication they are interested in more then that or willing to do more than pay-off whoever can get them enough local security to work it.
That’s gonna be hard for them to pull off. The Afghans, Taliban included, are pretty sick of Pakistan messing around.
The Pakistanis Taliban are a completely separate organization from the Afghan one. And everybody hates them, including the Afghan Taliban.
Possibly, but unlikely under the current organizational structure. As it is right now, the Taliban are structured like the tribal confederation we should have set-up back in 2001/2002 rather than the centralized government. That’s not an absolute guarantee, but it does make it much less likely.
There was a civil war, in case you didn’t notice, the Taliban won.
One has to remember that the Afghan Taliban as it is today is a reborn entity. The organization was effectively destroyed in 2001-2002 and the remnants had to start over from scratch. Change, to whatever degree, is inevitable under such circumstances.
Evidence indicates that, yes, they’re still Sunni fundies. But not quite so much as they were in the 90s. Certainly not to ISIS levels (against whom they’ve been at war with since about 2016).
Pfft if you think the change was easy. It did, after all, take place during the course of a 20-year armed struggle against a vastly superior military force. The Taliban bled **a lot** to get fight their way back to where they are today and to suppose they didn’t learn much from all that bleeding strikes me as a folly.
It’s already happened. The in-roads they made in the Tajik-dominated north couldn’t have happened otherwise.
When western talking heads bemoan a lack of Afghan national identity more often than not what they're really complaining about is that the Afghan government lacks legitimacy as a representative of the Afghan nation. People will talk a lot about how Afghans are more loyal to tribe and clan than nation, but that's entirely practical. Your clan will look after you, the government will not. But a Popalzai or Ichakzai or Alikozai still sees themselves as an Afghan, even if they don't expect much from the government currently running Afghanistan. The Taliban themselves are absolutely Afghan nationalists. They just think they're the ones who deserve to be running things and not those puppets in Kabul. And the reason those puppets in Kabul couldn’t knock a working government together is because they're saddled with a fundamentally flawed constitution which mandates an unworkable system of government.
No, Afghan nationalists. They’ve long shed the mono focus on Pashto.
That’d be news to the Taliban, who are Afghan nationalists.
40% of the Dem house was against the war? I think you need to recheck your numbers: the Authorization for Use of Military Force (which served as the legal basis for the war in Afghanistan) passed the House with only *one* opposing vote out of 421 cast. The sole opposing vote was a democrat, but given that there were 212 democrat representatives, that's obviously nowhere near 40%. More like 00.5%.
I don't recall any such opposition to Afghanistan. I was quite alive back then and I don't recall the slightest peep of domestic opposition against Afghanistan, or any media smear campaign against such opposition. A definite uptick in Islamophobia though. Iraq, on the other hand? Yeah, sure. Plenty of marches and stuff against Iraq, with attendant smear campaigns against them. And later on, from 2004 onward, we got anti-war protests against Afghanistan too.
But in 2001? Barely anyone opposed it. In 2002/03, everybody was too focused on Iraq (whether for or against) to deal with Afghanistan.
Exactly. I may blame the Bush Administration for how they ran the war once they got into it, but I can hardly fault either them or the American legislative for starting it. After 9/11, there was simply no way the US were gonna be fine with just tossing in some air strikes and calling it a day. What Al-Qaeda did was simply too big for that to be considered an adequate response, even if it may have been the wiser reaction in hindsight.
You mean back in 2001?
I really can't see *anyone* opposing the initial invasion of Afghanistan, given what had just happened that September. How the war developed after that invasion though, the Senate had very little to do with.
What Biden does deserve blame for, and which he did accept responsibility for, was underestimating the speed of the collapse.
Even if the Taliban weren't there, say the Bush Administration had accepted it's surrender when they offered it in the winter of 2001/2002, then the country was en-route to another civil war within the government anyways. The Taliban just got there first.
Having listened to the speech, it's inaccurate to say he blamed Trump. He *did* blame the Afghan government and forces and well... he was right to do so. Thus the immediate cause of the collapse was a failed Afghan government, not the US withdrawal. But the root of THAT runs back to the fact that the government set-up under the Bonn Declaration in December 2001 was a totally inapt one for Afghanistan. Faced with the reality of conditions from that country, it rotted from the inside-out.
It is also worth keeping in mind the keeping in mind the Hazarite militia flipped to the Taliban.

Well, that is certainly in line with what I expect.
Sexism is rampant in Afghanistan, news at 11.
Because compliance and support are not the sorts of things which are “very obvious”. If we are operating off of resistance as a measure, then we have to ask ourselves how constant and widespread said resistance is.
Not to mention just as inconclusive.
If you have a better means of gleaning the overall mood of the Afghan people at large, then do share. I work with what I have.
Nobodies doing surveys, formal or otherwise, under these conditions. When it comes to Afghan public opinion, I have to operate off what I can glean from the overall impression of English speaking Afghans on Twitter.
Fact is, most Afghan’s have a lot of respect for Massoud (including the Taliban, in a “respect for my enemy” sorta way), but they see Saleh as crazy, while Abdullah Abdullah and Karzai are scorned as collaborators. And the less we say about their opinions of Ashraf Ghani the better.
In addition to a lot of spittle on the Taliban, he also heaps on scorn on the former Republic. And note that he doesn't mention Saleh once. Saleh is the former Vice President of Ashraf Ghani who has now declared himself President of the Republic in Ghani's absence. He's hiding out in Panjshir and making sweeping pronouncements of resistance. Yet Massoud doesn’t appear to even acknowledge his existence.
And there’s this interview with Massoud himself. Naturally there’s a lot of posturing on his part, but what’s just as interesting are the details of what he does and doesn’t say.
https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/asia/2021/08/19/panjshir-commander-ahmad-massoud-readies-for-war-while-negotiating-with-taliban/
Massoud may be collecting the detritus of the ANDSF, but what's going to trip him up is the logistics. Does Panjshir have the stockpiles to arm, bomb up and fuel these forces? For how long? Depending on what caches the Panjshiris have, this force they're gathering could be extremely brittle, with only enough ammunition and fuel for a brief period of resistance.
Because the Second Resistance? Contrary to your assertion, there’s plenty of objective factors to doubt Massoud’s willingness and ability to continue the fight (not so much Saleh’s willingness, but Saleh is a total non-factor without Massoud). Panjshir is a poor province with a small population, no resources and no access. That last is why it's so defensible, but it's also what makes running any sort of sustained offensive campaign out of there near impossible.
Your being “baited” into what is essentially a choice between the People’s Republic of Vietnam after the fall of Saigon (you know, when they were executing hundreds of thousands of suspected or real American collaborators) and the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot. Because that’s the closest comparable historical analogy we’ve got.
That’s not the question. The question is, in a fight between the Taliban and ISIS-K, who would you rather win? Which is the lesser evil?
Fine, even ***more*** psychopathic then. Because as bad as the Taliban are, they aren’t the *outright religious death cult* that ISIS is.
It’s quite possible.

ISIS-K is small right now, but it could very well grow. In addition to disaffected Taliban if their leadership keeps making more moderate noises, it could also gain a lot of recruits among the newly urban poor in the coming years.

Afghanistan's economy is built on donor aid and is due for an epic collapse regardless of how much the Taliban does or does not moderate. This will primarily affect the cities where standard of living is going to plummet. There's going to be a lot of radicalized city dwellers looking to blame everyone (the Taliban for invading, the Republic for falling, the Americans for betraying, the Pakistanis for supporting, women for acting uppity, Shi'ites for existing) who will be perfectly primed to join up with Daesh.

The coming insurgency could very much be driven not by by a bunch of pucky pakool wearing freedom fighters, but by a bunch of psychopaths who think the Taliban are softies.
Because that’s a very real possibility.
Query: what happens if ISIS becomes the prominent anti-Taliban resistance?
Then they have to deal with ISIS-K
Far more likely is that eventually the Taliban cuts a deal with Massoud that gives them what they both want: Massoud gets autonomy and the Taliban gets Massoud to stop fighting them.
Sounds more like wishful thinking then honest analysis.
I really don’t think that’s realistic.
“Taliban launch consultation to form inclusive government”
Cool. Even the Afghan government occasionally managed to recover districts before it fell apart. But I’ve seen little indication of Massoud having plans to march on Kabul and seat Saleh on the throne in the Arg. He's clearly focused on just making the Panjshir a dying ground to deter Taliban attack as long as possible, and maybe win himself some sort of autonomy deal.
Ah, I see the mention of the name, which I guess you take for a “route”.
He doesn’t route to anyone though? I’m not finding the replies you claim are there.
I’m not seeing any tweet from a Tahir Khan?

*shrug*
Most commentators are saying the Panjshiri resistance is mainly a negotiating tactic to buy those militias adequate autonomy and amnesty from Taliban authority. Make them seem too difficult to root out, so they concede them privileges instead in return for their cooperation.

The Taliban don't have many gears when dealing with protests, and all of them quickly lead to lethal force, so in acting as the protest's ringleader this young lady is extremely brave. I love that "get the fuck out of my way," hand wave she does at that onlooker crowding her.
Most references to rioting in Jalalabad I can find are over the flag protests.
Eh, if they get pissed off enough, they’ll flip right back out. That’s how Afghanistan works: allegiances are quite fluid.

I think North Korea does have less of an issue with organs of it’s government working at cross purposes with other organs of it’s government then Pakistan does.
Well, so long as Pakistan serves it’s purpose as a thorn in India’s side, the Chinese are liable to back them.
Not the most pleasant of alliances, but then China’s allied with North Korea. Dealing with annoying allies isn’t exactly new to them.
Wouldn’t be surprised if the Chinese just view it as the cost of doing business.

For any given Afghan on that list... 50/50.
It's a thing with extremists: there are the extremists, then there are the extremists who think the extremists are pussies.
Yeah, ISIS-K are a bag of dicks who think the Taliban are a buncha softies.

Saying they’ve outright just “banned” video games is something of an exaggeration from what I’ve seen. Apparently they’ve banned video gaming for certain time periods. Don’t know how they plan to enforce it, but it wouldn’t be the first law the central Chinese government has issued that promptly gets ignored at the provincial level for being unenforceable.

The Resistance still have the potential option to disperse, go to ground, and try for a full guerrilla war but that depends on how much appetite the Valley's elders and residents have for it.
Things not looking good in Panjshir.

Hemat, a pro-Taliban account, is reporting that Taliban artillery is now in range of Bazarak, the capital of Panjshir. A Resistance account partially confirms this, saying the Taliban have managed to move heavy guns up into the hills and are now turning the front lines into a meat grinder. Resistance 2.0 has been giving one of the more level headed accounts of the fighting from the resistance's perspective with an admirable lack of hyperbole, so if he's concerned for their position then things are likely looking grim.

Reading it, I was reminded of the "foresaken child" thought experiment. You know, the one which asks whether you'd condemn a child to indescribable undying torment in exchange for a global utopia of peace and prosperity for the rest of mankind for as long as the child is tortured. Except instead of one person, it's 70% of the country.
For once, an actually good article from the New Yorker. One which covers a vast sweep, focused on one woman's life from the Communist coup through the Soviet-Afghan War, the Afghan Civil War, the rise and fall of the Taliban, the American War, and then the final fall of the Republic. It's long, but if there's one article on Afghanistan you plan to read this week, that should be the one.

In particular, if you ever wanted to know why there are enough Afghans who supported the Taliban (or at least rejected the government), this would be the article to read. It also provides a counter point to the argument that we should have continued the war to preserve to social advances of the cities, by showing the very real human cost that the was having on the majority in the countryside.

Not to mention the Confederacy also faced partisan resistance from poor white draft dodgers who didn’t want to be conscripted to fight in some rich planter’s war.
The Red Queens Race is forever more...
Yeah. As a teacher myself, I can be sympathetic to the challenges in effectively disciplining unruly students.

But how the teacher in the article handles it clearly runs well beyond that and straight into verbal abuse.
But again, that doesn't really refute my point: it still does not make much ***pure*** economic sense to go to Taiwan's defense. Because in the short-term, simply sucking up the increased costs (or just buying from China) while rebuilding that capacity elsewhere is ultimately less expensive then eating 300+ thermonuclear warheads (or however many China has by the time this hypothetical war kicks off, given they've got a pretty big expansion program going on).
It's only when you move away from pure economics and incorporate things like politics, the dynamics of international competition in power, and (possibly) morality into the equation that a defense of Taiwan makes sense (or, likewise, an assault on Taiwan makes sense from China's perspective). But at that point, it's no longer just about the economics.
(Among other things.)
And there are additional pressures (like climate change, or social instability being set off by technology) that are closing in.
Fortunately there's a learning process on going. Unfortunately, it's slow.
We're talking something akin to taking a polar bear and dropping it in the Serengeti. Everything that bear has ever learned is suddenly pretty useless or actively harmful.
But the industrial revolution changed this, breaking the agricultural energy economy. It meant that while the ‘returns to capital’ (constructing new factories was a better economic improvement then improving land) were going wildly up, the costs of war were also increasing (more destructive wars not only meant greater losses, it also tended to devastate the very productive assets you were trying to seize), which mean that ‘returns to warfare’ were going down for the first time in history. But while the industrial economies meant total reinvention of the relation between economics and warfare, it didn't mean the total reinvention of the state. We still have all of these institutions, these social habits, these values, these works of literature and culture which were produced to help these societies survive in the environment of competitive militarism that existed before the industrial revolution.
This naturally produced a lot of very powerful incentives towards militarism in societies. Indeed, the state itself appears to have emerged as a stage in this competitive-militarism contest where the societies which were best at militarizing itself and coordinating those resources survived and aggregated new resources to themselves in conflict; everyone else could imitate or die (technically ‘or suffer state-extinction’, since most of the actual people being subjugated to the new states and later empires... the odd genocide aside).
If you ask me, the problem goes back to the fact that the primary mechanism of militant geopolitical interaction that is dominant in the modern world (that is, the state) evolved in pre-industrial societies over a period of some 6,000 years before the industrial revolution kicked off. Even the "modern" state developed more in the period between the end of the medieval-era and the kick off of the industrial revolution then the kick-off of the industrial revolution and today. And in the pre-industrial world, when the returns to returns to violent land acquisition were very, very high, the largest and most prosperous states tended to become the largest and most prosperous states through lots of warfare and they tended to stay that way through even more of it.
Are we so sure? Sometimes it isn't even necessarily about what each sides want so much as what just happens.
There's also little point in escalating "right up until war" in defense of Taiwan if one isn't willing to take that final leap *into* war to defend her. Otherwise, what you're doing is essentially trying a bluff written large and hoping the Chinese don't call you on it.
No, it's political and geostrategic.
Sure. But from a purely economic perspective, if China attacked Taiwan, it would still make more economic sense to accept the higher prices that the reduced supply from the destruction of factories (or accept just having to buy them from China) then risking thermonuclear war in fighting China over it. The reasons to defend Taiwan (and, on the flip-side, the reasons China might attack Taiwan) thus have little to do with economics.
They're hardly the only ones producing such chips.
I mean, Cypher has a point. Modern warfare between major developed powers has become so destructive and debilitating that the net economic effect ***is*** negative and disastrously so. Even before nukes entered the scene, that became apparent in WW1 where no less than *four* of the main belligerents economies totally imploded under the pressures of industrial warfare and another two were teetering dangerously close to the edge by the time the war ended. The global trade network didn't recover to pre-WW1 levels under the 1960s.
But the absolute object lesson of that catastrophe didn't do a thing to stop the sequel. The introduction of nuclear ordinance and more organized international bodies (like the UN) into the scene has added additional restrains on the geopolitical game of chicken, but it has not outright prevented it from being carried on.
They said that about WW1. The economic (and then the political) consequences of that were predicted right down to the T. Didn't stop it.
“Overall point is accurate, but he seems to fuck up many of the details” does seem to fit his videos quite well from what I’ve seen.

There’s also an economic factor: mining, especially coal mining, is a ***big*** industry in Australia. Toss into that the usual political clout fossil fuel industries has with most governments and you can see the issue.
Judging from the wording, the judge was convinced that the autism would 'cause him to monofocus on suicide as an option. The exact wording is:
> I accept that oppression as a bar to extradition requires a high threshold. I also accept that there is a strong public interest in giving effect to treaty obligations and that this is an important factor to have in mind. However, I am satisfied that, in these harsh conditions, Mr. Assange’s mental health would deteriorate causing him to commit suicide with the “single minded determination” of his autism spectrum disorder.
The ruling is covered in this court document:
https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/USA-v-Assange-judgment-040121.pdf
Not outside of his mental health.
Last I heard, the most recent ruling was made against extradition by a UK court on the basis they were concerned Assange might commit suicide rather than the legal accusations against him being bupkiss. But the rulings undergoing the appeals process right now, so who knows how that will turn out.
No, the question is wikileaks actual journalistic integrity. Which is deeply compromised by it's hypocritical attitude towards certain leaks, irresponsibility in reviewing what it is publishing leading to actual lives being put at risk (which is why Snowden was critiquing them in the first place), and the attempted propagation of several conspiracy theories.
That Snowden apparently hasn't taken more offense over that says better things about his character then it does about Wikileaks or Assange's.
It wasn't even a "Hmm... we'll try and review this and see if you have a point.", but just a reflexive "Fuck you, you're shilling for Clinton."
My problem isn't with what Snowden said of Wikileaks. It's how they replied to what is really a rather basic critique.
https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/758781081072046080?s=20
And when Snowden merely even *noted* their problems with curation, they accused him of trying to opportunistically trying to earn a pardon from Clinton.

Do you have any capacity to take them to court?
It... does not paint a good look for him.
Rather, he appears to have ranted about the media. Saying their reporting on the trial all wrong and complaining that they said he was "wrong" about a previous ruling of his in 2008 that was overturned by a higher court, insisting he was actually correct.
Hm... looking at actual news reports, he did rant, but not about Rome or lion eating them.
He has been arrested before, but for relatively more minor charges.
Fundamentally capitalism has always been restrained to a greater or lesser degree. We’re just tilting into a time where that restraint is lesser and thus we end up with a “purer” form of capitalism.
Their talking about finally pushing the Minuteman-IV out by the end of this decade or so. Since the Russians and Chinese are fielding new missiles.
It’s all been Minuteman IIIs. Warheads have undergone modernization and the missiles life extension services, but the designs have remained stagnant. It’ll still put a weapon on the other side of the planet in about 30-minutes though.
The best part is, the Pentagon already has that. It’s what ICBMs are for.
Because most places are like “Republic of X, Kingdom if Y, Zian Federation”...
Oh sure, I’m just sussing out what the official terminology would be.
So Republic of Taiwan then?
Actually, what do the pro-independence people plan to officially call the place of they manage to get full independence anyway?
Sure. And so does the Iroquiouse Confederation. The problem is they’re both numerically and politically too marginal to be recognized as the sole legitimate inhabitants.
Oh, that’s known. It’s just not regarded as relevant since that was centuries ago and the natives had mostly been either genocided or forcibly assimilated by the time the Opium Wars began to ‘cause the Qing Empire to come a part. You have about as much chance of having the international community recognizing the American Midwest as being part of the Iroquiouse Confederation.
Until you hit the security council and realize the core 5 permanent members veto means the whole thing is rigged.

> However, even after Moscow’s signing of the Founding Act in May 1997, large parts of the Russian political establishment—including President Yeltsin and many of his associates—remained worried about NATO’s eastern extension. This was reflected in Russia’s revised Na- tional Security Concept, which was published in December 1997. The Concept stated, “The prospect of NATO expansion to the East is un- acceptable to Russia since it represents a threat to its national security.” The Concept also argued that “NATO’s expansion to the East and its transformation into a dominant military-political force in Europe cre- ate the threat of a new split in the continent which would be extremely dangerous given the preservation in Europe of mobile strike groupings of troops and nuclear weapons.”
Eh... Yeltsin actually did protest NATO’s eastward expansion quite viciously. He was just ignored... which obviously did nothing to assuage Russian fears about exactly what the NATO expansion was for.

Well, "states" is probably an overgenerous term...
They've already got two collab states in place.
The range goes from "will get manhandled as badly as in 2014" too "has made improvements, but not enough to close the gap given Russian improvements" too "can make the Russians bleed, but will still ultimately lose" too "will be able to totally stop the Russians after some loss of territory".
Assessments of the capabilities of the Russian Military are pretty uniform ("may be a shadow of their Sovietselves, but still have rebuilt themselves into being pretty damn good"), but assessments of the capabilities Ukraine's armed forces are... rather all-over the place. There's no consistency, not even with assessments from Ukraine itself.
Indeed. But yeah, is pretty big news.
Well, no advantage for the Mosquitos at the very least...

> I don't think we should read too much into Niinistö's statement there. The context is his traditional new year's speech, and seen in its entirety, the message was mainly about criticism towards Russia's demands and its attempts to turn back clocks into a more dangerous past for smaller nations. Niinistö argues against returning to a time of "spheres of interest." His speech was an affirmation of the importance of the EU and NATO for Europe, and the desirability of a rules-based order for a country like Finland. You can interpret Niinistö as obliquely supporting Finnish NATO membership in the speech, but he is not exactly coming out with a clear message saying that Finland *should* join the organization. He is merely saying that seeking membership would be Finland's own decision.
> There have been some high-profile politicians arguing for NATO membership in late 2021. Petteri Orpo, the chairman of the main opposition party NCP, said that his party has for long supported NATO membership, and he challenged other parties to make their views public, too. Also the leaders of the parliamentary groups of the Greens and the Swedish People's Party have publicly argued for NATO membership recently. So the public discussion about the matter has been more lively now when Putin has been flexing his muscles. The parties on the left have not really weighed in, though. They are mostly among the current governing coalition, and seem to be too consumed by COVID issues to participate in NATO discussion right now.
> In October 2021, 26% of the Finns polled said that they supported NATO membership, while 40% said that they oppose it. Support for NATO membership has never gone above 30% in the last 20 years. The National Coalition Party is the only party where the majority (60%) support joining. Among the Swedish People's Party, support is 35%, and in all the other parties under a third would like Finland to join NATO. Every time Russia throws its weight around, support for NATO grows. But reaching 40% support, let alone 50%, seems a very difficult goal.
> If we interpret Niinistö's message as a sort of an opening for more political discussion about joining NATO in Finland, we need to remember that there is a long road ahead towards membership. You would need to convince at least two other major parties' leadership to start publicly supporting joining up, along with the NCP, to start generally improving support for NATO among the people. This is of course a risky proposition politically, as those leaders know that their voters are currently mainly against membership. In any case, a decision like NATO membership will not happen in Finland without a referendum (like with the EU), and thus you would need well over 45% of the voters to support membership in the polls to even seriously consider launching an official bid for membership.
Let me see...
A Finn actually explained to me that the debate there is much more complicated than that.

The rest of Europe will be fine.
The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement to that effect. But if they’re being truthful, it hasn’t been reflected in on the ground movements yet. To be fair, it would take a few days for most withdrawals to become apparent.
Recent Pentagon reports indicate Russian units have started to move to jump-off positions for the attack. Given the logistical and tactical issues involved, the Russians would only have moved their units there if they'd already decided this is going to happen.

I wouldn't be surprised to see sporadic fighting break out tonight or tomorrow, as the Russians push recon (UAVs and/or SOF/recon) along the planned assault corridors inside Ukraine (likely, they'll want to check soil conditions, etc).

OTOH, we would expect to see a massive opening offensive on the Intel, Social, and Cyber fronts, prior to the combat units stepping off. AFAIK, that hasn't shown up yet.
Not to mention the insurgency was not what ultimately beat South Vietnam. A conventional military assault by the North’s Forces did. The insurgency *did* weaken and sap the strength of the south so that it would be vulnerable to the northern offensives, but it still needed a regular military to finish the killing blow.
Mmm, ultimately that is the final test.
Assuming the proportion of the force is similar to the overall make up of the standing armed forces (at least as of March 2020), that would make something like 50-70K of them conscripts.
But everything I've heard is that the 150-200K forces currently fielded against Ukraine are from the standing Russian Armed Forces.
I haven't heard anything about the Russian Armed Forces calling up reservists, though you are right about the separatists, yes.
I haven't seen any estimate of what proportion of the Russian forces deployed against Ukraine are conscripts vs their volunteer/careerist personnel (generally referred too as "contractors").
It's pretty much a sure-fire thing. Biden's explicitly ruled out any direct intervention. From the perspective of cold-blooded geopolitics, the Russians are willing to bleed and die over Ukraine, Ukraine is willing to bleed and die over Ukraine, but the west is not willing to bleed and die over Ukraine.
It's... not exactly *that*, though I can see how one might take it that way.
So it begins. Well...
Always have two reactions to the news of such conflict. On the one hand, there is the academic interest in seeing how the developments in technology and society comes together to shape the battlefield. And on the other hand, there is the sadness of knowing the terror and horror that will be suffered by the ordinary person.
It sorta mirrors my philosophy about the nature of war, which is one part clausewitzian and one part cataclysmic.
For the state, war is politics through other means. For the people, war is catastrophe.
I heard he said it was created by Lenin?
Also, for the record: Ukraine is not a part of NATO or the EU. Poland is.
He’s not going to jump Poland. Just consolidating rule over Ukraine - even if successful - will be hard enough.
Yeah. It's information about a scam being peddled around Discord.
*Oh joy*...
That's good and could be important, maybe even decisive, if it comes to a prolonged, assymetric guerrilla insurgency. But there's little to suggest it'd have much impact on the performance of Russian troops out there in combat during this initial invasion. In symmetric high-intensity conflict, modern battlefield discipline and morale at the sharp end is usually more about small unit cohesion (primarily) and capacity of junior leadership to inspire confidence (secondarily) than anything else. Layered on top of that is the performance of the respective C4I systems and the leveraging of more technical characteristics, like firepower. It is the synthesis of these factors, on both sides, which will dictate how the invasion will unfold.
I poked around and apparently there's this, citing a sputnik news release:
https://egyptian-gazette.com/world/putin-calls-up-citizens-in-reserve-list-of-the-russian-army/
They coasted on a bunch of existing imperial ones, were drafting promising new legislation that would radically transform them or establish new ones, but then fucked up the management and were overthrown by the Bolsheviks. Who proceeded to take a bulldozer to ***everything***.
It's hard to really ultimately pin down the provisional governments final ideological form, since it was so short-lived that it never really had the time to establish lasting institutions or alter the existing ones.
Also, the war appears to be driving oil prices up a bit. Which is always a good thing for a petrostate like Russia.
I do think Russia is counting on the economic losses ultimately being temporary though. They've built a war chest of foreign currency reserves that'll last them until the next winter which will cushion the blow of any sanctions in the extreme short-term. They're obviously counting on the war being swift and decisive enough that by the time next winter rolls around, it'll be starting to fade from memory and the pressures of natural gas demand will pressure the Central and Western European nations start relaxing their enforcement of said sanctions.
In any case, the economic collapse suffered by Russia in 1917 had been ongoing for years by that point and would be connected to the direct physical effects of a war it was in the process of steadily losing, rather then sanctions.
It's also worth pointing out that the final *result* of that regime change - in the end - was a totalitarian communist regime even more inimitably hostile to the west than Tsarist Russia ever was.
The provisional government actually did it out of fear for a reactionary coup by the Tsarists.
It was the provisional government who armed the communists, not the Tsarists.
The historical performance of sanctions in affecting regime change has been quite poor.
Moving beyond the limits of that, on the other hand, raises the specter of two nuclear powers shooting at each other...
Deposing Putin and his regime? That'd practically *guarantee* a nuclear war.
Well, currently the limits of US willingness to intervene can be charitably summed up as "indirectly support Ukraine in it's struggle for it's sovereignty" and *un*charitably as "fight the Russians to the last Ukrainian".
Ah, teaching the controversy. One of the greatest plagued affecting modern journalism.
So if they are talking about, like, I dunno... bee’s in Papua New Guinean, you can probably be sure it’s actually decent.
If they’re talking about Ukraine on the other hand, flip over to another channel, because all you’re gonna get is the Kremlin’s line.
Russia Today’s honesty and objectivity is inversely proportionate to how much the Russian Government cares about what they are reporting on.

Ops like these would have been planned and prepped in advance. The Turks presence may simply not have been factored in. If captured, the Russians will probably send them and the aircraft back (though possibly not any supplies they were carrying). If any get caught in the crossfire... well, the Turks knew the risks when they sent their aircraft and personnel into what everyone was saying was an imminent war zone.
Oof. Best of luck to him, Aria.

The airborne strat bombers are undoubtedly lobbing cruise missiles at Ukraine.
Yep, somethings getting bombed there.
Oh shit, something big just exploded in Kharkov...
You're not wrong. Even a successful insurgency is liable to leave Ukraine ruined and unstable.
They've explicitly ruled out declaring war. But support? Sure. Time will tell how much it'll do.
It's official.

As an additional note, the Russian nuclear command and control network does have an override that gives the leadership the ability to remote launch (or abort launch) without the crews direct input.
Unknown. They were such a regular in the 70s and 80s that many such drills went unrecorded.
But when it comes to the people executing the launch... well, this is a regular practice in missile complexes. The wing/division commander can order a surprise drill where they disconnect a Launch Control Center from the complex network and give the crews pseudo-launch orders. The crews would have no way of knowing of knowing whether it was the real thing or just a drill until after the fact.

So far, they’ve reportedly turned the keys. Every time.
There’s been cases where people with the authority to give the launch order have said no in cases where it was unclear and instead recommended contacting higher authority.
No there haven’t?
I’m not surprised. Since the fall of the USSR, the Russians have never been hesitant allude to nuclear threats if it looked the slightest bit like military conflict with the west might break out. It’s their only offset to NATO’s (mainly the US’s) conventional superiority, an ironic reversal of the Cold War.
Indeed. But advances can be tracked fairly easily and the Russians have already seized bridgeheads over the D’niepr in their lunge from Crimea in the south, are in the process of encircling Kharkov in the center, and have a armored spearhead of unknown size running rampant northwest of Kiev in the north, with VDV air mobile assaults paving the way. Even absent concrete loss information, it does not paint a pretty military situation.
Reviewing military developments and taking it into an overall summary... well, it’s still very early but these signs aren't just concerning... they look to be catastrophic.

The Russians are moving ridiculously quickly, and its just early afternoon there. Still have another half of the day to go. Absolutely they're sustaining casualties, but the Russians don't aspire to the same kind of casualty-free warfare NATO does. Their primary directive is to do things swiftly, not safely, on the understanding that taking a few losses now in service to speed can mean a lot less losses later if you can knock the enemy out before he's properly prepared to fight back.

Ukrainians are already talking about moving right to guerilla resistance which is a long term problem for the Russians (and eventually the Ukrainian government as well), but in the short term it means conceding a lightning conventional victory to Russian forces.
Just that breakthrough near Zhitomir, though that’s more north-central. Otherwise details are scarce.

I doubt that. Otherwise we would’ve seen more such surrenders in other recent conflicts. It’s more feasible that this particular group had both the dissatisfaction and independence from higher authority (recon tends to operate somewhat further ahead of the main body for obvious reasons) to decide to give up.
Generally that behavior takes the form of non-action on the battlefield rather than surrender.
That sounds a bit more plausible.
Probably an exaggeration of a more localized surrender.
That’s the VDV lodgement at Antonov International.

Estimated minimum territorial changes since operations started. Keep in mind, these are conservative “best case for Ukraine” estimates.
They’re one short, assuming it’s true.
Kill claims are always suspect.
Though I haven’t seen any evidence that either side has had their command and control actually disrupted by cyber warfare.
Pretty much, yeah.
Yeah. The long and short of it is don’t go into the reactor’s basement and you should be fine.
That’d be beautiful.
Though that cyber counterattack is nice.
That’s a *very* rosy view of it.
No info on the rest of the government, but a bunch of Ukrainian IL-76 transports did cross the Polish border about an hour ago.
Last I heard, Zelensky is at an undisclosed location in Kiev. He's kept it secret, as he's concerned about a Russian hit squad.
Man, Ukraine's very lucky they crushed the group at the airport, else they'd have linked up with the north group by now.
And the Chernobyl thrust is only 20 miles from Ukraine instead of being held up south of the exclusion zone like we had been previously told.

What leapt out at me was the use of the term "occupied Sumy". That's an admission that Sumy fell. Which means all that stuff earlier about the Sumy defense line holding was bullshit and the Russians have basically overrun the entire oblast.
More confirmation of the advance from the Konotop/Sumy direction.
https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1497024504455139330?s=20&t=4VBW9GWdQ1DEeiiBUNgOYw

Huh... if true... Konotop is 73 kilometers inside Ukraine as-the-crow-flies, but not when one takes into account the road network. Given that it's just off the northeast-southwest M02 route, that would imply a Russian thrust from the northeast which has managed 115 kilometers, unless this force brokethrough or otherwise skirted around the fighting at Sumy, which would also imply an advance of 115 kilometers from the east...

So the reactor's containment is still okay. And the radiation release thus far is only what you'd get in a flight across the CONUS.
Reports are that an artillery shell hit a waste storage dump.
Alright, looks like Ukrainians managed to retake Antonov airport, for realz this time.
The translation is something like “"Active actions of the Armed Forces of #Ukraine did not allow to land the main forces of the enemy landing in Gostomel. The battle continues with the advanced group, which suffered losses after the fire".
There’s been some contradictory statements about that flying about. The latest Ukrainian language report I have is this:

Professor Bevereaux has his thoughts up. I don’t 100% agree with everything, but the vast bulk does seem right.
https://acoup.blog/2022/02/25/miscellanea-understanding-the-war-in-ukraine/
Not the medical/internal AARs. Those are written because Commanders need to know how strong their force still is so it can achieve further missions, how many replacements they need to get, what equipment has to be replaced. As far as loss estimates go, you can’t get any better. The thing is, since those are for internal reporting and not public consumption, they don’t tend to get released until *well* after a battle or war is over.
If a omniscient being walked up to me and handed me a loss estimate for an ongoing conflict, I’d still throw it in the trash. We won’t know what Russian losses actually are until medical and military AARs get published + declassified and who knows when that will happen.
They probably don’t exist.
For a given value of “stopped”...
Not normally a huge fan of the 2nd Amendment, but when the Russians are really coming? Yeah, I can see Poroshenko’s point.

Notable things:
-Kharkov seems to have held up well. The Russian attempts to bypass have been held for the moment.
-Chernihiv, on the other hand, looks like it’s gonna be snipped off by the thrust from Karnotopol. God speed to the 1st Tank Brigade.
-The thrust out of Crimea seems to be turning in a more northeasterly course. That suggests the Russians are trying to get into the rear of Ukrainian forces facing the separatists, probably in an attempt to unhinge them.

This both answers why the Russians haven’t dipped into their EW trove and how civies have been able to eavesdrop in on Russian milcomms so easily. Fair speculation in whether this is another manifestation of all the bad assumptions that went into this operation or a systemic shortage throughout the Russian military.

Well, at least enough intent to make a cost estimate...
It won’t be restored, sadly. There’s no point to restoring it.
Most accounts are that the aircrafts hanger was struck by errant artillery fire called in on forces nearby, which is what destroyed it. No firm agreement about whether it was Ukrainian or Russian artillery, but it was clearly not intentional.
No man rules alone. The possibility of a palace coup is not remotely high, but it *is* there.
I won't discount it, but it's as likely as any other piece of speculation at this point.
I don't think "commercialized" is the right word for it, I'll ask around and see what might work better, but I get what you're saying.
That's... a really good point.
That's been true since WW1. The costs vs benefits of war have ultimately changed little in that time. Though you are on the ball about the radical difference in the geo-social-political landscapes.
If the Winter War is anything to go by, the bloody-nose they gave him in the first few days may motivate Putin to tone-down the final peace deal.
They released a string of videos showing them carrying out A2G strikes with TB-2 Drones in the first few days of the war.
Given that we’ve seen no Ukrainian bombing attempts against the convoy in the two days since it was started, this suggests two possibilities:
1. Ukrainian air assets are more seriously degraded than advertised.
2. Russian air defense is able to cover the convoys, even if we’re not able to see it in the pictures provided.
Is it? Closest I can find is stuff which says things like...
> “[i]ntentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, science or charitable purposes, [or] historic monuments … provided they are not military objectives”
Which has a rather obvious loophole built right in there...
ISW February 28th Assessment. They clearly believe that the Russians have stopped fucking around and the pauses/slow downs we've seen recently are a result of them now concentrating for massive blows. They definitely have confirmed that Russian air operations have stepped up and they are beginning to make a concerted counter-air effort against Ukraine.

I suppose it's because western billionaires don't tend to wield *direct* political power like Russian ones do.
Oh, once he began the invasion? He's got basically no choice but to see it through to the end (at least in terms of the conventinal fighting) if he wants to have any hopes of surviving politically. I doubt he'll go nuclear, but rejiggering the Russian offensive from it's previous attempts at attacking with a light firepower footprint into bringing down the steel rain everywhere regardless of the collateral damage is definitely in the cards... and is what seems to be underway, based on the latest reports.
Reports are coming in that civilians with molotov cocktails tried to ambush a Russian column near Kherson, only this time the Russians responded with machine gun fire. 30 reported dead. There’s video footage, but it’s extreme content so I won’t link it.
India’s still lukewarm towards Russia after that incident at the Ukrainian border, but Zelinsky’s working on it.
To some degree. But at this point, conquest of Ukraine and her military are the only two things Russia could possibly salvage from this mess. Even if the former is a poisoned chalice and the latter physically hollow.
There’s some talk that his kills may be an amalgamation of all Ukrainian pilot kills so far in the war.
Speaking of which, Kherson seems to have fallen. Russian forces have been spotted securing the administrative center.

Military's, like many large military's, have a ton of inertia behind them and correcting faults can take awhile.
And now that those assumptions have been proven catastrophically wrong, they are scrambling to compensate and get in place everything that should have been in place when the war began.
That's been a constant theme with all reporting on the early stages of the Russian invasion. The "plan" seems to have been that Ukraine would just disintegrate, put up little or no resistance. Thus there was minimal provisioning for the forces to act like they would in combat or to have the logistical support to sustain combat operations.
Enjoy it while it lasts. Undoubtedly, fixing their comms issue is on the Russians List, but it'll be a bit until they are able to get the proper recalibrated radios out to everyone.
Mixed news from the front: Ukraine has launched a counterattack near Kiev that drove the Russians back a bit and retook Bucha, but appears to have stalled between it and the neighboring town of Vorzel. Unfortunately, the victory wasn’t cheap: pictures of Ukrainian losses in vehicles and personnel are circulating.
It was introduced by the LDP, unsurprisingly. They’re raving lions who make Putin look tame.

Eh, Lenin may not have possessed Stalin’s degree of murderous paranoia, but he was still a pragmatic communist fanatic who was perfectly willing to sacrifice lives in the name of The Revolution and so were many other Bolshevik leaders. There might be less atrocity, but there would still be atrocity.
There’s a low-key black joke running among the military intelligence community that what we’re seeing now is a “delayed Soviet Civil War”.
That’s only because the break-up of the USSR proceeded along the borders of the various SSRs.
The earlier report that Ukraine took Ivankiv hasn’t been corroborated...
Here’s hoping this is real.
They have plenty of tracked combat Vic’s - tanks, BMPs, certain AA vehicles - but operationally significant off-road movement is pointless if the wheeled logistics vehicles can’t follow.
Definitely applies to all their wheeled vehicles, yeah.
I am seeing some dispute over it, so it may be too early to pop the champagne yet...
Either that or they’ve been driven back across already...

In the case of Czechoslovakia, it was even a multi-national one, given that it invoked and involved the Warsaw Pact.
Also, the invasions of Hungary and Czechoslovakia were combined-arms affair, conducted by armor heavy formations.
It throws up a strawman about the VDV inserting via mass paradrop. But that's not how modern airborne insert any more.
Having studied Russian military doctrine, that thread is systemically wrong.
Though by all accounts, they were thrown in just as recklessely...
No, they're airborne troops. And like most airborne troops, that means they are light mechanized at most.
It certainly is running this tight-rope path right now.
It's a suspension, but not a cancellation. Could be the Chinese will just wait for the furor to die down and then resume.
Oh the bank thing?
In fact, the food shockwave in prices spells unfortunate things for countries in the MidEast and Africa...
Possibly, or they’ll just use the wheat exports that would’ve otherwise gone to the west.
In fact, between them and Ukraine, that’s a little over a quarter of global wheat supply.
Well, for Russia that just means they’ll reduce their exportation if wheat, since they also are a huge wheat exporter.
Now in a overland assault, where they are essentially being used as elite mechanized light infantry, they are generally supposed to be doing so while reinforced with armor and artillery from outside the unit for additional heavy firepower.
That's not what they are supposed to do. Air dropping on top of a defended position tends to be suicidal.
They are supposed to take the initial positions by virtue of them being undefended. They do need a certain amount of heavy armament to hold onto those positions until relieved by an overland thrust, but generally that is already factored into the unit.
They are all at least motorized.
"Pure infantry units" don't exist in the Russian Army.
I mean, it's not 100% wrong. A VDV battalion/regiment/brigade/division will naturally have less in the way of heavy armaments. That makes them unsuited for pitched battle compared to a motor-rifle formation. But that's because a VDV unit needs to be able to be delivered by helicopter or aircraft.

Stalin browbeat them into acceptance, naturally.
As did the Bulgarian one.
I recall that the Polish delegation actually tried to object at first.
No, I mean... Stalin actually explicitly ordered what would become the Warsaw Pact in a meeting around... 1951 I think to build-up their armies - and by extension their war industries - out of belief that the Korean War entailed a much greater risk of WW3 breaking out.
Oh, it's worse then that.

This is exactly what Russia’s counting on: that the sanctions will be a temporary thing and they can get back to business as usual in about a year. Fucking capitalism, man...
Oh, these *fuckers*...

It's pretty much guaranteed China will help them where it is completely sure it won't be caught and/or punished, like it does with North Korea. Outside of that tho? Vastly more iffy.
War does tend to have an accelerative affect on things...
Yeah, and some of these places are left overs of the old Soviet "biopreperat" program, which are kept going with foreign assistance because they are frankly too dangerous to allow to be shut down and rot away.
Britain is more of a theocracy than Israel, given that the Monarch is also the head of the Anglican Church.
Yeah, describing modern Israel as a theocracy is rather inapt. The state does not claim to rule on the behalf of the divine, but on the behalf of the Jewish people.
Frankly, the “possibility of nuclear war” bit only makes up a small fraction of his speech. His biggest worry is the impact of food and fuel prices on countries at risk of famine, since both Russia and Ukrainian agriculture and oil have been mostly removed from the global markets.
If you want to see a transcript of the UN GenSecs speech, well... here:

Anyways, news is coming in of a major Ukrainian counteroffensive. Here’s hoping it’s successful.
He is entertaining to watch though.
Well, I’ve already gone over the problems with it (I wonder if Lazerpig actually remembers the 2008 or 2014 wars), but I gotta say: the reasoning does not exactly impress me.
Ah... so that’s the “lazerpig loop”...
I don’t know who this Lazerpig is or why I should put more stock in them over the military histories and expertise I have read. Watching his “Putin’s Big Oof” video right now and right off the bat, his first factual claim was how Putin’s leadership “took Russia from a progressive economical powerhouse into something that has a higher rich/poor divide than most 3rd world countries.”

To which my response is “what the hell? When has Russia *ever* been a progressive economical powerhouse”? The closest you get to “progressive” is the brief Kerensky government and the closest you get to “economic powerhouse” is under the USSR just before stagnation kicked in. Both are ages *before* Putin and the situation in which he took charge can quite easily be described as “just as much of a clusterfuck as it is now. Only slightly somewhat less authoritarian.” The poor/rich divide? Actually was just as bad.

Such a massive error right off the bat doesn’t bode well for my impression of his factual accuracy.
But regardless, the basis for the pre-February 2022 Russian military rep wasn’t their equipment, but their actual observed prior performance in the past three wars and the trajectory there-of.
It was assumed they would at least be as good as they were in 2014.
Suffice to say, that rep is dead now. Reset to 1996...
I don’t buy that for an instance. We’ve seen Egyptians and Iraqis driving M1A2s fail just as horribly - and in practically the exact same way - as when they were driving T-72s.
And again: Ukraine’s using most of the exact same tanks.
The T-72 is only marginally older (Gen 2.5).
The T-80 and T-90 are as old designs as any MBT in NATO service (Gen 3s).
And between 1999-2014, that trajectory for the Russians seemed to be consistently going upwards. **That** was the source of their rep, their actual performance in recent wars, not some “forgetfulness”...
The problem was never the equipment. It’s the caliber of the men, leadership, and organization behind them.
Hell, most of Ukraine’s own armor is still modernized T-64s, T-72s, and T-80s.
Both Pakistan and India have used Soviet (or Soviet-derived) tank’s with notable success.
And Soviet backed North Koreans defeated the American-backed South Koreans and even the initial American forces sent to halt them before they ran up against the Pusan Perimeter.
Soviet-backed North Vietnam shredded the American-backed South whenever American combat power wasn’t directly involved.
Meanwhile, Soviet-equipped and trained Cubans performed usually credibly in their interventions in Africa during the 70s and 80s.
Case-in-point: First Arab Israelis War. No Soviet support for either side. Egyptians and Jordanians are British trained and equipped. Syrians and Lebanese are French. The Israelis still kicked their asses.
Then you look at all the other wars of non-Arabs vs Arabs, irrespective of whether their backers and equipment was Soviet and Western, and realize the types of equipment they are driving have nothing to do with it.
False. Syrians driving T-55/62s once beat Jordanians driving British Centurions.
It was quite the shock to analysts. After the collapse of the USSR, the First Chechen War made it obvious how much the Russian Army was but a shadow of it’s Soviet predecessor. But then from the Second Chechen War, to the 2008 War, to the 2014 Crimean Operation and Donbas intervention... in each war it seemed as if the Russian military was managing to get better and better. Sure, each op still showed notable flaws. But each time, there was noticeable and significant improvement.
Russian military reputation has already suffered terribly after the utter travesty they put on in the opening weeks of the invasion.
Though the regime they built did wind up lasting three years after they withdrew rather than a few months, so they got that one over on us.
The Soviets actually did pretty okay in the invasion part of invading Afghanistan.
The occupation? Not quite so much. Ran into all the same problems the US did.
Sounds about right. Anyway, I’mma be heading for bed. Be interesting to see how this Ukrainian counter-offensive develops. Hopefully it does well.
Quite. Lucky for him that.
I mean, to be fair to him, he does seem to be more addressing non-experts who do seem to get their impressions of Russian military strength from such shallowness as he describes (which are indeed mostly rediculious). But his reasons for proclaiming the Russian military has always sucked don’t strike me as very well-researched either. And the fact he’s apparently a propagator of the “T-34 is trash” counter-myth doesn’t endear me too him either.
... and here.

Woah, what the hell?!
Oh no, it's not Siege of Leningrad. It's worse. At least the Soviets were able to maintain contact - however tenous - with Leningrad via Lake Ladoga. But Mariupol is totally surrounded on all ground routes and the only alternate is completely blockaded by Russian control of the Sea of Azov.
In the mean time, Mariupol will probably be facing mass starvation by the end of this week.

Though the point of minefields is that they by themselves are not supposed to stop the enemy unless covered by fire. So there’s probably weaponry off-screen covering that section of roadway that we’re not seeing.

Those are AT mines. TM-62s to be specific.
Eh, it’s its a nice patch of open ground directly on the main Russian axis to Kyiv and otherwise well suited for use as an assembly area for military forces. Just happens to be a little radioactive.

We have a mountain of proof in this war that the Russian leadership doesn't give a shit about the welfare of their troops. This is just one more rock on the pile.
They also turned some of the site into a ammo depot.
Particularly when no one’s shooting at you.
That makes it look like both. Why not both?
That might be tougher, since Russia is now able to concentrate their combat power and logistical resources on that axis. As a case in point...

Good news from Ukraine!
Russian forces have withdrawn/been driven back from Kyiv in both directions. The siege of Kyiv is over.
And as she says, it's apparently being worked on...
Not *much*, admittedly. More of a "we should ask Melua about this" kinda thing.
Oh, ironic. There was some discussion among the writing team about that too...
The Russians blew that dam early in the invasion.
They did it well. Caught the helicopter loitering for targets. And if you pay attention, they keep the laser designator *just* off the helicopter until the last possible moment. That meant the pilot wouldn’t receive a warning that he’s being painted until it’s far too late.
From a military history perspective, the massacres are unsurprising given the callous treatment of and brutalized nature of Russian troops. Armies that abuse and beat recruits or junior soldiers in training and in peacetime will tend to abuse and murder civilians in occupied territory and in wartime. It's well documented that sort of violence rolls downhill. Soldiers who are abused by their superiors tend in turn to abuse their subordinates, both as a learned behavior but also as a transference mechanism (they repair the humiliation of receiving violence by inflicting it on someone even more powerless than them). The same thing happened to the Soviet, Japanese, and German armies in WW2 and there are no end to the instances throughout the pre-industrial period where armies that relied on brutalized discipline to keep their soldiers in line likewise conducted mass atrocities upon civilian populace when given the slightest opportunity too.

Morally bankrupt systems have a sad habit of perpetuating further moral bankruptcy.
Supposedly, they already did: Lieutenant Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov, commander of the 64th Independent Motor-Rifle Brigade has been IDed as the man who gave the order.
Drawn out on a map, this is a rough sketch of what they hope to accomplish:
Currently, Russia's massing for a major offensive in the Donbass. They hope to breakout of the Izyum bridgehead, encircle, and destroy Ukrainian forces east of Slavyansk. Such a victory would let them fully secure the Luhansk and Donetsk region. Presumably, if successful they'd then declare overall victory and a cease-fire along the current frontline. If they fail? We're not certain what they'll do then.
And would certainly 'cause an awkward and highly unpredictable situation.
It is distressingly possible.
That's dumb, since NATO forward deployed forces would mean that NATO would be retaliating by default as an act of self-defence.
There's a lot of uncertainties at the moment. Russian morale is pretty poor and their leadership has been dogshit, but the withdrawal from Kyiv and Chernihiv now means they can now concentrate combat power and logistics, instead of having it unsustainably spread too thin all over the country.
And there are Ukrainian options as well. In addition to possibly recieving and defeating the potential Russian thrust, they could also possibly attempt a spoiling attack of their own from the direction of Kharkiv. If they can breakthrough whatever flank guard the 1st Guards Tank Army has in that direction, they could threaten the Russians in Izyum with envelopment themselves.
He claims to have slammed out the first draft in the first two-and-a-half days after the idea first came too him. As in, he had the idea on Tuesday, immediately sat down to write it, and finished it on Friday.
Reportedly, he had studied the holocaust previously and taken classes on the subject, but he didn't do specific research for the novel.
No, it was a conscript. He had been told by a expert not to pick it up though.
It's a classic hanlon's razor situation where the intention and consequences between incompetence and malice are by this point something of a distinction without difference.
You'd think, but then a whole bunch of the troops deployed in the Chernobyl area were apparently ignorant as to the nature and history of the Chernobyl plant.
Most reports I'm getting is it was an errant tank round that found a storage tank. Still excessive carelessness with heavy weaponry around sensitive installations has been a staple of Russian operations thus far...
That should be a good enough overview. To get down to the bottom of it, it's probably Bill O'Reilly's fault.

For all people complain about bureaucracy, having a paper trail is important. That way, if someone tries to screw you over, you can go to a judge with a sheet of paper that proves you're right.

Yeah, technically those are warheads (or - to be more accurate - fissile material) that have been shifted outside the normal military channels for scientific reasons.
Of the 285 manufactured, 140 were in fact refurbished from older T-72 models.
The PT-91s are just Polish-modernized T-72s.
Basically down to what they can refurbish from reserve/storage stocks.
Just *against* a *different* group of people.
I mean, war does also require a group of people to work together.
It's naive to think the world can be perfect. It's not naive to think it can't be *better*.
I mean, yes and no.
You may be of that opinion, but the aggregate legal expertise of the international community does not and they are the ones who define these things.
In any case, in the specific example of cluster munitions, Ukraine is not a party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions (and neither is Russia... or the United States) and hence cannot legally be held in violation of it.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacta_sunt_servanda
Actually, if we're talking a strictly legal basis, no. As war crimes are a matter of international law, "pacta sunt servada" is in full effect. If the other side violates the rules of war first, you're in the legal clear to violate them yourself.
Actual war crimes, on the other hand, is a different matter.
Anyways, I do take the position that Ukraine is less responsible for collateral damage in *this* war - recognizing that "less responsible" is not the same as "not responsible" - simply because it's not a war they started.
A lot of people are able to express humanitarian scruples like this because western counties are still essentially at peace, usually ever engaging in limited wars of choice at the most. If they started a full-scale total war with a peer power, those scruples would erode *fast*.
You're being quite emotionally attached about this Matt.
Collateral damage is collateral. They aren't firing when there are no Russian troops there, like the Russians frequently do irrespective of whether there are Ukrainian troops in the area or not.
'Course you don't. You're not fighting a war of national survival against a stronger opponent.
In the end, responsibility for the war rests on Russia because they started it, and none of this objectionable shit would be necessary from either side if Putin had kept his hands off someone else's land.
Meh, in this case I can't really blame them. During the first few days of Russia doing suicidal thunder runs into Ukrainian cities, there was a video of a ruined Russian armored column in a devastated residential neighbourhood. It looks like the column was destroyed with artillery, which means the Ukrainians called down a massive barrage within one of their own towns and likely killed a number of their own civilians in the process. You can't be choosy about things like that when you're fighting a more powerful opponent, and the Ukrainian action is absolutely militarily understandable, but with both sides throwing around barrages of rocket arty, at least some of the damage was always going to be inflicted by the Ukrainians themselves.
Major Russian offensive in Donbas has commenced. Russian/Separatist forces have reportedly already taken Kremina and penetrated as far as Zarichne in what appears to be a recon-in-force before commencing with a massive preparatory barrage. Situation still developping.

*Shrug* Munitions expended on a decoy are munitions not expended on actual combat aircraft.
Because when there is *no* higher authority to enforce law, and there is no such higher authority in international law, that's what enforcement boils down too. Raw might.
But the whole idea is *supposed* to act as a deterrent to breaking the treaty in the first place. "You aren't cooperating with the rules? Well, now you don't get to complain that you aren't protected by them. Because you aren't."
Fundamentally... yes.
There's a difference between *legal* justification and *moral* justification.
Tons. It's the legal basis for the non-prosecution of the Soviet Union for it's war crimes against Germany in WW2, or the non-prosecution of Germany for Unrestricted Submarine Warfare.
It's not a principle *explicitly* enshrined in each and every treaty, because it is enshrined in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 26.
That's the *implication* of what it means. If a treaty is not being adhered too in good faith by one of the parties attendant too it, then the other parties are no longer bound by it in their dealings with that party. The *only* thing more fundamental than that is "jus cogens" (AKA: Peremptory norms) but that has *no* universal agreement.
I saw a three-second video on twitter, complete with some fireboat dudes shouting at each other in Russia, but can't find it any more.
Damn, sorry <@84811738653929472> , it was a dead-end.
I think I know a place to get a link.
"Killing each other" is a (part) of the *means* of war. The *purpose* is compellence.
Close.
I was unusually well-read on the subject even as a teen, so I got to take an elective course devoted to the subject.
The holocaust is more focused on in World History, however, and I haven't taught there as much.
I both took and taught American History - as well as substituted for a number of teachers - and depending on how various factors come together (ie: school schedule, length of school season, how many off-days there are, how quickly you make progress in the standards) you can have anything between a day to a week to devote to WW2 in high school over here.
Hmm... looks like it's the former. These are basically probing attacks writ-large:
https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1516908957322854403?s=20&t=Ht0dVTzIsgVE4YX1CxxfHA
That doesn't really fit. Unlike at Kiev, the Russians have solid GLOCs complete with rail transport and the narrowing of the front means they can concentrate assets. Reports of supply shortages among Russian frontline formations have dried up and the scale of the artillery bombardments being reported indicates they are getting plenty of ammo to shoot off. My guess is either they're still putting together the necessary coordination to attempt a larger attack or their morale is so abominable that their troops are rarely willing to press the attack against any resistance.
Though as a quick update on the conventional battlefront: Russia has managed to make some progress today, seizing some villages/towns and managing to contest others. Yet the offensives thus far have achieved no breakthroughs and still seem to be rather limited in scope, though whether that's because Russia lacks the capacity for larger assault or whether they are "shaping operations" remains unclear. Reports are that additional Russian forces are deploying into the area. No word on casualties for either side.
Yeah, western response to what Putin would do if he utilized a nuke in Ukraine is something of a grey zone right now. There's been common consensus that it would be "unacceptable", but what exactly would we *do* about it is anybody's guess.
>  never hear that shit directed towards a non-nuclear country by a nuclear armed country
Okay that is a clarification that wasn't in your initial statement. Though I will point out that Putin's threat is pretty clearly directed towards countries which are a part of NATO, which means even fighting non-nuclear members would likely draw in nuclear armed members.
That said, this is still historically incorrect. The US made "don't fight us or we will nuke you" into *national military doctrine* in the mid-1950s.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_retaliation
Of course, as a doctrine it ultimately turned out to be a complete failure for the extremely obvious reason that a disproportionate response could be politically or militarily unwise or unviable. That said, the basic threat (implicit or explicit) of "if you try to fight us, a nuclear power, you run the risk of being nuked" is the fundamental essence of nuclear deterrence.
Is this sarcasm or not?
The problem for Ukraine is that their own pushes flanks are threatened by Russian forces at Studenok to the west and Zelena Dolyna to the east, which means they can't concentrate the necessary forces for a continued push within the tip of the encirclement without potentially being cut off themselves.
No competent military would let an ATGM team get within a couple of hundred meters of your tanks, setup and destroy it, then walk away like that. All the redeployment and reorganization that's gone on for this new offensive and the Russians STILL don't get combined arms. The Javelin has a multi kilometer range specifically because its designers presumed you'd need that kind of range to be able to try and engage tanks from beyond their infantry screens.
Yeah, you can say that perhaps, but... just look at this:
https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1518283206814015490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1518283206814015490%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=
Probably a mix. While it is true that foreign aid and various other foibles mean Ukraine is confronting Russia on a more even military footing than might otherwise be apparent, the Russian performance has been plodding at best. We still haven’t seen them coordinate an attack on a single axis bigger than a battalion or two. To paraphrase Guderian, they keep poking rather than punching.
Yeah. Though there is the obvious caveat that these maps are imprecise.
So after a week of fighting the front in the Donbass is... not exactly *static*, but it's very close. On the northern wing, we've seen the Russians able to lurch forward 10 kilometers in a day here and there, only to come to a halt and try to do it again a few days later. The biggest single continuouous penetration has been something like 30 kilometers over the entire week. In the south, it's even worse for them: the deepest penetration was 10 kilometers in a *week*, which is credible enough for 1916, but not remotely so by modern standards. The bottom line remains a bunch of break ins to Ukrainian defenses, but no break*throughs*. Suffice to say, if the Russians want to actually pinch off the Severodonetsk salient - never mind clear it out - before May 9th, they are going to have to do a whole lot better a whole lot faster and it doesn't look like they have the wherewithal to do so.
But then again, it could just be he went "Hey, I can do this just with a loan."
I dunno. I guess I'm counting on the fact that he needed a loan to indicate his personal finances aren't great enough.
I mean, the deal does have to be approved by other shareholders and regulators... and I can see them arching their eyebrows at such financial details and going "Eh..."
So wait, if Elon accidentally bankrupts himself with this... what happens to Twitter?
Gotta rig those votes in favor of the Republicans.
Depends on how big the media circus is.
We'll see how well he's singing that "free speech" tune when people start raising the possibility he could be legally liable for the next attacks inspired by extremist twitter posting...
I don’t know if that’d be a good idea. What if his replacement’s competent?
Fair enough...
I mean, yeah. But the analogy kinda falls down when you get into the results...
Gonna have to hold off believing that fully until we get a more solid source, but WHEW the historical parrallels if true...
With all that in mind, having tank units where the tanks are crewed entirely by lieutenants *is* unusual and is generally a sign that something in either organization, personnel selection, command & control, or even just plain manpower availability is severely borked.
Western militaries generally have a CO starting at the Platoon level, assisted by a platoon NCO and a small platoon HQ section, with subordinate squads commanded by NCOs. In mechanized infantry, each squad technically includes the squad APC/IFV, with the platoon HQ likewise riding in a dedicated vehicle. Pure vehicle platoons (like tank platoons) have each individual vehicle substitute for a squad, so you have three tanks commanded by NCOs than a platoon command tank commanded by a CO.
The Russians - at least on paper - don’t do things that much differently. The main difference is since their NCO corps is so weak, they compensate by having fewer squads in a platoon, so the CO can keep better track of them all. This does mean a smaller platoon (and parent units) compared to a Western Force, but the Russians generally compensate by simply employing more platoons (and parent units).
13 years after 33... he would have been almost dead. I wonder if the nearness of mortality influenced him at all. Knowing your death is looming tends to change people’s perspectives.

Call it the fragmentation of globalisation...
I mean, we're starting to see a slow decoupling of the global economy. Not into autarky, per-say, but into a series of economic blocs defined by differing levels of free trade within blocs and a mix of protectionism and opposition between them.
Sure. And they didn’t also go meekly to their fates. Given their situation, it’s a totally understandable thing to do. I’m just noting that religious reasoning strikes me as totally ex-post-facto and ahistoric. One Jewish partisan leader, who wasn’t involved in the Uprising by virtue of location but nevertheless fought and died against the Germans, put it, “We are lost, but we must fight.”
Huh, that doesn’t really fit with history. The historical consensus, reinforced by the testimony of the small number of survivors (including the only surviving commander) effectively amounted to that they knew they were going to die regardless, so they decided to die fighting. That any did wind up surviving was pure fluke.
It’s called “Finlandization” for a reason...
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finlandization
Yes, but the majority of the Red Army remained Russian. The Officer Corps even more overwhelmingly so, and Russian was the language of the army’s command.
I mean, that’s kinda hard: given that Ukraine and Belarus were overrun in 1941, the bulk of the manpower and material which were the engines of the eventual Soviet reconquest of them and then subsequent victory by the drive into Germany came from the RSFSR primarily and the Caucasian-Central Asian Republics secondarily, even if those countries proportionally suffered more.
Eh... it’s kinda hard to avoid *some* Bolshevik insignia in what is fundamentally the celebration of the defeat of a Fascist power by the Soviet Union.
Yeah. Solid Ukrainian counterattack northward. If they manage to get a bridgehead over the Pecheniy Reservoir, they’ll also be threatening the Russian GLOCs too Izyum.
That’s the broad generalization I’ve derived from my impressions at least.
From my experience teaching, Twitter’s actually already well on the way out with Gen-Z, being viewed more how Millenials view Facebook. On the other hand, Tik-Tok is *all* the rage amongst them.
Then he should be fine.
Is he fully vaccinated?
Hopefully, if it is indeed anything akin to the Marshall Plan, it will be almost evenly split.
I wonder how much will be grants as opposed to loans...
Where is this idea that the Democrats have all three branches of government coming from? The Supreme Court is still dominated by hard Republicans, the Senate would be de-jure split if not for the Vice-Presidential Tie-Breaker and is de-facto split on account that several Democrat senators are too gutless to actually vote for anything that makes the Republicans angry, which really just leaves the House and the Presidency.
Ironic, given that the Russian Orthodox Church has schismed and every non-Russian Orthodox Church has denounced over the ROCs embrasure of toxic nationalism.
Ukrainians are talking about recovering all lost ground by mid-August and then retaking Crimea and the Donbass by October. Given the army they are reportedly mobilizing and the quantity of both captured Russian equipment and foreign weapons flowing end, they could very well do it. Unless Russia successfully mobilizes, and there are good reasons to think that they *can't* successfully mobilize, they're hosed in every conventional way. The lingering worry is if they escalate to either mass chemical employment or nuclear weapons, and on that... well, here be dragons.
If only I could remember more about it. <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
It wasn’t stereotypical per say, but still felt like a fascinating look into how a Japanese person views American society.
There was this manga I read like a decade back, which was drawn in western comic book style, about a teenage girl (whose secretly a ninja, of course) transferring to a high school to America.
No. Some problems we’re seeing in this war are actually rather recent: the collapse of Russian officer combat training dates too as recently as 2015[1]. Some *are* older and can date back as far as the 70s, but still haven’t always existed throughout the entirety of Russian history.

[1]Essentially, since 2015, the time of the Russian officers has been in increasingly absorbed by day to day administrative tasks, tasks that could be offloaded to Senior NCOs in a NATO army. Since Russia has few professional NCOs and what professional NCOs they do have are purely technical specialists and not leadership support, they can’t do that. This has come at the cost of actual *combat* training. This is made even worse since Russian junior officers also are entirely responsible for training the enlisted (where again in a NATO army, that responsibility can be shared with the professional NCOs). This means the failure to train the officers results in an entire generation of officers **and** soldiers who cannot fight for shit.
Those figures are kinda leaving out Ukrainian and Russian Heavy Guns like the 2S7, which has a base range of 23.3 miles with regular shells and a range of 35 miles with rocket-assisted rounds. Not to mention rocket artillery. But then that is also a bit of an apples to orange comparison given the comparison is between medium-caliber artillery, not heavy.
I poked around and yeah, it does seem somewhat country- and cultural- specific, with Islam providing more of a background justification depending on the community.
First I’ve heard of it.
Descriptive.
But it’s a blimp tho?
Wut?
The hilarious thing is that I almost did this with a writing prompt *last* week...
OH FU-
More workers/soldiers.
That is... oddly appropriate. One of the Autoscorers would be even more so, but yeah...
But then I get you’re trying to simplify.
Well, the one difference is that - unlike the Confederates - Taiwan does have it’s own historical claim to Mainland China that by now is just itself existing as a result of historical inertia.
That really just leaves the historical Chinese claims surrounding it as a motivation.
Economically, war between industrial powers - which is what Taiwan is even if it's not an industrial power - tends to result in the land being fought over devastated and all the industrial infrastructure that makes the land so valuable getting torn up. From an economic perspective, invading Taiwan gains China absolutely nothing even if we assume everyone remains totally neutral face.
I mean, at this point it's raw historical-nationalistic inertia.
Oh, *that’s* what he meant.
And yeah, nice.

Still only one day over here.
Lol, what? The period between the early-70s and the ascension of Gorbachev is known as the “era of stagnation” for a reason...
> butts handed to them by Japan.
Well, in 1905, yeah. But in 1939 and ‘45, it was rather a different story...
But plenty of artillery shells...
Though, frankly, given the state of their infantry and armor, that’s more of a crutch than it is an advantage.
Eh, *some* of the details track. The disproportionate difference in fire support rings consistent with many, many other reports. Complaints about tactical Ukrainian tactical missteps 'causing tactically unnecessary casualties are there, though the frequency is a lot lower than for the Russians. And for all the press the artillery shipments get, the numbers involved are operationally small and the advantages in terms of difference of equipment is drowned out by the quantitative mismatch. It's stuff Ukraine badly needs, no doubt about it... but they also need a lot more.
Hmm, true. Better hope you or your lawyer thinks of that.
Okay, it doesn't *technically* overturn Miranda. But it basically means there's no way to enforce it. Which - ya know - amounts to the same thing.
Summary: Guy was arrested after confessing but acquitted. He then sued because he hadn't been read his Miranda rights, which had previously been upheld under... well, ya know, Miranda v Arizona. Case made it's way to the SC and the SC ruled - today - that he had no standing to sue. In other words, the officer did nothing wrong by failing to inform the man of his rights. Which is what Miranda says you are supposed to do.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega_v._Tekoh#:~:text=Vega%20v.%20Tekoh%2C%20597%20U.S.,enforcement%20is%20a%20Constitutional%20right
https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21-499_gfbh.pdf
It's not even the worst of the new rulings. As of today, Miranda is effectively overturned. Now:

1. Police can lie to you (Frazier v Cupp, 1969)
2. They don't have to protect you (Warren v Dist of Columbia, 1981)
3. They don't have to know the law (Heien v North Carolina, 2014)
4. And now they don't have to inform you of your rights (Vega v Tekoh, 2022)
Clarence seems to think somewhat favorably of Taney. Which is more than a little fucking concerning.
Yup!
https://twitter.com/jaywillis/status/1540004192999264264?s=20&t=8lnEtmFE0yNEezgBV2Trow
So, not only did the Supreme Court effectively overturn Miranda, they also cited Dredd Scott to support their case in a ruling on gun law.
The Catholic Church actually for awhile ruled that witch hunters were actually heretics, as magical ("miraculous") powers could only be granted by God. Hence, an individual possessing such powers would be a saint, not a witch.
Unfortunately, given the lack of education and prevalence of superstition among the commoners, this was a constant uphill battle against those who lacked the literate - much less theological - education to understand the nuances of the argument. The church began to cave in the late-Medieval Ages and then things reached a head during the Protestant Reformation...

Not really. You have to keep in mind the times: not only did the founders envision a small standing military that in wartime would be supplemented by conscription of the citizens militia, but the US in the 18th century was a heavily rural country with a frontier where settler towns would need to defend (and “defend”) themselves from Natives, without assistance from outsiders. That didn’t mean guns were supposed to be freely available and used though and the amendment specifies a “A well regulated Militia” for that reason.
Depressingly, not that unusual by the mid-19th Century...
Yeah, the 19th Century reforms are more akin to those pushed by Peter or Catherine the Great or even Stalin: their embracement of modernization was all in the name of *enhancing* the power of the Russian state, not fundamentally changing it's nature and those bits which conflicted with their autocratic agenda were naturally always hacked out, often bloodily.
I’m given to understand that countries with judge-centric trial systems that are not corrupt and authoritarian tend to have a very rigorous professional ethos and internal review system set-up behind them.
Ah, staggered launches with some chaff. A classic.
No, no. It’s a Gacha statue. So you have to pay to get a glimpse of a statue of a random waifu. And odds are, it isn’t the one you want.
Then again, Ukraine could always use more defense/reconstruction funds…
Better than a Gacha statue, I guess…
Admittedly, that was for High School…
I’ve held a mock trial of Andrew Jackson.
Though it was more of a debate, with “Jackson” defending himself against his accusers.
He was also only just starting to reshift his main focus from political egalitarianism to economic egalitarianism, which probably would have gotten him tarred with scaremongering about socialism sooner or later.
Churchill would find modern Britain confusing and horrifying on a number of levels.
Lenin made a few neat contributions to Marxist theory, but the idea of the Revolutionary Vanguard sure turned out to be hot garbage.
There’s also a classic “probable cause” excuse.
Hmm… now would be time for another phone call from the Department of Defense, me thinks.

Just keep voting "yes" (or "no", if appropriate) on those too.
Admittedly, it'll just be to watch him do backflips as the other sharks close in. But it'll be entertaining.
You joke, but I actually wouldn’t be surprised if at least a large minority are essentially in self-denial or something…
Oh, in this case? Huh, yeah, I guess. Although given how they normally talk about it, you’d think they fear it. Then again, whose to say you can’t necessarily fetishize what you fear?
No, I think paranoia is actually pretty apt. The irrational idea that feminism, gender egalitarianism, and LGBTQ+ Rights would somehow result in CiS-males being *forced* into femininity is pretty paranoid.
If there’s any adjective in that I’d question, it’s really the “psychotic” part. At least for some of them.
I mean, sure, that isn’t what they mean. But it’s hard to deny that’s what it amounts too. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Psychotic paranoia by ultra-right-wing reactionaries and fascists, I’m guessing. Like “Cultural Marxism”.
Churchill was a lot of things, but he had no time for Neoliberalism… or any sort of domestic policy, really.
And if the US *did* suffer a large enough defeat that the draft was the only way to fill the manpower gap, it'd probably either call the war quits or break out the nukes, depending on how much the fight matter to it.
Having watched the first episode, I will say: it's more then "possible".
Catching up on Magia Record. Watching through episode 12 right now and was it just me, or did they reference that Monty Python parrot sketch?
I'm given to understand that it rather mixes the two wars together.
Yeah, they don't like the pro-fascist historical revisionist bent too it.
Oh boy. YS is controversial in the circles I frequent.
For the moment, it's a good change of pace.
I'm willing to bet in three-four years we'll be moaning about the new otome isekai plague, but yeah.
Like, there was one about... was it two seasons back? "Make My Abilities Average In My Next Life" or something like that...
Oh, I don't just mean otome villainesses.
I had a hard time finding anything about it at first. Turns out, I was using the wrong search terms. lol
ikr.
Oh, hey. That Otome Villainess LN/manga got an anime adaptation. It's always a bit odd how the gender dynamics of the isekai genre tend to make male MCs bland AF self-inserts whereas female MCs have a decent chance of winding up with actual personality.
Swap out Hibiki for the canon MC and we're good on that front.
Oh god, I remember when battle school animes were a huge thing.
And Katy's oblivious, of course.
Because they are being passive-aggressive as all get out at the moment.
You know what, screw gender-specific distinctions. I'm still calling it a catfight.
What's the term for a catfight when it's two guys doing it?
Uh...
Oh god. Cat-...
God knows, my list is otherwise rather threadbare.
So maybe I'll get around to giving it a shot this season.
But hey, it has Hibiki/Madoka as the MC
The arguments rage.
Yeah, that's the usual rejoinder I've heard.
I do understand it isn't the main focus.
But it still has a whole "valiant Germany holding out against eastern communist hordes and decadent western powers".
Rooting for Mary at the moment, inveterate yuri shipper that I am, but I'm sure I'll be torn by the other candidates.
She is.
Ah, I'll take it there then.
My bad.
Oh, it is?
And damn me if it doesn't look like my high school reunion.
They at a tea party right now.
> Tea parties?
I'm trying my hand at this live commentary thing of episode 2 of that villainess otome anime.
Although seeing my old Earth's science teacher was pretty good.
It was BORING.
God, tea parties look so much like my recent high school alumni reunion.
Thank you.
Hey, what chapter of the Machikado Mazoku manga should I start on if I've already seen the anime?
And Love Lab... well, it’s got a few undertones, but it definitely isn’t yuri.
And probably up your ally, since it has some pretty great heroic lesbians defeating on Totally-Not-Nazis.
Ah, okay. As a WW2 buff the latter part actually slightly annoyed me on that specific end, but otherwise I found it enjoyable.
Hrm... GR, have you seen Izetta?
> it's the gay in the 'this is definitely meant for male consumption' kind of gay
Yeah, that's fair. There are a few genuine emotional moments between the girls, but for the most part it's raw fanservice.
Mind you, this is a case where gay doesn't necessarily mean it's *good*...
> is Brave Witches gays?
It's a Strike Witch spin-off and Witches hence is hella gay.
Coming to be aware of what her own feelings for Miku actually are and what Miku's feelings for *her* actually are.
That's what the latter half of XV is about, when it comes to her character arc.
That's all the way back in season 1, and just because Hibiki is in love with Miku doesn't necessarily mean she's *aware* of it yet.
So what?
So... like... you would say "yes" but without a straight face?
"Kinda"?
Can you seriously still tell me, with a straight face, they'd *only* be "best friends" in that case?
The lines they exchange with each other are the same.
Miku still gets kidnapped twice, on one occasion getting installed with a Symphogear while on the other occasion getting possessed by God, and Hibiki saves him/her both times.
Their arguments and stuff are still the same. Their houselife is still the same.
They consciously decide to go to the same school together (just change Lydian to co-ed), sleep in the same bunk, take baths together, share food with each other.
The context is the same as in the show.
Let me put it this way, if one of the two were a guy and yet still acted the way they acted during the show... would you *still* have come to the conclusion they viewed each others as "best friends" or as "romantic love interest"?
*thwacks own head on table*
Like, *just* friends?
"She holds dear to her heart"
"I like to think of it as hibiki thinking about her as a friend"
*ahem*
You'd convince me more FireZero if not for the fact that you said...
I really only classify a show as "yuribait" if it teases yuri between two characters only to explicitly reject it with one of said characters.
Sweet, sweet admission!
Admission!
<:PraiseTikki:398808517139628042>
Heteronormativity is a hell of a drug, innit?
Because since Symphogear wasn't made with Bikky as a guy, we can't say for sure.
Of course, I'm allowing for the possibility that I'm being presumptuous.
Rather, I feel it would be the other way around. With you allowing for the possibility that the feelings are platonic, but initiatelly asserting you think her feelings are romantic.
But I rather doubt for a moment that if Hibiki was male, you'd still be saying the same thing.
And that's fine.
I mean, I get from your wording that you are permitting the possibility.
But you still don't think Hibiki loves Miku romantically?
Where she uses increasingly passionate versions of the term "I love you" in Japanese while singing about her relationship with Bikky.
Now Bikky wouldn't get that from Miku, because (as noted) we got her feelings for Bikky all the way back in her song from G.
What you would probably get is a "sorry, I appreciate you saving me and you are obviously a great friend, but I don't feel that way about you" in the aftermath.
> I would be slapped with a restraining order
Well, maybe not if you were in the middle of saving them from God like Bikky was.
It's the grammar of the way she says it.
Like I said earlier, she says "ubaitai", which is a romantic version of "ubau", "to take".
Language used, from what I've been informed.
Which is like... you know that if Bikki was a guy, it'd be like "okay, yeah, their a couple".
Even when it's explicitly romantic even by Japanese standards...
And for the record, BlackRaiden, I don't actually care as much as you seem to think I do. If I did, I'd be rather explicitly insulting FireZero instead of resorting to Preequal Memes and such.
<:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>
*A firestorm*!
<:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>
*The fury*!
He's arguing their platonic feelings.
It's outright text.
https://tenor.com/view/star-wars-then-you-are-lost-gif-13935229
THEN YOU ARE LOST!
Now seriously, <@202444817043685386>, are you going to with a straight face tell me they *just* think of each other as best friends in light of the above information?
"I... I want to take Miku for myself! Not to help other people! But because I want it!"

Now, the specific word Hibiki uses for "take" is "ubaitai", which is a *really* strong version of "ubau" which means "to take". It is used in a romantic context.
Essentially, Hibiki is proclaiming at that moment that she *does* love Miku and she *knows* it now.
And that culminates in Hibiki's line when Carol asks "what do you want?" in episode 13 of XV.
For reference Hanabi, the server has pronoun tags. If you're unsure of how to refer to someone on this server you should click their picture and check if they have such a tag. If not, then yeah I'd default to "they/their".
I'm assuming that's a typo.
Allie's a "she", Hanabi.
You are the first person I've ever seen to say something positive about it.
Huh...
Wait… you mean Netsuzou Trap?
Games, live action TV, cartoons.
It's not just anime.
The only times this doesn't apply is when one or the other is *incapable* of assisting, whether due to physical constraints (ie: Bikky has a Symphogear she can wield, Miku does not) or previous commitments (ie: Bikky has already committed to doing homework while Miku is cooking).
That idea, I find, is incredibly toxic. And I say this regardless of whether the "guy" and "girl" of the couple are actually male and female (respectively) or not.
Contrast that to most "ideals" of a couple where the "guy" does his set arrangement of chores while the "girl" does her own set.
Like, when we see Miku doing chores and Bikky's around, Bikky *helps Miku with the chores*.
Yet, I hold, is still ideal. I believe that egalitarianism in a relationship is important to it's health.
Of course, on one of those occasions, Miku also incidentally helps save Bikky, which is *much* less common in male-female relationships.
I dunno. On two occasions, Miku has to be rescued and Bikky does the rescuing.
That said, yeah I can see the script being written differently had Bikky been a guy.
Now you see the double-standard! And that's fine. *Awareness* is what I was aiming for as the goal of the discussion, not *convincing*.
No. But I still managed to find it entertaining. Probably because I’m a sucker for yuri-bait. Oddly, I found the panty-shots get more ignorable in the later seasons. Although whether that’s because the camera actually doesn’t focus on them as much or I just became inured to it still isn’t clear to me.
Pfft.
Oh, yeah. Barkhorn’s magic shtick is specifically super strength well beyond the standard stuff like “air resistance” and “hauling around munitions as big as we are”.
> These girls have to have a grip strength of literal steel to do this
Just getting into their Strikers does seem to give them a degree of superstrength. I remember seeing something like a "demonstration OVA" back when I ran through that series which explicitly shows this: Miyafuji gets into her Striker while two guys struggle to carry this big-ass machine cannon up to her, only for her to promptly hoist it up like it's nothing.
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
New season anime, time to go!
**Journey of Elaina**: Woah, that was some pretty good fight animation.
**Assault Lily:** Yuri in the title, yuri in the MCs name, yuri in the school name, yuri is the name of the megucas who fight the kaijus. Gee, I wonder if there'll be yuri in this show. <:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
**LoveLive Nijigasaki:** Interesting "fire"-themed visual, contrasts with the water/aquatic theme Aquors had. And it's about them joining trying to join and keep together an existent group rather then found one from scratch? One way to shake up the approach, I guess. And was the "Nagashi Somen club" an attempt at self-parody?
**Iwa Kakeru:** Got this confused with a different SoL girls club manga. Eh, whatev. There be some ***abs*** in this one. <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
The dramatic puyo/tetris-game-thing references got me to chuckle too.

Yet to Watch/Air:
Adachi and Shimamura
Strike Witches 3
But she doesn't seem to be putting all the pieces together.
She definitely has *some* idea that things are up. We get far more than enough indication of that.
Shimamura's density is more frustrating...
Yeah, but Adachi's gay panic is hilarious to watch.
Catching up on my shows and on Adachi and Shimamura: OH MAH GAAAWWWD! Shimamura you useless lesbian!
And I can't stop hearing Hibiki every time Aoi Yuuki speaks!
Saw the new spider isekai anime...
*He even calls it the Zone!*
Actually, looking into it, apparently the source material is Roadside Picnic. Which also inspired the STALKER series. So more parallel inspiration then a chain.
Otherside Picnic Episode 2: Halfway in and we've got a STALKER reference. Yeah, no matter what else happens I'm sold here.

And to believe, all it took was some surprise yuri.
I'm watching a gundam anime.
Whelp, it's finally happening.
I do find it amusing that episode 1 shifted to a "battle academy/school for the elite" setting that about 15 years ago would have felt horribly cliche, but in this day of the isekai plague manages to feel like a breath of fresh air. Especially with the Utena-Essie twist.
And sets up the asshole corpo villains pretty well as well.
The prologue was some neat political-military thriller machinations that also really illustrated the heartwrenching human costs of said machinations.
It's pretty good even besides the yuri, mind!
I have been waiting for a good mecha anime with a yuri-centric twist for awhile now.

Plus I have to appreciate Miorine's spunk as a love interest.
> Old traditions say I have to marry some asshole guy.
Fuck this, I'm gettin' out of here!
> Same traditions now say I gotta get married to this dorky, awkward redheaded girl.
Whelp, there's no bucking the old traditions. You gotta do what you gotta do.
And yes, it's fun.
Oh, I've seen that one.
What, no hope for a Hibimiku confession scene?
