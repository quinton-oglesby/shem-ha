Thank you very much!
XD I was referring to how much new people get scammed in comparison to other money making niches
XD yeh i understand, it can feel overwhelming. The community has very little security so people trying to make money often get scammed. It's a harsh place to be but I don't think it's saturated yet :(
Why?
