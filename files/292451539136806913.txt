No i want to rewatch it
Its been a while since ive seen it but i want to say yes
There are alot of girls that want him but it isnt the main focus of it so its kinda just there
It is but isnt a harem
It does the cliches right at least
I personally really enjoyed it waiting for the second season
Its lili and she is from danmachi
Pretty sure thats danmachi
where is the ruby art
I need more swimphogear jii in my life
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Yes it is my day got so much better now thank you <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
Legit listed to it less than hour ago and idk dam
i need to get better at convincing myself to actually go out instead of staying home all day]
i got a few things and thats it and my friends try to get me to stop doing them bc they dont like it
idk what i want to change
if i get one ill let you know
Pretty much any day after 3 bc i work till 6am and need to get some sleep
im aware but when it happened to me it was the beat up van with alot of ppl in it i understand that may be stereotyping
and they cant have it so they have no choice but ppl that do have it still get screwed over bc of it
alot do though
and costs legal citizens alot of money
one big problem with illegals though is if they get in to slight car accidents they will run and ppl get screwd over bc of it and its happened to me and really annoying to get things sorted
no make getting green cards till they can become fully legal easier so they can be here if there situation is that dire
if they are getting away from isis they are given asylum so its faster than that
1% still has way to much influence
thats never going to happen unfortunately
it would depend how much they owe
arrest them
but if they refuse to pay taxes what do you do then
and thats fine then
and they often dont pay taxes though bc of there jobs and the way they live here
you cant really compare the two laws though they are way to different
that would make things way worse
i guess my view is a little skewed bc of my family
compared to the bad atleast
you also dont hear about most of the good they do
im white and had issues with cops before but i still know they do more good
there are way more good cops than bad
i have had family that were cops and they were the good ones
yes there are bad cops out there but all the good they do is never shown compared to the bad that is alot less
my vote doesnt matter considering i live in ny which is a blue state
and has been for a while and doesnt look like its changing soon
im not blaming them its just i thought they were but that hasnt changed my view in anyway
it just seemed that way not trying to stereotype
im not its just what i thought
it might have been and ill never know bc i never saw them again i think they were and i may be wrong
neither did i im just wondering what was meant by convincing wien of anything
convince him of what changing his views?
its always going to be like that though
where has communism worked i honestly dont know
The last time i went to and from canada I didnt look like the photo on my passport they just look at it ask why youre going and that's it
thats messed up
my mom had done something similar when i told her i was trans but she stoped after about a week so hopefully your mom does the same for you
It could be worse so there's that
the only ive been able to stop being stuck in my head think of the worst possible case scenarios is put on a certain episode of love live or listening to certain songs so it might to try and find things like that to help
Yee I'm a first mate
yee
im on board
ive never seen it so sure why not
but ruby is doing her rubyest she is bestest
ruby is best
it just makes 7 total shows im watching at once
ill watch what you get up to a join for the next one
no i forgot to
ill be stuck at work till 1am bc i have to cover for someone<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
but google told me 7 and google never lies
no its 7 pm est
Pm*
I just looked it up it's 7am
Is that 1 est
yes dess
i noticed that you noticed the notice that has been noted
im ready to watch k-on now
give me like an hour
im playing some ow with a friend
shit
im actually watching 11 and need to catch up on 5 of them
Or any Thursday tbh
Yes
I would be able to Monday Tuesday and Thursday unless my friend surprises me with a visit and is staying at my house
Alright
I have work on Saturday till 8 est and think you are starting at 6
i am
any time works for me
Any time Tuesday and idk an exact time Thursday prob after 3 est
Tuesday and maybe Thursday if it's a little later in the day
I had watched it a few months ago and had no idea what it was going to be
It just ended
Put my times
they have team but it isnt the best and doesnt seem like they care to much
id be so happy if there was a hockey anime
now i want to go skate and its to late to
i can help im good at skating
i had a chance to live up in canada and play but got screwd over by a coach
thats the only kind of hockey i havent played
you use a ball or puck for street hockey
any type of hockey
get a ball and a stick and play in your backyard
you just find a team and play like any other sport
very true
You skipped the better one
First one
I could get an emulator and play them
Getting it in a few days just bought all the parts
What are some good jrpgs I could get on PC bc i finally got a good gaming PC and want to try and play some
I'm probably playing that first then lol
Thanks going to go look in all of them later
Both I just want some good games to play that I could get free or not to much bc I just spent basically all my money on the pc
I may be the only one but im looking forward to what bungie has to say about d2
She is gaining to much power
Yup she does
Kh.exe is not working keep breaking to fix
Im actually kinda mad especially since im a hunter
What
being forced to play fortnite
that would be some wonderful help
pls send help
yes actually
so ill be stuck for at least another hour
he is bad and bought the pass so he needs help so he doesnt waste his money
i can try but not now
i am its not fun
I dont have one i work from 1-6am and wake up whenever i wake up
Alright i need sleep so i can try and not sleep till 7pm again and actually do things today
<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
