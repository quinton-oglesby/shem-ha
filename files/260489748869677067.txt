Me looking at Rosalina when I was 7
Great way for me to remember
<:SaraWheeze_Dakudo:868996877977260052>
Make a keypad door where the code is HRT
Lmao
<:SaraWheeze_Dakudo:868996877977260052>
Bold of you to assume I look before turning it off
<:MizuShrugSmug:858839741059170354>
What if I just forget what it’s for.
<a:MikuBear:605209676224921630>
Right
Basically alarms notoriously don’t work
Cause I turn it off!
Uhhh
<a:MoriZoomLiquid:833902178217361439>
Real gods take pills without a liquid
<a:RainbowSnom:827000464322461716>
I need no tracker
Therefore
I never hiccup more than one day
No need
I’m staying with my dad which never happens so I don’t have my usual routine
np np
I’m just grateful to have accepting parents
Hey
<:SaraWheeze_Dakudo:868996877977260052>
I almost forgot to take mine today
Which reminds me
Hormones yummy though
Wacky
<:PhosBorgar:585988829635280916>
Pretty sure.
<:SaraWheeze_Dakudo:868996877977260052>
SRS kinda illegal under 18
What
Uhhhh
Given I didn’t know what trans even was till 12
I didn’t have myself figured out till 15
Far from it
It’s not though.
<:koroneHammer:724366259067813909>
You just need to hammer them in more thoroughly
Routines still work
Big bran
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Just make it something that reminds you of the meds and bam
That’s an example
But like
I know I know
And that’s where she lives lmao
<:PhosSeesQuack:581590357561573376>
I don’t really wanna live in a desert soooo
Cause affection recharges me.
Drained.
So I just am like
But not now.
Do I have plans of moving in with said person I mentioned earlier? Eventually.
Which is good.
Though I’ve never met somebody younger than 16 who has moved in with someone.
Correct.
I agree with calling it young, but I know others might not
Right.
Kinda an eesh
Though I know people younger than me that have surprisingly moved in together.
If you count 17 as young, yeah.
Anyways, that is all.
Cause when they go back home you just feel crushed till they come back.
Hate physical affection and attention from somebody that lives far away
Bein serious here for a second
Anyways
You were just straight gamin
Alas
Lmao
I guess so
But that’s a story for another day
The good ol’ flames sputterin out and shiz
Y’know
<:SaraWheeze_Dakudo:868996877977260052>
I can feel it.
I get to go through the great trial of life soon
<a:LOCKclap:775889645505740810>
Livin large
Sheeeesh
Oh.
Alright
<:SheraNom:861829981766942750>
<:SheraDaze:861829912482938890>
I think it’s a joke.
Well
That is a joke.
<:MizuSunglasses:868126087417323600>
Bold of you to assume I’ll live past 25
I supplement with an obnoxious amount of plushies
So obviously like any sane person
But her leaving was owie
That part was amazing.
I mean
It sucked being able to just be around her and even live together for a few days
But yeah
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
The details… I will not go into.
The other half drain
Half of the things I do irl recharge
Uhhh
We’ll be more in north
So if we do move in together
She likes where I live better anyways
