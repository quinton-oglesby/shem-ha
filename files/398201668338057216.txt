Yuri magic sounds amazing.
Hi. Even yur-hi, considering the username.
You shall be thanked nonetheless!
Yes, hello. ~

I'm not disappointed, overall. And I'm fine with the new trio. Whether or not the Custodians are relevant, appear, and are antagonists I think I can be satisfied. I think it's best to see how they do with what is in this season, rather than mourn what we want to be in. Perhaps we'll end up with things we didn't even know we wanted instead! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Though of course I can't expect Symphogear to execute that very well if that's what they're going for. <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
As much as I just expect more of the Symphogear we know... I find Elsa's bio interesting. Namely the "she desperately wants to change" part.
Maybe it's just me being desperate for a good arc, but I'd expect her to be used better than SG's team, who weren't given such a character-based motivation.
```Agematsu wrote down a bunch of ideas into a notebook. He gave this notebook to Kaneko and asked him to write a story. However, they only had 13 episodes to work with so Kaneko picked only some of those ideas to use. This included things like "a concert scene in episode 1 that gets attacked" and "a technique that puts the user near death and sometimes causes the MC to go crazy." Among the ideas that fell to the wayside were: "a team of 5 main characters", this was later picked up and used in G, when they created a team of 6. "Four emperor villains and a last boss", this was later picked up and used in GX with Carol and the Autoscorers. And finally a "beautiful form" which later became Adam's final form in AXZ. The only other ideas mentioned, but not yet adapted, are "a strange pet" and "a book of prophecy that relates to the mystery of the world." Will those appear in XV in some form? It seems likely.```That's super interesting. Strange pet could perhaps refer to Elsa.
I wouldn't be surprised if the direction/production didn't want any damage to the geah's group too, and that's where the lack of serious stakes comes from. A character being incapacited/killed/changed too much could make the ~~fans~~ consumers unhappy.
Some parts do feel like they're not even trying though.
So if an arc is terrible he is probably responsible to some extent. But the higher ups can probably make him split the screentime differently (meaning less time for characters who *need* development and attention, and maybe forced arcs to even have something to say about a character), or want this or that development to be kept for an episodic story (inevitably making it terrible).
I mean I'm pretty sure Kaneko still has a few plans of what he wants to do with the characters for instance, in broad strokes.
I don't think so either; writing from G onwards has been a team effort. Not sure to what extent though.
Symphogear's writing has changed way too much over time for a true culmination to be really possible, honestly. 
I think G's antagonists worked though, and better than in the following seasons too, but not agreeing is fair.
I mean, after beating an ancient priestress who tried to blow up the moon they went to clash with a monster, sub-par gears, and a mad but weak scientist, all of which were basically Fine's grunts. I think they can stand on their own rather than in the shadows of the previous season's baddies. 
The story they serve to tell can still be as great as any other. I don't expect them to be the final antagonists either, but I think even that could work.
**G-level hype and S1-tier arcs let's goooooooooo!** <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
If only. ;w;
So they can shine on their own.
Seeing the B-team trying to be useful and all in AXZ, I kinda hope Maria/Kirika/Shirabe will be the main ones fighting against the new Illuminati, while the original trio does their own thing.
Hype! <:Cag:423197445644615711>
I see. Cool. I should be able to sleep~
So... How long should it take to have the Crunchy episodes on nyaa?
It's happening. It's happening for real! <:Germain:421434126856486912> <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
When you love love someone you don't always need words. <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
||At the VERY LEAST there will be some non-explicit very cute Hibimiku moment, right?||
||Yes, we did. Now will she before the end of this season, who knows.||
||I mean it's a pretty important question that probably foreshadows what will happen. We knew she wouldn't ask her hey, want to go out? <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>||
||Music sensei is back and I'm happy about that, very happy.||
Also ||dammit Miku, don't say that stuff.||
That's a rather tough position to get. I think I prefer S1/GX as far as first eps go, but I'll be damned if that wasn't the Symphogear greatness I signed up for. <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
||Damn the transformations are cool!||
SYMPHOGEAR! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Well then.
I mean, maybe it's a copyright thing in America, and Crunchy can't say Megadeth. But if it's the same in the raws, I guess not.
Damn
Is it the same in the raws?
~~Megadeth is also the sound Megakirika makes.~~
Megadeth is a metal band, I believe.
Oh my
WAT
Behold, my poor editing skills.

[Cue Kirika being Kirika]
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
frozener
Well it's like a beam but huh
Anything goes when you "interfere with the laws of the universe via outer physics".
Yeah.
We shall gladly offer our bodies! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Gen is actually Enki, Fine really screwed up on that one. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Oooh yes.
Basa/TONY GLAZER duet. <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592> <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Yeah, plus mythology relevance.
Different armlet too.
Same layout, and same glyphs too.
That moment Batgirl kills the little girl (she kinda looked like the S1 girl, from memory, but I Symphogear isn't cruel enough for that) was wow. I wasn't expecting it. Now will they keep that tone for the rest of the season.
Fucking wretched anime.
That was a good episode. Lol at the curveball and having a concert in ep 2.
I didn't know I needed a concert so much.
FINE IN THE OP
Speaking of being fine
I was thinking this episode couldn't outgay the last one, but it was still pretty damn gay. Not gayer, but it's a strong followup.
Sooo sweet.
And now we see a reason why she is so good.
She is.
Chris is always adorable uwu
Also damn that pre-transformation pose.
The opening's intro was corny but super cool. Love that retro style.
Way darker.
Mmmmh, gimme moar.
If I had more faith in the staff I'd be over 9000 in hype. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Custodian, I love this season's start.
So do I. ❤
They were in the open last ep, but the corridors where Elsa was were dark! <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Well 2045 makes sense, considering the underused futuristic vibe. Mostly seen in S1.
Huh. <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Did they state the year before?
Nah, ep 3 should be less shocking. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I mean I read it as because of college. <:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
DMJii's pre-transformation pose and Maria this ep, date on a rainbow-colored ferris wheel last time.
Alright so the yuri teasing was great.
THE YURI TEASES
In Symphogear.
"STraight"
I mean, XV is already darker. Whether or not they stick to that tone.
Inb4 it was all planned and the girls were in time compression for decades. <:Cag:423197445644615711>
Now there's the possibility they spend half the season traumatizing the girls. :I
They seemed to be somewhat even with the Illuminati, so I doubt there will be an upgrade arc at this point.
So Apple is a song from her "homeland"? Or was that an unfortunate translation?
GX especially.
The eternal state of SYmphogear: not enough eps.
The staff for Xenosaga II changed a lot from the first entry, yeah. Soraya Saga, who was Testuya Takahashi's co-author was removed from the team at the time, and Takahashi himself stepped down from director, while another person wrote the actual script under Takahashi's blessings from the draft he and Soraya wrote. I doubt that was very easy, considering it got changed to a trilogy along the way.
(Also don't quote me on that but I don't think they managed to tell most of the story at all. Probably between a third and a half of it, I'd say.)
G-Beat isn't my favorite but I think it's the only instance of me liking an Ignited remix even more than the original song. Ignited G-Beat is FIRE. <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
It's a weird relationship.
I LOVE SYMPHOGEAR <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Darn, that's exciting and scary, the old channel description wasn't lying.
Even if they take our quality, they can never take our amazing first two XV eps. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
True that.
I mean, that's a highlight but the whole episode is really really good.
But yeah I think it will be better than GX. Better than AXZ even, probably, since that was already a step up from GX. May that trend continue.
Reminder that GX episode 1 was amazing! <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
I love XV so far but I can't help thinking about how they will screw up. I need to believe in the song in their hearts. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
It's scaryyyyy.
Tomorrow sounds more like Ar Tonelico than Symphogear and it's top tier Ar Tonelico. <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Chris' transformation was GREAT. Dat gunplay. ❤
"America is the obvious suspect,they meddled with us a few times already"
I like how Fujitaka says something like hey, I guess it's America
Also Akira mention. I'm a happy geah. Guy needed SOME update. <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
This episode was weaker than the previous two I feel but it was still pretty great. <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
CHRIS IS LOVE PRAISE HER
HOW
SHE FIRED IT
DAMN
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
*Large jiiii*
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Yep, destroyed in the finale of AXZ
GX/AXZ had Ignite, which was stronger I think, considering Bikki's remark.
The Rebuilt Gears seem more adaptable but less strong right out of the box.
Oh true that.
RED HOT BLAZE >:O
She did **revolver spinning**. That's all I needed. <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
It just felt... Complete? I think.
I'm willing to think Chris' was *otherwise* complete though, during the actual transformation.
Oh right
They all have it seems, Kiri's was just cut last ep.
||Also this blood stuff reminds me of LiNKER for FIS back in G.||
||Millaarc kinda got sandbagged there, but I'm willing to pin it on a lack of blood.||
We reached peak Symphogear, the rest is all wrap-up.
Right Max?!
I'm like 50% she'll obtain Shem-ah somehow. I don't think you can make a Gear without Fine, though. Pretty sure not.
"In my time we didn't need no Symphogear."
If they can't die for Japan they don't deserve Japan's glory. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
So I think in his head they should be honored to die for the sake of whatever plan he has.
And Fudo is definitely old-fashioned.
I mean, historically the Japanese have kinda been expendable for the sake of their cause.
I'm excited to see how the Fudo plotline will play out.
Even if Tsubasa deserves to score the kill.
Yeah, Fudo vs Gen would be AMAZING
OH
Dess tried her best but she can't match her senpai.
Chris' game was top tier today. <:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
We all wait for YT to sub it to watch the episode again.
(Which is unlikely.)
Yeah, as I recalled. And I'd think Fine is out, unless Shirabe has informations that can be extracted.
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaSpook:602224871585480776>
September 13th, 2044 should be a Tuesday.
tsubasa_irl
<:KirikaSpook:602224871585480776>
```Blooming in the maze, the crimson stone shines with a will to continue the fight.
In the brief moment before you are trampled underfoot, the feelings you strike upon carry deep meaning.```Eerie... <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
The preview seems very "Hibiki", what's with the title mentioning a flower and the use of "blooming". So yeah, I think we can believe in Aoi and keep a determination to watch.
In her current state she doesn't really deserve the symbolism of a transformation. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
The song was cool in AXZ but here it's a whole new level.
Man that duet.
It's perfect, thank Aoi-san, you were right.
Maria's transformation is great, her song kicks major ass, the whole later part, the ending.
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024> <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024> <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
OH MY GOD
If Basa doesn't want Bikki to befriend Millaarc well what did she expect.
Crimson something
IIRC it's a reference to something
I'm not sure she could've had a gentle fist if she really punched Vanessa.
Also Megadeath reverted back to Megadeth, huh? <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Hey Bikki's smile at the start was just as great.
Her new one was sick too. ❤
Just so beautiful with the light coming out of Airgetlham
Probably my favorite in the while show tbh
I LOOOOOOVE THIS MOVE
SHE DID HORIZON CANNON
ALSO
I don't even mind the boobs shot if we're going with the motherly symbolism of breasts. <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Man, XV is spoiling us...
Pretty great hensin, that being said. Lacked some mecha-sword display, but it was great.
I see, I see
Ah
Mmmh
She has, Naoto?
I can see Basa leading the fight against Fudou, if that happens and it's not the final fight.
Now we're talking. <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
I'm very interested to see how Vanessa will act from now on.
Why not? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
They both had big guns at some point? <:Cag:423197445644615711>
I doubt we'll see Preloli and mah grrl Cag.
I'm starting to think Kaneko is one of us and takes ideas from here.
Innit!
SYMPHOGEEEEEAR <:Germain:421434126856486912> <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Bark, bark!
Legit.
The last pillar man Araki forgot found his way into Symphogear.
```and they'll probably bait the jojo one with you know what```You could Saint's Corpse them in, but I mean, we got literal Fighting Gold last ep. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Apple ver. Vercingetorix!
APPLE IGNITED WHEN
APPLE IS GOOD <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
In ep 2 too. Though in ep 4, just imagine if they teased us with Basa's song before the mines exploded. <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
AXZ wasn't arc-y in general.
But really, I'm not sure I want Tsubasa to defect at all. Defecting "for real" I mean. That would kinda weaken her bit with Chris at the end of G, I feel, since that one was all about trusting Yukine that she really was still their friend. It could be interesting to see and no doubt nice from an action standpoint, but I don't want them to betray the spirit behind one my favorite things from G... <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Well. Two months to find out I guess.
Which... Well, I doubt he'd sing like that, so he'd have to fail for the duet to come later. ;w;
Though if she does defect I also hope Genjuro will go and get her back.
If she does defect I really hope for a duet. I've been wanting a SONG member-enemy duet for a while now. <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Did literally anything straight in Symphogear end well ever?
Yatsuhiro's biggest weakness is just that he's *terrible* at communication.
They will probably indulge in hand holding though.
Tragic but probably true.
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
It's a good name.
TL note: Sakimori is her. ^
Heck no!
>American bucks
Ahah!
(Translator's note: sakimori is a sentinel in this context.)
Defender'z? Surely, you mean a sakimori! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm pretty sure he would've been a true SAKIMORIsh SAKIMORI in... Another era. <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
It refers to a small group of soldiers that historically were deployed Idon'trememberwhere?
But not a TSURUGI. Smh.
Who knows, all the infrastructure damage may have killed someone.
Here's hoping it was her B-side. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Well, this season's been very strong henshin-wise. How wonderful.
But that, too. ^
Yeah the transformation was lit. <:Germain:421434126856486912>
||I *think* Elfnein could be considered expendable, but not letting her plotline go anywhere... Meh, I don't think they'd do that.||
Yeah. Either Tsubasa got a kill or Carol shenanigans.
Bikki said Yamete Tomete. 😮
^
I *can* see Millaarc being the one but the inspector is the easy way out and the writers seem to like easy ways out.
Especially with Hibiki shown just beside her at some point.
I missed the SoL
Well, for the whole thing really, but even more for that.
I'm excited for YT's release anyway, to see their take on the HibiMiku conversation.
"Brother Yatsuhiro" is awkward but that's... Huh...
Also, wtf Crunchy, Genjuro called Yatsuhiro "boss" in the subs when he said aniki.
It's a cover, but she probably does.
Yeah Melua, so sad. <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
A girl can hope.
Please be Elfnein's B-side.
(The moment she hits the ground with one foot being a prime example.)
Hibiki's transformation is the best for how her armor being created is in sync with her movements.
He probably did go die.
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
I get Jiiii, you get Jiiii, everyone gets Jiiii!
The Jiiii shot made me laugh. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Speaking of Kirika
The circle shot is fantastic.
Not Maria.
You can't just go suspecting him because it sounds correct.
Yeah, too, Fudou is still an influencial man.
Benefit of the doubt plus it's not always easy to doubt the man that raised you.
Heroes stay strong in adversity!
With Vanessa being a thing, can they Faust Robe Ver and make CyVer a reality? <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Though actually
In the catgirl utopia there are fountains of delicious strawberry jam.
After all, he's a hero, he shouldn't live long enough to become a villain. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I can see his arm playing a role, but the man himself I doubt it.
(Also maybe because running during the activation didn't mesh well with the heart part of the animation, which generally begins from a still position.)
Not that she'd necessarily fall, though.
Because it's shortened for airing.
I know you're doing bad things, Noble Red, but who can blame you when it's for this precious little face.
Elsa. <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
It is! Hopefully to many good things. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
It can't really be on S1's level in only one episode.
I don't know if I'd go that far. But it was good.
I think the entire world should be Kirika. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Not afraid to talk... Even if she doesn't understand.
Kiri is too courageous.
Literally.
You mean Millaarc killing people isn't for comedic effect? <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
I've seen that amount of blood from a nosebleed.
~~Imagine if they knew we'd think that and actually threw a curveball!~~
Darn, foiled again.
Well there is *one* sword.
Tsubasa: "I see the "I'm a cinnamon roll" note I sticked to her back is still there."
'Night! <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
... Sorry. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Crunchy's on a roll eh?
[Confused Japanese guy surprised that it's also for Maria.]
The avatar.
ProFile Pic?
Good night. <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
... Oh no.
But definitely a bit longer
*Maybe*
I'd say maybe not AXZ.
Bro? Surely you mean boss.
Symphogear is always too short. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Jiiiiii
Melua > The script wasn't written beforehand of course, but I'd think Kaneko had the basic elements done when they were working on AXZ. You're right that the philosophy is different, but that could well be due to the fact that the seasons are pretty different in nature (one being the last one and all that jazz, the other wrapping up some loose ends and setting up for the next one), or that Kaneko reworked and refined it over the years, since he had like three years. It's pretty possible the scenario for XV was mostly done and just needed a few tweaks, and to be actually scripted. 
The design work... Well who knows, they probably didn't have XV designed at the time but I wouldn't discount them designing some stuff in AXZ with the intention for it to be reused, at least.
Finitude is mean.
I don't want to say goodbye! <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
That was super cool Skully. <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
It's a spooky place. You could repurpose it as a haunted house.
Well, she was useful. Still took a fair few hits. Though they were justified, granted.
I thought Maria jobbing was a thing of the past, after episode 4, but...
>Ninja techniques that clone cars.
Ok, SYmphogear, you're good.
Remember when Tiki looked cool. <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Plus we don't know how it works, maybe Miku seeing Symphogears as impurities could make SSJ cleanse them.
Or any other thing we haven't seen coming.
Like, God could revoke the stain of the sin on her.
Well she has the sin *now*. In the last 4 eps they can pretty much pull every nonsense.
Should Maria call out to her?
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
After the Godbikki last season I can't be too excited for Godmiku, but there's no way Fudou stays put, so I'm looking forward to that.
I don't think she'll get a gear at all, plus maybe that'd be kinda redundant considering Maria already has a sword-whip.
I'm fine with no new song, really, let the A-sides leave their marks.
Yep.
No new song or arrangement this episode, right? How long has it been since that happened?
Also...
I did think about it when they showed Chris and Maria together before the episode aired, but it wasn't really possible.
Thing with CtF is that without Dainslef they can't Unison as well as before.
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I can see Tsubasa going rogue, but not really Tsubasa joining Fudou (or Noble Red).
YES
I'm thinking Fine is just in Enki's backstory this season.
That was a good moment yeah.
Have Fun Nougat. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Vambrace-chan wanted a sunshine. <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Was it a new arrangement, Melua? Though you're not wrong, I guess we didn't hear the Vambrace's version for that long last time.
Well in any case, we will see later on if it's anything important.
Keywords seem to go in this direction too
Also what Krika said
To repurpose it into a haunted house. 
We don't actually know, I believe. Probably nothing good.
Ogawa could scam people with fake car sales!
Get in the robot, Ogawa.
Mmh true.
Chris to the rescue, thankfully. <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
When the car fell I was like "OH NO"
I don't know Nikson, I feel if they really wanted to go there we would've had a few human casualties when she went bersek in episode 5. Episode 2 went much farther than I would have imagined, but Basa actually doing evil things as a result of all the things that happened would be going even farther. That'd be pretty interesting, though, who knows.
Well, I can *see* it, but I don't think the writing team would go that far.
If Tsubasa goes rogue (which I'd say is a possibility), I can see something unfortunate happening to Elsa because of her that breaks Millaarc's spirit.
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
Sure.
Maria ||in memory of the fallen.||
But she was already Bikki's goddess. <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
```WHY HAVE ONE KERRIK, WHEN YOU CAN HAVE MANY.```Wha? Weren't we already at the fifty-second one?
On another note. A small analysis/thoughts on the preview images, spoilered for whoever doesn't want to think about that too much before the episode.
||Thinking about it, the blue picture with Hibiki and Miku together could take place while one of them is unconscious in the healing bay thingy. The background is usually darker (though blue as well), but if Hibiki and Miku are together in there, I can see it being brighter like that. It'd explain Shirabe being back to the base (the mission ended, because of Hibiki being defeated or Miku being recovered) and Hibiki not being there (either out or by her wife's side).
I'm thinking it may be a mission failure there, considering Elsa is still in the Chateau in the last pic, and she could have been recovered by SONG had the mission succeeded, and if she wasn't, the Chateau probably wasn't the best place to return to... In fact, I could see the emergency call being from Noble Red, the Chateau raided by Fudou's forces. That's just speculation based on Elsa's fleeing-like stance, though.||
Also some Tsubamaria maybe considering the images.
I'm not expecting straight-up (... gay-up) romance but at least we should get some cute sweet moments. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
But anyway, only a few hours remain before the next episode. Aaaaah! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
I love just good ol' Symphogeah and try to keep my hopes in check, but part of me is still afraid to end the season thinking "well, that was it".
So next one will be the middle episode. That's scary because it means it doesn't have that much time left to wrap things up satisfyingly. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
Mostly noticeable when Garie talks in the elevator.
^
Not a happy episode for him, in general.
Yeah Hero, even Genjuro noticed there.
Ah, alright. Shame on me for not remember my favorite autoscorer well enough!
Her voice is GREAT.
Also I don't think Leiur talked in GX?
Well that was awesome.
out-oscorers. <:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
I'd say Garie-Vanessa is more or less even in normal circumstances.
Which was the worst Sorano, that or the arm chomping thing? <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Smh.
I caught it and it really made me shake my head at CR.
Underlings of Tony Glazer, all of them.
Elf seems to play more with her NerveGear these days though...
Fudou is pretty much forced to be beaten by songs at this point. SO Gen would have to sing if Basa is his sword.
"I sacrifice Elfnein on my field to summon Dark Mage Carol!"
GX
Yay. <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
The gentlest fists in the world could not kill their sunshine. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Is it more risky? I mean it doesn't have groping.
Will XV have the output of seven billion zesshou then?
But honestly if Tsubasa has to regress it's pretty good to remind us that Kanade existed.
You thought it was bait, but it was me, trauma.
The collective will of the server.
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Honestly, I doubt this is Carol, and would think it's more Elfnein with Carol's traits. Because no trans pride eyes.
So cuuuute.
she smol
"No copyright law in the universe is going to stop me!"
That's a possibility.
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
No mistaking it, there's only one and there will never be another. <:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
(Though granted, that could be just for style points.)
Who knows really. They did a closeup of the eyes, that seems quite deliberate and it wouldn't surprise me if they wanted the attentive viewer to catch an important information, such as who cliffhanger-chan is/who is in control.
```Why don't the eyes indicate carol```IIRC Carol has pink spots in her eyes. We get a closeup near the end of this episode, but her eyes are still Elfnein-colored. Not that it should be taken as stronger than other things indicating Carol, though.
I anything, the eyes do *not* indicate Carol.
This seems like a bizarre shape for pupils. https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/sites/consumer/files/2019-02/Mich-HeartAnatomy-01.jpg
This is a good look and I could fall for any girl with those eyes.
A billion mirror fragments... Zeno... Gias... 👁 👁
That would certainly be precious. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
What a sight to behold.
*Imagines Elfnein trying and realizing it's cool*
We did get a "kiseki datto" didn't we.
No. <:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
I didn't mind much the animations considering, well, they're broken.
Me too, and onscreen fights would've been sick, but... 13 episodes. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Dug too deep indeed. Moral of the story: no bulli. <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
But yeah, Vision Kanade is pretty possible.
Darn I'm jealous of everyone now.
(Being Maria is suffering.)
(A shame, isn't it?)
But Maria didn't know Kanade... <:KanadeSit:535301654464036884>
I mean, it's Senki Zesshou Symphogear. They have to think of some way to have a zesshou.
Datto, datto, datto.
Yes please.
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Elfnein would certainly praise her T-pose. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
"I like two things, genocide and papa. And I'm all out of papas."
Same. I liked her S1 arc, but I that was it. Lately though, I've noticed that hey, she really is as handsome as they say.
Fair point!
Underrated relationship though, they're both cute. <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Actually eluded me during the episode until I read zoid's reaction.
Oh no, the curse of balal got Bikki too. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
"There's no need to talk about the obvious outcome."
I mean, it's gayer.
Hibiki is the one who would REALLY need to be closer to the future, though.
What sword? I see only Kanade. <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I know the feeling.
Nanoha's great but the kind of great I don't want to finish, so that makes continuing it difficult. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Oh, I haven't seen S3.
Who's that?
Plus yeah his performance was great.
I mean, yes. I just like your average mad scientist.
Only as a *hero*? <:Ver:336656981144109066>
For different reasons though, of course.
I like them all. <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Carol's probably the most interesting villain in the series, as a concept. <:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
That's why it's the second-best night of the week.
It's funny because tomorrow is Carol's song.
Tomorrow we say tomorrow! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Fair. If one doesn't dream, why even sleep? <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Idols generally don't get to have a partner, and the girls kinda are fictional idols, I suppose.
That too.
I'm ok with not getting an official thing though. We all know they're super gay. <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Unless the season goes in a whole different direction towards the end, I really doubt it. So far Hibimiku has been "innocent", which is common in magical girl shows; and I'm not sure Hibiki has had much groundwork this season to have a theme of losing innocence, however, so I don't see that changing, meaning her relationship with Miku will heal, but stay relatively the same. That's my reasoning.
By that same logic, I could see Tsubasa getting an official romantic relationship, though. I'm not that big on TsubaMaria and while they did a better job at showing it this season than in the past, it's still kinda early I feel, though.

Or maybe I'm totally wrong in my analysis, which is very possible.
I doubt they'd officially become a couple though, but we know what's up and the team knows that we know.
As with most things it's good if they do it well and boring if they don't.
Great preview, I'm hyyyype! TOMORROW! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Also Hibimiku. <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
In other news. Happy omae we mou Fudou is best Fudou. That image is the best one we've had so far, I can say that confidently.
That's... An interesting preview. I'm really not one to think out loud, but I admit I let a "heh?" out when I saw the title. <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
Calendar: It's Saturday! <:Cag:423197445644615711>
<#431914167826382860>:
The absolute state of us all here.
The true fanservice.
```Noble Red's oversight began with a diminutive being, who once acted as a master, not willing to accept her death and shouting with the determination not to give up on living.```They used the magic phrase! <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
No moral.
As long as he doesn't have his Cane.
Nah, little schoolgirls are stronger than Ver.
Also surprised they're using FINAL COMMANDER now, it seemed to fit Tsubasa/Maria better.
Her new one is great.
Well that was great as always.
https://i.imgur.com/n7glim9.png
Fucking wretched anime.
Right?
Here, we could see a rare example of crushing superiority with no T-posing.
We needed this all along.
XV is too good to leave before it's finished.
Also Krika is right.
The lyrics seem to be more personal about Tsubasa and/or Maria, so I can see why using it for a group fight especially featuring Hibiki could be strange.
I mean
Also the cannon itself was fire.
Perfect.
Praise Nana.
Even making Miku get a transformation.
Yes.
Now if they don't run to SONG in hope to have some support, I don't know what could motivate them.
f
FUDO! <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
But yeah it was a biiiiiiit long. Like you get the docking for the start, no need to go overboard with it.
A bit sad about it too, I kinda expected an attack card or something, but hey, it's hype, it's cool, can't complain.
Now I'm wondering if we'll actually get a Gungnir datto.
Also also also, Dur da Bla datto. <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
^
(Better execution is debatable. FIS had all its members relevant in vastly different ways, but I can see the sentiment.)
Shem-Ha could be emulating it maybe.
Didn't Vanessa have Shen Shou Jing on a screen?
*Probably.*
To be fair, the last episode and maybe the penultimate one probably won't leave us with these huge punches.
Not sure Elfnein has any relic to work with.
Hence, don't worry.
I'd think if Miku wasn't coming back or not for real, that credit montage would've been after a real parting.
Honestly, my favorite part may be the neck. It's weirdly attractive. <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Yes.
Kaneko wrote JRPGs. Why do JRPGs and weird pants always go hand in hand?!
"Hibiki doesn't deserve this"
Characters getting things they deserve are only good in final episodes.
Bless Nana!
Like it's probably my favorite Bikki song.
ALL LOVES BLAZING is really really good.
Meh, I regularly listen to ignited G-Beat, the album version.
Otherwise yeah, I'm satisfied Ignite got the boot.
Ignite G-Beat is amazing. I'd say that's the only time the remix turns out to be better than the original, Hibiki's singing is *wild* in that song.
Bikki > Basa > Jiii > Chris > Maria > Dess for me.
But real talk, yeah, don't bring back anyone who is supposed to be dead. Carol and the Autoscorers were alright, but more would be forced.
Inb4 Ai no tame is Ver's attack card. <:Ver:336656981144109066>
The same could be true of Shem-Ha, but stronger because divine shenanigans.
But yeah, that's possible Ariathan. Apparently Gungnir had some sort of will too, back then.
Well it's just a spare body of Carol's that she and Elfnein are using, right? Shouldn't be too difficult to alchemy it a bit to get the voice right.
We must all channel the memories of Hibimiku and create phonic gain for Hibiki. <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
*If you dare tread in the ending.*
Incorrect, this smile is at the very end of our latest episode.
The warmest smile in the world. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
When is the SS Hibimiku sailing, captain?!
Crunchyroll, Commie are using more accurate translations than you.
~~You're right, I should've said "girlfriend(s)". 👀~~
That's just science.
When you have a cold it's 78% more likely that your girlfriend will have a nice fluffy moment with you.
I mean
Even next to your sunshine?
True enough wfc. We all know how it goes.
Miku is pure though, pure enough to be a vessel to God.
I would ask why since Shem-Ha already has divine power, but... Symphogear could bs a reason.
Plus we need to make the moon relevant, and Shem-Ha ain't on there.
Shem-Ha is too good not to use the next cliffhanger for it, but beyond that, you can't do much else with it I think.
Yeah probably not.
Mix the Custodian exposition with the final battle.
One episode and a half of Shem-Ha, half an episode to prepare for the final part, one and a half of final conflict with twists and turns, one of exposition about the Custodians, one half for the epilogue.
And if, as fans hope, Hibiki's hand manages to reach Shem-Ha, that's probably not how they'd end the season.
He seems set on leaving Hibiki be dealt with by Shem-Ha.
Yeah I think so too.
Gen has so many red flags you could mistake him for the USSR.
The lyrics of FINAL COMMANDER are talking about being left alone, so unless Maria bites the dust for... Some reason, it's a strong possibility Tsubasa would have to recover her will to fight after having Genjuro killed by Fudou. Also, they teased Gen fighting in ep 1, can they let it be forgotten?
Gen dies vs Fudou is... Likely, I'd say.
But still, that's unlikely if you ask me.
That's true. She basically can't survive if Miku dies because no normal life to come back to. But Miku has no such problem with remaining without Bikki.
Killing off Miku isn't the same as putting out one more character CD.
Ergo, Miku will come back, and not disappear again.
And now that they did it, I don't think they'd reuse it again.
They would never do that montage thing at the end without a proper goodbye if it was definitive.
The SS Hibimiku is unsinkable, though! <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
It was a general you, but if you like girls I do wish you to have cute and sweet girlfriend(s)! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
But if they actually bring back Durandal I'm throwing a fit, that'd be terrible.
That's super cool solopy.
Kanade was vanilla SG-r03
(Because season 1 didn't exist I suppose.)
The amalgam fists are an armed gear according to keywords, IIRC.
The main writer.
Since apparently complete relics can mutually destroy each other, Dur da Bla vs Shem-Ha?
I'm thinking the whole Shem-Ha situation is too good not to get another cliffhanger out of it.
I wonder if they have some big surprise this episode like they've had in the previous ones.
AAAAAAAAAAAH
HIBIKI IS
Speaking of Fudou, is he ok? o_o
So many opinions to be had.
Considering the sheer shock of the crew as Fudou is grinning, but the fact Basa is still into her fight, I'd say it's just Basa changing sides... *At least on the screenshots.*
Yeah, either Basa joins Fudou for good or Gen dies. Or both?
TOMORROW! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
It's not scaryyyyyyy
They either make it a definitely great season or an ultimately disappointing one next ep, guys.
Between that and the happy omae wa mou.
Is it just me or is preview Fudou really on fire lately?
At least it looks like the backgrounds of the two pcis could easily be the same location.
Relatively gray, lacking environment so that we focus on the actors.
Regarding that solopy, the background on Fudou's picture may imply that he is indeed against his father.
Fudou has to look happy for a reason. <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
And die. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
The SONG crew is precisely wtf. <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Payback for the sword-stopping move on S1E3! <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
Tsubasa vs Genjuro. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Wow. I'm so curious about that Millhi.
I usually defend Akira in GX but yeah, do this better this time, plz Kaneko.
Let's go.
I believe in Akira.
I know of someone who had "Topdad doesn't return" in his bingo board. <:Ver:336656981144109066>
The sites I'm seeing only propose longwinded descriptions, which can be good but not always preferred.
Where did you get those tarot keywords by the way, solo?
Though I must say, a game of "make it fit somehow" can be fun. ~
Yeah. I just meant it probably wasn't a direct reference... Though it would be neat if it was! <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
~~Especially the lovers.~~ <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
I mean, you can read any tarot card and it fits in some way.
"Tai chi is good for healing lethal blows."
He dies and it motivates Tsubasa to come back to SONG's side.
Don't we all love the Kaneko explanations.
I'm expecting something nice actually. <:Ver:336656981144109066>
... Thinking about it, it's in line with the themes of Symphogear that moonrunes prevent the peasant weeb from understanding stuff. <:Ver:336656981144109066>
I see moonrunes, only moonrunes.
The Carol keyword seems cool from what you say Millhi. I think it lines up with what I figured, but assurance is good.
Kirika: MOM SAID IT'S MY TURN ON YOUR WIFE

Shirabe: WTF? <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Use your lives as shields! <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
If we didn't already.
Well at least we know that'll be adressed somehow.
A riddle would've been amusing. <:Ver:336656981144109066>
I mean
SUCCEED! <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Arigato. <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
(Nastassja is just villainous on a more personal level, while Germain was using faceless strangers. I like stuff like that being personal among named character! <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>)
Same reason I like Germain. <:Germain:421434126856486912>
I like grey-ish characters. (Her appearence in AXZ was pretty... A thing, though...)
I like FIS better as well. NR's cast is pretty solid, but Nastassja is one of my favorite characters in the series and I like that all FIS members had a purpose further than being part of a larger group.
Aww good AK. ~
I mean, giving the time of day to people who did awful things is what Symphogear has been doing since season 1.
I think Kaneko of all people know that.
Also I do think he'll end up doing a genuinely good thing, in GX he showed Hibiki he could be redeemed, now is the time to show the redemption.
So they probably will be.
They just know they have to be careful.
I have zero faith usually, but for topdad, I have faith.
Like it's dumb but
I genuinely think they won't, for once.
Well gotta go for now. Have fun everyone. Don't die of hype. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Tomorrow? <:Germain:421434126856486912>
"Local girls die of zesshou."
Fair.
At its core it's a concert song, so I don't know.
I mean
But then again, I don't know if they could even have a group song without Gungnir to connect them.
~~I still think it would've been better than FINAL COMMANDER in the last episode, skip Bikki's parts at the start and sync it so that she sings her refrain the moment she appears.~~
It's daaaaaaaamn great. <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
~~Actually probably just the magazine thingie with a code for it.~~
Secret networks of ninjas.
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
But finishing Geah... <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
It's hard to make me cry.
But yeah, Vanessa is alive, certainly.
It was quite a shock.
That... That was great!
IT'S FLIPPIN GREAT
I've seen a few people say it was the "first average XV episode", but like, HECK NO.
That sword grab, man.
True.
In a month, Symphogear ends.
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
And we got a ton a great stuff, beyond that.
For that alone, it's very good.
It's likely the first time in recent seasons we could feel the episode had stakes.
Yes quite as good. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
We are swords, we will not break here. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Ep 2 is leg locking.

Yo
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Maria shattered the seal
You never know.
Also yeah, divine power. Revive them as humans.
Vampires, cyborgs, Elsa not being fully cut.
Smol bikki is the people worth protecting.
It's kinda empty, but it's not bad emptiness I'd say.
Probably not
Guns are usable, but "effective" is reaching.
https://twitter.com/YameteTomete/status/1168506884900511745 Oh wow that's great. <:Germain:421434126856486912>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
The willpower is indeed strong.
As someone who is also waiting
With matching shirts.
It's amazing. <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
That was good. Not as great as the previous episodes I feel, and the duet as Melua said wasn't *that* great (though I'd say that's nothing new, it was only really significant in G), but the episode still had pretty kickass moments. Tsubasa and Hibiki. 💖
Ready go! <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
And Shirabe is Kirika's knight now. Gay.
It's part of the fun of watching live. (As in while it airs.)
Speaking of screams, Kirika's was pretty great today! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
☀ ⭐ 🌍 🌑 ⭐
The last gaijins beg a question though. If you can rotate them, why weren't they upside-down for episode 6? <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
That was... Great. Real great.
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592> IGNITION <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
Even if if they do that... Could NR survive...?
For the moon I'd expect Daedalus End.
Can't the antagonists be happy for once?! <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
Even disregarding how Elsa and Millaarc would be left if she fell in battle.
She seems to genuinely care for Millaarc and Elsa, so I'd say she has a fair chance of being like ok, this has been going for too long. Let's not forget she is accompanying a wounded Elsa, a fight would only put her in danger.
"sometimes"
But it'd be formulaic and Symphogear can love being formulaic sometimes.
She doesn't strike me as hostile.
Give or take some characterization for Shem-ha.
Seems meaty enough for a whole episode, I'd say, but we shall see!
I really wonder if we'll have time for that next week. What's with the situation on Earth and Chris probably getting her Amalgam moment.
But with all the callbacks this season... I'd say it's definitely a possibility.
That it was.
```Nah. I doubt they'd break the OP [Aufwachen] tradition```I mean FIRST LOVE SONG was a thing. I wouldn't be too surprised if they defeated Shem-Ha with whatever Aufwachen song they had and then Bikki reached out with Kimi Dake Ni. Not that I expect it, but it's possible.
It totally sounds like a RWBY ship.
There also a live there -> https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4gtais which is pretty cool with Nana being her usual Nana. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Should be that.

But it'll be great anyway. <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
It will be rushed, that's just how they roll.
I mean, it's Symphogear.
Like, that's the characters on the logo.
Senki Zesshou it looks like
TITLE IS SUPER HYPE <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Preview images are hype ~~even if they're all lies~~
Could be jii.

Vanessa teasing her. Miku is not available, so she gropes Chris instead.
This is a pretty gay season for Bikki.
Also ```I thought biki was holding chris breast```You mean she does *not*?
Praise translations. <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Elfnein will talk at some point, is all we can be sure of. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Do not believe the preview.
Moonrunes! <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
I'd say the last picture is between the midway point and the end.
The preview don't necessarily go to the end.
Surprisingly heterosexual.
I'm not expecting any confession. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
If only.
Final boss will just be Bikki trying to get through Miku's thick skull for groping Chris, obviously.
Byebye. <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Oh no. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Also, we see Bikki's family, any chance we get to see TONY GLAZER? <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Someone's having fun.
Not necessarily all, but it's a common ending trope and this season's artwork seems to hint at it.
"senkizesshousymphogeaaaar"
Pfft
I still want them to befriend Shem-Ha. <:Germain:421434126856486912>
... It really is.
Aww
Even so, huh.
I wonder if she knew for Airgetlam. Probably not.
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Goodbye, try to manage the hype. 💤
Well, I'll go for real myself. I stayed up for the preview, but I need sleep like a normal human being. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Then emptiness. Lots of it.
I have no faith in Kaneko, but Symphogear, while it has sometimes been subpar, has never disappointed me. Even if it's not a perfect finale, it will be the Symphogear we love.
AKA the cutest thing ever. <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
The shinai ending.
Oh right, Miso
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
I'm more of a headpat person, so I would headpat him.
It's the ending we deserve. I'm not expecting to get it. But we deserve it, and so do our girls.
^
I couldn't be disappointed in Symphogear anyway.
~~They're best friends, they said so.~~
Network jammer, do your magic.
Fate detective, huh. I imagined Fate Testarossa as a detective, and, well. I would watch that.
We're still safe here. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
The clock is Tiki?
Enki even has two ears, one for each one to bite and lick! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
We shall. A sword needs no sleep. <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
That's too good an idea. I don't want to make loud sounds though, pretty self-conscious about that in general.
I would happily sleep, but like... I don't wanna oversleep. Symphogear is too sacred for that. <:Germain:421434126856486912>
I'm not ready for Symphogear to be finished, but I'm excited to see the ending Kaneko envisioned.
In five hours there will only be one episode of Symphogear left to be released.
Aaaaaaaaaah five hours. <:Germain:421434126856486912>
I mean the last ep has always been the season's tagline, and it hasn't been used yet.
Create a history with the light God could not know?
I love Symphogear sometimes.
Throwing the reflector with the arrow was a great idea. <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Chris is already plenty bountiful, "up there". <:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
Watching is a good idea.
It is good.
Yes.
Brogawa reminded me more of Snake from 999, but he does look Dante-y too.
Yeah it is! <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Pure kino.
Also. Today's Gungnir Tron was honestly the best in the series by a mile.
Cool and pretty, what else do we need? <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
If you think about it, Hibiki looks like Saint-Germain in the group shot.
Today we say AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Yes.
Symphogear is all about bonds.
Well
Don't we all. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Kinda, but I'm happy we spent the time on more important matters.
Holy shit.
Right?
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
I said it earlier, the best gungnir tron in the series. *Maybe* the best yell.
It was fantastic.
Right?!
F
The fans are shouting.
The fans.
It won't be longer.
Let's see, we would have Shem-ha getting a backstory (though she implied one today), Hibimiku, and a an epilogue at the very least. Yep, sounds packed.
I could see that.
I still haven't listened to it, so I hope it pays off next week! <:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
After all, it's not like the song it was a reply to was ever in the show either. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Yeah, is Kimi Dake Ni ever going to play?!
When you try to use the computers, but the humans are playing 4D chess on the internet.
A gay Ogawa, a straight Ogawa, and a loner Ogawa.
She capitalized on what she *could* do. To the max.
B e f r i e n d
Humanity doomed us all.
It's hyyyype and scary. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
And be her only remaining way to deal with Shem-ha.
Like... Kimi Dake Ni could totally come from a Bikki purged of Gungnir.
If SSJ doesn't do that.
Didn't Shem-ha mention something about that this ep? Last time she threw a weird foreshadowy line it was explained next episode.
The perks of private browsing. <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Nope, but some parts should appeal to mecha fans.
Another thing to consider. Would we have episodes as rushed (in the sense that a lot of things happen, more than should in a single episode) as episode 9 if a movie was coming?
Kaneko has had in mind his ending for a while now, so by wanting to stop the (TV) series after XV I'm thinking he plans on doing that ending. Otherwise, I'm not sure he would have asked for it to be the last.
I really doubt we will get one though.
I must say, if we actually get a perfect ending, I'll have to make amends for not having faith in Kaneko. Because at this point, we can have an alright ending, but we have way to much stuff to go over for it to be perfect.
Triumph shines brighter after traversing the darkest despair, and that goes for Hibimiku too! <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
Just right now, I could see creating a situation in which maintaining a "home" for Bikki, which Miku represents, would clash with the Symphogears' motivations from the Plot™ as a justification for turning her into an antagonist. Though of course that would have to be developed. 🤔
Well hopefully the release of the Curse helps.
Well Shem-ah *is* related to communication, which Miku wanted. She wants to reach Hibiki, and that goal goes hand in hand with Shemmy's.
In general Dino, I'd say it is more interesting when a character's actions originate from their character, rather than some form of control. Though Miku *getting* possessed was her character at work there according to Shemmy. It's one of the things I don't like much about G actually, but it was done better here in XV, I think. 
As with most things, it comes down to how you can justify that. But I would say, for equally good justifications, Miku being an antagonist is cooler than Miku being possessed.
I'm not sure I'd be too interested in a non-Kaneko Symphogear.
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
~~I don't know if that sounds like a challenge solo and it messes my mind up.~~
Who knows. All I know is that I want a kiss, but can't expect one. ANything explicit really. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
If they can justify Miku being an antagonist, surely they can justify them being stronger for it, in the end. <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
If they kiss, do we also riot? <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
That would be cursed. Cursed.
B-break up?!
```literally everyone in existence has a fetish, dino```Generalities are always bad. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Speaking of shinais, could we maybe get Yatsuhiro's funeral in it?
It's hype and scaryyyyyyy. <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
In about a day, we have the preview too. <:Germain:421434126856486912>
I like they went that route. Forcing arcs was a problem. But instead this time around we just got a good sendoff. <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
The first non-lewd handholding ever.
I expect handholding too.
HIBIKI WILL BE SAFE DAMNIT <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
Well yeah, though the season says the nation was built on forgoing the spiritual or something. In like episode 3.
Yo preview! It's the end now! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
What's the name of the episode actually? The tagline?
Silver Warrior Jobber <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
Nah.
Azure Striker Swordblaze. <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
The most beautiful of Chrises is Chris, of course. All chrises are the most beautiful.
Dino, you know very well Hibiki and Miku won't bang.
I'm thinking the hands may be a Shem-ha flashback.
That's... That's actually true.
Like in S1? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
The red, mmh. Part the Yggdrasil's interior? Though I'm still betting it's just a flashback background.
Maybe they are, for a flashback of sorts. Using a different style would not be a first.
I believe is the exact one
"Create a history, with the light God could not know"
Thanks. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
KIMI DAKE NI
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
They know. We know. They know we know. <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Isn't it already? <:Ver:336656981144109066>
They won't. But it's not needed, thankfully!
The boys don't know it!
Even turned into stone, she has a song in her heart to break free!
Dragon Quest V.
And relevant it is.
oh
Artists are quick.
Symphogear-hyping, watching and ending, then...
Of course we will.
Idk if she has oil, she mostly seems *salty* in that one image!
If they have a few spare rockets, how about putting one right in Shemmy? <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Everyone was talking about it in episode 1, at least.
I'm nooooooot prepared! <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
A win is a win. <:Ver:336656981144109066>
And Ver's ability, as we all know, is winning.
True enough, Maria's been winning more than usual this season.
Mmmh
More than Ver at least.
I suppose it's thanks to that that people were so quick to react to Shemmy's hacking too.
Like Fine hinted at in S1
I think Millhi was saying they just can use X-Drive when they're freed from the curse.
They're using most of the servers to stop Shem-ha from spreading, after all.
You may reload if it doesn't show.
All chairs are evil by virtue of being small beds you can't lay on.
I wonder who that someone else could be...
Considering it's Kaneko's, I would say it's at least a possibility.
There has been debate over whether or not WA2 is actually LGBT. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I could actually see a BL thing
Considering Wild ARMs 2
If it has to end, it's been a great sendoff to our beloved characters.
I'm happy with XV
We will have their songs in our hearts! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Well, not really because we'll get shinais and the 2020 Live.
This is the end. Goodbye SYmphogear.
It's a mecha anime now.
And tell the couple Hibimiku should be relationship goals. <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
I'm so happy we all could experience XV as it aired. The wait has been frustrating, but for a season like that I really wouldn't have it any other way. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Sleep? Defenders don't need sleep. <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
With Symphogear's ships you can only go up. <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
They are handy if you need to jump on something, anything!
Well, for us using subs.
Only a little more than ten hours before Symphogear finishes! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Also... Does anyone know what this episode's preview lines are? The cryptic stuff YT was translating earlier in the season.
With Shirabe as a copilot to keep her from doing dumb stuff, dess. <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Like, plushies of the geahs.
It looks like the last ep was designed to sell merchs! <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
Well, if I'm being honest
Amazing.
Now more like 13! The wait! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
It's catlike. Cute.
But you can't edit me. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Aww, you edited iiiiiit
(No need to thank me.)
See.
Despair is better for our dess pair, silly.
~~Welp, someone go check that.~~
Well, we'll see soon enough.
Sad dess.
Sadness.
I see.
Are they an artist working on Symphogear? 🤔
Even if it's not as impactful as when it comes after all the hard stuff.
Well, we can have an epilogue in the shinais.
I'm happy we can experience it too! <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
It's sooo wholesome. <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
~~Does she remember what bullying is though?~~
Getting to be excited every week, having the wait pay off every time... What a time it's been. <:Cag:423197445644615711>
Makes me wish I hopped into the Symphotrain sooner, Millhi. But I got in soon enough to be super invested into all the plot threads slowly coming together this season, at least.
Still in three hours there, five hours everywhere else!
Yesyes!
<:ShirabeWhisper:620073899001905153>
Let's go? How about READY GO? <:Germain:421434126856486912>
I've mostly lurked but rest assured I appreciated reading this channel. <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
How encouraging would "don't worry it will over soon" be?
Raising my ~~cup~~ water bottle in honor of an anime we all love. <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Gentlemen, let us celebrate the coming end.
Risqué. <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Beautiful girls. <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Of course, cute. Cute and powerful. ~~Like Chris!~~ <:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
Is SHEMMY actually dramatic in all caps?
Eh, I suppose it DOES.
Why are you saying SHEM HA in all caps, Dino? <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
I've been meaning to ask, but
These? https://www.symphogear-xv.com/next/XVnext13.php
Now every saturday people come tell me hey, it's saturday.
In my friends' server the Symphogear finally saturday image became quite the meme.
I wonder how this channel would be as an IRL group. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Her sword must strike true, there is no time for mistakes!
The state of this channel pretty much.
Well that's relatable. https://twitter.com/urakata_/status/1177930335176101888
Yay
Two hours and a half before Japanese broadcast! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
You have a hype in your heart? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
```It'd...be pretty unlikely for that to happen literally only Fine/Ryoko understood how to make them so it would take some  "Oh look we suddenly found her secret notes" plot contrivance```I could see that addressed with the release of the curse and humanity's newfound mutual understanding. But only in fanfics, ah, the actually show won't go that far.
That would be very.... Not Symphogear to end like that.
She very definitely won't.
~~What bad could come out of it.~~
~~Inb4 Miku can't manage her jealousy and it ends terribly.~~
Proposal: triad
```But no season 6, let these characters rest....especially Tsubasa.```Yes, and considering the character interactions this season - I know I said it a lot already, hopefully it doesn't get too old - XV was most definitely a sendoff. So no sequel. We reflected on the growth of our girls, one last time.
*Patpat*
Soooooo who is ready to *not* have a hibimiku official confirmation?
```You wouldn't be able to say anything```That's assuming his sheer authority doesn't fill you with the willpower to answer him with all your (weak) heart!
Dante Ogawa seems like a huge dom. He would say "come with me" and you would know no better than to say "yes sir".
Males may be op, but the girls are cuter! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Tfw I would still be a shut-in and would never meet anyone from the show if I were to be isekaied.
What it means: https://twitter.com/YameteTomete/status/1177927162797678592
I stayed up all night, I can spare a few more hours! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Who is?
<#384870333620027403> question marcc
Like that, at least.
Watching the RAW would be illegal already, no?
meoww
I'm thinking Dino just doesn't use catsite. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
RAWs typically come just after the episode finishes airing.
As Melua said
Then less than two hours
Having a set time and not always knowledge of an eventual continuity is... Not a good thing, I'd think. Every other medium is more flexible.
Though movies are also kind of flexible. You just have to write specifically for a movie-length in mind, which doesn't fit all stories.
If you're anime original.
Anime seems to be pretty much the *worst possible way* to tell your story, honestly.
Right?
The characters and their relationship were largely the plot of S1.
Yes.
(Which is natural, considering S1 was much more of a character drama than G ever was.)
But yeah, Kanade was much more of a character than Serena.
Well, not a companion piece per se, though I'd say it's still valuable as hindsight for a few things.
Unless I remember that wrong.
And in the manga, no?
Gen not dying in episode 9 goes to show that he won't take opportunities to kill off characters.
Also that, yeah.
Eeeeeeh.
The end has always been hopeful and all.
The series has *never* ended in tragedy.
What Armados calls "cash cow", I believe, wasn't a thing back then.
S1 was... Different.
A point or two.
He has a point, just presenting it in a kind of mean way.
Nerds.
That being?
At least I figured that was the case. May be mistaken.
True, though you'd think people ripping that stuff would buy premium anyway, no?
Downloading from catsite doesn't support CR.
May we meet again in the post-Symphogear era. <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Thank you for everything, gentlemen.
An honor indeed!
Subbed will be in two hours, and not anywhere before that.
When Dino says that he means the RAW, which he gets later because he doesn't use catsite.
Nowhere.
No, two.
See ya guys. <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Well, I can believe it, but it feels so... Unreal.
I can't believe it's upon us.
Meanwhile, the beginning of the end in Japan is in ten minuuuuuuutes! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
More two hours and a quarter.
More or less
Maria did imply Apple was the song people took with them when Chernobyl happened, so kinda relevant I guess?
Amazing
This is
That was the best last moments! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Hibimiku is more canon than I ever thought it would be. <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
I shaking but not crying! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Metanoia is a cool song but not the best one as an insert tbh.
Well breaking her spaceship thing was very much a group effort.
HELLO CYPHER
No.
Isn't Kirika's whole thing that you don't need to know your roots to be happy?
As far as combat involvement is concerned
Destroying the spaceship thing was a group effort though, I'd say it's well divided between group stuff and Bikki stuff *for once*.
It's totally super canon!
Me too, actually.
Didn't she burn the memories used to build Carol?
Mech!
It's not too great as an insert.
Can't be Symphogear without a silly attack, after all.
Goodbyes are sad but I'm at peace with letting them go after all that.
I don't know how I feel
Everyone is here!
Thank you Kaneko.
Her spares probably aren't human, yeah. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Or maybe it really is a fail.
Eeeeh could be the light.
But really, they're all great. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I would say Rukka Ryouran is my favorite.
My girl Cag! <:Cag:423197445644615711>
```Yellowone오늘 오후 9:22
The reason miku said yes to Shemha <3```Literally the plot was a thing because she was too gay.
For all the talk about stuff being too quick, I think they did a fine job considering the story they had.
Chris is with spaghetti.
Now it's more like implausible deniability.
Thank you everyone who made Symphogear. <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>

It was a pretty neat callback!
GX concert was fine no?
That being said, no conclusion on her idol career, with or without Maria.
Tsubasa definitely did.
Shinais are the OVA. The more slice of lifey stuff.
Like Chris buying the altar.
I mean shinais are generally comedic, but they can be anything wholesome really.
Probably the most tightly written.
S1 is amazing.
Basically the question is "is XV better than G".
^
Yeah, can't really judge XV fairly right now.
Considering the instrumental played at the end, one can assume Hibiki went all Kimi Dake Ni off camera. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I was not expecting something nearly as confirming, even if it wasn't *explicit* per se.
Yeah me too.
Oh right, FLIGHT FEATHERS.
It went to heck in the backstage.
Every moment isn't conveyed better with things being explicit.
~~it's not mikugeah tho it's a faust robe which is not a geah~~
There is only one way it could realistically go.
**Nice.** The gothic girl? I've been liking her style. <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Aoi has a role in it, mmh? Nice.
I've been meaning to watch that!
Bride Mikugear. <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Not just Mikugear.
Arigato, sayonara... <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
It was too good.
Especially considering G's final boss was a living relic, eh.
Which yeah, it was pretty OP.
I think Dino meant more why the writers had it destroyed.
Shinais may touch upon it as well.
The next front shot is at Yatsuhiro's grave, but their clothes could easily hide them in that case.
IIRC we only see them from the back after Shem-ha gives them up.
It's not like we had a clear shot of them though.
That'd be the trope, yeah.
But the others' we don't know.
We saw Hibiki's converter breaking, I believe.
Fodder is meant to be oneshotted.
Chris, if it's not at home, probably.
Pretty sure it's that, yeah. Believe in justice and grip it tight. May be a bit off but that's what I heard.
Grip it tight or something?
Whoever says Nanoha is bad?
I don't know how well it works from a more professional musical standpoint, but I feel it works better out of context for me.
Axia no Kaze's first part works well in context, but the second part is way too talked over. You pretty much don't really get to listen to the best parts in good conditions.
Hibike, hibike, hibiki ae! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
~~Is Elfnein Satelight?~~
She puts her brain cell to a particularly good use, indeed.
Yes. <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>

The legs, I think. Typical T-pose has them joined, no?
Together, even in inability to T-pose. <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>

At this rate I'll really start to think Symphogear ended. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
... Still no episode 14 on catsite, I don't understand.
What a dream! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
That's why Chris' parents weren't there, they weren't in the shadow realm, they were just away.
The Engrish is one of the best parts! <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Xtreme Vibes is them being freed. <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
Why do the hamburgers look like rice? <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
It's the objectively optimal way to port Symphogear to the western kids, though. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
It's the next best thing.
Hug God in the face, of course. <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
Yeah, you're right.
Or at least, had when Kanade did her thing.
Which is puzzling, considering they have LiNKER.
Likewise. Can't say I have a solid memory of it. 🤔
Mmh, true enough. I always assumed the pendants only had a fragment of their already incomplete relics (like how they could install the Dainslef piece on all the converters), but yeah, makes sense.
Also I'm pretty sure she could've retrieved/stolen either Gungnir or Ame-no-Habakiri to hand it to another FIS child. Or more simply, could've looked through Lydian to find another adaptor, since they pretty much cultivated them.
I'm 99% sure that'll be addressed in the shinais.
When you think about it, a strong character is much more special than a plot blessing. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Thinking about it, it probably would've been more efficient for Fine to just make Faust Robes.
Thankfully she was also pretty good at being dead, so no talent went to waste.
<:KanadeSit:535301654464036884>
Pretty much, it seems.
Yeeeeah actually talking about it it's *not that puzzling anymore* they didn't use LiNKER.
What's with that "immense burden".
I guess they didn't do that to other potential adaptors for ethical reasons.
Lore!
Was it named in keywords?
I don't think so.
I'm nooooot sure you could cut even like half the season (and that's if you're doing a pretty long movie).
Like, IIRC most things are actually fairly important.
Symphogear S1 doesn't have nearly as much unimportant (for the plot) stuff as Nanoha S1, I think. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
Like she's enjoying the thrill of killing.
Man, Basa looks WILD in the first page.

Miku is lucky to have such a wonderful wife, isn't she. <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Should've drawn Hibiki wrestling a tank, more like.
... To maybe fill the hole a little.
Can't wait either. <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
I mostly only lurk, I'm too shy for my own good, but nonetheless, I'm really glad I could take part in all this. Both watching XV live, which was the first season I could watch that way, and discussing things here. Y'all are cool. Thanks, from the bottom of my heart. The time spent was a symphony. <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
Anime ja nai! <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Gotta say, that's pretty metal Saki.
Pretty cool one. a katana greatsword thingy sounds like something for Basa.
Did someone say SWORD?

The decapitation mode or something? I mean, if it can't slice at least a plane, it's too small.
This sword is alright, but still too small for Basa.
Spooky scary Tsubasa!
Our Guy is right. But who is swordier, Basa or this evolution line?


Probably. Swords are important.

Won't Tsubasa have *too many swords* eventually?
I think this is a good Basasword.

Look at this! I want a girlfriend with a sword like that.

Tsubasa, happy birthday!
Mmh, I see.
What kind of hallucinations?
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
Oh, sorry. I mean, for instance, a cis lesbian could find more comfort with a partner who can relate to having periods, perhaps to the point she may not feel good if her partner doesn't.
I'm sure some people would also feel better with a partner able to directly relate to specific issues trans people may not know as much, or differently. Just like some trans people want to have partners that can relate to their own struggles.
I've never met such a person either, though, but with the diversity of our species I'm sure it must exist somewhere.
Yeah, of course. I'm not saying it's good or shouldn't be worked through, I'm just saying there would be reasons not to date a trans person that aren't transphobia.
Congratulations! <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
