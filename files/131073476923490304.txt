Almost there

Any Miracle carol raid up?
I need like 10
I wish that was me
Jesus
I need to become friends with mouse hue
No good greens to kill her adds either
Especially when she drops the wrong items
Farming green carol is frustrating
I want to trade these rainbows jesus fuck man
I need 2 more miracle gems and then I just need to farm int
I might try to farm her instead for Int then
Oh P Carol drops the int stuff?
P carol up
Setting up a P carol if anyone can help, just need like 7 mega Int to LU Hibiki now
I can help with P carol, need blue stones
Then I hope things get easier
Need 2 more ultra int to FINALLY get my bikki to max
P 4 star can
Tech raid is annoying
So just Ungabunga and burte force your way
Anyways to deal with the status effects of raids?
Its a shame how symphogear didnt catch on here
Meguca gave a looooooooot of free rolls
How many refills you guys still have after getting  MLB 5 to 70
Anyone wanna give a hand for the last push?
Alright, good to know
Is it more efficient to do 2 runs of 5 instead of 1 of 10?
I opened to friends instead of all by mistake, if anyone can help
Starting another
Oh hey my raid nice
Can someone finish it off? Rather not waste more pots
Anyone wants an almost dead tech?

There are no good enough greens o think
I take my best units,
I will need lots of P carol
