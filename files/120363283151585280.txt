Any healer worth really investing yet? Tbh I find the 4star aoe healers good
I still have all my raids cuz lazy, I can summon hard modes as needed
Just put up red for those who wanna run it
I just put a tech one if ppl wanna kill
Then I tried 4star healer tsubasa, and while she has lower healer % shes much lower cooldown and aoe heal. Plus when shes 5star+ she gives a nice buff to her own attack
I initially started trying to lvl 4star healer shirabe, but her skill cooldown is soo long
I try to follow ppl from discord back so I dont accidentally delete
When I'm back later I'll delete ppl
Need to lvl her but once I max out 4star healer tsubasa I should be able to do much more in raids
Sure
Ty for posting that blank! Ide assume yours is probably around same too blank, power raids I can take off a good 1m or so with 3-4 tries, cuz lvl 70 erenhibiki wrecks it
Ok see I see ur raid now
K
Also no room for me to add u
Not seeing ur raid <@73495694064754688>
Used 3 tries so I'm saving my stuff
Ok, I already have one too, I did about 1m or so already
Any current power hard raids looking for help?
Ah
Do the stuff Carol drops have a use yet? Or is it all future stuff
So far, even the xd quests are easy..or lvl70 aothibiki just that strong
I got lucky on aot banner with erenbiki so I could lu her, then instead of saving for kanade, I went I see potential in 4star healer tsubasa and rolled few times and got enough to finish off lb. Now it's just leveling and power raid crystals
4star tsubasa..but she just hit half hp and killed her
Wayfarers carol gonna b dead, she cant kill my healer
Wayfarer
Pharas down now
Green
Almost have phara dead on Carol raid...and I dont think Carol can kill my healer
Btw I have a half dead power raid going
Wonder if it was random lol
Unless ur ign different
Think we already added wayfarer
Added
Any1 else trying to add me so I can make room?
K, I made room
Lemme make room
I got a power raid up for those who wanna join, after this attack, itll have 2m hp left
And that super OP carol whenever shes released
I want kanade<:KanadeSit:535301654464036884>
Just need a healer who can survive with my lvl 70 aotbiki then I can probably use low cost raids and still do stupid amounts of damage
Need few power gigas tho to lu healer tsubasa
If I needed stuff from carol ide probably try to fight, but no need for stuff yet
Hmm interesting abbreviation
Seen the abbreviation a few times, but what is jii?
Also remember seeing ogawa and genjuro too, which is just nice
Looks like welfare will be tanky too
She will work perfectly with aotbiki
Oooo<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Hoping tech since there is no good tech chars
What type is this version?
Welfare kanade is still a kanade<:Ver:336656981144109066>
I'm just hoping this game will last, loved the anime, so hoping this game will be here for awhile
But apparently they're both VERY cost heavy
Ideal team would be aotbiki, the super carol and stronger kanade
Hmm were any of the 5star good?
Aot tsubasa?
Pink... body?
Ide guess we would probably get a few 4star and 5star kanades
Hoping we get kanade exclusive banner like xdrives
But I doubt she will be first one
I'll have to check jp wiki so I can remember which kanade is the OP one
Hopefully that'll be soon, only content right now is raids. I've finished all story and xd quests
Relatively dead Dex raid

Any1 alive for raids?
Tech raid down to 875k, 2hr left still

I got a tech raid with 1.2m hp left and 2 hours b4 end, any1 wanna help kill it?
I've already took off a decent chunk to get it down, but I'm attacking it more
Credd got a half dead Int raid with approx 1 hour, let's finish it off!
She will likely eat the heart raids
I need dex carol and 1 more copy of tech kanade to lu her. But holy hell with lu she has base of like 5.5k hp
I got a green carol up, 1 add nearly dead
My last carol raid is up, top add dead
Adds on my carol are dead
Not really? Power types and power healers do well, also top add dead on my carol
I got my carol up, provoke add about half hp
Yup, followed u both back
ok made room
Ok
Ya healing debuff eventually stacks to 10p, making them do 0
After battle I can, what's ur igns so I can follow back
I'll have a green carol up shortly
I believe it's a blue circle with a * in middle
Advent bosses I've noticed have it, but wears off after like 5 turns
Then eventually hits 100, and you cant be healed, seems like debuff lasts indefinitely
Feels like it starts at 20%
All raid bosses have some mechanic where they lower healing dealt
No, opposite
Hate how after 20 turns the char cant be healed...without that stupid debuff I could probably solo some raids
Booting up game now, ima start bullying Carol, then summon my own
Both adds dead, bully time<:KanadeSit:535301654464036884>
When I look for raids, I sometimes need to refresh 2-3 times to get results, friend or not
I noticed in one, Carol did 3 elemental nova in a row, thought it had a cooldown like player skills
I got a green carol up
Wish there way a way to lock it so only ppl with code can add
Aah I see, lemme clear room then wayfarer
I thought we were already following each other <@197516016488677376>
Tech raid has abt 1m hp, can I get some help finishing it off?
Every1 getting giga miracles off my raids except me<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
About an hour left
I got a tech raid that is half hp
Bottom add on my carol is pretty much dead
Top add is dead
I got a green carol up and top add will be dead shortly
I got tech raid up and dealt just under 400k
I have a power raid up, I'm about to have done total 1m damage
But I need 1 more 3star power shirabe to get 2nd aoe healer, then I can probably do it
My team is almost to the point where I can take down top add in 1 turn
Adds on doom's?
I got tech raid up, come join in and get them xdrive kanade mats
Is ur ign same as here as I try to follow back so I dont accidentally delete
Cleared a spot <@145234510684880896>
I got tech raid up again for those who wanna join
600k left on my tech raid
I got tech raid up, please help kill it!
Me and wayfarer both have tech raids up, please help kill it!
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I got green carol up..and holy crap, maxed tech kanade bullies every1 in this fight, counterattack every1, about 1.4I crit counters on adds(they have affinity advantage) and about 2.7k on carol
Changed order of fighters and added xd shirabe, and my green carol raid, I did 400k...from a 5cp I think, before I did abt 200k..just wow
Next question is, can I kill her using 3 cp instead 10(for speed)
Just feeling invincible after getting my xd shirabe to lvl 70
If any1 has green Carol's they want beaten lmk, I can kill her from any hp if adds dead
Grats wayfarer
From my runs, it seems she stops using after turn 30
When that healer dies, if swapped out with another healer, the debuff does not carry
For carol, yes. And it stacks, but it only healing done by healer
Saving my xd shirabe for last, after she blows all her healing debuffs, she cant kill her before she heals(to full thanks to passive and memoria)
Being able to beat green carol in 2 tries feels nice after about a week and a half suffering to get giga miracles
Looks like I got lucky and did 500k this time on your raid zero
Found it, I'm attacking it now
Only one that showed up for me after 10 refreshes
Burnbasa really shined here dispelling burn
Did more than I thought I would
Hmm, 400k in 1 go
I believe I found it, I'm attacking now
K
Give me a little bit and I can fight the body raid if u have it up
Even b4 kanade came out
My aot biki hasn't lost to 1 yet
..shes just a tank that's it
So ya, my xd kanade will eat that thing
Tech beats body correct?
I can help after my raid is done
Now that I maxed my xd shirabe. I can kill green carol in 2 tries using 10 cp each try
Not really, no good body chars
I usually 80, but she can barely bring shirabe down to half, if my 3star healer shirabe to 70, I may be able to 3cp it if I cant now, honestly depends on add, if top add is dead or nearly, I'll clear, if not, itll take 2
Ya ik she gets damage boost but she cant seem to kill shirabe by herself
Ya miracle
Last call for easy kill carol, click emote on my text above
Add emote to this if you plan on joining, when you join pause immediately so you dont kill her b4 every1 can join
And my cp about to recover so ima open my carol raid when it does
Yup I saw and trying to follow every1 back
I'm gonna open my near dead green carol soon
Kk
I try to follow back so I dont accidentally delete ppl
Ok, same ign as here?
Just trying to recover my cp too
In about an hour I'll open my carol raid, left her with 5k hp, hopefully ppl can kill it
And Corona, I followed u already so should be easy to add me
<@99695384296701952> <@168735369184018432> I cleared up some space in follow list
Those will be heavy saving time for me cuz idc about them, altho there is a what looks to be shem ha miku who's OP, and then a carol who's also broken and OP
I just looked up future units and found out there is a kitsune kanade...better save up for her<:PadoruHibiki:516438720082346004>
Ya, with hexa quests coming, hopefully itll help low budget/f2p out a lot
The more characters you have built up, the easier these become
I'll ping you 2 when I get a break and can open the game again
So I cant check right now
At work so access to game is limited
Ya, friends only when I can. And what's ur ign mujtabaa? I try to follow discord people back
I'll say something when I can have ppl join, and I'll need to clean up list again
Since I'm low on rice they wont be all at once
Now that I can solo carol raids, ima get my green near dead then open to friends and help ppl with kills
But depending how fast we follow jp, that prob wont be for quite some time
So I probably wont roll stuff until kitsune kanade
I think genjuro and ogawa may be soonest, but I saw 4star versions, and event versions
Oooh
Looks like shem ha
Theres some super OP dex miku
But these all probably wont happen for a long time
I do have interest in the ogawa and genjuro units though too
All except kanades pretty new
Looking at future units tho, only ones I really want are kitsune kanade, that super OP carol, shem ha OP miku, and a good dex unit, which I saw a good Dex kanade
4
Oh ya, it's a great team, I also have mlb burnbasa, power kanade. Working on 4 star int kanade, int shirabe and 3star power healer shirabe
My main team is aotbiki, tech kanade and xd shirabe, all mlb
Wonder how much hacking affects advent.. im usually in top 50 for both em..
Yw, when I get another one down, I'll post here again
I see 6, go
So when emote at 6, unpause and kill
I counted 6
And paused
Respond here when u joined
Carol raid is open
Once I get more cp
I should have another ez kill carol soon
Ya, now that I can solo carol or do huge chunks of damage to other raids, ima try to whittle stuff down to near dead and start raid kill trains!
Never used the hackers, never will! Just need ppl who will run stuff
From my runs it seems highest damage and hunt have best chances for giga miracles
I got garbage too, dont feel bad
I have 1 more I can do, but waiting on cp, so I'll have another one in like 2 or 3 hours
Np, every1 here helped me get chars strong enough to do this, so anyway I can give back
Ok, kill it
Ya
We are short 1?
We dont wanna kill it b4 every1 joined
Raid is up, reply here when ur in and paused it
And gonna make public shortly, click emote so I know who's going
Ok it updated
Hmm maybe isnt updating, and got u nep
Somehow still full zero..nep too
Ok
Ok
Zero ur follower list full so I cant follow u back
If u add me lmk so I can follow back and not accidentally delete you
I cleared a few spots on friend list for those who didn't or couldnt add from b4
Yes
3k hp left
I got another near dead carol, gonna make to friends around 4 30(8mins)
I got a power raid with 5k hp left that I'll open up to friends in about half hour
I wonder how my new team fares on int and power raids...have to test later
Just a heads up, my cp is full so when I'm done with work ima start my last miracle raids and so same as before for maximum carol bullying
Sounds like just you, so any time
Carol is up and open
Gonna open in 2 mins since it seems like nobody is awake
No, I havent opened
I got a green carol with 5k hp, I'm gonna open to friends to get kill credit, reply to emoji if u wanna join
I'll have a nearly dead green carol up in a little while
Just a heads up I got int raid with half hp, I'll be killing it soon, so tag it while u can
I'll probably pop some raids to public tonight..super busy at work so no time to coordinate
Ya.. I've never had unity shard drop from awaken dojo
Tech raid has 1m hp left
I got tech raid up, I managed to do 600k to it
If my last healer comes out after turn 29 , I've gone all the way to turn 80 before I beat her and never get heal debuff
From soloing green carol, phara stuns you,and her other aoe will only poison stunned chars. Carol seems to stop heal debuff after turn 29
