Salt + karaoke sound like fun. A lot of songs are duets so it'll be nice to sing with others (but then again I'm not Mizuki Nana material and probably sound horrible on mic <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>  )
oops too late to the party xD late hello
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>

idk if you can read japanese but he mentions the requirements of getting blocked

did you have 0 tweets
he's not fond of americans?
he blocked you? lol why
what
<@246146781832806401> do you have all the Linkleft Kanade art already?
it looks happy tho lol
? the Kanade Hibiki one is a thing for new years
then there's my 500+ art collection of maria :v ...



idk what's been posted already so sorry for dupes

is this convo ok to be in the art channel lol off-topic a bit
yeah I didn't see any for character songs
not the same?

it's cheaper too right
oh I see
what's the difference between studio and tv?
and 始まりの歌. too many good songs
and 虹色のフリューゲル
rip wallet
also need Carol song and Exterminate
Should I buy Ready or Lady hmm
Airgetlamh lol hard to spell
that's cool
ohh
I like the gungnir song more

what kind of things do you do?


you listen to music at work? lol
the song I've been obssessed with lately
idk which ones you have already
dw I posted them for you lol

Linkleft draws some awesome Kanade





sorry for all the maria spam o/
Yep she is






this tsubasa's cute





this was the first symphogear thing I've ever seen (the chris figure) and that was my first impression of chris. way off

I hope the official chibi art style gets an anime
chibi kanade
plot twist they're not dead
also Serena+Kanade=Serenade



at least on twitter
Kanade's super popular lol
my phones usually have 34k+ art which then I reset to start fresh. every 4-6 months
if you have 8k like me it's hard to start sorting now orz
you sort even that? how? by date?
and sometimes dont even add the new art I saved into it
I just have a symphogear folder which is 95% Maria 5% others

I dont really sort my stuff since I add a lot per day xD got lazy


your Kanade gallery


do you check your 1k gallery? D:



is there a limit to how many you can post per day lol






also got a lot of ウェル memoria orz





nothing beats official art




true lol

or that
Also Carol and Kanade on the bag
Never noticed that lol nice catch
been more into Kyoushitsu Monochrome too. Wishlist is piling up
didnt know chris would be a messy eater lol

I wasn't expecting that lol
chris eating food
I used to ship Zwei Wings


a long time ago?
idk maybe?


lol that's amazing

If I did I dont remember lol
I dont have that
thanks


but would look even better if located on my shelf
it looks nice
I see a maria figure from wonfes2016
people might steal them lol
and local stores overprice them
and collect dust
figures are so expensive
yeah but the nendo was like purple xD
thought her hair was more silver
also the chris nendo's hair is a bit lilac-y
I'll buy all Maria nendos and figures
Maria birthday set is going for 200+
they have a chris figma
there was the chris nendo that went for 50 ish the other day
symphogear figures are so expensive
do you have this one
so I assumed you saved everything already xD

I feel like you browse pixiv more than me now lol
how much storage do you have left lol
amazing how you find so many
dont think it was drawn by a japanese person lol
what does that even say
thanks





okay
we need more HS Kanade Maria art now
can this go here idk










damn can't read that kanji before 食 orz
*and using other ppl's illust without permission
or locked acc, distributing illust without permission, etc
tweet 0?
I draw but I don't even post any lol
I use official art for icon and header on my main since it weirdly has a lot of followers even tho I only post my gacha results to salt the world
'cause their art is super amazing
I also have this Maria I really like but not sure which category it would go into
just make sure you dont look like a new/spam/bot acc before following Linkleft and you'll be fine
ending the spam with this
Kanade -> probably Linkleft art


well not the first bikki
yeah








<- happy with 1 copy
it's free
go get it
any uniform looks better than my hs one haha
<:MikuPout:336657212988456963>
then she comment on how Maria looks pretty good in it but not as good as Tsubasa
since Maria never even wore a uniform before
it basically is about Kanade who feels nostalgic seeing them in the Lydian uniform so she drags Maria into dressing up
lol






cheshire kanade

Prepare your wallet then lol






well I'm already hyped for S5 S6 S7 and I havent even finished this season
no spoilers pls <3


need to finish axz one of these days :x

or crazy
ver looks badass






nvm it was only around 90.
just found another artist and +300 or something to my symphogear folder orz
anything goes?
can we post B&W art here
np

https://twitter.com/ugandam_00/status/916598369543372801
I'm too lazy to draw and I wish I had those coloring skills
it's from twitter <@246195276765855745>
<@246146781832806401>
idk










those eyes






probably got spoiled a tiny bit since I'm forever on ep3 in axz (until finished with midterms at least)
https://twitter.com/afewtunas/status/919071910146781184
found something amazing





<@246146781832806401> No problem :3 Just think of you when I see Kanade fanart lol
Serena bday

https://twitter.com/nilllirr/status/917794785326383104
I'll link their twitter in case you wanna follow them
(hopefully you didn't think I drew all of these ;3)
followed people who tweet/draw symphogear and they liked their tweets :x how I got to their amazing art skills I wish I had
yep
hopefully I got some Kanades that aren't in your gallery of Kanades <@246146781832806401>
save up for that Serena gacha
almost Serena's bday soon

apparently initial design Maria had blonde hair


































I ship Chris with KiriShira now. //still third-wheeling






(ever noticed how tsubasa's hair thing looks like a wing)






<- haven't read the story- except ending
there's Miku-miku then AU Miku
which Miku is it though
Could be a love triangle.
I shipped HibiChris. Then HibiMiku got too canon
who's your fav
Just curious <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
do you perhaps like HibiMiku

<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
my bad
to see Maria better
HAHA forgot I put it upside down
sorry for the bad quality :x

guess you can't save it if you clicked on the thumbnail from the user's page :x
twitter images *
not sure how to save images on browser :x

thanks for clarifying, Alice <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
idk
official art*
wait official can go here?
Wow I’m jealous. Everything is cheap yet good in Japan



it’s too beautiful I feel the need to share
not symphogear can go here?

<:MariaBliss:336657061209309184>


<@246146781832806401> welcome back. You’re in Japan now?
My birthday is 3 days after Maria's VA's :x //random fact
I would check that right now but too bad MEMU can't run XDU
And she just resurrected.
they just never kept in touch. Then again I didn't read anything except for ending and could be wrong.
I don't think she died..
I think AU Miku moved away
if I recall the ending correctly
it was AUHibiMiku
that's what the HibiMiku hugging memory was
idk
could be remembering wrong but didn't Miku leave and Hibiki's sorta sad again but then heard Miku calling her. She thought it was symphogear Miku but somehow AU Miku showed up?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>


<:MariaBliss:336657061209309184>













I thought they might upload something since a lot of autoscorer memoria came out
sorry it was kiraki



https://twitter.com/afewtunas
if I'm not mistaken this is the artist
you can see it on the artist's twitter
maybe it's only for mobile
did a reset so I'm ready to save more symphoyuri
more efficient than me spamming everything <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
for free*
you can browse by ranking/popularity now for the next 6 days
guys you use pixiv right

back with more
no problem my friend
<:HibikiPoint:336657004959498240>
Just save on your phone or not bother renaming it





to image
then it auto changes it
if you're using a comp to save
on my phone
idk I save from pixiv



















(sorry for any awkward translation)
Of course!
Is it good?
Thanks. (I wonder why...this is kinda disappointing...)
Here. Have some candy. I just made some earlier.
...Um.. Miku-san? Are you listening?
Trick or treat! If you don't give me candy, I'll pull a trick on you~!






new kanades






no free stuff
pc sucks apparently
go mobile
rip
since I'm not able to access it by number of bookmarks rn

feels like a repost but just in case






says something along the lines of The story of the Kazanari ('s household)
but it looks cool
idk

miku sandwich








otp





the usual stuff
ohhh I'm at the beginning of HF






it is??













this one's your icon right <@279341087494242304>


















this goes here right 
https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=66108593






idk what has been posted and what has not <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>

played that animal game. Surprisingly fun. It's like Jenga where you stack animals and whoever topple over the pile over the edge loses. I see people with 500+ wins lmao.







I like it when artists sign their art 
so you know who drew what later when it's all mixed in your gallery




a miracle 👀

I feel like I'll end up reposting yours 😩

how do you keep track--
yeah I like this one
😩 I haven't checked the posts for the last month or so
you probably don't even remember what you posted and what you haven't posted
post like 1 or 5 per day






tsubasa and miku lol
idk





unrelated but I read the butt comic a few days ago. Better than twilight(meme is dead)
it feels like everyone's going to Japan this month but me orz
forever paused at S2 orz
Gundam 00 best gundam
Gundam takes forever though
started reading because loli looked like illya from fate-
I’m reading a manga called Yuzumori-san and it’s basically aneloli with cute fluffy art
it’s been like 2-3 years or something
despite not finishing anything //cough assassination classroom
I’m just casually browsing through and finding new manga to read
where should I post GL fluffiness
is there a manga discussion channel
just finished Maria holic anime. Manga’s eng translation is still dead
is flip flappers good plot-wise?
2eps every week?
:x haven’t watched it
how is girls und panzer?
\o/
2pm EST is like 11am PST if I recall correctly
die suki death
watch one ep of each ? lol
much respect for her talent :x though not high on my personal fav list either
except I never get to it
^
The minigames are addicting too
SDR2 used to be my fav then I played v3
Played it a while back and 20/10 would recommend
I find the controls to be a bit slow?
grats
okay <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
anything can go into that channel? lol
saw that one coming though
damn
just finished an 'ending'
I don't wanna get spoiled so :x
you played it? how long did it take you to complete everything
I'm getting the impression it's fucked up
ready for anything
I signed the agreement :x
at the end? lol
No idea what to expect.
I saw Doki doki literature club somewhere from here and decided to give it a shot from the pretty art.
