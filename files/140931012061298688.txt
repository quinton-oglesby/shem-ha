uh if you are rerolling for xd hibiki <@!292700103544930315>   you are going to need to grind story really hard even if you get it unless you plan to <a:problemsolver:666665387861213207>

<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> <:green_frog_sad_hands:471938737010507817>
hibiki is literally the mascot char though so eh

<@!292700103544930315>  you full üò¶
üò¶
i mean just make an open sheet and have people all be able to plug it in themselves
i bet the one that is pinned half of them quit so its going to be a real pain in the ass to figure out who is who
someone should make a google doc or someshit that is updated
<:sadkitty:410986608846962692>

<a:problemsolver:666665387861213207>
I can summon both then go nap if you guys want
lol
a game i played used to use the same code but had to generate new pw each time too
o sweet someone told me you gota make a new pw each time so i am like idk
its the same code but i think you gota gen a new pw dont you?
but after that you gona generate a new pw
so assuming you never need to use it the one you save when you make it is good
you gota make a new pw everytime you change device
hope you playing on a phone and not on nox because nox tends to randomly suduku
i was about to say <:ohno:448258936588730371>
wat
<a:peepobed:643324718312587284>
k red and green up\
or if there is literally 0 friends or some dumb shit
how it works is it is set to public after 2 hours
<@!396016914347851786>  <@!208153244914941962>   <@!179124101942738944>  add me after you guys purge i guess gona go store real quick
isnt phantasy from dragon?
<@!208153244914941962>  too i guess
<@!396016914347851786>  you full btw
guess i can summon techs too i guess
i want <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>  but i am like 99% sure i'll only get kanades
depends on what you need too
you rerolling or whaling
uh chris or wait till next week
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
i think i can spawn some after i die to this carol too
you should be able to at least auto it once before it wipes you
yes
its time
aw shit
i can post hearts if you want  i need hearts for <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>  next week anyways
<:XDPoi:366211700417888256>
dont be that guy that literally posts every boss and makes the list actual cancer
<:LUL:445449450849042432>
vroom vroom
gota go fast
<:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
how can i collect all these swords
i want to roll for swords but  new event is sword too
ripo
a lot easier
<@!145234510684880896>  just post yours or rename yourself to ________()
lol
a few people need it and we just summon it for them
post yours
ah that makes a lot more sense then
i have it but i never used it lol
guess i'll try it later
o thats prob why
i am doing it wrong then even if i run healers they get insta rekt
?

the green one?
wait which one is that again?
the 3* fm one right
i dont have that chris
<:kms:294324534113468416>
i cant beat the gold 5* stage with my tsubasa and a friend unit that is lvl 70 too
technically i shouldnt be in hard too by that logic because one unit lu doesnt do much vs hards tbh
lol
you can yolo it with 1 stam if you are in hard modes
99% sure
i am like
200k?
uh
easy?
run your 3 easy a day and yolo people's easy down if you see it
no oke
yeah that gives phantasy/etc too
<:XDPoi:366211700417888256>
i mean they legit cant beat it anyways so you might as well yolo it down for them
<:LUL:445449450849042432>
so you go in people's easy modos and dps it down and you get mvp and the killing blow
there are legit people that cant solo it too
lol
thats how i got my aot to 70
do your easy mode runs
<:slokainoose:621288529858920486>
most of the <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>  are body
i prob need dragons indefinately
or i am
you full btw
or tag other people's dragons
a lot of people actually need body so just summon yours and hope you get lucky
idk
i dont see it or i dont have you added
i'll come tag and summon mine too
i need hearts for tsubasa next week
oh shit are we doing hearts?
<:YuuPeek:292951854323597312>
idk when it gets actually psoted because sometimes i dont see you guys's stuff that you just just psoted for 10 mins and sometimes its instantly
it takes a lot of refreshes
you can be lvl 70 within the first hour
you can collect parts in advance so when you <a:problemsolver:666665387861213207>
yeah np
though his ign and his discord name is way different so its kinda confusing lol
he said he went to class or something
woops
thats uh whats his name
<:herp:448258937314082816>
i didnt play then
or that was what i was told
bosses didnt use skills
first week was bugged
yeah me <a:problemsolver:666665387861213207>  the aot one was <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
like 1/3 of tsubasa's cards are body so <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
tbh i would have done that in the tsubasa banner but i am <a:problemsolver:666665387861213207>  iron saga too
<a:problemsolver:666665387861213207>
not always i think
star the people you follow so its easier to not accidently delete someone lol
i just cleared a few
rip
might be easier if you try following us lol
its  a high lvl chris xd
its really dumb how this game's friend list isnt consensual
he is full too so cant add <:green_frog_sad_hands:471938737010507817>
you full too btw <@!264451306221993985>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
i was going to try and it doesnt even let me field them
k i'll try
<:thinkzusa:373279109754781696>
i field 3 of them and it lvls up faster?
is that how it works?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
so wtf do i do with these extra aot swords?
isnt that a high level guy?
üê≥
<a:HyperThinkRotate:586478611414908948>
did 2 mil in one auto
he is like lvl 57 or someshit
that onehit guy would be banned before all of us tbh
<:thinkzusa:373279109754781696>
pretty sure half of this channel would be banned if they banned
dont think he has me added
<:green_frog_sad_hands:471938737010507817>
dont see it
<:thinkzusa:373279109754781696>
you playing this game without watching the animu?

There is never a shortage

<:RIP:246767863216472075>

<:omegaLUL:420841831111196702>
wats dex
i should come snipe it
rip
miracles
i need 9000000000001
wtb green carols
you can technically dps carol up the ass with both adds up
isnt it pretty rngy?
<:please:424855543442833418>

Eh depends
yeah dex is piss easy but dex also doesnt drop anything
All these 54
<:slokainoose:621288529858920486>
here let me show you my stuff
<:omegaLUL:420841831111196702>
rng
i cant do anything other than dragon pretty much lol
my shit is way too diverse
but now a lot of us have lu'ed units so eh
revive ji was really good tbh
i need a few more then i can max mine
<:green_frog_sad_hands:471938737010507817>
i think all the people with the xd hibiki/good ints are asleep
<:Thinkioh:375914477352255488>
<@!87303126884847616>  tell me after you cleared fl <:shy:233671842605432833>

i am donezo for now
I come for tech
i am out for dragon
lol
idk when but my fl went from 50 to 60 so i have 10 more slots now
ripo
i'll come back if its body/tech/heart

paused on my screen too
i was going to come back for heart
rip
its w/e
yeah someone cucked it
o its ded
sec let me unpause the last one
i think even if you had 2 maxed green units you wouldnt be able to clear the adds and solo carol
üîé
is there a new hacker? there is someone killing all ym carols with 1 attack with both adds up
Yeah even the tsubasa doesn't help much and there's not much hearts units atm
thats what i do for the dragon raids tbh
kek
just outheal them with  xd shirabe
maria  edge hibiki and  kanade <:herp:448258937314082816>
meanwhile i am swimming in tech though
i am missing 1 more waifu miku for my first nat 5* int
<:grrrr:311273487799025664>  <:alicia:306891337028861972>
i have no good blues
all you people and your x drive hibkis
tell me when to unpause if its not ded
i'll pause
<:herp:448258937314082816>
Oh forgot it was maintenance
uh @ me whoever wants that carol within the next 4 hours i guess so i'll open to friends only
k
<:slokainoose:621288529858920486>

happened to all the channel names
what in gods name
anyone want?

2 awake dojo
enhance gear/memory
comes from
the daily song stones
raid mats?
wtf stones are you talking about
wat
those arent the daily though
it counts
if you feed say chapter 1's paper into it
doesnt have to be LU
the quest is upgrade anything
unupgraded*
you literally have 0 upgraded cards?
you telling me
thats not how it works
wat
whoever gets in and kills it @ me when it dies so i can unpause
i'll purge it after this i guess
99% sure my follower list is full
i am like
uh
anyone want

my game been paused for like a hour
i havent checked
did anyone kill my carol yet
i am more suprised you somehow managed to max all your cards
ib4
he needs a gear
i havent rolled it in weeks
lol
do friend gachas give gear?
i am assuming you arent going to whale/use tickets to roll a gacha
the h one
profit
????
feed into it
buy the miku
do the miku event
uh ? kills
if carol goes first and still oneshots your team
that way you all get the last kill bonus
pause then unpause  when enough of you are in
basicly you go in
die*
i'll start my raid up and pause when its about to start
i added you
added you satoshi
^
<:omegaLUL:420841831111196702>
you full too <@!368681228741640193>  <:shy:448258936710234112>
sure i can wait
<@!174272493777977344>  you full <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
i purged a lot of followers so uh follow me too i guess
i cum cais
i am gona assume my carol is dead then i'll purge my follower list i guess
go in and pause for whoever that wants it
k opened
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
i am pretty whaled out so i never have enough miracles
<:herp:448258937314082816>
oh
<:shock:271085799313768478>
you dont need miracles?

whats your closest unit to it
same i havent counted but i am pretty sure i use at least 7
lol
i actually have 0 welfare at 70
7
i have uh
lol
was a lot of <a:problemsolver:666665387861213207>  to get to where i am
that was me for a lot of hards
its very nice
<:herp:448258937314082816>
i have soloed dragon with 10cp and i have also done like sub 100k dmg with the same team
dragon is very hard
tbh
well its gona be low enough you should be able to kill it
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
sux for you

i paused it
i am still in it
rip
otherwise do 3/5
if you got shit to do/dont care you can start a 10cp and walk away if you wont be touching your phone for a while
i can kill but but if i leave so someone else gets it and i get sniped it would be <:herp:448258937314082816>
it has 100k left on cais
lol
uh wont cai's raid be kinda hard to do unless someone gives up?
k guess its dead so unpause
guess just you two? lol
idk who else wants it
i am pretty sure its physically impossible to finish that loli carol in the next 12 mins or something
or its almost gona time out
uh i dont have a raid up
if i saw 3 5* in my roll you can bet your ass i'd charge more to roll
^
<a:problemsolver:666665387861213207>
my shit is way too diverse

i only have ignite maria aot tsubasa
well technically 2 more but i can ticket one
i need 1 more xd kiri
i only have 2 <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:LUL:445449450849042432>
also wtf which 4 b units do you have? <@!127991170201681920>
there is not enough good rage units to be worth doing rage raids for most people imo
people dont like doing rage because it has no practical use outside of miku
lol
i am outa cp and i dont want to rice
some body uinits at the start helps vs the micha and the other one too
xd hibki/etc
is that loli carol?
i just went in someone loli carol <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

takes me 15-20 mins to reroll a jp acc
i am too lazy to try it because jp for some reason takes way longer to load
<a:HyperThinkRotate:586478611414908948>
there is actually a modded apk for jp but idk if it works
technically yes but no
<:thinkzusa:373279109754781696>
