Hiyo! Welcome here!
I wanna be welcoming too but I think I'm too new.
Thankyou!
Hiyohiyo! My name is Emmy. I like hugs and squishies, and I am kindof an anime newbie.
Hiyo!
Hello. I'm having an odd day today, so I will refrain from properly introducing myself for now, and I will come back to it later.
If someone in your life were to go away forever and ever, would it be better to know about it or not know about it?
