I love it by the way, in case you thought I didn't. Nice edit dude!
First off, yeah this *is* a lot funnier put like this, good point there. On the other, I'm unnerved because I had a pseudo-nightmare of Chris introducing me to her "Friendship" gun, which was a souped up nerf gun that could punch through soft-surfaces, and just woke up from getting shot in the face with it
Gotcha. I've sorta just been lurking in here so I don't have a full grasp on what goes where yet. I'll try to get a handle of things going forward now
Thank you!
Ohhh crap- okay, I'll put anything I make thwre next time. Sorry for the trouble and thanks for the heads up!
That said I'd love to join but it's like nearly 4am in my timezone so I'm off to sleep in a bit
Oooh, well thats surprising, but pleasant to know
I don't know if this is a sign of something or if it's just them being cheeky

Symphogirls in alternative casual clothes is a pleasant sight to see
Darn. Thats a shame. Glad I have a friend who's got it saved at least
