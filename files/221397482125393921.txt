Hi.
Hi everyone.

And one more, because Chris is too adorable.

I wish I did.
Sadly I didn't create that picture.
Sorry but I had to.

I found this really cute picture of Chris.
Our adorable little ray of sunshine.
Happy Birthday, Miku-chan.


I just wanted to get people to vote on the poll to see how many votes we can get.
Sorry.

Someone made this poll a couple of years ago. 
Chris currently has more votes than Hibiki, Kirika and Tsubasa *combined*.







My precious waifu.

Chris, my favorite smol tsundere and my waifu for laifu.
Sorry for the spam but it's Chris's birthday.









If Chris doesn't get a girlfriend for real during Season 5, heads *will* roll.
Chris is my waifu and I want to see her hook up with someone in the series.
So for me, she's still like the seventh wheel.
But she doesn't have anyone for a girlfriend like the others.

Poor Chris is always the third/fifth/seventh wheel.
For those who don't know, Chris and Lisbeth are both voiced by Ayahi Takagaki.
Anyone get the reference in this image, because I do.

Chris is adorable though.





Three chibi Chris's
What do you guys think?
And so is this.
And this is one of my all time favorite Chris pictures.


In the chibi OVA's, Chris is still shorter than everyone else.
Nom nom nom.


I think Chris wants to be hugged too.
Poor Chris getting ignored by the girls she's been working so hard to take care of.

I want to see her finally be happy.
That's why she triggers my protect instinct.
Chris had the saddest backstories of all the girls honestly.
But there's just *something* about Chris not being officially paired with anyone that honestly grinds my gears.

Flustered Chris.
Cutie Chris in glasses.
Somehow despite being 153 cm, as everyone knows, Chris's measurements are 90-57-85.
Without her platform shoes, Chris might actually be only 4'10" or 4'11" or even 4'9", instead of 5'0" (153 cm); it doesn't say whether her height is with the shoes on or off.
Chris looks so shy in this picture. ‚ù§
Height difference. üòÑ

Chris is even blushing.
Cutest cheerleaders.
Flustered/shy/blushing Chris is adorability defined.

But still 65 episodes over 5 seasons is a hell of a good run for an original late night anime.
Maybe we'll get a theatrical movie.
I can't help but feel we may still get a sixth season, even though they're saying XV will be the final season.
<@119492161900118018> You mean Satelight?
Cutie picture.
Both were rerun on several other networks afterwards
A lot of American cartoons from the mid 1980s up until the late 1990s would run for one 65 episode season, then be rerun on other networks for a few years. DiC made several of these, like the original Sonic cartoon and the first season of Inspector Gadget.
65 episodes would air over 13 weeks/3 months in first run syndication. Allowing for each episode to air four times each year.
After the series finale airs, the Symphogear series will have run for 65 episodes over 5 seasons. In the United States, that used to be the standard length for a cartoon to run.
After all this is discussion for XV
But this is starting to get off track. Maybe we should talk more about this in <#336297387863703552>?
I do admittedly have a soft spot for the earlier episodes of Pok√©mon as dubbed by 4Kids back in 1998/1999 or so. Hard to believe I know, but I grew up watching those early episodes
<@!99695384296701952> At least not during the 1980s and 1990s. I‚Äôm sure most of us remember what happened when Sailor Moon was first shown in America (dubbed by DiC)
And it probably would have been edited to fit the American broadcast standard
Key word being might
I mean it might have been able to run in daily weekday syndication
If Symphogear had run 25 or 30 years earlier, it *might* have been in daily syndication, depending on the broadcast standards and practices of each country
Disney Channel used to also have a rule that all their shows had to end after 65 episodes.
Sonic was rerun on Toon Disney through the 1990s and Inspector Gadget was rerun on Nickelodeon up until around 2000.
Does anyone know yet how many copies Volume 1 (Episodes 1 and 2) of XV sold?
If I found someone trash talking Chris, I'd defend my dear waifu to the death.
Well, it's true.
<@!102691114762371072> Sorry, with all the stuff going on for me right now with school and trying to find a job, I'm lucky if I remember what I have for breakfast some days.
Well Chris's color is red, so I assumed.
<@177985945361055744> *i did not like noble red at all* 
Is that a slur against Chris?
http://www.someanithing.com/series-data-quick-view
Those sales are of course average sales per volume.
Here's what I know about Symphogear's sales so far.
* Season 1 - 5,045 (original) + 3,841 (re-release) = 8,886
* Season 2 (G) - 8,701 (original) + 3,795 (re-release) = 12,496
* Season 3 (GX) - 14,229; tenth best selling anime of 2015
* Season 4 (AXZ) - 14,792; sixth best selling anime of 2017
I also love how Chris became like a surrogate big sister to Kirika and Shirabe.

Thank you so much!
Really?
Yes.
How do I transfer a torrent into a file I can watch.
I suck at torrents.
Oh it's a torrent.
Take your time.
Where?
I wish I knew Japanese.
I found one Ayahi pun video.

You can't spell "charisma" without "Chris".
Does anyone know where I can find clips of Ayahime making puns?
Chris gained serious moe points from G onward.

<@!476058996315389953> <@!99695384296701952>
I saw you mention Chris/Tsubasa at one point earlier.
I should mention it was Tsubasa who actually managed to convince Chris to perform in G Episode 4.
<@!476058996315389953> <@!99695384296701952> What were you guys talking about?
I know but.
I don't know why, I'm just really upset for some reason. I was hoping that it would break AXZ's record, but now that's not going to happen and it might end up as the second lowest selling season overall, only beating S1.
AXZ's V1 made up more than 20% of its total series sales.
If that trend continues, XV will only average around 7,800 per volume.
To me that still sounds pretty vindictive.
Even with the lottery.
I don't think they were before.
But for me it hurts to see the series lose so much steam at the finish line.
There probably won't be another live event.
I read it got somewhere to near 25k before the cancellations started.
So people cancelled their orders because they were pissed about no live tickets.
Regardless of the lack of lottery tickets.
That is NOT good no matter how you slice it.
XV dropped almost 50%
Volume 1 of AXZ sold over 21,000.
Actually third or fourth.
But this is the final season, and it has gone up in sales every season until now. It hurts that a lot of fans abandoned the series basically.
But considering even without bonuses, subsequent volumes still usually drop off substantially.
5,045, 8,701, 14,229, and 14,792.
That's a **huge** disappointment in my book considering its the final season.
If it drops over the volumes similar to AXZ, XV might drop to below 8,000 per volume.
Now it probably will end up sub 10,000 average by the time the last volume comes out.
But still I didn't expect a nearly 50% drop.
I think it's safe to say that the series is going out with a whimper sales wise.
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
How could this happen honestly?
It might not even reach 10k series average at this rate. I think its popularity has finally run out.
http://www.someanithing.com/11027
Volume 1 of XV only sold 11,357. That is down an alarming 48 percent from Volume 1 of AXZ's 21,731.
It's all settled now <@506219877724454929>
I guess I was in denial <@!102691114762371072>, I mean it should have been obvious to me from the start why XV dropped so hard.
<@!102691114762371072> I know you're pissed at me, but I'm sorry, I really am.
I don't like being accused of looking for sympathy.
I'm sorry this discussion turned into shit.
I don't think before I act a lot.
I should have kept my fucking mouth shut. But nooo, I just **had** to whine and vent about it.
ü§¶
The VA don't make the decisions though.
There won't be a final live. I think 2018 was the final one.
I'm sorry.
XV will end up as the second lowest selling of the series.
If XV drops below 10k for V2, then there's no hope.
I'm sorry, I'm just still upset.
I'm sorry if I'm pissing people off, I'm just really butthurt for some reason.
That's still the lowest total since S1 for a V1 for the series.
G sold over 13k V1.
I was just hoping that the final season would be the biggest selling of the series.

But Chris was so adorable and huggable while she was singing that it made me go "Awww"
<@!102691114762371072>
I hated DMJii after that scene for stealing Chris's rightful title of Queen of the Stage.
Sorry about that.
üòÖ
Well...yes. Just because no one seemed to notice. Sorry about that.
Also fun fact: The Neptunia anime was animated by David Production, the studio who animates Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.
The Neptunia anime dub was directed by Mike McFarland, who also served as script writer along with Clint Bickham and Blair Rowan.
Good night <@456226577798135808>
IMO, I'm glad they did, because Neptune just wouldn't have been the same if Melissa Fahn didn't voice her.
I bought the anime from Amazon a couple of weeks ago, and Funimation actually managed to get most of the California cast to reprise their roles.
<@456226577798135808>
Tia also voiced Peashy in the Neptunia anime, and she did a damn good job, every bit as good as Sandy Fox (who voices her in the Neptunia games).
Tia Ballard, voice of Happy the Cat, voices her and even sings as her, in the English dub.
I didn't know.
Sorry.
I think Mizore is one of the reasons the Rosario and Vampire manga sells so well here in North America, and I'm sorry for using that word.
Some of my favorite Kugimiya characters are her non-tsundere roles, like Hasuta from Haiyore Nyaruko-San (one of her few trap characters), Yuki from Saki (taco loving loli), and especially Mizore from Rosario and Vampire (great example of a kuudere, and the easy favorite for most Western Rosario and Vampire fans)
But he's not a tsundere IIRC.
Taiga from Toradora was SO much better because at least she improved her behavior over the series,
One character I really don't like is Louise from The Familiar of Zero. Worst. Tsundere. Ever.
