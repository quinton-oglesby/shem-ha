<a:ChrisbangsHibikitoo:658015525582143509>
It's the size of an emote basically
It's bad here but looks good in emote
Another possible emote for Melua to review whenever they are not busy in the future
Those. Should work


Apparently when I resaved them from discord. It made them bigger.  <@99695384296701952> let me see if I have the OG on my phone dtill
i wish i could brighten up the gifs tho. i feel like some of them are kinda dark
oh i wont. i just threw them there cause a few people have mentioned wanting to use them. i like to share
if they get rejected. ah well, i can still use them on my own server 🙂
i mean for normal emotes i could see that but i guess i personally barely see anyone use gifs in line. i'm just posting them cause melua said there was plenty of room for them.
i mean.. do the 10 bears really do anything?
~~does it really when we have 50 gif slots?~~
if alone and in their bigger form its quite nice. if smaller with text. i would agree tho
<a:chris_hug:653964713578987540>
<a:MariaSlap:655471203032760320>
<@!246146781832806401> i find them quite easily actually





i forgot to send my gifs here. here ya go. theyve already been shrunk to discord size
<a:test1:663883518396334100>

I vote for. Never talk to me, my dagger or my knife ever again. Cause tsubasa is the sword. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Once added it'll be my most used hibiki emot3 I bet
U see nothing
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Whiskeys idea. It's a great choice for an emote
I liked number 2 lily
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>

I wish I started practicing when I was 7 so I would be a master of the ~~lewd~~ art
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I wish I was talented at drawing
Teach me how to draw ~~lewd~~ amazing art like that
Bruh
I'm guessing u had to paint it to make it look that good
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
A 1/60 hg
Oh an R-Jarja. I love the pilot of that
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<@316755282716000266> I need info on that burning
Meer > lacus any day
That burning Gundam looks massive. Is that the standard mg or did they make a pg without me knoeing
Oh I see
Said*
That's the PG strike u sao
I love your lacus shelf
Ohhh an sd gold astray. How cute
Can you find it? Lol

Hey I also have the tryon 3
I want hi nu so badly
Bruh those master gradea
We need more master grade grunts. Gimme a tieren, flag, Dinn, etc
Mobile suit *
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
Ohhhh A tieren!
Yea. I basically have all the good ones from build divers minus 00 Diver Ace
I'm glad his kit didn't suck either. Quite a few of the build kits are bad xD

Okay cosmik. I got the two pictures
<@173112001684439040> these mechs better combine
<@316755282716000266> I'm gonna go take a pic of everything i got In a group shot
Possibly
I plan to practice on my hg I didn't like to get some experience
Sometimes an RG if I like it
<@316755282716000266> I have a lot. I upgraded from hg to MG only

<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I get it now
Ohhh
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Are u a time Traveller?
The box of shame

<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Cause it's snap fit doesn't really fit
One of those kits you really need to glue together
I just recently built the Lancelot from code Geass. (It makes me so mad)
Interesting. I always like trying out non Gundam kits from bandai
Shining Gundam 2.0 kit please Japan ;-;
Also a fan of the Shining Gundam. That makes me happy. I honestly prefer it to the burning
I see I see. I would kill for an MG Flag
Hail Zeon!
Or the chunkiness of ZZ series
I know. I just love the hugeness of CCA and Unicorn
I wish crossbones weren't so smol
How's shine ojou?
Also I just realized meluas name is latooni
<@486087033652248576>  <@99695384296701952> what suits do u like?
I'll be working on my guncannon next
Thank u voyuer

<@316755282716000266> I tried my hand at a gold plated model kit  definitely going to have to repaint it to hide all the black nub marks. It was interesting building a kit from 20 years ago tho
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I got all of first wave. Can't wait for second and third wave
<@316755282716000266>

Oh Kaiser bandai just released an action figure line called Gundam universe. They're pretty good quality for 25 bucks. Quite large too. I took a comparison shot if you are ever interested in buying one. Has a lot of detail to bring out with paint or a marking pen
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
Not enough waifus obviously
Ok
What's the issue?
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
But lots of fun too. How long were u at it for?
It is mentally tiring I agree
The one on the far right

But yea u usually cut them to have a little bit of plastic left then shave it down with a knife like this
Usually something similar to this

I mean most people use hobby cutters
<:CoconaSweat:480753608023998472>
Oh
What kind of nippers are u using?
Oh the extra plastic. To get rid of the nubs a lot of people shave it down with a blade. Then sand it with a sanding stick.
I love the hobby
It's crazy what u can get for 10-20 bucks vs 10 years ago
I do think the advancement of gunpla has been huge ever since they retooled the whole thing when Gundam build fighters started
I'd tighten up the left elbow a little personally. Have the shield pointing upwards a bit
Not bad
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
Now u need an RG sazabi and an MG sazabi
I actually watched a YouTube video from a guy who reviews gunpla on how to pose
Since I don't have a ton of room to pose. I tend to leave them standing at attention. Which is actually harder than u think to pose naturally
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
The base is seperate. It's just showing how to use the connector piece to attach it to the gunpla to put onto an action base
Like each shelf is a different series
I wanna turn this into a much more cohesive collection
<:emithumbsup:775400079552282664>
But the shelf filler is meant to be looked at
Better for someone else to play them than sit on my shelf doing nothing forever
Im selling my ps2 game collection and buying robotd with it lol
I want to buuld penelope but i literally have no space for it

Ill get to work on ZZ this weekend
<@87512939107450880> sorry cypher. No ham for u
3 votes ZZ. One vote hamma hamma
<:GermainAngry:689199996653928451>

<@208724042025402369> be the tie breaker

I thought ~~nana mizuki~~ tsubasa was decently tall. Or is it only cause shes surrounded by short lol

I would love shirabe to get a massive growth spurt and end up the tallest of the girls with her straight black hair

Movie then
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Can't wait for them to surprise announce a season 6 and tell the animators to top these seasons transformations
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I can't wait for shirabes. I loved the incorporation of her yoyos before
More like DESSSSSSSSSSS
I love kirikas pose when she got the X on her helmet
~~good~~
~~dumbell anime is great~~
Dayum that kiri transformation. Major props was not expecting it to be that ~~lewd~~ good.
Inb4 Dr. Ver was god all along
God is emperor palpatine
Rip favorite character
~~this isn't death, this is making sure humankind lives~~
Need to finish it up so I can get onto XV
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Well that's good cause I don't have axz at all
Did YT do earlier seasons?
Never did the two normal routes
Finished the first one. With the secret route
Me too
Brings a tear to me eye
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
FMP and ar tonelico? Everyone here is so Cultured.
True. But Serena never had a full on transformation sequence either lol
It just feels like Maria doesn't really have anything unique to her when it comes to transformations
~~oof~~
I kind of have an idea how they'll do the future chars. Shirabe yoyos, Chris gunplay, tsubasa swordplay, but Maria I honestly have no clue what they'll do for her
~~look at what they did to Dess~~
~~you know she's gonna get lewded~~
I wonder if they will have Chris go even more sailor moon esque with her transformation like in GX
~~a whole pack of dogs~~
She better walk the dog
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
So who's transformation will be tomorrow
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I still wish shirabe went full Mecha but that'll never happen again
Thanks voyuer now I got Gundam X music stuck in my head lol
~~satellite cannon... TIFA!~~
Somehow
Dope brb
Oh snap shirabes was also in this episode? I literally stopped after Chris transformation
Yea it was probably ~~lewder~~ longer
Nice place to put bullets lol
Well that was an interesting transformation for chris
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Well elfnein is still alive so they don't even want to fix what's broken
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Rinse and repeat same formula 5 seasons
Only in finale
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
No. I'm just watching the transformations
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
Oh I see. I should watch axz eventually
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Is ignite gone?
They stole your idea
Lol
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Kinda like how those machine pistols appeared after that special of her watching an action dvd
She probably watched a movie and thought it looked cool
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I loved the ice skates for shirabe. And her heart then telling you to die
Kirikas looked complete outside the stone but Chris does look like she's missing a bunch
Well Any excuse to watch the chris and kirika one again later
Interestinf
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
But why does shirabe get the Season 1 silouette?
Holy shit shirabes was dope
Her dad is a tool and the mom should've never taken him back
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Well transformations give you a free barrier to protect yourself
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
<@486087033652248576> is that impressive for you? Or sad for the show writers?
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>

*galaxy brain*
Inb4 each season is it's own timeline and none of them are connected
I appprove
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<@486087033652248576> she is almost T posing to assert dominance
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Remember season one 2nd to last episode when Fine was not synced up to her mouth at all? It was just flapping wildly
~~youd die~~
That stomp is so gud
hell yea voy
Like when kiri leans back and BAM
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Kiri and hibiki had solid impacts to their transformation too.
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Not everyone is cultured poi
~~grenedier did it first~~
The weapon itself is cool but I feel like it didn't contribute to her transformation
The lasers part changing the ground seemed eh
Not enough gunplay either
Or the choreography of kiris
It feels like it goes by way too fast even tho it's the same length. And doesn't have the camera work that hibiki or shirabe have imo
I'm actually going to give my least favorite to chris
I think bikis along with the initial music of her song makes for such a strong impact
I'm debating hibikis or shirabes atm
So out of the 4 shown which transformation is your favorite
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<@231025503643893770> what they aren't showing u is that another Chris is holding the guns behind her head. Can't even trust yourself
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
They all gonna go gold?
Hyper mode ?
X Driver operation?
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Loved hearing her OG song again
Remember when she lowered her output to use Season 1 Gear in G?
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
If Maria was a guy she'd have so many in anime old man jokes cause shes in her twenties
Not just teens!
Adults can accomplish things too japan!
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Maria needs to step in to be jobbed like she always is
Shirabe is always cute
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
So since they gave us two transformations this episode. Think we'll get the last two next episode?
Anyone find it amusing that shirabe has to physically move a part of her gear for her transformation?
I'm not mad. Just disappointed
I swear my phone loves changing real words into other words
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Yoyo ice skating, pole dancing, martial arts, ~~red stuff?~~
I almost feel like they didn't know where to take Chris transformation
Gave a lot of depth to the area
The camera work helped a lot too
But has the most impact imo
Dess
Paused for a second. Gotta love random frames
~~Ignite~~ Operation
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
X-Drive Operation
What would they call it if it's not Normal Operations. Advanced Operation?
You cheating on Latina Phoenix? ~~HOW DARE U~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I love her outfits
Like her clothes
~~she was already fine... Wait~~
I honestly hate seeing couples that are incapable of doing things on their own ever
Irl 1v1 rite meow
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
And that's why this anime sucks
Hibiki > kirika > shirabe > chris
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
You know that part of their transformation where the heart shatters? That happened to me. It never  came back together.
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
<@132577277262168064> what heart?
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I have too much time in my hands
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
So I timed all the transformations from the white background part (since they don't all have the heart breaking) to their gear symbol pose. And they all clock in at 37 second minus Chris who actually clocks in at 40. Which I thought she was going to have less time.
I'm gonna ping u in anime club phionex
~~too many good animes this season~~
I KNOW
That gif is probably from one of my favorite moments in Comedy movies
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
She kept a few reloads in her bosom as well
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh. Like all real women
Her bust isn't that huge lol
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
So where does she get more bullets from
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
I would put it closer to a third but that's way better than kiri who's like the last 5 seconds. Chris was around 12 or so showing off.
But yes kiri doesn't really have anything going for her
Mm... I mean they both really only showed anything near the end
Hmm I would say Chris beats out kiri barely cause a good portion for the camera is revolving around her curves all over but that me. It's a close match imo
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Hibiki is the only safe one
I mean shirabes ice skating has many parts that are definitely angling her to show off her butt. And Chris is full of oppai fanservice
I honestly think shirabe has more fan service than kiri but I guess I don't see the pole dancing as fanservice and more of just dancing myself.
Also the one thing shirabes transformation is lacking is the transition for her arm armor. I feel like they skip over that
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
<@189146272865845248> always
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I didnt
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
V is for victory
~~i personally want vanessa~~
Shell be the one character hibiki gets to join the good side
For Maria or Chris to sit in
Tsubasa transformation should include a motorbike
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Think I realize why I enjoy kirika and hibiki transformations over chris. They have unique noises for every part of their body but Chris uses the same noise
Hibiki is also a pointy nendo
I don't mind that. Once u see it once for new attacks I don't need it again
Bruh
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I saw zoid and for a second was excited we were talking about zoids
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Thanks for giving me the credit keupho
By voyer
I agree there's nothing like this tho
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
We don't like to call it stealing. We call it inspired by other work
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
I've posted grenadier a few times. Guess kanade wasn't around for it
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
It's like... The duo of lolis are more popular in Japan vs an adult female
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
For real. Why Maria never get to do anything
LOLOL
~~I wonder if anyone will get that refrence~~
I CAN SEE THE FUTURE
The last thirds relic is dead
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
~~but they dead~~
~~dont worry there's always maria~~
I agree the gun part has the best sound effects
She gets to die in mikus arms. Happy ending!
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Tory
Looks like u get coal instead
<:HibikiPadoru:516438720082346004>
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
~~they need to keep kanade company. She's lonely~~
No bulli pls
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I don't like when everything ends hunky dory. I like bittersweet stuff
Like that episode when hibiki lost her arm. I was like oh sheet! How they gonna continue? Oh. She just grew it back. Nevermind
~~pleade be dark and bloody and kill off everyone so they have no way to give 6th season~~
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
<@185949743321579520> Screw the rules! I have green hair!
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I still hate that episode
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Remember when RHB got used as a club?
Hope u sleep well the rest of the week
It's okay nin. It's gear. We understand
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Everyone should sleep better. It's important.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Dogs woke me up like 4 hours earlier than I usually wake up.
Probably lack of sleep today
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ohyoyo
Honto no koto sa!
Yeap
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Maria's transformation was bursting with energy
I want Maria's song. It's so good
~~western Symphogear BDs when?~~
Seeing as people are still around. Not enough
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Genjuro did sing once
Fixed*
Genjuro Duet with ver
Oh right
<:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
~~Fudo duet with Ver~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I mean. We could always have Ver back
And at some point Carolnein will become one and do a song
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
So I predict the other two alchemists will be in Chris and kirikas gears. Maria will get a Serena duet. Shirabe with Fine. And tsubasa/kanade
I believe in you milaarc. Best SGs score!
Oh I c
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
I thought it was a confirmed 100k
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
It's okay tho she helped hibiki punch without her arms. All is forgiven  <@185949743321579520>
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
It feels weird wanting hibiki to convince these villians cause they totally have the most blood on their hand vs any other seasons villians
Who would've thought big breasts was hibikis one true weakness
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I hope this duet gives an excuse to bring back other dead people
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
When XV ends this needs to be the new lewd bot command.
I'm particular to ByeBye Lullaby
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
As kanade said. Don't give up!
They wanted u to wake up to good news! <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>   <@486087033652248576>
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
You'll become tsubasas number one fan if there aren't anymore alive.
Rip Maria lol
Vanessa for me
Thank u <@102691114762371072>
Having a flaac of Rebirth Day makes me so happy. I love this song
Gotcha
So when u guys say B side are u referring to the non vocal versions?
Sometimes I wish I could get the anime versions where the song is sung actiony
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
30% there.
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Loading up my computer now. Then I'll transfer to phone for my walks
What plays flac? VLC?
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
10 gbs?
Where's a good place to get all the songs?
~~cant judge the AXZ or XV songs fully yet tho since I haven't heard them completely~~
I think Chris and Maria I've consistently liked all of their Gear songs
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Remember the knife shadow attack tsubasa had? Good times
It forgot to detail the back armor at all tho.
But man tsubasas was very red and blue. I loved ig
Otherwise I enjoyed it
But that's just me
Like the arms never really transition properly to her arm armor. And the twintail armor fails to make a satisfying noise when it closes.
Shirabes has a few minor problems that put her at 4th for me
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
My list would be Hibiki > Kirika > Tsubasa > Shirabe > Maria > Chris
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Man after seeing it im sadly going to say Chris has the weakest transformation for me personally of the 6
Just saw tsubasas transformation. Holy sheet!
*goes to bed*
You're right
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Okey.
All her male fans would get a mini fan? <:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
Umm..
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
But... I'm an adult
I'm still confused
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Lykwim = look you know what I mean?
~~tfw Chris most unique thing is her armor purging~~
Her Gatling guns are still the coolest. ~~and that's not cause it reminds me of Kos-Mos~~
The machine pistols were so out of nowhere xD. And disappeared as fast as they came
But like how does she make her gear make new guns lol
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
Does Chris make her gear give her new guns or does the gear force Chris to use new guns?
Rip beef stroganoff
Googled it. I completely forgot that part happened
I also like cross ange unironically. It was a crazy trip. Also I don't remember that part of valvrave honestly.
Well remember when carol died in GX and had all her memories back in her new body? Why wouldn't there be a memory back up
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
I still haven't watched axz
I apologize
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Maybe elfnein will forget she's garbage and do something for once
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I just got a YouTuber video about carol in XV...WHAT
<:pepederp:545099288598806568>
Like wut
I honestly love cross ange cause if you told me after the first episode that it was going to be about different planets fighting together to defeat an unkillable god. I would not believe u
Pretty sure tsubasa is referring to cross ange
<:514889603879141377:608274768801562643>
Someone else who actually likes cross ange
<:regretkan:535364298046832650>
I know it's impossible but I would love to see some fan art of symphogear at my anime convention this year.
~~you monster~~
Okey
<:puganda:449885175136911361>
I always thought they should've made carol an alter ego to elfnein but apparently they thought of that too now.
I see.
<:thonks:281677601116913664>
<@122102398108827653> if carol forgets gravity exists does she have to abide by it's rules?
<:NotLikeThis:298461872305340418>
But she burned her memories once when she lost to hibiki. Then burned them again in the second fight. She even states she forgot why she even wanted revenge after their first fight.
<:Kongou:585711500535267329>
<@506219877724454929> is that a MHA abridged refrence?
*becomes immortal and opens a black hole to trap myself in*

<:exbri:449883653678301197>
<@99695384296701952>but magic. That's all they need to explain
<:smuglucy:449882231817764864>
There a lot of problems with Symphogear. But we love it anyways

I'll be in anime club if anyone wants to chat about random shows
I'm gonna go now since I'm just talking animes and not XV
But appreciated
Remember when slayers got a bunch of seasons and movies/OVAs back in the day? That was very dofferent
I do appreciate it burger gundam meister
<:baka:537471150024949760>
I genuinely enjoyed it Kine!
<:doge:496780220309962772>
<@83626774000308224> if you told me this anime somehow got 5 seasons while I was watching the first one I wouldn't believe it lol
i want that song
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I'm not even subbed to Crunchyroll but I keep getting their vids
i need to block crunchyroll on youtube. they just spoiled the Comeback of characters

Does Japan have the death penalty
Like the genes where you're gauranteed to get cancer cause it runs in the family etc. ?

Upon reading it. Sounds a lot like old Germany ways

Japan sounds way safer than USA if they haven't had a killing like this in 20+ years
You take a life. U don't deserve to live imo.

<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
You know thinking about it, why is prostitution illegal still. Job professions are very diverse and kinda vague in this day in age. You can make tons of money if you make videos you post on the internet as a profession (if you're good/lucky)
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@256945399338631168> that doesn't add up.
I wonder if making it a legit profession reduces criminals from doing it. Cause u know when things are illegal, (bad) people love taking advantage of it.

You know I'm happy a bought a ton of Sentai anime a couple weeks ago. They're a good company (from what I can tell) also happy to donate towards the kyoani GoFundMe.

Wish I could just scrub my brain of all that

oh man that... I don't even know where I land with all the Vic stuff.
For anyone to answer. I'm genuinely curious
Do voices actors doing bad things outside of their role in anime sour your enjoyment of said anime?

Whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty
You're right. I forgot about that
Our world is so messed up
I feel like sex scandals are barely a thing(I know they still are please don't kill me). Like u need to murder someone nowadays to have a negative effect.
I don't know why naraaa pfp males me smile so much. It's so cute xD

A man wanting to be a woman or vice versa seems very different than literally destroying a portion of your body so u can never properly funcion again
Who said I'm praying she survives >.>
She apparently gets paid for disability. Which makes no sense in my brain
Stealing that naraaa

<@279341087494242304> thank you. I would've worked my butt off for twice the pay I get now.
I don't think I've ever gotten a call rejection. Usually email or actual mail.
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I just had the interview yesterday so it was a quick rejection
Thank u Mel Mel.
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
It's always a shitty feeling when u get the email saying you didn't get the job
Hey it's the thought that counts. Never donate when it hurts yourself. Take care of yourself before you take care of others
That's awesome to hear dunkek
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
<@476058996315389953> thank you for always being around when I bulli elfnein
U reminded me of that old memory haha
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I had a job where we couldn't accept cash tips so a lady gave me a package of muffins and said this isn't money so I could have it lol
True. In the end someone benefits from my selfish desires
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I enjoy the endorphins for making someone else happy. So I selfishly look for opportunities to be helpful to get that feeling
Yea it's that
This is difficult to talk about. I agree with melua
I tried to put my thoughts on the subject into words but now I'm starting to think I'm in the same camp as fizzy.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I just stepped on a scale since I started this desk job 9 months ago. I've gained 10-15  pounds. I need to diet
Reading fizzy situation. I would agree with just cutting him out and not bothering. Your life, your time. You're better off doing thing you want to do or people to talk to. No point in wasting more breath on this dude. ~~i don't condone violence be he sounds like someone who will push the wrong persons button and get a nice punch to the face~~
We've had 250 shootings already this year in America apparently. Jesus

Isn't the dislike supposed to inform the content creator of what their fans didn't enjoy to help them avoid that in the future?
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
The whole Hollywood scene is full of trash people but we still watch movies and what not. So if he makes entertainment I'll probably still watch it if it's entertaining.
<@193408538909868033> I'm with ya there in the confliction. Either this is a genuine video. Or this is a manipulative video to save his career. Could go either way.
Oh hey I just finished watching this.

GameStop gonna be closing 2400 stores by the end of Q4 (or start of next Q1)
So many people are gonna be out of a job
i feel like the UN should be more focused on more imporant matters than that. But then again i couldnt even fathom how they do things in a council (is that the correct word?) thats about the entire world.
thank you for the info melua. gonna make sure to not even go here to laugh at them. i dont want to give them the traffic
gross
outside of Siliconera. i dont visit gaming journo sites. usually get my info off of gaming news youtubers
place
OAG sounds like an awful
i feel like people complain about games more than actually playing games anymore. (at least the crazy internet)
i think i heard of the site once or twice in passing but have never seen an article or ever been there.
oh wow i was right. i was just trying to guess an acronym
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
One angry gamer?
^
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
It's like worse kotaku
I wouldn't know this site existed if not for people sending me links to crazy articles
From the couple I've seen. I would agree with you.
Oh I see.
Figured it would be best to ask you here rather than gaming for clarification. <@99695384296701952> but what's an anime alt right?
way to make your system fail
the pass thing just sounds like a loophole right from the get go. like why even allow them? xD
thats news to me lol
uk tried to have a porn check?
<:sip:597321444761796609>
as well
true, unless they startetd policing the internet
i would hope if they did a ban it would only encompass the animes that had a loli sexualized and not the animes that just happen to have a loli character in it. but bans tend to be all encompassing so they'd probably remove those too
like was the ban removing any children/young character from media? im pretty clueless on their end goal
sitting here im trying to think whats worse. that or when they have over developed younger kids. like 14 year old Yoko
especially when they still act their age they look. even tho theyre 300+ years old
i hate that trope for characters so much
yea thats about as far as i got in my own brain
can you elaborate the acronym CSEM? ive never seen it before
as i dont go on reddit. no i dont astolfo
rip owning my favorite animes on blu ray if that ever did happen
rip all magical girl shows
no i dont nin. give people an inch and they will take a mile.
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
i showed him characters from symphogear and he thinks Hibiki is 12
<@!476058996315389953> i actually have a couple of friends like that. i showed them adults from animes and they thought they were kids cause of the larger eyes. only the squinter adults looked like adults to them.
noice
xD
porn rots your brain obviously
kanade i also heard that about the post WWII thing
i guess i never saw it that way since pornagraphy was just a term. Adult porn is fine. but if you change it to child its bad. i didnt see it as connecting porn as bad personally
i like using them in games
battlesaxes are indeed cool
<:EveNom:492393235801571328>
i didnt know either
human race isnt the most graceful thing when it comes to the general masses lol
lgbt panic defense... this is new to me
<@!102691114762371072> legal defense for what exactly? that just crazy
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
wait... this says he murdered his boyfriend. i remember meeting his wife and kid when she dropped off his lunch once.
self defense is something else cause youre defending your own life from harm
he didnt go to court
it was a no contest plea
<@279341087494242304>
Nope, he got a 10 year sentence for second degree murder. His attorney said this was a Great Deal. how often do you see someone get 10 years for this?
wait. let me read more. this article isnt written well. going to another site
oh thats his parole. he has a 50 year term
<@279341087494242304> he only got 10 years
you know i dont even know how much time he got. im gonna look it up. i remember he was in the news for my town
you never really know someone though
its scary cause before i changed jobs he was my best coworker bud
oh yea hes in jail
it escalated from an arguement into a knife fight
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
i had an ex coworker kill his roommate over an arguement
people will hate for less than someones identity. we're a very petty race
people hate things they dont understand
Jesus
What's gaslighting?

My dad is a narcissist. He's a dick bag and nobody will be sad when he's gone
~~narcissists don't I bet~~
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
I cringe at my past self
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
<@266379640069685252> I still am
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
You know I quite enjoy the talks here. Seeing so many view points from so many people. I learn quite a bit. Think about things I normally wouldn't have. I appreciate you all.
<@203444794737950720> the only time I could see it applicable and even that it's still not. Is this one story I saw was this gay male would purposely hit on and try to do things to younger guys to confuse them about their possible sexual orientation. He enjoyed doing that to guys. That's messed up.
<@472513526393602059> yes
Oh one other thing I meant to ask. Is Cis a new term or is it something that's been around awhile and just started to be used more recently? I feel like I never heard of it until like last year
Oh I see
<@102691114762371072> what would've been the correct way to word that sentence then? (For future reference)
my b
yea i read that after the fact
im not the best at english
i mean i also said A cis. but whateves lol
so im going to guess this is if a guy or girl took out someone they thought was a cis but was a trans. so they get angry and do something bad?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
its messed up
being nice takes no effort, some people LOVE the feeling of making someone feel awful instead
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
90% of people on the internet wouldnt be dicks if they could get punched thru their computer monitor
or fear the reprocussions of pissing off someone irl
thats why i say people are more interested in arguing
people are more interested in winning an arguement rather than seeing the other sides view point in a debate sadly

i see
we all have our imperfections
~~nobody is. its okay~~
i dont think u need to worry about that with us melua but noted nonetheless.
well take a bully for example. a lot of bullies (not all) are usually bullied themselves by like family or someone they know. they want to feel like they have power instead of feeling helpless all the time
they really arent
but yea trying to apply logic to humans sadly doesnt work most of the time
lolol
some people just want to see the world burn
in their eyes
none. but depending on the person they need it to feel validated cause their actual life has nothing going for it
~~i just ignore the live action and enjoy the originals instead~~
Doesn't help that beauty and the beast was actually a complete remake of the animated movie too
Can't confirm or deny since I don't watch many movies

Anyone have a recommendation for getting out of depression? I got yelled at at work. And going to get talked to on Halloween about this and other issues I apparently have. I've been laying in bed for like 5 hours doing nothing. I feel dead inside.

i heard movies like Frozen did very well there. so theres an audience at least
Watching a Disney movie with a Japanese dub. its so weird to my brain xD

Guess I'll take the test too when I'm at my desk and not on my phone

Lotus answered almost every question without being in the middle. Interesting
Well actually discord closed the test when I swapped tabs on my phone. So its over lol
basically, just don't be a garbage parent. and your kid will be fine.
yea theyre kids/babies. they just want to play and have fun. not care about politics/adult things.
took me a hot minute to remember what you were replying to. im in the camp with trueblade, with it not sounding right to me as well. But people can do what they want, just cause that person does it doesnt mean i have to. it aint hurting anyone.

Miso a grandpa
Speaking of R rated stuff. I really hated when parents would come into the game store I worked at and buy M rated games for their 10 year olds. You know GTA has murder, drug pedaling, tons of violence and nudity. And then the parent is like, yea that's okay.
Being a good parent? Nah it's the teacher/government/wherever I ams fault
What's responsibility?
~~yes phone. Please autocorrect a real word into something else.~~
I'm gonna sue!
My daughter is scarred for life!
HoW cOuLd ThIs MoViE tHeAtEr SeLl Me ThOsE tIcKeTs!
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
Or the idiot parents who get mad at R rated movies when they bring their kids... Like what did u expect?
But for real. The amount of parents that don't even bat an eye at these games is insane
I was like 9 too. Whoops
<:doge:496780220309962772>
I used to rent games from this one off store that also rented out anime. And I accidentally rented hentai once. It looked like a generic fantasy anime on the cover. No warnings
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
M rated games barely existed when I was a kid. It was basically Doom and mortal Kombat. That's about it
And then the parent drags their kids ass out if the store. God that was so satisfying
Those are the good parents
Yea the few clueless parents that when I explained it and they're like.. WHAT. And then get super mad at their kid.
People will do anything if u pay them enough
~~also I had to Google terf~~

Rich people/companies are the ones who know how to avoid taxes the best. Which is so messed up
Not with that attitude
Such sad individuals
Humans make no damn sense
Back reading... Why do people waste their freetime doing this? Like I get out of work and want to relax. Not get on the internet and try to dox random people across the earth.
~~isnt every candidate problematic in some way?~~
A lot of people believed Bernie would've won if he faced off against trump. I wonder what the past few years had been like if that was true

Actual question about the group since I have no knowledge and i wanted to know, but The Q in LGBTQ stands for Queer doesn't it? I thought that was a deragatory term. Or has it been taken back and normalized?

Usually just once a day tho
I do eat

I miss pop
Probably just showed how poorly my diet was if this was such a difference for basically a month
Which always drops super fast when u cut all the bad food from your diet
I agree. Half of it I feel like was water/sugar weight
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Thank you. I started mid to late december.
I have lost 20ish pounds. And I need 10 more to lose (of fat). I'm at 18% body fat. Looking to get to 10%.
Cause I'm tired of being fat but too lazy to work out
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I said fuck it to eating. And I've been doing very well at dieting. So I understand that sentiment
Grats fizzy!
*dies in embarrassment*
If mine dropped dead. I wouldn't care
At least you want to spend time with your dad
~~yu you hakusho was almost perfect until that final arc~~

I shit on Symphogear sometimes cause it has lots of room to improve.
Thats messed up.
I would ask that person. What makes them perceive that. And why would it matter if we both enjoy the anime
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Also I would like to be able to criticize things I like that could be improved without making others feel like I'm attacking them
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<@263983345669505025> why must people make everything a competition. I'm just happy someone likes the thing I like and we can talk about it.
Good luck voyeur
I should burn these posters
How dare I have the gall to try to own edelgard. Very misogynistic of me
Ikr?
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
But sure
*doesn't totally own edelgard posters I bought at a convention*
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
My best example was when we discussed FE three houses and both ended up loving Edelgard. But apparently she loved edelgard more than me and that wasn't up for debate.
You*
It's more. There's no way y like this as much as me
No no
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
My favorite people are ones who think 100% they like a character or show more than another person

But yea. That woman needs to check herself
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
It started serious
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Some people just get type casted hard. Oh a Loli? It's a good chance is the same woman who did shana and taiga
They have to have a uniqueness to their voice to stand out. Or they sound EXACTLY the same in basically every roll they play. Like Maria
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I love when hibiki gets to play villians. Like that one chick in season 1 of overlord

Right? Not everything is for everyone
And here I use YouTube to watch people open Pokemon packs from my childhood
I feel like she-ra had that issue. Was too heavy handed into the girlpower. Steven universe balanced it better
Probably the mentality. Hey it works already. Why try to fix what isn't broken.
~~at least that's what I hope~~
That's usually just the vocal minority extremes on both sides.
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
You'll sadly always find people who hate on anything that's popular cause it's the cool thing to do
It's a magical girl show with a boy instead of a girl. Not gonna be for everyone. I think the fandom itself is why A lot of people don't try it. It's pretty toxic from what Ive seen. Which is a shame
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm glad sub saw the light
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Hibiki talks how she hasn't gotten a boyfriend yet. So I agree rady
My joke was not received
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
And u liked it?

It's part parenting and part environment they grow up in imo. Cause u could have good parents but where u live could really mess up your views on stuff. And vice versa.

~~i blame those participation awards in schools and poor parenting~~
Yea people want to win an argument. Not have a conversation/debate to see other opinions
Show ended at the Black Arc. Nuff said

<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
But when does an online person go from stranger to friend.
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I guess we should've clarified if we were talking about online people or just people in general.
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
I guess I'm a glass half full kind of guy
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Unless that specific person has reason to doubt them. Why assume lying?
I've definitely avoided FF7 cause it was shoved down my throat for years
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
*looks at channel name* uh I mean in every channel that's not here
<:ShirabeCheer:661042424570708037>
I'm never serious
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
It always surprises me when I talk about a show I like and learn it's fanbase is toxic or something. Like huh that's weird. Well I still like the show *shrugs*
I think it's more u shouldn't let the fandom make u judge the show instead of just watching the show and judging it yourself
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
I originally joined this server to find people who played XDU.
~~i talk more Gundam here than anything else honestly~~
<:ShirabeCheer:661042424570708037>
I'm lucky a majority of my friends watch anime thru me so they deal with no fandoms and just watch the shows I try to recommend that I think they'll like
I noped out of darling when they doggystyled the mech. The reactions to it was definitely interesting
I'm the unicorn that stumbles onto everything xD
I guess I'm lucky cause I never deal with fandoms of shows
Like who cares? A show is a show
I remember recommending my hero academia to someone and they said no cause of the fandom.
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Yep Jesus sure is dead. But those broncos tho
I personally find religion the strangest form of accepted cultism.
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Religion
I agree. Not unreasonable at all
Everyone's definition of friendship is different too
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
I mean if I continually talk to someone about things we like for over a month. More than my actual friends. I assume we are friends
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
It just happens.
I don't think I've ever asked to be someone's friend. Online or otherwise
Someone who stays at home
Being outside means I could potentially talk to strangers. So I stay inside
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I don't. I only know kevin
<:ShirabeCheer:661042424570708037>
You did introduce your self that way
Remaining*
That's the reasoning 10% kevin
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
That's like 90% of their identity
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
U scottish hater
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>

Yea I am rafy

Wait... Biological son? I was under the assumption aria was a girl
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
But why. Cause he happened to implant sperm into your mother?
I mean upside. U don't have to deal with your dad anymore
The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb
I always like to qoute that everyone states wrong because idiots
I'm looking forward to when my dad dies personally. Would make my mom's life so much easier for her
I have like 14 friends on Facebook cause I only added people I actually talk to lol. Denied so many friends of friends xD
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I unfixed
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
I make u things?
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
U don't see teenagers at the mall anymore
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Why is sweating bad
~~i got a nice tv display and anime Blu rays to make people come to my place than make me go outside~~
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
But I like will Smith
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
But aria. What if u are prince ~~of bell air~~
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Like what does scott offer them to let his craziness go unchecked.
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Only 1/25?
This scott sounds unhinged and possibly needs medical help.
Hey man. If u guys tried talking to him and it didn't work out even after talks. What's left to do?
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
If Scott is so much of a hassle. I'm shocked the group didn't just kick him out.
I mean u don't don't belong here.
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
I mean. That's just my choice of words
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
U seem to do fine on this server aria. Unless u just mean irl instead of online
<:ShirabeCheer:661042424570708037>
I like chatting with you blade. If that counts for anything.
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
To be fair. I didn't claim it.
Oof that rejection was real yo. Right in the kokoro
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Never! I'm hogging all of Aria's time to myself
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Can I bring anime Blu rays
<:doge:496780220309962772>
<:lewd:655460272596713503>
Funny u mention that aria. Cause there are definitely people I stopped hanging with that wanted to hang out and host. But never take the effort to actually make sure their guests were entertained.
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Some friends I stopped hanging with cause they could only have fun while drinking. I'm a buzzkill apparently
<@471416654346321930> like transformer Michael bay movies
That was an interesting read. She probably doesn't like to talked about it outside of significant others. But hey good luck with the hang
Some people aren't that lucky
At least I have a good mother
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
I'm fairly sure he's a sociopath/narcissist who lacks any empathy.
Is it bad that I wish for my father to die as soon as possible cause he makes everyone miserable?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
My brain thought Maria cause pink hair
What's on feb16
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
Only role that matters is my love for chris
That's very true
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Do people even pay attention to what roles others have?
Like I could understand difficulty with one or two cause u underestimated how it would be you're new at it. But c'mon 4?
Mini rant. / Wanting other to weigh in. But I really dislike customers that come in and complain about things they themselves caused. I'm sorry if your life is hard cause you had 4 kids. Maybe you shouldn't have had so many if you knew you couldn't financially afford to. Is that mean to think?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I don't like getting death glares for being nice to a kid. Just cause I'm an adult male
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
That wasn't their kid. When the kid was happy and left. She went in the opposite direction and I never saw her
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I just remember one time many years ago when me and two friends were walking in a park and we saw some swings and thought. Man we haven't done that since middle school. And decided to go on them. Then this random girl probably 5 comes out of nowhere and sits next to me on the last open swing and asked if I can push her. I look around and see no parent. And I'm like... Sure? And I push her for a bit but my friend notices a family nearby and the mom of the family just watching us the whole time cause she assumed something bad was gonna happen.
Entertaining a stranger's kid never goes well. (At least from a guys perspective on it)
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Just spank them in the face
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Like u about to be 21 with 4 kids.
(an actual women I knew. )
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Did I mentioned they're from 3 different dad's. And I have a bun in the oven with a 4th daddy
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
I'm 20 with three kids cause I dont know how to do condoms and I'm on welfare/child support to support all these kids that I can't take care of.
I hope u get cured of that soon
My condolences kaguya
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I'm okay with kids like 8ish and up. I used to babysit my cousins who were around that age and it was really easy to entertain them with my hacked Wii and having them play Mario or sonico games
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
Nah I got it. thank u tho yumi
I think I understand it now thinking about it
People who identify with the sex they are?
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
<@102691114762371072> I didn't understand your hieroglyphs post about cis.
Why did she rip papers? Im not jnt he know
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I'm 12.50. I want 16 to survive comfortably
Go ahead sparkle
Any roles. At all.
Yea but I don't remember the roles are there 90% of the time
I use what I assume is right until corrected. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
117 questions. Maybe after work
Fair enough
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
He gave me my favorite emote. That's something he did right
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
Tank u melua for writing it in a way I couldn't cause I do not have the best words
Of course people got it harder than me. But also people have it easier too
<:PecoWant:608064874181820456>
I mean nobody chooses where they are born
It upset basically everyone at our store
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
I personally didn't care about working the 36 hours instead of 40
It's only ever 4 hours
<@84811738653929472>
Cause god knows I'm not working 6 days
Now I have to work four 8:30-6 days if I'm forced to work a saturday
New policy enacted where if you work a Saturday half shift you now need to make up the other 4 hours somehow to stay full time isntead of work 36 hours that week. So four 9 1/2 hour days plus Saturday. Or 4 standard days and two half days. We MUST work 40 hours EVERY week.
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
New changes at my job just annoyed everyone. probably going to lose some people. Including me

I seriously hate people. Trying to explain a late payment to a foreigner and how he can't get his new supply until he pays his old payment and him barely understanding me and just repeating the same broken English over and over on how he ALWAYS pays his stuff. WELL APPARENTLY YOU DIDNT. I almost walked out.
Came into work today. Not laid off. But our entire store was almost closed today. But apparently a different location has an unconfirmed case of corona but it seems likely. Just waiting for the results. And they closed instead.
oh man. i just checked how many weeks i need to work in my state to apply for unemployment and im ithink im one freakign week off. ill be checkign tomorrow. im really scared now, cause instead of reduced income i might get no income
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
I might be getting laid off tomorrow
Please just close us too. I don't want to deal with this
Today has been the worst day of work thanks to half our stores closinf
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
I crave death

Second case confirmed in my building. Another 50 lay offs but I still have to come in. I feel unsafe
Sharing hobbies is easily one of the best ways to grow a frienship
Well lectric. It sounds like u need a hobby that can be done with multiple people over voice chat. Like group watching. Dnd. Gaming. Etc.
<:catthumb:613195599897952272>
Already ahead of u kerrik
I have a friend that uses teamspeak to this day
<:catthumb:613195599897952272>
It's also easier over time with people u do talk a lot with. I got no issue hitting up some of my line buddies to chat while playing division
Most people dont log on to VC to just shoot the shit like you would irl
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Well yea voice chat is awkward if u aren't actively doing somethinf
Or just forever text
Do u do anything with online friends? Like a video game over voice chat?
Raiden can u be my friend in pso2 when it releases next month?
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
I mean I'm still getting paid for doing nothing. I just know other people in my building are working while I'm not
Random topic change but I feel bad I've been working my job that I hate but have just sat here on my phone for hours. Not doing anything. I really want to be laid off or fired.
I miss irl friends
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
I appreciate the friendships I've made with online people that are comfortable enough to voice chat while playing games etc. Feels like they're right here gaming with me.
Retail has made me hate people in general now. I deal with too many stupid people on a daily basis and it depresses me.
Sometimes that's just what u gotta do cocoa sadly.
Yep
Same
<:ChrisCross:692915261602267146>
Most people are shitty matt
But I'm also a pessimistic
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
See I assume they'll just be fanatical about something else. Rather than a decent person
I always wonder what religious fanatics would be doing with their lives if religion wasn't a thing that existed
Turns of your brain easy
I listen to music to chill. Or play video games. Or watch anime. Or build Gundams. Basically anything that's my hobby that I can contentrate on
Parasite Eve!
I read that as librarian. And was very confused for a second

I feel like you should never go full anything since basically every side has at least one good point and one bad point.
On my work days I don't usually eat till about 6pm.
It's all about what u eat rather that how much u eat
I usually have 2

Corporations man
It's like when I learned u DONT need three meals a day. And breakfast ISNT actually the most important meal of the day
<:BikiShock:447891354278821888>
~~unless the unheathly food gives me unhealthy outlooks and the corporations have trapped us all~~
The only unheathly things I want in my life are my food
For real. Debates are now just shouting matches or fights that u have to win rather than trying to understand the other side and where they are coming from
Oh no

There's 1 miion studies proving the earth isn't flat. At 1 study that proves it does. *Crazy person grabs the one study*
Since it's easier to type something to a not faced person than in person.
I feel like everything has been more extreme with the internet.
<:ElfneinNeedsAnAdult:643311102616272946>
I dunno if it's me and people's over reliance of the internet or just the ability to talk to more people than ever before but I feel like the general masses are getting.. dumber? But that could just be my experiences
<:KirikaSadQuiet:676150820592418856>
I mean. I do like the time before smart phones. I feel like people actually talked more in general . But then again I was young and it's either to make friends when young imo
~~new types~~
But like. Change is inevitable. You can't not change

I couldn't imagine life without meat. It's so good
I was chubby and wanted to not be chubby
<a:InLove:689979639506272264>
My diet is heavily Meat based now
I'm on a no carbs diet now and it's worked wonders
I stopped doing veggie diet when I wasn't seeing any improvements over time.
Cause 6 big Macs are different that 6 fish or veggie meals
They eat super healthy things like fish tho a lot don't they?
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
And I thanked him
I actually realized I grew recently as a person slightly. Cause I watched movie. Hated it. Complained to a friend about it. And he also happened to have just seen it and loved ot. Explained things I didn't notice or catch on to. And then I internalized the new info and came to appreciate the movie.
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
It's just a minority lol
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>

I always ask questions when I want to learn more things
Thank you melua
Yes it does
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
So the trans part is like an adopted moniker cause cis people would have an even harder time understanding than if someone just stated they were a man or woman.
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I'm probably just stupid. But is there ever a moment where a trans woman or trans man drop the trans part? And they're just a woman or a man. I assume it's more of a mental thing and it's a person by person scenario
Can I ask a question that probably has a complicated answer?
<:TsubasaThink:692609932863733771>
But now I know.
I thought transexual were people who were into transgender people. Like heterosexual or bisexual.
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
Oh I was way off
I think I know the answer but I will wait for meluas answer. Cause I'm not 100% sure
Well if u consider 10 long. I could recommend. Good 10  hour RPG games for u try
U know persona 4 is like 5-6 times that right?
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
I think lectric is one of the few people I've heard mention that 10 hours is long.
Platformers just might not be your thing
<@302063351767498752> actually to get this out of the way. What's your definition of a short game vs a long game
Uncharted series is a perfect example of the most hype 10 hours
I've played plenty of immersive short games
<:TsubasaWellUh:695689134550941796>
Theyre beatable tho
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
Lectric only has access to emulators right?
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
To get you the nice feeling if beating a game
Something you can beat in a couple sittings
Maybe you should try playing shorter games
<:catthumb:613195599897952272>
Whatever helps u move on lectric
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
An idea?
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
I like books with pictures in them
Never thought of it that way. Thanks yassai
Ask your parents for help.
Obviously I'm not a doctor but maybe talking to an actual doctor about your focus issues might be something u want to do. They could prescribe something to help or something else.
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
You can't enjoy any of them? Even with their problems?
Maybe a different form of entertainment will keep your attention. Have you tried movies or tv shows. Or books
you're definitely in the pessimistic territory. It's been awhile since I've seen you say something positive personally.
On the internet at least
Not to be an ass. But.. just don't go to them lectric. It's not hard to avoid things that you hate.
Especially since quite a few of the bosses are hard af
I'd say so
<@302063351767498752> that's an anime called psycho pass. It doesn't end well
I mean if Matt's idea is to also black list them I don't see how an up arrow is an issue. But lectric you just need to not go to the sites. If you feel the urge to go to a site you hate. Maybe set down your phone or walk away from your computer for a minute to let that urge pass and then do something you actually want to do, than make yourself mad.
Eh. It's only 5 people. Me pulling the lever would cause me to become a murderer of that one person. I'm good
Let's go talk in spoilers
Im so disappointed in TLOU2...

They needed to give all these essential workers something like hazard pay or something for working in these trenches
I'm just working
I'm not getting unemployment
I was laid off for a day. Then called back. But everyone else who stayed laid off makes more than me and I'm miserable at work with all this shit we have to do now
No hazard pay for me or anything
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
Man I just learned my coworkers who were laid off since March are making a little more than double what I make on unemployment. That's so unfair. I want the extra 600 to man
You could watch one a week even. Like if it was running on television
That could be fun.

i could understand the confusion since you're usually affectionate and loving to either family or partners.

i feel like he would misconstrue intimate friends but thats me
but im a direct individual
i feel like youd need to be as straight as possible with him. you dont want to be his significant other. you just want to be friends and thats final.
i know i dont have much input but is it just me but are the responses oddly wordy/round about? i dunno its hard to type. i feel like ive never seen someone write this way. could just be regions
Is the meme making fun of Nazis? Cause that's fine.
okay, thank you melua

I mean my main social life are internet people I met that I VC chat with on PS4 or PC gaming
<:KannaSip:480753608045101076>
I mean my irl life pertains to building Gundams. Playing online games. Watching anime with my bro.
<:MeguFace:480750533968396288>
It's quite easy to avoid  internet drama when you aren't on the internet. Just unplug from everything. Enjoy irl life
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Ah I could only think it the TV channel
What's CW?
I mean we all die eventually.
I don't doubt most trans would tell me that lol
<:MillaarcDone:689395768980668416>
I don't have the energy for that. I wake up, go to work, go home, unwind with friends or games, go to sleep. Repeat.
<:homucide:572977615367962634>
But nooooo. I had to get called back right away
4 months of double pay and having 40+ hours a week back to do whatever I want
It's still happening until next month I think
<:UsedToIt:714622630841417790>
Can the government give us essential workers that 600 a week. I'm so jealous my coworker got laid off and now makes twice as much as I do.
I don't think I could ever tell someone to kys. That's messed yo
Hell yea
I don't have to go to work anymore?
I seriously hate people so much more than I did before
<:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
Can I punch every customer that gives me an attitude when I tell them they need to wear a mask.
What does Chapo Trap House mean?
Like how are you a doctor and that fucking stupid to not know that prescriptions need a Diagnosis or u can't get it filled
I even heard them over the phone while he was telling them in store
That doctor is an idiot
And apparently this doctor has ALWAYS written prescriptions like that and they've been filled.
I tried to tell the guys insurances don't take prescriptions without it.
Okay quick survey. If you have a prescription for an item and the person u give it to at a medical facility says it has no diagnosis so you would need to go to the doctor to get that filled out otherwise it's invalid. Would you fight that?
My YouTube and subbreddits are just video games and anime.
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Man... I'm so glad I don't dive deeper inter internet stuff to find these things
Thank you
Ah
Yea and it sucks
I never went outside to  begin with
i really could use a hug irl. fucking social distancing
thank you
im not a door mat and dont take shit from anyone
i'll probably get fired at some point for yelling back at a customer
i legit want to just quit and hide in my house for the next year
i fucking wish we could
i cant win
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
but i do it cause if anyone else is the doorman. i get even more mad cause i hate seeing my coworkers get yelled at even more
its so many people a day
i dunno im just tired of people getting mad at me for telling them to wear a mask or they cant come in.
<:StellaSip:632615355314864140>
i wouldve let her in
but yea if she showed me the paper
i had asthma as a child. so i know what its like
forreal. i have to wear a mask for 8 hours a day 5 days a week. im fine.
like if you have such an issue wearing the mask. have someone get the stuff for you or order it online
just apparently had one
she never showed me anything
she had nothing. just her purse from what i saw
im getting really REALLY tired of people
i had a lady yesterday who started cursing at me cause i wouldnt allow her into the store without a mask on per our store policy. and apparently she has extreme asthma and cant wear masks, has a doctors note apparently (didnt show it to me). its literally a thin piece of paper. you telling me you cant handle wearing a mask for a couple minutes to get whatever you need at our store.
or at least resting bitch face
i think i work with a frown 90% of my work day now lol
it helps
im constantly saying fuck u fuck fuck u, piece of shit, etc. under my breath while helping them
the one benefit of this pandemic is i dont need to keep a fake smile up for assholes since they cant see my face
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
i die a little inside every day i work
UGHHH THIS IS SO STUPID I JUST NEED BLAH BLA BLAH, I DONT HAVE TIME TO WAIT.
maam and/or sir. you need to wait in our waiting area for an employee to help you. we cant have you roaming the large store by yourself touching who knows what
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I HAVE TO WAIT FOR AN EMPLOYEE TO HELP ME? I JUST NEED SO AND SO. I CAN GO GET IT MYSELF. THIS IS RIDICULOUS
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
not sorry
oh my god. the amount of people who yell at us cause they cant get thru on our phone lines. is ridiculous. our store is at half staff capacity. and people in the store are more important than our phones. sry
but thank you guys for allowing me to vent. im seriously mentally exhausted from everyone
<:KirikaFish:717138469381734471>
but what if i never get back up?
Im not being forced to work at a different location an hour away. Crisis avertrd
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
So i might be quitting my job. Depending on what goes on from the higher ups.
Is it bad i look forward to a day when i get an asshole customer that i can yell back at. To possibly lose my job. Im so tired of this
This 600 was way too much to begin with.  Lasted too long. Stupid goverment
Itll be nice when everyone starts coming back to work. Tired of busting my ass on half staff cause nobody wants to work
Oh yea i forgot it was a whole family. Thats omega oof then
<@263534352422404096> minimum wage full time job used to be the minimum amount to survive with owning a house, a car, groceries. All the necessities. I dont believe schooling was included in that
<:homucide:572977615367962634>
Rememeber when minimum wage used to be minimum amount needed to survive on your own
He wasnt in the negatives but he dropped 500 bucks in under 30 mins
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
Finally got him to log off. Someone irl was helping him. He was hyperventalating, crying. Everything. Jeez
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
<a:MiunaCrying:642524338922324009>
Guys... I just saw a good friend break down into tears from spending half a grand on FGO trying to get summer BB. This was the most heart wrenching thing ive seen.
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
at the medical store i work at
some stuff is legit price gouging tho. i saw a 4,000 device is apparently made for around 200 or less dollars.
Thatll be misconstrued easily. U gotta wonder how things get past and nobody thinks what the imagery could imply
Good luck aria!
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
I just saw this
Thank u all
This is fucking me up way harder than i thought it would
<:MythNotLikeGura:760998081168015390>
Ive already taken three "bathroom breaks" so i dont cry in front of a customer
I dont want tomorrow to come
Its so hard to not tear up at work.
Yea! 17 long years. He was such a good pupper
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Ive had him since 6th grade. I dont want im to go. But keeping him alive is just making him suffer
Putting down my dog tomorrow. Im gonna miss him
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
He had a good 17 years.
Thank u all.
That was the hardest half hour of my life.
My dog.
He's gone. T_T
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
My mom is lonely after putting my dog down and asked if she could sit and watch my anime  me and my bro are watching.
<:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
If u got decked every time you were a piece of shit im sure itd happen less
I really wish u could punch these assholes in their faces with no consequences
<:albedohmm:714486496081739866>
Its like millionaires who avoid taxes. U already have money that will never run out. Instead of making 300 million you make 250 million a year. Oh no!
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000> <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Twice in a month
Sharing my furball. He was such a good kitty

Now i have to do my kitty
It hurt so much to put down my pupper
I cant do this again
Thanks voy. Thanks aria
Guess im no allowed to have pets anymore
Thank u
Not what i wanted to hear when i got off work today
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I have to put down my cat tonight
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
They are?
A few months is just a drop in the bucket for our lives.
At least that means it can be fixed when covid stops being such an issue
Because of covid?
Have u thought about picking up a hobby? That could be a good way to make new frienda with a shared interest.
As an anime only fan. Felix just seems like a guy whos comfortable with wearing girl clothes (cause theyre better than guys clothes obv) and likes to tease people who mistake him for a girl.
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Why did i wanto to be an adult as a kid
Oh sorry. My brain is small and i got confused
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
Wait so u need to take puberty blockers your whole life?
I never take medicine. Im afraid that the one time i actuay need pain meds it wont work cause my body is used to it
Wouldnt that mess up someones growth?
What
We have tecnology to block puberty?
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I sure would love not to deal with hair in all these places
Damn i was close
Hormone rebalance treatment?
Possibly. Having the knowledge at least couldve changed my descisions on things
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Man its too bad this stuff wasnt around or as well known when i was young.
Terrible descision
And heaven forbid i talk back to anybody whos rude to me
It genuinely shocks me how u can get to 40+ and be this much of an idiot. Dont u get wiser with age? I swear to god its like im dealing with children
The amount if sheer stupidity and rudness is maddening
I wanted to throat punch so many fucking people today
Why are people the worst to retail.employees. do u want peoole to come where u work  and be a piece of shit to u? No? Then why do u do it?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Obviouslt this doesnt include countries that are not first world yet. Cause u could get beheaded for nothing in a couple of those
We would win every year
Might as well be
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
While i know corruption exists in every country. I feel like its just way more prevalent in the us
It blows my mind how people can get away with selling 2 dollar medicine for 200 dollars
<:ChrisWave:744465189596037168>
I do
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
*looks at other countries with full medicla care by government*  yep itll definitrly force us to ration it
Makes me wonder why we dont have an indian history month.
My bad. My brain got black history month and black lives matter mixed up. I thought its been around for decades. Not since 2013
Am i the only crazy person who think BLM is strange to have? Why isnt it all lives matter.
One day ill feel happy about my body
I restarted my efforts to get myself back down
So.. i stepped on the scale yesterday and all my hard work pre covid is gone.
Wait what
At least my coworkers say i dont like like my original weight
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
So i weighed myself this morning. Im back to my old weight
Thankfully i found a mask that molds to my nose to prevent fogging
i agree
Like its my house
Reminds me of thst time they wanted to pass a law to force people to wear masks in their own home
I swear u think u seen the depths of stupidity but we keep topping ourselves
Who would enforce me calling my mom. Mom
Outlaw?
Im sorry what...
Anymore
Who can even retire that early
This is why i ignore news
How does that work
But we have the most cypher
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Sometimes i wish i was a european or just a non american. I feel like we have the most crazies in the world
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
The internet tends to latch onto the first thing they see
Just that theres conflicting info on the whole situation
I mean i never said that wasnt excessive
Theres conflicting info
Possibly.
Im seeing people saying he wasnt listening to police commands and had a knife. And other people saying he was only reaching and shot in the back.
Wouldnt that be a different issue where some workers are valued higher than other workers?
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
Uhh... Im not sure. I saw the deck still had a Q and a K in the corner but i didnt remember the images
Like no kings and queens
Im actually more surprised they didnt try to just change the cards to something else
Im curious if the cards will get enough traction to sell in stores
<:GermainAngry:689199996653928451>
I dont like change
<:emithumbsup:775400079552282664>
I mean the queen is stronger than the jack
Thats a fair point armis
I feel like history told me a lot of nations ruled by the queen basically
That is usually what happens lol
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
Does that subtlety really affect anyone? I dont even know any existing kings. Just the queen of england.
Why
<@203444794737950720> wait what
Its really depressing
Man when i learned that the mantra. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day was made from kellogs or a diff cereal company to sell more cereal. Made me question a whole lot of other things i never questioned growing up
Man who wants kings or queens. U want that ace
Like 4 in japan. Or 13 in america
Possibly 8 and 9 are taboo numbers in brazil
And rated for adults
Does russia not have a rating system like everywhere else. These adult rated shows are bad for children. Cause theyre for adults
<:GermainAngry:689199996653928451>
Inuyashiki was a beautifully done anime
Thats a very worrisome job path
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Thats not a good ratio
3-4 in 50 states
Like are there non scummy politicians? I feel like thats an oxymoron
Fair
How are we still alive
I feel like every state says they have the worst politicians
Are people moving from california to get away from it?
Oh
Blue?
A lot of states are already larger than a bunch of countries
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
Like do u think state could function as its own nation
Wyoming wants to do that?
I always wondered what would happen if states wanted to break away from the usa
~~finish the wall~~
Thank the lord
Its finally over
Also get rid of television. Rots the kids brains
That thing about filing form for rebates makes so much sense
Theres some brutal murder in it
Inuyashiki is deff adult orientated
<:emiree:775400583225409536>
Driving is also stressful
I dont kmow how people can deal with stuff like that
Man remember when ea tried to label loot boxes as surprise mechanica and the guy asking the questions laughed in her face
Arent all of them like that lanks?
Im so glad i never bother with politics. Seems like extra stress in an already stressful life
Ah
I just liked the qoutes
I dont know who she is
Made me think of this with flat earth talk

Damn thats a savage response. I love it
Its also to the point where naofumi doesnt even see it as slavery anymore. More just hey i have a skill that gives u better level ups when you have it equipped. It just happens to be connected to servitude.
Ive picked up hobbies that can help me stave off bad thoughts. Like i build model kits now, when i finish one i feel very good about what i accomplished
I've always found it fascinating how cultures can determine one's mindset. Like one place might find something disgusting but to another it's common place. And vice verse
That's people. They come in all shapes and sizes and mentalities
I never go into research on any creators of things I like. More often than not. They end up being a piece of shit in some way. (Tho in this case he stopped making good stuff years ago)
Is that the one where a hero fights like alqaeda?
didn't he make a bunch of batman comics? Seems silly to cancel probably the biggest guest but that's America for ya
I'm scientific proof laziness does exist.
I'm shocked China didn't strong-arm the Olympics into making Taiwan not play cause they already have China representatives
Delta? So we up to 4 strains now?
I do think it's a bit funny that people rushed out to get the vaccine to take off masks and now masks are being forced again regardless if u have the vaccine. I'm sure that was a lot of people's motivation.
I find it very concerning that there's all this shit in the game industry. Like wtf it wrong with people
So that would explain why I know very little
I've never been on 4chan
This is one rabbit hole I'm gonna avoid
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
Why is there so much documentary about this one person
How long are these parts?
They didnt injure anyone. Keep them for longer than necesssry. Apologized for the bad call
We lack the info on if that area is known for making bogus calls tho. Or the exact phone convo. How distressed the person acted. Etc. Im all for shaming bad police behaivor when egregious things happen. This just doesnt seem like one of them to me.
To be fair thats more the fault of the caller than the police themselves. Multiple intruders entering a house. Freaking racist neighbor
I dunno if this belongs here. But this scares me to no end
https://www.dazeddigital.com/science-tech/article/53873/1/scientists-have-developed-mini-brains-and-theyve-just-grown-eyes
I finally had a light at the end of my tunnel and now it's gone
Living is exhausting.
Fucking cool. Looks like I'm gonna be out of a job next month. Awesome,  best job I ever got and now it's gone. Not gonna get anything close to this.
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
Jesus Spiderman tickers are getting scalped. Why
Yea I saw that on the local news earlier
Out of curiosity. Why is milk being talked about
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Maybe she collects it while at work to bring home to the baby
How can you do that to someone
That's how I reacted.
I don't even know how to begin consoling him
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
My brother's GF just broke up with him cause she's actually been engaged to another guy this whole time.
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
My friend accidently knocked off my external hard drive. It took like a 2-3 feet drop and now it doesn't work. That month I spent collecting games and getting my emulator box is ruined
I'm clueless on world politics
What does Russia hope to gain invading ukraine
Ah I guessed non aggression. For the first two words
What's nato
absolute scum of a person
dude i saw her talking about that on a clip once. she worked on editing it for him to make her face not seen and she did for 3-4 hours and then when she was done he said the nah im gonna post the original instead. had JAIDEN REVEAL in the title as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1DTK4U1AM watching this made me a bit happier with my lifestyle
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
I just want peace and fucking quiet after work
Like give her 5 seconds after work and she's in a shouting match with my grandma like no other
I dunno how she's never had a bipolar episode at work
All her coworkers tell me how much of a nice lady she is and I'm like man if only you know how much I hated her fucking guts
I just can't take being called a liar or useless when I'm not. Cause I didn't do something exactly as she wanted or something bothered her
And other meds
She also has diabetes meds.
She takes a lot
Yea but if she actually does I don't know
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Doesn't help she's an extreme bipolar person. Her anger swings. I just can't deal with anymore
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Used to love my aunt and living with her for 3-4 months now makes me look forward to when she stops breathing
Loath or detest is probably what I'm looking for
Is there a word to describe the intensity of hating someone so much that even hearing them utter words sets you off?
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Yall ever just sit there and think of all the years you wasted
i know i didnt talk about it before. but my friend whos been missing since tuesday night was just found. thank god.
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
man learning about someones death by accident just really shook me. Kanda Sayaka jumped off a building december of last year. She voiced Yuna in SAO and Mana in idoly Pride. like holy shit. Rest in Peace girl.
Anyone knowledgeable about covid can tell me of that's something that happens?
I'm having difficulty breathing. If I don't breath really slowly my throat feels clogged like I'm gurgling. Is the best wait I can describe.
I've tried some ludems and havent has much luck
Yes. Or a scratched one
But now it hurts to swallow
I've been drinking water non atop
I hate this so much. I never wanna leave the house again
Why lol
I have barely anything in my house thanks to getting covid on vacation
I have neither of those things on my house
So I'm feeling better in one area. But now my throat is killing me any time I swallow. And I wanna die
But I can tell I'm not falling asleep anytime soon
I will. I still feel like shit and did only get an hour if sleep
I slept for an hour and a half. And I can breath better than before thank god
Okay. If it gets any worse I'll head in. I had a pretty big cough just now that seems to have dislodge it a bit
Would I go to a hospital or an urgent care
It'd hard to swallow tho. I get large amount of pain when I do. Like my throat clamps up like a vice grip
Yes I drink as much as possible
Fuckig kill me. I coughed up a large amount of bile this morning and thought that would help with my recovery. But now I have this extremely annoying dry cough that I can't stop
I legit I dunno how I'm going to sleep at all
I only now just realized I can't talk
Status update. I feel like everything but my throat is recovering nicely. And I really wish my throat was the main thing recovering.
I'm also watching danmachi S2 cause I don't mind trash here and there
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
So are some shinsengumi members
<:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
I'm still gonna watch it. But I was shocked it's almost number one watched show of this season
I found it very generic looking
I feel like I'm the only person who didn't like fire force
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
Oh I see sorcerer also likes dumbell and maidens
Astra lost in space, dumbbell, okaasan online, Maidens are also entertaining to me at least
Vinland saga, Dr. Stone, Tejina-Senpai, To the abandoned Sacred Beasts. Are my personal favorites of this season when it comes to new things.  <@302063351767498752>
Interesting
I'm watching so many animes this season. It's crayz. Usually I find 2-3 good things a season. I currently have 10 animes I'm watching
<@437292788611153931>whats it about?
Except u silly.
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Watch nobody from Symphogear discussion pop over here
Beep boop
I need to watch shirobako. It's been sitting on my shelf since last yeaf
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I skipped Franx. When I learned they basically sexed to fight I was out
The best part is the ending episode reveals it's actually a canon part of the show it pays homage to
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<@189146272865845248> yesss. Also the camera angles and effects were very reminscent to real life super hero/tokusatsu shows
Like I doubt most people would know the gridman vehicles in it are all based off of transformers
Gridman is for a very specific crowd of fans
I've gotten thru like 15 of them so far
Cop craft is one of the last animes I haven't watched of this season
Such a love letter
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Gridman was dope as shit
Isn't fight league based of a game owned by bandai?
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<@189146272865845248> oh since u mentioned u didn't watch last season. I recommended Kono Oto Tomare (a sleeper hit that nobody really talked about), Kimetsu no Yaiba, and Dororo
<@173112001684439040> what's boring?
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I look forward to watch them overcome the trials and tribulations of this world they live in
He's not. He's honestly barely shown at first lol
Which is strange cause u definitely see the anime from a different persons point of view half the time
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Always happy to hear people's opinions on either side of the fence
Please do. And if u do or don't like it. Let me know
And it's probably the most unique thing this season
It's like a dual protagonist role
It's so good tho :(
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
If u have to pick anything. Go with Dr stone
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Hey look a recycle bin for granbelm
I like watching Gundam cause u usually never see another show like it.
I don't actually mean conform but I just saw a lot of things in ibo that I would expect of anime
I always felt like Gundam never really conformed to any of the trends currently going on in anime culture. But I felt like ibo did
Leave it alone lol
No g Gundam is campy goodness from back in the day
Ibo... The way I describe it was. It's the most anime Gundam has ever been
Oh god SD Gundam.
Like iron blooded orphans was meh
Gundam is based. But I didn't like some of its recent stuff
YEEEEEAAA BOIII
Mecha is my favorite category
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<@316755282716000266> DID WE JUST BECOME BEST FRIENDS
I don't watch trailers to things
I just went off a couple pictures
I feel bad I don't try a lot of animes based on it's look. I skipped asterisk war cause it looked like generic fantasy. But if wolf says it's good. I'll put it on my list after girlish number
That sounds right up my alley
Ohhh
What's girlish number about? I saw that cover of it's Blu-ray once
Trigger never should've been hyped to begin with :P
Dumbell anime is very informative for being a comedy anime

4k bd in Japan only

Fun fact. Thunderbolt movie 1 was the first anime to be drawn in 4k.
And the second thunderbolt movie
I need to get around to watching the Origin movies
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
It's great to me

Seed had good designs for Gundam but that's it

Budget Gundam Seed

Are they getting that perfect grade metal build Nu Gundam for 1000 bucks?
METAL BUILD TOO?  Aw hell

<@173112001684439040> I'm okay. I'll look around and see if I can find any torrents of it
There's at least three of them that are gender bent to female
Ah. So many nobunagas to keep track of lol
I don't have crunchy roll
It's not on horrible subs so I wouldn't know where to watch it wolf
<@316755282716000266> I think it was called Nobunagun
Onto the yearly nobunaga show we seem to get
Dammit cop craft was good.  <@173112001684439040> was hoping it wouldn't be cause I'm already watching too many animes this season xD
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
It's my day off from work. I can watch all I want
Onto cop craft
Watched the first episode of granbelm it was almost all just a fight scene with floaty sd mechs
<@316755282716000266> I'll be here if u want to chat more. Figured talking about action figures of anime wouldn't fit in character creation
Yes that. Needs a 2nd season. It was so good
<@173112001684439040>
Makes me think of that reverse Isekai where a demonlord comes to earth and works at McDonald's
Yea
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Bandai pls make Symphogear kits now that u know how to with the build diver girls
The plastic just feels so cheap
Good luck. I stopped Midway on my third and last one
Koto kits aren't fun to build
Bandai only for me.
I honestly hated building them
I have some muv luv kotobukiya kits.
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Anyways I'm out for the night. Ttyl guys. Glad to be back
I remember when nendos were the poor man's way to get into figure collecting with 10-25 dollar nendos
I'm gueasing600 bucks got him 10-12 nendos?
Rip him man. I stopped buying at conventions cause everything is 2x the price lol

<@316755282716000266> ah looking at it again I am missing a bunch of my nendoroids. It's probably closer to 100
Sure. I'm going to be going to bed soon tho so if you wouldn't mind I'll happily read it tomorrow.

<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<@316755282716000266> what u got for sale
I honestly doubt you'll ever see Symphogear stuff since it's Japan only unless u fine one of their few overpriced figures or a nendoroid
I've been trying to downsize my collection but it's hard to sell
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I hope she doesn't imagine u in those yaoi doujins
Must avoid
That's a scary convention
Cause they're so rare lol
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
A male anime figure? Rip
Yea u never know what'll sell
I've sworn off anime tiddie figures. Too expensive nowadays
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
That was my third guess
Phat the company or phat as in cool
Life is so unfair

U have a gunpla shop near u
Bruh
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Like domon kasshu
Lots of things show up for 5 seconds in that
Im surprised G savior wasn't in that recent G genderation game that was UC only. They pulled all the video games into it as well as ms igloo and some other one off things
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
<@316755282716000266> you sent a blank link. Strange
Hey man they have a good track record for movies

Oh I'll *entertain* you wolf

Wolf tells me that all the time
Whelp i don't remember that lol
UI was in broly? I don't remember seeing it
<@256945399338631168> what about broly
I only watch the movies for dragonball now
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Okay
<@173112001684439040> come back I'm sorry :(
These need to be real figures and not garage kits
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
But I was born in the gutter
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Easy to satisfy you say
<@173112001684439040> i can. Kh3 was such a disappointment for me
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>

<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Just bought two new nendoroids
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I have returned
Never tried Sakura quest but images do give me a shirobako feel
I'm going to keep enjoying this cute funny show
I'm not clicking that
It's very cute and fun
Oh my feel good anime atm is I would even fight a demon Lord for my daughter
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Iyashikei?
Watched that video. And probably cause lack of context/haven't actually watched the show. I didn't get anything out of it. Got bored xD
Yea I need more than that to watch a show. I don't mind if that happens in a show. But that can't be the whole show
Oh I see
What's that acronym
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
I've only watched one of those and I didn't like it. Guess kirara isn't for me lol
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
Any example animes?
Kirara show?
If I end up dropping anything I'll give it a shot
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Skipped that to be honest. I'm already watching like a dozen things
I honestly thought cop craft was gonna be bad but it's one of my favorites atm. It almost feels like I'm watching law and order but in anime form lol
It definitely didn't hook me like lots of other shows this season. But who knows, it could get better
It's also very floaty. Like I'm watching something that's not actually there. But that's just me
I don't know how I feel about granbelm. I feel like it's action is missing a lot of sound effects
<@216181207874928640> ignoring cheat magician. There's a lot of really good animes this season. Nothing like MUST watch. But they're all quite enjoyable
<@256945399338631168> I remember that interview question lol
I forgot he does King Kai. That's such a good voice
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I wonder if Sean gets bored of doing Goku and wants to do other things or just loves his role
I don't know the whole story. I just know I liked his work. He did a good broly
Rip Vic tho.
I loved the first person part
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
~~what is this. Gungaleonline?~~
I always enjoy a tragic hero
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I've been enjoying to the abandoned Sacred beasts. Totally not cause there's an oversized lady in it
Complete opposite of SoL lol
I'm someone who watches the plot heavy animes or action or sci-fi or political ones
Deen gets shit on a lot but honestly I think they do a decent job after they got out of the mid 2000s
And how they have like a billion animes this season?
Oh we talking about jc staff?
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I'm glad I opened my phone to some this season anime discussion
Milf Isekai reminds me of a nicer konosuba. Nothing will actually progress and it'll just be comedy
<@220201140141162496> why don't u qoute more dead historians to me
<@152896851660505088> been enjoying Kimetsu no Yaiba.
Rip 2000s
It's like watching when anime went from cel art to digitally drawn. A massive decrease in art quality
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
I'd rather have knight of sidonia or arpeggio CGI over handshakers
Oh yea I heard about that
ARE U SERIOUS
Sold like under 100 or something Blu Ray total
It is fun knowing the worst anime sold the year it came out lol
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
And we still have no symphogear
Yet Funimation released it on Blu Ray herr
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Hand shakers is a visual disaster if you've ever had the displeasure of watching that.
But on the bright side we do get many more good animes on top of the trash
I've been told different directors can make or break an anime even if they're made at the same studio
Things did not have as much impact as season 1
Yea i agree
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
Wait studio Deen is doing the next season of 7 deadly sins instead of A-1 pictures
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Opm S2. When the manga has more animation than the anime
That looked decent
I enjoyed is this a zombie? From them
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Isn't vivio 6 in strikers?
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>

Vivid strike too?
Are u still working on vivid encoding btw wolf?
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>

My anime order and my gunpla order came in at the same time
I can see that. I had way flashier things to watch that season so I dropped it for now
I tried to get into fairy gone but it was so dry for me
I do not
If u smear vaesline onto the screen it would be all blurry. Like the anime
I fixed my typo  <@264373970118246400>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I swear I'm dyslexic
I don't want the vaseline smeared mess
No buy from me then
I hope the Blu Ray of megalo box is just the original 1080p
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Most Gundam isnt in the vein of super robots for u zana
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
You know this discord makes me have faith in humanity for all the Gundam fans that's exist here
GUNGNIR DATTO?!?
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Now let's talked about Symphogear here
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I watched it. It looks like it could be fun as long as they don't try to make the mom a possible lover for the son. If she's just there to make things awkward for her son and potential girlfriends. I'll enjoy it
Astra lost in space had a great episode this week. Happy it hasn't dropped the ball.
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Carol did nothing wrong
We need a new plague to get rid of the humans
I still can't even fathom why someone would want to do this to an animation company
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
That's even worse than I was told
That's so sad.
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Kyoani studio was attacked by a man who set their building on fire. 16 people are currently confirmed dead.
But rainbows arent... Oh I get it
~~Like it was planned to do. The marketing worked~~
It's also the reason I got into gunpla building as well as getting my friends to try the hobby
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
<@486087033652248576> I knew we were best friends for a reason
Yea it's the perfect love letter to Gundam fans but also the best gateway anime to get into gundam
That I've heard from at least
It's honestly one of the best shows they've made with very little critiscim for it.
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
She's also a bit of a troll herself when she's not in idol outfit
Went from one of my most disliked characters to genuinely one of my favorites by the end
But the idol gunpla girl was also set up for a lot of good laughs too
No not really. There aren't many toxic players in the show honestly.
Oh yea the soundtrack is also top notch
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I've rewatched it so many times
It's the first Blu Ray of Gundam I bought
Best mom in anime
Yes
It's basically just a large commercial for the toys. But it has a fantastic cast of characters. Great character development. And awesome fights
It is. But it was also waaaaaay better than it needed to be
Oh actually. Unless we include Gundam build fighters. That's my favorite non UC gundam
Still the best Non UC Gundam to date too
There's really no good side
I like the military aspect of the UC timeline
Oh..
No special powers
Main characters are just people
<@220201140141162496> u should actually try the three shows I recommended. They all don't have that problem.
Sry I'm needing out again. Need to restrain myself
I also really enjoy stardust memory
If u want more realistic. 08th Ms team or war in the pocket may be up your alley
As it shouldnt
Three times
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
He's a special human being that has a better brain than most humans. So he rewrites the OS of his Gundam to be more efficient
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Yea sure man
<@220201140141162496> if you want an example of power fantasy ridiculousness. Look no further than Gundam seed. Main char rewrites the OS of his Gundam mid first fight
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Sorry I'm just reminiscing on old Gundam memories now
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
I remember amuro piloting other stuff at one point and having difficulty if it wasn't the Gundam. I could be misremembering I
And even then they have growing pains
True. But most of the main chars are military people who are trained specifically for mobile suit combat
Yea all the side stories are adults in the military lol
Well with amuro and the og gundan. He read the manual of how to operate it and he was already an intelligent person who deals with robots/mechanics already thanks to his father
Hey u can be cute and also memeworthy
So kiri bot is just for memes
Oh I c
Random question. How does one activate the Maria or shirabe bots. I've seen kiri pop up often
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Remember when OG Gundam got an upgrade that was supposed to change it's color but they never bothered to do it?
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I missed the Melua teaching time. Did someone DVR it?
Seed was decent until justice and freedom were introduced imo
Also a guy named moo ~~mu~~ made me laugh
~~at least they were hot~~
Rip anything against strike freedom
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Sucks to be hum
Yea he had 3 girls loving him
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
And it was about athrun
The scene i was referring to was destiny first episode
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Why is that so special
Like he fucking jumped.
Like there's an episode where all these robots are getting destroyed. And when they shoot at one of the main chars. He uses his thrusters to jump and dodge the gun. And the guys liek. WOAH HES GOOD
How military trained people can't put up a fight against a teenager
Yep. That's another complaint about Gundam seed
Majestic prince nailed it so hard
<@99695384296701952> you're also the first person I've met that knows majestic prince even exists
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
It's so gud
I love using majestic prince as an example of how to do CGI robot choreography
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Her friend was way too big tho
She was such a good adult lady
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
I guess I can kinda see it

Mmm
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
That's so wildly different
I don't believe u that's the same artist
It's just an artstyle that doesn't gel with me
Don't like it here. Or in fafnir. Or revius
I don't like the Seed design
But  also not a fan of the artist himself
I was going to say that too
I know lol
Terrible plot
Has terrible characters
Reussed tons of footage
It looks graphically bad
What*
Like whay
Gundams
It's one of the most popular
What I don't understand is how Japan loves seed
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
One does not survive an explosion of a mobile suit with a nuclear reactor
Or future Crossbones RG. I bet
Nah let's make the tallgeese 2 RG premium instead
I love when they make variations on fake things too. Like Gundam unicorn perfectability mode
It's nuts
It has like 20-30 hg variations
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
Milking all those Gundam unicorn suits by slightly changing their colors and slapping the Gundam narrative version on the box
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
But thank God we are getting another Gundam unicorn or Gundam astray variant instead
~~all it's alternate packs are pbandai~~
No reco, Barbatos (it's apparently getting one now) 00 Diver Ace, Build Burning, atlus gundam
~~why did sunrise stop giving us Master grades of main character mobile suits~~
~~totally have a blue destiny unit 1 hg unbuilt on my shelf~~
Strange. I feel like that would've been perfect to release around stradust and 08th ms
Blue destiny never got an ova right?
Rip. I heard that
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I totally have a built F91 and a Vigna Ghina tho
Oh yea I also don't have F91 under my belt. Those 4
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Cardgames?
V, A, and X are the only Gundams I haven't seen yet
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
I've never watched Victory Gundam. I remember tomino himself saying to not watch it in an interview cause he made it while he was depressed
I think it's interesting that the GP line was originally one Suit but it was too much to handle so they despersed it's qualities to 3 Gundams instead
I love the GP series
I want the kit of it
Also dendrobium ftw
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>

I own a kit of both of them
I agree
I haven't really enjoyed a nobunaga anime since Nobuna Oda
Happy to share the love of the genre with you tho
But you've read the books so I'm sure u know more than me
I love the setting
<@279341087494242304>
All three kessen games
I've played every rotk starting on the ps2 gen. All the DW and SW games. (Minus a couple here and there) all the nobunagas ambition games.
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Sorry to disappoint u
Eh....I meant the games. I'm uncultured and don't read book books
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
(and the catchphrase of the main character)
The one with the sharper claws wins. That's killing bites
But yes it was very lewd at times
I mean that's kinda vague
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
<@173112001684439040> as you shouldn't. Base things on your own merits and not others
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
A high octane fighting anime where people have animal dna allowing them to use the beneficial attributes of said animal
The anime in reference is Killing Bites
Oh I see. If I went by their ratings I would hate an anime I love
<@279341087494242304> what's better?
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
i don't categorize my anime I've watched so I don't look for alternativea
Was the best way to show what I'm watching this season
I haven't used Mal in years
*shrugs*
Tejina senpai is the one show on nobody's radar I feel like. It's a hilarious 7 min anime
<@279341087494242304>

<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I'm a huge romance of the three kingdom nerd
But I do
I don't know a good way to show all the anime I'm watching this season
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<@279341087494242304> i tried it but it didn't seem super interesting. I at least tried
~~or at least a new GP01 / GP02~~
~~sunrise needs to make 1/100 scale dendrobium and Neue Ziel~~
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
GATOOOOOOOOO
If only VNs were popular like sports games or cod
Sadly
I agree. It's not often I get to talk about VNs to someone
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I thought u figured that out yesterday
It's nice having a female that's not high-pitched lol
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
That scene with her son in her breasts was so cringe tho
I agree. The archetype has more pros than cons for me
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Cause who needs more than one dimension to their characters amirite?
Like the twintail tsundere
I don't think that will ever die. Just an archetype people like
One was super popular and now everyone copies it
It's the call of duty for animes
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
<@256945399338631168> any genre or setting can be good if the person making it tries hard enough
Kenja no Mago was actually an okay Isekai anime from last season. One of those rare shows that doesn't insult your intelligence
Every season I hope we get another konsuba
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Also good morning
NEVER!
<@220201140141162496> hey man I'm a glass half full kind of guy. I just think, hey maybe this anime won't be a complete dengerate piece of slag.
I'll give it the benefit of the doubt cause it's been funny but the next scene like that I'm out
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Not incest scenes
Dammit milfsekai you had so much potential. Stop being nasty with son and mom shit
Started me down the slide of all it's goodness
Oh that's dope. I got into it thanks to DW4 on PS2.
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I liked the koijime musou visual novel
Uh I think Hitman reborn was the one u rated a 10
Maybe I should take an effort to mark everything I got with a score
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Why did u drop shows u rated a 9 or 10
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I don't rate my animes
I swear my brain is a dum dum
You're just missing To the Abandoned Sacred Beasts but otherwise everything Im watching is on your list (plus way more lol)
You are are watching Tejina senpai too? Hell yea
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Sorry for making u get up
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
~~playing 4D chess~~
<@139432096023183360> I was trying to throw them off the trail of your group
<@132577277262168064> what u watching this season
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
But u also aren't in voyers group watch
~~cause you know nobody else will~~
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
It wasn't really a lecture. More like he wanted suggestions of our favorites
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<@486087033652248576>
<@139432096023183360> I thought u were someone different for a second thanks to your new pic lol
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
It was planned then cancelled
I hate how no Blu Ray remaster of it exists.
Slayers is a gem
The brain is a strange thing
I honestly forgot this existed until I saw it on my Mal and now I remember everything about it
Good old 90s anime xD
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
Animemusicquiz? Wut?
That's the animes name
Anyone remember DNA2
Man I forgot a lot of old animes. Going down memory lane here
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
So for my Mal I'm deleting animes that I can barely remember to give a score to
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Tomoyo after episode best clannad episode
I found her waaaay boring vs the actually interesting girls
I also dropped the anime cause of nagusa
I think the amount of animes I have at a 10 on Mal can be counted on one hand or two
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I gave Naruto way more watch time than I shouldve
I've gotten very jaded with age
All the new people that started watching anime thanks to the first episode being so edgy
Hope u enjoy it tho manifezt
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
When I realized no main character was going to die ever. I kinda checked out cause the tension was gone for me
I personally stopped caring about aot after season one. When it ended and I read further in the manga I found the plot.... not good. In the nicest way I can say lol

Putting it on my to watch list
Oh needless is actually fairly recent (last decade)
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>

The hole at the end reminds me of the hole in gaogaigar
Just watched the needless opening. This looks way too cool for a nerd like me
Dess
I learned what an API is today
Not android
Desktop app
Ohhh
Is the anilist app called anidroid?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
So...?
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Is anilist better than Mal?
Oh u can chAne the order?
I think I'm gonna load up my computer and just start with 2018 anime and go backwards filling up my Mal to completeion
May as well have never watched it lol
I only rated the ones I had either good or bad memories of. Ones I had a difficulty remembering anything about. I just deleted
That's a majority of my list porbably lol
Didn't take nearly as long as I thought it would to rate stuff
https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Ayamine
Okay so I rated all the stuff that's completed on there tho I haven't added new shows in forever but here's my MAL atm.
The good old days when nipples were allowed on more than just men
Almost posted cutie honey opening but then I remembered it has naked women in it
~~but I need to know how nami and Robin got so busty after the time skip~~
Lol
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Should I start one-piece
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
She had the drill punch when fighting nephilim
Nah she watched it during or before season 2
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
Gross

Do either of those have names? I feel like I've never heard them
Ogawa is ninja manager
God that song is so catchy
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
ITS TIME FOR ONE PIECE
Ruroni kenshin
Miku accidently watched Yuri on ice cause Yuri was in the title
citrus *cringes*
<@437292788611153931>GOD WHY
Bikki would watch hajime no ippo
Chris would watch like trigun or cowboy bebop
None of them. Anime ja nai girl watched it tho
I rage quit after that
I dropped Naruto in Shippuden when Naruto and orochimaru were standing on a bridge staring at each other and so many flash backs happened that nothing actually progressed
I *hated* a majority of the filler
The anime is probably the worst medium to see the story of Naruto.
That's fair
As a dragonball fan. It's awful
This isn't meant to be 60fps lol
Why u guys up so early @.@
~~i did like that fight tho~~
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Good thing I'm not Maria. And won't be getting jobbed by garie
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Sure let me punch u with GUNGNIR
Lewd
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
That care about you saki. That want your Android maids in working order
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
It's nice having people that are fun to talk to
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Sent Melua a spicy dm
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Jalapeno's?
Spicy dms
Oh
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
~~causw Melua has no friends that ping melua~~
Sry for bothering u Melua.
<:KirikaSpook:602224871585480776>
I was looking for the best site to keep track of my anime and ratings and was wondering if u knew of anything better than Mal
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I pinged everyone else that tolerates my existence
<@189146272865845248> u were already talking to me silly. And yes ~~but I don't want to @ at everyone~~
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<@99695384296701952> <@279341087494242304> <@87512939107450880> <@152896851660505088> <@256945399338631168>
Calling all anime fans!
Decided to stop procrastinating
Before i start this task on mal. Is there a better site to use for keeping all my anime logged and rating them etc. ?
I've watched 12 episode animes with better story development than all of this show
Yea after a certain point I'm just like. Can this just be over now? Jesus
Yes I watched quote a bit initially too cause I did like it at first
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I really liked her
I didn't know that about Carly actually
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
They also had to change plot cause the meta demanded it
~~Do et!~~
She was dope
The closest we got was the blonde biker girl from 5Ds
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
You think they'll ever give us a female duelist that's main purpose isn't to be jobbed for the main char to save?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
He would've been at that tournament for sure
(where was Jaden in the movie anyways)
They've had a lot of people reprise their roles for the mobile game. Would love a GX movie
YOU GONNA FIGHT ME WITH FRUIT
Kaiba was hilarious
That recent yugioh movie was decent. Really funny too
Didn't yugi help make his whole deck cause it was only monsters initially?
<@185949743321579520> u remind me I still need to play VC4
~~super ultra mega chicken~~
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Tfw Jaden fought yugi and they cut it like the sopranos
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
That feeling when the shadow realm isn't real.
Remember when Yami killed people? Good times
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Extra zone?
Yugioh stopped being fun after 5ds for me
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I'm sorry I'm a scrub
Too bad it never existed in the show
Yea that
Remember when touch fusion was announced and was cool until u learned it was only for one turn
I remember one where u end up a cop of you partner with trudge
The partner stories were interesting. Especially for side characters
<@185949743321579520> the tagforce games had story lines for each partner. So if u partnered with the bad guys you would be a villian
I never had the pleasure of playing it but I heard it was very difficult
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Oh are u thinking is Reshef of destruction for the GBA?
A majority of the DA ones are like thay
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
The DS games were fun cause u basically got to steal the spotlight from Yusei and the crew
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
As a dark signer
You even start as a bad guy in one of them
I miss the plots of the old games. Having your own character in WC games was fun
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
They don't anymore
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Anyone play the world championship games ? (Specially the 5Ds ones)
Well the meta screwed with Aki. Not carly
Ruining my animes
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Damn cults and meta
The red hair dude?
Too bad the second one didn't voice her from the start
Oh yea she does have two different VAs
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@185949743321579520> because blackfeathers
That's not hard. Kh3 was a mess lol
Man it's so early In the morning. I read that as kingdom hearts three movie
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
It's probably better than WS
It's fine. I don't play srw for the plot
*old OGs*
Any other OGs in T or just that?
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Yes I noticed time to come. Always a good track
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Man... No Gespenst kick or chest laser or hyper cannon. This robot is gimped
I guess I'll stick to using it in the OG games lol
The Gespenst is trash in T? That sucks. Usually they go out of their way to make it at least a viable unit
~~i love the Gespenst so I'm biased~~
So the non mc gets the better mech
Oh I see
<:KirikaSpook:602224871585480776>
Saizo uses a Gespenst?
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
A majority of her attacks was just the strikers.
<@99695384296701952> is this sagiri the MC of T? I watched her mech and it was... Not impressive. She's cute at least.
I still love my A portable for psp. And the DS ones
<@99695384296701952> honestly yes. I really only liked Z. Z2 and Z3 were major downgrades.
Just something about the series animation feels off to me now
I havent tried T. Was kinda burned out after V, moon dwellers and X
~~Z series was the last time srw was good~~
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<@99695384296701952> they're both such bangers. I love them
I'm glad u also like some of my favorite songs from Gundam xD
<@87512939107450880> I needed these. Thank you. Helping me get more upbeat
Anime related

<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
That must mean 90% of my collection is shit cause it wasn't super popular
<@189146272865845248> reading that qoute hurt me.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I missed the hate of ratings logic where a 6 or 7 is bad
<@99695384296701952>

Rip LBX
As someone who gave zero shits about gunpla before build fighters. I was absolutely enamored by it
I love fafner
<@173112001684439040> ITS SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT THO
HAIL ZEON
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
It's literally perfect (minus never showing the other world)
It's all good
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Gundam build fighters season 1 is the best Gundam series to date
Lmao
Could've picked better jazz songs
I love thunderbolt but god damn is that some bad jaz,
Hey she dissed slimes. Rimuru better not be in that world or she fucked
I figured that last robot would've been there. He's the easiest to throw into any srw game
Oh noice
Where's my master grade 1/100 of that fucker
BIG ZAM
~~this isn't Gundam  battle assault~~
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I miss Gundam Vs Zeta Gundam now
I think the shitty new Gundam breaker is there
Gundam Vs Zeta gundam is a cool way to play thru OG Gundam and Zeta Gundam with many pathways to see
Feel like they can flesh her out therr
I've enjoyed her in l the games she's been in
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I think Haman was the reason my type is strong older women
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I'm iliterate
Yes. I don't read
No clue and no
Cant wait for this dumpster fire of a story
<@87512939107450880> next year
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
God I love the sound track to fighters
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k_1j_uM5rN4
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Sorry I didn't think the song was that hype. Was a decent song but was kinda generic fantasy sounding in the middle
Makes me feel like I'm at the login page of phantasy star during the 1 min mark lol
This is super slow. The exact opposite of hype
Fun game
Likewise
Well it's definitely not for everyone
True but the fun of building is the reason people do it.
~~i never did that~~
Which I don't. As long as it looks cool standing there I'm fine with it
A lot of builders care about posability when it comes to kits
I never pose my gunpla more than once or twixe
Which I want lol
Like the deep striker lol
Old + huge = very expensive
And it's big
It's an old hard to find kit
Yea that's the correct size one
Dendrobium HG mechanics is not a normal 1/144. Much smaller
It's a 1/550 scale tho
That dendrobium is very small lol
If there's ever a kit u want to buy. Hit me or voyer up. We can probably tell u if it's a good kit or not
Like crossbones, Sazabi, etc
Current ones have all been very good
Early RG are not so good.
Depends on how many gimmicks they try for RG
Those are the four main grades with some random outliers that don't fit into those four
The scale of HG at 1/144, the innerframe of master grades. And the piece count of perfect grades
RG is their  newest line. Which attempts to combine all their lines into one
PG is there 1/60 scale line. Very rarely used. Only for iconic things like OG Gundam, zaku 2, unicorn Gundam
MG is there 1/100 line that usually has inner frames to their kits. Not nearly as many releases for this tho
Most robots get built into this
Hg is the standard 1/144 size you will see
Sure I can
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Val varo. Big zam. Alphazeru. Nuel ziel(I know one exists of him in 144 scale) Elmeth, etc. Etc.
I seriously want model kits of all the mobile armors
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
But then I realized giant robots aren't real
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I wanted to be a mechanic when I was younger
The games and mobile suits just jive so much with me with zeon
Good and bad guys on both sides
Pretty much
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
It's not being rude. You can call them whatever you like.
Rip Zeon deikun and his original goal for zeon
Hail zeon
~~zeong is the best. They should be glorified always~~
I don't know the definition of that word
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Could you imagine how depressing og Gundam would be if it followed the revolving door of pilots that are forced to fight the Gundam?
I appreciate it cause in reality you don't always succeed. We just don't see those stories you know?
Zeon wasnt very unified when it came to making mobile suits. That's why u see so many variations. They competed with themselves to their own detriment
Probably. It's pretty depressing series lol
Rip guntank
I played a game where a woman was named Ratchet. She was awesome
Noice nickname
<@173112001684439040> I enjoyed that op. The orange blonde is my favorite character looks wise.
<@486087033652248576> but fire emblem
~~i probably couldn't afford it anyways~~
The Blu Ray looks so freaking good. I hate how they don't release it here
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I don't know what fight league is
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
WHY
~~soul of chogokin is expensive af~~
Bandai makes lines of very impressive Gundam action figures for people who don't like to build
It's a joke. Calm down peeps. If it matters so much I'll just delete it
I found unicorn and thunderbolt very enjoyable and that's the most recent UC stuff
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Why would zeon poison their own colonies?
They werent
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
In a normal let's poison an entire colonty kind of way
I mean I always thought efsf was dicks before unicorn existed
Rip dozle and garma
The good ones died first
Half the zabis are terrible
So...
I mean the earth federation did the first mass murder
Or poisoning an entire colonty
Yea it's just entertainment afterall
Nothing serious here
We just talking Gundam at this point
Such a clunky game but kinda unique
I miss Zeonic Front
If the zabi family didn't fuck it up zeon would've been great
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
I was a true believer. I knew day one it would be a reality
<@202444817043685386> wasn't that already confirmed when it's bluray sales were thru the roof? Lol
True
It's like when pubg was on the game nominees along with botw, Mario Odyssey and Horizon zero Dawn. Like lol okay (also pubg stole neir automata's spot. Fuck u pubg)
<@279341087494242304> I was so sure red dead would get it just cause red dead. Was pleasently surprised
Lol I remember how upset people were about the Yuri on ice awards
That's a good question. I'm unsure. They chose a good show at least
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It sure is confusing tho when the top 10 doesn't have an episode of a show so I have to skip it until I see it again on top 10
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
What u mean solo. This is obviously the most correct way to find the bestest of animes
Also man that Loli demon animes name is loooooong
Man Dr stone fell hard.
It was? I didn't know that
Like golden kamuy 2D was great. It's CGI was pure butt
I just want more stuff like land of illustrious and less of berserk. I've been seeing random CGI in animes at times and it really throws me for a loop
Are we in the era of too much CGI now?
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Mahoromatic season 2... *Cringes*
Rip digital killing a bunch of good animes for some years
Oof. Sometimes I forget how rough old anime looks. Doesn't look bad but my memory thought it looked better xD
I loved the ED for og season
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Gotta watch best girl of that show
*marks calenders*
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Where's the disappearence of Mikuru Asahina
<@152896851660505088> I did too
Why everyone gone
The dissapearence of haruhi suzumiya... The dissapearence of nagato Yuki.
Kinda shows how lots of slice of life shows episodes can be shuffled around without losing anything haha
That out of order order was so weird and bananas back in the day lol
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I remember when I watched episode 10 first
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
Wait what burned haruhi fandom? Sorry I only watched the original show.
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
Wait ensemble stars is a ccg made into an anime?
Back reading. I'm happing danmachi is in the top 5 most view anime this season
<@239893407122718721> just popping in but I noticed the vast difference between the two pics.
Tho I was disappointed the anime OP made it look like the group of people would do more but half the peeps didn't
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
People are shit. Nice to see An anime not shy away from it
I enjoyed it tho
AGAIN
The hate the main char gets from all the normies hurts. It's like fuck man. He JUST saved your lives
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
And brutal af
It was a crazy and pretty ride tho
You're not wrong. It felt like they squeezed a 24 episode show into a 12. Barely had any time to breath
~~not counting Zombieland saga of course~~
~~an actually good zombie anime for once~~
That anime was a trip
Speaking of movies. I need to see the Kabaneri movie that came out in may
If I don't like a show I know I can always resell it for more than I bought it for cause the average Joe doesn't notice those sales. Thank goodness for eBay lol
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I bought a bunch of shows I never watched actually. Super glad I did tho. I love Chihayafuru. Great blind buy
I will be more inclined to buy shows that I'm not super into for a price. When Sentai had a crazy sale last year for BF you could get full seasons for 6-7 bucks. Couldn't say no to that
Where's my kaleido star remaster
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I hate the sight of my DVDs tho. I want Blu Ray remasters of old shows
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I've had 25 years of anime watching to get a large collection of shows that I love
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
I've got about three shelves worth of anime I believe. Eventually I'll have a full bookcase
Great choice
~~will never own aniplex anime cause of their pricing~~
~~i like owning animes I super enjoyed~~
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Sentai has the 25th episode liscensed but no way to buy it
2013ish maybe 2012 was when I got back into watching seasonal anime
I watched the original airing.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
My Blu Ray only has ep 1-24
I don't think I ever saw this 25th episode either.
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
Sentai filmworks why u no release it!
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Apparently a film exists
A sequel to majestic prince?
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Makes me happy someone confirms that the anime exists
<@99695384296701952> I'm literally watching majestic prince fight scenes right now. It was seriously so good
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
I want ufotable to make a giant robot show
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I didn't know CGI skipped storyboarding. Thanks for the new info millhi
Doesnt ufotables draw over the CGI to make it more 2Desque?
I've been enjoying ufotables use of CGI with Kimetsu no yaiba
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
No clue if it got any merch.
<@99695384296701952> the anime in question I was thinking of was Hand shakers. But I don't have enough info outside of it being one of the lowest selling anime Blu Ray in the history of anime sales.
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
If a show does poorly sales wise in it's Blu Ray. Why would a company want to give it a second season. Don't they bank on those sales to recoup their costs of making the show?
He's free from his shackles!
I agree. I expected generic harem fantasy and it had quite a lot of good to it
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
That was the anime I was missing from the Blu Ray bunch. One of those animes that need a 2nd season but will never get one. *Looks at ngnl*
<@152896851660505088> ever watch campione?
Shows how observant I am. I thought I had everything
So I got a confirmation a package shipped that I didn't buy until I opened it up and noticed they never sent me one of the Blu Ray I ordered in my batch lol
~~you're already dead~~
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I like not mistaking a dude for a girl
Lolol
Those suicide bombs are kinda messed up. I wonder who had to invent those
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Dang pretty boys
To be fair guys barely get muscle too now
She was ripped. It was cool af
But her weapon was so cool!
I need to see that movie. I'm so hyped
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Yea. The Archer princess chick only used her bow once
They're called goblins. So I call them goblins
I mean one dude just uses a spear and normal armor it looks like
<@256945399338631168>
||other people in his class of adventurer are able to kill the big ass goblins without help and he gets wrecked quite badly for someone who excels at goblin slaying||
||I mean the one on one fights he does||
Also for someone who's good at killing goblins. He gets wrecked by a lot of goblins
Not bad mind you
After the first episode of shock value. It pretty much devolves into your average DND adventure of quest dungeon repeat
It's an alright show. The CGI drives me thru the roof. But it's like a nice generic DnD fantasy show lol
Had a stellar soundtrack
<@87512939107450880>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
So actiony
I loved that game
Oh Girls und Panzer was another blind buy. I bought the tv show, the two ova boxes and the movie. I'm currently done with the show and love it
I should check my shelves on other things I haven't watched
I made a lot of blind anime buys thanks to Sentai BF sale. Usually only picked things I only heard good things about tho. Chihayafuru, Haikyuu, Shirobako etc.
Bakuman? I think it was called
I liked reading that manga about making manga
Plotception
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I swear everything is getting a movie this year or next year
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
<@99695384296701952> I blind bought the Blu Rays. I'll watch it eventually. :p
This has all been very interesting to read
~~you only say that cause 9000 is bigger than 8000~~
~~8000~~
Goku's Battle Power
Just a badass who isn't afraid to muck up anyone's day lol
I loved it from episode one. I enjoy main characters like that
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Yet another fun anime that never got a S2
<@189158439316881408>
Is mondaiji the problem children anime?
I need to get back into dog days. Such a weird anime lol
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Is he a black hole cause he's the densest main character in the history of main chars?
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
And then trash like infinite stratos gets a second season
I really hate good animes that never get a second season
I hope so.
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
True. I have a feeling we won't ever get to that point with the anime with how many episodes is left
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Then again Japan loved Gundam seed above most other gundams. So their taste is questionable at times xS
Pig dude and Nezuko have had much less screentime than zenitsu and Im fairly sure they're Infinitely more liked lol. At least in the western. Cause I head zenitsu has the top poll of popularity in Japan manga somehow
Atm. You could delete zenitsu from the show and nothing would be lost. So I really hope they do something with him quick
Ie. Mineta from my hero
But what about the ones that never progress and are annoying to be qoute funny. But they're really not funny
I honestly just never understand creating purposely annoying characters
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Is he gonna assume it was the lady who saves him?
I'm curious how he's going to see who beat the spider
And zenitsu will just say someone else killed the monster like he usually does
His bird is the best
He needs to hurry up and realize. Cause I can't stand him and his constant whining
He's funny and is growing as a person
I like pig dude
Cause he's annoying af
I hate lightning dude
Is it Saturday yet
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
UGHHH
The cliffhanger for the most recent episode tho
He may give them pity but they still have to die
Yes it is. Also the main character isnt naive and tries to save the villians
I already have Kimetsu no Yaiba as my battle shounen show and it's leagues more interesting
Which is what I was afraid of
<@256945399338631168> I honestly dropped fire force after episode one. It just was so generic to be. It had some nice animation and a nice muscular girl and that was it for me.
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Hibiki punched a punching bag off into a wall. Can you do that?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@486087033652248576> are you machio buff?
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Is nobody watching fire force anymore? I thought it came back
That's one I still haven't tried.
You can tell he's having a ton of fun
Machio is easily my favorite male character this year
LETS BULK
<@486087033652248576>i already watched all the segments once I learned of it
<@486087033652248576> I only just noticed on the most recent episode that there's an actual work out  segment after the credits
Tejina Senpai has been such a cute and funny show. ~~with a ton of great lewd content~~
That game anime has been decent. Nothing crazy good but I like the weird ways they take the animation at times. It's quite unique. And I honestly can never guess where it goes next
Astra lost is space has been quite good too. The most current episode especially
I personally don't see the appeal of Joshiki. But then again a lot of Japan comedy falls flat for me. Dumbell and oh maidens has been my go to for laughs/entertainment this season
<@185949743321579520> the most recent episode of Dr stone was half flashback. Probably it's weakest episode but I still enjoyed it up to that point.
I'm so happy that dumbell is loved. It's so good
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
My brother is so lucky I sift thru the mediocrity and only show him good shows
I mean it's no hand shakers or my sister my writer. But damn it's so mediocre it hurts
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
The show would improve if it was never released
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
I remember trying second season and dropped it hard after the first episode
And the Chinese childhood friend
I liked the blonde girl with the blue mech
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<@486087033652248576> they even had the gall to have a blonde Char in it
I've really been enjoy master of killing time Seki kun.
That's land of lustrous right?
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I'm really shallow and if I don't like the looks of the main char I might never watch it even if it's good
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Sailor moon is like the only magical girl that had a boy love I can think of ofhand. I also don't watch many
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Cause magical girls can't have bfs apparently
Anime was a mistake
A boy?
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Interesting
Gotcha. I've only heard people complain about how the characters are very off model from the manga.
<@329080892138061827> is it any good?
Man that anime looks strange
Scarred for life
Speaking of smt. I need to go play IV and apocalypse. Ever since I lost my original physical copy of IV I never got to trying it again
<@90164247643828224> don't most of the games usually have you fight Metatron and not YHVH himself?
And blocks his view from the teacher lol
He can get away with it cause the student in front of him is quite tall
It's so wild at times
Basically follows a girl who notices the kid to the left of her is always doing something to pass time in the class
<@193408538909868033> that show might be up your alley. The art is very simplistic but the stories it tells each episode for 5 mins is quite amusing
Jesus this sounds like a hot mess
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Also u guys forgot the best part of the episode ||NEZUKO SPOKE WORDS (in her head)||
I do think it's strange that we finally get to see the final form only for it to change in the first fight we see it in.
At least that's how I see it
After his father passed away he had to be the man of the house and take care of them and probably was just too busy with his feeding of what 4-5 siblings plus mom?
It sounds like one of those things he learned as a child but forgot cause it's like a decade later. (I assume tanjiro is like 15-16)
If the show was mediocre till now and they pull that I would've been mad. But it's been so good for a majority of it's run.
So I can forgive this
I've seen waaaaaay worse ass pulls than that.
It doesn't bother me honestly.
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Holy crap was that the most hype thing I've seen this year.
If the latest episode of Kimetsu no Yaiba isn't on the top 10 for r anime. They have failed me.
I love animes that are so ahead of their current time
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Like the first movie is 07 but could be mistaken for this year
I've also been told I need to watch the garden of sinners movies cause they're next level animation
I never watched any of their fate stuff outside of a YouTube video here and there that people showed me but I always heard they were fantastic
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I'm thankful whoever made this happen with ufotable
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Even then I can't imagine them doing any of the rotation stuff well. Like that one demon in the house.or the arrow demon
If it was any other studio I feel like Kimetsu no Yaiba would've bombed or been an average anime at best
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Ufotable needs to do an animation training seminar to up the game of other studios.
<@132577277262168064> yes
I have a hard time describing why I like a lot of shows
Jesus people loved season 1
I always hate when I see bad directors ruin anime and good directors not get brought back for sequel seasons
While the good workers get thrown away
<@468591607332208641> nah man people like that Fail upwards somehow. Never fired
Rip
Money is what matters most. And they fucked themselves
I'm sorry but does pride put food on the table? No.
I swear people are idiots
I don't understand. Why would u force things on the studio after that were a smash success. Just tell them. Hey do what u did again and continue making it a success
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Can I please have episode 20 of Kimetsu no Yaiba now
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
<@486087033652248576> waiting on that r/anime thread
they usually are lol
such a disappointment
i thought u know the show was having consequences or weight to it but NOPE lets just reset everything back to status quo
i noped so hard when they pulled a Deus Ex machina end of season 1 or 2
probably. people love trashy shows
symphogear is one of those weird animes that somehow gets more than two seasons. reminds me of louise the zero and how it got 4 seasons. but symphogear is at least good.
<@!178202474312630273> if you consider this a lot. dont ever touch bleach,naruto or one piece lol
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
this is the 5th time ive watched the latest episode of kimetsu no yaiba.
i mean what nobunaga show doesnt take liberties? lol
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
i tried the first episode. which is more than most people
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<@!279341087494242304> thats three more than i was expecting
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I haven't watched it yet
i was thinking of showing her the borrowers next
<@!280768792890703885> i have not. thats one of the last ghibli films i dont own yet
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
My mom loves Disney stuff so I tried to show her castle in the sky. She was nonplussed about it
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Tho I hear they didn't get Kate Higgins to voice Alisa and thats super depressing for me
I should go back to watch it now that it's dubbed
I remember their God Eater anime looked verrrrry weird to me
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
A non action ufotable anime? What is this heresy
(different studio I know but now I'm just thinking of great animes)
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
Violet evergarden will never not be pretty AF.
Hopefully
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I enjoy goblin Slayer more than most of the trashy Isekai out
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Not everything has to be an iskekai to be fun
I like that demon loli anime. That's a fun fantasy world
im definitely getting Full isekai fatigue at this point
its like episode 18 or 19 right now and went all isekai
correct. two cours
while most shows are billed around 12. some shows to get ordered for the around 24 mark for two cours
its not getting anything extra
it was always a 24 episode show
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
like why
Yu-No has been so bad cause the director wanted to make the character even more of a pervert
i really do hate when Directors of animes have some OTHER vision for the show than what was originally given
No harem
It avoided like every usual pitfall of iskekai animes
I really enjoyed that anims
There was an Isekai I watched recently that should've been generic af. But it actually didn't insult the watchers... Oh kenja no mago
U saved yourself from cancer
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Remember Masters of Ragnarock~~bottom~~?
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Magic guns
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
God the names of Japan stuff just... Why
I already to it trademarked. Sorry
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I already did
Too late
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
I remember reading that calling someone Kirito on Japan is the equivalent of calling them a bad anime fan in the west.
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I just imagine someone taking out a LN and physically eating it
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Just look at junk food
Because love to consume trash
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
By adapating other forms of media or being anime original
True LN are pretty trash
~~A good DD session is usually better than most media cause you are in the thick of it~~
Two years isn't that big of a gao
That's still around the same time
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I did say it came out around NGNL
I still need to watch the movie
I love NGNL but damn to some TV's make it hard to watch
And makes some people's eye bleed lol
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
It came out around the same time as NGNL and sadly is in the same predicament of no season 2
I loved the badass main char. He literally kicks s god in the face first episode
These problem children from another world. I think is the English title
Mondaiji, slime, kenja, overlord, konosuba are my top 5 pics. Not in that order.
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Kenja no mago from the outside should've been just one of your generic awful Isekai like cheat magician but it somehow wasn't.
Like wtf
Or even end and they never hook up
God I hate animes that do thag
I seriously love the fact they don't beat around the bush for the whole season
Like when the plot advanced and it wasn't because of the main char. I was shocked
The side characters actually do things
But yea Kenja no mago is on my very short list of  Isekai I would actually recommend to people.
And he's really only strong cause he can apply science to his magic casting. Otherwise anyone could do what he can
<@209896097026408449> no harem, guy actually gets a GF, he kills people and doesn't have angst about his choices. His buddies are fun and not there to just make him look better.
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
I refuse to believe anything otherwise!
Lies
Faces. Sorry
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Make izayoi kick multiple gods asses
Screentime wiae
I feel like cat girl got shafted pretty hard compared to the other two
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Izayoi is true main character
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Why
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I would watch it tho
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
If I don't like the main characters looks. I won't watch a show about them
But I hate how he looks. And I'm shallow
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
I never started accel world cause I hated the midget pigboy main char
Asuna got isekai'd in ALO arc
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Millhi agreed with me!
SAO popularized the Isekai category. It's not the father tho
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I like the gundam franchise versions of military cause no one side is truly right or wrong
Gate was the one isekai I skipped hard. Looked very unappealing. Is it actually good?
the manga is good tho cause the main char is much less forgiving
eh.. i feel like i enjoyed it less and less as it went on
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
The giant robot always made me think of that animation studio with the same name
I don't remember the animation too well anymore for it but I can't forget that song
Like seriously the opening is so good music wise
Lit*
Dayum that OP is lot
She does?
That's so random lol
It's so much more than that
almost everyone
i like the current Demon Loli anime cause everyone seems a okay that a demon girl is living in a human village
you think we'll ever get a S3 to Magi?
for my shelf
of S1
i also need the blu ray
ME TOOOOO
Zombieland Saga also had a great Protagonist
Hinamatsuri had some grat protags. but it feels more like an ensemble cast and was freaking hilarious/amazing
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
hitori bocchi
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
i did watch some of Nande Koko ni Sensei Ga but that was ver censored and erotic... waiting for the blu ray of that
oh and Kenja no mago
Hitori bocchi, Kimetsu no yaiba, Kono oto Tomare ( a sleeper hit that i feel nobody watched), Yu-No (which is just awful), ... and the second cours of Dororo, and shieled hero. were what i watched last season
Hitori bocchi was probably my favorite show from last season
Konosuba parts were the only entertaining part for me. And there wasn't enough of it
I dropped it around episode 6
I was honestly really disappointed by isekai quartet
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
Last season had kimetsu no yaiba
<@98541382393688064> it's funny. I've seen people complain how this season isn't good but I feel like this season in watching the most anime concurrently in awhile.
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Get out of my head datto
Lol I was legit thinking of the cute hex maniac fan comics
Too spoopy for me
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
But it's such a banger now
Oh maidens first episode was also quite weak outside of the finale
Maybe I'll give it a shot again later but that first episode was pretty weak
Japanese comedy shows has always been very hit or miss for me
It wasn't my wheelhouse. The jokes didn't land for me.
Ohhh I think I know which one you are referring to. I honestly dropped it after epsiode one
<@98541382393688064>
I known oh maidens. What's wasteful days?
outside of Vinland saga everything else this season just feels mediocre in comparison.  i feel bad for doing that comparison
Tanjiro is seriously such a refreshing main char good to a fault. not stupid to try to save a murderer like other shounen protags
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
im now just imagining the fights in MHA with UFOtable
nezuko is seriously the cutest thing in anime right now
<@90164247643828224> the show is so good. if you havent caught up the last few eps have been amazing
<@!279341087494242304>  thats cool but im sad that art isnt a little more faithful
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
<@132577277262168064> yes. What did u originally think i was referring to?
<@329080892138061827> I watched it. Season one was amazing. Season 2 is still great but I feel like wasn't as impactful as 1. The movie was strange but fun. And I look forward to season 3 shenanigans
I still haven't watched all the shows episodes from last week
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Nope
just wait for the game
its really mediocre
no
i think its worth a watch. if it ends good this could be the sleeper hit of this season
it honestly reminds me a bit of danganronpa but its so crazy
<@!279341087494242304>
9 streamers of different genres of videogames are kidnapped and trapped on a large deserted(?) island. and people are watching their streams and forced to do taskes by a man llama ins a suit. and they must reach 100 million views or they can never leave the island. death is also possible so to be careful
then i'll have one person to talk to about it
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<@!279341087494242304> give it a shot.
it also changes visually at times to be more impactful and i enjoy that too
im enjoying it. i would have a hard time saying its particularly good. but its definitely the most interesting premise this season and i have literally no idea where the story will go each episode so thats cool
is the japanese title
Nakanohito Genome [Jikkyouchuu]
yes
<@!279341087494242304> oh hey since you are the only person watching nobunaga. i feel like im the only person watching The Ones Within.
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Night night
But now I must sleep. 1am and all
Neat. I'll have to give it a shot.
This sounds like something along the lines of Zombieland saga
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
Shows*
I never tried that. Looked interesting but I know idol shoes aren't me wheelhouse
So many shows
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
And so does Killing Bites
Hinamtsuri needs another season
Magi desperately needs a third season
Other animes that need a second season are Mondaiji and NGNL
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
I will genocide you
It got one season and that was it
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
No it didnt
Even says at the end of the last episode to see you next season
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Nadesico. Cause it was supposed to get a second season but got canned
Seriosuly another cliff hanger KnY you're killing me
<:BabyAcuguy:611572949903867906>
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>

<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I just realized that I'm going to need to save money for Zombieland saga merch if it's at my convention
You thief!
<@98541382393688064> that'll be twenty dollars

Fuck u arsonist
I like that thought
<:regretkan:535364298046832650>
But how will they accomplish it with all that loss
<:Miku:455802571437637652>
Wait violet evergarden is supposed to get a movie next season? Is that still happening?
<:RachelBaggy:458277858859548673>
When u read people complaining about the latest episode of KnY and wonder why the earth is still populated
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Kimetsu no Yaiba tomorriw
Lol I do miss long hair tanjiro
<@279341087494242304>
i remember magic kknight rayearth. i never watched it but i know it exists lol
no not really. i dont know what they have honestly. i just know them as the cardcaptor and holic guys
they really dont want to leave their comfort zone huh?
lmao
anything outside of cardcaptors? lol
do they do anime still? i feel like i havent seen their studio do anything in a long while
Clamp is so weird tho
i think its an alternate univere like with xxxholic cause they childhood flashbacks arent anything like cardcaptors world
like xxxholic is connected to tsubasa chronicles but i  dont know if tsubasa chronicles is actually connected to Card Captors
its so weird lol
also theres an OVA in tsubasa chronicles where they go to a world that has totally not Lelouch in it
least*
i feel like tsubasa chronicles is the lease Twig like but still kinda
Quality Clamp lol
Quack
<:tsurunostare:572978350931312640>
<@279341087494242304> bruh shiki
<:worrylove:608960688596975616>
Sometimes original content can really add to the show if done well. Like all the extra content for Violet evergarden. I couldn't imagine the story without the extra beginning stuff that was anime only
Yet it was one of my favorite episodes
<@155150213445582850>the episode with that demon lady who falls in love with a man who takes care of her. Was completely anime original
Yea the anime is definitely the way to ever enjoy that story imo
Hell hyakkimaru had telepathic powers in the manga and could talk like a normal person
Yes. The ending was very non ending like how a lot of Japan stuff was and it was almost comedic with some action here and there
Added characters or things that never existed but feel as if they were always there.
I like how mappa did Dororo. Took an average manga and fleshed it out
Ah clamp is a very small group now. No wonder I never hear from them anymore. Only 4 people
NVM I misread
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
People complain about exclusives but they tend to be the best looking games of each gen
Yea especially the PS3 only titles
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
I remember that one PS3 that has literally a PS2 in it cause it can't emulate it like ps1
<@256945399338631168> gotcha. I knew it was one of those two. Couldn't remember which.
Like how
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I'm still shocked at kojima getting 60fps constant in ZoE
I believe that 100% melua
<:worrydumb:608960688815341608>
Xbox just chilling over here with 720p and even 1080i
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Remember when the GameCube could do 480p and barely anything PS2 could do that?
Cause of it's... Unique hardware
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Porbably. I heard the ps2 was a nightmare to make games for ironically when it had the most games lol
Just clean it up a bit. Cause u can have sharp detailed pixel art
I don't mean  make it like the current SRW
I wish there was a way to clean it up and release it on PS4 or switch
Man I miss srw alpha 3
But I remembered her well
Yea she was just an add on for this attack in W
That knowledge is scary
Jesus melua
Yea her!
<:worrydumbthink:608960688156835851>
I can't remember
No she had pink hair and I think was with the two toned color robots from gaogaigar.
<:worrydumb:608960688815341608>
Wasn't there a pink haired chick as a normal unit too? I can't remember if she was apart of the Brave series robots or her own thing.
Yep
I remember tekkaman blade being extremely good for what he was xD
I think the massive change is what stopped the show from a season 3 sadly.
Quite the difference between both seasons imo

<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Oh... I just learned the original animation director actually passed away. No wonder s2 was so different.
You'd be the only one then kritka(that I know of). I don't think I saw anyone not notice the much lower quality difference between the two season.
How could you not? Everyone looks so different and less detailed
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I don't need another OPM or log horizon s2 in my life
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
The fights they did had so much depth that I don't think any other studio could get close
I refuse!
If this ever goes to a different studio. I'm out
Ufotable better do all of them
<@279341087494242304> I really hope at some point that give back story on the big bad. I'm curious how the original demon came to be
Like the anger he got towards mom spider but then able to put that anger aside. Was such a damn good moment
I really do enjoy how he doesn't go full revenge or full retard compassion.
Minus thread girl. That cunt deserved to die. Fucking coward
Yea I really love both of them. I also like pig dude. The new butterfly girl. And how they somehow make me feel empathy for even the shittiest of people. Cause at the end of the day nobody wanted to be a demon
Not even ufotable can do a game adapation to anime right xD
The psp game was so much better
<@279341087494242304> ~~we don't talk about that~~
Fate would be a lot worse without them
I mean u could say that about any anime made by ufotabld
It had slight pacing issues for like a single episode but I've enjoyed it 100% outside of that (minus zenitsu)
I actually do think demon Slayer is amazing tho.
<@155150213445582850> they probably just picked random words that are good to describe something xD
<:worrydumbthink:608960688156835851>
Then again I dropped it after a couple episodes but what do I know
I really don't understand the fandom for BC. Shueisha literally made it copy tons of other things and use a formula other animes used to print money. There's no soul in the show from what I can tell
<@155150213445582850> I think it was just saying that anyone can find enjoyment out of these shows. Minus BC of course
<@279341087494242304>
<:TB:441562395245281281>

<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I honestly can't believe xxxholic is still going to this day
Pretty much lol
If that's anything to go by
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Says they roginally had 11 members
animes that never get a bluray upgrade make me sad
i have the angelic layer blu ray remaster on my shelf. still havent watched it xD
So I just caught up with the Ones Within. It's been so strange. I'm loving it. I wish other people were also watching it. This must be how <@279341087494242304> feels about nobunaga
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<@185949743321579520> where can I see each week btw?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
The top 5 are 3/5 a sequel season.
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
<@185949743321579520> thank u for pointing that out. I literally missed that text. Aren't second seasons technically from past seasons too tho?
Or does it not count 2 cour shows
Why is KnY never on the top 10? It's past like 3-4 episodes have been too tier af
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<@468591607332208641> we could've had a second amazing database song to enjoy
Lazy fucks lol
also is log horizon the only anime to actually reuse their opening song between seasons?
DATABASE DATABASE
<@99695384296701952> also thank u for the info
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
It was so chill
Man now u make me wish maoyu got a second season
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
It's quite the dilemma
Like I want to buy anime I love but it also kinda sucks when some of that money goes to bad people
<:worrydumbthink:608960688156835851>
I'm trying to remember. Isn't the creator of ruroni kenshin a pedo or did something illegal
Thank*
I think u for that
Japan usually cares about that a LOT
Yes that's crazy to me
Writer might as well be dead at this point
Oof
<:wha:605615075054583820>
All these tax evasions. Just pay your taxes jesus
Oh yes I remember hearing about that. Isn't ufotable also doing that. Or some other big company
I assume it's just a culture gap thing. They probably don't baby their children over there like we do here. With our (currently) stupid humor cartoons.
It's kinda hard to watch too. Definitely feels like a kids show
Yea it's long lol
<@90164247643828224> did u watch the prequel?
<:worrylove:608960688596975616>
You watched Hyobu Kyosuke
do they do good subs>
oh nice they got Arpeggio
i dont know if i own any discotek stuff
i wonder how it will be priced
discotek i love u
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
this is new to me
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
i was never informed
pls no bulli
dont give me hope
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
*stares at symphogear*
i know i'll never buy them but hey for people who do. glad you can at least own animes you like
i mean it must work cause they still release things
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
and price
hmm i'll have to take a look when i get home
i dont know the consensus on Funimation and Sentai subs but ive enjoyed Sentai blu rays
thats kinda funny. they charge the most but have bad subs.
are aniplex subs bad? i would think professionally paid subbers would do a good job
i mean the movie released awhile ago.
<@87512939107450880>
what do u mean?
hmm?
Xan wants animes i actively avoid. cant help outside of the already mentioned Girls Und Panzer
i am unable to watch videos at work sadly
i was rolling xD
when she nearly fainted
my favorite part was her when she realized she had to get up at like 5am
thats neat
really? i cant tell cause of how much lower it is
im not gonna remember that
also girl who likes to sleep was my favorite
ikr? i was kinda surprised at how well they did it
i loved the silliness of the massive cast and the obsurdity of finding random derelict tanks on a moving ship
i enjoyed the tv show. it was fun and cute. and has some nice tanks
i know the movie is last lol
yea i remember reading that
i still havent watched the two ovas i bought or the movie lol
<:sweat:550739406739472395>
why dont i rmemeber that when i watched the 12 episodes
it did?
<:wha:605615075054583820>
I've seen better games from a group of 12 or less people
Bandai namco make better games. They feel so cheap and unfufilling
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
For many things
I do
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Hell we are just getting a Barbatos MG
<@145705908716961792> u say that but they barely make any master grades of the newest shows anymore. Unless they make more off of the HG
It's pretty but that's about it
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Like the gundam 00 movie
<:smuglucy:449882231817764864>
<@145705908716961792> if the movie wasn't better than the show. That's one shitty ass movie
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Not gonna lie. I missed the crossed out text.  <@152896851660505088> sry
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
I feel like I'm the only one who enjoyed the TV show of GuP from start to finish
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
So someone described Zenitsu as ultra instinct shaggy. And I feel like that fits way better than it should
That's fine.i grew up on the dub
<:reirahappy:572976091900411908>
Discotek is releasing medabots physically? Oh shit. I gotta get that. Idc that its SD on Blu ray
Latest Kimetsu no Yaiba was funny af
Like they ran out of budget or something.
Enjoyed it but it feels like it ended prematurely
I also recognize princess waltz
<@87512939107450880> G senjou
Also Dr. Stone is really hitting it's groove now. Was really funny this episode
I remember that VN
I really like how danmachi is tackling the term of what is pure and what is dirty
Lol yea VNs tend to have a lot lol
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Had no clue those movies had sex in them
If they didn't cost my leg I would try one
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Niceeee
Sol raptor was one I was interested in
<:worrylove:608960688596975616>
Any pics of her?
Oh how are the megami device?
<:teehee:518810026769645571>
I would hope so millhi
I really want to try their HMM line for zoids. I've been told that they're the best koto has done
<@228698437594513408> what have you tried?
<:worrydumb:608960688815341608>
Shit doesn't fit right all the time and feels cheap
I think I'm gonna lean towards the plastic
I dunno if it's the plastic they use or how much extra work you have to put into the kit to make it look like the box art.
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
I personally hate  the feel of the muvluv kits and the one fag kit I got
<:smuglucy:449882231817764864>
I tried
Full armor girl?
I swear my 1/100 F91 is as big as a standard sized 1/144
Or f91 lol
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
How I hate how you're shorter than other gundams. Don't match on my shelf
Oh gundam wing..
<:worrypopcorn:608960684209995776>
I mean 5 new suits isn't that hard if that includes grunts
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Like how they ruined gundam build fighters
Fucking bandai. Is gonna ruin the whole gundam series
<:pepederp:545099288598806568>
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<@486087033652248576> can I use my 2 foot tall anime figure as a titan and renact a specific anime?
So like 500ish at the end of the day
But then shipping costs you like another 100-200 bucks lol
Yea the neo Zeong is around 300 bucks for something that sits at 36 inches
<@486087033652248576>

I can only think of like two model kits that beat the titan in size
The titans dwarf even that
Man like even a perfect grade only runs you around 13ish inches
But most people will usually color their gunpla with paint anyways. But you can be a cheapo like me and just not
Does it come painted or no?
That's insanity
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
2 feet tall
<:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
Holy F. How tall is that
<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
It's okey
I'm comparing
Gunpla is anime
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
I wanna see a titan
<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
Also u get way bigger cooler things to look at
But then I would also have to buy the extra parts MG backpack to actually make it the star build strike. Since they made the strike full package only in MG
I want a star build strike MG so badly
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Don't ruin my enjoyment of anime
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
How do they do it in a week
Our American cartoons pale in comparison
You know thinking about it. It's kinda crazy how good anime looks when we have it week to week
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<@279341087494242304> tsukihime 2 never actually coming is a known fact
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Space makes everything better
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I like the guntank

I played thru the story line in the SD gundam G generation PS4 game
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
I never watched igloo
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Vidolfnir is more like a supped up Zaku tank
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Then contract a top builder to do it for me cause I know id fuck it up
If I was rich I'd buy it
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Like. When was this made?
Jesus. I've never heard of this before
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
And those exist in minis form?
Wut?
<:smuglucy:449882231817764864>
But yes
I wouldn't call this mini

<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>

Not like the Zaku machine guns or bazookas had good rang either lol

To be fair. Banagher didn't follow up

I never liked Garmas death. He's the one person char could've brought to his side

Zeon had way too much infighting
Seems redundant
Aren't tanks supposed to be mobile?

She was my favorite char
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Lenessia was the worst.
At least the girls who got screen time
But I feel there were more bad transitions than good ones
The characters introduced in s2 looked good too
Loli ninja looked better
True
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

Day season 2 tho
Season 1 was okay
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>

<:smuglucy:449882231817764864>
Log horizon. Oh wait they never changed it once in 50 episodes
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Hell some zeon pilots didn't want to go to space cause they'd only been fighting in gravity and figured they'd die up there

Lots of zeon suits were left behind to protect the HLVs launching every resource they could into space

<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I wish the gihrens revenge games were localized. You could shimmy around some of the dick heads
When in doubt. Go For Blu Ray rips. you never know if they'll touch it up to make people buy the prettier version
Blu Ray is a must
<@456226577798135808>

<@145705908716961792> don't forget them completely redrawing someof the bad art
Rightstuf has a pretty decent sale on Sentai products on their site right now
I was told a majority of the main people who did season one was also working on season 2 even with the studio change
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>

I liked the premise for death. The more you die. The more you forget

Lasted too long
Doesn't help like half of it was dealing with the kids

I only ever look at the jap option if there's no dub or it's a bad dub
I don't pay attention to the stuff
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
The last few RPGs I played dubbed and loved them. Persona 5, Nier automata, fire emblem 3H and DQ11
Then yes I agree with u
If u only mean this anime
Depends. I think English voice acting can be just as good or better depending on what it's covering
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
I don't like spoilers
No
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
<@152896851660505088>i haven't seen the trailer
I just want to see Escanor body more demons. I would watch that all day
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Man it really is the meliodas and Escanor show
And merlin doesn't really do anything outside of being op in one fight. Never really gets any meaningful dialog
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
gowther made the worst part of S2. For that I will never forgive him
WHY
Like why
Let's just delete Diane's memory and never return it even after the fact
Yes
Also I hateeeee glasses guy now. (name escapes me)
She's cool. But she totally should've died
Her clan leader also being Alive is a bunch of BS lol
It's retarded that's for sure
Power levels increasing to the point that only ~~goku~~ meliodas and escanor can do anything
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Turning big buff dude into a baby
All the downs were basically the rest of the cast. Diane and king. Please kill me
I mean. To be fair. S2 was pretty meh to begin with. Outside of the Sun god.
Thanks Melua. I'm not actually crazy
Well that's explains why I mix them up lol
I keep mixing up Nobunagun with nobunaga the fool. They came out around the same time right?
<@99695384296701952>its always crazy when you realize how much older an anime is. Feels like just yesterday for some
The only nobunaga I liked in recent memory that I tried was Nobuna Oda
Didn't we have one last season?
I was totally waiting for solopy to chime in too haha
<:smuglucy:449882231817764864>
Shh nobunaga isn't underrated. It's just ignored cause it's another nobunaga
The ones within.   <@99695384296701952> this season
And no one within on the list. Rip being the underrated show of the season
I'm trying to remember a specific actor who is typecasted as a good guy who is actually a bad guy reveal later in the movie
<:worrylove:608960688596975616>
God I love Tim curry
Also packing peanuts were created by Satan
True.  But it was just over the top. Let me take a pic of the massive boxes and then the items inside
<a:kyoukoangry_a:417552013556056064>
I got my anime figures early today. No wonder it cost so much shipping. She had no clue what she was doing and used hella big boxes with too much packing peanuts
I would've paid so much more attention in school if they just had lessons like dumbell anime
Everything I knew was a lie
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
But that doesn't show up on a black light does it?
It was owned by a female
<:pepederp:545099288598806568>
I never even got a notification that it was ending soon
<@189146272865845248>i made the minimum bid and forgot about it a week ago. Got a random email saying u won! Cause nobody bid on it for the whole week.
Accidently won it on eBay.
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>

So no shocker thrre
Lots of animes stretch near the middle
<@456226577798135808> it's not true.
Web Novel
<@202444817043685386> ive been informed from WN and LN readers that every version of hero is quite different from each other
<:smuglucy:449882231817764864>
<@139432096023183360>yea the good fate. Not that other fate
<:karinsip:586819457217724428>
I'm all for protecting the waifus but damn
<@152896851660505088>
Two massive boxes for 4 items

<:SerenaSip:602316639593299999>
Just checking the outfits
Aren't I there to just look at pics? U aren't reading it
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
<@256945399338631168> pls do
<@90164247643828224> that makes me sad. I still love the show tho
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
WN leans too much towards edge and anime is too much towards goodness
<:madobomb:586822460029141002>
The manga seems like a good balance of edge and goodness
And the LN is in-between the manga and the WN
<@185949743321579520> I mean it sounds like each version is more santizied than the last. I've heard the original WN is very messed up
Also wish the main char was more into killing bitchie like the manga.
<@185949743321579520> I was also sad at that. I prefer the manga but my bro will never read manga so this so the only way he will see It lol
Oh so the two seasons then was real? Neat. I'll be watching it with me bro. He super enjoyed it while I passively watched it and enjoyed some parts here and there
<@377429672264335363> you could always try star vs the forces of evil or gravity falls if she liked Steven universe
I honestly forget about that Chris/fine part. Outside of that the show is wholesome enough
We already got one anime dedicated to that thanks
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
Talking about heroes and it's not MHA
<a:nagisafreakout_a:589157596703752205>
How did it get two more seasons? Where's my two more seasons of Reincarnated as a slime
<:felishock:586823465323986956>
Symphogear is an anime!
~~I know it's zesshou~~
I like that honestly. Really explains how the first two Swan songs are different vs Chris near the end
The boob thing just sounds like a joke to me
Reminds me of the currently running Yu-no. I blame the director 100% for this garbage fest
Why do directors have to ruin things and not just faithfully adapt. This isn't your creations
Reminds me of... Baka to twst? Main char
This protag looks generic af
Anything recent..that sounds familliar
Damn Japan and their love of books
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<@388516680742993933> why do good animes get no second season usually and bad ones do
No u
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
I think the last one was made entirely by sega
Lol so looking at their games. They also made 7th dragon up until someone else did the 3ds one. Funny I said Stella glow looked like that xD
Yea I definitely liked LA2 the most
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
It's been a long ass time
Derp
Oh was it?
The normal route and then that helping the bad girl route
I really liked in the first one I had two story lines depending on how you answered story dualog
<@297542051057238017> I wanna play the old two again for the story.
(honestly fire emblem 3 houses maps would take so long near the end)
Outside of fire emblem I don't know why I have such a hard time finishing tactical games
I should do that first
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
Tho I never finished either..
i liked both of them
Rip imageepoch
I still hate how we never got LA3
Ohh
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
<@297542051057238017> this looks a lot like luminous arc
Or started
I guess it just came out at a bad time for me. Looked a lot like 7th dragon or Lord of magna. I should really get back into my 3ds games I never finished
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Now u guys make me regret skipping it cause it looked generic
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
When people try to make children okay to lewd by strapping a silly age on them
Today has been very eye opening for me. Thank you for allowing me to rant
But yes if the head is trash. Theres only so much the body can do
I believe that 100% now
The same director did all the animes I liked from that company lol
Oh I see
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
I wonder how a director gets chosen for an anime
That Explains how a company can make great things like hinatsuri and outbreak company and utter rubbish like yu-no and mayo chiki
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
Are animes really make or break by their director?  <@388516680742993933>
I don't even understand
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
How do u make one of my favorite animes of last year bar none. And then compile this garbage
What the actual fuck
THEY MADE HINAMATSURI
I'm so mad cause the company isnt even that bad. They've had some decent things
Tetsu hirakawa. You are an awful director and I hope you never get to be in charge of another anime again.
I wouldn't want to subject friends to this drivel
It's so boring u can't even do that for the first half
Whats a yellin anime?
How do we still get garbage animes like this in the year 2019.
I hate this show
WHICH WOULDNT HAVE HAPPENED IF HE USED HIS TIME TRAVEL MACHINE AT THE START OF AN ALTERCATION INSTEAD OF IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AGGHHHH
<a:nagisafreakout_a:589157596703752205>
16 episodes it's like steins gate. With dealing with alternate time line shit. Last 8 episodes it becomes an Isekai that he lives in for 5 YEARS has a child with a woman. Even tho he's supposed to be there trying to find a way to keep his friend from dying.
Did I mention time travel/other time lines are a thing here?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
All this time bullshit
I'm pretty sure the main chars daughter becomes his mom. And he's gonna have sex with this new woman and make his friend from highschool.
It is really bad. I'm close to rating this show a 1/10 and I've never done that before for an anime. Usually it has some redeeming factor but this second cour . Oh man it's just stupider and stupider
I guess anything not human is considered a thing
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I don't know how this world is a-ok with eating dragons when they basically grow up into people when they mature
But that earthquake never happened in the anims
Like the reason she flies nonstop instead of just landing for them to get supplies in the place they're at is cause in the original a terrible earthquake causes the place do be basically destroyed and those three are the only survivors.
There's been many skipped or errored things over the course of the show
I think he's just really horrible at adapting the actual situation that happened in the original story
So much
I hate this show
It doesn't help the first time the main char and his daughter traveled thru the desert on like a camel horse thing. It eventually collapsed from exhaustion and they ate it too.  <@388516680742993933>
<a:nagisafreakout_a:589157596703752205>
I swear to God if next episode they actually go thru with it
We don't know yet. He's about to kill her before the episode ended
Yes
Everyone who is watching this show is incredibly upset
RIGHT?
And then the episode ends.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
The main char raises a baby dragon earlier in the show . Later He gets knocked off a tower with this other person and the baby dragon who grew up saves him. But she's now in the shape of a human female with wings and blue scaley body. Really cute. The main char makes a joke about how big her breasts are. They fly over the desert until she crashes into the ground from exhaustion not even one minute later and apparently they're so far from their destination that they have to kill and EAT her cause dragon meat is something they eat in this world.
Can I tell u the most egregious part?
Ikr?
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
<@388516680742993933> it's nice to share our disappointment with each other about things we wish were better
Yu-no has this awful tonal whiplash in it and I hate it. It goes from stupid comedy to dark and serious in a second and it never works
That stupid
It's such a fucking disappointment
All it does it make me want to play the game
<@237964037898502144>
<@83626774000308224>
They could've just landed and went with the resistance. But noooo
So she died for nothing
Also the people of the resistance got to the capital at basically the same time the main chars did
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<@388516680742993933> they ate her. I'm fucking done
Like it doesn't insult your intelligence. I was shocksd
I respect it
Kenja no mago was actually pretty decent even tho it should've been generic drivel
Reincarnated as a slime was a good one.
Yea for every 9 bad ones. There's usually 1 good one
<:worrylove:608960688596975616>
especially with the perfect dub
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
discluding the final arc. i think it might be one of the best animes ever created
always happy to see peridot lapis and bismuth
B squad gems get to do stuff so thats cool
i liked them. theres even a meta joke about the songs in there that i enjoyed
<@185949743321579520> i would say yes, its like 50%+ musical tho. if that bothers you dont. but i loved the villian in it.
Did anyone see the Steven universe movie? I know it's not anime but I figured this was the best place for it
Can I just watch yu yu hakusho instead?  <@189146272865845248> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:worrylove:608960688596975616>
<@189146272865845248> I'd watch anime with you
I only watch anime cause it's the only way to enjoy the stories with other people at the same time
U mean too much?
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
Too less?
I would honestly prefer them on a portable device instead
*shrugs* I think the switch is perfect for VNs just like the Vita and psp were
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
To help read
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
It's like a phone
<@237964037898502144>if you have a Nintendo switch you could get it on there
As far as I know. Yu-no only has its visual novels and the anime
<@237964037898502144> yes. Cause I dislike reading manga on PC. I don't mind it that much on phone tho
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
But u read them
Just wait for the visual novel that comes out in a week or two
It's a god damn Trainwreck of a show
That's the normal anime
I hear
The hentai Is old and terrible
YU-NO: A Girl Who Chants Love at the Bound of this World
It's original a VN
The name is long but it's shortened to Yu-No
I swear I can feel the legit anger
His voice actor is great for angry yelling. I loved him in Haikyuu
Naofumi sama
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
<@256945399338631168>such heresy
<a:nagisafreakout_a:589157596703752205>
Gotta go fast
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Can I quit my job instead?
<:SerenaSip:602316639593299999>
Hey my manga was more animated than that season
<:madobomb:586822460029141002>
I'm glad I already read the manga so season 2 didn't disappoint me
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
It would be strenuous for me but I'm also out of shape
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
I wonder if all people in the OPM have the potential to be a OPM if they follow his regiment
<@202536957685923841> can I complain about season 2 without ever watching it cause I know beforehand it's bad?
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
So since OPM stopped working out will his strength eventually atrophy?
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>

<@202536957685923841> since u mentioned art
Akame ga kill was another one. Thankfully the manga ended better
<@155150213445582850>
As long as you still enjoy it. The anime I usually refrence for this situation is erased. Super great until like the last two episodes, then it goes full stupid and it's like why
I haven't watched spyce. I was just thinking of good animes with bad endings
I feel like some endings are so bad that even the amazing ride there can make it unwatchable on a rerun
Do bad endings sometimes ruin an entire show for you?
<:smuglucy:449882231817764864>
<@231025503643893770> so all the time
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
Pop team epic?
It's like that pop go anime thing that was all refrences. The show was either fantastic or a major miss lol
THATS HOW U GET VIRUSES DATOO
you could always just youtube the song
I see. I'll give it another shot
I tried getting into Mob 100 but after two eps I was like eh?. I'll try it more later but I didn't understand the hype honestly
<@202536957685923841>
My hero S3
Steins gate zero
Food wars
DxD hero
Hinamatsuri
Megalo box
Golden kamuy
Legend of galactic heroes
Happy sugar life
Planet with
Bunny girl senpai
Zombieland saga
SSSS gridman
Violet evergarden
Seven deadly sins S2
Killing Bites
Yowamushi pedal glory line
Hang on let me get my list
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
Last year was an amazing year of anime
People just right it off cause the main char is half naked
It's got a low rating but it's easily one of my favorite animes of last year
Was expecting erotic garbage but got an actually good fighting anime
Bro the Gore and action in the show was way better than it needed to be
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
She's been genetically altered so it's allowed
She's a fighter lol
<:pepethumb:524775085794394122>
<@102691114762371072> this is one of them
<@102691114762371072> becuase Japan likes their youth
<:SerenaSip:602316639593299999>
Highschoolers*
You get two big tiddie women at one point erotically doing stuff to each other
<@102691114762371072> go watch killing bites
I noped out of that anime so hard. The title alone makes me cringe
I remember watching killing bites last year and it had a full on lesbian softcore scene. Didn't expect it but was highly appreciated
Lol
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
*adds to love ru to watch list*
I never saw that. I just saw lots of gifs and thought. Man this anime gets right up to the edge of anime vs hentai
<@202536957685923841> I'm happier if the main chsr finally picks someone in a harem anime. I hate the non pick endings. Like toheart2 or infinite stratos
There were a loooooot of stupid deaths in the anime
Dororo is the only thing in recent anime that I can say did better than it's manga counterpart
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
The sad thing is the creator helped make that dumpster fire ending
It avoids some of the issues the anime had. Not all but a decent amount
<@87512939107450880> it is. The manga is much better than the anime especially when the anime goes off to do its own thing lol

<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Their plastic feels so cheap
I really hate how kotobukiya has all the cool non Gundam stiff
I honestly wish companies would just give bandai their mech license to make stuff
They probably make more money just selling the license to other companies to make stuff instead
<@468591607332208641> theyve actually gotten quite a bit better with their human gunpla kits recently
Love live helps keep bandai Alive so they can keep producing gunpla
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
<:redheh:320765711393751041>
<@98541382393688064>
How did he react?
No clue. I don't read comics. I just like watching people get outraged over silly things like this.
Japanese manga crushing the America comic book sales lol

<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I scared everyone off
(tho my rating scale tends to be more on the can I recommend this show to others scale)
I'd honestly only rate it like a 4/10 but I'm really happy I experienced it
If it can make you angry or happy or sad. It's doing something right
The worst thing entertainment can commit is being boring imo
But I think a show is good if they can bring out an emotion like that
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I almost couldnt finish the show
I died on that day too
For real
Outside of one person they all kinds deserve it too
<:smuglucy:449882231817764864>
Or extorting something
Like overall the anime wasn't that well animated but when they wanted to do something important I feel like they went all out
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Happy sugar life spoilers ||The murder near the end that has no music playing. But just the noises of flailing and panting of desperation.|| Just hits you so hard
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Deserved better
Rip my fav char
They also did some really cool thing with animation not gonna lie. They had an almost 100% POV episode of a guy who was killed and how he died
How much worse can they make this. It was like watching an amazing dumpster fire
I think happy sugar life was a great anime. It made me feel awful all the time cause everyone in it was a piece of shit. But I kept watching cause every episode pushed the line more and more
<@279341087494242304> if I had to pick the best animes from the list to recommended it would be Zombieland saga and hinamatsuri for comedy. Bunny girl senpai for drama and planet with for mecha
if you disclude the 100+ filler sure
its also nice having a shounen that doesnt really drag its feet. i feel like a ton has happened in the span of the show vs say a single arc of naruto or bleach
its got high production values. and is more enjoyable than say Onepiece or boruto
i just see an enjoyable shounen show that didnt end after 12 episodes
i mean its definitely an above average show but theres always other stuff to watch too
<:madobomb:586822460029141002>
You mean MHA
I legit don't even see the ecchiness there. Also we should avoid this discussion herr
Yes
Chris is honestly really tame
I really only thing kiri can be deemed ober the top. Maybe Maria's too
Like I forgot the Symphogear Chris naked abuse scene
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
It also depends on what they're trying to get out of an anime. Like if they want pure comedy or just constant action. Or their tolerance level to ecchi cause there's some good animes that you overlook their ecchi lvls and realize to New comers they might be put off by that
Castle in the sky is non stop fun imo too
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
I haven't found many that didn't like princess mononoke
Miyazaki movies are always a safe bet for the uninitiated
I don't feel bad spoiling the dumpster fire anime that nobody should watch but alright I'll move channels
<a:nagisafreakout_a:589157596703752205>
It really was. Cause at first the show had meaning behind each death at first
Yes
The red head who could disguise herself as anyone else
Eh. I think cosmetic girl is the dumbest death. I feel like hers could've been avoided the easiest
Ouch that hurts
I unfriend u
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Woah woah woah. Let's not be crazy and put OPM and mha on black clovers level
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Black clover
Too
Yea the ones that stand out tend to have that issue
<@279341087494242304> I think that was my issue as well
I don't think the show is bad by any means. It's just not what I look for in animes
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
It was the only noteworthy thing I can remember of nise. And the sister cutting her beautiful hair
<@152896851660505088> its not. I enjoyed bake well enough but I just got tired of it
I can't remember anything about nise outside of the infamous teeth brushing scene
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I mean Symphogear has fun and good action. Yes half of it is boring talking but nise was just like all boring talking
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I think at one point I could feel my brain cells dying from watching the show and I questioned why I was even bothering with this show <@217896572954869761>
<@83626774000308224> I enjoyed s1 enough for AoT at the time but all the plot after that got so stupid. I don't undstand how people were happy with S2 or S3
<:TB:441562395245281281>
I dropped it like a rock at sistermonogatari
God that gatari series
its funny u say that cause i was just thinking how fast yu yu can be
yu yu hakusho is amazing
also you CAN make good filler.bleach had a couple good filler arcs that were as good or even better than some of the other actual arcs
a show is always determined by its entirety. i tell people. if you have to skip parts of a show to enjoy the good parts. then its not a good show
but they exist
I'm just happy they're doing something else. It's such a waste that only fate gets this companies art and experience
I know
I'm happy ufotable is not doing fate atm
Well I liked demon Slayer from episode 1 so I dunno what to tell u
Demon Slayer has been great.
Wow electric. Did u even try ?
For real?
Wait what
I mean meliodas is unaging. And short af. And excanor is pure muscle with a stache
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
<@217896572954869761> what's creepy about them?
Oh food wars  finally confirmed next season?
<:madobomb:586822460029141002>
Season 2 was noticeably weaker than season 1 imo. But Escanor was better than like anything season 1 had
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<@152896851660505088> why do u have to remind me
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Bro there are tons of things worse than mha airing right now
It seems so... By the numbers
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
Didn't shueisha make BC to specifically replace Naruto. But then Naruto pulled a boruto
As someone who sat down and watched 8 episodes of FT. It's agonizingly slow, Like BC is. MHA actually does things and moves forward
I think all those chars look great
I'm just more confused than anything.
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
<@217896572954869761> also I can't tell. Did u like promised Neverland designs or no
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
<@152896851660505088> Gundam openings? Wut?
<@279341087494242304> tsukasa is irrelevant honestly. It's more about senku and his building
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
<@217896572954869761> for real tho. Who has a bad design in demon Slayer? I think everyone looks great
And wasn't from the eyes of his friend
I think Dr stone looks fine. I've been enjoying that this season too. It was a slow burn but when senku broke off to be the main char it got much more enjoyable
Fix what designs?
I can definitely say DS would've probably been Garbo if it was anyone but ufotable doing it
<:pepethumb:524775085794394122>
Gotcha
Oh u were saying it wouldn't have been good if people who didn't really care about it had their hands on it
Thats good tho right?
I see
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
<@152896851660505088> how would that show? As someone who hasn't watched anything hxh
Tho if demon Slayer gets a second season and stays as good as season 1. I might have a contender to take that spot
Yu yu hakusho is my gold standard for shounen for me
It's pacing was a bit funny at times but still enjoyable
Also I enjoyed the original Persona 4 anime adapation
But good.
Not amazing
I think devil survivor 2 was a good anime adaption of a game
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I try not to electric
<:madobomb:586822460029141002>
If by poor man's dark souls u mean an infinitely better series. Then yes
<:TB:441562395245281281>
<@152896851660505088> tell that to all the western triple A studios
I've always been afraid to try gintana cause I feel i would be so lost with it's comedy
Oh apparently Deen did Rave master. That's my favorite thing they made
Looking at their made animes. I liked is this a zombie ? And  dragon crisis is a guilty pleasure of mine
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
OKAY
<@279341087494242304> lol u took way longer than I expected to mention that. I was debating saying something about it earlier xD
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I forgot Deen is doing the Orphen remake thing
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
When will other companies be able to make things as pretty as violet evergarden
Wise*
Art wisd
Mmmm. I feel like I would take samurai girls over this sankarea
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
Deen made highschool dxd?
<:TB:441562395245281281>
<@83626774000308224> QUICK JUMP WITH THE HAND U HOLD CHOPSTICKS WITH
I never saw the older versions
I liked those animes. That's how I saw them
<@152896851660505088> is kyoani the bottom one?
My bad
Oh I see
Lol calling demon Slayer the 2006.
There's nothing wrong with tanjiros outfit lol
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Also electric hates earlier Japanese clothing in a Japanese era anime
DEEEEN
Forhead*
I didn't realize having a large forward made u balding
Rip electric
That's a shame for people who liked it
Very funny tho
Well this week was a pretty chill episode.
I noticed fire force hasne been in the top 10 in awhile. Did it turn into generic stuff?
<@185949743321579520> gotta shine light on new stuff. Cause we all know demon Slayer would be number one every week
<:TB:441562395245281281>
Tejina senpai in the top 10. Yea boi!
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
<@279341087494242304> that's some nice nothing you got there
<@188714906143424513> but I'm stoopid
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I wish I was
<@188714906143424513> let me know how it is. I've only ever played the ps2/Wii game one
I'm low-key hoping it gets a second season cause it's fighting was actually well above average
<:TB:441562395245281281>
<@152896851660505088> if you want to watch trash. Watch killing bites. It's great popcorn fodder
Dense*
Nah ichika is the densest main char in the history of sense harem protags
Let me in
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
Oh we hating on infinite fanservice?
<:TB:441562395245281281>
Machio losing his muscle density when he puts on his sweats is one of the funniest things to me
Just needs the food
Dess
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I need my delicious food, bouncing breasts and extreme muscle bod men
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
But if the ecchi food is bad. What's the point
What
<:TB:441562395245281281>
I only read up to Central. So I only know good then
<:pepethumb:524775085794394122>
I usually do
I'm still enjoying food wars. I look forward to this new plate
<@279341087494242304> boruto. Naruto really didn't end lol
I seriously can't imagine what the world will be like without one piece
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
Maybe when one of these shounens actually end we will know if they have a good ending
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Bad*
Yu yu hakusho was so close but that Kings arc was so bac
My bad
Oh it wasn't?
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Fairy tail
I feel like black clover and FT had tons of building in the beginning. But they lasted
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
It's a shounen jump title?
Indeed. You would think the fast paced nature of the show would keep people going
Well they're getting It all now lol
But Melua watches everything
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
<@217896572954869761> you obviously have different taste than I do after we discussed a few animes lol
<@99695384296701952> <@152896851660505088> . I feel like you two probably tried it.
I keep forgetting to watch Carol and Tuesday. Anyone able to give me their opinion on the show?
<:smuglucy:449882231817764864>
Yea. If they wanted to showcase quality. Black clover wouldn't be at the top
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Still no the ones within.
Oh I see
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
I see it at number 5?
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
When's the Giant robot phase coming back
Yes honestly I feel like they're much less prevalent now compared to mid/early 2000s
<:pepethumb:524775085794394122>
I look for laugh out funny things like hinamatsuri or hitoribocchi. Or interesting story/plot things like Astra lost in space. Or great action show like Demon slayer
<:pepethumb:524775085794394122>
Of course. If that's what you want go for it.
<@388516680742993933> because what I want out of anime is different than what I want out of h manga
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
I have H manga for stuff like that
Yea I'm good on that borderline hentai
<a:nagisafreakout_a:589157596703752205>
It deserves none. If a shows only positive is it's ecchiness it's a show that goes into the dumpster
Then let the industry die
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
U gave me the same option twice
I can get it all done in 6-8 hours
Well it's 20 mins an episode. And if I grab everything i usually have 20-25 shows. Since I skip anything very obviously trash to me like harem/ecchi.
I usually drop the half that have no potential to me
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
I mean it's a single Sunday night to test out all the animes
If I didn't I'd have missed out on the ones within or killing bites. Or my happy sugar life
<@388516680742993933> I try the first episode of everything each season to judge it myself
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
We have 4 isekai this season
Also milfsekai is pretty boring
Season
All three of these are this current sesson
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
<@388516680742993933>
Also I'll take shield hero any day over cheat magician, that edgy Isekai with the Tokyo ghoul main char, or that one that has blonde rem in it
<a:nagisafreakout_a:589157596703752205>
<:pepethumb:524775085794394122>
They are
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
You like emergency medical technicians?
Dat makes my day

Wait slime is getting another season? I never heard
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
Bro where's my two next seasons of slime
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I was more bored during the alo arc of SAO
My bro was happy. I'm eh on the whole thing.
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Two more seasons baby!
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
Also him being voiced by the king of volleyball/shield hero is perfect
Or basically teleportation
00 has quantum shifting
Unless it's gundam
<@195919956918009856> usually when a mechs has some ability that supercedes normal technology standard. It tends to be a super robot.
But aquarion
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
Wait logos isn't connected?
I never watched logos
Oh I see
So a three season cross over?
Oh it happened in logos?
NO
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I also watched aquarion OG dubbed so going from that to subbed evol was such a weird shift for me
But main char. Purple haired girl and everyone else was mehhhh
She was decent too
With the frog
Oh the pink girl
Who?
<:worrylove:608960688596975616>
OG aqarion crew was quite diverse and all got their own time to shine
I was really disappointed from the crew of the evil anime. I really only liked green haired girl.
I've got the DVDs of season 1
<a:nagisafreakout_a:589157596703752205>
AQUARIOOOOON
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I just love my robots
What part of cross Ange finally made u drop it?
I loved cross ange. It was such a wild ride
<@99695384296701952> u are making me want to double check both seasons cause I don't remember the difference in quality
So funny
I still remember the plop noise in that first episode of gravion where he just throws his breasts after he's done with his disguise
What's off limits to u?
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I wish shows like godannar and gravion would get hd remasters
The dub so hilarious too
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
It's giant robots and tiddies everywhere
Also usually cause the other route is full of supppper old Super robots I never watched cause I didn't exist in the 70s-80s
<a:ElfneinDoIt:493803070409670657>
*picks the Gundam routes cause I love Gundam*
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
~~i totally wasn't watching are z gravion attacks just now~~
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
<@99695384296701952> do u remember gravion and godannar?
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
A lot of super robots tend to have the trope attack of launching their fist at an enemy
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
Did u look at it?
Oh I see
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
How do u know what Melua is listening to
My brain failed
G Gundam*
Er
Like a magic core or some super alien tech
Just with something extra
We are a plague to the earth
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
Thanatos getting rid of half of humans I can agree with
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
When did something being too spicy started being a thing? I feel like I've heard that a lot this year
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Rape is something that will always bother me in anime/VNs etc
Yea I never liked it either
Oh my bad
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
<@279341087494242304> if you've watched or read berserk. U would understand the meaning behind Griffith did nothing wrong
I like a little crazy but not that crazy
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
A guy was telling the story goes he met a girl at a convention and they talked about animes which berserk Is his favorite and the woman said Griffith did nothing wrong an he Noped out of that
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Griffith did nothing wrong
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
Because all of fate needs to go away
Understandable
Nana mizuki singing will get me to watch any show honestly
Gotcha
<@99695384296701952> are the openings a good indicator or is the opening of s1 much better than the show quality
<@195919956918009856> did we just become best friends?
I mean most animes don't so that's fine
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Shh
<:pepethumb:524775085794394122>
If you want comedy Mecha I recommend Nadesico. It makes fun of a lot of mechs tropes as well as actually telling a good story in the back half
<@99695384296701952>
I remember dai guard. I just googled it. It was durin that toonami Mecha week
<@279341087494242304> WIND!
<:pepethumb:524775085794394122>
Okey
<@99695384296701952> what would captain earth be classified as. He's massive as all hell but doesn't really have anything but size cause of how slow he is
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
But u have the same mentality I do when it comes to entertainment so that makes me happy
Fair lol
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
ARE YOU ME?
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
<@195919956918009856> THATS WHAT I SAY
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Unless it's a buggy broken mess of slag
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I still am. I just know something I don't like doesn't mean it's bad. Just it ain't for md
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'll always hate anything made by EA
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
~~i only like the 2d Zelda and Pokemon games~~
Nothing wrong with liking captain marvel.  It's just... Another marvel movie you know?
At least China eats up all the marvel movies. Even the average ones like captain marvel
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
I mean the marvel movies are pretty lacking in general. They're going into a downward spiral soon
U mean using him too much?
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
Sp
Also I was a dumb kid and thought I was such a smarty for figuring out how good so regen was
Yea I do remember that lol
I honestly prefer the og1/2 over the PS3 ones
Gotcha
The GBA one or the PS3 one?
A3 and Z1 are easily pinnacle srw
<:worrylove:608960688596975616>
I still have it on my shelf
Alpha 3 was my first imported gamd
<a:partydoot:487633363302350869>
Gong man... So fucking good
Damn this song is a banger melua
I had to finish Nadesico first
God the GBA srw games were such gems
Barty needs to hear
Yes good idea Melua!
Man this is making me want to pop in my Blu ray
<:pepethumb:524775085794394122>
Also u get cut ins for both Yurika and Ruri usually
The episode that has GEKIGANGER watching Nadesico and getting ideas for new attacks from it was so unreal
<a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746>
GEKIGANGER PUNCH
I WANNA BE A COOK DAMMIT
Just rocks it
<:pepethumb:524775085794394122>
<@195919956918009856> I also love the main char gets a pink Mecha. And he don't care
She was so cute
The movie ruins the design of ruri.
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
There is no movie
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
<:pepethumb:524775085794394122>
and be able to punch concrete
you gotta get ripped to cosplay gen
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Man. How was ouka not a secret gettable character
Yes I do remember that
Sorry for being dumb
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Was that added to the PS3 version? Cause I don't remember that in the GBA version. I do remember the moon cradle option
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
I really don't understand adaptions that alter the story or disclude characters. It's like why do u assume this is gonna fail so you'd never want a second season if it sells well?
Rip
Bad*
They also changed studios cause that anime only ending was so baf
Highschool DxD had an anime only ending to season 3. And reteconned it for season 4
<@87512939107450880> just retcon it
<:pepeglock:552540084616822801>
<@87512939107450880> when that season 2 of oda nobuna
That's a good thing. You want to better than your last work. Not worse xD
So at least that makes sense
<@152896851660505088> yea but FT and rave master share the same world
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
<@104194257908154368> I think that makes it worse cause that's just laziness to reuse happy
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
First plu. Now happy
Same world I bet
Rave was very different imo
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Totally not Lucy
I mean the char designs
<:TB:441562395245281281>
Looks just like fairy tail tho
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
I never got my ending
Cool. Can they readapt rave master now?
I only remember the haruhi ending
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
I'm not an idol guy
I don't know any lovelive. I barely know the names of the OG cast lol
<@152896851660505088> I believe nozomi was one of the ones posted
So I believe an idolmastsr can't sing
Compared to like maki who's gotten many lessons
I remember someone posting some of the solo songs from love live and they weren't especially good.
I skipped toradora
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
I've never heard that
She sings?
Her voice is nails on a chalkboard for me now
Kugimiya rie. *Shudders*
What
6 movies
Damn wishy washy harem boys
<:pepeglock:552540084616822801>
They'd always save that for the climax episode or never at all
I enjoyed the fact they actually got together early on. As someone who doesn't watch a lot of romance nowadays and remember all the Sol from my younger days. That NEVER happened
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
It was dumb
Eh it's a one episode thing which is easily the weakest part of the show. But overall I think it's great
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
But they need some sort of drama
Yes if my sol has drama like say Golden time. Or anohana. Then I can watch them
But as an adult my tastes have evolved and I can't get into a lot of slice of life shows I enjoyed when I was younger
That was me in highschool.
Gotchaaaa
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
<@152896851660505088> I have no idea what those first two things u said were
Not saying there's something wrong with shows like lucky star. They're just not what I look for in my entertainment
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I have a hard time watching chill shows that don't really have a plot to them. Cause at some point my brain will start being like WILL SOMETHING INTERESTING PLEASE HAPPEN
Ah yes that opening  Probably the most I like the show lol
I'd have to go listen to it. I don't remember it
It never got better for me
I wasnt a fan personally. I was in the drop side. But my friend wanted to watch more so I agonizingly had to watch it
<@87512939107450880> lucky star was easily one of those the first episode is gonna make u watch the whole thing or drop it. There was no in-between I feel like xD
Such a trippy beginning to the show
That episode was fucking hilarious tho
Oh god I forgot that song
So cute
Grats datto
As long as you enjoy it. Have fun
<@231025503643893770> I guess not.
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
Cast has strange taste if those two are his contenders for AoTS.
DS spoilers don't click unless u saw last episode
<@90164247643828224> ||which is crazy cause the first half was brutal AS FUCK||
<a:catsquee:618536628838989824>
||Also that last interaction with kanao and tanjiro. Holy shit. Cutest thing||
<:smuglucy:449882231817764864>
When he picked up the rock I was like. OH NO
<:pepelove:552925136349560856>
<@90164247643828224> I understand that refrence
<:EveNom:492393235801571328>
large bosoms do make people feel safe
Yes
Shouldn't*

Oh wait yuuji also didn't agr

Yuuji should've picked the girl who will age normally and not the one who will sound like Rie kugimiya her entire life
<:pepethumb:524775085794394122>
<@87512939107450880> I know its tail I just don't care enough to correct myself.
I guess I just never see any fans of it offline or online. I see plenty of Naruto/boruto fans, BC, Fairy tale, DBS etc. But I honestly I haven't met a one piece watcher in a long while
It's a juggernaut I realize. If it wasn't it would've ended long ago
Yes lol
I'm curious if one piece would actually be on the list every week if it counted
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
Discluding big shounen what animes get more than two cours at a time?
Yep
Well I mean obviously don't have things like that but the 24 episode shows should be fine lol
I'm saying
It's just silly to me to disclude a second cour is all.
So was MHA. But you know they'll be on the list next season lol
It's silly tho cause nishikata is there even those his is a second season which is basically a second cour. But what do I know
Cause if they did count them. I'm sure 2-3 of the demon boys would be in this list easy lol
If it's like the weekly episode rating. They skip 2nd cour stuff. Like you won't see senku on the next season of top 10 male chars cause he's apart of this one.
Iride being on the list is quite surprising cause nobody watched the ones within I feel like
<@115744398997716995> for this season only. Demon Slayer started last season
<:TB:441562395245281281>
or comrades
isnt nakama friends?
all according to cake. ~~cake means keikaku~~   ~~keikaku Means Plan~~
i enjoyed the parody of it in DBZ abridged
it really was
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
keikaku means plan
it bugs me when i have a sub group that just leaves things like Onii-chan as that and doesnt turn it into brother or big bro etc.
to replace that
i forgot the verbal tick they gave her in the dub
could u imagine if they stuck around for half the season?
tho i did enjoy the second option over shana personally. her name escapes me lol
i feel like a lot of animes had that back in the day
yea the good old multi love thing that existetd back in the early 2000s
very true. watching a show week to week really makes you more critical cause its like. do i want to watch this again next week? xD
interesting. did you enjoy it? i know u watched all of it. but was it worth it?
<@185949743321579520> what made you finally get around to watching the show?
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
too many animes i watched are getting another season next season
god i couldnt wait for them to die
true
well*
yea its just one of those. wll that happened scenes xD
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
yea its like when i try to get people to watch symphogear and forget about the chris electricity scene in season 1
cause the show never gets like that again. its such an awkward stand out
i do remember a couple of my friends liking the anime until bro and sis make out scenes in season one and they noped pretty hard out of it lol
i dont know if i could watch shana again honestly
lol nice
i mean two immortals being together makes more sense than say a normal human lol
gotcha
||did they alter it to make shana happy she saw someone she THOUGHT was yuuji? cause that was such an asspull||
maybe i did
never saw the OVAs
<@87512939107450880>
god the more we talk the more i realize i dont remember. was ||the season two ending, yuuji dipping on both girls instead of showing up for one of them? cause i remember likee a fake out or maybe the ending was retconned where it looks like he shows up for shana||
gotcha
is the fumina konoe School version filler or is her true self also not real?
different english dub*
SNS i think got a different dub in the final season and i had a hard time adjusting to the japanese after watching all the first two seasons dubbed
never went back to finish it
gonna be honest. i never finished final. i think i got 6 or so episodes in and got distracted by new shiny anime or a new video game lol
SNS is such a unique anime situation. 3 seasons of two cours. thats pretty unheard of even now with everything getting multiple seasons
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
There's a 4th season? I thought it was just SNS, SNS second, and SNS Final
Me*
It's been a long time since I've seen sns. Remind mr
Snake?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i guess it would depend on the world.
but no way to ever communicate
it's like moving to another country
i guess my mindset is different. i love my family and friends but you live life for you, you know?
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
thats why i question a majority of the isekais existed before the term isekai was widely used by the masses
~~why do protags almost always want to go back to their own boring world instead of the cool world theyre now in~~
dang thats bad lol
sadly half the animes nowadays just pander archetypes and not actual people
<@185949743321579520> can you spoiler the ending? im curious how it finished
<@!476058996315389953> i mustve been unluck and only found the 90% xD
thank you
i noped at the end of season 2 when they had that epic moment to make characters grow but have a deus ex machina and everything went back to status quo
shoot me i watched two seasons of that
louise the zero?
<:RosaThink:594554700129370122>
enjoying a tsundere? thats possible?
grats ikxi
i dont know what i'm intersted in, in the new anime category. i'll find out after i try the first episode of everything
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Chihayafuru, food wars, 7DS, MHA, Kono Oto Tomare, Psychopass 3, bunnygirl senpai movie, and thats not even including the new stuff. <@486087033652248576>
so many good animes got another season
but this is the season of sequels
really? nothing? <@486087033652248576>
too many things to watch
i'm so not ready for this season of anime
King dragon sends his regards
me tooo
i love ProZDs video on a cool character thats better later in the story but sucks super hard in the beginning xD
like word play jokes
i hated the paragraph TLs to explain jokes that only make sense in japanese
<@231025503643893770> since u enjoy bad animes I recommend Yu-No. It's such a trash anime. I can't believe I wasted my life watching all the episodes of it
You're not wrong
if there was plot. i missed it
i mean i played the games and theres like no plot. just cute  girls shooting the bad cute girls
I haven't had a chance to watch it yet
How was the AL first episode?
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
~~inb4 the olympics is attacked by noise cause its a stadium~~
pfft
it still blows my mind that discotek is releasing blu rays of it here
oof
thats too bad
oh i see
so no finale live to mark the end of the series?
when did they announced the live wasnt it in? rip sales
Such a good isekai
Never sadly
I'll still watch an overlord 4 but 3 was a downgrade to one and two easily
Overlord 2 was its peak imo
Honestly with how season 3 of overlord went. U didn't miss much
I just need something that hooks me for an Isekai cause they're just so samey.
Before quartet
I saw 3 of them. Still haven't seen re zero
I do find it funny how Tanya needed the most exposition to explain their Isekai cause it's the least known of the 4
<@87512939107450880> just talking about Isekai quintet and it's possibilities in season 2 as well as season 1 stuff
I mean if someone who hasn't seen any of them watched it as it's supposed to be an advertisement. Konosuba seems to be the only one interesting of the bunch
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
God I hope malty isn't there
Unless Malty is there and brings it up.
True. She did affect ains. But I have a feeling it'll never be brought up.
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
<@284390402210136064> inb4 she fails cause she's useless
Wow it's getting a second season? It must've gotten really good after I dropped it or it's cheap enough to make that it did well still lol
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
So after learning the VN ends basically the same way as the anime. I literally don't see a point to Yu-No. Not gonna spoil anything but Jesus it feels so pointless
<:pepethumb:524775085794394122>
Aight. I'll just Google the definition
Can't they both be the best?
What's incel?
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<@284390402210136064> god. It's as bad as them not having naofumi want the death penalty for malty in the anime. Like really? This chick ruined your entire life.
<:sweat:550739406739472395>
I just wish the anime was more like the manga for shield hero. Raph murdering the fatass who abused slaves for fun was so good to read
I mean raph and ~~milim~~ filo. Are the main reasons I still watched it
Lol I will never unhear that from raphtalia
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
My brother likes it so I'm gonna be stuck watching it
<@87512939107450880> BUT AT LEAST WE GOT TWO MORE SEASONS OF SHIELD HERO! Shoot me in the face.
<:pepethumb:524775085794394122>
Usually my best friend or my bro
I like enjoying anime with people. So I avoid books lol
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
I'm not much of a book reader.
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Id watch a season2 of mondaiji but it's like NGNL. Good isekai but stuck in one season hell
<:pepeglock:552540084616822801>
That's not my favorite deliquent badass
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
<:pog:522650185390620693>
Maybe today will be my winning lottery ticket
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@83626774000308224> I'll take one off your hands if u need help
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
I used to pay 100 bucks for 1/4 figures
<:TB:441562395245281281>
I got out when the average 1/8 cost over a hundred bucks usually
~~i definitely slid down that slope~~
<:sweat:550739406739472395>
I got out of the figure market long ago, too rich for my blood
Either preorder or pay triple later
<:pog:522650185390620693>
Second hand market
Very true... True
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Or frostbite from ice
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
I just imagine stabbing the inside and bleeding internally
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
That's very pointy tho
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
<@284390402210136064> wut
I've seen it before
<:pepethumb:524775085794394122>
It's a scale
seeing everyone animated is so surreal lol
just watched the azur lane anime. of course they had to add in the san diego meme first episode

<:sweat:550739406739472395>
Just finished Oh maidens, man this anime was a wild ride of emotions. Highly recommend to everyone.
Such a sleeper hit
Just watched the first episode of season 2 of kono oto tomare. Man am I happy it's back. I missed this show a lot
Who knows when I'll see it now
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I missed the bunny girl senpai movie in theaters I'm so mad at myself
They were. But I do feel like cat girl was shafted in the anime first the other two
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
he's quite open minded
Yea and convincing izayoi who was initially in the camp of JUST LET ME SEE
<:TB:441562395245281281>
I love how she had an outfit that was enchanted to make u almost see a panty shot but never do
Kurousagi was such a cute girl
which im all for honestly
is it me or did imoutos die? we didnt have any last season and i havent really seen any this season that just started yet
~~i personally found the show boring and the tournament to be a slog but thats just me~~
oh mahouka is getting a season 2? i gotta tell my buddy, he's gonna love this news
im sure it did. after i dropped it
im sure it does. i just didnt like where the story was going. like yuuji is main bad guy now? what
i kinda dropped it after a few eps and never finishedi t
it really was
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
anything shounen?
<:sip:597321444761796609>
as a non index watcher im just enjoying the chat lost. dont fill me in i like watching this
Final didnt finish it?
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<:TB:441562395245281281>
i like finishing Over Time as well
<:sip:597321444761796609>
since i dont interact with the fans of shows i never know how well or bad something does in the west.
i forgot those even existed
maaan i remember loving newtype magazines when i was younger
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
i read NT as New Type. dang gundam acronyms
i was quite surprised Quintuplets is getting a second season so soon. hasnt even been a year i feel like
i have the memory of a goldfish so no promises
if i remember i will try to
spookys list is basically mine just swapping yotsuba and miku lol
while i love all 5, shes my fave followed by Miku, itsuki, youtsuba, ichika in last
nino best girl
only thing physical i collect is blu rays
noice cypher
i also think old dubs have more charm and personality usually compared to dubs nowadays
this was back in the day when i was a kid and didnt have access to subs. so i basically watched comcast on demand anime or toonami.
i wasnt super invested in it cause i originally saw the first two seasons in dub, and couldnt get into the sub or the new worse dub cast
retcon means something changed after the fact to make something work or to fix a plothole etc
<:sip:597321444761796609>
i couldnt tell if cypher was asking the definition of retcon or was asking what got retconned
<:sip:597321444761796609>
so a non ending anime. roger that, easy to avoid
3 chickens
i mean have u seen me cypher?
thanks internet
never heard of this till now. and i already spoiled just googling her name
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
i'll take keima over zenitsu any day. keima doesnt yell constantly
ive heard many disappointments of that
ah
whats CoTE
i never watched the season season of that
is that aria of the scarlet bullet?
sure ill listen cypher
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
<@87512939107450880> RETCON
i thought u bought the OG storyboard lol
oh
millhi rich
after u listen, please explain angry noises
<:sip:597321444761796609>
it was so good
man why oda nobuna only get one season
looks like fall 2016 to summer 2017 i didnt watch anything new anime wise. just trying to figure out where i had my gap lol
<:sip:597321444761796609>
maybe that was when my friend stopped hanging with me and i stopped watching anime for awhile
im surprised i missed this, i see it came out in 2017
interesting
<:sip:597321444761796609>
so an epilogue
so its an ending that had like an epilogue LN volume that wasnt put into the anime?
is it cause the manga writer did it?
how so?
but its not the book ending?
<:sip:597321444761796609>
like how season 4 of highschool DxD retconned the last like 3-4 episodes of season 3 cause they went all anime only and stupid
no its not datto
unshockingly the one by the konosuba creator is one of the two
2 of them look decent while the rest are ass looking
last season only has 3 (4 if you count the milf one but i dont know if i would cause its just a videogame?) while this next season has i think 6. for sure 5
imagine someone whos actually played the game xD
ive never played it but i easily noticed the inaccuracy
i realize im overanalyzing this anime but cmon. stick to the rules. i had this same issue with sao lol
also i dont know the currency equivalent but he had way more than 11 dirhams sitting there for him to lose in one move.
it was. ill just be very bothered if they dont actually set up win conditions for board games
which is 4 of the 6 tiles
he's blue. like cmon, turn around and you have a safety net of 2-3

unless you cant do a full 180 degrees.
he was saying no matter what direction but i very obviously saw he has a safe route of his own rugs
tho the game board was misdone
i think this is for the niche people who love boardgames. its cute and i want to buy that Rug game now. looks fun
i just started watching Saikoro Club. its sooooo weird seeing boardgames i own in this anime
<:sip:597321444761796609>
xD
im supposed to be watching anime right now
he's liking this season way more than the first two
also i totally binged half of GX symphogear last night with my bro
noice
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
all over the place?
thirsty boys love their giant naked breasts
sadly yea
SO CAN NOBUNA
DXD DID IT
<@!476058996315389953> is it a movie or a long episode? i was kinda confused at it
Such a damn good episode
<@115744398997716995> kono S2 ep1 was probably the best thing I've watched since this season started.
If you need something now to watch before then. I highly recommend watching Chihayafuru and kono oto tomare. Their latest seasons are airing now
<@115744398997716995> by Saturday I'll have a definite top 3-5 to give you
Shoot me now.
And there's 5-6 more unrrleased first episodes to watch still
5 animes to watch that have come out
I didn't really have a third option atm so I'll give it to pso2 right now. I still have let's see...
The three decent ones were Babylon, choyoyu, and phantasy star online 2 - episode Oracle. Of the three. PSO2 is the best contender for top 3. Not konosuba. And oresuki. Are currently in my top 3.
aight im done for tonight. couldnt make it thru 10. im ded
3 to 5
this got bloody quick
woooow
time to see if the phantasy star anime is a bust
it was a 5 minute anime. half of it was the op lol
2 to 5.
2 to 4.
is it bad that im on guard with animes that exclusively have extremely attractive males?
if we include psychopasss thats 4 at once
wait we have multiple detective/police animes this season? thats random lol
2 to 3 now
i'll keep u posted if it lets me down
i enjoyed it
whats up?
i also watched the cautiou hero tho
no its the 7 people isekai
just finished Choyoyu. people told me it was boring but i quite liked it
dope
Babylon is a hit. 1 H, 3D, next!
god it looks so much better than the other shows ive tried this season
i already like the looks of this animation wise
its not? oh i only ever saw it with mappa
bro babylon animation studio totally plagurized Mappas motorcycle intro. not cool
three episods of babylon huh? i wonder if its like vinland saga where u kinda have to watch all three at once
NEXT
ah i already watched this one. Ahiru no sora. basically haikyu but with basketball it looks like, except a lot less polished. could be interesting but you can tell its got an old source. i could feel the early 2000s on it lol
anyways. next show!
youre not wrong
like his road rage was amusing
toucan is crazy af, so his yelling works.
it actually works pretty well
zenitsu from demonslayer as a crazy ass Toucan was probably the best paRT
Africa No Salaryman, a bunch of skits about animal people in business suits. could be fun but i just couldnt get into it
onto the next!
first was a possible dud. the songs from it will be worth listening to but Actors - Song Connection was a pretty boring first episode. only the ending really catches you possibly with its mystery. but the character interactions were your standard fare. i'll give it one more episode
sure, im trying out everything this season so i can give a top 3-5 after i try everything
well here i go.
about to watch 10 different random animes at once of this season. anyone wanna guess how many are duds?
i mean i would think the people animating would get experienced and get better at doing it
isnt there a non ufotable fate going on right now? i wonder how it looks
me too
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
hogging all the good animation
im just happy other works can benefit now and not just fate
that last episode of demon slayer CG was crazy for a tv show
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
a lot of the animes i watched yesterday were definitly subpar animation wise. even the couple of things i did enjoy didnt really look that good either
not to mention digital media has that loss of texture that hand drawn has
its the best of the three imo
its funny cause i think the combat regressed from X to 2 lol
is that Xenoblade chronicles 2?
xD
i mean you arent wrong.
i mean.. i would HOPE story telling, action choreography and animation would just get better over time
<:teehee:518810026769645571>
yea they shouldve just put gundam as a whole
i have zero quality then
<:EveNom:492393235801571328>
but worse
its like facebook
because twitter is some peoples lives
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
im more Cosineially aware
yea berserk and tokyo ghoul are the strange ones on the list to me
i agree
i mean sao is on there. so apparently anything can get in
but because of its popularity?
or so ive been told
im actually surprised gintama wasnt there. as someone who doesnt watch it every season seems to be like a 9 or 10 out of 10
dr. stone while enjoyable shouldnt have even been a contender lol
as a fan of bleach and dbz btw
i dont think any of those deserve to be on there. people forget to judge things as a whole and only rememeber the great fights
this looks more like. whats popular list
whata joke
tokyo ghoul is on there. lmao
the fact yu yu hakusho isnt on there shows its trash
okay. thank you nin, i saw episode 0 and was confused
looking great right?

never knew what crazy stuff would happen each episode
man was it a wild ride though
a little. i was hoping ||the two childhood friends wouldnt actually end up together||
yeaaaa
also Oh Maidens was seriously so good
okay
do i suffer thru more anime tonight?
Okaus
<a:catsquee:618536628838989824>
<@256945399338631168> can I recommend some animes for that list?
Well it was fun chatting. Back to work for me. Lunch break is never long enough lol
i was honestly hoping this season was a dud new anime wise just cause of everyhing im guaranteed to be watching
thank god i have 5 returning animes to watch on top of those two
watching all these bad animes make me appreciate the good ones
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
ive looked at most of them
thats one way to look at it lol
i eat eggs for breakfast usually.
<@256945399338631168> i snack on apples or jerky if i get peckish
now that symphogear is over.what will fill my action packed magical girl hole in my heart
<:TB:441562395245281281>
lol i knew u were gonna mention CG
help me get fit
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
yori sounds like what i want to be
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
<:teehee:518810026769645571>
like videogames
literally i mean
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
but you need to draw to animated something. you dont need to animate to draw
yori you were ready for that
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
drawing would be such a cool skill to have. i wish i started when i was younger
<a:catsquee:618536628838989824>
blu ray master race for all the corrections
<a:whalenow:627574100700954654>
just more content to eventually be adapted into sao abridged
<@279341087494242304>
Came out in 04
Get ride! AM Driver. It got dubbed up to like episode 15-18. Then the studio died. Never got fan subbed past that point either I think. Has 50ish episodes
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I have a raw anime that nobody ever subbed from the mid 2000s. It makes me sad
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
Demon Slayer is anime betterthan the manga
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
im a fan. F for me
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
why do u sound like mickey mouse
oh god kallen
he's in an aslyum?
wat
god this is giving me like season one yugioh abridged flashbacks
i know that one
whats code ment?
yea thats probably the one thing i dont like either about it
i could see that, i really enjoyed all the bakugo scenes tho
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
i liked it
<:sip:597321444761796609>
<@!264373970118246400> how does MHA abridged turn to shit if only one episode of it exists?
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
Pokemon died when it went 3D
we all interpret things differently
its really made more towards children even more so than it was in the past. X and Y was the closest it probably appealed to young adults
especially during fights
still obviously VNs but very expressive
i like how the MuvLuv VNs do it. theyre very animated and i love them
<a:catsquee:618536628838989824>
I heard fate. She's my favorite
Pansy is best girl cause atm (only watched two episodes) she's the only not bitch
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Detonation subs. Sounds dangerous
like i feel i watched an entire anime in 3 episodes
i legit have no idea
ikr?
after the events of episode 3 that were wild from beginning to end. (so much happened) i really cant wait for episode 4
its hard to describe without spoiling the plot twist of the first episode but ||it follows basically the friend of a main character in a harem anime. But its not shown at first like that. hes a protagonist that made friends with two girls he really likes but they like his Best friend whos the star of the baseball team, attractive, etc. etc. and he's forced to help them|| its honestly quite funny
Ore o Suki nano wa Omae dake kayo or Oresuki for short. is easily the best thing im watching this season. its so crazy and i love it. i really have no idea where it will go next after 3 episodes. i cant wait. i can recommend this for the new season
If it was ver. I would be scared
<:TB:441562395245281281>
Carol as your pfp makes sense
<:pog:522650185390620693>
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
U don't like cops?
I'm not up to date tho. I'll have time to catch up this weekend
<a:catsquee:618536628838989824>
I am
So I'm counting my blessings
Of the 7 only one seemed to be water damaged enough to bother the figure. Which is the base specifically.
Crushing these boxes to fit into a garbage bag is soul crushing
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
We had a water leak and one of my boxes of figures got water damaged. I'm so pissed. Quite a few were unopened. Now their boxes are ruined
isnt the point of watching a show is to.. watch the show? xD
thats an interesting way to try to watch that show
to be fair k-on came out what a decade ago? a lot of the girls are gonna sound different now
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
now i will imagine saint germain with giant eyebrows
i wouldnt cause i just started AXZ, and barely remember what the K-on girls sound like anymore xD
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
i will say mio and maria is quite different
shes mio? wat
the melody and her voice is just so nice for me
her songs are always my favorite tho xD
yea some people really do. not to crap on other VAs but i feel like Maria's VA (who i love her voice) is basically the same in every role she has
man im getting bad at recognizing VAs. i thought for sure whoever voiced shiro also voices Laffey in the recent Azur lane but it looks like im wrong there
oh she is?
i never tried saekano. the title made me not interested honestly
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
i still remember when in season 1 with hibiki and that Deep af zesshou in the final episode
i always noticed her singing was deeper
<:Viking:620333946638434307>
i love kirikas high pitched voice tho
oh really?
<a:ayayaTriggered:493678518845177858>
she honestly sounds like shes trying to impersonate tsubasa in that role.
how did i miss this
oh i totally hear it now
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
wait kirika is Darkness from konosuba?
<a:whalenow:627574100700954654>
cast her in season 2
<:sip:597321444761796609>
can Nana will No game no life and mondaiji to get a second season please
<@297542051057238017> i didnt know that, ive always called it A X Z.
oh hey sentai has a sale going on. time to see if anything worthwhile before BF sales
Everyone wants a cut of the Netflix/Hulu pie
I mean these multitude of subscription services are promoting piracy again. Can't afford 10 different things to watch my showz
without spoiling Kono is easily my favorite thing im watching this season so far. it hits you in the feels. i love this show to death
season 3 starting so much later than all the other animes is killing me tho
i love it
Kono is the shorter of the two. if you dont want something super long.
<a:ayayaTriggered:493678518845177858>
i wish more people watched those shows (that i know)
<@256945399338631168> go watch Kono oto Tomare and Chihayafuru previous seasons so you can watch the currently airing season of them. theyre so good
~~its been all downhill since the first one~~
<a:catsquee:618536628838989824> <a:catsquee:618536628838989824> <a:catsquee:618536628838989824>
Please talk to me after watching oresuki
Yessss
There's a couple shows I haven't tried yet but everything I have watched is up to episode 3 atm
Oresuki is my top new show to watch. Followed by hataage (konosuba creator) and No Guns Life.
<a:catsquee:618536628838989824>
<@256945399338631168> I do!
you got me interested
damn okay its back on my watch list
<:sip:597321444761796609> i see
did you watch seasonal shows?
its a nice show, i could tell that much. just aint for me
i have a hard time watching shows that i feel are slower chill animes that not a lot happen in but are just great feeling animes
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
i did watch two thirds of it though
~~dont kill me~~
~~im sorry im not a fan of the show.~~
I'd be so mad lol
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Imagine paying 60 bucks for lost song and beating it in one sitting
How short we talking?
Oh really? I've been told lost song is the worst Sao game so I never tried it personally
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
I just hated how the game was still do whatever Kirito was doing with your create a char
Fatal bullet was easily the most fun I had with an Sao gamd
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
But not the anime
Hollowzone added philia. and she's probably my favorite Sao girl ~~even if she isn't canon~~
I thought it was. For jrpgs that overexplain stuff. That one explains too little and just expects u to know what to do. I was so lost in the hollow zone initially. I was like what am I supposed to do? What's my go here?
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
I guess. I remember the first one being so obtuse with all it's mechanics and grindig/level up system. I thought who thought this was fun?
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Maybe this one will be good I think
~~tho I stupidly keep trying the mediocre games and getting burned~~
Im in the camp where I don't hate the show. I just don't think it's a good show so I don't bother with it anymore
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
So it's easy to hate on the qoute. Worse popular show atm
It's just those worse shows aren't as popular
Oh for sure
<:TB:441562395245281281>
Don't forget the movie where the villian deflects an imaginary bullet and lands after a multiple story drop that should've injured him
if only it was a better story 😭
music is always top notch
i agree with that
my bro gets home in an hour and i cant wait to watch
the character interactions are so damn good
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
I also am not the biggest fan of the transfer mechanic between virtual world's to basically allow you to be high lvl wherever you go. Minus gear
Not going thru this shit again
We were going back to garbage elf online world. I was like NOPE I'm out
I dropped Sao anime after the ggo arc so I never had the pleasure of seeing yuuki outside of the games
But yea seven and rain look dope. Continuing the trend of game Sao girls are better than the anime ones lol
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
I enjoy purple motifs
I like her design
<@152896851660505088> zeliska
Kureha is pink
No
I also really liked that purple haired girl in FB
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh rain is a game only char. Im sure I'll like her
Or am I mistaken on that
Didn't reki make Sao like in his teens or something? And that's why the writing isn't especially good at first?
Philia was what kept me going in the game
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Like playing hollow fragment was when I realized how boring the og anime cast was
I just think a majority of the cast is boring and uninteresting. Probably why I gravitate towards philia and strea cause they are interesting. ~~to me~~
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
If only FB didn't shove Kirito into every cutscenes almost
~~just let me play as strea or philia and I don't need a create a character~~
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
Well you let me know if there's ever one worth wasting my time on. Otherwise it's an easy pass for me lol
I can't wait to replay DQ11 on switch when I have the time
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Like I want to play more Sao games but in my brain I think. But I could just play a good rpgs like dragon quest or persona instead.
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Like I was getting shot at from angles or distances that seemed impossible to
I got really mad at FB cause I felt like the enemy ai accuracy was TOO good
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
I liked nine before she was eaten
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
If it ever goes on super sale for the switch. Ill pick it up
She's so cute
<a:catsquee:618536628838989824>
Yay!
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
I feel like I'm the only person who hates her leafa look and prefers her as suguha
<:TB:441562395245281281>
Lol character development. Good one stan
<:TB:441562395245281281> <:TB:441562395245281281>
Lmao I was JUST writing about the south doing it
I mean it's also like accident incest? She fell in love with a guy who happened to be her cousin
I forgot about that. Quinella lmao
<:TB:441562395245281281>
Oh I've been shown/told about the finale of alicization.
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
Sadly I didn't get that far so she's currently in the trash tier
But everyone is so par for course
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
She was cool for her intro episode. But after she came back as a blood member. She was so generic and tropey
Cause she's so dumb. I hated her in sao
~~i mean I hate Asuna so I probably wouldn't enjoy an arc as her as the lead either~~
Let me know how UR is
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
~~you telling me that a single lower lvl guy can kill you with a single stab that he moves around and your auto battle heal doesn't beat it in healing vs damage~~
It killed the gamer in me
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Which killed the show for me
I'm more referring to the moments of og Sao that had established rules in place. And said rules are ignored so plot can. Happen
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
I mean that's what happens when you write about stuff u have no clue about. Seemed like reki had very little knowledge when it came to gaming  in general
Lol
That would kill video games irl I feel like
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
<:TB:441562395245281281>
Thank u danmachi for making me think argonaut
Oh snap I was right
Argo?
What's this chicks name? I always forget
Too offset my height
My little ai robo girl was as tiny as possible with a silver and purple theme
<:TB:441562395245281281>
To show
I would have to rebuy the game
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
I made my girl tall af. And blue hair
Yes
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
Same
Tho I think her natural hair color would've blended in better
I like her colors for her outfit
She so god damn cute

<:pepeglock:552540084616822801>
That's why
No these are fake elves
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Do I just hate elf ears
Lol yea oddly enough I don't mind this leafa
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I forgot how good philia looked in ggo
Looking up all the ggo designs now
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
I also think I just dislike unnatural hair colors now tho.
As a not fan of asuna. I like her ginger hair more
~~sachi died early cause she started having character development and we can't have that~~
I like normal color toned sinon
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
I hate blue haired sinon
~~all the alo designs are generic~~
<:sweat:550739406739472395>
im dragging behind a bit cause of how many shows im watching
oh i havent watched 3 yet. only 2
san diego xD
i got the one thing i wanted episode one
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
also rip solopy
rip solo
Azur lane is on the chopping block for me lol
im trying to give all the shows the three episode benefit before chopping them too early
thats fair
ive personally been enjoying Choyoyu quite a bit. theyve have to mess up pretty hard to make me drop it.
rifle is beautiful is one of the 4 i still need to watch lol
i have 4 shows i still havent tried yet. but yea atm
i wonder how many of these ill drop halfway thru xD
seeing all the animes im watching this season listed. is kinda daunting

Something about watching an opening or ending sung by a character in the show feels so nice
It's the most fun I had with na Sao game. (which isn't a high bar)
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
I'm very curious what the gaming scene will be in Japan when the next gen comes out.
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
Gotta love imbalanced japanese games
Pfft
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
No I mean the open and close abuse
Wait for real?
<:sip:597321444761796609>
it is
<:sweat:550739406739472395>
normally i rewatch anime fight scenes cause theyre awesome. but this is the first time rewatched an emotional scene cause it just hits you with the good feels
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
oh snap
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
(i thought millhi was a woman)
millhi is eternal
millhi has been around since the dawn of time itself
i hope i do too
<:VeeYay:610712062838177792>
alright im gonna go finish off the last 4 animes. ill be back inbetween each episode
full time*
~~i would hope all of us have jobs if we dont go to school free time~~
i need to give that another shot. episode 1 was okay
i wish chihaya was tues lol
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
did you see my weds line up?
i was just going off of the live timer
i think
it says like 1 day and 21 hours so itll be a wednesday most likel
episode 2 when they were rescuing San diego and she does her little Hello like when you pull her from the game. had me dying laughing
i wasnt super feeling it until episode 3
its hilarious
yea its by the konosuba creator
just bcs lol
theyre both isekai arent they?
just looks like more stupid fun.
whelp first anime was a hit. i can definitely say i was not expecting two different animes in the same season (or year for that matter) to have a German Suplex in it.
Do as i say! not as i do!
<:yas:605615695778021377>
we arent too. but if nobodies around to see me
its this thing that happens when two people communicate with words back and forth. very archaic. dont see it happen too often anymore <@139432096023183360>
~~i use my phone for games more than socializing~~
<:TB:441562395245281281>
when i used to babysit my cousins who were 11 at the time and i was 22. they once asked me how old i was and when i responded with 22, they were like. WHAT but youre fun to hang out with! ~~cause apparently all adults are unfun~~
speaking of family. kids can say the funniest things.
<:doge:496780220309962772>
Family member: Woah i cant believe you got me this. its like 300 bucks
Me: Anything for you. ~~got it for like 60 bucks thanks to clearence/coupons/sale day~~
since im a deal hunter my gifts usually are cheaper then the other gifts. ~~but if i paid full price theyd be even~~
^
not since adulthood
<:sip:597321444761796609>
millhi my birthday is also in january
<:rocry:464546114490597389>
world*
im ancient in the anime/jrpg workd
I'm a senpai
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh I'm one year older than millhi
Mairimashita! Iruma-kun, episode 3 clinched it for me. love this show and its stupidity
on the blu ray from rightstuf ~~YAR~~
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
literally had the scooby doo run noise
they...
it just feels so... anime
i feel like i went back in time and am watching an anime from like the late 90s early 2000s
i gotta say. after 2 episodes
good luck
likewise
the biggest shaft of them all lol
rip princess
<:rocry:464546114490597389>
too many chars i liked looked worse
akatsuki was one of the only char that i think looked better season 2 than one
i still hate how they ruined Marie's character design
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
lots of animes change the opening after only 12 episodes
i love the database song but come on. database for 50 episodes?
talk about lazy
im still shocked they reussed that song
i agree millhi
<:rocry:464546114490597389>
after season 2. i dont want another log horizon
<a:ayayaTriggered:493678518845177858>
with a drop kick
actually its more kick the face
seeing an animal loving man kick the ass of other adventures/heroes that attack monsters cause thats all the know. is just hilarious
it was so funny
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
i thought quintessential quintuplets was the quintessential harem anime
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Seeing reactions to Oresuki is so funny.
"i came for a trashy romantic school anime. and i got 4D chess"
to change topic to the season shows
<a:karinbye:586936068159307792>
why so blue
thats unfortunate. was it a Fan TL or official?
sounds like the series was put on the back burner from the info you gave
no clue honestly. never was into accel world.
interesting
oh it does?
i cant read japanese so i havent had teh opportunity sadly
i really want to play altered fable
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
i chose Meiya too. shes just so fun to tease
also who did you force to eat the food before riding in the mech? i loved throwing that back on one of the girls and how they all just join your side to do it to the poor soul u chose xD
<@279341087494242304> i feel like theres a lot of this theyre going to cut cause its just not possible on tv lol
repressed*
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
i think i regressed that memory until solopy brought it back up to the surface
okay yea. that was Fd up too
i was a hot mess
can you DM me what you are referring to as twizzlers? after the chomp it was a blurry cryfilled playthru until the end
i loved her in the Original VN. so when that happened. i died
chomp
until a certain incident in Alternative put me into a 3 day depression where i didnt do anything
i did too.
i liked alternative. and the individual chronicles games (the ones Fan TLed atm at least)
i was a fan
i just hope that this anime is like a million times better than the last muvluv anime
i didnt even know muvluv had a mobile game to begine with
i could be thinking of the guy with her
i thought it did.
oh i see.
||aint she dead too?||
so weird to include him
also aint last dude ||already dead?||
why anime when we can T Pose
to assert dominance
<:Viking:620333946638434307>
no clue. maybe everything will get fixed with the Blu ray release
lol
trying to make it look better?
That is indeed a gold saw ikxi
<@189146272865845248> I'm going to. I just wanted to see how much I could fit into one before going all in on totes lol
So much wasted space
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
My tote can't really fit some of these oversized boxes tho.
I like being able to see what's in each bix
Im shifting to totes. Trying one out

Melua has a nice palm
Anime convention is next week. I'm hyped!
I saw an h manga once that did the same thing as that manga. Was cool
sounds like complete garbage but could be amazing like Killing Bites
oh and Aki is Medaka. okay. three of the four i know in animes at least. the fourth seems to have no career in anime outside of a few movies tho
shes great in my book
whelp
oh shit. haruka is Pansy from oresuki
i only recognize ayahi's name from the four lol
i also didnt realize ayahi was in an idol group
lol thats so random
oh she plays the main char of Venus Versus Virus. i only ever saw that dubbed. rip.
maybe a one off line lol
im sorry what? herself? she just plays herself in this fantasy anime?
I Couldn’t Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job. – Herself
so im looking at her roles and one stuck out to me as very confusing
also she could play a small roll in Chihayafuru S3 if that one girl comes back for another tournament
man i wouldve never guessed
wat. shes henrietta from Log horizon?
i feel like her voice is wasted on derriere tho. since she barely talks or shows emotion
true true
she has a great angry voice
which makes me sad cause shes great as chris
Makes me happy
<a:catsquee:618536628838989824>
Ayahi has lines in Chihayafuru too
Have me a good chuckle. Only in her dreams lol
<a:catsquee:618536628838989824>
Ayahi reprised her roll in Chihayafuru
<:worrynou:541110949822857227>  <@!302063351767498752>
its easily worth owning on my shelf
ill buy the blu ray when i can
god i love this song
<@!388516680742993933> just started listening to a Flac of the full opening.
solopy i think i had a stroke reading that
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Pop it in.
<@98541382393688064> how did u fit 12 episodes on something that says 120 mins
I wonder how much they have to pay someone for a single line
so who was OG love interest? haruna? then Lala and then Darkness?
i have no clue on tu love ru. tell me
<:pepelmao:569002042572406796>
<@279341087494242304> street fighter Ryu has a 1/1 statue. best anime ever
i know Rem and Ram have 1/1 figures as well
next to each other

rip
xD
says 87
i have no clue let me check
lol someone measured her bust. shes 84cm on the figure xD
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
thats very good looking


let me double check
i think Lala also had one but it was much worse in comparison (the mouth is weird)
a piece
for 25 grand
i think 10 exist

let me grab a pic brb
<:pepelmao:569002042572406796>
so she wins by default
momo has a 1/1 statue of herself in japan
since i know where their preorder page is lol
i know i just use them as a refrence
so we will proably see kaguyasama bluray in mid next year
everything on preorder on Sentai filmworks looks to date the last season of last year
it just released in january. so i doubt we will see a blu ray until aroud same time next year
no its not
sup?
i dont buy a whole lot week to week outside of groceries
i save my money to splurge during those times
bought like 50ish animes
i spent like 500 bucks during Sentai filmworks blow out BF sale
they had blu rays from 5-11 bucks
<@!388516680742993933> wait for black friday like my broke ass
i dont buy merch so this is the only way to show support
because i refuse to pay for subscription services but i'd like to support things i love
i get blu rays so i can share the show with another person ~~and give me a reason to rewatch shows i love~~
<:worrynou:541110949822857227>
no u
lolol
~~an isekai for that you mean~~
i'd rather be a dog. get to lounge around all day and eat and play.
are weird
the people who control the media
i dunno media is weird man
they did back in the 2000s era
no because i dont show him shows that are like mainly ecchi shows first. like tu love ru. but i do show shows that have ecchi in them
im slowly desensitizing him to the anime ecchi norm
though he was fine with killing bites cause it had more murder and fights than sexual fanservice (most of the time)
yep lol
<:madopeek:572976023893835796>
but he's completely fine with horror and people getting their heads blown up or body torn to shreds
my bro hates anything sexual in animes. he just wants a good story and fights. he doesnt want all the unnecessary camera angles and what not
i dont know who that is. <@279341087494242304> hey for some people thats an instant no
you know its trash but damn does it taste so good
its like the best junk food
~~also the show shows full nipple so be warned~~
i was very surprised
the fights are honestly really freaking good
<a:whalenow:627574100700954654>
hyper violence. hyper sexual. all good fun
you would like Killing bites then
||shots fired||
<:doge:496780220309962772>
what if you like actual hentai
<:madopeek:572976023893835796>
bills are not a myth
sadly
<@!264373970118246400> my job is not a myth
god its so stupid but so good. i love konosuba author
its why im loving Hataage atm
adult me is like.. Nah i have actual Adult stuff i could watch instead
teenage me probably wouldve loved the show
~~sometimes actually porn~~
top tier almost porn
<@!302063351767498752> its shit but if you like ecchi. its the best
huh
it reminds me of the story i heard about gundam seed where a character was supposed to die but the Wife of the story dude loved the char so he made him survive
rip lala
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
why does one piece get a billion episodes but everythign i like gets 12
i want more of things i like sorano!
i actually havent watched it yet. im gonna buy the blu ray this year and enjoy it
~~wheres my season two of tanya~~
god is such a dick lol
and makes her the average power of every human in existence
and god takes her request very wrong
it follows a woman in highschool forced to be the best but in doing so had no friends. so when she gets another chance she asks to be average
that looks like the cute fun anime of this season
oh i see. i heard shes bed ridden a lot so i just assumed
~~that isnt gamefied~~
but since she isnt an otaku. she has actual knowledge and skills she can apply to the real world
no special powers
thats why i want to watch book isekai. gets to go to a nother world but is born as a sickly girl
holy crap i unexpectedly love the absurdity of it
<@202536957685923841> IT JUST GETS BETTER
i tried episode one of val x love. holy shit i never stopped watching a show so fast. didnt even finish first episode
an isekai where you get the shit end of the stick basically
yea i heard its a slow burner but it seems like an anime im interested in
hataage is the best isekai this season. made me laugh a ton. the demon school isekai is also really funny (episode 3 was amazing) and i still need to watch book isekai and the last one
like i can tell its trying to make me laugh but it just doesnt
i guess for me the jokes just dont land for shinchou
raging war on a whole nation
i like where choyoyu can go. its gonna be wild i hope after this current episode
this season
shinchou is probably the most unentertaining for me of all the isekai ive watched
im more shocked that more than half of them dont suck. out of the 7

thats why i said tongue in cheek fun
nobody is
forgot to post 1/1 rem

i mean its konosuba. i expect much from this pedigree
it really is just stupid fun tho
but i see nothing wrong with that
i think the whole recurring joke with that house wife woman is one
its definitely tongue in cheek poking fun at people who like catgirls and such/ the furry community
its amazing oclisto
Hataage. Kemono Michi
<@!264373970118246400> i dont have memories from a past life. i cant be isekai'd
on pc
i feel like 50-75% of the ones i see nowadays are just sex filled.
had like a new one every few weeks
i miss when VNs were translated a lot like a decade or so ago
F
majikoi would be in my top 10 for sure
i think my all time favorite VN is going to be bewteen Ever 17, Tsukihime, or Muv Luv Alternative.
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
i hear theyre great
i see them all the time
okay stan
i dont think ive ever played a yuri VN. i have play an otome tho
no hablo espanol
im all down for fun but man. that show really knows how to hit my heart
i wish more shows could make me feel good like Kono oto Tomare
okay at first i was like hard pass but now im more interested lol
i... see
i thought konosuba was their only good show. whats sakura trick? never heard of it
you'll see worse cg there
watch Hand shakers
im so not looking forward to that
Deen is also handling the remake of Sorcerer stabber Orphen
<:doge:496780220309962772>
~~then again better to be in limbo than seven deadly sins s3 or OPM s2~~
is it bad i want to watch that latest boruto arc that has him going to the past to hang with OG naruto? i dropped shippuden midway and never watched boruto
god i forgot about this. thank u for reminding me solopy
<:doge:496780220309962772>
i was not expecting the AoT refrence either. he did a good renactment when he was doing story time with manga lol
<:pepelmao:569002042572406796>
god when she sees a tv for the first time
its decent. a fun little show about japan showing fantasy world things about earth and they liked anime the most so they try to add it to their culture
the episode where elf girl is hiding in his bag. was the funniest shit
i should watch it fully.
i never finished outbreak company. (was when my friend stopped hanging with me and i stopped anime) i was around episode 8 i think
;-;
dont remind me stan
that reverse isekai where a demon lord works at mcdonalds is like one of the best isekais to date
nobody calls digimon an isekai
<@279341087494242304> after the term isekai was coined i mean lol
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
do we have any mecha isekais?
that is pretty isekai to me
i mean he does go to a parallel world of his own at a different time where aliens exist
~~inb4 this is labeled as an Isekai~~
the main char and everything
yea how will they explain that?
~~they gonna have to remove a lot of stuff to make it watchable on tv~~
that still blows my mind solopy
im legit surprised there was never a tsukihime event in fgo
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
taking up all his time
damn fate for being so much of a money maker
i think the last time i looked at majikoi S only one route was done
~~to be fair i havent looked at VNs in years~~
S isnt full translated i thought.
majikoi, A-1, A-2 and..?
my dream VN would be all the muv luv stuff thats untl'd or Majikoi stuff
~~im still sad koihime musou didnt sell well enough to warrant its sequel~~
theres a reason he was never number one
i think he's referring to the very beginning of the central shake up
like it was such an uneeded antagonist
i was having a ton of fun before that
yea once central got introduced i kinda started to stop caring
<@!264373970118246400> yep
cause life isnt over after that event u know?
i think they like things non ending
i mean thats most japanese media
~~maybe theyll make the ending better~~
it is two cour
ive been told this season will finish it up
i still dont know the ending cause im anime only
i mean its so over the top. if it was more normalish i could see a sport anime.
battle i would think
~~the sad life of a manga worker~~
can i have the anime names for someone uninformed. i  dont know araki or watsuki either
<@279341087494242304> probably cause theyre not given enough warning to make a satisfying ending
i love everything YYH until the three kings arc
Yu Yu hakusho
my all time favorite anime had a pooped ending sadly.
good times
bro i forgot busou renkin existed.
i dont know who that is. better to name the show thant the person
i feel like thats a recurring trend with a lot of shounens
anime logic
thats what happens when u go to train underneath an evil snake man and ditch your friends
sasuke was a piece of garbage most of naruto
i dont agree with that since ichigo usually does things out of compassion for his friends or family.
its the Goku template
because he wasnt a doofy idiot that ate impossible amounts of food like all the rest
the only big shounen show that had a main char i liked xD
i miss bleach. that was my shonen show
feeling oddly nostalgic to see orange boy on screen
<:whatidoCAT:630462601796780032>
Arceuid wasn't cute enough
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Like               anime . It really sucked when they didn't have Shiki's thoughts.
When they come from VNs
Not seeing thought processes really screws over protags in animes
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
Is he that unlikeable?
I haven't watched either show in either language
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
its great. one of the few dubbed anime shows i watch lol
oh so its similar to say Full metal panic where they have a serious arc, comedy arc. then back to serious
was gonna ask what the plot of gintama was but i can just google it lol
damn autocorrect
humor*
it seems to have a lot of refrencial human that would be lost on me
ive never seen it but i saw the top 100 and i was like. okay it cant be THIS good every season
is gintama actually that good?
<:madopeek:572976023893835796>
brotherhood is number one anime
okay? we all see and dont see things other people have.
but sure me
i mean im not the only person who has this conception
oh the promo shots always showed 5 girls so people probably just saw it as something basically like Quintuplets
its a smart kid tutoring 5 girls isnt it?
oh this anime that looked like 5 quintuplets but existed before that manga
wut?
<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
i am indeed
<a:whalenow:627574100700954654>
money
<:madopeek:572976023893835796>
I have both chilling on my shelf lol
I was thinking I should give it another shot when I have a lull in games to play
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Yea I got really bored with the world building and the tropes
That one I easily played to completion
It just didn't hook me like original Uta
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
Can I be a little mean and say I didn't enjoy what I played of deception. I got kinda bored after 10 or so hours.
Oh noice.
On pc
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Both masks are apart of original uta tho right?
Zan
Can was the latest one released tho right?
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
The PS4 had three uta games?
Mask of truth is the second game on the PS4 right?
~~its like the China thing in terra formers~~
Is it sad I was happy when the woman with grossly large boobs died? Like alternative trained me to be ready for character deaths and this had like none
Main char was stupid af dense for as combat savvy as he was
We doing this in a post apocalyptic setting where aliens are eating people?
Like really?
I hated the love triangle that was going on
Very boring
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I don't think I can handle this show
Like if it shows all the brutality of the aliens in this
I wonder how graphics all the deaths will br
That was probably the biggest wtf moment of the VN
There's no way they could show thar
They have to don't they?
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
My heart couldn't bare for that
Please don't animated chomp
Oh god
That shit was long af
I feel like it needs two seasons of 24 to do the whole story
<:whatidoCAT:630462601796780032>
Muv Liv alternative
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
At least they weren't clamp proportions
I do acknowledge hurt. I remember SDS S3 every day
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Can u tell the more extreme fanbase to calm down?
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544>
I never tried JoJo. But every fan of it I know is like a super fan
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
What other shounen in the 80s?
Just manly men
<:pepeglock:552540084616822801>
But keep his style Tho. No pretty bois
Hey man. When u got a perfect artstyle. Why change it lol
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I wish rave masters mangaka style never changed
Noice
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Thank u for connecting an anime to his name
Oh?
<:whatidoCAT:630462601796780032>
Is it an actual ending?
Rip
That anime nobody watched
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I will assist
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Inb4 studio deen
Yu-no was a dumpster fire of an anime
Only time will tell if that's good
<:sweat:550739406739472395>
The tfs fights were so good man
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Man i wish more companies outsourced/sold their engines for other people to make dope ass games in too
<:sweat:550739406739472395>
Solopy did u have a stroke at the end of your sentence?
Alternative and then the day after chronicles or whatever they're called. Are extremely animated for VNs
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
im gonna assume yes cause she looks like a smol asian woman.
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Adorable Nezuko cosplay for u guys
i still need to watch the tv series
is eden zero same world or different?
<:doge:496780220309962772>
or mashima forgot what the rave master world looked like and just made up something new for fairy tail
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
untranslated but

where does Rave Master take place
I specifically remember shakugan no Shana op doing thay
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Like have a 2 min long op but having the video be 10 minutes would make the 2 min op look significantly better
Man I remember back in the day people finding tricks to make things look better on youtube
~~the show died after the chunin exams~~
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Sounds about right
<:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
Why your ending so rushed?
I love when 12 episode animes have filler. Like u think u have time for that?
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
<@115744398997716995> best explanation for ya
I don't think I can make it longer than that
Pot of greed is a magic card that when played allows the player who played it to draw two additional cards and add them to their hand.
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I throw down a face down!
Get your game on!
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Like Chihayafuru is gonna be 75ish episodes over the course of three 24 episode seasons
<@279341087494242304> I'm okay with over 50 episodes of they are like condensed into smaller seasons of 12 or 24
Also I hope that red head pops up again. I love her design
Man Stan. I can't wait for next episode of Oresuki
Must've wasted all their budget
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
I've been told that by a couple peeps now
It was 12 by 18 or 11 by 17
I really want this art of Pyra and Mythra from Xenoblade
I wish canvas art was so expensive at cons. Paying 60 bucks is a lot man
If I remember when Im in the shopping area again tomorrow. I'll take a pic of it lol
<:TB:441562395245281281>
It's a huge ass burger she's holding in-between chopsticks
<@264373970118246400> there was a saber borger too. I almost bought it
I was legit shocked to find any zoids art at all
<@99695384296701952> always showing your quality taste
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>



I bought a bunch of art prints at the convention today! Will probably buy more tomorrow maybe lol
Really misleading ANN smh
To make it feel fresh and make you want to watch things now rather than later
Everything is on rotation.
~~it was probably made after he talked about archery club~~
<@!388516680742993933> bruh why ishigami got rope xDDD
That sounds like a lot of extra effort
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
<@87512939107450880> ready for pic spam? Lol
I went a little overboard lol
Too much honestly
Time to take pics!
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I spent all my convention budget
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
But characters themselves looked good in FT for the most part
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
I don't know if he ever finished it before his artstyle changed to FT artstyle but I personally prefer his older style character wise. I mean the main char translated horribly to FT.
I loved RM personally. I wish the anime was longer.
~~sadly no.~~
~~its a joke from original Rave master that also came over to FT~~
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
THATS A DOG?
~~i know it's a different universe~~
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Man haru just doesn't care where plu goes huh
Still around? Lol
How's plu?
<:jesus:605616674418327552>
Well she'd be voiced by the same person if it ever got an anime. So I'll want to stab my ears out no matter what
<:pepetears:624053192459550741>
My hotel for my anime convention is really poopy. I'm disappointed
Lucy was the only reason I got as far as i did in FT
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I'm tasting a blueberry muffin right now
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~now it'll be boring but in space~~
There's also a woman who had really nice fgo posters
<a:waifuwhale:635650723333537793>
I'll take pics tomorrow. The shop is closed atm. The main ones I was looking at are these Pyra and Mythra ones that look really good side by side
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Should I spend money on big canvas(vinyl) wall scrolls?
Do et
Another enjoyable episode for me. This is easily the best new show this season for me
I'm glad I didn't say anything important
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
who? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~never paid attention in history class~~
<:madoeyes:498693395179372544> i see these changes
thought i feel like my 2-4 can change per episode
For isekais i'd rate them atm 
1. Ascendence of a bookworm
2. Hataage!
3. Average Abilities
4. Demon School
5. Choyoyu
6. Cautious Hero
holy water scene was the first time the show made me chuckle. ill give it that
choyoyu is 5th place for me. its only slightly higher cause i think Cautious hero fails at comedy and the main char is unnecessary levels of douche
i know solopy. we have so many this season
usually im pretty apathetic when it comes to isekai but theyre all pretty decent. Cautious hero is probably the weakest of the 6
<@202536957685923841> ascendence of a bookworm and Didn't I say to make my abilities average!?
So I got around to watching the last two animes of this season I've been neglecting and damn I can't believe I waited so long. They're the most enjoyable Isekai this season. One is the least anime feeling anime I've watched in a long time and the other is like konosuba making fun of isekais but has comedy more Along the line of hitoribocchi with cute antics.
Well now I have one in zombie form and one in human form lol
Fuck found another
I went over budget. I saw the first Zombieland saga art. Had to buy it
dammit i want next episode so badly
WELL THAT WAS AN ENDING
<:pog:522650185390620693>
5 mins into oresuki latest episode and dayum
It's 25 episodes of forever
<:whatidoCAT:630462601796780032>
Crap I finished the season
It's much better than I expected
I'm at home watching twelve forever
<:ChrisPadoru:640024920729845780>
<@102691114762371072>
I hope yugiri and Tae get backstory next season
<:pokeblush:526120735132090372>
<@102691114762371072> I'm happy u have saki emotes. She's the second best char from that anime
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Oof I looked up the chars and the one who I thought was the main char Saki, isn't saki. Her name is Nodoka. I've legit never seen the actual saki and have only ever seen fan art of nodoka
<:pokeblush:526120735132090372>
<@98541382393688064> Chihayafuru has nice kimonos and other attire like it
<:doge:496780220309962772>
Lots of people have profitted off of watching saki
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Isn't saki about mahjong?
Wat

YAY
san diego best part
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
ME TOO
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Hi datto
I need people to talk to about this bookworm anime ;-; but nobody I know is watching it.
also ascendence of a bookworm was a super good episode too. the plot thickens
<@!98541382393688064> also no longer red head. is honestly Cute af and i love her
<:knucklespeepers:553093971090472980>
wait who was the one who did then
at least people said that
i remember when the anime first came out that the story wouldve never gotten an adaptation cause of how it is
i tried that anime. it was super weird
any HUGE disappointments?
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
<@139432096023183360> are you all caught up?
someone else finally watching the sleeper hit of this season
<:pog:522650185390620693>
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
i have been summoned!
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I've watched none of the series
<:doge:496780220309962772>

i drop things on the ground just to make sure gravity still works
never hurts to confirm
what do u think
carolll
Sadly*
Every shot can't be on model sasly
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
U typed the same thing twice
<:pokeblush:526120735132090372>
I liked it. It's made for big tokusatsu/Ultraman fans. All the fights are animated in a way that would be basically how it's done in live action
It's funny I never noticed she sat next to him either
<:sweat:550739406739472395>
Hnnnng
She was already cute without make up but when she undyed her hair
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
Also red head is the only girl so far to not summon a bench
Cause it's amazinf
It's funny when I initially started this anime. I thought it looked quite unappealing on the first episode. But now I think it looks good
Two empty desks
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
We still have room for one more transfer student too
Honestly the whole class is more detailed than I expected
<:doge:496780220309962772>
~~highschool boys are the best~~
Originally my favorite was the class prez. Her reactions to things are so cute
<@139432096023183360> this was a funny fan service episode. Nice break between the drama
<:doge:496780220309962772>
My bro was like WOAH WOAH WOAH. That's too much of a permanent change for a character!
<:pokeblush:526120735132090372>
She so cute
Also former pink haired girl is my new best girl
Huh?

<:doge:496780220309962772>
It probably sold out super hard and they wanted to make more money
<:ChrisPadoru:640024920729845780>

<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Is that good or bad by Japan standards?  <@152896851660505088>
I hope to not miss demon Slayer movie in theatre like I did konosuba and bunny girl senpai
Noice
I wonder how konosuba did in the box office in japan
I mean bunny girl senpai got a one day showing in select theatres and that's a significantly lesser known series
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I gotta wait. Abillion years for it to hit Blu Ray in Japan so I can get a good rip of it
Lucky
<:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
No pun intended by my statement
Sounds like a blast. Yunyun is my favorite secondary character so her getting more limelight is nice
I know nothing about the movie since I haven't seen it yet. I assume it's just more konosuba but an hour+ long
I mean I don't see why that matters. Its konosuba.
~~vs a villian~~
because they need to catch your eye for the first action scene in the show
<@115744398997716995> i agree. it felt movie esque
<:pokeblush:526120735132090372>
Also her
<@83626774000308224> i loved that thick thighed villian. she honestly kept me going. such an interesting antagonist
~~cause thundercats has a pedigree and many people grew up with the show~~
<:doge:496780220309962772>

Maybe I would like the books over the anime adaptation
Is it bad if I dropped the gatari series after sistergatari? I feeel like the series is very much an acquired taste to the extreme
I think most states are getting a screen showing.
<a:AYAYAJam:580749858529607690>
Oh yea Monday! I get my average abilities Isekai after work
~~i still need to watch shirobako~~
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
so i might be getting a code for 60% of gundam blu rays for rightstuf from someone who has no use for it. man my wallet will be crying if i get it
~~and reincarnated as a slime~~
~~too bad Funimation got Zombieland saga~~
This is how I contribute to the market to show I like sentai filmworks
I do that every day solopy
If only the manga got a fully faithful adaption. That would be wonderful
I really can't say no to 10 dollar animes lol
There's worse and better anime than it *shrugs*
Everything else I haven't seen
I enjoyed them
I've seen both of them
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
<@99695384296701952> are not probably not?
Oh right the animes. 
Scum's wish
Negima!
Negima!?
Princess principle
Girlish number
Flip flappers
Girls last tour
Land of the illustrious
Made in abyss
Hakumei and mikochi
just dropped 125 bucks
Sentai Filmworks started their black friday anime sale early. lots of great animes for 10 bucks
~~unless u like books~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I want kirika to be isekaid into things. She needs to death more
<:doge:496780220309962772>
Remember when Isekai wasn't a genre? But something that happened rarely in animes. Good times
<:whatidoCAT:630462601796780032>
my brain thought louise the zero before fate zero
~~theres too much talking in the monogatari series imo~~
i'd be worried if someone had the exact opinion on everything i liked an disliked
<:sip:597321444761796609>
of course. we are all different afterall
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~all anime is trash~~
Why not?
<:pokeblush:526120735132090372>
I'm so happy I have both of them this season to watch
<@98541382393688064> watch kono oto tomare next. Has the same feeling of Chihayafuru but with music and is a bit more emotional but damn it's so good.
Marathon and enjoy it with me
No sleeping
I recommend it to everyone. It's so good
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Best blind buy I've ever done
<:pokeblush:526120735132090372>
Chihayafuru is so freaking good
~~devil is a part timer season 2 when~~
DxD is one of the only super ecchi animes i can tolerate nowadays
<:doge:496780220309962772>
still too much talking
<:knucklespeepers:553093971090472980>
DxD is a LN series?
i loved shuffle for not picking the generic Childhood friend ending
~~at least each route of fate gets its own series unlike other VNs where they cram all the routes into one incoherent mess~~
rip RV. never watched it but i know of its infamy
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
if thats how you enjoy things i aint gonna stop ya. unless they really screw the pooch like classroom of the elite. im good being anime only
nah im pure anime for my hero. i couldnt go manga for it
fair. i have no opinion on whats the best
i havent
<:sip:597321444761796609>
But for anime only peeps. if they enjoy it. thats all that matters at the end of the day.
~~but if you still enjoy it. does it matter if it portrays shiros head well or not.~~
im guessing aikatsu is an idol anime
rip lol
what did they release?
<:AquaCry:472690243720577053>
but i want to own Magi
<:feelscat2:612704672301449241>
i need a new dream
hey, i never imagined symphogear would be sold in the west on blu ray but its coming.
now if only Aniplex would stop selling their animes at ludicrous prices in the west
im so happy i can get symphogear without killing my wallet now
ikr?
im just glad i own a bunch of super sentai DVDs
damn u western region for not liking certain shows as much as i do
<:AquaCry:472690243720577053>
so many shows i want to own physically but never will
rippu
~~theres no way to physically own Precure in the west right?~~
ah the one right after suite. man they took their sweet time bringing over a precure to the west lol
which precure was adapted into... Glitter force? *shudders*
going from happiness charge to go princess. that no surprise lol
<:homucide:572977615367962634>
~~if only the west treated their shows related to kids as not boring fart joke drivel~~
reason i watched suite was cause the designs were less kiddy like compared to previous seasons
i can see that
precure always seemed like an even girlier version of sailor moon to me. definitely geared towards the female audience while sailormoon had both male and female fans
noice i watched one of the better ones.
Suite PreCure was the one i watched btw
i have watched some precure in the past. nothing super recent tho
highschool DxD getting a season 5 is mind boggling to me. of all things why does that have 5 seasons? lmao
<:AquaCry:472690243720577053>
those are also kinda old tho blade
<:nanamiwow:568912962836758548>
WAIT <@455790470119817217> u in the SAO rising steel server. you play?
as someone who doesnt watch any dubs. ill take your word for it
~~16 times the bills paid~~
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
why do we have to grow up. i hate paying bills and have no sense of wonder anymore
i'd still watch subbed over dubbed but it was definitely above average dubbing
Konosuba dubbed was actually pretty decent.
~~what happened to those great sometimes chessy dubs of the 90s?~~
i agree it had a very different feel
i wish we could get the OG series looking as good as Clear card with no changes to how the story was done
<:pog:522650185390620693>
for an elementary school kid. she does a sick kick flip
i was so enamored with this as a kid
<@455790470119817217>
https://youtu.be/HdteZ3iOa3c?t=311
rip millhi xD
at the time
i loved the magic and wonder cardcaptors had back then. there was nothing like it
i also only remember like the first dozen or two episodes tho
not that i remember
i would assume around 120-150 bucks
i thought it was good. a lot of stuff got cut for the american release but was there for the canadian release so u could watch it MOSTLY as intended. minus the possible gay relationships in it
OG dubs Sakura made that show for me
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
~~no rush but if u do ever check. let me know~~
now i dont want it
ughhh
which dub does it use?
you do??
i miss that show from my childhood
Man, i seriously need cardcaptors blu ray
some goodies here. Kimi ni todoke, toradora, cardcaptors
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
i forgot Nisa sells anime
~~thats all i know~~
<:karingenki:585560135099744299>
ichigo means strawberry
i am now out of my depths when it comes to anime lol
My favorite girl is Ai
I find her story kinda boring
I didn't like the wavey haired girl.
No I actually liked her
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<@83626774000308224> I loved most of the girls for amagami
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
~~i could watch it every year~~
<:doge:496780220309962772>
Lol
She's from is the order a rabbit
<:doge:496780220309962772>

<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<@83626774000308224> please do yourself a favor and watch the dub of yuyu
~~i want the blu rays of gaogaigar so badly~~
from gaogaigar
not goona lie. hiei image does not look like a Guys voice should come out of it
really hiei?
i know Gaogaigar
who does he voice in yuyu?
ive looked into it
gintama just doesnt look like my wheelhouse of anime.
i have no idea who that is
~~except maybe a miyazaki movie which i feel like isnt fair~~
i would not rate any dub higher than it in my lifetime of anime ive watched
its literally the best true
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
im sure i have blu rays of shows that have a dub on it. but why bother when i can just watch the better sub
likewise blade. i cant think of anything outside of that xD
i doubt anything will ever top it
~~i still consider Yu yu hakusho the best dub to date~~
we are talking more about recent dubs
Millhi can't die! We have so much anime to tAlk about still!
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Also my child self was crushing on green haired waofu from that game.
<:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
E17 had some amazing plot twists too
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Harem ends are always the best ends in VNs
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
~~Ever17 is one of my top VNs ever~~
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<@279341087494242304> bruh I'll be with ya
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Anyone remember toheart2? That's like textbook definition of how not to adapt a VN
I wish older animes did omnibus formats
The omnibus format helped it a lot imo
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I also really liked photokano like amagami
One of the only animes with full on sex on screen
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
That was a thing
<:Viking:620333946638434307>
Yosuga no Sora...
Haruka is a close second
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
With the 2010s era of anime ending. I think it was one of the best eras of anime to date.
She seriously has the best parents
It was so beautiful
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Me tooo!
Rightstuf black Friday starts tomorrow
I liked the lavender haired girl
Hyoubu is fantastic
The OG cast plays very little into the unlimited.
I happened upon a psychic squad DVD in an fye. Lol
I didn't even know it was based off of something until many months later
It's definitely made in a way for people who never watched the original to start here
I watched unlimited first
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Where season 2

It's like a completely different manga

Main char now
Main char bottom left corner
I could maybe watch one or two episodes at atome
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Watching the og show was really hard for me
<:MikuPanic:640289659452129310>
Zettai Karen children the unlimited season 2 when
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Starts out looking like gantz. But then turns into an amazing art style
That manga is one I love to Refrence for art style change
I knew I could count on millhi
Oh anyone ever read the manhwa The breaker?
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
I haven't read a book in years
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
Hey millhi can u tell rightstuf to have crazy sales like Sentai plz and thanku
Which show
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I stopped buying LEs a long time ago. My brain realized. I could buy more standard edition Blu rays if I do
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
That looks like my sentai filmworks order from last BF
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I missed the ideon sale for 10 bucks
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
<:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
Whoops I laid in bed for three hours instead

About to dump a lot of money on Gundam plastic this weekend
I already did. I just want to own them
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I want these so much

It's so fucking quality man
<a:catsquee:618536628838989824>
<:pokeblush:526120735132090372>
<@98541382393688064> and what did u think?
season 2 when
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
without spoilers. how was it?
<@99695384296701952> so konosuba esque?
Sometimes it's smilling thru the pain of a good dead anime
Sometimes it's smug. Sometimes it's genuine. Sometimes it's sarcastic
I can never tell with that black and white smile
<:SelkaWaaa:645928596912996372>
What's wrong with flip flappers millhi?
<:Yuuki_Derp:645930348181454848>
So many things to watch..
I was flip flopping between girls last tour, made in abyss and houseki. Which would also probably be considered the top 3 of these
<@152896851660505088>
Everything but negima I've never watched before
What should I watch first..
<:pokeblush:526120735132090372>
My anime comes in today
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
<@99695384296701952> is there actually gay bears in this anime?
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
It'll sell ~~a dozen copies~~ millions!
Yo I wanna make this anime where the two main chars have to hold hands all the time. Or the heroines dies.
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Some animes I just question how they get greenlit u know?
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
<@279341087494242304>
Out of all the anime I've ever seen. This was definitely one of them.
The funniest way I've seen someone describe an anime they didn't like. Example was that awful Yu-No anime this year. It was
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Mawarupenguindrum was... A show I watched
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Girls last tour I have no clue what's going on . And that fight over rations was so tense so fast
Made in abyss looks quite interesting and omimous.
I don't even know what I watched there
Houseki no kuni was also a wild first episode
<@152896851660505088> flipflappers definitely sucker punched me. Such a trip of a first episode
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
So I watched the first episode of all my new animes. I have so many questions
My bad
Oh overlooked meluas second statement and only saw the one super robot comment
<:Viking:620333946638434307>
Or Quanta attempting to cut a planet in half
~~trans am riser being able to quantum jump and having a beam attack the size of a skyscraper is kinda crazy~~
I feel like some of the 00 units and Barbatos get to super levels
<@145705908716961792>
Ascendence of a bookworm
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
The moment when u learn an anime u thought was going to be 12 episodes is actually going to be 24
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
<@279341087494242304> this concerns me greatly

<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Explain yourself
<@279341087494242304> literally the first picture on Google
This is why I have trust issues
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
U telling me this cute anime girl cover with bears in it has people getting eaten?
<:Viking:620333946638434307>
That episode was hype af too. I took a break from watch the anime after that match
<:YuukiSip:645903478060875776>
Yessir
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
They sometimes even have awful dubs
Yes
not when silly

my last years BF haul took a  couple weeks. <@!99695384296701952>
what did u order melua?
rip. mine was extra fast. i was surprised.
im running out of shows to buy from them.
Sentai Filmworks holiday started

<:pokeblush:526120735132090372>
I'm so happy you are current season with me  <@98541382393688064>
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
What do u mean split?
at least the two waifu options
i personally didnt like the other classmates honestly lol
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i was the same as u up until the 150 dollars
just wondering if i was crazy for buying a physical version of a game i already 100%
im not looking for something new to play atm
<a:AYAYAJam:580749858529607690>
did every route
of course!
Like Yume Miru Kusuri, and Crescendo
no no, im buying ones ive already playted and enjoyed
i was really gunning for the Blonde warrior woman tho. she was cute af
yes but i didnt play it nearly as much as the first. i need to go back but man they need so much time to complete
yea ive played it. i never finished it tho. i got to the last map. looked at how much i had to do. and was like. nah im good xD
youre welcome 😄
tuesdays
is that the japanese title for spirit of the eternity sword?
<:sip:597321444761796609>
<@279341087494242304> talk VNs to me pls
week to week
i know. youre in it with me now
yay!
MY HUGS ARE WAY HUGGIER THAN YOUT HUGS. WATCH! *HUGS RANDOM BYSTANDER*
Lmao he totally would do that
~~we need a sleep emote~~
Anyways. Night man
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Well aren't u lucky
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Yay overtime Saturday work
I also must sleep for long day
Also I like how short red hair chick that eats all the rice. Is Chris
<:pokeblush:526120735132090372>
I was so happy
When the two older members of their society bumped and kicked mashima to encourage him
I love how this anime does such a good job about making us care about so many chars. When it was the best 8. I was hyped to watch every match
probably cause they had actual endings
VNs filled a niche that nothing else could fill
i played anything and everything i could get my hands on back in the day
likewise. looked it up. i dont recognize it
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
also <@279341087494242304> u get back here and talk about quality VNs dang it
im gonna check
i dont think ive every played another game by that company tho
i dont blame u
i also liked pink haired loli girl. i think i did her route first. and then sword chick second. never did the elf chicks route cause i found her boring af lol
one of my faves was that one evil devil woman. who wasnt really evil. she just played the roll of a fallen angel monster thing to be balance in the world of light and dark or something. im paraphrasing but it was really cool
but i loved the characters
it really was lol
yep!
i also really liked Kamidori, played thru that 3-4 times cause chars you could only get on subsequent playthrus
i bookmarked duel savior vndb so i never forget it again xD
but god i could not remember the name for the life of me
yea i never finished all the routes in it and wanted to replay it cause combat was actually fun
i could never freaking remember this game
thank u sorano
andit was duel savior
theres one i cant remember the title of
i feel like ive played a good portion of the unique ones? that actually had gameplay in them
<:sip:597321444761796609>
Can someone please port eternity sword 1 and 2 to switch so i can play them in handheld mode and actually finish them while watching youtube vids
me niehter
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~or agenius~~
i played the 18+ version. and only did the black spirit route. which i feel is kinda fitting since the waifu u pick also gets displaced from time and forgotten as well, and since she didnt really fit in to begin with. felt appropriate
too many routes. i can only imagine the time it would take to complete all of them
<:Viking:620333946638434307>
dark skin anime girls are my weakness
i waifu'd the black spirit chick from the enemy side
i got super bummed at Eien no aselia when ||everyone forgot who you were so it kinda felt like all the game you played up to that point was null and void||
I never played Clannad. Never appealed to me
Doesn't help a lot of them have untranslated titles
That's probably one of if not my most memorable VN I've ever played personally
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ever17 u say
can u give an example?
so i checked. only one other Eushelly game has been translated into english. no wonder i never knew of this company outside of kamidori lol
that sounds cool solopu
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
Which companies.
<:YuukiSip:645903478060875776>
I feel like there were way more VNs being translated a decade or so ago compared to now
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
I'm told there's more choice but I guess I'm not looking in the right places
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Cypher!
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
What I miss
I'm back
<@139432096023183360> ||as a non watcher. I thought he loved Emilia||
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
The movie is playing. It's not silent
Common courtesy and common sense. Just aren't common anymore. It's really sad
I didn't pay 8-10 bucks to hear your fucking child cry the whole movie
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
If u can't get a babysitter. Don't go out
It's like people who bring babies/children to movies that are not children related
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
I'm guessing a lot of these promare watchers aren't big movie goers and don't know movie etiquette
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I understand laughing at funny moments. But that's really all an audience should be making noise at imo. Unless it's a horror movie that makes u scream
Wow
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
<@115744398997716995> shouting qoutes? So does that mean people went to see it a second time and are basically annoying the people who came to see it for the first time?
whats there to participate in?
its a movie
audience participation?
<@!99695384296701952> whats cheer screenings?
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
Nah. Im sure you'll do me a solid and let me know when it pops
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
really?
WHAT
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Altered fable translation when
If I could survive without a job. I would sorano lol
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
U don't? Lucky u. I wish I didn't have a job
<:doge:496780220309962772>
It's all I did after school some days
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Muv luv spoiler ||this VN was where I learned what true dis pear was||
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I played Saya no uta on my psp. Cause someone made it work there
like bro. what u guys doing
<:knucklespeepers:553093971090472980>
shows that unironically make a recap episode in a 12 episode show. AND/OR make a 1-3 fanservice fluff episodes THEN rush the ending of the show. make me so mad
Roger that. I feel like they'd make lots of jokes within
<@139432096023183360>yes but I only watch when my bro is around. He is at school for his finals so I'll have two episodes to watch when on Thursday when he gets home
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
My bro comes home tomorroe. We gotta catch up on two weeks of anime. Since we couldn't watch any last week cause of our schedule
Watching anime bd rips is nice (or the actual bds)
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Two free episdoes
They probably snuck in an extra episode and a half of content in 12 episodes
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Half the episodes ran into the Ed too.
I think they only ever played the opening 3 times? And just used that time for actual anime time
I liked that about Astra lost in space
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm sure they'll do it poorly. Like when sunrise cut up the 1hrish episodes of Gundam unicorn into tv episode size to show on television. Cutting at random spots
That's fair. I just know the show thru second hand talking
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
||I was under the impression he rejected rems love for Emilia||
Oh
Be
Some of my favorite Mecha fights are in this show cause of how unique they can me
Kinda sorta? Like at first is a little meh. The fights are cool but everything outside was boring to me. But like Midwayish? Something clicked while they were making episodes and it gets really amazing on the back half.
<@87512939107450880> Majestic Prince
It's funny. I thought of the organization MJP in majestic prince before the actual show.  <@99695384296701952> yea it's tight. I think it's the best cg Mecha out there with it's crazy choreography
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I only heard Ara ara
of course. i had to make sure it worked myself first
<:sip:597321444761796609>
in there?
Do i post the original gif i used?
oh sure <@!99695384296701952> i didnt know we had a spot to do that. thank you
<:lewd:655460272596713503>
Ive finally made it into the big leagues
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
My first emote taken for use by another
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I'm sorry.
I made an emote of her
<@193232244867858432> pinging u for Miku stuff
<a:mikufastdance:655472248144003114>
<:KannaSip:480753608045101076>
I know I did.
Probably not. I'd assume the average viewer who hasn't watched it would just see the anime as a guy with the ability to turn into a woman.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm on my period. I'm gonna be a guy and ride out the week
Oh interesting.
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
What happens if u became pregnant as a girl and reverted to a guy tho
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
I mean u get the benefit of both genders. Sounds fun to me.
<:YuukiSip:645903478060875776>
If only that curse was real
Such a unique lifestyle. Cursed to have water temperature turn you into the opposite gender or revert back to your original one
Since lio hasn't seen it. I don't want to discuss spoliers
Where would they even go for gridman
I'm happy
The one emote that came out looking quite quality honestly
<a:Gundam_punch:654528572572303360>
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
<@279341087494242304> did u see the Gundam emote I made?
I never got on the franxx bandwagon cause mechas piloted in doggy position was an instant nope for a Mecha fan like me.
I agree lol
<@264373970118246400> it's 37.99 together. Not a piece
Darling in the franxx both half on sale for 37.99 at Funimation site of anyone is interested
Ascendence of a bookworm at 7.49 and oresuki at 7.8 is acceptable. I feel like bookworm could be a little higher. It's just so wholesome and cute. But also very spice and wolfish
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Chihayafuru is amazing. China sucks
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>
<@189146272865845248> the main character is Nana mizuki
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I actually liked cross ange
Oh I agree
Reminds me of Cross Ange in way. It's beginning is so far off from how it ended.
Soul crushing disappointment?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
If I had a nickel for every time an anime had a sour ending
I've heard two versions of franxxx. The one sub just mentioned and the other was. It was boring from the beginning with a lot of sitting and talking, but the Mecha action was decent at least
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Didn't one dude die. And the little girl piloting the sword joined the main duo cause of it?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I couldn't even if I tried
I liked China having the Gundam lol
Godannar was just dumb fun too
I remember the couple sitting in the same seat but I don't remember much past that. Been so long
Basically
<@99695384296701952> okay by doggy style I mean there's a guy banging a girl doggy style in a mecha
Like what?
Rip
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@189146272865845248> Sentai filmworks sale has a ton of anime for 10 bucks or less
*snaps ball*
STEAK
or insurance
OMAHA
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i have the same issue with Scott the Woz. always starts the vid with Hey Y'all, scott here.
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Aria is a villian
<:doge:496780220309962772>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Hey I recognize that voice! It's tuturu girl from steins gate
Yea I do that yoo
At least they can sub correctly
<:Viking:620333946638434307>
It was sentai filmworks so I assume the dub was average to mediocre like all their dubs
Gotoubon is the only for sure thing. My bro liked that way more than I was expecting
After this amazing season. I'm not sure  what I'd even be interested in next season
<a:GarieGrin:658109831881818115>
Everything else
Lmao. I forgot about that
<:Hehe:654528334394556426>
~~as a second watch~~
The dub is definitely decent.
U don't get the wonderful Exploooooosion
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
Dubbed?
<@266379640069685252> everyone has some sort of brain damage in it lol.
I believe it
When splicing these episodes together
Oh cool. I wonder how they'll do cliffhanger episodes if they're the first of two episodes
Oh I thought it was a 12er
And itll be just half a season long of episodes basically
Or do they mean one hour time slot
So if re zero is gonna be cut into hour long episodes and a normal episode is like 20 mins. Will it only be 4 episodes long? (Maybe 5 with the extra stuff they add in)
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Have never heard of those climb show before. And dope season two of promised Neverland. Nice to see things I like get a second season for once
U either like the comedy. Or it's boring as fuck and none of the jokes land
Lucky star is either a love or hate it anime
That shit was the worst
~~my worst anime I've ever seen was Yu-NO anime adaptation~~
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
I think k-on was my tipping point to changing my taste. Stopped watching school slice of lifes
Yea I had bad taste when I was young.
~~and it's totally not cause my favorite girl ended up being the one he picked~~
I think shuffle was one of the only ones I enjoyed in anime form back in the day
<:YuukiSip:645903478060875776>
I remember that anime. Tripped me out cause actual sex happened on screen
~~we all spoke the same language until the curse of balal~~
It's hayate
~~Rip aria playing the guessing game~~
<@189146272865845248> can u guess which one. Missing of these three
Hmmm... Do I drop 50 bucks to finish up my Nanoha trio to get the one I'm missing
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
It's a manhwa. Really good.
Read the breaker
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
~~so a self insert power fantasy by reki kawahara. Shocker~~
But man. He's just... So unappealing to look at
The protagonists looks don't usually turn me off to an anime.
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I didn't think u were to begin with. I'm just stating one of the reasons I don't watch anime
Oh I c
What does that mean
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
Am I under arrest?
<:CarolBlush:617039657896509460>
I'm just shallow. And If I don't like how the main char looks. I won't watch it
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I never tried it cause the main char is a short pig man who looks like he doesn't belong in that anime
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
People who have the same opinions and only want to hear what they think
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
NO I NEED AN ECHO CHAMBER OF THINGS I LIKE
True
I feel bad cause none of the comedy in episode one of that anime keupho said was funny to me
Hinamatsuri is probably my favorite comedy of recent memory
Never seen it. Outside of it's Blu Ray case on sale
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Like most Japanese comedy
Nothing to back that up tho
Atm yes. But I heard it's a split two cour like how golden Kamui or kono oto tomare was
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Hontonokotosa
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
That ain't an anime!
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Yes yes it was
News girl 5th and food girl is dead last
Himawari is third. Pansy is fourth
Followed be cosmos
Sasanqua is my favorite
Also is it bad that I like basically every other girl that isn't pansy more than pansy?
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>
There better be a season 2 of Oresuki.
That precure protag better like punching things
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But I Kno that won't happen tomorrow. So I didn't eat yesterday to offset it
I'm trying to eat better
I am crazy yes
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I started fasting.
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I can sometimes write things poorly. So in used to explaining my thought process
It's all good
I called her blonde cause I don't know her name
I'm saying from the manga panel to the anime she looks good
I like the blonde. She transitioned well to anime
<:doge:496780220309962772>
Tet expects u to make your own fun in his world he made..just like todd
~~ngnl is just fallout 76~~
<:doge:496780220309962772>
Unlike Skyrim itself
It's a nice touch lol
<:YuukiSip:645903478060875776>
Don't feel bad for Dola. She's a steph
When is 2nd cour
Wait
Woo
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Yea but if it's two separate seasons I'll probably have to pay more to own it
Definitions are strangw
Yes I heard about that too. But I also heard it's a 2nd cour of season one. Just happening later. Not sure which was right.
<a:Suika:654524406109962245>
So I've been told
I'm sad it's about to end in an episode
Uh.. what? The temple just got introduced the episode before the last.
Or when healer chick got stuck in a wall
<:doge:496780220309962772>
My favorite gags were the ones where she used her speed to get up in people's faces
I'm not a fan of them personallu
Oof
Oh now in curious on the amount of stuff that was anime only
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
That would've been cool. I dunno. I guess I'm just bugged the last two episodes were heavy with refrences to other shows instead of trying to be funny
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
And I'm just sitting here thinking. Couldn't think of your own move to end the show on huh?
<@90164247643828224> it was funny to see but then she did a spirit bomb Kamehameha
The bookworms grow
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
So when does an anime cross the line of parody and just go into plagarism. Average abilities literally had the main char in the final battle using spirit gun.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That was a thing that happened
It's also a strange amount. I'm happy with what I'll take tho
So 16
It's 14 episodes with two ovas in March apparently
Welcome to the crew!
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
If u go by those movies
Also makes ZZ noncanon
<@99695384296701952> it's just using a crying emote. Not that it died at franxx
I haven't watched but it's so true
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>

<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
S rank u mean
The girls are great but god he's so stupid.
The main char is the biggest downer for the show for me tho
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Nino and Miku are the best
I heard quintuplets
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Also this isn't the adachi I know
Has a lot of well defined lines
I like the artstyle at least
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
Inb4 they make all the inner monologues outer monologued like the promised neverland
And yes it's a slow burn. But god I love the world building
What's adashima?
Except I won't drop the second cour after one episode cause all the momentum was lost
Yea they're pulling a golden Kamui
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812> <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812> <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i should buy code geass to show me bro.... i wanna watch the akito ovas and the new movie
~~and then they fucked it up~~
at least gundam build fighters reignited the sales of gunpla. the main reason gundam was made lol
merchandising*
mechandising man
it is lol
~~tv wise not movie/ova wise~~
man finally watching the video... i only now realize how weak this decade is for mecha fans.
for me
i guess there was just more pros than cons. i loved going back and forth between seed and MSV lines bringing in units and upgrades i earned.
I just wish it came out after destiny ended
<:Viking:620333946638434307>
I actually love the non SD one
At least one G generation game that's Gundam seed
Like two ~~or 3~~ Gundam Vs games that are just Gundam seed
<@264373970118246400> there's more JP only ones
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
What about gpo3?
Gundam battle Assault 3 featuring Gundam seed. Full title btw
Yea a lot of Gundam games will get a featuring Gundam seed and be like 80% Gundam seed
Also why does Japan love Gundam seed so much. Not saying it's a bad show but they like it way too much for the quality it gave us
They need 2.0 kits
Like seriously they old as fuck
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
~~wheres my new GP series model kits bandai~~
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Oh wait 3 was celshaded. This was more like 2 in graphics
<@622605930147610654> it's called Gundam musou reborn. In english
That's it I think?
Gundam unicorn got a few more units
Uhh...
Blegh
But it was also a shit ton of Gundam seed added in
It was cell shaded models. So the mechs looked cool at least
Yes it's called shin Gundam musou. It was digital only in the west. Added in all of Gundam seed
Never touched the 4th one
Same
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I love the original mode in one.
Gundam musou one and two are so good
I wish my PS2 could hook up to my tv. I would love to play it again
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I was really confused why a lot of people had like 3 missions. ~~cause they died~~
Gundam Vs Zeta Gundam was my first forray into zeta gundam as a kid
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
The movies are considered a different happier universe
At one point I honestly thought ||Orga|| was actually going to live cause he had so fucking many death flags from the entire run of the show that I thought they would bait us and not do it.
Like if u gonna kill someone. Don't set up such obvious death flags
Also ||fat dude|| I feel like had the most pointless. U could see it from a mile away deaths
Then kills basically everyone
For me personally midway thru season 2 I feel like they were thinking. Oh hey we haven't really murdered anyone in awhile. We should get on thay
Fuck that guy so much lol
Okay yea same guy
Was lok the guy who got ||bisected|| at the end?
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
But it spends way too much time in space. And is boring
It does have some good points. Like the ground battles are hype as fuck
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Also the princess who looks like she will do things, never does
~~wheres the Isekai trash light novels that are also Mecha shows~~
Divers and try killed me joy
Likewise
But rip anything new
I'm glad I'm a Gundam fan at least to enjoy the OVAs and movies
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
It was translated myne in the first episode. Then in the second when she spelled it. It looked like Main in a way and I guess they rolled with it?
Oh wait. Does build fighters count? Cause I pick that one then.
This ain't our first rodeo xD
Yes we know fire lol
I honestly don't know what singular Gundam anime I would pick as the best Gundam show. Only cause I feel like a lot of the early UC shows kinda need each other
~~gundam age had beams that spin tho~~
It's the best AU at least
Of course
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
If it was kudelia. Then she would've actually contributed to the plot of S2 at all
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
And it wasn't even with kudelai
Also I feel like the mikazuki kid thing was very forced? I dunno if that was just me
Gimme a prequel pls bandai
Me too millhi
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Good old Gundam sexism
Then she's stuck cooking and making a possible baby on the sidelines
S2 forgot about kudelia at all
I feel like pink gundam really got the shaft. Didn't get any cool moments
We talking about the pink gundam dude?
So they salvaged the eins graze into the kimaris
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
He was? Shit I thought he was just using his kimaris
I thought he died in the s1 finale
I legit don't remember that
Used him again in S2?  <@152896851660505088>when did that happen?
Yea
The dude who got turned into a mech
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Eins was super fucked up tho. I expected him to be the trope of bad guy turned good
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Honestly most of the show is a blur to me now
Was it? Cause I feel like it wasnt
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
for my custom char
one of the voice options for gundam Cross rays is Maria. i picked it obviously
rip cypher
stardust memory had the best opening songs man
NEIN
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I don't care for u
But it just had a HOEEEEEEEEEE season
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's like sailor moon but if in a wedding dress
Wedding peach  <@122219992358846468>
At least one that Got an anime
I don't think anything predates it when it comes to someone controlling a little toy/action figure
99 for manga 01 for anime
Angelic later is pretty old
Shit Stan beat me to it
~~they ripped off angelic layer~~
U didn't miss much
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Only OG fighters
Of course. I only mentioned dbuild fighters. I didn't mention try or divers
Oh wait. LBX
~~its beyblade before gundam~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I heard rem is best girl
I can't wait to finally watch rezero for the first time to see  they love and hate it gets
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
They could've had episode one be a recap episode
It's so big in the g generation game. Takes up 9 spaces
<:doge:496780220309962772>
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
I need to give it another shot. I watched the first episode of season one and was eh about it
U know what. I think this was the uniform those two chicks in the Gundam waltz movie wore
I mean igundam anime
By game
Okay in probably forgetting. But which uniform is this game from?

Sadly we won't get that here
endedup going withthe OG songs cause theyll all be replaced by other chars eventually anyways
i was also thinking of Counterattack. cause its with the trinity trio and i'll never use them
hmm... do i give her Final mission quanta music
actually my pilot has a 00 outfit on. might as well pick a song from that
yea its not there.
i feel like his game is missinig a lot of tracks tho. cause dont most games have the opening BGMs as options?
its like my brains subconsious knew
its funny i was thinking of pairing her with IBO music
rip
yeap
my favorite character in IBO
oh the one killed in cold blood?
oh who was she?
I feel like she could be reigned in if u tried
She's acceptable(?) Yandere
Only other big yandere I can think of is school days
I'm sure my bro will like all the death.
Big oof
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Dies
Subaru does?
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Subaru can time travel?
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Wait rem dies?
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
I never hear anything about ram tho
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Hopefully he dies or is barely on screen
Also I hated the teacher and how he spoke
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Outside of that. It was just so dull and slow
I was just bored. I got to episode 6 or so? And the only entertaining moments for me were when the konosuba gang was up to hijinks. Or that one bench scene where ains and Tanya got to reminsce about the past
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
God Isekai quartet. I wish that was better
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
Double episodes here I come
Oh boy. I get to watch re zero for the first time tomorrow
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~hey your boobs are 10cm bigger than mine. So I'm gonna need u to back up that much to race~~
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
~~outside of haruhi. None of the animes mentioned here I've finished. Dropped all at some point~~
<:doge:496780220309962772>
Ah that one. I get all my highschool animes mixed around.
That's the super lewd highschool comedy right?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Honestly a lot of animes that are around the haruhi/LS era of anime. I don't think I could rewatch. It's a more simpler... Slower... Paced era for me
Not saying ls is trash
~~why can't more animes try to salvage the trash~~
I didn't know they changed directors. Was he doing that bad?
First episode is definitely make or break for the show
I've watched a bunch of dubs. Nothing recent but back on the day. Dubs were dopr
Mikuru sounds almost exactly the same on Japan and dub. It was trippy af
~~i watched haruhi dubbed~~
Haruhi did have charisma. I agree
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Or they can be a crybaby forever like shinji or the dude in that yandere anime
<a:xd:656479183551332352>
I would kill to watch mineta die
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
God that never happens tho. If only
Is rista the goddess?
I mean I hate shows that make purposely annoying characters for the sake of annoying the people in the show and u.
Makes it hard to watch more than one episode at a time
I just hate the main character. The goddess is great and a ton of the side characters are funny but he's just... Insufferable
Yea
I'm at like episode 8 or something
I still need to finish yuusha
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
It's like.. HEY REMEMBER THESE BETTER ANIMES?
It was the dumb things like multiple references to big shounen stuff like dbz yuyu etc.
That I actually liked
It had its own fair share of good humor itself. Which made me question why it had to reference other things so much
I personally hated all the references to other animes. Never been a fan of referencial humor
I liked that little moment of seriousness personally. My favorite episode was that super dark past to flame mage girl
Ohh
Heikin?
Iruma kun is also one of my favorites of this last season. Probay top 5
Like what? Lol
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Does iruma feel like an anime from the 2000s? I feel like it feels very... Anime? It's hard to describe
She so cute.
Is eiko the poor demon who can never talk to iruma?
~~also are they ever going to do anything with glasses girl? She seems to not like iruma for some reason~~
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
But man. I really just wanted Ameri to join the crew
I'm hoping it'll pick back up now that they also joined.
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
It didn't help that Clara and asmodeus were absent the whole episode for one of the two
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
Club guy is just iruma but a demon
I wanted more Ameri time. She's fun and adorable
Yes
The most recent two. With the introduction of the most boring and uniteresting character
Marimashita! Iruma-kun
You ever have an anime u really like and then midway... It has like two pretty poopy episodes in a row. And then u kinda just don't give a crap about the show anymore? I have an anime like that right now and I don't know if it'll get better or if this is how it'll be now
Yea she definitely got boned in the anime
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Just like mondaiji
<a:xd:656479183551332352>
Milim interacting with konosuba gang would be fun
I am curious to see Isekai quintet. I'm sad they didn't make it Isekai Sextet and added slime in there
I have to go to bed good peeps. Have a great night and new year
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Why do u think the brought back so many dead chars in destiny instead of making new ones
So melua
The safety is on
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
~~draws on everyone's sleeping face~~
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
I have awoken!
<a:xd:656479183551332352>
I do like the archangel
<a:xd:656479183551332352>
No but the fights are dope as shit
~~i think GBF accomplished more in 24 episode~~
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
It blows my mind that seed/destiny had 100 episodes and I feel like it accomplished less than the average 50 episode show.
Yea its yuck lol
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Why is it even called strike freedom? I see nothing of the strike Gundam in it
Also I personally prefer normal freedom
Yea I could see that too
No I'm just saying strike freedom hadn't made them money yet
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Kira died in the freedom
But the strike freedom didn't exist yet at the time so it wasn't funding them yet lol
In destiny when shinn kills him
I have heard that rumor that the directors wife liked Kira so he stopped him from dying and having athrun become the main char
<@87512939107450880> I kinda like it. It's so weird lol
<@139432096023183360> never seen a shut in who works out lol
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Also I wasn't expecting the main character to be so strong physically. When he decked those guys and got a hit on that lady i was so proud of him
Is season 2 gonna be 24 episodes too?
Lol it okay
Me and bro are hypes
<a:xd:656479183551332352>
Also I watched the first episode of rezero.
AOTS. Enjoy man
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh boy. More shapes I can't read
No man's land territory
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I was busy with Christmas. Watched it this weds
Easily the best show this season
<a:xd:656479183551332352> <a:xd:656479183551332352> <a:xd:656479183551332352>
THAT FINALE FOR BOOKWORM WAS HYPE AS FUCK YO
Outside of godannar and orphen. I've never watched any of theae
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Okay let me screen cap my cart
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Know everything pls
<@99695384296701952> you watch a lot of anime. If I posted a small list of shows in thinking of buying. Would u say yay or nay to the quality of them? You have a good opinion when it comes to shows
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
Man I was so hyped for that show. Only to learn the anime season 1 was the best part of the story
<:doge:496780220309962772>
Well I'm glad I skipped season 2 then
Gotcha gotcha
Is that season 2 or 3?
Last big things I remember was the hairy Titan. The one chick being a small ugly Titan in their squad... And Eren almost being executed
Interesting. I wonder how far away it was from where I stopped. I never saw what was in Erin's basement
There was a time skip?
Like wut
I stopped around the time Erin has a magicability to control other Titans
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I read the manga after s1 ended. I thought it got so much worse
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
If only it wasn't all flash and no substance
Yea it's on the simple side but I don't minde that
Every interaction was good. All the characters are great, I enjoy how 95% of the show is from mynes perspective so u really don't have any extra info that she wouldnt have
For me personally I can't think of a single negative for the show atm
Spoilers
~~actually I think I started episode 3~~
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Hey I was also an avid episode oner
~~teach me~~
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
~~dont actually become blind tho. Can't read subs then~~
U can be blind like me!
Woo
Im so glad benno didn't end up being a dickbag.
I love all the chars too
I don't think there was a single episode or hell even a single scene I didn't like
<a:xd:656479183551332352>
Easily cemented it as the best anime this season for me
Dude last episode holy crap
I forgot the spoiler for bookworm already so we good
~~sale for symphogear please?~~
May 29th apparently?  <@468591607332208641>

<@139432096023183360> u never commented
I literally can't find the opening to the first anime on my list
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Gimme money to
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
~~i should determine the quality of each of these animes by their opening on YouTube right now~~
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Doesn't it have two movies?
<:doge:496780220309962772>
Do any of these?
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Best nobunaga anime period
Yes cypher?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Does rail wars have railing in it
These are all 10 and under in price and I wanted to narrow this down a bit lol
I liked that one
Oh and oda
Myne was the only one that changed from e1 to 2
I don't think so
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Did bookworm fine outside of fucking up her name
It's how I've done anime for years. Never really had a problem unless it was. A Netflix show like beastars
I just use horrible subs for everything
I need a new one
<@256945399338631168>  that stopped getting seasons
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
We are talking about animes
We aren't talking about the VN
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I'd watch an Isekai about a whole nation or town getting isekai'd
~~all of Japan got isekai'd~~
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
So Japan isn't apart of the globe now?
<@87512939107450880> why is Sao on their twice? I call shenanigans
But sure. Make him a douche in the anime
Making sure she heals
In the book he carefully puts it on her cause she's like literally in half almost lol
Yea I have a friend who shows me book parts and the anime looks so bad in comparison. Like the part where ottarl just throws a healing potion on samurai girl after she fell off
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
She's gonna be very confused during her first time.
But then she's actually not a prostitute so what was the point
I did like the whole should a hero save a prostitute debate. I really enjoyed that.
Animated*
There was literally one good anime fight. And that was it
Like damn
S2 danmachi sucked so bad man
Chihayafuru.. oh wait that's S3
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
*looks at season 2 of log horizon* I have trust issues

I'm the witch of sloth
Witch of envy does sound cool
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Was it supposed to be called jealous bitch?
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
~~even tho they can be bad too~~
If I want good subs I'll wait for Blu rays
<a:xd:656479183551332352>

<@139432096023183360> which ones
Yea man. Google aniplex anime Blu raysm their prices are crazy.  <@87512939107450880>
Better than 30 bucks for 2 episodes of Sao
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Re zero is the best new anime of this year
Hmm
Tv show or main Gundam char?
Tho I love the Zabanya and Harute designs
U didn't miss much. Just lots of flashyness
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I've never been on 4chan
Genocide?
Guess I'm a facsist
I love zeon and all its mech designs
URAKIIIII
GATOOUUUU
I specifically didn't pick Gundam build fighters cause I feel like that's cheating
Me too
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Everything is so old that I have very vague memories. I feel like a basic bitch saying unicorn but I feel like it was a good send off for the UC series. (And then they started making Hathaway's flash and NT)
I really don't know what I'd pick honestly
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
What if I don't think it's cool or tough. But also am not bothered by jokes about my race?
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>

I thought B was gonna stand for balloons
So I've heard
its weiiiiirrrddd
so watching the first episode of Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!
https://files.catbox.moe/5ecjju.mp4 randomly saw this. always trippy seeing a fairly obscure anime get refrenced like this
<@231025503643893770>  he did mention that there were a lot of Isekai he wanted to put on this list but didn't want the entire list to just be Isekai so he just picked the one he thought was the worst
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@231025503643893770>  mother's basement just posted his top  bad anime of 2019. Was a good watch. All the runtime I was thinking. Man cast is gonna have a field day

*looks at poster of zaku II I own*
<@145705908716961792> for season 1 silly
zombieland saga blu ray releases tomorrow!
Like most light novel titles
I actually am more interested in it now. The isekai that star females are way more appealing
Oh bofuri is a shield girl?
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Well I know what the AOTS for next season will be already
I can't wait for more bookworm in like a season or two
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Her inner shemha was amazing
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
I told uuuuu
That final episode was so hyped
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Yay
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
And did u like it?
<@264373970118246400>i was making a joke cause it's another Isekai with a shield
~~saltbae meme was amazing too~~
Slime was great fun. Easily my favorite Isekai atm.
What's the hook for this one?
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I didn't realize shield hero was getting a second season so fast
Wait
But then how will I know what pot of greed does
And I hate it
Like the Blu rays for the poems. The mention the syllables they look for like Ao Eo Aosu. Etc. But the CR sub literally translates the poems and says they're looking for ~~insert part of the translated poem~~
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
I buy Blu rays
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Season 3 has been so hard to keep up with cause they translate things differently
I think sentai subs are good. At least I never had an issue with them. Chihayafuru subs bug the shit out of me from the online ones
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Sony started going down the crapper when they moved their HQ to California. So I figured
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Is it California?
My brain hurts reading that
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
For once
Big oof
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That's not a sentence
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Can't get hurt if your enemies are dead
Exactly
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>

Zipperman
So of the 4 new shows ive watched. Shield Girl Online was my favorite.
just watched Shield Girl Online. was pretty funny
<@122219992358846468> is that zatch bell?
Some shows are slow burns and need that second or third episode to get into it's groove
I always go by the 3 ep rule unless I absolutely hate the first episode
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Millhi just reminded me how many more shows I still need to watch. As well as the unreleased ones
I guess I missed the glow
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Like what did he see on her?
Reinhardt confused me at the end of episode 2
<@122219992358846468><:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Why all the mature attractive ladies in animes evil or dead
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
Elsa was so hot but so crazy too
~~also re zero has been awesome~~
I believe in u aria
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Get to it
Mine was drop was anime I can't spell with drawings that come to life. Meh was orphen, potential was pet and shield girl was great
<@122219992358846468> did u watch the 4 shows I did? Cause that's how I was lol
I thought hibiki dad was worst dad
~~i was guessing wrong on purpose~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Who?
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
Sailor moon is getting a movie?
I'm an anime only boy. I couldn't go to manga
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
~~Hey u did great on season 2-3~~ get out
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
4th started off slow. But it got really good when the villians of the season started showing up
Also didn't season 3 start at around second semester? So he's only had one school semester to use his quirk?
I mean he does try to get it under control but fails. So he mitigates the damage by using fingers instead. It's not until he has an actual mentor that he figures out a different way to fight
Deku probably thought that was the only way it worked
All might never really mentions that you don't HAVE to go all or nothing
Well when you only know all might for doing big smashes. Of course you're going to be single minded and only think that too. Until he got advice from Gran Torino to think outside the box.  He emulates his fight style 100% off of all might who has never used his legs in a fight.
<:MikuDualWield:664253338908360745>
~~I love the opening that lets me stab your liver~~
It was like they had a list and checked off everything from other better shows to put into theirs
Infinite dendrogram was so generic it hurt.
I was worried with all the idol and animal shows that I would have nothing to watch but I've found a few gems
Murenase! Seton Gakuen was way funnier than I expected. Super happy with it.
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
Also the little girl is voiced by Hestia from danmachi and she's perfect
Somali to Mori no kamisama looks to be the feel good anime of this season. It's like reverse demon Loli anime of a couple seasons ago but way better
It's super cute and I look forward to more of that
I love how Hanako-san is animated
Shield girl is still my favorite. But
So watched a few more seasonal animes
<@152896851660505088>  have u seen any of these?
I've got. The boy and the beast. Miss Hokusai. And in this corner of the world
Cause they were on sale
Let's see. I found some movies on my shelf I never watched yet
Watched a PV of maquia. This looks good af

Wait Nanoha had two movies in 2018
Since everyone knows dbz
I was debating that actually sorano xD
IDC if it's mainstream if it'sa good movie
Basically anything that released after your name
Yea I have your name
Have there been any really good stand alone anime movies out the past few years? I wanted to watch one or two today with friends but I didn't want it attached to a tv show they haven't watched
Hey millhi u might know
Noice
.hack, Gundam, sailor moon, ruroni Kenshin etc.
Anything on toonami was my childhood
Looks like a decent kids show
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Maybe the later volumes of nekopara made him get tired of it
Did he like it and now hate it?
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
~~at least he has a wife~~
Raid shadow legends?
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
No. Should I?
<:Quinella:664424079456993280>
Doesn't stop me from playing the games
I also love shitting on Sao.
Elfnein plays a koalagirl in an anime this season
Random change
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
U fool. Gokaiger guy was actually gai all along
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
U making fun of my spelling
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
It's like if I got to be one
Him being a ranger fan and becoming one. Was great
Guy was my favorite ranger.
Nope. Just the OG trio
The cast didn't enthrall me like Gokaiger. I'm sorry
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
And I was not a fan after a couple of episodes
I tried the one right after it
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
<@202444817043685386> I was disappointed that not all sentai were as dope
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
Gokaiger was my first Sentai. It was the best and I want it physically
Gokaiger was the first or second sentai to be HD
That's cause they were all SD
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>
I'm waiting for shout factory to release Blu Ray Gokaiger. Is they do DVD only. I'm gonna riot
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
<@202444817043685386>they do
They're shit is 200 bucks for anime
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Then u will never own it
Unless it's owned by aniplex
<@264373970118246400> wait for black friday
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
Black Friday sales help me support the anime industry
Yea seriously animal school has tought me a couple things about animals I really didn't want to know
Well I liked episode one and episode two was just as enjoyable to me. Maybe more so with the three new chars it introduces
Koalanein is also pretty adorable. And unexpectedly stacked for her height
Sloth girl is best girl. So fucking cute
Second episode of animal school was great
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Just watched Darwin's game. Way more murdery than I expected.
~~i dropped that anime mid season 2~~
<@202444817043685386> it's amazing. And stupid and funny
Yes
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
But the main char befriends a lone wolf..
<@264373970118246400> is that the name? I had no idea lol
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Madoka .5
It's not a lot. But what's there is nice.
I just expected fansetvice garbage. But it actually had a halfway decent story with some very good fight scenes. And good character development
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Too bad it'll never get a season 2 and I really want one dang it
Killing bites was way better than I ever expected it to be
I must've missed the slow motion xD
I didn't think the cgi was bad. I've seen way better and way worse cgi.
Killing bites is the battle one with animal people
No
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Characters that look like they're gonna be important. Just getting nuked is fun
I watched episode 1 and 2 of Darwin's game. Was fun
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
I regret not buying it back then lol
~~im a potato so I'm okay with this image quality~~
Yea a figure that used to be 30-40 bucks a few years back. I saw selling for 80 bucks a month or so ago of Nanoha herself
I feel like Nanoha figures in general have had a spike in pricing lately
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Yes
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I have three battle forms. A at the beach one. And a bunny girl one
~~shes totally not the only character I have the most figures of irl~~
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Can I be a fate testerossa friend? She's my favorite
They have to 8x speed fastfoward to let her do anything lol
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I still say sloth girl is best girl. And I find it funny the main char is attracted to her the most of any animal girl cause she's just got basically nothing animalistic about her except her ungodly slow movement
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
It's funny. But man. Koalas and pandas are gross
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Shield Girl Online*
Watched more animes. Oof they were all trash
Ah. I skipped all the idol shows
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
What anime?
Like 5 of each
<@202536957685923841> and idol shows
It's airing this season
Yea
Nekopara was as slow and boring as I expected it to be in anime form
I was so confused at first lol
Why do they needed to even breath
I honestly thought  she was gonna jump in and just walk on the bottom
~~it bothers me hp and mp aren't connected to a stat like vitality or magic~~
Oh that makes sense
Like it devours someone. Gains a crystal. But then...?
Speaking of shields. Why did hers grow crystals at first? It never explained that
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
But dope shielder dude wasn't playing
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>
~~also why were people watching the event and not participating in the event~~
Probably lvl 100+ chars
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Also her hydra skill is crazy. Seems too op for a character to have. Imagine a whole squad having that
Carrying*
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Also I hope her friend gets a random ass op skill for constantly caring maple around
~~where did she get that op stun skill~~
I wonder if she has tons of skills that nobody else does cause she eats monsters
I wonder if it hurts to be devoured
I was dying when maple was just shield tap murdering people
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Watching the directors cut as my first time
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>
Episode 3 of re zero. What the fuck man. I wanna know who's killing subaru
Ikr?
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
I was wondering how we weren't on episode 6
That makes more sense now
Ohhh
3 50 min episodes are out. Roughly sits around episode 5 of OG apparently
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
I never watched the show so I'm watching it now
<:ShirabeCheer:661042424570708037>
It's been coming out
I assume with this next reset and 2nd death he will try other things
I realize I could never get in the mindset of being murdered many times/knowing I'm going to die again. But I feel like I would try analyzing what I did the first reset that could've possibly triggered the death flag.
I still sleep at night yes
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
I will stay as strong as my diet has been
~~waiting for the directors cut episodes of re zero is killing me. And I almost want to crack and watch the OG version~~
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I want more killing bites
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I'm neither of those things
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Hey if we can't see the trickery. Is that really an issue?
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
~~ufotable should teach studios how to make great animation on a budget~~
<:Germain:421434126856486912>

<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
<@256945399338631168> we are gonna get anime a decade  or two after violet that will still look worse than it
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
When watching a good anime means u bite a bullet
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>
Oh. I for some reason thought that was day one
<@139432096023183360>
Question for episode 3 directors cut of re zero. Did Beatrice actually remember Subaru? Or was that a translation error? I feel like talking to someone who remembers would help
~~isekai quartet wasn't that fun to begin with~~
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Inb4 she pulls a shield girl and eats the monsters
My comfy show atm is Golem daughter but I feel like that's gonna get intense real quick
Or evil and undead
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Or dead
<@256945399338631168> Japan just makes all hot mature women evil
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
~~guys why is everyone i like hot and evil~~
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
Drill Loli
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
~~elsa is my top pick tho~~
She's funny
Beatrice is my favorite atm
Tho the demon thing was obvious since they were red and blue
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
The only spoilers I know is that rem loves Subaru at some point. Subaru rejects cause he loves Emilia. And that rem and ram are demons
You know for as popular as this show was.  I got very little spoilers
<@256945399338631168> wait did u mean literally or metaphorically
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
~~looks at wall~~
<@256945399338631168> and yes I do
My other hypothesis is that the poisoning and obliteration are unrelated. The count might have something or someone as security during the night that Subaru wasn't supposed to see
Seems overkill
~~though if they can just obliterate him. I don't see the point of poisoning him on top of that~~
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Can't Muck up the precious emelia
Do not confirm this but My current hypothesis is that Ram or the count dude is poisoning his food under suspicion of spy. And when he finally gets Emelia to agreed to a date is when they decide to kill him.
I mean dying in his sleep was a curve ball already
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
You're a curve ball
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<@139432096023183360> oof. That'll be like all of next episode then.
~~i miss elsa~~
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Took him what 3 resets for his initial one.
Next episode will have him start his third round. How many rounds does he go thru this time?
Spoiler
So I would like to ask a light
Watch it all again
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>
<a:test2:663886201400590337>
You'll hear me fanboy every week tho
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ohhh so 4th season will be U
What's the T stand for
Wakawakawakawakawaka
Smol girl eats everything, including people
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Konami collab
But I feel like these people really exist and that extreme fandom scares ms
This was one weird af anime
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
How will this work
Wait is this an idol anime but from a fans perspective?
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Then again I did play the style savvy games for 3ds
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Probably cause it's shounen and not shoujo
Can't say I would be interested in a fashion model anime but here I am
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
I did get a little bored on the second episode tho. I'd didnt expect a dialog to take up the whole thing plus some of next episode
It's probably number 4 or 5 for my most liked shows this season
I also like inspectre
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I feel like such a dum dum
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
<@203444794737950720> I now completely understand your statement about seriousness
Dodge ball*
The volleyball was the best part of the show
Ikr?
<:thatsTOXIC:664295111735115833>
<:YuiPeekS:664396793013993489>

More bookworm followers! Welcome!
That looks like a sic MG box
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I own s1 and 2 of non non boyori. Have yet to watch it
Interesting
Ah I never knew that acronym
What's CGDCT I'm bad with acronyms
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Is this year the eye of the storm? Will we be bombarded by nonstop isekais next year?
Isn't shield hero or slime second seasons supposed to air this year?
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Japan can u start liking giant robots again? I miss those animes
That shot was getting ridiculous
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Finally
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Honestly I'm expecting Somali to be a stealth Isekai. It's the only way it explains how a small girl child got where she was in the fantasy world
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
This season discluding the reairing of rezero. Has no isekai
Actually ...
It's a fun little romp that honestly evades a ton of cliches
So kanade got me thinking about isekais. Both bad and good. And one I stopped on that was pretty middle of the road. Was Kenja No Mago. The OP Isekai character was born into the world as a baby and trained at a young age to learn Magic. The reason he is op is cause the way their magic system works he can apply science to them and make stronger spells. And make enchantments using Kanji instead of the language of that world to make abilities other people can't cause there's a character limit to enchantments.
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
5 dollars is an expensive ass uncommon. U must be very playable
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
I wonder how much an overdeath card is worth
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
U reminded me how little Chris interacts with hibiki and tsubasa after G.
Lots of fisting
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
How did Symphogear get into nanoha
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's the edgey reboot
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I don't want to be Satan
 Thank u
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
U can raise them?
What's MGRP
It was definitely not as good as season 1/2 then
~~only if it doesn't suck like season 3~~
Yea. It probably felt overly bloated thanks to all the secondary chars.
Overlord. Boring. Re zero. Boring. Tanya. Potentially fun but didn't do much with her at first.
When the show focused on konosuba was the only good moment
It's meant to. It definitely wasn't 80% of the time
Bro I dropped original IQ after like 4 episodes. Was boring af
Became an even more Loli ~~human~~ minotaur
~~and it's totally not cause of Hestia loli~~
Somali and the forest spirit is the show in most excited to see week to week.
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>
In Spectre should not be in the top 10 for that pisspoor episode 2.
I thought sequels weren't allowed on the list
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's like how all the female protag isekais/vrmmos are better than the male ones.
<@87512939107450880> hey at least the figures from that other show are top tier. <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Op is fire
Like uses their knowledge to their advantage in the new world?
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Define isekai plot point
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Like how edgey can u make a char. He's a samurai assassin vampire named Kufa Vampir
But even worse
Dumpster fire Kirito Asuna knock off
That explains so much about assassin's pride
Can I pick Yu-No as my least favorite Isekai? If I can't, I pick master of ragnarok
<@211827730403164160> in your opinion. What's the best Isekai u have seen and the worst one
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Should animes where u get dropped into a time period of Earth's past even be classified as an Isekai?
Ambitions of Oda nobuna is also a really good Isekai that I forget is in that genre
Me neither lpl
Tanya the evil is probably my favorite Isekai atm
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I mean*
Iean the budget is definitely used well on fanservice
Im glad there are a few good isekais
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Like if we want to talk about bad Isekai. U got that, Isekai cheat magician, knights and magic, choyoyu.
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Oh I misread your statement
WHY
Wait in another world with my smartphone is getting a second season?
~~also I can only take SASUGA AINS SAMA~~ so much until I go crazy
They were total bros
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I liked the lizardman arc..
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
It's been a downward spiral for me. I don't like how much ains has changed.
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
If overlord gets a 4th season. It's the last chance it gets to impress me
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I mean Asuna was killed in Sao.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Yea I hate albedo. She does nothing. Go die please
It was also the moment where I feel like momonga really changed. Becoming a true villian. At least with the lizard people he brought them back to life. Those adventurers. Torn tonshreds and experimented on
Crap work time. Ttyl
<@87512939107450880>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
To what?
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
This is xenosaga all over again
Wait is there a nigredo too?
No
And why haven't we seen them yet
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Who is rubedo?
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Kanade was right. Overlord is trash
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I hate demiurge SASUGA ains sama
No go die
Shalltear is the only fun npc. And Butler dude.
Like I realize they're NPCs brought to life. But they're so boring
I rarely change my avatar
Ftw indeed
Burger is the only one millhi likes apparently
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Rayneshia best butler
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
She was. Which is why it is an injustice that she got shafted the most!
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Princess lenesia or whatever her name was. Got hit by the ugly hammer the worse tho
I think akatsuki was the one of the only ones who improved from s1 to 2
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Why make it so jagged tho
S2 looks like she stopped bathing
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
Ruined
God she was such a cutie
Found s1 ears

Must've been all the time cause I feel like I never saw them
I just noticed that
Also was she not an elf in season 1 and is now an elf in season 2?
Always makes me cry

<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
The most important part to a vain person like me
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
How season two for the most part looks worse character design wise vs season 1.
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>

Resurrected just to be killed agian

No way
B2G1 on amazon and target. got some animes. might dip into it
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
I thought you had to blur the pictures or hide the covers for 18+ products.
I do find it funny how a lot of retail chains are completely fine with selling hentai. Like u know that's porn right?
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
<@87512939107450880> I don't think this adds up
dont you love when covers are just this? that sure helps me on what this anime is about lol
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Remember when crusty lost an arm
Lost song?
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Playing hollow fragment just made me realize how boring and one dimensional the whole cast is. And that's when I started to dislike it a ton.
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Too bad I never got that far in the show
I think mother's Rosario was their way to make Asuna her own character
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
~~no plot is relevant in sao~~
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Actually I dropped it at the Excalibur hunt
~~also to get me to watch alicization that would force me to finish Sao season 2 when I dropped it after the GGO arc finished~~
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Isn't HR just a PS4 version of HF with extra content like that new NPC girl with no emotions?
I saw. I can't wait for Deen to fuck it up
Yws
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I meant if it follows HF at all. The only good parts are with philia
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Is a mobile game
Best Sao game
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I watched alicization thru the Sao rising steel game
~~and it's totally not cause she's kirika~~
I like alice
I must've played a different game than u cause every story quest was u and your friend talking/getting advice from kirito and crew
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
I was like why
Kirito is in almost every other cutscene in FB
<@87512939107450880> it does tho
But still missed the mark imo
Fatal bullet is the closest to being a decent game
They all are
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
Accel world alicization
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
Crime is crime!
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
The creator is already used to crimes
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Inb4 she looks even worse
Why can't we have two fire songs instead of 
1
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
It till bothers me they never made a second opening. Just reused database u lazy fucks
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Why not rip me. I loved Marielle s1
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
Original Deen content?
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
I just knew log horizon season 3 was cominf
I didnt know that
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Why did u say rip millhi earlier
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>

Dxd best harem anime ever. Fight me
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Any good?
Yes that one
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>  cypher what anime am I thinking of
I'm trying to remember a different anime. Main heroine had red hair. I think it had two seasons. Testament might've been in the name
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Ah. This looks generic. No offense to people who like it
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Rakudai?
I mean outside of half the Symphogear cast. I don't know singers names. At best I know band names and even then only big ones
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
I ask again. Who?
Who?
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
I hear a lot of bad in this
Sounds like hagure no yuusha
Amiami.com
But amiami has been around for forever
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Japanese website that sales many things
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Only a little
<@87512939107450880> might be interested in it too
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Wanna see my potential amiami loot?
I want many things
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
Hell I bought some defect products from amiami for dirt cheap cause they didn't bother me or I could fix them
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
I used to pay that for 1/4-1/6 figs
130 bucks for a 1/8 figure that's just sitting/standing there half baked.
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>
Shouldn't
It should be
<@87512939107450880> a majority of Rias, koneko, and akeno figs are minimum 100 dollars
Out if this world yo
U see those dxd figure prices?
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Anyone watching Deen Orphen? I dropped it after one episode and curious how it's going
~~many animes do zero~~
My AOTY last year
I need more bookworm nao
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>
<@87512939107450880>
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
Shipping will cost the same amount at the total order of my figures
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
I need to contact amiami. My shipping it too much. Itll probably be cheaper to get it sent half and half
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Yep. If it's 13 episodes maybe it'll be more quality instead of the 24
Oh true. She joked
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
Wait. Shirabe is gonna buy figs forever
<:doge:496780220309962772>
Thank you shirabe
<@87512939107450880> LMAO. shirabe hates detabeis
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
If amiami doesn't screw me on shipping. I think I'll do a damaged and defect order every month
I love her shit eating grin
<@231025503643893770> what's a nesober
And the best get. Missing her alternate arms that make her naked which I would leave her clothes on anyways. Otherwise perfect condition
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Discolored base. That I can just paint all white
Amiami is usually the cheapest place to buy figs before shipping at least.
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
No issues on this one. Just under 20 for no reason
Anyways my first pic has a broken kunai at the handle. Easy fix!
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
I feel like it costs more to get shit from California than from japan
Sometimes it's not bad
Oh it ships from there I mean. To? Im not sure
Japan

<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Anyways onto my 20 or under figures thanks to defects!
They aren't mainly resellers. They sell new products mostly. They just happen to have a pre-owned section too
Animes that end... Feel so rare
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Why do we even watch animes
Snafu is getting a third season? Huh. Didn't expect that
AoT pulling a bleach I see
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>
Why is it labelled final season then
AoT final season October? The manga is done?
Am not! It's just the their most recent seasons don't give me confidence
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<@87512939107450880> overlord 4 might also be in that trash can. Same with LHS3
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I can't wait for slime s2
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Games more believable than Sao gameworld
Somali is my second favorite show atm
<:doge:496780220309962772>
Shield girl is best show
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
I feel like this season so far outside of rezero is kinda underwhelming
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
U watching anything this season or nah?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
You right I should be honest. Steven universe
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
U watched avatar the last air bender?
U must watch train wrecks
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:doge:496780220309962772>
I dunno. We have log horizon season 3 by Deen this year
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
<@139432096023183360> while the makes me happy. Rifle girl is second and I heard that was a not stellar anime
Actually I really liked when original vanguard made the main char disappear from existence and his mentor/rival became the main char for that season
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
*stares at akame ga kill*
Well u definitely can't have more story when the main char dies
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@87512939107450880> school days?
Yea like the main arc is over. But new things could always happen in the future
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>
The best anime I'll never own cause fuck spending 100+ dollars on one season of anything
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
Also it still trips me out that Japan was like sure pierced genie nipples is a okay for tv.
<:CarolPout:617039564313198602>
I miss my jolly ~~green~~ blue giant
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Best African character in anime
She really is. I love her
Id watch
Two 25 episode seasons wasn't enough
I need it in anime form
Yes
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I'm amazed there's still no Dessing third season
But people have recommended me shows that I watched and were good
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>
There are too many zubats in this cave
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~which is shit. Especially mine~~
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
I can't believe kanada thinks this is a bad show. While I can see an argument with overlord. I can't here. It's really funny when it's not soul crushing
That frustration with being the only one who remembers when rems about to kill him. Was rough yo
Yea. Especially if he told her and puck at the same time cause he could tell if he was lying
Like if the curse or whatever he has let him tell someone. I feel like puck and/or Beatrice would believe him
The animation made me think he was gonna die right tjere
I was wondering why he never tried to tell anyone about his ability until now
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Worth
Subarus last thing he did before he died
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I wanna touch Beatrice's drill hair.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And their names are Emilia and subaru
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
So if the fairy tales are rem and ram for the ogres. I'm gonna guess Emilia is the witch and Subaru is the dragon.
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Yea me and my bro are like Beatrice what u doing girl?
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Also when Subaru was walking AROUND Beatrice. It looks like he was just walking straight and Beatrice was spinning with him while walking
They so fun
I seriously love Beatrice and puck tho. My fav chars
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Man I didn't think I'd like dark souls the animation cause I wasn't a fan of the games
Will next episode explain that
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Why tho
Yes
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Must befriend both
Get too close to one and the other kills u
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Rem and ram are killing him separately
Wtf killed Rem tho. No matter how much I sit here and think. I can't figure that one out
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
And yes. If he had just actually left. He would've been fine. I forgive him cause he die 3 days ago and wasn't thinking straight
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
<@139432096023183360>  I mean he was limping exhausted with a trail of vomit.... Is that really sneaking
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
If rem was killing him every night. I'm quite shocked she did it on the one where he was able to make her smile
I'm so curious on this witch if envy
Also Beatrice continues to be best girl
Just watched episode 4 of re zero. Man that despair was real yo
Cypher atd himself

I wish Funimation had good sales. They're always poopy in comparison to sentai filmworks
~~tho black Friday anime sales started early so I was done shopping on like tuesday~~
The day I stay inside and order everything on the internet

Half my collection at minimum is Black Friday anime

A great pick me up after all that desspair
I love this dumbass show. It's great. The fight was animated way better than I expected too
<:doge:496780220309962772>
Shield girl got nerfed. Literally. She was so op the devs had to make a patch to tone down her busted skills

<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Isekais are only referred to animes in the past what decade? that refers to all the shows jumping on the other world band wagon
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
Zombieland saga
So only Zombieland saga

A lot of the reveal the main baddie in the opening

And then lovelive was like. Hey you want billions of yen sunrise?
<@202444817043685386> Gundam doesn't make the cash it used too. The gunpla animes are what's helping them make money again. But the serious stuff that's super high quality doesn't have as much gains
~~lovelive saved sunrise~~
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
I mean they're both second fiddle to Zombieland saga
Somali has been very good too
I'm glad it picked back up cause I was this close to dropping it
That talk was so fucking pointless with that snakes
In Spectre episode 3 was good. I'm happy it's back on track
I havent either
Episode 2 and 3 of runway model show were hype af. Is rising in the ranks for top anime this season for me
<@87512939107450880>

Yea I haven't sat down and watched a whole show before in one sitting in a long time  4-5 is max for me too
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
So many binges I forgot exist
Also helps stick in my brain when it takes 12 weeks to finish a show. Instead of 3 hours in one day
Some shows are better watched weekly imo. Tho some shows are great binges
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
But I like pinging u keupho
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<@139432096023183360> what other hobbies u got?

Smile on the runway was an emotional rollercoaster
<a:test2:663886201400590337>
<@139432096023183360> two more days until rezero
Tho now I have to wait for rezero rearing to finish to try to get my bro to watch. Otherwise he'll realize that rezero isn't actually a new anime this season
Also everyone ragged on aqua during the scene so even better xD
Okay so I saw the scenes where naofumi "joined" the isekai quartet class. Was pretty funny
<@203444794737950720> what about me

She's always fun. ~~and murdery~~

Like I want Isekai quartet to have ramifications. And like Tanya gets sents to konosuba world by accident and is just there
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I would love an anime crossover where a secondary character from one anime joins the cast of another anime permanently and one from that anime joins the other one. (like a double Isekai)
PLz no

We got 3 robot animes last year and they all sucked
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
NOBODY LIKES THEM ANYMORE FOR SONE REASON. THATS WHATS WRONG <@263534352422404096>

<@139432096023183360> someone spoiled something in rezero for me
What's wrong with 40 eps?
It looks quality. Just not in my wheelhouse of interest.
More than I have seen
I wonder how I would've felt if I watched it when it first released instead of being hyped up over years
This is a strange feeling
I guess I was anticipating... Something more? From something so highly rated. I feel a bit let down cause everyone praised this show I never watched
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Whelp time to wait for that
Oh a movie came out 10 days ago
I guess so. I really feel like the anime didn't get super good until like episode 9. 7-8 with ozen was cool. But I dunno. Solid 8 from me.
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
I enjoyed it but Im curious how it became 25th anime on mal
Finished made in abyss
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Be awesome right off the bat
Why can't battle shounens follow yuyu.

I thought you've been around for the conversations that stated that
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
U know the directors cut are double episodes right?
Last thing was rem and Subaru fighting dogs
<@99695384296701952> if I'm on ep 5 of directors cut. That would put me at episode 9 right?
Shield girl was funny and fun.
~~keikakku means plan~~

<@139432096023183360> last @ but my bro is like. Man this is the best show of the season..I'm gonna be sad when it's over. (Little does he know this isn't new. And another season starts after this one)
God I love this anime
And Beatrice continues to be so fucking adorable with her reactions
They're so fucking funny
Also I love puck and Subarus comedy skits
A lot of budget went into murdering dogs
<@139432096023183360> brooooo. Episode 5 of re zero was pog

I was more annoyed they tried to squeeze out as little constant as possible by stretching a chapter over 4-5 episodes
Black clover
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'd rather watch FT over BC at least
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>

My favorite Key is Kanon.

Skip goblin
Violet evergarden

Steins gate had many timelines but I enjoyed that
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
I found it too talky. Too many metaphors and play on words
I wasn't a fan. But their figures are cool to look at

Nobody pinged me

Wouldn't it be hard to direct your actors if you don't know the context of the show
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I freaking love the main char. She's such a troll and I love it.
I'm so glad inspectre is good again. Two episodes in a row
Another good episode of nothing
Animal school was hilarious and cute
I freaking love this show
Episode 4 of smile on the runway was great again!
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>

Just picked up 5 new anime Blu rays for cheap to add to my collection
Reminds me of nozomi
I like her big purple hair
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
That's not her only redeeming feature!
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Also rip nanase. She seemed like a cool character I would've watched an anime about
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
U usually aren't tangled up by a monster with no way to hurt it tho
*starts campaign with 23 AC and has shield spell to bring it up to 28*
It's amazing
Bofuri is how you fail upwards
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I still can't believe we got blessed with no isekai this season. ~~not counting rezero reairing~~
This and Somali have very expressive faces for jokes. I love it

Her cat face at the end of episode 3

I like how the steel nanase case is bringing out the troll in kotoko
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
I love how he bought a milfs coloring book for a gag. And nothing else
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
Hey it's gigguk
It's a good thing she gets instant karma for her bully tendencies
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
<@263534352422404096> I think the joke is she has a nice body but an awful personality so it's a "waste"

<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
Played thru all of it. Even unlocked the hidden ZZ fight. But always wondered why o couldn't use this Judau anywhere else
I has no Idea what a zeta gundam was until that game
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh just play find vs zeta gundam and get all the confusing story from multiple sides of characters at once like I dis
Full tv series
And if I want more content of it. Watch the original
You should watch the trilogy movies for the OG of I want to try it
Is age really that bad? I heard it was okay until third generation kid was a total tool and ruined the ending

I do want to buy the Penelope gundam
I already don't buy HG kits. This just makes me never want to touch them
Veetwo
Right right
Whichever one was the long beam gun
I think the jupitive needs the core spray gun from the earthree and the weapon pack to finish it
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
When u need the colored weapon of the earthree to complete a different Gundam cause the weapon pack is off color
My favorite part is
Or sell the weapons in the fucking box
Evil core Gundam looks needed
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
Like the ZZ Gundam or the O
But I love bulk
I like the bulky actually
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Which is a fantastic kit
Tho buld divers did give me the galbady rebake/ galbady beta revive
Build divers is when the kits really started going down hill. Like 40% were good. And then re arise had like 80% bad kits
Build fighters I think we're all new molds. Or based off of recent revive kits
They've been reussing a lot of old molds that are very aged instead of making new ones
Even the quality of their gunpla based of those shows have gone down hill
Quality*
Because they realized anything will sell no matter the qualirt
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
~~hyper build knuckle most hype moment in gundam~~ except maybe the love love tenkyoken

The animation for the samurai fight could've been better but I don't mind it

Watched episode 4 and 5 of princess principle. This is such a good show.
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Just imagine how historic it would be if it did
Inb4 this anime gets cancelled on every channel

Also nanachis flashback was probably the best flashback episode I've seen in all of anime
Best girl

Hardly got any time with the actual good characters

Frozen is a monster no matter which country u go to. What did they do to get this voodoo to work
<@202444817043685386> yea due to health issues
Also the music was top notch
The jokes were very funny too
Overall of rate it an 8.5/10 I enjoyed every episode and there wasn't a character in the main cast I didn't like
Bunny girl senpai, konosuba, kimetsu no yaiba, made in abyss and now princess principle
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Everything I've been watching of late has a movie that I need to wait for and it's frustrating
Now sure how I feel about that

<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I would assume after the 4th one I'd have infinite honestly. I'd be afraid itd be 3 and done
I know dying sucks really bad I'm sure. But I almost feel like he would become unphased by it after so many times like this other anime this season ||inspector||
Nice
Physical to mental back to physical
<:PecoWant:608064874181820456>
And the mmo that shield girl is in is really poorly made if they give out crazy skills like the most recent one
I need next episode
Chihayafuru is killing me mab
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Only one adachi is really good
Going from snow drop ova to this was the biggest whiplash I've ever had. From the best episode I've seen so far to the worst
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<@202444817043685386> <@115744398997716995> how many episodes am I looking at for this depressing Subaru? He just got left behind by emilia
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
Lol reminds me when I showed I think solo the moment when shirabes yoyo pops off impossibly
I love her
Kotoko is such a great main char
Does he get better again? Or is he a piece of garbage for awhile. Cause if he stays garbage it'll make me question why this anime is so praised
I know I know.
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
<@139432096023183360> one complaint I have while I understand Emilia's frustration. But whenever she askes questions and Subaru TRIES to answer he visibly looks like he's in physical pain multiple times. Also puck can tell when people are lying/what their motives are.
I died when she named her turtle syrup
That's awesome and such a maple thing
Oh really?
With her turtle?
<@87512939107450880> what's the time in game vs irl? I forgot. It's like 3 days to a couple hours or something right?
My innergamer was happy
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
I love how the ATK girls got OP skills from grinding a boss. That was so smart of maple to powerlevel them
Honestly the main char is a genius at times
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Can I just have more seasons of shield girl online? It's so stupid and I love it
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
My brain was like. Who Marielle. And I thought fire emblem at first
Log horizon
OH
Wait October?

Are u sure I'm not a VN Lich?
I'm just a newbie
It's the same with touch ups/extra scenes
No.
It was soooo freaking funny
Snow drop is my favorite episode
<@139432096023183360> but yea I HATED this episode. Which sucks cause I really liked all the new chars this episode introduced.
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Okay
Hanako. Not hakuto

<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
<@237964037898502144> I want to watch toilet ghost hakuto

Shield girl is tons of fun
Do u want to watch seasonal anime or older stuff?
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Not every Saturday. And if I do. It's only until 1pm. Like tomorrow. Sundays I never work
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I work 10 hour days
Yep
I work till 6pm eastern every day so I'm unavailable before that
<@237964037898502144>
Imo*. But I just can't watch things on my own anymore
Missed out on some really interesting shows imi
I also only watch anime with a person, aka my bro. So if he doesn't like it I don't watch it.
Pick me!
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Watch the anime then
Catch up ikxi
<:PecoWant:608064874181820456>
Syrup! It's pancake time!
Lol I can totally see
<@431214733463519232> I wouldn't be shocked if maple comes up with a combo attack with syrup called pancakes.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
When the anime u used to watch that was a staple to all anime fans is now obscure cause it's old af
Bad jazz imo
Thunderbolt. Cause that's just a single watch of. A movie
Okays
okay so two lol
episode one of bofuri?
roger that
Will we be chatting here or did u want to voice chat. I'm fine with either
I'm home. I'll be loading up my pc in a minute  <@237964037898502144>
Okay
Finally free
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
How did u want to do the multi watch anyways?
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<@237964037898502144> I do have a family dinner to get in 3 hours (was just informed this morning). So I'll only be around for about an hour to watch anime.  But that'll get like 3-4 episodes in at least of shirldgirl
Hopefully. Waiting for customers to leave the store so I can leave myself. God I hate last minute walk ins
I'm sorry
Let's hold off for another day. I'm waiting for the cleaning supplies to settle so I can scrub the shower
<@237964037898502144> hey sorry Ive been cleaning and lost track of time
I did. For about 8 episodes
I'm down
Yeah
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Trash?  <@279341087494242304>

I like the armor on
Eh. Nedleeh is okay

Virtue is my favorite mech from 00. Such a chunky boi
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I need to fix my 00 raiser one day. I feel bad that i haven't. He was an expensive kit

Yukine Chris was in the latest episode of Somali and golem dad
Never enough dakka
He does do nice things off camera. Like giving meimei a blanket. I wish they knew
He knows best girl
I don't like the main guy much but I'm happy miyubi is the only animal so far he stopped calling stupid
Meimei is cute
Nobody has died more in an anime xD
<@453836798796234762> best char in that anime. I love her lol
That Betelgeuse fucked with an insane person so much he made them sane again (sorta)
This episode was a freaking rollercoaster tho
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
But why kill subaru
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
Not an actual question I want answered but holy shit. What happened to puck?
I need to go buy a figure of her
Rem is literally the best girl ever
This was literally my favorite episode. Jesus.

Slight spoiler question. Is Subarus mind not broke anymore or is he still crazy just also mad af
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
im still not over that episode!
<@139432096023183360> IM SO HAPPY YOURR HERE NOW
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I need to watch more of that. I only saw 2 eps
Why did mikoto get knocked down so many ranks. Damn
~~wheres rem~~
She protecc
Maple is amazing
I agree. Her happiness to despair was amazing. They drew two separate scenes for one moment. That's dedication
I was in the ram camp two episodes ago during the snow drop ova. She was funny af
I can't contain myself
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>
SO MICH HAPPENED THIS ~~dual~~ EPISODE
I was like NOOOOO
ME TOO
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
I'm in the rem camp now
I was not prepared for this rollercoaster
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I don't even know how to feel
<@115744398997716995> that ending was like dayum
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
<@139432096023183360> WHAT DID I JUST WATCH
Also rip cute feminine hyena. She lasted barely half an episode
I wish she did lol
I love how crazy big her sister is lmao
Ranka is honestly my least favorite of the bunch
Also how the fuck did he build an hot springs by homself
<@87512939107450880> explain yourself.
Smile on the runway is a precious jewel
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
The real mystery is why isn't the model anime main chars on this list. They're way better than like half to 80% of the list
They're so cute together
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
I just noticed the power couple of In/Spectre are sharing the same rank
Just reminding me that the females of the season are way better than the males lol
<a:PrelatiLewd:424299050364567552>
<@139432096023183360> I'm not here for the plot. In here for the suffering
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
With this anime and now Darwin's game. Voice of Kirito is perfect for messed up villians. And not protags lol
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I like Betelgeuse more tho
Like what
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I'm so happy another season will be up after this one ends
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>

Gotcha. Sadly I'll be at work but I hope u guys have fun
<@87512939107450880> do u guess what anime the song is from or the song name itself? How does this work?
<:HibiMikuPeek:661660014288568361>
I know the pokerap

I love her

It's hard to take. Apic thru the plastic

I took a picture of her next to my biggest gunpla for size comparison

<@87512939107450880> <@279341087494242304> @anyone else who's interested. My new figure came in. And she's way bigger than I expected.
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>

<@87512939107450880> did I miss it?
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
What's that last one again?
Minus OG Gundam song xD
All the UC era Gundam songs are such slappers.
Lol
HONTO NO KOTOSA
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>
No it's ZZ
Anime ja nai!
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Shirabe wanted to let u know they sent up stuff
Family wanted me.
I know
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
In Spectre being the top anime this week? Eh... It was a lot of repeating of the last episode. They talk in circles a lot I've noticed. (Probably to pad times)
I'm glad kurou is showing more emotion himself. He was(still is) a wet blanket
Kotoko also has the cutest and funniest expressions on her face. Very emotive
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
She actually does things
She's the best.
<@205859030051061769> probably cause she's am actual person with goals and aspirations. Rather than being just a heroine for the main char to get
I wouldve picked Anzu myself for best girl of 2018. She was so freaking precious
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That's a strange way to spell Tae carlos
<@104194257908154368> I was referring to the anime getting to the ending of the manga
Is this finally the end of food wars?
Imagine when he kicks over the rx78
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Making it walk
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
It's a blast
That it correct
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
When they finally give us a MG of of any of the GP series
*looks at life sized unicorn statue in Japan*
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
That's a new one to me
It's unpopular to like unicorn?
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
It's so majestic
The unicorn theme Melody is already something I love
And all those are great too
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
Unicorn didn't have op songs cause they were long OVAs. And nothing else
Gotcha
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Is it the sinon user
<@87512939107450880> <@279341087494242304>
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Mangas... End?
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
Yuyuhakusho ended at the tournament arc. (Or the black arc is okay too)
Honestly where this last arc of food wars ended. It should've been the finale of the show
Bunny girl senpai was easily the best surprise anime
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
There's other components?
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Hotd I wanted a zombie anime with a bit of lewd. And I got a lewd anime with a bit of zombies
~~2nd season where~~
I don't go for lewd shows lol
Never tried it.
Oh is that the angel anime where they have slave collars or wherever?
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
I had a stroke after reading is
And get a pretty decent plot in it too
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
It's great
Sup?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
It's strange. Lewdness can. Really turn me off to a good show but then I watch highschool DxD
Me too man
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Cause japan loves English words
<@87512939107450880> I'm sorry what?
Of course there is
Yea but this was like... Cheap lewd?
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
I tried to like that hero anime but I dunno. Something about it... Maybe too lewd?
I like the one that's all emoticons and has no words
Shes so cute lol
Oh Sally just popped up as a VA in Welcome to demon School Iruma-kun.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
God that title
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
I call it Shield Girl Online myself
Probably just the most recognizable word
Bofuri. I'm glad lightnovels usually try to adapt a short hand name for their long af titles lol
I legit forget konosuba is a shorthand
Shortnames also work. Like Anohana
I'll take the easy to remember English name than memorizing a Japanese name any day lol
I didn't even know the promised Neverland had a Japanese title. I've literally only ever heard of it referred to by it's English name
Yay me

Top 10 waifus would be a different list than top 10 best girls too imo.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I've watched too many animes
Man I wouldn't even know where I would start with top 10 waifus.
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
I love how her outfit enchanted with a can ALMOST see her panties but can't actually spell
Gotcha
Is there a reason she's called black rabbit when she's blue(and pink)
If Kirito was actually fun and had a personality
While im sad best girl didn't end up with the keima from world god only knows. I do like who they chose
Deserved it more than infinite fanservice at least
Yep
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
<@87512939107450880> when we get S2 of NGNL
I need to see the movie
It's in my top animes too
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Total beefcake and would probably fight anyone to protecc u
Like genjuro would be a toptier husband imo
I could do the same thing for straight guys too. The fun of hypothesis
I'm just talking about their potential spousness. ~~even if they were never confirmed or unconfirmed~~
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Honestly I'd probably only put like hibiki and tsubasa on my waifu list. I wouldnt jive with the rest most likely in a relationship.
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
But I can only do one girl per anime. Otherwise half the list wpd be Zombieland saga girls
Maybe after work while I wait for SDS to release
I wanna make a top 10 now

To be fair tho. He stupid af
Every candidate fucked with him this episode I felt like
Like bruh
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
Yes but all this begging and shit wouldn't have happened at least if he had ANY power whatsoever
This is like the one Isekai where u actually needed OP powers off the bat. And he didn't get them

Smile down the runway in top 10.
On Spectre was number 1? Huh. Maybe it's just too talky for my taste.
Thankies
Interesting
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
<@87512939107450880> do they do a list for just animes in general per week too?

Did it? I have no idea. I mean bring back the OG cast
Beyblade reboot?
What's next
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
First pokemon reboot. Now digimon reboot
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
If only they didn't ruin terriermons Mega form
I know Captain tsubasa. Never seen it
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>
Watching Japanese dubs of Americans made shows is so weird
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Hey man nadesico looks fantastic and thats 97
<@87512939107450880> <@279341087494242304> today is the 20 year anniversary of gundam first premiering on western televisions on toonami
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>
Sick
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
I will disappoint u
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
I'm off in an hour cypher
<@87512939107450880>
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
What's up?
Yes.
<:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
<@468591607332208641> ||where he go||
Yayyyy
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
That's so sad
<:KirikaScared:672584678993297431>
Sad
So rokusho never got a partner?
Rokusho was the most badass looking one from what I remember
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I liked the electric cat medabot
Generic*
Googling him. He looks pretty genetic
Really? Wao.
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Which metabot was the winner for s1
Ohhh
Finally a good MHA episode. This season has been pretty meh
30 seconds into smile down the runway and I got the best laugh of this season
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>
Speaking of isekais. Did anyone watch Isekai quartet season 2?
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
Kiriwo arc killed the shows momentum
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
Only thing I liked is how characters I'd expect to be main chars that would last to the end of the show... Didnt
No it's not wrong
How will I survive without my weekly clara
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
Nooooo
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<@202536957685923841> are u serious?
It ran fully on USA. I remember seeing abaoa qu
I can show u what I had set up before they got reboxed
<@87512939107450880> I don't really have an update picture to show u cause new things haven't left their boxes yet
Eh I mean. We're talking about other figures too.
<:notbad:546984399732998144>
Oh there's a shirabe too
Holding them hostage for people to buy kirika
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>

I hope it's not 300 bucks like hibiki
Looks dope
I didn't know about the July one tho
Yea
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
I mean she was clearenced. So I doubt it's the one that hasn't come out yet
She has more than one?
It was weird lol
On my Gundam store
I posted the Kirika figure here once. It was on clearence sale at a site
<:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
Shirabe and kirika got figures before maria
Unlike maria
At least tsubasa has a fivure
Would've waited
<:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
Pink was all that existed at first. I never expected her to get recolors
It's been huge
Getting?
<@87512939107450880> this one is mine
Similar to this face
<a:ChrisBaka:670628703734333450>
In person she looks embarrassed more than unhappy
Sup?

Yep. Based off her XDU bunny girl card
The white one is my favorite
There's 4 versions
And white
I have the pink one perspnally
I'll keep my eyes open. If I ever see a good deal I'll let u know
Which color are u looking for?
I remember when she first released she bargain binned hard for like 40 bucks. I was pretty salty cause she was one of the only figures I pre-ordered.
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
Everyone has to start somewhere carol
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
*sends Carol all my figures I can't display*
Carol is a new collector?
Recomguista and I think build fighters Try? Was around when they stopped making MG of the main chars gunpla
But we at least did get Age MGs
<@64565434468282368>
Was recomguista the start of Bandai refusing to make at least one master grade of the main chars robot
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
I salute u for finishing something I couldnt
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
After that ending I agree
That's dope
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
I didn't know Ameri was the highest ranking student in the school at 6
I'd watch that
~~if the anime went to 25 it could've done that story too~~
Give kuromu a spare episode then.
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Why stop at 2. Cut 6
<@202536957685923841>
~~how did nobody figure out Clara though~~
Top tier crossdressing right there
Idol iruma was so unexpected
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
We gonna dress them up and play house of corpse
Holy crap I was on the floor
Me tooooo
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I feel so conflicted
I want the main character to end up with Clara. But I also really want Ameri. And kuromu now too
Ikr?
Hopefully Ameri and kuromu get more screen time next season.
I really am gonna miss the three musketeers though
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
If this goes from a comedy anime to a battle anime. Or Thai ending gets resolved in the first episode of season. Two. I'm not sure how I'll feel
Uggg
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>
<@202536957685923841> I just finished iruma kun. Dang it, I didn't think I'd want a second season but that sequel bait
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
Cheaper. Cooler. Usually bigger too
It's one of the reasons I moved over to Gundam model kits.
Pretty much. Dealing with scripts or insurance
I work at a medical supply store
Yea it sucks robo
Or the Xenoblade chronicles 2 mythra and pyra are 250-300 dollars a piece
Like that shirabe and kirika are 200 a piece
It's crazy
Things I used to buy for 70ish bucks are now 200 bucks
Prices got way too high for my blood
I need a higher paying job if I ever want to get back into the hobby
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Forgot to post this yesterday but smile down the runway had a fantastic episode this week. And going into the next competition I really want two people to win. I hate this. Someone has to lose
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
I hope the bargain bin after the fact
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
You're welcome
Same. Figured I'd at least let u know
<@453836798796234762>  that kirika figure is back on sale on one of my Gundam sites I use
Ahhh victory Gundam stuff. No wonder I didn't recognize it
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
You lost me
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
There's so many good mobile suits with only 20+ year old crappy kits
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Also gelgoog and kampfer 2.0s please
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
Can I have gp01,2,3 2.0s please
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
I want the V2AB. Looks so cool
It's a fiddely kit sadly
I have a big backlog cause if I find a sale or something I buy one
Dusting these is a Sunday afternoon lol
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
Yes...
*looks at bookcase*
Anywhere I can get a deal
I buy online. Or in store at like hobby shops and stuff
40 dollars tends to get u a standard MG
More like 15-25
Yea
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Which I am not
Only if you are into railgun
Itll probably be my aoty
Smile down the runway saved 2020 for me so far
True cypher
Debatable
Eh...
I agree
I literally knew nothing about it outside of the name. So I had no clue
Yugiri needs her own episode
I'm assuming that's what season 2 will delve into
Talk about coming out of nowhere and becoming one of my favorite animes ever
I'm so happy that's getting a second season
I'm scared
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
Shirabe bought 2 corpses
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
I really want Jin to stop being such a douche.
That's a great joke
Lmaooooo. I wish they did that yo!
As a man who only ever saw robotech. It was an enjoyable Mecha show to me
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
I liked Macross delta
She's in like every third episode at best
Cat member is the one I forget exists
Nah I actually like ranka in Macross delta
Yea but that personality isn't annoying as shit. So it's okay
Ranka is probably the weakest aspect of the show. Thankfully they don't focus on her often
It's consistently stupid funny. I enjoy it
<:notbad:546984399732998144>
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
WEEEEEEEEE
<@115744398997716995> sloth best girl
I read ichiya as ichika. Rip
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
It's impossible to match him
Everyone is less dense than IS main char
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Mine is Highschool DxD
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Like the main char is black hole levels of inability to tell a girl likes him
Well it is educational on making the densest mother fucker in the history of harem animes. So i give it that
U didn't miss anythinf
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
Let's not give that a second season but give dumpster fire infinite stratos a second one
Same
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
It's just for every one good Isekai like mondaiji. You get 5 more like cheat magician, in another world with my smartphone or blessing of  einjahar ragnarok
<@87512939107450880> I hate on isekais but quite a few are some of my favorites
That's a goodie
Ohhhh
I don't hate them. I'm just overloaded
Yet
The one positive to 2020. No isekai animes
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I will when a good version to Torrent comes out
Haven't watched the movie yet
As did I. It's one of the very few 10/10 shows I've given
Fair
This season while not super amazing. Has a good amount of consistently good shows.
Erased really bungled it's ending and made me a hater of it
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
I really needed this hate session after my garbage fire day of work. Thank u
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
I absolutely hate season 3 of overload
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Now u guys got me wondering shows I hate that I actually completed
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
The whole show was filler
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
U guys ever hate a show so much u dropped it one episode from the final episode?
I also really hate mayo chiki
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
They made a cute dragon girl. And then one episode later killed and ate her.
That anime was the fucking worst
Yu-No
Subaru?
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
U like to hate watch maybe?
On steam
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>
Arata?!? *CHIHAYAFURU INTENSIFIES*
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I used to like that one anime...uh... Date a live! But after 2 seasons I just couldn't be arsed.
Night cypher

Just swap ichika and itsuki
That's almost my list lol
She didn't really get good moments like the rest. It was definitely the Miku/itsuka party with some good Nino moments. and a couple yotsuba moments
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Really? I'm surprised the eldest one got picked.
I'm an anime only person
Bokuben came out too close to quintuplets. I wasn't really in the mood to another comedy tutor anime
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
I liked quintessential quintuplets
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I read quints as the isekai quartet
I tend to skip OPs
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
I don't think I ever watched danmachcis OP
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Also lots of little things are changed for the anime from book form and I just don't understand why
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
S2 had only one decently animated fight. Shit was depressing
I personally think they are
S2 looked so bad yo
<:KannaSip:480753608045101076>
Danmachi books good. Danmachi anime trash
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>
<@139432096023183360>
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722> <:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722> <:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
<@87512939107450880> IS THIS REAL

obviously anime is the one medium u shouldnt take at face value but it doesnt look appealing to me. never been a fan of female lead surrounded by a bunch of cute boys. im not the demograph for that lol
i mean maybe?
i was just reading the synopsis for that
looking at the list. i might just be watching bookworm and the trainwreck of Food wars
because i never finished the first one
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
none of my shows are Two cour and i have no safety net for next season
i just had a horrible realization about the seasonal anime
Thanks carols
Woooo
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
<@64565434468282368> maybe it was just Gundam fans in general. That know amuro is great from the OG series so he got biased votes
<@87512939107450880>
Unless this is new animes only?
Rip people not having watched older stuff
3 chars from later than a couple years ago lpl
<@279341087494242304> his movie was apparently top tier for fans of the dhow
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
Also random fun fact. Megaman ZX and the latest Megaman ExE game at the time had no idea each other were doing a tokusatsu esque hero game where the main char transforms.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's Morphin time
<@627208245626404874> can I spoil other things? Or are u interested in reading the manga now
<@627208245626404874> ||she doesn't die in the manga||
<@468591607332208641> already confirmed fakr
<@279341087494242304> still didn't correct the worst part ||Killing Leone||
It's one of those animes I literally can't recommend to anyone
<@627208245626404874> which was a bummer cause I absolutely loved that show until the nosedive
Daring in the franxxx levels of nosedive
it's for real one of the worst nose dives I've ever seen for a show. It's like
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
Yea <@627208245626404874>. It's great until it's not
I can dream
Fellow pallet town
Gen 6 girl
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
All the designs were really cool
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
Another fantastic episode of smile down the runway
<:knucklespeepers:553093971090472980>
Rem just went on for like 3 minutes for her future with subaru
Felt just too long for me
It was okay
<:knucklespeepers:553093971090472980>
<@139432096023183360> I'm glad rezero has two episodes at once. I would've been really annoyed if I sat down and watched a whole normal episode of just rem and Subaru talking to each other
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
Like I'm gonna vote for char. Might as well vote for amuro too
hahaha
<@!202444817043685386> <@!237964037898502144>

reminds me of the one time persona 4 animation messed up and had two chie in the same shot lol
she's staring into your soul
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>

<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Dammit emilia
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
<@139432096023183360>not gonna lie. I really love crusch now.
Also HOW IS REM NUMBER 2? like holy shit. There's SOOOOO many great moments with her
Wilhelm is a beast
<@139432096023183360> this episode was hype af yo.
<@541480808289009692> it's the only one I never dropped lol
Hype. Bleach was easily my favorite long form anime when it came to Naruto, one piece etc.
I should try that again. I got bored halfway thru
Well yea that's what the players would think. But if the devs knee they programed it to be unbeatable. There would be zero reason to program drops
<@262326868366065664> nobody would know it has no drops cause nobody can beat it
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
Probably ex Bethesda workers
<:knucklespeepers:553093971090472980>
But why program them to be drops at all
I didn't realize that nobody else has pets in the game cause Sally and maple beat the only boss that had them. And it was supposed to be impossible to beat too (why even have rewards for it then)
I hope maple got unique skills for eating so many other players too xD
I hope season 2 lets her friends do more stuff. I really want to see ice climbers fleshed out. Along with the crafter iz
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
A smile that ~~you need to protecc~~ that proteccs you.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
They definitely have a higher a success rate. Maybe it's cause there's just TOO many guy ones that the quality is just bogged down.
I loved this dumb show
Shield girl online getting a season 2! Hypeee
<@139432096023183360> will it explain how Subaru got infected?
<@139432096023183360> so much death. Escalated so quickly
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
But that ending
Such a good episode
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<@139432096023183360> I can't man. This anime
ah never heard of it. as someone who just finished Bofuri last night animewise. i thought it was a ton of fun and look forward to season 2
whats OSO?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Wait this is week 11? I thought we were done at week 12
Maple deserved top spot
Noooo
I didn't need a second season
Dammit. That's a wonderful ending
<@139432096023183360>
So the original just ended with Subaru saying all that wonderful stuff to Emilia?
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
<@139432096023183360> finished. Man that was such a satisfying ending. But I can't help but feel like I forgot something
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
The fact it's had three two cour seasons already is mind blowing
I hope so. It's been so quality
If they ever make a season 4
But I guess I'll find out
I can't even imagine. I've loved every minute of it
Can't wait to add it to my collection
<a:waifuwhale:635650723333537793>
Chihayafuru was best season so far
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
If only season 2 wasn't delayed. I wanted to surprised my bro next wedk
It'll be over today
I loved it
This show was a rollercoaster tho
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<@139432096023183360> one more hour until I leave work and can watch rezero finale
Hmm... Inspectre final episode being above Somali and smile down the runway doesn't add up but eh. Show could've been better. Had a lot of pacing issues
Skipped thru it a bit. Onto episode 11
I'm on episode 10 of in Spectre and honestly super bored
<@87512939107450880> thank u for posting that
The anime Arte looks quite good too from the first episode
Bookworm, bakarina, 8th son. Already watch 3 isekais I enjoy this season
<:knucklespeepers:553093971090472980>
But will any of them be good
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
This is the season of isekais and mobile game adaptions apparently
Followed by digimon 2020
My favorite show this season atm is the isekai with a girl in an otome game as the villian. Was pretty funny
I mean there are worse animes to get S2
I never noticed how much of a rip kenja took from konosuba
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
It's an anime. Claymation and live action all in one
What the hell
I feel like I'm in a fever dream
Gal and Dino is the strangest show I've seen in a looooong fime
Man I missed bookworm
I'm starting my new anime marathon after watching bookworm.
<:MariaWink:688836868736811148>
Remember when patamon digivolvrd for the first time? Most hype champion form
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
I mean it probably also hasa Sora in it
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
He better. He's my favorite
None of those sound like tentomon
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>
What if they all get dropped into the digital world with no memory of the omnimom fight
Aliens?
What's next
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
So is this made for people who watched the original or new fans? Cause dropping all the crests, the angel feathers and skipping ults and mega to go to onnimon is like what
<@115744398997716995> where my other digis at
For real. We haven't seen tentomon
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
It's quite the drama already after 2 eps  <@115744398997716995>
I'm watching. Digimon, gleipnir, 8th son, bookworm, bakarina, shironeko, listeners, yesterday and Arte.
I'm watching half of those and haven't tried the other half yet
<:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
I'm watching a bunch of Isekai again this season
I wish smile down the runway had a season 2 announcement too
<:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714>
I am!
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
I miss you already
Maple!
So what's everyone watch this new anime season? I feel like it's really weird
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Animea live chart shows ??? For number of episodes and they're usually pretty good at updating it when they know the actual number
God what's gonna be the point of this 13 eps then
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
13 only?
Wait
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>
Butt... they don't have the physical necklace crests
~~i hope this does well and is actually good so they can fix adventure 2~~
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Will they need to search for their crests?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I'm definitely not Aya. No sir
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
<@237964037898502144> hi ikxi!
<a:waifuwhale:635650723333537793>
New cheap animes aquired!
Hypeeeee
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Best thing for me personally to watch this year (minus rezero)
Bookworm is the best
Like Alexis and Crow
I just remember my friend loving GX and 5Ds chars popping up to be a boss in it
I thought people liked arc V
I dunno
I need to watch the movie still
Great anime
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
Original P4A Kings game was the best
Losing to cancer sucks for real. Rest in peace <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
~~i watched fma in dubbed so he isn't Hughes to me~~
Oof
Senkus dad.
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Maybe he's just roleplaying ... Really well ..
<:ShirabeMad:688188118087499792>
<@87512939107450880>no
<@445783190976856065> a fight
U mean
<:ShirabeMad:688188118087499792>
U talked like u seen it
Show me what it looks like
<:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
Did they fix it?
Don't make me get the spray bottle
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
Bad cypher
<@87512939107450880> no
Yes
<:OchakoStare:642525126658621441>
<@279341087494242304>like when season 2
~~cant we all just enjoy entertainment for entertainment sake and not overanalyze?~~
Damn being X
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Main point
It's about a guy getting back against Being X for being turned into a Loli.
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
Yes
<:KirikaMad:688188152891834417>
830pm
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
Nuuu
Discluding obvious bookworm. I think bakarina is what I look forward to the most weekly now
Yes
Loving that
Bakarina is great tho
I've seen people usually do live reactions there to anime they watch
I dunno
<:KirikaWhat:671948299179130885>
Isn't that for live shitposting?
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Solo : asterisk is trash!
Cypher : asterisk is great!
Me : that's an anime I haven't seen
Ikr?
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
I want her figures
Red head is hot tho
Never watched it.
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
~~just make all the protag females. Makes the anime 100% better~~
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Pure garbage
Gimme a MG with that look pls
Noice
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
The GM looks like he's trying to be a transformer actually
Looks like a suped up gm and gundam
You know for being the force that lived on Earth. It's interesting efsf never developed water combat units like the zeon did
To take a step back. What's Gundam mermaid?
Blue destiny sounds like it would've been a crazy side story to watch back when stardust and 08th released
Gotcha gotcha
Does unit 3 have exam as well or just 1 and 2
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
<:CoconaSweat:480753608023998472>
I don't have much knowledge when it comes to blue destiny
That's probably why u count Ez8 since it was originally a ground gundam
I always thought the blue destiny units were just suped up GMs and Ground gundams
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
10? Hmm let's see... Original, GP1-3, Alex... Uh...
No wing huh
What about AU
Like what
It was a good finale in a way to the UC timeline
Yea he was
<:pikateehee:642525868509495299>
He's gotten every main char of Gundam up to unicorn at least once
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
It's bright noa's signature
U ain't the boss of me!
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
With no prior knowledge
<:MariaWink:688836868736811148>
<@87512939107450880> I just bought the Blu-ray of that
I watched like 7-8 episodes and dropped Clannad. Came back for the Tomoyo after episode. Best episode of the show
Oof. I watched the entirety of Yu-No. Biggest waste of my life. If Naruto didn't exist.
<:OchakoStare:642525126658621441>
Would anyone watch half of a 24 episode show while not liking it?
Maybe it was deemed to cost effective to build? Or the data of that fight wasn't recorded cause it caused the death of the pilot. So efsf has no idea of it's strength
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I never was good enough to unlock the better ending to thoroughbred that saved 04. Or unlocked the tv stages of oyw
I liked G04 and G05 from encounters in space
<a:MariaSparkle:688839288082792462>
*waits to talk about a different anime I enjoyed yesterday*
I love kuroko ~~no basket~~
Which if u made something better than the original source. No need to go backwards on it
Supposedly it was to be closer in line to the manha
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Because they wanted season 2 to fail
Rayneshia for the worst of it yo
Did her so dirty
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
Rip mirielle
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Grudge?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:MariaWink:688836868736811148>
Oh wait that was man with a machine gun
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Why u guys bringung up a ff8 track
Most anime change OP after 12 episodes. LH making me hate database cause it's used for nearly 50
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>
No other anime does this!
NO
If they do. I'm legit not even watching the show
So of course it only had one season
I only remember one OP
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
One season
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
LH is 24 long
What do u mean.
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Finally someone passing away at 90+ than 40-50. May your next life be great akira
Rip promised never land
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
So good
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
For real
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Somillhi. That's not possible
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
Wait digimon got delayed too?
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Took the win for me
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
S1 of CG was wild. While 00 was lagging behind. Them S2 CG dropped the ball and 00 came back strong
It was interesting going back at forth.
Yep
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
I am Gundam. Is the Gundam 00 trademark
Forgot about thay
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh yea. I have all of Gundam 00 on my phone to watch
Yea ignore that scotty
Don't spoil it solo
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Also Graham. Best male in gundam
Yea I really like Sergei too
I mean it got pretty bad for a few years. I feel like 2012-2013ish is when anime kinda started coming back into the groove
Like you could throw it into this seasons anime lineup and I'd believe it was this year lol
Cool to see someone watching Gundam 00 though. I look back on it sometimes and still think how good it looks
I agree it was very silly at first
<@456226577798135808> it's paradoxical to onlookers but as u get farther into the show it starts to make more sense when u get more of the reasoning behind their actions.
Man the thirst those girls have for bakarina. I really hope one of them becomes her canon ending
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
I agree zero. I was gonna say it's the FF7 of anime but then i remember ff7 is actually a good game just overhyped so FMA us probably the FF7 of anime.
~~except I actually liked this anime unlike eva~~
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
God that anime is easily one of the biggest shifts Ive seen from anime. The first few episodes are in NO way an indication of what's gonna happen in the back half
It's all good. Nothing wrong with that
But for 10 bucks I won't cry about it
I've been told that by many
Not yet but it's on my shelf for the future
Thank u  <@87512939107450880> this will make cleaning go much nicer
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Childhood animes?
I misread the game
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I sometimes kinda watch princess connect if I'm bored
Hamefura, bookworm and Gleipnir is all I need this season
I legit love how useless the main char dude is

Yea director
The story writer or director is the same person who did konosuba. I don't remember which
<:CoconaSweat:480753608023998472>
There's a lot of budget in peccorines pekos too
The animation is fucking amazing
<:KirikaSadQuiet:676150820592418856>
How dare u hate my bug
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
She's great. I wish the Quebeley wasn't such a brick of A kit
I couldn't watch that past episode 1. Too much of a meme. I appreciate how crazy it was tho
<:PREPAREFORMUNCH:673621434609696771>
I love Sophia. She's so cute. Anime albino
<:teehee:518810026769645571>
Mary competing with her fiancee and trying to make him not realize he likes bakarina is hilarious
to get back on bakarina. Mary is so thirsty for her and i kinda love it. i couldnt imagine a one sided love for years and years tho
<:ShirabeWink:672661604319363103>
I delete it right away. I'm an awful leech
I Torrent. And then buy animes I really enjoyed on Blu Ray when they aren't expensive af
Pretzel girl has the biggest thighs
<:HibikiEat:689192541404528664>
Left girls leg looks like it could snap like a twig it's so thin
I think her body is twisted like a pretzel too lol
~~or tortured~~
Her body looks so off
<:WhatThe:652958665413885952>
<@262326868366065664>  what's wrong with that girl on the middle roght

Oof
Two lovelive animes in one year?
Gravity warps around him cause of how sense he is
<:KannaSip:480753608045101076>
<@205859030051061769>  that's actually the protag of Infinite Stratos
<:StaresAtYou:622844417518206986>
I definitely thought Symphogear cagliostro first
<a:Kannaplay:710481312179421266>
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
Hail zeon!
Loved it
That fight was brutal af
It's not that trashy honestly. Sure it's perverse at times but it's almost uncomfortable cause of the atomsphere the show has
Mary's thirst
<:SamoaWave:598550922188292176>
Data Squad
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Skipping my favorite one. Season 5
I like Maria's voice
Remember when Visual novels got animes?
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Rip
<:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
Mayoi Neko overrun looks like a VN adaptation anime. I'm shocked it's not lol
Different strokes for different folks I guess
Man I did not like anything this dude made. I feel bad
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Dedication
~~even if I think the anime is doodoo~~
That's actually really admirable that he wrote the script on his deathbed
And then u see things like Louise the Zero and question how the hell it got 5 seasons
<:pepesnuggle:648972696436080641>
S2 of nadesico never
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
<@202536957685923841>  but what if there's no Novel or manga to read. And it just never continues
Im probably not an audiophile but I haven't seen any issue with bakarina
<:KannaSip:480753608045101076>
She's my runner up. I hope Mary wins

<@202536957685923841>
I NEED THIS

Never heard of marchen madchen until now
What's his full name?
That's hype
Brooo
<:Wowie:538976299167907843>
I try not to
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I feel like if Asuna and kirito ever broke up. All the girls would be like
<:StaresAtYou:622844417518206986>
Did something?
Philia is my favorite
If we include gamea
If we are anime only. Sinon is my favorite
<:KriisaNeedsPets:663171871067471878>
Also the anime portrayed it poorly but I totally think she should've died died at Sao end. Cause kayaba was too busy with y'know dying. But plot device!
<:StaresAtYou:622844417518206986>
~~if she wasn't kiritos love interest we never would've had ALO to begin with~~
Sure
<:KannaSip:480753608045101076>
But all the chars from the Sao VR game are pointless really
Cause she's a nothing character until apparently mother's Rosario? Which I stopped at ggo. So to me she's still meh
I did read the mangs one volume of oreimo which was pretty funny but the artstyle is different and different plot I huess
I never tried either of these shows
<:KriisaNeedsPets:663171871067471878>
That other one that was made after oreimo
What about worse oreimo?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I like Suguha but I hate sao
<:KriisaNeedsPets:663171871067471878>
Alice > Goddess Sinon > Asuna
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
I hate how she almost won the waifu war. And the Asuna came in and ruined it thanks to bullshit timing
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
Forget about yukine chros
How dare u
I could see Liz too
<:PREPAREFORMUNCH:673621434609696771>
Here's my chance
Lol
Neat. That'll make my friend happy
Isn't that getting a season 2?
I saw ash typing for a second lol
<:KannaSip:480753608045101076>
Ah it's a book
I don't know what that is
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Also the exposition dumps in especially season one was nauseating on a second watch
I kinda wish Symphogear had slightly less fights for the sake of fights per episode and more character development. But that's just me
Didn't I say to make my abilities average?! Is a cute girls doing cute things Isekai that has a sort of plot going on. Things progress and it can be dark at time but like 90% fun
But u do get a gem here and there
I feel like Japan is starting to stray away from the Cute girls doing cute things genre
But I have seen some people convert and watch lovelive or idolmaster
I'll still never watch anything that's not Zombieland
<:KriisaNeedsPets:663171871067471878>
Zombieland saga was the perfect bait to get non idol fans into idol animea
<:KannaSip:480753608045101076>
Do u watch animes that aren't Yuri or just strictly Yuri?
I feel like that list could be counted on a single hand or two
It's hard to enjoy a genre if that's all u watch sometimes. If u watch something out of your norm for a little bit it gives your brain a break and then u can come back to it refreshed imo
Usually have 3-5 anime a season this way to watch
I try everything that peaks my interest each season. Drop everything that I don't like by episode 3 and continue to watch the rest until they finish
I liked that they reference gundam

<:pepesnuggle:648972696436080641>
It's not idol but u reminded me I want a second season of smile down the runway
I have zero Yuri recommendation. I started to watch love lab and that looked like a fun yuri show but I never followed up on it
Then do it
<:KannaSip:480753608045101076>
<:youmusip:630936619758911495>
U underestimate me
<:reimusmug:631255478575300618>
Lol u speak like it's ever off
<:NotLikeKogasa:642833049603538945>
I know NTR as something very different
And Arte completely changed locations and I love it's new status quo
Tower of God surprised me and makes me char about chars I would've never expected
Bakarina was super fucking wholesome
Bookworm continues to be great
<:dankjerry:714622631797719581>
Next episode for gleipnir is gonna be a blood bath
This week's anime was really good
<:obama:610203350746660881>
Aot without spoiling had some really stupid deaths
Yes
~~like the other 5 girls~~
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Pay to win?
Also yes that too millhi
Fair
<:OchakoStare:642525126658621441>
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
Anyone else have a slightly harder time gettingo into older anime cause of slow pacing of anime back then?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:pokeblush:526120735132090372>
I buy Blu rays
<:Meguface:599090892732891137>
Imagine giving Funimation money
<:UsedToIt:714622630841417790>
Then pso2 happened
I used to have time
But I like owning things I love
<:homucide:572977615367962634>
In America?
<:Meguface:599090892732891137>
<:pokeblush:526120735132090372>
I would love a crest/banner remaster in bluray HD
<:ChrisCry:693199333113331843>
That battleship fight where u think the crew is gonna barely make it thru the fight
<a:animeJam:648201924163797024>
I watched crest of the stars
Broooo
Cross Ange was the best
Japan just can't accept homosexuality.
<@195044406343106560>  that's literally what I do
Movies I always grab in 1080p tho
If it ain't 720p I ain't touching it
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
And that's me only input on thag
Hentai manga is the best hentai
I love him haha
<:kid:690033871319990272>
<@115744398997716995> too bad khun was just a faker.
Even if it's only like 5 people
She does get her small circle of people she cares about though
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
She just wants to survive and hates assholes
I feel like episode one had unnesscary death just to pull people in like a shock factor with AoT
Yes
I need to watch that anime one day
O will say this. It's a memorable show. Easily a 7.5 or 8 in my book.
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I still enjoyed it
No need to care about a garbage family member
I mean. It worked
Super sentai Gokaiger was amazing
<a:MiunaCrying:642524338922324009>
I've seen a few interviews here and there and they're just so heartwarming
Life is unfair
<:UsedToIt:714622630841417790>
Why is Japanese television so wholesome
<:UsedToIt:714622630841417790>
I guess I liked them when they were just in gainax more.
<:Meguface:599090892732891137>
My hot take is studio trigger is popular cause people think they made gurren laggan too since it's quite similar to kill la kill
I only have a poster of akane

KLK was meh to me
Mainly cause I haven't watched little witch academia and that's like the one anime they made that might top it for ms
<@278860841485598720> I also agree with this
Gridman!

What was episode 11
Uhh
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
I think carols opinion is right
Downloaded it last week
It's on my harddrive
I need to watch the bunny girl movie
I agree
I mean yea
<:Meguface:599090892732891137>
I can barely watch one movie
U lucked out
<:homucide:572977615367962634>

The TV show had forever tainted it for ne
It's just...
I've always been told the movies are fantastic
Can't say anything for the movies
The TV show is for sure
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
I'm very curious how Uzaki-chan will be an anime. I thought it's manga was very short form
So is bookworm.
Hamefura is pretty fluff
If I can get 3 shows a season I'm happy with watching. I'm good
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
I have 5 shows this season that are great. 4 if u don't include sequels
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Summer has rezero. Everything else will be gravy

The posters in question

<:doge:496780220309962772>
I also really enjoyed how she spelled her name in blood
It was a b2g1 and I couldn't see anything else to grab and really wanted her 2B and Zombie land saga posters
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
Just dropping these here

Wasn't*
I never watched that anime. I was told it wasnt a very good gambling anime and to watch akagi instead
People like crazy
From what I remember at least
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
I guess my major complaint about bake that I don't have with BGS is how slow paced it is. I felt like nothing was happening in nise after I was like halfway thru. And bake was just so much talking and talking and nothing really happening until like the last couple of episodes
Yes
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
Never watched it but if the main char doesn get good until season 3+ Why am I watching.
I agree on the whole S1/2 thing.
I can't wait for S2 of that
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
That was a blast
Anyone watch the romantic comedy oresuki?
Top tier animes there
I'm just happy hamefura and bookworm didn't get delayed
Well I gotta punch in. So I'll be more sporadic with my posts
Yea
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
Huh. Next season doesn't have a whole lot. Guess I'll be watching rezero and billionaire detective and digimon for sure at least
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
I only read NT as New Type
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>

It hurts to read that honestly

Birito is almost kirito
I still have a hard time watching anime on my own tho
My bro helped me back into it
My best friend stopped hanging with me cause his gf became top priority so I dropped out of anime fora couple of yesrs
I got in a funk like that for awhile
Why is that
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Watch the dang movie ikxi

<:UsedToIt:714622630841417790>
Good question
*looks at all my one season animes*
It honestly shocks me there's books after this. I feel like the movie wrapped up the last plot thread the anime never covered
Im still in feel good mood from watching it yesterday
Bunny girl senpai
Not a fan of gatari
Nah I'm good
I went to go see some reviews of BGS movie and I see a lot of 2/10s. That's kinda extreme ain't it?
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
Still sad
Oh wait she's in poor health. Didn't die. Retired
<a:MiunaCrying:642524338922324009>
Even if the main char passed away
I want it so badly tho
Roghtt
Tanya the evil movie. And eventually when they get good rips. Princess principle and made in abyss movies
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
Same
I've got NGNL lined up next. And possibly the promare movie as well
Me and my bro are trying to watch an anime movie a week on relevant animes we enjoyed
So next Thursday (maybe sooner) is gonna be the konosuba movie next
I'm just glad the dumb ending of season 3 was retconned cause it was anime only
But now I don't mind it
It took me awhile to get over the art style change
I haven't finished it but in enjoying s4 more than 3
I do like highschool dxd tho
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Ah. I don't use reddit for anything almosy
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
I've never met a LoGH fan
~~also cause xenovia came in much later~~
Akeno has op Lightning magic
Cause she's only good at fighting with a sword
Queens are all around top tier
Rooks have great physical strength
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Not the other way around
Koneko has super strength btw. She protecc u
She's a Knight piece
No she fights with a sword
<:doge:496780220309962772>
It's just training
<:UsedToIt:714622630841417790>
Like she pulls out condoms to practice with the main char. Thinking it's nothing
Her personality is a fighter that's dense
Oh xenovia?
Rias?
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
She's a sadist but also very sweet to people she cares about
<@95698695701397504> the actual queen of the show

Reminds me of kirika VA. Who can go super high pitched but also very deep
Xenovia VA has a great range
What kind of pain
Beyond the boundary main char
For xenovia
Risa Taneda is the VA
How do I tell u voices if u never seen anything
<:pepewtf:695787684928684063>
<@95698695701397504> how about picking up girls in a dungeon?
Xenovia is Erina Nakiri from food wars
Rias is Maria Cadenzevna Eve
I'm gonna assume japNese
Japanese or english
Uhh
Everyone gets back story eventually on how they meet Rias and became her piece
U collect possible suiters/pieces through life
U need to be a certain strength to have one I believe
Every high ranking demon had their own chess set basically
Yea
Rias is the Demon that owns the chess set of chars I've been posting
When Rias already had her Queen piece
When it goes past 2. It becomes a harem imo
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>

Tho yun yun is my favorite
Yea honestly outside of her explosion derpiness. She's probably the most normal of the three girls
Konosuba movie dropped something interesting for me. The fact you can lvl up someone's skills for them

July 8th rezero?
In 24 episodes
<:Meguface:599090892732891137>
And two decently animated fights
Build divers had like one really good scene. Like halfway thru
<:homucide:572977615367962634>
Gundam build divers is easily one of the worst if not the worst Gundam series to date
This concerns me greatly

God I forgot they were getting 6 movies
<:UsedToIt:714622630841417790>
Would've been in april
I mean we getting a movie at least
So the movie should have a completely new VA for her
The woman who voiced the main char retired due to health
<:Meguface:599090892732891137>
I loved her
Rip Ange retiring from anime tho
Every episode was a blast. I think they did episodic quite well along with having a long arching plot going on
Unlike say haruhi that threw u in with no warning
I enjoyed princess principals episodic nature and going back and forth. Thankfully they had numbered cases to show when they happened

Just caught up with bakarina. Wasn't expecting a plot to kick in
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
Now u making me want to try to do a top 20 list
Did u lock it to one waifu per show or was it a possibility to get multiple
<:UsedToIt:714622630841417790>
I love Mai sakurajima but she wouldn't gel with me but I know I'd get along with butt demon or shoko
Lol
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
So when you say top waifu. What was the criteria. Like a char u enjoyed in the story? Or a char on the qualities if they were your actual gf
I dunno how I would even start to make a list with all the anime and games I've done
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
Like charlotte
Everyone else I've either watched the show or I know of them from said show
Ah fair
Your number 10 is the onlye one I don't actually know tho
Nah. We all like what we like. That's what makes things interesting
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
Maple is just too much of an adorable derp
I couldn't not add those two xD
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
I was honestly really critical on my list
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Cause we have great taste
<:UsedToIt:714622630841417790>
<@453836798796234762> what I've got so far
It's not in any particular order yet tho
I'm done
So making my list. I was very selective and really only ended up with around 30 girls. It was done very quickly though so I might've let some go thru the cracks atm. I also discluded games or animes adapted from games cause that would've made it harder. Gonna start culling the fat to get down to 20. <@453836798796234762>
It's so bad
Dont
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I legit think the potential of the Symphogear chars got wasted really.
Way better
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Not to word this in a way that makes the Symphogear girls bad but over 20 years of anime watching. I just found over 20 girls better than the Symphogear cast. I still love them don't get me wrong
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Honestly I skipped over Symphogear quite easily when I was doing my top 20
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
That's the thing. U are comparing a 1 season character to a 4 season character. Shouldn't that show how much better the one season char is?
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>

I also have dumber Maria with steph
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Xenovia is the blue haired girl and she was my third option
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
But rias is just so loving and caring. She won me over
Yes I was flip flopping between her. Rias and ~~character u haven't met yet~~
It's sunday. We ain't open
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
All of them are so good yo
I'll probably reupdate this list as I think about it today.n
Such a fun cast
Lol yea Mii was great
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I'm glad Nintendo go rid of Miis personally

I'm so out of my depth when it comes to harems or highschool battle animes.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Arata the legend. Was the anime. It did something I personally never saw in an anime before and shocked me
Not that one
Nah
It was savage
Arata... I remember an anime with that chars name
Yes
I barely tolerated S1 and that was cause of Alicia Alcott
<:kid:690033871319990272>

Amagami and photokano were neat ideas
Sakurasou was pure depression. Dropped that halfway thru

I mean maybe  a couple more episodes to notice the love
Sounds like a rushed ending
Oh can anyone spoiler me that show? I stopped around episode 5 or 6
i dont have any shows spilling over into next season
mannn
best thing this season bar none
RIGHT?
wheres my bookworm season 2 announcment
made me feel emotions!
was great!
also BOOKWORM
honestly if theres no plot. i dunno if i'd be interested in more hamefura
i figured she died of a heart attack cause no girl likes seeing facial hair growing
i wasnt even aware lily was a boy until someone mentioned it after the show aired
but who knows the intention of the studio
as far as im aware
seeing as lily was a boy dressing as a girl. i would probably would go with cross dressing since i feel like japan doesnt really bring trans up in media.
agree to disagree
ill protecc my zombie waifus at all cost
i know u aint talking about ZLS millhi

The only SoL with Sunchan in it that I watched was Oresuki
I still need to watch the origin movies lol
<:youmusip:630936619758911495>
Sure
<:KirikaFish:717138469381734471>
<@202444817043685386> <:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
Oh they have similar voices then
<:youmusip:630936619758911495>
Macross frontier is a good starting point zero
<:KirikaFish:717138469381734471>
It's been so long
I forgot Sheryl was Nana
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
Sheryl nome is bae
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
I guess I just don't remember any singing in robotech
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
I think Macross frontier was the change in genre
No
<:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
There's no s at the end
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
I assumed gund
To save on animation
Has a lot of reussed scenes
Seed looks really awful looking back.
Seed was during the era where everyone was moving from cel art to digital so a lot of shows suffered during the time of learning the new tech
I'll try out god of highschool too only cause I loved tower of god
I got rezero. That's all I really need next season
Well written chars both main cast and support cast
Actual story telling.
It was such a change of pace to standard anime. So refreshing
Easily my favorite new thing last season
Tower of God was fantastically
<:kid:690033871319990272>
<:Meguface:599090892732891137>
Did this not do well in theatres?
Forreal. That ending was totally meant to be like and here's s2
<a:MiunaCrying:642524338922324009>
I watched the no game no life movie. Why was this so fucking sad
I can understand the hype behind promare. But honestly I almost fell asleep watching it
I feel like I should be watching this dubbed
I like Lio the most so far
I REALLY don't like garos voice
So i started promare
FBI open up
9th grade. Knows she stacked and how to use it
Anyways night guys
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
Super Saiyan 1?
An episode here and there on adult swim
<:kirikagreenfish:727160747334959206>
<@203444794737950720> anime
I'm curious how the anime will adapt all the inner monologue
I mean... I have played video games where tanks actually are useless. It's just very... Uncommon
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
Once everyone stopped hating the MC. I was like... So it's just a standard Isekai now with nothing unique to it?
I'm eh on it.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Hey if it works. Cool. My bro enjoyed the show
I couldn't even imagine 75 episodes
That's true
<:doge:496780220309962772>
Maybe they'll sweep it under the rug and hope people forget
Don't see the logic there
It's okay. Definitely doesn't deserve 3 seasons
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
Milim could be 900 or 16. She's still a funny character
<a:MiunaCrying:642524338922324009>
Can CR make NGNL season 2?
<:UsedToIt:714622630841417790>
It's better than three seasons shield hero
It's a chill show and I love milim
Supposed to be this year but covid pushed it to next year I think
<:homucide:572977615367962634>
Reincarnated as a slime. But it's really any 24 episode show that's cut up
<a:MiunaCrying:642524338922324009>
Why do good animes have to be so expensive to own
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
I want tog 2
Forreal?
<:youmusip:630936619758911495>
Just don't buy things
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
Like sure it is
I love seeing Netflix original on anime
I hate preorders that take your money now. Do a deposit of 10% or something
<:UsedToIt:714622630841417790>
I would love if they removed the purple hue they added into s1
Blu rays
When is English Symphogear happening
That seems outrageous
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
Do people really pay 50-60 dollars for a 12 episode show
But back to anime pricing
<:Meguface:599090892732891137>
I mean u had two dumbass highschooler gamers and a dumbass college student (probably drop out) gamer.
<:UsedToIt:714622630841417790>
Those poor kids
I mean I would've felt bad if he did have kids
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
Filo being voiced by milim just made me love her that much more
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Are fucking dumpster fires
But bow and Lance dudes
<a:YoumuDance:721504539311734824>
<:youmusip:630936619758911495>
Since he saw reason and logic
And notkirito was probably the most tolerable side char
Filo had all the best parts
Like bookworm
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
5) there are better isekais to watch
<:homucide:572977615367962634>
I spent 8 dollars on this Blu Ray I'll never finish
<:UsedToIt:714622630841417790>
I wanted to stab my eyes when they sat around a campfire for like a third of an episode trying to tell an unfat girl that she's not fat and just has large breasts
I dropped grimgar a couple episodes in. It was super slow and boring. I hear it gets really good
Ohhh happy sugar life
Same I'm looking it up right now
Thanking back to 2018... I think Hinamatsuri may be my favorite new anime of that year
What's in dec? Lol
Yay...
<:UsedToIt:714622630841417790>
Oh boy. I get disappointment for my birth month

Symphogear!

Gonna get a deen s3 too
Log horizon...
<:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
At least u got a s2
<:homucide:572977615367962634>
U don't know true suffering until u watched a great anime with no s2
2018 was a fantastic year of anime
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
Wait violet was 2018?
I never watched pte
<:homucide:572977615367962634>
Golden kamuy... I never finished that. That split was... So disappointing came back for one episode and dropped it
<:youmusip:630936619758911495>
I am referring to new animes. Not sequels or spin offs
<:kid:690033871319990272>
It's not tho
<:youmusip:630936619758911495>
2018 was bunny girl senpai. I can stop looking. That's anime of the year
Oh whoops
Ohhh 2018 was also planet with... That's my currenct top anime of that yesr
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
I think 1991 was my worst year. Me being born and all
I freaking loved HSL. It was the most amazing Trainwreck I've ever seen
Yea I was expecting something similar to shalltear vs ains in s1
<:Meguface:599090892732891137>
I was really bummed about the ainz vs hero fight
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
I could see that. Id take lizardmen over whatever s3 was tho
I feel like I'm the only one
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
I liked the lizardmen arx
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Hey Crunchyroll S2 of tog when? <@152896851660505088>
I'm pretty tired of overlord personally. Half the dialog is SASUGA AINS SAMA
<:homucide:572977615367962634>
God I hate albdeo
<:youmusip:630936619758911495>
No. I want more garbage isekais
<:UsedToIt:714622630841417790>
Sometimes that's a good thing. I hear shield hero WN is the edgiest thing wver
<a:YoumuDance:721504539311734824>
Bookworm world building is the best
<a:YoumuDance:721504539311734824>
What you're looking forward to this upcoming season of anime. You have good taste so I'm curious what's potentially watchable.
Dang
<:homucide:572977615367962634>
<:kirifishmagenta:727160994761146378>
Oh I actually wanted millhi for something else
Millhiii
I would assume max leveling hero would be next then
Oh oh for  any book readers. Are there any animes this coming season I should try? I really only have rezero and God of highschool on my list atm
Probably
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I want the breaker to be anime'd
Hey I'm down
I'll be hyped
If god of highschool is as fresh as tower of God is
I hope so
I wonder if they're trying to start something
Interesting that we got two animes in the same year based off webtoons
I only know of the webtoons thanks to hero cantare
<:CoconaSweat:480753608023998472>
Other than one char gets... Really hot
I have zero knowledge
Of course. I hope it's another great show like tower of god
Fire
<:KirikaFish:717138469381734471>
<a:YoumuDance:721504539311734824>
Enri is best girl. She's so adorabs
<:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
Cause we didn't get any good fights that season
Is it out now?
<:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
Lank u posted a blank space
Just finished that
Relights looks fun
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
Just watched demon Lord school. I don't know what I watched. And no idea where it will go. <@87512939107450880> <@279341087494242304>
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
And out of those 13. 2 maybe 3 looks appealing.
I only just realized how many shows there are
Yea
Man talk about a light summer. 13 new shows and that's it from what I can see.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
You basic af
Man if this is how all Korean stuff is like. Japan u need to step up your game
<:doge:496780220309962772>
I love how easily she was won over for the fake sob story
<@202444817043685386> Mira is my favorite.
I'm super happy god of highschool looks amazimf
I had this job since last year
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
I'm going grocery shopping. But I'll do it when I get home right away
Just got off worj
<a:YoumuDance:721504539311734824>
<:youmusip:630936619758911495>
Seems easy to me
<@114081181611458563> multiple extreme life or death situations where he did anything and everything to help/save them.
I like the green haired one. But they more respect each other. I do like how subaru ess like if i didnt have a number one or two. Youd be there
<a:animeJam:648201924163797024>
Im hypes for after worj
I havent watchws it yet
Also klein
<:homucide:572977615367962634>
Lets me and my wife and my group of rejected potential gfs play these games
And a wife
I mean ram is kinda a third. But its really just a love triangle
<:kirikagreenfish:727160747334959206>
Melua dont kill. Thats bad
<:Meguface:599090892732891137>
I only watched one epjsode of shirobako but jesus that guy
Oh for sure
Emilia hasnt given me a reason tonlike her more than rem at this moment
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Its easy to joke. Cause i love rem
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
Who?
He was easily my favorite char
<a:YoumuDance:721504539311734824>
Old man knight is way stronger than him imo
Hey i guessed right. I mean hes barely been shown at all in the anime. I dont see the issue?
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
Red hair guy?
I dont know what guy u refer to with all the blessing
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Subaru
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
Whos this perfect person in re0?
As a gamer it drives me nuts it ignores so much shit they themselves explained
Because sao has video game rules they they ignore and makes it a shit show
Real cool of u
Wow. Way to look down on anyone who likes the show
Sure
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Rem has the dog fight to really open her eyes to subaru
Because on all the not fucked tries. He continually goes above and beyond to help/assist them with whatever they needed. Yea he broke and one point and emilia bailed on him like she shouldve but he redeemed himself
Subaru has clearly stated his love for both emilia and rem. While kirito jist gets more bitches for his harem by being a gary stu
Nah nowhere near the same.
But he has a wife so they dont try anything
And they all love him
Yep
Im gonna miss hour long episodes
<a:YoumuDance:721504539311734824>
It was fun
I watches the reairing
<a:MiunaCrying:642524338922324009>
Dude his VA died
Al?
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
I mean shes a half elf right. If shes only 16 that makes her like 8 right?
Beatrice is my favorite char
Shes a fun char
Im told ram gets some time to shine soon and that makes me happy.
Shes nowhere near perfect. She even says so. The person subaru sees isnt the person she is. I really wnjoyed that convo they had when he broke basically
Yea shes got a wonderful design and i love her huge amoint of hair. But she rrally doesnt do much
Poor sub quality. Washed out colors. Skipping here and there
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
I mean if they look good on your tv. Thats fine. But the one i saw was a definite downgrade
They MIGHT be legit in that country but malaysia is definitely one of those cpuntries where u find fakes more often than not.
Yea my mondaiji taichi came fron malaysia. Looks significantly worse than the usa version
Thats 100% bootleg
U can find date a live season one dvd only but not season 2 and onward
Funimation stopped making dvd only animes
Its definitely a bootleg. It reuses the s2 box art
If u look on the back. It should show funimations logo someowhere on it. If it doesnt then its abootleg
Youre usa right?
Or singapore
Usually from china
Oh have u not seen aftermarket animes?
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
That kinds looks like one of those bootlegs that crams everything into one box
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
Bruh the camerawoman said the cows dead
So no tipping me
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
No they fall over and usually have to be put down cause they cant get back up
Im a cow
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
I am no sheep!
I refuse!
<:UsedToIt:714622630841417790>
It reminds me of the whole. Sao alo is season 2 and not arc 2 season 1 debate
<:kid:690033871319990272>
People are dumb
But yea the main reason i state that is cause the finale of qoute season one ends with to be continued like any other episode would and season 2 episode one just continues the plot. And the end of "s2" has a different end card compared to the usual to be continued
Loke golden kamuy
Inb4 the dvd/blu rays are season 1 part 1 and 2
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
Season 1 was 24 episodes split into two halves
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
2

Season 2 of bookworm???
Foreeal????
Peter grill was like 2 fps
Monster girl doctor had a lot of janky movements and cgi
I assume its cauze of covid but man almost everything looks animation wise pretty poor
Re lights or whatever it was called seemed decent. And uzaki chan could be fun as a nothing meme show but i could drop it at any moment. Guess this is the rezero and god of highschool season
Man there is really... Nothing good new this season
<a:YoumuDance:721504539311734824>
Its sunday everyone. time to try out all the new shows and see if we have any winners in this hot garbage of a season
<a:YoumuDance:721504539311734824>
Cant wait to see aria and cocoaa opinion morph as plot thickena
Gleipnir was fantastic.
What id that
Im gonna eatch it after work

The show was fun tho. Ill give it a few more epz
Of course. Gotta stay cultured
<:youmusip:630936619758911495>
Uzakis mom > uzaki
Also the show did a flash back of her with longer hair. And she looked better back then
I like uzaki for just her trash personality. Her looks are irrelvant in this regard
Wait is that two brides
shouldve made the arisen female imo
Its a capcom game
Same. I disliked the show after s1 and when i went to the manga after thay
Thats a good sport
<:doge:496780220309962772>
Makes this picture make so much sense that i had
<:doge:496780220309962772>
<@453836798796234762> i didnt know her shirt said super huge until the anime. Made me lol quite hard
Yea. It never happened again. But it was just so jarring xD
It reminds me of the infamous bear and fire cgi from golden kamuy
<:CoconaSweat:480753608023998472>
Either have stellar cgi or none at all. Ruins shows
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
<@278860841485598720> define another level
Its animation was pretty doodoo but i feel like thats every show this season
Gibiate was weird af yo
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
U got it?
<:smartpepe:580800532394934460>
And then he gained new life in a world where he can trach children the fun of gunpla
Im gonna get all the zeon MG at one poiint. Even if most of them are old as dirt
I love that video
Is this the part where hectan explodes?
<:smartpepe:580800532394934460>
<@226789636989517824> gouf mg is much cheaper than that. Ive seen them sold for 30 bucks
I heard gundam
I might give thst a shot
After ep 2 lol
Someone was telling me demon king was so bad its good
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
Everything else new was pretty hot gsrbage from what i remember
But i could droo it at any moment
Im passively watching oppai loli. Cause it has potential.
That. Deca dence, lapis relights and rezero are the shows im watching this season. (That i actually look forward to)
But now its back
Only 2 eps ever aired
It got covid
No.
Im so happy billionaire detective came back this season. Now i have a funny show to watch.
Her hair is what bugs me personally for some reason. They showed her once with slightly longer hair and i think that looked better
Thsts a couple of the jokes. Its a lot of slap stick humor.
<:KannaSip:480753608045101076>
Yea. But that body type does exist. Its just super rare. So i guess i dont see an issue with it
I forgot about senpai magician girl
Ahhhh. Its sorta like that. Except the main char actively avoids the girl in this one.
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I dont know what that anome is oclisto
The chemistry along with their back and forths are pretty good
As an introvert. Im liking it. Its funny
Is that why its so slow at times
Excited for 5
Im guessing this is when it starts being good
<:KirikaFish:717138469381734471>
I just finished ep 4
<:smartpepe:580800532394934460>
~~wheres priest guy on level 2~~
Im curious now
Pics?
<@87512939107450880> side note shiho looks like purple maple
Its pure boring right now. 2 eps in
I understand
My second comment is more for anime protags in general
<:KirikaScared:672584678993297431>
Also shit for brain protags. Just stahp
These dumb things annoy me
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
I wanted to face desk so hard during this scene in grimgar
Random question. Why are there so many anime girls that think theyre fat when theyre either skinny or average size but with big breasts.
See im the opposite. EVERYONE told me about it at one point. I thoght it was okay. Doesnt really get good until white/black hair chick is introduced which is past the half way point
Demon lord highschool actually got really good episode 2 and on. Was just laughing at how crazy it could be
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
What more u need
The charactwrs are fun. Good comedy. And great action..
Yay!
<:Meguface:599090892732891137>
Nobody watching god of highschool. The best show this season
Im a happy boy
God of highshool
Billionaire detectice
Appare Ranman
Rezero
Digimon
Deca-Dence
Lapis Relights
Demon School
So this season of anime while not being huge is actually pretty decent. ~~when u  add in some of the shows that rrstartrd from last season
~~jk nothing wrong with liking it~~
<:NotLikeAlice:706995168074792982>
*imagining watching more than one episode of gatari*
Digimon
Wait goblin slayer got a movie already?
It literally never gets close to that again.
Slime's goblins are best goblins
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I mean D&D goblins are pieces of shit last i checked. So i mean its par for course
Its horribly jarring
Just draw the guy
He aint even that detailed
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
LIKE WHY
Well it worked i guess. But god it infuriated me how goblin slayer himself was cg 80% of the time during scenes where theyre jist standing talking
Did that first episode really pull in that many viewers?
<:Meguface:599090892732891137>
By why was it popular. The story is so bogstandard boring.
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
I didnt know a goblin slayer movie existed until like two days ago and i just have to ask why
Theyre a breath of fresh air
This and tower of god just make me want more manwhas made into animes
For me personally god of highschool is already trucking most of the new anime i watched this year. I know u not a fan lanks. But its ticking all my boxes
I got 6 decent shows thanks to two returns from last season. And rezero. So im happy
I prefer this over OPM personally so far
<:doge:496780220309962772>
Having a baby with a deep voice killed me
Demon school got amazing when it hit episode 2. Had the best joke of the season so far
I wasnt super into it until episode 3
<@278860841485598720> whats your opinion on lapis relights? Its honestly quite funny. Episode 3 especially
Lol
Lol hope you two enjoy adachi
<a:YoumuDance:721504539311734824>
Im one of the only joy people
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
I wonder how bad ep 2 of gibiate will be
But it was worth it in the end
<:CoconaSweat:480753608023998472>
Grimgar was such a slog
Im so hype
<a:BikkiPowerDab:688190074219003996>
Now i can force him to watch tanya the evil
Oh btw. Finally finished grimgar with my bro
I mean. I enjoyed that episode more thsn all of GS. So i agree
Mass murder hanabi
Elfen lied is trash.
<:pokeblush:526120735132090372>
God of highschool
<:yuuki1:647988654345551922>
It wanted to shock oeople like aot
It becomes bog standard fantasy adventure
<a:6477_Pout_Child:730232910271086713>
Chihaya

<:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
An inferior chihaya
Oh...
<:MeguFace:480750533968396288>
We talking chihayafuru
I heard chihaya
Man sometimes sonic boom had some great dialog
I mean i still haveng watched axz or XV
Hot take. Symphogear needed less singing/combat and more character development and personal interactions with the cast
Zombieland saga is thw only one i nees
Where these are all the same 2 girls
Its funny cause this makes me think of kiddy grade
<:Meguface:599090892732891137>
Theyd never do that tho causw then people wouldnt buy merch of their unpure idols
<:youmusip:630936619758911495>
What if they really did a love live where the new cast were the kids of the old cast
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
New love live girls looks.... Nowhere near as good as the last two sets
At least i get a s2
<a:BikkiPowerDab:688190074219003996>
Why suffer in idol hell when you can have rapping zombies
~~anime was a mistake~~
<:youmusip:630936619758911495>
Its almost like anime has run out of unique character designs.
<a:6477_Pout_Child:730232910271086713>
Took me WAY TOO LONG THO
My brother has been enjoying tanya the evil btw. Im glad i finally got him to watch it
<a:BikkiPowerDab:688190074219003996>
Great 15 seconds
https://youtu.be/qrsIjalEmA8
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>

<:teriderp:732938093400817724>

<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
We can go off topic for one second cypher. We tlaking ahout all anime
Same
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Mal
I also thought dwath notw took a nosedivw in qualitg when m and n came onto the scene. Made L much less unique
I wanna rate everything too
No
I should do an anilist onw day

<@279341087494242304>
No! Its real solo! A woman (and a guy) are transported to a new fantasy world and inhabit the same body. With only one ablw to come out at a time. Theres also fantasy mecha like escaflowne
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
Man does anyone remember Maze megaburst space or is that jusg me
Tough boy reminds me of Junk Boy from the Maze anime cypherr
Which char
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
I dunno if i could pick a favorite of all time... Maybe Lina Inverse or Yamada Tae
Oh yea that did get a second season huh
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Dammit amq. I read your text and wrote it
Shouko is my favorite after the movie. Before then it eas futaba or butt demon
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ah! my goddess?

She was such a hugd derp
She loved banannas xD
Chocolate best girl

<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
Oh

<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Ehat the hell
Oh wow. Maze was 97?? Jesus i thought this was hella older
<:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
Arent*

<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>

~~id probably only put the symphogear girls at B rank at best~~
Anime was a mistake

<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>

Hi aria
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
The only char i liked eas the blonde who was fake nice
Akira mamiya?
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Why is ichigo there. I know hes a badass but damn. Even getting on the waifu list
I googled her. I have no idea who this is
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Im sorry what
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Asuna isnt eligible cause shes married to kirito
I like himiko toga genuinely. But she isnt even my fav char in that anime
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Fucking asuna
Whos hachiman
Good
Okey
They should do  a yearly one for just husbandos and waifus of that year too
<a:6477_Pout_Child:730232910271086713>
NO U
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
I know who kanade is
<@453836798796234762> first pic u dingus
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
Far right girl... Is that corpse princess or princess lover?
<a:MiunaCrying:642524338922324009>
None of them are mine solo
Check mate
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
If conan is so smart. How is he not an adult yet after 1000 episodes
I just enjoy anime with friends
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Whats a community
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I like shibas
Rip doggo
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
Arent most boys considered tsundere since they show affection at a young age by teasing or pranking girls they like and getting mad if someone points it out
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Bruh megumin and aqua were in the same brackett? At least move girls from the same shows into different bracketts
I have yet to watch it
Does she do sruff in the movie?
Viktoriya is thsf liked?
Way better than that hatcher man
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Issei is dah best
But theyre all high quality girls
I prefer xenovia
<a:mmmDasNice:642524253690003497>
Rias gremory
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Ah the anime i skipped csuse it eas another unattractive or angry looking male with no friends who somrhow gets to spend with all the hottest hotties of the school
Night amq
<a:Chris_rage:653963371053318144>
YOURE RANDOMIZED
No. Pants are pointless
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@279341087494242304> do u recognize

i dont remember that girl in food wars honestly
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
Cause hachiman doesnt have the balls to do that
I almost bought a figure of her once
<a:6477_Pout_Child:730232910271086713>
It aint mine
Sup solo
I jist found a pic
No
<@213645184125239317> thats a pwrfect grade strike next to it. And one of the biggwst MG the deep striker

Massive. It does exist
Ik
Its a cool kit

The closest thing we will ever get was that GP04 Re/100 kit
Bandai needs to make a white base. Or other battleships
<a:6477_Pout_Child:730232910271086713>
<:pokeblush:526120735132090372>
Wait... This would be perfect for a MGEX
<a:MiunaCrying:642524338922324009>
I hate how th kshatriya will never have a MG cause its wings are so huge they have no way to support them
<a:6477_Pout_Child:730232910271086713>
Also why hasnt the lobster mobile armor gotten any model kits
~~i love the neo zeong and its 8 arms~~
Haman best girl
Cause they never happened millhi
Mg or hg
<:smartpepe:580800532394934460>
<:youmusip:630936619758911495>
Aya
Also
She uses an old mold but i wanted to try one. Also shes one of the best girls of gundam
Yea bandai kits are on the cheaper side. And they jusy keep getting better
Shes a completely new mold vs the older kits and has much nicer body proportions
Can make her full robot or human
The best one atm is
<:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>
Bandai are leagues higher sadly. At half the cost. Im happy bandai is trying their hands into the waifu kits.
<a:YoumuDance:721504539311734824>
I just won a MG on ebay
Yea i want to try a zoids HMM csuse people tell me thats like the highest quality plastic
I really dont like kotobukiya plastic
She on sale for like 15 bucks so i said why not
This one

Shocking i know
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
I did the body of a cheap Frame arms. And stopped cause it felt cheap
Thats a long time millhi
Bruh
@ iski
<:Meguface:599090892732891137>
I wanna try frame arms or megami device. But theyre so color innacurate and i have no painting ability
Too many things with the same acronym
<:Meguface:599090892732891137>
Also FAG is short for full armored gundam
Cigarettes are bad for u millhi
<:youmusip:630936619758911495>
Millhi would never buy me then
If they EVER (whoch they wont) reprint it. Im buying it
Lmao was just about to post that
Look at that box lmao

I mean. Have u seen the HG neo zeon? Its like 2 feet+ tall
More interesting than emilia at least
I do enjoy echidna for the one scene she was in tho
He already has a number one two and three. She needs to get in line

Just finished tanya the evil movie. I need more.
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Super size it
Too bad they wont fit on a MG
Neat
Ohhh lol
<:KirikaWhat:671948299179130885>
> of course now you have to track down the HG 1/100 for its twin saber, lance, wire hammer, and rocket pistol
<@64565434468282368> 
What
<a:YoumuDance:721504539311734824>
Im so excited
Double X gundam is coming home baby
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
I wasnt expecting the ebay seller to accept my offer of 30 bucks. Im a happy boi
Forget to update provably lol
It was all a dream
Yoshino is the only spirit from s1 i like
Im a Miku and Yuzuru fan personally
<:youmusip:630936619758911495>
I dont like kurumi. So yes
Dal2 had better spirits
It was really weird and out of nowhere
Wasnt much of a fight
Only the last minute was good
It felt like filler
Yes
That close up looks like the chick from madoka
That was random af
Cautious hero?
Wait what
Episode 10 of s2. I feel like shield heroes group is prettt underutilized. They did have one good joke tho.
They played the opening once at the end of an episode
Or when aqua stuck pencils up his nose when he was time stopped xD
Him asking albedo the succubus for *that* was amazing
Best jokes of isekai quartet was with kazuma
Its a good joke
Upon giving it a second chance after watchinf re zero for the first time and rewatcjinf tanya. I quite enjoyed season 1
Oh yes. I must apologize for an earlier statwment that isekai quartet was bad
No subtext
Why cant we have legit yuri. And legit het romance
<:smartpepe:580800532394934460>
Shovel knight
What
World war 3?
Just watched the goblin slayer movie. Man that was boring. Just one big fight basically...
Also yoo mira getting hurt
It was bad and pointless really
I guessing virgil won?
Wait who won with hiei vs sasuke? Cause i woild vote hiei
I remember when voltron nuked megazord
<:youmusip:630936619758911495>
Guts vs claire wouldve been a better match up
Even his own cousin he said he had issues with and she just trains in kendo
Bruh kirito would literally stand no chance
I did think the first half was stronger than the second half
I was a little sad they didnt do another time skip for the two sisters only. Like that one episode of the daughter and the mom
Just watches the special and the movie for violete evergarden. Was not expecting maria and hibiki to pop up in them
Right?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I mean sephiroth got beat by a blonde kid with identity issues
<:MeguFace:480750533968396288>
Anyone cane be beaten if you cut off their head
Not gonna lie. I know close to nothing about either char.
Rip lol
Cocoa is next level trolling me
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
So what about all those girls who enjoy BL of straight guys. What does that make them
Guess im homophobic
Also ||best girl died for no reason in the manga||
I was like. Yep this is too dumb
I bounced when eren had a power ||to control other titans||
<:ChrisThinking:692829670382632981>
I rememeber AoT getting really bad after season 1 manga wise. Did it get better?
Chihaya is the best i agree. Season 4 when
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
The shops daughter is way morr appealing of a char
<:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>
Its a joke series
I mean her being mistaken for some child is the joke.
So my sense of belief was gone
I dont think it was bad. I just disliked it ignored its game rules for the plot story
i mean its an easy way to show bad man is bad. and make us hate and want his death
<:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
I see u nevis
<:smartpepe:580800532394934460>
I do much research. I aint no newbie
80 bucks is like a scale figure price. Im currently watching this one on ebay for 75. (Worth 150. I hope nobody bids on it)
Thats way too much money for just a nendo. Oof
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I remember watching the first episodr... And thats it
I wish i could get into K-on. I love mugi
Newgame+ wouldve been a great name
How dare they
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
Isnt linkle that female link with crossbows?
<@64565434468282368> wut? Whats going on
Promise neverland was fire
Im trying to remember OPs that i enjoyed im recent memory...
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Some ops have really banger songs but the imagery doesnt match up so its wasted
I googled hanebado. Whos the MC?
Its frustrating
Ive definitely had shows where i wish the rival or antagonist won over the protag cause i feel like they deserved it or i just found them to be a better person
Worst MCs how exactly
<:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>
Symphogear EDs > OPs
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
I used to like database. Then they reussed it for s2. And overused it
Oh btw. I started higurashi with my bro cause he wanted something horror esque. And MAN i forgot how bad mid 2000 animes look yo
My brain tends to shut off
And zero i feel the same
Only if youre a cannabil
That makes sense
Ohhh
Do they taste good?
Whats a book?
<:kirikagreenfish:727160747334959206>
Gotboredoftheseriesatthispointgatari
Ill take your word for it since i stopped at sistergatari
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Lank that list looks a little... Biased
So is the short hair the rival?
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
https://youtu.be/Gvtraav5RK0 now that FT is over. Can we get this remade?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Good old inferior Rave Master
Just draw the fucker
Hes not even that detailed
Like why
It pissdd me off how often he eas CG in a scene where hes just walking with everyone
i wasnt
~~i noticd the goblin slayer CG every time they do it for no reason~~
<:homucide:572977615367962634>
Yea but 2000s suffers the most thanks to the switch from cel art to digital sadly.
Trust u with what?
When shit from the 90s look better. Its oof
I knowbbut it LOOKS awful
Yea... I remember the dub.
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
I hope shaman king remake is good
I stopoed when they defeated crocodile
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Ive been debating restarting one piece and i have no idea why my brain is doing that
<:homucide:572977615367962634>
To
I try not ti
Anyone remember the orphen remake?
Rip lol
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Cypher not even watching his examples
If anything my bar is too high. Lol
<:youmusip:630936619758911495>
I dont go to the bar
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Gottem
Thats not a high bar
Booo
Elle looked decent still
That ova made me so mad. haru looked so awful
I know fire
Whats tweened?
We cursed
Imagine the world if naruto ended at naruto.  We arent on the proper timeline guys
Even bad games or shows
Most things are enjoyable with other people tho cocoa
<:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>
If i want to watch a battle shounen ill just rewatch yu yu hakusho
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Black clover? Gross
Thank u hanabi
Ahhh
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Still havent explained tween
He looks like some bitch the protag had follow around as his gopher
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Natsu vs zeref
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Punch, fly, awkwadd screen change to shoot a ball, burn away, punch punch punch. Insert random long frames here and there
Oof that fight was bad.
But god powers are way better
2nd season was better.
It had 2
It still drains stamina like no other or something
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Like why
It kinda annoys me that with all their power they gained. SS3 is still an issue?
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Anyone else hate all these other color hair forms? What was wrong with just blonde. And the blonde with lightning
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
U got the kaio ken. Death has meaning. Lots of tension
Saiyan arc best arc of dbz
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
Remember when trunks was cool? ~~anf had purple hair~~
<:GWnoneMeguDed:480753608573321247>
Piccollo smart. He always trained. He jist wasnt a saiyan
Like what if another freeza or androids or cell come up
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
True. But gohan from age 5 had to deal with alien monsters for most of his life. I would train on the off hand more shit like that hapoened
And then videl couldve learned beam attacks and we couldve had a husband and wife kamehameha. and eventually a family kamahameha with gohan, videl, goku and pan
<:MeguFace:480750533968396288>
Like an actual martial arts story
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Did we become best friends?
Bruh hanabi
Then they removed her pigtails
Bruh videl couldve been great
<:yuuki1:647988654345551922>
And chichi HAS to realize he is the fuckimg savior of earth. With no goku around. And its not like it matters if he dies with dragon balls
Hey im the strongest person on earth. I defeated the big bad cell. But ima stop training and get weaker so if something else bad ever happens i wont be able to stop it. But my dead dad can handle it right?
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
When did it take gohan like 20 years to realize you could balance study and fighting
Ignore me typing UI again
<:MeguFace:480750533968396288>
Also if goku can combine Blue with kaioken. Can i get a SS2 Gohan with bang down?
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Goku with silver eyes
Also anyone prefer imperfect UI to perfected?
<:ShirabeHeart:738932033635483738><:KirikaHeart:738932018116821034>
I wouldnt know. I never watchrd super
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
But theyre the only thing worth watching now
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I said when. Not if
I wonder when theyll make another dbz movie
Too bad i only watch dbz dubbed
<:smartpepe:580800532394934460>
You know goku sure loves the Kamehameha. Why he never make the Kamehameha 2.

~~where my season 2 of many things~~
Anos made a tsundere admit her love to him episode 2. Theres no stronger protag in existence
I hope its doing well in japan. Its got one punch man feels with its absurdity
I think theyre pretty different but that might just be because Anos ususlly has a smug smile on his face. Vs forever frown/deadpan face
And fun
Hes way cooler
No its the guy from demon academy

I missed the nendo postinf
Oh shions arc was an answer arc? Huh. Still thought i was in the question period
And yea the question arcs go for to long. Me and my bro are Finally hitting the last one.
Less with the year and more with it being deen lol
I only watched chihaya cause ive never heard a bad thing about it and got the blu rays for cheap
Thats a good possibility. Its also shogi so i had zero interezt in that
Guess i skipped it by acciddnt
Oh huh back in 2018
It did?
Where ryou anime
^ about to say the same thing
And not just 3 seasons of 12. 3 seasons of freaking 25. My bro made a joke that this card game about poetry is one of the longest animes hes watched
I mean at least in that category i like it a lot more than other shounens.
I know its a manhwa but is this in the shounen category?
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
Child jin crying saying he doesnt want friends and only wants his grandpa made me hella sad
I like the back and forths with the main chars. The show has some really good random funny moments
<:doge:496780220309962772>
My bro was like. HOW THE FUCK DID YOU KNOW
I was happy tho when ||she got her god and i was like OH SHIT IS THAT MY BOY LUBU?|| thank u dynasty warriors xD
Yea why even bring it up to show her
<:doge:496780220309962772>
YOu StUpID LiTTlE GiRL
Glad its back on track
Killed the momentum lol
Yea
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But without (only one episode) filler
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Angry jin is best jin
Latest episode was so good
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
God of highschool has been so interesting. And confusing. But i wanna know more. Their world is so strange and nobody questions any of this strange shit
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
This season has digimon, demon school, deca dence, rezero 2, billionare detective, lapis relights, and god of highschool. Its a great season for me personally.
But you dont really know
Its like satire but also not satire but its so over the top it has to be satire
Its so good
Everyone is sleeping on demon king academy
Well not all shows succeed
It seems more like a moe blob of CGDCT. Rather than any comedy
What if cells at work. But if we reversed genders
Dont get too close. U might get stuck in his gravitational pull
<:notes:754049600863600841>
Its like a national geographic. Seeing such a dense protagonist out in the wild
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
U can have fun with bad shows
<:notes:754049600863600841>
Looking at their catalog now. I feel like they have a varied array of animes. (Ive never watched but know exist)
But me not liking bananafish is more the authors poor writing than the animation crew
But i didnt like that show. Looked hella nice
Oh wait i saw bananafish too
I havent seen anything older than that outside of terror in resonance by them
Really? The three shows i like look very diff imo. Dororo, inuyashiki and Zombieland saga
So i gave it a shot
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
I like mappa
U didnt miss anything
It was never funny
Also i hated how they tried to make the elf going :X a thing
And that was like ep 1 or 2
The wolves ragdolling the main char was probably the best part of the show
It was pretty af at times. But god was it unentertaining
Priconne was so boring yo
Definitely the hidden gem of this season.
I honestly expected lapis to just be another generic CGDCT anime. But ended up being really funny (which i feel a lot of CGDCT lack) had a large ass cast of chars that honestly felt pretty fleshed out. Great animation and being able to change tones on a dime
Anything past ||their debut song|| i havent seen
I need to watch the last 3 or so episodes still
And the horror tones were better than actual horror shows at times
Lapis was fucking hilarious. Whoever wrote it had great comedic timing.
Yea tsundere chick id probably rate last place or tied for last place
Cecillia at least has a bombastic personality and always tries to make herself center stage which is fun
I got nothing
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
God thinking back. Im trying to think of a single good trait of the other four...
Yes
Uhhh... *Starts counting*
Cecillia was my favorite
But i also repressed a majority of that show
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I dont remember it having really any good fanservice.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I dropped s2 after the first episode
Prepare for it to get so much worse
<:MikuOhMy:744629583713796128>
Oh god
What episode u on?
Many females do. And they cant escape. Why else would they be near him
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
I want more super sentai released here
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
I hate seeing their fucking logo in god of highschool in the ring
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
They also funded doctor stone
Are u sure about that
🏴‍☠️
I miss when the world was just netflix and hulu
~~i dont want to pay for a billion services~~
I can always hope
Dang
<:MikuOhMy:744629583713796128>
Will that make crunchyroll suffer
Remember when some japanese companies announced they were going to drop their animes on youtube for free?
I wonder if the market will ever crash from these insane prices they ask for
No millhi. We can only have moeblobs that sell 300+ dollars wads of plastics
<:derp:498362036309327883>
Oh they did No6. That was super yaoibait in hindsite but i also rationalized it as it not being our world so a friendship kiss between two guys could totally be straight in their world
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
I mean. Looking at symphogear fandom. Nobody likes bait. Just go full yuri or yaoi
They did carole and tuesday right? I heard that was really good
Rip bones
<:youmusip:630936619758911495>
Well as long as utsume doesnt ruin the show in the last 5 mins like BF. Should be good
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
<@278860841485598720> what
Ill give it the yhree elisode rule
<:MikuOhMy:744629583713796128>
Interesting
I enoyed watching a military raised orphen girl go thru the motions of learning how to emote
<:ChrisWave:744465189596037168>
<@279341087494242304> it does not cause u dont actively dislike the shows since u never tried them.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I mean thats like studio trigger. Flasy but no substance. But people love that
Hey it worked. I cried
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Violet
But for some reason they still refuse to release them singularly here in the good ol usa
They dont do it in europe or japan
For america only
Anyways
<:MikuOhMy:744629583713796128>
I cant watch studio trigger stuff? Oh no
At least not to anime
Very true
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
Like they were usually just meh. Not wow this is hot garbage
And when theh did miss. They didnt miss as hard as some of these shows
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
I wonder if anyone actually stuck with gibiate and found it good
Gibiate wooo boy. I wasnt expecting to see ps2 graphics in the year 2020
But yea crunchyrolls list of anime. Is like 60-75% misses. Not many really good animes there. At least they did mmo junkie and APFTTU
I have yet to meet someone who disliked ToG. While i do know a few people that are at worst luke warm to GoH
Not that ive seen
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
PTSD
The master of ragnarok?
Wait...
That people hate
Which ones are CR original
I tried like 2 eps and stopped. Curious if it became a train wreck
Oh hey did anyone watch that orphen reboot thing that happened?
Looks fun. im probably just old but god that song was so unappealing to listen to
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
And yea violet evergarden will be shitting on animes a decade or more from now pretty wise. Especially if we keep getting things like gibiate
To me
ToG was what i like to describe a story using animation as a medium. It had none of the standard anime tropes. It was a breath of fresh air
~~ew kissing~~
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
Like why watch boruto when u could watch a good show
I ask that about a lot of shows people watch
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
Im still salty best boi dies at the end of the series. Why cant he have a good ending too
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~u can still enjoy shows if theyre not gay~~
Shes so boring!
I DONT SEE THE APPEAL OF LAURA

I was like that with cells at work. I had fun but i didnt need to see the whole thing
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Loli and harem?
Nope
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
Are you high right now? Im concerned. U saying the craziest shit right now
Main char has so mucb swagger and none of the bs. He can do something? He fucking does it without excuses or plot devices
Its like one punch man but better
Its great yo
I like how demon misfit has an actual chubby girl. Shes so adorable
<@504069701911969803>

Remember when sekirei went out of print and thosd 10 dollar blu rays now go for over 100.
<:worrysalt:541110950548209676>
Blonde was my favorite
<:ChrisWave:744465189596037168>
I liked sekirei
*owns negima on dvd and thd remastered blu rays*
I had to google those number 1 and 2 animes
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
Solo needs help guys
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
IS was the straw that broke my back for harems.
Yea
I aint scaling this like video games where a 7 is bad
If 5 is average. 4 is perfectly acceptable for a below average anime
Season 1 is a 4 for me and s2 was a 2 lol
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
Just cauze theres even worse harems doesnt mean we should accept this one lol
Not even a good one like DxD
Finally get an exo skeleton mecha anime and its a fucking garbage ass harem
I just hate this show
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
I mean theyre all boring but shes like second worst
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Im tired
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
The whole brother scenario was fucked up
I thought it was interesting. Forgot why i didnt keep up
Oh right this
Whats magmel
That was fuckdd up
I remember the battle royale manga
Im in a car
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
I didnt know this movie existed
not invented it
I SAID MADE IT POPULAR
I also really enjoyed the variety of girls
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Pre fortnite
This was before battle royales were popular hanabi
<:youmusip:630936619758911495>
Go all the way or not at all
<:MeguFace:480750533968396288>
And had great fanservice
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Just like S1. I cant wait for every new episode
Ecidna best girl. And the suffering has been delicious
What? S2 has been amazing

When ||otto screamed at patrasche|| i fucking died
Humanoid*
<:AYAYA:541110950577700894>
Patrasche is my favorite non human character in anime in a long ass time
<a:MariaSparkle:688839288082792462>
Also otto has shot up to best boy
Especially these last few eps
S2 so far has been wild
<:pepesnuggle:648972696436080641>
I want more rezero
Just with less forms
<:notes:754049600863600841>
Erza weapon is the spear version of the rave sword basically
<:pepesnuggle:648972696436080641>
~~remember when hiro reussed Rave masters unique weapon in fairy tale?~~
<:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
~~Rave master remake when~~
<:pepesnuggle:648972696436080641>
Its so quality
Its crazy cause this season was so small already. So why did it get ignored
<:pepesnuggle:648972696436080641>
And never see lapis relights on these charts and its legit funny and nobody watches it
From the 4 episodes i watced. Its not even that good. Its passable but like not amazing. Just average
I dont get people man
What
Uzaki being above misfit demon king?
Looks like female that one space pirate dude
Go on

Fuutarou... Is that the betamale from 5 hot girls?
I am impresswd they got the whole cast back for inuyasha minus one
Inuyasha wad so good. The final act was awful tho
<:pikateehee:642525868509495299>
Get deep into characters in shounen
Also i didnt know asta was anti magic
Cause if you cant yeet a castle. Are you really a protagonist
<:321979828670562304:732938092419219476>
Why have negation when you can just overwhelm your enemies with absolute power
His VA makes the char

I dont know
What do they do
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
I liked mappas dororo
I think like halfway or 2/3rds thru they revealed it
That was the running mystery cause she we never credited in the ending either

I bet i could get a cheap apartment in japan on the fourth floor room 4
Yes

<a:Wave:417219766848061450>
Bye peoples
I dont think its a 10/10 but its definitely not awful either. But now i must head to work
I guess i like how jin can be funny at times and is already making his own original moves (way sooner than other protags in the shouen genre usually)
thinking back. Outsidr of filler. Dbz doesnt really have much in the way of comedy right?
Daewi is easily the weakest of the three protags
But probably not
<:teriderp:732938093400817724>
For now. Jin only had a single 13 episodes while goku has had hundreds. Jin could still change
That was funny to me
*remembers that shounen crossover where ichigo is the only non crazy eater and just sits there shocked at all the others*
Mori also wants his friends to get stronger  along with him and not just himself. And has goals outside of just strength like finding his grandpa. Like he has more than a singular brain cell that goku has wherr all he wants is strength plus stronger dudes no matter where or how he finds them
As a fan of dbz. I honestly dont see too much similarities outside of they both want to get stronger and fight stronger opponents.
Theyre both based off the same person. But i think theyre vastily different
Theyre sun wu kong
But better
<:teriderp:732938093400817724>
I mean even with its lack of plot. Its better than a good portion of animes that are just copy pasted of previous formulas of established animes. (Looks at all the isekai and vrmmo clones)
<:teriderp:732938093400817724>
Yet waste an episode on a pointless marriage
Its definitely one of the more confusing animes. But i liked it cauze i had zero ways to predict what would happen next
I liked the characters and comedy it had along with the fights
<:SataniaThumbsUp:730232913706221678>
But if thats the worst thing youve watched. You mustve watched a helluva lot of great animes so its all gud.
<a:ChrisShiftyEyes:744451987831128126>
Thats a hot take
<:pepesnuggle:648972696436080641>
Also he himself has progressed so much mentally. Learned so much too. Im so proud of subaru
Subaru has like half a dozen things he needs to stop this run
They were much smaller less complicated conflicts tho
<:SataniaThumbsUp:730232913706221678>
The foundation was laid in s1 and we got all the juicy steak in 2
S2 has been better than all of s1 imo
<a:ChrisShiftyEyes:744451987831128126>
If they dont got two legs. Ima pass on the monster girl
Whyyy
Love ep 1 and 2 tho
Oh. Im not gonna click that. Havent watched it ywt

Nooooo
Star driver kinda disappointed me. I enjoyed it first but the longer it went on the less entertaining it was to me
<:MeguFace:480750533968396288>
Star driverrrrr
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
Compared to other shounens. I super enjoyed it cause the main char isnt trying to be the best or the hokage or whatever.hes doing everything for his sister and getting stronger helps his goals.
18 mediocre episodes? Thats kinda harse. I feel like the only bad episode was zenitsu introduction episode
Which can be annoyinf sometimes
If i type in anything gundam related i get model kits over the actual anime
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Maybe she did lots of shark research and now she gets animal results for things first
<@504069701911969803> sometimes depending on your region or previous search histories u get different results vs someone else

<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
I mean star driver is more entertaining than singing girls. U cant beat galactic pretty boys
Its a feature
Majo no tabitai is so freaking good yo
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I mean its not wrong
At what
<:MythInaAYAYA:768478245342806046>
<@676272618839605249> i am aya yes
Cause she has a personality
But better
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
Best girl is a super derp gremlin
I got isekaid to a demon school was really good umtil the second to last arc and that ruined the show for chances of it being a top isekai. Still a great show tho
Non weebs that get isekai are such a breath of fresh air
Bookworm hands down
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Then dont
<:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
Konosuba has a good dub
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
Its like why
So ive been watching hunter hunter. And im halfway thru chimera ant arc. It got really narration heavy and its starting to annoy me
Yea i dont rewatch stuff usually anymore. Unless its good fighr scenes
Currently getting thru huntrr hunter
Never seen keijo. Its on my to do list
I just cant do dubbed anymore. Especially from sentai filmworks. They tend to be the same 3 females and it drives me nuts lol
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
Interesting
Didnt try it dubbed
<:MeguFace:480750533968396288>
<@456226577798135808> if u havent seen it. Please do. Its such a good anime
Im curious who they got to replace the main heroine
The shows episodic but it does a great job. I thoroughly enjoyed every episode
So much potential squandered in later iterations
Man back when ben 10 was great
~~realizes a show isnt for everyone~~ but still kinda surprised when people say they dislike rezero. Hell i ignored it for years cause everyone talked about constantly. But when the reairing happened. It was a blast
<:pepelove:552925136349560856>
Thanks voy!
Hes made much progress mentally
<:happypepe:613385497640697867>
Gotta shoot that nuke
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
For has massive as the dendrobium is. That seems oddly low
I cant watch atm
Music? <@87512939107450880>
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
<:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
They nuked a chick from s1 from 2nd division and that made me disappointed
Oh u know what i think i did watch a little of season 2
<:pepewtf:695787684928684063>
How does one jail someone with a coefficent below 100
<:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
Pp3 spoilers ||akane is in jail and thats ehy shes not the main of 3???? What??||
Yea isnt Gen uroboshi notorious for never wanting to do a second season?
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Im just confused how they keep making sequels. I mustve been the only one who felt satisfied with just the first season
Oof. She looks very unlikeable
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Im guessing new girl is the one with the bitch face
I just saw a poster for s3. I recognize nobody
<:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
Whos the main char if its not akane
<:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
<:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
Theres a s3?
Booo
Thats the main girls name right
Hows akane in it? I mainly wanted to watch it cause she became (i assume) a badass
I never watched s2. Loved the first one tho
Ah
Whats pp1 and pp2
<:KanadeSit:535301654464036884>
Everyone loves girls
Im a happy boi today
I also found a sheep singing gundam seed ops

Bookworm has such grwat world building
Because its top tier
Bookqorm best girl
Unless the retcon the movie out of existence and do something else
Its pretty finalized
I legir couldnt see a sequel to 00
Lol no degurechaf
But man i want a (good) new gundam show
I couls be misremembering
Pretty sure sunrise said they were moving away from the standard gundam formula
<:happypepe:613385497640697867>

Why do u watch them then?
<a:headpat:778268299486036009>
The fun of opinions
Its fourth season was pretty terrible tho.
I thought season 2 was great.
<a:coco_bang:728966444813123625>
He must be purged
Archer is a glitch in the system
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
<@115579492059185152> why does it say obj at tje end of sentences?
Forreal? Oof
Nah. When he was saved by a new big tiddy elf. And louise went back to her baka baka baka state before her realization she love the main char. I eas like OH COOL back to fucking status quo
Mad
I watched... Two seasons and dropped the show. I got so mas at the deus ex machina ending of the season
<:ChrisWave:744465189596037168>
I wasted my time with that!
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
I say this when i only factor in s1
Its basically one punch man but better imo
Such an unexpected gem
My aoty
It was man
<:MythInaAYAYA:768478245342806046>
U think killing me was enough to make me die?
<:happypepe:613385497640697867>
I think my fav was when ||he broke out of time stop with the cheezy. U think stopping time would stop me?||
Yea yeeting a castle was definitely one of the top 5 moments
I never got tired of him shitting on everyone ever
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
God. After having anos as a main char. I question why we get all these angsty bitchbois exist
Yep
I expected garbage but got hilarious events. Some actually well animated fight scenes. And the most badass protag with oldman syndrome
Its so fucking good
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
Isnt dubbed precure just sailor moon?
Is that that girls surviving on an island anime?
I tried
Whelp
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Fuck ive seen this already
Ill pick... 37
But like anime in general
Its crazy to think of this medium of entertainment is full of unfinished shows
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Questiom for yall. Why do we watch anime? 99% of them never finish and just leave us wanting more
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Marida
The color changing is definitely a gimmick tho (that i like)
<:MeguFace:480750533968396288>
<@145705908716961792> it had two giant swords that combine. And was purpsely made to have easily replaceable top and bottom halves as well as backpacks to keep fighting even when damaged.
Destiny had... Impulse and destiny. Thats about it
At least GS had cool mecha designs
Which gundam seed is just a worse original Mobile suit gundam
Just a worse gundam seed
Fuck destiny in general
Didnt it only ever kill one user
<:KanadeSit:535301654464036884>
Remember when zesshous killed people? Good times
Better than climax song
Im okay with that
What do they translate zesshou to?
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Sunbeam?
Even the G discs that release in jan
I mean rightstuf
They were like 50% off already at discotek
<@274279989506211841> next year i was told but i dunno the season
Im so hyped for it
Zombieland saga season 2
<@782841825069236236> now that i think about it. That was literally gundam double X. She even brings out gold panels
It was so good
Yes
Season 1 chris swan song. Best swan song of all of symphogear
Id watch that
Yea im surprised an animated power ranger doesnt exist
<@87512939107450880> wheres my @
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Marida is also top tier
Any UC g generation game that has it. I make sure to get it
Also i love the quebeley
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:MythInaAYAYA:768478245342806046>

<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I dunno why i like haman so much. Maybe it was the lack of strong females in anime back then
<:MythInaAYAYA:768478245342806046>
<@99695384296701952>
Because gundam is suffering
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
And a big plus. ||She doesnt get murdered like most UC girls||
Easily one of my favorite gundam gals
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
She looks so good with updated graphics
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Roux is pretty in general
Honto no kotosa!
<:MythInaAYAYA:768478245342806046>
Anime ja nai!
I love u melua
I get it
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:MythAmeliaStare:755597695267241984>
We talking about domon?
||glasses girl hurt me the most.||
Cause animes that make me feel emotions is good. The worst thing an anime can be is boring
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Best first episode in anime in a long while. Too bad it doesnt stay that good
Its funny u mention nsfw. Gundam is like thw one thing i dont lewd

<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Cypher u ready for this
I found my favorite haman art
Oh cyoher
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Like millhi
I also love cute shit
I thought i was going crazy lol
Thank u millhi
<:KanadeSit:535301654464036884>
I prefer hardboiled eggs
Or bang dream
The middle girl looks liek s2 girl
Is that love live?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
A broken clock is right twice a day
I dont like the upgraded freedom and justice
The only decent design was the destiny itself imo
Also why id everyone using zakus in destiny when the buster and duel gundams are still functional. Why not upgrade those?
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
My nerd brain gets mad that the upgraded freedom is called the strike freedom. What part about it is from the strike
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Letd make a third side thats right
<:KanadeSit:535301654464036884>
~~and then for them to be used against zaft~~
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Oh really the freedom and justice gundams huh
And preachy
Kira is fine in the strike gundam imo (actually has to  kill people). I feel like when he gets the freedom in seed. Is when a good portion of those issues start to happen.
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
Im biased cause hot oppai samurai sword wielding babe
Only 75 to go
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Real osmosis jones here
U might like black. It follows a decaying body of a middle aged smoker who doesnt take care of himself
Im in
Black looks way darker and has a badass female protag
But yea its kinda boring
It was cute and gave us platelets. The cutest fucking things ever
Cells at work season 2 and cells at eork black
Yes
Im gonna watch cells at work black. I got a little bored of the og saga halfway thru
Im so hyped for rezro
<:ChrisWave:744465189596037168>
<@201242768524312576> time to watch all those first seasons
Been gaming instead
I mostly ignored this current season. Only really watched danmachi
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
From dying of thirst to drowning
Promised neverland, quintuplets, dr stone, re zero, slime, beastars, log horizon. And thats just anime thats returning
<:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
I did not realize how fuckdd i was next season for anime. How will i have time
Must suck being in the shadow of jesus
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Man remember when cagalli could do stuff
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I remember the constantly reussed animation of 6 zakus shooting it and reflecting back the shots
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
It cant hurt me
~~destiny doesnt exist~~
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
Bucue?
Er
Also. Where did the cgues go. I loved those zoids
What the fuck
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
The first picture looks okay...
I didnt even know stuff happened after X astray lol
That turn delta looks like a worse red astray
Or was it an astray after the original
Those were stargazer mechs right?
Ahh
Wasnt it astray tech? Cause they could also do that which was basivally ejecting like massed heat or something into a functional weapon.
Man the destiny impulse gundam. Is so good. What if the imoulse had dope wings
But i liked the backpack of the og one
Oh true. I like that part
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Just do something silly each episode. Like changing the VAs or doing funny accents
DAMN if JYB idea was done. The dub wouldve been great
How to fall from grace so hard
Man in glad i never picked up s2 haruhi
It was a sad day when crow became popular deckwise and kicked aki to the wayside
Its nice having a show that doesnt insult your intelligence
<:ChrisWave:744465189596037168>
I highly recommend it
<@454822882045067298> its like the most possibly generic sounding isekai but ends up being quite entertaining. Not doing any cliches isekai stuff. And does a lot of things u wish happened in shows but never does.
Kenja No Mago. <@454822882045067298> u ever see that?
It reminded me a lot of a differnt isekai i expected to be bad but wasnt from last year
I mean its comjnf out in july. So i cant imagine much
Couldve been hype
If there just was a bit morbudget
And animation
I definitely expected it to be trash but wadnt
So i finished the sorta isekai im standing on 1,000,000 lives. It wasnt bad. But it also easnt really good? It got better right near the end. I look forward to the second half in july
As someone who only watchdd the og anime. I think the one whos obssessed with tanks is the worst one. (Not bad by any means tho)
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Man imagine a hololive anime where the girls get isekai'd into a gameworld
I hope the zombie anime next season isnt shit
Digimon data squad is my favorite
Huh
I c
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
Is rerise better than divers?
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Ez8 vs a dragon
I want my gundam to fall into a fantasty world
No i mean
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
Can i pay bandai to make a gundam isekai
I prefer real robots but im totally okay with gundams doing stuff like shining finger sword with shinjng gundam or the ZZ gundam have a beam saber that can grow in size to cut a battleship in half
I can buy 2-3 MG gundams for the price of a zoid
They cost too much
I want bandai to get the license for zoids
<:yuuki1:647988654345551922>
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
I need this
On anilist
Yea i like using .5
Im trying to binge all the shows this next week or two so i have no backlog before hell breaks loose next season
Oh munou no nana was a really good show. Tho id only rate it like a 7.5ish
I basically only watched danmachi for most of that season
I had a hard time getting into any anime last season honestly
If it keeps up the high quality
Jujutsu kaisen is pretty close to a 9 for me
Cause it was also legit funny
I think the comfiest show i watchdd last season was that sleeping princess anime
Probably why u had more to watch than me xD
I just find a lot of shows boring. I realize a lot of shows are made to be comfy fluff shows. But i need drama or action or story progression
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
I must be picky then
World god only knows mentions oprah. And highschool dxd mentions the tide pod challenge
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Man. Saw a video about some bad dub lines... I wanna go back to not knowing
Kudos to u cause there were quite a few stinkers last season.
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Thats basically every anime from last season
Anything more than that and i start dropping the not amazing/really good shows
I think the most ive ever watched in a single season was like 10
18 shows not in brackets
Thats a lot of shows
Thats less?
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Why didnt they reuse the LH ED? S2 has a diff one
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Overloard has 3 banger ops for its three seasons. Why cant log horizon
But how hard is it to make 2-3 good ops for a show
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
If theyre all bangers. Yes
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Hxh has lots of ops. What u talking abiut. New arc. New op
I didnt think kaguyasama could get a great op that could top s1. And bam s2 banger happened
Because fucking laziness. Why cant we have multiple hype songs? What u a one trick pony
If they reuses database. Im quitting anime
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
I feel like i had ps2 games that looked better
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Bruh ex arms
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Please let season 3 be better than s2
So whats everyones most looked forward to new show next season and returning show? (Sinces theres loke a dozen season 2+ shows popping up)
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Ah. I thought that was more yuru camp
Fruit tart?
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Ive been spoiled by other cartoons
Was that worth watching? I stopped after s1 when their LARGE SCALE BATTLE never showed any soldiers and it was just the  princesses and archer dude
Holy shit u right
Wut
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Sounds like me!
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
But golden kamui and bookworm have season 1 and 2s... Sure cause u can produce a second season in less than a year
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Re zero has a split cour but u dont see them calling the second half season 3
Like theyre very obviously a single season.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
It drives me crazy when the industry calls split cour showd as season 1 and 2
Oh and that moriarty show cause people tell me its good
Akudama drive
Kuma kuma kuma bear
Maji no tabi
Are the main shows i need to binge. Nothing else really i interested me this season. 
I might try the two animes with kami in their title. 
Finishied standing on 1million lives easily a 6 or less. Pretty meh
People are stupid causs they see stat numbers and assume
Its a fantasy show
Its not
<:yuuki1:647988654345551922>
But if its like outbreak. Then id say its not one either
I never watched gate
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
Huh
U know.. i never considered outbreak company an isekai cause they can come and go between borh worlds. So i thought of it as a parallel universe show instead
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
People can be wrong
But they arent transported to anothrr world. They log into a game and just cant log out
<:yuuki1:647988654345551922>
Nah. First part is just trapped in a video game.
<:wtfinspanish:741882995614679043>
Isnt The alice arc the only actual isekai part of sao? Since kirito doesnt really remember the irl world
Isnt the isekai part of sao the small portion you are defining it by?
Man what a joy
I expect dean to disappoint me with both SDS and LH this season
Satelight was s1
No they didnt work on s1.
<:yuuki1:647988654345551922>
Because s2 obv had a smaller budget. Using an inferior company to animate
<:MeguFace:480750533968396288>
<:wtfinspanish:741882995614679043>
Wait its in space?
I look forwaed to the doujins
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
~~why not both~~
<:CoconaSweat:480753608023998472>
She hot
Also replacment lucy is way more appealing to me
Happy day to me!
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>

Oh great. More work for Happy's VA
~~i feel like im the only person planning to eatch spider isekai~~
Hibiki tachibana reincarnated as a spider should be fun too. Gave me slime vibes
I missed that show
I want slime so badly

<:wtfinspanish:741882995614679043>
Who?
Fuck that was a good movie
Man can we just talk about how enjoyable your name was
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I feel like suggesting anything is similar to smarthone isekai is mean
<a:ChrisRage:745358256242688102>
~~fuck hermes~~
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I would sooner say danmachi is a not videogame like sao over a not isekai
<:yuuki1:647988654345551922>
Without the isekai
So then all fantasies are isekais
<:wtfinspanish:741882995614679043>
Just not logged on that site
Ah she did
Sounds just like sei
Also i thought mikako did the voice of arte from arte
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Hype

When theyd have no interest otherwise
His gravity pull makes all these girls stuck in his orbit
That boi is the densest protag ive ever seen
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Ichika lvls?
How strong is his powers?
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
How will the main char punch people with friendship in space?
Space shounen
Yes
Ibo has so much potential that i feel was squandered in s2
<:KannaWave:480753608543961088>
00is probably the best AU. With G being campy goodness
<a:MythKoronePeek:771033961676931142>
Gundam X
Nah i found it stupid cypher. ||Especially since it was the literal last 2 mins of the show. By random shooting. Why even bother at that point. Let him live||
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
:someone liking s2 ibo
Millhi: im about to end this mans career
<:KannaWave:480753608543961088>
Millhi is the best
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
||especially orga. He got so many death flags i thought they werr going to let him live since he accrued way too many over the course of the show to a comical degree||
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
S2 death flags were atrocious. Is it not possible to kill a char without making it painfully obvious anymore?
What
Like wgt
I didnt like how they built up this princess thru s1. Showing her cunning, able to get things done thru words and not fighting. But then. S2 happens and she does nothing
Im in
Revenge story u say?
<@279341087494242304> <@202444817043685386> tell me more
Anime ja nai
<:notes:754049600863600841>
<@278860841485598720> in the anime universe or the actual fans irl?
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
All panty shot angles are out of place
Youre a part of the problem
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Millhis message made me think she wanted nana s2
Oh fruit tart
Fanservice?
I want s2 of talentless nana
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
<@87512939107450880> the ibo revenge kill in the final episode was probably one of my fav kills
I need an anime to fill munao no nanas shoes
Darn. Maybe next year
Synopsis sounds great
Can this be an anime too?
<:poopdust:553799017016983554>
Reading...
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
I mean. I can be down for revenge porn here and there. Feels good watching assholes get their comeuppance
Oh i think i know my bros favorite anime for next season
Worse as in the treatment?
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
Like is the healer dude a dick to everyone or is he got a main antagonist to get revengebon
Just watch dxd for harem
The density of that image is unreal
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<@87512939107450880> why did u post a black hole
I was already tired of its shit midway thru the ep
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I dropped s2 after 1 episode
Damn. Full on maso here watching s2 after 1
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
There are no bad clones
<:rushia_stare:730408949865775104>
Doesnt look as good as carnival phantasm
Chill. It was a honest mistake
I like seed. Still
No guys. Dont torture him to watch trash
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Kira becomes holier than thou once he aquires it.
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Imagine the show if kira died during the encounter with athrun and he had to deal with the grief of killing his best friend and cagalli having to step up to the spot kira left open
Freedom gundam is when it goes downhill to me
I think all the parts with the strike is good
U didnt miss much
<:rushia_stare:730408949865775104>
Yea just an oversight im sure.  But the implications
But it was the legit middle. Thats cray cray xD
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<@202444817043685386> i just posted he tried to kill in destiny in the gaming chat
<:rushia_stare:730408949865775104>
How about now?
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
We werent?
I unfriend u
God its basically 8 years old already
<:wtfinspanish:741882995614679043>
Gundam build fighters is getting close to a decade. And that will always be perfect
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
The content... Is debatable. I havent seen it since release
The op still slaps
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Usually harem ecchi cause i had no taste as a horny teen
Oh i remember a ton of bad shows
Like point to great old shows and question why shows this day arent as good
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Doesnt change the fact its great
I never knew that
Huh
Isnt it the strike gundam?
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Wut?
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
Are there any gundams that are classified as a gundam but dont have the word gundam in their name?
So neither does this
<:poigun:787491222171942921>
Cpr doesnt count
That looks more like oxygen circulation to prevent drowing
<:KannaWave:480753608543961088>
If melua gave me a good way to watch danball senki. Ill start it to talk with u. I loked the 3ds game a lot
Hey melua did u watch divers rerise?
<:notes:754049600863600841>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
*looks at non symphogear spoilers chat*
noice
how have those been? i only ever watched the first one.
if she was on model. sure lol
how does stuff like that get green lit
god gibiate
Well after the shit show of s3 ending. I can completely understand the want to work with a diff studio
I know im late to the party by i like the new designs for dxd noe
<:rushia_stare:730408949865775104>
Sounds like dbz
Remember the panik caused when the little girl was found to be an esper?
Because ostricize people they dont understand/fear
Hyobu kyosuke s2 when
I feel like wonky CG is a given
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
But it looked good from the trailer
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
I liked power ranger toys as a kid
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<a:NotSoHabbyCat:751165396886880297>
But i love him
<@199928870810419200> i think u like yanderes
I was not expecting the yandere waifu eithr
Final dungeon gived me one punch man vibes when it comes to his power lvl vs standard people
Maybe they wanted detailed(?) Farther away models?
Like why
Reminded me of goblin slayer when they cg him for just walking
Curios on the cliffhanger ending
Final dungeon country bumpkin was funny tho. I enjoy the power gap
So... That picnic show... Was kinda meh? Ill still watch it to episode 3. But it didnt hook me at all
Gran turismo
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Like Dragonball GT?
The scifi with two girls was... Okay? Definitely didnt make me crave a 2nd ep
Or hate it
Back arrow was super dumb but i MIGHT enjoy it from its sheer stupidity
Ive got that and like 4-5 oterr shows to try lol
Nope. Its on my to do list still
Still need to watch a few shows
There were some really good surprises so far this season.
 Final dungeon boonies is legit funny. Its like reverse saitama. Being op and the only one to not realize it.
Hidden dungeon is harem trash but... Also quite entertaining. 
The demon kid one looks to have the most interesting plot of the new shows and i like its artstyle.
Skate the infinity was also really well animated and had some good jokes
Spider was actually kinda boring, i hope it picks up otherwise itll just be a worse slime
Uncensored is subbed? Nice. Been looking forward to this
<:emithumbsup:775400079552282664>
My bottom is Yu-No
<:emiconcern:775402888137670686>
I mean. We all make mistakes
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
Why would u need any episodes to tell thats bad
<:emithumbsup:775400079552282664>
Like Ex Arm
Well obv some shows are very bad and u can tell to not watch them ep 1
Three episode rule exists for a reason for anime! Hasnt failed me yet
I mean. Trying is at least better than not trying.
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
But marth has no projectiles to deal with fox
Is the ninja supposed to be sheik. Or marth? Since i feel like marth is a close match up to fox
<:GermainAngry:689199996653928451>
Obviously
But ninjas are better than foxes
*highfives keupho*
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
<@87512939107450880> did u watch ex-arm?
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
I guess i dont see the main char at all cringy since i do know people who hate life and escape into games or books. Never trying and just being secluded.
Im really looking forward to seeing the growth of the main char.
<@213645184125239317> bottom tier character tomozaki
Understandable. I actually like that mentality of the female MC myself
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Lank writing a lot
Really? Why
Kirito?
Im gonna really enjoy that one
I dont remember the name. But its this guy who a pro smash bros player but sucks at life. And gets another smash bros player to help him not suck at life
Oh man i totally forgot about my most liked show
1080p is just a waste of space
<@87512939107450880> i inly watch 720p
Lies
<:GermainAngry:689199996653928451>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Anyways thats all ill say before melua sends us to symphogear discussion channel
<:donaugh:775404640736641066>
I actually prefer season 1 art style. Theres just so much exposition dumps and boring standing around and talking. An issue for most seasons really
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
I feel like im one of the few that dislikes s1 quite a bit.
Surprise hit of last season
Nana ended up being way better than i expected
Damn. I think i have most of symphogear around 5-6 lol
Easy
10/10
Like the made in abyss mobie
Unless its an anime movie apart of an ongoing series
I actually purposely left movies off my list because of that
One of these is not like the others
<:emithumbsup:775400079552282664>
No overlap. Nice variety we got here
My current 10s. I havent added all my animes ive seen to my list yet
Nice
I really didnt like it.
.5 lmao

Oh wait. I forgot i revised yuni
Seeing slime that low hurts but i know its not for everyone
Otherwise it wouldve gotten a 1
Only cause the OP is a banger
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Yu-no is chilling at a 2
I tend to drop anime i dont like so my list doesnt include dropped shows lol. Which leaves it at a 5 or higher usually
Wow yhose crazy bastardd
I wonder how that were able to air the extra long episodes <@139432096023183360>
Who owns the rezero blu rays? Aniplex?
S2 op1. Is god tier
<:GermainAngry:689199996653928451>
Well loris youre just a meanie butt then
Thats most anime
And?
I cant think of any other anime that does that
Even if u dont like rezero. U gotta respect the never playing the OP to get as much content into the show as possible
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
Rezero doesnt have an op
Bruh mushoku is a new studio? Thats impressive af

<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
<@87512939107450880> i finished gundam re:rise. I cant believe they salvaged a good show from the train wreck of divers
Never
<:poigun:787491222171942921>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
The one time i liked lots of talking was Tempest something... Basically the main char and the antagonist had a 2-3 episode long debate on if a certain person was alive or dead. And fuck dude i dunno how they made just talking so intense
<:emithumbsup:775400079552282664>
Gotcha
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
Who?
<@199928870810419200>
<:GermainAngry:689199996653928451>
Also can cute long hair anime girls please stop cuting their hair
Yes
But hey to each their own
I dont get the appeal. I survived OG. And dropped it in the middle of sistermonogatari
I did
Im pretty picky when it comes to my anime
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
On my couch
I feel like im going to enjoy this loke i did happy sugar life. U arent rooting for anyone since everyone is awful/criminal. U just want to see how much of a trainwreck the show can become
I wonder if he will become friends with ||that demon lord girl. He seemed to understand her||
Im probably gonna stick to the censored version to avoid the literal porn/sex
U know that sounds very unadaptable
Curious how theyre going to adapt that...
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
So the rance series
not*
i could do without the sex in the anim,e tho
i do no ardania. just that its a revenge story
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Nothing feels better than watching garbage people get whats coming to them
Im hyped
Redo of the healer is gonna be fun af revenge story
Maaaaan.
Best boi
The old op playing during the action scene was fantastic
Side note. Fuck this episode of rezero was good
<:GermainAngry:689199996653928451>
U stealing the gundam base unicorn?
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
U sure u dont want 1/45?
What grade size
<a:excited_aqua:728967211078647829>
Yea?
I did it over 4 days. In a month.
Probably closer to the 30
20-30 hours
Damn i cant help
Europe or usa loris?
Bawoo is closer to 7?
Exia is 12-13 inches tall
<@99695384296701952> sry for the second @. Just wanted to show the re/100 bawoo. I need to panel line him still
Used a bluray for scale
<@99695384296701952>
<@87512939107450880>
Its a beast
Oh btw i made my 600+ piece Perfect Grade Exia
<:ShirabeHeart:738932033635483738><:KirikaHeart:738932018116821034>
Loris looks nice
This final episode of the build series really felt like OG build fighters again. Great send off
~~but now they can~~
Oh i learned why IBO isnt in the build series. Apparently the tv channel that aired it had the rights for 5 years so bandai couldnt touch the designs for shows.  <@87512939107450880>
Mins
It was a fun 8 mims
<:GermainAngry:689199996653928451>
Can i spoil the match ups for the battlelogue?
Boooo
<@279341087494242304> <@87512939107450880> did you guys watch the build divers battlelogue? What a fanservicey way to end the series
Maybe i cant see it even on desktop mode on mobile
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
How do u get the airing thing to pop up?
Ill update my list when i get home then
Ah im on mobile atm lol
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
Oh i use anilist but it doesnt look like that..
Also what site do u use to look at stuff like that?
<@171395487247630336> keep me posted on EX Arm. That shit is amazing in its own way lol
Maybe its the lack of angry eyes on the early design
Early design feels too... Soft? I dunno the art design for 00 felt like it catered to hard edges.
Also i prefer tierias final design
Followed by itsuki
Nino is best girl of quint
<:notes:754049600863600841>
<@99695384296701952> which ones are your stand out ones?
Re:rise was surprisngly decent
<:ShirabeHeart:738932033635483738><:KirikaHeart:738932018116821034>
Its the mecha
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
<@99695384296701952> <@87512939107450880>
||reiji got laid and hes the bomb|| <@99695384296701952>
Or at least the landing that opens
<@468591607332208641> thats what everyone assumes
Now that sunrise can use them
If they do another build series. I hope the ibo gundams get some time to shine.
Pure edge
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
Fairly sure AGE and reconquista had them
IBO excluded haros right?
Ahhh
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
Melua question for u. Why do Haro exist in some shows and not others
And no i dont remember the talking PC lol
Black history?
Turn A wouldve been cool to have now that we have all these new shows to mush together
The omly time it was animated (not including the toy versions)
I remember the crossbone cameo
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
After the end of build divers. Im very curious on what sunrise does next
Maybe we like gundam cause we are in the world usually for 50 episodes
Such a beast
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Sazabi is one of my fav kits ive ever built
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
And then unicorn was like. Hey u like big mechs?
F91 looks like a HG among my MG
Size reduction FTL
<:GermainAngry:689199996653928451>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
It wouldve been very awkward for kira if flay met lacus
||and then she died two seconds later||
Didnt flay eventually come to geniunely love kira?
<:emithumbsup:775400079552282664>
mushoku tensei is the main culprit of this
is it me or is this season of anime oddly horny. its kinda killing the vibe of some of these shows.
Lol melua
Probably more expensive too
Also shes a huge af spider
I really hope aoi yuki spider gets a human form eventually like with slime

<@87512939107450880> u watched EX Arm right? Or was it rady
Poorly it sounds like
Did neither budge on the topic
Smh
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
<@453836798796234762> so was i right on which side they took?
<:GermainAngry:689199996653928451>
Let me guess. Girl said no. And guy was like the bison meme of yes yes yes
In video games?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Which was
Why
Damn
I hope we get to see tomozaki smash again
Yea i dropped that ep 1
Oh thats snafu?
<:emithumbsup:775400079552282664>
I have watched neither of these animes
Oh i thoghtt u were gonna mention rent a gf main char
The beta male
Tomozaki ep 2 is really good. Hes showed a lot of progress. Hes not even that bad as an antisocial person. Willing to learn and try things out of his comfort range.
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Whats going on
I heard tomozaki
We  are discussing culture loris
<:GuriThinking:480753608393097236>
Tho ita pretty similar
She does seem smaller there vs her anime counterpart
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<@87512939107450880> i feel like shes basically lucy size
I think anime has ruined my perception of big. This doesnt look that big at all to me
*watches trailer*
Too big u say?
That would be one lucky husband
<:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246>
Cultured people
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
vtubers have better 3d models
Maybe the budget is r
That low
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Well maybe they only make grass and trees
<:emithumbsup:775400079552282664>
<@278860841485598720> fun fact
Yubi yubi!
<:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246>
I know
Not possible
Too many shows to watch ten
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I feel like cells at work just doesnt connect in my brain.
Very enjoyable show
<@676272618839605249> it gets better per season.
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Sometimes? You new?

Wut anime is that? Lmao

<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:TriplePeek:689568598938615939>
What happens irl?
Also it has some really good comedic timing at times. Got some good hearty laughs out of me
I liked the character interactions myself. I really enjoy the main char. When he goes from happy go lucky to pissed. Oh man its good
Good thing i own scums wish on blu ray
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>

And i hate it
But i fucking do
I dont want to remember Yuno
No
Or close tonit
Shironeko project is probably the least interesting show of last year
U can easily look at bargian bin isekai for the least interesting shows
<:KanadeSit:535301654464036884>
Nobody said the worst
Explain
What
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
Theres tons and tons of bad anime u avoided then if thats the most boring u watched
<a:NotSoHabbyCat:751165396886880297>
Cause its not a satisfactory win tonme
I am just in denial
Nah i know who wins. I got spoilers earlier this week
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Nah i already have been
<a:NotSoHabbyCat:751165396886880297>
I was really hoping the ending was. Him talking to his first wife. And showed 5 weddings
*removes from watch list*
Great...
That reaction says otherwise
I really hope nino, miku or itsuki win

<a:NotSoHabbyCat:751165396886880297>
I remember getting multiple episodes a year back then. Maybe im crazy
Good show
Are they doing it anymore? I feel like the episodes came to a crawl when OG sao arc ended
Sadly even they cant save it
Tho the latest episode was as boring as ALO
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Abridged is the only way to watch
For watching the og after
<:GermainAngry:689199996653928451>
Theres too much fucking talkin in this show
That scene was great cause there was barely any talking
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Why would that stop me
Long pony tails are such a rare treat in anime
I cut the show from my life when the sister cut her hair
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
Thats cause manga never end
But its close
I mean at least its not the worst option
<a:MythGuraBonk:768577371803484184>
They should do a gundam isekai with multiple series being sucked into a new world. Like srw
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
gundam X massive beam blast
But i still love the mechs from them
I havent watched a lot of the gundams honestly
Nice
Which au
<:emithumbsup:775400079552282664>
Jam packed 8 minutes
Zero vs qan ta, destiny vs god gundam, baal vs neo zeong, barbatos vs strike freedom
Gundam divers battlelogue was basically gundam beyond
More lovelive?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Hathways flash is for u then
Take it one season at a time
Yes
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
And AU
<:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
Watch all of gundam
<a:NotSoHabbyCat:751165396886880297>
For my wallet
That looks really bad.
Could be bad. Could be good
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
<a:karinbye:586936068159307792>
But... I have so many shows on my plate already... And a pokemon soul link with my bud
But how does the princess look
Its like a nice middle ground
Yea forreal
There truly is a god
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
Woah. Henrietta looks fixed too!
<@87512939107450880> do it
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
Dont give me hope
Ep 1 is still using old poop graphics huh
Oh i c
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
<a:NotSoHabbyCat:751165396886880297>
Marielle still had her not straight hair
<a:NotSoHabbyCat:751165396886880297>
<@87512939107450880> log horizon isnt fixed. I just watched ep one. U liar! Also reyneshias mom looks really good. Sucks her daughter got hit with the ugly stick
Just watched the first three eps of Horimiya. And damn. This might be the best new show of the season. I almost missed this
Gotta start culling this herd of insanity im watching
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
After three episodes of ursekei picnic. I think im done with it. Hasnt really given me anything enticing to keep going. If it was on a diff season that wasnt so flooded with quality. I mightve kept with it
I never said its better. I just dont like laziness
Also the op is a banger. So glad they didnt reuse database a third timd
Best ~~girl~~ boi
<@87512939107450880> also pink hair continues to be best char. Wanna see my panties? Lol
~~never watched eithrr of those~~
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
The only other i can think of is angel beats but that show is mediocre overall
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Also like the only time i enjoyed flash back episodes
got lots of drama. And character moments. Lots of conflicts in the tournaments. An insanely fleshed out cast of chars
<a:NotSoHabbyCat:751165396886880297>
God s4 when
<:emithumbsup:775400079552282664>
Chiyahafuru is one of the best animes ive ever watched. Wouldnt call it a slow burn
<:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246>
Cdawg is hilarious with his monkey brain
Ill pick it back up when its done
I can see that lanks. I guess its just too slow of a burn for me atm.
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
He makes more than me talking about anime. So im not gonna flack the guy. Made his dream a reality
Or close to not needed
I mean gigguk himself has made a video on how anime reviews are pointless now
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
Im curios on your perspective. I havent really had a chance to talk to anyone about it
Thats a word
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
How dont get how they just didnt cancel this show
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<@152896851660505088> this cant be real
<:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246>
<a:excited_aqua:728967211078647829>
Horimiya is still ranked as the best new show this season. Only losing out to aot, rezero and jujustu taisen (from last season)
And eats rice
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
I like when ayahi plays cards
Im so excited on next episode. Im curious on what happens to juice
Its nice to see emilia fleshed out tho. Shes always been one of the more boring chars
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
The tv channels get a portion
Maybe they make so much money on merch sales.
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
How did that meeting go
So we wanna make this anime. But we also wanna use the adbreaks
I know. Its wild
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
<@152896851660505088> its all the money they saved by not making an op

Amime title pls
Yo what anime has a chris song as the ed?
If the s2s didnt exist kumo might be near the bottom of the top 10
We need one for just the new shows
Its easily the worst episode of the fighters series sadly. The animation is at its worst here. Hardly any movement
I think lexi is the first person ive seen say that about island wars
<:CarolShock:730816714345938956>
<a:excited_aqua:728967211078647829>
Build fighters > Danball senki > build fighters try
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Poor lexi.
<a:excited_aqua:728967211078647829>
Pay for my bills
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
I cant be here all the time
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
<@87512939107450880> s3 opening song fof log horizon is literally named different. Hey guys. A Different song for log horizon
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
I mean its not hard to be better than captain earth
Its very pretty
Has very unique animation/areas some scenes take place in
Oh yea id think so. Showing the trauma of the girls is really the only depressing part.
Not really.  Its more about the girls overcoming what issues they have. MC is growing at a great pace vs first episode
Also i hope goblin slayer s2 isnt as boring and pointless as that fucking movie was
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
Bottom tier tomozaki kun had a fantastic episode. Proabably the best scene of any new show this season. Im so proud of the MC
What happened. I havent watched the latest episode
<:CarolShock:730816714345938956>
<@454822882045067298>
U cant offend garbage amiya
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Ex arm
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
Better start novanity
We need more mecha
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
Id rather they go ham on gundam
S2 knights of sidonia is like the only good people cg i can think of
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Cgi people is hard. But cgi anything else can be so good
Gatchaman crowds had great cg too
When actual work is done into cg. It can look great
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
I always point to MP for how fight choreography for mecha should be like
Forreal
Mainly any of the jiart fights
Im happy with the CG personally. Theres some fights that wouldnt have been possible in 2D unless exremely talented people worked on them
U great man
Randy
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
Majestic prince was fantastic
They stopped after a few episodes. shortened it quite a bit from what i remember
Yea a lot of budget went into that
Its not bad. But its not really good either
Bruh same
Horimiya is shaping up to me one of my fav romantic comedies
I finished that and was like. I need more comedy. People tell me konosuba is good. And then i found it nowhere near as enjoyable as hinamatsuri
Aka hinamatsuri
When u watch a better comedy show before it. Konosuba falls flat
I honestly hated konosuba my first watch. It was only on my second watch with my bro that i enjoyed it. So i can understand that lank
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
If it aint anime. I have no clue it exists
I think the best isekais are usually the ones where the main isnt an otaku. Which is extremely rare
<:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246>
That just shows how good bookworm is
Rezero, bookworm and konosuba are probably the top three isekais. Each filling different qoutas
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
Is poly even an accepted thing in japan? I really dont see that happening any time soon
Also i dislike the show. The only good thing about it is that it will actually end with him picking a gurl. A rarity in harem animes
<a:excited_aqua:728967211078647829>
Hey we all agreed on bookworm
Ascendence of a bookworm is my go to isekai i recommend to people
Likewise fenny
Fair. But there are good harem animes (only few) and quite a few good isekais exist atm.
Thats just one side of him. Hes fleshed out quite a bit
Theres no harem as of yet. And yea the mc is a perv but hes been improving to be less of one
Gomma be honest. I dont look at tags for a show. I just download it and watch.
<:CarolShock:730816714345938956>
How do u have an opinion with no info
Ill wait
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Go watch it to get one
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
Also lank and chaos just came in to bonk me i see and not join in the convo
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Also im really glad the show continues to be good. I was really scared at arda's comment earlier
<a:AnimeRage2:615386961200545842>
<:irohanani:586822870311632908>
Let me like designs chaos!
Woof
Also that beast lady...
Im glad rudy is going elsewhere. Been wanting to see more chars. Looking forward to next ep
So i got to the part in musoku tensei. And im legit wondering if its a translation error with how quickly it glazes over the fact. Or maybe its not. It just seems bizarre to not give it any more attention
Sheryl nome is great
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Pick it back up <a:excited_aqua:728967211078647829>
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
Im so proud of my boy
Aww. Latest episode was so good. MC defending another person was amazing
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Is anyone watching bottom tier character tomozaki?
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
10% of people are dumb lol
Switched to desktop mode
Ah i can see it now
I cant see tags
Maybe its causd im on mobile
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
I only see fantasy and slice of life
Wat
Where she does things to make other peoples lives better but really its to make her own life better
But im just saying kuma bear barely focuses on the cuteness of the plethora of smol girls. It has a few moment here and there but its just a worse bookworm
Oh i know
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
Like digging a tunnel thru a mountain to get to a town so she can eat rice again
Usually shes doing something to further a goal or something she wants
I honestly wouldnt label this show as a CGDCT show.
I didnt like how she was so unbelievably op. To the point of like deus ex machina levels
Yea it does focus on her. But shes also the most interesting char. So i guess thats fine
Oh id bet that for sure
Too many children
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
But worse. Cause the animation for fights is subpar. Or just stills. Or skips to the end
God it was such a boring show
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
That was a thing
I watched kuma kuma kuma bear recently with aria.
Watching for me is a social bonding with my bro. I almost never watch anime alone unless my bro hates the anime i like
My brain smol
I like colors and voices
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Thats me but for manga
I skipped that personally. The synopsis didnt sound appealing to my tastes
Fenny if i was reading tbis. I dont think id like it. Some of the VA deliveries are perfect
<:CoconaSweat:480753608023998472>
Tats and piercings help too. Hes hella hot
Hes so chill too when conflict isnt happening
I like the MCs. Theyre very comfy and the guy MC actually wanting to settle things with fists is a nice change of pace to current animes out.
For me
I think its a culture thing. Their jokes just never land
Dang. U were my last hope
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
<@199928870810419200> u watch it?
Okay
So... Shes super out of the loop right?
<:CarolShock:730816714345938956>
Wut
She sure missed a lot
Dayum lmao
Does she ever break out? I only saw up to basically season 2 o f the anime in manga form
<:doge:496780220309962772>
<@274279989506211841> <@152896851660505088> <@202444817043685386>
Nope
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
I prefer the top half of eren and mikasa over the bottom half pics
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
What happened to the cutie i knew in s1
Sadly no
I will say that promised neverland s2 has been the biggest disappoint this season tho. Very boring
And then u throw returning shows on top of this. Its a hella strong start to 2021
<@453836798796234762> <@278860841485598720> 
As someone whos watching 18 shows this season..7 of them as returns. This is definitely a very strong season of anime. From the fun action packed shounen romp or skate the infinity, to great character interactions in horimiya and bottom tier character, to wonder eggs visuals and character growth. To a horror mystery/supernatural show like kemono jihen. Theres basically something for every genre running this season.
The last dumpsterfire i enjoyed heavily was happy sugar life
She kept me coming back
Mugi is best girl
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
I really tried
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Got so bored
Dropped it halfway thru
I think K-on was my last one i watched
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
I rarely watch CGDCT since theres not really any difference between ep 1 to ep 12.
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
But do things happen
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
Never watched either of those. I feel like im missing out
<a:excited_aqua:728967211078647829>
For me discluding returning stuff. 
Horimiya > bottom tier character > Mushoku Tensei > Kemono Jihen > Wonder egg
Ill probably start to like it more when spider has actual things to interact with
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
Ah. I rrelly want spider to be better. The latest episode was the best yet but its still fairly eh to me.
<:CarolShock:730816714345938956>
Tf is that last one
Atm its chilling at spot number 5 for me
If wonder egg keeps up the quality it might jump to my top new anime this season. (That staircase fight was great)
Lmao
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
Thats a weird way to type rezero
<:doge:496780220309962772>
Even tho its garbage. Im really enjoying only i can enter the hidden dungeon. Its so dumb but its like doritos. I know its bad for me but i cant stop consuming it
Im even enjoying a completely trashy show for once
Rezero, slime, kemono jihen etc. Etc. I have so much to look forward to
Ive been having a blast this seaspn
Theres always next season for u lank
Well i guess this season is just not to your tastes. Doesnt make it bad. Just isnt for you sadly. 6 is better than 3-5. Which is my usual number
Who
Or ss2 for dbz
Likw the GS ball in pokemon
Because manga artists forget things exist
||also why are there two armins||
Quality bowls
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Ui is inside of yui
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
I dunno. Mugi has some good doujins
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
Its not a pun
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
~~you hear maria everywhere cause she lacks range~~
Damn hot blondes in anime
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
I rear haruhime for a second
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
I have been told by a few people to watch that
Bottom tier character tomozaki kun. He popped off this last episode and i want to see what comes of it
<a:AnimeRage2:615386961200545842>
I need my friday anime
<:CoconaSweat:480753608023998472>
And hot
Hes great. Such a wonderful MC
I just lack the means to do so
Yes
I dunno. The talking was just boring at first.  I got like 4? Or so episodes in. Around when lenesia became governor or whatever
There's better isekai to watch this season over pharmacy sadly. Came out when like 5 others are running
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
It's okay
No I got bored of it
It's cool it seems to take place well after  the isekai happened
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
I watched one episode and was bored out of my mind.
That's my go to rubber show
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
How do people enjoy DxD without jiggles
Or whatever it is this season
Pharmacy in other world?
Like that show atm..
I think the artstyle in general is just too low budget for me to enjoy
Ragnar just hurts my eyes
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
I feel like isekai cheat magician had decent char designs at least
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
I don't even want to know what u consider worse than ragnarok
U poor soul
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Oh God. I remember mothers basement dedication an entire episode to raganarok of rockbottom
To your eternity ep 1. Curb stomped my heart
Put that back on. Its super good
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Suguha fell for the fucker  twice
Suguha
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
1 1/2 dudes. And like 8 females
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
I know it is. I had a hard time spelling it.
Sinon does have a nice snarky attitude and doesn't succumb to simping for kirito all the time like the rest
<:lewd:852753041374314496>
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
U get some really good shows like bakarina or bookworm. But also complete garbage like that 7 geniuses or cheat isekai
It's the one genre I try every anime in basically
Also Cypher. If the isekai happened in the past decade. I most likely tried it already lol
Rip
Hey if they can retcon the last 4 anime original episodes of dxd s3. They can retcon nobuna
Nobuna needs a s2
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
That got hit with the ugly stick
Yea that was great
Yep. Which she does find. But she surrounds herself with people who will usually listen so she doesn't have to bring out the murder stick to her allies at least
So if she wants to kill u. She will find a legal way to do it
She does follow the law
Lol
Aoi Yuki does such a damn good job
It's one of my fav isekai
If I want a military isekai I'm gonna jump to Tanya the evil personally
Unless our tech is gundams
Yea but I don't enjoy watching our tech beat fantasy. That's just depressing
Outbreak company kinda did that
I have girls und panzer for tanks
Cause I purposely ignored it
Oh I know I've never watched it
It didn't not look like it was in my wheelhouse
I never watched gate.
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
U better hide
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
I do
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
I can't say there's anything I personally enjoy about sao myself. While I enjoyed ggo. I had to sit thru two arcs to get to it
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
Good times
Remember when the antagonist of the movie jumped down 3+ stories to deflect a imaginary shot and landed with no leg damage
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
But they're so much better than a majority of his anime fan group
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Can we count the two game only girls that simp for kirito?
Innocent ayaya who didn't know any better
Man I remember when I was so excited to watch sao week to week
Maybe around when konosuba came out
I'm trying to think when I learned the word isekai
<:morryAYAYA:644016335847686194>
Text to speech
<a:KoroneBonk:726121511597113367>
How dare u assume I can read
I hate it personally lol. Deus ex machina s2 ending killed the show for me
<a:MariaSlap:656169631526158349>
Why did u have to remind me it existed tho
God that show
Alicization is when I consider sao a true isekai
In arc 1 and 3
Probably cause it's a more a survival death game then an isekai
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
And boy is isekai not going anywhere
Yes ash
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
Poor kirito VA. Is forever known as kiritos VA
I believe that
Huh. I guess I never really considered trapped In a video game as an isekai
Is sao considered an isekai?
No other source I'd trust on the genre
Melua all about the mecha from all eras
That sounds like a nightmare
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
I recognize that from a couple old srw games
I'm listening
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
Honestly I'm so used to animes that deal with the whole world making Japan the best of all the countries. It doesn't even phase me anymore
Ah
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Two worlds? It's a double isekai?
Write what u know
Author being a soldier makes more sense at least
Oh wait that's freddy
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
The singer?
They got a safety net to poke the bear lol
But they also don't cause rank means everything.
Which she can't do anything about
Her superiors fuck her more than anything

<@87512939107450880> <@99695384296701952> just bought a bunch of gunpla
<@99695384296701952> did u watch dynazenon
They vastily improved their writing imo
If u liked gridman. You'll have no trouble liking dynazenon
Okey
<:fuukaknife:833729820163702824>
<a:KoroneBonk:726121511597113367>
<@202444817043685386> continue dynazenon
It's great. Way better than gridman imo
I should go finish dynazenon. I'm like 2 episodes away
Pumpkin your pfp is the dude from gridman right?
The recent broly movie is also a top contender for me. But I'm also biased to DragonBall stuff.
I rank made in abyss movie above Kimetsu no yaiba movie. But I can easily rewatch KnY movie. (I've seen it 3 times already)
That's connected to a show
My top one time watch anime movie. Of all time.
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
Made in abyss
U know whats a better anime movie than original scale and probably cost a lot less to make?
I mean the cannon dbz movies are dope
Ahhh. I stopped after ggo. When it went back to ALO
Oh did it change that much after s1
What's the old style look like
I would've skipped so much lol
Binging would've helped ALO so much
Poor ash. Joined the dark side
<a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746>
Those are fighting words
didnt it get a 2nd season?
i just rememeber everyone having huge boobs and being naked a lot
im sure theres weirder
~~best part of haruhi~~
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
Also that antagonist was totally purple haired Lelouch
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
You're better
Op and Ed were both great
It just went nowhere
So did i
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
This looks like another sacred seven.
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
<@152896851660505088> where's the precure cute girls
I really enjoyed him being loud in the final fight. Hes way too quiet
Jobless dude was legit with his hair slickedback tho. Could be a certified badass if he acted confident
<:TheSaddest:480749091995779094>
I wish second did more. Shes way too adorable to stay off screen
Yea i just thought of that
Honestly if they do a cross over. I feel loke dynazenon cast would steal the show from the gridman cast
Thats be dope.
<a:Tsubasa_shock:663624589913620500>
Wait theyre combinging s1 and 2 for s3
Thank god. I feel like SSSS could turn into. Serialized anime like power rangers where the teams change each season and we get a nice send off for the last squad beforr the new one takes over the good fight
<:MeguFace:480750533968396288>
Oh we doooo?
Im gonna miss it
<@175076569868402688> i ended up watching the finale twice. God i really enjoyed this show
God was that enjoyable
I just did it for dynazenon
Yall  ever really enjoy the final fight in the final episode of an anime and go back to rewatch it right when the episode finished?
I dont even think thats a hot take. Haruhi is like Lucky star to me. You either love it or u steer clear of it lol
<:MeguFace:480750533968396288>
Man hearing ||god knows|| hit me in the nostalgia. I dont even like the show that much but it had bangers and catchy songs
Blue reflection is one of those games I'm shocked went anywhere after the lackluster  first title
im so hyped. one of the best animes of 2020
YOOOO i just learned THE MISFIT OF DEMON KING ACADEMY is getting a s2!
I thought u said kirito at first lmao
She's cute but her bro obsession is a huge pass for me

It's be a huge cop out to bring him back
<@175076569868402688> if they do a dynzenon crossover. ||Who would take over gauma spot? The red hair girl?||
Makes sense and makes me super happy he got to be happy with her in the end
I like the theory that ||yume and yomogi are the princess and gauma reincarnated. And that gauma we know was sorta like a split off version to protect them.||
Im pretty bummed him and thigh villian didnt hook up
The supporting cast for bocchi is so good too
Fantastic show.
<:karinthink:586819183115894799>
My heart is full of lewd. No spider girls there

Hehe flowers pretty. Is how my brain sees flower arrangements
Peace
I gotta go back to work but I'll happily talk Digimon later
So much quality and variety
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
Cyber sleuth  really doubled down on the amount of waifus it had
I agree. Next order is one of my fav Digimon games. I wouldn't mind an anime of that either
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
I got so bored midway thru hackers... I feel bad never finishing it
That would be dope. But they would need to pick FeMC. And make her funny like the responses
His introduction episode is the worst episode of the show. He gets better later on. But man where the show was. We didn't need more chars honestly
I only ever watched frontier. It was decent
I like the idea that they keep going and ||Subaru just makes Emilia or Beatrice suffer by killing himself for seemingly no good reason to them||
sameeee
i did. i like her. my fave it the big oppai girl from the beach village
<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
I wish it just stayed a cute lewd romp
Biggest whip lash I've ever had
Until it goes ||full murder mode||
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
F that manga man
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
Huh. Okay lol
Or just not the blu ray lol
U never watched gundam 00?
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
<@155340660738621440>
||I MEAN setsuna does transform||
It's like bringing ||Muu la flaga|| back in destiny
Also really cheapens the whole thing
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
We don't talk about that. It hasn't been animated so it's not real to me
<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
I really only enjoyed the movie for zabanya and harute.  God they're some of my favorite gundams
Graham
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
||they killed my fave char so it gets a lower rating to me||
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
I feel like s2 of gundam 00 was fine. The movie is just the wtf part to me
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
So much wasted potential
I know I'm late to the party but I feel like ibo s2 gets that award personally
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
Otherwise the shows a nothing show
I mean all shows have some sort of drama.
<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
They're both actual words. Why autocorrect at all
Why the fuck my phone autocorrect ship girl to shipping is beyond me
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
I never bothered with franxxx. That ship girl at the end sounded fun tho. Srw when
There isn't. It's pretty down to earth.  Even the bad guys hang with some of the good guys at times
I found dynazenon a much more successful endeavor with megazord combat and giving you chars that u will actually remember. Hoping the crossover  thing does even better
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
Because all the chars in gridman are boring af. So people glomp to thigh girl and purple girl
It's mainly one dude
Probably cause no girls fight in gridman
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
just caught up and she's best girl. totally not cause Nino voices her.
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
explain yourself. tsuns avoid showing affection and resort to violence instead
can you even call her a tsun when she's actively gunning for MC affection?
neat. thank u raIden
whats the difference between the 4k and normal bluray version outside of the resolution
robot carnival?
im getting so nostalgic with looking at what discotek has
i wanna buy them  but i dont
man i hate when i see shows like sorcerer hunters have the SD to HD tag
<:monkaHmm:789574860900270110>
diskotek has the rights to konosuba blurays? huh i wouldve figured funimation or sentai wouldve snatched that first
forreal find of the century right there
thats hilarious
what was it labelled as lmao
bruh
<:asagishock:842475968022052905>
where did he find it
while i realize its not feasible id love if their SD to HD couldve been pure hd releases but thats basically impossible for some of these
im interested in it at least
im curious how big that market is for westerners
i wonder how well itll sell if it was worth all the work
yo im down for this. id love to see what i even remember from this show back when i was a child lol
I'm totally down for split cours if I get less things like second half of spider isekai
Or that one episode in the second half that was outsourced and looks very out of place vs the rest lol
I'm not saying you're lying. I'm saying most people will remember how pretty af the show is compared to the maybe handful of random scenes that don't look as good as the rest of the show
I tried to watch the first episode of that for this season.  Had the most out of place sound effects I've ever heard in my life
That doesn't look like Mushoku tensei to me honestly
Damn auto correct
Was the 4th re-connect the green astray?
There's too many astray frames
Lol that makes sense
Oh
Out frame
Then there's the green frame. Mirage frame
I assume something kills Gina then for Mina to pilot it
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
<:StellaPout:631887932843622411>
No fair! I wanna hug melmel too
I think it was a g gen game. But man they did not do a good enough job to draw the two apart
I was very confused
I remember first seeing mina and thought it was Gina with lipstick.
Yea I couldn't understand Japanese and I could tell they exuded that energy lol
<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
I wonder why it was called gold frame instead of yellow frame
Well it's supposed to be yellow anyways so I'm cool with that
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
It's the least cool one of the 5 imo. At least it got combined into the gold astray to be badass
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
The original 4 gundams that fight the strike were the least back chunky
I feel like the forbidden was built to be a space mech but was sent out into land battles it was never supposed to be in
Strike and impulse are still in my top 10 gundams
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
Char was a great char until he went cartoony crazy in CCA
I mean. Most gundam shows have good gundams. If you ignore reconguista.  But other shows aren't nearly as loved as seed in Japan
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
There's usually good points a villain makes. They just tend to go about it in the worst possible way
<:HanekaWhat:480753607927529483>
It still confuses me to this day how gundam seed is one of the most popular gundam series in japan
<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
The only good earth forces were on the archangel
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>

Lol rip
And they all liked it
I've told people to watch to 3. If u do t like it by then drop it
I felt anxiety fear anger worry all in that flashback
I was impressed
It got so real
Ep 3 is what clinched the show for me with it being a good show
More people need to watch kageki shoujo
Like one of my fav shows of this season is one of the least watch shows according to Mal and I find that depressing
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
I know I'm super close minded when it comes to anime but also try way more genres than most people(that I know irl) at the same time
I think so
I think I've seen some gifs  of that anime. Is the MC a derp red head
Personally my top animes in recent memory have all been Female protag animes with both male and female cast of chars. All male or all female shows tend to drag on me
I have not actually. I've seen an insane amount of... fanart of that girl u posted tho
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
I'm not a teen and need to self insert onto the protag like. Hey they unattractive dude can get girls. Maybe I can to!
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
I tend to be apparently
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
I never tried it lol. When I saw the MC I was like lol nah
<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
I like my man candy
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
True. It's why I don't like animes like accel  world or shows like it. Where the below average looks MC gets the cute girl. Why can't I get to enjoy a show with a handsome man and a cute girl
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Mugi was my fav girl but man I found it boring personally.
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
People rag on me usually for not liking K-on
Of course. Some will be better to others. I'm not a huge fan of the genre myself so it's at the top of my list since I actually finished it lol
It's way too cute and fun to not get one. Way better than the other cgdct shows out there
Yes
I need a s2
Those poor animes didn't have a chance
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
I agree with melua tho. Early to mid 2000s was the growing pain years of anime from cel to digital
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
The movie isnt
U sure that ain't a math equation?
ZGMF-YX21R+X11A Proto-Saviour+11
Also Jesus these names in the novels. Are a bit much
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
What's VPS again
I already do
Oh boy will funimation oversaturate anime from crunchyroll now?
Gambatte beam!
Yesssss another bocchi lover
Gimme more Mushoku tensei
<a:KoroneBonk:726121511597113367>
I'm ready for next season tho
Never watched aho  girl
Only reason I continue to watch gf gf is cause best girl Nino nakano is voicing the potential third gf.
What's in your backlog
Which was amusing episode one but grating episode 6
Gf gf everyone decided to be asta and yell constantly too
As someone who's watched some of rent a gf. And what's out currently for gf gf. It's a stark difference in quality
Rent a girlfriend at least looked nice. Girlfriend girlfriend the chars are more off model than on
<:StellaPout:631887932843622411>
Drives me nuts a legit awful show like girlfriend girlfriend has 7x the viewers on Mal vs KS.
Yea and the growth ai had was great
I'm honestly not giving it a fair shake
I think I honestly would've like the show if someone else was the voice
Reminds me a lot of the kemono.michi. Same VA for MC
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
It's like trying to be konosuba but with a dude who's yelling voice is annoying af
Black company was very meh right out the gate imo
So I looked at the manga of slime. Won't the anime overtake it at this rate?
I personally use vlc media player for my PC and phone
I read up to walpurgis starting  actually. So it'll be completely new for me soon
While I understand your suffering. I've enjoyed every episode so far
Tight
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
<@331908049822547978> try that anime if u want a pretty different take on the battle school genre
It memes on the genre so hard
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
Misfit of demon academy would be the closest to a magical battle school deconstruction
Lol that would fall into that category wouldn't it
<a:worryStab:647232976668721162>
I legit don't know
Outside of mahouka has there been any others worth mentioning?
They fell out of fame pretty quickly imo
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
I dont think a magical school show exists like that honestly
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Isn't money being spent towards having the service?
Gotcha
I'm legit clueless on this rip
Oh
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
I haven't watched the video. What would the drama be?
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
Tower of God is the only thing crunchyroll funded recently that was worth
<:HuTaoAYAYAY:806234426572668949>
Yo trigger is making it?
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
1.1
Bbbbb bird bird bird
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
We are in a post interspecies reviewers world. I think we will be fine
I wonder if they could drag walpurgis out to 4 episodes  and end it at the completion lol
The army clash will be a good couple episodes. And then the rest with the demons lords will be good.
It'll be enjoyable ash
There's shouldn't be any left honestly. Maybe like half an episode with everyone showing up to walpurgis. They showed a lot of the later flashback exposition already in these last 6
Neat. Yea I was really surprised how little the manga has progressed since the last time I read it like a year or so ago
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
So it would overtake the manga
Skies of arcadia
Would spoil so many animes
I'm glad  I can't read actual books
<:HuTaoAYAYAY:806234426572668949>
Me too. Excited for s2?
Back to work I go
<a:PepeLeave:701955603270074419>
<:madotehe:623221369726959616>
It's like fate. U just dont
I couldn't handle such heresy
I tapped out around the time the ponytail sister ||cut off her ponytail||
<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
Gatari to me is just talking. Lots and lots of talking
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
Yea one episode a girl gets her butt kicked. And the police get involved
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
But things happen in BGS. Unlike gatari
~~it's just worse bunnygirl senpai~~
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Not everyone wants to be subaru
<@152896851660505088> my life is suffering
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
Get friend to finally watch to your eternity so you can talk to someone about it. He binges it then reads ahead in the manga. So now I can't talk to him about future possibilities
Lol I was really confused why Raiden just posted the ANN website
That's fair lmao
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
I'm still sad nadesico did poorly and didn't get a season 2 like it was planned. I love that mecha comedy/also serious at times show.
<:madotehe:623221369726959616>
~~that could be a good or bad thing depending on who u asked~~
Ah good toonami
Cause I remember it was originally supposed to be a one season anime.
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Big O is such an interesting case. Wasn't western fan demand or the company in charge of the western release why it got a second season? Or am I mistaken
Oh hey an English blu ray exists
<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
I just Google it. I have never seen this design.
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Never seen it. What's wrong with God mazinger
im still waiting for S2 of mondaiji. get in line
i mean thats my own taste. its not the case of a show being right or not. its just not my cup of tea. doesnt make the show bad. i just have no interest in them
like a majority of angel beats
i personally prefer faster paced shows. i kinda hate watching a show and like you go thru 5-6 episodes and sit there thinking. i could cut all of this out and literally not be lost/lose anything in the process
i watched bake and nise. and thats all i can muster
i unfortunately just cant get myself to care about the gatari series
nice. not a fan of SoL shows really anymore. especially older ones since they have a (usually) even slower pace vs shows we get nowadays
oh code geass R2. as much as i try to forget R2
and the continuation of 00 obv lol
yugioh 5Ds, Zettai karen children (like 10 years after the fact) and sekirei was all i watched from 2008 lol
2008 is def one of the years i wasnt watching anime at all i believe
rip
<:KannaSip:480753608045101076>
yes but to go even higher to like 2015 lol
i wanna try to find my personal best year of anime
hey serious do you have other pictures like this for other years?
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
ah the year that made me quit gatari
i recognize a ton of these but man... i ignored so much back then lol
nice
oh i missed baccano on this list
theres a maplestory everything
i must not have liked or ever bothered with the shows you conisdered then serious xD
Kaiji, Gurren, and 00 are the main highlights for me of this list. i always heard good things about darker than black tho ive never seen it personally
i had to use my PC to see the pictgure lol
not to be mean but im looking at this and i see maybe a handfull of worthwhile shows to me
i never finished heroic age. how was that ? <@!99695384296701952>
still blows my mind its 07
forreal melua
<:HuTaoAYAYAY:806234426572668949>
Zoids!
<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
Mid to late 2000s was like the epitome of budget drivel imo. But that can also be tossed to many companies having to learn digital and outsourcing lots of it. To other companies that had to learn digital
But there's so much more low budget drivel now vs back then
Of course. Like the low budget ugly shows people don't remember now
You hush your mouth
Also I know I'm biased. But jeez, 90s anime and very early 2000s anime (like FMP) looks so much better after an HD remaster vs a lot of shows we get today.
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
I'm always sad that ||cute purple hair girl couldn't be saved from being crushed||
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
Yo that'd be sick melua
||how did apollo see apollonius in aquarion when fudo existed this whole time||
my fav girl got a W
also i super enjoyed the Tomoyo After ova
its my favorite Key anime
i do love kanon
<a:ratjam:785587377447763999>
bork bork
i sadly never got to the point. or cared enough to get to that point.
correct me if im wrong about this for evol ||wasnt it revealed the MC wasnt apollo reincarnation but like a dog reincarnated?||
as someone who never finished clannad. the main girl always seemed the least interesting of all the options
thats how i feel about a lot of shows people love lol
<:asagicringe:804515368692351016>
i wouldve loved Zessica new outfit if it covered her chest and didnt have Xs on them
~~and give her a weird midseason outfit change~~
i disagree but accept your opinion
so i could be mistaken
yea but og Aquarion was better at doing an ensemble at least. sure apollo was the main main. but lots of chars got their time to shine. i really dont remember much of evol anymore tho
i remember not really liking evol out the gate with the MC having that dumb power of flight from his feet or whatever that happened when he got the teenage juices flowing
was when it ended?
i dont get why aquarion even got a s2 or 3. it felt complete after 1
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
how was the third season?
i dont see where you get the no real depth tho. i feel like they were pretty real people with interactions. i enjoyed how the bad guys werent even cartoony evil (outside of that one made for comic relief) and actually talked/interacted with the protags
i think the moment i really started caring about gridman was when purple haired girl was ||revealed as a villian|| i legit almost dropped the show before that
interesting how we had opposite takes on both shows. i felt like gridman was as shallow as a puddle but dynazenon gave everyone their own time they deserved.
man starting at 2018. there were SO many shows i loved god
episode 10 being the highlight of dynazenon. trigger really flexed their 2D animation that episode
i loved dynazenon so much more than gridman. all the characters had so many good interactions and growth. wasnt just the hibiki show
makes me hyped for the crossover thingie
im so happy how much the crew improved from gridman to dynazenon
Thank u for giving me the motivation to finally work on my anilist lanks
Or top 3 years
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
im gonna start with 2018 and go backwards making my anilist complete and then determining my personal favorite year of anime
2013 is my best year so far with 2018 in second place
im going thru my anilist atm
we talking about our personal favorite years of anime
it was a jam packed year of so many goodies in so many genres for me
for me it had golden time, devil is a part timer, log horizon, Magi s2, DxD s2, mondaiji tachi, Gundam Build Fighters, Maoyu,  kotoura-san, Gargantia, Chihayafuru s2, yawamushi pedal, gatchaman crowds, mushibugyo and a few others
<@!278860841485598720> 2013 has my current award of best anime year so far
i quite enjoyed star driver personally. wasnt it supposed to have gotten a movie or something to finish off the plot?
we have what looks like 10-11 mecha shows in 2014
also i didnt realize how many mecha animes appeared in 2014
fair
<@!99695384296701952> im having trouble remembering our last discussion on the anime. what was your thoughts on Captain Earth again
what a waste of time that show was
Brynhildr in the Darkness
mannn 2014 reminded me of an anime that had a cool idea but was so poorly paced
real life idol culture has always kinda scared me
<:asagishock:842475968022052905>
lol how do u do it by accident?
i feel so many animes do this
cause half the time the bad ending is usually rushed. but it had like 1-3 episodes in the middle that just faffed about that couldve been used to make the ending segment longer and feel less rushed but here we are
i just mean in general.
it really does suck when you get a good anime and it just drops the ball the last 2 episodes
is akb that idol show with numbers at the end of the title?
nah
studios doing things that make sense?
<:Sadge:789574212754079805>
then kindly ignore it and my poor sense of humor
<:SataniaEvil:480749092595826707>
the power of yuri?
damn i was gonna say 2016 was a pretty decent year for anime then i saw IBO s2. whelp so much for that
i mean she almost was. only 24 votes away
~~too be fair mecha tends to shaft females in general i feel like~~
<:doge:496780220309962772>
probably the same people who love invisible girl in my hero
i dont remember fudoh getting that much screen time honestly
<:KannaSip:480753608045101076>
its too bad they cant course correct anime midway thru. like hey this Zessica is way more popular than mikono. lets give her the W instead
also Male MIX almost beating male MC is pretty funny too
big oof
lmao and they rank higher than Female lead
whos number 8 on the female side. i legit dont remember her at all
i never hit that season 2 switch lmao
oh man i forgot about invisible girl. she was great
<:whatidoCAT:630462601796780032>
i never tried gate. which is weird cause i try like all isekai basically
let me go update my year and show ya
thats a fair point. i honestly didnt like it out the gate from episode 1
thats too many episodes for a show to get better lol
i must commend you for watching Back arrow. i sure couldnt
its all good lanks
with SD gundams
oh yea i forgot about that. it felt like a mecha trying to be like a dark magical girl show
im way too lazy to rate shows atm. im just marking things i completed or dropped lol
we can be best buds then. like cypher and solopy
im glad you like mecha serious
macross frontier is fun
i stopped at GX personally. i got like 2 episodes into AXZ and just... didnt care enough to continue
i didnt mention it cause in retrospect Symphogear isnt that high on my list of animes i enjoyed personally
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
G was
cause GX wasnt 2013
youve missed a lot of goodies lank
we ignore that cypher
i got a rope. youll be fineeee
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
millhi!
<a:ratjam:785587377447763999>
if any of the peeps respond ill post the other years too
32 freaking shows i finished (doesnt include dropped obv lol)
<@!87512939107450880> <@!278860841485598720> <@!99695384296701952> since u were all in the convo. my personal best year (i think)
my years are 2013, and 2018-2020
<@!278860841485598720> i got my top 4 years. having a really hard time cutting it down to three honestly lol
so ive dropped about a 5th of the shows ive seen over the years lol
421 shows watched and about 100 shows dropped. itll probably need some fine tuning. and add movies in there eventually but it looks like im done atm
from 1979 to 2020
anddd done
usually id have at least one anime per year
damn i didnt watch anything from 1993 lmao
well i just finished up to 2000. started at 2018. nothing had come close to 2013. still gotta do 90s anime and relook at the 2019-2020 animes tho
honestly i personally probably didnt have enought feedback for citrus but anyone i knew who watched it told me to hard avoid it
i dont think ive ever picked back up a show ive dropped in my life lol
i never attempted it
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
lank said it first
what i say
usually i try to pick more obscure shows in someones field they enjoy if im asked for recommendations since theyve most likely overlooked it or just never knew it existed
misfit of demon academy is another i love to recommend
i tend to recommend killed slimes for 300 years to people if they havent watched it yet lol
<:asagishock:842475968022052905>
citrus
and i wouldnt xD
i tend to not recommend animes to people in general for this reason. wildly different tastes in things
fair enough
mushoku tensei is a pretty character driven show. and slow. but some people are uncomfortable with the MCs actions at times. (justifiably so)
theres a little bit of overlap here and there. otherwise we look for completely different shows lol
you and i have very different tastes when it comes to anime it seems lol
never watched yuru camp or uma musume so cant watch s2 of that. picnic i dropped about 3 eps in out of boredom personally. mars red i dropped after an episode. looked cool but not my cop of tea. super cub is still one show i need to try. never was into fruits basket. and bishounen tanteidan is not a genre thats meant for me lol
of your list the only overlap is shadow house, horimiya and slime. i watched some of the other isekai with the girl about potions but dropped it
im just a disappointed fan cause i knew how much better it couldve been
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
even the tiddy was barely good at times. s1 had some fantastic fanservice moments.
you could still enjoy it but man. its budget was slashed super hard. so many poorly animated shots or justy stills with shakey cam
world trigger season 2 was hype
season 1 was great
season 2? was hella awful in comparison to season 1
top right corner is the worst show on the list ive seen easily so far
<@!278860841485598720> this year been pretty good overall
why would millhi meme rate a show
<:monkaHmm:789574860900270110>
i thought you had good taste
why not
<:monkaHmm:789574860900270110>
<:KannaSip:480753608045101076>
so now if i ever wanna try a new anime. i can just start at millhi rank 10 animes and go down
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
you mustve had some left cause you only rated it a 5
<:Sadge:789574212754079805>
i lost brain cells watching the first couple of eps of that
<:StellaPout:631887932843622411>
you watched i wanna be the strongest. you can watch golden time
<:Sadge:789574212754079805>
he's like one episode. watch more pls
<@!152896851660505088> out of the 2000 things you watched im curious why golden time and medaka box are 2 of the 37 shows you decided to drop lol
i just did mine. never too late to start
it was a cute nice show only watched it to completion thanks to <@!189146272865845248> wouldve of dropped it so much earlier otherwise lol
<@!278860841485598720> im kinda surprised at some of the shows you dropped tho. they seem right up your wheelhouse like kuma kuma kuma bear
tho i plan to pick back up the last one
Eighty Six
joran the princess of snow and blood
sleepy princess in the demon castle
warlods of sigrdifa
listeners
Koikimo
plunderer
<:doge:496780220309962772>
26 that i dropped, 14 lanks dropped. and 7 shows we both dropped  <@!278860841485598720>
lets see how many shows lank watched that i dropped
<:asagicringe:804515368692351016>
jesus 308 anime you plan to watch
u know we have the exact same amount of anime completed on anilist at 421 lol
<a:PepeLeave:701955603270074419>
<:Sadge:789574212754079805>
*sees your banner* damn i didnt realize you didnt like me
im just gonna give up at this point
the millhi i found has watched 2122 anime things. and has a banner of love live. which didnt happen in 2010.
<:MeguFace:480750533968396288>
lanks! did u see my message
<:StellaPout:631887932843622411>
and how am i supposed to see that
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
your profile only shows a hibiki and miku. and a girl i dont know.
<:Sadge:789574212754079805>
tell me
nothing else screams potential to be best anime from thumbnails
never seen it but im gonna actually guess durarara?
u made a smug face. i thought u wanted a smug answer
or is it oreimo
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
highschool of the dead?
<:KannaSip:480753608045101076>
has millhi ever considered their own best year of anime
just caught up in bakarina
wait rezero author did that?
but then
forreal? i dropped at 1
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
remember the yuri on ice awards at crunchyroll?
<:SataniaEvil:480749092595826707>
i remember one anime about yuri on ice
which is wild to me cause this is one of those cases where i dont hear either of the voices in either role
shes raphtalia
i wish more people watched that over her squirrl counterpart
i crave a season 4
each season is just better than the last to me
its so good
lmao
can i just say one thing about all our lists. im super happy Chihayafuru is all chilling at 9s for us
who
<:whatidoCAT:630462601796780032>
why do these things appeal to an audience
https://tenor.com/view/the-simpsons-homer-simpson-bush-hide-bye-gif-16150806
so like a maid or butler?
what is kowtowing
Dogeza: I Tried Asking While Kowtowing
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
i wonder why
he voiced the MC of the new vanguard and i think he sounds super weird there. but his other roles he sounds great
is that geordo VA?
these anime original episodes are fantastic
||man that genderswap scene was amazing. all the girls sound great voicing guys. the guys voicing girls was pretty funny too. with geordo sounding... way too good as a princess||
Keep them coming as long as they're good
not like theres much this season to keep up with anyways
yea its still just setting up
<:Sadge:789574212754079805>
<@!278860841485598720> what a waste to cut hair.
it feels like its adapting a fantasy story from a book or something. that doesnt have the tropes you'd expect from an anime
its def one of the prettiest shows this season
yea it feels very not anime
i just finished ep 1
<:MeguFace:480750533968396288>
<@!278860841485598720> talk to me about pirate princess
<@278860841485598720> how has that been anyways? I wanna try it but I feel like the show idea will get boring to me after a couple of episodes
Maybe they all relate to the mc
I feel like mecha needs two categories. Mecha -for when someone pilots a robot, and then everything else
Well granblem  is totally  mech with their SD robots lol
Ed especially lol
With a catchy af op and Ed for me
Just one of those shows lost to time
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
MC entire house gets isekaid with her
It's a old af isekai mecha anime
Melua did you ever watch Maze the megaburst space?
Back when isekai wasn't a gimmick
I legit forgot that it had mecha in it
It just gets nutty in s2
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Itsnt super star a really late Monday show
Also I think it's funny how slime is the only Tuesday show
Lies
Spider side is never serious. Human side can be at time but nobody cares about that side
man to your eternity sure has been ugly the past few episodes
<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
I was thinking of the ragnarok isekai
Oh wait
WHY
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
New fav what
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Idol amazing or actually amazing
Wild. It's like 9pm for me
<a:worryStab:647232976668721162>
No
*shakes head*
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
You think I want real? 2D only my guy <@279341087494242304>
Away with you!
U ain't an anime dog girl streamer
<a:worryStab:647232976668721162>
Korone is all you need
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
Much better meme than gatekeeper for fire emblem heroes
Was it? That's funny af
i liked the show up to season 3 tho season 2 was the highest point for me. season 4 was def a downard spiral
i havent watched it at all. its been that bad?
AoT 0
itll be a prequel movie
and AoT The Final Movie after part 4
im gonna try to finish some animes from last season i was watching with buddies but i havent hung out with them in like months
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
maaan those pets were cute af. i love their addition
i was at episode 7 or 8
i dont think i even got that far lol
i think my brain had like a premonition cause i stopped at the episode people tell me it went bad and i was like huh. so i got all the good episodes and just stopped for no reason
i still remember people telling me wonder egg went to poop at the end
always a possibility
i go into seasons usually pretty clueless on what people are excited for outside of the order of people already liking a show on MAL
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
people hyped up record of ragnarok and we all saw what happened to that
i mean maybe? the past two seasons were way better than they ever shouldve been and i assume that was cause a lot of animes got pushed back thanks to covid and they got more production time than usual
if next season has a few bangers. im pretty sure 2021 will jump up to my like 2nd favorite year of anime
thats fair. that takes a lot of time
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
discluding this current season. the last two seasons have been fucking fire yo. where u been
Oh boy. Brb
U can revert to the old style in the game settings
The story is stupid af anyways. I have zero interest in ever playing the VN
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I don't need more trash to appreciate good animes for like a decade
I tortured myself watching yu-no
Also had some cool ideas in general
I don't get enjoyment out of bad shows. Unless it's like happy sugar life. That was an amazing train wreck to watch
~~who needs anime when vtubers are around every day.~~
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
Watch it do poorly cause people too busy watching redo s2
<:angryy:365154380749733889>
Streisand can mind her own damn business
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
Well u get more seasons of bad animes instead
Exactly. It didn't deserve two more season announcements especially now that the hook of the show is gone
<a:worryStab:647232976668721162>
Wheres my kemono jihen s2 announcement
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
Where as the good animes are stuck at one season
First shield hero gets two more seasons. And now this shit.
God dammit
Redo is getting a season 2?
Wait
But Every 5 or so panels I feel like sex is happening.
I really can't imagine parallel paradise ever getting adapted tho
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
That'll be great until it hard turns
Makes me think of the conception game tho. Mate to survive
Ah. Nothing lewd. Rip
I need a senran Kagura udon art book
I'm imaging a section of just speedo buff dudes
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Why is this a thing

Was looking at other art books and came across this
I just saw right stuf selling it for 30 bucks. 10 bucks off. I think I'm gonna buy a second copy.
I wish I could remove the binding easily so I could frame the art onto walls to appreciate
Had little notes from the artist on almost every image usually
It's so good
<@712002916403380285> the only art book I've ever bought
I remember reading a small blurb about G6 heroine and how he had issues with drawing her since he made her boobs so big lol
Lol
I'm still sad we never got Growlanser 6
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>

<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
I think he's the reason I prefer hard edges in anime
Lol. Man I've always loved his art since I learned of him with growlanser generations
Nah fuck that for this game.
You absolutely need a guide for the VN or you're gonna waste so much time
Which is.... not a good VN imo
I think world end syndrome on the switch was my last thing
I haven't read a VN in a hot minute
<a:worryStab:647232976668721162>
Best of both worlds
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
I've always thought that. VN have detail of manga. But the color and voice acting of an anime
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's funny how VNs were the thing back in the day and now it's phone games and LN
Robotics notes
Steins gate
I liked shuffle back when it came out. No clue if id like it now
<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
Higurashi is so ugly to me now though.
I've been really hoping this doesn't end up like the other muvluv anime. That was such a disappointment
<:asagicringe:851512873985507378>
No It has a conclusive ending imo
Oh no. What a tragedy
Just play the cop route
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
I'm glad that's the one thing u remember
I hate her so much
But fuck the route dealing with the "main heroine"
I honestly don't remember if I did her route. I know for sure I did the shrine maiden and the older woman cop.
Ayakashibito was good. <@87512939107450880> which route did you do
Also the chronicles games
That shits so good
Muv luv alternative is a lvl of animation I've yet to see replicated in VNs
I did. I normally don't until I get my first ending. But shit that would be atrocious here
The actual scenes are nice. But man fuck finding them
It's very tedious
You get like 15 areas to randomly explore 3 times a day. And you gotta find the waifus to possibly activate events or gain affection
As a what
I'd recommend  kaleido star personally. It's an oldie but goodie. But I can't say there's zero NSFW. It definitely isn't interested in being lewd at least
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
I feel like zero NSFW is a tall order if u want a Yuri show. Could probably get some good shoujo ai shows tho
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
||which usually ends in death||
I like to see what I would've gotten as my own personal ending
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
I do tend to only use a guide on playthru 2+
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
How so
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Do they go down to the blacksmith 40 billion times like the anime. Wasting as much time as possible? Instead of doing stuff with chars
Maybe I'd like the VN more
~~I'm one of those people who think angel beats isn't a good anime~~
One of the best HG out there
Hobby lobby selling moon gundam for 40% off retail price is such a steal
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
Yea the quality of high grades today (as long as they don't use an old af mold) are so good for still only 10-20 bucks. Vs that 10+ years ago
I'm honestly surprised Bandai has been able to keep gunpla fairly cheap
I think we just make more money now vs in the past lol
<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
Or a single perfect grade
Like one scale is worth 4ish master grades
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's cheap compared to most hobbies honestly. Like anime figures. Etc
Noice
I need a zaku II unleashed
Forreal. I honestly am tired of RX-78-2 kits but I want that PG unleashed so badly
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Noice! I want more PGs but a lot of them are old af
I actually don't remember. My last big purchases were the Penelope gundam HG and the Exia PG
<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
Well I haven't tried to buy a master grade since...
Huh
Is it pbandai stuff?
I didn't realize gunpla was getting scalped at all.
Ah
<:StellaPout:631887932843622411>
Who said I'm selling
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~hides all the dupes I bought at hobby lobby~~
Also true
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
It's been a pretty quiet year for master grades
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I didn't like sao before it was cool to not like it
I have no clue what's Canon or not.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But I never bothered
Well the small s3 exists and a few ovas
Honestly I think a lot of depressed people go online to do nothing and end up always talking about how anime is bad cause they themselves are just unhappy in general.  Obv u don't gotta like everything but when you think 90% of anime u watch is awful. You either don't like anime and should stop. Or you just can't enjoy anything atm thanks to depression.
I didn't watch more of that cause I was satisfied how s2 ended back in the day
ahhh
Uhhh. No clue on that one then.
People are jaded and have rose tinted glasses towards anime of old and think nothing new is good compared to it
What's sotsu
Zelda cd-i
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
The back half of the anime was so poorly animated. I don't want more action
Good one
Lol u think we will get a season 2
Normally I'd be like. Boo humans, get back to the spider
I wish I had more spider personally. I enjoyed every scene with her.
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
Aoi yuuki is best when she's a  homicidal child in war
<:prinnythink:851513073122017341>
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
But then id have almost no anime to watch per season
i know. it would just be super cool if anime was profitable to the point where a company totally could commit to a fully finished novel or manga so we could get a full adaptation
i dont have an issue with manga. but i think its wild how we have this medium that exists thats mainly done just to advertise another medium. its like if Walking dead only had 4 seasons and was like, whelp go read the comics for the rest of the story
<a:aworryBanBoom:731347073336868896>
anime for life!
<:doge:496780220309962772>
i look at animes that have had 3-4 seasons and still dont have an ending and think man. this couldve been a mecha show and been over already
<:KannaSip:480753608045101076>
thats almost two full gundam shows
gundam has been doing it for almost 4 decades now. no wonder i glomped onto it. sure the shows might not always be the best. but hey i got a full story out of it
<@!279341087494242304> <@!87512939107450880> <@!99695384296701952> so i had a personal epiphany today. i think i finally cracked the code on why i love mecha/gundam shows so much. 90% of the shows.. actually end. theres no sequel bating, no go read the manga cause we could only adapt so much. its donezo finished you got the full package. i was thinking of build fighters, then majestic prince, originally Code geass before the movie. etc. since a lot of my most recent favorite shows are anime original with endings like say Akudama Drive that end. my brain finally connected the dots.
<:asagicringe:804515368692351016>
I clicked replay but also unclicked it at some point.
<@213645184125239317>
Im always surprised 00 didnt have a spin off/side story series. ||Following the sumeragi ship into deepspace,couldve made an interesting story out of it and still have tieria||
<a:bcaHeadPatts3:592612550323994624>
I like you. You a good person
Appreciated
Okay cool. I was leaning towards 08th but its been multiple decades since ive watched anything that old. Just needed some reaffirmation
Like full metal panic in a way but with gundam
IBO shpuldnt have had interstellar travel. It shouldve been a way more grounded show imo
Curious on your thoughts
<@99695384296701952> without context of OG gundam. Which side story would be the easiest to digest? 08th ms, stardust memory or war in the pocket
Dub is hilariously entertaining if u do english. Good luck! If you cant stomach the animation of old try some of the shorter side stories or Gundam wing.
Ibo is best on the ground for combat but its like 75% space fights and looks lame without flashy lasers to break up the blackness of space
More laying in bed doing nothing time
True
True chazoku. But it's fine for the most part. Especially since the revenge is over. It'll be a very standard fantasy now probably
I mean those people exist
Taking out the horrible stuff just makes it shield hero really lol
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
I only watched like one episode of interspecies but I found it funny how only humans liked older elves cause their mana is stale to species who perceive it. But to us dumb humans we just see pretty gurl
<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
I'm only just now realizing it's redo of healer and not redo the healer
For tv it was
I ask that of interspecies reviewers as well
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Of the very little I watched. I can say the pink hair girl does too good of a job simulating pain noises.
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
It will one day but hopefully it's not for many decades
The dragon girl and boy turned girl are the only good chars of the human side
Sounds awful
Everyone outside of hero party is a dumb as a box of rocks
I just think the anime is kinda boring
I mean I like naofumi. He don't let people push him around.
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Redo is like an eye for an eye. But to the batshit extreme.
Rimiru has to take care of an entire country afterall
It was more gaining things like political allies, or national level stuff. Rimuru has accomplished quite a bit in that dialog with nations
<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
In general or u want a specific genre
I haven't yet
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I honestly think isekai will never be phased out sadly
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
Yes it's interesting how they can have 24 episodes and still nothing happens
And harems
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
When I was a horny teen yes. But now it's not really an interesting archetype to me
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Never got around to part three tho. They lost me when MC went ||badguy||
That was decent
I watched Shana dubbed too
I'd like to avoid rie if possible
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Is the dub good?
I never tried toradora
<a:kleeMad:838482900487372870>
Fucking deus ex machina buklshit in the season 2 finale
Screw louse the zero show in general
I'm sure a good one exists but man I can't think of any off the top of my head
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Thank god
I feel like loli tsuns in general have faded into the background. Sure they're there still but nowhere near to the degree in the 2000s
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I can't stand kugimiya anymore. She's only tolerable to me in world trigger since she's playing a not loli there
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
Tanaka and Takahashi yes. Kugimiya no
Reminds me of that one chick who almost exclusively played tsundere lolis back in the 2000s
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm sure a lot of girls would
Fuck clayman
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
||The manga made a bigger show of the hit. Made you really get as mad as rimuru||
<a:kleeMad:838482900487372870>
Gimme next episode
Oh boy that final shot of rimuru was so good
Man hitting me with the feels
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
The way to your eternity ended
I killed millhi f9r nothing
Fuk
<a:worryStab:647232976668721162>
I won't let u
Actively watching like 3 shows and then 3-4 more if I'm bored and have nothing to do
I'm pretty  happy this season of anime was pretty weak. I don't feel like I'm always playing catch up
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
I'd rather build gunpla
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
I'm ready for to your eternity. Last episode made a crazy psycho have some cute face scenes and I'm like... I know she's fucking crazy but God damn they can draw her cute sometimes
Gonna watch all my animes today
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Remember when he forgot SS2 was a thing?
He did once in the buu  saga.

<a:aworryMadNodders:788410984527036416>
<@152896851660505088> <@279341087494242304> there better be a living la Vida loca song in there
<:CoconaSweat:480753608023998472>
Wew. I looked at what goods exist for tomo on mfc. And man there's some official lewd stuff
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Also I'm not a fan of seikon but the blue haired girl has some really good... art
<:HuTaoAYAYAY:806234426572668949>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Is it filled with ||naked oppai||
<:HuTaoAYAYAY:806234426572668949>
It's like konosuba if they aren't completely incompetent
I would. It's entertaining. Looks good. Has some pretty decent comedy. And the characters are fun.
If u want a good isekai this season. Tsukimichi moonlit fantasy is the best option
<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
To be fair. What could you possibly have in there that could affect an entire planets government.
<:madotehe:623221369726959616>
But that's my opinion
I found the truth of the box to be a good reveal after watching gundam through the years
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
We need to show u more mecha stuff
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That's anime for ya
Animation wise
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
From the one episode I watched. It didn't look particularly good either
Reminds me of this way to describe animes you don't care about. I forget the exact anime but the reviewer was like. "Out of all the animes I've watched in my life, this one definitely one of them."
Hormiya, Mushoku Tensei, Kemono Jihen, Bottom Tier Character Tomozaki-kun, I Killed slimes for 300 years, SSSS Dynazenon. Are all shows I consider good from start to finish that I've watched so far to completion that happened this year. That aren't Season 2s
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Lbx girls ended up being good? I'm surprised. I've only heard mediocre things about it
Yes
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
It's such a chunky boy
I love the zz gundam design
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
I feel like ZZ gundam is the buu saga of gundam. Lots of great moments but also lots of wat moments
<:HuTaoAYAYAY:806234426572668949>
You're nice melua. Top tier in my book
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Also I enjoy the I'll kill u meme of Wing tier lol
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
00 is one of my favorite gundam shows
It kept taking me out of the anime personally. I couldn't keep watching it
Even the weird af sound affects? Like a metal baseball bat instead of making a clank noise makes like a wet bag hitting something noise.
The most recent getter airing right now? I dropped it after one episode. Weird ass pacing. Even weirder sound effects.
<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
Imagine 00 world if the solar reactors powers the earth. Near infinite energy with no negative byproduct
<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
How did they even make psychoframe in the first place
I always found it funny how the company that makes psychoframe has no idea why it reacts how it does to newtypes. Like how do u make that stuff
<a:InaDrool:754429665980055594>
IRUMA KUN WAS SO GOOD. IM SO HAPPY. BEST EPISODE OF THE SHOW. HELL BEST EPISODE OF THE YEAR
AGGHHHHHH
They have to compete with luffy?
<:asagicringe:804515368692351016>
<:CirnoSip:480753607449378827>
Oh so not that dark
<:TheSaddest:480749091995779094>
What happens to oppai girl
These girls suffer?
Wait
I did not realize oppai girl was wheelchair bound
I was gonna say kill la kill but it's pretty obv it's kon
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I prefer the sequel. Getter robo go home.
I have that mugi one!
Oh dang you got some real goodies
<@245359314980569100> I'm home. Gonna look at all your photos now
I think everyone rooted against them in that fight lol
Tryon 3 should've won. MCs were the bad guys
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
If only the zeong had one of those
Gotcha
Oh can the head cannon only fire once?
They're like the size of the canisters on the sinanju
I love how stupidly huge the beam sabers are
Oh okay. I thought I was misrememberjng lol
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
His face opens up? I thought it was a forehead beam
I just like how they went super sleak with the Zeta gundam then went full chonk
I love chonker mobile suits
Domon is all u need
<:noeltrauma:792937451139629056>
Kinda like how the build strike fights the kaempfer in the op
I was smilling like a doofus the whole time
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
You marry her
<a:aworryMadNodders:788410984527036416>
Yea but u didn't @mac specifically to watch her songs
~~Dats the joke~~
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
U met cocoa cause of me. I sent u the video first
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
All I need personally is umu in my life
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
I dunno. Is it?
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
The threesome route
Show meh
But that's it
I know umu got a bride outfit that covered her more than the first game
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Why would it be censored? I assumed since the first one prob didn't sell well CCC wouldn't either especially with the vita either around the corner or already out I think
<@199928870810419200> you seen the carnival phantasm grand order version op? I fucking love how umu and og Saber are always angry looking at each other for every scene they're in
In still sad we never got CCC
Fate/extra made her so good
Just play battle moons wars and absorb FSN that way. Like I did
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

cypher go to bed
why is it longer than a jp opening
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
<:ChrisHibikiHug:630262562361049121>
because i enjoy when you use words
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnx_ec6UKlM
no bad arc so far unlike s1 that wasted like 8 episodes on kirio
s2 has been really fucking good imo
basically a newtype since seed didnt have those ~~except two did actually exist~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
who says the ultimate cooridinator couldnt have been her instead
~~if gundam allowed girls to do anything, wouldve been nice to see cagalli step up and kinda become the protector like kira was~~
ahhh
TSA?
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
<@99695384296701952> gundam seed song popped into my autoplay and had me thinking. What would gundam seed had been like if ||Kira had actually died at the hands of athrun and he had to deal with that guilt.||
To make so they thought why not
Not that I heard of. Wouldn't be shocked tho. Was prob too cheap
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
also too many children
I just wish she would take it off in town.(or ever)
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Me and aria watched that together. It was very... boring
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Ah well. Seemed fine to my anime only eyes
The ending was original? It felt like the typical cliffhanger for a s2
Decent watch. Nothing spectacular but an interesting subject. Just a bit slow paced
cause theres nothing. his reveal is the only thing that made him matter. before then he was pointless
easily the least interesting char in the show that got waaaay to many episodes dedicated to him
||before the reveal||
glasses dude who is basically another iruma
<a:karinwave_a:654566642612699146>
Have fun
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
3 terabyte HDD can hold a lot of anime
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
People have issues with space?
I still just torrent. Never had issues
(at least fro the first series)
thats cause builders is top tier. and gives us what we want
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@!202444817043685386> https://www.siliconera.com/the-idolmaster-starlit-season-new-character-aya-will-join-the-rival-unit/
i agree, philia and strea are way better than the anime waifus that exist
u arent missing much
It could make them more tolerable. I don't have an issue with time even with 12 hour work days
Also give them a budget of more than a MCchicken
They'll give us more. But not the ones you want
I blame u the next time we get one season with 7 isekai in it
<a:worryStab:647232976668721162>
You're apart of the issue
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I hate the word sakuga personally.
Isekai makes me think of when Sakuga started being used to define things you used to just call beautiful or pretty af.
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
West likes to overcomplicate things
That's the difference imo
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
That would be after 2010 still
I'd say isekai are animes post like 2010 that deal with traveling to another world. Cause sure those exist before 2010 but you are definitely getting a specific type of anime when you use the word isekai.
Millhi arm scares me
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Again. Being trapped in a video game doesn't mean isekai
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
People shouldn't. Cause it's not
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
What about it.
It's not like overlord or log horizon
Being trapped in a video game =/= isekai
Yes it does. Sao isn't an isekai until the alicization arc imo.
Well they log out and do normal world stuff. So yes. I wouldn't call it an isekai
And thats a very specific genre that outside of Kuma and average abilities. I don't think I really exists
Bofuri isn't an isekai but I get where you're coming from
well seeing as next episode is the last one. i dont think it will
i legit dont see the benefit for keeping him around
b ruh
such a quick teleport and done kind of job
<:StellaPout:631887932843622411>
millhi i really want slime to ||just fucking go kill that other isekai dude already. he's only ever been trouble to him||
booty sells
<:monkaHmm:789574860900270110>
also veldora new ryu/ken confirmed?
not what i expected on the cover but aight lol
huh
that exists?
<:monkaHmm:789574860900270110>
tho i am curious on what manga he read to learn SF moves
also i like the little touches like giving him a super saiyan aura for a second
i assum another SF move
its the only thing i didnt recognize
whats tetsuzanko from btw
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
i agree also looked good
normally im not a fan of straight ripping moves like how average abilities did with the spirit gun and what not. but i enjoyed it here
<a:ArtiaThumbsUp:687600039945830458>
good old Street fighter Cross DBZ
<:monkaHmm:789574860900270110>
i thought this was streetfighter
<a:kleeMad:838482900487372870>
Speaking of isekai tho. Hurry up slime!
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I got bored after one episode so I didn't notice
Wait mappa is doing remain?
Mappa has been pretty based for most of the anime I've watched from it
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
But the sliding jpegs!
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
so ive been catching up with my seasonal animes and boy is bokutachi no remake a huge disappointment
The most recent episode might be been my favorite tho
It's criminally underwatched and I want more people to talk to about it
Give it a shot. It's my fav show this season along with tsukimichi
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
My ptw list is every new anime
U should try kageki shoujo
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
yes ash same energy lol
usually i dont even notice offmodel animation but holy shit do i see it all the time in GF GF
nah man that shows animation is dog doodoo. ive never seen so much offmodel animation in awhile. and the constant screaming is very annoying at times
forgot they existed for a hot minute
oh wait i also watched bakarina and realist but neither of those have been amazing
so this season been a bit anemic for me personally
for me personally, kageki shoujo. slime, moonlit fantasy and 5 seconds to battle (which i wouldnt even put this in the good category. just as a  guilty pleasure. like people who watch girlfriend girlfriend)
nice.
has that been decent? i tried the intial two episodes and it didnt really grab me
i didnt realize fena was called fena. ive been calling it pirate princess
ahhhh
what are those last two? fena and boochan?
<:KannaSip:480753608045101076>
its hard to say stacked until we find out if the new shows suck or not
<:KannaSip:480753608045101076>
e
I have not looked at anything for next season. I just know of Demon slayer. Mushoku tensei and worlds end harem
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
We will never have another wild year like this
No it doesn't. There's just a metric fuckton of good stuff in the past two seasons compared to this one that's more anemic imo
Ehhh... it's okay at best compared to the last two seasons and what's to come next season
Discluding this season. This whole year was stacked
show was a high 7 or low 8 in the beggining. stuck around a 7ish until episode 7 and fell to probably a 5 or 4 imo. its just boring now.
yea i just personally dont care about the current arc and i feel like it couldve only used one episode to get the point to the MC and then ||send him back to the past|| i feel like all these new chars are pointless at the end of the day
i liked when he tried to kill people irl
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
i remember thinking man this team really needs a melee dps. then william happened. and i was like oh finally. then xana happened
aelita had magic bs
read my message please
cypher
fans?
im trying to remember the squads weapons. brown hair had a sword. blonde dude had his claws/projectiles he could shoot. what could the girl do again
<:monkaHmm:789574860900270110>
he was taken over last i remember
i stopped around the 5th member being added. or maybe it just stopped airing where i was lol
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the kids having huge forheads
i remember
yea i remember the nerd only logging in off screen and everyone making fun of how he looked
got that yellow fever
it was an aquarion op cover
sounds like a no
<:StellaPout:631887932843622411>
<:monkaHmm:789574860900270110>
hey cypher did u ever listen to the song i posted in music channel for u?
for all the nerd knows. shes a hyper advanced ai
neither does aelita
yea but we dont know that zero at the time
<a:kleeMad:838482900487372870>
couldve been making weapons to help his buddies but had to speak to his 3dcg waifu
<:asagicringe:804515368692351016>
fucking simp
i mean to be fair he spent almost all his free time down there
yes
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
copy paste the katana coding to give everyone katans
gimme a gun
also why did the nerd take so long to program new weapons
im trying to remember the rules of the game. if they got hit 3 time they died and had to leave the game. but why couldnt they just relog back in
yea when he reversed the teleport tech
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
i like his voice. especially when he eats a chip
i wish i could watch all of megaman NT warrior.
never see nthat one
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
dick dick van dick
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>

<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
I guess it depends on how good the mid-season char is. I remember being annoyed slightly in gokaiger when silver ranger took the show but then he ended up being the best char in the show so I didn't mind it
||graham acker you say||
ive actually been trying to get rid of my manga collection (and gaming and anime collections) cause honestly they just sit there and do nothing for years
space that could be put up with figures
i used to do thst then i realized all the space that takes up
well yea manga is meant to be consumed. while figures are more art you buy to enjoy looking at occasionally
~~got swimsuit of the trio~~
yea if u dont give a shit about the waifu. its kinda pointless
its a fun hobby but god damn is it expensive af now
also this one
oh hey i can still send emotes
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i stopped years ago
my favorite fate figure i own
i love eternal blaze
i knew that part
oh fate is voiced by nana? nice
yea i got a bunch of figures of her
testerossa
it was. the plot ended at s1. it was complete. if theres an anime that was good and really didnt need a season 2. it was bakarina
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
s2 barely had a point
why
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
the price of games are still stupid I see... maybe I can get some new anime figures in exchange
I'm gonna be using next week to basically collect any games or shows of value and start eBay listing them to get rid of them
That is a good question. I could not tell u off the top of my head. Most of it is older manga. It's all boxed up since I moved. I can check it on Sunday or Monday if you're curious at all
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
cant aim. cant move
i swear if you arent a teenager in seed. you are basically just stand there to die fodder
one of the biggest nitpicks i had early on. was when the blue villian dude goes to shoot athrun. and he dodges the laser and he's shocked and thinks WOW hes good! is avoiding enemy fire NOT TAUGHT WHEN YOU ARE IN THE MILITARY OR SOMETHING?
i had issues episode one
i at least enjoyed the first half of aldnoah zero. unlike destiny
<:CarolBullying:816901978432733194>
that gives it some points
ehhh.. aldnoah doesnt take as long to finish so the torture ends sooner
i feel like most if not all the cast of SEED got assassinated in destiny if they arent kira
kira is a fine protagonist until he survives the main clash and aquires the freedom gundam. thats when he ascends to jesushood
<:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>
its got some of the best songs of gundam man, invoke, ignited, meteor, akatsuki no kuruma. etc.
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
gundam seed has good mecha designs and banger ost. and thats it
This harem needs to shrink already. Or stop having everyone have apparently no life outside of being Katarina entourage
Which would be nice
Tho Nicol ||looks like he might fall in love with someone who's not katarina||
Everyone else has been static
And the brother. But that was only the most recent ep
Which confuses me why it's getting a movie
Which is fair. There's no substance to it anymoew
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
||The genderbent|| dream was the best one tho
That was an anime only episode I was told
She got the friendship ending. It's all good
Like the goal of the story happened. What else is there? Lol
Well whatever it adapted peaked Hella early cause nothing after s1 feels like it needs to exist. All filler content
but not as epic
sounds like misfit at demonschool academy
looks fine to me

<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Thats cause of how long it was to fool her.
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>
saber?
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
Best key anime
I love kanon
Isn't the last one called (3.0+1.0) and not just 4.0? Lol
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I should try the eva movies at some point. I'm afraid my bias towards the TV series wouldn't make me able to enjoy the movies tho
And yes u right zero
Sangatsu I had to Google.
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
Never tried the last two. But who doesn't at least know the Gintama name
What's above it now
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Single favorite anime of all time. Huh
And them wasting time going underground like 3 times
I only remember the episodes I mentioned earlier
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
A large portion of the anime is forgettable
I mightve liked it when it aired but I Def forgot it even existed until u mentioned it right now lol
I think angel beats had some good to great episodes. Like the first 2. The final one. And the flash back. But everything between those three moments is forgettable/boring. Solid like C+ to B- anime
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
~~angel beats is good? News to me~~
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Shana is a 10
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Chars counterattack is a 10?
Cypher we need to talk
That's why I stopped anime
Mood
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Main character is adorable
I enjoyed that anime a lot
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
<@87512939107450880> go finish arte
*leaves*
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
Made in abyss movie is my 10/10 anime movie
I'd give the movie an 8 or maybe a 9
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Well hurry up and finish it cypher
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Cypher should get to finishing that gundam lancer campagin
ALSO smile down the runway
A damn shame
I wanna shout out Kageki shoujo. It's already being lost and forgotten and it's currently airing
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
U remind me I still haven't watched bodacious space pirates
I think a lot of good anime are not talked about a year or more after they come out is cause there's just so much new anime now a year.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I like not paying for movies
wait
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I have like 125ish shows on my dropped list
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
U can love the first half of season 1. But that second half just destroys any chance of a good score
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
ALO makes it no way above a 7
Sao is a 9... bruh
a 4th of the anime I've ever watch is in my dropped section lol
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
Cypher does what I do
4
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
<@87512939107450880> I see never land is rated a 10. How about s2
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
To be fair. I drop animes I don't like so all my completed animes would probably be 6+ lol
Bro I don't even remember what happens in the show in any order lol
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I bet Cypher felt a lot when the brother and sister were making out with saliva dripping
Just watch it dubbed like I did fz
Did I type it before u? Lol
But why
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Also I recommend slayers dubbed. And not subbed
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Fz needs to be forced to watch good shows
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Cypher u already know I consider Lina the best female in anime
A webtoon or whatever
Solo leveling is like tower of God I thought
I can't wait for solo leveling hero
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
Tower of God is a 9. I aprob
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Wait. Charlotte is a 9? Didn't everyone hate that show
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
World trigger season 1 is slow af. But world trigger season 2 was hype af
Yes
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
It deserves to be a 9 more than shield hero
Demon slayer rated lower than shield hero. I unfriend u
Bruh I can't fucking read that tiny ass picture
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
Zoids 9. Fuck yea
Cypher is making me want to rate all my shows
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
Shield hero is a 9? Damn when did Cypher become an incel
Sold
I might like It if the MC isn't as dense as a black hole
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Who would want to mimic garbage
You mean. I can't believe my giant alien girlfriend is this cute?
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
Yes
That's scary
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
God cazador is almost 15 years old now
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
Any time a game asked for a codename i used Blue Eyes from this
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Taco taco taco super tasty taco~
That was also a fun dub
I round down
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
So your 10 animes
Pretty sure it was still called ragna blade
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I still prefer the dub
And slayers has a great dub
I have to recommend good dubs when I get the chance. We don't get them often
<:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>
Ah yes I to believe in general equality where I can drop kick both men and women
~~So none of them~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I wonder how it feels to meet the people that are fans of your work and know that you've made them ||nut||
I love how they always make sure u could see the outline for the headband of her horns
She's great
This still needs a s2
I know I liked them before this anime but I think it helped solidify my taste
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Something about busty red heads is just so appealing
I would throw DxD in the mix if misfit doesn't work.
I want companies to just do crossovers with their animes.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Even had a chubby girl
They were great
Also his gaggle of fan girls
Misfit of demonschool academy
She had underwear one time
A girl sleeping in her underwear in your bed. Man I cant figure out why she would do that
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Ichika brain is busted yes
So if light novels exist. Does that mean heavy novels exist
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I got a mugi bunny figure here
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Box full of gunpla
I've had these for years
No I'm trying to see if I have any room in my storage to condense boxes
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm surprised I fit four 1/4 figures in here. Plus 3 other figures
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
What

Going thru some boxes Cypher I completely forgot I owned this
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Don't ask why I had that on the ready

Isekai have so much potential
And it's always them outside of school
Or if it is a high-school anime. It's barely shown
And the downfall of school battle animes
Thanks to the isekai boom
Not as much anymore honestly.
Im still trying to get Cypher to watch kageki shoujo
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh I know people have dropped shows I love. Or won't even try
School shows bore me. Personally
Tomoyo after ova best episode
Boring af
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I dropped og clannad
2020 felt like a decade man
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I've drop animes 2 episodes before completion
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
The fuck is sogururi
Hey man. There's nothing wrong with following the three episode rule
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Good old 3 episode rule
And then when I quit
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Isn't that anime like kinda super incoherent cause the books are as well
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Or 20
We talking like 15 pounds
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
But they're not labeled as heavy. Just novels
Only bitches need two hands
Like a boss
I liked the Oreimo manga which is different than the anime. Both plot wise and art style wise
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
I'll take one Borgar please
S2 hype
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Take girl literally anywhere. Maybe to a neighboring village and help her find work. Then bounce
Just cause there's worse doesn't mean her personality isn't shit
I dunno man. Knowing I could've stopped a suicide but didn't. Would weigh on me
Cute girl shit personality
Elaina is the worst
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Fuck majo no tabitabi. Sociopathic protag
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Does I Killed slimes for 300 years and maxed my level count as a slice of life?
I've been holding off on fafner cause I wanna show it to my bro and then go into the sequels blind with him
I watched og fafner and the prequel movie. I haven't watched anything past that
All the common gacha pulls is dumb
The gacha would be fine if they tweaked it slightly only rare blades and the items to pull on the gacha were rarer
<:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
~~xc2 hate intensifies~~
<:MillaarcPlead:663522911067570176>
I still like talking to fenny
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
I just feel bad about girl who died when she could've been saved
Damn I take back my idea
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
He would say something stupid like. Oh you think being in a different anime would prevent me from being here?
I'm so happy that anime is getting one
Misfit s2 hype
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
But if all the plant is dead. No issues
In that world? That's nothing
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I'd have burned it all man
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
She could've burned the flower fields to prevent more death
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Because most people have something called empathy
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Elaine is a good person? Is a huge X to doubt. She rarely does anything if it doesn't benefit herself.
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Also mondaiji color palette doesn't make me wanna stab out my eyes
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
What garbage is that
And it only got 10 eps too
The three protags of Mondaji are so much more fun and badass than Shiro and sora
Mondaji is the better NGNL
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
I'm angry now
Man fuck anime for not giving that a season 2. Infinite fanservice got a season 2 but not this
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I have multiple bunny girls. I showed cypher
Beating a boss. Getting 2 legendary cores. Then getting 2 common blades. Is not rewarding
My luck is notoriously bad
It's not even that. It's so hard to pull blades naturally. U gotta grind for more cores
It's a game with a finite amount of playtime
This ain't a gacha
Maybe at least increase the rates. There's literally no reason kosmos should be a .1% chance.
I don't wanna waste my time grinding. So I went thru a good portion of the game with almost no rare blades outside of the pity ones and the couple of side story ones
For a second I thought that was a different piece of bread sandwiched in  there
Good old meduka
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

I found the clusterfuck box
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@171395487247630336> how's order is a rabbit?
Where's the person who liked SoL animes
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
You're so good
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
I'm so happy I forgot I owned this
Character growth
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And he agrees
I like when the old demon lady explains the enchanted skirt that ALMOST let's u see panties but never does. And convinces the MC it's better that way
I almost bought her last week too
I forgot I owned this figure. Pog
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Oh
The giant robot named DEEN?
Of what
Sadistic jibril. Dumb busty steph. Etc.
I feel like all the girls filled some sort of fetish
Seirei had a cool first episode. But man it was all downhill after that
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<#377148557796442134>
Nice ash
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Not like foreigners will ever make a difference
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
That's not the context of the joke
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
~~how about symphogear then~~
Logic is flawed
Doesn't explain why infinite Stratos or date a live went past season 1
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
*looks at my blu ray of mondaiji*WHERES MY SEASON 2
I'm starting to think Otaku fans are so completionist that they will buy the blu rays of their favorite manga or LN regardless of quality to continue to support the IP they like
I don't get japan
This reminds me of when the endless 8 arc of Haruhi sold in 3-4 episode chunks. People still bought it. And it sold decently still.
That's a possibility.
I personally don't see how half-assed anime can make anyone want to read the source material for more.
Like I enjoyed slime and ascendence of a bookworm. Those make me wanna read farther ahead
But wouldn't a bad adaption turn people away from the original source?
I feel no sadness dropping seirei. Such a bottom tier show. I always wonder how these get greenlit with so little budget (and probably talent) and companies think it'll do well
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
The movie will go past the manga. They gotta use the LN
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Well whenever the movie happens the anime will finally overcome  the manga since it only gets one chapter a month
I've got not clue what happens after walpurgis
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Dunno about xv but most anime region free tend to be bootlegs usually. Damn ebay
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Don't trust region free anime blu rays
But that's way more money
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Lots of blu rays have extras consoles don't have tho. Like DVD uscalers to help make sub 480p content not look like shit in a 4k tv
I feel like i can tell the difference between a console and a dedicated playrr
I own a straight blu ray player
I buy them occasionally when cheap of a show I loved
I still think it's crazy aniplex sells enough anime on the west to keep doing it. Fans be wild
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Not companies
I meant people like us. Who wouldn't import anime cause who wants 3 episode disc's anymore
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
You had me in the first half ngl
GG. Nice knowing ya
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Of course
Nice eyes
Honestly it might be my favorite male protagonist isekai atm
One of the better isekai out there that's for sure.
Man tsukimitchi Moonlit fantasy had a great final episode. I'm so glad a s2 is already underway
Disgustang
I refuse to date boys
I was rooting for her
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
Kageki shoujo introduced a new girl romance. ||and she tries hard to hook up with a straight girl and fails.||
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
It's the only alternative I can think of.
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
Never!
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Og madoka had issues too?
Lol I Google it and my first result was episode 6 reddit discussion
Forreal?
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I mean I wouldn't say I'm a shounen fan. I'll watch anything if I think its good. No matter the genre
But pretty shit
Not all shit
S4 had some good moments
They needed to hit rock bottom first
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Maybe they can bring it back around
Oof. MHA is pretty great up to s2. Decent for s3. Then s4 is pretty downhill
I didn't even try this season. That bad?
Made me laugh more than it should have
Just got 5 seconds to battle left to finish for this season
Just finished 86. Good anime, I recommend it 7.5-8/10. 
realist hero was pretty boring 5/10
Kageki shoujo was a cute show, very un animelike. 8/10
Tsukimichi was hilarious and fun 8.5-9/10
No. That was the worst part of the show
At least the ending makes me interested in a s2
Started off decent. Then went to pretty meh territory.
I'm surprised nobody told the MC how amazing he was in the final episode
Lol
There's so much yuri undertones in kageki
It did. It was enjoyable. I don't expect a 2nd season. But I'm satisfied with it
Even if the other 7 are bad
At least there's one good isekai a season usually.
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I mean what isn't copy pasting nowadays
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Yea getting 30-40 shows a season nowadays is disgusting
I feel like early this year and end of last year had a lot of above average looking shows cause everything got pushed back initially thanks to covid. But that's  just me
The last time I saw a delayed mid airing was the final episode of azur lane. Cause like the 2nd half was getting really shit production wise
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Don't u love when animes get shafted
How was s1 of magireco? Anything wild there
I've never seen that honestly
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
You can have the most amazing story but if it's ugly AF. I'm not gonna be interested in the anime
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Well it doesn't change the fact it's important even if it doesn't affect your personal viewing
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Poor animation can ruin the best of shows. Look at 7 deadly sins season 3
If I didn't care for animation I'd read light novels
An anime suffers if either point is lacking
In an animated medium
I would argue both are important
Anyone remember the shounen Mushibugyo
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Season 3? When it was a one season show?
Lol true. Some are luckier than others
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Man this series is cursed
im excited to see this bomb tho. ive legit not seen any advertising for this anywhere. like nobody knows its happening
code geass had magical robots at the end of s2 lol
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
maybe theyre cute animal robots with sparkly inside engines
<:GermainPeace:689397094666076171>
gundam 00 units have sparkly engines. that means nothing to me
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
but maybe theyre the bad magic. like kyuubei
i cant tell if theyre robots or not
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
there seems to be no magic powers tho. unless those little creatures have powers
Rip dad
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
If I had known I'd have done a 20 for the lulz
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Imagine a thousand dollars
Damn that's wild
Im sorry what
I would argue killing people's ambition/passion is a worse life. But I also lack that and wish I had it
Just buy bitcoin
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
But he is amazing so
Also kyoya able to acclimate to that life so fast. Is so unrealistic.
I wouldn't. Knowing I fucked up my friends lives would've ate at me
That threw me for a loop
Also am I the only one who thought ||the blonde artist in the future was a teen. And not the age of the MC||
I'm rooting for kasegawara or hanako
~~Shinoaki worst girl~~ at least ||the future version didn't sound 5 years old anymore||
Ah
That exists?
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Nobody is a fan of the BETA tho
But still super fast paced
I feel like u could cram it into 24 if u skip scenes that aren't really needed and don't make the fights like an hour like the VN
||since one of them is like one of the only survivors at the end||
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Also are they gonna keep in the girls from the non muvluv games.
What's the point of putting a certain red head on a large portion of the poster ||when she won't exist for most of the show||
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Did people like ot?
Sounds boring
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Wait it's alternative? ||how will they explain that he's done all this once already||
I forgot. Is it unlimited timeline or alternative timeline
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Oh god
There's still a chance
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Hopefully it doesn't suck
Rip solo
If it sucks like the first one. No
Ikr? We get not one but two trashfire animes before the season even started
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
The assassin isekai is by redo of healer author.
86, mushoku tensei and demon slayer are my main watches. With all the isekai trash as well I'm sure. And worlds end harem
I feel like next season is gonna be wild with the bad animes
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
Hell yea. I'm down for that stupidity
Is the last one the isekai where the MC meets a gorilla
God damn
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Hunter hunter ptsd
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
If this was Playstation it would just be boobs. No omega allowed
Date a live rip off looks more like a taimanin girl lol
I feel like some of those designs aren't really close at all. But yea some of straight rips but with bigger boobs lol
Ah
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
What property is stealing all these
Stolen art? Nice
Wait u can lvl DOWN?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
She is indeed a low fat snack
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Go away millhi
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Which one. The dark one or the light fluffy one
Rebirth 1. You didn't even see neptunia at its lowest
They're all the same, Forrest, cave, snow, etc. They're just the same layouts with a different texture on top
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
A game that doesn't use sound effects from their games from the 90s. Or reuse their mobs for 90% of the games. Having more than like 3 dungeon layouts. Actually fun combat
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And? Games existed before then that were good af
I enjoy gundam games and quite a few of those are subpar products.

U can have fun with mediocrity
It's neptunia. It'll never not be mediocrity at its finest
id argue its not necessary. this aint battle of gods or ressurecction F.
the movie is already top tier. i cant see it getting any better
boo
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
first 7 episodes of demon slayer is just gonna be the movie with some added scenes
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Senran kagura animes are bad too so that's pretty par for course
God. Ps1 Era sound effects in a ps5 game
Like sound effects
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Lots
I get carried away with things I like that could be better
<@87512939107450880> sorry I didn't mean to poop on something u like so much
Back to work I go
I'm just salty cause I feel like if a better developer could make neptunia instead of compile heart. We could get a cool anime game series.
Okey
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Lol plot in a neptunia game. Good one
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
But we are like 6 games in and that's still a majority of the jokes
Sure it's cute I the first game
But it's boring to make like 90% references.
And it's comedy don't land with me. It's usually hey let's reference better game that exists. Ain't that cool? At least for the first game or two
It's usually just a bunch of fucking around or memes
Debatable but sure
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Now it's just meh. Which is an upgrade. But still not good
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
That bate system was atrocious
Yea
its like a second movie
okay im hyped now
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>
- The eighth episode (5 December) airs with a runtime of ~1 hour.
<:CagliostroPout:672861874471174166>
those 17 other episodes better be absolute bangers
The closest thing I can think of is an anime that has ||an intersex person|| but that's also not revealed until super late into the show.
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I don't really know if Kampfer counts. He wouldn't do it if he had a choice
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
Japan doesn't really do that lyra
same dud
||wait lena knows? did i miss that?||
||but now i wish more people survived till that mission. especially fido||
||ive never been happier than the halfwaypoint of this show||
noooo i just got into the aniem too
i mean they are dud
i wonder how many will be worth keeping up with lol
thanks iski
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
roughly 34 new animes to try this coming season.
honestly im glad theyre making nendos and figmas. things i have no interest in buying. otherwise id be fucked for hololive merch
holy shit i need that marine
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<@!152896851660505088> <@!213645184125239317> ||im super confused at the ending of the first half now with the headless reaper. and the new machine alluding to a new baddy to deal with||
they would go in the shred bin anyways
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
u sure those arent her complaints books?
im glad lena is on friendly terms with her professor buddy again
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
||fuck 86 for making me love a char and killing them in the same episode||
<:CarolBullying:816901978432733194>
||i really REALLY hope that one day they find fido and bring him back to get fixed||
||with fido watching anju breaking down||
bruh that scene
<:asagicry:851512192133890099>
||i miss daiya and all the rest||
<:descoapproves:853012832610549790>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
i wonder what made lena dye her hair
fair
like they do realize 86 isnt infinite right? like if they all die. who will fight
u know what i meant
lol u butt
i wish i could see a map of these countries
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
||oh u made it sound like she knew they survived to the new nation||
<:umudeal:852752649614393384>
U mean. Had a train wreck
<:CarolBullying:816901978432733194>
3d chars talking to 2d chars
we got another Ex-arm on our hands
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
oh no
just stated tesla note
maybe its to help break the constant tension of the horror scenes?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
fanservice
<:CarolBullying:816901978432733194>
||are they seriously pulling the in the same town but always missing each other shit for roxy and rudeus||
thats what im waiting for
<:CarolBullying:816901978432733194>
the site i use hasnt uploaded it yet
<:pekosmug:775313544908505128>
Was good
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
Honestly I forget there's another MC outside of electric girl
Getting down to the wire. Ts now
*chefs kiss*
Like that black and white fight
It should've been awful but ended up being hilarious, having good chsr development. And surprisingly good looking fight scenes
Oh misfit at demon academy? I gave that a 9
I have no idea what that even is
Slowly trucking along
I'm on S now
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
im usually too lazy but now im doing it
u dingus
when u posted your anilist and wanted to roast your scores
<@87512939107450880> I will need u to roast me when it's all done like when u did yours
Taking a break from anime and now scoring all my unscored animes. Which is taking much longer than I realized
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
Year of the vampire huh
I just realized we have 2 vampire shows this season. And had vanitas right before it and Mars red.
im down
my body is ready
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
https://anilist.co/user/AyamineKei/animelist <@!87512939107450880> <@!152896851660505088> <@!171395487247630336>
okay cypher im donezo for now
they sense it
newtypes dont need to SEE their targets
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
stahp
Don't bring that trash into this
<:WhatTheTom:741816166237995038>
Since we saw her in pt 1
~~well new to the MC~~
Is little witch academia a manga adaptation? I think that might be the only non original anime from trugger
Pretty much
Cowboy bebop
Gurren laggan and kill la kill are as well
Code geass, gundam, Valvrave. Also majestic prince and akudama drive
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Pretty much every mecha show from sunrise
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
Original only animes ftw!
I do enjoy cheese
Wooo
It's ex arm with good fight scenes
<:pekosmug:775313544908505128>
We could just say all the trigger animes then
Dynazenon was awesome and original too
Nvm then
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
Season 2 hype! Let's goooo
https://animesenpai.net/new-japanese-pm-is-demon-slayer-fan-promises-to-boost-income-of-anime-industry/
Man that was ripping off digimon. The digital rings are 100% the same lol
best transformation
im sure he does. but in a comedy where im sure the MC is gonna be yelling a lot. i really dont need anymore of that in my life
i think im gonna have to drop this right away
oh god. gorilla isekai MC is zenitsu
so i tried the comedy vampire anime... and i couldnt get thru the entire episode. im just gonna stick to space vampire
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
How could u forget busty nurse who's also crazy af
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Not the first time a company made a mistake
If people wanna be wrong. I'm not gonna stop them lol
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I already do for other shows that made the sake mistake
Or rezero
Same with slime not being called season 2 and 3
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I don't conform to the dumbness of calling a split cour 24 episode show as 2 seasons. Mushoku tensei isn't called season 2 and irs also a split cour 24 episode show
<:snekwoah:854100552773533757>
School idol on the rocks
God that legit looks like love live
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
What's next. My tax auditer can't be this cute!
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Card captor Sakura best magical girl show
Beelzebub is like the only candidate for a lover for MC imo
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
Such a wholesome show about making a family instead of a harem
I loved that anime
<:snekwoah:854100552773533757>
Inb4 they're straight and get bfs
Steins gate is usually my go to example of a good vn adapation
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
I'm personally not a fan of higurashi. But if u like it. More power to ya
Plus multiple routes
Because shoving 40+ hours into a 12 episode show tends to be not a good idea
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Sooooo much better
The ps3 art is perfect tho
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Sure it is. U never heard of the choke hold?
Poor bastards
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
Same with dub
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
I remember the dubbers asking if they could do fun shit with each episode cause it was boring after the third one but were denied
I have no clue how that didn't kill the series
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Imagine watching that week to week
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Almost as risky as the endless 8 in haruhi
Yea my bro isn't a fan of being in the dark for super long so after the third time of no explanations he was done lol
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I think I should've just left it as a happy(?) Memory
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
We finished the third question arc and never continued
I tried to rewatch higurashi with my bro and man.. I forgot how rough s1 is.
Anime ended at s2 for me. I never watched past that
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Everyone upset
Pachinko style is too edgy
I got u
Ps3 is better. It's like updated but still has the old style
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
Well played fafner. Well played
I remember when fafner s1 did a double fake out. ||when that one guy who was a dad was totally gonna die to boss in a tragic sacrifice. But then he activates his escape pod and you're like oh he's good. And then he happened to have the only robot that ejects forward and the enemy grabs his cockpit and just obliterates it.||
They had names? I recognized Komaki and that was it
I wonder if animes will ever make writing to show who's not obviously gonna die
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
Muv luv episode confused me
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
What?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Right
It's split into quarters
<:pekosmug:775313544908505128>
What if the 12 eps were just following our busty glasses beauty
Gives me a reason to chat with millhi
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Because I like being the opposite of millhi
It's good
What if
<:prinnythink:851513073122017341>
But millhi you aren't thinking about one option
Sounds like an isekai to me
Dude wakes up in a different japan where aliens appear
<:snekwoah:854100552773533757>
I mean from an anime only it will be
<:pekosmug:775313544908505128>
It's an isekai.  It's FINE
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
You don't NEED them
<:snekwoah:854100552773533757>
50?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Should've started with the alternative chronicles instead
It's to entice the newbs
The show made an improvement with that
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
There was like one named death in total eclipse and it was the ||cow girl with the grossly oversized breasts||
Yes a love triangle. That's what I want in my alien invasion killing all of earth scenario
I personally think total eclipse is awful
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
I started watching this anime where pretty girls just started blasting people to death. I think this is the assassin isekai
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Say what
I should really watch the other seasons
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
Well played millhi
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@152896851660505088> u know what I'm referring to? Or just nodding to nod
Rip
Night
<:pepesnuggle:648972696436080641>
Oh okay
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Damn I started shin no nakama. And this dude is a huge dick to the MC
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
Better than having it and it being broken
<:pepesnuggle:648972696436080641>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721> <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Full armored gundams?
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
I hated it so much
I legit stopped midway on my raptor
Good choice
Good luck
Kotobukiya plastic is so poor and the color separation is bad. At least for this line. Their zoids are pretty top tier
They are. If only Bandai made them
Yes u are. Muv luv mechs have been the least enjoyable builds I've ever done in my career of building
This is a weird af casting
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Chizuru is miku from quintuplwts...
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Marimo I only recognize her short role in misfit demon academy. I liked her there so she might be good if she ups her Ara Ara aura
Why
<:asagicringe:851512873985507378>
Ayamine is vanilla from nekopara
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
I dunno how I feel about that
Sumika va is discount asuna/deca dence girl...
Marimo best teacher in anime
I don't wanna live anymore
<:pepesnuggle:648972696436080641>
She's what my Aya is derived from
At least keep Yuko for ayamine
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
She's so fucking good
Bruh how has meiya only basically been that char
Wha
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
Meiya isn't meiya without her og VA
WHY
WHAT
Nah that's me just knowing that I tend to shy away from CGDCT animes
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I'm not counting returning shows for obv reasons
<:TB:441562395245281281>
I still haven't watched idols on ice but I doubt that'll creep into top 5
Space vampire
Mieruko
Takt
Kyoukai senki
Digimon
Is my order atm. I don't feel anything else has really stood out from their ep 1. Which sometimes it does take a couple episodes to get started so this list could easily change
So far
Still better than a majority of what's been shown so far. This mieruko chan and space vampire are the shows I'm most interested
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<@213645184125239317> what
Takt.op destiny was really good. Def in my top 3 most anticipated new shows so far this season
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
so i always like to see how an anime is received on reddit for its first episode. and the vampire comedy. i think i watyched a different show cause everyone thought it was funny af
yes u do
when i hear shounen i htink of shows like naruto or My hero. so thats why my brain doesnt think of this as one
whelp onto blue period
i think thats the word im looking for
it was already viseral
neat. i enjoyed the dark setting. i looked forward to the fucked up scenarios in this
this is shounen? no way. its way too dark.
i just try everything without knowing anything about them
So Platinum End and Sakugan have taken my top 2 spots now
sorry i @d u when i meant iski
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
im just starting sakugan myself
<@!237964037898502144> platinum end has shot to the top spot of anticipated. kicking tact out of my top 3
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
||wow that angel sure has some booty||
*starts platnium end*
ill stop  bothering u
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
because we have been discussing our top 5 or more
<:descoapproves:853012832610549790>
<@!213645184125239317> blue period was also good
i liked that it felt like a disney film for the first two episodes. but man i really wasnt gripped by it at all somehow
good old symphogear
no ash
i cant remember the last time an anime made be audibly go OH FUCK
yea that really caught me off guard
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
imagine doing research before watch8ing the show
Love that anime
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Bookworm one of the best isekais out there
It's a shitty situation no matter the outcome
Still not a good thing but at least he's not doing it maliciously
I mean ||he thinks they're gonna die if he doesn't. Which a couple have||
Like holy shit
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
But man when the witch came onto the scene. Did that manga change
Up to that point he was a mostly good person
I haven't read since u know who woke up
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
He doesn't always succeed
I said tries
I'd argue redo is worse. At least the mc is a good person and tries to do good things
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
I really enjoyed parallel paradise. Until I didnt
<@87512939107450880>
Why did u stop mjp
I tried ryvius and the first episode was super boring so I stopped
Made me laugh
Also I liked the beginning where they turn their mechs into Nascar with all the sponsors tags
It has such good fight choreography
<:HuTaoAYAYAY:806234426572668949>
I'm so happy u liked it
What's your thoughts on majestic prince?
Fucking hell
No it didn't. The entirety of that thing existence can burn in a trash can
ah the weirdos
whats netorase
<a:kleeMad:838482900487372870>
but they dont
i'd look up netori if H sites would actually split that off from normal NTR
better by a lot
idolmaster?
whats imas
i did see a NTR where that happened. ugly bastard tried to take the girl. and then the guy used his ~~literal~~ big D energy to take her back and leave the UB high and dry
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
unless she herself is taken from him. by an ugly bastard
Blonde dude
Why do people like this
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>

Oh lol
I need a name
I wouldnt be shocked if redo NTRd someone
that was a cute anime miso. ill enjoy it until i get bored of the formula
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
so far away paladin was really good. im really excited to see where this anime goes. its like Mushoku Tensei minus the lewd.
big rip
that sounds cool... oh it got seperated
what da fu
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
theres live action parts of mug?
we got the whole spectrum here
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i never started
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
hi miso
actually if we joined border im sure the senior member we train under would actually motivate me to get into shape. so i could see myself maybe getting a low B rank lol
<:knucklespeepers:553093971090472980>
unless we hit the lottery and get chika lvl trion, i doubt we would ever pass C
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
we would suck like glasses dude
i want my trashfire
<a:kleeMad:838482900487372870>
i wanna know why WEH hasnt been subbed yet
ive got no clue
yea i dunno about that one either. it was a prescreening maybe and hasnt actually released?
and ill have watched everything
all thats left to watch is komi san, world end harem, Demon slayer, the lost child, and rumble karanndoll
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
only missing 5 shows cause i dropped or mever wanted to touch them so far
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
<@!279341087494242304>
man nothing feels better than watching another season of a show u like. getting back into world trigger feels great
megaton was weird. but i didnt hate it
and now i finish the day with world trigger
i enjoyed it quite a bit
taishou was the one show that got an audible laugh from me for a random off gag
Taishou Otome Otogibanashi was a pretty cute show. probably the cutest thing im enjoying this season
its one episode felt like a fucking hour tho
no its a full series
its quite easy to for me. i dropped hockey idols halfway
SNK is a game company
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
AoT S4*
im not gonna continue the conversation then cause im just gonna get unnecessarily angry
fantastic show. easy recommend
so youd call Jujutsu kaisen mediocrity?
<:asagicringe:851512873985507378>
to circle back to the original topic
but yea mappa is becoming goated with all the bangers they been shelling out
inb4 lanks adopts and never has a kid
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
comedy is the one category i dont usually debate when it comes to any form of entertainment
simple as that
if ya didnt like it, ya didint like it
i mean im not gonna throw lanks onto the coals cause comedy is hyper subjective. especially from different cultures and countries
tho the show did have a lot of surprising char development moments for a comedy
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
well i never stopped. so yes i think its good
his va is top tier
you arent supposed to take it seriously
i mean its slapstick humor.
cause it is a comedy
rip lanks not able to watch the best idol show
well i mean every studio doesnt have hit after hit. theyre gonna get misses thanks to the revolving door of directors and what not
JJK, god of highschool, idaten, inuyashiki, dororo, banana fish. they do animes really well. especially fight scenes
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
mappa is great what u talking about
say wut
but i could see how it doesnt appeal to some people
it hasnt done anything to make me want to drop it atm. good art, pretty fights, decent comedic timing. also the suffering of the older sister is great
theyre just not good this season
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
my personal opinions of the shows so far
The Good stuff
Sakugan
Digimon
Takt.op destiny
Astro Vampire
Faraway Paladin
Blue period
Platinum end
Taisho Fairy Tale

Could be Good Stuff
Kyouku Senki
Assassin isekai
slow life isekai
Megaton

Gonna Drop at ep 3 unless surprise quality happens
Tesla Note
Build divide
Muvluv
Gorilla Isekai
My Senpai is annoying
Selection project 

Dropped Already
Muteking, Vampire Comedy, Hockey idols <@!87512939107450880> <@!279341087494242304> <@!171395487247630336>
oh thank u melua
the more u know
huh i didnt know mappa was founded by the founder of madhouse
<:ChrisPresents:672578363176517642>
drop a nuke on the island. problem solved
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
garter belts sure are nice
too soon niko
86 has Lena, AoT does not.
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
86 is the superior AoT
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
thats a thing? first i heard of 86 compared to AoT
~~whats in the basement guys~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
its like FF7. ive only ever played the demo disc but i know the whole plot
im glad WIT can work on other stuff not AoT now
i have no idea. i dropped the show after S1
banned
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
yall been talking end game AoT outside of nonsymphogear spoilers
i have no clue at this point lol
is that a spoiler
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
titans are just ||flesh robots piloted by poeople||
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i also dont like evangelion but i love mecha
AoT fans are just mecha fans in denial
heres hoping
all depends on if it gets more seasons
lost some sleep but it was worth it
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
like i watched squids game and i ended up watching the whole thing in two days
vol 8 sounds very far into the future
for older stuff
i usually just watch the first episode of anything that interests me and then i either binge it or drop it lol
thats a fair thing to do
i deleted my back logs of anime and games for the most part. cause i know realistically ill probably never bother with them if i havent already played them. so why bother lying to myself.
so its pretty easy to keep up to date
most of the time the animes come out in 1-3 episode chunks a day outside of the weekend.
well i mean my options for those 3 hours is anime or games. and i havent realy been super interested in gaming of late. so its pretty easy to cram an hour or 2 of anime a day if i really wanted to.
god i  misse the days of no working 12 hour days
thats fair
on weekdays i have on average... maybe 3 hours of free time?
i dont have anywhere close to that amount of free time a day
that sounds horrid ngl lol
<:descoapproves:853012832610549790>
only 2 off
i just noticed me and lanks have completed almost the same amount of shows to a tee lol
would rewatching something be more of a waste of time when you have 300+ shows you havent watched yet
im responding to lanks
with the quality of anime youre bound to get some stinkers or average shows in that 300
i highly doubt that
just delete things off your to watch list then. problem solved
if u cant. u cant
i mean its only an hour but eh
<@!213645184125239317> i wont hype it up for you. i do think its worth trying and forming your own opinion on it. if u dont enjoy it by the 3 episode rule id just drop it then.
its an all around great show imo
amazing action scenes, great comedic moments. very kick your heart feels. good character writing and development. able to juggle a large cast of side characters.
i would highly disagree its average. as someone who had no clue what i was walking into for JJK
its my main hobby so its pretty easy to do.
eh you just gotta make the time for it
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
go into stuff blind
this is why i try to watch seasonals at launch. dont gotta worry about that
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
i mean just cause u dont like the genre doesnt mean the show isnt good. i dont like evangelion for example but i dont deny the movies are fucking good
~~i still cant get over the fact lanks thinks JJK is mediocre~~
hit the 5 second skip button a lot
i did do that for a lot of animes today
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
im only 5 eps into Vivy
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
VIVY
we should all watch what WIT got to do no longer chained to AoT
i can
stop bulli me iski
<:CarolBullying:816901978432733194>
which is sorta true from Lena's perspective atm
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
also honestly all the female designs were pretty unique so i had no clue who was gonna survive ||honestly i thought the whole crew was gonna die and this was the Lena show and her next crew was gonna be different after dealing with the first one||
<:asagicry:851512192133890099>
shut up
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
2nd death was more memorable
i forgot ||tan dude died first||
not first
oh wait
<:asagicry:851512192133890099>
the first and last deaths were the ones i remebmer best and the suicide one
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
he doesnt really do much so not surprising
<:asagicry:851512192133890099>
so i argue ||fido was the saddest||
yea but if not for ||fidos death|| youd never see the best part of ||daiyas death||
also i dont think the other person u named was that significant. he made a poor choice. i was more sad for ||the girl|| than the death itself
so the ending hit me like a truck
i didnt know anything was coming
we arent in the spoiler channel
delete
iski thats massive spoilers
<@!213645184125239317> <@!161155855524298752> must know your opinions
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
am i the only one who thought ||Fido's death was the saddest of season 1?||
also
an anime
i swear im the only person who didnt like that show
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
erased...
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
im more interested in watching ||the silver haired girl than shin in his group of 5||
he is? Lena seems like the protag to me at this current time in the anime
i dont watch ops of animes until the show is half over at minimum
the thing i dislike is ||a lot of the group gets killed offscreen so its hard to keep track of whos alive and dead||
and now downloading space vampire for the last anime i need to watch today
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
nice to see as OP as the MC is getting he can still get ||bodied||
in need a week coma for next Mushoku tensei
god tesla note hurts my eyes
i do think its funny theres a brown haired girl who looks just like the tesla note MC
<:CarolBullying:816901978432733194>
do i want to see thru another episode of tesla note
It's another tesla note but with good 3d
<:yuuki1:647988654345551922>
Its... something alright. I enjoyed it tho
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
Mushoku tensei, demon slayer, Mieruko, space vampire. And I count digimon and shikizakura as a Sunday since I'm sleep by the time they release on Saturday night
Sunday is such a good day for anime
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
Have fun
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
Which confuses me
Also ||the make flat jokes about her but that stethoscope scene shows she had pretty decent sized ones herself.||
I'd be cool with that
Mieruko is pure suffering. Poor girl
<:yuuki1:647988654345551922>
At least a majority of them were her friend this time
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
Anime really needs more of it
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
make sure to watch the after credits scene
god mieruko is so unsettling. its exhausted after one ep
<:descoapproves:853012832610549790>
well u know what they say. one mans trash is another mans treasure
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
best trash can u mean
strange how we have 2 of these this season
shikizakura  is another 3D anime. but they do a MUCH better job at blending it with a 2D enviroment.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
also the spider bots are cool
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
theyre supposed to be hated tho. thats the point of their char
also kabaneri is a very specific case.
||im scared its gonna turn for the worse at some point and make me cry||
FG stands for?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
then watch it
<:CagliostroPout:672861874471174166>
put fena in digimon
<:ChrisPresents:672578363176517642>
fena in digimon
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
digimon?
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
<@!213645184125239317> shit i didnt realize i was a vampire. milk is my main drink
im impressed
DAMN i was not expecting blue period to cover such a heavy topic
<:asagicry:851512192133890099>
blue period ep 2
<:ChrisPresents:672578363176517642>
||the dog||
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
It ignoring game mechanics for plot doesn't bother u?
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
If u wanna get pissed at stuff like that. Sao is an easy choice. Since it also wants to be serious
Bofuri is great comedy
Maple Is the best
I only recognize Angela Balzac. The rest are phonies
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
So.... good?
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Domestic... girlfriend?
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
And clowns saved the day
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
Only kiritos harem allowed to live
She went full stupid
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Like why
She was such a pointless loss
Bad writing
Terminal illness
<:snekwoah:854100552773533757>
If u don't wanna bang kirito. You're on the chopping  block to die
<:umudeal:852752649614393384>
Nah suffer niko
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
I know but I can dream
Make them Canon please
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
Philia and strea best girls and they're game only girls
Yea that one
The actual game
Something bullet
I liked that game with the guns
It's a cute girl basically failing upwards into being op and adorable at the same time.
That's why I asked.
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
Well I mean more. Serious was bother by how nonsensical a comedy was with bofuri but not the plot holes of sao
Gimme space guts
Idgaf about biscuit
<:aqua_why:795834295146119210>
But he could save all the deaths
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Imagine if anos dropped into iron blooded orphans
<:pokeblush:526120735132090372>
I want that
What if a company like say katokawa made an anime where one protagonist isekaid into another property they owned
Maybe after that
Well first we have world end harem
~~Ntr isekai anime adaptation when~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Yea I'd be friends with zoidberg
I wanna get isekai'd into the year 3000
<:aqua_why:795834295146119210>
Why dont sci-fi shows exist more
Cypher I need pixs
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
The what
<:pepewaifuknight:642147377574182933>
I see prices on them. Where are u. I'm ready to shell out
What am I looking at here
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
What a waste of the gender bend then
<:pekosmug:775313544908505128>
Is there a lot of yuri
<:snekwoah:854100552773533757>
So it's like kirito in ggo
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
Turning dudes into cute grills or busty babies. Is a yes. Doing the reverse, is a no
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Depends on which way the genderbend goes
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
It also lacks a Turtle named syrup
Hang on let me google
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
What's OSO
i never watched that, i was told its worse oreimo so i hard passed
its more morbid curiosity to see where this stupid goes
its seriously so bad.  i dunno how far i can see myself watching gorilla isekai but ill do my best
i wish realist hero was better
<a:hyperu:857284643891052564>
time for not gundam!
sorry all i got is Giant icicles to bonk horny
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
she can conjure a storm like gandalf
demon wizard
she went full 6some
elf lady is epitome horny tho
deal
<:snekwoah:854100552773533757>
A simple feat
Remember when anos ||fused them with alternate past time line versions of each other to make themselves whole?||
<:pekosmug:775313544908505128>
Can't wait for him to make one big family ||with his two wife's that are also sisters||
||isn't it three now with the human girl? Or is that not counted yet.||
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
||his fan club was fantastic and they even got their own time to shine which was great||
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's kinda like one punch man if everyone knew how strong Saitama was. ||but still some dumbasses won't believe||
<:umudeal:852752649614393384>
He's got old man swagger too
Anos is pretty chill and happy with his life
Welcome to the party
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Yes. I gushed about it when that happened on the week it released
How does that work
Wha
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<a:kleeMad:838482900487372870>
Gimme my epic final mecha fight
But we never got ginger bishounen vs emperor!
That's so stupid! So star driver never finished
<:snekwoah:854100552773533757>
I still find it funny when girls were claiming to be ginga bishounens tho
I agree. It's only in the back half when the enemy robots get upgraded does he actually get knocked back some.
While it does have some downsides. I'd say overall yes
My main issue with stardriver was the lack of a real conclusion
Did the movie conclude the show?
I honestly can't think of a better insert song personally
It's so fucking good
Monochrome still gives me chills to this day
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ITS A PINCH
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
So darling in the franxx?
I forgot to watch that one
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Is that the chibi mecha one?
They're such a rarity in animes
Also mad props for anos fanclub to include a thick girl
I'm hyped
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:yuuki1:647988654345551922>
Oh yeah they did do that didn't they
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
What's the .5
Also I'm really glad not EVERY girl falls for anos. ||like spirit girl falling for other dude who's name escapes me atm||
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
Idc what anyone says. Misfit was the best anime of 2020
Pretty much
Digimon also continues to be good
<@279341087494242304> <@87512939107450880> someone pointed out to me MC name is one letter away from Amuro. I didn't even catch that lol
That's fair. I don't look deep into entertainment to see the similies. I just enjoy the entertainment as entertainment
I guess it depends on how it's tackled. If it's white people bait and poorly written sure it's bad. But if it's actually well written and what not. I don't see an issue personally.
I mean if a poc wants to write a story like that. That's their choice.
I have no idea what you're even on about. Have fun with that. Going back to work
It's a fictional story with giant robots.
Could an American not write a story about slavery?
I mean what does that have to do with the individual themself?
No shocker a teen would feel like he has no future
I mean japan is basically owned by multiple other countries and it's citizens are treated like second class.
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I mean it's a sunrise mecha. National Politics is gonna be a thing
It's in my could be great category for this seasonal list
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
U haven't missed anything yet. But it Def has potential
Eva unit 01 is one of the most iconic mechas
The mecha designs are cool at least
I mean I don't like eva either so u won't hear my complaining u don't lol
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
I want an example of my unculturedness
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Usually I acknowledge the animes I know are good but I just don't like. Like the eva movies
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Also when have I been uncultured
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Nah the hero does a good job. The show just is really low budget
This could've been another slime.  But sadly it was too generic
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Nah. I know my isekais
It's all downhill from there
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
Sadly that's the most hype the show gets
Torrent sounds like the best option
Tho atm it's only one girl
Yes
A lot
<:snekwoah:854100552773533757>
They also fuck
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
The minotaur. I remember the story of a man making a deal with a God. And then not holding up his side of the bargain.  God got mad and made his wife fall in love with a bull. Then they made a minotaur
episode 2 takt.op destiny was also quite good and very different than the first one. Cossette was incredibly adorable. like a completely different version from ep 1 until ||the bad stuff happened||
also totally not an isekai but really should be was also cute. the addition of Rit elevated it
<@!87512939107450880> assassin isekai was good. enjoyed the step back for this episode
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Weds sure are interesting. Ass isekai. The basically isekai. Idol hockey. Mech dumpster
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
Not even the op?
<:snekwoah:854100552773533757>
I prefer no punch man. Anos
Don't ever get used to them. That's heresy
Best part of the show. It peaked Hella early
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I only watched one episode and remembered she could use magic.
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
No. Pls tell me
I think I saw the first ep of her show
She's a witch right?
Wait
I dunno any of these girls but I like the silver haired one
You had me in the first half ngl
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
Happens all the time sadly
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
But star wars cartoons are fine?
I forgot about that cartoon. Meant to watch it. Unfortunate it's canned. Isn't 2nd season not even done yet?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Is that from the latest episode?
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
its also really good at making u cry
cant wait for some animes 20-30 years from now and still looking worse than violet
probably dbz, or sailormoon or pokemon
a singer i listen to just did a sick cover of that last week
same ardania
glad tahts over with
god the era of highschool sol
different era
clannad is 2007 so its a very different beast vs a 2013 kind of anime
oh wow 2013. thats actually getting up there in age
is og lovelive that old?
whats sip
OG is nightmare fuel
at least the remake of kanon is watchable
yes
~~i noly got like 8-10 episodes into first season before dropping it~~
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
VE is better yes nina
its also the shortest tho
definitely the weakest of the trio
air is... decent
its so good mang
also Kanon best Key anime
go big or go home
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
why only semi. go full auto
~~clannad puts me to sleep~~
Haven't they only sung like the same song for two episodes? Lol
One
Get
Go

I got 4 shows on the 3 episode chopping block atm after their ep 2
I should take the effort to add all the non tv shows to my list
<:pepesnuggle:648972696436080641>
Imagine having friends to game with
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Well stop it
Why do u stop midway and not finish?
Or help me not miss shows that haven't released yet in the current season
<:yuuki1:647988654345551922>
My watch list are just shows coming out the next season usually
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Wut this
And have no other hobbies
Just gotta make that effort
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
I mean I work 60 hours and still have time to
I try close to every anime every season . Adds up quick
Hi millhi
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

There's Def a surprising amount of... watchable shows this season
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
1 vs 100
Damn that's wild
A fourth or a fifth of all my anime I've every tried is in my dropped category lol
(To me)
Oh I drop everything that loses my interest. Not enough time to pursue boring shows
Episode 3 chopping block is fierce and  shows no mercy
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I'll check it out but it'll probably be the last episode I give it
Been at work
I havent watched the third episode lol
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I assume it's there to make it easier for him to learn things and apply himself
Yes ||we got fido back. Are you not happy?||
i really needed that
<:asagicry:851512192133890099>
latest episode of 86 made me the happiest
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Debatable
yes
if i never saw 7ds i probably would be fine. but its like the one voice i cant disconnect from the role i first saw them in
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
she sounds like a pig to me
nah i kinda hate the VA
i really wish i could like this character but her voice being hawk. just ruins her for me
<:CarolBullying:816901978432733194>
i cant accept that
i refuse! ||that hardest hitting death of fido is impossible to be the worst episode||
theres no issue with the episode in my eyes
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
i mean if u didnt read the LN. does that matter to u at all?
thats easily one of the best episodes
you monster cypher
looking back. it was
wasnt the second to last ||fidos death episode? or was that the one right before it||
i agree with millhi
if only all animes got that treament
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
10/10
||THEY  BROUGHT BACK FIDO||
u mean the best episode
||i thought i was watching 86 with that scene cut||
<:CarolBullying:816901978432733194>
BROOO wtf mushoku tensei. u can just do that
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<#337805317276565525>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
im sorry a what
She has also contributed her voice to various merchandise such as Mugen Puchipuchi Moe, a virtual keychain bubble-wrap popping game.
when shes not forced to do a loli voice
i enjoyed rie in world trigger as a more older person
shes playted a lot of them
if its a loli in anime its a good chance its now hawk lol
<:CarolBullying:816901978432733194>
she's kinda becoming rie kugimiya 2.0 for me
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
i said that earlier millhi
<:pekosmug:775313544908505128>

on this week of anime. gorilla isekai shockingly didnt get cut at ep 3. was legit saved by the introduction of a calamity
another good episode of mieruko. zero fanservice too
Vs her vn self
Tama looks old
Ayamine at least looks decent
We must collect the dragon balls to bring him back
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
From far away i thought that was air gear in the background
Yo dog ||she bleed from.her eyes!|| fucking hilarious!
Imagine turning made in abyss into a comedy
I guess I'm lucky my small group of friends doesn't have that issue
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Need better bois
Or comedy
Also I feel like the energy of another person or two can help escalate the hype or emotional moment in an anime for me
Anime > books. When it comes to a group activity
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
That just sounds tedious.
That's nowhere near as enjoyable as an anime. Especially with diff reading paces. U can't really talk episode to episode with a book. Unless u stop every chapter.
I personally watch anime with another person usually. Which u can't do with books
Gonna take a couple week vacation and then look for a new job
Next week is my last week anyways
<:yuuki1:647988654345551922>
Because my job tells me to.
It's pretty easy honestly.
It was 21. Buy three shows got chopped ywsterday
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I mean I'm watching 18 shows right now and I work 60 hours
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Shorts and ovas can really inflate numbers
<:pekosmug:775313544908505128>
I was fast and swift with my decisions
Maybe 2.
I did one day. Took like an hour lol
My pool of 10/10 is so low. If I have a single gripe. No matter how small. It can only be as high as a 9.5 for me
<:snekwoah:854100552773533757>
I mean ixki posted them cause he knew that he would get a reaction
This is wild tho
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
They hate the anime. Not the manga
I don't. Some bad shows are rated too high. Like Yu-No. Is 6.57 which is only 
.02 away from killing bites. And that bothers me a lot. It should be way lower. One of the worst animes ever made
When he's in pure teaching mode he's great
Tho hus comedy is pretty bad
I think he's better than documentaries at times
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
I'm really glad they had Chris early on. I got super into his content and is one of my favorite youtubers now. Really enjoy all the japan locales and learning stuff
Samr
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Who
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Who
Also I like how Chris broad is like the unofficial 4th member of the bois
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
U mean Gigg UK. The manga boy and the monkey
The song got me good
<:snekwoah:854100552773533757>

Made me laugh

Oh I know. I've watched more than enough. I was just thinking it's a trash taste ad
If only we could fix anime that easily
<:snekwoah:854100552773533757>
Or ruin it completely
Trash taste
Lol I also thought of book walker ad
Big mistake
(I was still on the high of a different comedy anime and wanted more comedy)
I will say I found konosuba mostly unfunny my first watch but a month later when I rewatched it with my bro. I enjoyed it
<:aqua_why:795834295146119210>
10/10 but it hurts so much to remember
God fuck that movie
<:pepesnuggle:648972696436080641>
Dam bro! ||he made a waifu u can carry around like a briefcase|| fucking genius bro!
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
I've dropped a lot of animes already but still watching 18
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Dropped it ep 3
<:aqua_why:795834295146119210>
Muv luv alternative has made me cry both in vn and anime form. But for different reasons
~~A knife can wreck your heart irl~~
<:snekwoah:854100552773533757>
It's cause I have zero interesr
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Better than my negative 9
Literally the name
Oh lmao
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Which anime?
I also need to watch VE movie
New va for movie
Mc of princess principle. Retired cause of health reasons
<:aqua_why:795834295146119210>
I know the movie is good but I know I'm gonna miss ange
I consume so much anime already. I don't got the motivation to watch stuff I've skipped
Lol
That is sure a name
No
I actually liked that one outside of the last 4 episodes
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Setsuna F Seiei
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Aoelia having a no u button ||for his death|| was pretty great
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Second half needs to drop on Netflix already
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
ive been told if we get anymore of that it changes in tone very wildly
whats gems
<:descoapproves:853012832610549790>
now we just need a MLA s2 announcement
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Don't people like that show?
Which one
What is this bizarro world I live in
<:aqua_why:795834295146119210>
Wait. Studio Deen did rave master?
Konosuba is like their one saving grace
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
They usually do for any show they're fully in charge of
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
7 deadly sins
They had one outsourced episode and it really looked not as good
I think the one time I really noticed was mushoku tensei.
True. It's very rare when I do actually catch an outsourced episode and think.. something feels off
<:aqua_why:795834295146119210>
I just feel despair whenever I see Deen thanks to a s3 of a certain show
<:pekosmug:775313544908505128>
So doing the whole episode
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
DEEN? Do they want the show to bomb?
but do they have forheads
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
u ever watch an anime and it cold opens with a new or side char and then check if u downloaded the wrong anime?
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
i have very bad memory when it comes to text convos
who
<:HmmmWorry:740995049398992907>
or was that ruby who liked them
but the MC is a blonde Forhead girl
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
am i the only one who is super uninterested in Sakugan? i see the quality there. but i just cant care about the plot of it
Why did yuasa quit
Dafuq
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>

The fuck is that second one
What's my prize
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Holy shit got it in one
Mappa? Lol
?
Is a big studio
Hmm
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Anime was a mistake
So gifs the anime
Oh that's weird
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
sonny boy was so boring. i barely made it past one episode
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
discluding a place further than the universe since i never watched that.  last good show they made was what. one punch man in 2015
madhouse be having a lot of misses in the past decade
i feel like everything else will just pale in comparison to kaiji
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
also yugioh
yea its a really unique looking class. lots of effort to draw all those unique hairstyles and outfits i bet
basically in the manga, chars got added to the class as they became relevant in the manga. before that point theyre just faceless/generic students. in the anime. they added ALL the manga chars to the class scenes, even tho a majority of them will never have a single line in the anime cause their introductions are way later
reminds me of hitorri bochi where they went and animated all the characters from the mangas future chapters as just background chars in the class even tho they didnt exist in the beginning
thats why
to really get ya
every episode at least once
did not see that coming
yes
<:asagicry:851512192133890099>
mieruko really kicked me in the feels ep 4. surprised me
actually now that i think about it. its kinda annoying to talk about part 2 of 86 cause it spoils part 1. for the peeps who havent started it yet
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
spoilers
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
u mean depression
just like how i tell myself GE3 doesnt exist
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
i forgot that even existed
honestly it reminds me of the uma musume mobile game
but it doesnt look out of place 3d
is shaded to look like a 2d anime pretty well.
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
the only good 3d anime this season
shikizakura
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
this is episode 3
its for ruby
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
danmachi s2 is DEFINITELY worse than s1 by a long shot
<:CarolBullying:816901978432733194>
i guess its the lack of s2s for a good portion of shows
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
usually its the same studio but not the same staff on the anime
its not often animes change studios.
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
the production committee wanted a s2 right now and madhouse was unavailable so they swapped to a new studio
its really simple actually
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
i personally enjoyed the lizard arc. but ive been told by a lot of people it was bad
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
cat died in an anime. why do u gotta kill the animals
i dunno if its just me being more into anime now. but man are we getting a lot of good animes having really shit sequel seasons. opm s2, sds s3+, overlord s3, promised neverland s2
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
everything is on twitter
but u prob right and its only the west
i feel like most japanese dont voice negative opinions unless its like egregiously unfaithful to the source or something
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
youre a western thing
i wonder how they feel that it wasnt well received after coming back together
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i just assumed a new studio did clear card since nobody liked it
the fuck
wait what. madhouse did OG cardcaptors?
yea looking at their catalog. its like, half good shit. half bad
madhouse was pretty goated years ago. parasyte, og overlord, NGNL, the ambition of nobuna oda etc
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
i was gonna say nothing good has come out the past 2 years but then u mentioned finishing idols and that ruins the joke cause we all know idols is bottom tier
but not good enough to finish
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
then u didnt enjoy chihaya s3
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
if u enjoyed it youd have finished it
my brain lumped chihaya into 2011 with the og season. forgot it took forever to get a s3 lol
thats more than ill ever give it
yea i didnt liek that one out the gate lol
thats the SD robot one right?
wasnt granbelm kinda butt? or am i  thinking of the wrong anime
thats a third of the show wow
i didnt see this so... *shrug*
whats nexus
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
because emilia is awful
s2 was kinda eh
im fine with that
it does
cause it does cypher
i do enjoy some bait
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
*looks at the studio made JUST to make mushoku tensei anime*
wasnt there a really dope fight scene in prisma ilya thanks to a freelancer
this is such a weird work space
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
bring out the good fights
freaking cypher
oh i didnt knwo that actually for the movie lkol
isnt konosuba deen and not jc staff
when did food wars become a disaster? i watched every season but the last one and that was fine
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
with how bad almost every fight scene outside of one was in s2. id called it a disaster
oh just remembered. i need to get my anime list of things that survived the ep3 purge
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
if only every studio treated people like humans like kyoani
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
all their taxes
i keep forgetting planet with existed. i really enjoyed that acid trip of a show
or am i mistaken on that
hi score girl is animated by a different studio thts not JC tho right?
also 6 other animes in 2019
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that sounds right
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
so what part is slice of life
isnt M2 the company that ports old games, usually sega?
lmao wow
wait theyre labelled the producers but outsourced every ep?
that one studio shouldnt produce around a dozen animes a year?
then like 30 trash shows
i dunno, im looking at their last 5 years and im seeing, eden zero, demon girl next door, and saiki k and thats about it.
they should learn quality over quantity
but theyre like all recent
but man JC staff has some REALLY bad shows under their belt
thats a hard disagree from me but weve been over that already lol
ah another CGDCT show
~~googles this anime~~
~~wheres gray fox when u need him~~
gotcha gotcha
whats WF stand for again
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
so why are they scarlet now
how did my text go red
wait thats not the one i liked my b. she was blonde
i had a stroke reading that
who
the one with like 5 drill hair drills was the best
i liked all the ladies who had impossible hair in that show
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
i knew that
oh
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
ah yes sitting around talking is very expensive to do
make it happen
deen s2 accel world
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yea they make great animes nobody watches like kyoukai senki
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

<:CarolBullying:816901978432733194>
no theyre passable. i need an excuse to drop them. cause theyre all meeting the bar
i really just want an excuse lol
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
ive got four shows on an episode to episode chopping block, if they give me one bad episode. theyre gone
i would just quit anime at that point
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
it better be movie quality CG
horizon in the middle of nowhere
i like how the pilots have their own digimon
<:CarolBullying:816901978432733194>

god i forgot how almost everyone in horizon is stacked af
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

U talk like I'm a ruby
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
What's that supposed to mean
What I was trying to say was . I was curious what saya had to turn yoh into to make her normal to the protag. Since it never shows her to anyone else visually.
Thank u melua. I know tho lol
I've played thru it all like a decade ag9
Yes but I mean how fucked up she became
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
U know I still wonder what happened to that one girl to look normal in his eyes.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
CGWAAFANTRTBFS
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Ah so she just takes gold
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
How does other world money even work in earth
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Isekais are all the shows where the protag doesn't want to go back to their home world. When they do. It's not an isekai, basically every show before the isekai boom
It's too vague
<a:kleeMad:838482900487372870>
Fuck the isekai genre
Like my brain just sees that as a show about world/plane travel then
<@87512939107450880> I was thinking about hagura and how he gets de isekai then goes back to the world he was isekai to but I feel like I wouldn't call him getting isekaid at that point
Is it an isekai if a character willingly goes to a different world? Or does it just become like a space/travel show at that point
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I remember the author for in another world with my smartphone forgot he had his phone for the first couple of books and thats why he barely uses it initially
<:aqua_why:795834295146119210>
God why do u remind me that trash exists
Nothing great but not awful either
Average abilities. Is an average isekai ironically
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
U aren't friends anymore right?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Nah I'm good.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
U could be isekaid into the opposite gender body and get a harem u don't want
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
But u also die. A lot
Pure suffer
Man that's like what. 2 maybe 3 five stars in fgo?
I didn't even realize bofuri was old enough to be referenced in other animes already
<a:Noddders:731696543681216532>
It was a good episode tho
i hope i dont gotta wait that many more years for a s4
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
chihayafuru s3 was like 7 or 8 years after s2
Yes he did lol
<a:Noddders:731696543681216532>
His whole fanclub. U know after helping his mom he gonna make all of them his harem
<a:Noddders:731696543681216532>
Harem any%
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
<@99695384296701952> man someone just pointed out to me this year was gundam age 10 year anniversary and Im like shit it's been THAT long already?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<@87512939107450880> you're watching it dubbed right?
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> that's all I've seen her in at least
There's always exceptions to the rule obv. But she's more often than not the busty Ara Ara girl
10,000%
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I mean it'd very rare she's not casted as the busty Ara Ara lady in a show
Disgusting
That's the Brocon from that magic school show right
I don't genshin lol
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Oh she's anju from 86. she can be kinda samey at times but maybe that's just me able to pick out her voice pretty easily in animes
Sigh brb. I have to Google who this is
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
You say that but then there's women like yoko hikasa that's just the same voice for everyone
A lot of girls I would've never guessed were voiced by the same person
<@87512939107450880> bruh yui is anos mother lmaooo
<@87512939107450880> u never told me if u were watching Nadesico dubbed
<:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
Hi millhi
Ayamine best girl
<a:Noddders:731696543681216532>
They did this so we could get to altered fabled quicker. Which is just better og muv luv
Muvluv alternative has continued the tradition of only the original episode 1 being the only good episode to a muvluv anime
<a:Noddders:731696543681216532>
Robots do be looking clean
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Or maybe it's so fast we miss all the good shit
<:aqua_why:795834295146119210>
Nothing feels worse than ||watching your fav chars die|| after playing thru two 50+ hour vns first.
Dub improves the anime by 100%
<a:kleeMad:838482900487372870>
Gross. Watch the dub
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
I only watched the original episode
Did they change her hair
?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Anime op not spoiling stuff. That's such a rarity
I feel like the muv luv chronicles would've been a better fit for animefication. With them being segmented into chapters. U could do one chapter per anime season
Tho it's weird they made ||his best bro. Into a girl||
Same
<a:kleeMad:838482900487372870>
U leave my profile name alone
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
You're right. I don't need to worry. Since I dropped it
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I liked how they realistically pulled off a duet with no practice episode 3
U know I never questioned it until now. But how does meiya get that HARD angle ponytail up and down
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ascendence of a bookworm is a great female mc book/show
<a:Noddders:731696543681216532>
Angry op. Got it
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I would but I'm at work
~~that's watched it~~
Everyone tells me how good it is
<a:Noddders:731696543681216532>
It shocked me how quality it was. Ended up being either my number one or two show that I looked forward to every week that season
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
A fashion show that was way more hype than it ever needed to be
I always gotta try the shows even if I don't think it's for me or I'll miss a hidden gem like smile down the runway
I'm just not the demographic for a show like this. I found it horribly boring and predictable. If you like it. Good on ya. But it just ain't me. Gave it a fair shake tho
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Look what I found
<@87512939107450880>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
jfc i was looking to downsize my anime collection. my the world god only knows blu ray is apparently 150 bucks now
<a:Noddders:731696543681216532>
Anime is improving the book in many ways
That was a pretty great moment
Muv luv is basically that. The beta are human eating aliens
<a:Noddders:731696543681216532>
Anime is indeed cute and funny at times. I enjoyed it. Was a decent 3 episodes
Okey
Also is Rudy younger sibling a girl or a boy
Eris truly is best girl
||Watchung eris go thru a dozen ideas before hugging Rudy was what we needed after that last scene||
<:aqua_why:795834295146119210>
Man mushoku tensei with the gut punch this episode
<a:Noddders:731696543681216532>
if the ps2 didnt exist sure. but we are def going off topic at this point
<a:Noddders:731696543681216532>
I also liked the gamecube
basically a love story anime with a side of despair
shin no nakama
its weird hearing aquas voice actually being normal and even giving good advice
aqua is a busty elf in shin no nakama. lets goooo
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I prefer dogs or cats.
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
No I agree
thats rude
millhi go away. this is far from trash
<:CarolBullying:816901978432733194>
but i want more people to watch it
i guess its just cause i love this show but id never recommened it to anyone cause of the horny
also seeing pauls side of the tragedy was very sobering
i think not
coincidence?
zero horny this episode. 10/10 episode
i feel like the shrek meme where im just like. can we just have a scene that doesnt have horny in it FOR 5 MINUTES
but i know it wont happen
i would love if this was the catalyst for the show to be less horny cause god having rudy just be a normal guy for an entire episode was jut so fucking refreshing
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
like lasts episodes bouncy scene
the only film grain i didnt like was megalo box. cause i think they were purposely making it look worse for just an aesthetic reason
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but god of highschool
action is fine but heart felt serious moments like this can be way superior imo when it hits right
this episode of Mushoku tensei was so good. my favorite by far
sounds better than the bug movie
also millhi you have HAD to have watched this. this sounds terrible and amazing https://anilist.co/anime/124965/Eoneu-Nal-Jameseo-Kkaeeoboni-Bagelyeoga-Doeeo-Isseotda/
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
why does this have a sequel
<@!152896851660505088> https://anilist.co/anime/101970/Iya-na-Kao-sare-nagara-Opantsu-Misete-Moraitai/ anime was a mistake
trinity seven got a movie? wtf
also wow strike the blood has 4 seasons? ive never seen anyone talk about this show lol
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
1 minute clips from a twitter account
i swear random shit u can have on anilist added
https://anilist.co/anime/122238/Kyokou-Uranai/
of course
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://anilist.co/manga/110063/Dai-Kyochuu-Rettou/ the manga its based off of got a sequel
also
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
the animation style looks different from the images
the ova about it might be better than the movie lol
i didnt watch it but my brother did and wew was this a trashfire when he showed my clips of it
<@!87512939107450880> https://anilist.co/anime/107880/The-Island-of-Giant-Insects-Movie/ 10/10 insect animations here
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
im taking the effort to add shorts and stuff ive seen to bloat up my score to millhi lvls
the peach is sci fi lol
im curious what mine looks like. where can i see that
https://tenor.com/view/lebron-james-leaving-walk-out-walk-away-gif-12008922
I have to finish it to add it
Nice to see tsukihime is at the bottom for us lol
My lowest
But it's really bad outside of that
Kampfer. I remember that. I give it props for having a girl who's assertive enough to make out with the MC to show her love. U don't see that in animes.
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
6.57? Are u serious. Thats .02 away from killing bites am infinitely superior show
U make me wonder what my most hated anime is on mal. Brb
Gibiate somehow got char to voice a dude in it. Was probably all their budget
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Ah yes the ps2 graphic monsters
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Bruh. He just showed the robot fight scene. Wtf did just watch
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's just a click bait title solo.
He does mention it lol
Should be a fun series
Oh boy. This is starting a new series for him called anime was a mistake.
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
<@152896851660505088> you've mentioned this anime before right
https://youtu.be/JH39iToWsxQ
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
I miss world travel animes before the isekai boom
So Cypher is confirming he will never be settled
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I thought they had to be completed
Wut
U can rate dropped shows
My dropped list is basically all my 4 and below shows lol
Same same. My complete list barely has any below 5s cause of that lol
U had to have been intoxicated
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
It's first episode feels like 2 hours
how did u finish that
Ahhh right I only watched it dubbed
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I'm sitting here like. What's a guze
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Imagine remembering weird anime terms from decades old animes
My sense of disbelief is out the window for that show
I don't even mind that. But u can tell s2 had a much lower budget. Sexy scenes were less sexy. Fight scenes were just still images with that swoosh effect on them to make it feel like movement was happening. And the fact that this dude has been around all these girls for MONTHS between s1 and 2. And during season 2, and STILL acts like it's his first time seeing elf boobs. Like bro u gonna get desensitized over time if every day is like that.
Season 2 was awful sadly. S1 is Like a 7
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
There is a fansub group doing the text too
How is it? I'm told netflix wasn't translating any of komi text so u missed a lot of convo
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
They probably found some change in the couch to afford it
now thats just being mean
Like if the MC wasn't around. Wouldn't everyone have just died in that race
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
Why did he just have a bag of Evo fruits
110%
Ragnarok isekai is still worse tho
I agree. But I'll still somehow finish it unlike other terrible isekais
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Nah she's too much of a narcissist to love someone else. No gay here
i get that fenny but i dunno maybe cause it usually focused on different people it never got boring to me like other SoL shows
you got hibiki spider, hibiki witch, hibiki nazi loli. lots of hibiki isekais
yep
ive been killing slimes for 300 years is another top tier isekai. its so chill and wholesome
sometimes it takes a man to be best girl - gigguk 2020
lmao shut up ash
iruma kun introduced the bestest of best girls for me
its great
its like an early 2000s anime but made like 2 years ago
oh another fantastic isekai anime i love to recommend is Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun <@!331908049822547978>
god when we get an isekai and its not a weeb MC. thats a win in my book
you dont get a weeb MC. u get a book nerd who has normal life skills
its the one isekai i recommend the most
not two things i would think
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
executioner and niceness
probably why the only good ones are the ones that happened to be neither of those like bookworm
when is it coming out
ive never heard of that one fenny
s2 was very unnecessary out of anything ive seen of late but hey
bakarina was a fun one
i would argue it is. yes the mc is pure slime, but he is doing what he can to better himself. yea he stumbles across the way but he had a very fucked up mentality that would take years to unfuck up
i def dont deny that a large portion of isekai are mediocre to awful. but i feel like all genre's are like that in a way, we are just getting an influx of isekai cause its the new hot thing
its wonderful
yea faraway paladin is like MT if u removed the horny
thats interesting ash cause bookworm its very about her knowledge of previous world. unlike other isekais
its in my top 10 animes
same
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and dammit u beat me to it fenny with bookworm
some of my favorite shows in the past decade have been isekais honestly. cause the few that are good, are just that good
as a known hater of the Harem genre. just cause the genre is bad doesnt mean a good show cant come from it.
its just a well written story. it doesnt try to be anything more than that. no gimmick like a smartphone or anything like that
i mean you can not like it sure, i know many people who hate it cause of the main char which is completly fair. but the quality of it still exists.
MT is one of the best isekais out there
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
also i skipped cheat magician. is it that bad? lol
i mean thats still a shoujo
sounds like Magical Girl Ore
people can be selfish. he's just one of them. he was about to be not selfish but then ep 2 happened
i mean that part is true
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
i think youre blowing it a bit out of proportion
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
i like him
sakugan is super boring to me i dunno why
i dont mind takt. ep 2 really helped show a better side of him. im only 3 or 4 eps in tho so that could change.
nah thats sakugan
I need SOME kinda of plot to be moving forward
I can definitely agree to that fenny
<:CarolBullying:816901978432733194>
i hate that the bows dont match colors
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i miss my giant alient girlfriend cant be this cute. 3d animation
i have no idea. at least we got shikizakura, an actually competant 3d anime
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yea i did. i said Ex-arm 2.0
oh god i forgot about Muteking the Dancing hero. if u want an incohrenet mess that gives u a color palette like youre on acid. that exists now
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
irina is def not a comedy so i figured that wouldve been obv lol
ex -arm 2.0
two animes that are definitely yaoi
OH YEA, there was a really bad vampire comedy anime i dropped mid episode 1
i think its logged as this season cause of how late it aired in last season
thing u havent mentioned that ive tried. digimon has been really good. sunrise not gundam is boring, heike was also boring to me, shikizakura is a surprisingly decent looking 3d only show, build divide is a decent cardgame anime if u ever need that itch scratched, and platinum end just gets worse as it goes on
i gave up on mal when Yu-no was rated higher than a 2
its a really emotional show
and blue period is def anime of season contender
oh yea my friend has told me how wild that show is. ousama
im really bummed like all the mecha shows this season are kinda meh
i just couldnt
it was so boring man
i forgot selection project existed
i really need to catch up on all my shows, im like 2-3 ep behind with all of them. all my free time has been going to srw 30
Mary best mom of this season
Rit is legit best girl. shes fighting with miko and the taishou girl for top girl of the season
shin no nakama really surprised me, i expected poop isekai and got a not isekai Romance show thats really fucking cute
i dropped senpai at ep 3. i did very much enjoy it but its one of those shows me and fenny talked about earlier where it doesnt really go anywhere so its hard to keep attention span. its def qualityt tho
my personal top 3 this season are Mieruko. Blue Period and Faraway paladin
good picks krotash taishou is probably the best of those three imo. its so cute and fluffy
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>

<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
<@87512939107450880> https://youtu.be/q_fiYkd17kA
God this is one of those images that just gets worse the more u look at it
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm getting dreamed about
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
Good old mobile game animes
I really need to catch up on all the shows. I'm so behind on everything
Takt episode 2 has the longest period I can think of with no talking. Which still blows my mind. All that piano goodness
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
I'd still give it to takt personally.
<:TB:441562395245281281>
Every female thighs in thay universe
<:SmugStar:902381082656276550>
Just wait for the crossover
I like little scenes like that cause it feels real. Like you'd see that irl
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I forgot lanks doesn't like the superior dynazenon but no need to retread that convo
~~top bad it doesn't stay strong~~
Good times
Remember when akiza was supposed to be the third of the trio of top duelists in 5Ds but crows deck was so popular irl. That he got the spot instead
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Females in yugioh done dirty? Sounds like yugioh to me
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
To be fair. Kids could be real shit and trick others in trading bad cards for good cards
I'd love to get back into yugiog but none of the art styles after 5ds really jive with me.
<:WhatTheTom:741816166237995038>
So kinda like pokemon sun and moon
Oh neat.
Ah cool I was right
Sevens I think?
What's the current yugioh. The one that looks like the MCs are beyblade chars
Get these bitch ass MCs out of here
If only more anime moms did that
<a:aigismoney:859106437673123860>
Ah. I was told to watch Arc V cause they do some shenanigans to bring back old chars like Crow and Alexis
Yuya is... Zexal right?
<:SmugStar:902381082656276550>
I stopped at 5ds
I'll be shocked when yugioh shows a dad
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
But they showed Yugi's mom before
Remember when yugi lost once. It devastated him
Howcome
Really?
With how crazy yugioh cards can be
Rush duels sound kinda wild. Drawing to 5 every turn
<a:aigismoney:859106437673123860>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Wait what's Tim currey in?
From an outsider looking in. That's how dynazenon looks to me
I don't know anything about the ultra series.
We just lack costumes
I'd say dynazenon emulates super sentai more with it being more team oriented with a giant robot like super sentai. Vs an ultraman show like gridman
I dunno, I'd argue a good portion of the antagonist in gridman is just doing whatever they want and getting rid of things they don't like.
U can have depth to chars and then have wackiness as well. Super sentai does it all the time.
But that's how the shows they emulate are
Like ultraman or super sentai
U don't really need a reason. There's just more monsters to fight
I mean they're both just monster of the week kaijus. So I don't really put much depth behind either season for that.
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
If only a Kaiju was made who couldn't lose
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I don't think they physically can derek
I liked them a lot. The fact they ||would just have casual conversations with the dynazenon protags|| felt they were just people like anyone else
She's easily the best part of the show
Akane saved the show for me. The episode she was revealed as ||villian|| was the same episode I was gonna drop it out of boredom lol
<:TB:441562395245281281>
I dunno if I missed it or it's never mentioned but I had to be told after gridman ended that bors was a boy. I just assumed female cause of female VA and cute lol
That's what I think makes it better than gridman. A lot of the extra chars in gridman kinda fall flat. Or lack screentime. Like all the extra armaments to gridman. Outside of caliber who got the most out of the 4. Glasses dude was kinda pointless. I hope the better writing they did for dynazenon can flesh out the chars of gridman in the crossover. Cause then itd be perfect
Lanks love gridman and hates dynazenon last I checked
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I mean the studio is improving. Of course dynazenon will be more enjoyable
i wish i could play that again. not on pc game
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
oh sick. Turn A is a secret unlock for G generation genesis
man i havent thought about Turn A in forever
oh my brain didnt even consider Loran but yea i guess technically he is UC
what gundam newtype pilots would u rank below him?
i wonder why they give him poor stats in gundam games then. cause i always feel he is incredibly low, for a protagonist
i know but it definitely helps
is he as poor as say shiro,kou,christina since  theyre all oldtypes? when it comes to gundam pilots or is he above them but below newtypes like Banagher
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
As sad as how middle of the road Jona is?
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
I wish every unit got as much love as gridman does in srw 30
That's bizarre
Huh. I wonder if they wanted to try to make it multiseasonal like MMPR but wasn't as popular so the idea got scrapped
Was the big bad defeated?
Ah this show existed basically when I was birthed. No wonder I don't recognize it.
Lmao that's a name. I gotta Google this
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And genocide
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
Yo these new duel master cards look sick
i wish i had manga when i was in school
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

I'm so hyped for more bookworm
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
Bruh why is rikka eye so offset vs the other one in a promotional art
now give them 500 dollars

gotcha
for which one
wut
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
the same guy did Aldnoah Zero right?
damn. rip, i remember the plot related things at least.
im gonna assume that was a one time scene cause i dont remember anything about that melua
i loved gargantia
<a:APetForShirabe:753351050215293020>
me!
i do have the two nendoroids tho from the anime
i remember wanting her figure for a long ass time when i was younger lol
<:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>

i simp for leena in CZ but most importantly Kotona in Genesis
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
in original series yea
it must be doing fucking well tho. 50 episodes, then a 50 episdoe Zoids wild Zero. and now Zoids wild Senki
oh yea i forgot they did that
i have zero clue on where Wild lands
fuzors was like more Century zero but not as good
im told Zoids Genesis is worth watching. its more akin to the first series being post apocolyptic apparently
the company that did the first two zoids shows. is now owned by sunrise since 2019 and called Sunrise Beyond... arent they doing that new mecha this season? <@!87512939107450880>
wait
in the west
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
its so weird how Zoids New century got aired first. then after that we got the first series. like how gundam went backwards. but this was only 1 year apart so the graphics didnt become horrendous
ah, in america is all just called chaotic century. nothing to differentiate between the time skip
i know chaotic century, Century Zero, Fuzors, Genesis and wild
whats guardian forces
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
i miss zoids
out of all the longer series. i dunno why i have such a hard time remembering Age exists
okay cool. i always wondered if i was missing out on anything
is it worth sitting thru? i watched the first episode and i honestly felt like i had an aneurism trying to follow the single episode
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
dont forget build fighters Real
still blows my mine hitorribochi VA was the first time she's done anime
*looks at those animes who hire a complete newbie for the MC. not even background character roles*
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
i still remember one of her first roles and oof. she's grown a hell of a lot as a VA
aoi yuuki is fun at least in her roles.
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
well youre already watching the anime. so its too late at that point
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
sure it is. just go in blind every time
thats good to hear. the first game was painfully mediocre. ill have to give it a shot
Nah I'm onto bigger better figures now
HD remasters when of all Zoids. so we can do a watch party of every zoids from start to finish
its so fucking cute
LOOK AT THE BIRB

lol minervamon. shes basically just a person. i barely remember shes a digimon
YOOOOO theres a bofuri model kit. this is wild
It's still interesting we have gotten every season even if it hasn't been as popular
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
or all the digimon fans just grew up and a new generation never caught onto it
i feel like it was watched up till season 4 kinda killed it. probably had bad toy sales
i love the direction it took
ghost game really surprised me with its quality for the first few episodes
i stopped 4 weeks into this season of anime and have been procrastinating starting things back up lol
mostly sunrise mechas
i dont have a lot of anime originals under my belt honestly
to leave to our interpretations
tho japan likes to make opened ended endings
usually
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
its honestly so refreshing to get an anime with an actual ending lol
Akudama Drive is one of my fav anime originals personally
<a:hyperu:857284643891052564>
OH melua! cybaster HG was on sale at usagundam store. i snagged one with some other stuff in my order
i need to finish flip flappers
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
oh she's apart of the new love live too
wild
i just looked up Aru from Hittoribochi. shes the smug smol detective from inspectre and Masked oppai from Gridman
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
LIKE COME ON
ALSO fuck 300 years of killing slimes for having a literal singing episode where EVERYONE sings once EXCEPT for aoi yuuki
is there a full version of that? cause its like a 10 second clip in the show
lmao rip
she uh... wasnt good at yelling back then like she is now
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
or really? i recognized her as borr. the character i legit had no clue she did (probably cause she was new) is Kirara in Gundam build fighters
there is a goddess scene in the ep tho
no, its a plot scene
it was a good episode dont forget to watch the after credits scene
I'm bummed they gimped her story in Ultra sun vs OG. But oh well at least the original still exists
MR needs to pull a Digimon Next order and give us two monsters so we can have a comeback mechanic for when one dies and one is alive to lessen the downtime between deaths
i usually get like 2-3 lifes in and get tired of reraising my dudes to progress
ive never beaten a MR
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
switch and steam
yea MR 1+2 i think
i never really watched the monster rancher show since it was early morning. but i did play most of hte games
but yokai watch exploded in japan when it first came out.
i mean neither is digimon
~~Yokai Watch is second place~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
remember when Hau thought she was like 11
thanks melua. i had no idea she got a new style
pony tail lusamine. niceeee
i think she just starts with short hair in the anime doesnt she?
~~i still dont understand why serena was given short hair and not her awesome long hair from the game~~
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
im curious why they skipped Hilda for Black and white to be adventuring with ash. serena is in  X and Y. and then they skipped protag again in Sun and Moon
i heard sun and moon was really good to be episodic
~~when is venusmon gonna get added to the anime/games~~
whoops
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
oh looking at their stats.... theyre actually on par with megas in awakened form
yea, why add these new mon in. and give them to u so late. like i was ultimate/mega level already by the time they join u. like cool? ill never use u
and Ultra was just like a fan term
remember when they used to not know what to do with digimon that were past mega level strength
<:pepesus:740994936484397066>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
unless the game fucked up that hard on how to put them in stage
the wiki is just wrong then lol
for their base form yea
i wish the sistermon were useful in the game. i think theyre supposed to be Ultimate or mega level digimon in their adult forms but they got relagated to Champions in Cybersleuth. making them useless
dukemon CM
<:doge:496780220309962772>
my team was very red by the end of the game
Wargreymon, Emperor Greymon, Shine Greymon BM.
i think the only waifu mons i used in cyber were sakuyamon and Lillith mon. i mostly just had a lot of greymons lol
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
every even season was a miss. and every odd season was a hit. imo (tho season 6 was decent till it wasnt)
makes me so happy
im 8 eps into shin no nakama. man rit and red are the cutest fucking couple
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
~~shake the book~~
<:emoji_5:710717148955148328>
using the word cringe is kinda cringe
and not in color. and doesnt yell at me
i watch anime
im not a manga reader.
im so hyped for next episode
No. It's just CGDCT.
<:ramHeh:642526539287625733>
~~he sang it better anyways~~
What's oldcodex
He was a huge actor. 7ds propelled him into lots of roles imo
If only he was as faithful as the char he voiced. Rip Ban
That's a big rip.
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
Is he okay?
What???? Why
Gets toned down for LN or manga
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
From what I've gleaned
WN always tend to be the edgiest or shock valueist
<:yuuki1:647988654345551922>
Well there's no point in watching any other animes tonight. That would be unfair to them
<@171395487247630336> shit I didn't even catch the first time ||he pushed air magic into his mouth to breath||
I was so absorbed in the events I didn't even register it
I'm rewatching it and man. The music is on fucking point
I'm just sitting here soaking it in
I legit had goosebumps that entire interaction. The desperation was done so fucking well. I'm not gonna forget this scene
Just caught up in mushoku tensei. Holy crap the latest episode was amazeballs
i love the episode when hes forced to fight in a galactic torunament against his will and people think its rigged cause he keeps winning
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Any sales?
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
I was answering your question but aight. I'll avoid that in the future
im gonna need a coma until season 2 after next week
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
easily my aoty
man this half has had three absolute banger episodes
BRUH U CANT DO THIS TO ME
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
oh shit only one???
theres what 2 episodes left?
i really hope next episode is her perspective like how we got roxy view for a couple episodes
||do you think she wouldve stayed if he stuck to his guns and didnt segs her?||
<@!171395487247630336> i cant think of another anime that just ||deletes the entire protags party and now he's alone again for quite some time possibly||
this is such a unique circumstance tho.
dont forget the beginning episode portion
<:asagicry:851512192133890099>
for two people ash
also ||rip eris hair.||

im just in utter confusion just like he was
the ending
WTF
<@!171395487247630336> BROOOOO
ill be back when its done but shit. when this anime stops being pervy, it doesnt serious emotional moments so fucking well
im so sad
im only 10 mins into the episode. fucccccckkkkk
Interesting
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
How does that work
unless they allow dragon maid S2. i couldnt see any of those shows even being nominated sadly
its hard to forget that dumpster fire lol
bruh same
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
I don't think sequels count cause I don't remember attack on titan or my hero winning multiple years. And u know they would just cause of the popularity contest
you got any contenders to throw in the ring?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<@!171395487247630336> who do you think will be duking it out for AOTY? im expecting Mushoku Tensei vs 86 vs Vivy. (not including sequels of course)
How long does that take? I did the 3 episode rule and I was bored out of my mind.
I feel the same way. She's always just come off as a cool char rather than something that's supposed to make u sweat. Even with her less clothing outfits.
Yea I feel like no Sheryl nome figures really capture her well. Something always feels... off
That's just Stockholm kicking in
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Bleach didn't get a sequel. It's just coming back to finish the manga technically
Oh yea inuyasha did get a sequel didn't it?

Wasnt that vesperia anime from when Yuri was a knight decent?
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
as much as people praise japan. i feel like japan bullying is some of the most brutal school bullying ive seen both anime and non anime related
im so proud of rudy
that was a good final episode tho
where my season 2
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
<@!171395487247630336> Mushoku tensei
Oh speaking of isekai. I watched knights and magic finally. It was fun. Nothing mind blowing but I can add it to the small good isekai pile that exists
The whole X face for elf girl. I don't get it. They want it to be a funny thing. But it was never funny
diskotek is doing gods work. finding old negatives of movies or animes lost to time to remaster them
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
Every time I buy one all I get are kidneys or spleens
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I need an actual brain in general
Oh yea. Assassin isekai MC mom is funny as shit. A great anime mom
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
Rinku?
Is the last episode tomorrow?
Fuck that show
I'm just glad it's not another redo healer
I personally don't consider him bad. But to each their own
As long as his network of info is good. He shouldn't accidently kill a good person
At least he has the benefit of choosing of determining if a person is good or bad. Instead of just blindly following orders
Like the girls answer I think every person determines if he's good or bad. To an outsider like us. I'd consider him good cause he's taking out the garbage from the kingdom.
<:shirokosip:832978277357584464>
Cutest fucking couple I've seen in awhile
Also u would enjoy shin no nakama. That also has a nice romance that progresses thru the show
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
People on reddit memed on that so hard. ||oh no! He gave a homeless girl a warm bed, food and a job! What a brainwashing!||
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But it's also not earth which means isekai
~~World trigger best isekai~~
I enjoy reading solo leveling hero
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Or a webtoon/online comic
I could see myself enjoying manga if they were in color but that'll never happen. Lol
I'm an anime only person. When the next season drops next year I'm watching it tho
<:pepesnuggle:648972696436080641>
I guess I just don't like lumping so many good shows with the dreaded isekai tag
Most pre isekai boom beats anyone post isekai boom really lol
I don't think it's fair to pick protags before the isekai genre was made like 10 years ago. They're completely different types of shows even if they share the same plot point of other world travel.
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
Usagi drop the ball
~~myne is just a book version of ernie~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Like your kidneys, a liver, A couple intestines...
I see great things in you
<:SmugMokou2:893685383093698620>
Yet
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ernie from knights and magic is more no libido
I wish we got more goddess screen time. The more she pops up the more intriguing she becomes to me
I dunno it's a large distance tho
Or region?
In another country
I mean. ||he's already done that with Maha. She's the leader of a store. With her orphanage sisters as the workers||
Those fucking monsters
For days
I literally just sat on my bed and did nothing
I went into a three day depression after that scene.
stahp!
why do they want us to suffer
why
i saw the cursed info of s2 muvluv
also millhi
this is wild haha
TV anime " #Assassination Aristocrat " won the 1st place in the simulcast viewing ranking of this season on Crunchyroll in North America! 🎊
And even in China bilibili, it has exceeded 100 million playbacks!
lol fair
<:doge:496780220309962772>
apparently the show is a hit with housewives? lmao thats funny af to hear from the author
feels like it needed a, btw heres a season 2 announcment tho
also finished assassin isekai. that was a fun final episode
at least for the west i feel like the word isekai itself is just used for the anime boom. while everything before is called time travel anime or World travel anime. sure isekai literally means world travel but most people know if you mention isekai youre gonna think of a specific set of animes vs stuff like digimon and what not even if they do fall under that umbrella of term.
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
what, i thought her whole curse sthick is taken care of by the end of the show, why make her betray
yea
theres a movie?
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
i hate that evol made aquarion kinda worse in retrospect thanks to the apollo reveal
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
only in anime. (and netflix adaptations)
mikono is the purple haired one right
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i thought the moral was being a giant woman is life goals
im in the derek camp. i lost interest in the first few eps but i still watched it to completion cause its aquarion. xD
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
gotta get people to watch it by slapping aquarion onto it tho
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
why couldnt evol just have been fully good
its such a shitty dilemma
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
yea the lowest point of aquarion never reaches the lows of evol
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
or just stay in ignorant bliss
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
aquarion then aquarion evol. thats it
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
apollo and gen got good dub voices
i think so yes. ive seen bad dubs and this is definitely not one of them.
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
i also watched it fully dubbed and enjoyed original aquarion that way
if youre okay with an episodic anime. i would say yes. if you dont like episodic shows. id vote no.
i was JUST thinking about the vampire girl. i feel like there was so much mystery around her that just never gets addressed in aquarion
it wouldve made wayyy more sense if fudou was the third pilot cause of his element ability
thats fair
apollo sees apollonius in aquarion ||so how is he there but also reincarnated into fudo as well||
i have a question
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
yea that reveal confuses me cause why would he be okay with ||a dog hooking up with his lover that he promised to always be with||
<a:aigismoney:859106437673123860>
YES
My bro just started the best episode. I'm so hyped
Fair
<@171395487247630336> thinking back. ||I think it kinda weird ruijerd bails while knowing rudeus mother Is still missing and doesn't help||
I only gave it a try cause space odyssey animes just never happened. And then the first episode won me over
I agree
Yea I just thought it was cool it was being made before the anime even happened
I can't remember the last time I was excited for an anime game. (Tho technically this is a manga game)
It's as cursed as when millhi posted it
Yea I'm excited. The preview at the end of the episode for future content looks dark af. I'm hyped
The metal harvest planet
<:HuTaoAYAYAY:806234426572668949>
Just finished Edens zero. Man that was a fun show. Can't wait for season 2
dont be kotoko. id rather have a good episode than a shat out low quality one just to make the time slot. i can be patient
Get back in your can
I assume you'd melt the rock then
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
In before sequel of Duo leveling. Or Group Leveling
two more animes knocked down. one finished. one dropped. slowly getting thru whats left to finally have a clean anime slate
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Own any shounen figures
Do i...
<:SmugMokou2:893685383093698620>
Carol and fine figures would be lit
So it's basically no figures
The worst part is when an anime Gets like 1 or maybe 2 figures. And it's not even of a character you like
Rip millhi
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
Then why did 5 seconds to battle get one
You'd be surprised.
I'm surprised that anime got figures
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Kimetsu no Maiba.
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Is it sfw
I own the one non expensive chris figure that's now expensive lol
I would not have a use for plusses personally
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
I'd love to own them. But I'm sure as he'll not spending 300+ to do it
Rip
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Who can afford those outrageous symphogear prices
Yesterday*
I got my rem and ram figures in the mail today
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Anime figures are anime
<:HuTaoAYAYAY:806234426572668949>
I know. I just like chatting with you
<:SmugMokou2:893685383093698620>
But whats more
Are they naturally nsfw or do u have to do cast off the make them nsfw
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I just tried to put on glasses but in wearing contacts
<:SmugMokou2:893685383093698620>
Go on
There's so many weird tags
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
Tags are a very...not good determination of that
Kosmos, tharja, sorceress, God eater girls, selvaria etc.
Looking at my collection. Like half of them are video game chars. So they can't even be Shonen lol
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
<@152896851660505088> u own any Shonen figures
I dunno why I didn't like this show but man that red head is top tier waifu design
<:SmugMokou2:893685383093698620>
Probably as nice as a plush
That sure is a cover alright
My brain lumped it into battle high-school anime
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Wait. Is trinity seven a shounen?
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
Over 100 figures and I see zero shounen
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@87512939107450880> <@99695384296701952>

Depends on how the fist is being done
<:SmugStar:902381082656276550>
Add swords or guns. Then they're cool
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That's why u go for cool anime stuff. Like me. And not lewd stuff like millhi
I don't really wanna take the effort to set up in an apartment
Until I get my own home to furnish.
That's my issue with my whole collection of stuff.
Ah that one
<:SmugMokou2:893685383093698620>
What is it. I might want it
They're gonna be shipped monday
~~I also wasted close to 200 bucks on senran kagura tapestries~~
When the next cheapest was 19 dollars and 10 shipping. So I got pretty good deals lol
<a:aigismoney:859106437673123860>
I got these for 15 a piece with free shipping.
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
Yea but  most prize figures sell for like 25-30 in US stores
I got these for cheap cause their boxes were all messed up
Gottem
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
<:SmugStar:902381082656276550>
Show
i did get a laugh about the Checking behind you thing for the RPG. didnt think they would add that detail
i feel like you could swap japan with any other country military and nothing would really change
also i was forced to watch it dubbed. so im not a fan of his voice but that will probably change when i get to watch the sub later
ah. i guess im just tired of weeb protags. all of his Huge weeb moments dont add anything and arent funny in any way
who?
I'm halfway thru gate. I feel like I'd enjoy it more if the MC was someone else
2 in fact
i mean theres an actual anime with a centaur girl in it
its an original character
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
like what
its a figure
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<@!222517038042710017> <@!722121666641133608> <@!87512939107450880>
Not insanely common. But common enough
It's a decently common last name
Minami is in dynazenon
Thats a strange acquisition
it is
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
How the f do they top bofuri s1. She's broken beyond belief <@171395487247630336>
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I wonder if he could even reproduce if he bothered to make organs that could
Slime is slime
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I would. They're in a female body
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
While dude ones are like a 1/5 chance at best to being good
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
To be fair. At least for animes. I think female protag isekais have a 100% hit rate. Outside of maybe one
Such a fun cute show
This show was so much better than it ever needed to be
LETS FUCKING GOOOO
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
then we can count it in x years
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
then it doesnt count
nevr heard of that anime
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
so aoi yuuki spider anime or we talking something different?
zerg rush?
thats all i can really think of off the top of my head for female isekais
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
so im a spider so what if you pretend the last few episodes didnt exist
villianess
but other than that. every isekai with a female protag is a banger for me
bookworm
Killing slimes
Tanya the evil
etc.
she does bring over japanese cooking and some household products but yea isekai part is very not needed lol
just not what i wanted out of an isekai
the only one i can think of is the omnipotence Potion girl one and i think it was just too much romance for me and thats not meaning its bad
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
female protagonist isekai are alwasy fun*
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
leadale is cute in general tho. when was the last time we got an elf protag
Also note to self. Always make elf chars from now on in video games so I can live forever
Watching her get to do all the things she never got to do. Is gonna be wholesome af I hope
That's a very different start to an isekai
I like that the MC was ||hospitalized for who knows how long and hasn't walked or eaten in forever.||
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
U watched a whole aniem from yesterday to today?
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
I mean we are only 4 shows in. Give it time lol
I enjoyed Leadale cause it might be like another slime anime where she just wants to chill/do whatever she wants. Orient was fun cause it could just be a little shounen to turn your brain off to. Also people died which was unexpected

im not gonna die on this hill. you can think what you want. and ill think what i want
meh
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
one random thing i wanna throw out for tanya in her favor. the fact he keeps his hair long and doesnt cut it when that shit would be tiring to maintain. especially at a young age body. any guy would cut that shit to not deal with it especially in the military
rip son xD
i mean so im a spider plot doesnt matter if shes female at all but everyone still considers her a female
lmao wut
thats a weird point to be critical about
i mean a lot of female protagonist animes i would say dont matter if theyre female in the end. i would still call them female protagnists tho
its not even generbending at this point. he;s literally a girl now from reincarnation and deals with it
watch the anime. aoi yuuki is so good as tanya
he was reborn as a girl. so id say yea
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
i would say any world travelling show pre 2010 doesnt count cause isekai is definitely a label more towards the Light novel trend then the actually good writing shows of old
<:emoji_5:710717148955148328>
as an anime only watcher. other sources dont exist to me
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
We would do the same if we met our real life waifus
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Insert Phineas meme of two things happening
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
I confused this anime with the other anime this season where a guy is trapped in an isekai in a female body
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Just in case
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i wish i was as popular as that disease
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Mobile games need to be on princess connect or taktop levels of animation or just not bother
Yo he can jump out a small ass window like a champ. I wanna aspire to that level of yeet
I'll watch it
Yes
<@155340660738621440> <@171395487247630336>
https://youtu.be/lQIFC__VOUo
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Ironically I feel like average abilities is a very average show
Wow I'm surprised AgK could write something good
Strongest sage weakest crest was better than I expected.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
U win!
Sisters
interesting
so slow loop went from CGDCT to CSDCT.
Sono bisque doll was cute and funny. And has this seasons best girl. Finally a decent show to watch
tokyo 24ku was also weird. and boring. so thats a drop
well tribe nine was a weird show. but im down to watch more. danganronpa artstyle saves it from going into the dropped pile

gungnir datto!?
Sabikui Bisco has shot up to the most interesting show this season for me. i liked it al ot
Of course yoko hikasa is the busty boss
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Man the blonde in cue. Is top tier <@263392442345193472>
Ah first anime.
Man this Futsal protag. Has a... unique voice
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Wait is the pink hair supposed to be the commander?
<:pepesnuggle:648972696436080641>
Man it's kinda fucked. ||they let all those support units just die|| <@152896851660505088>
Yo this op tho
<:pepesnuggle:648972696436080641>
Girls Frontline is next... mobile game anime yay...

<a:aigismoney:859106437673123860>
I wanna watch these now

That's legit cool
Oh shit. It shows the actual live action shows the stuff is based off of in the credits
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
Lmao. Not Tanya turned the muscle dude who's gonna beat the hero  into a waifu. 10/10
I'm really enjoying this comedy about the bad guys trying to make monsters too fight the good guys. Hits my super sentai itch
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
That sure is an episode title
<a:aigismoney:859106437673123860>
Yo super sentai and Kamen rider knock offs. Let's gooo
<:SmugStar:902381082656276550>
Gotta try every first episode
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh Hai tanya
8 more shows to go. Let's goooo
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
But half of them haven't even released yet
onto the next anime
Well it wasn't bad. But I won't be giving it a second episode
I feel like a dub would only make it worse honestly.
This was the most watchable kind of gay if I had to make a gauge.
It's not what I'm interested in watching
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Which I'm not
I have a feeling the plot will slow down in an episode or two
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Never
And Sasaki to miyano was also pretty decent. But I am NOT the demographic for this anime
I think it's a single ova
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>

A bit yea
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
One piece
<:rosabae:622214125598015508>
This season is fairly weak in general tho. I wonder if people held off their bangers cause they don't wanna compete with AoT and Demon slayer two of the top 3 animes atm
<:HuTaoAYAYAY:806234426572668949>
my current 3 top shows are Bisque doll. Sabikui Bisco and sailor girl
Is that the doll one?
so of the things that survived the 1 ep drop
cue!, girls frontline, not dynasty warriors, orient and slow loop are on 3 ep watch. while the rest unless they fuck up hard ill probably watch to completion
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Done with all the first eps that are currently out <@155340660738621440>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Finished the infamous anime.
<:PepeHappy:789575003204091944>
Like I said. I only cared about the show when I saw my boi cao cao
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
It took me way too long into the show to realize horimiya is their last names combined
Nice! I enjoyed that quite a bit
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
Did they write a new one when horimiya popped up?
so I wasn't interested in gensou sangokushi.. UNTIL MY BOY CAO CAO ARRIVED
<a:aigismoney:859106437673123860>
<:PepeHappy:789575003204091944>
I'll support anime industry by buying blu rays and figures
I just pirate cause I can't afford eighty billion streaming services
This biggest BRUH I've seen in awhile <@222517038042710017> <@171395487247630336>
Leadale is looking to be my favorite isekai of the four tho. It looks like it'll be another 300 years killing slimes. Or at least I hope it is
I personally didn't have an issue at all with strongest crest. I enjoyed the first episode. Kenya no deshi  tho... that was one of the worst first episodes I've seen in a hot minute
i feel like people would just be better off starting at episode 2
just watched both isekai that came out. man that non comedy one sure is boring. also i think it won the award for longest period with no talking. its literally just music for 4 fucking minutes straight
shocker. slow loop is slow.
slow loop episode 2. i dont understand the appeal of the flesh fang. why not give them an actual fang tooth
but why tho
I've also got few others. I'm super curious what survives after 3 episodes
I'm watching all those as well
I like how half of that list is Saturday animes. Makes it easy lol
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
What are you watching this season?
<:snekwoah:854100552773533757>
~~you forgot girls frontline~~
that was cool blast
i dont remember that in the anime series
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHXBtYAwndQ good old monkey boy got a role in an anime
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
let me have my joke
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
are we stuck in a time loop? someone just pointed out to me was had attack on titan final season winter 2021. now we have attack on titan final season winter 2022 <@!171395487247630336>
<:PepeHappy:789575003204091944>
Saturday Monday and maybe weds if you like leadale. Are the days that matter
It did yes
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
U better
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
2nd episode is even better
<:PepeHappy:789575003204091944>
Nah cause anime can't write
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Probably cause politics barely happens in animes
<:pepewaifuknight:642147377574182933>
Yes
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
This isn't slime s2 levels of political dialog where it's actually interesting
I think it's cause they dragged it out with long pauses and random other talk stuff. Easily could've fit the whole dialog into one episode
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
in another world with my truck
im pretty sure someone here mentions that. where a guy and his truck get killed by an even bigger truck and get isekai'd
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
OH
knights and magic season 2?
holy shit Sono Bisque doll. top tier anime. best show of this season
Cue! was fine. much more watchable than selection project at least
second episode of Girls frontline wouldve been better as the first episode and couldve just axed the first episode
Low res but u get the idea

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@453836798796234762> probably the bustiest woman she plays
Evil busty chick in shadow house
It just had its second episode so no surprise there
The boss in the new anime Cue!
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Freya from danmachi. Hina from domestic girlfriend. Etc. Etc.
Lol yea she's not all busty but she's Def been more and more as the years go by
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
Lol she's type casted to be busty babes I swear
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
your bottom left corner is missing. might wanna fix that
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
That otomege looks... cultured
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Yea it's not bad. Just one of the many shows you'll forget exist like a day after you finish it
A very bog standard isekai
Like the name. It's average. Not amazing but not awful either
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
But they kept aelita CG?
The fuck is evolution
Code lyoko has such a good op
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I do love me some tim curry
I refuse
<a:pepeout:641047947315904562>
second episode of akebi chan. jesus this show needs to stop being so fucking pretty all the time. its putting all the other shows to shame
<:SmugStar:902381082656276550>
U gonna share your jelly donut?
Full adaption pls
But do I want to
<:pepeMonka:710716920952782911>
2nd episode
How Is it shit? I haven't watched it yet
Ohhh lmao
Wut
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Because there's not enough space to knife or fork them
i do find it funny how number 1 and 3 are different hentai protag genres and number 2 is the anime protag
yea i expected it to be way worse
<:pepesnuggle:648972696436080641>
<@171395487247630336> there's too long of a gap between anime days
It's nice seeing the roles reversed and humans aren't enslaving all the non human sces
<a:aigismoney:859106437673123860>
We need more chapters. I want more revenge
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Hard agree
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Anyone see that shenmue the animation coming Feb 5th
there was a new girl in strongest sage? i thought and then the only new char i can think of is the GIANT black dragon
her badboy fetish is hilarious
Hori-san best girl
<@!87512939107450880> final episode of s3 world trigger was so gud
its so fucking amazing
i really like Akebi herself. shes a good MC
yes
its just a enjoyable slice of life
Akebi continues to give jaw dropping prettyness in ep 3.
<@!171395487247630336> i think this is the first time in a like a year or two where my watched list is already only one line at the three episode mark of the season
all the good shows are today
already watched it bro
its killing me
<@!171395487247630336> i seriously cant wait week to week for bisque doll
Gimme chonk
2021 is gonna be such a hard year to top. but it could happen. people thought 2018 was gonna be the best year of anime for a hot minute and only 3 years later it was topped
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
broly and final eva movie
2021 was packed to the brim was good shows all around for every genre
well we had insane shows like vivy, mushoku tensei, to your eternity and then really good shows like hormiya, tokyo revengers, sk8 the infinity, 86, vanitas, kemono jihen, mieruko chan, blue period, killing slimes, tomozaki, eden zero, iruma kun s2. quintuplets s2, demon slayer, eva final movie
it just goes on and on
it was
man watching gigguks best anime of 2021. as shit of a year it was in general. it might be one of if not the best singular year of anime
<:emoji_5:710717148955148328>
also shirt was open revealing skin
If the anime is good. I feel like that'll be the best way to consume the stpry
What are those
Same. I just watch whatever pops up on new seasons. I never know what's gonna happen ahead of the current season
Oh rie will have the main role in kotaro lives alone. An ONA being made thanks to netflix
Came back to do Rio in chihayafuru season 3 7 years later
Yea reminds me of ayahi. Really only comes back to do old roles
<a:aronathink:804142666345742369>
She's the goddess in the new isekai Romcom. And I believe she was the assassin girl in banished from the heroes party. She Def doesn't do a lot of roles anymore tho. Maybe 3-4 a year
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
~~only took 5 seasons~~
<:MeguLurk:898122801641320478>
Wake up darling anyone
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
Probably the show with the most substance
<a:poyospin:852703494401425448>
It was just a fantasy show which is rare in this isekai world lol
But that's about it
Season 1 was decent for the time
<:MeguLurk:898122801641320478>
Is monogatari urban fantasy
People wanted to know what's a fantasy show without worry about the isekai tropw
Usually have game mechanics of some sort
But most 2010+ isekai are fairly similar in tone or mechanics
<:prinnythink:851513073122017341>
Why is it called a reverse isekai when isekais are traveling from one world to another
It's not a pure fantasy
That's all u need
If it's labeled isekai you know it's traveling to another world.
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
I also personally define isekai trope as people who don't want to go back to their own world. Since like pre 2010s animes get lumped in cause of technicality but shit I don't want my digimon associating with isekai genre animes
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
Don't ruin fantasy with isekai
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
I wouldn't argue it should be apart of it. Let another genre have a bad show
Has all the isekai staples
It basically is
Pure fantasy
Nope
This current season is pretty mid for new shows. Like 3 really good shows and that's about it
Guess I'll look at next season now that millhi has brought it up
I look at next season usually when the current season is like 1 or 2 weeks away from done lol
I go into most seasons blind af
I literally don't look at future seasons.
<a:nut:871870510760337469>
It is??
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
Sounds like most builds in rpgs
Cause that would make s1 shit cause all the big pay offs are in s2
I refuse to call the split cour s1 as two seasons like the company wants
<a:nut:871870510760337469>
S2 hurry up
Im ready
More bookworm when
Bookworm is easily an isekai cause mc uses her knowledge quite extensively there
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
I mean isekai are like 80% likely to be trash or average at best
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
I said to not let isekai as a whole ruin fantasy
Nah I said let fantasy have it
<:MeguLurk:898122801641320478>
Like a movie
<:SmugMokou2:893685383093698620>
Ovas aren't a s2 tho
There's only one season
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
It's source is a light novel
Like if I'm told an aniem is an isekai. I can expect world travel. And usually the following. Mc has special powers or a unique gimmick only they have. Can see video game esque menus normal people can't. A bevy of girls wanting the mc dick with little effort
<a:poyospin:852703494401425448>
People are stubborn
Yea but bisque doll is high quality
Only 4 chapters? Rip
I'm interested
<:MeguLurk:898122801641320478>
<a:nut:871870510760337469>
God knows I'm not skipping that one
I've been so busy with work and any free time is going to arceus. My anime is all behind outside of wake up darling
<a:poyospin:852703494401425448>
Oh. Spoilers rip
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
I like cue. I'm only on ep 4 but it's cute. And I like the MC gets shafted on multiple occasions
I'll give everything a try. But man nothing really is jumping out at me for next season.
Same
I don't understand how ikki tousen animes exist
<:botanlaugh:934480552868868126>
Kyoukai senki part 2... cause so many people enjoyed part 1
Sameeee
I'll give it a go
I like the designs
Oh snap new yugioh next season
<:prinnydead:865323948489179167>
The main cast is so boring tho
<:pekosmug:775313544908505128>
Best girls
I like the twins and miku.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Why do we have not one but two shows with the word healer in its name next season
Stop millhi. It's already dead
Ah I liked those shows
I don't know anything 3HZ has done
Girl put too many points into insulting skills and knight has to deal with her
The healer anime has such a bad synopsis
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
I'm scared for anything with the word heal in its name
It's one of the only shows I push the dub for. Otherwise I'm hard sub lol
<a:aigismoney:859106437673123860>
Card captors is so good.  Especially og dub
Both boys and girls
But bakarina I'd top tier harem
I would not classify bunny girl as a harem at all
Mushoku tensei is the only harem I enjoy and that hasn't even gotten to that point lol
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
Harem make anime worse for me. Also the incest
<a:nut:871870510760337469>
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
Don't forget the slayers. That has an mc girl who does magic
She's the best
Don't forget Beeg girl
You're in for a treat
S4 hype
Dude it was so good
<a:nut:871870510760337469>

I said old
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
<:MeguLurk:898122801641320478>
Watch new old shows u never watched instead
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
Featuring vtuber calliope
Oh snap overlord s4
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
At least the flashbacks weren't to previously seen episodes or even scenes in the same exact episode
Cause good movies will always trump animes in animation
I can accept that
Bro fuck demon slayer for getting best animation. It's cheating and using movie budget
Best boi better be horimiya
The meme is dead
Fuck
Did he win protagonist too?
I swear if jjk won aoty again ima rage
Next break I'll look at the winners
Heike is a very slow anime so I understand if people didn't give it a shot.
There's a difference between not liking something and also saying it deserves nothing
Don't be a hater. It's beautiful had great fights scenes and many emotional moments that can hit u like a truck
Haven't looked yet but the fact mushoku wasn't even a nominee for aoty is crininal
I can't remember the last time I saw a slime in a game outside of dragon quest
No thats goblins
<:MeguLurk:898122801641320478>
<:pekosmug:775313544908505128>
Any wolves?
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
And now the joke is dead
Itsca joke on looks
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
The pink haired ponytail girl in the image
I refer to the image I posted
Bruh
What's KA
But u can't beat that VA
I hated the voice dub. It's so wildly different from the elegant but deranged jp version
Lol skate the infinity
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Like what
Someone fill me in on wep studio stuff
What the heck happened at wep studio
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
I feel like most fights were. Ai is punching bag until she figures out how to win
Poor wonder egg. Everyone tells me how bad it got at the end but I never got to that point
What's tropre 29
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
But it did! The last one at least
Fucking christ
But no give two to jjk
Especially the last one
<:prinnydead:865323948489179167>
Mushoku tensei had multiple hype fights
Why u hurt me
<:pekostare:775313599379800067>
Rigged
Why isn't one piece nominated for aoty
SEASON 4 WHEN
Where's Eva nominations
As soon as glory of losers is animated
Ans pilots the exia repair V
His scar is now els silver
Yea the books after the movie. The els save his life
~~He does~~
Don't forget he was being forcefully evolved thanks to double gm particle radiation before the merger
By the end of the movie he becomes something we can't even imagine lol
Setsunq
The games are just poop
Hey I love the chars
I knew you'd like her
<:snekwoah:854100552773533757>
Whe also does a ton of Kamen rider songs
It just aged really poorly
I also hate the gundamu song lol
She sadly didn't do any of the stardust songs buy give her other stuff a look. Zeta gundam op is good as well
I was shocked
It's so good
https://youtu.be/Hewqi59e5js <@87512939107450880> <@222517038042710017>
Let's goooooioooo
All the fry family centric episodes are the best of futuramq
Fuck man
You even have fry walk past him and neither notice each other in the Simpsons crossover
Let Seymour be fucking happy with fry you bastards
A lot of chars got their endings. Like zoidberg
I don't know what else they could explore tho.
I wouldn't mind that. Cause then we would have younger Leela and fry actually in a relationship
There's literally no leeway
Time looping
That was like THE definite ending
I'm concerned how they're going to get around the final ending
It's had 4 endings
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
Still cracks me up that ribbons says ah yes the most appropriate gundam for me if u ever stick him in the God gundam from g gundam
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
Inb4 witch is secretly more gundam build fighters
All that build up for a shit fight
God I remember s2 of ibo and like 4/5ths of the way done and thinking. Man are they really not doing anything with the char clone?
It's almost as bad as that dude in ibo with the vidar
Forreallll what a waste of a char
<a:poyospin:852703494401425448>
All I know is Graham is the reason humans still live. What a beast
<:pekosmug:775313544908505128>
Train
Fair
<:prinnythink:851513073122017341>
Ah
Which makes me wonder how something assaulting them doesn't have some sort of sentience
Speaking of els. I'm slightly confused why they stopped attacking. The movie has setsuna use quantum burst/veda to take in the torrent of information. But what did we give them in response?
Just pretend they're dodo birds
They don't look like people. It's fineeeeee
<@87512939107450880> you liked the movie right?
Or at least the first movie is
Hathaway was good wasn't it?
What's your prediction
You think the witch gundam anime will be good?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Remember when Bandai couldn't do anything with ibo. The thing they created cause of the TV channel having the rights to it for years
Not worth watching then
What's wrong with bender
jesus that small novel post millhi
I saw that video lol
Lacus has the cutest heat endo!
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Graham goes Graham finger! In the God gundam in the sd gundam games
~~Trainwrecks are more entertaining~~
I know there's ps2 games that look better than gibiate lol
Actually I feel like that's mean to ps2 games
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
I mean if you're nostalgic for ps2 graphics
Watch bookworm
She's not even best girl in her own show
Are u serious?
<@152896851660505088> I totally forgot to look at the awards yesterday. But someone posted the fucking jjk girl as best girl
I feel like you're baiting me
<:tamawut:875118884787736657>
What's that
Holy fuck multiple beautiful shots of akebi already
2 mins into ep 5.
<a:aigismoney:859106437673123860>
<@278860841485598720> episode 4 of akebi done. Why is this show so fucking pretty.  And another girl falls to akebi charm
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
~~Clear card saga~~
But I don't think it's like takt op where it was made specifically to sell a mobile game
I have no clue. I know it got one
If we ever get a s2 I wonder if it will delve more into the monster aspect. Since that was always mentioned but never really done anything with
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
Like bro why this cute show so good at scary atomosphere
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
It's horror was better than full horror animes
I really liked that one
<:MeguLurk:898122801641320478>
Sorry ash. If u liked selection project. Can I guess u watched lapis relights from last year?
I could always be wrong
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Unless is magically goes up in quality after the first 2-3 episodes I'm gonna X to doubt that
Akebi, wake up darling and bisco are the only shows I look forward to every week.  I enjoy watching leadale and cue. And passively watch the isekai shows.
<:pekosmug:775313544908505128>
And boob sweat
Much better than selection project
Yea its decent.
Best water hand washing animation I've seen tho
<@278860841485598720> akebi episode 5. The most boring episode by far. Having the bubbly center of attention girl hide away and be as quiet as possible. Was such a poor decision
Whelp no Futurama for me then
Wait not fun. It was pain
Well that was fun to look at
Over maid dragon s2?
<:prinnythink:851513073122017341>
I haven't watched komi san but was it really best comedy worthy
She carried that show
Aoi yuuki not winning best va. Disgustang
Give that to wonder egg or odd taxi
Best character design jjk... they all wear uniforms. Bruh
Yes
oh nice
i think its too new for figures lol
what does your wallet have to do with this
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
how is that a mistake
i should change too
<a:FaunaUUU2:885953033186463754>

i see u changed
millhi
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
bruh the next episode title
fuck i love this girl
<@!152896851660505088> <@!171395487247630336> HOW DOES MARIN KEEP GETTING BETTER
the recurring gag of the MC dashing towards someone in a blink of a second was the best joke to me
i agree with the similar vibe. i did enjoy average abilities more
its one of those shows where i question why it was an isekai to begin with
we def have different tastes so its fine lol. i wouldve never finished it if it wasnt for aria group watching it
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i havent but the anime is boring af
god and theres still 4 more girls who havent gotten screen time yet
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
i understand its a large cast. but i really only care about the MC and blue ponytail girl
<:asagicringe:851512873985507378>
<@!278860841485598720> so episode 6 of cue. ||did we really waste an entire episode on a cat a girl knew for 3-4 days and acted like it was the end of the world||
millhi about to say " just do both
<:FaunaSip:885952932078579732>
imagine buying boxsets and not doujins of your fav animes
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

FUCK ITS SO GOOD
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>

<a:ChrisRage:745358256242688102>
i need the daki now!
link me
<a:FaunaUUU2:885953033186463754>

~~doesnt totally own 4 testarossa figures~~
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
testarossa is better
So I can switch gears huh
Top 10?
<:excism:852274672553033788>
What yall looking at
<:excism:852274672553033788>
How do I get to the section yall are looking at to see stuff
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
Can't wait for s4
75 episodes of goodness
Top tier show
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
The movie is
<:excism:852274672553033788>


Taking what I said literally. I meant I've seen over 30 studios so of course I have a full list
What would I even get out of that
No?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But they don't have 10/10 shows I rated
Well I have over 30 studios here
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
Oh I've seen enough. This is just average rating
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
Gotta love the studios I've only seen one show for being the top rated studios on my list
Same
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
<@171395487247630336> u ready for 18 days of pure mecha?
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
Of course the gundam studio is top
Really not surprised at my top studio. But I didn't even consider it lmao
Lmao u fucker
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Now I'm sad af
Why did they have to remind me of made in abyss
Probably
Or borh
Either a red head or a busty woman
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
I swear she's type casted so hard
Aoi yuuki is 8
<:excism:852274672553033788>
Nana Mizuki isn't even in my top 20. Huh
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>

<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Yui horie best girl
Whelp back to work. Ttyl
It's surprised at me lowest stuff
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
It's funny scifi and mecha are also at the bottom while romance and sol are at the top. The exact opposite of what you'd expect after talking to me for awhile
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
Damn horror beat ecchi for worst rated shows
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That's the movie art
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
one piece
I definitely enjoyed that more than any other full 3d shows in recent memory
It helped the cgi in shikizakura was leaning towards anime cell shading in a way too
<@152896851660505088> I can't wait to be like. This anime is shit! Read the manga instead
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
Imagine reading
<:tamasad:852752879026831390>
Bunch of judgey dum dums
<:excism:852274672553033788>
The amount of people I've had to convince to try bisque is staggering
<a:ShirabeBonk:801207951645605958>
Watch it!
It's the best show of this season
i liked kai, i just miss the original kid gohan voice
Just shill and buy actual horse girls merch
Moon gundam still best hg to date
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm cool with that.  Or the big younger sister
<a:ShirabeBonk:801207951645605958>
Yes
U know what I mean
VNs and manga are the closest you'll ever see me reading am actual book
I'd the manga good?
Gross
Is classroom of the elite a vn adaptation or manga
<:excism:852274672553033788>
Fantastic booba
She's top tier too
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
Dammit
Is muv luv still getting a s2
Like that otome game one
Nah it only be for dissapointments
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
For shows now
I wuv it
I hope it gets a s2.
Hell yea it is lol
It was at 3.5 million before the anime
<@171395487247630336>
And they love it
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
Insiders also say it is
I thought Jojo was the most gay anime ever made
Or Roy mustang
<a:aigismoney:859106437673123860>
And lock on Stratos for sword
Eris from mushoku tensei. That's perfect for fran
🎣
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
i thought it was just a gacha game
theres an anime?
It's called like lvl 9999 gacha skill or something
I'm trying to find this dumb manga I enjoyed reading but it's not on mangadex
I'm really outside of my element here
Using this tachiyomi. I dunno what other extensions to grab outside of mangadex
I'll mark that down
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>

Oh one villainess copy cat I liked was...
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
Like in another world with my smartphone.  Oh boy what a twist
I feel like they're getting better cause u need to stand out and have a reason for people to keep coming back and not just a gimmick
<:excism:852274672553033788>
I mean she's the MC of the manga so I'd say yes. I hope
Like she looks like a side char
<@171395487247630336> I guess my main issue is she looks kinda generic af in the anime version
There's so much improvement with this artist since vol 1

My brain only remembers the most recent cover
I guess she looks similar to her Volume 1 cover
<:excism:852274672553033788>
But shit do all isekai animes never get close to the source material
At least it looks better than otome game
She's too white
<@171395487247630336> I don't know how I feel about anime fran
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
You're gonna feel good
<:MeguLurk:898122801641320478>
Link  me
Disgustang
Dafuck is thus
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
Sounds like anime to manga
I need pictures or it won't keep my attention
Rip
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
Oh it's not a manga?
<:MeguLurk:898122801641320478>
Got a link I could read it?
Why did phones have hashtag buttons before Twitter existed
<@171395487247630336> I forgot to say thank you for finding it on mangadex for me
Memory overload
<:excism:852274672553033788>
I feel like it wasn't this bad looking rho
Maybe I've just input so much manga I'm misremembering
<:prinnythink:851513073122017341>
I dunno if it's me but I feel like this art looks worse from what I remember reading a month or so ago
Jesus these names are stupid
Ah I didn't recognize it cause the 9999 isn't in the name before u click on it lmao
I wanted to add it to the tachiyomi app but no clue what extensions I should download to try
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
Is it time to snipe?
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
That's the most self absorbed poster I've ever seen
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
You're several feet behind
Kare kano was great
Fruit of evolution is a yikes. Unless the books are a billion times better than the anime
Good. We need less streaming services. It was so nice when everything was just on netflix
Reminds me of the goblin slayer movie where the first 30 minutes are just the recap of the anime
What's wakanim. I've never heard of it until today
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
I hope this sells and it alters so much that Zeta gundam and ZZ gundam become completely different beasts
It's been forever and a half since I saw that original event
He has that but I don't think it helped against a beam Saber. Or maybe it was that ship exploding on it that ruined the I field
Mass produced

When does this come out
I need answers
Is she a weeb and knows gundam. Or a complete normie office worker
I'm super curious on what she ends up changing
I'll read this book
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm offended I wasn't the first @
I like the mecha from it
<:MeguLurk:898122801641320478>
Wait what's wrong with seed astray
I'm honestly surprised they didn't push code geass knightmare frames harder with model kits
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
To be fair most mecha come from sunrise to begin with. Of course they want another gindam situation to make money off of
~~isn't that just all anime nowadays~~
The units being attached to dispatch missions and not an actual mission was pretty lame tho
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Or get the expansion for the units and never touch inferno
I didn't mind crossrays but I Def enjoyed genesis more
Hanayo.. is that the Catgirl robot? I remember using her in crossrays
I got to enjoy gekkou thanks to cross Rays. That was neat
Hi Derek. Welcome to the insanity

<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
Wait Lowe protected Kira from that impossible explosion?
Wasn't that cause they were unfinished or prototypes? All zaft wanted was the completed op things they knew were there
I was not a fan of this. At all
M3: Sono Kuroki Hagane
I gotta go find the name of the mecha I really didn't enjoy. It was so weird and the thing chars did hurt my brain
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
So it's just destiny again
I hope the new gundam game is good
Nooo I. Need just one pc uc to play
<:MeguLurk:898122801641320478>
Is there an announcement yet for the next g gen I feel like it's been 3 years
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
I like playing the uc games and fighting with all the weird msv mechs

<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

ofc
<a:FaunaUUU2:885953033186463754>
<@!171395487247630336> fucking hell.  just cant handle this show. the end with both girls fangirl freaking out. my heart cant take it
I dint wanna live anymore
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>

Translating 50 episodes can't be cheap
what i really wanna know is the sales of Super Sentai stuff in the west. im so curious on what thats like
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
thats enough time for me to be able to buy it if i wanted
maybe they want breathing room between seasons so the fans who like it have the money to buy every season as it comes out
i wonder how much symphogear was
with all the random old obscure stuff they do. i wonder how much they need to sell to make it worth while
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I mean the store next to it is go for a walk

so my brain never really connected the dots. but Gundam build fighters is an isekai.... <@!87512939107450880> <@!152896851660505088>
Fucking dastards
Better than another animes we have seen not too long ago
Oh forreal? That could be fun
Didn't why just get a spy romance show
Say what
I agree. I'm mainly just watching dress up darling lol
~~looks at akebi~~
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
~~looks at marin~~
<:pekocry:775313612449382440>
ninym is great shes a cutie! i still dont like the MC tho. he's too perfect in what he does but also complains like a bitch baby
I'll gladly buy all their stuff when it's half off or less
<:prinnythink:851513073122017341>
Wait people die in zexal?
and people actually pay him for stuff
like its so bad
yea and his art style somehow got worse?
i remember how he almost had a good youtuber career yet fucked it up cause he sucks ass
<:prinnythink:851513073122017341>
Chris from symphogear? I'm interested. Depends on the art
Nice I'll take a look next break
Idol culture
Or shooting the gravitational belt on the floating castle so it falls onto all the monsters killing them
God i loved all the dumb shit on duelist kingdom
Remember how his lightning attack got stronger cause yugi made the opposing moth monster wet from rain?
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
I mean turn 2 summoned skull was still op back then
U mean I can't just summon blue eyes and win?
<:excism:852274672553033788>
That makes sense
That was cool
Oh yeaaa I remember dice
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
I wish I had more time to try out any yugioh past 5Ds
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
Lol I feel like when people think og yugioh. They think the first big arc on Pegasus Island. And then jumping to battle city
I vaguely remember a princess mokuba
Yu yu hakusho is God tier to me but most people agree to stop watching it after the black arc lol
I can understand that.
I mean I love og yugioh as a whole its so meme tier. I just genuinely love all of it

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I wanna do this tiermaker
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I wonder if they fixed the cg
<a:poyospin:852703494401425448>
Mitsuru has such a good dub voice
The kings game Is the best episode of the show
The dub is great
i wanna play an sd gundam game but im already playing like 4 games
i dunno what isekai garbage kadokawa owns. but if date alive ever joined. i would stop watching so fast
<:pekocry:775313612449382440>
make it slime anyways
i dunno anything anymore
i thought it was
most say Slime
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
too bad i dont like most key animes
im sad cautious hero isnt in that promo
i thought it was just getting a s3
wait what
i wouldnt say its BAD. its got its fun moments. it def couldve been more entertaining tho. i feel like they just need to cram more animes into it since the og 4 are getting kinda stale
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
i dont even like shield hero and id rather watch that over overlord
rezero at least has ram for funnies in the quartet and the chars bounce off of konosuba easily. ains squad is just boring. with the only notable part being Kazuma asking Snu snu dreams of albedo
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
nah ima just skip it. and just deal with them being in isekai quartet. the weakest of the 4 isekai
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
I think my tolerance for hearing SASUGA AINS SAMA. Is at its limit too
S3 also really showcased how not a good person ains is. He at least brought back the lizard people but I don't think he will for the adventuring group
<@87512939107450880>
<:excism:852274672553033788>
Probably cause the big fights we're usually with humans or at least in s1 case a decayed dragon so shoddy cg was fine. But then u get the abominations in 3 as the climax along with the most flaccid fight with ains and that hero dude. It's hard to ignore
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
like right now
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I told him to watch the samurai X movie. And ghost in the shell. And psychopass
Even if the show is bad. It applies to what he wanted lol
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Seen it. But good suggestion

As long as u don't want more date a live. You're good to me
I honestly have no idea
Also bofuri s2

<:pekosmug:775313544908505128>
Gundam unicorn/gundam the origin?
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
Apparently there's about 6 episodes of content roughly left. Just enough for a movie. So it'll go attack on titan the final movie
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Final season part 3
<a:APetForMiku:752996320259604592>
if its good yea, i love the world building in say slime or bookworm or mushoku tensei
<:pepe_clown:852146270553899038>
doesnt mean he's good at it

i dropped everything this season outside of akebi and dress up
sadge
forreal?
yea there wasnt really much of a baseline goal
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
its was just so slooow
was it worth it
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
<@!171395487247630336> <@!152896851660505088> here's my watch list for next season
it had many shitty episodes
im glad megaton got better. i was really uninterested in the first 3-4 eps
i think im just gonna skip next season
for some reason yea
<:pekocry:775313612449382440>
i was about to say whats that otomega generic looking ass isekai anime and then i realized its that one manga i liked thats getting butchered probably
thats what im doing right now
~~imagine watching anime~~
especially starting out
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
i feel like a lot of the older SD gen games arent friendly when it comes to probabilities lol
<:pepe_clown:852146270553899038>
probably way chapter than an i field too lmao
its a cool idea for a freebie hit
anti beam coat right?
like im itching to play one
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
i just want more mecha games in my life
very true
it worked out for the last two SD G gen games at least
what if they just go full 3d models
ps2 OG was so good
<:pekocry:775313612449382440>
oh like everyone bought that but then doesnt buy the next one?
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
after how much of a hit 30th was i was hoping they would try that next
you think we will ever get a multiple game series like Z or @ any time soon melua?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
its cool she learned how to Akashic Buster tho
thats a really cool dynamic kill
wow
oh
im watching it right now llol
i still love that insane distance melee attack
oh forreal?
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
was the Z series where they butchered Aquarion?
yea youre righte z2 and z3
did they ever get added into srw? i feel like i saw them once
thanks
had a pink haird MC
what was the last one made of the dancouga series? i never watched it but i remebmer liking the OP a lot
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
why did they change her hair color from cyan to dark blue
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ima pick Leona then whenever i get around to it
okay
do they get specific mechs
which MC would you pick for alpha 1
like getting the full Alpha plot would be dope
older srw games sound wild
man i need to learn japanese faster to enjoy these older games
thats super fascinating
if she was playable at all
maybe she just had a gespenst or something
with no excellen lol
im trying to imagine who he talks to
interesting
its kinda blowing my mind imagining all of compact 2-1 with only kyosuke and not his quirky partner by his side
standard srw size?
how long are the compact parts on their own
wait theyre seperate protags?
when do Kyosuke and Excellen start existing?
man i always thought he was the main protag of Alpha 1
wait was ryusei never an MC of any srw until OG?
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
leona garstein i would not have expected as an MC of alpha with how little of a role she plays in OG series overall
thats trippy af lol
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
wait alpha 1 has 8 protagonists?
ah
in alpha 1?
zengar as a protag still trips me out cause i always saw him as just a mentor
damn thats wild. who are my other options?
<:pekocry:775313612449382440>
howcome
time to go download all the ps2 sd gen games and srw
<a:FaunaUUU2:885953033186463754>
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Is it cause it's just the first half again With worse characters than L?
~~Kamen rider decade~~
King dedede should sue
Overpriced merch? Bandai
Disappointment? Bandai
Namco
I don't need anymore than that
I save the suffering for rezero. Then it's out of my system
Can I have magical girl shows like Cardcaptor and sailormoon again? I miss when they weren't all depression
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
watching a video of people drawing their favorite husbandos and the rest have to guess. first guy draws kira yamato lmao <@!99695384296701952> <@!87512939107450880> starting off great
<:pekosmug:775313544908505128>
For now
<:pekosmug:775313544908505128>
Blu ray super
~~I'm Judy joking don't kill me~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ruby bad
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
I see 6 overlapping shows
Oh yea gargantia. Gatchaman crowds and my mental choices are affecting my romantic comedy
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
Great year for me
2013 was gunpla build fighters, magi, chihaya s2, log horizon. AoT, golden time, mushibugyo, devil is apart timer, maoyu, valvrave, yowamushi pedal, unlimited psychic Squad.
Jesus
Last year had 32 shows I enjoyed.
If memory serves me right
2018 was also a good year. The three best years imo are 2021, 2018 and 2013
It's prob why I'm so burnt out from anime. Last year was wild
<a:APetForMiku:752996320259604592>
So many good things
86, slime s2, hormiya, Tokyo revengers, vinyl, mushoku tensei, blue period, odd taxi, to your eternity, mieruko chan, skate, assassin isekai, higehiro, tomozaki kun, iruma s2, tsukimichi
I think last year is a contender for like the best singular year of anime
Assuming 3 years means 2020 up to now
But yea 3 years is a large pool of animes
I assume 1 season yea lol
I also don't remember the two year prior lol
Last 3 years? Mushoku tensei easy.
The biggest waste of time in my anime careeer
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
Mine

<@278860841485598720> what's your lowest rated show
Wrong month lop
Ah
That's a thing alright. I thought it was about a piano kid or something
I've Def heard the English name before. No idea what it is tho
I tend to not know Japanese names of shows
I've not heard of 3 gatsu no lion.
Ohhhh maquia! That was a good movie. I didn't know it's long ass name
I don't know tsuki or the lion show. Never heard of either
It's mainly older stuff I watched as a dumb teen or kid that in hindsight were really bad shows
I don't finish shows I don't like so a large portion of my list is above a 5
Same lmao.
So even 6s are shows I liked but don't put much stock in
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I use the actual full scale
Anything above a 5 isn't bad in my book. 5 is average. Anything below 5 is actually bad
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
Ya like what ya like.
Ah lmao
What? Dry first few episodes? Lol
I think I gave steins gate a 9 or 9.5 cause those beginning first few episodes are really fucking dry on a rewatch
Are all my 10s
Yuyu, bookworm, kono oto tomare, made in abyss movie, chihayafuru s3, gundam build fighters, princess mononoke, iruma s2, bunnygirl senpai movie, smile down the runway.
I'm very picky with my 10/10s so I doubt they'd ever bump down
But then I'll rewatch the xmen animated cartoon and question why I ever liked this piece of garbage writing
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
Like I can rewatch yu yu hakusho any day of the week and that'll never lower my 10/10 rating
Or man this isn't as good as I remember and lower it
Usually I'll rewatch and be like yea that score is right.
I'm trying to think of a show if any I a raised
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
I lowered all of symphogear on rewatch
That I missed first time thru
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Or I notice plot holws
<:excism:852274672553033788>
Like I'm way more critical
I feel like I always rate shows lower on a rewatch lol
The three penguins doing random shit is probably the best part for me
I'm very mixed on penguindrum. There's lots of parts I like but also lots of parts I just stare in confusion
Probably why I'm not fond of that year
But man its bogged down by a lot of bad shows I watched. Like infinite Stratos, aria the scarlet bullet, freezing, astarottes toy, Deadman wonderland, is this a zombie?
Would probably make the year a bit better
Ah I still haven't watched kaiji or tiger and bunny
2011 was Def a weak year for me. Anohana, chihaya and steins gate were the only highlights for me
I don't remember what 2011 was like. Brb
I just hope the movie or whatever is good
I was about to retread the discussion of gridman but you me and melua have gone at lengths of that show and dyna already lol
Shhh
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'd argue it's little witch academia. Or Gurren.
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
But different strokes for different folks
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
Kill la kill was at a scale of 11 right out the gate
It's too over the top for me. I prefer grounded shows or at least ramp up to the crazy. Like with Gurren laggan
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
~~I wouldn't know. I dropped it like ep 6~~
I prefer to just have serious animes have a line that ended up being way funnier than it ever should've been. Over pure comedy shows
Lots of people love daily lives of high-school boys but I don't see why
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Most comedy animes tend to be misses since different cultures
I always wanna say yunyun is great but damn she didn't even exist in s1
<:excism:852274672553033788>
It made average comedy show even worse
I was also coming off the high of hinamatsuri. An actually good comedy show
An episode? Bro the only time it made me laugh was aqua in a cage with alligators
Welcome to most comedy animes
Konosuba was fine for it's time but it's really not needed anymore
I prefer s1 rezero to s2
I dunno. I feel like every genre has at least something for someone
 No need to write it off completely
<:botangun:934480342889418772>
I'm about to put u to sleep
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
But why slime
I struggle with anything fate too
Fair
<:pekosmug:775313544908505128>
Nah that's Marin from dress up. She's the ultimate male fantasy
I've never watched zero but I've only ever heard good thijgs
Random
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I agree with a good portion of your dislike list. Except for slime. That hurts to see. Also surprised at fate zero chilling there
I still don't get the hype for promare
Same. They're more fashion over function.
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
Gotcha
What are all these parts referring to?
gonna watch all the preview trailers to see what interests me
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
After all the quality animation the show got. I'd rather just wait for a s2
I've been reading more manga of late than anime lol
But that's all I know
S6 is supposed to be all the league of villians and very dark?
I enjoyed it up to s3 then I stopped caring. That 4th season was Hella uninteresting and I didn't even try s5 past the first ep
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
I'm glad we have mostly moved away from that culture. And now instead just give them breaks.  Like with my hero. Imagine all the filler seasons of that if ran like naruto
If it was like bleach and you get one every now and again. That'd be fine
I think it's more. There's just too many filler arcs
~~I would not agree on that but hey~~
Of course
Vampire arc was cool had some nice characters development for ichigo friends
Eh I feel that's extreme
I think all the bleach filler arcs are entertaining. I just hate when they have to do filler for 1-4 episodes at a time and make it all about the worst char in the show kon
Well when you're done cleaning. Go watch
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
Go for it!
I also enjoy the cast. Gives me good old rave master vibes
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I'm anime only
Also space travel allowing for many cool planets and locales
I had so much fun with it. It also knows how to be quite dark and serious among the silly fun
Eden zero is legit. I loved it can't wait for s2
you want episode 4? PAY UP
yea hook the person to pay for a sub
sorry im clueless. whats going on with this subscription talk

should be viable planet wide in about 1000 years
why does this otome anime have such good VAs
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
ATHURUUUUNNNN
i really like the manga cause the MC just wants to shit on all the Love interests the the MC girl shoul d be having but doesnt (cause of reasons)
the best girl of the books
phanta is goign thru all the big chars to see who their VAs have done
Ange is a char from the isekai anime i posted
~~dont listen to me~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Cross Ange
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
but how can people converse if opinions never stated
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so was i after that sentance i posted
it blows my mind how we are getting an ikki tousen anime in the year 2022
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
also its not good
but nobody cares to watch ti
kyoukai senki was supposed to be the thing that brings back 2d mecha
and theyre fucking beautiful
those are all drawn in 4k
like the thunderbolt movies
they still do hand drawn for stuff
im glad u posted an emote cause i was like. who the fuck is else in symphogear
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
elsa... from frozen?
wait is there literally an anos voldigoad ripoff anime this season?
Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games Is Tough for Mobs
its watchable now at least
mecha shows usually do 3d now instead of 2d. and people want 2d. and then this one otome isekai that happened ot have mechas in it (not the main point of the show) has 2d mechas
whatsd to not get?
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
honestly the PV makes me hype. the MC got a good voice and he gets some shit eating grin faces
i was expecting CG garbage mechs
this one
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<@!171395487247630336> <@!132019566497890304> wait the otome isekai has 2d mechs. mecha shows cant even get 2d mechs
healer girl, 3 oni girl show. i forgot the name of the last one but including nijigasaki theres 4 idol related shows
i can only imagine 3 having the villian be Metal Sonic or Shadow
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Omega and Biggs too

if anything it helps me like shinn more

i feel like athrun was done dirty. he was technically the better pilot at one point but always gets shafted
<:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>

<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
what about julius hot mom. whos her VA
For a second I thought I misclicked a video when I heard the bois talking
Holy shit I just got a bookwalker ad using trash taste on youtube
i love when a monthly manga gives chapters with 40 pages instead of 12
i just remember seeing a random page lol
arent they kinda setting up a romance plot with the blonde girl and chika in the manga atm?
i didnt really jive with the chars personally. Chika was the only one i really enjoyed
<:pepe_clown:852146270553899038>
i mean ill just ad it to the pile of my 40 other mangas i wait for one chapter a month for
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
the manga doesnt use CG
thats fine
my brother didnt like it and i never pursued it past when we dropped it together lol
the skeleton knight did what goblin slayer did and randomly makes the MC CG when he's doing basic movements and im NOT dealing with that shit again. ill go read the manga
nope. i never really got into kaguya and the revenge hook from shield hero is gone so it has no reason to be watched anymore imo
first time i dont have double digit shows
<@!132019566497890304> <@!278860841485598720> <@!171395487247630336> my planned shows for next season.
man this healer elf anime looks boring as f
That's Def an enemy suit. I'm curious how many gundams will exist if they've already shown us two of them. Or if this one has form changes (maybe using magic?)
I hope the mech does have heat issues. Gundam seed was like the only gundam where there was draw backs for the mech making it more compelling in a longer fight
I like the design of the mech. The shield especially. Not sure how I feel on the girls design atm tho
Also
Lol ikr?
It was a struggle
I liked Lyle by the very end but I agree
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I still remember the theory crafting back when s1 ended that feldt would take the place of the best sniper in gundam
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
It's okay. My brain goes S1 plot -> movie
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
When haute reveals that third eye and they go op as shit
I also like it. The zabanya and harute are great mechs
Lots of pew pews
00 movie has some great action
Lol that's why I like s2 of gundam 00 more than most. Cause I watched it next to the train wreck of code geass s2
Cheapens that moment in seed
<:excism:852274672553033788>
Bringing back mu was such a stupid thing to do
I honestly barely remember it outside of video games so I can't say lol
So many pointless or frustrating deaths
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
God I hate the second half of ibo.
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Space guts GF was the biggest rip
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
And pilots
Mostly mainline yea.
I just feel like if your on the red color wheel from orange to pink. You're kinda fucked lol
Or sayla
But then u could post girls like roux
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
<@99695384296701952> I meant to write red head women but I derped
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Red head pilots don't have a good track record in gundam
Then swap it to amuro ai
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
The have ribbons ai pilot it
It is. It just has different armaments

I honestly forgot what it originally was colored as. I only remembered the buildifghters color version which is so much better
Looks like a knock off Robotech design
What dafuq is that melua
<a:APetForMiku:752996320259604592>
I'd agree with both of those
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
But that claw shield is so iconic to kyrios. I miss it
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
I like quanta only when it's like his non movie versions like the 7 Saber one. Looks much better
Yea Rapheal is a close second for me
Oh that's movie Tieria mech right?
It's such a boring  "upgrade"
I think I dislike Arios the most
Out of the 12 protag mech designs over the course of both seasons and the movie. Which one do u like the least?
Lmao i could see that
Thank u lol. I only remember arios cause it's basically kyrios
There we go
Sitting here trying to remember the sniper
I can remember all the s1 mechs and half the s2 mechs lol.
Seraphim was the back pack
Ah right
<:prinnythink:851513073122017341>
What was tierias s2 mech even called
With hallelujah nerf and best boi death
Lol there was a moment early in s2 I was like. Wow Tieria is the only good pilot we got atm huh?
Fair
Like it happens so early in s2
Allelujah after he gets back his gf. Kinda just... exists? In s2
Okay
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
TD blanket?
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
I guess my brain always just saw the red drives as always inferior
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I guess so
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
4 gnx could never beat 4 gundams
I mean that's only cause of numbers tho right
Like I realize the exia is missing an arm. But I feel like he should've had no issue bodying everyone in s2 opening
I feel like in 5 years or less whatever the gap was for 00 s1 and s2. They shouldn't have caught up to the s1 mechs with non prototype specialized mechs. Since the gundams were like decade or more advanced in tech
Oh my brain forgot that even existed
I dunno. I might go for one of the jp only titles
<:excism:852274672553033788>
I wanna play a gundam game now
Honestly I just want more cross silhouette sd from the g gen. The Phoenix and sisquiede look so good
I was like UHOH UHOH
Melua I shit my pants in overworld when I did the final break in the stage and my npc allies became enmies
The standard formula and then an smaller og story
Or be like g gen overworld where it had both
I feel like that wouldve be good for cross rays. But not for full UC stuff
Oh the ones that have OG story modes?
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
What's that
Like I did
It's a pain in the beginning. Especially if u try to do a couple stages of each show at a time.
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
Speaking of cross rays. I kinda hate how I basically needed a squad specifically for ibo stages cause of the beam armor coating. Which made gundam seed and most of 00 useless
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I wonder how they make the beam ammo
<:prinnythink:851513073122017341>
I know it's been two decades but did the shot limit ever really come into play? And celestial being had literal forever engine mechs
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
Something anew
Also rip that one innovade that liked Lyle. I liked her
I forgot this was a thing and I love it. Thank u
<a:APetForShirabe:753351050215293020>
shes cute. and does get voiced in games
lol yea wouldve died like Heine
Wasn't she originally supposed to be voiced by someone specific like rie Tanaka? But she said no and they just cut the char entirely cause of it
Yes her
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
The one person in seed who had a good run was the one zaft elite girl who had no lines. Never died. And even got promoted to a white coat in destiny
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
My brain is trying so hard to remember
Thats... Athruns alias right?
Lol yes gotta love lore on the box or manual that would've never existed othrrwise
<:pekosmug:775313544908505128>
Infinite rambles works
I don't usually deep dive into stuff
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
I liked the info
<:prinnythink:851513073122017341>
You guys ever wonder what the show would've been like if the scientist dude didn't die in cold sleep
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Rip
Do people live on jupiter?
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
are there not a lot of fights in victory?
if i remember correctly the Nu saber has a tiny one on the bottom
i assume its cause its impractical but i wonder why the double bladed beamsaber doesnt really exist anywhere else.
ohhh yea thats a neat idea
yea seed is the only place where they do the darth maul thing huh?
woah
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
like when they revealed Cagalli was Kiras sister
u rite
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
im curious why a stab breaks thru but a horizontal slash doesnt. its still the same strength of a hit at the end of the day isnt it since its a beam?
true
also makes me question why nobody else stabs thru the shield in this universe lmao
thats true. did that shield stab happen in the anime? cause honesty that was pretty interesting
so he overplayed?
cause he ran out of energy first?
<:thinkinghat:943102441627480105>
so melua question for u for this fight. does Athrun having to suicide the Aegis make him a better or worse pilot than kira in that fight?
music is great
that fight is so guds
night
yeaaa the seed movies were great
oh the little movie?
of his suits
Aegis is still my favorite
that thing got bodied and thrown away so fast
savior?
what was that one mech called that athrun used for like 2 sorties in destiny
and it somehow didnt explode from that
remember when kira slashed only half of the duel. and for some reason was able to stop mid swipe
oh thats true
like they looked at dearka and was like. nah he doesnt need anything more
i find it curious how Yzaks suit is the only one who gets an upgrade to it (i know its the one with the least stuff to begin with)
actually Yzak is but shes a close second
shes my fav seed char lol
i forgot this rendtion, thank u melua
<a:catJAM:833707372358008884>
also rip my fucking ears that was so loud
ive only seen a single cover of it from a vtuber personally lol
ngl i forgot what the protag of king gainer looked like and man he looks like an isekai protag
the little blue haird girl is so fucking cute lmao
im listening to the op right now
thats a blast from the past
yooooo i remember king gainer. holy shit
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
thats a face alright
*googles fuala*
i remember she was treated pretty well in teh DW gundam game
<:pekocry:775313612449382440>
i used to really like katejina in the g gen games cause i saw cool waifu in orange suit. and then i read what she did in victory gundam
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
exia Dash
<:pekocry:775313612449382440>
i only know all of them die thanks to g gen games
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
rip the entire shrike team
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I thought these were key frames
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
Imagine paying 300 dollars for an in-between frame
For a place that made gambling illegal. People sure love to gamble
U right. I forgot
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Who wants their name on that
As an extra incentive for the fans, those who bought a certain number of cards had their names listed in the credits of the Muv-Luv Alternative Blu-ray Box and the accompanying booklet. The sets shipped in January and March.
<@152896851660505088> is this really an incentive?
<:excism:852274672553033788>
But are they random
Wtf are key frame cardpacks
I dunno if I wanna read this
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Anywhere really
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
Why didn't I art in school years ago
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
This one patreon I follow she does about 5 images a month with some variations and makes like 25-30k a month on just that alone
Poor workers
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
That's a very good point
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
All these animators need to just become patreon/fanbox artists. They'd make more for less images
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
How do people survive
That's literally an unliveable job
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Not even 10k a year?
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
She doesn't even sound sure of it from the way u right it either
Oh really it doesnt? Damn. I just assumed overwork automatically cause of the work culture
Doesnt the beginning of shirobako have an overworked animator who gets sick? I dont remember much else
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
How do they go bigger than galactic size that throws literal galaxies like frisbees
I didn't even know movies existed
Sounds like sunrise stuff lol
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
Throwing my toys at each other
I guess I love build fighters cause as a kid I would play with the toys u could get at target and such and the anime is just that but looks cool
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
So medabots but even smaller
I liked the 3ds game a lot
It's on my list
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
That's fair. U really can't do much else with gunplas tho
<a:APetForMiku:752996320259604592>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Gundam build fighters. If that counts
Stumbles here and there a bit but what show doesnt
Fun mecha show
Gurren is great
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
I'll see myself out
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
You're isn't an key anime
Nah uh
Wut
one of the top 7 isnt even a tv series. just a tv special
after the almost nonstop year of anime we got last year. i kinda dont mind that 2022 is a weak year. i need a breather from having to keep track of a dozen good shows a season
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
mom i wanna watch overlord
we have overlord at home
*shows Gaikotsu kishi-sama*
and to see if my otome manga turns into a trashfire anime or not
bookworm is all i care about
sping has barely anything i care about too.
theres always old stuff to watch lol
like theres some shows that have potential if you scroll farthr down. but all the shows that are top Popularity are very unappealling
did u mean spring? or actually mean summer since we never left the topic lol
which 30-40 shows a season is kinda what to expect nowadays
theres already 30+ shows announced. its just barely any are enticing so it looks like nothing is announced
its fairly sparse yea nazuna but more could get added later
oh 6. i missed shadow house s2
i only see 5 sequels
danmachi season 4 has a 50/50 chance of being decent or sucking
like im sure Devil is a part timer will be fun. but not like a MUST watch
i just need Isekai Meikyuu de Harem wo to be good. but yea man summer atm is incredibly weak atm
code geass is like a car going down the road super well. gets into a car crash and then ends up perfectly parellel parking at the end
i hate R2
~~like most of s2~~
kallen
good mecha action
glad it was at least enjoyable tho
the artstyle/quality was kinda meh to me as well. so i was like ehhhh ill skip this and add it to the pile of mechas that are bad cause im not allowed to have nice things
yea i lost any interest after that lol
was it? i was curious on it cause i dropped it like ep 2
ive got 8 shows in Fall season already. this is great.
Fall has like 15 shows announced and its already better than spring and summer combined for me
gundam, golden kamuy s4, more yowamushi pedal
oh fuck thats emininence?
iruma, inspector, sowrd isekai, and fumetsu
oh yo fall season best season so far
~~remember when people cared about MHA~~
but its just a village boy moving to a big town with a dungeon and he goes into that dungeon to fight monsters
nope. everyone lumps it into an isekai tho cause its almost exactly like one
its a pure fantasy
no lol
<:pekocry:775313612449382440>
i cant tell if hana is just trolling me or actually thinks danmachi is an isekai and likes to set people off
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
now thats a good one
the next isekai
the MC is one of those deadpan low emotion guys
i hate how its popular cause its gonna be boring af
its nice
when u get that season that just has a ton of shows u love. so u have somethiing to enjoy close to every day
its fun from time to time blockio
movie?
and its anime only
especially the bottom one
i keep forgetting the bottom two are technically not isekai
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
only 2 non isekai shows completed
ash confirmed M
how did u complete arifueta.
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
seeing an grizzled old man dwarf enjoy headpats from his mommy is so cute
its cute enough. elf protags are such a rarity and when shes a doting mother to her npc children is super comfy
my winter season
<@!278860841485598720> <@!171395487247630336>
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
barely anything survived winter 2022 for me outside of dress up darling and akebi
i agree
in a year
u have more shows in one season than i do
oh. lmao that was almost my entire year in my post
like normally id try all the isekai trash just cause its dumb fun but now i dont bother
i think im just hella pickier now with less time on my hands
4 overlapping shows. nice lol
eris sounds good as the MC
same. i wasnt excited when u showed me the art of the MC but the actual animation is sick
im so happy iruma is another 20 or so episodes
bottom left will get dropped most likely too cause i just wanna see how discount Anos Voldigoad is
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@!278860841485598720>
so all the anime i plan to watch from spring to fall this year. almost half are from fall with 8 lol
my brain had neueziel vibes. like the upper half actually
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
hey can i copy off your homework? sure but make sure to change it

<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
siegfried was an out of nowhere mobile armor from gundam
close to everything else made sense
gimme the science on how those work
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
they genre shifted so hard
until that point it was a mostly grounded show in mecha capabilities
oh one little thing that urks me about the mecha, ||i hate the wings of light at the end of R2. im sorry how do they shoot lasers and how do u control that at all?||
i think i just prefer the more standard designs of the Lancelot and Gurren
yea the anubis mecha is sick
ahhh
which one is gawain? is that the silly looking transformable one in R2?
s1 mecha designs of both shows are better than s2 imo
<:descoapproves:853012832610549790>
i  think the same way but thats cuase i watched 00 and Code geass side by side and R1 just decimates 00 but man ill take s2 of 00 over CG any day lol
Sunrise sure has difficulty with the second half of their 50 episode shows
and plently would probably say 00 as well
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
kinda like IBO
i feel like code geass couldve gotten away with just being R1 and having a nice bow wrapped on it. but they remembered it needed another 24 eps
<:pekocry:775313612449382440>
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
||shirley done dirty. rolos treated way better than he shouldve been.||
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i dont
also she never gets any comeuppance
||i will forever be irked by a highschool girl making the atomic bomb and having the connections to get it actually made||
i still think Code Geass is a good show mind you
i just felt like R2 was spinning its wheels a lot like it was just R1 again but sillier
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
stuff can make sense and still be bad tho
were the date a bullet movies animated decently? cause the studio doing it has... only not good anime shows unde their belt
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
but u watched s3
<:thinkinghat:943102441627480105>
but how much anime. like half the members watched a single anime or that half of the total viewtime of last year for netflix was anime related
or does she just stay idiot who likes food and the mc
do they ever give tohka char development after s2?
oh and the always tired looking nurse sensei
thats about it for me
i like miku and the twins from s2
<:pekocry:775313612449382440>
but then it got 3 more seasons and some movies
its the bog standard protag with a harem getting 1 season formula
it really blows my mind how much stuff date a live has gotten over the years.
oh a spinoff gotcha
why are the date a bullet anime movies not just called date a live
its almost just CGDCT
ill jump back into cue at some point. i enjoyed the little i watched.
100%
its wild how often that one is popping up
<:descoapproves:853012832610549790>
its just self reincarnation
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
their first anime was komono michi that really not good isekai by konosuba author
the company is called ENGI
oh are these ex JC staff people?
the detective is already dead had decent animation at least..
full dive, date a live s3, uzaki chan
is a huge oof
god the studio for otomege...
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
oh shit otomege is tomorrow
bookworm should be a monday anime
that one pink hair chick people freaking about might be a saturday anime tho
well according to subsplease atm. theres nothing worth watching on saturday outside of digimon and one piece
or is that a poor process to do
should i assume friday animes are subs for saturday for usa? i wanna look at whats airing. i usually just tack on an extra day for subs
i was doing my best to avoid that one yes
i didnt even know she was one until like 18 chapters in when they mentioned it
and probably the least succubus succubus ive ever seen
this succubus is so fucking cute
and how was it
depressing aint it millhi
now i see how they can
i was very curious how they were gonna get away with the manga being like 30-50% sex scenes and the rest dundgeon crawling
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
quality studio
oh shit they also did mieruko chan and dxd s4
thats what my bosses tell me that i do
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<@!171395487247630336> i just realized that Isekai Meikyuu de Harem wo is being adapted by the studio who did interspecies reviewers
except for swordsekai. i really wanna watch that too
im def in the pool of if the manga is good ill just read that over the anime now lol
fuck i gotta watch the anime then
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
is the magna good or is there no manga
<:pepe_clown:852146270553899038>
i dunno why you reminded me of the old power rangers theme song. power rangers... IN SPACE
At least mob otome has good characters
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Don't say that
Great figure
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
I don't remember much about the TV show at all. Except best girl is Klanklan
So it's sorta like code geass movies
Are the movies just compilation movies of the TV show or sequals
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
~~theres an arcade version of every big gacha game~~
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
kancolle x azur lane doujins
poor wording there
sorry a mobile app version. not a mobile browser version
im curious as to why a mobile version of kantai never happened. i feel like a LOT of people were waiting for that
<:pepe_clown:852146270553899038>
i mean when they help any lightnovel isekai trash into anime form. its not exactly a high bar to get over
do people even care about kancolle anymore
they announced that over 3 years ago?
bruh what
the one coming out later this year?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
the director of dramatical murder and uzaki chan is the director of otomege
<:pekocry:775313612449382440>
i dont get what lanks is trying to get across
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
i got rid of an isekai, overlord, yowamushi pedal (cause i realized i didnt watch s4)
lol i figured, you and lanks both have more this one season than i do all year
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
<@!171395487247630336> deleted a few animes from my planning cause realistically i dont care about some things. so now im down to 16 shows for the rest of the year (unless fall gets some cool new announcements)
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
its also one of the few animes that youko hikasa is actually hard to recognize
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
You also just reminded that ep 25 and the movie don't exist in any way to own in the west
Howcome?
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
I wanna say yes. But I need melua to back up my failure of a brain
I wish Randy's last fight lasted a bit longer. It's so gud
That explains so fucking much melua
Or that one fight where half the squad is on a planet fighting and they're getting sniper assistance from literally outerspaxe
Any fight with jiart is 10/10
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Like damn it has better fight choreography than standard fight shows
Speaking of great mecha moments. Why is the mecha combat in majestic prince so top tier melua
Is that invisagirl
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
I just think evol is an alternate universe as to not ruin the best char in og Aquarian retroactively.
Legit I thought reika was the third pilot for a minute there. Lol but now I'm remembering more sirius
I also don't remember a whole lot since it first aired
True. I just don't remember him getting much noteworthy screentime
<:prinnythink:851513073122017341>
Huh. I guess I never classified him as an mc in my head
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Three? My brain can only think of Sylvia and Apollo lol
Gotta love character regression
Oh 100%
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Damn I like silvia
no nuggies for a week
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
you know what happens to wrong pingers
final season final edition? what does that mean

<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
theres a street fighter anime?
yea being a tokusatsu fan makes it very enjoyable
to be fair those PVs made it look hella generic/boring
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Is that even legal
Go slep then
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
I feel like hana is that meme of oh I understand (doesn't understand at all)
Red is how many people are downloading it
Green Is how many people are seeding it
Welcome to the sea hana
~~glitter force~~
But yea people forget it is. Cause it's kinds its own thing.  Feels like an early 2000s anime in 2020s
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Classic isekai setup
I mean he gets taken to the demon world against his will
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
For over 10 years? That's rought buddy
Where u been
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Travel to another world boom that happened a decade or so ago
At 75 eps
That'll be the longest animated isekai when it finishes it won't it?
<a:nut:871870510760337469>
I'm so happy season 3 of iruma is another 25 eps
Seeing as 2 and 3 were only 10-12 eps. I'm gonna assume the same for 4
https://tenor.com/view/big-brain-markiplier-gif-14835823
Can't be cliffhangered if the show doesn't excite u
I remember a buddy of mine torrented pokemon sword and his isp shut his internet off within days
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
And actual pirates
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
Interpol
<@87512939107450880> how u liking ancient magus bride
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Yea he left it seeding for days. I delete that shit the second it's done
how does that even happen
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
wut
whats the battle of karansebes
the manga of it probably isnt awful. ive found a lot of really bad isekai animes are semi decent to good actual mangas
isekai cheat magician is like one of the only trashy isekai i havent read or watched yet
especially top tier katanas
who needs to find waifus when your swords become waifus
https://mangadex.org/title/e86f3c88-c91d-40a4-acbf-afaafedd4690/makenshi-no-maken-niyoru-maken-no-tame-no-harem-life
but theres another manga that already does that
Wut happened
Rip studio
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Dogs koba is closed?
It would be better if the cool beauty just has cute moments she only showed to him
so its me in anime form. got it
i actually have no clue
what kind of show is it ?
still waiting for a Whisper Me a Love Song adaptation
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
im a very petty person
ive also not tried it just cause my buddy would constantly shit on Bisque doll cause it was popular and he was excited for shiki
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
maybe she has two souls and/or personalities in one body. a cute one and a cool one. and they swap a lot.
<:descoapproves:853012832610549790>
i dunno if itll be THAT bad. at least the plot is good compared to dendrogram
Neverending Tomorrow
Next Toilet
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Index goes into gundam Narrative?
<a:poyospin:852703494401425448>
Hype. The only thing im excited for!
Has bookworm dropped yet or is it still a ways away
I miss airmail
Or maybe it won't. Who knows. I didn't expect dress up darling to be a banger every ep
I feel like shiki will lode its luster after a couple eps
This is kinda something I always wanted. Shows isekaing into each other
<@152896851660505088> so I just realized the isekai quartet movie is how they all get isekaid together
Ur gonna die
That's like the first thing I noticed xD
How
that, blood C.
im not a fan of the Extreme blood and murder era that anime went thru at one point
not a fan
oh that anime
like is there a plot at all? or is it just kids going to school and then stuff happens after? cause i quickly got bored of like nagatoro and what not cause of that
<a:NODDERS:844398873480396800>
00 is pretty old now
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's better than I expected at least. more enjoyable than selection project.
<a:APetForMiku:752996320259604592>
I'm only 4 or 5 eps in but I will say when the main girl isn't around. I really don't care lol. Unless it's the cute blonde
Maybe cause too many girls or based off a mobile game.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And it still looks better than a lot of seasonal that come out now
15 years.  Jesus.
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
U so cute
<:PharaBlush:741631423999639673>
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
I still see book in tht title
<:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
No, they're books
<:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
Loris never trolls me so I thought you were giving me a straight answer
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Oh u mean a single novel
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
And how was it
Has anyone read the 86 novels? I'm curious how they are
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
I enjoy you walls. Even if I don't read them
So when does she die
Arc stay. She too cute to go
The worst one
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Oh right the maids
Isn't it just arc route Ciel route and akiha route. With a bad end Satsuki route
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
Arc all the way
Get ufotable to do it
That would be cool if they ever did that
There's a very minimal amount of outliers
Because it's a safe bet to assume any and all VN adaptations are ass
I like robotics notes
But at least she gets hugs
Just wait for the remake
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Yea it's been so long
Ah. I'm trying to remember which one is where the MC ||kills her||
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Isn't akiha's normal end the closest thing to a good ending? At least for the mc
Ciel has a pile bunker
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
Honestly the other route where u have to fight arc feels bad man
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Don't correct my autocorrexting phone cypher. Let it fail on its own
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
I'm down for that. Mugi is the best girl of kon
They have distinct eyebrows
Good book?
It Def has some good idea and some interesting mecha designs. No reason to hate it 100%
It had a lot of plot points I didn't agree with
I love s1. Hate s2
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Or both
That's fair
Wing is probably the one show where it has the most people pilot the MC mechs that aren't the MC
Lots of sides changing. Mech stealing.
Just don't expect much realism. It's like 5 super hero mechs vs grunts constantly. The greatest enemies are the other guys on the same group at times
Amuro is the pilot of sandrock. Tho the dub of wing happened first
It shares some VAs
Or G if you like campy silliness
If end wants to try stuff out of UC. 00, Wing, and IBO s1 are probably the best choices
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Just play sd g gen gundam seed. Easiest way to consume the show
I feel like s2 humbled him with all the loss but it's also a fucking blur to me
Akame ga kill did The same shit
Just let the person live and be happy christ
I will never understand the point of killing a char in the last few minutes
||what's the fucking point of killing orga in the last 2 minutes of the show? I thought they were gonna pull a Gurren laggan and kill him midway to make mikazuki have some growth thanks to the billion of death flags they gave him||
One last complaint tho
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
I'm just bitter at the whole thing. Sorry if all I'm doing is complaining
Fighting/protecting her ideals
What if that was the place they found
So why can't tekkadan place be with the princess?
Better than fighting to the literal.death
Or a majority do
Since ||all the living members join her anyways||
I feel like a peaceful option found by the princess would've been the best way to end it
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Remember when the flauros got to do anything.
I liked hush
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
But why did he have to.
A lot of chars I feel like got introduced in s2 just to die a few eps later or near the finale
Or the guy who was supposed to be Mikazuki rival introduced in s2 ep1. Literally almost nothing is done with that char ||and they kill him in such a dick way||
Like it's 2/3rds thru s2 and I'm thinking are they ever going to do anything with this guy?
The whole thing with Vidar was such a waste
I almost dropped it when ||space guts GF died||
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
I've probably watched build fighters a dozen or so times.
I haven't really rewatched any gundam fully outside of build fighters and 00 once for the movie hype
Yea ibo is a gundam I'll never rewatch
I personally see it as a person unwilling to take any action as her friends die constantly. But hey we all make our own interpretation
Cya end
Also am I the only one who finds the ||space mafia stuff|| boring as all hell? That string of 4-7 episodes in s1 almost made me drop the show
Ibo spoilers ||like what's the point in showing how she has the ability/confidence to get thru things without fighting like the big blockade. And then never have her do anything like that again||
S2 dropped so many things from s1. Mainly the princess relevancy they were building up s1
For me at least
The end portion is good. But the first half to maybe even 2 thirds is a slog
Rerise... it's mid to me. It's much better than divers but man I really feel like they putz around for like half the series
10/10. It's fantastic. It's a shame everything after the og isnt
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
I look forward to the day end watches enough gundam to enjoy gundam build fighters to the fullest
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
I've never used Twitter. I dunno how. I'm a boomer
Bruh
Wait wut
I honestly feel like destiny is a fanfic since Muu is alive. Which is literally impossible
Kira surviving genesis is actually the non death I have the least problem with
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I just like this excuse
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
I blame gundam seed guys wife for keeping Kira alive cause she liked him when he should've died
I still find it funny how they have beam protection armor even after being repaired by current day mechanics. In a world with no beams
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
Like the ground fights are so good. Gimme more of that. Get the fuck out of space
I personally hate how much space battles there are when beam weapons don't exist. This felt like it should've been a ground warfare only show
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
God damn I really don't remember
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Did I just block this from my brain.
Forreal? I REALLY don't remember this
Not 9
Er 6th form
Then why does it exist
Barbatos specifically
When and where is this from
There's like barbatos 9th form
Also where did all these Barbatos forms come from
They totally could
They are?
||nadesico||
Or space lizards from Jupiter attacking mars
Yoooo I'd be down for an Orga's counterattack
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
The first one
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
||He's a big secondary char in build fighters||
Okay I was right
I think I know but I wanna make sure
Which char we talking about.
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Or maybe not. Cause I don't fucking remember barbatos 6th form for 3 episodes
I'm guessing it was a one time scene since my brain lacks that memory
Ah

I love gargantia
How is there even wreckage. Didn't the strike get basically vaporized?

Booba
imagine needing 4 tries. what a scrub, get it on the first try
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
why four? cause it has Four in it and a man named four vagina?
That's actually a really cool use for that logo
No u are
Will literally ||choking a dragon to death|| is definitely one of the more memorable isekai moments in recent history for me
I still enjoyed it. Having an isekai where the MC isn't surrounded by women for his party is nice. I agree on the graphics downgrade tho.

Has harem in a dungeon released yet?
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
That's my new harem genre. I avoid anything that's about imoutos
It's an imouto show. Ima hard doubt on that one
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
Talking my language there

My first thought was Chris broads Journey to mount Fuji series
Already?
Her butt needs more oomf tho
Quality
I guess I'm better off waiting for when skins become figures instead of the default lol
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Looking at some of the older ones they were chilling more towards the 200 dollar range. Man this is quite the price hike
<@152896851660505088> were heavy armament azur lane figures always this expensive? 300 dollars just seems insane to me
<@258455337995075585> I fucking knew u were that emote without even needing to click on it lol
I'll get her other one later
<@171395487247630336> I just wanna buy everything ryza related

<@152896851660505088> figure I'm gonna buy
Also mfc has been down for over and hour when it said that's all it'll take
I'm thinking of selling ones I impulse bought to make room
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
<@152896851660505088> do I buy more figures

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Gottem
Is there still a 3ds section?
It's kinda wild how often musical ~~chairs~~ gundam happens
So many people use the wing gundam and wing zero thru the anime
Right?
Heero and Zechs trade suits
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
This hurts to hear
Sounds amusing
God 360 had powerbricks that u could murder with
I haven't been in a gamestop in like 4? Or so years. I'm kinda curious what they look like now
Nice
Ah cool
Is that a yea... it sounds bad?
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
Yea I feel like the software wouldn't be able to do giant robot shouting

Is she synthetic or an actual voice

The counting is the best part tho
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>

But what about the pre gundam II kits
The lack of a core gundam per armor is still an issue. If i wanted to display them all as a set. You'd have to buy multiples just to make it happen. Or if I just liked one single one with no core gundam. I'm shit out of luck aren't i
3 kits just to have an accurate 1 kit
I remember the long range armor needed one kit for the correct core gundam color and then the earth three for its gun color. Otherwise half the long gun was the wrong color
If I didn't want the earth three and wanted other armors. I'd like to actually be able to build it without having to buy a completely different kit
Like I know all build fighters/divers are a way to sell more model kits but man re rise really felt like it was trying to find a way to squeeze as much money as possible out of fans with its ridiculous releases of the core gundam and its armors
Because I call everything a zaku blaze cause I can't be bothered to remember all the variants
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I was making a joke about it being a show nobody is watching
Sounds like symphogear
<:botanlaugh:934480552868868126>
I fucking need it
<@213645184125239317> <@148466885917147136> <@99695384296701952> holy shit they made a limited run of the MG zaku Blaze
Holy balls the virtue is 120 bucks
And the FAZZ
I still need to buy so many. I got dynanew but not the other two. And I need the zaku blaze and ginn
Have they announced the next MG yet
They might. If we start getting s2 then I'd Def say no lol
Oh 100%. I don't trust anything MG before 2010. While u can find good old stuff like the surprisingly good 1999 guncannon or the 2003 Rx-78-4  and -5. HG I available trust nothing before the 2013 new gundam project standards. And for RG it's Unicorn and Later kits are the ones I trust there. There mightve been 1 or two before unicorn thay were good but that's when they threw away the skeleton 100%
RG... man that had growing pains when they finally dropped the garbage frame they got so good
Thankfully all MG have been bangers for like half a decade lol
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
I'm super into models if u can't tell
Like all the Gundam seed MG share a skeleton and all the recent 00 ones do
They've been making frames that ate used for a bunch of kits so it takes less time to do varianta
But it has gotten a lot better over the past few years.
Tho the variety is shit compared to hg
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
I love beeg
Unless a really cool HG pops up like Penelope
I mean I got out of hg so I'm not too concerned anymore since I mostly do 1/100 scale now
Lol
Yea but it gave lots of great kits. Like gundam fenice, star build and gundam X Mao. Based off my favorite mobilesuits in gundam lol
So many cool HGs
2013 was such an amazing year for gunpla
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
I miss the all gundam project
I liked when they used to be completely new molds like a majority of Fighters kits. We still got them here and there like with the gabaldy rebake or the knight gundam. But man it was much less
I'm still mad about the gp02 trash kit
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
Not like the divers series has a ton of good suits to pick from
I'm sure someone did it tho
I liked thunderbolt. The first movie. It really was able to show the terror of the White Devil
If only the jazz didn't suck ass
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
I know nothing about it outside of hot female main pilot
That never ends
This almost looks like that one guy looking at another girl meme
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
And it keeps it fresh?
<@152896851660505088> how much of that show is actually running
If only we got rid of hibiki dad
I just realized almost the entire cast has no parents
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
What do u mean
I mean I am selling half my collection
I do have some. Gonna try reading them this weekend
And I feel I've read most of what I'm interested in already
Yea. I don't read any manga either now. Mainly cause waiting for amonth to 3 months for a single chapter isn't worth it lol
I think I'm burnt out
Nice. I'm watching no anime lol
<:botanlaugh:934480552868868126>
Reminds me of the Mafia interfering with a children's toy tournament in gundam build fighters.
Interesting
man watching Shinzo ep 1. nostalgia

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdLXD3GER6I <@457268466429329429>
yep
i remember watching that on disney
im gonna kill u
rady answered that. its when you code lyoko it. people on the inside and then people on the outside
doesnt he lose his memories and live an entirely new life in aliczation?
ive always considered Alicization the only part of SAO being an isekai
Unlucky
also rip rady
irrelevant to made up words
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
me and rady understood the made up word right away
melua was giving the reason why its not an isekai if its dual loaded. then u say. thats not an isekai when we explain it
Melua knows what's up
Exactly
Imagine watching anime
Pikachu is legit the only threat to Lance. Gardevoir also has a good chance to win
GG Lance wins lmao
Can gyarados learn ice beam
He's replacement blue just like how ash is replacement red
Gary with blastoise or arcanine would been better than either charizard user
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Probably to avoid yet another dragon and/or charziard.  We already got 2 dragons and 2 charizards.
I like how Steven specifically uses a shiny metagross
ive really enjoyed kamille more over the years but thats just cause anything he's been in like a crossover or something he's always been written very well

<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
god this is like. do i like eating expired food more or burnt food
is vote more annoying. to me personally at least
gundam kits lets gooo
I prefer cooked myself
Major burn out
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I'm just not watching anime in general. Or reading manga.
Nah I'm good. I don't need to watch yet another isekai
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Yea I've been sitting here in what felt like bizarro world wondering why people were enjoying this anime when the manga was so ass
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Yea it's so not good It made me not want to watch the anime
In the manga
It was at this moment. I stopped giving a shit
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
Everyone's taste should align with mine and if they don't they're just WRONG
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
hit me with it melua
like the only thing i can think of is a situation where Gohan is like, i got this dad. and then goku just watches like F
so im curious what the excuse is that gohan is doing the work and goku isnt
Yep. Like basically all anime based off a manga
It really sucks cause it was legit a good anime up until then
Correct. Basically ends on a MC deciding what the next plans are before rolling into the credits
I'm a big fan of the anime. Always saddens me how it ended
I never tried the manga for FT
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
It's too much of a shift. Rave master should've just stayed it's own thing
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
<@699397350736658513> dude on the right Is same dude from first gif
https://tenor.com/view/master-rave-gif-18294337
Rave master translated so poorly into FT artstyle
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Says the man with no pfp
~~When he had a better artstyle~~

Speaking of 7DS
It was probably to make it watchable in china
Do people even give a shit after the nose dive of s3
Creativity is dead
Boruto, FT 1000 year warranty. This. It's too much man
Just let the shows fucking die
https://twitter.com/Crunchyroll/status/1524139753146359808?s=20&t=_V1w8cr-0uzwugUDBj4NnQ
Neat
That's how I do it
yes
<@171395487247630336> am i blind. why do people think Mob looks good
Her breaking that NPC dialog tree was probably the funniest shit to me
I love maple just falling into success. Like she does the stupidest shit cause she doesn't has a gamer mentality and gets rewarded for it
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
Even then most people say the manga goes downhill pretty hard after goldy pond
It still blows my mind how easily I could recommend S1 to people for how good it was. And now I can never recommend it to anyone ever again
They should've just done the best arc of the manga. The gold pond arc. And made money off those blu rays. And then never come back to the series
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
The last manga ending anime I remember in recent memory was the promised neverland. And we all know what happened there
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
I think that's why I dipped out of anime. Tired of too many shows never having a satisfactory ending.
I know I don't lol
Booba palooza
Yep
Like how stupid rich is ains really
I do wonder if that actually put a dent or not
He has every char in the guilds gold and possesions
<:thinkinghat:943102441627480105>
Doesn't he have like a billion gold
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Which is nowhere near the npc he does resurrect
But I assume the cost equivalent to their lvl
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Also why doesn't he ||res the party?||
Honestly really bummed he didn't use the ||resurrect|| spell and force her to work at nazarik
~~you mean featuring youjo senki and some other series that arent as good~~
i enjoyed all of gravion in dub. most of the voices were pretty good
ELLLLL GOOOOOOO
i liked the bleach anime...
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
unless youre demon slayer
im talking about slime
Scrubs
I loved it but man people were like nothing is happening!
<:botanlaugh:934480552868868126>
S2s like first 4 episodes of part 2 was all politics lol
Or realist hero (I don't like this one either)
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
I'd rather just watch more slime if I want politics
I've come to realize I don't enjoy overpowered MCs with no adversaries thay can bother them.
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Than s3
I hope s4 animates more
Shit you'll see later in s2 and 3
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
So he's racist to humans I see
<@456226577798135808> oh wait. He totally ressed ||a bunch of the lizardmen no issues||
Really made me realize I don't wanna watch this anymore
||killing that one group of adventures not even sparring the young girl when they begged him.||
His viewpoint is too warped for me to enjoy anymore
Of course
I'll never know. I kinda stopped enjoying it after s3
https://tenor.com/view/steven-he-emotional-damage-steven-he-emotional-damage-gif-23428142
so shes a human banana
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
wow the show actually acknowledges she looks like bananas. thats funny
but the three bros cross dress at one point

<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
right in the beginning in the A section
<@171395487247630336> <@258455337995075585> cant wait to have this on my shelf with all my other books.
I don't want her childhood friend
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Yea but there's too many girls I want asumi to end up with. They're all so sweet. Her first brothel girl. The one who retired. Her kouhai.
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
Don't burst my bubble. Of everything I've ever read that needs the harem ending the most
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
They both start and end with the same letter. It's practically the same name
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
Close enough
Is interested in lesbian brothels
<@161155855524298752> I take back what I said. Looking at a spoiler I'm interested in the books again.
<:pekostare:775313599379800067>
I refuse to believe Akari chan won't become a yuri harem
Yes
Ajisai getting majorly shafted when she's easily the best girl. Feels so bad
More like. They decided to waste time with girls u know that have no chance with the MC
That's exactly what happens. And why it's blegh
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
Cool now I can say it sucks officially as much as it does unofficially
Leave it on a high note
Neat. I dunno how u can top the movie so I'll probably not bother
<a:Vanish:852249081664241685>
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Sailor Pluto was my preferred girl. I also really enjoyed Saturn.
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
I also haven't watched any of it. I just enjoy the memes and art
Well I members it
I ated u cause I remember u posting anya memes
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Why are u looking at that
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Why must u always be mean to me
<a:MYAAA:727089322628743199>
I miss old-school anime artstyle
<@127848372131463168>
Machindramon?
Forreal? What does agumon turn into then
So dress shido as a girl again
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I dunno. First thing that came to mind
Did u see agumon go skullgreymon more than once? No
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Exactly. That's 1 too many
It's been 4 seasons can she still not control it? Jesus
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Trapped in a dating sim, I'm in love with a villainess and... uh.... I was gonna give a top 3 but now I can't remember what villainess stuff is also otome games
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Hey why hammer me. I'm only telling the truth
<:botanlaugh:934480552868868126>
I had to Google the name cause I only know it from people calling it bakarina
Trapped in a dating sim
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Akiza would've broke the chain if black feathers weren't so popular irl
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
I just want Kira to lose okay
Sounds awesome on paper
God just thinking about destiny frustrates me. The idea of the MC losing his family thanks to the MC of the previous series and has a vendetta to kill him. And learns his fight style to counter it to finish with a climax where he wins.
But I'm always confused at the destiny fans
I feel the average fan liked seed enough. Even with the later half not being as good as the first imo. (Basically when Kira gets the freedom)
It loved everything seed
Probably
IWSP pack is so unnecessary but I love it
I love strike and its packs.
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
You're apart of the problem
I feel the same way about the infinite justice but a little less so cause it brought back beam legs
I think most people do. Or I hope so. It's so extra. Freedom gundam is way better
<:kirifishred:727235016287060032>
<@171395487247630336> finished roll over and die book 1. Good yuri. Really dark tho.
I know. I was just trying to stay in constraints to yumi request
Nobility tends to have more than one lover anyways
I'd be fine with that too
Like why even bother doing all that and give her a nothing ending
Same fenny. They did too damn good of. Job with the heroine and MC chemistry
And not just straight isekais. Or time travel plot
<a:sotokalaugh:853300517463785472>
Ah no I was just trying to remember which villainess were also otomes lol
That's my third
Wait please bully me is an otome right
<@171395487247630336> why does everything fucking blend together
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
M3: The Dark Metal makes me cringe every time I remember it exists
I've Def watched worse mecha than valvrave
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Don't worry. Neither are Japanese authors
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Cause seeing pieces of shits get their comeuppance is nice from time to time
I couldn't tell u if the LN was better since I have zero interest in trying it
Otherwise read something else
Yea if u wanted to touch it at all. I'd say do that.
Yea. The manga probably survives better cause the mc is a better antihero there compared to his anime version.
It's probably cause once the revenge is over. There's really nothing to keep people interested. It's like goblin slayer where it just becomes a boring fantasy show
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
The fact season 1 has an 8. Just shows how low peoples standards are
<@132019566497890304> <@152896851660505088>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Trapped. Or content?
I mean if I could be 16 again. I'd do it
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
They also share the fact that their scale figure is expensive af
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
U speak like that's a rarity in anime
this looks like a badguy id kill in ZoE
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I love. I can't believe my giant space alien is this cute!
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Deserves a 2nd season more than majority of the trash isekai that get one
It was so fun
I miss that anime
It blows me away how miku consistently sells
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
It didn't have incest. Was doomed to fail
She made her case and he changed his mind. Better than most protags
I love how she made izayoi go. U know what. U rite!
She's based
Shiroyasha enchanted a skirt to have ALMOST visible panties no matter what angle u looked at. Cause it's allure of just being able to peek but not see was better than actually see
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
Shut up cypher
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Pure badass and swagger
Izayoi is basically human Voldigoad
I liked when the MC ||kicked a cursed ray|| like it was fucking nothing
Man we usually agree with so much but I guess not here
Don't u remember when pink hero used her sawblades as a shield
That one with the blonde on the cover has some nice art
Tearmoon was funny for what I've read of the manga. Looking forward to the novel
Yo same. I'll read that
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
The best shield. Is the meat shield Maria. U mean
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Force of habit. Why start wearing pants? U prob need to buy pants. Fuck that
~~So her job was also changed from assassin to porn star~~
u make a compelling argument
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
i miss non seasonal animes honestly. just having a show that had a gauranteed 50+ episodes was nice
thats wild
wait never take a break?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
DOG FIVE
you know whats an underated arc?
Lots of 5 dollar books
I'm super pumped for all the deals o found over time lol
Some books are missing cause I'm reading them or my mom is but that's basically everything minus say 5-8 books
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>

Oh he's my bros name lmao
<:FujitakaSalute:688199574917087256>
Also glasses dude was a true bro.
Clanclan best girl
Rip aot. It's like being stuck in the same season as spy x family
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Not In America
Neat. Is it based off the anime?
Slayers the anime?
I'll just wait for a reprint. And if that never happens. Whelp I'll never own it
Rip ever owning asterisk wad
What older series u still need?
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
i was gonna sell this. but now i wanna keep it lol
<@258455337995075585>

YOOOO i just realized my goblin slayer nendoroid has a battery spot to make his eye light up <@331908049822547978>
There's a lot of filler in og gundam
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
They condensed down the series to 9 episodes?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
what if gundam seed is after their version of UC nuked itself to oblivion and we humans repopulated the earth
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
maybe this is just this universes Amuro computer in the seed universe
bro tomino. who the fuck hurt u
so theres literally no survivors by the end. holy shit
like everyone as in. the entire human population?
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
what about the childs pregnant mother
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
gotcha. wait so nobody lives by the end of ideon? then whats the point of the show
so wait they ran out of money on the final  eps or the movie
i didnt know he had that name to begin with
whats be invoked
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
maybe theyll let the pink gundam get to do anything this time around
i mean. they cant make it any worse
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I'd be happy if they reconned some of the dumb deaths that existed just to be deaths
Tho with IBO there's a ton u can easily cut out and not miss anything. Like a large portion of the 2nd season. Or that like 5 episode space trek to the mafia in S1
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
does this morph into a jet? cause it looks like it does
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
when are they gonna make an isekai where someone from our world gets thrown into a gundam universe and has to stop bad things from overturning the gundam timeline
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
wasnt spelled with a C
*points at zeta*
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
who wouldve imagined a unicorn would be their money maker
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
203... when was victory and crossbone?
they should make a gundam where theres an Amuro clone instead. ~~thats not the ai thingie melua mentioned earlier~~
whats gaia gear
<:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
how do u expect to watch something that was deleted
whats cda
okay mao
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
all the hate
i think he's trying to say that the GP03 shouldnt need the D cause its already referring to the dendrobium while the S addition is for just the stamen
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
fuck that snowflake
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
i mean it has GP already
why is narrative C packs just a lamer Unicorn destroy mode
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
i think the Stamen is great on its own honestly. i tried it in a few games that had it by itself and its solid
whats the D for then
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
when mentioned
because cypher doesnt stop.
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
hi millhi. whats up
oh no. touya mentioned HF
that Sazabi is a fucking beast
i do like all the katoki designed model kits usually
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
maybe it was a super nuke?
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
who rates things out of 5
was the massive shield supposed to protect it from the nuke blast
melua was purposely ignoring that cypher
i still need to get that model kit of the gerbera
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
RX-78-GP-03-D
OH
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
how do people describe gundam if not with the rx-78-2
another has been enlightened
<:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
maybe melua. the nuke was spinnning. for more damage
get a new keyboard
they fed this one nuke. many smaller nukes to make it big and strong
ive legit never seen anyone in my life use the - outside of you lol
oh actually. cypher. i gotta ask, why do u use - sometimes instead of the '
im referring to the army in general
that makes sense
hey quick question, why was the EF seemingly fine fighting in space when a lot of them were earth dwellers. while Zeon had an obvious issue with dealing with gravity fights
<:CarolWhat:688191203040034831>
oh god the mk2 is gonna morb
random side tangent why is the GP01 FB called that when Full Vernier makes more sense.
I saw messages about ab and no I realize they were last night after I slepy
I personally wish angel beats was shorter to cut out a lot of the filler it doesn't need
i see a lot of accel covers with nice booba
i think the unicorn gundam itself is actually good design. i hate the show its based in tho
Oh shit the brought back hyperdrive for arc v? That's hype
I liked the 5ds dubbed ops
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
<@171395487247630336> book 2 is out of stock
Perfect timing cause my mom just finished MT and ill need the next couple of books
Lmao facts
Cancel that shit
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh. My b
This is the one where u actually pay for things

<@127991170201681920> <@152896851660505088> <@171395487247630336> rightstuf has a seven seas publisher sale. 30% off manga and light novels
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Yo what OG wrath was Nana Mizuki in sub
I still like og wrath. He was a little shit.
I forget that movie exists constantly
I recommend people start there and to watch that until they deviate and then jump to BH since it gives more time to the beginning that BH did
I still enjoy OG FMA personally.
I mean didn't og Naruto have like 80 eps of filler after the chunin exam
I like the bount arc. I didn't even know it was filler at first. Orihime and chad had some good character growth in it. (That got regressed after the fact)
Yes
Cause I don't want to say pointless episodes cause that sounds mean
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Jake. I feel like most people prefer bleach filler arcs vs other shounen filler arcs. It's the bleach one off filler episodes with kon is what everyone hates
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
This is how I felt when it first released melua.
Cause for me personally. Outside of like the first 2 eps. The amazing flash back and the finale. Nothing really mattered
At least that specific miku is done by GSC. So it should looke pretty spot on
I think it's wild how companies can get away with not shipping exact copies. Cause at that point isn't it just false advertising
Yea lol.  The always scary thing about preorders
This I think is worth the 200 bucks.
Like God damn this miku is beautiful
But more often they're overpirced
The amount of detail that u can get with some figures is insane. Sure some can be overpriced. But I feel some do warrant the price they ask
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Should I mention the recent azur lane new jersey 1/4 figure that went up for preorder at 600 dollars
I'd be legit surprised to see anything outside of a random artist alley art
To be fair the shows been done for 3 years and has had like zero presence here in the west outside of the Bluerays discotek did well after the fact
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Shows it's quality
I love how almost all the volumes of otome Game is out of stock
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm going to do an out of stock order of a bunch of stuff that's out atm
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
And scary
That's impressive
Damn u survived 4 volumes of mom and her 2 hit multi attack.
I hear the ln is even better
I enjoyed the anime
I see youre up to date with tomozaki kun. How has that been
I love how my entire collection is a 10th of cais backlog
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Unrelated but this has some nice covers
~~I saw some good stuff.~~
So far
Thankfully everything I've read hasn't gone past 5 volumes
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Not necessarily. If I like the volume 1. I'll buy all the other volumes out currently
At least from seven seas
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm running out of new volume 1s to buy tho. So that's a good start
I'm helping
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I def plan to sell off books I don't like
Your Def the person here I know that has the most. Millhi I think is second followed by me. Or I passed millhi and I'm now second. I don't remember lol
Well if that's your goal. Makes sense
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
So what will u do if u don't like it
Im trying to avoid buying sequels of books until I've at least read vol 1 to know if I like it lol
Ah rip. I found the manga incredibly boring. Was curious about the LN
Have u read any of berserk of gluttony?
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
A sisters all u need. I thought u had taste cais
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Out of print. Or out of stock
I can never start strike the blood thanks to out of print volumes
Wew
Did u see righstuf has a seven seas sale?
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
What u get today
That too
U got more books to buy
I just imagined u buying the horses from Jojos lmao
Their mikus tend to be on point
What about manga with no anime or LN
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
But... then u get shit like otome game
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
You're missing out on some cultured art
Is that all Ln or manga too
I wish manga was a little cheaper than it is. I'm hard pressed to pay like a dollar less for something I read in a 4th of the time of a LN
<@171395487247630336> I'm still waiting on this. It sounds stupid but I'm willing to give it a shot. 7th Time Loop The Villainess Enjoys A Carefree Life Married To Her Worst Enemy! Novel volume 1
Can't afford to print all that booba
I debated buying some manga that was only manga and had no other versions. And them I figured it was a waste of money
That sounds like a great subject for me to sleep thru and know I missed nothing
Only if u can explain why it's all we fucking see in ln nowadays
~~dm the books~~
Depends on the subject
If it was. I'd be sleeping right now
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I just let them believe what they want and move on to a different subject that I can actually put some stock into
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
U mean volume 20
I'm not gonna gaslight myself
Nah. If it's not good in its first volume. I assume it'll never be good
Unlike manga where it could have a top tier artist
If they aren't interesting. Then there's nothing that can save the LN
Hey lewd/stupid manga is different from LN
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
What did I do to u millhi
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Also roll over and die is super good. 2-5 were apart of my recent order
Lol u just convinced me to not do an out of stock order
Rip cais
Like a month ago
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
It was in stock
It's not an isekai
Wait. I ordered vol 1 of that
I completely forgot about it
I'm sorry
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
I... did not
What book
I think manga is pretty light physically
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Manga are just graphic novels. Close enough
Obv
Because u want thr biggest collection
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
7 dollars off a 250 dollar item. thats like 2%
the membership is awful for figures tho lol
i def plan to buy more books anyway thru the rest of the year
still. with 50 books i bought wouldve saved 25 bucks. which after the 18 dollar membership wouldve been 7 dollars off lol
<@127991170201681920> man only 45-50 cents off books. 5% at best savings. less if u count msrp lol
i guess ill go buy it now ahead of the birthday sale lol
people told me the novels only ever get like 3% off when u buy from the weekly sales. so it didnt sound appealing lol
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
ive been sitting here wonderign if i shouldve gotten the membership from rightstuf for all the money ive spent alredy
are u some millionaire
<:CarolWhat:688191203040034831>
u collect BD too?
starts june 26th
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
i hope novels from j novel go on sale
35TH BIRTHDAY SALE IS COMING SOON! for rightstuf
oh snap cais
forreal? thats a huge oof
i wish other stores could ever match the deals of rightstuf. its insane how cheap they can sell
<:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>

I was referring to trapped in a otome game. But I figure u were just messing with me lol
im also not a fan of the show. but man i love that ED
haruhi suzumiya
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
i owned the first 4 episodes on dvd

im a little sad they didnt add 2 more girls just to have 5 dancing like the og ED

I heard LN
im already invested in Nanao. and the first girl asumi has been with. when she got to go out with her a second time. it was so cute seeing her react to how different asumi acted
maybe. i dont remember the time table anymore. in the end it doesnt really matter. i still have zero investment in this childhood friend.
pretty sure it was girl 3 since all three of the people she bunks with had been with her at that point
she learned like girl 2 or 3.  and asumi has been with 8 girls so far i believe. maybe 7. so yea its possible its only been a month which is pretty short in hindsight
but its at least 1 girl a week
dunno if she skips weeks
well its confirmed she does a girl a week
but this is just my brain reading the story for more than it is
it just is weird to me. if each chapter is basically a week, shes known for a couple months now. thats hella passive
lots of ways if she really wanted to
social media. or trying to see if her parents still live back where she did so u could get her info that way. or im sure u could sleuth her info from one of the girls whos already been with her
also im confused why asumi's friend doesnt just reach out to her? you know shes looking for u. like why wait till she buys your time to do lewd stuff with
theyve introduced so many good girls. i really couldnt care less about asumi's childhood friend anymore
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
leave her out of the brothels
nanao is too pure. she only belongs with asumi
Nanao best girl
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I think I had a brain aneurysm reading that
No. You are
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<@171395487247630336> <@152896851660505088> bookstore near me had a 15% off used books. Got 6 and 7 of realist hero. Misfit of demon king manga vol 1, empty box zeroth Maria vol 1, monster girl doctor 4,5,6. <@127991170201681920> roughly 5 bucks a piece
i still remember watching the first episode of this. and to this day i feel like i have no better example of a show that had ADHD
Speaking of muvluv. <@152896851660505088> how's that game coming along
Muvluv in general u mean
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I'm shocked they never made an anime for tsukihime. Seems perfect for it
U might have to run it in compatibility mode and choose windows XP. Sometimes the new operating systems just don't work.
Now upgrade to the blu rays
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
drop all of them and read your book backlog
And how's the anime
<@171395487247630336> u ever read a centaurs life? I saw a crap ton of them used at the store but glossed over the series lol
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
I guess so. I feel like 1 book Mangas are really rare tho. People online seem to like it. Sadge
Strange
<@171395487247630336> this looked mildy amusing but oddly was dropped be seven seas after just one volume? Even tho Japan has a few volumes.
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Nah I hate different worlds
*looks at my isekai bookcase*
But I'm more intrigued
This weird.
Elaborate pls
Wut
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
The first two are cool. But the third one... why
It's own death
~~Because nobody would buy it otherwise~~
What kinda of stores u go to. I've only been to Barnes and noble and 2nd and charles.
I'm gonna stop by and maybe pick some of them up on the way. If they're cheap. Why not. B2g2f after all
I'm shocked 2nd and charles has like none for them. But a billion centaurs life
Monster musume
Gave me a good chuckle
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<@171395487247630336> someone posted some manga that's out of print. But then I went to righstuf  and saw they were in stock there. <@152896851660505088>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
My list has stagnated
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Time to start new game plus
I have added it to my never ending list of things I need to buy
You'll find that amusing too
<@258455337995075585>
<@171395487247630336> I know u read this manga but this cover made me laugh
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Imagine all the soaplands u could go to for that price.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
And 4 thousand dollars
It's 3 or so feet tall
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@258455337995075585> want a 1/1 scale bust of albedo?
Also interesting they use korra's old hairstyle
I really couldn't think of anyone else worth being interesting to make a movie about from the Korea series
Dunno. I feel like following one of angs grand kids would've been more interesting like that one girl who's very intune with the spirit world.

I'm cool with weird. I enjoyed I'm not a succubus
Seemed it was really good up until thay last episode
Well gg it ever getting a s3
I Google it and I am the exact as that gif u posted
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Please tell me more
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
I mean yea. If you have no interests outside of symphogear. You're gonna be paying shipping
Probably do fedex cause of the free shipping they give out after a certain price point. Helps their bottom dollar im sure
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Well it is an American company. So no surprise there.
Unless not American. Then rip
It's a little more than that. If it's msrp is 40 bucks. Rightstuf usually sells it for 32ish. So 24 bucks is a solid 8 bucks or extra 20%off. Plus free shipping at 75 spent.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I saw Virgin road and was like. Well that's not the right show
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I thought it was executioner. Then u posted a name that didn't have the word executioner so I thought I had the wrong anime but then I Google the name and it was executioner
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
U baited me
Wait that's executioner
Oh
Oh I think I know
What anime gex
I'd love a magical revolution anime personally
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Pulled them off the shelf to get an idea
<@171395487247630336> <@152896851660505088> all my vol 1 LN I still need to try
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Ah so they probably hate people like me who never buy the other stuff
Maybe you'd like the books instead? So u wouldn't be seeing all that gratuitous fan service
What's a loss leader
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I guess so. I just see their constant sending out 10% coupons that also stack with the membership. So u get roughly 30-35% off quite easily. and u can get free shipping if u send enough.
I wanna know how rightstuf can sell all it's manga and LN for 20% off retail all the time
I wonder what the best place to buy LN and manga is for europeans
This is all assuming you're usa based
Of course lol
And I know the membership isn't for anyone. But if u buy LN or manga which rightstuf is the best place to buy from. The membership is a no Brainer lol
Which. If I bought blu rays anymore. Would be quite enticing
Yea I also got the membership so that saves a little extra too. I think the blu rays for me was 22.50
Not saying everyone needs to be me
But that's just my personal take
Eh. I have no prime and I'm not dealing with making useless emails for more free primes for one purchase. Nor do I need to have whatever I buy immediately.  I'd rather support this company than Amazon if the prices are similar
Gross lol
For the beginning
So it only has land combat ?
Lmao forreal Melua?
I was shook
The scene in the first movie where the zeon pilots are watching footage of the white devil. Man it did such a good job selling how scary it is to go up against such a beast
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
But I legit don't wanna watch it to hear more awful jazz. That's my only reason
I still need to watch the second thunderbolt movie
That sounds right to me
I think it was called the G bull?
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
That was removed from the trilogy
I personally wouldn't cause it's just a shield.  I was thinking more main suit damage
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
At least he enjoys food now
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Imagine if he had a dom. He would've won
Really showing how great Ramba was
I think that's the only time it really gets damaged until the finale
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Heat rod
~~let's just throw that idea away for the second half of the show~~
Having a demerit to go along with your opness makes for compelling possible fight ideas
Man now that melua mentioned strike. I really loved how it's the strongest of the 5 gundams thanks to its versatile backpack system but also can't be in the field for super long.
I honestly barely remember the original. I think it was out of commission for one period of time and they had to rely on the guncannon and guntank for a hot minute
But man the wing gundam getting destroyed 3 times is a hell of a lot for the MCs gundam
I feel like gundam wing is oddly  the winner even tho it's also the show where the gundams never take damage until plot needs them to
True.... that might make third place.
Did Turn A take much damage?
And it needed a colony laser to damage it
Unicorn I think never took any damage until the final episode right?
Oh that's a good thing to think about. The reverse. What suit never takes any damage
<@99695384296701952> random thought for you. Which Main gundam gets damaged the most often in their own series? I feel like the barbatos was getting repaired all the time. But I also haven't seen all of gundam. I know Wing Gundam got repaired from full destruction like 2 or 3 times. But I can't really think of any others that got severely damaged outside of once or the destroyed to get an upgrade suit thing gundam always does.
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
and ladders
I legit sat down and thought of every gundam show. And somehow missed victory lol
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Ohhhh yea! I completely forgot that existed
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Female pilots deserve more love
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
I just don't want it to suck and them blame having a female protag as the reason why. And not the actual reasons it sucks.
I really hope this witch gundam is good
Gainer has an op that just gets stuck in your brain

remember when Domon dislocated his shoulder to squeze out of the anaconda gundam grip. and his shining gundam also popped out its joint.
go away

<@171395487247630336> <@127991170201681920> <@152896851660505088> finished the angel next door spoils me rotten. It was... fine. Nothing spectacular or anything. Probably won't pick up book 2 unless I ever ran out of other stuff to read. Just a kinda bog standard romance novel.
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
It's waiting for one book that's been in stock multiple times
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Why isn't it being sent out
Hi derek
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<@171395487247630336> <@152896851660505088> <@127991170201681920> got 6 more shelves for my bookcase. 30 bucks. Just in time for rightstuf birthday sale to fill them all out
<@213645184125239317> honestly it was better as a cute manga than a LN cause they drew the heroine very well with her cute expressions. Might be better off just sticking to thag
Nah I'm only keeping series I like. So that and notorious talker are both gonna be trade or sold away
THAT EPISODE MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Sure
I love in the first episode the DOM got blasted thru the chest. But the build burning is somehow fine
I actually kinda liked that
Also I hate how the try burning was originally made for reiji supposedly. Like reiji knew how to shoot and use beam weapons. Very effectively. Why would u throw that all away for just punching.
I feel like I can handwave all of them but the ground punch one
Or rotate your fist into a drill
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Tell me. When do they teach u to punch the ground to spawn fire
I still hate how his martial arts school somehow translates to techniques not physically possible to do
Eh I can kinda see it then.
Oh did Shia help?
Sure he mightve had help from fumina and other guy. But they're still inferior to iori imo
Yea fucking right
I still think the kamiki burning is such a bullshit upgrade. U telling me sekai was able to improve the gunpla that iori made?
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Star build strike gets rekt at least once. I think the kamiki burning gundam was fine but that normal burning Def got owned. Like vs the Tryon 3
Especially the two fighter protags
Almost all the build protag suits get rekt at some point lol
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Just do what that one gunpla did and flip the wings upside down when folded up. That looks good right?
Man u right melua. Those look really bad folded up
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Obv kira's suits just don't have reactors at all. Otherwise how does he survive them all exploding
And here I thought he could do everything
Oh a computer controls his bits? I thought he was the one doing it
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Master gundam, Gundam Air Master, Master gundam (GBF ver.)
Shining, strike, TV zero are probably my top 3 designs
That makes me sad. Tv zero is one of my fave designs ever
If we only count tv shows. I'd agree. If we count movies. I think the quanta and the Wing zeron EW are downgrades to their TV predecessor
I think the SF is a little too much. Like the freedom was perfect and now u overcomplicated it with dragoons and gold parts
I think they were just happy to be able to use ibo in crossovers now that the one company channel didn't own the rights
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Fuck the SF
Also while they didn't show it. U KNOW that mace got lodged into the strike freedom chest
Where u would think the two MC would clash
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Let's have best girl Ayame participate but not riku. And instead have the final clash between hiroto and champion
That was funny to me
Also the build divers battlelogue neglecting to have the first MC in the tournament at all.
While I hate divers. The one thing i feel they got right was you have to build your kit well enough or special modes like Trans am will literally break your model kit
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Let's not forget glasses dude gunpla is so high performing it can beat a kyrios in Trans am for speed
One other nitpick. Tryon 3 beamstruggle. Why does the beam just hit them like a blunt object and not just shred them after it won the beam struggle.
I mean I would still point to glasses fucker in a UC suit spamming bigger beams but fine
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Also can I say peacock smasher. Top-tier gun name
I feel like kamiki or even glasses dude has shot off more beams and shit but didn't run out of fuel
Try never fails to annoy me to no end with its inconsistent bullshit
Why is the full cloth consuming so much fuel when it's barely doing anything
Which means more thick boys
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
If everything is coated in ifield then u need to go back to bullets which mean thicker armor which means more bulk.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Just coat everything in ifield. Problem solved
I bet they're happy that gundam wing is a fan favorite design and can use it to constantly rehash it for morenprofit
Yes blockio
It's smart business wise but God do I hate it
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
Also fuck wing for being not standard gundam size for no reason.
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Small MS stink cause I like big model kits on my shelf. Not tiny ones
How is Anaheim even in business still
Don't u need to be a newtype yourself to access the NTD or was it just a coincidence the pilot just happened to be one
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
That moment when the unicorn hijacked the funnels. Is so clean
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Wait. The destiny has no normal beam Saber. Holy shit I never noticed
Isn't the name for that hand attack really stupid too
The 2.0 freedom looks so good. I love the design changes
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>

Interesting crossbones is f97. What's the f99 look like.
Also are there actually f1-89 or does it start at 90
Wait f99? What happened to f92 thru 8
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
I went thru a lot of effort to find this meme

~~so when Kira gets the freedom~~
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
I don't think anything beats two unicorns and 3 shields blocking a colony laser
It's such a weird gunpla to introduce cause it looks more like an upgrade to the burning gundam than a before form
Star burning gundam.
Basically the thing the becomes the build burning
What was that one gunpla used for the GMs counterattack
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Also I'm curious how one even creates the RG system and the absorb and discharge system with just plastic gunpla
Like a variable beam saber
If they adapted the RG into a more weaponized form I could see it doing better than just punching
Yea they made a system that relied too much on their opponent. But they are the amateur underdogs so it makes sense that they're the ones who made it
If they weren't MCs. They would've lost to like three different people imo.
I don't believe the only option to beat a giant robot is to punch it really hard. Gunpla has an infinite amount of possibilities
Coming into this hours later. But why did Nicole leave stealth to attack the strike. Right before ||he died||
What
Wait an onsen?
cant wait for the plot to start rolling in 2025
a whole 13 chapters or some shit
fucking boat isekai
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
<@171395487247630336> <@979049315622326322> reading some manga

Lol yea I know there's a lot of really good stuff at three volumes thanks to ash and fejny
Maybe my brain just  feels it's too short. Or in too used to manga needing like 3 books to setup the story first before anything happens lol
<@171395487247630336> <@152896851660505088> do manga interest u if they're already done and only got 2-4 volumes?
Manga phanta
I need 13 bucks to get free shipping. Guess I'll just be hoping the daily deals has something for me
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Dafuck
<@171395487247630336> <@152896851660505088> <@979049315622326322>
<@152896851660505088> it seems they're bring over a bunch of villainess manga or yuri. So I can't be too mad at them
Gimme some examples
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
What was the issues to begin with
How so
Wild
Also tokyopop is still around?
This looks gay. I'm interested
I think I'll wait to see if anything good on the daily deals pops up before I take a bite
Even tho i feel like potions has gone even cheaper before on rightstuf itself lol
Average abilities 40% off but they tend to go super cheap on thr after market anyways for less than that
This week is a bit of a dud outside of the things I mentioned.
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
The voice acting may make me die of cringe
Not... really
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Why watch the anime when I've read the manga past the point the anime will be
I wonder if I'd find that series funny without the visuals of the manga
Eminence of shadow hardcover 1-4 novels are 10.99 a piece. <@171395487247630336>
So rightstuf birthday sale started. Nothing too too crazy. The best deals this week are komi san, opm, kaguya Sama and call of the night being sold for roughly 5-5.50 a piece.

~~mainly cause i had no idea what else he did until someone told me~~
its his most memorable role
<:ElfneinPresents:691733046633955439>
its the best role he's ever done. the person who modded 3 houses to make everyone Ferdinand was the best
i love this got animated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX640_Gd4uE <@202444817043685386>

Wit really brought their a game for animation
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
It's in the same arc with them on that space resort
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Weebs will still go
I can't imagine the biggest anime convention in the USA to just stop lol
I Def need to go to anime expo next year
Yo I know that artist. They were at a con in Michigan once. I have pyra and Mythra.
I'll take them thank u. Such a kind raidou
I got her for nice and cheap too. Pretty hyped
<:Sitonep:966881149249024071>

I saw the figure I got of her right
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Arpeggio has best girl takao. It auto wins
No clue
Where mecha fell into the background instead of being the height of anime
We are in the cursed timeline
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
I'm so curious what story would they have told if it got an actual season 2 instead of a movie
I dunno. I always thought it was weird. Cause if she dyes it. It never comes up
I assume her dark blue hair faded? Into cyan. Kinda like how your hair gets lighter if you get a ton of sun over time
<:sspepeclown:865391530360832030>
I'm shallow
Also I'm really not a fan of how ruri looks. She's so cute in the Tv series.
<:BiancaUpset:865861284304781313>
Why
They turned best girls hair blue.
<:XD:790305849800654878>
~~I'm saying the movie doesn't exist cause I wasn't a fan of it~~
<:AylaThink:865861284125474857>
What do u mean? The TV show never got a sequel. Even tho it says we will see u season 2
Or have the cast of a srw game warp to muv luv in the second game.
I feel like the only time we could add muvluv if we had like a smaller handheld srw with smaller series like nadesico and FMP so nothing seems wildly out of place.
Please don't
<:AylaThink:865861284125474857>
But how did her parents fuck
Sometimes we get a random season we're there's only 1 or 2. Shockingly. But it's rare lol
Ibo and nadesico too maybe? Mars got rekt by beta and they had to flee to earth
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Victory gundam could work. Easily kill everyone In that
Throw in every mecha anime that had despair to make it fit with muvluv
<:sspepeclown:865391530360832030>
That's what I mean. Usually one or two series is the biggest plot device for the game. But have like Britannia exist on earth when the beta invade
Maybe
<:AylaThink:865861284125474857>
That's how u cram them into muv luv
What if some factions existed before the beta invasion. And they're dealing with the massive loss of humans
Fair
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
based
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
its not even good trash. its boring trash
okay then yea
does he have an army of slimes that have are adorable
<:ChrisRead:688429724334161987>
is this that one i thought was gonna be fun but the MC is such a no personality soggy piece of bread that it became boring af
it's a cool suit tho. i love that shade of purple its got
Destiny Type Null
well we have infinite justice. so they have to use a different dumb word
Strike Freedom Full Armor, Justice Infinity, Manifest Destiny, True Providence. i really cant wait for the dumb new names if they do give them upgrades.
Chris ex form is.
<:kms:790305849863045120>
I said cool. And u name datalive
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>

That's how I felt about beware the villainess. They did such a damn good job with the chemistry between the villainess and the protag girl. I wish it had a second ending with her. Or a threesome ending.
<:LiaLove:916136388469071892>
<@171395487247630336> appreciate it.

Reminds me of when douchebag <@979049315622326322> sent me the boat manga with 9 chapters initially
That are also villainess related isekai
<:AylaThink:865861284125474857>
I can't think of a lot of multiple people isekai honestly. I can only think of trapped on a dating sim. And she's just an idiot. Not evil lol
But that's less a protag and just a bitch of a sister
The only one I can think of atm is the one turns the hourglass.
Or irrelevant
I actually haven't seen many where the protag is evil. Usually they become friends with the now good villainess

I personally believe murders only punishment should be death but that's just me.

Seeing our world going to shit. Id Def say imposing that onto another world is just bad lol
100%  yes I'd say
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
The moment in the anime u realize the doctor is huge. ~~cause her coat hides them well~~
By introducing democracy
Where I stopped. The MC was going to destroy the world.
<:AylaThink:865861284125474857>
I think the context was the guy wanted to bang her cause of her body.

Literally
Yea she enjoyed having the life of her patients in her hand
<:LiaLove:916136388469071892>
The best prodigy was the insane doctor cause she was hot af, busty af but also insane af
God knows I ain't watching more to find out
Probably not
Her ai is the most sci-fi thing and before I dropped the show the most advanced thing she currently made was the semi truck
She also invented that power plant battery pack
Yea. She has a mini power plant battery pack for her super ai so it'll never die.
Like a semi truck
They have a mechanic loli with a super ai assisted where she can make basically anythinf
They're just unconsious
Oh but dont worry he only used rubber bullets so nobody actually died so he's not labeled a killer
Nope. He breaks into the guys estate. Takes out all the security and then gets the girl. Very easily. Without breaking a sweat
U shoot them. They only have melee weapons
No it's a standard 9mm pistol. I forgot which one but it's like the most reliable 9mm
Thank God one of them is a super mechanic engineer genius who can make anything and anything
Gun
Yea like one girl gets kidnapped and it gets easily solved cause the Government MC has a gun. That's the only reason
Which I guess they tell u in the title. But still
Like honestly if the show was only about one of them. It mightve been more interesting. But since they can rely on each other for completely different aspects. There's no issue they can't solve
The rich dude teaching a cute little cat girl how to be a merchant was probably the best part of the show
Yes. Only good parts were the very nicely detailed lewd fanservice scenes. Outside that it was boring af.
I didn't get far into it. But they invented a fucking semi truck in a fantasy urban setting. So I wouldn't be shocked if they remade the internet
<@161155855524298752> you're prob thinking of this
Classroom of the elite isn't an isekai last I checked. It's more a battle school genre
<:AylaThink:865861284125474857>
I got bored of that after one episode
Super refeshing
I feel like the class is always cartoony evil in this scenario. There's one manga where the classmates don't actually bail on the MC. But he gets transported away anyway. And the classmates are like yo wtf? We gonna find him and bring him back class that's fucked.
I'm not a big fan of that subgenre. I only enjoyed like 1 maybe 2 manga from it
Yea I do remember that category. Like failure frame or arifureta
True. But I never seen one piece being sold. So people must have some taste to keep that at least
I'll give u two bags of rice and 3 chickens.
It's always funny when I get updates from mangaswap reddit and it's people trying to unload all their shounen. Like good luck buddy. Everyone and their grandma collects that shit
All the readers dying of cringe
<:pekocry:775313612449382440>
I've bought a lot of yuri recently actually. It's just stuck in the mail
<:AylaThink:865861284125474857>
I swear the amount of collections I've seen that have a billion AoT, Naruto, JJK in it. Is wild
At least my bookshelves arent normie and filled with only shounen stuff.
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Thank you millhi
Like I know I read a lot of digital trash but I feel like I buy good physical stuff
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
I honestly got pretty depressed when one of my friends just straight up told me my taste in manga was trash when I was showing them the manga/LN I recently bought.
Fuck me for sharing.
Wow u too? Everyone been ragging on my taste of late
Sup millhi?
<:AylaThink:865861284125474857>
No sir
<@161155855524298752> ~~Also it's not only because I saw this cover~~
The books are super cute

I've been hoping it goes on sale on rightstuf
Oh yea I've seen that
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
I need more ojisan. Why do manga have to be monthly ash
Lmao
Also his dad parent brain in a cute girl accidentally wooing the female protag is cute af as well
<@171395487247630336> I need more isekai like the ojisan one. Where they have literally no clue about the game whatsoever and just deal with it.
Not enjoyable to me
Yea that one. It tries to be funny but she's exactly like a male otaku mc. Antisocial, all the game knowledge etc.
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
I just remembered that one isekai where the mc girl grinds to lvl 99 before the plot of the game starts or whatever and people are supposed to be like lvl 5-10
I just hate the gamiefied isekais where the MC is like OH IM IN MY ENVIROMENT HERE.
I do gotta say I enjoy the trend that isekai is moving away from weeb MCs. I feel like the best isekais have non weeb mc
I always get a good laugh out of that
I love when myne males a new invention. He gets excited to buy it and sell it. Then she makes a 1.5 or 2.0 version that he now has to buy.
And then people think she's weird af. Which I enjoyed
<:kms:790305849863045120>
I do like her the most. They just had to make her related.
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
It's japan. Suguha should've been the choice
I really liked Liz arc with him collecting mats making a sword. I felt a good connection there
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
He had so many better options
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Maybe they wanna be surrounded by nature but not deal with bugs.

How much is manga in france
Thanks to rightstuf constant 20% off msrp and throwing 10% coupons out all the time. Manga is really cheap
A piece
I just bought a crap ton of manga and ln recently for 4-6 euro
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
America has it so easy.  Its insane

<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
I'm spoiled by online pricing. It's no wonder book stores are dying
Nice. The only place here that does that is like Barnes and noble. And they sell at msrp. Fuck that

<:emoji_5:710717148955148328>
For being such a late game waifu. I actually think Alice is pretty strong waifu
Fucking knew cypher would go there
Wasn't Liz literally about to ask kirito out before asuna ruined it by barging in? Or am I misremembering
<@152896851660505088> <@171395487247630336> <@258455337995075585> well that's a way to start a book. I like how one Is just called nudist girl
Oh
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
And then she joined a guild and lost all her character
Just get this figure and be done with it.
Honestly the art alone is worth it. Those Gantz lvl detail fights are top notch
<:Sitonep:966881149249024071>
Also the mc goes for my favorite girl. Top tier taste
I recommend trying the manga cypher. It's art is great
The MC has what he thinks is amnesia but vaguely remembers what seems like modern day knowledge but when it gets explained it's pretty cool
Oh wait. It's not an isekai. It fools u into thinking it's one
People compete to be the next demon king/lord/God thing. And summon servants to fight each other.
An isekai. But. It has the brutality of Gantz for its fights. Like I was shocked how brutal its imagery was.
Japanese people built different. Also his major is very useful. He was studying college stuff in high-school
I'm shocked I've gotten almost all the volumes of realist hero for 5 or less dollars lol
This was my most recent order. They had 15% off all their priced at the time too
I found a nice usa overstock website that updates every few days and has some pretty recent manga in it for 4-5 dollars. Gotta be on top of it tho cause they tend to only get like 1-4 copies of things at a time
Nice! 8 bucks is like the highest I've been paying as well. It's so hard to not say yes to 5 dollar manga lol
<:Sitonep:966881149249024071>

lmao
OH
its it drugstore in another world?
can u be more specific theres like 3 pharmacy isekai
<@99695384296701952> a manga u might be interested in called Animeta! It looks a lot like shirobako. But the protagonist is someone trying to be an animator. Written by a former animator who worked on movies like Eva 1.0 and 2.0.
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>

I'd watch that if it's as good as initial D
Why is this so good lmao
Gimme 1/72 gundam kits. I love 1/100 already. Bigger is better!
I'm surprised aangs pet monkey is still alive
Maybe zuko actually
I agree sokka is the best. I feel like Toph is the worst.
<:kms:790305849863045120>
Also rip sokka in korra
On one hand neat. Especially of they can get the old VAs back. On the other hand. I'm not a fan of how most of them look now
~~People asking why it took so long to make more content for such a popular series~~

Just like how gundam build fighters is the best anime ad to exist
It's a decent anime. Especially when it's just to advertise a mobile game. So in that aspect it's great
Takt op destiny?
Probably two toned on the inside and out
The old dub will mostly work. Except for the new scenes lol. Or anything with the perfect strike
The new dub is oof. If u watch the remaster better off just watching subbed
<@115579492059185152> so apparently he went thru cyber newtype training but ended up Awakening as a true new type
I figured all the flash backs with banagher attached to machines was showing how they made him a newtype
Really? I always thought all the dialog was telling us he was an artifical one.
I have no idea. Banagher is just a Cyber newtype isn't he? So he should've been fine with psycommu stuff
Tho I think the og silver bullet was way more versatile with all its psycommu weapons
Always wondered what it was called
Also I never know that gundam from the last episode of unicorn was the silver bullet and what ends up becoming the suppressor.
Ikr? Could've just used a beam gun from the delta plus or something. Which are pretty strong already
I'd probably read the novel of narrative instead of the movie. Cause like unicorn it's way better written
Also just go unseal the unicorn banagher. Don't be using this suppressor instead
Yea I remember the delta plus messing up. But not like to a significant degree
I never watched narrative but I know it's a big boy with arms that remind me of the neozeong when it's arms get rekt
<:pekowow:775313472971472897>
Me too! It's so good. Op strong. But has the draw back of limited ammo.

but then i would commit murder on all these stupid people that shop
i've been thinking about it all day
i'll probably keep my faves and then drop the rest
i might. but man i bought so much mango lol
<:ChrisRead:688429724334161987>
<@127991170201681920> so i started collecting manga on top of LN. but then yesterday i smashed thru 5 books in the span it usually takes me to read maybe one full LN. and now im debating going full LN and dropping mango cause damn do they go out fast.
<:AnyaLurk:964795955679485962>
how do u not own them all yet
cant show a girl getting smashed on the cover to unsuspecting kids
yea if u arent logged in and approve seeing 18+ content. its all blurred
they already removed all the 18+ manga and blu rays. huge rip
<:emoji_5:710717148955148328>
The great volleyball barrier
That's the teleport one right?
I know close to nothing about touhou outside of the main 2 and the power 9 ice fairy
That, the yuri. And that drug lord novel are the things that interest me the most
Bride of the barrier master? I felt like I read a manga about a barrier master not long ago. That's an oddly specific thing to double up on
There was a season 2 and 3?
At least it's only 3 novels. So It can have an ending
It's cause anyone can make anything touhou related. It's why it has so many garbage games
Outside of u
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Yea but who reads those
Is say touhou fits games and gacha channels but not anime
Touhou had an anime?
<:botanlaugh:934480552868868126>
Honestly being reincarnated but as your mothers body would be a funny manga to read. Especially if the MCs mom was a milf like the one ash posted

Like how manga are told to wrap it up in 3-5 chapters
<:AylaThink:865861284125474857>
Good question. I assumed LN that get axed are told so they can wrap up the story but I've got not clue
People loved s1
Why would the author say no?
Inb4 they ruin it like trapped in an otome

Side booba is pretty nice tho
Man tenjho tenge could've been so good if half of it wasn't flash backs
<:AylaThink:865861284125474857>
It didn't really need one tho. Everything was wrapped up.
I watched it subbed. I did see the funny dub line tho. Would not have enjoyed it overall dub prob. The main villain is epic In sub
just learned skate the infinity is getting a s2, thats random af
Yea ironically 86 could've done the s1 and 2 thing but they didnt
I view all split cours as one season cause more often than not if u view them as different seasons the first course tends to be shit on its own cause that's not the planned end point for most animes
100 agree. I hate it lol
Maria and her trio needed to be relegated to one season and then retired.
Nah the cast bloat starts in s3 when they keep around the s2 girls
I think my main gripes are just the cast bloat. And the poor handling of the villains (mainly fine)
Just turn off ya brain and enjoy girls beating up monsters to good songs.
<:AylaThink:865861284125474857>
Ymmv I guess
Fair
Season 1 of gear I feel has a crazy amount of exposition dumping but that's just me. Lots of episodes have like half the episode explaining shit to hibiki cause she's dumb af but the audience understood it 3 episodes ago
<:Sitonep:966881149249024071>
But with twice the plot and story
I still hate how bookworm part 1 and part 2 is labeled S1 and 2. Like sure u can make a whole s2 in the span of one season break
Still s1
<:YandereMiyoi:966879554922770473>
Then don't say part 2. Just say 86
<:LiaLove:916136388469071892>
No pls do. It's nice change of pace from u enjoying me suffer
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Woah millhi backing me up. Is there a blood moon tonight
<:kms:790305849863045120>
Nah it's s1 part 1 and part 2. It's really annoying to keep track of which company decides what
~~Imagine calling the second half of s1. A s2~~
Manga is trash. I hate that series now thanks to that

Cool. I love g gundam
I thought japan hated G gundam lol
Hyaku shiki, quebeley and f91 surprised me tho
Fucking strike freedom

Based on a 2018 poll of 1.75 million japan people
I've been debating grabbing the thunderbolt manga honestly
Isn't exia like the most popular gundam design until unicorn?
Makes sense honestly yea. Kits go brrrr
It's so wild to see recap episodes still in this day and age. Especially for 12-24 episode shows
Huge rip
Honestly wish they split gundam seed into two cours. Probably have less reused fight animationa
I wonder what  made them have to split thay into half. Compared to all the 50 ep shows before it
Lmao Don't be bring sunrise into this. They do their own shit. Crazy fuckers
But then shit like bookworm does s1 and 2 making s1 technically trash cause there's no climax and resolution on the "first season"
By the guys who did interspecies reviewed to get the top scenes we all want for this yuri
Anime: the best i can do is having an uncute boy does archery in another world.
Rasengan
The sub is all shouting so I can't imagine the dub getting that wrong lol.
Oh rip OK KO as well.
I forgot infinity train existed. It got 4 seasons huh?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Cross ange is goblin slayer before goblin. Extreme first episode and then never again
I don't remember this episode st all
i thought it was just strike witches s1 and 2
wait when did we get a brave witches
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
wait what
u wont in the movie
This gives me world trigger vibes
Iook forward to getting home and playing more gundam.
<:pepe_clown:852146270553899038>
The moon is too far away to affect mars
<:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
I literally said it could already
<@87512939107450880>
That's a mobile armor beam. Mobile armor weapons are always like 10× stronger than normal weapons lol
I don't really get why they changed that. I guess they didn't want banagher to be a murderer even to other murderers
He actually succesfully convinces loni to stop. But ||the mobile armor is piloted by three people and one of the other pilots shoots her dead|| so he destroys it out of anger/revenge
Yes quite actually. He actually does stuff. Like killing the red mobile armor thing instead of riddhe
Anime  banagher or novel banagher?
Every party needs a pooper
The buster gun of  the wing zero can probably blast thru the armor protection but I don't think nu gundam funnels could
Also beams don't work on barbatos so GG
<:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
We talking the zero system u dingus
I'm more curious if It can keep up with the beastial speed of Mikazuki at the end of s2.  <@87512939107450880>
Yes.
It's fun already solo but man co op play is even better
U shut up
Explain that when it leaves the ground. Curves in the air and trys to hit the Tryon 3
What is he doing irl when this happens
Reppaku Ken. Has him punch the ground to spawn fire. I'm sorry what
Also how does any of sekai school of martial arts work? Outside of the first punch. They make close to no sense
Yea sekai and mc fucker in the 00 suit can do whatever bullshit they want for as long as they want.
Powered?
I know it's not a command I just don't remember the actual title lol
When fumina went from gm command to SD gundam. I was so pissed
Let them have full suits dammit
Why does she use an SD. Why do a majority of the girls use SD in build aeries. It's so annoying
Why is there a lady Kawaguchi out of nowhere. This is a supposedly esteemed title
I'm about to dive into try but so many little things irk me that whoever worked on it did not give a fuck about the og
<:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
Also if the perfect gundam is perfect. Why is there a perfect gundam II and III
I hate how they gave him the red warrior. Like he was the zeon Suit guy. Now he plays for the feddies
And honestly the strike is the best gundam from seed
Japan loved seed. So no surprise there.
<:PuddingWut:809764285420535819>
Zeon ms. Zeon ms. Gundam 00 ms. I'm sorry what
<:SayoriCry:790305850492583966>
The kaempfer vs strike in the op is the biggest tease man
I don't either. I liked the kaempfer more. The fight itself was a good watch at least.
Black exia being a literal entire episode for just a fight was really good too even if the finisher is goofy
Or amazing zaku vs full package
Fenice vs strike is probably the best fight
Sengoku astray fight is easily the worst fight of og build
It was just too gimmicky for my liking. Tho I did enjoy most fights where the glasses boi got to zombie fight as his robot keeps breaking mid fight
Tryon 3 > everything else
Heck the best episode of try is you rooting for the MCs to lose.
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I think try was super boring halfway honestly. Seikai still going on about being a beginner and need to learn still as he fights the champion toe to toe. Was one of the dumbest things I've ever seen
OG Divers had some piss poor animations outside of like 2 maybe 3 key moments
I miss the good old days
It kinda hurts to look at. Like it's just overdesigned af

Is it weird I like this more than bow it actually looks in gbf
His shield looks like a fist almost
I love that the og looks better than the customized red warrior
G-reco makes sense at least
<:PuddingWut:809764285420535819>
What is plamo kyoshiro
<:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
I have literally never heard it called that. Always IBO lol
Then is the perfect gundam III based off the gundam mk 3?
<:PuddingWut:809764285420535819>
G what now
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Makes me sad some people who worked on zoids did it. I don't remember zoids sucking that much
O was so bored lol
How was it? I stopped at 4 episodes
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Who remembers kyoykai senki
There's a single stage in battle alliance that plays the fucking music and I hate it
All I know is. Nobody at sunrise knows what good jazz is and now I must be tormented if thunderbolt is in any compilation game
Who knows
Maybe it's a company policy? They could think cg is the future
<@258455337995075585> I still find it funny that the battlelogue for divers has the finale with mc of rerise and the champion. Mc of the og isn't even in it. Yet the poster girl from divers is.
An I gave an example of a good hand drawn that had budget thrown at it
Yea but u asked if it was budget vs hand drawn
Most of divers is trash outside of like the first Trans am vs big zam
Build og and most of try look pretty good.
I'd assume budget cause thunderbolt movie is 4k hand drawn Cels and that shit is beautiful
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Also the lacking budget makes me sad cause barely anyone got a cool scene outside of the MC gundam.
The plot takes way too long to kick in
<:Excism:966866687053942794>
Rerise got really good near the end but Jesus that first half if rerise is so boring
<:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
How does it curve to hit
It still said like puru even tho it's spelled ple right?
Apparently elpeo ple and ple two were playable in gundam vs zeta gundam which had their correct names before dw gundam messed it up. I had to check cause I remember them being in it lol
<:AnyaLurk:964795955679485962>
So is the reason there's 12 clones of her is cause it was a monthly magazine so you'd see 12 copies in a year
I looked up the wiki out of curiosity
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
The 80s was wild
Lemon People was one of the very first lolicon magazines, with the first issue's cover stating that it "had the monopoly on lolicon comic content in 1982"
I remember full frontal saying that
Oh right ple twelve

<:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
The og gundam guy
This looks like the other stuff that's been done by the gundam guy. Melua has shown it before
U can force Mquve to send ramba ral the latest Doms instead of goufs. Preventing his death.
Like if you capture the gundam early in one of the games. You actually get char breaking away from zeon to join the EFSF
I've always wanted to play them to see all the what if scenarios.
Yes
U think so too huh?
<:AnyaLurk:964795955679485962>
If char never killed garma. Which would've made degwin not retire from grief and give all the power to gihren. Do you think zeon would've been different?
If only the zabi family didn't fuck it up
Zeon deikun was right all along!
Or steal the charter
<:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
Why didn't the efsf just u know. Nuke the Vista foundation.  Problem solved
Was it to have power over the efsf?
Why did the vist foundation feel the need to hide it? It's not like major conflicts happened until 79 years later
Like Loni being convinced by banagher to stop fighting and her own family shoots her dead
Sounds like it
Banagher anime is kinda a bitch compared to novel banagher
Banagher kills more people in the novel
Some MS never show up
Isn't that to show even tho she's seen the absolute worst in people she still believes in humanity?
Yes
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I'm still waiting for that gundam isekai novel to be translated or made into an anime
<@99695384296701952> random question. Are minovsky particles the reason we really never see homing missile weapons in early UC stuff? I feel like that would be a very effective weapon towards bipedal robots
Did my autocorrect change something
?
<:ElfneinAAA:672437636362665984>
Super gun only wins
Sgow?
<:pepe_clown:852146270553899038>
I might enjoy those since u can't physically see him most of the time
If it makes cypher feel any better. I have been collecting the light novels
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~Shouldn't be too hard since he's like the shortest gundam.~~
Victory is such a strange entity. It's so far into the future it could've just been an AU and nobody would've batted an eye

Japan kids need to aspire to being jotaro at 17
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I do choose to avoid animes I find the MC uggo.
Juggling multiple people's affection sounds exhausting
<:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
I couldn't care less. A harem would be hell irl
When the MC doesn't appeal to me it's hard to care. Sorry cypher
But that's just my superficial reason to never trying accel world.
<:pepe_clown:852146270553899038>
That would be cool if he looked like the same anime chars. He looks like he got ripped from a diff anime lol.
Why do u remember the official data of a random chars heifht
<:PuddingWut:809764285420535819>
Why do u know that off the top of your head
And isn't 2 feet tall
Where he gets a normal proportioned body
They go into a cyber world right
<:AylaThink:865861284125474857>
How much of accel world is in the game world vs irl? Cause I hate the pig mc irl
Gotcha. Makes sense. Such a convenient particle to exist lol. Thank you melua
Oh derp. I didn't even consider a typo lmao
<@99695384296701952> do you have any information on X? I figure I would at least ask
As someone who never watchdd X. I've always been curious what made it get shortened. Were the chars boring? Or the plot confusing. Or not enough giant robot action.
I hate it
Forgot sao got another movie lol
Man I thought u were calling the ordinal scale movie good for a second and I was about to throw hands.

<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
I always set upload to none lol
I still laugh at the antagonist dropping like 2 stories to block an imaginary shot and land with no issues to his body onto concrete
<:pepe_clown:852146270553899038>
At least they are consistent with their inconsistencies
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
I thought that was alo
I use utorrent myself but no clue if that's still good
But that's also cause it's hyper unrealistic for the sake of telling a story. Like the og sao
People rate animes and 95% of them are unfinished
<:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
Most LN are unfinished so what's the point
<:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
You've read elaina, average abilities,  and I'm in love with a villainess
Tho there's one girls route who you can't do until u beat the game once. Her route feels the most complete? But even then It still bugs me how it ends
Princess waltz feels unfinished. Like it needed a sequel VN or something
It's easily in my top 3 LN reads atm.
Fock u. This series is hilarous
20 year old Princess' nation goes to ruin and the prince of another nation that she likes beheads her for the people because of the nobilities neglect. She wakes up as a 12 year old again. Plans to avoid dying again with the knowledge of her old diary from her past life. But she's kinda stupid. And fails forward. The embodiment of mission FAILED  *successfully*
About damn time
Hype!
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh I have no clue. Just seeing level 5 involved makes sense for the mediocrity. Especially a higher up
Fucking why
The story was written by the president of level 5 video game company.
It all makes sense now
<@699397350736658513> I figured out why gundam age is so bad
My monster secret.
<@331908049822547978>
As the series progresses, Asahi and Youko begin dating, and accidentally becomes pregnant with Asahi's child after regularly sucking his blood, unaware that for a vampire, sucking a person's blood has the same effect as sexual intercourse. That's... interesting. <@258455337995075585> <@979049315622326322>
<:COPIUM:882305580423843920>
And we are lik in the denial phase.. like all those people she killed are bad right? Killing that mother and her child was needed right?
Forreal. Why do the poopy isekai get animes but the really good villianess stuff doesnt
Lol same
I miss our music time

Easily my favorite singer atm. Even more so than cocoa
This song is what made me fall in love with suzuna
<@722121666641133608> https://youtu.be/ZcBMj7_Er80 <@331908049822547978>
But yea 
Suzuna has some really beautiful songs
Iori usually belts out bangers or things you can bop your head to
VESPERBELL makes duets of originally solo songs which is really cool and their voices are very diff from each  other
It's so good
https://youtu.be/c3MrIZ7A5_0<@722121666641133608>  4th girl
Than something like aot
I think her voice better fits slower more emotional songs personally
Let me get my 4th favorite since u know cocoa
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Well then listen to the other two

i have a thing for purple haired girls?
I forget the song but it's legit all in English but u can't even tell cause of the singer pronouncing words
<:snekwoah:854100552773533757>
Lol the worst part is when u get the lyrics to a jp song and then see all the English lyrics u couldn't tell were even English
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm really enjoying these dual language vtubers able to string English and Japanese effortlessly together in a song. And not having that painful Engrish pronunciation
<:HuTaoAYAYAY:806234426572668949>
Also the song I posted is so fucking good
I listen to vtubers singing
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I dunno. I'm not musically inclined
Maybe a collab? Or a song they have
<@250295696714891285> https://youtu.be/-t8Za0T1T8M

<:doge:496780220309962772>
<@!222517038042710017> it makes me laugh cause the brown hair has such a deep voice in the song but her vtuber personality is so high pitched in comparison
each one has their own version of the duet on their channel
neat idea

Miona and suzuna too
They did zwei wing if I remember correctly
Yea they did but no solo songs from saki.
At least cocoa and suzuna are there
Would've been cool to see saki sing a symphogear song with her deep voice but rip
She's a good singer. A majority of the girls picked are great
Better than radiant force at least
It lacks the aggresiveness that makes the original appealing but it sounds fine
https://youtu.be/GDmf9f5l1wg <@263534352422404096>

Cocoa's radiant force she already did on her channel is much better
<:prinnydead:865323948489179167>
https://youtu.be/AEDcGudlebk <@222517038042710017> <@250295696714891285> if cocoa does bye bye lullaby at any point. Ima die
I think she has 2 or 3 left
Gekkou no tsurugi is one of the last ones lol
I wonder what cocoa will do when she runs out of Nana Mizuki songs to do lol
Gotcha
I think it won't be nearly as good as the og. The girl has a soft high pitch tone normally in her songs she's posted
Where did u Pre-order from
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
