So many Symphogear fans! Yay!
Hello!
Alright, thank you so much!
Did anyone see the preview pictures for the next episode on Twitter? I was already hyped for Ep. 9, and now the hype meter is off the charts.
Just watched the episode! It was awesome, but I have so many lingering questions! Were the Gears destroyed? If they were, will Miku join them now on missions and stuff?
Please let there be a sequel series or a movie of some sort to answer all of our lingering questions!
I so wanted Miku and Hibiki to kiss.
Didnâ€™t think so. It was an idea though.
I just thought of something: what is the main character of the series is not Hibiki, but actually Miku. Her introducing Hibiki to Zwei Wing and inviting her to their concert was what started Hibikiâ€™s involvement in the first place. Someone may have already thought of this.
Do I need to set up an altar? ðŸ˜„
Now Iâ€™m wondering what they would look like as Transformers....
I would be okay with a crossover between the two.
Quick, someone do fan art of that!
I can see why. Her Azure Flash is reminiscent of lightning. Which would put Maria as Saturn. And Chris is most definitely Mars. She would make a pretty good god of war.
Hibiki would be the sun and Miku would her moon (the moon reflects the sunâ€™s light, like how Miku is Hibikiâ€™s sunflower). Kirika would be Mercury (the winged X-Drive helmet). Shirabe would be Venus. I am not sure which Tsubasa and Maria would be.
What are the classical planets?
