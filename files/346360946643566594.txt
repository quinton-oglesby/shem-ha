Oh hi 
How do I properly introduce myself?....
Mm.....
Umm
I like using Discord 
I like Symphogear 
Here I am. Pleased to be here and meet you all/ .w.
Welcome/
Nice Kirby pic
Well, you know what I say
Nothing better than watching a good series about singing lesbians with superpowers
Yo guys. Allow me to introduce you to Relle, a good friend of mine I decided to bring here.
He really likes Symphogear, still hasn´t watched AXZ tho, and will fight anyone who says Chris is not best girl ~~which is why we fight everyday~~

Anytime Hibiki and Miku appear on-screen in a nutshell
Pics like that one are what make me feel good when I need it
~~Who hasn´t, tho?~~
That´s lot of effort put thinking for something someone surely did for the lulz

With everyone looking exactly the same they do normally
Jail is just a place
Isn´t Shirabe waaaaay younger than him?
I think you skipped the most important question
ay lmao
Yeah. Thank you
Ooh!
Will do. Thanks!
People. Do me a solid, please
Anyone got pics of Miku all grown up?
It´s not like he wouldn´t do that as training too
‘Cause...you know...
It’s kinda weird having her singing the same songs regular Bikkie has
Shouldn’t Edgebikki have her own dark-y song?
Speaking of that
Ayy 
She’s singing ~~crawling in my skin~~ I am all of me
I stand corrected, then . .)
Hmm
I don’t know the details fully well, I don’t even have the game, but wasn’t Edgy!Bikkie supposed to have an enormous hatred towards Noise for all the stuff that have happened in her life?
What about the Noise?
(Because you know....against the Noise and stuff)
Servant: Hibiki Tachibana (Alter)
Class: Avenger?
So..
Would it be ¨*Man-doka*¨ or ¨*Man-oka*¨?
What the hell
That guy looks like he has seen some sh*t
