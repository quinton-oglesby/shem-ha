AAAAAAAAAAAA
we need our main couple to get married and *stay* married

Kirika is literally Desscythe

Ordinal Scale is probably Reki at his most improved
Yeah
basically the gun nut who wrote Kino’s Journey
by Sigsawa
GGO:A is a spin-off
Reki’s at least trying to improve
i mean
that one is good
how about GGO:A
also the gaming memes
There’s an authenticity to the battle royale setup
But GGO:A is a promise of what SAO could do if others were allowed to write for it
OS is Reki at his most improved
anyway
Partner Eevee is OP, yes
