SAKURA  RIDER  DECADE

Sakura as Rider

so I turn a throwaway Fate joke into reality
like how certain people think vaccines is bad
well, oppinions can be wrong
you can say whatever you like, mr. "I'm not even old enough to drink"
whatever
sure
uh huh
you're just being pretentious
umm, no?
wow

mr. "I never saw bewbs in rl"
ur brain iz in the wrong spot
please lewd

its right there
So boob shadow?
or is your horniness talking rn?
what the bionicle frick does boob line means?
depends
no problem
Ooowwwhahahahah look at the cwute boye
If they are bunny girl, yes
If they are bunny for real, nah
Depends
No problemo
Probably fabric wrinkle
I just worked on art and whatnot since 5th grade and got used to it, but no pro
Im not a pro
Lmao
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Your eyes playing tricks and your mind trying to be an art critic despite not enough practical experience under it to judge things
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Oh sure
Tee hee
Mr I Noticed The Boob First
Sure
~~because u horny~~
basically, yeah
a loose button up should NOT conform to the boob curvature near-perfectly like that
here

Flying Witch and Amanchu have normal clothes being skintight
since its an actual skintight suit
nobody cares for Darling tho
sure, the girls are fully clothed, but those clothes are skin tight
Flying Witch and Amanchu does the tight clothes tricks a lot
yep
like an Eva plugsuit
a presence of a boob line would mean that the clothes are skin tight
No, not stretch
so loose casual clothes+leaning back means no boobline
like, near skin tight
since that would mean the clothes would CLING to the boobs
the "boob line" phenomenon is actually super rare irl
and the breast has to be bigger
and the angle where the press would be evident is a bit more to the right
yeah, that means that at that angle with that line of motion, the boob pressing won't be as present
ok, so you notice how in the first image, she was leaning back and trying to be coy>
And try to do only small changes
So I scratched that idea
Buuuuuut Dessy and my viking friend would revolt
You can technically turn it into discount Fallout if you want
It is also mallable
Yes
translated the song "Do You Remember Love" into Vietnamese on a whim

its not the best paint tool in general, but its the easiest for drawing with a mice, so yeah
so anyways, busted out Paint Tool SAI

was trying to make an ice-themed M logo

lmao

where you aren't forced to make a YT account to comment
so you must be a post-Google+ era
ah
have you never tried commenting on YT?
I was one of those people back in Google+ days
its literally a requirement to comment
eh, its nothing much
I lazily slapped together a thing in mmd

SAKURIDER DECADE

Sakura as Rider

I made a joke thing in Fate into a real thing
bruh moment
ok so






sweet
and that one dude's home is past midnight by now
technically 1998, but parents flubbed the paper due to fear that my illness isn't going to allow me to catch up
born in 1999
or any more than 1, really
not really any that can come
since Dad has been leaving me home alone for more than a decade
I thought I would have gotten used to it by now
and by myself
but hates the fact that Im alone
so I kinda like the freedom
went to the countryside for some days
my parents arent home rn
like
yeah
have you ever liked being alone, but hates having no one around you?
guys
I dont even like my parents, shouldnt I be happy?
this is pretty paradoxical
is something wrong with me tho?
still
hmm
even though I enjoy the freedom
and now suddenly everytime they're out of the house for like, more than two days, I get kinda lonely
dad has been conditioning me to staying home alone for like, a decade
I don't get it
like
2:03 AM, actually
For once, I wish this was just a boomer mistaking the scene in the beginning of Skyrim. This is just eugh
Eesh
Those exists, yeah, forgot
Where does he even get that stuff
Its uncensored, right?
So i was right to be angry
Yeah
Guys, is it fair for a kid being dragged off his ass early in the morning to go buy some damn bread, coming back with fully garnished and whatnot but then he gets chewed out for "taking too long" and berate that it isnt even "blank bread", despite the kid asking a second time before going out to buy it?
We are talking spiritually and culturally important vs. Scientifically and mathematically important
When you misquote the bible, some people get mad
But when you mis-identify your altitude, a fucking dozen or so people dies
the matter isnt even about translation at all
No it isnt
Protip: Sometimes, faster isnt better
that was a subtle roast, Yumi
in which field? Political?
doesnt mean that in aeronautics and nautical, imperial still has its importance
I known only metric my whole life
Im Vietnamese
Yes, and I applaud it for that
but the maths and the eyes working on them aren't
one is bendable, ever-changing and ever evolving
again, this is Culture v. Science
doesn't make it true
You can scream that God said the earth of the center of the universe
not IS
SEEN as, Yumi
What if the real phonic gains were the friends we made along the way?
~~everyone gets X-Drive~~

***THE YEET CANNON***
Naw
~~fuck it, use a halo~~
I think Revolutionary Girl Utena would be a good watch for anyone on this server
nothing~
~~lets go watch old anime again~~
what a documentary is
do you know
bruh
...
...
so prolly isnt even around the net anymore
and fucking obscure as shit
it was apparently vietnamese made
cant remember
that was a thing
no joke
up until him reviving
my first manga was about Jesus Christs' story
my first anime ever was Pokemon
||Oh no we have to save the w- hey lets save this shallow generic useless dude who keep charging into supernatural battles despite being a normie||
||And needed to be brought back||
||dumbass legit died||
and later he becomes a burden
he sorta is
he was literally useless 75% of the time lmao
bruh
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
D I C
Koucha Oji was weird
hell, I even read a Shoujo manga
I literally watched a Shoujo thing every other day
no like, it was FLOODED
...I just realized that my childhood was FILLED with Shoujo stuff
I remember the dubbed openings too
like, we VNs used to have Kobato, Fruit Basket, Bubu Chacha, Cyborg Kuro-chan, Bakugan, Doraemon, Cardcaptor Sakura and so much more. But nowadays sindicated anime is all but ded
Vietnam used to have great anime lineups, but now its chinese kid shows and rehashed american children tv
~~too bad the only mecha anime that were shown in Vietnam was Daigunder, which is a show with shit tier animation and no budget~~
I grew up watching Dragonball Z Kai both with English AND with Vietnamese dub
I mean, from a lot of mecha nerds I know, watching it in whole is needed because character development, plot details and intricacies are needed since the movies cut them, but slogging through the jank is a necessary evil
and yes, this VA/Singer did almost 30 songs AND voices
GORGEOUSLY dubbed anime ops
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMWgumVUCEM
at least we got something in return

I can't even
we have generic kungfu man #1, generic kungfu man #2, A GIANT COMBINING ROBOT, bewbs, bewbs with glasses and a gun
the gacha is wild
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_E01sgrlCI
its recognized as a national nostalgic icon too
and what's more
one of the issues have him straight up fight Metroplex

the ripoff version even got a gacha game
also, we literally ripped off Go-Lion/Voltron once
by advising the king with tactics in the wars, inventing new revolutionary stuff and being an excellent diplomat
and he basically became a famous hero and stuff
like, he was literally a child of a god and a virgin
also, there were a long series of manga about a boy genius who was the smartest around

the covers can get wild
kinda like a weird, PSA version of Doraemon
I still remember a Vietnamese-made manga about various kids running into toruble and a blue fairy helping them tho
as you watch Mecha, you'll know certain people have certain vibes
and robots that kick all kinds of ass as their pilots also do
his trademark is awesome people who can kick robot ass on foot
and Giant Robo movie new anime thingy I forgot
since he was also the director for G-Gundam and Shin Mazinger
tbh, letting him off was a bad choice
iirc
but erm, he was having plots going a bit slow
and did his job wonderfully
mind you, he was AWESOME
since the director got fired off
off
REALLY
and the episodes after 3 is
then again, 13 eps
Getter Armageddon has a dub, I think
welp, gaiking didnt have dub
Or Shin Mazinger, that one's a goorvy. ~~just play Episode 1 last~~
if you are patient
you can also aim for Gaiking reboot
for supers
New Getter is good, but Kotetsushin Jeeg is much more "friendly"
reminder that God Sigma is awesome

we'd like the vanilla cool real robot who for some weird reason needs a fucking support system to carry around a wimpy rifle for it pls
and removing the detachable deal
also, I will never forgive them for replacing the Hucks with Exbeins
LITERALLY ALL OF THE EDGES
HEDGEHOGbein
The fuckin
GOD

that will never be not funny to me
hijack Ichika's harem
Hibiki managed to legit
~~except when its Hibiki hijacking harems~~
yeah, I just don't like harem tropes in general
and started ~~wanking harem boy instead~~
to be fair, I think they have dialed it back already in OGMD


eternally done with life
he just look
into this

but they managed to turn this beautiful man

more OG Inspector bashing here
also
the hair is a bit much
tho
Genesic's design is kino
yes
~~sad Caro noises~~
and let us remember that ~~some people are eternally midget~~
she still cute
to be fair
~~ah, she drank from the same water cooler as Araki and Nana~~
especially smart one that can kick ass
waht? cute lolies are cute
~~Latooni's pantyshot was a godsent tho lmao~~


there is also THIS
and um
half of his humans scares me
at all
cant design humans
and his students/him
yeah
also, Obari is your best hype overgod and mecha designer, but his students are even more horny than he is
try out Shin Goji yet?
who likes Ultraman
Anno - flip flop auter
Yasuhiro Imagawa - the "pilot kick ass on foot" guy, has strong wuxia vibes at times, and awesome on-foot fights
Masami Obari - makes you think still images are animated and even when you know that its a still image you dont care because it looks amazingly awesome. Also, his mech designs are muscly and human-like. ~~and he is also horny~~
~~B-Daman~~
and long necc
just LEGG
no ankle
like
Linebarrel's designer's fetish comes thru tho
they look so chunky and imposing
and the vangray
tbf, I love the Granvang
best oneechan type
Sagiri is FUCKING BAE tho
kinda lame ngl
the main OG in T looks
the ending is bs tho
but its decent
Might Gaine is fairly vanilla
Nothing come up that remotely looks like her style
Like, I tried earching thru Pixiv, the boorus and whatnot
~~alt world Maria and Serena looks golden~~
Also
And tags apparently refuses to show her
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
Despite being voiced by
Period
Sadly, she gets NO fanart
From the Black Rock Shooter game
SZZU
~~working/kitbashing art of a character with NO ART is hard~~
as close to that design as possible
not just term
I need art
halp
so plz
so its hard to get references
because this character has *no fucking art*
basically. just need art of girls who share similar design (armor notwhitstanding)
it also looks kinda drill-ish
i dont have the word to describe the sidelock thing
look at it

no, look at the sidelock
need some material for a piece im working on
any anime girl with hair similar in style to this?
