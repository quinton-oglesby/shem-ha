There is no moe blob better than Yui chan
:+1:
Yeah for sure, sleep apnea is no joke
I have had a lazy day <:enbBad:448163950803156992>
That sucks ibu
Is this where we discuss horrible things like equality and basic human decency? Kappa
That was a really good read. Its troubling how consumers seem to view privacy as something that is acceptable to exchange for convenience.  Also how consumer habits are being exploited by companies so effectively and transparently is also troubling.. Regulatory action needs to come in order to protect the public from the negative externalities resulting from decayed privacy.
Lol great analogy for 4chan
/pol was a breeding ground for a lot of the disinfo and harmful rhetoric which poisoned the 2016 pres elections in the US so its safe to say the containment failed
Now its just nice guys who hate women with a burning passion
Theyve really coopted that phrase in recent years incel used to denote people who were physically and mentally handicaped to the point of being involuntarily celebate
That is very true everyone I guess I didnt consider that
Yeah thats my impression too, which is odd because the anime space is regarded as a place for social outcasts and the like. One would think there would be more inclusion and acceptance because of that
So is anime / otaku / weeb culture toxic in that regard or is it just a vocal minority of people who are either ignorant or insensitive enough to casually use language like that?
Still not embedding lel
Yeah not much to say other than I agree, its pretty fucked up to call a person a trap
Ahhhh okay my bad
Didn't they answer their own question? "What am I supposed to call boys hur dur?"
Mmmh that is a conundrum
Lol true
But the solution isn't disallowing people from holding ideas, its about placing an importance and societal value on individuals being educated, being exposed to new and different places / ideas and encouraging open, fact based discourse
Ibu that is a cute new ava btw <:mogenkGasm:449281074636390420>
But yes overall he is nothing but a hype man
SpaceX isnt that bad either in terms of raw innovative potential
Probably the best play haha
Unless they crack one off first
Yeah that is a good way to put it
Language has been weaponized, and the US population isn't well educated enough to neutralize it.
"Unmasking antifa" what about the klansman in hoods, GOP? Arent they a more dangerous and historically despicable group than an organization built around fighting facists?
<:enbSexy:448163946092953600>
Yeah there's no way to disengage from a convo in the car that's rough
No head pat emotes but kisses
<:enbKiss:448163948185780224>
Parents have the uncanny ability to do that
<:enbExcited:448163957295939584>
Azusa has the best life, being fed snacks by the keions

Yes the second season of code geass has been pretty underwhelming compared to S1, at least FMA has been a consistent level of quality
Hahaha
<:rooBooli:399827513359990785>
But I cant figure out which one I want to finish first
I somehow watched FMA brotherhood and Code Geass concurrently to where I'm now near the close for both series
