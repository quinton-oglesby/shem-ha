it's amazing
I suggest Ghost Stories dubbed

Wait I don't recall seeing that in the UBW movie
I mean the actual "fight" itself. The buildup to the final bit was great
...and the lying second opening showing Shirou and Archer fighting
Except the actual archer/berserker fight
I'm pretty sure that Berserker was ||somehow killed by Shirou/Saber stabbing him once with Excalibur and it somehow counting for a bazillion kills???||
how do you do spoiler tag agian
I prefer Fate/CG Dragon
Oooh
wait when is this I don't recall that
wings of what
wings?
for anyone
