AHA I DID IT, LIKE, 8 TRIES LATER
*How do you even get Transparency that's only kinda there??*
Why Discord
AHHHH it kept the damn background
<@!203444794737950720> I love the emote. So like the OG Chris one, I did this:
Just get so many boosters we can convince Discord to add it.
<a:ChrisPeek:702988022479847544>
I did a little thing with the Chris one
Ahhh now that I see that emote
It's a good problem to have haha
~~and forgive me if I recommend Symphogear it's a habit~~
No clue how active I'll be, but ay, if you ever need anime to watch, ping me lol
<:ikkib:235621294920433664>
Huh, you aren't wrong haha
I'd love to get better at like, modelling super intricate mechanical stuff though
Considering I've only really made like... 2 3D scenes in the past, not too shabby if I don't say so myself
So, for a school project, I needed a 3D model of a robot. So I kinda wound up modelling a Gundam?

Oh yay, glad ya liked it ;D

That edit's dope, tough to beat the XV cover art
3_skip
Forgive me if this command doesn't work, I think I need to use it. Never used it before lol.
Made these like 3 years ago by photoshopping stuff together, using the GX CD covers as a base

"SuRpRiSe MeChAnIcS"
Always nice when companies either don't make mistakes like that at all, or if they do, they fix it instead of just pulling an EA or whatever.
So they looked at that and thought "wow okay, we don't want people doing this." and they removed it from the game in favour of being able to get palette sets in a variety of ways and you can choose colours like that.
I remember uh, the Warframe developers, they once had a system in place where you could pay some premium currency to get a random roll of colours for your pet, and some random guy pulled that lever like 200 times in one go.
Honestly the only gacha game I can honestly say I recommend is Honkai Impact 3rd, just because it kinda has a bit more to it in terms of gameplay and is fairly generous in terms of giving players draws and the like, but I do agree that a lot of gacha games are just ***horrific*** when it comes to just being gambling with a fresh coat of waifu on top or whatever. There is no known universe where I WOULDN'T rather Honkai be a cool anime Bayonetta clone like it already is, but where it's just like a fully fleshed out paid title.
and a final one to end the loop
a repeat
the initial episode
I'd say the endless 8 shoulda just been 3
If a show is taking itself seriously it should try to avoid doing that sort of thing at all costs, but like, something less serious in that regard like Kill la Kill, it's probably a benefit for the sake of rule of cool, since that's what the show runs on.
Even then, it depends on the show that's doing that, now that I've said all that
It can be cool, but it makes for less interesting characters, and fights in general, since you know the protagonist can just pull the win out of their ass if they feel like it
But mainline SAO likes to have Kirito solve problems solo despite having a team to rely on in a lot of situations, or artificially introducing teamwork here and there, a lot of situations are just solved by getting angry lol. So I appreciate the vast majority of the first half of Alicization having him work with an equal to do things, though it didn't totally fix the issue. It's just back to the pandery OP fanservice stuff
She never really got godly either, in fact I don't think there was ever any actual skill progression throughout the series? Just some backstory reasoning as to how she got to the point she's at now
in episode 1 alone, she was shown to be pretty talented, but would've gotten her ass kicked without proper teamwork and guidance from... M? That his name?
I saw a lot of complaints about LLENN being another dumb OP protagonist, but
Yeah that part was definitely cool
with characters that had pretty good reasons to be there, doign what they were doing. Sure some aspects were a bit over-the-top, but it wasn't over-the-top to really pander to anyone, and it didn't ruin anything, so it's fine
but still serious, with consequences and whatnot
not WORLD ENDING stakes
I rather enjoyed that they managed to set up stakes, but
Yeah, definitely
skipping content just to get to the cool stuff
I feel like it always gets caught up on the power fantasy thing over actual storytelling
Admittedly with a great author and studio 3Hz to back it up
AltGGO is probably the best SAO currently released, and it's a spinoff
The final arc of season 2 was really good
SAO always greatly improves when Kirito is removed from the equation, funnily enough
Yeah I can see that.
And SAO is definitely *mostly* hated because it's cool to hate SAO.
Yeaaaaaaaah
even little things lol.

"*We need to be quiet!*"

>Violently blows iron door off its hinges

"*Alright let's go. Remember to be quiet.*"
I do agree about SAO btw, hell, I don't even consider it to be the worst show on the planet like some do, it definitely isn't the worst by any means. I can entirely see why it's popular, and if people like it, all the power to them. The narrative issues will forever bother me personally though.
I've recommended anime in another community for like... 5ish years now? And I'll occasionally run into people that just look at my rec to them and outright say "anything else that doesn't look good enough"
If they have solid reasons not to, then by all means, avoid the show, but like
Really the only thing I'd ever really ask from people is to give new things a chance. Being narrow-minded is both pretty annoying to deal with, and generally bad for the person that's narrow-minded since it's just closing off doors to themselves for no real reason other than them being stubborn.
I despise Danmachi, but I'd never put someone down for enjoying it, I know it's popular.
There's nothing I hate more than people bashing other people's opinions like that. Disliking something is fine, but like... just don't be a dick and accept that people have different interests and whatnot.
Whether I consider something to be good or bad doesn't really come into play when someone else is saying whether they like it or not, it's just their opinion.
All that being said
Meanwhile something like Glasslip I will consider to be bad, because it was pretty horrible at doing what it set out to do, that being a sort of supernatural-y romance drama thing.
Hell, something obviously pretty trashy, like Interspecies Reviewers. Am I interested in it at all? No, almost definitely not, I'd never want to watch it. But I don't consider it bad, because it was pretty darn good at being *exactly* what it wanted to be, with some neat character designs and animation to boot, etc.
So like uh
Just repeating what I said in the other channel, while I can 100% enjoy something like 3-gatsu no Lion, I can also enjoy the crap out of something like Punchline.

The way I see it, something is good, if it's good at what it set out to do.
that thing
er, High Guardian Spice
I think I remember hearing it was a separate money pool from the whole Guardians of Spice fiasco
Does CR use the money they get from subscriptions to fund these, or is it a separate thing?
https://twitter.com/CanipaShow/status/1325910659578515456
not being great, not being awful
I imagine it's just one of those things that exists
If this EX-ARM theme song is anything to go by, the music is garbo, and the animation is *entirely* bad
And the 2D animation isn't horrible, sometimes?
the music seems cool at least?
just watched the Gibiate trailer and I mean
I don't think Gibiate is the worst actually, but I can absolutely see this going under that
Nice van
<a:KanadeBlood:677949388227608586>
https://youtu.be/0jCPQe9g-TE
It looks... so *good*
anyone here seen the EX-ARM trailer, that new crunchyroll original?
Oh man
Not a fan?
I learned to read them in a sort of weird way. The numbers mean things, but not what the numbers say they mean lmao
Lost faith ever since Granbelm
Indeed haha
Isn't Vladlove airing too?
Iffy MAL score but god knows those can't always be trusted. I'll prolly give it a few episodes to try it out
Ahhh that one, I meant to check that one out
SK8 looked fun
Beastars is probably a given once I get around to it
There's a bunch of stuff I need to try
Very Flip Flappers
Yess, I love the first episode
In less tragic news though, any of you checked out Wonder Egg Priority? I'm not too sure on how much traction it's picked up yet
Yeah, man didn't deserve this
I love how CR is using their money lol
From the bottom
Just
It's #6 on MAL last I checked.
Hence why the censor is enormous
The noses are probably clipping
So not only can the characters not make a "kissing" face
The models only have a single bone to waggle the jaw around for lip flaps
Not because girls kissed. But because they couldn't animate it.
Its fiery wreck keeps me warm at night
Oh I love this show

I honestly don't even think MHA is bad. It's a solid shounen. Not reinventing the wheel like some people say it is, but it's good at its job.
Look at the obscene amount of Gintama in the top 50
I moderate the KC discord and I can absolutely confirm, elitism is a bit of a bitch over there
I loved Beastars and Great Pretender don't get me wrong, just it'd be nice to see some variety
TONS of Beastars, TONS of Great Pretender, TONS of Jujutsu Kaisen
Like, total
It feels like there's only 6 or 7 shows to choose from out of EVERY poll
Not as bad as some years but wew
Have you seen the 2021 crunchyroll award polls?
Oh entirely
Classics can't really form anymore since everything is so quickly replaced and forgotten
Everything else is left in the dust
It's like ONLY airing things matter
The whole seasonal trend of the last few years is pretty... ehhh to me
Ah, well that sucks
Fair. Didn't Deca Dence get bombed a bit because it was different than expectations?
On a standalone rating, 7 absolutely works
Mind you, by MAL standards, roughly speaking, if it's above 7 it's probably at least okay, and below 7 is probably pretty ehh
Geah season 1 being at 7.03 is a crime
Ahhh, that's fair
Oh man, Strawberry Panic was so aggressively shoujo
Ending got a bit ridiculous unfortunately
Oh yeah, O Maidens was pretty good
Well shit, not cool
Well dayum, cool
Just, as a drama
Planned to watch it honestly LOL
I knew it was a drama
... ~~that had romance?~~
Cliffhangers just entirely kill shows for me, makes me super sad that all the yuri stuff cliffhangs too
Don't remember a romance anime past Tsuki ga Kirei that was particularly good as a romance (and ended)
Ahhh, in that case yeah I uh
Later, did that one end?
Has anything come out since then?
Tsuki ga Kirei? In like 2018?
When was the last time we got a particularly good romance that genuinely just focuses on... being a romance lol
Man, I do love me some romance, but uh
Is a lovely genre
May as well bookmark, see how it goes lol
Does look neat, yeah
This is effectively why I don't even bother with One Piece and whatnot.
Last MHA season I've seen was 3 I believe
I'm heading off to bed I think, but just saying, if anyone needs stuff to watch, feel free to ping me, I love recommending stuff lol
Best of all, it actually does do some pretty good romance stuff
Bit of a strange romcom, but it's pretty fluffy and nice
Seen Momokuri?
Lift-me-ups? Want something light to watch?
I have not seen Rakugo no, but again, it's on my list for sure
All the time.
Ye he's a bit of an elitist dickhead LOL
And I'm especially happy that it's getting a proper re-adaptation
I know a lot of people enjoy it
I try to not pay it too much mind
Basically this on loop
Here we go
Lemme see if I can find some of their rants
Mostly issues with the MC from what I can tell
Has a load of members that just despiiiiiise it in general
I've unfortunately ONLY seen negativity towards fruits basket due to the server I moderate
***Oh no***
I can definitely see that being a thing lol
*Since it was so damn pretty*

https://sakugabooru.com/data/07fed8008a7254364df49f4fa0e11a8d.mp4
and that was an enormous disappointment
Star Driver was another super pretty Bones mecha with romance
Ayy cool. I kinda figured it wouldn't be a masterwork of writing, but does the action and whatnot stand out? I know uh
Figured my chances were good in here, Symphogear tends to draw in mecha fans
Was hoping I could get lucky and find someone that's seen it haha
Ahh that's fine, I know it's a fairly unknown show
I watched a few episodes aaaaaaages ago, can't overly remember why I left it alone after that
Is it any good?
Captain Earth is that, right? It looks pretty as hell, is by Bones, and is an original
I enjoy super robot stuff, it's usually pretty fun
Since I figure someone in here might know
https://tenor.com/view/hi-score-girl-slap-gif-18293116
High Score Girl worked, but it had a lot of 2D mixed in, especially for faces, on top of having a pretty unique style
And Beastars of course
Land of the Lustrous was awesome
I haven't seen anything that has mastered a human 3D model and made it not look kinda weird, but like
Garo as well
I find myself enjoying most shows that do that honestly
They definitelt leaned on the benefits of usint CGI rather than just as a budget trick
Yeah that's true
So I can't even be mad
Actually fantastic
I'd sell a vital organ to get Majestic Prince in some nice 2D, but even then, the 3D animation is like
There's like 6 mechs to go through and they usually launch all of them individually lmao
I love Majestic Prince but man
Some mecha stuff really outstays its welcome with like, launch sequences and whatnot
Ahhh okay, that's good
It's like 1:30 or something lol
But then they did it again in full each episode
It's awesome to see at full length once
Hilariously lengthy
I watched 3 or 4 episodes ages ago, and the only thing I remember was the mech... combining(?) Sequence was like
>Not good
Okay, I've basically found the opinion on Captain Earth that I was looking for earlier haha
Hmmmm

https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2021/02/18-1/symphogear-and-utapri-creator-teases-new-series

man that was great lol
So I finally got around to watching Ninja Slayer
