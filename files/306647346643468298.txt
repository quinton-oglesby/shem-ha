It was very fun
You had, ditzy (Saint Germain), horny (prelati), and cagliostro!
Those three alchemists in the OVA though

The artists I commission from don't care or specify it is okay (except for one) so I usually don't run into that issue.

Though I'm not sure I can call it commercialization or distribution in that context as I am not getting money for it.
So I think it would be okay, but if you wanna ask then that's also good.
I usually ask for a watermarked version if I have such intent as well.
I usually just post the artwork (because in all technicality it is yours) and say who I commissioned to draw it.
Hmm.
It's really pretty
Ahhh
Idk why everyones drawing her like this, but she deserves it
