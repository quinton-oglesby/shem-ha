"Cous... da fuq you doing?"
Uhhhhhhhhh it's just their cousin...
Zaku Gang
This sorta fits
Seems like a series I would have enjoyed
Nice, I might look into them, though I've only watched the original so I'll pretty much only draw from there... assuming there are any
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
"Why would you want white?"
The stupid thoughts that happen while I go back and panel line all my gunpla: Shield sandwich
<:sweats:594244419180429316>
like taken from security footage right after she wrecked half the facility, then looks at the camera and it goes to static
<:CoolNoiseDontLookAtExplosions:673239311876882462>
gjallarhorn goat yay, not sure which is more meme worthy, the original shop or this. Sure the original has its janky flair but this just fits better
I've seen maybe 3 minutes of a friend playing Transistor and can confirm it would fit it
which begs the question: are the leg armor...cuffs(?) really loose?
Oh huh, only now do I realize that, outside of color, all the changes are really in the arms, head, and gear
Grandpa!
Just one more thing I want to add to it is a spot of paint, or maybe even just sharpie, to color the camera blue
*Moderate sigh of relief*
Got reminded of a question I had, is the leg armor meant to have a noticeable gap?
Then almost comically narrow at the torso
Thicc thighs though
Just got skirting that *looks* bulky
Just about to delete then move on to the next unfortunate soul
Mostly done moving, and now begins the desk setup
<:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
<:ammyluv:399008771944349696>
Probably should have gotten some clear paint to lighten this up but it still looks like it'll be an improvement for the Tallgeese
Like shout "HEY! LISTEN" /s
AHAHAHA
<:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>
Barbatos is Barbatos
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh I love that hg zaku, how were the wrists on it for you?
That's pretty good for a high grade of its age
oh is the only sticker the monoeye?
the sideways look of a monoeye is menacing af anyway
It works pretty well
Barbatos ga Barbatos
Ez8 found a...friend. Just got to clean up the panel lines on it
Yooo I've always ignored 30mm since a kit has to have meaning to me but they do look like a fantastic kitbash base.
Yooo I miss Dirty Bomb, literally the only f2p fps I got into.
Ah yes, elasticity
can't leave out the followup Marshmallow, and Lieutenant Sex
mmmm delicious graham cracker
<:RX_BeamSaber:828541186884894730>
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Lockon Lockon
Especially on a RG that's normal
I typically build + add stickers then panel line once it's assembled, largely so I'm not panel lining parts that I probably won't expose
ahh k yeah that makes more sense
Oh was it an hour for the foot in its entirety? Or an hour for just panel lining?
How are you doing it? An hour seems really long to me
100% agree
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
YEAH LET'S GOOO
If you're considering panel lining I found gray to work better than black on the light blue. Now the next step is Ez8 or Guntank
aaaaaa mamiku
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
AHAHAA OGAWA

But it's not... it's a reference to the the synchrogazer music video

Though most are, Chris and Maria are the furthest, though they have accents of their eye color on their gears

Did Chris just take Hibiki's food?

"Taking lots of photos of grandparents in case anything happens"
So they do realize there's some risk involved and still go ahead?
yeah, again, decades ago
had a teacher who had one in the 90's I think, and she said she could hardly hear the music on the headphones they gave her, though I'm somewhat doubtful they were of any decent quality. also was only like 10 minutes iirc
I'd assume, given the context, it's okay to link it here
that and I wouldn't expect a hospital to spend much on them to begin with
Asking those questions is the best way to learn about them, be it through discussion or research.

and now I wait to see this show up on r/nottheonion, this probably won't pass, right?
assuming the auditor is objective, which ones still in business probably are
Forensic accounting is entirely this, yes the numbers can be altered to an extent on the surface, but the alterations can be found relatively easily upon auditing
Temp job till you're main one opens up, learning a skill of some sort, depends on what's available and what you want to do
If you're about to have a sudden influx of free time, finding a constructive way to fill that will help a lot

right, back on topic
no single factor is really enough
alone yes, but they help in 2FA
Biometrics, specifically fingerprint, aren't my favorite as its relatively easy to unlock without consent.
While I don't know the legal situation where you are, in the US there has been legal precedent for law enforcement to unlock devices by simply using someone's finger.
This is mostly where I got the impression of progress

<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
it's minimum barrel and/or overall length iirc
I'm curious how the population density affects that, does the increased density lead to increased violence purely from there being more people who can commit the violence? Or does the murder rate per 100k differ significantly?
Might be in some states but none that I know of
side note: not all calibers are created equal
.50 Beowulf is *not* the famous .50 BMG as an example
what's the caliber limit?
Assuming it's not a bot or someone specifically trying to agitate
I'm less pissed off as I am just saddened for them, for whatever reason they appear to choose to shun anything that challenges their world view rather than entertaining different ideas. That's not the easiest thing in the world though, and they've probably got their own problems/insecurities that they're venting on this.

Didn't talk with her too much, but I do remember having a lot of fun when Shem-Ha first debuted. I haven't been active on the server for a while, but it helped me through some tough times of personal development and her work is an integral part of that. May she have peace now.
Florida please can you not for one minute.
I'm thankful my friend at uni here avoids this because she's old enough, but she hasn't started any of her physical transition and I'm worried what future state legislation could do to prevent that.

I'll just add one more reason as to why I hope to leave the state after graduating.
Hell, to continue the market analogy, abortion is just choosing to not supply when the costs of production are too high.
this is right up there with trains' high speed making women's uteruses fall out or something people were saying in the 19th century
I legit thought this was a shitpost then I saw the channel, wtf
Even the 3PLs I was looking at for an internship are trying to go that route: emphasize how casual the work environment is, it's just an extension of fraternity life.
True, but the idea that they have just sat there unused for decades is more than a little frustrating
Hell some of the wires are still hanging there unused
