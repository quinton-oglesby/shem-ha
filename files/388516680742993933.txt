<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I’ll send some pictures when I get home
I also only paid 9 bucks for it so I am very happy that only the box is beat up
The box was beat but everything inside was in great condition
A nice surprise to wake up to this morning
But then I can’t stare at them happily every day
I don’t even have a shelf so you see my conundrum
Kaiki and Dio, the two that transcend
I really wanna get those Madogatari figures one day, With Kiss Shot wearing AkuHomu’s clothes and all that
I mean that one is just a given, but it’s unfair to pick Kaiki since his simple presence breaks the scales on that best girl list
I’m partial to Homura (nothing wrong btw) myself for Madoka
Except Gaen. She’s the worst
I mean Shinobu is best girl but any Monogatari girl would be best girl in a different show
I just noticed that Black Hanekawa figure, you are clearly someone of fine taste
Unfortunately I have a lot of things that were ruined for me by others
That’s awesome
I have my Majora’s Mask Link and Cardcaptor Sakura nendroids spaces weirdly around my room right now. I’m waiting for Mugi and Mio to come in to actually find a permanent spot for them
Goals honestly
*Peace Peace*
That black-haired girl looks like someone who would do *nothing wrong*
Oooh thank you very much!<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
That looks right to me, thanks!
What is this American garbage
^yes more of that pls
If anyone has any pics of Gungnya, I would very much appreciate it
>tfw you’ll never wake up next to a girl.
I always forget how much the art improved between S1 and G, S1 looks so bad in comparison
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
GX Black Gungnir <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
There’s something about causal clothes that I just love
They apparently also made this gem

I’m a very big fan of this one
She deserves nothing but love

I better not see anyone bullying Elf9 in here
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Why can’t we have nice things
Overthinking is my specialty
Okay so I put way to much thought into this picture to procrastinate studying. I think the artist started to make it after episode 10 of G, and then made assumptions on who would die. Which is why Kiri is dead and we don’t see Maria. Also I think that was the episode he took Shirabe back to their base over the water.
Or the more likely solution, they did it just cause
Kirika doesn’t die. She dess
And then probably stripped her of her clothes
I thought the *one who did nothing wrong* stripped her of her godhood
^referring to Madoka
Not anymore...
The one and only god is of course Haruhi Suzumiya
Organized religion is for normies
WHY SO YOUNG
I’m sorry, isn’t that the Pope’s place
THAT EXPLAINS SO MUCH ABOUT SO MANY SHOWS
Tiny Miku gets it
It’s anime
We don’t know when this was taken so I can give that benefit of the doubt that she’s at least legal in this picture
This picture always brings up too many questions. Why is Kiri dess’d. Where is Maria. Why is Shirabe marrying him? Why is angel dess happy about this? Why did the sword wear a kimono and Chris just wore some of her normal clothes from season 1? It upsets me
I like that last one <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaGay:336657049540755457>
That’s some good dess
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Fair enough <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I hate that I just got why you wanted to do post 52
Arigato!
The movie is so damn good
Idk why I haven’t watched it yet, considering that since I’ve gotten it I’ve rewatched the movie 3 times
I was thinking about watching Das Finale tonight and I’m taking this as a sign from God
I guess
Like the steak sauce
A1, super good
That’s an A1 emote
TIL there’s a German dub
I haven’t seen that movie in years
Blazing Saddles is hilarious
“Pls... Scare the Mio”
These look like they were made to be emotes
Time to go see if any of these are available to purchase online
DMJii doing cute things? Yes please
<@!263983345669505025> I guess I forgot to send this message but thank you!
Does anybody have that picture of Maria sitting at a table alone? I need it to make my friends feel bad about not eating with me
She isn't wrong though, that hat is baller
This one caught my eye
This is all I have on my phone, I got a bunch of screenshots of the show on my computer
I loved it, super cute, lots of good characters, made me feel happy whenever I watched it, had great yuri ships and nice animation. It’s one of my favorite shows of all time
From Trigger’s livestream

But you are entitled to your opinions
If it weren’t for the laws of this land I would have slain thee
She just lacked boundaries and discipline

Shhhhhhh we don’t talk about the dark times
I look at it from an overall viewpoint. S1 and G Chris gets her to where she is, while I actually didn’t like what they did with Kiri too much in G but love her in AXZ and GX so she gets the number 1 spot
I end up having a ranking in every show i watch. Take K-On. I love them all but I love Mugi most then Mio etc
I’m the same as outside, I love them all but I also love some of them a little more or less than others
Second being Zenbu
Maria is my third favorite
I love how Kirby is just with the copy ability
I just want him to do another song
Serena is where
I don’t know why but I have always like a good tsundere. Probably because of Asuka from Eva
My friend hates her because he wanted Carol to absorb her
Happy Birthday to this girl that sounds similar to Bikki
Just gonna go ahead and save that real quick
Yeah my one friend who i have something like a 70% MAL affinity with said he wasn’t a fan while my other friend with 60% really liked it, so it’s a toss up right now
I feel like I won’t like GS, but since I haven’t seen it yet I won’t make any judgements yet
My head canon is that it was drawn right after episode 10 of G and the artist just kind of guessed that this is where they would end up, with a dead Kiri and Maria and such
But that image just kills me to no end. Why is Kiri dead? Why are those two getting married, because he carried her on the water that one time? WHERE IS MARIA
<@!302063351767498752>  here’s the pic I used for my pfp if you wanted it
The most cursed of images
I HATE THIS PICTURE
I’m just calling it now, this design will be better than whatever XDU eventually comes up with for Black Gungnir Ignite
Maria with Tsubasa‘ hair... nice













Diakko dump
As long as she has the anatomy of a SHAFT character she can survive
I haven’t seen anything *too* bad
It seems most people give Kanade the respect she deserves
Be careful Kawakami
<@200030864497704960> those are incredible!
I am home and the image is on my computer arigato
I was able to find a better quality version when I got home, but I still needed the original
Arigato Kanade-sama
On mobile right now this someone remind me to put this on my computer when I get home


Besties!

Hayasaka is best for the uninitiated
They even included best girl

The quints are all so cute tbh

The manga is much better, but the anime has a great ed



Lowkey waiting for someone to draw Kiri in that outfit

Nino gives me life

WIFEY
<@125353790537728001> you scared me there for a sec, I agree a very ||headpatable|| girl

the classic risk of merch
it's also just a good looking sweatshirt
still
well read the manga in this case
its like the perfect kind of anime merch since its only obvious to people that know the show
if i was a rich boi i'd buy it in a heartbeat
yep lol
yeah but you'll probably have to import it
so like 60 bucks
its like 6k yen i think
They are actually going to make an irl version of Yotsuba's 428 sweatshirt and if i had more money i'd totally buy it

I think that's all i have

^I really like this one

i guess some people in the kaguya server like it haha

finally had time to watch the episode today, and damn i missed this series. That transformation scene was unf
Everyone in Lydian is eligible
Technically they could be
Think of the meme potential though
~~When has there ever truly been time for the side trio~~
Okay so what’s the over under chance of us getting a Beef Stroganoff 2 this season
Imagine being cute, couldn’t be me
Beef Stroganoff 2 is happening. I can feel it
thanks Millhi, love you
hey where is the download on Hibiki's new song?
“Hibiki can’t—“ lemme just stop you right there, this girl has a song in her heart and it’ll do whatever the hell its needed to do at that time
I’m excited for the duet
What a glorious day
Now to wait for wifi
Oh shit
Now we wait for a torrent
O.O
I think that’s part of the villains plans
*kiri tomorrow hype*
Tank you
Or did Bikki’s just come early
What day do CDs come out?
That’s why hers is last
You truly are a Big Damn Hero

I JUST SAW THE EPISODE AND HAVE SO MUCH HYPE ITS FUCKING GENOCIDE TIME LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
A tightly paced high quality animation movie would suit this series so well
6 seasons and a movie?
can't be spoiled by crunchyroll if you block their channel <:KaguyaBigBrain:536341916489613352>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
today is a big day for you huh
it really helped during the weeks before smash released
i blocked a lot of channels that just post spoilers for games and shit
<:WhenLifeGetsAtYou:557963311547809810> the blu rays are gonna take foreverrrr
would there be a way to get a ping whenever new songs are released? i don't wanna add extra work for anyone but i feel like a lot of people would appreciate it
do we have any idea when that banger from Carol is going to be released?
Kanade was dealt the worst hand in life...
<:KaguyaBigBrain:536341916489613352>
but apple was plot relevant
im still pissed that kanade isn't in the op behind tsubasa, like it doesn't make sense considering everyone else has someone they lost that is important to them
<:PKcry:481595178088398864>
if she has a good sendoff, id agree with that
back on topic, what is your over/under chances for Kanade coming back
and theyre doing deuts now too? nice
oh sweet
speaking of xdu, is that going to have a second album? because the first one bumped
at least xdu exists to give us new kanade songs...
i would freak out
i'd bump some Beef Strog
Beef Stroganoff (IGNITE)
Apple (Remix)
isn't there a 7th character song that we don't know who its for yet? unless that ended up being Carol
at least reanimate that shot in the new style
but good for the heart
a part of me doesn't want them to bring back the dead more than they already have, but damn if i wouldn't be so hyped to see Kanade and even Serena show up
dad is back? they really are bringing back every villain
melua's right thanks
no but like it has a name right? or am i misremembering
can someone remind me what exactly the moon thing is lol
<a:KNYmitsurigiggle:617450403470245938>
i thought it was pretty punny
that makes the line so much better lol
Had we ever heard the name of that sword before?
thats right the radio show exists
these things take time
i got one of my friends to watch it after i wouldnt shut up about it, and he loves it
Everything is better with twintails

Captain America (enhanced)
And Shirabe being a little captain America, just great
I love DMJii’s Amalgam designs
amalagam is going to be something else in that game
i love it
Shirabe's AXZ B-side is like a response to the letter
sorry didnt mean to spoil

oh wow what a great callback to G

so like... is it done done? forever?
honestly the emotional whiplash i have from seeing kimetsu getting a movie to symphogear ending has emotionally exhausted me
i saw them hop out a rocket and said "i need to watch this"

mine was the gx opening scene
a classic

thanks kirichan i needed that

update: 26 hours after watching the episode and im still sad
rewatching that "everyone is here" scene will get me everytime for the rest of my life i imagine
still not over it
for the good of the world
i'd pay for it <:02shrug1:550026088500166688>
if they add new songs they'll make the money back probably
but unfortunately, unlikely
it could always do the Madoka route of recap movies and then a movie that continues the story
now i really want the zabba baseball team...
i want the carol full song more than anything else in the world
im just waiting for live

which one is RR?
do we have a link for the songs that came with Blu ray 1 yet?

My dumb ass thought electrolysis was a Pokémon and now I’m sitting here feeling an idiot
Ayeeeeee 🙌🏼
I'm proud of all of us for passing our ass classes
Great job guys! I just learned I passed Econ with a B, needed a 87 for that. Super pumped
Its implied that they needed to change the sheets a lot
My school completely randomizes what time you can sign up for classes, it has screwed me every semester except for this one, where I actually got everything I wanted
If you’re looking for a game, Hollow Knight is super fun
It makes no sense to me that it is harder for an 18 year old to buy alcohol than it is to buy a gun
Damn this is fucked up
Holy fuck. Did they catch the guy?
high key
never played league since its so toxic, but now i really don't support it
what did they make again?
I love a good edgy joke, but there is a line and that has gone very far past it
There are some things you should never joke about especially on social media, that is definitely one of them
I DID NOT SEE THE RAW THING HOLY FUCK
My mind went to that Dunkey video of the all girl League team
I started doing last year and I have met so many more people this way, just forcing myself to talk to the people I sit next to in class or actually go out to parties and stuff. It was hard at first but eventually you get kind of used to it
I found that the best way to make friends is to just force yourself to be social
But its better to be safe than sorry
I think they were in dorms, so they had to
A bunch of my friends that go to the College of Charleston had to evacuate
We got lucky, originally the hurricane was supposed to make landfall in the county we're in, but it changed its path, probably saving a lot of the town
That used to house my mom's garden. All of that was blown away at some point. Theoretically the worst of it is over for us, but we'll see
My backyard

Yeah I'm fine, power keeps going away and coming back, but we weren't hit as bad as we thought we'd be
Was able to get some of these pictures while the hurricane wasn’t so bad for a bit, insane damage
Thanks <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Power is back probably for good, I am alive and well, the area is pretty fucked but my house managed to survive in tact
If she’s smart one day she’ll realize what he’s like and they’ll break up
Well fuck that guy
^^
Yeah my dark past is showing with that one
Yeah... That didn’t sound nearly as bad in my head but you are right on all those points
So i wouldn’t ask just because of how awkward that can be if they do and don’t. So if you just ask them out and they have an SO, one of two options will happen
1. They say they do and you move on OR
2. They don’t say they do, and you follow the philosophy of “Just because there is a goalie doesn’t mean you can’t score”
Oh, that's probably just to limit the amount of information that you can have on the test
Just to take notes at all?
What is it for specifically
I hated when classes made me buy notecards and then would never use them
when i was a freshman in high school, i had a moment of pure panic where i didn't know any of the answers on a test, so i glanced at the guy next to me and put down his answer. of course i was an idiot kid and the teacher saw it. got sent to in school suspension, the teacher emailed my parents. bad times all around. luckily she didn't report it or it could have honestly messed up a lot of stuff going forward and i don't think i'd be where i am now. So yeah i don't cheat anymore
I feel like they read too much into the memes
they'll say "hey stop" and Japan will probably say "no lol"
the un doesn't have too much power though
Yeah i really want the new season of prillya to happen so I'm invested in having it not happen
What dragon said, letting people do it in a way that doesn't actually have them act on it in the real world is a much healthier solution
Which is wrong
I mean its really the same thing as "violent videogames cause kids to be violent"
Haven’t seen RWBY so I wouldn’t know
The only roles I can think of from Vic were Edward Elric and Broly, and idk if croaky is the word I’d use to describe either of them. Personally I hope they get whoever did Broly in DBZA to replace him
things are both more accepted and less accepted
*insert that video about Zelda's feet in Ultimate*
it's like how the nisekoi blu-rays added more steam in the hot tub scene than the broadcast version for some reason
oh yeah i love gabdrop
oh right i heard about that
what did sony do
censorship only leads to things getting worse
\o/
weebs rise up
but yeah overall thoughts: censorship is bad and countries need to stop it, but even then why are my japanese cartoons what you always attack you assholes
i swear you have the best emotes
lmao facts
i'm a usa-ian
isn't porn technically illegal? i fell like I read that somewhere but idk how truthful it is
yeah plenty of stuff is illegal but people do it anyways and its harmless enough nobody stops them
"r/animemes starts a war against the world"
i have spent more than i'd like to admit for jpegs
they get those who don't have the money too
they don't just capitalize on those with extra income
damn you RNGesus
gacha gods strike again
life is good
i got gogeta AND broly in the dumb dbz game
~~who am i kidding when i die i'm for sure going to hell~~
i mean Joker is in smash so I must be in heaven
ah yes game i can't play because my roommates won't pay $5 more a month for internet
i mean i haven't fully felt alive since 2012 so it makes sense
as you should, to both those statements
it was an anime that very much was like "have kids"
not after darling in the franxx /s
"this game is rated M so don't buy it for your kids"
*parents buy the game for the kid anyways*
Parents: MY CHILD IS TOO YOUNG FOR THIS HOW DARE YOU
its fine if timmy sees a man's spine ripped out and then shoved through his eye
but SO HELP ME GOD if he sees a nipple
is that so wrong
i just wanted to have Madoka and Homura together
"i'll just roll for the blades who's VA i like" was an awful plan when i look back on it
puc puc sounds right
~~aren't they all~~
i just remember it had a nice op with all the girls singing
yeah i can't remember the game
there is
personal experience probably helped
got a 100 on it
yeah i'm a psych major and i actually did like a 2 page paper on gacha games and their feedback loop
... and then bakemonogatari on blu ray
i would buy better fucking internet
how does one get that money
i would like that money
:shinobushock:
jeez i thought my $500 was bad
i learned a lot from it
yeah i regret it, but like i don't really
i put all my anger into smash
1 hour seems a little ridiculous too
Yeah like any reason why they decided to do this
I was gonna ask that too
<:HayaPoint:501981774344224780>
i mean the issue comes from what they decide to call loli
because some people will call Kaguya Shinomiya a loli, even though she's 17, just because of the flat chest
Idk I guess I’d rather a platform that is supposed to be about anyone being able to make videos and become famous have the top guy be someone who does exactly that, even if I disagree and dislike that guy, rather than some company that doesn’t even make their own stuff
I’d rather it be an actual content creator that makes his own stuff than a media conglomerate
Is it weird that despite hating pewdiepie I’d still much rather him be the most subbed channel than t-series
<:SipsTea:373193607269842944>
because it shouldn't be happening in the first place
Small doses, to the point humor, almost never misses
ProZD makes amazing content
like all i wanted for the past 3 months was to be left alone, but now that i'm alone i just feel empty
its furnished, im just going from having people around at all times to being all by myself and its doing a number on me
moved into my new apartment today. I thought id be excited or something but honestly i just feel lonely and sad
just watched the projared video, i pretty much agree with what melua says about it
walmart has been selling new games for $50 recently, which is 10 bucks cheaper than anywhere else so that's been my go to
(also scott is great in general people should check him out)
around the one minute mark he kind of expresses my issue with game stores in general
https://youtu.be/QQEutrGhoqI
also their trade in policy is notoriously terrible
i wish they sold older stuff too, like if they had snes or genesis games, but even if you try and trade those in they won't resell them
between digital games, amazon, and the fact that they only really sell new games and then a crap shoot of preowned, i can't say im shocked
every once in awhile im like "maybe he wasn't as bad as i remember" but then i see stuff like this and realize that he is in fact, just as bad as i remember
oh but he is
the area where i live was extremely affected by florence last year, so everyone is really worried about this one
i watched a documentary where a serial killer described his murders as his hobby
i did not take it that way as much as i took it at the "im straight but astolfo makes me question that sometimes", but i can see how you can see it that way. im sorry and i will delete it promptly
That is fair
A traitor to Kiri?
You will all be cultured soon, as all things should be
^
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
PURE
NO WE DO NOT
The keions die in infinity war
I usually watch this during finals so this works perfectly
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
Oh boy I’m so down to watch some K-On
Oh shoot, Comic Girls came out today. 6 now
And behind on 5 of them
I’m at 13
Thought I was on nonsymphogear
Oh fuck wrong chat lol
K-On should take priority over anything. Idk why some people don’t get that
I can’t wait for my roommate who is never actually in the room to spontaneously decide to bring his girlfriend over Saturday night. As long as that doesn’t happen I’m good
FUN THINGS ARE FUN
Ah good ol summer of last year, started with 11 ended with 6
Just get behind on everything
That’s how you seasonal anime watch
I had fun everyone!
*sparkly sounds*
I can do at least 8
I hear it gets repetitive
How far did Saki and Shirabe end up getting
Lmaooo
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344> I’m so confused
Wait is it Sunday now?
<@!102691114762371072> now is the time
Ah okay
Room is locked
I just hopped in, was making popcorn
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
I can do any time tomorrow, so I’ll work with whatever the others need
I’m gonna need to do the catchup session, really any day will work for me
*not that it wouldn’t be worth it*
Yeah I don’t have that option haha
If my summer residency wasn’t so bad I’d do it, but since I can’t get this sent to a summer camp that I’m working at, and I can’t get this sent to my parents house, I’m all out of luck
Why does it have to be during the summer when I can’t get stuff like this <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
You don’t need to justify a purchase that great
As soon as summer is over I’m getting them
I’m so jealous
I’m saving Macross for later, I think I’ll watch Love Live since I apparently already have that downloaded
Okay so I’ll watch all of them, got it
Because I’ve wanted to watch one forever, I can never decide which though
Honest question what idol show should I watch
I wouldn’t do it without pay lol
Yeah I get paid, and they feed me all summer, it’s a pretty nice gig
Yep I get to supervise children all summer. Yay...
Big oof
I’m at camp all the time now so I’m not gonna be able to make it to anything for the next 10 weeks
So I guess I’m not
I’m actually really enjoying it lol
~~Just like my taste~~
That awkward moment when you start watching the Fate Magical Girl show expecting it to be trash but end up enjoying it
Puberty age. Big no go for me
It’s pretty rough
I wake up and they’re there
So it’s not that bad
I work with 14 year olds though
~~Kids do make me homicidal but I do it anyways~~
Its my 4th year doing it, actually got promoted this year so I’m doing a lot less and getting paid much more. It’s amazing
Come for the girls, stay for the Panzer
Gotcha
Has the Ova been watched already?
Because like look at this adorable shit how could you not wanna watch it all the time
Like I could be watching it right now but instead here I am rewatching random Cardcaptor Sakura episodes
I think that’s exactly what happened
It’s like Osmosis Jones but anime
Hataraku Saibou
I’m still trying to decide if I wanna drop the blood show or not
I didn’t play it but the soundtrack is fantastic
I've heard its got some of the best fight in the series so I'm excited
So I know nothing about part 5 other than a certain drink that a character will have later but I am so happy that it is back
I kind of wanna watch the new SAO season to see if it is actually as good as people are hyping it up to be. I've only seen GGO and the Abridged series though so idk
I haven’t seen overlord or youjk senki but like i gotta watch Isekai Infinity War
It’s been a good year for anime, lots of great shows came out
Was GGO winter or spring?
But if Zombieland Saga ends up being amazing well there ya go
Yuru Camp or Sora Yori for me
What a great season Winter was this year
SHINY DAYS BABY
I'm doing a chronological rewatch right now which is fun, a different way to experience the story and I've picked up on things I missed the first 2 times. Definitely would not recommend to a first timer though
I’m super late but I’ll say that seeing Kizu after Bake makes things make much more sense down the road too, so I think that’s the best time to watch it
It has nice thighs, which is why i originally picked it up, but I’ve been enjoying it as someone who watched Ultraman as a kid
I like Rikka for many reasons, she’s chill, she is a good friend (look at how she tries to reconnect with Akane), she doesn’t kill people for small reasons, she has amazing thighs...
At this point I’m just hoping I live long enough to see all 6 parts
One day when I have more time
I still haven't watched season 2 of Spice and Wolf because I know I won't read the LN and I know I'm gonna be left feeling empty
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560> When you finish watching the Nisekoi anime and realize that you gotta read the manga to actually see how it ends
They couldn’t, but like I’m sure someone will try
Unless they do HA next...
I think ufotable will do Fate a few years after HF, because more money and why not really
I have to agree, and it was just a spectacle to watch, animation was off the charts even for ufotable
But I agree with what y’all were saying the VN is much better than the anime, although I really liked the first HF movie
I saw Shinji up there, so I’m obligated to say: Fuck you Shinji
I’d watch Psycho Pass then
If you’ve seen that, I haven’t actually watched this one yet but it’s been on my PTW for a bit, it’s called Shiki. It’s supposed to be a lot like Shinsekai Yori
But S1 is a complete story on its own so that’s fine
If you haven’t the first season is great, and then you just stop there. Season 2 is trash
Have you seen Psycho-Pass?
Neon Genesis Evangelion also has a lot of psychological elements (and it’s my favorite anime of all time so I have to recommend it)
The Kara no Kyoukai movies also seem right up your alley if you haven’t seen those
It’s not exactly like it, but based one the preferences you gave me yesterday I think you’d enjoy Death Parade, which is not as edgy as the name makes it sound
Dang you blew through it haha. I’m glad you enjoyed it, one of my personal favorite shows
That was me, i pretty much sat down and said “fuck it I’m finishing this” and just committed to an episode a day
Just finished Katanagatari after like a year and wow. Great show, highly recommend
I’d check out Shinsekai. It’s psychological, horror, and often philosophical with some war involved
I think it’s right up your alley
Have you seen Shinsekai Yori
Yeah what are you looking for
It’s about a volleyball team. Beautiful animation and score
Haikyuu
Just watched I Want to Eat Your Pancreas and cried for a good 10 minutes. THATS BEEN FUN
Looks like that last Nisekoi episode did put me at a new milestone though
Kaguya-sama was everything i wanted it to be. Seeing it animated was a treat
I saw the name on horriblesubs and raised an eyebrow lol

I understand that Go-toubun is probably a little high, but as my friend put beautifully:
So far this season
1. Mob Psycho S2
2. Go-Toubun no Hanayome
3. The Promised Neverland
4. Shield Hero
5. Dororo

Not Ranked
Kaguya-Sama, Love is War (hasn't aired yet, so)

On-going shows
1. Jojo Part 5
2. That Time I Was Reunited as a Slime
3. SAO: Alicization
Dororo is super promising, not much happened in the first episode though
Big fan of Go-Toubun already
I’m pretty sure one of the characters reads your name if you donated a certain amount
Not surprising with those incentives
Kaguya-San is such a joy to watch
I will wait to pick a beat quintuplet until after they all have their own episodes so it’s more fair. Because right now it’s just Miku but wow she made a good first impression
I know Go-toubun is harem trash, but fuck it’s the harem trash I’ve been waiting for
As much as I’d love to see HF2 in theaters, I know there’ll be none within a 5 mile radius so I’ll just say I’m pumped to see it in 6 months
I’m so glad I could see it in theaters
The movie was soooooooo hype
I just rewatched it, I’m so freaking happy with it. The voices are spot on for how I imagined them
For both manga and anime
Thursday
~~I didn't actually like Devilman~~
SSSS.Gridman had a great ed
ToP was a ton of fun, lots of cool fights, but it’s pretty long and I’d imagine it’s pretty tedious to watch back to back, watching it once a week was fine but it’s a lot of fighting and not much else for a majority of the arc
*proposes 5toubun again*
That’s gonna be a lit day
<@!98541382393688064> Neverland is also the 27th
It’s official people
kyoani pls
It’s a great day then
DRAGON MAID SEASON 2 HOLY WHAT
I mean I did it in one day so it is possible
You just gotta believe in yourself
Well then 71 (maybe 2) chapters of 5toubun should be nothing
Honestly my standards for these awards are “please not a HeroAca character” so I’m fine with Rimuru winning
Better than all of 2018 already lol
The OPs this season are amazing
Well deserved, KyoAni outdid themselves which is saying a lot
Endro is the show I’m most likely to pick up after all these exams are over
I binged the Kaguya manga last week and loved it. I’ll probably read Shield Hero once the show ends
That’s a good group to pick
I feel the same about games too, jeez I basically ran on Smash hype last year
I enjoy having things to look forward to each week. It may be dark but it kind of gives me things to look forward too when not much else is going on in my life
If i had to pick just one to watch though it’d be The Promised Neverland, the show is great
Right now I’m watching 9:
Slime
Mob Psycho
Dororo
Shield Hero
The Promised Neverland
Go-Toubun
Jojo Part 5
Kaguya
SAO Alicization
Because I am seasonal trash
I watch like 8 shows a season on average
10/10 show
Such a likable cast, and it felt very real. Great direction and artwork
I absolutely loved that show
I think A Place Further Than the Universe was my AOTY
I just stuck with it because everyone else loved it
Devilman just kind of keeps going and if you missed a detail tough luck because it won’t be explained at all
But that’s because when things are confusing, it gets explained later why, and it’s supposed to be part of the experience
I actually love Monogatari, it’s my second favorite anime of all time when counted as a whole
Maybe I’m weird but I couldn’t follow the story at all after a certain point, and if I don’t know what’s going on I don’t care how good you look I won’t enjoy it
Also I really didn’t like Devilman Crybaby
That said, this year was a little better I guess. Maybe I just like seeing Jojo’s get best character design though
I love the show, but it doesn’t deserve most of the awards it gets from these things. Not like the nominees are ever actually that great to begin with
The crunchyroll awards have been the HeroAca circlejerk for years now
Yeah it really ain’t the deepest show, and isn’t in the top 3 for my favorites in either season it’s aired, but as a fun show to watch on dreary Mondays, it does the job
Like how much it’s developed and stuff
I see the town itself as the character
Big Milim fan
Eh I’m not looking for anything too deep I guess, I find it entertaining and that’s enough for me
Really? I started out not liking it and like it more each episode
Shout out to my friend who started Hunter x Hunter 21 hours ago and is on episode 39 already
You’ll be laughing the whole time
Episode are like 3 minutes
Watch Inferno Cop, the best show trigger ever made
Rebellion is one of my favorite movies ever, so until i am told otherwise i'm gonna pray its a sequel
The end of Rebellion was just begging for a sequel, I'm so hyped its finally happening
yeah but moneyyyyy
and if i like it enough i'll buy physical
i just use mangadex
you should read the manga, i'm not usually that guy but the art in the show doesn't do it justice
<:ichikaPeek:537561456758226944> <:ninoPeek:537561478744768523> <:mikuPeek:537475845854593024> <:yotsuPeek:537561502266294303> <:itsukiPeek:537220994314665994>
thanks for coming to my TED talk
because that's exactly what Urobuchi, the director, wanted
you can see it either way
But I mean in the end
wow wall of text
Homura absolutely, definitely did some things wrong. But is she evil? Well...that's more complicated.
So let's start with Homura's ungodifying of Madoka, and I'll be upfront: she was being selfish. Did Madoka say she didn't want to be a god? Yes. But that was while she was without her memories. All her character development throughout the series had been undone so, of course she didn't. It's a silly to ask someone about sacrifice while they're living in a perfect fantasy land. But it's what Homura wanted to hear, and it made her more set in her decision. Because she'd be doubting that Madoka was really happy, worrying that she'd let her down, because Madoka wasn't happy the way Homura WANTED her to be happy. And while Homura is sometimes seen as heroic because she sacrificed a ton for her friends, it's not what it's really about. I mean, hell, isn't a huge theme of the series that self-sacrificing wishes often aren't truly selfless? We see exactly that happen with both Sayaka and to a lesser extent Kyoko. This is about Homura thinking that her friends don't know how to make themselves happy. That Homura understands them better than they do themselves. So she forces it to happen. She brainwashes them against their will and drags them into her dreamworld because she knows what they want far better than any of them ever could. I mean, hell, with that last scene where Madoka is about to become Godoka again, Homura physically holds her down. Even when a part of Madoka is essentially screaming "I don't want this," Homura refuses to listen. Even if she's racked with guilt over defying the wishes of her best friend, she sees it as a necessary evil. So she gladly presents herself as a demon if it means making Madoka happy. In her eyes, at least. Because she loves Madoka. It's tragically human. Not evil, necessarily. But it's not good
because in the end, i don't think homura is evil, or that her actions are unjustified
i get that she most certainly did do some things wrong
alright so i'm kind of memeing when i say homura did nothing wrong
not in the barrier
i'm talking about at the end
we can still assume that at least a part of her does believe that
At the end, Homura asks Madoka if she considers the world precious and if she thinks laws or desires are more important. Madoka says she thinks laws are more important, and think it's a bad thing to just selfishly break the law. i think that shows that madoka wasn't entirely confident in her wish. she did it because she wanted to save as many as possible, but even then can we call what she did truly saving them? the girls would still have to die as a result of becoming a magical girl, even if they were saved from having to become a witch. it wasn't a true solution to the problem. even after her wish Incubator was still tricking (well not in his eyes but still, from our perspective) girls into becoming magical girls, and the wraiths were an issue as well, although we don't know much about them. Madoka's wish helped, but it was like putting a band-aid over a pipe
but she was simply split, into Godoka and Madoka
and its implied that madoka wasn't exactly just pulled down to earth
we see multiple times throughout the film that she wants to uphold the law of the cycle
but that isn't true
people seem to think that homura wanted to create a universe where Madoka's wish didn't happen
madoka's universe wasn't perfect either
she did nothing wrong though
that is fact
that is not opinion
homura did nothing wrong
also
i miss kalafina
god that song fits so well too
and then misterioso starts playing
i love how sayaka has mastered her witch form
the "final" fight against houmlily is amazing as well
i rewatch it all the time
mami vs. homura is such an unf fight
pretty much
i could gush about how rebellion is fantastic for hours
i'm too big of a madoka fanboy to not wanna rewatch it otherwise
that's what i was thinking lol
when was it?
but i loved dub asuka, hope they keep that VA
as someone who watched the dub the first time, no it is not
This is the best news to wake up to
how...
a place further than the universe ended over a year ago <:WhenLifeGetsAtYou:557963311547809810>
ufotable at it again with the outstanding animation
Demon Slayer is lit wow
i haven't seen overlord or the war show and i still loved it
started oregairu today with 0 expectations, ended up being pleasantly surprised. i can see why its so beloved
These are amazing
i will put a reaction on everything you say from now on then
i didn't think she'd be fighting so soon, but its what i wanted to see most
when nezuko came out of the box i freaked out
Holy shit that Kimetsu no Yaiba episode was incredible
Watched Heaven’s Feel 2 today and damn that was good
<a:FujiSpin:546025568932724766>
I'm super excited to see the firey hair guy though, one of my favorite characters
In the manga she just has pink hair, idk why they added the green
i honestly thought it was anime original
what
wait theres a manga
dumbbell is just such a dumb, fun show. i love it
understood
so i need to read the dumbbell manga
a proper CotE adaptation is my "if i could fund an anime"
the only light novels i read are classroom of the elite, and that adaptaion sucked <:honamisad:353038821819940875>
id imagine it has enough for about 4 seasons as well. i just haven't read the LN
the LN goes way beyond where the manga is for slime
oh, the manga for slime is actually not that far ahead of where the anime ended so its for sure going to pass it
i think it comes out in winter
slime is getting a second season
just as long as you don't use climax song honestly
ive heard about that dumpster fire
it also only adapts the first 3 volumes, which is largely setup. volume 3 is where things pick up but like volume 4 is *great*
the adaptation did a lot of things wrong, but its worst offense is that the director had a favorite girl, and gave her a lot of scenes that were meant to develop other characters
its literally built into his character
he's supposed to
its the best LN series ever, but the adaptation did it no justice
*cries in Classroom of the Elite*
of course sometimes things get shit adaptations despite being amazing
so a lot of shows only get one season then want you to buy the LN or the manga
a lot of anime is just made to sell source material
it really depends
like this is unexcusable
this sounds 1/10 worthy honestly
this sounds awful
jeez
so the director must have an eating fetish
that's so fucked
and they ***ate*** her
so it was in the form of basically a human
what the actual fuck
go ahead
<:KNYkanaosmug:577417092471717889>
i mean who doesn't like a good rant?
like the anime changes characters' entire hair color for no reason
oh also the anime has such a boring art design, while the LN art is so clean
<:keiwink:479685927854145557>
so yeah uh everyone should read classroom of the elite it is amazing and Kei is best girl
what a fucking garbage show lmao
which i mean, given the content is fair
hibiki loves to eat
and its better entertainment
the dumbbell show can get you 2/3
e x a c t l y
even the ecchi is bad
yeah, that's where it ends
shit really gets bad after that
central is the last *decent* arc
you do you
<a:FujiWhistle1:548948510741889044>
should've ended a longgggggg time before it did
haha shokugeki
if KnY ends this arc like many think it will then it'll probably be a very good ending, but we will see
mostly due to how they are forced to go longer than the author intends
nope
fairy tail wasnt shonen jump
idk what FT is but from what im told black clover was pretty bare bones for awhile
yeah
people dont understand that it came out in shonen jump, where if you have too much worldbuilding in the beginning you dont get serialized
kanata no astra deserves the jump though, that's been lit recently
same with dr stone, neither of those episodes were bad enough for thaat huge of a drop in rating
why is kimetsu's episode ranked so low? people really hate world building huh
ecchi *upgrade*
moe girls *upgrade*
harems *go back*
issekai harems *I SAID GO BACK*
<:PepegaHD:567323215358328833>
to each their own
<:KNYtanjipray:564897293711704093>
why not both?
<a:Ricardong:558470660590927889>
*that's the best part*
to love ru would like a word
and you will give it the respect it deserves
ecchi is the heart and soul of this industry
>trash
>ecchi

pick one
eh ruins the pacing and subs go away too quick
theres like 40 shows airring a season, so idk how you do all that in a sunday night but whatever
i dont have nearly enough time for that, ill do my research on the chart or start through word of mouth
<a:KaguyaKek:549275969131642906>
sorry i only watch good shows
havent even heard of cheat magaician
EMT has her own driving force, and genuinely wants to help people in a world that looks down on her for what is essentially her race.
<a:KNYkanaosplash:622667198602674209>
saving lives
theyre good people
yeah
i like EMT, rem is overrated though
yeah slime is getting a season 2
winter i think
i liked alicization
after reincarnated as a slime was so fun and good, an "edgy" (generic) isekai just didn't do it for me
ive never been more bored watching a popular show
<:SagiriBleh:453065062534479872>
<:SagiriBleh:453065062534479872>
shield hero
<a:SIDECHEST1:602232757149630504>
it had a little spark last year with darling and gridman. so thanks trigger
its not like they had a lot of extra time to play around with
but noooo some people just gotta get their loved ones back and ruin it for everyone
thanos was right, captain america even talks about how theres less pollution
why even continue the series once youve so clearly peaked
any madden game that isnt madden 08
yeah
zelda, pokemon, marvel
there are a few series ive just accepted ill always like
moon knight is gonna save it all
nah moon knight is coming
but this industry has burned me before
i can only hope
i love 5bun too but when that season ended there i never would have imagined that it would get a season 2 before kaguya
i just want to see iino animated <:IinoPout:595299324255141904>
it was mega popular, sold great, and now i wake up every morning hoping to see a season 2
which sucks because the anime got right up to where it starts to get good <:ChikaCry:556658406807830578>
kaguya has not gotten a second season
<:KaguyaCry:546025572283842621>
*cries in Kaguya*
i mean, its not like that would be unprecedented
there hasn't been a season 2 announcement yet if that's what you mean
imma need you to get out of here with that bad energy
<:KNYkanaocuppeek:625126750069719050>
spoilers for next episode 
|| its going to be the scene where muzan subtracts the moon count by four during the first half of the episode, then the kanao coin flip and them seeing the train to end the episode ||
i was expecting that to be the last episode cliffhanger
im shocked they showed the train honestly
it looks like they are setting up for season 2
*precious*

<a:Kurumibleh:611282274582790418>
not looking good i assume?
nothing worse than catching up to a series just to see that nothing has come out in a long time
and she didn't know shuvi was a precious girl
and in a war
she was a younger girl then
i wouldn't say that, but don't criticize something you haven't seen
jibril best girl btw
ngnl is great, so i want it to have a season 2
i just feel like it takes a lot for any to be unique anymore. Slime was that last one i liked just because it felt actually fresh. i like re zero and konosuba, but stuff like shield hero and the mom one are just bleh to me
like jesus theres so much
what concerns me is the amount of issekai
im not too upset about that
that show was great though. so nice to see a real ending
technically they all are transported to another world
unless you wanna count kanata no astra as an isekai
i had an isekai-less season and it was great
im pretty sick of isekais
Currently for me: SAO, MHA, We never learn, probably the fate g/o show, chihayfuru when i catch up
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/559452381616537650/626025056103039006/txnnttgtmio31.png
**that being said** vinland saga will still be going on and more people need to watch it
its weird because everything im excited for is just new seasons of shows, theres no new show that stood out
best girl gets a show lets go
<a:Kurumibleh:611282274582790418>
Konosuba movie is playing near me... trying to decide if i wanna go...
it is and its great
i hate how much im enjoying to love ru
I only cried 3 times
Bunny Girl Senpai movie was really good. Bring tissues
<@185949743321579520> <@238855496797257729>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvNxgHTWIlo
there's a proZD video on that
like yeah the plot is messy, but it seemed to be pretty popular, at least in the west, and had some nice animation and a talented voice cast
im honestly so stumped by this
like its not the best, but its better than 107
because the show is far from that bad
the kyoani fire had to do a number on it
grand order seems like it might actually be good which is shocking
bokuben season 2 looks to be more of the same which is fine by me
<:urukawow:600691905864663050>
which is dumb because senapi is totally the best
the relatability of that, plus her design and the fact that she is often used as the fanservice character, has made her the most popular
sensei is looking at it from the point of her chasing a dream instead of following through with what she is talented in, and she failed. She doesn't want Fumino and Rizu to end up failing in what they want to do while they are both geniuses in the other subject because she is thinking about her failure and doesn't want them to suffer the same fate
mafuyu
fumino has the blue hair
<:foompray:568451654039502860>
those are 2 different characters
Fumino? Sensei?
Index: Broke
Railgun: Woke
oh
Karuizawa?
Kei who?
Kei?
im going to once i finish To Love Ru
haven't read that yet actually
please, refer to me as trippy
<:KNYsnek:617479785215688714>
ichika gets bottom rung for being snek
Nino > Yotsuba > Itsuki > Miku > Ichika
Also with the most annoying fanbase
Miku is the most overrated of the quints
yotsuba is great though
<:SagiriBleh:453065062534479872>
miku
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
season 2 will do best girl justice
<:NinoSmile3:613938754603974672>
kind of like how nino got shafted in season 1 of quintuplets
last season didn't have her much though
she's the best
yeah
nah i get it
Senpai > Foom > Uruka > Sensei > Rizu
look im not her biggest fan either, im just saying why she is so popular lol
i just looked it up you are right
<a:KNYzenwoke:608931091952435200>
probably from me
Classroom of the Elite
and it would need a remake considering how much the anime fucks it up
its like one of the most popular series in Japan too, which means its chances of getting a second season or a remake are pretty much 0
its a great light novel series that got fucked over by its adaptation
<:keicute:455027077058527233>
yeah the only Kei I care about is Kei Karuizawa from CoTE
Quints airred in winter of this year
I really like the new bokuben opening, but it lacks the raw energy of the first one that elevated it for me
nevermind, for anyone wondering apple music has all of them plus more
does anyone know where i could find all the Revue Starlight insert songs? Youtube killed the video i usually watched with them
i see no difference
also pansy is best girl and you just can't argue otherwise
i dont know why
i like the op a lot for some reason
the studio
but you know who wouldn't be?
idk what
i think the fallout of the most recent episode will cause something to happen
high iq plays left and right
and i loved it
you're right
Is doing the thing
Kaguya in the picture
Oh wait
Unless it’s **dual core**
That’s around how many chapters season 1 was
I expect it to end after the sports festival tbh
The first season ended right when the manga starts to get really great, so expect great things
<:IinoBlush:589249128433844236>
Can’t wait to see Iino
Worthy
The potential of death has never stopped me before
Did 2 shots for second season hype
I’m literally crying in the club over this
i think that's fair
id say its your quintessential harem anime
from a certain point of view
i guess you could call it a classic
this is To Love Ru Darkness
no no, this is much more degenerate than that
nanoha? i dont think the show has a nanoha
a hot contender for best girl
Momo Belia Deviluke
animators: how should we show the tail coming out of the swimsuit
the director: yes
<:KaguyaNoU:576701721385107457>
I’d rather have the manga anyways
But since I read Kaguya before it aired
I can’t afford Blu Ray
<a:KaguYay:569501596195487755>
i actually bought 4 volumes yesterday of the manga
that song will never leave my rotation
<:KaguyaSmug:505002640673865730>
season 1 stopped right where, in my opinion, the manga starts to get really good, so I was absolutely ecstatic when i saw the season 2 announcement
season 2 is going to be amazing
<:PepeHands:629528473307971584>
and the development of him and Kaguya throughout the series is honestly so precious
||see chapter 153, "because if he turns out to be a lousy person, i will do everything in my power to stop you"||
also he's the most precious
<:IshiSmug:591916303359410176>
He isn't OUR GUY for no reason
Not Lala
I’ve heard the one about Haruna
<a:pepePOGROW:528439556056416266>
God imagine owning both Momo and Lala
I will say most shows wouldn’t ever change the main girl, so I respect the fuck out of Darkness for doing so
Wow no realism smh
Is that accurate to canon
<:IinoLewd:589185648620077083>
You could use it to store things
Her mouth seems pretty classic Lala to me
*Nana cries in the distance*
Worth it
To Love Ru is such stupid fun idek
I love it
<:KaguyaLewd:474806959904653314>
I liked the popsicle scene
I just finished Darkness Season 1, now on to OVAs
When I go to Japan I must see this
Where is this statue
Yami is cool too though
Yeah i decided best To Love Ru girl is Momo and it isn’t even close
I forget
Or did I use a vpn...
Big sad
But it’s gone now
I watched through it a third time then
It was on Netflix for a little
<:KaguyaSmug:505002640673865730>
If it’s Kaguya or 5bun, where i read the manga anyways, I’d rather save money and have the manga
I’d but Blu Rays if they weren’t so fucking expensive
Fair enough
Who needs Blu rays when you’re a pirate
Look I’m just trying to avoid anyone getting pissed off by Run/Ren
~~or if you frequent serious-discussion tbh~~
^
You’re never too old for some stupid fun
I don’t think it’s up your alley
You would probably hate it tbh
It’s great is what it is
Idk, Japan is weird
It’s not Lala it’s Haruna
In To Love Ru Darkness, Haruna's role in the manga is reduced, due to her being based on series artist Kentaro Yabuki's ex-wife, who has awarded the rights to the character in their divorce;
From Wikipedia:
Which is why she rarely shows up
Yeah it’s not Lala it’s Haruna
He loves Haruna, but the main girl was Lala, then changed to Momo when Darkness comes out
oh and Spy x Family, which is a very new series
i dont actually read too much manga, but Kaguya, 5bun, and Solo Leveling are all amazing
have you read 5bun? its more of a harem-esque thing but the communities have a lot of overlap in readers
<:KaguyaSmug:505002640673865730>
the best manga, in my completely biased opinion
it is cute though
<a:IshiDed:609392789934964736>
i didn't make the emotes
<a:KaguYay:569501596195487755> <a:FujiYayJump:568895722314006528> <a:IshiDed:609392789934964736>
<@!98541382393688064> i forgot to say that kimetsu no yaiba is also great but the art is meh at times, still if you liked the show i can easily recommend
me starting the Azur Lane anime and seeing all the ships I know from the game
~~solo leveling doesn't count~~
nothing can change my mind on that
kaguya is the best manga coming out right now
yeah the last two chapters have been funny as hell
the one that came out today?
religously
i am
me
is weathering with you able to be watched from the comfort of my computer yet?
rewatching girls und panzer because why would you not?
Did someone say cake song?
https://youtu.be/kwXaK12envI
*Insert Trump joke here*
like me, someone who has not yet seen Youjo Senki
So like keep it in mind
World God Only Knows is fantastic though
https://youtu.be/1uDU0UyWe7E
Good job Saki, staying relevant to both topics
Very well done show
Megalobox has been really fun
I have weirdly seen Madoka two times already in 2018, I'd love to make it a third though
You know enough
It got me like 5 times
It only made you cry once? You're hardcore then
I love the feels
I gave the show a 10
Why did I listen to the Sora Yori insert song. I knew it would make me get all in my feels
I love that image
I’ve never heard this song before but it’s a strong vibe
Alright imma disappear for like 10-15 minutes to take a shower. Brb
Lmao
The Inauguration by Bun B comes to mind
I love songs like this, that use samples from random stuff
This bumps
She’s a beautiful singer, very wide range
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
This is my favorite one yet, but I also love all these songs so I’m probably bias
Night!
It jams so far
“Just roll with whatever comes on”
It’s criminal how well that all works
Do you have everybody’s circulation?
I’m down for it
Is this blank space mixed with down with the sickness?
Let’s see what surprises it has in store
I need to download your version on my phone to replace the og version in my playlist
*the version that ruined the original for me*
If they could’ve found a way to combine them it would’ve been fantastic
It was a missed opportunity
That is what I loved about the AXZ songs, you could hear the influence from the other girls in each of the songs
Ya
Moonlight is missing the hype guitars that Sunshine has
Once you look up the lyrics, you can’t hate Draft Folder. It’s impossible
Whenever I can, I will <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
This has been a nice way to end my day, goodnight everyone
I know this one!
It’s usually safe to assume I’m just trying to make a joke, and failing
Joke
It made me feel good
Oh hey Sparkle is here too! Hey!
I haveth returned
Wow I haven’t used brb in forever

After listening to Yuki Kajiura’s OSTs for about 20 hours total this week while studying, i have decided that she is my favorite composer. Madoka and Kara no Kyoukai OSTs being standouts. Here’s my favorite by her: Shiki’s theme from Kara no Kyoukai https://youtu.be/0c2s05n_hbI

An iconic song
https://youtu.be/1P_BlUY2eF4
wait are the starters singing Enterprise's character song? that's cute af
no it started at 3 silly
persona 4 didn't have to go this hard but im so glad it did
https://youtu.be/am-olDTSV2U
I don’t think it will be, it’s not like Nintendo to half ass things like that
I’d love to play Pikmin 3, I was a big fan of the first 2
And Smash but since there’s a new one nobody is complaining anymore lol
If they ever port it to Switch I’ll probably pick it up, I mean they’ve ported pretty much every other Wii U exclusive so it’s possible
The main complaint I keep seeing is the dub is bad, but I’ll probably play it subbed like the weeb I am anyways
Oh that won’t be too much of an issue then
Does the crashes happen all the time or just when it’s in handheld mode?
I never had a Wii U so I could never play X
Yeah I’ve been looking for something to play on switch until Dark Souls comes out
I watched the Nintendo Direct on it but the battle system seems really confusing
I never played X but I really liked 1 so that’s promising
Has anyone played Xenobalde Chronicles 2? If so how was it?
They’re pretty consistent in quality overall. Especially in comparison to most other devs
Roll to bribe Maria with a tomato
A bow is found on the corpse
Running is futile. As soon as she sees anyone even look at Bikki with loving eyes, they are dead
It already does that so I’ll be fine
Just cheat. Ez
But you wouldn’t get the chance to flirt with Bikki cause you’d have to beat the Miku boss first, and good luck with that
If we’re doing the tabletop I am 100% down
I should just sell my xbox and get a PS4. Past Fortnite and FighterZ I never play the thing anyways
Wait is NieR on PC? Because I’d love to play it
Lol, I bet that made thinks easier
I’ve watched gameplay and it looks super fluid, it also got great reviews
I need to get a PS4, at very least for Bloodborne and Nier
That wouldn’t surprise me, Nintendo needs to get with it on their internet
Yeah that’ll be a death sentence
I’d rather wait and get something I know will play it well then risk it with my computer. Wasn’t that game supposed to be out like last year?
I need to get a new one, but money...
My computer is pretty ass at running games like that
I didn’t have any last gen consoles that play it, I’m working at a summer camp when it comes out and was gonna use the switch to play it while there
*will
I’ve never played it, it was gonna be my first time
This is the worst news

Ew is normal Goku actually happening?
A savage move for sure

“Any and all games” so it sounds like tabletop is fine
Plus we already have different variations of Goku and Vegeta, I want new stuff
<@98541382393688064> my issue is that it’s just so... basic. If it was kid Goku I’d be on board, but there are so many cooler characters they could’ve had as DLC, Gogeta, SSJ4 versions, Janemba, ToP characters, Master Roshi, even Arale, but instead they just have Base Goku and Vegeta. Just seems dull in comparison to me
Saving this
I actually was pretty good at swimming, so I was able to keep being athletic even up until now. Which is good because other than that I live a very sedimentary lifestyle
All I can think of is the heads from Rick and Morty saying "SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT" and then see this guy
Around when I was 10 they just kind of gave up and let me play Smash Bros all I wanted
Clearly following the path they wanted me to take lol
It didn't work out too well
My parents really wanted me to be an outdoorsy type
I tried once when I was like 6. Was really bad at it and cried the whole time. My parents gave up and took me home
If I wanted it to be realistic I'd go outside (jk y'all know I wouldn't go outside)
How is it
TTGL was actually my first anime (besides DBZ and Cardcaptor Sakura as a kid) but Eva is my favorite
My man
People are really mixed on it, if you liked Gurren Lagann/Eva I'd give it a watch
Ep 15 was really well done overall. Between that and episode 13 I think it'll be fine
Didn't feel like it was much more of a stretch than some of the stuff in KLK to me, but I can get how that would be annoying. It had a weird shift between seasons, where it went more from a week-by-week Cardcaptor Sakura-esque feel to a more story driven one, so that could've been done better
NANI
It'll take like an hour to finish its worth your time
Idk, I thought it was really fun and really enjoyed the world that it built
Also, who could forget the masterpiece that is INFERNO COP
I thought Little Witch Academia was great
To be fair, I'm using Discord in class right now, I just sit in the back right by the window like the protagonist would
Dess is always good taste <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
^ Big fan of your pfp
I haven’t checked 3DS, but I think some GBA games are on the VC so it’s worth a look. Unfortunately the Switch VC is nonexistent right now
That’s how I played them
In the off chance you have a Wii U they are on the virtual console
Last time i played they had just added horses, so I can only assume I’ve missed a ton
Ooh I was thinking of getting that for Switch
Anybody that plays the Fate GO global version, the banner that’s up right now good or should I save my quartz
The only Tales game I’ve played is Symphonnia, and I loved it
I’m glad Gohan Blanco has stood the test of time
There are dozens of us out there. **DOZENS**!
Roll to genocide?
"Does this look like a sword to you"
*Is holding multiple swords*
If they take anything from GO it should be the poke ball throwing. I actually enjoyed that part
Well you should always take leaks with a grain of salt, this just seemed more real than the norm
These feel way more real than the norm
I thought so at first but a *lot* of places are reporting it
Pokémon Switch leaks:
The titles are Pokemon Let’s Go! Pikachu and Pokemon Let’s Go! Eevee. The game has apparently took inspiration from some mechanics in Pokémon go. The graphics look kind of like sun and moon but it was blurry so I couldn’t tell how good it actually looked
For my thoughts, I hope those aren’t the names, because that is atrocious. I hope the Pokémon go mechanics aren’t using too much. I do not wanna go outside to catch anything, I think it’ll just be throwing pokéballs (the best part of that game) but we’ll just have to wait and see
She’s a qt
He isn’t wrong

24138
But if there’s anyone I would peg for awful titles, it is Nintendo
I agree, these don’t feel like titles that would belong to a main series game, they feel like titles to a spin off
There was a leak yesterday that said these were the titles, still possible that it’s fake but this does help the case that it’s real
Apparently those are the titles of the new Pokémon game for the switch
Feels pretty real now

Oh do you have a switch?
<@!102691114762371072> I like Xenoblade Chronicles 2, but I don’t think he has a Switch
Persona 5 seems to be the way to go
Hell yeah, Smash is my game
The Switch is also going to be like the only thing I play for months once Smash 5 comes out
I really should, and probably will once I get a place of more permanent residence. The switch has been kind to me in that regard
But yeah it really does suck. And I don’t wanna sell it since when it comes down to it I enjoy playing games with other people, but when everyone stops playing fortnite (which is what is already happening) it’ll just be there to watch Hulu on and be collecting dust. Meanwhile there are a ton of games I want for PS4, P5, Bloodborne, and God of War to name a few. Maybe one day I’ll have enough for one
God those boss gauntlets at the end of all the NES ones were fucking torture
Well at least that is constant throughout he old and new ones
Ah okay, I’ve only played the NES Ninja Gaidens
Are you playing the NES one or the newer one
Yeah I heard it, it is very worth your time
I'm a big fan of lemons
I am a man of science
*Implying I haven't already gone and found P5 lewds myself for research*
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Do I go adventure myself and put any findings into NSFW?
You already brought up that it exists
I mean
By that definition then yes I have friends
only 2
2
I have 2 friends that have played God of War, they both had nothing but praise for it
Ah gotcha
I got it mainly to play at night while I'm working at camp, so I'm excited
That sounds fantastic
I've missed like 4 per stage so far, which isn't too bad but hurts my OCD
Its what made me praise the music haha
I'm in the hotel right now
Is that the hotel?
I also like how its really as hard as you want it to be, like I can tell that if I wasn't going through for the strawberries the game wouldn't be nearly as hard
I love it, the music is fantastic
So Saki I got Celeste today
yup yup
Nah AR

I should probably do that, I have a bad habit of grinding hard at low levels and then just plowing through the rest of most RPGs
So that’s been tough
I’ve also been trying to S rank all the other parts
I’ve just been farming logistics recently
3-1...
Did somebody reference House Party?
Shout outs to anyone that actually gets that reference
Sorry I had to
HOWS IT GOIN DOOD

One of my roommates plays that a lot
Rainbow Six Siege?
I’m 2 years clean of league. Community just got so toxic tbh
If you have my luck you’ll get 1 more and then will never get another one
You can do a lot of dummy plugs
The 416, my only 5*
I’ve only played the original, but it was like my first RPG, I love it
WILD ARMS IS FANTASTIC
THIS MUST BE THE CHOICE OF STEINS;GATE
<:Ver:336656981144109066> I HAVE BROKE THROUGH THEN
I was just playing why can’t y’all log in?
Wait what
How do I get that gun
How
I like how in Earthbound when you get strong enough you auto kill enimes
How do you get that lucky
<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
That's really sad, he made quality content
I like that
Depending on the time I’d be down for playing a tabletop
Someone give me a tl;dr of what’s going on
That’s actually a really interesting idea, it’d be neat to see that concept taken to another level
That is true
I’m just spitballing
The relic itself was infected?
And then they said “yeah this needs *two* sequels”
Yeah I couldn’t care less about a switch port of fallout
FF13 was so... bland
The worst FF?
I am very good at setting myself up for disappointment
Wait did Bethesda announce something?
I go through games fast enough that it’s okay
Oh these aren’t the mainline game, that’s good, I’m much more into them now
I’m gonna get one. Because I’m a slave to Nintendo
Pichu, Pikachu, Raichu
No offense to anyone
Pikachu is the vanilla of Pokémon tbh
Who won’t get the Eevee version
Okay so like
I’m replaying White Version right now for the first time, and I actually like it a lot more than I did initially
Chandelure is really good though...
Whew
Wow some of those early sprites
Since I am awful at shooting games
Usually I was just a distraction
My friends referred to me as “the guy we get when we need 1 more player”
I am so trash at siege
I’m just happy I can main Pichu and hurt myself
So I just watched the direct in the bathroom for the past 45ish minutes and I am *hype* for smash
