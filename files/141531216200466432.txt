shame it would be nitro only
THIS IS AWESOME
OH GOD
now we wait for people who try to <:MikuFear:642799630605615114> but ends up <a:MikuBear:605209676224921630>  <a:KirikaMegadess:502935599238479872>
<:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
I just captured from the shinai
I admit all I did was removing the background, didn't even cross my mind to mess with the colors <:MikuPanic:640289659452129310>
no ribbon version, for whoever makes these decisions here to choose which would be better should it be accepted <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> (bikki has her fingers crossed! <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937> )
so uh I know this isn't a Miku shrine server or anything and all that but she did have a birthday recently and maybe as a birthday (~~endless bikki's everywhere notwithstanding~~) she could get another emote <:Bikkiwhoops:611251957012889600> ? MikuFear, MikuEmbarred, MikuBeforeDisaster? <:kiriAYAYA:611251978173022238> thanks <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
(both pictures are actually bigger than discord file size for emotes so reuploading and deleting previous messages to prevent cluttering)
original was a keychain pic from a merch site if anyone wants to give it a shot :3
tried way harder on this one, but it still doesn't feel right and it might suffer from *too much jpeg* syndrome <:MikuSad:336657015961026560> I propose :MiKutie: for this one <:kiriAYAYA:611251978173022238>
slightly improved attempt tho
uncropped version if anyone wants to have a go on this because I know my version is awful :<
yeah I suck at cropping even with big bold black outline but here's my suggestion, :MikuPanic: <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Thank you!
Hi everyone! I guess I picked the *best* time to join, Miku is my spirit animal 😃
oh welcome <@625430123604213828> ! Is Hayate-chan on her way? <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
this is evil
so that's my main account now, never even logged on the old one once I got my subscriptions
on Reddit I was able to grab u/kohinata_miku recently and it made me really happy <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
so... Miku Maya I guess?
but you can also call me Maya, which is also confusing because we already have a Maya on the server and she came first <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I actually been changing my nick to Miku everywhere on the internet
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Miku is fine
I love Hibiki more than anything, but I like seeing Miku happy because it's like I'm happy
thank you so much
<@!263983345669505025> wholesome (Hibi)Miku? <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
well at least I put it in as soon as I got called out >_<
I'm really, really sorry
and spoiled dinoboy in the process, how stupid can I be
I actually thought "ping me for art" was "ping me to ask for art" up until I actually did it
yeah I realized it too late.
not a dude but still sorry
goddammit
sorry
goddammit
I got it wrong
OH
<@506219877724454929> anything cute and wholesome you have I'll take it :~ needing wholesome Miku ||after all that Shemha shenanigans||
thank you! <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
are you Shirabe too?
............ how do you do that Kerrik



and I'll concede that I thought Basa and Bikki weirdly didn't have any chemistry going on for them, but I thought it was being postponed or something
I'm very glad it didn't
for those who read TMI, I thought Miku was Simon and Basa was Jace
I thought they were going for the "in love childhood friend who will have to move aside for the new love" trope
(hence why I missed all the HibiMiku hints until the S1 make-up picture)
Maya, when I started watching Geah I actually thought Hibasa was the show's OTP
also chris with glasses <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
feels so real
.... I'm actually in love with the alternative hair styles on that twitter link?
yup thank you so much <:MikuGay:336656810788388864> <:MikuGay:336656810788388864> <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
does anyone have any non-lewd HibiMikuChris? <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
me too, Dino, but I don’t think mentioning it now and stealing kumfroik’s thunder and excitement over his amazing gift is a very nice way to go about it.
the only way this could be better is if you were actually Hibiki and your GF were Miku. apart from that this is probably one of the most wholesome presents I’ve ever seen <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
(though I’ll concede TsubaKuri does give off this vibe <:ShirabeThink:611251942236094484> )
tsubakuri is rare pair pls gib <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
sorry MaMaria but also TsubaKuri shipper here <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938> <:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386> even if the official ship is unquestionably TsubaMari and they are indeed cute as hell, I really wished for TsubaKuri to come true in early G <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

chris finally firing red hot blaze, nailing it AND it being plot relevant was the best moment of XV3 to me
and other stuff we're probably never going to guess
between custodians, hibimiku and serena
I think the Fudou reveal happened quite early tbh, it seems they're speeding up stuff because they have A LOT to cover yet
probably gonna end up disappointed haha
but I got my hopes up because of how they hyped XV being about mostly Hibiki and Miku
you're right
and I really would settle for a simple "sweetheart" in calling each other
I don't argue with that, it's very sweet
so cute but so unnerving
I mean, they're pretty obviously a married couple with children and it's STILL only implied
I got so many mixed feelings with the nanoha thing
has it ever happened before in anime?
do you folks think there's even a slight chance they un-queerbait their relationship this season? as in, really makes them come out as romantic partners?
I got really worried about Miku's obvious foreshadowing in this episode 😦
reminds me of mage the ascension
I never read a fanfic of anything my entire life but Symphogear might be what changes that <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
even if they're going to heel-face turn immediately afterwards, it's nice having that sense that they won't pull any punches
personally I think individually those are all cop outs, right, but when the show does this thing constantly it's actually fun because you know just ANYTHING can happen
"oh Bikki's arm got eaten? no biggie, she'll just grow another one!"
it was what made me fall in love with the series
I actually like how symphogear makes deus ex machina's a thing to be actually expected
looking back G was WILD in cliffhangers
I remember when I was watching G, it was very late at night and I had to work the next day, but after seeing the arm eating I just HAD to keep watching, it was a very sleepy day at work afterwards
right, thanks ninryu!
having to wait a whole week to see how it was going to play out
imagine how it must have been for people watching G and the monster-whose-name-I-don't-remember ate Bikki's arm
for somene who binged everything from season 1 to AXZ late last year, watching this season week by week has been nerve-wracking <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
or perhaps she's going to next week?
I find it weird Hibiki didn't report the thing when Milla tried to do that to her
as if I couldn't be more hyped for next week
ohhhhhhhhh
Kerrik, really? where have you read it?
oh god
oh god Kanade please no, no deaths this season 😭
I'd be up for SONG having to go rogue this season in order to bring Fudou down
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
that's some dr. ver thinking right there
I mean he most likely abused Tsubasa's mother to conceive her, highly doubt that kind of shit was consensual
Symphogear: Endgame, the Movie
Ry, let me assist: é É
Chossei, yup, but I don't think Miku is really over that issue
more like "hey Miku, would you like to know if there was a way the love of your life would stop putting her life in danger every other day?"
I'd wager wholesome but with a very downer ending
I fully sympathize with Miku's misguided efforts to keep her out of harm's way
I don't think I ever loved a protagonist in a show as hard as I love Hibiki
hence Fudou has always been truly evil to me
Kanade, I'd assume so 😦
the first one they were busted on their deal and the second one was Millarc being desperate
there's also the thing that the fights in this episode were not exactly planned out by the bad guys
I guess they are trying to pick a fight, in order to use that invasion seal thing
I don't think any kind of character building can attone her for that little girl's murder
seeing millarc getting her ass handed to her was amazing
ooohhhhh
<@209896097026408449> which slot? where can I see it?
oh god if CarolNein dons the dur da blá and fights for good would be epic
s / ballsy / stupid
Carol was someone with very good reasons, fallible, and utterly, unrepentingly bad
Fudou as we know so far is just an evil fascist
there will never be a better villain than Carol
lol
I'd go broke for an actual Symphogear setting RPG
LOL
<@106861977086779392> not only she uses it, but she also nails it *AND* it turns out to be plot relevant, that has to be one of the best payoffs I've seen in a show
that was a work of art
even in other anime
I don't think Hibiki's transformation in XV can ever be topped
as much I'd love for Carol to come back...... please be Miku
but instead there are now 70 thousand dead 😦
I was honetly hoping for a heel-face turn like Hibiki's arm growing immediately back in G, something like "oh it was just an illusion to break Tsubasa"
I mean it didn't ruin the show or anything, but I felt weird seeing that
I personally think the killing of the girl crossed the line a bit
I have a little sympathy for catgirl, but the fact that none of them showed even a hint of remorse over the little girl's murder makes me angry
oh god that will be so amazing
please set the final battle to Senkin Dur da Blá
<@106861977086779392> Kanade would stream competitive and kick ass
<@486087033652248576> judging by season 1 Hibiki does as well
if on each kill she yells DESS! I'd watch too
inb4 kiri IS noobmaster69
ohhh right
<@106861977086779392> which fuckboy message?
except it was real 😂
Zwei Wing was 2040's Tatu
<@!246146781832806401> my head cannon is that Tsubasa and Kanade were an actual couple, and their relationship was actually known to the public
<@486087033652248576> 😔 ✊
<@!225771411833225216> I actually think Chris with Tsubasa is a better ship than Maria... but I know I'm in the minority 😂
* covers Hibiki's eyes *
oh yes I do
<@486087033652248576> the top energy of that interaction would go through the roof
<@476058996315389953> OT4 then, please let's not forget about Chris! 😂
poor Maria
Kanade on the other hand... she literally vanished
Serena showing could be explained in universe by Maria being too young (?) to remember what really happened
is Serena's VA confirmed for XV yet? or is it just speculation for now?
and the field goal is.... GOOD!
but you get what pay for
my Hibiki is actually second hand and in a poor shape, if I tried to hug her she'd probably break into pieces
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I mean, come on, whenever I'm feeling bad I just imagine she'd punch me until I was fine
it would be a blissful death <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I wish I had the energy to do the same for Hibiki
bring her back instead
an earned happy ending is very satisfying imho
I usually don't like happy endings too, but I feel the girls have really earned it by now
please let there be a happy, wholesome ending
I'm **almost** not sad Symphogear is ending because those girls really need a break
a movie
Chris complains but is actually very pleased
I figure they'd be all crashing Chris's place instead
zesshoushinais but it's after XV so hibimiku are now a really married couple
zesshoushinai but it's full time episodes
I'd watch the shit out of it
let's not forget the preceeding volleyball pass by Bikki
agreed
cause bikki
<@476058996315389953> that's the only way to end it
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Miku rn
I just had a terrible premonition: what if they The100 us and give Miku the Lexa treatment?
so aug 14 should be Miku's, then? 🤔
if the impending Miku disaster had been foreshadowed harder the show would've been as unwatchable as her nagareboshi video in s1
I'm ready for ep4, I'm not ready for the wait until ep5 though
that's lawful evil then
~~oh you mean the new fudou move~~
(not that I'm biased or anything <:MikuGay:336656810788388864> )
Hibiki's to me also gets #1 henshin sequence ever though
I understand your point Melua, it's just that at some point I'm really asking myself if I ever should be allowed to see what I'm seeing 🤔 even if it's not intrinsically lewd
it's KINDA on-character though, Kirika herself would DEFINITELY do some stunts like those just for shock value, but it does feel a little... less comfortable than what we got previously
I think you can say Symphogear's henshins were low-key on lewdness when you compare it to other anime, but if you kinda hopped onto Symphogear straight from western media... 😳
I actually think right now that THAT scene was over the line :< I may change my mind as XV goes on and all, but as of now it's something that's actually bothered me this season :<
>_< I'm not ready to like Millarc in any way
is it that hard to try to destroy the world without being a fucking shitty person
I guess that's another reason to love Carol so much, because before her we had Finé and Ver and come on
some of his lines even seem to be lifted right up from abuser recognition guidelines
Saki, agree 100% there, I was just trying not to specify what were the things :<
if that was the only facet we see of him, he'd be a better villain imho
my criticism on dr. ver he does some some things on the show that are very close to deserving a big red giant trigger warning for some folks, and those things don't actually contribute to the plot anything more than "establish he's a bad person" and all, but I do see the allure of the character once he goes all wacko and "last action hero" mode
I want more emo, empathetic but insane, cute villains <:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
I mean, Carol is one of the best villains in all fiction for me, because she hits that sweet spot
it's hard to get the kind of balance where you can REALLY empathize with villain... and still NOT root for them because they're fucking evil
and you've got those villains so justified they're almost anti-heroes, because so much is done to explain why they're doing what they're doing that the audience almost start seeing their point
with seemingly no motivation
there's the classic villains, "haha I'm bad I'm gonna destroy everything because I'm evil!"-kind of villains
but I'm still aboard Carol-best-villain train <:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
it must be Tsubasa
for tsurugi-chan
millarc must die
<:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
so she'll be killed by her own boss and never thought of again
I think they might use Millarc as fodder to show how evil Fudou really is
poor Miku <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
i don't do shounen
except that I figured out the show's names
I have absolutely no idea what the references are
I don't watch neither shaman king nor jojo
weird
basa with her father though
serena with maria could work, dmjii and mam
what about the opening's overghosts?
🤔
or you could have SG dueting with everybody?
I like that
oh Miku wearing Gungnir
inb4 Hibiki dons the reborn SSJ to save Miku from the Shem-ha bracelet 🤔
"oh there was another piece stored somewhere"
they could however handwave it like gungnir 2.0
no shounen, only (mahou) shoujo now
also GET HIBIKI HER SCARF BACK
no no no, don't make Hibiki suffer
oh no
and not in the way she's expecting to be
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
wait Noble Red is still on Fudou's side
no
no way
the thing is, on G it was a side plot that went nowhere, this time it's going to be the main plot of the season
I'm still betting Miku will offer herself in a prevent-Hibiki-from-doing-it kind of way
but if it was a clone of a cursed body....
I would guess it binds to the body
she's been transferred to Carol's body at the end of GX
she's Carol though
who's the third person?
Miku having dirty thoughts is just Miku thinking normally
that brings the question
Miku would never
perhaps Genjuurou told her something like "uh, don't log this"
it depends on how mum Elfnein kept her realization though
~~after getting fisted by Miku wearing it~~
I just wish Gungnir Faust Robe kept the scarf <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

right before her gear was broken
there's no way Tsubasa sides with Fudou if word gets to her he was ordering the Red Noble around
if he does.... then why he needed to send armed people there to stop them?
Symphogear by Shaft
is this a Madoka reference? 🤔
this is so Hibiki
she's probably NOT going to have "all green" on her gear
when Tsubasa and Maria get together I get the feeling they'd get a "and then they were both bottoms" moment
if we don't get a HibiMiku ending I'm rioting
I remember all the fool's stone plot arc, but the philosopher's stone went way over my head
I actually can't remember when exactly did the gears get infused with the PS tbh
~~fudou reverse raksasha~~
I don't think Fudou can fight the gears for the rest of the season ~~save for the ame no habakiri mashups out there~~
carry the season as in being the villains that the gears fought the most
yup, but st. germain crew DID carry the season even with the adam stuff
Maria and DMJii show up at ep 1 in G, carol and some autoscorers also ep 1, st. germain crew as well... I think we should already have had a glimpse of the villains
when does Chris actually show up back in S1? end of ep3? 4?
we'll need some new enemies for her to lose a fight though
Miku better be knitting some new scarfs for her girl before she ~~leaves to help fudou~~ gets kidnapped
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
get her another scarf then
~~hashtag get bikki a scarf~~
also bugging me: amalgam gear lack of bikki scarf
it's just that this particular thing was kind of bugging me, so I hopped on Burger Meister's question
I see
never knew this was a thing
ohhhhhhhh
what are those keywords everybody keeps mentioning?
still kinda confused though
got it, I guess
I will as soon as I get home, thank you both for your answers
ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
... nope, still nothing here <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> I really think I didn't understand when I saw it, rather than not remembering, though
I really did not fully realize how blessed I've been for being able to binge everything to AXZ until this season
I mean yeah they're the same person but still, Finé as Finé took a lot more than that
you're right, I was kind of conflating Finé/Sakurai in my head
ohhhhhhhhh Melua I didn't think of that
ok, we yuyuyu now then
we madoka now
oh god
oh god they're bullying the sword again tomorrow
for some reason I thought it was back from season 1
omg I just realized this picture is from the preview
tbf leave it to hibimiku to find time to bathe together in such perilous times
and binge the hell out of this season
I wish I could sleep right now and wake up on Sep 28th
let me have hope <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
well there's also the possibility that nothing that bad will happen, given how much depair-hype there was for last week's episode and we got nothing but wholesome stuff (save for the cliffhanger ending, that is)
~~Genjuurou: "LANDMINES DA TO?!?!"~~
there's the guy who ||kidnaps vivio in strikers||
I mean, yeah it's a weird reading, but the b-side title uses the exact same spelling instead of a kanji as well
I wasn't active on this discord then :< that's why I missed it then, haha
has it been discussed before how the "kami" kanji "unconventional" furigana reading on the poster is exactly the same on a certain hyped charsong b-side title?
I also love that on YagaKimi the focus is much more on the aro spectrum than on the gayness of it
it's just that it seems that there's this invisible wall between gay productions and non-gay productions, and that a show that is not ABOUT a gay relationship can't cross the line and have one made canon
(talking about gay productions, YagaKimi is a work of art)
will something like that ever happen in anime at all? in a few years perhaps?
I was under the (naive now that I think about it) impression that Korra's ending was something done to purposely break ground and that it was something the studio actually went to bat for
yeah korra's not happening. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
oh god.
it wasn't supposed to be the ending then?
holy fuck I didn't know that
how did the showrunners manage?
which is mostly the same reason I've seen given for it not happening to Symphogear (pandering to waifuers etc.)
sure, but I what I was trying to ask is, that must have been a hard sell for conservative and market oriented studio higher ups
and if is there anything like that happening that could happen to Symphogear
what context the show was inserted in that allowed the showrunners to take that step
I didn't follow (and actually never watched) Avatar when Korra's ending happened, but I saw the shockwaves afterwards and it really got me wondering what exactly made that decision possible then
because of all the hibimiku drumbeating preceding the season
I think status quo would make me even angrier than tragic
(cue nana)
it seems the show treats god's powers as a bad thing, and I think when it's said and done it's going to be exterminated
madoka... not impossible, but I think it's even less likely than korra, doesn't seem to fit too much into the show's themes I guess? 🤔
I think tragic or nanoha are the most likely, but I don't rule out korra and status quo
madoka ending, didn't think of that, but with God's power on the table it's actually a possibility 🤔
or anything else that I can't really think of right now
regarding hibimiku, what would be you folks's odds for:
- korra ending (surprise everyone and make hibimiku canon)
- nanoha ending (they get "married" and all, never explicitly stated though)
- status quo ending (they're still "best friends" and nothing really changes in their relationship)
- tragic ending (one of them or both die)
~~hand-holding~~ getting married
yay South America! <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
sweet dense lesbian
Lily, people probably pass on Hibiki's lines because it's actually very in character for her to be less... uh... aware of her own feelings
ninryu, there are dozens of us! dozens!
never thought I'd say something like that but here's hoping pink money is bigger than waifu money <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
please break ground Symphogear, I know waifu sales are big but you can make HISTORY! <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
and it also says ||let's live the rest of our lives together||
Hibiki's XV b-side ||actually even used the word "eiai", saying "I've got to answer your eternal love now"||
since I was under the impression that everyone who even watched was aware of it's gayness and ok with it
also my twitter bubble is the reason I came to believe Symphogear actually had a chance at a Korra ending
thankfully I have yet to see anyone questioning the gayness of Symphogear, guess my twitter bubble is a good one
best part of Sakura Trick to me is ||when they finally kiss saying they love each other||, I actually got emotional over that scene
and yeah I get it waifuers etc. but still rubs me the wrong way
they always compromise, even when dmjii is singing about kissing and saying how much they love each other
I think Symphogear keeps beating around the bush tbh, because although there have been a lot of instances where they HEAVILY stated the gay relationships, they ALWAYS leave an opening for saying "oh but just as friends"
I actually watched Sakura Trick for the romance and felt weird about the humongous amount of fanservice
but something more than the "taisetsuna tomodachi" stuff
I'm not much into fanservice actually tbh
as in "we're a couple", explicitly stated
I don't really expect a kiss or anything, what I really want from a show is an acknowledgement of the nature of the gay relationship
I'll look for PriPri then
||give sayaka a girlfriend AND YagaKimi a second season||
I don't really know what that is, I spent like 15 without watching anime and only started watching again late last year
I sure hope Hibiki lets Miku handle their finances though
gotta don the geah to support her wife
the "tadaima" scene <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I know akeupho, it's not a jab at the quote itself, it's just that it happened to symbolize the feeling
would she? didn't she and Miku's VA pretty much say it already that they play their characters as a married couple?
akeupho, I know that's not what Aoi meant and all, since the VAs pretty much support the ship, but that line reflects exactly what frustrates me in Symphogear: "it's different, it's special" and it stops JUST short of saying "it's romantic"
give or take 70k
I guess a Miku level incident would be enough to break Bikki <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I guess they can try again, Millarc herself wasn't too concerned when she failed, she just thought "oh so we do have to catch them off guard then"
a few episodes back
Millarc *did* try to do just that
<:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
carol being back for me automatically puts xv as at least the second best season of symphogear (the best being gx because... carol.)
with a new song to boot and a faust robe WITHOUT adult mode
CAROL IS BACK OMFG
no skipping the punching part for gramps
gramps need to get punched into retirement
fudou reverse rakshasa incoming
guess we'll know for sure tomorrow
the murderer of miracles line could very well be some subconscious echo
swiftarm, that's also not really clear tbf
https://streamable.com/c7jr this one
the VA's (I can't recall her name) live performance was also amazing
and genocide
because genocide
I like Carol's new song, but tbf Senkin Dur da Bla are hard shoes to fill
ohhh I didn't remember that
I just don't get why she cut the braids though
so to highlight that's Carol's body
I think AXZ/XV 119's hair is slightly less green tinted than original 119
I think the difference between their hair colors is subtle enough that it could be just Carol's hair
I'd really like to see true-Carol befriended, but I know that is very unlikely
well that's a befriending if I ever saw one, but it did only happen after Carol burned all her memories though
hamster jesus must befriend all her villains to be a true successor to Nanoha
well she didn't get befriended by Hibiki
like either of them can "come out" depending on the moment?
and then canon Carolnein but it's a ship <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
get a spare body at the Chateau for Carol then? 🤔
the best of each
like meshed personalities
I could live with a canon Carolnein
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
here's hoping she does some dissecting on Milaarc for sword's sake
I was actually literally screaming at my TV at the ending of the last episode
any Carol we get is a win for me
that also works <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
but it's probably the Carol fan in me talking
but I wouldn't be mad if it happened tbf
yeah, I know this is unlikely
(for the record I don't think this is *likely*, but it does sound like a twist Symphogear would pull on us)
thoughts?
closing the loophole of her being only main villain who Hibiki couldn't get through
so Carol is actually the main villain of XV and the ending is she finally getting BEFRIENDED by Hibiki
but once she does it, she goes back to her dissecting-the-world days
theory: Carol's back now, and she's powerful enough that she can somehow handle noble red/fudou/custodians and whatever
I mean it's like a given we're getting some plot twist at some point anyway
sadly <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
way likelier than my Carol-big-villain theory at least
that seems likely
although that weirdly big number being thrown randomly by noble red did seem suspicious
I didn't realize that
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
what is this bridge to the moon stuff, Kerrik?
please let it be a very thorough beat-up
anyway, all I know is that I'm gonna squee like crazy while Carol wipes the floor with noble red
but that's because I don't really like lewd in anime, and I know I'm in the minority in this one 🙄
between non-lewd smol vs. extra-lewd adult form I'll take the first
I personally think adult mode was a mistake
those noble red folks need some dissectin'
but I for one am rooting for full Carol <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I was so NOT ready for this. I think XV8 broke me
I myself have Back to the Future flashbacks from that phrase 😂
inb4 Shem-ha has a Miku stand
~~by the power of love~~
I'll take anything that gives us Miku back ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
If anything Elfnein's "rebuild" of Carol could be a Chekov gun for a future rebuilding of Miku though
I really hope the overwriting part doesn't stick 😦
They've also hit me with something I wasn't expecting, even with all the build-up, that was the heavily implied "overwriting" of Miku. To me that's the worst part of it all. XV8 left a worst taste in my mouth than XV2, I didn't even come here to discuss it afterwards because I was feeling very down because of it. If it weren't for chapter 44 of YagaKimi being released today I'd probably still be very much down and not really into discussing it yet.
Dino, cue Marty McFly and The Power of Love 😂
Hibiki better Kimi dake ni this custodian into oblivion Dino 😂
~~live your life now, can we live freely?~~
isn't there a movie almost certain?
I was so not ready for XV 😂
I really hope you're all right, but I'm still afraid
~~like Homura~~
she dead and she's coming back
well, I still think Miku *is* dead, but no way in hell she's gonna *stay* dead
I riot as well
also obligatory Homura did nothing wrong
Madoka's ending is very good.... for Madoka. Geah must end with HibiMiku.
I think they'd go for her being overwritten for a few episodes and then undoing it with some deus ex machina
that's what I'm hoping for, please be right Melua 😭
I mean there's no in-universe reasoning for Miku having been overwritten, but to me they did imply it with the eye opening scene
I don't really like hentai, but I respect hentai more than fanservice in non-hentai anime though >_< At least being clearly marked so I'm able to avoid it
is the JP fanbase expecting a happy ending?
<@506219877724454929>  for the record, that was my reference: https://youtu.be/-NMph943tsw
Dino, I don't think I can take that sad of a song right now 😭
how's the Japanese fanbase? since I don't speak the language I have no idea how they're taking XV or what they're expecting going forward
top dad warrants people getting mad
way to kill the hype geah
srsly we're getting fucking TOP DAD tomorrow???
https://twitter.com/heavenrend/status/1167858879109066752?s=21 how Tsubasa's seal REALLY got broken
elza literally exploded on-screen
well can't argue with that, ShemHa's dress is the bare minimum payment for the distress she's causing to Miku
but while we DON'T get there I'll be feeling down <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
if the payoff is good then all the suffering to get there is worth it
I can see that feeling down as I've been feeling about the show could be changed in a single episode
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
yup 😦
I can't say I was able to enjoy the last 2 episodes tbf
bikki: *arrives on the moon*
moon:
thank you Geah for reminding me of why I love you
so after getting my heart broken for two consecutive episodes I actually loved XV10 and now I'm hyped for moon episode next week
Madoka is pretty much an observer for most of the series
she's also arguably even more developed as a character than Madoka herself
Homura is arguably also a main character from Madoka tbf though
that's the kind of relationship I crave IRL
that's the moment it clicked for me how much I identify with her
Sycreon, that right there
yup, by that definition she definitely qualifies
it's sad because my favorite season of Nanoha is also the season where Fate is a bit on the background, 3rd series
ok, got it
does Fate qualify?
thank you ^^'
ohhhh right
Melua, forgive my Hibikiness, but what's a deuteroganist?
I can't objectively judge that because Miku is my main self-insert in this show, so by acknowledging that I'd be praising myself? 🤔
true love right there
and in that scene she'd just got beat by Hibiki at cards and instead of being pissed off she's just happy
because earlier in AXZ we got Miku's flashback of being insanely competitive and dropping it because she fell in love with Hibiki
that scene is so powerful
the only dirt I want Hibiki to eat is metaforically when she's being insanely cutely dense
no more bulli any geah please
put please no more bulli the hamster
oh god Miku wearing Gungnir I'd LOVE IT
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
XV12 HibiMiku duet, XV13 7-wielder X-Drive + Amalgam
hopefully when that happens Miku gets to keep shenshoujing faust robe and we get a 7  girl team <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
also the new face at the computer gave me hope of her being split off miku
thankfully with only a fraction of her power
*kami no chikara*
god power?
when bad animation is actually better than good animation
well I'm not complaining of getting more HibiMiku interactions though 🤔
* of a main character like Homura, I mean
I think it's unfair to compare her development with the developement of a main character, that's what I'm saying <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
Miku is a very well developed character *for a supporting one*
"hajime-ni kotoba" I was able to guess.... but ariki is something I had never seen before
OHHHHHH
what does the title of this weeks episode mean? sometimes it's harder to understand katakana than kanji...
power of love should be greater than power of language >_<
still hoping for SSJ Faust Robe vs. Shem-ha though
yeah, it's implied we're not getting Miku back
thanks for the link
oh. 😦 where can I read her keyword? I know the translation links have been posted before, but I didn't save it <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
get her her original body and give Miku back (along with SSJ faust robe pls), and I'm a happy fan
although Shem-ha's personality is very funny for a villain
that Miku's still there somewhere
at this point I'm just grasping for any hope
if not back for real, at least a glimpse of real Miku's thoughts
the tangled Miku preview pic gave me hope we're finally getting Miku back tomorrow
feed me cheesy, cheesy is why I watch this show
||kimi dake ni||
I believe in a happy ending now
also we got Miku and she's resisting
I screamed
IGNITION
wow
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
submarine!
submarine
~~inb4 Vanessa becomes a new sub for SONG~~
if any show is in a position to do that is Geah
I want to see Geah defy the waifuers
more canon than it is now, explicitly canon
yeah I know I'll probably riot
I will riot if we don't get canon HibiMiku
I'm not Chris
couldn't agree more ninryu
and it made things make a lot more sense imo
I really liked the infodump last episode, thought it was really well done
I'm up for fast pacing now actually
well, hello anyway ^^'
or Barty?
me?
the ||eiai henji wo shinakyatta ne|| line pretty much seals the deal actually
best possible timeline
inb4 Kimi Dake Ni on the show is actually a duet and we have new Miku parts that ||answer Hibiki's confession||
... not that it's a bad thing, the <:MikuSad:336657015961026560> is for the "just" part
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
... but we'll probably just get HibiChris tho
which would be best case scenario tbf
OR they trick us and give us BOTH duets
which would blow my heart to smithereens
we're in for a HibiMiku duet on XV13
if we only get Chris's
OR
we'll either get HikiChris duet amalgam on XV12 (since all amalgams have gotten duets so far)
for the HibiMiku duet in XV13
the dress and the SSJ Faust Robe as well
Chris, that might prevent her from eating what she's got to eat <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
can't wait to get Shinai Shemha
although this is perfection
the fanarts are better though
both from her getting more screentime finally and the fanarts' given personality
I learned to love Shemha
I don't think where's that ogawa emote when we need it
don't know if it was propaganda though
that there's some true love involved
Chris, I've read it's actually the author's dream show to make
lewd
Nanoha ending is what I'd bet, but I'm sharpening my pitchfork if we don't get a true romantic confession on screen with at least some ||handholding||
do it geah I have faith in you
I want to see a "I love you in a romantic way" confession, a "tsukiattete kudasai"
with all the suffering this season has brought upon the girls I can see this big fist
I thoughts it had been released
ohhhh
what’s the title for the last EP?
I loved today’s episode but I think there isn’t enough time left for us to get a satisfying ending 😦
kirika’s birthday will be on the shinais I’d guess
can still sing the opening theme top to bottom
I GREW UP on sharivan jfc I love it to death
Gyaban, Sharivan and Shaider
the red one
the second was Sharivan IIRC
it’s Gyaban isn’t it?
close second that one, Rosenweld <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
best moment to me is “I hope what you have to say is the same thing that I have to say”
I don't even like shounens though, and love Symphogear, so I say Symphogear is the only shounen I watch<:kiriAYAYA:611251978173022238>
I won't disagree, but I usually use sentai for 3d stuff
hot take: symphogear is a lesbian shounen
that right there
and since I'm a bit ~~Hibikey~~ dense it was the arm holding that finally screamed HAROLD to me
the way they hold each other arms is the cutest thing ever
the scene that really hooked me up is when Hibiki and Miku make up and take that picture in S1
I wouldn't mind forgetting it if I could get the feeling of watching it for the first time again tbf
(that's what I do with Frasier <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> )
I wish Symphogear got something like 10 26-episode seasons, because then we could watch it continuously since we'd have already forgotten the beginning by the time we got to the ending
did you really have to do it voy
ngl I might actually commission at least a picture of that scene, your idea actually resounded (see what I did here <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> ) deeply within me
<:ShirabeThink:611251942236094484>
I wish we got to see that, Ninryu
with all the SONG stuff going on it's actually kinda easy to forget everyone actually attend a music school and are probably proficient in multiple instruments
I mean I love Magical Girl Raising Project
I'm not against edge per se, I love S1 after all
yeah, that wouldn't work
but those two things kinda taint it for me
because XV objectively has some of the moments of the show
for all the edge of season 1, it never hit me like XV did, so that's why I'm on the fence
but I felt truly bad about those plot points
I don't know exactly why, I acknowledge it might be related to personal stuff and not an objective analysis
the girl killing and Miku's possession somehow triggered me.
ok I'm gonna do it I'm gonna use the word
Miku's posession also was done in a very angsty way to me, but I can't yet put my finger on what exactly bothered me so much about it
and it was worse that it had practically no narrative payoff
I respect your opinion, but to me it just made me feel bad 😦
except for pure edge
I see absolutely no reason whatsoever for the existence of that scene
heck they could have killed 100 thousand people offscreen and it wouldn't be as bad as the girl dying
also the concert massacre only served the purpose of making Basa hurt and stealing Miku after she got possessed, both things that could have been done without such a bad taste scene
so I'm not sure what I think of it as whole yet
but XV had also some of the best moments of the show
also chris and dmjii were kinda underused
the killing of the girl was to me the lowest geah ever got
I'm still on the fence about XV, I'll form a better opinion after I rewatch it on a binge but
(moving here for XV)
it's almost like you're doing it on purpose voy <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
*suddenly flashes back to bushi noise* <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
wait, she drew it herself?
hey it's not hand holding, it's only arm holding
but then they kinda faded out
it actually started pretty well for them, the first fight with elsa aboard the ship was amazing
XV does have emotional, controversial scenes, so it does make sense to compare the emotional impact of them to other works which do have these kinds of scenes
even saying exactly what kind of spoiler it contains
I'm comparing XV to other works and putting stuff behind spoiler tags
(washio no sumi HEAVY spoilers)
||gin's death|| didn't hit as hard as the little girl and boy it did hit
Washio no Sumi best chapter
I even love YuYuYu
so it didn't make feel BAD (well Asuka got more than a few eyerollings, but still)
it is edgy and over the top, but like you said, it doesn't feel personal
I even lo... well, endured Tokushusen Asuka
just in case it wasn't clear I mean the leadership of protestants and catholics, not the person who goes to church on Sundays and strives to be a better person
to me the catholic church is like Finé, did some really bad, unforgivable shit, but they actually believed what they were doing. protestants is what you get when you let the dr. vers out to play
if am I to believe the news I get from the US, I'd be weary of that
martin luther and the protestants
<@!182890099183190018> I mean, the guys who spawned from questioning the buying sins back stuff aren't exactly that ok as well
personally the "stop being gay", "women are inferior" and etc. are exactly what works me up
after all Homura did nothing wrong 😌
my take is the Philip Pullman take, if an abrahamic god actually existed I'd probably be siding with the other guy
"I can't retcon the show by now so I'm gonna retcon reality"
maybe he's the one who wrote it after realizing his mistake? 😂
to make things worse, I just recently stopped straightening my hair, and I had to cut it really short for it to get healthy again, which makes me look very masculine and triggers a lot of bad feelings
Just turned 34 😭
<@173112001684439040> heteroromantic, bisexual?
I guess I'm just too old to go that route
I myself currently identify as non-binary/genderqueer, but to tell the truth I'm probably a closeted trans woman who will never have the guts to transition anyway
nice ☺
would I be wrong to assume this a pretty inclusive/progressive place, Symphogear being a show about singing lesbians and all?
I also kinda find it funny how that meme "anime made me trans" is actually kinda real for me
I'm also not a hugger IRL, but virtual hugs I'll take without hesitation <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I do!
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
me too
ohhhh got it
oh, a church
LDS?
<@189146272865845248> I feel that, when I told my mother I was non-binary she absolutely didn't understand anything, but at least she was nice about it
that's why I asked first if this was a progressive place 🤔
and this here is the first time I do that "online"
<@127644949884698624> I have been recently coming out about being a closeted trans woman to very close friends (I was already pretty much out about being non-binary though), that has been a freeing experience to be honest
https://www.stonewall.org.uk/node/110736
Saki, you heard right
my country is actually the world leader in trans people murders yearly
sorry for the ping
yeah, Sorry
uh
<@127644949884698624>  I'm actually in... South America 😂
Okie, thank you, Saki! 😃
I'm so sorry you had to go through that, Sakimori
scared doesn't begin to describe it, Sakimori, I'm terrified
(I'm very weak lol)
although I personally wouldn't do that because I'd probably get beaten pretty badly afterwards 😂
<@!302063351767498752> I think that's understandable tbh
although their incompetence to do (much) harm has been calming
yup
<@!102691114762371072> politics being shitty reminds about last year's election in my country. when the fascist got elected I legit cried for hours, never have been so damn sad about politics in my whole life
<@486087033652248576> 😦
Saki, I think you should take Chris to an all-you-can-eat restaurant if you really want her to be happy though 🤔
Saki ❤ I love Kiri a lot as well, and Shirabe is my 2nd self-insert in this show because of that (although I love Hibiki above all else, as all good Miku's should)
I can self-insert HEAVILY into Miku, and this is one of the reasons I love Symphogear so much 😂
yup Saki, most of those self-insert characters are completely directed at cis men
(it's not a coincidence I use Miku as a nickname)
I do like stuff for waifu reasons, but I mostly picture myself being the waifu 😂
Sailor Moon was HUGE to me in my formative years ❤
I was a huge otaku when I was a teenager, but suddenly decided it was too childish for me and stopped watching almost completely for about 15 years. then late last year I came back and it's been a wild ride (although I have to credit figuring out I was not cis to my ex, who was actually very nice in hinting me towards my realization)
spoilers are bad but please go watch XV if you haven't got the chance yet
oh got it
I guess it didn't work
uh?
Saki, how do I spoiler hide things on discord? I'll edit my message
Saki, if Val Verde is proxy for current South America... they're pretty much nazis lol
hibiki punching ||Fudou|| (<-XV3 spoiler)
that's a nice thought
OH HIBIKI PUNCHING NAZIS
that is enough <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I mean, there just has to be one nazi-puncher around the nazi when they start talking
I just personally would though 🤔
<@189146272865845248> not really, I don't actually think EVERYONE should punch nazis given the chance
amen to that, FizzyFusion
he got on to twitter to complain he was afraid he would get punched again iirc
punching them is actually a good deterrent, that guy whose name I don't remember got punched live on television and stopped going out in the open spill bullshit because of that
the way I can explain this stuff is like, for a very long time being a nazi was absolutely not an acceptable thing in western society and culture, and even the full-blown nazis were very shy to admit it. recently there has been an inverting tendence, in which this kind of belief gradually has become acceptable again
I'm on Team Saki on that one
I miss the time when nazis were the go-to villains for every hollywood blockbuster
although I feel nothing but good things for people who punch nazis
Saki, is there anywhere where we can read it?
I can RP Miku pretty easily since she's basically me thrown into a sci-fi setting 🤔
I have no idea how tumblr works tbh, I never really got into it :/
I wouldn't be surprised if those people actually here tbh 🤔
I've recently been having serious fun with some RP accounts some folks set up to act like the main wielders
it's @ugopozo if you want to check it out, I follow almost every Symphogear account I find so that my TL is now something like 90% Symphogear
Melua, it's a mix of Portuguese, English and Japanese to be honest
I used to keep track of these things more closely when I followed the NFL but recently my team has been a mess so I kinda gave up <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
EST+2 perhaps? I don't really know, it depends on whether EST is on winter time, I think
I kind of guess UTC-3 this time of the year is something like EST+1? 🤔
UTC-3 here
not really what we use where I live <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I've mistaken PM and AM, sorry
oh god
ohhhhh that's late
on CR at least
I'm blessed that Symphogear comes out at 3PM Saturday for me
I do have friends who like anime, but they mostly like shounens, even getting them to watch Madoka has been hard
Voyeur, RIGHT? I can only scream about XV on twitter and now here
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
"friends" who never bothered to try to watch Symphogear though <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
up until recently I only used it to get on voice chat to game with my friends
discord etiquette sometimes will get over my head until I'm fully acquainted
I'm not really used to discord tbh
uh I'm sorry
<@189146272865845248> EXACTLY
people (specially old, non-tech savvy, conservative people) have come to trust apocryphal news they get on WhatsApp more than mainstream media
here in South America they have turned to WhatsApp to spread fake news
I was just kidding, go with Shirabe 😄
Shirabe herself actually need more emoting to be fair <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
if I RP'd Hibiki I'd probably Mary Sue the hell out of her tho
but that would require a Hibiki twitter as well <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I may or may not do a Miku twitter, perhaps 🤔
Saki, Elfnein twitter pleeeease
Thank you! <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
although I mean, if she doesn't have feelings for either of you.... no harm done then 😊
idk, shit happens, all the time
so it might be best to just accept some things are going to change and deal with the emotions that come out of it, even if they don't get everyone happy
and even though feelings might get hurt, it's still a learning experience that will change the persons involved somehow
but it's a three person situation, not a two person one
it is a tricky situation and probably there's no way out of it without someone getting sad and/or mad
also, I think considering the girl's feelings and agency is important, since she's a fully-fledged person that is somehow (I... guess?) involved in this situation
of course, no arguments there. what I tried to convey is that, even with some damage, eventually the friendship could be mended, or even just change how it is, since human relationships naturally evolve over time anyway
I think either you or your friend should be able to accept the girl has agency over this if she picks one or the other
I mean the friendship should survive if it's something the girl decides for herself
maybe she does have a crush on one of you?
a little late here, but I'd also want to consider the girl's feelings on this one
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I'm from Brazil!
Hi!
I mean, if you don't push it
I don't think it's particularly rude or anything, and it can be seen as cute, as long as it's not forceful or anything
I uh.... you mean a stranger? someone you just met? someone you're an acquaintance of? as in, brazilian cultural practices?
threatening suicide to your SO is a very, very bad thing to do
oh ok I don’t usually ship straight couples but I’ll open an exception for you <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
might I ask if you’re a girl or a boy?
I’m hoping for a happy ending though
time heals everything, it will be awkward for a while but eventually the dust settles
(don’t diss casablanca in front of me else you get the shooting star <:AngerDess:535188304165994506> )
best case scenario, well, as rick blaine would put it, “I think this is beginning of a beautiful friendship” <:MikuGay:336656810788388864> <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
before you get even more attached
worst case scenario is you are actually a rebound to her and she doesn’t see much of a future in that relationship, and if that’s the case and it means so much to you, the earlier you know, the earlier you can move on
recipe for a healthy relationship, straight from someone who wasn’t able to do neither of those things in the past and paid a hefty price <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
talk, communicate, share, don’t let SOs in the dark
get this out of your chest because it’s not going to do you any good keeping it to yourself
never, ever say you “want to talk” and withhold the subject
just tell her you have something important to tell her and that you wanna meet, and GIVE HER A TL;DR PRIOR
that’s up to you, but were I in your shoes, I wouldn’t wait much
be straightforward and tell her her mate told you, and that you didn’t actually go prying into her private business (well I’m assuming you didn’t because that’d be a really shitty thing to do)
I mean, if you do care about her you should tell her you know, imho
I mean healthy relationships are built on trust and communication ig
like you just did here actually <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
it really seems like a concern that can be easily solved (or not, but if that’s the case better early than late) by just sharing your feelings
are you in a position in which you’d be comfortable talking about it with her?
> but the artist *based him on samuel jackson*

I see this as huge win. if anything it made nick fury more badass he ever had been.
