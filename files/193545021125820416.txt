Yo
Because alchemy
Though their spirits live on
A shame they died
That's some good art

The day before my birthday
July 6th
In this wildass show
I just love how the cast are really well known actress/singers
I haven't found that same spark I have with Symphogear
With all the edgy magical girl shows lately
When Symphogear ends, we won't get another anime quite like it
As long as it doesn't go Game Of Thrones on us
Or a new series altogether
<@265617214931992576> That's before the edgy wayve
How the hell did that explode so fast?
Just went on the Reddit post
Now we wait for the transformation to be on reddit
I’m saving that
That pic with the magical girls
I can see the Symphogear girls walking down enemy territory
https://youtu.be/zXGCrPmh0A4
I can see this happening in the future
With the way the season is going
I'm waiting for Fine to return
Right now
Or afterwards
In the final battle
Honestly, they will most likely return in the end
In Maria’s mind that is
But didn’t Serena still made an appearance in AXZ
I mean I don’t mind getting them benched
I mean, this is apparently a big threat occurring
I hope the Autoscorers can make it out alive at least
We will most likely get a new cast when the girls graduate
From 2014 to 2016
It was a two year break
When you think about it
When it gets personal
The way Fudou betrayed Noble Red was fucked up
Or it will end up worse
It's better for it to end now
Wait, the episode is out?
Me in a sense
Will the next episode be out on Sunday or Saturday?
Where a new cast came
Hopefully, it's not like with Senran Kagura
A new cast would be good
Same
I don't mind it returning
Personally, it's fine the way it is
Or an OVA
If Symphogear ever returns, it will most likely be with a new cast
I'm just glad that the series ended on a high note
To be honest, I'm just glad that Symphogear didn't end up like Madoka Magica
Her too
She was in Blazblue
Aoi Yuuki did acting before Symphogear
You got the seiyuu of Rachel Alucard
I didn't even notice
Yeah
Oh god no
Such as the Japanese VA for Ruby Rose and the incest pillar
When you consider the new anime VAs
<@87512939107450880> That's not really hard
As someone who used to go to Tumblr, yes
Well this is the serious discussion channel
Where all the fan art go?
So what's the next Tumblr site?

Main games
Any Blazblue players here by any chance?
