<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
I'm trying to reconfigure my IME so I can scream in hirigana more
Well MagiRecord recently got an English translation, so anything is possible
<@486087033652248576> You live in Val Verde?
More screaming than all of Black Clover
ああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああ
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Ok, I wasn't able to comment earlier, but
Miku was mentioned at he end of AXZ as well
ああああああああああああああああああああああああ
Hm, mozc is giving me a problem
Still learning fcitx
ああああああああああああああああああああああああ
Ok, so now my input should be working
I forget, is that actually her name or is it a nickname?
<@138380189741744128> I'm still trying to figure out if there's some meaning I can attach to the negative temperature value
*This is not Finé*, this is Patrick.
Ok, it's Shirabe
Huh, I just realized I was so hyped up from XV that I completely forgot to watch Toonami
They said it's summer in the Southern hemisphere
Just as in the series, alchemy is the thing which existed before science and magic diverged, so could the phonic structure of the Gears be the primordial union of language and music.
One is that music and language both evolved from the same primitive communication process, which would tie very neatly to the more esoteric themes of the Tower of Babel and such.
There's some interesting scientific theories that could be used in Symphogear
Ok, so I was at work, but I just watched the ep, and the archived threads appear to consist mostly of screaming
I actually at first didn't realize her transformation sequence included a stripper pole.
Does it *have* a gender?
Was it even human?
But yeah, I've said the concert hall's architecture makes no sense
Actually, the Tokyo Big Sight shares the elevated nature of the concert hall
Roof of Heaven I guess
lol
With Tsubasa's record, all of  SONG and the 2nd Div should be there for security.
lol
<@185949743321579520> It's like the kind of thing you build primarily to prove you *can*.
Most of them just turned into red dust though (at least it didn't seem fluid enough to be blood to me, but I could be wrong)
There are only a few excuses to build something like that under *any* circumstances. One of which would be if the space underneath held something like a bridge or other roadways
lol
<@440138597539119114> Height is expensive. Building a hall suspended on stilts like that, with all that unused space, is economically absurd.
That cone at the top actually looks like it could be a concert venue
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intempo

pew pew



Wait, actually, I may have some examples of buildings similar to the concert hall
With showing DESS
Boobs are *always* necessary
Of course, if you're *really* concerned that something is going to go "boom" at an inopportune moment, you drag it out to the middle of White Sands Missile Range to the south and work on it there.
It's the sort of place one would expect study of weird things like Relics to take place, since it's a high-end government research facility, specially designed for national security-sensitive projects as well as fundamental physics.
Los Alamos National Laboratories
<@152896851660505088> 70k is significant because it's about the amount of people who died in the Hiroshima bombing.
Where? Keywords?
<@115583025177296901> To be fair, bag-in-box containers of condiments do bear more than a *passing* resemblance to IV drip bags.
Like instead of dying, the aliens actually took her in and made her one of them or something, which is how Tsubasa was able to get those visions of her.
Personally, I keep hoping for a Kanade spirit or something.
Though I recall that the "determination to fist" thing was a botched translation
<@!99695384296701952> I did kind of notice that
Something nutty like that.

Article 13, United States Code?
You will and YOU WILL LIKE IT
meow
proxies!
Ha ha
Ha Ha
HAHAHAHAHA
Like people's heads will melt if they put an ACTUAL CANONICAL LESBIAN COUPLE on screen
<@263545619426181122> No, it feels vaguely homophobic to me
Like ffs, would it have killed you to have ended with a single "daisuki da"?
I'm still kind of miffed they cut off HibiMiku's confession.
<@211827730403164160> I feel it was a little rushed, but I'm not quite sure what could be done with that
<@263545619426181122> not any more open of a plot point than Kill la Kill, and that's wrapped up.
The universe is a big place, you know
Doesn't mean they'll come back
<@155150213445582850> She did things that were kind of out there. I thought she was a Custodian.
I don't know actually
Shocking Truth!
Fine was an ayyy lmao
We need a North American live tour
Chris' only thing is she was probably hurt too much to have a romantic relationship in the present.
I thought that was Kanade?
LAAAAAA
Chris is straight
The fact that there's "no other conversation they could be having" just makes it even more aggravating.
It's still silly.
<@!99695384296701952> Yeah, and that's "plausible deniability" is a goddamn cop-out.
Hm, can one come up with a good mapping of the girls to the classical planets?
and the seventh main
The six major characters
It would be more fair to argue between Hibiki and Tsubasa.
The character who *indirectly* causes the events of the plot is not the MC.
No, that doesn't really shake out.
In the tradition of GuP, I prefer tank guns.
how about a howitzer?
a cannon kiss?
Unless the shinais manage to tie up all the lose ends.
A movie would not be bad
Just a footnote
Yeah no, I'm done.
Ironically, despite perhaps featuring LGBT people in a greater proportion of its cultural works than most other places.
Japan is on its way to becoming the last OECD country to have no form of gay marriage or civil unions.
What things? Merch? BDs?
It'd be funny if the writer just casually said on Twitter, "Oh yeah, they'd legally marry if they could in Japan" or something like that.
What they do as far as additional works will likely depend on how well the stuff from this season sells
Hold on, I have to walk across town. bbl
I'd still say Tsubasa is Jupiter, unless I have reason to say otherwise.
Those are the non-fixed bodies visible in antiquity
The sun, moon, mercury, venus, mars, jupiter, and saturn
The ones I listed
*Classical* planets
Shirabe is Venus
Earth isn't a classical planet
Kirika is Mercury
Maria is Saturn
Tsubasa is Jupiter
Chris is Mars
Hibiki is the moon
Miku is the sun (sunshine)
That's the point of combat. Hurting the other person.
Or is it late and I'm not remembering right
Didn't he kinda job to Fudo?
children, behave yourself or I will give you a taste of my SHOE!
Is it similar to waterboarding, or would you prefer waterboarding to that? <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I'm a radical socialist, so if you want to bring up the question of what's radical or not, that's my cup of tea.
Aye
Yes, but I don't go around mentioning them specifically. I just chalk them up as another species of reactionary.
<@!102691114762371072> No, but it definitely helps. Otherwise it just sort of came out of nowhere.
Ok, that makes a *lot* more sense now.
Oh, you said "we", are you trans?
I agree with the stance, but...
<@106861977086779392> Did you eat anything atypical?
oh, so the gender equivalent of closet
egg cracked?
because I strongly identify with magical girl characters
My personal joke is, "The world's first and only Magical Boy (patent pending)"
(I am a little, but not enough that people get confused IRL)
And I'm not appreciably GNC
Because my voice sounds *that* feminine on the phone.
Yesterday on the phone, I had a secretary at my doctor's office *insist* I was a woman. I had to physically show up to convince her that I was indeed me.
ah, ok
Astolfo I'm less sure of.
Lily is trans.
I once had a conversation with an MTF who *identified* as a tr\*p
And that was back in, what, 2009?
I swear it started as a meme. I saw it on 4chan as one.
It's a slur *when applied to trans people*, but it's not categorically one.
I always thought tr\*p is orthogonal to trans. Like, a character or person could *look* feminine but identify as a man and by chromosomally male.
White gangsters tend to get called "punk" or something
Like 95% of the time, people use it in reference to Blacks
Also, "thug" has racial implications, <@106861977086779392>
Another joke of mine: "I identify as a gentleman, a pervert, and a magical girl."
<@437292788611153931> I'd love an immersive neuro-VR game that would allow me to be female, but essentially for perverse sexual reasons.
LOL
No, I only ever played male characters. I'd play a female one only if it gave me a chance to look at her butt.
That's why I say, "I identify as a meme", because identities to me are just societal memes.
Awww, but I liked that joke. But not to mock the non-binary, but to mock the idea of identities altogether.
I identify as a meme
I identify as "me", honestly. Every thing else is a pointless label.
In many contexts online, I prefer not to give my gender at all.
No, I'm definitely a man, but gender just isn't a big part of my personal identity.
<@106861977086779392> Did you do anything exerting? Is it very warm where you are?
When you bite into a cake and find it's a flavor you don't like, people don't fly into a homicidal rage at the cake or baker.
<@!99695384296701952> Gay panic I see as something a lot different and worse than merely being turned off.
<@!99695384296701952> No, it comes from when a male is browsing porn, which usually starts from a clothed state and strips progressively. So if a person or character is anatomically male, one doesn't find out until one is quite far into the picture gallery, usually provoking a disgust/deception reaction.
I remember that caused a major problem when a courthouse installed a *glass* staircase.
Also, I never understood why a lot of women's clothing, especially formal clothing, is open at the bottom.
But I also use string bags or full backpacks. It's more of a utility thing than a fashion thing.
I have a concert tote that I sometimes use in a purse-y way.
Yeah, I always thought the reason women's clothing lacked pockets was because they are expected to carry purses
I'm not a fashionista. I wear plain or concert/anime/con t-shirts
ok, I was careful because I'm on some servers that like to auto-ban or auto-warn on certain words
Like is tr\*p auto-banned on this server? It's a perfectly appropriate word when used in contexts like military tactics, hunting, and animal control.
It's almost never the case that words *themselves* are bad, but their *usages*
And in the right context, it *can* be race-neutral, but it requires some care.
They are *nominally*
One of my favorite Western webcomics has a magically-changed MC, but it was deliberately written as a commentary on trans issues, as the author's (father? not sure the exact word to use) was trans, and died from complications of HRT.
<@209036464900538371> Nothing wrong with it, it's just not my taste
Yeah. I could not be attracted to Ranma for the above reason.
What's that anime with the hot and cold water thing?
Hence "fictional"
I meant like when characters get magically transformed.
No, I wasn't.
I would admit that I would not be sexually interested in a trans woman. I am not very attracted even to fictional characters who are mentally male in some way (gender-benders).
I'd actually want to see a more scientific survey of that.
Nothing, I was just surprised at the statement, so I asked for clarification.
Yes, but not in the context I asked that question. Like I said, reptilian.
I was for the purposes of that question categorizing "no" as "pre".
It's relevant only because some of the circuits we're talking about operate on a very reptilian level, and may not even understand some of the concepts like gender identity, presentation, and orientation.
(another arbitrary distinction, but of possible relevance)
Pre or post?
Yes, but the union of the sets of gynophilic males and androphilic females is typically called "straight people"
No, talking to straight women as well I usually hear likewise
I said "generally", in part because in my conversations with *other* straight people, I usually hear the same thing.
Well that's you. I am expressing my own experiences as a straight male.
People who say, "If it's cute, fuck it" I tend to think are probably bi at some level.
If you are genuinely straight, you generally *aren't* interested sexually in someone who has the same genitalia as you. That's kind of the definition. You start becoming aroused because you *think* the subject is your preferred sex/gender. And since arousal suppresses the disgust instinct, I can imagine why disgust would come flooding back in once the arousal stops.
It's not that I find it uncomfortable per se, just that I'm not into them.
Characters too young get mentally lumped into the "daughteru" category instead of the "waifu" category, so to speak.
Yes, but it's what I said about "buttons to press"
Not in most of Japan
Bikki I also find somewhat hard to lewd, like she's below my age range
<@!102691114762371072> Actually, another thing: I often partially identify Discord users through their avatars, and yours looks kinda too young and innocent to press any of my buttons
they make *words*
talking with characters
Slip of the tongue. I often mentally think of text chat as closer to speech than writing (like e-mails, comment threads, and forum posts), so I sometimes make that mistake.
Written form, rather
That's what I'm doing in verbal form
It's like for me there's a "biological" circuit, and a "mental" circuit, and for trans men or women they just about cancel each other out.
<@!263983345669505025> Human sexuality *is* confusing
That's just the raw feeling I'm getting thinking about it
<@!102691114762371072> Hmmm, neutral actually.
And what was that quip from Monogatari? "If looking at her makes you want her to have your babies, it's love."
<@!102691114762371072> Not physically, bodily. Because I do want to possibly have children as well.
I don't think or ask for anyone's base impulses to be "politically correct". I only ever ask that they exercise those higher cognitive functions which our species has to avoid allowing those impulses to adversely affect others.
I like floats 🍨
<@!266379640069685252> It's called vanilla
The text could otherwise be *exactly* the same, and I may have *never* seen the person in question, but the very word from her that she is female instantly turns every sexual thought, quip, or discussion from her into a turn-on.
Again, to me, "female-ness" at some mental level is itself attractive. Like when people online discuss their fetishes and sexual habits, it usually disgusts me *unless* the person discussing it has said she is female.
No
To reference my *hilarious* HS biology teacher, I'm kinkier than a polyunsaturated fatty acid.
Some I have bookmarked
I've lost track of mine
I also call it, "Freud's law"
Rule 51 I think
But maybe that's just me
Yeah, except I can't find a fetish in it.
The strip is Misfile, if anyone's interested in it. It's also heavy on car and tuning stuff.
But even though in the entire strip the MC is *never* depicted as male, I simply cannot find the MC attractive, despite otherwise having a very curvaceous body.
Yeah, but society advances, and we learn more things and come to understand better. The same principles can yield different results depending on the facts fed into them.
Yes, but much the same consequences can come from apostasy in some of those very countries, yet freedom of religion is a very big thing in the US especially.
It's a talking point I usually use with more right-leaning individuals, to phrase it as a matter of *liberty* instead of *social justice*.
Well people can choose to base jump or join the circus.
People use essentialism to defend LGBT rights, but I've argued on an "even if..." level, that should not be *necessary* to do so.
Like I've said, "What would it matter if people *could* choose to be gay or straight? Shouldn't they be free to make that choice if they want to?"
At some level it's philosophy, if there's no concrete implications.
I sometimes think these things might be more fluid than the current conventional wisdom, but idk,idc.
I mean, politically, tactically, all that matters concretely to me is, "Can you pick up and carry a gun?" If you can do that, I don't care what your gender, race, or even species is.
remember, fist: 1, logic: 0
<@284390402210136064> For those people I usually recommend a good fist
Then don't give them the time of day if they won't give it to you.
<@437292788611153931> A local-language equivalent works too
<@!102691114762371072> Yes, that's what it means.
I just say, *watashi wa, watashi dess*. Perhaps you should try it sometime when people ask questions like that. <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
(At least that's the usual Marxist theory)
Well as the saying goes, "the personal is political", but to reference Marx in *On the Jewish Question*, your liberation is bound up in *making* your sexuality non-political.
And many people, myself included, felt that complaint was disrespectful of *our* sexuality, to imply that we should have sex with someone based on essentially *political* considerations, when much of what we've been fighting for over the past half-ish century was to keep sexuality *out* of the realm of political involvement.
To put it *very* crudely
where *x* is someone's gender, and *y* is the desired gender of their sexual partner, it's, "I'm *x*, why don't cis *y* want to have sex with me once I mention I'm trans?"
Different subject
No, that's not what it means.
<@437292788611153931> Basically
And straight females, I'm typing without thinking very much
And gays, also
Lesbians and females too, analogously
It was apparently coined by a trans porn star to express the unwillingness of many cis males to have sex with trans females.
But the "cotton" refers to undergarments.
Well, apparently people used it in a number of different ways
No, but one point of contention: some years ago there was this meme going around about a, "cotton ceiling"
to each their own
Why do you think I said I identify as a magical girl? Because our world is in such desperate need of one, and in the words of Rabbi Hillel, "If not me, then who?"
Some of it is also that I see so much wrong with our world, that feelings and language are like, near the bottom of my triage list so long as people are *dying*.
I don't see it as trauma, but it does mean I find it hard to understand how words affect others.
Maybe it's just that I've been insulted so much as a kid and through the internet that I've really become numb to it all. I've had death threats, even people track down my address. I've had to not let words affect me or else I'd be in a mental ward.
Which is not right. 🙇
And I clearly did something to make you anxious in that way.
Saying something shouldn't be harmful is not the same as me being unconcerned when it is. I didn't mean to upset you, <@!102691114762371072>
Crap
<@!99695384296701952> I don't claim a right, merely a convenience in brevity.
If everyone executes it
No, I figured we all already had the second down, so I was advocating for the first.
Both can be good ideas
I think they only harm as much as people let them, and it would be better for us all if we didn't let them do so.
Language *coordinates* our behavior, but it does not make it. This isn't *Symphogear* where we can make stuff happen with the right pseudo-Sumerian chanting.
I will not on account of your server authority
No, I don't agree. Swords harm, bullets harm, fists harm. Words do only what we have them do.
Someone could be a racist prick and use all the right wordings. I've seen people do it.
It's just a shorthand as far as I'm concerned. Like I've said, I'm not big on labels. Really, the way I show respect is in the *content* of what I say, not the phrasing. *Acta non verba*.
Notice I said "Whites" as well. My method of showing respect in text format is to capitalize the initial character, as a proper noun.
Races are social constructs. That they are not pretty and are dehumanizing and superficial is the nature of the beast. I don't think being more verbose changes that.
Not to mention that's *also* a skin-tone designation.
That's more broad though
I use that to mean all people of African ancestry, regardless of country, since I'm also talking about the British Empire as well.
To break the racist lie that they were just a somewhat more intelligent form of livestock.
Like I said that a major part of abolitionism was work, usually by Blacks themselves, to convince Whites that they *were* human, and they *were* capable of all the same things given a chance, and thus they had the same right to liberty as everyone else.

What business was he in?
Is it open-invite?
No
Yes, kids are little shits. I would know. I was one.
Jesus would have been a socialist
By the way, if any of you here are leftists of any stripe, I have servers I can invite you to.
But it's evidence in favor of that direction, no?
Sarcasm is usually conveyed by a continual rising pitch (reset with each sentence break).
eh, rising or falling pitch are pretty much the only two distinctions I can think of.
*In theory*, you could use different font styles, like bold vs underline, but in practice they are either synonymous or convey different degrees of emphasis.
Yeah
So you need context instead
<@!182890099183190018> But of course, intonation is hard to convey in English text, even when you have emphasis available, because it doesn't show *which* emphasis you're using.
No, I said "like", giving a synonym for the second case
If it's emphasized at a *higher* pitch, it's positive, like "oh, cool, you're an X" when you can't quite remember what X is, or it's too lengthy to say.
<@!182890099183190018> In speech, "You're one of those people" has different connotations depending on the intonation. If "those" is emphasized at a lower pitch than the rest of the sentence, yeah, it's negative.
Moe yo konton muteki desu!

I wanna chaos!
Dafuq happened in here?
Bureacracies fuck things up. News at 11:00...
Honestly, I suspect we will never know the answer. Tropical climates are great at destroying evidence, and so is war. The whole region suffered both. The plane may have been taken apart by natives or soldiers for scraps, and the rest exposed to seawater until it crumbled to dust. Her body may have been eaten by sharks or ground into fertilizer or assumed to be those of a dead serviceman and buried in a military cemetary somewhere. We'd never be able to tell.
However, people have also pointed out that the journal the results were published in is not high-quality, the findings are highly speculative at best, not well supported. There are also a number of alternative hypotheses which have supporting evidence as well, like she crashed on Japanese-occupied Saipan and was captured, with the bones and the aircraft lost over the course of the war.
Also, Earhart was unusually tall for a female, by several inches.
The bones *were* identified as Caucasian (there are a few ways to tell), which is obviously not Pacific Islander
Kiribati
All they have are the measurements, which match hers.
They're still not 100% sure though, since the bones were lost
Especially in 1940 when the analysis was made
Side note: I once brought a real leek into a Hatsune Miku concert. Afterwards I took it home and ended up grilling it.
The leek consents, and so do I. Sounds like we're good.
Maybe if I beat them hard enough, they'll become allies. I mean, it worked for the Gears and Nanoha.
Ok, can I beat them *almost* to death with a leek then?
Illegal I don't care much about. Unjust I strongly disagree.
If they say "dilate", they're probably a fascist.
Awww, why can't you allow it?
Yes, but I am asking that, in addition, I be allowed to murder them with a vegetable.
Thank you very much.
To all mods and users: If someone comes in to this server and starts using "dilate" in what appears to be a form of insult, please inform me so that I can beat them to death with a leek.
So more like a small business loan?
Student loans are kind of like a mortgage on yourself, come to think of it.
I have to pay tuition, so no.
<@!90229127075893248> Oh, PM me the invite then
duly noted
Oh, that's a thread, not a discord server, I think.
really?
Not really sure *why* I subject myself to it.
And I've been on that website in some form or another since 2009.
Me neither
Anyway, 4chan, having no sensitivity to or understanding of LGBT issues and the emotional maturity of a delayed 12-year-old, thought this was funny for some reason.
That's why I'm recounting the origins
Too late. I'm just recounting *fait accompli* now.
Apparently at some point during the stream, she excused herself to perform such a dilation.
Nor do I. I was talking about how the term became an insult.
I found the thread where the insult originated. Apparently 4chan's video game board was watching a somewhat prominent trans-woman's Let's Play stream.
<@175163984197058560> Yeah, that's the meaning they were getting at
Precisely
At the beginning, I neither wholly believe nor wholly disbelieve the accusation. It simply *is*, a piece of evidence against the accused. It's strong, and deserving of being taken with all seriousness, but that does not automatically translate into proof. The fact that there are eight accusers however definitely makes the scales lean heavily towards their veracity.
And the law is not, "legal bs", it's the backbone of justice, and a check against the power of the government to destroy people. If humans were angels, we would have no need for laws, but then also people wouldn't be raping and abusing each other.
<@!99695384296701952> <@175163984197058560> I doubt everyone and everything. I'm not making judgements or calling anyone liars, but I also know human memory is fallible, which has led to awful things like the Scottsboro Boys, the Central Park 5, and the Satanic ritual abuse panic. That is why I do not categorically believe any allegation by anyone.
yes, he would be
assuming the allegations are true
I can use theory to create music that sounds consonant without so much trial and error, but I still can't identify intervals or chords.
I tried for an entire year in HS Music Theory and never made any progress.
<@!193408538909868033> Music theory as far as I've seen usually involves memorizing *intervals*, not pitches. Pitches most people can't identify.
Indeed
