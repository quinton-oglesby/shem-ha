Hello! My name is Ricky, I watched symphogear because it was suggested to me since I like yuri. I also really enjoy magical girl anime with action. Symphogear is my second favourite anime and I have no issues with rewatching it again and again. My favourite character is Miku but I love Hibiki a lot.

Miku FTW
I made several fics, most of them being about akuma no riddle, if anyone is interested: https://archiveofourown.org/users/RickyOtaku/works
I don't know where to talk about it, but I'm starting fic commissions to help me pay my rent, if anyone is interested. I can write anything.
The demo version of my Akuma no Riddle x Danganronpa fangame is now available to play! You can also watch my let's play of it:
