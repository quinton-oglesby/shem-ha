welcome
and it's less detailed compared to the other seasons
yes
season 1 artstyle is so weird to me idk why
and cure parfait (ciel kirahoshi) also has blonde hair and blue eyes in her civilian form
that outfit is cure parfait from kira kira precure a la mode which has the same va as carol
these character's actual name are inori yamabuki (left) and miki aono (right) from fresh precure
idk
yep i watched the anime before
and the cats name is kyubey
and their outfits are from the fate franchise
sayaka and kyoko from madoka magica

yep her birthday is coming closer
that's a lot of yuyuyu character's
oddly enough the voice for queen serenity is from the 90s anime but it's 90s va for esmeraude (the green haired girl from sailor moon r)
true
why is his arms so thin in that picture
