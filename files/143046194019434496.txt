'ello
maybe? You say you've got model building experience so I'd imagine you'd do alright with a MG. idk honestly. I started out with a really cheap and simple HG from Gundam SEED
Ah Lost Canvas. This deserves to be finished.
I mean if that's supposed to be Fate then the hair is Nanoha's yes?

Current home screen wallpaper.
Ah good 'ol Kuma WR. I hope they're still planning on continuing Henceforeward
Shirabe is being greedy
~~Y'all are right, I've seen the error of my ways~~
I could definitely accept HibiChris as a second to HibiMiku.

I love the casualness of the last picture
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<:RitaLove:585547638670229510>
I can agree with that
What's your first?
Yo that Starfall art is fantastic
<:SeeleMad:585589038434746400>
Don't keep doing this to me Ikxi.
That's one hell of a banger.
I'm sure you'll find it in due time.
interesting they're singing the zesshou in the background
Yeah the Ignite Module is most definitely burnt out after all the alchemical energy it had bypassed through it for the Last Ignition/Rebuild process.
struck down with a mighty fist eh?
I'm really liking the Alchemic influences on both the transformation scene and Gungnir itself
Oooo, I like that title
not fully useless
AK, whoever edited the wiki has the song you were talking about titled as "Rokka Ry≈çran".
I'd believe it AK
^^
Lol
Can't wait to see the next transformation.
Have to wonder what this ||Seal Invasion|| is gonna mean for the crew this season.
How I felt throughout the whole episode.

Can we just get Ep. 3 tomorrow pls, the suspense will kill me!
I bamboozled myself thinking we were gonna get Tsubasa's transformation scene during the concert.
Yeah the moment she started to dance on her Scythe, I was like "oh we doin' this eh?"
Loved that
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!
Bikki is thristy
by now I'm sure Aoi has perfected that scream
ah, I keep thinking Maria's is just another piece from Gungnir itself not Kanade's
Plausible. odd cuz it's through maria's gungnir and not any of Kanade's, but I'm literal so.....<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Solomon's Pimp Cane
I thought the Noise were like some semi-natural occurrence, like the scene with Tsubasa defending the regular military. they just kinda appear
Perfect
A determination to fist God eh?
bein' Basa is sufferin'
Ima choose A
Prepare a folder of Kitten pictures for stress relief
Civilians in Symphogear know how to gtfo surprisingly well sometimes
I certainly wasn't expecting giant super glaive for that finishing blow
run Nougat run
inspector dude is on the ground next episode for sure
gotta love vague screaming lol
Am I wrong in thinking that the only reason Shem-ha armor has SSJ elements is cuz Miku is the host or did I miss something else?
but that last right pic is Code Geass not Tengen
Woke Fudou is pleased.
not hate as far as I know but that the fact of it's power and how it was stuck by that same gear destroying light
Poor Lord Slug
I love it, though like quite a few of this season's songs I kinda wish that they could release the songs with the battle-stress included. Maximum over-hype
they probably could go the route of animating some of the stories from XDU
It's a warning
I think the thing on the moon is reacting to what she's doing.
mhm
yep

and to no one's surprise CR fucked up XV 9's description.
not sure if anyone else had brought it up yet but y'all notice they were playing Itsuka no Niji, Hana no Omoide during the intro?
Vanessa will just be a talking torso
*HibikiChris duet when*
^
in a duet sense
none
^
same
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
I crave for more Mecha.
I've seen that title popping up more recently. I think I saw a piece of news that said that Aoi Yuki was attached to the project.
oh. This popped up on one of my timeline like immediately after I woke up from a nap, didn't even think to check out the date the vid was published. <:MikuSad:497709379445850122> I'm dumb.
PV released for upcoming "So I'm a Spider, So What?" anime: https://youtu.be/Nqu4D8P_oLQ
Your Lie in April maybe?
Supernatural the Animation
oh I see I didn't see the context of the previous messages derp
I used Hidive through VRV to watch the original Higurashi. They have the dub for the first season but not Kai is not dubbed.
