thanks for helping again
ill set a timer
ok so 150 min
10 or 15
how long is cp restore again
<:sadblob:362620296890417163>
i have exactly one blue 3* jii
<#673253184885489696> might be a better place to ask that
so you're just dumping your gems
o
maybe I should just give up on raids until I have better units
i barely get any rewards
tfw
<3
if anyone wants to help haha
i have a red power raid up
bros
nice
at 5am
sanic?
i don't have the units for it
by help i mean i spawn it and you kill it
does anyone want to help me with hard power raid
i guess it's not worth getting blacklisted forever
im surprised nobody has trolled it yet
they get spanked
so if someone doesn't pause
we join after it's at 1 hp
oh wait I get it now
<:sweatneko:621153032750497813>
how does this work
does pausing refresh the hp
even if you wipe to it
does "hunt" count if you kill it after it's dead?
wait so
hi
ok
where's the other 3
rip
ye green carol
i still need like 7 giga miracles
let me check
true
is it because you don't want to get banned <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
free mats tho
real hacking hours
nice
got it
oh ok
before my units kill it
is there even enough time to pause
my experience on jp
giga magic crystals don't exist
bam
always that 10th
unpaus?
maybe a trole
ye
crap i missed it
i am ready
thanks for doing this
sixth person pls
don't want to flood the chat
<:kanna:446432088535597067>
<a:15min:490152383708659730>
played this game for too long today already
not in a rush
im probably gonna take a break rn anyway
yeah
I can't read
oh you're right
<:15min:406862587657977866>
i need 6 giga magic crystals
red carol
er
i need green carol
thanks sanic
cause they fucked me
barely at all
o-oh
tfw i still have like 95
muh lore
why does carol drop miracle stones anyway
just hack your raids xd
maybe there'll be another sanic
fairly sure it's an alt of someone here
i think he just farmed enough
and ofc I didn't get the loot i wanted
wasn't a hacker just a lot of people dogpiled
yea it dead
oh let me check
she sure has a lot of hp
thanks
i need 1 last drop
pls
can someone help me with my green carol raid
pls don't delete me
is your raid up
ill finish my hexa and hop in
maybe someone else can join
tho i can only do like 200k at a time
sure
and am now slapping carol
i recharged for my sins
im gonna get wiped on this shit
rip
I joined technique raid
wait shit
ok im going in
i do like 60
i think i have 5 again so ill go slap her
hopefully smeone else helps <:mibano:667890323950796820>
well i did some miniscule damage
technique 2 hard
i can only help you with carol
found it
if they tell me good let's go
but I'm not gonna ask everyone for their pronouns
I mean my intention is to make sure I don't willfully offend someone
the way I see it, any sort of dysphoria is a physical issue, it's not a mental issue, they can't just stop doing it ofc, but they should understand that since it's an abnormality it might not be immediately obvious to people and they should cut at least *some* slack, no?
^^^^
the "respect" part is when you respect their wishes once they actually tell them to you
this is the same thing to me
if you start discussing a sensitive topic, you just stop if someone asks you to stop instead of asking everyone "are you okay with this topic"
it's like
but I care about their feelings if I'm aware of them
you don't slap people preemptively
but slapping in the face is an inherently hostile action
I'll do my best to be mindful but it's not really something I am or want to get used to so if I make a mistake please don't yeet me I don't mean any bad will
but yeah uh I'm gonna close it with this
makes sense
oh
out of curiosity
at least roughly geographically
kaguya where are you from
are the pronoun roles going to be optional
because i cba to click on everyone
im just gonna refer to people by names because it's easier
I'll keep doing my best not to offend anyone
I mean yes but not enough to argue about it
like I'd refer to lily as lily
most of the time I just use the name anyway
> pronoun roles
for the reason I just mentioned
but I know from experience they also hurts people
shrug
"the outcasts"
it's like "they, there in the corner"
dehumanizing?
because "they" really makes me feel
like if someone is called ruby rose I'll probably use she
I usually use he/she depending on the nickname if I don't know any better
I mean it kind of depends
I also took it that way
I said this above
does that make sense
and that's the end of that
and even if you say "it's not" my experience is "it is"
that my experience is that "they" is dehumanizing
well I already told you
it's all fine
<:kanna:446432088535597067>
hime
noo
and what you want
but I'll respect you nonetheless
you won't change my views
because
isn't the whole point of this conversation that we respect eachother's views rather than trying to change them
uh
ok that
<:kanna:446432088535597067>
I'll call you whatever you want aria
<:worryhmm:626659392070090782>
and in the end, isn't this whole thing about respecting eachother even if you disagree
we just said "yeah but we see it differently but we'll respect it"
we weren't telling you your version was "wrong"
like
because this is a subjective topic where everyone feels differently and I don't want people trying to tell me their version is more correct because it's all a matter of experience and every person is different and prefers different things, in my opinion
na kaguya I don't think anyone is upset
based
um
and when in rome do as they do
since it's your server
it's more that I'll just respect your wishes
because I don't perceive things the same way you do due to upbringing, culture, surroundings etc.
so now you have to tell us
<a:EyesShaking:589116043092557840>
count as bread
burger buns
does stuff like
wait
rice
<:kanna:446432088535597067>
all is fine
so
if nobody got offended that means nobody did anything wrong despite what our world views may be
<:blobcatgooglysweats:593828362175250445>
nobody even got offended why did this even start
like now that I think about it
be frens
can we all just agree to
<:haha:337352256477462539>
I'm not kidding
and taking the easy way out
some people take it as actively disrespecting their gender choice
this is china we're talking about
that's just the official numbers though
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
don't restrict yourself to uni most people there are gonna drop out anyway
or you can go to facebook and whatnot and find local groups doing whatever you like doing
online is a decent substitute
unless you're actually feeling lonely I wouldn't mind it
now I'm at work and have good colleagues to talk to
and I don't feel it hurt my life in any way
i literally only talked to 1 guy at my uni
is there any particular reason you can't relate to people
am i drunk or is that picture tilted
goblin slayer bad
nothing wrong with wanting scientific explanations
good question
i found the convo above funny gomen
benis <:spurdo:230985625581518848>
ie biology
and use only facts and evidence
i think there should be a distinction made between treatment of people and researching a phenonena, when you want to help someone you should work on multiple fronts and try different things but when you just want to research how it works e.g. for future treatments you need to treat it on a scientific level
you work one step at a time and eliminate all offeri factors
well it's how scientific process works
external factors won't help you determine the cause and process
but there's nothing wrong with just analyzing it in a vacuum and figuring out how it works
that's true
from a treatment perspective you shouldn't reduce it to just that
influenced sure but at its core it is just funny chemicals in your brain
what else would depression be
S;G elite or live action S;G
I can't tell what's worse
