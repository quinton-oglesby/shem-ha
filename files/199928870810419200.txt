<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
it's just not intuitive
I'm not saying it should be a channel for all kinds of DIY stuff like figures and cooking and whatever, nor that it should only be for figures, but that it's weird that self made food creations should go to <#407060923078017026>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
also, while not completely, the pin and channel desc lightly contradict eachother
desc specifically calls out the channel for figures and non symphogear works, but the pin only mentions non symphogear DIY stuff
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
honestly, not sure why "check this food I made" would go in <#407060923078017026> over <#458060276550336522>
at this point it doesn't get much more obvious

if you're gonna provide the sauce yourself
so the bot doesn't try to source it
use the skip command for the image
as in

just skip the image you post then
> AFAIK
no, what I mean is the bot only checks for files *literally*
if the file is provided in a link directly (as in the link URL directly provides the file itself) the bot will see it as an image file
If you just link to a pixiv page that contains the file but is not a direct link to the file itself, the bot won't see it as a link

You could post pics of your dog there
<#407060923078017026> isn't just a place for memes, it's also an overflow for <#336297387863703552> /high density posting chat
Yeah but not every channel that's topic specific is made to flooded either. Consider <#337805317276565525> where multiple discussions about different topics related to gaming have occurred at the same time, clogging up the chat and making it difficult to follow, or especially <#371105434771390465> where it happens even more often
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
The benefit of threads is keeping high density posting about one thing in the appropriate channel without flooding the channel itself
<:RinaThis:751224887640588379>
or to just you know, actually read what they've been sent
so you can cut out the chatter and find what you're looking for
plus, protip, if you search for images only in the image chat of your choice, it will show you uploaded images, as well as embed links that lead to images
I don't ask people to ping me for stuff because I already know that I'm gonna search through it all anyways and often
<a:YumiHyperPoint:781970749371449404>
or if it's multiple people, a group dm, and then the same
<a:YumiHyperPoint:781970749371449404>
that's a spicy take rad. and even if it's true they can't monitor the chat all the time, they are still obligated to attempt to do so
and I'm not home to test on my own pc
I unfortunately can only speak from memory, and I only used jellyfin for a short bit trying to find a different solution to an entirely different problem before I solved it using something else
<:RinaLul:668607061889646592>
emby is a little more assertive and will just launch the server and open the webpage in one go
install server application on host PC, run the system tray application, and launch from the system tray
I literally have no idea what could be causing it to crash. I have never run into an issue with the server failing to start after install
<:EmmaShrug:823282594861809664>
once the server is running you can access it from the systray
to clarify, I only use emby, and I only use it on a personal level, so I only ever access it as a server owner, but the operation is just about the same
but that's just pedantry, in effect the application is just a front end for the server connection
the server can be directly connected to via the web, apps are client specific
well
which can use the web access or connect via apps
there are clients
for the server application
<:RinaThis:665317233924374549>
it's installed, and then accessed via web interface
it's an open source fork of emby if you know that. a plex alternative
fr
<:Athonkies:692983058512740433>
for the host atleast
but you'd need to have the video file being played on hand
Iirc jellyfin supports simultaneous play for multiple devices and the entire program is free
<:Athonkies:692983058512740433>
<:SmolTeriDerp:928714298308591656>
but thinking is for people that think, not me

most of the gears have bare shoulders
yeah it was something I noticed
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
discounting maria's gear, for obvious reasons, none of the gears have shoulder armor/armaments aside from kiri, and even then, it mostly hovers over her shoulder instead of being attached directly
I don't think the shoulders should have anything

It does kinda look like a HI3 weapon now that you mention it
Alternatively, remove the ‚Äúhealth:‚Äù and ‚Äúmana:‚Äù at the start and leave the HP MP
Having health at the start of the bar and then noting the health value with HP is a little too redundant

I found the relevant meme

science team, the true heros
If it‚Äôs about being gay, then they should be so high off the chart that they aren‚Äôt visible anymore
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
it's that eye color + personality + mom vibe

It‚Äôs chonky AF no doubt, but that edge is definitely sharp
Evidence 1. The blade is behind the edge of the guard/hilt. Either the blade is lopsided on one face of the guard or it tapers to the center.
Evidence 2. The blade has a slight gradient to it, implying a beveled curve

I realized the article explains what they are but not why they have a gap.
It‚Äôs because they‚Äôre made (typically) of two individual pieces of leather, attached by the belt. There‚Äôs no ass piece because they‚Äôre meant to be worn over pants, not instead of pants, and are used often when riding horses, where being limited in leg movement wouldn‚Äôt be beneficial. (Imagine for a moment wearing jeans, and then imagine trying to do a split in those jeans. Now imagine doing that except the jeans aren‚Äôt sewn together at the crotch, and will instead split apart with the legs)

The last 3 of S1

No I mean the first season
Depending on your source
And might not be found with it
Were released as OVAs
The last 3 episodes of the first season
Important
Also
Aka what you see up there

Presuming they release one later, you could pair them with the OG trio, one as a conductive material, the other as an energy
Fire with steel, electric with ice(crystal), dragon with rock
Personally a fire regi would‚Äôve made more sense to pair with the electric regi, unless they reveal one later
But as a move type it‚Äôs portrayed as a kind of ferocious untamed energy
I mean that dragon as a pokemon type is typically portrayed straight as a literal dragonlike creature
But anyways
~~accidental horni~~
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Flexible imo
Dragon is kinda
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
On one hand, I don‚Äôt particularly mind new regis, but on the other, I was under the impression that the regis were supposed to represent minerals, aka stone, metals, and crystals, so an electric and dragon regi don‚Äôt make sense to me, unless they‚Äôre going for an energy regi vibe ig

Somewhere around sylvie to sachi is where my sense of creepy cute is
Ye
Where as ageha has her, well, everything going on, and sylvie has the horrific scarring
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Her eye is supposed to be her creepy charm point, but it mostly just ends up being crazy cute
Yeah, that‚Äôs what I mean
~~I mean we all know sylvie is their most popular character, but you know what I mean~~
It‚Äôs probably cuz it‚Äôs so simple, and it‚Äôs probably not that artist‚Äôs most popular work, considering it‚Äôs not very strong on the creepy part of creepy cute
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

In my not-idol series
Character development
Because that‚Äôs where all the character development happens
Also, if you‚Äôre feeling froggy, almost the entirety of in game (cuz ofc there‚Äôs a gacha game, it‚Äôs bushiroad) events and stories are logged on Bestdori (bandori info/tool/support site)
And the spin off is comedic as fuck, but I‚Äôd watch S2 first for character context
S1 is pretty good standalone
S2 and 3 are more generally about and include the other bands
S1 is basically 100% about Poppin Party
S1 is listed separately cuz S2 and 3 are done in a different style, and unlike the first, isn‚Äôt nearly as heavily focused on one band
There‚Äôs S1, there‚Äôre S2 and S3, there‚Äôs a spin off and it‚Äôs sequel, both of which are comedy shorts, there‚Äôs a 2 part Roselia (band) movie (i believe the first part is airing soon?) and iirc another movie
*insert doofinshmertz meme here*
Mfw there‚Äôs a european weeb in two different, primarily bushiroad headed idol(or idol-like) series
It‚Äôs pretty good
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>

Oh, and eli honks and umi are the real childhood trio
And nico mind games maki into joining the idol club
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

***Who‚Äôs actually better at kendo than umi***
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
*along with honoka*
But in the manga she‚Äôs actually part of the kendo club
And implied that she participates in her family dojo at home
In the anime it‚Äôs known that she‚Äôs in the archery club
Cuz
There‚Äôs this weird psuedo fanon but actually canon mixing of the source materials going on with umi
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

We've had the discussion before on how the DFS works, and according to what I remember the general consensus was, a miku that lived through hibiki failing to save her and dying in the process would probably do literally nothing
Probably
<:KasuClose:750946278703366274>
There's always spiteful villain miku
Also iirc one of the characters is voiced by the same VA as ruby (LL)
Probably jusy look similar

I‚Äôm only good at horny posting, dw about it
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> I also love your posts. Everyone here is like another family to me, you included
And it wasn‚Äôt a self contained incident. He‚Äôd been pissing and moaning for weeks before, and was just generally a shit since long before
Like, when I say ejected at terminal velocity, I mean it
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Basically they threw a fit over some bad game rng, antagonized everyone in a 5 voice chat radius, had a lengthy shouting match via text in the discord server, and then proceeded to remove himself from all common discords, and unfriended everyone on facebook and steam
I found this out when someone ejected themselves from my high school friend group at terminal velocity
In a bit of levity but keeping the convo here, did you know you can block someone on steam while they‚Äôre on your friends list? And that they *stay on your friends list*
I don‚Äôt know if this will help at all, but I know I used to be (and still kind of am) scared of the dark. Something that helps me deal with that when I go through my house at night for example, is to already be adjusted to the dim light in a room I‚Äôm comfortable with, like my bedroom. Even when it‚Äôs dark, tiny amounts of light means that if your eyes are adjusted, you can still see. Even if I can‚Äôt see well, just knowing that helps me.
Also, knowing that I‚Äôm in a place I‚Äôm used to really helps, because I know what the creaking of the pipes, the whirring of the AC, ~~the asshole cats doing something stupid~~, my own footsteps, sound like, and I know where all the furniture and doors are.
For me, awareness is power over that fear. Your friend might be completely different. But if you and they can‚Äôt find something to work with, maybe try that as a starting point
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

There‚Äôs angry at games, and then there‚Äôs ‚Äúsomeone got loot from a chest that two people wanted, they rolled fair and square for it and other guy won, so ejectbutton gets pissy.

<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

This is a scenario that I cannot see a positive outcome in. Either the (already not-good) education in america tanks, or we spread the bad stuff
Take a scenario nobody likes, and apply it across the board, and the students that were already having trouble get flushed away
That too
As it is right now, I saw how those kids were doing in virtual. And how they performed when they started coming back to school physically.
If you plotted a graph of their grades over time, it would look like they drove off a cliff. Because ofc, what does taking tests and doing class work at home encourage? Cheating. And the parents totally aren‚Äôt in on it too /s
Admin is overworked, teachers are overworked, parents are throwing fits, and students are learning even less
Having had a relatively close eye on education, since my mom is a teacher, and I recently got a job as a substitute teacher, going virtual has been a nightmare for everyone involved at every single level
Which means that the next step in the evolution of texas is to reinstate pvp modes with Honor Duels
I can‚Äôt remember, aren‚Äôt honor duels illegal

I see a ver convo, I dip
And typing out laughter like that is annoying
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>

Ass
Heh
However I will continue to use the emote. If you don‚Äôt like it, that‚Äôs fine. I won‚Äôt use it around you.
I‚Äôve seen people banned for less and faster on many servers, so excuse me if I‚Äôve been acting defensively

Removing the emote because people troll about ver isn‚Äôt going to stop people from trolling about ver

~~one of the scenes stands out to me cuz I‚Äôm a degenerate but the same applies to the rest of the work~~
||In the beginning when araragi sees hanekawa‚Äôs skirt flip, that scene is in the LN, and in the same way that that LN scene is abnormally detailed (it‚Äôs 2 and a half pages long in the english release) the anime scene is abnormally long, with araragi‚Äôs focus and completely apparent lack of mental control easily demonstrated. While there‚Äôs no text or verbal monologuing in that anime scene, in the LN, araragi is mentally babbling to himself in a silly way, and you can feel that from how he acts||

It seems to me that many translators are also non native english speakers practicing their english, and a common way to have learned english before you start actively trying to learn it is by speaking or hearing it.
This in turn influences how you write.
IE, in english, if you were to say that above phrase out loud, you‚Äôd most likely contract it into ‚Äúshould‚Äôve‚Äù. To someone without knowledge of written english, that would sound like someone saying ‚ÄúShould of‚Äù

Ye
Like, as an example, you‚Äôd likely not see a VRmmo that takes place in a prehistoric setting, where players are limited to stone age tools and such, but an isekai could easily take place in that kind of setting
There might be underlying differences that result from that though
Thematic
Being more serious, it‚Äôs just a difference in mechanics
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Ffffffff i have to wait for Niji Ep2
<:KirikaFish:717138469381734471>
Besides the movie has hop stop non-stop so it must be good /s

Ik it is but no bulli
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
So then I referred to a LN called
> If It‚Äôs For My Daughter, I‚Äôd Even Defeat The Demonlord
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
And I misread it as the guy marrying his own daughter
Iski was talking about an anime where tv spooky girl spooks some guy‚Äôs daughter, and ends up marrying the guy (i think)
<:KirikaFish:717138469381734471>
Wait have you read it tho
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
~~maybe~~
~~If it‚Äôs for my daughter I‚Äôd even defeat the demonlord is super wholesome shhhhh~~
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I misread what iski said
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

I actually don‚Äôt know what you mean
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I‚Äôve never heard of that outside this one doujin I read so idk what you mean
Iirc the anime covers that portion
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
If you can‚Äôt be bothered to handle the whole psuedo incest part, the first half is 100% just really wholesome father daughter style stuff
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
~~There‚Äôs some dumb nuanced shit in the story as to why it just feels wholesome to me instead of possibly creepy, but that requires reading, and not feeling squicked out by incest at all~~
But basically it felt wholesome and cute and it was really romantic as fuck near the end
Also, she‚Äôs adopted
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
The daughter was the one hitting on him
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

sunshine, sunshine S2, and you don't have to watch it, it's pretty bad (and not really necessary), but the sunshine movie
yeah
idk what subs you watched it with (aka idk if it put emphasis on it), but the song contains each of their names, and makes a direct call back to bokura no live kimi to no life, their first ever single
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>

part of how I can identify love live characters without anything but a silhouette is the uniform design
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
yes
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
all love live schools have a color/pattern signifying the student's year
otonakizaka (muse) uses striped Light blue/blue for 1st years, blue/red for 2nd years, and green/blue for 3rd years
uranohoshi (aqours) uses yellow, red, and green for each year
and niji uses a main color with a small tab yellow/blue, pink/yellow, and blue/pink for each year
the color itself isn't what made me notice though, it's that it wasn't where I was expecting it
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>

even moon cancer eventually got jinako
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

if I'm being honest, the only playable class I don't think she'll ever get is shielder
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
there's about a 0.001% chance of artoria getting a moon cancer, and a -5% of her getting shielder
there's no alter ego artoria either
so now I'l occasionally watch shows slowly with her, like 2 eps a day
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and she kind of enjoyed it
so I got her to watch it
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
~~probably cuz for a while there I had no desktop, so I was using my laptop on the couch in the living room, and she wondered why I was sitting there crying up a storm~~
I may have been watching love live at the time
but she was interested in anime
like, my mom literally could not give even a billionth of a fuck about video games

Losing the tsun is part of being a tsundere

I really do hope there is a second season ||because 1. I love Shioriko and I want, 2. I wanna see more setsu development, 3. I need more gay idols, and 4. I need more love live||
||and a small note, since the anime showed a different kind of Rina. In the anime she was quiet and not nearly as engaged, and even after the rina-chan board, she was still pretty sedate. In the game tho, she was introduced having already worked on and created the rina-chan board with ai before meeting the other characters, and is far more active and engages in conversation at the drop of a hat. It‚Äôs interesting to get to see a character from essentially 2 different points in time||
||also, if by book you mean one yuu was carrying around, that‚Äôs the notebook she uses to record info on the other girls‚Äô progress as idols||
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
||fans had been lightly joking about yandere ayumu for a long while due to a few small scenes here or there, like one in the game main story where she‚Äôs arguing with kasumi over who‚Äôs yuu‚Äôs favorite for a few lines, but the yandere artists really exploded over her arc in the anime||

It‚Äôs almost like instead of consumers having to deal with shitty episodes, or producers having to rush content, we could have the happy medium of consumers waiting for excellent content, and producers having time to work without literally developing physical trauma

If they look over it once and then write out the subs from start to finish, that‚Äôs called being a fuckin idiot
But we‚Äôre talking about someone translating a work they have access to
That‚Äôs also true
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
Exactly
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
If you actually put in effort
The subtleties might be fucked, such as verb tenses, but you can still fill in the gaps
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Context clues help, and the exaggerated speech and body language of anime characters makes following along fairly easy even without subs
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Most weebs have a ‚ÄúI get the gist of it‚Äù understanding of spoken japanese.
Add that to a machine translation, and you can turn that into proper english
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Even if it was machine translation, a look over the source audio and a bit of free time is enough to turn machine translated into adequate reading
I fucking hate that
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
Oftentimes I‚Äôll see something poorly translated throughout and think to myself ‚Äúmy mom‚Äôs middle school students have a better understanding of english‚Äù
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
The part of translating where shit always seems to go south is in the ‚Äúto english‚Äù part

~~from what I‚Äôve seen of her in sifas, she gets more development as a bit of a jock, which is both expected and yet funny~~

Mio Honda, Cinderella Girls, it checks out
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
the setting itself has a similar kind of vibe to Sleepy Princess but the tone is more about comforting the princess and the comedy derived from that than the princess unintentionally (or intentionally) bullying the demons in the castle
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
she is
<:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>

And I‚Äôm pretty sure the title of the piece played when she becomes StuCoPres is literally Love Live the Musical or something
It really does feel like a musical
It hit so fucking different
The song that plays when the curtains rise at their first concert
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
The super dramatic over the top piece that plays when honoka learns the school is shutting down, contrasting with the comedically lighthearted sections
Cuz each bgm just fit the scene so well, but also totally enhanced and amplified the scene it was in
I think the OST is the reason that when I first watched LL, I got ‚Äúthis is a musical‚Äù vibes, even though it‚Äôs not a musical (mostly)
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
Notes of School Idol Days
Iirc the anime does actually have a released OST album
Extremely memorable for me
Especially the first series and SIFAS
I‚Äôve always thought the BGM to the LL anime and the games was pretty good
The OST is pretty good
And not just cuz I‚Äôm a love live freak
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I‚Äôd very willingly buy the OST to Love Live SIFAS
This makes me happy. I wish this would happen with more games
to numbers geeks like me, the numbers speak, but for most people, I can understand why they get in the way
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
i mean the number is, but the antics she gets up to with her broken ass stats in the broken ass game is why it's such fun
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
> I think the problem is that a lot of them is that they reallllllly like to use rpg stats without being fun with them and instead just be powerwank
I like bofuri because it makes fun use of rpg stats while also being a powerwank

when I see the skills listed in spoder anime, the first thing I think of is saiyans in DB showing up with an even yellower hairstyle
spoder definitely uses the skills like a running gag
but "another setting which in universe is literally inside a videogame" not using video game terms and characteristics is fucking weird
I mean to say that "Another world which is a fantasy setting" defined soley through video game characteristics is lazy
perhaps my wording is weird
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
a video game world itself without video game characteristics is like a fish without scales
on the other
on the one hand, game terms in a game-like fantasy world is kinda lazy

<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
SAO had stats?
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
like early on she quickly gets a multiplier to her defense, and she does the math on screen with her fingers
bofuri makes use of the numbers solely to exagerate just how comedically high maple's defensive stats are
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
this conversation is reminding me of the time my friend argued very intensely that Redline wasn't an anime movie (as in, the anime part) because it was actually good, and anime by definition has to be bad

The hard part is searching behind the shelves where books fall and get forgotten
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
So any that I do find are cheap
But they sell books for like a buck
They don‚Äôt usually have a lot of manga

Love live was all that remained

What was it
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
There was a topic?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
But in those roles he's "the face of iron man" playing a role
Like I know he has other roles
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
He's iron man
Kinda like how robert downey jr isn't RDJ to me
That's just how it be, no matter the role i see them in
Emi nitta will always be honoka to me, and tokui sora will always be nico to me
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Like I can recognize voices by comparing them to characters, but outside a few very random names
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I don't follow the actual VA's much so idk about that side of things

Like google translate
Especially not to a person that doesn't know shit
All of which are kizuna ai
There are 4(?) Ships
There was a kizuna ai collab
Yes
<:TamaNyan:608065126649692193>
Just scroll until you see the same floof
The AL wiki has a list of ships with their image cards
I found this within a few seconds
https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Urakaze
I feel like you're over thinking this
So you could probably use a reverse image search to find the twitter post
If all else fails, I believe AL always releases cards like the one posted here on twitter when ships release
Her info would probably already be added to the en wiki
By a crazy amount
Yeah but en wikis and groups that play a year behind also like to plan ahead
By a lot
Which cuts down on the number of ships to look through
Based on that name she's definitely in the japanese faction in game
<:Ver:704169051391524875>

You'll definitely find a large number of fox girls in the process

So a girl who uses Ore might speak in a masculine way, but is not necessarily a male

The I pronouns in japanese themselves are gendered but do not directly indicate the gender of the speaker
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
And even characters his age (and some younger) act like he's younger than them
Almost all the characters talk down to him

They really went all in on him being useless outside of being a battery though

Aka, where he's hanging out with everyone
I need to get around to watching it, but I was under the impression it follows the *story* implied by the bond stories, separate from the main story
<:KasuSweat:800408974322696203>
He only loses his memories at the start of the game and then ||loses what little new memories he made with his harem/friends *again* for plot reasons, and becomes near toddler like from the trauma of unlocking his powers||
<a:yabai:815377919496290345>
Priconne story is one of the few stories where I actually somehow feel bad for harem master MC
<:KasuSweat:800408974322696203>
Not quite the same level of "cathartic cute anime for a depressing story mobage" as some other popular games right now, but that's exactly what it is.

I'm always on the opinion that getting used to the next generation character appearance/design is hard to get used to
<:YuLaugh:690886246557548594>
<:6AMPeek:851224627949600768>
Not 9
Cuz only 5
But with better character focus
So a lot of speculation is that the story will have the same direction as OG did
I've heard the director for the OG love live is coming back to work on it
<:YuLaugh:690886246557548594>
Cuz she is probably the nicest person in that show

There is literally no way I could possibky see an interspecies reviewers (where the focus is literally on characters rating their experiences at brothels) to not include ecchi
You could argue the entire point of the series is fanservice, but it's literally a comedy about sexual entertainment and calling that fanservice is kinda meta

Sometimes
<:6AMPeek:851224627949600768>
Also, even if the TTGL is the same sized as the CGGL, the STTGL is several thousand times larger, which would put it at way larger than any rocky planet in our solar system
But visually, fuck reality, galaxy shurikens

Ik
"Technology of a sufficient level is indistinguishable from magic"
- someone i think
<:rinkuXD:800990461765353532>
At one point in the fight they fire missiles at the antispiral and one of the characters in the cockpit starts talking about how they can literally change the probability of striking a target, and at that point the TTGL is just straight up manipulating reality on a quantum level
<a:HyperKasumiYays:585574711036084229>

I mean
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
Iirc the STTGL is pretty much galaxy super cluster sized

And go even bigger
When the movie had to one up itself
<:rinkuXD:800990461765353532>

rn, niji anime time
I can explain in a little more depth how that works later in <#567740255273222175>
you need to start them, hit max 3 notes, then swap to another strat
so for the AC's that require you to hit notes with a certain number of members
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
wait how are you failing them, all but two just require you to swap subunits mid song
<:wheeze:672654184218361856>
80K stamina damage on the last AC whether you clear it or not
and shio's first song
when the song itself just does like 4 times damage on all notes
who needs stamina damage notes

first and foremost they're horsegirls. they're just incidentally idols because they're famous
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
no, that's business cowardice, hiding behind parent company subsidiary names
so that cygames can stop pretending they aren't cripplingly obsessed with idols
bushimo + cygames wen
i mean it's craft egg, all their characters look samey
<:Doge:810312367824175104>

<:rinkuXD:800990461765353532>
marauders are also at one territory on our server
now it has like 1/8 of all covenant players in the entire game on it I swear
My friends all joined the Aeaea server because coincidentally, it had the lowest player count when we first joined
<:ShizuSweat:610988988064595984>
almoat immediately got distracted by dread though
it's pretty fun
the fact that she happens to break the game repeatedly only speaks to how cannily realistic the anime is. literally just the other day I encountered a gamebreaking bug playing New World where the spawnspeed for mobs would drastically rise without limit based on the number of nearby players, leading to scenarios where people could reach max weapon mastery (and nearly 200 tracking and skinning) within hours farming boars and bears that would spawn nonstop
<:HonkEvil:749327484197142569>
and it's a cute girl doing it so it's even better
to see someone else doing what we wish we could go back in time and do
<:ayumulovely:861469004463603763>
Bofuri isn't so much about the stats and the look how overpowered the MC is
I mean, it is, but it's mostly satirical. the real focus is on how it feels to play an MMO or VR (or VRMMO as it were) for the first time
no matter the silly and frankly outlandish scenario maple ends up in, she's *having fun* exploring something that many of us who have played mmo's can relate to. that feeling of accidental discovery, of playing with your friends, of spending frankly unhealthy amounts of time playing a game, that's the experience bofuri delivers on

I love watching anime with the bois, but unfortunately, any seriousness in any scene immediately evaporates
for every Boi in chat or within 10 feet, the average intelligence decreases by half

I have no idea what's being referenced but okay

the kasu neso I have at home is the same length iirx

probably one of my favorite romantic moments ever if I'm being honest
<:Kasuwumi:702338842987855962>
citrus manga still has my favorite romantic moment in any manga series I've read
iirc this is a common phenomena where two different movies or shows will be released near each other and they both have similar concepts, themes, and executions
"cool" and "batshit insane" are not mutually exclusive

For ref., 3 star character titles require you to clear 5000 songs using a character as the center
The hard part is getting her 3 star title, cuz I don‚Äôt always have free time to clear songs on auto/manual

3 months?
they also have character self intro vids
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
something about it reminds me of mijuku dreamer
the group is Liella!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u68osLiMA_A
https://youtu.be/2aCe7FRp7HE
I love the solo but if we‚Äôre being honest, I think my favorite of the recent solos so far is probably hanamaru‚Äôs
~~it‚Äôs just so bouncy~~
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
But I could be totally wrong
I think it‚Äôs that she‚Äôs gotten better at controlling her pitch
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Same
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

But it‚Äôs probably better that way
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I‚Äôm still kinda mad Soluna didn‚Äôt win instead of Diver Diva
Not sure on the members
Iirc the group names were
Where the daily song list has muse and Aqours solos, it has Niji subunits
You can really feel that first one in game tho
Nonstandard idol group (heavily individual focused versus group focused), with irregular member count (both Œº‚Äôs and Aqours only had 9 members total, Niji has Yuu, in addition to the nine idols, not to mention more joined later) and irregular subunit sizes
Bushiroad really went wild (relatively speaking) with Niji
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
A‚Ä¢ZU‚Ä¢NA is Ayumu, Shizuku, and Setsuna,
Diver Diva is Ai and Karin
QU4RTZ is Kasu, Rina, Emma, and Kanata
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Although, I guess since they aren‚Äôt formally a group, it‚Äôs more like just plain Units
Just like Œº‚Äôs and Aqours have subunits, so does Niji

There are references all over the place in both series to the other
Yup
