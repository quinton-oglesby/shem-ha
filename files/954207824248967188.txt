~~It would certainly motivate me to read more.~~
It‚Äôs absolutely absurd that Kerrik had to build a feature for one single case.
I‚Äôm of the opinion that ZGundam should be banned/kicked since they have been repeatedly told not to post rp accounts in the art sections, and continue to do it anyway.
I personally don‚Äôt see how that channel would get that much use, and if pc hardware is brought up in this server it‚Äôs generally in the context of games so it would go fine in the gaming channel. If you‚Äôre just wanting a channel to drop Linus tech videos in or whatever then any of the shitposting channels would work fine for that.
Oh that too
Maybe as a sticker if you crop it right and don‚Äôt do subtitles
I can make shemmy talk in whatever channel I want, I just need to alter the code. Nothing with discord permissions. Just need for Staff to sign off on it.
There used to be an alchemist role but I‚Äôm fairly sure it‚Äôs defunct now
Illuminati are mods
Probably. Would need admin permission.
I blocked you because I was checking something.
If someone wants to live blog spoilers then they should be spoiler tagging at the most every four or so messages. It‚Äôs unreasonable to expect someone to crawl back 25 messsges to figure out what series is being talked about.
If that was the goal, then it works as intended.
I do not think that there should have been a split in the first place. Discord is an incredibly poor choice for live blogging whatever game you are playing or whatever anime you are watching. It allows for one person to dominate the channel to easily and restricts other people from using the channel for that purpose. 

However, that does not appear to have been a problem yet.
I disagree.
Yeah that too.
Never mind it doesn‚Äôt, but it wouldn‚Äôt be hard to write something to do that
IIRC discord has rich embeds that supports polls
That would require this server being a community server
I think he‚Äôs asking for non nitro users
Not to say it‚Äôs a bad idea or anything.
I believe this idea was brought up before, and there was considerable worry that it wouldn‚Äôt get enough traction.
Already did that.
Yeah I had a question about merch.
Unfortunately I haven‚Äôt had much time for cooking.
Sorry. Just needed a break.
üëã
Thanks. I wasn't doing well mentally and I needed a moment to breathe.

I plan on taking a soldering iron to it when I‚Äôm done.
I have that exact same kit.

Vegetable beef soup
Spray paint, airbrush, brush, etc
I‚Äôm wondering what method they used
How did you paint it?
I don‚Äôt like ranch steaks
Could have used a better cut of meat
Beef broccoli and rice
It looks really good. Well done.
I assume you nipped them out of the runners and then painted them?
That looks really good for spray paint.
It was three hours of prep work for a fifteen second test.









Here‚Äôs something a bit different for you all‚Ä¶ I had my first bend test today at welding school. I took a picture of each part of the process.
The problem with cooking at scale is that not everything scales equally
I‚Äôll probably be making a lasagna casserole later this evening.
The barbecue sauce is also a present for someone.
Don‚Äôt wanna be alone with my thoughts.
Boredom.
And thickening up
And it‚Äôs currently on the stove simmering

And then I scaled that barbecue sauce recipe up
Then I finetuned a barbecue sauce recipe.
This morning I made a breakfast casserole.
I‚Äôve been cooking all day today.
It‚Äôs so good
It‚Äôs so tender
This stew meat though
I forgot the potatoes ;-;
Come to TN

Pink hair is poggers
Need to cook for like 30 or so min before I can put the barbecue sauce on them
Just basted
They haven‚Äôt been cooked yet lol
Baked drumsticks is gonna be the main dish for dinner tonight
It‚Äôs just messy as hell
Ok yeah the lasagna casserole came out super good
The breakfast casserole took two hours <:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
Takes maybe 45 minutes total
Yeah it‚Äôs not hard to make
Too much milk
The breakfast casserole was pretty bland
I have t tried it yet
Probably the lasagna casserole
Uhhh
But in small batches no
Making it at scale like I did was
No it‚Äôs not
Barbecue sauce?
Is what hard
Yeah I wanted to show off the obscene amount of cooking I did today
It‚Äôs so sweet and tangy
I‚Äôm really happy with how this stuff turned out.
1.5 gallons of barbecue sauce

<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Probably could have used a more exciting cheese than shredded mozzarella for the Mac and cheese though
Yeah it was really yummy
Mac and cheese, potato salad, drumsticks, and grandma brought deviled eggs
I made a ton of food



Time for the bbq sauce
You want the skin to be crispy
And then another 30 or so after that
so i feel that
six kits that arent built yet lmao
ive got like
Oh that‚Äôs pretty
And I guess by extension the enacts too
God the flags were so good
All of it‚Äôs fair game
Bookshelves, food, 3d prints
Yes.
It‚Äôs also way too salty
It‚Äôs way too much
Here‚Äôs probably the shittiest poutine you‚Äôll ever see
Oh Whoah this is sick
God this is so cool
Uses XDU cards
Yeah
Oh neat
Gacha
https://discord.gg/UE3BJ8SrrN
Oh oops that wasn‚Äôt a permanent link
https://discord.gg/cQcsHmQ
Symphogear gacha thing
Fair enough
Is this a home studio?
Cable managing is an art form
Lmao
Smug
It would help if I used actual mozzarella and not string cheese
Homemade mozzarella sticks is harder than I thought it would be
Fair enough.
Is this a functioning game or just concepts?
Or is it already in place
Why not go with something mesh for your left eye
Nice!
Yeah. I agree with that Matt. However, Unity has the most support from the community.
Unity.
It looks goodn
Panel lining and stickers really make the kit pop
Panel lining is hard work
RG Perfect Strike Gundam
From the nipping
So I can clean up all the sanding I do
One of these days I‚Äôm actually gonna get an airbrush

Very good!!!!
Good stuff. Well done.
I can't get over how well the white looks with the purple on that controller
Small spray paint job

Cute!
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
That explains it
that looks aggressively IBO
I still have the regular strike with the skygrasper.
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Assembly is last
I nip, sand, panel line, and then add stickers
Entire foot
Hit it with a 1000 grit first and then a 3000 grit
So I do a lot of sanding
And I‚Äôm pretty anal about nubs
I have bad nippers
Hard to say
Is it worth the hour that it took for me to do that one foot though?
I‚Äôve found
Oh that‚Äôs some good weathering, well done
Barbecue pork fried rice

Yep!
Windams!!‚Äô
This tasted even better left over

Does anyone know if it's possible to get a replacement sticker sheet for an RG Perfect Strike Gundam?
Man I love your art style. It's so full of personality.
It‚Äôs fine I‚Äôll just do panel lining
I appear to have lost my perfect strike gundam sticker sheet
Too much oregano
I didn't care for it
Chicken vegetable
Souuuuup

I wish I had some cement
Fucking superglue
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Some panel lining.

Small head
Strike ‚ù§Ô∏è
I hate those
Oh those
What‚Äôs a polycap
Man I‚Äôd love to see a Mazin Emperor G ver Infinitism

its pretty good though

I thought the cat was okay
Nabe is super good at what they do, yeah
Guys I‚Äôm starting to think that anime is misogynistic
I watched someone else play it for 30 min and saw the cat turn into a car and thought that was cute

Really the sure think to do is to not drink on an empty stomach and to drink lots of water when you do drink alcohol
Possibly
Uhhhh
I do not recommend
But I remember it tasting like the smell of rubbing alcohol and within five minutes or so of drinking it my head starting to spin
Can't remember specifically
I may have been 18
The very first drink I ever had was a shot of 95% everclear when I was 17
Fuck you up
One shot will
It would taste like what rubbing alcohol smells like

man
America is beyond parody.

I haven‚Äôt heard that either.
Yeah.
Oh!
Hasn‚Äôt that been known?
I thought I was getting better but I guess not.
I went about eight months without struggling with suicidal thoughts or ideation but the past couple of weeks they‚Äôve been back in full force.
Right outside my moms classroom.
A student at my moms school brought a tire iron and nearly beat another student to death with it today.
Absolutely insane how teachers witness insane acts of violence and aren‚Äôt offered any counseling in response to that.

Yeah they are.
Who?
I mean this respectfully, but I literally have no idea who you are. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever spoken to you. It‚Äôs incredibly odd that you would offer a total stranger your ear like that. What‚Äôs your angle?
Man that‚Äôs fucked up.

Why are they using *balloons*
Like
This whole spy balloon thing is really weird
And that forum.
Ah man. That video.
Very glad I shut down those stupid bots when I did
Yes.
oh has it
So that will make the secretary of state‚Äôs upcoming visit to Beijing a lot harder
Although sending a spy balloon into foreign territory is pretty provoking
Or pretty soon
I highly doubt it‚Äôs a sure thing
They should have used a really big needle
I wish I knew!
Oh boy
https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1622082025166442505?s=46&t=75NEp1YdLbbcqxlTOH_9oQ
Man that‚Äôs just super shitty.
Average pay is $19.5k and they‚Äôre striking for $32k.
Oh holy shit they‚Äôre revoking healthcare benefits too
https://www.inquirer.com/news/tugsa-temple-graduate-students-strike-20230208.html?outputType=amp
This covers it in more detail
Graduate assistants normally have their tuition paid for by the school because they‚Äôre working for the school
May not be
If it‚Äôs pronounced that way that makes more sense
I‚Äôve been pronouncing it Si-rona
Is it pronounced that way
What am I missing
I‚Äôve been seeing people upset about the name but I genuinely don‚Äôt get why
Can someone explain to me what‚Äôs so offensive about the name Sirona Ryan
You can‚Äôt be naive enough to think that this will pass
I get that this is just a publicity stunt but damn
L O L
https://twitter.com/ritchietorres/status/1623744585217241092?s=46&t=sln944gLa7MPHk9NQLDBnA
Yeah that is kinda bad but at the same time Ryan is a fairly common surname?
Oh
And I‚Äôm saying this as a trans person lmao
I still don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs such a big deal
I just want a discrete way to get my estrogen and blockers when I start them.
No clue.
I was curious about it since it's kind of appealing of just having your medication delivered to your door and not having to wait in line at the pharmacy.
Amazon has a pharmacy.
Yeah.
This is literally because I'm subscribed to Amazon Prime.
This is with no insurance.
Medication prices are made the fuck up.
What the fuck
It wouldn't surprise me if there is contamination
Regressives sure do like making shit up.
Oh wait. All of these people have the American flag in their name or bio.
A bunch of people on Twitter are saying that it‚Äôs been contaminated but not a single one has a source list.
Can anyone find a source for the vinyl chloride contaminating the Ohio river? All I‚Äôve found is the fact that the water is just being monitored.
evil megacorp
except yknow
so this could be a genuinely good thing for some people
my very limited pharmaceutical knowledge tells me that these are some of the most popular prescriptions in america though
https://pharmacy.amazon.com/rxpass#all-rxpass-meds
the list of eligible meds is very small
wow

what is RxPass
Injectable, not so much.
oral estradiol is cheap as hell
nah I can check on those hang on
my Aripiprazole/Abilify
This is for uhhh
gnrh analogues?
Oh joy
Unless you‚Äôre a contractor
How have they been taking advantage of you
numbers and stuff
But I was looking for like
Wow
Oh wow
What is SNP
That‚Äôs really irritating
They‚Äôre trying to take away gender affirming care for those on Tenncare
Awh. Jimmy carter is dying.
That belief doesn't come from nowhere...

That‚Äôs an option
But yeah
Or PayPal
I need to find one that will pay cash
None that will pay me soon enough
I‚Äôve looked
I don‚Äôt want to get evicted
fuck
and im fucking stuck here
this would be turned around and used against trans people in an instant

I will save this information for later.
Top 3 shows then?
Seasonal garbage consumers, what is the best seasonal show from the last three years?
Before they went under
One of their last works
It was like
The first season was alright, but the second was a steaming pile of garbage that got worse with each week.
But IBO is... not great.
IBO is more palatable than Wing, I'll give it that. I was able to finish IBO whereas I was not able to finish Wing.
IBO is Gundam for Edgelords.
Do they own budgies?
What do you mean?
It is non canonical, therefore I do not care.
The fan service was pretty light in the manga.
‚ÄúWe paid you for 50 episodes, so we‚Äôre gonna get 50 episodes out of you.‚Äù
I like the 00 movie‚Ä¶
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
Definitely a train wreck.
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
All of Gundam SEED Destiny was bizarre.
Are we just talking mainline?
They‚Äôre gonna fuck this up so bad, I already know it.
I‚Äôm also choking on frosted flakes but that‚Äôs besides the point.
I‚Äôm in tears.
Oh my god.
NO
Bring Stability
Abhuool or something long that
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I‚Äôm a sucker for dual cockpits
Exia
Cheridum
Yeah
It was seravee because seravee becomes the backpack in the movie
No
I can‚Äôt remember which was the backpack
Seraphim?
No
Seravee
By that point they had already gone to the ball.
‚Ä¶yes?
Bitch what are these names.
Thanks.
What was the name of the mecha anime that recently aired with the code geass director on its staff.
Does MJP have an ending?
Good music too <:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
M7 makes me cry
Sunrise
Formerly known as Sunruse
Security is only as strong as it‚Äôs weakest link
Vlc
Of the error
Post a screenshot
Watch the compilation movies?
Oh you're watching real robot stuff.
Watch GaoGaiGar then.
Detective Conan
I fucked slammed my hands so on my desk so hard that my pc blue screened when i got to the big twist of EVOL
/s
Aquarion might be up your alley then.
Nah the love interest is just racist and a psychopath
Gargantia is good except for like one or two things imho
Oh man. Been awhile since I thought about this show.
<:HibikiMunch:929758575675473950>
From battle kingdom?
Just the OVA
Black Rock Shooter OVA is like an 8/10
Like I said
‚Ä¶ an 8/10
The movie theater chain
If you waited two weeks Regal is putting them on in theaters

I hate the unicorn Gundam but this is pretty neat
Lol
Didn‚Äôt bleach have to keep coming up with filler arcs because they consistently threatened to out pace the manga
Fear of missing out
FOMO is a hell of a drug.
I‚Äôm aware
$150 for a block of pvc is absurd
Figs are overpriced in general
Box art is accurate

You find a new anime to latch on to for the next season and repeat infinitely until you burn out or die
‚ÄúWelcome to macross delta, this girl is a test tube baby who‚Äôs not even a year old, this girl is already halfway through her life span, and there‚Äôs three other members of our idol group but they were deemed not important so we just gave them ptsd so they could have some semblance of complexity‚Äù
Kawamori is such a hack
I think you mean dusty gal
Heero is what the 14 year old boy who wears a trench coat and sunglasses inside would describe as his role model and is cool
I hope the voice they chose for Noriko has a good set of lungs on her
Thanks for the info Loris
Oh. I didn't know that .
Discotek is a licensing/translating  company afaik
That would be kinda weird tbh.
Is Discotek dubbing Gunbuster or something?
Or Dynazenon
If not, Eva
If you can put yourself into the mindset to enjoy GaoGaiGar I wholly recommend that
That‚Äôs really bad turnout
Oof it‚Äôs just my party and literally one other person in the Macross F False Sonstress showing
Anime movie fans eating good this year
HOLLLLLLYYYYYY SHIIIIIIT
HOLY SHIT
But they‚Äôre perfectly watchable out of order
Each season touches on past events and characters and has a bunch of references and stuff
You‚Äôll be able to appreciate macross more if you watch it sequentially
I love light swords
I too bathe my books
https://twitter.com/6jiro1/status/1538499081689243648?s=21&t=L3IjxKOb3Fw9bVtmV_4Rog
There‚Äôs some madman building a VF-1 Cockpit
The really only noticeable thing that differs from the recap movies and the series is that ||Shirley is not dead.|| That is literally the only thing you need to know to watch Lelouch of the Resurrection and even then its a super minor point.
Yeah

We‚Äôre running out of year lol
Soon this year
That‚Äôs even wilder
Oh holy shit
Or at least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm remembering
So they just broadcasted the boat thing for the entire time slot
And they didn‚Äôt wanna like rub salt in the wound
Specifically knife ones
It‚Äôs because there was like a spring of murders the week of that final episode right?
Boat ending
Monkey dance
No I‚Äôm sick over the fact of build fighters
<:ElsaSick:689395768754569359>
What is the shia qant
<:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>
Raphael Gundam <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
So fucking stupid lmao
Qan[T]‚Äôs are brand spanking new
Exia‚Äôs was ran through and 0 Gundam‚Äôs exploded
Both of them were
There‚Äôs a two year gap between S2 and the movie. If you‚Äôre wanting to mass produce the system you have to account for everything.
With all the research data from the 00 and 00 Raiser
Qan[T] had gn drives specifically made for twin drive system
And hundreds of staff
Two year round trip to Jupiter
What do you mean Melua all it takes is a uh
Reborns Gundam right?
I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre more proof of concept machines than prototypes
Nuclear reactors
Phase shift armor never made it to mainline suits, psychoframe never did, twin drives never did, funnels, etc
Yeah but most of the time that tech doesn‚Äôt go on into the mainline suits
I said antagonist
I did not say villain
Definitely not an idiot
Exactly my point
I‚Äôm talking about Flay
No
Who
Ah gotcha
One of the best antagonists ever out of SEED
At least we got like
And AGE
I‚Äôm not ready to be let down again after Iron Blooded Orphans
I have a reasonable amount of concern/skepticism i think
Not really because it‚Äôs going to be centered around a woman in a Gundam anime
00 S2 really had 3 super weapons in 25 episodes huh
A_Laws developed momento mori
CB‚Äôs laser came first
Not sure
Maybe
No
Momento Mori was the laser that was attached to the orbital ring and drew power from the solar panels or whatever
*celestial being*
Oh yeah
What was it called
It would be fucking funny if it could just burn through a gn drive tau and just get the output of the the space station laser
It sure would be nice if do not disturb actually worked on mobile.
That‚Äôs some good butt rock in the background
Oh my god
I can't believe Jaune is Yuki Kaji
so I'll probably just binge it all when its all released
But I don't wanna get a RT first member ship yet
I was gonna watch those today
what is this, the fucking superbowl?
how
https://hard-drive.net/5-queer-coded-anime-characters-that-are-totally-a-stretch-but-its-pride-month-so-just-let-me-have-this/
Which is neat
It looks like it will be a complete retelling of season 1
Like cornstarch
Just made it thicker
The docks fight at the end of volume one didn‚Äôt really add anything
I mean
They both showed up at the end of volume 1
that‚Äôs fucking funny
LMAO
It sounded so similar to Amata Sora
I could have sworn it was him though
I was wrong
huh
it's not
Oh no
Maybe the BDs will touch things up
This clip has also killed the interest I have in it
Yeah I found a clip on YT and Yuki Kaji has a pretty distinct voice
Why saber when sword
No need for nukes
Colonies are anti city weapons
Well yeah
Floating point error my beloathed
I dare you to watch something from ten years ago
Sometimes I feel like Valvrave was a fever dream
I mean sure
I guess I was looking at the wrong thing
Fair enough
Hm
But I‚Äôm not counting yugioh
Technically three
Wow
There were two original shows last season
To a degree
And that‚Äôs fine
‚ÄúThis is what people were over the moon about? This is what people were singing praises for?‚Äù
I watched one episode of Spy X Family and it was a waste of time.
I mean yeah.
It‚Äôs just recycled worked from someone else.
It doesn‚Äôt try anything new.
It‚Äôs so incredibly safe.
Rather, the modern anime industry is what I hate
I hate modern anime
Sorry
Never mind
You know what my problem is
Actually no
Some of the former, more of the latter
I‚Äôm gonna do that tonight
Cowboy Bebop
You know what I keep getting told to watch but keep dragging my feet on it
Gems also doesn‚Äôt have an ending!
Having someone trying to diagnose all of the gems and be like ‚ÄúI really relate to that one, actually no I really relate to that one‚Äù and ‚Äúthis is such a good representation of mental health problems‚Äù every fucking episode was really frustrating lol
So that‚Äôs probably why
But my viewing experience was dog shit
6/10
Was
Land of the lustrous
Flip Flappers has a thing that leaves a bitter taste in my mouth so I‚Äôm not like fully behind it
I fucking might
I watched one episode of wonder egg and realized it was gonna end in one of two ways and didn‚Äôt bother with another episode
Kinda get away with it
So you can like
But not a proper ending
Most of the stuff that is written nowadays is written to have a conclusion
I mean
I want a finished story and not something that‚Äôs like ‚Äúgo buy the ln/manga lol‚Äù or ‚Äúcontinued in season 2‚Äù
But 1:1 adaptions are what bothers me
That‚Äôs why tropes are a thing
Soon
Coming up on 50

Ugh
Oh yeah
Oh is AX this week
Then why did you go to an anime con
Go find out
I wonder if that will be a nation wide thing
Oh man theyre showing Macross Plus at the theater there :(
I wonder if we‚Äôll get any exciting news
Oh there‚Äôs supposed to be a macross panel at AX
Oh no
I wonder if there's any anime cons near me
I just don‚Äôt like the direction Satelight took with the Macross franchise
Uhhh
I kid
~~fake fan~~
The different between Delta and XV is that SYmphogear was always like that
Get the fuck out of here
Space time bending bacteria that live in your gut and amplify your music with properties that can cure a disease that makes people go insane
And it‚Äôs space magic is even dumber than Frontier‚Äôs
Didn‚Äôt flesh out Walkure
Hayate is just as bland as Alto
Macross Plus BD ain‚Äôt too bad tho
I got excited for literal garbage
Frontier and Delta
Gross

I‚Äôm ready to be emotionally gutted again
No SDF or Seven and that make me sad
SDF :(
<@99695384296701952>
WHAT
I‚Äôm backing off I‚Äôm getting too riled up sorry for digging at y‚Äôall
Leaned super heavy into cute girls sell and make money
There‚Äôs another macross panel today?
Really bad
Anime is
At least it‚Äôs not the anime
Manga or anime?
blugh
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
beautiful
The writing is just
I've only played the VN
I cried through the entire falling action, conclusion and the hot shower i took afterwards
It might not be
It might be to you
I mean
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
Emiya cooking is the best fate work
I misunderstood
Oh
Oh
Is he receptive of their crushes in the manga? I don‚Äôt remember him being that way in the anime
Fair enough
I also wouldn‚Äôt start reading fics without having gotten into Drei
ü§î
Macross's solution to making the jets outer space worthy was to just slap thermo nuclear thrusters on them and i think thats funny
but the VF-1 is such a classic
I like the forward sweeping wings of the later planes
It‚Äôs a good space opera
Deculture

I remember being pretty pissed off at it cause I had only finished madoka 12 hours prior
I need to rewatch rebellion
https://youtu.be/3gR73OGPvVU
lmao
theres an upcoming yt stream with the madoka font
It was too crass for me but I respect it
Panty and Stocking is really neat
You lie
Oh nice
Or just for hot water
For central heating and stuff
Yeah
wacky
never heard of htat
what is it then
its not?
My moral compass leaving my body when the villain is a milf
Shinkalion
What‚Äôs what
>asshole sixth ranger character
>super sick family member they care deeply about and are not an asshole around 

good trope
Oh I was memeing and then I saw it was directed by Imaishi
And have a skull mask
I can‚Äôt wait for the main antagonist‚Äôs hair to be on fire
Yeah
Oh I forgot this was being made
Why didn't anyone tell me that Back Arrow has a cowgirl in it wtf
Why is this character voiced by Sugita one moment and Shinichiro Miki the next
Oh strike witches
What are the neuroi
nah thats november
probably december
i thought it was wrath month
yeah but domon butt made it okay
i assure you dear reader having shiny body suits for our pilots is essential to their combat capabilities
I have that channel muted. So, no. I‚Äôm asking because there‚Äôs been a bunch of announcements today.
Is it unusual for anime announcements to be at AX like this?
When does it transform
Exalted Freedom and Enduring Justice
Oh my
Hundred
Absolutely in love with the fact that Shinkalion has an insert song that kicks off with the departure bell of a train.
This is satire right
What the fuck
Knock them out one by one
I‚Äôm increasingly more convinced that Shinkalion is a story about a bunch of autistic kids with *very* specific special interests
plenty of badly animated knife fights in anime
could be
you‚Äôll know when you get to knife fight
Have you gotten to knife fight yet
A smidge
ü§î
How many episodes was G Witch confirmed for?
Or official subs
I will wait for the fansubbers to do their thing
We have exited backpack gundams and are now entering the age of skirt gundams

Slow internet

Oh

Looks like a studio that work got leased out to
And the last two werent good
Gotta start the war crimes young
Fair enough
Lul
12 or 13
How Old was Uso
Uh wait
No problem
If younger than 13 then yeah
Also
That wasn‚Äôt my question
The real question is do I watch it weekly or wait for it all to come out at once
Fair enough
The mechanical design was really good though!
Actually they're both terrible
Its more the fact that the victim fell in love with her rapist
Honestly
Oh that‚Äôs not too bad then
How is it going full valvrave then
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I feel bed for the poor sod who had to program this lmao
It‚Äôs also definitely made me want to try hot pot
And it really shows off how much the characters have grown
It's warm and fuzzy
Man I'm really enjoying this arc of Shinkalion
It‚Äôs almost as if demon slayer has no substance and is carried by its visuals
Spicy
Oh homophobia
that was a fun genre lmao
back when the magic battle high school genre was fading away

I'm talking about something else
No
What?
Wow I can‚Äôt believe I used to think this show was good
OH MY GOD FUCK OFF
I really doubt we're getting a XV announcement so soon
Seiryu is an excellent deuteragonist
Genbu is living his best life
it‚Äôs not even a meme 10/10
Yeah last night
I‚Äôm still convinced the Shinkalion movie was a fever dream
there‚Äôs a pretty good line between like love triangle and harem
I saw someone call macross a harem series and wanted to strangle them through my screen
Kaworu is a good noodle
It‚Äôs a harem of mental illness
I wanna see the second one because Max is in it
But rock music ;-;
I think the movies are gonna be making rounds in the us I can‚Äôt remember
Ah okay
If you ever watch 7 then that will be answered
Oh boy
Did the second one ever come out
I should watch the delta recap movies at some point
I forgot most of the names of the delta characters tbh
I fucking forgot her name
Now you know why the purple haired girl‚Äôs grandparents are so lauded
I watched M7 before SDF so I was more invested in the main plot, but after watching SDF max and Miriam‚Äôs plot in M7 was really compelling
The main plot of macross 7 is pretty good yeah
I guess either works
Milia
Macross 7 actually leans pretty heavy into Max and Miria‚Äôs relationship at some points
Yes and it‚Äôs fantastic
Oh interesting this is like Way of the HouseHusband
Time to go binge a manga
I'm being targeted
Oh no
55 v 21
It was just half as long as the predecessor
No sorry, I was mistaken
The megaman star force tribe anime was doing so poorly that it got gutted halfway through
God you know what‚Äôs wild
that works too
oh yeah
Wanna be literal
Unless you just
I feel like that's something that could be localized pretty easy
IIRC there's lots of word play?
I feel like the people who come up with these ideas for shows/manga/lns have actually never had a sister...
Dynazenon is super good. I like the  themes of Gridman more and I think it‚Äôs the better written show, but Dynazenon is just buckets of fun.
we're getting an RG Goldymarg to go with RG GaoGaiGar at the same time
oh holy shit
Oh thats kinda funny
God I hope this job interview thing I‚Äôve got coming up goes well cause I would love to put that on my shelves

This tweet was written by Athrun Zala
Imagine being such a flaming homosexual that youre able to rewrite an operating system at mach 1 while having flashbacks about your boyfriend from your days at the lunar academy
And that‚Äôs a really good OP
He did Godannar OP
He‚Äôs done most of the OPs for the Mazinger franchise
Such an iconic voice too
Pretty dire
Yeah no that‚Äôs
Murrue is still Sumeragi and all that
I haven‚Äôt gotten my hands on that redub them
Oh wait it got redubbed? New VAs?
The ‚Äúremaster‚Äù
His use of strings and horns is just incredible
At what he does
Really good
Kouhei Tanaka is just
Man

Neat!
Oh really? I didn‚Äôt know that
Oh Nevermind who ever runs the account is a one piece fan they wouldn‚Äôt know good taste if it smacked them across the face
If they don‚Äôt post the gao gai gar op I submitted they‚Äôre cowards
https://youtu.be/RalgLD4sGGM
Such a weird decision to redub it
Not my first choice
Found a clip of Lacus‚Äôs new voice and it‚Äôs
Rau and Mu are meh? They‚Äôd probably grow on me as I watched
But Cagalli and Natarle just don‚Äôt match imho
I think Kira and Murrues voices are alright
It‚Äôs a mixed bag
Skimmed the first two episodes of the remaster dub
Lip flaps are a smidge off but idc about that
Like
And there‚Äôs been nothing egregious
I found a version of the remaster that has the old dub
I‚Äôll have to find a clip
At least IBO ends with a lesbian marriage
It‚Äôs called IBO
We already have that
i wholly recommend the show
normal as aquarion gets
well
its all normal
like if someone on that art team was into feet in that episode would have been their time to shine but
its not fetish though
episode 6/26
its like
and its not even late game
there's an episode about feet
Don't watch Evol
Just
Aquarion is good
Hayato also had an AI co pilot
I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not the only one who thing hayato is undiagnosed lmao
HA!
Aaaaa I‚Äôm jealous
It's so fucking good.
I'm of the opinion that Dynazenon is the more fun show, but Gridman is the better written show.
I can‚Äôt believe Jun Fukuyama is in Shinkalion Z
Damn, could have fooled me. Your English is impeccable.
Shin Godzilla is fantastic at demonstrating that yeah.
Too much
QR Code eating robot, QR Code train robot gacha, and Evil QR codes
Fucking Shinkalion Z
Oh no
Zero to Hero and I‚Äôll make a man out of you are both fantastic songs
Mulan and Hercules hold a special place in my heart
But
I know Disney is a shit company
Oooh good choice
That‚Äôs really cool
Oh wow
Wow these guys are fucking cockroaches
If this is true then it‚Äôs DOA
I choked on my fucking cereal
https://www.dualshockers.com/bleach-thousand-year-blood-war-disney-plus/?amp
Nice.
Is Lycoris an anime original
Oh did they that‚Äôs good the.
I bet it‚Äôs sweltering in there tho
Man mobile suit cosplays are so neat
A quarter of a year
13 generally
Didn‚Äôt realize that
Oh
||bad shape vs outright death is pretty big||
Does it actually that‚Äôs an incredible deviation from the show
https://twitter.com/anime/status/1558988356608049154?s=21&t=BRtUwgvvg5ejh1dQje1z4Q
???
This is the show people were raving about
A virtual idol
Still
Yeah
I don‚Äôt remember much of macross plus tho
Iirc they already did a semi vtuber plot
Nevermind keep milking delta
Domon butt is a good meme
Yeah Code Lyoko was super neat
Yeah I can see that argument
A shame it wasn‚Äôt really related to the greater lbx story
Lbx girls <:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
Fair enough
Is there already a series in preproduction?
I think that if X leaned all the way into the magic robot thing then it could have been good.
~~I kid I do think V is the better written out of all of them~~
Because it has GaoGaiGar
T is the best of the three
Srw x is bad
I think it was too gay for disney
That's what I meant
A shoujou romcom is just gonna feel different and be structured different than a romcom like Kaguya
Ah my bad that wasn't my intention
But it is a shoujou romcom
It's a pretty decent series
And congrats
Well done
Oh damn this is really well written
I wouldn‚Äôt trust a kid to do it safely
Cable/Satellite isn't any better.
I love ry bread
Back in my eastern animation is better than western animation phase
I remember searching it out in highschool to watch
That‚Äôs pretty sad actually
Oh was that it
The first anime I watched in Japanese was Megaman NT Warrior
Have you tried asking on some manhua forums? They may be able to help you better.
Wild
Shinkalion Z just named a reoccurring extra character 80+ episodes later
That's not too bad. Just next year.
i'll probably end up binging the entire series at once since watching stuff weekly kills my interest in it
Hmmm to watch or not to watch
I could wait for IBO, I can wait for this.

What the fuck
He wasn‚Äôt too bad
Ian
What was his name from 00
STAND UP TO THE VICTORY
Wow that‚Äôs cringe
Incredible
I did not know that gif had a dog in it
LMAO
Reincarnated Into another world as a magical girls familiar????
Looks like sailor moon cat
Ruce
I mean at that point Eva was a multi billion yen franchise by the time rebuilds came out
Punk is such a good look
https://twitter.com/drcullenphd/status/1573434246496423937?s=46&t=jsJ08a9FjQpOQJAGgGYpxQ
Lol
Yes. <:gigachad:965686298805403708>
So that‚Äôs nice
Flamingly homosexual in some places
Gundam 00 is also like
e7 is a good coming of age story
I was worried he would just be a cameo
Max is a baller character
Yes
At some point
I‚Äôll download
Ok
Bluuuuuugh
Is it the final one
Ahhhhh
Wait <@228659769404030976> is the second Delta movie out????
Wild
Do they actually lmao
God the cloud surfing in frontier was so fucking fun
i fucking love lucy's design
Watching edge runners finally
Isekai bad
Bad
Edgerunners is insanely good
Do that one first
Hmmm
Oh promare is a good movie
Gaogaigar good
||fiance√©||
What the fuck
Holy shit I saw screenshots
That‚Äôs just
It had a polycule as the center point relationship
IBO was weird
50 episodes later Nuker becomes a Gundam fan
If it doesn‚Äôt fall through! Just need a couple more people
Planning and writing
Ish
Been busy
I have not
<:ShirabeMad:688188118087499792>
Fiiiiine I‚Äôll watch it weekly
Wow
Edgerunners was
But I guess I don‚Äôt need to at this point with how many screenshots are being shared around lol
I haven‚Äôt seen the episode yet
Hm
Aww
LOL
Patrick was a fun character
Oh
https://twitter.com/180223/status/1577690740896866307?s=46&t=9Y0aWxBSHcmIkOTbpoqzRw
The prologue was my kind of tone
I hope so
I'm intrigued
Just finished EP1 and Prologue of G_Witch
||dear diary today i killed another of jerid's friends||
A good hook means nothing if you don't have a fishing line
Is to live up to that first episode
That's probably gonna be their biggest challenge
Oh yeah definitely
Whatever drugs were done to make that first episode of Akiba Maid War, I want them
Someone is salty it seems
Happy birthday to the gundam that had a lot of good ideas and was too ambitious so it crashed and burned
https://twitter.com/180223/status/1578784789187928065?s=46&t=obV9r41D9yoqUaV8ht2ZWg
Lol
Damn right.
Gunleon!
Suletta spills spaghetti every time she opens her mouth and I love it
Incredible
How are they supposed to span a fight over thirteen episodes then
Lmao
Fold bacteria that lives in your gut
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Kyun kyun
It‚Äôs such a good show
God I wanna watch gaogaigar again
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
My bad
Oh fair
Yeah it doesn‚Äôt
About some form of ||rebirth due to guy becoming an evoluder at the end of the series||
I think
There‚Äôs an argument to be made
I gotta watch the second episode
Oh yeah it‚Äôs got thriller vibes then
I guess
Because political thriller is pretty apt imho
Then what would be?
I especially loved the political thriller
S1 managed to combine mecha, political thriller, and slice of life really well
You should change that
<:MikuGun:1009850043093753916>
Have you seen it?
00 had some good social commentary
Sawano carried that anime on his back and they still lost the race
Don‚Äôt worry, that‚Äôs the normal experience
When they start to do their own thing in stead of the one year war then its p good yeah
Have fun
Oh are you watching seed
Even racism
Yes
Very possibly could be
<:derpeline:714574361440419963>
so that's where I thought it was indian
and they were indian in origin
in stars without number there's a company called banagher heavy construction
i know where i saw it from
no
i thought it was indian
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banagher
also a town in ireland
indian
isn't banagher like
Oh this episode
Is this spy x family but gay

G Witch was good again this week
What‚Äôs wrong with episode 12
ü§®
Wtf
Did they I‚Äôll have to find it
Chuchu had a heated gamer moment
Let the anime sink in
Hold off a couple days on the movie
which only turns on right as theyre hit or something
they have a reactive phase shift armor
My gundam trivia is bad so I‚Äôll shut up now
Oh whoops
And phase shift armor
I have been corrected on my 00 statement
In AGE it‚Äôs because of the AGE system
In 00 it‚Äôs because they have genuine solar reactors
Minor 00 spoilers for an irrelevant character
Patrick was also infamous ||for falling in love with his commanding officer and marrying her at the end of the tv show||
Guel has chosen the path of Patrick rather than Jerid.
God I wish
White Glint <3
quad legs best legs

I am thinking about how Basara Nekki is unironically a well written autistic character
I dropped it because I lost interest, how did it end?
4 discs <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
The real One piece was the profits we made along the way
Oh
If you‚Äôre referring to Shirobako then <@331908049822547978> just finished it
Or planetary years
Could be that she‚Äôs referring to a different event
GWITCH WAS FUCKING AMAZING THIS WEEK
and a wife beater
alcoholic
this is my new favorite tweet
exciting
oh she looks like she might be wearing a dress in ghta timage
Yeye
Miorine really rocked that dress.
||the director is doing such a good job making prospera seem sinister||
THATS WHAT MIORINE REMINDS ME OF
A COCKATIEL
Gwitch does seem to spur the most discussion here
Hmm come to think of it, it wouldn‚Äôt be hard to have a bot that automatically creates threads on certain days? ü§î
Discord‚Äôs api has full support for threads
If you program then wrong
I think Melua was contemplating threads

Because it wasn‚Äôt brought up that some of the discussion could be migrated to the appropriate channel until last week
<#377148557796442134> <:ShirabeWhisper:620073899001905153>
It‚Äôs really sad.
Yeah‚Ä¶
That's an interesting trailer.
Less gooooo ChuChu sweep
Very sad
No gwitch this week right
Why are Guel and Nika in Pok√©mon
Symphogear fans probably would not exist outside japan without piracy.
Huh
The what
I watched one episode of Watamote and found it really uncomfortable to watch
Could be wrong
IIRC the Watamote girl... didn't
Bocchi wants to improve as a person
I mean
i think ill like this show
episode 2 down
Bocchi needs a hug
I understand the hype
I watched the first episode of Bochhi
I don‚Äôt mind that he plays him really well.
Asemu kinda sucks doesn‚Äôt he
‚Ä¶
Ditch the birth of your kid to go hang with your new pirate buddies and fake your death
On that sigma grind set
Chadsemu
They‚Äôre pretty close to being fully grown
So maybe they have an inch or two left to grow but uh
16-17
I mean most of these guys are like
Tall girl supremacy
Need to finish the series.
I can't choose who I like more <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Ahaha Kita is gay as fuck for Ryou.
I like how the first thing Bocchi notices about Kita is that she's pretty.
Yeah I'm only on episode 3.
Bocchi-chan kinda gay
Wrong channel?
I mean when you use a rape scene for "world building" in the first five minutes of your show...
ive been looking for an excuse to rewatch ggg
Edge runners or gao gai gar
The fact that the sequel to new game was not called new game ++ was a missed opportunity
Ahahah what the fuck
https://twitter.com/_sasukeloops/status/1612082967224143873?s=46&t=l8UzN2Yg1Jnh5JqSHJbEHQ
It‚Äôs really bad
It‚Äôs bad
Please never watch SEED Destiny
I don‚Äôt get that but sure
And then in the first battle against the strike freedom the Destiny still ran out of battery somehow?
‚ÄúNuclear powered mobile suits are against the treaty but what if we use nuclear power to keep a battery topped off and have the mobile suit run off that?‚Äù
Specifically the Hyper Deuterion Engine
Thinking about how stupid some of the tech in Gundam SEED Destiny is
Oh I hate that this makes sense
If anything it‚Äôs the fault of the show for not explaining it
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I spent way too much time on Gundam forums in high school
The consensus is that it‚Äôs a reactor that keeps a battery topped off
Again
So i abbreviated
I‚Äôm too lazy to type all that out
Yeah
It‚Äôs literally just qi charging for mobile suits.
No?
That‚Äôs just an energy transfer system. Not a method of storing and utilizing power.
Looks like it
Gravion was just all monster of the week without anything really overarching.
Gravion Zwei was better than Gravion
It‚Äôs everything wing is but infinitely better
If you want to watch wing just watch 00
Buddy complex is pretty unoffensive and Gundam wing is just bad
That was not my experience at all with it.
man that shit really ticks me off
it did have a lot of money poured in to it
that is an incredibly shallow reason
But 00 s1 is probably like the best thing you can offer to a non Gundams fan, hell a non Mecha fan
I‚Äôm gonna get flak for this
Lots of intrigue and politics and mystery and drama
Really good
00 s1 is also just
It‚Äôs great
G Gundam is super racist
Patch worker
Horrible really
There‚Äôs canonical slurs for coordinators
Oh my god
SRWV made him pretty likeable tho
Shinn could have been interesting!
I found out about Gundam back when I used to frequent an Internet forum called the rock man exe zone and someone had hacked the game to make the strike freedom take Megamans sprite and I was so entrhalled by the sprite that I had to know where it was from I lost interest in the first episode of seed and thought it looked ugly but then I soon found out about 00 and watched that instead
But it‚Äôs the second Gundam I finished
It was the first Gundam I tried watching
I‚Äôm fond of seed
Nice
Really?
Ooo
But I‚Äôll let you judge for yourself
SEED is a poor show tho
I like it
The strike Gundam is really sexy
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
I liked how 00 S1 kinda went into the science of GN particles and then in S2 they became super robots
It‚Äôs a ton of fun to make fun of Wing‚Äôs stats
Like
Still wanna know and make fun of them
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Unless Gundam is a society that has transcended money
I‚Äôm a sucker for that
Give me raw numbers
But like
Asteroid mining makes sense
I guess
Eva kinda touched on the economics of war but it was really just waving a magic wand
How many small countries had to be destroyed for the materials for that thing
I wanna know how much the Big Zam cost to make
Costs
Man you know what Gundam is really bad at but I wish they even gave us an inkling to
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
No way
Wait what
It is
I think that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm picking up on
LMAO
Idk maybe I‚Äôm projecting
But despite being a heterosexual couple, Kira and Lacus just feel queer
I can‚Äôt explain this
It‚Äôs two cours
Or 25
Uh 26
A rather graphic inspection too.
Having a prison pocket inspection in episode one was a bold choice.
He‚Äôs a rapist
Oh boy
Nicely done
Costs less to do instrumental licenses.
Good taste.
Promare is great.

What a shitty core fighter.
As long as you can justify it I don‚Äôt see a problem
I have it on vinyl :3
Soundtrack does a lot of the heavy lifting
Troy Baker did an alright Joker in Arkham Origins.
Also know how it ends so
Haven‚Äôt watched
I know of it
It‚Äôs always fun when magic is depicted as like
I think I hate this
I watched it when it first came out and I did not like it then and that was when I was trying to consume as much mecha content as I could so I doubt I‚Äôd like it now
High level math and science
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
King Solomon in Fate/‚Ä¶ not so much.
King Solomon actually was pious and wise.
But no.
I'm watching Melua play Prince of Persian Forgotten Sands and they're talking about King Solomon and how he was a wise and generous king and I'm like "Didn't he try to rule the world or something like that? Something's not clicking."
I‚Äôd like to thank the Fate/ franchise for permanently fucking up my knowledge of history.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I‚Äôm fucking blind
IT WAS ABOVE LYCO
OH
How many bds did Bocchi sell
I feel like Bocchi the rock is best consumed through YouTube clips
Yep!
Oh yeah
The timing on it was perfect
God that gag was so good
No he lives
I recommend it
Godonnar is good yeah
I like that they chose studios around the globe instead of just anime studios
That could be fun
Oh shit
I don‚Äôt recognize any of these studios this time
Ginga Bishounen
Good taste Millhi
üëè
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Big robot use galaxies as frisbees
Okay but counterpoint
First act is kinda slow
Good two hours
Two hours?
Yeah it‚Äôs what
~~Gridman is just animated toku~~
FUCK IM SO STUPID
WAIT
No, that‚Äôs number 69 <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
*aggressive folding phone noises*
I know what I‚Äôd put on my top ten mecha list but I‚Äôm not sure where I‚Äôd put it on there
Hm that‚Äôs tough
Number 4‚Ä¶
They‚Äôre really good
There I started it for you
1. GGG
I need to finish it at some point
Idk I don‚Äôt mind it too much
Anna was 17 at the start of the show
Wholly ‚Äúconsensual‚Äù
Main couple is a 17 and 29 year old
Although I don‚Äôt think comparing infinity Koji to Koji from the 70s is very fair
Never forget that koji kabuto is a wife beater
I just watched it dubbed lol
Geass R3?????
Spare yourself
Please don‚Äôt watch Gundam wing
Absolutely shameless and it's perfect.
I get what <@99695384296701952> means about Gun X Sword episode 3 being a 12/10 episode.
oh my god
It‚Äôs the episode with the dudes who use their mustaches to press buttons and walk
The mustaches
What the fuck
Oh my god the second episode of gun x sword
Didn‚Äôt it kick off the battle school harem trend
Can‚Äôt believe infinite stratos got away with having two abusive childhood friends in the harem
Content
It's not even old at this point. It's flat out annoying/obnoxious.
<:worryweird:875062705424318465>
What?
Time to get a second job lol
Oh interesting
What is soul of Chogokin
Why does GaoFighGar cost 40,700 yen.
Wait what‚Äôs this
Space vampires that eat your memories!
Mech designs good tho
The second piece of media I complete this year and it‚Äôs fucking this

I‚Äôll be driving at that thing
2am fuck
l
Maybe I can watch while I work
What time JsT
Oh shit
:<
Yeah something like that
I CANT WAIT TO WAIT 8 MONTHS FOR IT TO BE SUBBED
HOOOOOOLY FUCK ITS COMING
Yeah
The entire franchise references past seasons in subsequent seasons and it makes it easier to appreciate
Also if ur gonna start on macross start with SDF or DYRL
1. Money
2. Better Animation
3. Original content
Oh that‚Äôs tragic.
Alright grandpa let‚Äôs get you to bed
only two shows i watched in 2022 lol

WOW
Wow it must be really bad for Lexi to speak ill of it.
Great even.
They sound good.
I got some new cans.
I should watch Promare tonight.

Yeah not doable
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
And the venue is an hour away from my residence
But they‚Äôre also being opened by Epica too so it would be like an hour and a half thing
Yeah if it was Friday or Saturday sure
I‚Äôd be wearing a mask
Monday at 8pm in Nashville is uh not ideal
Not sure if I‚Äôll take it.
I‚Äôve got the opportunity to see Sabaton live in October.
Good choice
Which album do you like the most
Rad
Oh man I‚Äôm jealous
Really good power metal.
I really love how silly Gloryhammer‚Äôs songs are.
Man.
It's a side by side of the reference models and the actual animation
https://youtu.be/sCoJvu8PF7Q
This is kinda cool
I should finish G Gundam at some point
