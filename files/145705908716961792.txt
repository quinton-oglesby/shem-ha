extra question, how does one remove color as of right now?
something along the lines of too annoying to overlook
can we get a neon green for noise? for their 'eye' color <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
what color will Ogawa be <:thonk:561259770707836929>
we kind of have Maria for grey ish?
what color tho
I watched both when it aired, they were about the same thing airing the same day <:kappa:743344568291950663>
don't know about source
i'd say cavalry got the better anime
~~there are none~~
we can watch asterisk and rakudai kishi no cavalry together and spot the differences
and **there's one mutual server** there's something wrong
if official discord DMs you
<:worry:726253098733011026>
~~you overestimate how fast government change citizen names~~
<:Kapp:661023855854223364> I've seen Mel pings every once in a while, though idk how many mod moments happen without pings
muting should be fine? since people usually ping when mods are needed no?
<a:Peace:495445219114876929>
~~you know, this proves a point of needing more mods considering that people are chatting in <#336299268107403274> ~~
polls can be done through reacts
there isn't enough people participating to have a server event post
opt in role is good enough
cgdct is peak anime, how dare you
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
hullo
<:Ver:336656981144109066> or just torrent it since CR servers can sometimes die, torrenting is likely the most smooth experience outside of good-internet-countries

ignite got bapped AXZ final ignition
but Ignite is dead <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

*doesn't mean it doesn't hit hard*
from the XV trio, they need a main point set first
"Gathering intel"
yes.
green fire also appeared when Carol loses first time to ignite
is a cliffhanger for a movie really needed when the fanbase is *this extreme*
too wild of a ride since final TV series
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176> we have these in Taiwanese night markets
according to wikipeds  this is the pachinko machine from 70s

Pachinko release before XDU <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>

Pachinko collab ads with literally anything lol
if you do listen to the sympho radio, there's people who mail them and say that they got into the series by Pachinko
<:Ver:336656981144109066> Pachinko is power

Bikki has a set as well

I still remember the most stupid nightmare I had when I was in elementary school so
some nightmares do <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
but I decided not to because I am big brain <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
tbh that's probably the easiest way to remember a dream consistently
other than geah probably has something to do with it
yeah, but I don't remember any details from the dream anymore
I don't remember anything anymore, but I remember having the urge to open discord immediately waking up
i vaguely remember i had a geah dream today

some reference to some super old stuff according to Mel
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ~~Enki just had to git gud~~
~~carol runs on horny~~
whadya mean edge energy
but then if memory intact biki can find Carol prior to doll activation
Fine won't build a tower to break the moon but make a spaceship and bring Airghetlamh to the moon
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
will S1 even happen if Hibiki told Fine that there's a hologram Enki on the moon
git adam
find Carol prior to doll activation
prevent G from happening makes Shem-Ha not reawaken because apple won't be sung
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> wake up from the dream and G will change completely because she would know Ver is a cray
but that would make faust robe a part of 7 songs?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> i was serious
SoL epilogue OVA <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
i'm assuming they're stealing Adam+SG spellcaster's power?

from what the support group is saying, they are actually converting energy from adam's beam and not phonic gain
idk
maybe then?
AXZ last fight, Adam crushes SG's spellcaster and uses the energy to shoot at them?
SG philosopher stone upgrade? ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Aoi Yukachi Nana all wants to do a live after XV

welcome to pvp online gaming communities
so idk
the streamer was trying to reach rank 1 EU
like, his random teammates and the enemy team fools around and doesn't let the game end
I mean there was a streamer for league who apparently got banned for flaming people who held the game hostage because he's a streamer
ain't the world in a good spot right now? i hate it too.
Isn't there fixed schedule for classes then?...
I'm assuming you're attending big lectures only?
if he's going to be an ass for you virtually there's something wrong
you do need to keep him out of your stuff though
doesn't mean he can be an ass all day long, tell him to deal with his own business and stop poking his head in yours
how does one have such an ass of a family <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
make another account make it anonymous
then don't post it online, post it here directly
they announce the reason...?

Complete outsider's perspective: I don't see how guns are needed for self-defense, it reduces the mental tax that comes with killing people. Knives are threatening enough to defend yourself with imo
I have a friend that always goes on about how the press doesn't get what semi-auto means <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
can I just say that I'm scared because Taiwan will probably be next if HK works out for China?
https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dd67yn/trump_reportedly_promised_chinas_president_that/
never actually looked into it ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
it's my way of saying fucked?
don't think so?
it's like they don't know that Taiwanese people get cucked hard when working in China
As much as the people here support HK in their stuff, the Chinese server I stick around in went over this topic by saying "lol why don't they just let China rule over, nothing is going to change"
they merged, lots of old blizz people left apparently.
*I thought they weren't going to do HS tourneys anymore*
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> oh cool, 2 more Taiwanese cucked out of a job
caster was cucked 200%, player is going to yell it anyways <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

but wait, netease takes a portion of the money they make in china
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073> just keep on praising china, maybe they'll shed some money on you
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604> decided to check school email to be greeted by school alert saying that there was a shooting 6 blocks away
you can always report "higher than expected" to the investors if you don't predict until results come out <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~it's always going to be "above what Blizzard predicted" because they can just predict it's shite~~
3 cost adds 5 coins seems broken

I'm potato
phone is bought in China, ofc the region is set as China mainland
I could find HK on mine
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
thanks apple
I can't find Taiwan flag on my phone
`Business Hall of Bootlickers:

Blizzard: ban players for supporting Hong Kong democracy protest

Apple: censor Taiwan flag emoji in iOS in Hong Kong & Macau

Vans: censor pro-HK democracy design in its shoe design competition

NBA: rebuked Rockets manager for his "Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong" tweet, saying NBA was "extremely disappointed with Morey's inappropriate comment."

After decades of opening up wide the US market to China while turning a blind eye to rampant Chinese IP thefts, forced technology transfers, and Chinese protectionism, we are looking at widespread control of US businesses by China.

This is just what we're seeing publicly. Imagine how bad it really is behind closed door.`
reading through the blizz posts in /r/worldnews i come across a comment
or are they only gonna fuck the Taiwanese casters
well, are the casters going to get fired
lmao ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
hopefully something happens
~~honestly unlikely because Mei's voicing is very mainland Chinese dialect~~
what were they covering up again? when they made 76 gay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfo3BE2qLLQ
but
I haven't watched the whole video and checked the source
this was one of the comments

this was in the front page of /r/rainbow6

it feels like it's more of their own E3
is blizzcon really for building community?
and probably investors
lmao all they care about is all the whales they have to keep because HS keeps on rolling new card packs
he isn't shoving the bible down everyone's throat
yeah but 8 words
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> Taiwanese casters still get 6 month ban for something they have no control over

well they're doing pretty shit at their job <:kappa:312951362935848990>
from what im getting now they only relay info
what does WHO actually do to help specific countries?
okay world you do you
my god North Korea is in the UN
man the world is so nice <:Kappa:586280887528718344>
I don't have a Chinese passport, we have our own government
google says A nation with it's own government, occupying a particular territory
what is the definition of a country
lulw
oh cool Taiwan isn't in the UN
so isn't it better to take a more reliable source than a corrupt one?
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
maybe i'm just pissed off at China again
but doesn't WHO get their funds mainly from America?
they were ignoring information though? I thought they're supposed to gather them...?
https://youtu.be/lmsqeFAlSGA?t=350
did they really though? this is probably extremely biased because im a Taiwanese
<a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>
and then a guy came over and said *who's the frog in the well, you had to jump over the firewall to laugh at us*
and I went to the comments and saw a few mainlanders saying we're the frog in the well being satisfied on our own
so, youtube decided to shove me a few videos on Covid-19 situation in Taiwan and that they're doing well
I don't follow politics but this year's candidates are both bad again right?

it's okay it's just sarcasm haha
i think nothing can top his injecting disinfectant galaxy brain talk
it reminds me majority of the people are assholes and i don't like it
no
free speech is free until i don't like what you say
it feels like he's stuck in a highschool chuunibyo fantasy
does he actually know the rules?
CoD season gets postponed because of riots, kek "vidya games are not for political views" bans anything about HK and then delay for protest in states
police are acting like hooligans now?
so what the fuck is this
remember lads, it's not free speech until I like the things you say
yikes
lets pop those tires so you leave faster!
let me drag your bike and make you leave
wahoo, you should leave because your opinion sucks

At least most country didn't fuck around for long, America is still fucking around because of *reasons*
considering that there might be two types already, it doesn't work
according to some friends of mine, it's possibly airborne now
*he fucking knows I have no friends and have 0 fucking reason to go out*
and all my contact with people is the front desk and food delivery
when he goes out during the day more than I do
because I'm coughing a lot
roommate came to me today and told me to get covid tested tomorrow
~~considering that international students are big in their income kekw~~
I'm glad that universities actually stood up

i want to bonk my roommate so hard right now
<:bonk:714734933146599435>
like lmao fuck you
and then he threatens me that he'll tell the people in the apartment if I don't
like what the fuck
he said he's only getting tested if I get tested positive
for fucks sake
he also said that I've been sneezing a lot lately and **he knows I have allergies**
well, the stick itself was long
yeah, I got to use a short swab
I didn't take bio after highschool lmao
I don't fucking know anymore
all they need is probably mucus
it doesn't go that deep
it was a self swab so <:KEKW:646883441450942504>
i had my brain probed?
the fuck what
glad the people working here aren't assholes too
and told them not to help us
the people working here for a long time literally told us that he's a fuckin asshole and told them to not fix the AC for us
take this portable AC in the kitchen and hope that you can keep your doors open and have no privacy between roommates
broken AC? 3 months? don't care <:KEKW:646883441450942504>
feels great
old apartment manager moved and the new one is a racist asshole
it's the same brand of instant noodles my roommate got in the past, and he got tired of it. He tossed me his extras lol
but I don't remember anyone with Zhou either
but I don't know many Chinese people by their Chinese name
oh, my roommate said his full name
<a:angershake:693662614504472627>
I'm sure there's no rule saying no jokes in serious?
I stay passive in my studies so, I don't think so?
no
stop making me doubt a box of instant noodles <:KEKW:646883441450942504>
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
but it's instant noodles and the packaging still good
I don't remember interacting enough with anyone for them to get me instant noodles. Everyone I was on good terms with graduated already ._.
<:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
and I can't remember anyone
and my roommate returns saying someone bought instant noodles for me with the family name Zhou
I'm pretty antisocial and don't have friends at all in Uni
confused at life right now
I am uhh
nowhere in the world is safe now
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
it's not like the people are asking for it
as if they *need* to do it
it's just petty mental shit
<a:Rimusigh:513540184428642314>
boo hoo I don't have this, imma make y'all call Taiwan Chinese Taiwan or else imma stop trading
China's political actions towards Taiwan and Hong Kong are like fucking infants trying to get toys <:Kappa:586280887528718344>
wage ain't the best
but I have to say
Taiwan is relatively open to foreigners
My family are all introverts, what memories <:Kappa:586280887528718344>
doesn't help that blue skies are rare <:Kappa:586280887528718344>
eeh, didn't have much love for the place after living there for more than a decade
~~Living in China doesn't give you any political power either~~ *looks towards Winnie the pooh*
I mean it's just how they're taught and the environment imo
if you're a mainlander, better hold the opinions close to yourself
because the culture is branched off so much already
but I don't like to be called Chinese
probably Han Chinese
yes
**if you want to claim Taiwan as your own, how about stop being racist and give us actual fucking passports**
my opinion on the matter is
guess who else have big ego, Americans
yeah, it means that they're people with big ego
yeah, but covid isn't one of them lmao
since when did anyone say China is a friend, they were never on the moral high ground for all the shit they're doing lmao
it's all just flare with no actual plan of what he wants to do
I mean, all the TV news and the stuff he shows up on TV
glad he didn't get elected because he has no plan for what he's gonna do as president as the majority of his influence while running is just "vote for me, I work for the people"
all I knew was that he's very socialist and likes PRC
because I barely ever go back
I don't know party names by heart for ROC politics
Han Guo Yu
he was diss-ing PRC during covid conferences, so he's probably pro ROC
Japan's vice PM gives me hope <a:15min:490152383708659730>
we nearly had a PRC sympathizer be preisdent in ROC last election, and the current president is on her last term. I don't know how it's gonna be next election tbh
like how HK shit went down?
because there's a chance nobody will back ROC and it's gonna not even be a war?
once you pair the parts together it becomes a lot easier
they're usually the same but with parts being more complicated
simplified Chinese and traditional is actually pretty similar
friend is PRC, I'm ROC
<:KirikaSadQuiet:699748089933856842>
that's what I think so too. But like, imagine being a friend of someone and telling them hey, *my country is about to attack yours*
while we're on the China bad topic, my university "friend" came to me a few days back and said "hey Biden won, I've heard analysts saying that China will attack Taiwan next year"
ain't this lad a great fucking friend
wae, text died down real quick
Kuugen, if you're gonna go about how China is being a problem, covid is not the right foot to start on lol
man America is becoming more and more of a shithole by the day
so like, are trespassers will be shot signs actually legal or what <:Kappa:586280887528718344>
nice PS
from the black protests to now having not enough manpower, makes me feel like most the police *are* the extremists?
last time I remember you can arrest people for the most random reasons
so like, why aren't extremists being arrested?
onion kekw?
<:THONK:442446969886081034>
a police hand holding a rioter down the stairs
kekw, they're actually getting arrested? no white privilege this time?
KEKW
don't think so
well they could have worded it better
ok
2021 <:PogChamp:614837333740617770> is violent
2020 üëå is racist
man he feels like someone held him at gunpoint to read off a teleprompter
mmmhmm
and then go on and say that they're the ones being oppressed
peaceful protest
ah yes
beat up a man doing his job chanting USA
TIL
I didn't know that google had their own social media
but it's probably just gmail and uploading stuff isn't it
imagine if they IP block him so he has to bing/yahoo <a:xdd:558152091516796948>
google ban?
you think they really need to be hand held off the steps of the capitol building?
also doesn't help the fact that while watching live news on the day I saw a police officer hand hold a person down the steps
I mean if it takes this long for the law enforcers to get the twats out of the white house while it takes probably less than half the time for them to form a line for BLM, something seems racist
I mean it wouldn't be surprising if it's true
<:THONK:442446969886081034>

why do I think someone said the exact same thing when he first got elected or when he was impeached the first time?
there's server limit? how much is it?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
why do you need any communication application other than discord
relatively old message app, pretty dead in my eyes
welp, I'm half way there
because they do it, we should do it too mentality
or is it saying that not wanting slavery is hypocritical and that we should still have slavery today
is it my reading comprehension being bad
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
apart from that
È¨•Âú∞‰∏ª and ÊäΩÈ¨ºÁâå
a few Chinese card games use them
apparently off duty popo was in the crowd too
<a:Kannasippy:463963077054824449>
https://youtu.be/FoP9ufM3bjw
because all the news is about 10 confirmed cases in one of the hospital and getting 1100 people quarantined and disinfected because of it
can't find any news of it
<a:Clap:512324755525730319>
intern-kun calling out for help through bernie memes that they want to unionize
right, so you get covid and spread it to her during the 1 week incubation period <:THONK:442446969886081034>
~~they don't give us passports so fuck off~~
the ideology of the government is different
I mean our common sense is already different from mainland
most are from WWII shit
considering most of the population aren't original Taiwanese natives
don't think there is much
and Chinese people have the audacity to say their people aren't racist like Americans
<a:8994_TohruThumbsUp:693367153998561310>
you'll probably never see them in the cities though
yes, there are still original natives
perhaps, I am not a big history guy
<:THONK:442446969886081034>
oh yeah, mainlanders calls us "the frogs in the well" when they're the ones stuck behind a firewall
you won't be able to tell people apart unless dialect or the person says it
yes
üëÄ
it's not stuck anymore
https://istheshipstillstuck.com/
and how they scramble because of Chinese air force a lot
Japan airforce interview on one of the guys
: ^ )
and then get reminded that China fucking sucks once again
I get this in my youtube recs
https://youtu.be/T2YaOS_cKZ4
could have just you know, put rails and put some trams in those tunnels
<:Wheeze:581253400381882368>
as if being not gay will
"you will never achieve immortality"
I live under a rock, enlighten me. Why is this not in China's interest? If Russia can get away with shit it just means China can too and then they can go ahead and occupy Taiwan or some shit
Does it really work if Russia can still do business in RMB?
I thought she moved out a while ago to a friend's place? I guess I was wrong
didn't expect to find this announcement today, she was nice <:Sadge:735758654531436645>
mind boggling how people can say guns make people safer when shit like this happen so much
how many were there? what the fuck?
so I open youtube and there's another shooting today in a hospital and the video starts with "and for the 8th consecutive night we start this broadcast with a shooting"
~~time to break out the 'ol flip phone going to the abortion clinic then~~
got health checkup for mandatory military service later today, fasted for a day to be underweight on BMI chart, will return in a few months to complain if they return that I have to still do mandatory military service : ^ )
not good at overweight
it's pretty good at underweight
if someone has the BMI of 16, they're thin, there is no other option
also BMI is weight compared to height so <:kappa:957459884138455090>
average in height for Western standard, just thin
I think below 16.5 you can dodge military service
16 BMI
let me check my BMI again
yes
if you're underweight enough
easy game
got out because underweight
no
All I see is Russia invade bad Ukraine push back good, what else is there to say? : ^ )
I see arguing about Ukraine and Russia
what's happening here üëÄ
although it doesn't matter since I don't care about politics in Taiwan apart from don't fucking become CCP
I hate the naming for Taiwan's party system, I think my family stand closer to modern DPP <:KEKW:796426664622948392>
edit: mom came in and said we lean closer to whichever party has the leader that is more pro Taiwan than pro China kekw
feel free to buy a ticket over to Taiwan and start your own party buddy
lmao
I'd choose modern KMT any day of the week?
so like, this guy comes in calls KMT a cuck when the other option is the CCP...
I never did MUN, I never got the point of it lmao
heh, now he's gonna pull the white terror card
hmmmmmm
right, this guy is pulling WW2 history thinking it's the same thing modern day KMT
lmao
pretty sure the American ones are less advanced ones?
how so?
there's a lot of desirable stuff here in Taiwan, but if they attack, it'll all be scrapped <:kappa:957459884138455090>
I mean
: ^ )
all I hope is that Ukraine can claim back everything and show China not to shoot their own feet and provoke a war with Taiwan
all I want to say is this is the right choice because since when did Russia ever keep their promise on not invading things <:KEKW:796426664622948392>
I am trying to read but brain bad
so like, what was the Ukraine Russian argument about just now? that the border should return to pre-2014?
Yuuki Aoi short? or higher than that?
because Japan actually improved TW's quality of life
yes
all the Asian countries hate each other and love each other's product. It's weird lmao
we don't get passports from mainland
we don't receive anything from mainland
I mean calling us Chinese is also a big stretch?
which region?
anyone who argue otherwise can go call Japanese and Koreans Chinese too
I think Taiwan has split far enough from China to be able to call themselves not Chinese
<:kappa:957459884138455090>
Japanese warcrime unit?
I need to see what unit 731 is <:kappa:957459884138455090>
I hate mainlanders too, don't see a problem with that
I mean an eye of an eye right? : ^ )
so many mainlanders are so brainwashed it's kinda fuckin sad, hopefully covid can wake people up more on their shite and seek more information on foreign stuff
~~we should all just come together and become Earth Federation and do Gundam things~~
this probably LMAO
just give me benefits and stop the mainland from barking
politics are too much work
<:KurumiPeek:999299311026307143>
this is meme-discussion
~~how do you Kamikaze "BANZAI"(live to 10,000) if you're gonna die immediately~~
there's so many
it's just the free youtube clicks talking aboout CCP collapse lmao
._.
and then they dont master grade them?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> not following newer gundams since they started to go kid toy selling side
10 minutes where the quality fights are
for like
I enjoyed 00 movie
00 movie is really just to sell more gunpla
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673> i guess
but the movie is *better*
I enjoyed the season
voice actor for Nonna the black hair Russian actually likes Russia and studies Russian <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
last few ep of season ||Panzer driftin||
I mean they had a ||*KV-2 emerge from the ocean*|| in the movie
it's really just for tank maniacs
movie is the real deal
school starts tomorrow and *i wanna die*
*season 2*
I loved log horizon, but the animation <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
D A T A B A S E
manga is still going on
so we can get hype drops
they kept Sawano for music
im scared
but from what Log Horizon shown me ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
**DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN**


**Nanatsu no Taizai S3 changed from A1-pictures to DEEN**
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
*like forgetting to draw pants on background characters*
make sure you BD because the TV has some next level errors
big whack
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
only know Deen fucked S2 up
Log Horizon S1 was Satelight? didn't know that
new staff is a beauty
was good?
didn't watch Reconguista because design and MC
you *what*
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> Feldt from gundam 00 voiced by Ayahi
i'm gonna guess netflix because they have copyright
S3/Manga slightly on what's to come ||Next arc is Diane/King/Gowther arc + 3000 years ago history||
volume 14 doesn't even cover S2 <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
wait a *second*
it *might* be a leveling up season though
the demons are always the big threat
at least
*and you know skim through the manga because it's been a while*
let me review where S2 left off
I don't think it's side story again?
doubt it's going to be final
too tired being the good guy? :x
what happened to Exia? they did a broken at the start, and a fixed at the end right?
***SHWIING***
*I enjoyed 00 as a guilty pleasure because of how good the lightshow and particles were*
what's happening to recent Gundam
apparently iron blood orphan had a good S1 and S2 went to shit?
üëå
according to MAL
24
~~TBH Manga for demon slayer can be pushed longer~~ it isn't announced to be final arc I think
watched it while it aired so it was suffering waiting as they drag on the show for a very long time
it was a great watch back in the day
isn't SoL the way to go then?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
real weebs use Áµ∂Âî±
predict the prediction line *4Head*
just read the bullets 4Head
the man is 1337 haxxor
the man hackss
Kirito is hard work?
BGM caught me off guard tbh
I'm still here, didn't watch what y'all are discussing though
is there more than one kaguya?
~~NGNL wants a word~~
don't know how official that is though
wasn't there announcement that S2 is not confirmed yet
~~gets taken by DEEN or JC Staff and dies~~
cliffhanger for ~~season 2 that will never happen~~
I was expecting full breathing 24/7 to be end
yet it looks like they're starting another arc? ...
next episode should be last right?
*is this really gen*
i mean isnt this all you need
Jibril best girl ~~apart from movie parts~~
twas great fun
this exists, not sure if appropriate?
I did, somehow the guy made jpg file move on his site

well, i think this one should work
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
huh, gif not working
~~all i know about macross is delta's ep1~~
<:Ver:336656981144109066> they turned Nano from a ball to a cat thing
https://myanimelist.net/anime/37393/Watashi_Nouryoku_wa_Heikinchi_de_tte_Itta_yo_ne


AAAAAAAA WHAT
maybe? it's more comedy focused
sounan desu ka?
uhh *same*
good emote screencaps can be done <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
quality stuff
it's up there
if we're talking about art/animations
haven't watched it in so long though
pretty chill comedy
thats yukachi <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
first thing to catch watching ep1
read the manga a bit
Honzuki no Gekokujou
isekai CGDCT
https://myanimelist.net/anime/37393/Watashi_Nouryoku_wa_Heikinchi_de_tte_Itta_yo_ne?q=%20heikin
yeah
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>

the budget and animation is still top as always though lmao
I wonder what shitty writing will dawn upon us this season
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560> SAO is starting once again
apparently they cut a 2000 word monologue into a single scene, which made it look really dumb
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
we get people who gets killed still doing things 2 episodes later
umm, anime only, no.
all the budget and quality stuff put to a crappy story
spilled milk
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>

***WHAT ARE YOU DOING ESCANOR***
A1 did great, what the heck
I can't bring myself to like anything deen
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
white blood
deen, what have you done to nanatsu no taizai
oh ***no***
Ayahi don't do much VA work does she?
üòÇ
don't think anime went that far?
||manga only||
Derieri refuses to T-pose
:x
yeah
**L O N G H A N D S**



the demons are T-posing <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
what the fuck is this
lmao after rewatching the OP
is it really better? ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
they're changing the OP <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>


I recommend this if anyone wants to watch true hot garbage animations
https://myanimelist.net/anime/1200/Gun-dou_Musashi?q=musashi%20
*meliodas slides into the screen*
~~what fuckin normies amiright~~
~~from what I heard she is the least popular in the group~~
or even just next ep preview
might be extremely small role
MAL didn't record her in cast list ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
which show? not on  MAL
and then she talks in EP3
LMAO just as I said I don't know if Derieri is going to talk this season
time to rewatch some database
uhh
tbh Tazai S3 not sure if Derieri is even gonna get lines
l m a o
1 line <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
**Ayahi has lines!**
~~smh rito is best girl~~
yugiri got her own song ~~outside of the season~~
*i've been doing this in anime-club but does this belong in live-shitposting*?
probably the hair
*something looks off*
*I'm sorry dr.stone, but this face for a decent 2-3 second had me laughing*
tbh I read the manga for most of the show i'm watching
although I read the manga already
yeh
stopped watching at onimonogatari because 891 big sad
~~it's like how old Chinese people say ueeshou when sitting down~~
sound word...
onomatopoeia?
uhh
nope wrong term
let  me quickly google the right word
it's like adlib?
assuming the reason Genjuro can extract power from movies is because of Kazanari
world has crisis every 3 months, and nobody except for the gears have any power
good to know
which show we talkin bout
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>

XV doesn't :v
I was afraid they're gonna drop a big cliffhanger
chapter 33 is üî•
we are at chapter 24 in the anime <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Volume 1 is done though (I think) because Volume 2 starts connected
yup, it's a mess
and 2 different translation group for Chinese TLs
there's 3 different artists for the manga I think
they split arcs because the story is very long
I read manga on it and it's split between translators and authors lmao
not really though?
I like the shwing in GN drives too
in terms of quality in beam arts
~~00 is the best one~~
it's like kid version initial D in my memories
"Bakusou Kyoudai Let's & Go" anybody else watched it?
time to flip through myanimelist <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the one where they just run along the track, there was no controls whatsoever
when did that air?
ü§î I remember some show about two kids with race cars where they run with the car, I forgot the name for it
I didn't watch divers <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
build fighter try is a dumpsterfire
nichijou was this decade? I thought it was older :x

**Studio Deen**

caught up with the manga after watching 1 episode. Kotoko 10/10 MC
and then follow through the season
you're the complete opposite of me, I'll start one episode, if I like it I find the source manga and read through it]
nobody watching Hanako-kun here? :v
isn't this meme worthy?
eel chapter :v
because I don't think they will do anything after nanase
which chapter is it from?
we need mahou shoujo flamethrower
flamethrower nanase anime when
mangu spooler ||likely not becuase Kuro denies the fact||
I've heard about quality of gunpla dropping, what did they do?
<:CagliostroPout:672861874471174166>

did they pull a epic game store and exclusive deal it?
for some reason
they're the only one who took in Dororo though
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
it's like they don't actually watch anime before licensing them

I only know Anzumatsuri

aya never watched the first version?
gib full episode of just Iruma reading the manga to Ameri
and then another longer-ish arc starts
because 2 is probably enough for the next small story <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
I wish they would have cut 2 episodes of Kiriwo shit and put in the next small story
but bakarina is fun

<:niceone:310375905690255360>
what happened to ||current Ymir||
oh yeah
<:KEKW:646883441450942504>
unless they retconn|| the 13 year curse||
only really special face is jean's horse face
they could have honestly pulled a new character and do it, I didn't even notice that it's the same girl <:KEKW:646883441450942504>
fucking bullshit i tell you
oh yeah, why is ||Levi alive? Ackerman magic?||
I can't remember the details because shit's a mess
did it? it could have been anybody else because ||Sasha's relation with the family wasn't pre-established was it?||
the kid can miss her shot for all i care and everything would have played the same
it did nothing imo
like that shit isn't obvious enough already
other than just ||killing off another character||
what did it achieve
||Sasha didn't have to die||
what do you mean it had to
i will forever hate the author for something that will happen in S4
kekw
that was good
i remembered another part where they changed art style throughout the gag
the buns are the main body <:Kappa:586280887528718344>
except for the girl yelling Kyoko and tomato Kyoko
I can't remember much of Yuru Yuri
reads out all her inner thoughts
where she doesn't talk but still gets a VA
it's like senryu shoujo
yeah
~~imagine liking something with a head~~
Celty ‚ù§Ô∏è
didn't the ||other kid take jaws?||
design is so different
<:Kappa:586280887528718344>
bible has seasons?
its 46 episodes, mekakucity was 1 day and it developed character
a bit late to develop a main character 3 seasons in huh
railgun>index, index has too much mechanics :v
well then the fucking anime sucks ass then
so it's durarara except one of them is a blank slate until season fucking 3
how about actually having a main character that has personality lead for abit, doesn't help that index is a fucking bite machine
doesn't mean that touman can't get background
I don't remember accel appearing much S1
are we getting boruble soon then
but bunny girl has <:TomosatoSalute:688199574749446203><:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<a:partyblob:527654424718475266> feesh
wao, I thought it was undecided when it's gonna air again
I am watching bookworm and hamefura btw
i want üêü
when will teibou nisshi return
**where are all my fluff shows?**
and I thought we don't have shit this season
went to look at summer list, big yikes
yikes
depends on where you are <:Kappa:586280887528718344>
i like the aesthetic design, not the character tho
should be
just sail seas
but railgun can stand alone
index is main, railgun is spinoff
I only know nana did rosario OP
you can't say toaru, everything starts with toaru <:Kappa:586280887528718344>
the anime was so fucked, high school me can get bored and fall asleep
whether novel or manga, whichever one does fine
tbh stop pointing them to index anime, if you want to, point them to source
~~you can watch railgun without index and understand it perfectly fine~~
ok buddy if we're talking about non-linear masterpieces, baccano (although I didn't watch it), and durara
<:kekw:632722830802550784> JC staff
more fripside is always better imo <:KEKW:646883441450942504>
I prefer railgun over index because anime only
didn't finish accel anime
manga, same artist with dagashikashi?
yofukashi no uta
~~it's a hideyoshi~~
<a:angershake:693662614504472627>
3-gatsu is underwatched
i need it right in my veins
yo where's my seasonal fluff shit
just finished comic girls in one sitting
railgun OVA got it's own OP :v
üëè
railgun finales are always pretty nice
makes sense once you hear him laugh in accelerator lul
apparently according to reddito
accelerator's va got vocal cord surgery recently
shirai style judgement from everyone was <:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>
doga kobo does the good stuff
bookwerm S3 confirm when
Bakarina S2 2021?
<a:angershake:693662614504472627>

I rewatched sora no woto
after Ikxi posting screencaps
i only watched the anime ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
and not playing civ
reincarnated as slime but spider
still makes me tear up if I go back to watch it
3-gatsu S2 both main arcs are so good
it gives you depression while making you happy
3-gatsu good, go watch
<a:memetori2:713324940740395110>

I'd put Re:zero slightly higher than SAO
there's nothing this season <:Kappa:586280887528718344>
gib me more Klein
we need more Klein time
is it good? no :v
is it better than before? yes
cause apparently first part Alicization for Eugeo Kirito they cut out 1000+ words of inner dialogue
did you source material
look I enjoyed the animation, but the storytelling is still hot fucking garbage

after comparing trash to trash
you can't say something is good
the anime storytelling is still trash
you can say the novel is good
no, it's not good.
yes
animation is still good
it's still rapey trash
no
Klein>Kirito, jus sayin

best waifu drops in
ED is Aoi Eir
is this SAO

it's so weird having Chinese voice on anything animated :v
it's in Chinese and I hate it
twas okay
don't remember which one
I watched one of the imas
I only thought of, "no way I'm gonna binge this anime" to binge it anyways
not really
~~other than the fact that the manga is slow or nobody is TL-ing it~~
demi-chan is great
what it be
I didn't watch the trailer
manga went on hiatus because artist's health
probably a novel
ep 1 ||kill revive bully in the manga was absolutely great too||
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and I like it
misfit is just a meme trip on how the MC is broken OP
they pulled a good anime original
White and Black is anime original <:Kappa:586280887528718344>
yo that means fast n furious is a mecha movie
initial D is a mecha?
I haven't seen much Ver talk in a while, maybe I'm not active enough ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I think we have a general hidden rule of just ignore Ver convos
~~just get nitro and~~ <:KEKW:646883441450942504>
Keijo is a meme, and it's fucking great
~~rich people is just gonna pull it from other servers~~
it gone downwards a bit after XV, it's fine now imo
my friend was a three episode guy and he hated steins gate, until i forced him to complete it
a lot of good shows can have garbage three episodes
tbh Gargantia's take away points are the later half of the show, I honestly don't remember anything from the first half
and all of that while a ||AI writes sex over and over again||
if you want to watch it for the train wreck, go ahead. it's hot garbage
I watched episode 1 of flip flappers when it was airing, and then I thought "I don't wanna use my brain *or* get mindfucked, no thanks"
~~so you have a PS4 gathering dust~~ got it
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
is worth?
what is Princess Principal, i never picked it up
GX is low point until a certain somebody starts singing
OP EDs are pretty nice too for valvrave <:Kappa:586280887528718344>
they skipped the best background dialogue
<a:KEKWW:641325640380973067>

find it real quick
let me
they skipped the best part of the manga for the newest episode <a:angershake:693662614504472627>
misfit maou this season
so uhh
imma send blades to type moon
Illya better not suffer in her own fucking spinoff
<a:angershake:693662614504472627>
*fucking shero takes over main again?*
*Illya is marked supporting*
and i checked MAL for the movie
so uhh I started Illya spinoff

I still play with my camera for effects
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I read raws at a snail pace right now <:Kappa:586280887528718344>
I mean a camera camera is gonna be better than a camera on a phone, but the quality difference is reducing over the years
<:Kurisu_Thumbs_Up:593528229395169281>

*sigh*
> Kira Yamato is my son and I‚Äôm adopting him
it's just color changing shenanigans

Seed's writing isn't that great either
I mean
btw Seed Destiny spoilers ||fuck Kira for literally ignoring Shin and charge towards Stella and killing her||
<:KirikaSadQuiet:699748089933856842>
Stella is good, apart from her ||mental instability||
I mean it's new and I'm okay with it, but I've seen people who hated it
Turn A is really good, if you can deal with the mustache gundam <a:KEKWW:641325640380973067>
*sad solar drive schwing noises*

watch destiny
well

why did healer get chosen to be animated <:Kappa:586280887528718344>
<https://mangadex.org/title/34404/fukushuu-o-koinegau-saikyou-yuusha-wa-yami-no-chikara-de-senmetsu-musou-suru>
is a better revenge guilty pleasure than healer
if you don't like it just don't watch it, there's like a million good sequels next season lulw
I don't twitter so i honestly don't care
<a:popcornparrot:685708422079053897>
if you want to know the hissy fit on twitter, I dont know.
if you want to know about the series itself? it's revenge porn, actual revenge porn
nothing announced so probably not any time soon
less porn more asshole killing
you'll probably enjoy it
eh, if you go the time, read <https://mangadex.org/title/34404/fukushuu-o-koinegau-saikyou-yuusha-wa-yami-no-chikara-de-senmetsu-musou-suru>
oh no, mans into revenge porn
<a:xdd:558152091516796948>
and then commit atrocious acts on everyone else who didn't wrong him
shield hero actually has some redeeming qualities kekw
worse as in being a dick to everyone else worse
vengeful hero > redo healer 
any day, cause you know how much of a cunt everyone is more than redo healer's
<a:meme_tori2:713324940740395110>
it got reboot into an actual series
https://mangadex.org/title/56541/unparalleled-mememori-kun
watch it, nuff said
after rewatching the CM, I noticed something.
<:Kappa:586280887528718344>
even on the old color pages
she was black hair for the manga
||fumino best girl, nobody can convince me otherwise||
btw how did higurashi remake go?
I didn't watch it, I know it's fuckin out of the norm though
<a:KEKWW:641325640380973067>
AKU NO HANA
death march has Aoi so there's that for the anime
it's good but bad at the same time
death march is just weird
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
if you want world building, go ahead, expect absolutely no story at all
Spring be good
**Nagatoro in spring**
**Iruma S2 is Spring** <:POG:668557280215564298>
no more database <a:Pepe_Cry1:650636933365760021>
it's never going to end kekw
finish hunter x hunter on anime and don't read the manga
next season is big for sequels <:Kappa:586280887528718344>
semi-long running series, it's own powers and MC ain't really OP for shounen. good world building too
yeah, S1's animation was pretty scuffed
I don't remember where they ended S1
Jan 10 episode 1 world trigger S2
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
is world trigger out of the norm? it's pretty good

I immediately swapped back to English kekw
English is fine, just not Chinese
<a:xdd:558152091516796948>
just don't speak any Chinese because people will actually take a step away from you
If you know a bit of Japanese you're fine

||Anti returns|| <a:PartyGlasses:495445850059833345>
at least best girl's song were both 2D for both seasons <:Kanaheh:662121751471325187>
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
why can't zombieland saga get better CG
"you couldn't really go worse than s1", there's always overlord S3 CG
there's post credit after this episode btw
and during Chise's frame, gridknight is added after
during the character panning this is added
they're also added into the opening
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
album specific song from season 1 is gon get used?
next episode is called saga jihen part 1
Saki is getting her own tamagochi? <:Kappa:586280887528718344>
i guess I did a shitty wording
I worded it as gridman -> dynazenon but aight?
SSSS.Dynazenon, pre-quel-ish thing is SSSS.Gridman
anti and 2nd is added to the poster on the official website
language hard
<:Kappa:586280887528718344>
and then there's the tokusatsu gridman
there's a same universe not-exactly-prequel called SSSS.Gridman
https://myanimelist.net/anime/40870/SSSSDynazenon?q=dynazenon&cat=anime
SSSS.Dynazenon
name of the show, yes
if the show>SSSS.Dynazenon
what's what?
knight sitting behind yomogi kekw

the only thing I was looking for after the episode on reddit for dyna is
<:Kappa:586280887528718344>
I'm gonna stay on my CN manga site for a bit kekw
it's so scuffed
the best Christmas movie
the long hair was brit
ah yes
I haven't watched in a million years
was she not Italian
<:ShitEatingCatto:508847449906085908>
Italian best girl <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
biggest log of the century
not really?
<a:KappaPrideRGB:596432706649325677>
terra had banger OPs too
<:15min:495770478678638593>
why does all the shitty shows have nice OPs
the OP made it look so interesting and it led nowhere
what the fuck was divine gate about anyways
oh my god
lmao
plot is an absolute shitshow
yeah, openings are real nice
oh
thoughts on valvrave?
since we're on the topic of shitty shows
actually don't remember anything about them
new girls what?
I don't even remember S2 because of how little shit I gave it
I've only heard about it, was it scuffed/rushed ending? for juuni
I only know musashi because of a bilibili uploader
quality animation
quality
||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EohpXyhe5o&ab_channel=sake2006||
do you guys wanna see some cursed shit that aired at  the same time of code geass S1?
arifureta anime is so scuffed
hey, on the topic of shitty animation, arifureta <a:KEKWW:641325640380973067>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
no but osananajimi dude
I mean the animation was shit too right?
KEKW
I watched a bilibili memeish review on that
that
oh]
I never actually watched through haganai because the first few episodes didn't interest me
it started with IS, I mentioned valv later since I wanted cypher's opinion, yet he never watched it <a:KappaPrideRGB:596432706649325677>
I like my romance
Dynazenon is a better romance anime
no dynazenon? :c
I'll think about it
suffering is bad <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
time to wait it out a binge at the end <:15min:495770478678638593>
aquatope is 24 episodes?
slime season 2 part 2 <:shruggu:506552611269246986>
Tsuki ga michibiku isekai douchuu is nice
<:AoiDisgust:413907861198995458>
this is the outfit they opted for the dragon fight


this was skipped
and went for a very male disguise
because they didn't use that outfit
outside the city while being a teacher
it's from the outfit change when he fights the thunder dragon
<:Sadge:735758654531436645>
the anime did such a sad job here
this outfit got butchered in the anime

I can post the most disappointing thing from the anime compared to manga
interested? <:15min:495770478678638593>
tensura anime is worse than the manga though, because of the severe lack of rimuru dressups
if I want fanservice I'll go to some other websites <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
world building is better than fanservice spamming
it's all exposition
it's that time I got reincarnated into a slime to play civ 5
<:UnYes:552969576145616897>
zenitsu is just manga chapter ||145||
hanakana <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ponta is so much more green than I expected
I don't get why people think fuka arc is good <:15min:495770478678638593>
don't know about you but I like my anime with a shitty twist happy ending than the full depresso expresso experience
I am the manga reader and I always thought ponta was going to be brown dog colored
both
ponta very green
gundaminfo has the whole gundam 00 movie up
<a:KappaPrideRGB:596432706649325677>
VLC media player?

kekw
no, even longer than half a year worth of chapters
<:15min:495770478678638593>
the last 6 episode was the span of like half a year worth of chapters
I mean if you're a manga reader

also disappointed that they didn't do wardrobe change at the end of the episode
<:15min:495770478678638593>
I'm not even sure if there's action next ep

why is it called Fena
https://tenor.com/view/maes-b-lost-in-a-field-pulp-fiction-john-travolta-gif-14829328
but lighthearted adventure show where
and immediately threw them all into the background and ignored most of it right after the plot relevance?
they made symphogear
the fuck do you mean
more lighthearted adventure show
douki is good indeed
there's still tawawa and douki this season ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
<:NadeBlanket:585544402471092364>
senpai ga uzai first end card is from douki's manga artist <a:KappaPrideRGB:596432706649325677>

taishou otome I read the manga for
senpai ga uzai is full 20min

imagine getting bored of cute shows
right, I missed the conversation, but how did you guys let them get off with just a slap on the wrist for saying mamoru is a bad VA
anos manga cancelled

it's what happens when you give a sequel to deen
reconguista designs are the real suck
imagine saying any of the original designs suck

<:what:743345298738511873>
theres fate other than prisma illya?

the manga is good
and then there's studio deen which takes sequels and fucking murder them
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
https://youtu.be/a4bSbmqwhso
S1 was just manga in my head
i read the manga so
I summon Cypher to boast world trigger good show
~~w o r l d  t r i g g e r~~
what have you unleashed onto this world
Nothing wrong with the second half
since the cover literally has the title on it
probably
but its def the same series
illust looks very different
I'm not too sure if the manga is the same artist
<a:TohruStronkest:607393194141024287>
just learn moonrunes and find it yourself
https://mangadex.org/title/125a4bc0-500b-4aaf-9299-e3aa44d0fd38/tanaka-the-wizard?tab=chapters
there's more split on whether dynazenon or gridman is better here <a:KappaPrideRGB:596432706649325677>
but yomoxyume cute
~~I like dynazenon over gridman though~~
The ending was a bit strange but that‚Äôs all
Gwyn be chewing through dynazenon quick tho
It is covered
Manga reader? <a:KappaPrideRGB:596432706649325677>
from what I've heard, ||redo is his controversy money making, and finest assassin is what he actually wants to write||

you can ship everyone with Chris so that's kind of harem? ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
index bad, magic boring
<:ShirabeSleep:691497302535176302>
religion talk and exposition in index is big <:ShirabeSleep:691497302535176302>
the only thing that stood out is Saten having a broken arm in T <:Kapp:661023855854223364>
it's done well enough that it doesnt feel like I missed anything
^
I've watched a bilibili guy talk about it, apparently there's a few scenes that shows budget cuts <:Kapp:661023855854223364>
slime is slime, there is no gender
<:Kapp:661023855854223364>
that whole part is skipped
and they go into dungeons before the tournament
oh
and manga principal looks better imo
<:Sadge:735758654531436645>
ruri and alma is supposed to take down the two people and make it 1v1 for matthias
the tournament is supposed to be 3v3
they skipped the childhood and teaching magic to ruri and alma
they went over 7 chapters of the manga, which are around 40 pages each
bisque probably best show this season <:kappa:743344568291950663>
but then they added a unneeded prologue and did a neverland ending
I looked forward to it being animated
kenja no deshi ep1 has been trashed <:Sadge:735758654531436645>
kenja no deshi and shikkakumon kenja both got butchered so hard
<:Wheeze:581253400381882368>
I was about to say there's more than 2 isekai, then i remembered shikkakumon is same world reincarnation
first time watcher?
bisque is too good <:kappa:743344568291950663>
yanagihara is cool old man
S2 arc 1 and arc 2 is just a binge
yes
be sure to watch through both seasons
3-gatsu good show
all I remember is opening good
that stuff is so old I can't remember anything from it <:kappa:743344568291950663>
Yuri on Ice year?

<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
fish guts this episode (3)
right, if we're gonna pick absolute wordings let me rephrase. fuck, spell her name more conventionally
I mean if you bring Yuki and go around asking people how to phonetically pronounce it, most people will not end up Yuuki
you just gave me a lot of shit to read
yes but it's not the most common romanization?
except ÊÇ† is read Yuu
is it not yuuki
spell her name right please
fuck
>Yuki Aoi
in recent gundams they've been making everything slimmer and slimmer, it's good to see some chonk every now and again <:kappa:743344568291950663>

slime gets best fantasy over mushoku
lmao crunchyroll awards are out and they're ü§°  as usual
<:Wheeze:581253400381882368>
CR awards is a joke, mushoku not winning fantasy while slime wins it when slime's adaptation was kinda shit
that was cool a/f
OP2 had the rough painting animation too right?
animation 10/10
ost 10/10
episode 40 chapter 81 burnt field part 3
because S2 is a rollercoaster
my favorite is in S2

<:KanaHide:960902270080389121>
question is, are they gonna change studio again? <:kappa:957459884138455090>
I didn't know they animated the dance by itself <:kappa:957459884138455090>
it looks like the anime is gonna cover the side story that got turned into a spinoff for the manga
its good tho
<:Sadge:735758654531436645>
valvrave is just a train wreck in nearly every direction lmao

ED was made before the manga was even a thing
gigguk bad
found out there's <:Elfnein:231434633357688833> in there
started catching up to lycorico
why
fuckers use Chinese in the title
oh
anything made in China is "going to change the industry"
~~must be Chinese~~
did they actually say that?
like ishuzoku reviewer
also going to have a NSFW version apparently
I think they forgot the part that majority weebs sail the high seas
https://files.catbox.moe/zrh2qe.mp4
most of them don't even benefit much for the original creator of whatever you're subscribing for so why even

who the fuck is jennifer
if you dig around hard enough kekw
I mean some of them are good
: ^ )
don't get the mentality because TLs usually get shit on by the public nowadays because rushed work and no high quality stuff like old fansubs
become indie reject industry
at that point just take their time to make fansubs or something if they don't need the pay :  ^ )
bruh
I don't get why the TLs even do the job if it pays like ass
<:Wheeze:581253400381882368>
don't CR usually boast about helping the industry
yeah, so I'm gonna stick with sailing the high seas and buying merch instead
<:kappa:957459884138455090>
dont' say akane
but the cast
<:Sadge:735758654531436645>
just like the Yuru camp movie
just means +6 months
it's like g gundam <:Wheeze:581253400381882368>
I watched through the whole thing
I mean I didn't like the try cast
||no, I don't care about Meijin||
why even watch any build fighters if the first season cast isn't around
tbh try started downhill
: ^ )
what's a gundam build divers
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

but I've only heard bad shit about divers lmao
<:KurumiPeek:999299311026307143>
divers I only heard about bad stuff so I never started
I mean GBF is good, but I don't see the point of them making it 3v3 and less invested in characters
the Jojo pose Yamori is the highlight of that scene
I think I saw gundam igloo? too bad reddit player stopped working <:KEKW:796426664622948392>
what's happening here, Cypher trying to justify how garbage index anime is again? <:kappa:957459884138455090>
<a:partyblob:527654424718475266>
shoujo anime second season
https://youtu.be/VCstkLIXft8
it's okay, Chisato will call upon Goldburn while Takina gets DynaWing and everything will become tokusatsu and be fine  : ^ )
movie lock everything <:KEKW:796426664622948392>
looks like it
where is this, twitter fanboys? <:Wheeze:581253400381882368>
<:4Head:668046230223323136>
that's why sword isekai is better, just kill the trader
if free trial requires payment method, it's not free unless you grab what you want and fucking book it immediately
not watching day 1
<:ShitEatingCatto:508847449906085908>
just means sailing the high seas for ep1
streaming for what platform, youtube only?
new eyecatch has more gay, why not I guess?
same, for today
ez
learn moonrunes
turn subs off
it's not?
<:Sadge:735758654531436645>
hopefully it's actually ED slapped with OP on it
üëÄ
they're actually gay
it's CN sub
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
what do you mean JP millhi


it's not though
<:thumbsup:535558767794978816>
just watch on youtube
he did turn A right?
: ^ )
it's like a coinflip
watch it become valvrave 2 <:kappa:957459884138455090> because witch shenanigans
<a:partyblob:527654424718475266>
which ones though
if they're gonna crank the innovation lever, might as well crank it all the way right?
<:Sadge:735758654531436645>
<a:partyblob:527654424718475266>
oooooooor learn mooonrunes!
the industry's track record for following through ain't too good <:ShitEatingCatto:508847449906085908>
good ep1, ~~please follow through on gay~~
well it's called a trainer
<:KEKW:796426664622948392> ?
so
never watched utena though
many similarities
same director this time
yes.
anime original baby, off the lycoris train, on to the G-Witch train
<:KEKW:796426664622948392>
or twilight axis if that is even floating around
I watched someone go over zeta movie and he was pointing out, why the fuck is the reunion of amuro and char look so romantic in the sunset
I thought Unicorn had more of an everyone did disgusting things but aight
now bet on where they drop it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
by sacrificing a Graham cracker after beaming someone?
<:ShitEatingCatto:508847449906085908>
I mean what other war drama is there? if it's not boots on the ground it is politics 24/7 no?
S1 Fine slapping miku maybe?
at 5:20 AM
I will now go to bed
yes
gundam seed destiny but shinn actually stays protagonist remake when
what was the reason why they didn't leave at the first place of safety again? or did they just not find any
~~I mean putting a teen boyo to pilot a mech isn't too ethical is it~~
doesn't this answer the argument lmao
I still don't get this argument, if we're arguing whether or not EF was corrupt in 79
too many points are being pulled, what was the main argument again? <:kappa:957459884138455090>
I don't, isn't thunderbolt also on a cliffhanger <:kappa:957459884138455090>
I also enjoy Hathaway, but do we even have a single hint that the second movie is even in production?
: ^ )
he's an everybody
well then lets rephrase it
isn't Kou's point to be nothing exceptional because he was a nobody?
~~my first interaction with Kamille was niconico shitpost my cousin showed me~~
<a:partyblob:527654424718475266>
retcon retcon
<a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>
~~3 movies~~
50
the point was that they had their reasons but their action was shit?
right, but Cypher never argued that Zeon's action was good?
I mean it doesn't make EF any more good people?
shooting is harder than it looks
hey man
~~I love how the majority of the server is watching Gwitch~~
Gundam do be dreadful sometimes
||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If2ZWpWPeZw|| JP prologue credits
international broadcast was just black screen credits, but the JP one was credits ||inside Granny's room scrolling through pictures of GUND||
btw the prologue ending for JP stream version apparently have different ending visuals
I'm assuming he's at the pretty candles : ^ )
<a:BoredParrot:646979639117348884>
we also have two lacus in the very cursed seed series
~~close enough~~
show of hands those who let their friends order for them if they aren't going out alone?
ikr
I literally did what Suletta did ep1 today, went to Pizza hut and stuttered like an idiot
speaking is fucking hard
relatable
hey man
~~she's cute so all is well~~
<:Wheeze:581253400381882368>
I'd watch
4 year old newtype, gets Rita's level of understanding and becomes tired of the world
<a:meme_tori8:729293392835772486>
episode 1 is where they put the G in G Witch
there is only pain
you finished XV
ofc you are
considering that she said in episode 1 that ||they grown up together, yes||
what other gundam have you watched? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
now yam can see this "detail" <:kappa:957459884138455090>
~~shoulda just killed him, like what a true gundam do~~
<a:partyblob:527654424718475266>
pink

we've seen in the prologue that the Lfrith cockpit is pretty big, so ||there isn't a reason why Miorine should be sitting on Suletta here other than yuribait : ^ )||
the next screencap is later on ep1 so yam don't click
by the way
I just want another Graham Aker but it seems like we won't be getting that <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and people will say it's decent/good quality
00 can be aired today
kill Jesus and claim your throne
it is time for you to shine
Shinn my true protagonist
<:POGGERS:426483567833382912>
<:Prayge:858997817992282162>
are they gonna rewrite destiny
there's a Jesus in seed because he never fucking dies
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
all they needed to do was kill Jesus
destiny could have been good
watch Gundam 00, ~~I'm totally not biased because I like GN drive schwiing and that I simp for Graham~~
build fighters is good if you don't want **suffering**
I think build fighters S1 is also a decent starting point?
G Gundam is a shounen action anime except they added gundam in it
nobody know what that is talking about
ah, G reconguista should also be skipped
I enjoyed S2 for what it is : ^ )
00 is good for something that is more than a decade old
we don't know your taste other than GWitch and Symphogear lmao
fight me
setsuna x exia is the real ship
none has true yuri and gay
you can choose to jump into the main UC timeline or go all standalone timeline
<:Wheeze:581253400381882368>
oh yeah, victory exists
because age is game
and age
the only true trash is seed
they're nearly all pretty good tbh
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/582189580904824836/1022359905446928444/KoVGhk8.gif
~~time to watch all of Gundam?~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
barakamon is children done good
~~it doesn't have gay, your taste bad~~
~~sword art online is definitely not a must watch anime~~
approx 4 regular seasons
and make him do Jesus shit and never die
I just hate the fact that they just make Jesus do every stupid shit and frame it as right
<:ShitEatingCatto:508847449906085908>
seed
wasn't there news that it's going to be split cour with hathaway thunderbolt and narrative being aired on TV in between the cours?
all Lacus does is preach and pull tech out her ass though?
kekw?
I see three who's four
lmao ok
because I surely can't fucking remember over the shitty writing of Jesus
what would you say the important part of seed is
both seed and destiny's part 2 is quite fucking garbage because it's just Kira beaming everyone no brain though. you enjoy that shit?
yes, because it's so insignificantly early on that you'd forget it. And that he gets so ridiculously overpowered that he can do it without thinking twice
unlike some fucking jesus
because he actually suffered consequences of his action
I sure as hell enjoyed Banagher better than Kira : ^ )
he's literally born to be better than everyone else day 1 and gets power because the plot needs him to?
yes and I hated it
bruh Kira is just about as garbage of a writing and maybe even worse
which is where the series gone to shit because Kira took over?
"whoops Jesus is here, time to be the antagonist Shinn. Athrun, go on ahead and do your running away from ZAFT thing again"
he got thrown under the bus so hard
~~the best G-witch kit display is the one filled with guntank~~
but it's good
not required
<:KEKW:796426664622948392>
uploading the same thing in two different channels
the preview image changed(?) or is this a different channel
just friends
||what do you mean, Suletta started at 4 <:4HEad:826962686053974026> ||
what do you mean Setsuna was fine, his first girl ||Exia was hurt so bad at the end of S1 and start of S2 <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000> ||
Your favorite part of Gundam x
Ah yes
Just a out of nowhere thing
Garrod sounds so old for what he looks like imo <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And Kamille joins titans for no reason
And then Amuro becomes MC
It's like having Kamille as Mc for the first half of Zeta
Like bruh the fuck is that
I'm still salty that he suddenly become protag when Shinn was protag for half the season
It's bullshit
Everything can be sniped without killing anyone
There is no risk for Jesus
Well that's kind of my point for hating SEED and destiny
||Aerial wa date janai||
<@87512939107450880> your favorite kind of display, all Zaku main
Trauma Team is peak American health care system
yeah because they can't retcon <:pain:621173675651104768>
he does?
well I'll enjoy ||slicing his fucking head off|| with my re-playthrough that I started recently
edgerunner is pain
ugh
the whole point of 2077 is that Dex says ||you either go out a legend or die a nobody, yet David is barely in 2077||
like
why
finished edgerunners

in voice only though
wakako appeared as well
I'm not even half way through the game
<:15min:495770478678638593>
so, I got T-poses in the tutorial, missing audio dialogue in one of the side quests, animation lagging behind and more T-posing with the aldecaldo side/main quest
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
technically 4 because the afterlife bartender is the same girl?
release: when it is ready
> narrator: they weren't ready
~~not in build fighters~~
~~it's Spacians this time around~~
~~for one chapter and then he's off to mahjong land again~~
modern day story writing üëè üëè
<:KEKL:753304023016276100>
I don't know any context all I know is shock value without context
well
~~eh, just enjoy Fran being cute~~
<:KEKL:753304023016276100>
||her mom's clone ofc, like all the other literal char clones that actually exist in UC||
<:kappa:957459884138455090>
we don't even have movie BD
season 3 yuru camp?
now we just have to wait for the end of the ||harvest festival|| for the next big thing
I'm living in an Asian country and I am doing the <a:PirateParrot:646979642200293406>
~~always~~
yes.
they also threw away the best OP <:ShitEatingCatto:508847449906085908>
take that what you will
it goes from satelight S1 to DEEN S2 and S3
<:KEKL:753304023016276100>
Gundam also got yoasobi
don't really care too much about the show, but bump of chicken OP is bopping good
bump of chicken is good though
~~manga is probably better because pacing by reading is probably faster~~
nobody talking about bump of chicken OP for spyxfamily?
<a:BoredParrot:646979639117348884>
~~but iino is best girl~~
||she went travelling around the world, her final chapter is a future chapter where she returns to go drinking with them||
||shirogane kaguya is together, both going to stanford, with shirogane going one year early by skipping grades, iino/ishigami becomes just like early day shirogane/kaguya. Maki ends on nothing but says that her partner will come in the future, fujiwara had a chance to be with some guy but kaguya stopped her||
yeah, it said X story ends here for now for the main series for some chapters
a few relations are kept open, that's it
I just want to see them happy together, is it too hard to ask

the only thing I hate is that ||iino and ishi didn't get together and just got into standstill like early days kaguya/shirogane ||
<a:Clap:512324755525730319>
kaguya manga ended
~~the subs also didn't say damn straight~~
they ruined the meme manga page though
pretty sure giant fucking axe didn't make it into the anime
16 seconds in
https://youtu.be/0CJeDetA45Q?t=16

why does it have so much quality
bocchi good show

I do this too, except it's usually a convenient store for microwave food because there's no mcd nearby
:v
Shaddiq is Grassley or something
Shin sei is Suletta's mom's company tho
they really named their first daughter one and second daughter two
watching bocchi 7
~~Iski is so American they've never seen a city tram~~

bocchi because relatable
bocchi is good
~~yes, we know bob will win them all~~
alright, S2 announcement where
kekw
EN TL is not caught up
oh
finished bocchi ||why even live anymore, there's no S2 announcement, there's not enough manga for S2||
<a:DESSSSSSS:642227618472656906>
where's my S2 bocchi announcement
kind of? but also not really?
she doesn't (manga)||bring the big mirror in after watching him change|| and instead (anime)||the mirror was in the room already after day 1 and she was just peeking through the door while he's posing||
they made Mihari less of a stalker though
ep1 covers CH1-3
I love it
second half is less so, but still straight to jail
first half of the episode is straight to jail
op and ed is straight to jail
the quality is good
where the fuck?
magirevo pre-air isn't on nyaa
ok
ah
actually, do DM where you get it from, I do wish to expand my sources
its fine, I can no sub or chinese sub
both magirevo and oshimai
seems like there's no eng sub for any pre-air
lets gooo straight to jail baby
well, you just convinced me to torrent the pre-air <:Wheeze:581253400381882368>
looks like onii chan wa oshimai also has a pre-air episode
endless walts is a christmas movie after all
~~broadcast delayed due to video segments ordered from China not being delivered because artist got arrested for protesting~~ ||I do not have sauce, this is a joke||

yurishallconquertheworld.jpg
everyone is gonna drop the show for being degen ep1 as they tone it down for the rest of the show
<a:KEKLEO:790369368257200159>
yes to this extent, you just aren't looking the right places
why stop at studio bind, a lot of artist in the industry is questionable in western standards kekw

now everyone can go to jail!
onimai episode 1 is officially out
(w)h(it)e fox close enough
it's just reLIFE without all the contracts and signatures : ^ )
people are getting mad about mihari drugging him without consent kekw
<:Wheeze:581253400381882368>
and then never opened the game again
and thought I'll do this some other time
and then I thought about how it's probably going to be actually the same thing until the first ending
I thought about not using it and then I looked at the damage
it got boring after you do it a shit ton of times
<:Wheeze:581253400381882368>
<:ShitEatingCatto:508847449906085908>
yes it is, me no like hacking mechanics
but the 9S loop is so painful
man they're just taking the game and pasting it aren't they
I only played through the first loop and half way through the 9S loop
watched nier anime
it's okay, there's a new loli in the opening
<a:DESSSSSSS:642227618472656906>
Yes, more screen time for them please. 
There was more screen time for them than expected on S2E1
<:KEKW:796426664622948392> nobody watches kyoani boys sports because of FREE being too fujo bait
anyone else watching tsurune for kyoani quality?

onimai 4
ayakashi triangle or something :x
wonder if they'll do suletta forgetta
yeah, but none of the other silver bullets have it right?
isn't the replacement limbs specifically for banagher lmao
who's J J Abrams though, I don't Western media, wikipedia says he worked on the more recent star wars but didn't people not like those?
was I right? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

it's been too long so I'm not too sure
my guess
https://myanimelist.net/anime/16353/Love_Lab?q=love%20lab&cat=anime
so if you're bad, go ahead
false, if you read the Japanese it says good kids should not try this at home
did gunevo fix anything I used to complain about? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
: ^ )
the sole purpose of the palm blaster is so that he can blast Athrun's gouf whip
also, one of the top comments on youtube on seed destiny cover from the youtube guy was "thus, a world where only Shin got hurt was created"
üëç
from perfectly fine destiny, and taking a kick from infinite justice to the leg makes the wing and everything else break
and the more I see on seed destiny the more I hate it, went back to e49 and Destiny loses to a kick from infinite justice, what the fuck
a youtuber that covers gundam stories are doing seed and seed/destiny
so
I haven't caught up, too busy playing shitty games like ghost recon breakpoint and malding at seed destiny's writing and how anyone can support kira
10/10 seed writing baby
I was thinking on how to explain the nickname, the reason why wolf is traitor is because the Chinese version of the party game Mafia, the Mafia is called wolves (werewolves) instead
so it's hey, look at seed, they threw out exact copies of it and gave it to civilians? lmao?
lmao what the fuck
junker man got good music though
I never read or watched any Astray, but from the games it feels like Astray is just G gundam but bad
but it's new manga, gotta be canon right? kekl
there's also gundam seed eclipse and apparently orb is doing even more illegal shit behind the scenes lmao
Athrun did betray each army twice kekl
also most comments are saying nothing is set in stone apart from Kira and wolf(traitor, Athrun) getting new suits
don't ask me, seed writers are fucking weird man
can't be assed to read shitty lighting 360p magazines
this link has shitty photos of the actual text on the magazine so it's probably somewhat correct : ^ )
I'm ready for Shin to be cucked agaain
lmao

Chinese transcript of the interview
https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv12336889?from=search
https://youtu.be/Qbh3RIkVi7c
this is the video where I took my information from, the guy digs up old magazine just to prove his points a lot of the time so I trust this source
duel v2?
have parts purge mechanics
wew
adding more wings to freedom and adding transformation to wings
don't have source because magazine lmao
well, the information I got is from someone who talked about an interview on Gundam Ace magazines back in 2021
shit was scrapped probably
I said that the writer said that there was once a plot point on kira's clones being antagonists
I didn't say any details on the plot did I
staff can definitely write a shitshow again kekl
it's also only what the writer wants for shin to be main
nobody translate shit from those stuff
it's all from interviews and magazines
gotta sell more kits
there's also confirmation on new design freedom and justice
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
and that there WAS plans on making clones of Kira be the antagonist LMAO
also apparently the seed/destiny movie will have main cast return and focus on Shin
will do soon
but you did just convince me to catch up
I don't know, shut down the fucking particle accelerator or what the name is
yes, and her stupidity is not telling Zaft that she's taking over and a search is happening, maybe if she did shit fuck would be caught huh
I mean they attacked more of Zaft units than alliance units from what I remember
after kidnapping Orb officials, attacking civilian airports, supporting war criminals while spouting that they want peace
all of them literally live happily ever after
even if Orb isn't riddled with warcrimes, isn't Archangel crew riddled with it then
do they not belong to Orb because Cagalli is a part of archangel crew
and if you think about it, everyone Kira "disables" are being mentally tortured because they have no way to survive unless picked up by friendlies
Kira attacks an airport because Meer was there and he was mad about it
it is in CE when it was made was it not
corruption of officials creating Akatsuki and hiding it's bullshit tech
Orb was also riddled with warcrime, you're not gonna blame them?
~~fuckin America did it too~~
except they had intel and actual photographs?
and yet what  bad did they really do
and then kira comes in and fights zaft because cagalli is crying
how was zaft not the good guys of destiny, they tried to prevent conflict and got stabbed in the back multiple times
how the hell is real Lacus taking over ZAFT not dictatorial
or was it another writer for Seed
I'm sorry but Fukuda literally says opt in Destiny plan would save CE
go and rewatch seed destiny and tell me team Kira is the good guys lmao
what did lacus do, sit in an orphanage and stealing shit from ZAFT
so war doesn't happen like Seed where it's coordinator vs naturals again
did I talk about Meer yet>? she's literally used to make peace and calm the people in the plants down
good guys?
they were protecting a country who refuse to hand over a war criminal leading multiple plants getting lazered
so Zaft decided to go for Orb to kill him
Jibril got taken in by Orb at around episode 40
they did?
even if Durandal was so bad, why the fuck is team Kira sending Jibril up to space protecting orb a good thing
Fukuda said that the assassin's team lead were the ones who decided to go for lacus
did Durandal have most control in the army? yes, did he send assassins to Lacus, nobody knows, but the booklets said no
lacus can totally go up there and debate shit lmao
authoritative regime? Zaft and plants has a congress did it not
they're all stolen tech from Zaft stated in gunpla booklets
how the fuck did they make Strike Freedom and Infinite Justice
how the fuck did Freedom get fixed
also, lacus literally stole Zaft army resources
he literally didn't know where lacus was
he was also shocked at real lacus being in orb later on
and durandal was too busy to give a shit at the time helping the disaster relief
there's also booklets saying the assassins for lacus at the start of seed destiny was not from durandal
except he didn't
stated in settings booklets
yes, and the plan was supposed to be opt in
team kira literally protected a war criminal
how does it not
if lacus says durandal is questionable even though everything he says makes sense, she must be right
we've got everyone in seed destiny blindly following real lacus because real lacus can't do anything wrong
what do you mean
can you give me a bit of context where episode 43 remaster is at
üíÄ

was essentially this
the only reason why team Kira was against Zaft the whole time
by the way
yeah, a target that was preparing an army going straight for them iirc
where did he nuke first? moon base?
All I'm saying is every Zaft move was logical until maybe the last few episodes where Durandal starts nuking shit for fun
:c
and then my website dies
remaster took out the filler shit
ah shit I'm watching original
43 remaster or 43 original
did he?
Durandal could have nuked Orb immediately after taking control of requiem because Orb refuses the Destiny plan
next thing you tell me is University being opt-in is a bald faced lie
from Destiny plan's actual announcement, all I see is modern day education system
where was weeding out and out of place quote from
he's literally saying that there's better people to do the jobs so let them do their job
the Destiny Plan was supposed to lead people to what they're good at, does not mean that everyone has to do it
perhaps Durandal's word choice is just shit

I think it was Netherlands with programs that test children's interest and provide specialized classes
oh, I'm talking about destiny plan happening IRL in a good light
someone said Destiny plan is literally happening IRL right now in a not as sci-fi fashion
https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Destiny_Plan
it's a plan to see what each person is talented at and guide people to their calling
no
I'm just saying, writing team Kira as shitbags was the original goal of one of the writers
Destiny plan was also fleshed out to show that it was a way to improve Natural's way of life so they don't feel inferior to coordinators
I'm just saying, Zaft team had more good talking points than team Kira's preaching and uses of force
~~if we go back to the start of the story, the Earth Alliance used WMDs on PLANTS first~~
right, so how is what team Kira doing justice? rendering one side of the conflict absolutely fucked again, would it not just lead to naturals wanting to fuck coordinators over again.
shouldn't zaft soldiers be fighting with even more fervor now Patrick Zala died a martyr of sorts
then why did Seed end the way it did
if you're gonna say it like that
it was shown in the actual show that everyone else are absolute wimps and he's the main psychopath
well he was the head of organization who pushes buttons
if you want to say that, Zaft is preventing multiple PLANT from getting lazered
hmm
then they should have gone directly to orb and talked it out like what athrun suggested shouldn't they
I don't know man, it just seems like team Kira is a bunch of hypocrites/sociopaths if you look at it
He doesn't have a world gov does he
then you would just move to Orb then?
right, rewatching E47 of original, durandal announces destiny plan and says he plans to introduce and execute the plan, and never said that it's mandatory throughout the world either, and suddenly team Kira said we gotta fight at the end of the day...?
Writers came out to say it's optional opt-in plan that durandal was going to put in place, not sure what it's said in the main series
I still don't see why it's bad to show people what they're good at, doesn't mean that they can't work hard for their dreams does it
his point was that everyone had things they're good at and that there's genetically superior naturals too
~~then again, isn't our current education system doing the same thing but without sci fi tech bullshit~~
it made sense to him because he studied that shit, and believe that people will be happier doing stuff they're good at
man fuck the last few episode
I just watched them fire requiem once and decided that's enough before my brain malds too hard
I stopped watching at that point since they butcher everything : ^ )
aye, it's in the last few episode where it's used isn't it
it's the Requiem made by Alliance no?
Zaft in Seed were genocidal at the end for no reason really
I was throwing Seed out the window since that was like it's own contained conflict
oh
I don't know about building genocide superweapons but they took it from the Alliance : ^ )
from what I see from main series, it is Athrun's take that it is non-optional
it's non-optional?
wait
yes, it is a completely opt in program
his plans isn't to rule over the world either, it was to give naturals less reason to hate coordinators by helping them find their calling
he didn't even start the final fight
he didn't demand the entire world should follow the plan, he just gave the option to everyone
because Athrun was doing things that aren't allowed in the army?
which hit team are we talking about
shit, they're even stealing documents from Zaft wreckage to get the destiny plan documents
why would they not attack archangel after all the shit they've done
stealing tech as well
refuse to talk and all that shit
the say peace and fight one sidedly
they fight Zaft because Orb fighting Zaft while Orb is under ruling of a monkey
because they're literal chaos in the story
so why is Destiny plan bad, this is all Athrun's assumption that they're going to weed out people
after RETREATING from orb after guessing that Djibril escaped?
and assumed that Durandal is going to commit to the plan without changing ANYTHING?
the shit that they taken from a Zaft wreck?
Athrun talks about Destiny plan after reading old documents of destiny plan and rejecting it outright?
bruh
who told you the assassins weren't units from last war
and then they just throw it on Durandal because he's the leader
a hit team where Athrun said it might not be them considering there's literal terrorist out there living out Patrick Zala's plans
~~it looks like what happens when you pause too much in VLC~~
~~I'm hoping it's a split story like build fighter and build fighter try so I can skip directly~~
I've been hearing that re:rise is good but season 1 was bad
or was it someone else
Blockio was it you that watched build divers re:rise?
~~I just don't like how at the end of the day it's written like team Kira did nothing wrong and got none of the consequences, applies to SEED too~~
there were paths they could have taken after each plot point
: ^ )
of course it had great ideas, like copying everything Zeta did for a bit
from fucking dumbass assassins that didn't just bomb their orphanage in the first place at night
Destiny was fun when the plot made sense in the first half before team Kira got thrown into the mix
and the writer making Shin lose IQ starting mid way
aimbot brother
because my mans hacking
phase shift armor is broken OP
at the end of Seed
Justice got nuked
again, Zaft had all the reasons to go for Lacus' head for all the shit she's stealing from Zaft
that nobody knows it's 100% durandal
what, because of assassins?
lmao
I mean she immediately doubts durandal even before knowing destiny plan
~~there's a theory that the entire season of Seed Destiny was her scheme to be in the PLANT congress or some shit~~
Lacus was just a we gotta have an idol in here like macross is it not
it's because of her parents being politicians in the first place iirc
if you're going to say that, then it already exist with the coordinator shit
but the plan never said to announce to the entire fucking world what you're good at if it's opt in
I can't either because that's a fucking dumb writing to suddenly have neo genesis appear on the last few episodes
that exist already
getting rid of him was the whole goal of his part of the world war
Djibril was a war criminal is he not
as I said again, the writers later on fleshed out the plan durandal was going to implement and that it was an opt in optional plan
and his world war literally ended moments ago with Djib's death
~~ping millhi when we stream, let him tell us where he was~~
I got it working on my phone too
well

fuck that kekl

yeah
lmao
and then sometimes they even put a windows 98 screen saver of their channel profile (the one that floats around) to avoid flagging
and then they mirror the image
if they include audio, it is only key quotes
or just screencaps only
added lags
the youtubers I watch that talks about Gundam plot and discussions on settings uses footage that are like 1 second long

All I know for F91 is one of the song is a bop
also during the delling what is a gundam memes F91 isn't a gundam?
but it was growing in size towards Hathaway and Unicorn
V I don't know
I know F91 went small
~~also isn't all the late UC stuff straight up bigger than the RX78~~
if you think about it planes are pretty big...?
I mean

~~You missed the best part, she loves eating poison~~
Domon and Master Asia's JP VA is peak
I prefer JP dub for G Gundam
Depends on price (manga spoilers)||it's not permanent and needs extra to keep him as a girl, I mean she can also make temporary bust size improvement drugs so uhh yeah it'd sell||
in every parallel universe
at this point Ash is just a time lord, being everywhere 10 years old
was that a fucking lie?
weren't they doing a final ash journey
||https://youtu.be/VyUeKoXH6DU|| I'm saying they trashed 0079 themes, not literally everything. Man literally butts head every time I talk about seed/seed destiny.
shut the fuck up
well then don't
you never say what the most important arc of seed is
again
lmao
too bad they take the message of 0079 and threw it down the drain as you will see by the end of seed ~~enjoy it while you can~~. Also, are you watching remastered or original?
Rau's JP VA is top tier : ^ )
~~you're missing out on ogawa being main character~~
I've heard that victory was written out of spite is it not
the start was good, and then it made no sense at all : ^ )
~~there's people saying stargazer is the best seed content~~
Watch Destiny if you want to mald about shit writing : ^ )
I was told it's just an orphan that looks exactly like him : ^ )
All I've heard is that Duo has gone to shit with his luck and became a politician at the end
that's different from what I've heard lmao
~~The wheel design was made out of Tomino lashing out according to this~~
and he was pissed to he made it bad
it says here that victory was written while tomino was pushed by execs to sell toys and "new designs"
