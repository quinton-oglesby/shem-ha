<a:miyanotableslam:557855306881957889>
oooof jalter
<:aww:419211447915249664>
oh my
i really think of drawing a maria/tsubasa art for her birthday
awww they are just too adroable
i loved when she had that gear the colours suited her so well
oof 22000 not bad
defo i like when its cute and when the artwork is about a ship that makes sense
yuri is great but i dont need th rest
im not a huge fan of lewds in general
im not sure how by my symphogear forlder is but im sure i have character folders from games with about the same amount
yuri is the only pure stuff <:bless:433765005125746688>  no need to see the rest tbh
and here i thought im the only art obsessed
<:zoomEyes:362236969054633984>
i gotta save them all once im back from work
<:weary_nadeshiko:416728251612921856>
maria abs are too good
üôá
i will worship you forever man
JUST KILL ME NOW
IOMG
and ripped jeans
omg yes hoods!!
summer hats too

i agree that makes them look great
mmmm the tomboy look
i think its why i like witches a lot their hats are just too cool
ooof i agree i love big hats with long hair <:HeartHug:521037216969916427>  <@!246146781832806401>
<:JibrilLewd:415851942255001610>
especially when their genral outfit is like armour
casual looks of characters are always my fave
okey that second to last one is INSANLY cool
i might do it anyway
ohh well
ah but i guess shirabe didnt find a source either
<a:2303_Rainbow_Weeb:562030696940699669>
dang i'd love to colour that last one
ehhh im mostly in for basa/maria the rest is not so my thing
i think people start already looking at me why i start giggling at my desk
outside literally killing me
<:JibrilLewd:415851942255001610>
i can live with an OT3
<a:miyanotableslam:557855306881957889>

YES SHE LOOKS GOOD
yang is the blondie right?
all i know is that it has really good looking girls and an actual good story
Oo maybe i can find all 3 of them
thanks!! nah im usually fine with streams
hmmm i should look for it again
Ahh i thought there were more but i would already be happy for 13 episodes with hikasa
i really wanted to wath rwby in japanese dub only for her but i cant find more than like 6 episodes
<:wew:398568667790573582>
also cant forget her crazy role as pitohui
i love her for the roles as emi yusa in devil is a part timer and kou from new game
its so pleasing
i dont know how many times i have listen to hikasas voice to just calm me down
mine would either be Ready! Stand up! or Fushich≈ç no Flamme <:wew:398568667790573582>
its so catchy
üòÇ
im listening to that song right now
and fun fact
that was my wallpaper once as well
hot steamy showre scene <:zoomEyes:362236969054633984>
i would give my spot for basa
~~i wish i was with her in that shower~~
<:wew:398568667790573582>
okaa-saaaaan
ooooof
it was a badass show
i loved the vibes of black lagoon
just made yang 10 times better
that
lmao revy was cool
ooof that angry look is hot with the red eyes
Oh yeah i think the change suits her
the one on the righttttt
doesnt look bad
i dont really know her so i can only judge by first look
<:gab_thinking:410534442445176834>
i usually prefer longer hair but it suits her
Ooo
<:panda_pray:409422484606287882>
thank you kami-sma
someone hit me up with that hair style
lmao saving this
but the recent one with braid and basa side tail was <a:BlobOnFire:471317844072857620>
all their concert dresses were so pretty

<a:2303_Rainbow_Weeb:562030696940699669>
*thats not even our final form yet*
"lets try and find out what it can do"

this is important
noooo
*but continue*
*this is not good being at work*

sports, drinking, karaoke probably everything
i think everything you would do with kanade would end up in a hilarious and funny way
<:medB_stare:480445261458571284>
im not sure if thats a compliment or something bad üòÇ
i see more than one thing thats bouncing there
this is bad
kerrik knows me too well and i havent even been here for long
*maaaaaaybe*
<:gab_thinking:410534442445176834>
she would totally kick my ass
i wish i was that good with a regualr pencil
ooof that traditional one is great
they probably are the type of people who just picked up a word because they saw everyone using it without knowing the reason
yeah i know the song
neh i just put the server at the bottom on my list
since then i just hate the word
i know someone in a server who says that in every second sentence
but i think i have to draw more
yet
i havnet
havent really drawn for a while because i wasnt really happy with what i drew üòÇ
ehhhh i honestly dont have that many things, ive mostly been studying and havent posted much but my twitter is linked in my account if you wanna check it out
it is painful but its fun at the same time

i pretend that never happened
<:ohnoes:605045639100891136>
its so fun
drawing hair is the best
screw all my other ideas
ugh i wanna draw her more

but it suits her so well
the perspective is great and i love when girls have  these t-shirt with a knot makes them so tomboy idk
ugh sorry maria but i have to make that kanade my wallpaper
i wanna draw like that
this picture is goals in more than one way
i wanna touch the tummy
üò©
goals right there
ALSO YOO THAT PICTURE
"you know serena you can show how much you love maria by saying these words to her"
she totally would
üòÇ
i could listen to these small stories all day
üòÇ
when maria told her to wear glasses cuz she is idol
didnt basa call her that in the beach episode of gx
tsubasa cant probably handle a sip and kanade just got wasted
maria would def take care of the drunk
so true
lmao that pic when they ate drunk
<a:BlobMeltGif:414770582782083072>
yes yes now i can go home and be all
*interesting*
that is
i gotta safe so many tonight oh god
I SAW THIS BEFORE BUTI GLADLY DIE AGAIN
<:aww:419211447915249664>
braid maria
Oooooo
oh noe i awakaned something
cuz its called blue dimaond something
oh snap that was from the emote
hmmm interesting
i like
oof and she drinks beer
but ive added the kanades to my list
oh god that was such a bad one i wanna redo it üòÇ
i knew you can find treasures on the bottom of the sea
<a:miyanotableslam:557855306881957889> <a:miyanotableslam:557855306881957889> <a:miyanotableslam:557855306881957889>
<:tohrusmug:560195587816030218>
thats the plan
i need more time to study, working full time doesnt give me enough time
ooof yeah thats why over my limit atm haha but it would be great to be there one day
i think i saw that one in your collab  with the parasol and she had tied up hair i think
ooof i can try myself at that not sure how god i am with so much skin colouring but swimsuits are a YES
yeah i need to study proper anatomy, atm i just use 3d models and other art as references but knowing how muscles work would help me more definitly
do you have any request of art work you want to see her in? i could need some inspiration
and just dont sleep
<:panda_happy:409422485210005504>
they are all adorable
awwwwww <:blobaww:360216672717766656> <:blobaww:360216672717766656> <:blobaww:360216672717766656>
<:ohnoes:605045639100891136>
because i probably die from drawing and then need to be revived
in this order
yes
<:monkaS:426558019363405824>
oh no i cant focus on drawing if there is more
<a:wuahmaria:605046493724016640>

awww havent seen this one before
embrace the floof <:tama_waw:412288562831032322>
teasing basa was her hobby probably
i used the towel one as a reference and for idk what reason i think she looks really goo in that picture
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
oh weeeeell

wtc's short stories always give me life

thanks kerrik!
ahh good to know before i make an account
but speaking of pixiv, do you guys look up all your tags in japanese i assume?
her eyes especially they stare a dagger through me
<:musa_ahhh:436932126148001823>
but this skin is insane
not that i didnt love her before already
<:TsumiLewd:586745848973623316>
god i love her summer skin
MUUSASHII
*protecccc*
<:aww:419211447915249664>  yes
happy
awww this is how basa should look like all the time
its just super moe ~~and quite lesbo as well~~ but it puts a smile on my face everytime i rewatch it
definetely
<@414366682966917120> its a really cute and wholesome anime if you wanna watch it btw
which i might do
i probably need to make a pixiv account for that to happen
i also told wfc to make a beach kanade
<@!263983345669505025> i most likey try to draw maria again since i wasnt that happy with how the last one turned out
she is from new game! <@414366682966917120>
sank yuu <a:2303_Rainbow_Weeb:562030696940699669>

<a:Yousoro:400521540732715008>
<a:BlobMeltGif:414770582782083072>
time to make a chris emoji server üòÇ
never crossed the thought of searching for these merged ones
i mostly search by individual tags
like who looks for only the merged tag?
lool okey thats kinda stupid
i dont wanna get hurt
<:wew:398568667790573582>
<:bless:433765005125746688>
indeed
and i had to chug a bottle of holy water
i disabled filter once
yeah no
yeah i guess just calling it "symphogear" isnt really common in japan hence why they always use the full tag
i shall remember that
<a:2303_Rainbow_Weeb:562030696940699669>
ok fixed ma tag sank yuu <@!263983345669505025>
it just takes me a while to read it i gotta get back in shape
oof well i can read japanese somewhat but i suck at kanji üòÇ
<a:BlobMeltGif:414770582782083072>
but at least i got that symphogear yag right
ill check when im on pc! <@!263983345669505025>
THANK YOU!
ohh i thought i added the kanade tag
also thats a sexy back
i wonder what she is looking at on that screen
the first one is super good
they are lovely
awwww thanks!!
lmao probably
kiri would be the person where you dont know if she does it intentionally or not üòÇ
<a:AtagoHYPERStare:588629714394939413>
*oyoyoyo*
shirabe: "ki-kiri-chan stopppppu"
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
maria: "what ere you guys even trying to do?!"
<:sweatyBell:530740282732576778>
oh no someone got tangled up
<a:DorothyOppai2:399003704394776606>
<:umu:351861443206971392>
but it would be hilarious if tis true üòÇ  but maria is too tsun to say that
*did.. did she really say that or did you come up with that*
pouty pout
<:KouPout:559766526341677087>
my list is endless already üòÇ
<:KouHyperThink:585618741396766757>
basa looks good with glasses
baby serena will grow up with the love child of kiri/shirabe and bikki/miku
singing lesbian babies is not far off
everything is possible
its symphogear
<:AYS_zoom:610498050393243668>
we will find out
oh wait its just her wearing an apron
and it was quite spicy
i think i have that one too
maria should just cook some beef stroganoff for her
food brings happiness
<:umu:351861443206971392>
i think its a comic related to food?
<:KouHyperThink:585618741396766757>
so does that mean gen is a ranger too
<@!279341087494242304> binge watch it and tell me if its good
>singing without protection 
okey that actaully made me laugh üòÇ
it be funny if thats an actual thing tho üòÇ
also pretty sure thats how it will go for maria and basa as well üòÇ it just *happens* while they sing
im scared to click
i dont think they are meant for something else
but where is the part where tsubasa is all drunk and saying juicy things
and then they lived happy ever after
https://twitter.com/topturtling/status/1161407077451010049?s=21
okey this one is really sick üî•üî•
https://twitter.com/n_niyu/status/1161373310807973888?s=21
okey that one is almost emote worthy
their love child would totally have some hair pins
<:ohnoes:605045639100891136>
miku ichiban and niban
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
see
<@!263983345669505025>  also no, no i dont they are always on
god that artist is so cool
*how bad*
yes now basa is pregnant
<:blobwhistle:466348572112191489>
sorry officer i will stop now
id probably just fall into the floof if i were to massage her back
<:lewd:377488729398444053>
back muscles are hot
OMG YES
napes and backs can be really hot
awww üòî
yeah thats why you should tie your hair up when wearing one too i believe
the easiest way for me to recognize wfc when we meet will be him wearing a kanade shirt
üòÇ
i mean i guess ankle fetish is a thing
but i really cant stop looking at that pic her cheeky smile is too good
<:emo:416329875075366923>
shooo
üò©
i want that hair
literal goals
<:wew:398568667790573582>
OMG THAT KANADE
their art looks really good
OOOF
FIT MARIA
<:tohrusmug:560195587816030218>
OHMY
by fighting?
expect that i dont know how to fight wither
i should use that as my excuse too for being sloppy
lmaoo
n-no
no one saw that
wooops
i wonder if kanade also cleaned tsubasas room while they were together
i can imagine kanade would rather let genjuuro do it than basa and ame no habakiri
pretty sure those scissors will break before kanades hair
<a:BlobMeltGif:414770582782083072>
*thank youuuu*
anyway im gonna take that kanabasa and use it as a server icon
yeah.... <:bless:433765005125746688>
yeah i think if you dont something is wrong
im sure i would have the best sleep in that floofiness
kanades kanades i see
god these abs
<a:aauJibrildrool:586744867837968415>
MMMM
YES THAT ONE
one day!
ahhh this one is awesome! i love when hair is done well üôè
<:blobwhistle:466348572112191489>
Ooo
thirst for maria abs and kanade hair
i think thats wrong assumption
who said im not thristy
<:TsumiLewd:586745848973623316>
the first one thoooo
karee raisu
same but its so good
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/604648863982288905/604648908509151252/basa_maid.png maidbasa also cute
<a:wuahmaria:605046493724016640>
why is this so cuuute
thank you
everything works
as long as they share a bed *alone*
that works too
such a drawing has to exist somewhere im sure
which i totally agree with
she would probably use her as human body pillow
she can only sleep thight with basa by her side
and then stay there
carry her to bed
<a:BlobMeltGif:414770582782083072>
this one tho
<:aww:419211447915249664>

nahh dont worry rakhi

i dont even wanna start with that

<:zoomEyes:362236969054633984>

awww thank you!! ill be sure to keep that for the next one <@!246146781832806401>
<a:wuahmaria:605046493724016640>

yes try it maria
thats true haha but i love her deep voice i think its quite unique and you hear it out so well in all the team songs
its amazing when you hear her songs from season 1 and then hear the difference from XV
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>

its practice and thats always good to have
ahh dont sweat it, its a cool idea anyways so drafting a sketch is no loss for me
i can think about a price that would suit my level of art and i can make you a rough sketch so you can see if thats in your favor what you would want to see
*good i have no life and no plans for my weekend*
<a:miyanotableslam:557855306881957889>

~~if its a kanade body pillow im down~~
Oh well no one has ever asked me that before üòÇ if its something i know i can do then i think i would. Im not that professional yet, so doing stuff im not really confident in, I would just do for free and use it for practice
i should use these qoutes for art work some day <:gab_thinking:410534442445176834>
i like hurting myself with feels
<a:8223_intslTsuyuCrying:562030670671642644>

i forgot how many times ive stopped working just to be here and listen  to wfc's stuff or your pictures üòÇ
its both a blessing and a pain tbh
time to lie down and cry
now youve done it
>what she would want
can i get a tissue instead of a water bottle for once
*thank yout*

"one time you will look back and see how far you have come"
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>

<a:BlobPartyGlasses:471241064930476032>
~~and basa got her head in marias chest~~
basa would probably trip too and then both are tangled
accidently lands on basa
she just trips and then is tangled up
XV spoiler: ||we know how that went with airgetlam||
*do i make a comment or not*
shed make a good business woman
her clothing looks great
id be fine if we get something like that at the end üòÇ
ugh i really need a translation or do it myself when im home this is so nice
<a:wuahmaria:605046493724016640>

i need a translation <a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
but its cute af
im super confused whos together with who now lmao
Oh

<a:wuahmaria:605046493724016640>

<:awe:416029484643254272>
ohhh neat im like basa size

*ofc kerrik has a picture*
i wonder if kanades hat would also have a cut out for her hair
yooo thats cool
<:aww:419211447915249664>

i can imagine it be fun af and hilarious
we all know drinking with kanade would be an adventure you either never wanna forget or wish it never happened üòÇ
hai!
<a:Yousoro:400521540732715008>
üôá
and thanks for the support

while drawing
i have geah music on constant replay üòÇ
i dun wanna die
and a party afterwards
same here but i have to work tmr
sleep
but first
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
i know she is only an anime character but the determination she has for success and how she wants to be good at drawing makes me really motivated
kou is my motivation for drawing
highly understandable
and the girl with the kansai accent
the short brown head
they get some more screen time
specially when you liked hajime and yun
the manga is acutally cool too right now
somehow always cheers me up
i always watch it when i have a bad day haha
the REAL lesbian ship
do it for kourin
<:zoomEyes:362236969054633984>
watch it again
its so pretty and bitter sweet
like i legit cry
i cry every time on the very last episode
<:TsumiLewd:586745848973623316>
i suck for new game
YES <@!400844698140409856>
*time to practice*
thank you üôá hopefully my actual drawing will turn out like that too
<a:miyanotableslam:557855306881957889>
but after that i have kanade plans
i wanna do one more thing
you converted me
ok
i mean i dont mind their ship buuuuut tsubamari is better or make kanade just harem king with all girls
shouldnt that be basas legs then?
kanade can GAAR at me like that <a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
~~thank god beer is calling in two hours~~

<:TsumiLewd:586745848973623316>
both at once
i still blame wfc for getting obsessed
also can i recolour that serena to tsubasa? much better ship
she can shoot me <:wew:398568667790573582>
more glowwwwww
<:HyperGudako:360572698184646657>
she slays that business look
GAAAAH thats so cute <:awe:416570913287569408>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
*so many bad flashbacks*
BEST!!!!
OMG SHE IS DRINKING A STRONG ZERO
oh look the nine tailed fox escaped naruto üòÇ
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
oh well that works too
make her turn cute and give her a piggy back ride home cuz she is too wasted
nuuu
i wonder if she would be the type that starts to turn cute and shy or tsun when totally trashed
kanade being wasted and funny or just laugh at others being wasted are two thing id totally watch
lool well that would be totally unexpected so maybe still fun
kanade would just tease the shit out of her because she cant handle alcohol
i wouldnt mind kanade and maria drunk together
lmao it took me a moment to get that
awwww
maybe because you have this sorta image of how she is and how dhe acts that it feels weird when its someone else trying to do it
ahhh yeah thats understandable
some of them can look really good but i still prefer my 2D waifu
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
yes i thank kerrik everyday
even if someone in kanade cosplay brings beer
glad my hair is not red anymore otherwise that be kinda closeish
you gotta being a frist aid kit too
<:AYS_zoom:610498050393243668>  brb booking vacation
rip
now we scattered all over the globe
the only friends i did that with were the people from my school in japan
they would do random shit all night and pull pranks
i wanna have a good time with friends like they do
yes that!!
all good
i filled my waterbottle before i went home
<:rin_sips_tea:422992385207697418>
<:TsumiLewd:586745848973623316>
maybe she starts to ara when she is really drunk
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
i think someone on the server made these
when are they going to their onsen trip and all sleep together in one room on futons
i wanna pat them <:aww:419211447915249664>
<a:aauNeptuneNod:586613670579273778>
they need actual rings
and then you wonder why i need a waater bottle all day
kiss <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
YES
give me back my girls
oh no
kanade would use her to prank tsubamari so she doesnt get caught herself
omg this comic is cute
and maria already tries to be the serious one and kanade doesnt care
smol kanade and maria with a braid are just lovely
its so adorable i had to save it on my phone
shed be the kid that bullies all the bois and kicks their ass

ahh

welp
<:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
tsubasa looks like she actually got printed on that pillow
looks hot
but i like how she brushes through her hair
i thought it was female mostly but that pointy chin somehow made her look kinda male
*conflicted*
she looks like she got boobs but i think its supposed to be male
hot hair
<a:miyanotableslam:557855306881957889>
<a:aauNeptuneNod:586613670579273778>
<:NeneSigh:585556383462588447> it makes her really cute like that but, please just give rin what she wants
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
kou just needs to stop being so dense
mmm more wholesome <a:BlobMeltGif:414770582782083072>
<a:BlobMeltGif:414770582782083072>

sorrry was eating
maybe or she just really missed maria
<a:BlobMeltGif:414770582782083072>
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>

and rivers here are muddy
rivers are scary their currents are too strong

sea is cold
no... not really
time to book expensive diving vacations

<a:IfritAPeak:677489589379792896>
yeah thats basically what the story video is about
its just the logo of the rhine lab team
lol i didnt know about that
it explains why she is drawn with saria so often
its a cute story
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQN9bnv-9wU oh wait no this is the video i was looking for
the subs are only for the song
but you honestly get the idea of her story just with the images
they got english subs too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYPF2fOij4 oh wait might be this one ikxi
but you'd like have to search them one by one
but there were lots of videos with lore from the video contest
they might make some
not sure i dont think so
you can also re read the story of the game online
well each character has a profile sheet where you can read where they come from and how they joined the squad
it was made for the video contest of the game
<:pepeWhy:650777046720446496>
nuuu they deleted the video from youtube
hold on
i think there is a lore video
gg
and now she is like a nuclear bomb and burns everything
ifrit is an infected by the virus, goes to rhine lab and then she gets like tested or expirmient or whatever by the members there
well the story goes that
not sure what silence actually expiremented on her üòÇ
or something
i think ifrit is a demon

musashi got more of like a messy haor bun but the overal look is just so nice

ahh fair enough, i think these types of characters are really hit or miss with their personality
<a:laffeythumb:634681443104325632>

its just definitenly not everyones thing and it probably is irritating when you see it for the first time because gear doesnt really have anything in common with dragons

it would have been okey for tsubasa or maria but i didnt expect that from kiri
have to agree maria in the business suit with glasses was <:wew:398568667790573582>
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
stop stepping on my feels
i saw that üòÇ
<:KouHyperThink:585618741396766757>
~~uprising never existed in my mind~~
hmmm true or maybe just tsubasa leaves for a while dunno
the team falling appart and then finding back together to fight the last boss <:gab_thinking:410534442445176834>
its probably the point of the whole season as i can see this going on for a while
i dont want her to break but i think she will
<:bless:433765005125746688>
who wants to watch 3D
its 3D
lmao
westerns are not ready for this piece

you are my hero
that was my avatar for like half a year
<@!193408538909868033> is there more where that pic comes from?
üò´
i want fit maria in the anime
<a:jibril_drool:416723270369411072>
i neeed them
omg are there more maria abs pictures
hmmm not sure maybe XV will more deal with the after effects of what happened now
cant have anyone dying
better that way
but maria has always thought of being their big sis so im sure it would have an impact on her
i know <a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
but i can also see something happening to kiri or shirabe
probably
i can see someting happening to miku, kiri or shirabe that will affect maria/hibiki
well maybe not all of them but i thought more of the fact that they dont give a number more like "everyone" or "half"
probably just saying something "all the attendands" or something
as long as you chip in something out of the ordinary that will take peoples interest i think you can succeed very well
i feel most people wouldnt accept sining in a battle anime and only in an idol show, yet it somehow really worked out and people are enjoying the combination
yeah i gave them one ep and then i fell asleep
you just gotta find that "something" that makes your isekai anime different from the generic other ones
it works now too, slime datte ken was super popular and went sky rocket even tho isekai has been a thing for a while
yeah you can succees really good with isekai or it can be real bad
idk symphogear is kinda like my guilty pleasure i dont really care for the logic or what others think about it <:TetShrug:327138982720700418>
<:bless:433765005125746688>

<:sudoku:463745119099551745>
nooooooooo
oh god i hope this wont become real
i only heard fire force was
nope dont think so
if she has stolen moves she might as well steal kiris thigh shot
tbh
you cabt have enough thighs
maria got thighs tho thats all i need to see in the transformation
guess who was wrong
and i thought i couldnt feel sadder for tsubasa
i would give her up for the greater good of maribasa
<:emo:416329875075366923>
but id snacc her anyway
<:stare:406796430368440321>
id snacc that christmas cake
thats just some random maria thing to say üòÇ
gotta be some famous sword for sure

definitly! i just started rewatchin season 1 and its just WOW when you compare it now with XV
<:8253_RaphtaliaPat:546013212110487553>
shee desperatly needs hugs and headpats
üòÇ
i wasnt sure if i saw that right the first time i watched that epsidoe
<:bless:433765005125746688>
either GX or AXZ cant really remember
i think i have such a story book bocklet at home from one of the older seasons
~~i kinda wanna see it but kinda not~~
and then the ice falls to the ground...
but look how happy she is <:wowo:584070823095173130> like a kid when they get ice cream
and hibiki struggling with herself probably?
looks like we gonna see some kazanrai family business
yeah i can see that too i think she will probably be forced to side with her family
deadalus end was sick and how it was animated <:wew:398568667790573582>
wasnt really a fan
yeah it felt like a season finale when bikki solo'd them
~~unless maria an basa actually get a room togheter~~
but this one for sure already fullfilled all my wishes for christmas
im not sure if i should be scared or excited for every new episode
or at least if she hasnt its about dem time to show her and make little sword happy again
i wonder if basa was watching while she practiced that ribbon dancing
<:6072_ButtPantsu:546014213349441538>
<:KouHyperThonk:585590089195847699>
maybe tsubasa tied her up before
i wanted to get the box set for both new game! season because they had nice bonus materials and posters but both season were 600$ together
yeah i heard. my friend has one. thougj if you look at blu ray prices...
im not sure where i could find a region free player in my place
that would have been so much money gone waste üòÇ
i almost bought a ton of blu rays in japan but thank god someone told me they region locked
ah pheeewwww
dumb question but are japanese cds region locked too?
niceeee <:aww:419211447915249664>
<@!246146781832806401> did you get that CD? <:zoomEyes:362236969054633984>
i wouldnt mind if maria *uses* tsubasa
what if tsubasas sword is already someone  that tried it
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
"here i got you some red ink to sign"
most of the time you are also really torn in between and you might would have acted differently in other circumstances.
maria def falls into the clumsy category that would 100% get tangled up in all this
lmao im sure tsubasa had to help maria before when she first tried that
wouldnt mind
<:emo:416329875075366923>
they all better not die
attack on miku <:ThonkamoNoMae:525215640127275018>
hmmmm
but i dont wanna hear her song when she potentially fights some of the other girls <:emo:416329875075366923>
yeah i also think she will or has to choose the side of her family and well join her grandfather
ahh i have that with ami ami in my country
love how fast they are and easy to order
cd japan is super fast in delivery i order from there all the time
i gotta set a reminder to buy the maria CD next week
and now look what that got her into
did she even have an arc in AXZ
<:wew:398568667790573582>
oof adding more salt to tsubasas wound and kill genjuuro
okey i would accept that
<:KouHyperThonk:585590089195847699>
cant wait for her song the violins at the start were soo good
<a:wuahmaria:605046493724016640>
<:blobaww:360216672717766656>
best henshin
~~im totally fine that they were horny~~
im gonna listen to it all afternoon
oh snap its there
maybe basa needs more than one to help her depression
even better
OT3 works too
oh
if she takes chris ill take maria so its good
<:umu:351861443206971392>
as long as its yuri i can live with it
dont take basa from maria
<:ohnoes:605045639100891136>
onsen episode when
id also be fine with a basa kanade prequel
i just need more floof
if they have a hot battle duet im fine
<a:BlobMeltGif:414770582782083072>
would be so nice and wholesome to watch
that
<:umu:351861443206971392>
and everything is fine
they just gotta *sing* all night
oh im sure she can
im fine with a spin off of her and basa being on tour
<:reeeee:460122400420528130>
yeah no bulli
üò≠
i need at least 10 more seasons
thats where it all started
<a:AizClap:599515301662556164>
tsubasa would follow him on her segway
<:ohnoes:605045639100891136>
which he is
how dare he
<:bless:433765005125746688>
his main theme is some catchy elevator music that plays 24 hours
he created the show
he knew it all along
<:umu:351861443206971392>
whjat if he watches symphoggear and spoils himself on his ending
then he steals a little kids ice cream
ill chip money in for it to happen
i would love to just see what the girls to on a regular basis, like chris school days, maria/basa on tour concerts. what kiri and shirabe do outside of school. there is so much stuff you could focus on
*not ready*
<:nadeshiko_shook:407587953687265281>
nahh thats already broken
i wonder who gets hurt this time <:notlikethis:425792873758195716>
needs a maribasa bath scene too
let me have a look at those preview images
<a:wuahmaria:605046493724016640>
yeah im sure it will be included there
this would also be a pretty background without the text
hopefully we get it soon
it would be a cool stich tho
but i think it will look cleaner without the text in the first place
i could also photoshop the credits away but i think you would still see that there was text before
i could do it but i guess its not so pretty <:toastie:587715260190949399>
or textless
hmmm but looking at the ending now im not sure if there is one without credits
not yet but i could make one <:gab_thinking:410534442445176834>
this chat is so evil today <:bless:433765005125746688>
for a certain role
aince some VA actually get chosen for their voice
it probably doesnt feel that different considering its their job and they play similar roles often
a cute trap
yeah because didnt they forshadow that at the end of AXZ
ahhh
i suck at reading kanji whats the name of the episode?
but i guess since we see him outside HQ in the preview images i guess they had to give up the submarine
ctrl + del and poof he is gone
ftfy
"hail hydra"
tsubasa kills him by accident
i must prepare myself
<:bless:433765005125746688>
we just never saw it
im sure it has happened many times now <:umu:351861443206971392>
thats one comfy place to hang out
but not sure how many i can take of these
i dont think that was the last unexpected thing
i dont really see them doing something that big either but you never know it could just come out of nowhere
i need wholesome
i wanna have hope too
<:rin_sips_tea:422992385207697418>
im sure thats what they wanna make us think and then  boom it hits hard
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
nuuu
<:gab_thinking:410534442445176834>
can just put her back together i guess then
onee-san was only protecting her family
<:emocat:336655686249480196>
i just cuddle them to death
thank god i have two at home
<:nadeshiko_shook:407587953687265281>
üòÇ
i call it perfection
ooooooof okey that picture is wow
and here i thought the girls might go to winter vacation because they have some time off now... guess not
<a:wuahmaria:605046493724016640>
japan is a beautiful country
ahhh glad i can play the video
i love the celtic music in hibikis henshin it sounds so cool
when she went on rampage i first thought miku would get caught in the fire and get burned
ill commit senpukku if that happens
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
but at this point im not sure if basa is really gonna break down or not.  like so far you only vague see that it affects her but i wonder if we gonna see her issues more in the next episodes
probably that^ as you saw in this episode that the spell is still on her
<:ThonkamoNoMae:525215640127275018>
i thought fudou was the one watching sg so thats why he is always one step ahead
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
"who is that good looking man in the show?"
"Oh right, its ME"
with that chest and those legs for sure
how could we forget gen in this ranking
her deep voice is sexy af tho
i think vanessa is bigger
<:KouHyperThink:585618741396766757>
oh ye elfnein wins by far üòÇ
also considering that shirabe is quite younger than tsubasa and they almost have the same size already
oh yeahh i forgot about that
<a:aauNeptuneNod:586613670579273778>
maria will make up for her
i dont think she is flatter
but that shot in her transformation is my fave for sure
i mean being sexier and taller than me is not hard lmao
<:02Naruhodo:470411644321660929>
the first time i saw this picture before the episode i thought we get a time skip üòÇ she is looking so mature <:wew:398568667790573582>
i hope next episode stuff finally gonna happen, so far it really felt more like building up and we are almost at the halfway point
depnding on the ending tho
<:UniGun:585585241737920539>
ah yea better break us all at once
but seeing her go bersek and killing noise mistaking them for mil, i really thought one of them would have been human
well that too
same tbh, i thought she would kill someone innocent herself this time
well im mostly too lazy to go back correct my spelling and autocorrect always messes up words anyway
oh yeah i always fuck that one up üòÇ
i gotta power through somehow
definitly
<:ohnoes:605045639100891136>
i just had bbq
ye <:bless:433765005125746688>
jam supplies for a life time
well still curious who that jam fountain belongs to
thats why i thought it would happen
i know
*if only her gf would finally make a move on her and do something*
<:aww:419211447915249664>
yes many headpats
need my headcanon doe
<:kms:476512830493949974>
im sure its hella spooky if you get haunted by tomatoes in your dreams
~~but thank god it will probably never happen~~
they day maribasa will finally make a move will be the day i wont sleep
there is too much good art i couldnt sleep tonight üòÇ
<:umu:351861443206971392>
better look at elsa pictures for headpats
now i will have nightmares
yeeeeee...
<:monkaS:426558019363405824>
wtf are those legs
if she only knew what she was saying by *singing*
okey i dont think im gonna watch that my heart is not ready
now im scared
i wanted to watch that anime
<:ohnoes:605045639100891136>
not good
it keeps me going and it makes me suffer
the colour choices are great!
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
they really wanna make me believe that i get my maribasa moment
we get teased too much here
<:TsumiLewd:586745848973623316>
ugh i get chills only hearing the violins at the start
<:AYS_soontm:331105078587031552>
or now
i ordered my on cdjapan hope they dont take forever
yeah i saw people on twitter already have her CD
i cant wait for the new one, the violins at the start of her henshin just sound dope
after reading it i just wanted to hug maria
the henshin one isnt translated yet
but only b-side
its on the wiki
the song is so lovely
i finally read the lyrics for marias b-side and it kinda made me sad af
https://youtu.be/18-9GhXcvxo not really xv but idk where else to post it
wait i link it its soo funny
well okita is smol too soo
its golden
there is like a 30minute interview with minase and mizuki nana where minase basically fangirls over her for the whole interview
awwwww
ye she in danmachi
minase?
and then you have minase that just one cute goofball haha
its just so smooth you can relax to
ive been watching too many seiyuu videos on youtube probably
hayamin is also rising
mine are kayano, yoko and probably miyuki
ooof i like you haha
*why you not marry her matsuoka*
shes on my top 3 VAs her roles are just too good
kayanon just sounds too adorable most of the time
the first time i saw them doing time like that i got confused af haha
i cant wait till its out
when all the cast sings <:wew:398568667790573582>
i prefer gyakko no nijiro
ahhh thats a great song
ill chip money in if i can get more seasons üò≠
we will remember you in a song
one for the team
we appreciate your sacrifice nep
im scared
im wearing headphones too
<:rin_sips_tea:422992385207697418>
not gonna click
"so sugita what are you sining for us today?"
i would have done that as a joke
sugita has a sexy voice
id listen to that
i have ordered mine together with basa's so they probably arrive together
ooo luckyyyy
but its probably too small for even that
you can put it on waifu 2x might be worth it not sure
<:yuzu:404589971391905792>
id draw that for money even if i would be grossed out probably
<:kek:525633034716971008>
probably by shirabe
lmaoooo
there are so many flags
but i thought miku would be come a trigger for something
since vanessas message to millarc kinda got offscreened i assume she told her something unexpected and thus she sliced the inspector
i dont think i can focus
<:awe:416029484643254272> <:awe:416029484643254272>
damn hair tied up basa looks really good
dont delete maria <a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
„ÅØ„ÅÑ
altho bikkis new song with that celtic melody had been playing in my playlist for a good while too
~~the only ones i have listened to~~
love when you hear the name in most of her songs
AME NO HABAKIRI
the japanese theme is too catchy
<:aww:419211447915249664> the song is soo good im gonna have that on replay 25/7
*and she will probably never wear jt like that again*
<:tama_waw:412288562831032322>
but basa has great hair
ahhh thats posiible actually <@185949743321579520>
also basa really needs a hug <a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
but now im reallly curious if there is more to airgetlam and its origin
i dont even know where to start
finally watched the episode <:wew:398568667790573582>
where the scorpions crawls into
but at least i finally know what that silver thing in the opening is
i havent done anything since i watched this episode lmao it will only get worse waiting for next week
but im not ready
<:KouHyperThonk:585590089195847699>
what if bikki and miku have a kid, would that have sin
if maria is gonna throw that heroic death for her friend im so done
<:NotLikeBell:591666500096491521>
but im worried if basa is actually gonna fight one of the girls
<:umu:351861443206971392>
we get both
maria says it and then she reminds kanade
didnt she?
i think she said that in the very first episode
its probably gonna be that
or maria giving her some *singing all night*
im not looking forward to that
and there is gonna be more of it im sure
yeah
it cant be unseen
<a:gab_shook:483712946757959680>
she looked so good with that
so im happy
at least it gave me that tied up hair
üòî maria just needs to use more force and tsubasa will give in and let her be patted
lol
yeah thats what i said üòÇ *or been meaning to*
yeah you cant do everything alone, as much as i love maria and her pairing with basa i dont think she will be able to take that role from kanade
my point with square one was just, that she is being worried and stiff again as she seemed to be in s1 right after kanade was gone.
<@476058996315389953> no not at all. im actually happy she still thinks about her and gets mentioned because it would be weird if kanade was just all washed off and forgotten
i mean she knew kanade for much longer than she knew maria and the met when they were still young. i guess that has a bigger impact than anything else
pretty much yeah. back to square one
<@!176508209576673280>  i think that was a nice call that she mentioned her. it shows that she still holds her dear and would want to relay on her even after all the time that has already passed.
i have that number in most of my social media accounts mostly because of the meaning ahah
<:tohrusmug:560195587816030218>
you forgot symphogear 69
omg basa looks like she is close to loosing it in that picture üò≠
well im sure she knows *something* but in this case i think she mostly used it to distract maria from fighting and for us it was a bait so we want to know more
that she said it to distract maria
thats pretty much what chris tried to tell maria as well?
im sure you can achieve it one day
the question is, what does alchemy *not* let you do
wouldnt mind getting arrested by her
but chris was definitly the mvp this episode <a:ChrisBaka:493803773001465866>
also that was a sick move when she evaded the rockets
lool saved that
im already worried
nein
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
<a:wuahmaria:605046493724016640>
ahhh kerrik knows how to ease my soul
same
and the full music video is finally online which looks really good
i cant stop listening to the song its just so addicting
but it could be a flashback tbh thats not even thaaat far off
maybe she went all crazy now
ooof im hyped to find out more about the gear
but why do i feel its too early for basa to be happy
yeah it could be everything üòÇ
<a:yadayada:605078488524783616>
im not ready
miku and bikki kissing <@!279341087494242304>
and ill be damn sad if its not maria but something really trivial ~~which it will probably be~~
im just generally curious what on earth is able to cause her to blush üòÇ
OMG HAPPY BASA
Ooooo
<a:muhahaha:479355281739087883>
not ready
<a:miyanotableslam:557855306881957889>
yesssss!! they better protecc mum and tell sword daddy that she should calm down <@!263983345669505025>
let maria approch basa alone
"stop fighting there is no need" NEIN
me neither ugh
they should resolve it on their own talking some gay stuff
maybe we get chris stepping inbetween the fight
that would be too early
even if those two make up, i dont think the curse on basa will be lifted yet
im biased, id really prefer maria vs. basa
well if they make up maria better say some thing really really gay that makes tsubasa blush that hard
dont think maria would give up on talking to her but she would probably not let herself being shaken off that easy again as when basa smacked her hand away
yeah i think resolving basas issue at the base would be kinda lame
and i doubt maria would talk to her just casually, she is too tsun to approach her in a normal matter. she could probably only talk sense into her when its really imporant and at the verge of death/going crazy
i think removing basas curse should be in some more serious matter and not just casually in the base, so im curious what its all about
like they are at the base
its just *too* early and not in a matter i thought of
*talk*
same im scared on what it will be
that was so epic
the stand with SG was cool but i really really wanna have a team fight and a team song again like in the first episode
its the last season i really wanna see them go out all together
yeah me neither, i really hope they fight together this time, hibiki soloing vanessa was cool but its kinda meh when all the others just stand there and do nothing <@414366682966917120>
yeah taht really sounds like carol
i wonder if hibiki is gonna solo it again and fight alone or if they actually gonna fight all together this time to save miku
*sigh* now i wont be able to focus again for the nesxt 48 hours until i can watch the ep
ahh i thought carol might come up again now that they have captured elfnein
i just need to know how everything is connected about airegtlam and that damn scorpion haha
im still not convinced by this
<:bless:433765005125746688>
<:NenePray:506580513901903873>
yuuuus
that means if there are songs who havent appeared yet that i can get a battle song
she wont probably but i hope this doesnt turn into a huge thing
<:umu:351861443206971392>
but i got your back binnie
anyways time for lunch
let marias feelings reach her
<a:yadayada:605078488524783616>
*did any plan ever make sense tho?*
magic owo
how did that even fit in his fridge
now this is what i need
i need a galloon or so
*glad to be of service*
same
already sipping on my water bottle
<:rin_sips_tea:422992385207697418>
this server is just *reaaally* fueling my imagination
üòÖ
sorry i ruined your image of me kerrik

*just send me some help*
*i think its already waaaaay too late trust me*
at one point basa wont even know that she is controlled
<a:aaueyebrows:548982071755014154>
depends how you apply it
~~she would gently kiss her cheek pls~~
<a:mai_hmph:483737167147827230>
thats what you think
if maria picks up the control word instead of breaking the curse
<:KouHyperThink:585618741396766757>
that brings me to ideas i didnt even imagine so far
indeed
<:tohrusmug:560195587816030218>
going on tour and just have some singing sessions
dont worry they will start building a happy relationship
hidden features in the gear are a thing i think
since they both dont know what excatly they are doing
it would be so akward but in a really adorable way
ikr? it would actually fit quite well
maria would be like "no tsubasa you do that wrong let me show you"
in symphogear it is
shhhh
as a sentinel i mean she kinda has to
i think basa would take top unconciously
hmmmmm
im stuck
*ftw i should actually work but noooooo*
<a:MariaBlush:493803272360951808>
she would underss herself and then be all blushy and flustered "d-dont stare at me that way tsubasa, just come here"
<a:wuahmaria:605046493724016640>
i hope it would be
maybe its marias imagination üòÇ
its too nice of them
why would they show us this in the preview
probably
right now
like
well thats another thing i really gotta know more about
<:thatsmyfetish:462885134656471041>
*she just has to insist a bit more*
this time she wont get rejected
dont worry we know who already tried to pat her last episode
<:8253_RaphtaliaPat:546013212110487553>
giv smol basa headpats
<a:aaueyebrows:548982071755014154>
yknowwww
protection is overrated anyway
lmao
BOOM
*maria*
<:blobwhistle:466348572112191489>
yeah i think thats my fault
and its not going well
god i really gotta try hard not to laugh out loud at work
i mean im sure she is sensitive too
<a:aaueyebrows:548982071755014154>
see still little
she been big bully to little sword
or milaarc
SG and bikki would make a god tier couple
i dont think anyone is acutally gonna die tbh
which i really will a week after the anime ends üòÇ
and riot
i will fly to japan
otherwise
im okey
as long as my otp can live happy
Ooo i still havent watched that anime maybe that would give me an actual reason
i didnt even know of nana that much before the series and now i cant stop listening to her songs
win dess
soooo
i just got it recommended by a friend because i like hikasa yoko and pink haired girls
<:umu:351861443206971392>
geah is just really funny and enjoyable for me i dont really bother with any of its logic
im only here for the *plot*
i think i only read half of that story
daaaamn now thats what we are talking about
<:LuluStare:588629690353188867>
but tbh their ignite modes almost look like some alter version design
*make it stop pls*
indeed
<:KouHyperThink:585618741396766757>
hibiki alter
so you never know
but basa managed to move on too
lol
i know
oof
no one else
leave kiri-chan for shirabe
<a:aaueyebrows:548982071755014154>
i can only imagine what the actual feature of airgetlam is
just ask maria she works at MIB now
paper cuts are the worst tho
together or so
probably from everyone
good i deleted madouka out of my memory
oh hecc no
"im gonna die for the greater good of mankind"
im so sick of this
dont make geah a show that has to kill the mc
<:KouHyperThink:585618741396766757>
sooo
you get loads of cash tho with loods
and my parents would find out üòÇ
im too pure for that
pls dont make me draw hentai
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
thats why
everything juicy was offscreened
but her real love is food
<:TetShrug:327138982720700418>
there is enough characters so everyone can choose their liking
i mean to each their own
mebbeeee
<a:BlobMeltGif:414770582782083072>
yes and then i will ask wfc to send me kanade floof
<:7797_shotakun_cry_sad:546015703392845854>
sumimasen
~~i just cant be bothered with either miku or hibiki, my apologize~~
well hopefully there is some more to it in the second part of the season
but i liked the part about maria being a sloppy alcoholic üòÇ
hmm might finish it
because until the part i read it it wasnt really what i was looking for
cuz i think they went to that alternate universe
is there at least some maria serena moments?
what a shame
rip
oooof
i started reading because i thought its maribasa but then all i got was her and chris
i should finish it some day
id rather meet chris hemsworth
there is no cat in geah tho
well anyway probably better to stick to the XV topic
ye ye we dont need details
<:FumiCross:586664725136408585>
*i need help*
also dreamed about the moon getting destroyed and i think it was full moon yesterday
i swear
for once
it wasnt lewd
stay awake kerrik
all i can remember was me doing floof
<:ZoomEyes:455068581865193486>
yesterday i had kanade in my dream maybe i should really sleep
~~its quarter for me too but thats crappy to write~~
its only 2am
<:FumiCross:586664725136408585>
im not sure if its just really late for me and thats why i dont get it or if im just retarded lol
i guess im second one
sorry uncle
<:02Naruhodo:470411644321660929>
are, they, really, imoortant, tho,?,
i mean im hype too but that just looks like a bit much?
spam?
it has to build up we dont have that many episodes left and i feel like another 100 things still need to happen üòÇ
for me its usually like 10/11
or not
do i like her
see this makes me really torn about millarc
then sleep
gotta stay hydrated
i need water fist
<a:wigglyblobb:611914616942886912> im hyped to hear minase again sounding smuggy af
pretty much that
^^^^
<:zoomEyes:362236969054633984>
what a sight
wow i really always join at the right time
can confirm
it hurts af if you trip in high heels
she can still trip now
nah i dont think she would turn evil again
i dont think carol can solo them all
either in a flashback or will actually comeback
so im sure she will appear somehow
she was at least in the opening
niceee
4k
i buy her
üòÇ
oh god
and i love her hair
omg thats really cute
i guess the guy at the beginning (probs enki), fine and airgetlam all get explained in the same turn
just say im 18+ and then people can guess lmao
i should the the same with my passport
but it would make sense, i mean fudo is old af im sure he has witnessed WW2
Ooo thats interesting i actually dont remember that
lmao ofc millarc would drink that
its just speculation and it might as well all just be a coincidence, not sure if they really planned that far a head, but it could be a thing
chris tried to open it but got hit by the nephilim and then maria took the cane and the opening became like twice as big
yeah miku was the one throwing the cane to close the gate when they were on the beach
nope hibiki didnt. maria was standing there and suddenly serena appeard in some shiny light and they sung the song
yeah but not only that also how airgetlam was manifested and gave everyone some sort of power boost, she was also able to open the gate to that paralell world with solomons cane to seal the nephilim. might just be w coincidence but you never know
also didnt maria say that song was from her grandma? so probably she witnessed the meltdown and gave the song on to maria and serena
i also rewatched the last episode of G yesterday and if airgetlam and marias song really are that special, then the final G episode would make a lot more sense
thats exactly the panel that keeps up my curiosity
<a:miyanotableslam:557855306881957889>
cant wait for that flashback story whatever but i need to know more about everything that happened in marias place
in the elevator right`?
ikr i felt bad
it certainly brings the feelins across without even effort
it was so lit
and i have to find the ost that played int the background
it made me really love the autoscorer
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>  poor garie
i know feels bad
<:teehee:377488729859686400>
i just want to be that bag
<a:moneky_love:453621468907962369>
joining at the right time again
<:zoomEyes:362236969054633984>
üòÇ
probably not
first SG, then the autoscorers and then Ver
i have a feeling they gonna bring back all the characters from previous seasons
<:tohrusmug:560195587816030218>
*as old as you want me to be*
how old are you dino
<:rin_sips_tea:422992385207697418>
worth it üòÇ
i always make my friends pay with the card for discount
i think we have some discounts when you own a special cinema card but i never got around to buy one of those
unfortunately not in my country üòÇ  unless you are like 6 then you only cost half the price
might as well just call myself old then
<:emocat:336655686249480196>
rip me then
<:tohrusmug:560195587816030218>
ofc it would
<:zoomEyes:362236969054633984>
üòÇ
if the name of that gear is even airgetlam
i like her smuggy face
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
awww they should make it with all the geahs
fanservice above all i think
that would have been weird
better than her growing for sure
i wasnt really down to see elfnine a bit lewded like that but i guess its okey
<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
<a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746>
Ohhh thats quite good too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBZmD65Hyhc <a:2303_Rainbow_Weeb:562030696940699669>
i could listen to this all day omg
the beginning is so EPIC
yeah i think it is
imma listen to it know
so good
yeah just the whole background music for when they were fighting
Oo ill check it out kerrik
but it was so well done
when i watched it the first time i was not sure if its intentional or not
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
"oh a new model, i should just crash this one so i can get that new bike"
i think so
ye
only cry at marias shoulder
basa should not cry alone
that scene made me tear up
i suffer every week
since the day solopy posted that pic
im already suffering
thats the day you wont see me outside my corner and cry
<a:aaueyebrows:548982071755014154>
*hammer*
dont worry maria will put her back to place
ah yeah i didnt even think of that üòÇ
so that she can eat burger every day?
i can hear the accent
that actually be really funny
girls who like to eat are best
dont forget food addict
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
i ereased that from my memory
also im jealous of her HUGE tv
bookworm af
miku would forget what happened in one night
problem solved
they could just pay them some love hotels
lmao saving that
she is the one that goes to akiba in disguise so no one finds out she is a weeb
<a:SandyRunning:585585243646459908>
someone help this lost girl
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
and maria prints serena poster with her money
chris gonna spend it on food too
GOHAAN
*heavy breathing*
kiri why you so lewd
fuck
mmmmmm
thank god im not at work anymore for that airgetlam
and i wanted to go to my friends
it just started raining af omg
thank you
bur what if i only had 2 glasses of water today
that bondage scene was just out of this world
too late
<:TsumiLewd:586745848973623316>
dont kill me
oh god kerrik pls
<a:aaueyebrows:548982071755014154>
boob force
i mean itherwise i have to ask how maria practiced that ribbon dancing
<:tohrusmug:560195587816030218>
i wonder how she practiced this
me_irl when there is free food
<a:wuahmaria:605046493724016640>
<:blobwhistle:466348572112191489>
all the girls are *active*
maria just needs catering and her life is okey again
im sure she ate a whole bunch at her birthday party
phrasing is secondary
<:teehee:377488729859686400>
its her concert outfit from ep 2
<a:BlobMeltGif:414770582782083072>
awwwwww
<:gab_thinking:410534442445176834>
also i wouldnt call her alive either i think
i dont think the wiki is that accurate
ahhh well i definitly prefer the newer versions
god the eyes in s1 were huuuge
so i wonder who she sings about
also who do you think the song in tsubasas b-side will be about? its called "ou of the Wind" or something
its sooo good
<:TsumiLewd:586745848973623316>
but glad i already got them local
but i think the quality is not the greatest
well i downloaded them from the wiki
nuuuu
i only ordered maribasa CDs
i wasnt a big fan of the song when it first came out but after the battle with vanessa and maria i really grew to like it
YAHEEEYAAA
i love the japenese themed music
i think first week of september
<a:miyanotableslam:557855306881957889>
i also cant wait for basas full character song from XV
maybe a few OVAs
but im not sure if thats actually gonna be a thing
well that would be my dream and id pay a fortune to make it happen
i think there would be more than enough material for novels
im sure that would be interesting in a novel
id love to see  or read more inner monologes of the girls
well i also read all of the danmachi novels so im really addicted to it
iim watching like 10 but im so behind
i forgot about the rest cuz i was busy doing art lmao
this and danmachi
*i think*
dont worry my walls are thick
which wont be good for my health but oh well
yes! i just want a train recation of things going to shit
i really expect shit to go down from now on, or at least i hope it will
we just get so many hints and build up but nothing has really happened
same and i feel like nothing has happened so far üòÇ
it will all be over soon
just look at your floofy art kerrik
12/10
only for you
dont worry kerrik i will draw fanart for you
<:tohrusmug:560195587816030218>
the nephilhim is his bankai
BAKKEN
then they all get spicy henshins
cuz that was the plan all over
then they team up with fudo
i can see ver making his cameo too
i mean the fact that a lot of previous characters have already appeard in this new season
but im glad she is finally doing something
and i like elfnine its cool that she gets time to shine but she had a whole season
oh not only because of trhat, i just feel like there is a LOT of other stuff we have to see
i just dont want to spend time on elfnine forever
whatever
i hope they conclude the elfnine fight in the first half of next episode, its cool but i dont want to focus on elfnine and her backstory
<:LuluStare:588629690353188867>
<:FumiCross:586664725136408585>
purification
dont think fudo would do that
hopefully not
uhhh
but if that comes true it would be a dream
but yeah ill be happy  *most* things we get this season even if its only small maribasa stuff
<:NotLikeBell:591666500096491521>
not if maria chokes up blood
that second one was NOT okey
i need food to countrer frustration
im out
<:RUN:485994821824282624>
nononononono
oh god
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
anyway <@!263983345669505025> thank you for making me not able to focus for today and make me wanna see something that might never come true
eh
i mean the killing her mother part would be ok but coming out with kanade all out of sudden would be a bit
<:FumiCross:586664725136408585>
just spending time together and being floofy
i dont need sex at all i can totally live with this cheesey vanilla stuff and them saying they love eachother
i want wholesomeness for them most of all
thats how ive been feeling the last 4 weeks
like maria giving her a hug and wiping her tears away is already much much more than i expect we will get
i would alerady be omega happy if we even get something *close* to this
or in blu ray version
the rest will be offscreened
thats how it should be
yes pleassse
>that it's fine and pats Tsubasa's check and gently wipes the tears from her eyes.
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
if she only gets stabbed in the shoulder and doesnt die its ok
OOF
OMG KERRIK
it got delayed i think
the album only comes out in like 3 weeks
nope
i wouldnt mind more kanade, but i dont want basa to go back to fully relay on her. she grew so much since then
well i hope we do get something but im always expecting the lowest
<:lmao:460431788498747392>
inb4 we wont get anything at all
maybe kanade <:gab_thinking:410534442445176834>
and then try to blend out the other stuff
<:rin_flushed:430289006845231104> i only go there when i get pinged
i pretend i saw nothing from the above
<a:BlobMeltGif:414770582782083072>
ahhh yes wholesome
it looked like this nyan cat thingy
what is this
oh god
thanks for the link
for sure
ill check that out
<:zoomEyes:362236969054633984>
or when seiyuus fangirl over eachothers voices
like when kayano flirts with matsuoka
and they arelaways hilarious
they give me life
yes i do
omg zhnk youuuu
i need a hikasa and nana interview
can you link me that
hold on
no dying
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
<a:wuahmaria:605046493724016640>
ill listen to them as soon as i finish work
<:love:404589971601620994>
sank youuu bonnie
i should listen to it i dont think i have yet
i love the tsubasa henshin one the flames are done so well
but its so beautuful
i saw that and i suffer üò´
<:NotLikeBell:591666500096491521>
and i wont be here to watch on saturday
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250> poor basa
<a:bunny_pat:481203799386750998>
its to cut out old characters from previous seasons and insert them in this one
bai baiii
it will be hard not to be spoiled
yes i know
time to mute this channel
oof i wont be able to watch the episode on saturday rippp
miku looked epic tho
or ogawa ninja arts
that would have been epic cypher
i mean fine is in the OP too
but im really done with the god-killer yelling and the fisting into oblivion
id die if maria basa does the final
i wouldnt even mind carol
that would be 3 fights she solos this season
same if that happens im really done
i just hope that at least the final fight of this season will be something they achieve together
i acutally havent read anyones thoughts so no idea what wfc said before üòÇ but yeah the "disconnect" sign on gungnir has to be a thing
and hibiki already soloed the first fight against noble red
the others literally only acted as hibikis shield in the last bit of the fight
üòÇ
but that doesnt mean i have to like it
i know
but im actually a bit done with hibiki coming in and saving the day again. it makes the others look super wewk all the time as if they couldnt do anything without her
loved carols fight and deadalus end was cool to see again
well that certainly was an epic episode
maybe he will fight fudo
well i wonder how they counter god killing miku now that everyone already got rekt
dess
that just calls for a hibimiku combo
no miku
nein
she should be in the final fight too
great....
x drive amlgam and everyone gices hibiki their gear power
pretty much
whats ignite? /s
i wished they fought in x drive a bit longer too
well i clearly havent missed that mich with this episde
my drewms will never come true
UFOtable <:TsumiLewd:586745848973623316>
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
~~also i was in london my wallet is crying~~
*depends how big it is*
ill buy the whole store thank you
<a:wuahmaria:605046493724016640>
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
that sounds good
just send maria to fly by and i jump out the window
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
and i do it for you
save me pls
am at work
basa in a suit looks hot
i think i have some of that saved at home
too much chris/maria <:fuka_unamused:456169451382112257>
i like the flowers in their hair tho it looks pretty
.... <@!263983345669505025>
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
ikr she looks so smuggy
possible tho
<:KouHyperThink:585618741396766757>
basa looks cute in that dress too
<:TsumiLewd:586745848973623316>
YES GIVE ME DAT
<:FumiCross:586664725136408585>
i just brace myself aleardy
eh if its against fudo i at least hope it involves basa
miku hasnt been part of the team so im gonna be really pissed if now *she* does the final
pls make it an everyboday thing
why do you ping me for that even üòÇ
no idea
huh
couldnt be bothered to watch that üòÇ
ahhh
wait where was miku holding that card? in the ending credit or in the henshin?
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
indeed
<:mariapeek:605077178656489472>
**imagine XV budget kanade henshin**
<:TsumiLewd:586745848973623316>
imagine the henshins
everything movie animated would be sick
i need my SoL OVAs
and flooof
with kanade
i want a prequel movie
<a:wuahmaria:605046493724016640>
give movies
*unless* you really kill someone
with how SG is you could easily do more in the future if you ever want to
like id legit drop the show
i doubt that will happen
~~ofc id prefer tsubamari but ofc that will never happen so i just scratch that~~
i wouldnt mind a *only* basa thing, she never got the shine to do a final blow and if there is a time, then its now against fudo
i mean if gungnir really breaks, i can see miku replacing hibiki somehow
im fine if she joins the team and supports them, but id be happier if the final blow is something everybody does or if they really fight against fudo, then let basa do it. as she has the most connection to him
but not with *final punch*
im fine with *involving*
expect from being emotional blast
did she ever do much?
i mean no offense if she is your fave, i just think it would throw the balance of the show off
id be really sad if miku gets more attention than all the other girls who have been fighting alongside for like almost 5 seasons
<:FumizukiCross:588629686381182978>
so we get both in one go
ithought it might even be connected to the whole airgetlam thing
so i expect her to appear
yeah she was at least in the opening
not in SG maybe but otherwise they are funny
miyuki and sugita are a great combo
<:aww:419211447915249664>
id die for miyuki to be in again
well im not sure how big of a part serena actually would play in that whole airgetlam thing but im sure she will talk and have some parts
yeah i dont think it will happen in the next two episodes
i just want my maria/serena back story and see whats up with socrpiotlam
or maybe everything will be relevant again
unless you want ver back as a callback to G
üòÇ
most likely
*hai sensei*
i think i need ot rewatch the last episode
<:ohnoes:605045639100891136>
ah yea
and useless too?
i think its in some other animes nowdays as well
yup
*hibiki will punch her out*
im always down to hear more minase inori
i wouldnt mind
middle of ep 10 is what i give her, but i dont think it needs more
i hope not
i give her until 10
i wouldnt give miku 3 more episodes
thats quite a while
and that specic was extinct as well
but you all are senpais so i trust you üòÇ
cuz they were talking how that thing can get there
i actually think it was too
i was confused why it was frozen
ahh my brain is not working today
where thy found it in the arctic
possible, tho i thought that was the scorpion was the one in episode one
from what vanessa told
but isnt that airgetlam
yeah thats true actually üòÇ
ahhh i dont think i read them enough
but it would be funny if maria is actually related to fine and that wasnt all joke in G
i didnt notice that they made a big thing out of the gear since GX <:gab_thinking:410534442445176834>
<:Lustywave:587986881338277898>
bai bai
anyway time for my drawing course
<:02naruhodo:452766547421954070>
im worried about that horse
lmao
Ooo
well maybe she wants to go car too
did i miss something?
horse?
where basa presents new models and tests them
oh and its a "pimp my ride" show as well
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
thats the main plot
they only cook
and they dont punch in symphogear either
i dont think they will sing in symphogear
lmao
yeah no
<:gab_thinking:410534442445176834>
maybe i will like it more
because people like it
i mean cliches are repetitive for a thing
otherwise it wouldnt be working that well
thats probably exact what the viewers wont
hmmm maybe but i still think it sounds really lit and brings the feelings across
<:wew:398568667790573582>
oml
imagine geah with sawano soundtrack
<:kek:525633034716971008>
the moon is actually the death star or thanos coming back to get his gunlet
jp fans in general are quite positive towards their series and animes i barely saw them hating around
its a pinyata
like everyone is busy and went their own ways but they come back together for a special event or so
but a few years later would be nice
or just in general this next gen thing. not really my cup of tea
a few years time skip would be cool. usually the ones like 10 years in the future go wrong
i wouldnt mind a prolouge either
tsubamari on world tour
they can be ok but it highly depends on the name for me
~~and maybe an onsen OVA~~
i just want some cute stuff
<:rin_sips_tea:422992385207697418>
lmaoo
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
get me slice of life spin off series
then
i still like the idea that all the greas might break and out wielders can just go back to daily normal life
it will be funny if miku can fight back shem-ha and regain control over her body
huh that be a bit out of the blue
more cenocide is always appreciated
im okey with that
at this point tsubasa might prefer to be snapped and just be done with all this shit
then miku becomes the next gungnir user and continues hibikis legacy
well they can always go and find the gunlet
to make the struggle real
one of each pairing
<:KouHyperThink:585618741396766757>
*and then a thanos snap*
i wouldnt care what kind of asspull they do but if she were to make a comeback like that i die
thats a worse cliffhanger than the no game no life ending
OML
<:rin_sips_tea:422992385207697418>
maria can wear light
but that stich is great
ty ty its actually quite hot today
<:monkaS:426558019363405824>
the second one is
<:TsumiLewd:586745848973623316>
hello mommy
throw some colours together
ill uh
<a:aauNeptuneNod:586613670579273778>
we can pay you in fanart millhi
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
ugh dont mention the end
the part from ep one was just so epic
i need it
yusss
its such an epic song
someone give me that scan
YES NEEDS THAT SONG
greatness
<:shade_eugen:454997846958014484>
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
cant have enough of that
i would love maria in training outfit
i mean
it will just be the geah against shem ha and maybe some inner monologue miku
that makes me even more sad
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
i think you saw that in episode 3 or 4
eh
but her dad and gen?
i mean i get fudo
same with the panel for DMJii
arent chris parents also in the opening? so far i dont think we got any reference bqck to them either
i think it would make a lot of sense to pht her in the opening
i mean tsubasa has mentioned kanade a few times which even gen noticed that its weird
seeing tsubasas dad behind her is odd enough
but having fudo behind kanades death would just give basa the final headshot
hopefully not
if she really worked for fudo they either brainwashed her good af or she should get an oscar for acting
i actually thought about something like that before. not that she worked for fudo, but that fudo set the attack up to kill her
id give it until 9.5
that picture of tsubamaria "training" is still best
<:okita_ded:422983892375699461>
i also want an apple or a tomato
thank you
if there is ever a scene where maria wears that for more than 5 minutes
i would defo die from dehydration , not even questioning that <@486087033652248576>
doesnt need to die for that
i mean that could also be a cameo when tsubasa is alive
üò≠
god
at least it would put an end to all her suffering and be happy with kanade but i cant imagine the others to live happy without her
its too bitter sweet idk if i could handle that
<:NenePray:506580513901903873>
for how much brainwashed basa keeps mentioning her
im already happy if shed actually appear in a cameo
are they online somehwere?
<:monkaS:426558019363405824>
i dont think ive listend to those kanade songs yet
time to find some god tier animator
id make that my ringtone
oh dear
or miku
inb4 kanade is in a preview image
if kanade returns someone has to go check on him
a voice cameo would be awesome even if she only says "tsubasa"
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
i think ove got too many hopes for the few episodes left
*again*
then hibiki sees SG
so maybe
they see mammu in the opening
mum? maybe
i could see them getting messages in the final fight to get some power up or so
i know it has but yeha i think hibiki telling tsubasa is half as emotional as tsubasa standing in from of kanade
that gives hibiki just too much of attention and i think the feelings wont come across that well
chris with her parents too
get them all knocked out and speak to their parts
i dont want bikki to be the messanger tho
<a:wigglyblobb:611914616942886912>
she looks like she grew older by like 5 years at least
that picture is so astethic <:TsumiLewd:586745848973623316>
damn i dont have more jigglypuff art on my phone
pls no
oh god
"run away like i did"
but i did kinda expect something else for this episdode
well as long as she is not the very last boss im okey
i really dont want shem ha to be benched until she becomes the last boss
not really sure how i feel about these preview images, i just feel like it took out the drive, i mean its cool to see fudo and ffreaking gen fighiting but i really hoped for shema ha and just finish that
and not fudo
at the end shem-ha really is the last boss
meh
doens look like it now
i was expecting an epic all out fight the whole episode
oh god that just sounds really bad
really
wait
<a:BlobMeltGif:414770582782083072>
<a:pat:416723290007273486>
she is too cute and precious
yeah if any of them has to make it, then its her
~~that is a very true argument~~
they either try to turn to SONG or maybe SHEM-HA to make them completly human again
loool elza just has the best expressions
<:gab_peek:410534442457759744>
if millaarc dies will the curse be lifted
both. just to troll us really bad when we thought its a meme episode
i hope it will at least involve her curse and the others finding out about it
i feel like im drifting fruther and further away from my tsubamari happy end
i just need to blend out the title
like its either memey af or epic as hell
no idea üòÇ  im just gonna expect everything and nothing in this episode
no
yeah the rest is just
im still not sure how serious i should take this
a new emote
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
the episode title puts me so off üòÇ
probably
yeah im not really a fan, so far it looks like they take the whole momentum out
where do you actually read all these keywords? on the website as well?
the blue flames look so epic
lool
its dead at work so i might do one
hmmmmm
samuel's phrase is just priceless everytime he says it üòÇ
and everyone be like wtf
gen attacking fudo but then tsubasa jumps in between protecting fudo
that would be sick
so im not really a fan of them
im just not a fan because most redeption i know have been handled really poorly
ahh yeah i can live with that
i honestly dont want him to redeem himself
<:araara:590142404837769236>
lmao
ahhh so there are the new ones from episode 8
Ooo
im just not a fan of him AT ALL so i can perfectly live without him
i dont want him to give hibiki the dad talk and spend like 5 minutes
<@!476058996315389953> i feel you, i also wish we wouldnt see him. not sure how i feel about that
so now is the perfect time
it has to happen eventually
<:WhatIsLife:586616453399314432>
but i can see basa fighting for fudo since she is in the last frame
then i dont think its gen vs fudo
yeah i was about to say if they are in order
sayonara  shishou
take care cin
yeah same for me tomorrow evening
if she manages to have that floofy hair with never washing it, i really gotta know the secret
<:ZoomEyes:455068581865193486>
i mean its not hard to catch people with that floofy hair
thanks for sharing
<a:wigglyblobb:611914616942886912>
ahhh the song sounds sooo cool
looool i wouldnt mind üòÇ
apparently in the radio they did or so
i blame kerrik for it
if i have to witness that i need like 150% yuri afterwards
<a:yadayada:605078488524783616>
oh no
because i wanted to believe in my yuri ships <a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
after this preview i believe everything is possible
<a:aaueyebrows:548982071755014154>
or they hinting at ver
gg
tfw change the future is playing on my phone and i see that gif
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
that was a good scene
more time to make the henshins godtier <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
topdad doing something really good would make it even worse i think, the fact that they give him screentime to redeem him
for once, im not really suffering but it would be funny if miku  just was gone
ü•Å
but it would be really hilarious <:lmao:460431788498747392>
"who is miku?"
i think i generally didnt pay attention in that scene lol
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
just give us a call back that he is somewhere
^this
yes pls
by dying?
or *wanted* more
i didnt really expected more
i thought the phone call already settled his appearance
<:rin_sips_tea:422992385207697418>
ver riding the giant
i dont want topdad nor ver but i cant stop meming around
i blame wfc for getting me back on the kanade hype train, i really want her to come back
<:lmao:460431788498747392>
so ver
<:KouHyperThink:585618741396766757>
time to add red clowing eyes
Ooo you got the shaking pic
bai bai
sad life
ah yeah thats true we cant even make it a server emote
i have an idea
OH WAIT
cuz idk how to do that
<a:fudou_in_a_nutshell:617320962450259978>
so uhh i made a gif emote
the "all for one" part in the anime was a bit cooler because they were like proper shouting but overall its a great song
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
but thanks for sharing the new song! i already cant stop listening
<@!263983345669505025> <a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
yeah i also expected her to get rekt real bad before tsubasa noticed what she did
tbh when you saw the blood flashing scene i was sure that was the end for maria for a few seconds
that was <:wew:398568667790573582>
the one where she blocked with both daggers
pls dont bring ver back
poor NR i didnt think they would go down like that
<:TetShrug:327138982720700418>
i mean to each their own
he is my hero if he stays dead
animes need to sell so why would you shoot your own leg and make them not cute
make the girls look like ver and we never would have gotten more than one season
but i wonder if the geahs present can reach NR before they die or if we gonna see them again at all
<:tohrusmug:560195587816030218>
*jus cuz i can*
and my english sucks today üòÇ
i thought NR was very likeable and their reason for doing what they did was easy to follow and ubderstand
<a:yadayada:605078488524783616>
those would be the only ones with reasonable stand characters
it would be cool doe
so it would be hard for them to show up unless they dont say a word
chris parents also dont habe voices so far i think
not everyone has a ghost tho
internet pls work üò´
this was tsubasas arc and it would have fitted perfectly
this was tsubasas arc and it would have fitted perfectly
i dont really see it
not sure if a next time would fit
as much as i wish for it, this would have been the best opportunity
<@!327840556959006720> like this? https://twitter.com/KanaTubaFANCLUB/status/1150856097902628864
giving her some power like Saint Germain did to hibiki
that would have been really pretty
i think it was from the moon nkt the ground
BUT
i dont think they meant kanade and serena in those
yeah i think about that too
if thats what you mean
well i dont think anyone dies
need a bit more practice until i can do sloppy work that looks good
well thats true, but even my sketches look bad üòÇ
but first i need to do some kanades cuz wfc sure is addicting
one day when im better, i will do comics
id say thats wose
well maria saw serena die before her eyes but tsubasa literally held kanade in her arms and her dad caught a bulltet
safe and sound
maria can sing her to sleep
well marias shit is probably still coming when we find out the truth behind her gear
maria will treat her well i hope <:rin_sips_tea:422992385207697418>
and process that he is dead
<:FumiCross:586664725136408585>
she also has to go to her dads funeral
specially the last row
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
this is not okey for my mental state
okey
bai bai <a:WavingU556:588920734508908565>
yeah but i actually *liked* him, and thats not okey for all the shit he done
basa sure would cry again if she appears
if that is really the case and kanade is in with new voice lines, i wouldnt say no to it
i think ive only listened to Maria b-side so far
i rather have a full epilogue than just still frames in a credit scene
i really hope we get an epilogue that takes more than just 5 minutes
<:rin_sips_tea:422992385207697418>
*to wait or to listen*
hmmm
<:FumiCross:586664725136408585>
fudo is mostly still alive because gen stepped inbetween. not sure how that would have ended for him is he didnt
i thought that was shiro who said people die when they are killed
i mean if you get shot right through the heart i dont think there is much first aid you can really provide
not sure about that <:gab_thinking:410534442445176834>
i mean there are still other people alive who she loves soooo....
I... hope not
oof not sure if i wanna read them then <a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
poor tsurugi <a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
lol
yeah thats what i mean
not sure if we already see tmr <:gab_thinking:410534442445176834> i assume we will get a hint but i can see the main thing coming in ep 11
i guess so...
<:monkaS:426558019363405824>
unless she needs her gear for a reason or so
the only one left is shem ha and she doesnt look like she is interested in that
but i could be wrong
i think they come with the blu ray releases
hopefully work is dead again so i can get time to look
i really need to stop reading too much into them üòÇ last week was really misleading too from the images
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
as long as waifu is okey im okey too
a fusion would be cool
<:NotLikeBell:591666500096491521>
im scared or previews
after last week when i thought its gonna be a meme episode
then that giant thing could just be vanessa as a huge mecha?
so if noble red is not dead and millaarc is fucking up maria
also the way they carry yatsuhiro gives me the impression he is still alive somewhat
üòÇ
yeah lmao i wonder what that is
also why are marias scars already gone from her face, that was quick recovery
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
im not ready if maria gets shot
not good
oh no
looks more like a giant robot to me honestly
ehh i dont think she will die
is that airgetlam going crazy?
*is scared*
<:RUN:485994821824282624>
time for lunch first
thank you!!
yeah that probably happened at the same time and it helped with getting ride of the curse
pheeeew
ahh good
dont bring him back
oh noes
ahh yeah i was thinking of that one
im not convinced by that smile is scary
but im not sure if i understood that right just there
and i remember someone has brought that up before the preview as a theory
i thought solopy meant that miku is deleted as in she never existed and no one knows about her
lool i havent read the keywords yet but the theory that she just never existed is not far off then?
considering vanessa knew about airgeltam being special the other NR members probably know about that too
but then again millaarc crushed her so it might just be NR
i honestly thought it looks like maria too, it reminded me of how she went bersek in GX and that shirabe/kiri are the one standing infront of her would kinda make sense too <@279341087494242304>
<:rin_sips_tea:422992385207697418>
i would make a comment but then kerrik would probably hand me a bottle of water again
<:02naruhodo:452766547421954070>
*did you like shirtless fudo*
<:rin_sips_tea:422992385207697418>
why
ohnoes
<:FumiCross:586664725136408585>
i mean guessing from the preview it will quite blow up anyway
<a:BlobFireAnimated:463283950916337674>
"here fudo a present for you"
now that would be something
<:FumiCross:586664725136408585>
she takes over the bulli torach from her wife
well i guess we gonna get amalgam x drive or something. since we already used normal x drive for this season, they have to top it
wouldnt really make sense to the story
probs not
neh
i dont think they are gonna do that tbh. most likely they only gonna use amalgam
dont think they can fit ignite *and* amalgam
i dont think maria is much better at these quizzes than tsubasa üòÇ
what that? üòÇ
*thank you fairy tail* <:reeeee:463891513030475786>
ive watchced to many anime where they come back from the dead or just dont die at all
if yatsuhiro isnt really dead, then i dont understand her b-side song at all
but i guess we just gotta wait and see what happens <:kek:525633034716971008>
my girl looks just like she got crushed
i mean
<:rin_sips_tea:422992385207697418>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
~~now its getting real dark~~
sorry to hear that man
but he still far
well at least we are in the same continent
^
dont remind me
ah yeah life <:FumiCross:586664725136408585>
geah was my to go anime when i had a shit day
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250> jusr gonna cry when its over
nah i like that we came all the way here to 5 seasons
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
naaah it was some hidden ogawa ninja art
bai bai
seam
^ id be really sad just because of the song that wouldnt make sense anymore
<:TsumiLewd:586745848973623316>
ok so i just saw the episode and i just want to say goodbye cuz im gonna die in peace now
yes best
dont jinx it
but an actual epiloge episode would have been lovely
i hope its at least more than 5 üòÇ
wonder how thats all gonna fit in 2 eps with a last fight and *hopefully* a nice epilogue
ahh that would work out as well
and the feeling that chris might just blow things up
i can see things coming a bit short with only two eps left
yeah i feel they still have to close the circle and bring her hup again
yeah if she were to appear now, she would have to talk otherwise it be kinda odd
but yeah im still waiting for apple otherwise id be kinda dissapointed if all the hints just were for nothing
if its not miyuki im dissapointed üòÇ
also do you guys think that was it for flashbacks? i was still hoping to see fin√© since she was in the opening and that panel wit maria/serena with the gasmasks doesnt really make sense so far either
yep üòÇ
from episode 9?
i was already about to take the fireworks out
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
kerrik with the gifs <:wew:398568667790573582>
madlad <:wew:398568667790573582>
Oooo
on my site enki was in the thumbnail and i literally scrolled past the episode because it didnt look familiar
i still kinda hope the gears are gonna get destroyed and our wielders can go back to normal lifes
jk i really dont want an ova ending
its symphogear doe
id be fine with ova if jts an onsen one
lmao
<a:BlobMeltGif:414770582782083072>
i want my wholesome epilogue
but but üò≠
but i really really would want an epilogue foe this series
i mean sure they are great
nooo
üò≠
*they probaly think that already tho*
people will think im weird
i need to watch out not to fangirl too much
<:wew:398568667790573582>
<:AnnieDead:594231261183213673> its monday, im at work and still not over that episode
but lolis are like different lmao
they are minors yeah
i dont think they are lolis
otherwise id be dead ages ago
they only come after you if they were lolis
<:monkaS:426558019363405824>
does dino even know what sort of bottle that is?
<:rin_sips_tea:422992385207697418>
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
also need a water bottle
do you
<a:wuahmaria:605046493724016640>
i got literally everything i wanted and even what i didnt even *know* i wanted it
i dont think it can get even more awsoeme for me
i lost my shit at the ignition part
<:TsumiLewd:586745848973623316>
and i never expected the song to come back either
that performance was really sick
<a:wuahmaria:605046493724016640>
it was so cool
oh yeah i saw that performace
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
its the bew attack on titan key visual
cuz its wholesome
nah thirst for wholesome ness is ok
<a:moneky_love:453621468907962369>
it was great
IGNITION!
everything just really fit its great
<:TsumiLewd:586745848973623316>
listening to it right now actually haha
god its such a good song
üî•
i wouldnt mind shemha
*like a gentle fist*
i love her smuggy voice its great
ehh it wasnt that fanservicy i think but im just really happy inori came back
i think its a bit too late for carol to appear again but i wouldnt mind more inori songs
well then
ehh well there are some good and unique ones which arent your generic isekai
*cries over light novel animes that never even got a season two*
i can hear the plates crashing
shed be drunk before that
maria cant even finish a shot
"hai maria onee-sama"
no she is ready to smash something
rekt
like the
i want that as my avatar
<a:HestiaBaka:394898174793482260>
no bulli
i also think she is just the most lady like with how she dresses up and everything else she mentiones in Stand up! Lady!
and im not gonna pick an "my waifu is better than yours" argument
hey i mean i can like who i want
*silently agrees*
would be kinda weird and i dont really see what its about fine
ehh not sure about that
thats also possible
it might or we might not get everything i listed
that sounds like so much if you wanna do it right and give everything enough screen time
i have honestly no idea üòÇ  we still have to see
-Apple being relevant
- fin√©? i guess it would make sense
- fight shem-ha 
- chris going amalgam and probably blow something up
- and hopefully an epiloge
<:lmao:460431788498747392>
i dont know what hibiki is gonna punch but im sure it will be at least something
i like subtle hints in writing
well probably better to make it less obvious and the people who know geah will probably love it
neat!
oooo
<:umu:351861443206971392>
im sure you could find a way to use gear in that assignment
<a:Bingo:535715455650758676>
gg
just write something about symphogear
thank god it was acutally dead as well
i remember for the preview images of epiosde nine i didnt do anything all morning at work
ooof good luck
i still want my apple backstory
and i lost my beans when i watched the ep
and last week was the best decision to go in without having seen any preview and any picture on twitter
well there is the fact that they come out friday morning for me and i legit cant focus on work anymore after they are out üòÇ
oof i think i might go in without them
for the previews?
i got two bottles in my room
thank you sir i can do that perfectly
now om going to look for my bottle and then actually sleep
preach
<a:aauNeptuneNod:586613670579273778>
~~but i prefer her thighs more~~
i find them okey they have a good size
goals
def
nope
<@195919956918009856> YES!
she didnt really grow up there
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
so it only makes sense that they face off eachother
when they looked at the red earth
i mean vanessa stood behind hibiki and chris in the last panel
<:monkaS:426558019363405824>
they had symphogear swiss knifes on amiami as merchandise before
i wish i had a maria swiss knife üòî
i kinda hope so
ooof but you did well voyeur
so im just a bit confused if there is gonna be more in this last episode or not
but i dont think that got fully explained
its probably the tschernobyl incident
~~if i have to die everyone else has to die as well~~
like that doesnt really add up until now
with the gasmasks
im still confused doe why smol maira and serena are in that opening shot tho
about that
i always thought there would be more
or maybe not a question but like, i felt "apple" was hinted quite havenly and it feels like everything there was to it was that short explaination shemha gave
okey but i have one question
im down for group rewatch
yesss
the hair is so gorgous <:aww:419211447915249664>
also did they got longer hair no? like it looked like kiri ust got long hair
that was a sick entry
but damn that ex drive looks hot
and i also really felt for NR
but it was epic
no i think im fine
i dont even know where to start
<a:oof:524680622363508738>
ooof okey finally watched the episode
<a:BlobMeltGif:414770582782083072>
and its been great
im glad i was here for most of the season
its oke we all just gonna cry
use your phone
i dont wanna cry alone
can we all cry in voice chat please
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
i dont want it to end
but at the same time
i want to hybernate until next week
<:AYS_waterbottle:363959788813680640>
<a:miyanotableslam:557855306881957889>
i really need art now with shiny hair
i wonder if they gonna finish off with a metanoia attack since we usually got that in the last seasons
oof
ok time to rewacht the last scene
than dying
i think amnesia is even worse
yeah i can see them vanishing honestly
nuuuuu
i was like
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
yeah when elfnine said she gonna burn her memories too
but i hope carol joins them in kicking shem has ass
or they sing the song again to connect the people a second time
that could be it
and plays a big role
so i always thought its significant
its like literally the first shot
i mean i dont really need one but why was it so strong in the opening
that wasnt touched any further either
i also remember maria mentioned a "music miracle in her hometown" in episode two after the concert
WE CAN ALWAYS HYPE ABOUT THE LAST EP
shhhhhh
sighhh
and now i reget not naming them maria and tsubasa
sometimes i feel like my cat is a spider too she always wants to climb walls
awww
i go on vacation a lot too and i always feel bad about my cats
<@!189146272865845248> <:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
<:youhaveapoint:432701754220740608>
im your friend

i only got my bf who is super weeby too but he doesnt live in my country
and socialise there
but i have to work unfortunately
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
this is why i got myself two cats
yeah
at lest not the ones that understnad that im thirsty for singing 2D lesbians
i dont
no
id be down to watch the last ep togheter
~~mostly because i dont have friends to talk to ir~~
i really got used to discord
<:tama_waw:412288562831032322>
but you so nice
awwww
shame on me
even tho i caught up to AXZ last year
i dont know why i never looked for a symohogear discord
<a:BlobMeltGif:414770582782083072>
then they meet up
chris at college, tsubamari on tour and the rest at lydia school
SoL spin off
wouldnt mind that either
but with the final fight taking part in the last episode, i really hope we get some time for a least *a little bit* of an epilogue
then got blown up lmao
he was a celestal but actually he was a whole planet
from gurdians of the glaxy
thought there might be more about that scorip crawling into airgetlam and the one  they found in the arctic
ahh yeah that makes sense
with that weird scorpion
probably
gg
she went to the net only to find her lewds
<:gab_thinking:410534442445176834>
was that ever explained
ah yeah about that, why was she even in the arctic
<:lmao:460431788498747392>
blue screen
and then fatal errors
we can beat her if we just stay shut ins and dont talk to other people
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
or just do windows updates
plug out the power supply
now i can at least go on twitter again
and shiny basa was lovely too
she looks gorgous
with her long hair
shini kirika is best i think
<:AYS_waterbottle:363959788813680640>
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
cmon visqi
i really want shiny ex drive art
that b track made me go big OOF
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
i also wanna see tsubasa going to yatsuhiros grave kinda since she didnt even manage to go to the funeral and specially after mentioning him again in this episode
that be sweet
he can train with hibiki
im still waiting for them to actually sing all night in the epilogue
<a:BlobMeltGif:414770582782083072>
i just wanna see maria and tsubasa practice together
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
yes give me maria benchpress
okey thats sick art work
i still kinda wish the gears get destroyed for beathing shem ha so they dont have to fight anymore
so just a comfy wholesome spin off anime
slice of life
triple wedding
tsubasa is looking at them everyday
i almost forgot about that yea
no im just always thirsty for hot girls
and i hate my ipad
right time
t the
wow i always join an
boobs are hrd to draw
i dont draw horny stuff doe
probably is
if we are already here
~~if you use search function for orca im sure you find it yourself~~
ok
its an animal
is it like the orca?
i dont even wanna know
probably but those are the best ones
unless its maria
yep...
the thirst must go on
someone give him a bottle
kerrik is the lewdest deep doen
a drill that pierces the heaven
sword needs to be touched gentle
nonono stay wholesome
oh no
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
do not mention this
gay power
chocolate and ice cream
yeah you will find it and wish you never wanted to know
nein
ok that would be lit
just dont kill her
thats ok
yeah dont kill cute elfnine thats too cruel
dun kill cute genocide
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
<:monkaS:426558019363405824>
thats not okey
please dont make elfnine hot
oh no
but i know i will be sad as hell
i dont think im gonna be dissapointed knowing SG
then fight over and epiloge
i just want epic kick ass explosions
hopefully not
honestly
yay...
first time i cried in that season
unfortunately
yep...
<a:miyanotableslam:557855306881957889>
with braid
either that or her actual XDU kimono skin
<a:BlobMeltGif:414770582782083072>
because i like how she tied it up
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/610203466140483588/610204832715767849/032x.png <@!189146272865845248> with this hair
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
so i dont wanna watch it
<a:MariaShake:493803268850319360>
and tsubasa is bustier than chris
feels so wrong
but like at the same point i dont wanna imagne them adult
im ok if tsubamari at least bring their daughter
nein dont kill the girls wtf
everyone will be milfed <:FumiCross:586664725136408585>
oh god i dont wanna imagine them 10 years later
and they can return to normal life
so there is no reason for them to fight anymore in the future
im ok if the gears get destroyed
nein
<:FumiCross:586664725136408585>
<:FumiCross:586664725136408585>
<a:yadayada:605078488524783616>
oh noes
*sadness*
epiloge will probably just be an after credit scene at this point or still frames in the ending
ehh id be kinda dissapointed if they leave it in the air on purpose for XDU
to be really done well
but this time i really think the last episode is gonna be too short for all the stuff that we need to go through
and if we dont get it, i just gonna be confused forever
if we get it, it will be rushed and probably weird
yeah either way i dont think its gonna go well
unless the next episode actually starts with a flashback before we go into the fight, i could *kinda* see that ~~or maybe its just my fangirl fantasies~~
so many hints and cliffhangers just for there to be nothing but dust
yeah i hate when they tease something big and then its just literally nothing
ill be hella confused
so like if i dont get that maria panel in the opening explained
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
for all the hints and forshadoing we got
really dissapointing to me
which was like
yeah
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
i really hoped for something cool
or something we gotta make up ourselves
yeah i think so too
and i still dont get the scorpion thing
or like i hoped it would have a bigger effect
i also thought airgetlam be more relevant
unless maria remembers some words for shema next ep
also iirc maria mentioned a  "music miracle" in her home town at the end of the concert in episode two, that wasnt futher touched either so far
but like apple was hinted as *such a big thing* if the few words from shem ha in the last episode were everything we get to it, i would really be dissapointed
that would also be something nice
as like green shine on kiris blond/yellow hair
just doesnt look as cool
the white shine on pink
marias hair didnt look that impressive
unfortunately from the shot in the last episode
expect maybe maria backstory since im still confused about apples relevance and that maria/serena shot in the opening with the gasmasks
everything else now is just a great addition
i got everything i wanted
after ep 11 the season basically ended for me
*im just gonna sit here and enjoy my tsubamari duets*
<:shade_eugen:454997846958014484>
<:FumiCross:586664725136408585>
im just gonna post these cross emojis
<:FumiCross:586664725136408585>
but dont bring that after 5 season
that would be a okey twist for a few episodes
and maria is hibikis emotion that likes tomatoes?
probably
<:youhaveapoint:432701754220740608>
yeah and maybe kanade dying was imagination as well
then im ok
kanade wouldnt have died
if that means
i mean
and trust my my cat just gonna stick at you with her claws
<:mariagun:605077387293622283>
or i throw my cats after you
<:stare:443678279497547776>
dont bulli
im a cat lady too
OI
i would be fine with a few actual OVAs yeah
with chibis
rather than just the shorts
i think its more that i would really enjoy seeing a bit more shinais in actual animation
a different cast would not really be fullfill the puropse, at least for me 
but yeah a good slice of life needs a good plot to be enjoyable
i think i would just view them as two completely different entities and make a cut
pleaseeee
can i hear maria doing a crazy laugh like yoko always does
just make it in the XDU universe where no one dies
and are wasted
they all take only one sip
with the hot temperature
its easy to get drunk with sake in an onsen
just get drunk *at* the onsen
well the legal ones at least
drunk gears
yes
yes yes yes
cute school life
like
i just need
i dont need arcs
make 100 more seasons
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
why only stop at 15
~~maybe they can finally use the hidden features for extra phonic gain~~
nah so far there wasnt really hint and i dont really see it either but it would be a good reason to give the wielders a happy ending without ever having to fight again
i can see a callback to G that they sing a song with the whole world again
sometimes i have really weird reasons to like something
but i include myself int that
well that is true
everyone i meet today has some strange reasons to not like things
dess.
yeah im not a big fan of making a kiss resolve the whole thing
ahhh i mean isnt that kinda stereotype? the "i force you out of my own body" i knida expected that is whats going to happen
DMJii at best
what is her prediction
and really cute
that one was glorious
like the shinais are adorable but like, everytime i wished it was like the normal series animation
<:NeneSigh:585556383462588447>
time to chug holy water
thanks guys
i was so pure until now
why do i not have hyper cross
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
not convinced
or do i
i better not click the spoiler tjen
<:FumiCross:586664725136408585>
oh shit
*feelsbad*
tfw maria feels closer to a rock and hugging it than tsubasa
i uh just gonna mute this until the episode drops lmao
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938> what did i even read through in this channel
it feels so tame in the actual song
i love how the all grunt and yell
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
was a bit more epic than the actual song
i really loved the version they had in the anime
ayeeee
and all for one
one for all
is this the moment where we play rikka ryoran and sing
~~it would also be waay less entertaining for everyone~~
<:AkagiLUL:531988392699887616>
i wont stop being thirst
hence
loool i can never be satisfied
~~dont worry im sure its my fault too~~
<@486087033652248576> <:AYS_waterbottle:363959788813680640>
completing tje sentence
that you can hear every single one of the girls
the coolest part is
i love it
its so cool
i watch that all the tine
YES
ouch
nuuu
oh dear
https://twitter.com/ohkuboyoshiyuki/status/1153589680241139713?s=19
and it was like right there
just had to search for "kiri"
wow that was easy
lets go search function
because i know i sent it to a friend
okey wait maybe i can find it
oof its been like forever since that tweet i dont even know who posted it
really wished that was in it
were great
the additional frames they posted on twitter once
and also cut short 20 seconds
<:TsumiLewd:586745848973623316>
sure
*thank you topdad for elaborating this*
and it goes <a:wa2k:511249483636539434>
i picutre the story in my head
now everytime someone brings that up
*i really shouldnt have read wfc's fanfics about tsubamari*
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
i need happy geah ending
n-no!
<:FumiCross:586664725136408585>
gotta love how everyone just memes the endgame now
yes send
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<a:umaru_cry:466335709075210250>
nein
i really need a xv fanfic where marias scars stay permanent and tsubasa feeling bad about making them
but fancontent is occupied
or no one
but yeah i either have them all sing their songs
~~confession, i havent even listened to either hibikis nor chris~~
i really love marias as well
and as biased as i am
basa's is really really pretty
ahh well id be kinda dissapointed if only hibiki gets to sing
besides has anyone else really sung their b-track?
im just not a fan of everyone else just standing there and just watching hibiki solo *again* this season
well i still hope it will be a team effort or hibiki and *just literally anyone*
they can run away and watch the scene from far away
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
you could say so
and i dont even mind if hibiki solos the fight anymore
but that was def my most hype moment so far
not that i would mind more tsubamari
thanks to episode 11
dont worry
i already got my happy end
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
thanos can stay were he is
no thank you
<:FumiCross:586664725136408585>

it wasnt explained and i dont think at this point it was neeed at all
you might as well could have skiped it tho
was for nothing
the scrorpion
lmao
yeah that too
its the literal first shot of the opening and it never properly got explaind
it felt really loose
but like
yea
like did i miss something?
okey its over and im still confused on wtf this was all about
sigh
i wanted an epilogue
ooof im sad but entirley not satifsfied at all lmao
there goes my dream of a group effort win against shem ha
yeah i get that, but i honestly there would be more after all the hints it good and how big they made it sound like <@354402389282783235>
i wished there was more after story and you see the girls in a short time skip a few months after all the events
eehhhh
even a minute would be fine
for extra
just a epiloge in the blue ray
hooo that would be lovely mel
im glad we was basa at the grave i really wanted that, but i wished they showed a bit more
NANA FUCKEN WILLS IT
PREAAAACH
sorry mate its too late im not gonna voice anymore
not even maria can fix it
kek
but if we had a proper epiloge we might would have know
they all still got theirs
nope they artent probably
the thirst died
now its just sadness
i think im already over the pain part
let me drown in salt
<:sipmaria:626782086828654612>
