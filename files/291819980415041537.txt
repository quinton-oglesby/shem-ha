Aaand somebody snipes my raid. Great...
I'm always looking for gigas...
Yay its a miracle!
Aside from skill, what determines you getting Giga Miracles aside from damage and getting the kill? Because I do aid requests for green carol, do like 100k damage without killing, and I randomly get Giga Miracles...
Tsubasa would be Long/Great Sword.
Chris is all gunner and bow.
Shirabe would be dual blades.
Kirika is Switch Axe.
Maria would be Sword and Shield/Charge Blade considering how she can place her sword into her arm.
As for Hibiki...I'm thinking (Gun) Lance because of how her gear works. The turbines charge up and unleash a powerful blow.
Dat Marinade...
Although, I would like to see the other one...
No that works too. Thanks. ^_^
That's ok, take your time. It isn't urgent. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Does anyone have that render of Zesshoushinai Chris where she's showing Kirika and Shirabe around the school? She's posed like <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I see Maria...and I see Bowsette...has anyone done a Mariette yet? I swear the hair...
Anybody got a render of summer gear Cagliostro from XDU? Preferably the one where she's winking and specifically in size 225 x 350?
