i mean i'm down either way i just wanted to be somewhat productive in this server lol
i was thinking it'd be labeled like. :ChrisSleepy: or something along those lines
and i think it'd make a good emote
an attempt was made
i think its just my discord so i'll just
i tried to isolate Chris from her birthday comic
is image submission for this channel mods only or is my discord being screwy
it does, thank you

she deserves pets
That's a fair concern.
There's a difference between a surface level spoiler - like a Kamen Rider Suit - and an _**actual**_ spoiler.
So the same should apply to other forms of media, no?
I mean we have <#371105434771390465> to talk about anime _without spoiling it._
I mean you can talk about a _thing_ without necessarily spoiling it.
since its. _the spoiler channel._
My bigger thing is, like, when I'm asking "hey what toku season should I watch" my first thought isn't "i should go to the spoiler channel for that question".
I guess?
It just feels like there's no _dedicated_ place for general media talk (outside of general). Like, we have <#567740255273222175> _and_ <#337805317276565525> even though you could make the same statement that "mobile games are still games".

but that could just be a Me thing
not general talk about, say, Toku. Its specifically 'hey i want to talk about the ending of Kamen Rider Zero One.'
I mean _sure_ but that's for _spoilers_
oh yeah i wanted to throw this idea out at some point
is it possible to get like a general #media channel for general discussion about stuff like Books and Toku and Not-Anime stuff

because that is honestly _terrifying._
don't know, don't care, all i do know is that he needs some sort of help.
Jesus Christ.
at least real gambling lets you cash out eventually
Its worse than gambling unless you sell the account. That's the worst part.
which sucks because they're both rad people
its not even really _conflict_, they're amiable but they broke up???
does that make me a bad person??
as (i hope i'm) a good friend i'm perfectly fine doing it but a non-small part of me is still _kinda dreading it if it happens?_
Hoo boy, got a feeling I _may_ be pulled into some... not **_drama_** but gonna be needing to act as a shoulder to a couple friends soon.
If someone interprets it negatively _even though you have good intentions_, well, all you've done is given yourself a pat on the back as they're, to put it mildly, less enthused.
Its not about intent, its about interpretation.
Tricky thing to balance, yeah.
Also, good way to alienate parts of your fanbase.
Either ignore it or lean into it, and if you're not comfortable with the latter, its not really a solution at all.
Yeah, there's only two real 'solutions' to the problem.
so i completely understand where that fear is coming from
real talk
i feel _terrible_ for jaiden animations
fuck big pharma
hope you're holding up alright
god i'd fucking panic if i had a hallucination like that, i don't do super well with blood to begin with

this has been a frustration that's been _right_ under the surface for months now and the longer i go on not knowing, the worse it gets.

I am sending you so much love right now. I'm glad she had an owner as great as you.
i ended up there once in a blue moon but that seems sadly plausible
as if i didn't have enough reasons to hate activision-blizzard, _guh_
My bigger problem is that CoD has a surprisingly broad demographic, so a kid may get radicalized young and not even know it.
And it may be the push for some people on the cusp _of_ right wing ideology. Especially since the right wing specifically targets out the gaming sphere for, lack of a better term, recruitment.
I'd argue that just getting his name out there is kinda bad enough with quotes like that paired alongside it.
Correction, putting much, _much_ too much thought into making this as shitty as possible.
Why am I getting the very distinct feeling that Activision put no thought into that decision?
<@!257970367732121602> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
so what does it imply when the poor and socially in need are usually minorities?
And when you're echoing literal neo-nazi ideas, we're _never_ going to be on that same page.
Yes but we have to be on the same page for that to happen.
...its in the name.
If the answer is "Never", then you've figured it out! _Reverse racism is not a thing!_
When was the last time you had to worry for your life while strolling down the street?
I can assure you that if you dig deep enough, you can find an ethnic group that doesn't get the fair shake it deserves.
You can't be racist against white people since we, as a group, have held the power in this country for a _very_ long time.
More often than not racists.
And racists.
And I don't think you realize just _how much_ you sound like someone who's been entrenched in alt-right thinking.
This isn't 'letting people hijack the English language', this is 'your ideas sound like alt-right ideas'.
If it walks like a duck, and it talks like a duck...
Phew. That's a hell of a bombshell.
When Tamomo started parroting current alt-right talking points.
Because they aren't.
And so you cannot pretend that both sides are equal here.
Are the Democrats flowers and lollipops? No, of course not.
But to try to equate them with people that have _proven themselves_ to be a destructive force in the lives of minorities and the poor is disigenious at best.
Just plain and utter bullshit.
Okay, let's break down why the "Both Sides" thing is bullshit.
If Nazis were to accept this loss, then we would not be sitting here having this conversation.
They are Nazis in everything but actually being German.
Dude, we had a group of people in Charlottesville chanting _Nazi slogans._
And people who are directly benefited by the systems being broken.
None at all.
Because there's no chance that the people who support the current institutions are in power right now.
Okay, we're getting somewhere.
Whoever is saying that needs to spend more than five minutes off of their Facebook feed and actually read up on the movement.
Its the same problem with "All Lives Matter". This is about **_Black People._**
Okay, but by attaching that "too" you're kinda taking away from the point.
Its not.
i feel like i have to go scream into a pillow right now
That tells me all I need to know right now.
_Nope_, I'm done.
Are white people statistically finding it harder to find work? Are the systems in place consistently making lives harder for the average white man?
But is 'racism against whites' institutionalized in your country?
No, Racism is the race in power using their power to suppress others.
As long as you can walk outside and talk to a cop without actively fearing for your life, you will never, **_ever_** experience racism.
You've been the victim of bias, not racism.
Stuff like "reverse racism is real" and "we should do things based on circumstance, not race!" are things that alt-right echo right now.
much good has been done by this server's existence
die tho
Late stage capitalism encourages the idea of being able to 'move on up in the world' while breaking the rungs of your ladder.
All of the bumps and chips and everything that comes with it haven't been ironed out yet.
Yeah... we unfortunately live in a - in the grand scheme of the world - rather new government.
At the same time, I wouldn't feel comfortable putting all that power into the federal government. Last thing we need is state laws being made at the top level and another corrupt president.
I'm not mourning for a Target being looted.
Also, _much more importantly_, property can be replaced. People _can't._
Its impossible for a decentralzied group to control every single one of its members.
The modern conservative party isn't exactly running dry of assholes anytime soon.
what's to say that another doesn't slide into their place?
And even if the corrupt executive _is_ expelled
that there are no bad actors trying to maintain an ironclad grip.
_Assuming_
And then upheld.
'Hard anti-corruption laws' that would need to be passed first.
Which, if the past 4 years have proven, they aren't.
Centralizing power assumes that all actors are in good faith.
Mayors of a city can't call themselves sanctuary states in the face of obvious executive racism if you put all the power into the middle.
So what do you think happens when corruption _this rampant_ gets into a centralized government?
Its the fact that we have too many bad actors in a government this decentralized that's let Trump stay in ofice right now.
And removal.
Its called impeachment.
...Yes they do?
That's not the executive branch at that point.
What about all the bills McConnel has killed?
And see how well that's served us today.
All it takes is one wrong turn in a centralized government to make the _entire country_ swerve off the road.
Is it? Because if this centralized government decides "Okay, we're not giving land to Black people" then what are you going to be able to do at a local level?
What happens when _multiple_ bad actors appear in that centralized government? Hope they decide to play by the rules and _not_ attack minorities?
So what happens when a corrupt official takes charge in that centralized government?
Also, incredibly dangerous.
I don't want to say that America itself is broken beyond repair but there are _major_ parts of it that need to be rebuilt from the ground up with progressive ideals.
Decades of racism being not only integrated but encouraged in America's systems leads to more systemtic racism? Who'da thunk it.
But in order to give our House of Reps more power, we'd have to _rebuild the government_ which will never happen without a collapse in this country.

I think you underestimate just how long people in power will prop up this shitty excuse of a government to make more money.
AKA the Legislative Branch.
which make up congress.
_and_ the senate
We have house of reps
Its both.
Giving Congress more ability to do something like that just... _doesn't sit right._
Mitch McConnel has done... _so_ much damage to our country by virtue of never bringing some bills to a vote, and he's majority leader of the House.
I'm hesitant to give Congress more power right now.
but we don't have a Parliament, so still the thing I've been trying to say this entire time.
We've all accepted that this broken system isn't broken as long as everyone's acting in good faith.
The problems with the US government have _never_ gotten a chance to be ironed out like this.
We'd have to do a ground up rebuild of our government.
..._like what I said earlier._
That really wouldn't work for a Presidential election though, and what Gwen said.
Ranked choice voting.
First thing I want when election reform is a realistic thing we can push for?
And we're already pretty bad on track to that as we are.
With how fucked our current congress is, we'd literally see this country devolve into a dictatorship more likely than not.
If we had a donald trump in a centralized government it'd be bad. if we had a _**competent**_ donald trump in a centralized government?
Its not just how _blatant_ that's making me think about how flawed the government is though, and why I really don't think putting all the power into the middle would be a bad idea _in this country._
Oh right, that.
We've never had an entire party _dedicate itself_ to the president, even in the face of obvious outside interference in getting him elected.
But the thing is, the _**top levels**_ of the Government never, _ever_ faced corruption this deep or this blatant.
I mean, yeah, that much is true.
The Gilded age is something I don't know about, but the fact that it ended in _social reforms_ tells me that the corruption was eventually spotted and routed.
Its also emblematic of just how _bad_ things are right now.
Oh cool, another thing the modern US history cuts took away from my education.
Honestly, I think its kind of lucky that this country _hasn't_ faced corruption this blatant until the 2010s.
While other governments have had several iterations that slowly went in and fixed what was broken, even if it took a try or two.
Either way, the US government's systems have very obvious cracks in the armor that never factored until the modern day.
Let me put it like this: if we're using a system of government that was modern in terms of the 1800s, then every government that _reformed_ in that time is actually more structurally sound than ours.
Which was in 1948, which is one of your example 'younger than 200 year old governments'.
Which, based off current events, may be closer than everyone believes.
Whatever kinks are in this system are here until that breakdown.
The United States has never had that complete sort of breakdown yet.
But doesn't that imply that they learned from the mistakes of the previous incarnation and used that knowledge going forward?
200 years seems like a long time but countries all around the world have existed for far, _far_ longer than it.
The US has barely gotten its feet off the ground when compared to how far other countries have gotten.
Yes, but that's besides the point.
And the first draft didn't even last that long. Federalist Papers were poop.
Our government and country were formed at the same time.
Additionally, other countries have had a _lot_ more time to get their shit together.
200 years old is a toddler compared to something like the UK.
Keep in mind that the US is, in the grand scheme of the world, a relatively new government.
I mean, state level government works in the US, but we're currently experiencing top level corruption that this country has literally _never_ had before.
Racist. Racist bullshit.
Its _incredibly fucking depressing_ that it's a very likely course of events.
When the sitting president jokes about "12 more years!" then the system is dangerously close to toppling.
It's not _great_ but its honestly the most likely at the rate we're going.
i'd just like to state for the record that living in the us kinda sucks tbh
This country has so many foundational problems - not just terms of where power is but how power can be _used_ - that its going to take a lot of work to fix.
but it _won't be_ and it will be gamed
Assuming everything is _working_, then making the President unelectable after their term would theoretically be _fine_

_if it were strictly used for when the president has done some bad shit_
Its the same reason why I don't like giving more power to something like impeachment.
Or hold others accountable.
I want to go into game development because I love games, and learned that by playing so many of them that I learned which ones I'd really like to make.
Not knowing is normal. It doesn't mean _you need conflict in your life_, it means you're in the middle of growing up.
They grow. They learn. They think, one step at a time, until they get there.
Or what they want to do with it, for that matter.
People aren't born with the innate knowldge of knowing _Exactly_ what they want out of life or how to get there.
I didn't think I'd want to be a programmer when I was in high school but I'm here now.
_Give. Yourself. Time._
Yet.
Give it time.
Everyone has what they want to do in life.
Perfectly fine.
And if it isn't what you really want? That's fine. Life isn't binary.
Life is what we make of it, and based off what the others have said, you're on the younger side. You've got time to make that decision still.
It's, "What do I want out of life?"
You shouldn't be asking, "How do I get into conflict?"
I'm a boring individual, and that's okay.
_Same._
If its for the sake of being important, that's not a great outlook, frankly.
Take a step back and ask _why_ you want to be important - what you _want_ out of being important.
Life is going to throw plenty of things in your way whether you want it to or not. Seeking out a fight is different from a fight coming to _you._
You can do that without conflict though?
If that means enjoying yourself - _enjoy yourself._
Life is what you make of it.
Not everything you do in life is about making an impact.
Pick up a hobby.
dude, trust me. conflict is not worth the emotional headache.
You really need to get in and uproot your current thought patterns.
Those who do not learn from their past are destined to repeat it.
Then make something in the now interesting enough for you to think about. If you're good at a hobby, think about how to get better at it.
Thinking about the future is normal.
And I don't mean in a sense of character flaw selfish - I mean 'in order to continue functioning I will parse information and remove it eventually.'
Again, very human thing to happen. At the end of the day, humans are selfish creatures.
That's a very human thing to happen.
That's normal though?
Define 'serious.'
Honestly, with the way you're talking, I feel like you may want to talk to a therapist or something about this? Or at the very least _really_ think about what we're saying here.
You will not be bored your entire life.
But we all are, sometimes.
No one does.
Not everything you do is something you owe to the world.
But doing something to alleviate that boredom while going "But how does this help me???" is a toxic mindset.
Its natural.
Being bored is okay.
Nothing does until you _make_ it do something for you.
marcosatsu is already on that
<@!175076569868402688> _uhhhh_
i'm sorry to say but
Character studies exist for a reason.
You can definitely do deep dives into Kamen Rider.
Like I said earlier - life isn't binary. There's no guide to growing up.
Exactly.
and not in the fun way
in the "people are going to have no idea how to have safe sex" way
all this is doing is making me think on how many places sex education is completely and _utterly_ fucked
But yeah. These aren't personal attacks against you, I promise.
put it on record that i appreciate gwen's existence
Besides, criticism is inherent to creation.
Hell, there have been ideas I've been iffy on and then started reading and went "...actually this is pretty damn good." Shoot your shot, workshop it.
Nah. People may feel iffy on the idea but that's not a judgment against your character whatsoever.
half the things i suddenly think of are 50% "this sounds neat", 50% "oh god oh fuck people are going to _hate me_" frankly
discord please let me send messages-
i mean i'm on board with that idea
my brand is angst, you're not alone in that regard.
Yeah, sometimes communities really kinda suck like that.
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>

Oh that last sentence makes me. _incredibly_ sad.
if i'm ever making you uncomfortable please do not hesitate in saying so
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
huh.
oh god 116 questions
Absolutely fucking terrified that the ones responsible just get to wipe their hands of it and walk free after taking the country and beating it into a pulp.
Its an incredibly aggravating time to live in America and _on the off chances we get through these 4 years in one piece_, I am.
It doesn't help that right wing radicals have not only been active but have actively been _told_ to stir shit, in the lightest of terms.
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
just a wee bit.
the other one that surprised me is revolution but the past four years have made me. _kinda bitter_
I think you're right on that.
i just want people to have healthcare
i didn't think i was that communistic but apparently I am?
Huh.
History is a literal dice roll depending on what part of the country you're in and that's fucking aggravating.
I had to go neutral on that question because America is all _sorts_ of fucked in that regard.
are we talking northern still-not-great history or southern "STATES RIGHTS!!!" history?
like this history question
what _sort_ of history are we talking here
"DEFINE YOUR TERMS"
i feel like a lot of my answers in this are a result of me internally yelling
That much is understandable.
^
i mean genuinely speaking therapy is an option
No one deserves to live life with the weight of the world on their back. No one.
But the thing is, it isn't permanent. That's why talking to a doctor or even a therapist if you can manage is a good way to start overcoming it.
Living with depression _sucks_ because things you really enjoyed once? Suddenly they're joyless and you find it hard to gather motivation to do anything. I know - I've been there and still am there if the bottle of sertraline to my right is anything to go by.
They _can._ But that's highly dependent on the person and the medication.
A chemical imbalances can induce depression, which is what anti-depressants sort to balance out.
That's because depression isn't necessarily a physical _thing_ that makes you depressed.
Not feeling happy when you're supposed to be enjoying hobbies is a telltale sign of depression.
Because if it _was_
that's the sign of a bigger problem.
And why is that? I highly doubt its a chemical in your brain triggering to say "Nope, anime is banned!"
Is your brain not letting you or are _you_ not letting you?
Yeah, part of growing up is... kind of realizing that its _okay_ to feel happy for the sake of feeling happy.
It doesn't happen in a day, or even a week. It takes time to move away from toxic mindsets sometimes.
Its hard deprogramming yourself from thinking like that.
also having no means of doing it because moving is _**expensive**_
_People believe it._
And the most frustrating part?
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
We care about you Friendolyn <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
More importantly: I'm glad that you have an appointment coming up and I hope it goes well. Don't be afraid to emphasize just how bad things are regarding your mental health right now.
_I'm going to kick that dude's ass._
My door's always open if anyone needs someone to talk to. Always.
Okay, that's a starting place. Based off that, I'm going to assume that you can't for reasons outside of your control?
I'm going to preface this by asking a very important question. Are you on any medications for your depression?
am dude
apologize for other dudes
At this point if schools aren't being held remotely, that's negligence.
they hide my bad teeth so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
and now i only wish i had that knowledge _then_ so i could recommend she get diagnosed for it while she had the means to _get_ treatment
like that _seriously_ put into perspective a lot of things about that relationship
my ex got diagnosed with Bipolar disorder and... that puts _so much_ into perspective in hindsight.
well i feel like literal years of my life just got explained a fair bit
Wow. _WOW._ FUUUUCK THAT.
growing up during a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic is _not great_
by modern standards at least
It is. This is literally **_the worst time_** to be a kid.
I mean, you're also young so horomones are bouncing in your skull like its the last level of break-out.
Humans are fundamentally flawed and that's okay.
But that's relying on _every person_ to operate on the basis of 'facts and logic', and those 'facts and logic' to be actually _true_ 'facts and logic'.
If humans could control their emotions through facts and logic, there would be world peace. Like, no joke.
> so humans aren't really natural machines at all then
I mean... _yes and no_, like Nuker said. But at the end of the day we're called 'Humans' for a reason.

i think its more "we're ignoring the virus and pumping money into an already broken system that has been in the spotlight for months now"
And then that happens.
No, its money that the state is **_supposed_** to use to help alleviate the strains Covid-19 is causing.

Sending hugs your way Gwen.
Corporate greed is a right motherfucker.
That's good!
there are some days when i think about everything that's happening that i just want to ball up and cry.
Cool, the US is _actively committing crimes against humanity._

Fucking cool.
my brain did calm down once a friend gave what was effectively a text dope slap so. i appreciate him for that a lot
like i _**know**_ i can't do _everything_ but trying to figure out what i specifically want to do _now_ is like playing 52 pick up but i have the attention span of a toddler
_finally, someone put it into words!_
_go team._
this is the worst team to be on
i pull myself in so many directions that i want to go in but have no idea which one to commit to because they take away time from others and _fuck_ its aggravating
having one of those 'i have no idea which way i want my personal life to go and i am therefore floundering' types of nights
My thing with Kanye is that I understand he has mental health issues but he goes out of his way to _not_ actually treat them. He's lost my empathy awhile ago.
I wouldn't be surprised if it was his imaginary friend at the rate he's going.
~~_god_~~
i was in a good mood tonight too. I can't even mourn the loss properly knowing just how Fucked things are going to get after this.
Fuck.
Potentially 60 if they slam a young appointee in.
**_FUCK_**
**FUCK**
Oh boy the next few days are gonna be stressful. _Oh boy._
<:ChrisEmbarrassed:738167509869527060>
my family has. A Lot of issues.
Will do.
the worst part is that i don't even feel particularly sad about it. he's been at the epicenter of some bullshit for _awhile_ in my family
i forget what it was exactly but they were _planning_ on doing heart surgery for whatever reason and now he's just been unconscious for like, 4 days. He's been there since Sunday.
Luckily no, otherwise I'd be absolutely _terrified_ for my grandma.
it would not be hyperbole to say that he's gone in and out of hospitals like, 20 times over the past 2 or so years.
Its... not looking super likely at this point. He's been like this for a _long_ fucking time.
_guess who's grandfather is in the hospital_
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
I was closer with my Dad's side of the family than my mom's for years.
I _used_ to be super close with my grandpa but kinda gradually stopped being that close the more I realized the scummier shit he did over the years.
No, I mean, like
That's the kicker for me. I'm not super affected by it.
grandma isn't taking it super well.
Well. My grandfather passed away.
my thing is that 14k is in fact _**much less**_ than 200k
good fucking god im glad im not watching this live
trump refused to say that white supremacy is bad on national television, i don't know if he's got any ideas on how he'd fix _anything_, let alone national issues.
i don't think so, its more

its nice having it done with? it was a nice service even if im not particularly religious
so im home. was a pallbearer.
im surprisingly okay right now.
thanks gwen. appreciate it.
thanks ten.
tw family death, grandparent death, death (i know this is the serious channel but i don't want people to get really genuinely upset?? i hope im making sense)

||i didn't think getting the email from my professor confirming my absence tomorrow would be the thing that makes the fact my grandpa's _dead_ actually sink in. i wasn't particularly close to him but. it kinda just hit me all at once||
Hoo, guess who's _real_ fuckin sad now
thank you aria <:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
thanks everyone. you're all good people ;;
Stay safe Mei.
It's an absolute mess. I haven't watched RT's content in a hot minute but man...
Monty Oum, and that was the mind behind RWBY.
god _damn it._

its 1 am and i'm absolutely _livid_ about how fucking shoddily twitter moderates itself.
https://twitter.com/Mattagross/status/1314790661334470658?s=20

the whole "quote RT stuff!!!" bullshit wouldn't be necessary if _their mod team actually did their fucking job!_
i probably will next time it crops up i just don't want to be That Guy y'know
that's the thing, i'm not like. an oldie i've been there for maybe 4 or 5 days??
i dunno it just makes me feel Weird and Bad
this isn't really _serious_ serious but its been bugging me a LOT since i saw it

im in a digimon card game discord and one of their members is... _honestly kind of a dick?_ And while they may be 'joking' sometimes, its really made me feel uncomfortable.

like maybe im just a pansy but when the dude's been muted twice for that kinda shit, and he's _still there_ doing similar stuff, it just makes me want to curl into a ball.
its very important.

there is NOTHING i  can say to make a joke about that. _that is its own joke_

oh hey hero academia season 5 in 2021
neat
casual reminder youjo senki is pretty fuckin good
that actually got me. _damn_
(that's official by the by)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r144CEiBWA
if so im just gonna
does toku count as 'close enough to anime'
the animation does have its moments tho
like, 10% of the time but its some good stuff
its the _surprisingly solid writing_
its the kemono friends folk you're not here for their astounding 3D work
its good
the animation is a bit janky in places but overall
its good
today i am going to shill kemurikusa
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diqmC7AfEzk
they're gay your honor
wasn't that a word of god thing
Symphoha?
Watch Nanogear
i want more magical girl mecha
and now i wonder what's _after_ nanoha and symphogear
i just really like Nanoha A's
is it crazy that i don't entirely get all the hatred for uzaki
going to go on a brief tangent here
studio nut did youjo senki? neat
_correct!_
**FRIENDSHIP THROUGH SUPERIOR FIREPOWER**
i also can't tell if its the series or movie
<@!84811738653929472>|| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaajV0mFSpI||

super minor spoiler on nanoha season 1 but it encapsulates nanoha in a nutshell
FUCK YEAH ZOIDS
i don't mind it because i already liked vocaloid but that's fair
Indiscriminate Universe is a good ED too.
_its super good_
the animation is jank but the writing is _genuinely good stuff_

okay serious question from <#384870333620027403> 
WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THIS I'M DUMB
I love Kemono Friends
but _god damn was it rough_
After watching Kemono Friends, literally any CG is a marked improvement.
YOU HAVE AVOIDED SMITING FOR ONE (1) DAY
_god damn it_
AAAAAAAAA
i swear to god if any one of you say symphogear i will smite you myself
speaking of recs
does anyone know of anything Nanoha adjacent
Fang? Check
Hat? Check
GUN
shigaraki lookin ass
Man, Hero Academia got weird.
i don't know who he is but that's very relatable
oh i love him
is it still gay if your homie got gender bent by a truck
oh that sounds adorable
y'know. _god_
i mean, the knowledge _worked_ for the most part, its just that
youjo senki does a similar thing but with copious amounts of war knowledge
i get that i'm just very easily amused sometimes
and i'm absolutely heartbroken that it didn't go the full way
oh that's fair i'm just a sucker for shit like christopher walken don zaloog
so fucking dumb
i love the gx dub its
something something DINO DNA
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
WELCOME TO THE "wHY DID THEY PRINT THIS" CLUB GWEN
And now to posit this back towards anime: to think people thought it wouldn't get banned cause protag card.
i have a summon sorc that i never used lol
hilarious.
objectively
Which is
and then firewall made Cannon Soldier OTK consistent.
not for diversity but to make the game ~_balanced_~
that wasn't why links were introduced at first
hilariously

_something_ happened to 5d's and i can't remember what it was exactly
to be fair 5d's _did_ radically shift in the 2nd half iirc?

same energy as having a younger cousin in the room and going "cover your ears"
"don't click that gwen"
okay that makes a lot more sense
🙇‍♂️
i apologize for the (presumably) straight people who did that.
because they had people working on Dark Side of Dimensions at the same time??
it was good
and then just _dropped_
that's exactly what i've heard
Oh wow, that's the first time I've seen someone rank Arc-v that high up.
Looks like it.
_Ah._
it is incredibly hard finding mecha adjacent magical girl shows fuck
i can't tell if that's the Good kind of 'hell of a ride' or bad kind of 'hell of a ride'
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pASiXlYE4Mk i can't tell if this show is actually any good but something about this amuses me
Mnewtwo
not even subtle???
that's
that's what I _thought_ it was
oh that's oddly adorable
I may give it a shot if my brain can focus on something for more than five minutes at a time
which i'm _down for_
its just incredibly telling of my person I think
this just sounds like Deviant Art Power Rangers to a degree
why do i have the sinking feeling a friend of mine has already seen this show
I can deal with horny. as long as its not like... _unbearably_ horny
okay i'm slapping this _here_ because its tangentially related to anime but also really freaking cute https://twitter.com/usagiizuku/status/1303013959906271233?s=20

and god _damn_ did it hit hard
so a part of my friendgroup does a weekly watch of anime every friday
this week we finished violet evergarden
question for when i wake up
is dorohedoro worth watching because i love noi's character design and know practically nothing else
https://twitter.com/GingaHerb/status/1312165292114505728?s=20
Kadokawa is... _such_ a headache to deal with.
Or, something like that.
From what I understand, its a publisher thing. They use one season of an anime to push light novels.
since there's no big lore revelations or anything its just aoi yuuki going absolutely _apeshit_ for 1 minute
