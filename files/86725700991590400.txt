Wow
Bc I saw something similar at the Goose Pagoda when I visited Xi'an back in 2011
The "reverse swastika" was first used as a buddhist symbol I believe
~~I live in Hawaii tho so...~~
Probably an excuse to draw people away from our own domestic issues
You should try but also keep in mind that this might just be another Syria as well (no Nukes and won't directly affect US soil)
Ohno
Seriously what did Muslims do to you before and even after 9/11
I'm not joking

I am flat out disappointed in them
The ROC got their shot and they failed spectacularly
Even at a horrific cost
It would be true karma
Then I hope the PRC destroys the ROC
I would vote to kick them out and give the land back
If anything
Since the Taiwan Chinese are still, in my eyes, the same as the Mainland Chinese
I can tell you that much in general
It is no doubt that the PRC is bad
It also confirms Taiwan as being the biggest disappointment
This matters most to me as a Hawaiian
It doesn't help that this sort of stuff is whitewashed compared to the CCP's already horrid acts
They are more or less two sides of the same coin
Especially since the dudes Taiwan are mistreating are more or less the precursors to the Oceania peoples (Hawaiians, Maori, etc.)
If not worse
They are just as bad as the PRC in terms of treating the Indigenous
I do not recognize Taiwan primarily for this reason

You around where I am

Called novel bc it's gonna be a slow burn like my unfinished fanfics
Correct term may be either covid 19 or novel coronavirus
Aren't some of them coronaviruses tho
I don't care if covid makes me sick
Those dudes are my worry
And infants and immunocompromised
Definitely not like covid
Not like covid
Thank god for that
Yee
That shit is dangerous
Imho, COVID-19 is infectious but at least it ain't like Ebola
I mean.... theory of evolution exists for a reason
Americans dumb
Supermarket customers are OBVIOUSLY NOT following social distancing procedures
The whole US is gonna be infected sooner or later
Or will it just be all mail in?
Would the vote still HAPPEN if this continues later into the year?!
<:KirikaSob:674720015047720961>
Idk if they even know how to exponent
Bc nobody here fucking understands how exponential growth works
The virus is smarter at math than the West
Without warning
He chose Hawaii along with other cities as fucking retrieval areas for China inbound flights
Oh no
<:KanadeLewd:690470896174891008>
Also yabai Cheruiel
Meanwhile I am all but ready to go hibernation with gbf and pokemon sword
People going full end of the world mode bc they can't socialize anymore
<a:HibikiEatFast:688429714930401328>
Coronavirus can't infect Hibiki
But at least that means I can get all my perishables to eat for lunch without fear of it running out
In Hawaii, it's mostly Spam and Vienna Sausage along with toilet paper
Bc we use it for its proper purpose
Me and my family already has enough for at least a year
And yeah wtf is up with toilet paper
The government can only do so much
Staying home and doing proper quarantine IS the way to go, but we all need to do it
What we do would be the decisive factor
It may be for some people but not for others
Listen to a symphogear song while washing them so you won't get bored
<:NotLikeChika:440914851351494656>
2 week incubation is OP
Yeah
I want an apocalyptic virus where people turn into Kirikas
As long as I don't infect those who ARE high risk
Vs going full Hibiki on an old dude over toilet paper
Stabbing someone over water is at least a tad more sensible
Yeah
If it's in Waikiki tho then I wouldn't be surprised
I never heard of that
Nani
We panic buy but we don't fight for toiletries
Tbh we expensive af but Hawaii residents are FAR chiller vs the mainland
But not under full q
Honolulu is already shut down
Unless the Feds step in
It just depends on each State
It's Flu-ish but with far greater infectivity
All I am saying is that America will fall if people keep getting dumber about this
I don't wanna go into theories
Yee
A whole family of spiky bois
Coronavirus is far more broad than one might think
Which is a part of a bigger family of viruses
It happened since the Spanish-American War
Also all people just wants to spread bs for cash
I swear COVID-19 came from a bat right
Bats man
Having went to China myself, its probably everyday Asian things
Let's make this interesting
I want the virus to rip America apart for good
But those status quo people are also those who are more at risk for the most part
I honestly think it's bnha gone wrong
Remember Swine Flu?
There is
But hence why I said the vaccine is improving despite it not being perfect
Low chance yet still possible
Bless kurzgesgat
And those vaccines are still being improved over time as well
Some of us might not need it but many do
Flu vaccines still exist
Yeah
This is the most I've contributed to here but I gotta bounce now. Gotta AL.
The only bad thing about COVID-19 is that it turns idiots into bigger idiots, virus or no
I can't English somehow
IMPORTS
I think it's just that Hawaij relies a lot on exports and our water, as healthier vs Mainland water, isn't unlimited
We don't need a tidal wave after all the shit going on
Thankfully it didn't upgrade
Tornado Warning for Kauai, then a lockdown of Oahu, and we just had a Tsunami Watch
https://twitter.com/NWSHonolulu/status/1242662933651492869?s=20
Hack and start the fallout series
Basically we are in a hole we can't get out of
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
The US is fucked up beyond belief
That is a microcosm of a failed society
A failed government
Maybe it is both a ruling body and a Dynasty at the same time
Am I the sole person who sees the CCP as a Dynasty than a regime or government?
Emperor Xi of the CCP Dynasty
The elections are a joke
Also we are basically the CCP in all but name lol
That way more local emergencies and issues can be solved
The US needs to be split up. Period.
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
Just turn this year upside down
Shem ha be free plz
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
Indeed. It is rather unsustainable.
To the point where modern ideologies are not useful anymore
When all resources are dried up
Maybe a situation in 2050 or so?
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>

Does this basically mean the US is Tsarist Russia minus the Tsar?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I can't help but snicker at that bc of the word diet
Yee they had held seats in the Diet
I see
<:MeguHuh:681196013662371882>
Overton?
Our culture has been genocided to shit
America won't allow it tho. Especially since the Natives have all the reasons to put America up for over a century of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Worst part is that Hawaii is (illegally) a part of this crap and we are suffering bc of America's greed
No words
Jeez
We even have Christians that have views similar to Islamic terrorists
I mean at this point it is obvious that America is basically Afghanistan or Syria but with a functioning economy
<:ShirabeChibi:698939825155473499>
Like all of it
I forgot sex ed
<:SeriSad:646587423572361226>
The situation of me and other Natives are basically one massive Oof
Hawaii
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Despite the instability being on their heads
Which lead to so many Muslims having refugee status and yet idiots in the West deny them access
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Lucky bastards
It was nothing more than a prime opportunity for Big Oil to secure interests in Iraq even if it wasn't a conspiracy
I feel bad for all who died in 9-11 but feel even worse that more innocents had to die following the incident
Or as I like to call it: The Day when Islamophobia was both legalized and socially acceptable
Ah 9-11
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Full of Covidiots
I am at wits end with my community
Even better was that her nose was not covered by her mask
Nearly got fired bc I had an argument with a lady that shoved her bags in my face even tho we have a policy on ppl needing to bag their own groceries if they brought their own bags
I'm Hawaiian living in Hawaii, that basically means that I would be fucked regardless
Americans are also more inherently dumb on all sides compared to the rest of the world
And a very shiny "basically" bc... well... American Politics is a bit like a one party State that pretends to be two
Basically Republicans
<:MiraiWaa:681196035078488092>
Something akin to DPRK
Not a King but
Like
US
Complete dissolution of the Republic and into Monarchy again via the Empire
We might actually go down Rome's route
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
But for America, it is a massive red flag
Of course it is not
^
Some things aren't meant to be I suppose
Heck, I had thoughts that, if that were the case, COVID would be a fuckup that could have China stumble on the world stage
But here we are
It wouldn't be under competent leadership buoyed by an populace guided by simple intelligence and common sense
That is to say: America is fucking up REALLY badly
<:KotoriBoops:681196000127221875>
But they definitely are handling it better than we are
I do believe China is lying
~~the fact there is no response scares me tbh~~
America really is finished
I don't even care about the human costs anymore, just let Hawaii be in China's hands and be done with it
We are basically more and more dysfunctional day by day while China has stopped COVID for the most part
At this point it is safe to say that China had won
Not necessarily killing people but
The world would be far better off without the US
Honestly, it's about time to kill everyone and say "this is dead and buried" and leave it at that
https://twitter.com/Break_The_Clown/status/1312410027555254272?s=20
And THAT is my concern
Not so much here in America
New Zealand is a big case since the government and the people willingly cooperated to stamp out the virus
Yeah
Yall forgetting that
New Zealand
China has, in one form or another, always been an authoritarian state
A warning
you guys are too westernized and brainwashed to understand the rest of the world
much of the fleet is based in San Diego
Hawaii would avoid it and the US base here, while important, wouldn't have the military capacity to defend it from, say, China or even Japan
we are oppressed illegally for 120+ years
I can bet you that everyone has a bone to pick with Americans
which is why Americans deserve to be enslaved by Hawaiians to pay off for the obvious war crimes they committed against a sovereign kingdom
Illegally
not any business for a Hawaiian
It would be an AMERICAN Civil War
Illegal US Bases
^
being Hawaiian, the US deserves it
how likely are we going to be like the Roman Empire
I am ready for ACW2
I am done with this nation
it's basically hopeless
I might as well stop
because you americans are savages
not like I recieve respect from anyone
I am willing to accept the backlash
you guys are lost causes
tbh
