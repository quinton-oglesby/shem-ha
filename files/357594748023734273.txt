Poor Carol getting bullied
Been running low on echancers
Shes 56 orso now
I need to fucking beat the hard raid to get Biki to lvl 70
No lvl 70 Biki
Screw you Carol, I will collect my miracle crystals
I can do the normal green carol raid in 2 attemps, hard one is still kicking my ass <:AstolfoDespair:421374319646605322>
<:BikkiSmug:585655272459075596>
I was just leaving it running overnight as I slept
I wasnt bothered by the raid length
what is this work and group effort shit
I just want my miracle crystals
wtf
<a:nyanslam:668224112690462740>
buying out the event shop makes you realize how valuable enchancers are <:meguded:398912130843410432>
As in followers? I should have
thanks game
>finish dex carol
>get rainbow crystal
<:thumbsUp:230546875999059985>
dont remember how many I got from it
I think 200 orso
The ticket pack comes with some gems as well
now if only I had the enchancers to get xd Biki to 60 <:hyperree:574346688777551874>
Lucksack xd Biki squad <:RadShamiko:641434994035654667>
so its entirely plausible I just forgot
my memory is shit
could be
<:ASpikaThink:584087705558974494>
Make some follower space and Ill help kill the adds
god fuck the adds on that raid
I can kill green carol twice with that <:meguded:398912130843410432>
slow but steady or something
1 giga miracle <:penth:483052061324345363>
<:LUL:433698987359469594>
I took a shitty team because it was at 20k, now they're struggling mad with the last 3k hp for the on screen kill
the problem isnt hp the problem is the skill seal stopping me from healing <:hyperree:574346688777551874>
<:EmiyaLUL:588471513850576975>
its way cheaper than trying to solo this
Lemme tell you
<:LUL:662399439406759947>
it has more to do with us zerg rushing rather than us being strong
too much
<@!165030821353226240> friend code plz
<:hokuLUL:585558733363347527>
but all my good units are red
same
<:thumbsUp:230546875999059985>
what raid are we doing now?
all my good stuff is power <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
but I have no enchancers
I wanted to level up the red jii healer
and nobody has to get hurt
<:ASmonkagun:580792836329308186>
hand it over now
The luck
Nice
I did it once before deciding she wasnt worth it, at least until I got all the stuff I needed from hard carol
first run used 10 and then I dropped down to 5 iirc
she's way easier
I could do normal green carol in like 3-4 tries
yeah I couldnt even when raids were broken
its gonna be a major pain getting all the blue shit for my xd Biki
<:tamaded:601439964068315147>
I mean all 3 tiers of them
Hand over the miracle crystals. Now. <a:stabby:571841418243604480>
time to roll release banner for ignite Maria
ive gone down from needing too many giga crystals to still needing too many giga crystals
one giga miracle crystal <a:blobpensive:542918318978367491>
Maybe once we start getting our xd bikis to lvl 70
<a:ayayayeyes:559506950694502411>
<:MikuPraise:584465493176352768>
Im not getting any giga crystals <:hyperree:574346688777551874>
<a:ayayayeyes:559506950694502411>
Ill open up a few
what type of hard raids do people need?
<:PepeHands:472690244483809317>
So close, yet so far
üá´
why is the game giving me giga crystals from red carol but not from green carol <:reee:295689089485897728>
Ill put up some blues
I do
anyone putting green carols?
Maybe its your filter?
Lucky has one up, tagging her right now
we'll see
I might do some red raids to LU my burnbasa
I doubt there are a lot of groups coordinating raids together tbh
I put up a green carol if y'all wanna tag
Put up another Carol
Smh people following me without my consent, my follower list is an exclusive club üò§
For now Im assuming anyone with Kanji for their name isnt from here so they all getting the boot
<@478439753025585155> I realized that as soon as I send the message and started clearing up space
<:kinzo:420344502277111849>
BEATRIIIICE
if only I had a witch capable of granting me miracles
At this point Ive come to the conclusion that miracle crystals arent actually real and that everyone saying otherwise is part of a conspiracy theory that exists to deceive me
<:meguded:398912130843410432>
imagine getting miracle crystals
whose Carol we doing? Ill jump in as well
üòî
<a:GimmeGimme:435598097641373705>
Ill be farming Carol hard in a couple hours or so
Im farming enchancers to level my burnbasa and was planning on throwing myself at Carol as many times as needed after that
offering my immortal soul in exchange
wtb miracle crystals
but it puts your skills on cd
I should still have plenty of red stuff from when I got Chris to 70
Burnbasa 48 rn, Ill add those last couple levels and LU her to 60 I think
I think Im LU'ing my Burnbasa after this
The skill seal fucks me up, keeps cockblocking me when I need the heal and then my burnbasa dies right before she gets to heal
<:MikuSmug:655125664986300457>
this is where the fun begins
both adds down now
Iroha's
The Carol we're doing
top add down, bottom one almost
im desperate enough that Ill take any Carol I see <:pepehands:615311794717851658>
you dont have to, we will <:MikuSmug:655125664986300457>
<:SaderPensive:533863820637241347>
you're full
I have my 3 carols of today still as well if we need more Carols
but then I rolled using the gems I got with the ticket and got Ignite Basa <:Ver:336656981144109066>
I was going to use it to get Ignite Basa
They're just *that* good at the game
Euden's green carol
what are y'all using to kill the adds
time to get fucked up by the adds
Im on Euden's now
who's starting up the next one
<a:BongoCat:580749859217473536>
those giga ints are gonna be such a pain to collect
2 more giga miracle and 10 giga int left
<:MikuPraise:584465493176352768>
5x giga miracle
Started a run on yours
whats your ign?
<:meguded:398912130843410432>
Giga rainbow
Chris postergirl of the global server
<:MikuYay:588083917207109636>
which is the most important metric in a gacha
but she cute
<:ShirabeEmbarrassed:278546061755154432>
>H Kirika
as many as Ill need
we going back to Iroha?
no gigas again
Blue one
but int we cant
Carol we can handle on our own
Lets spin up and tag some ints real quick now
üõê
in that case lemme spin up some int raid real quick
<a:ayayayeyes:559506950694502411>
thats a scary prospect
once I have 2 more giga miracle Im gonna need int crystals
Yeah
sure go ahead
int raid basically hardcounters everything people have right now
Cleared a buncha spots
Ill clear a bunch of slots, sec
Please spin up blues people üôè
I started it right as you said that
I havent seen your int raid
or wait that was your carol
I tagged it
<:ErikaThink:655766840429248512>
we're tagging stuff because Sanic is helping us out
totally forgot about opening stuff myself <:LUL:662399439406759947>
Ill start opening some now as well
just gotta go with sheer quantity and hope I still manage to roll some giga crystals
Yeah I can do like no damage at all to int raids so top 3 is a pipe dream
just have to time it correctly so that you are the person after him
Hunt is actually possible, Sanic leaves them with some HP so that people can get hunt afterwards
I'd help if I had literally anything capable of scratching a hard blue
3 more giga intel and Im done
Wew
maybe after that Ill hit the arena
For now Im focusing hard on LU'ing Biki
Ive been neglecting pvp pretty hard ngl
<a:worrymine:615349983532810240>
now back to the enchancer mines to level up my Burnbasa
Welp ive tagged just about everything there is to tag
We are weaklings compared to them
Those are the true heroes <:salute:405625750453092352>
Blue at like 2/5 HP with a total of like 50 attempts
Yeah I saw that
<a:wavewave:641347623315570738>
If they dont ban me I get free crystals, if I get banned, even better cause it means I get to save a whole lot of money
If anyone needs anything else I can put it up
Im out of int and green carol
Only the night owls are left
I think everyone's gone to sleep tbh
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
Could we get some blue raids going?
I try to follow everyone thats here, so I can see if someone is a rando or not by whether Im following them back
I opened a whole bunch of slots
time to get my ass kicked
oh hey advent battle opened
<@!204501539308568577> you got any int raids you could put up?
my current plan is something along the lines of not rolling anymore until xd Serena, whale for her, and then save up until Carol
meanwhile Im sitting here at 50 gems
Syc doing the responsible thing and saving
guess Ill have to wait until tomorrow
2 giga int short on LU'ing Biki
<a:wavewave:641347623315570738>
<:zoomyeyes:520718844965421056>
Guess they messed up and put the image on the main page up too early
Tho if you click it it takes you to an empty announcement page
The event is technically already in game <:02LuL:438080906209656841>
when Serena comes around Ill have to start farming all over again <:hokuLUL:585558733363347527>
Time to LU Biki
Welp
I didnt know red Carol raid could give giga int crystals
yooo
wtb enchancers
By the rerun she'll have been powercrept anyway
I did one really half assed run and then was like meh
Ill try to clear the adds quick
Wasnt planning on finishing that one, but if people wanna actually clear it Ill run it as well
didnt even know she could give those
<:POGGERS:580576185604374568>
then I got 2 while collecting some red carol rewards
I thought I hadnt gotten the last 2 giga ints I needed
Still dont know who I should throw my stat enchancers at
<:meguded:398912130843410432>
needing red carol mats
you know whats worse than needing green carol mats?
its like 4am here, Id join if it werent so late <:meguded:398912130843410432>
if anyone wants to do some red Carol's give me a ping <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
<a:ASwinku:580919830509780992>
showed up now
poor carol getting bullied on her birthday
2 carols now I think
<:astolfosleep:615311794587828224>
thanks ahegao
but its like 5am so Ill figure those last few out tomorrow
only 3 giga int away from LU :heavybreathing:
It said it was already dead when I tried to join <:AkkoShrug:633455078698909716>
I need one more giga int crystal but I cant run int raid
lemme open a few slots
only friends and followers
I have a half hp red carol up if anyone wants to hit it
Ill send out aid request in a bit
softening up another red carol btw
Carol please
I need literally only 1 giga int
so Im running red carols and hoping for a giga int drop
to see if the bots are hitting normal raids as well
<:aliceNom:661825711132246018>
for scientific reasons of course
time to launch one of every raid and see which one the bots take care of
<:monkaHmmm:470825848979587072>
so if I start raids and then do an aid request for everyone these bots will take care of it for me?
my miracle got hit
thats how I got my last giga int when I was exactly one short that one time
P carol drops int as well <:Think:460089500341633055>
The Curse of Balal was a good thing, I do not want to share any kind of language with people who support that ship
it has been tainted beyond any hope of redemption
time to nuke the channel
Thanks!

There was a fanart showing how Maria does her hair to get the cat ear effect I vaguely remember, does anyone remember it/have it?
or sends me to a random message halfway between the top and bottom
sometimes it works, more often it doesnt
the skip to top on Android is extremely inconsistent in my experience

official artwork at that
Hibiki is wearing Maria's swimsuit in that pic is the joke Im fairly sure
actually I have been doing exactly that ever since we got the Carol ED
I could listen to her sing for days
god Carol is so cool
Genjurou is stronger than the geahs
I mean
if this season ends with no return of Ver Im retroactively dropping XV
cornered rats and all that
just goes on with her song while casually tossing them around
I love that tho, she barely acknowledges their existence
Self preservation is their reason
https://streamable.com/8vd4g
I love the way Carol fought in the last episode
She just straight up cuts the moon in half with her bigass sword
<:concern:319327499316363264>
Imagine how large Tsubasa's sword will be, at the very least it would have to be double the size of the sword she creates in ep1 of AXZ
all the geahs combine Voltron style for the final episode
#noiserights
I dont want Symphogear to end
He's the Last Action Hero
Who the hell wanted to see Ver get his ass kicked
No
Like gods
And then go on to fight actually cool enemies
Yes we can see him get kicked in the face next episode
Is that a serious question
He's the most boring thing about XV so far <:ASPepeSleep:582388549404459029>
It really wouldnt be
Imagine setting up the fucking gods as the villains in axz and then having them fight a random old man in the final season
God I hope he's a red herring
Pls no
Just have Genjurou squash old man so we can go on with the interesting stuff
Genjuro/Basa tag team
No better time to mix things up than the final season
He was gonna save the world
rewatch Geah
<a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>
A temporary setback in the grand scheme of Ver
he cannot be beaten
Ver has the power of Sugita on his side
Carol had connections with the alchemists from axz, he might also have salvaged it from the Chateau after Carol was defeated
They just wrote him off the moment he took the bullet
I like how Tsubasa's daddy was shot in the lung but nobody even bothered to try and administer first aid or get him to a hospital
Swan Song is literally the best translation of the term

its very generic

you underestimate my ability to ignore information I dislike
superb song just makes me wanna puke
if the FGO stageplay can do this, then the Symphogear stage play can top it https://www.bilibili.com/video/av25116942/
<:ASbigBrain:582388547789783040>
but a stage play
not a movie
oh wait this is symphogear
And then Symphogear will join GuP and PriPri with the eternal wait for the movies
Calling it now
XV gonna give us a cliffhanger ending and movie announcement right after
if you make people think you are pretending that you have no idea what you're doing, they wont notice that you actually have no clue as to what you're doing
Im actually as dumb as I ironically pretend to be
The trick is
Imagine how fucking extravagant Basa's concert will be with movie production values
The real reason for needing the movies is
cant disagree with facts <:bbdab:597840294444007454>
I thought it said mana
thats some keming going on there, Discord

he was always a red herring
nobody expected Fudou to be endgame tho
then Hibiki punches Shem-Ha
Kanade gets resurrected and with their Gungnir fragments fuse into a full Gungnir <:ASbigBrain:582388547789783040>

does this mean we're finally getting a full version of Beef Stroganoff?
ngl
Id pay some serious money to see Chris Evans rocking twintails
in other words, an objectively better version
Captain America but a whole lot more gay
Can the mods ban this guy's dreams for spoiling the ending?
So it doesnt really make a difference either way
Ill just pretend she didnt
And even if she does
Miku isnt gonna die
<:neronaisubody:585537961525903365>
Time works weird with Fate
I think
Or was
She's as flat as Basa
But saying she has titties is going overboard
Yes she's a girl
Lets not exaggerate
Dont you remember the reign of presi-king Edison?
Just look at the Fate franchise
Everyone knows Japan has the more historically accurate version of European mythology
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
They may take my animated kiss from me, but they can never take away my headcanon
Im already getting the angry mob together
wow, no DMJii kiss??
If XV doesnt end on Hibiki marrying Miku the entire series will retroactively become bad
Maybe they're keeping Ver for the movies
very important plotpoint
We still havent gotten the return of Ver

And not super close to either
The ones in Symphogear are actual aliens, closer to Prometheus than AC tbh
As far as I know they were an earthbound race
The Assassins Creed precursor race werent aliens

<:ChthollyYes:616193833281257484>

Ill think about it
<:KiyoSmug:362263232855015424>
where else am I supposed to be
At least Airgetlam is based on *something*
Ichaival is just straight up made up tho
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuada_Airgetl%C3%A1m
Irish
Well Airgetlam at least the name is from actual mythology
it will remain special whether it continues or not
Symphogear was special before 2 days ago
lmao at that point it will literally become Nanoha if adult Miku and Hibiki have a yuri baby <:kek:457138302089429002>
They're going to adopt Chris when they get married, Ion
I want that
<:Cinnadrool:585907142800703508>
milf hibiki
we can have a timeskip
become intergalactic cops
Time to follow Nanoha

it would be a pretty dumb business decision to kill off a massively profitable franchise at the peak of its popularity
until the series shows itself to be not profitable they'll want to keep going
hence why I dont see them killing the franchise
Sales numbers have been really good for each season
a tiny tiny minority
*some* people
Lmao
lmao
people hated the writing for TLJ, and yet it still fucking sold like crazy
no people are *clamoring* for more Star Wars
not because it was milked, but because of bad writing
actually the Dr Who formula might fit symphogear very well tbh
Its not milking that has made Star Wars lose its magic, its bad writing that did the series in. And Dr Who is still special to a lot of people so I dont know what you are talking about
and I dont see it not continuing, its a very profitable and popular series
we're putting random titles after symphogear now, right
Symphogear Unlimited Blade Works
what Ive been saying all along

Chris with a shotgun isnt an euphemism for porn, porn is an euphemism for Chris with a shotgun
I didnt know I needed Chris with some pump-action action until now

Fairly confident at least some incarnations of Supes are planetbusters
The only reasonable explanation I can think of is that they use it to commit life insurance fraud
At this point I have no clue why people still go  to those concerts

People who think Symphogear is gay are just really weird, I bet they think Liz and the Blue Bird was gay as well
Purely platonic sex of course

He wasnt, he was just blowing every dogwhistle in existence
Those people didnt pick him spontaneously out of thin air
Its not like he hasnt given those people plenty of reason to view him as a symbol
Cant blame people for playing totalitarian when democracies are painfully boring in hoi4, they might have improved it since launch, but the one time I tried to play a democracy near launch you basically couldnt do anything but twiddle your thumbs until the fascists decided to kick off ww2
Most of the original ones were nowhere near as happy ended
Disney has done a lot to make fairy tales more family friendly

The first self insert
And the legends of King Arthur go back way longer than that
He first appeared in the stories around the 12th century iirc
Also like in the stories of King Arthur and the round table, these days Lancelot is one of the most important and well known knights
You cant really pin down an origin on many of those stories that have been passed down from medieval times
yeah, "original versions" is not really an applicable term to any story origininating in those times, I was more kind of referring to how those stories were before Disney got their hands on them and made them alm family friendly
"and the lesson kids, dont misbehave or you get eaten by fairies"
The world just really hated that guy
With the notable exception of the one dude who got hit by lightning like eight times
The chances of any of those freak incidents actually happening anytime soon arent very high either
But hey, you got so far in life without any freak incidents
Everything carries an inherent risk with it, the safest thing to do would be to never leave the home, but then you could always get hit by a freak lightning bolt
Lots of people die each year because they get hit by a car, but hey I still have to go to places
I see it as a statistics thing, there are tens of thousands of schools and only what, a handfull of notable school shootings a year? (still too many but whatever)
but you can find a balance with comfortable levels of both
you can never be 100% free, neither can you ever be 100% secure
and handguns which are the most common firearm in homicide, are pretty much banned
Its not like guns are banned in Europe, France and Germany still have relatively high rates of gun ownership, but there's a lot of regulations and responsibilities that come with owning one
Fairly sure you get into trouble for bringing guns to school as well
Instead of cars in general, a lot of people die to drunk drivers as well
the line is pretty clear for free speech
nah
but you really shouldnt be suprised when you get kicked out of places
you wont get arrested for saying the n-word

now, Im not an expert on the US constitution and term limits
Thats not entirely fair as people obviously wouldnt be voting in the same way if the electoral system were different
Nukes are unlikely, but the conflict will definitely escalate, this is akin to murdering the secretary of state/defense in the US if the two offices were combined into one
Not just some general, pretty much the most important guy after the Ayatollah

is that a nihilistic take? sounds more like optimism
go ahead lol
Im just kidding
no

having the EU president be directly elected would give them a democratic mandate which would clash with the democratic mandates of the national governments
The EU is technocratic by design

tragedy ensues
sees a moving blip on his equipment and assumes its a US fighter
the simplest explanation is that the Iranian army was on high alert after launching missile strikes at US bases and some grunt manning the SAM had an itchy trigger finger
Its not like the US has SAMs chilling right below Iran's capital
Pretty damning evidence

You wouldnt be implying that these corporations dont have my best interests in mind, would you?

The parties might exist, but the popularity of the idea of leaving the EU has almost universally gone down since Brexit
after the shitshow that's been Brexit nobody wants out of the EU
aaaany day now
The EU has been on the brink of imploding for the past 2 decades according to euroskeptics
well maybe hunting people
If you're keeping the rifle under the counter, then you clearly were intending to use it for hunting
they're outnumbered
Americans are going to be fucked when the guns gain sentience and revolt
you just got caught with an illegal firearm
if someone breaks into your house and you shoot them
I mean in most of Europe
You better make sure there is no proof you invited them
but you cant do it with an automatic system
and technically you wouldnt be committing a crime under castle laws
You are allowed to sit in the corner of your house and shoot the first person that walks through the door
even if its in your house
you couldnt attach a string to your door and a shotgun for example
I know that traps are outlawed by the supreme court under any circumstance
and nobody has proof that it wasnt intended as one
it was totes intended as a tf2 reference
but Ill just say that yes
It could apply to a lot of things
and build a base and attack anyone who comes close to it
you claim a few chunks
its basically modded Minecraft
In current year they're horribly archaic and undemocratic
Caucuses were practical back in 1820 when current day technology wasnt available
And then the app broke
This year they thought they could save time by streamlining it with a phone app
They just made phonecalls to report the results of the precinct
I mean normally they didnt use paper votes either for the caucus
I think in 2016 there was a single delegate that was elected for Clinton and voted Sanders, and thats out of like four thousands delegates
Hopefully it dies out soon
Cults of personality are the new cool trend in politics worldwide
Im not American, I dont know the detaile of anyone's policy since I dont get to vote for any of them anyway, but when I see a tweet using that clip to attack the guy for having struggled with being gay, thats just looks terrible on the person making the tweet
Its a much better way of getting your point across than the tweet using that clip as an argument for how he isnt committed to his own queerness
this I can agree with
Then attack the guy on his platform, not on him sharing how he struggled with his sexuality when he was a teenager
Literally the person who made that tweet?
Its a low fucking blow to try and shame someone who grew up in a very conservative place for having struggled with who they are
Is that supposed to be an indictment of Buttigieg? The idea that a gay kid in a small Indiana city would struggle with his sexuality isnt exactly a massive suprise
I was born in Limburg, I know very well what a shithole looks like

real weebs use Superb song
what he said
there are other things one can read manga for other than the art
Manga's good, Im just joking
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
instead of season 2 you got disappointed by the manga
like C class heroes are still close to superhuman in physical capabilities
I mean humans in OPM arent the same as humans in our world
saitama is on the hard work side of the equation, we see Saitama after he decides to become a hero but before he becomes OPM and he was still working hard at his goal
if they didnt want us thinking about it they wouldnt be laying down rules in-universe
so its fair to speculate about
well the manga has actually given us nuggets of information to the powerlevels in-universe
I interpreted it as a relative thing, like for someone as weak as Saitama his training regimen was *insane*, its like a scrawny dude trying to lift a 400 pound weight, for a relatively jacked dude its more than possible, but for a weak dude its almost impossible

Its not complete if it doesnt have a TS note aswell
tho the OP alone has me suspecting that Ill dislike the second half of alicization
that was great
except the GGO spinoff
Its been medoicre imo, but compared to the rest of SAO thats still an improvement
Not that they were bad, but they're pretty old, and the animation has not aged well at all
Haven't seen Madoka, so I cant comment on that, but for Nanoha the movies are a very large improvement over the original seasons
Same with season 2 and movie 2
Yup
Then you have Vivid and Vivid Strike set after StrikerS, and Reflection and Detonation set before StrikerS
Is the main stuff
Season 1/Movie 1 -> Season 2/Movie 2 -> StrikerS
The original seasons are really dated, but the movies are fantastic imo, I highly recommend you watch the movie remakes if you are going to watch Nanoha
Tho Id have to add the disclaimer that I watched the first two seasons, and then their movie remakes
Recently watched Nanoha and imo Id put it on the same level of good as Symphogear
dont remind me that the rest of SAO exists
just give me cool swordsmen beating up other cool swordsmen with fantastic animation
too many real world shots, and basically anytime they went back to the real world in the first half i couldnt help but cringe inside from how dumb it is
<:chrispray:621862157344047115>
or more like the entire city block
she's just befriending the building
I got the movies with the commentary downloaded, just never got around to it
I should watch it with the commentary sometime
I might be biased because I just love the idea of Nanoha-mom and Fate-mom tbh
And out of place
That was really bad
Oh ye
At least with Vivid the lolis have the courtesy to transform into non-loli form for the battles
Its been a while since watching it, but I vagyely remember season 1 having a discomfortable amount of pantyshots
Seasons 1 and 2 also have that tho, its just a fact of life you gotta learn to ignore if you like magical girl series at this point unfortunately
How can one not like it
Its magical girls doing MMA
<:zasshu:510192903734296587>
Which is the real good stuff
Besides, the first two seasons/movies are just a gateway to StrikerS/Vivid
I was very unimpressed by season 2, but I loved the movie
Nah
They cut out a subplot, but its overall still an improvement to season 2
Meh
you're going to find a servant for each fetish if you look hard enough
I mean FGO has literally hundreds of servants
the word is literally shorthand for animation
the entire point of anime is animation
then you should read some manga instead
the new style allowed them to make the animation a lot more fluid
but any clip looks better
The stills look worse
cant say much about quality since like i said, I downloaded to watch with the commentary but never actually got around to it
uses an edited version of commie's script iirc
CSW's releases have them
the world its set in is completely different from any other entry of the franchise
Besides, in Requiem none of the standard rules hold
Id say M2, but there are people here who make good points in favour of s2
S2 is a bit more divisive
The movie is great
M1 seems to be the general consensus from what Ive seen
It has some serious pacing issues, but overall Strikers was still my favorite
üò¶
These two arent a thing in the movie
which is a crime I cannot forgive
The movie cuts out two twin catgirls
To give s2 credit
Tho
I wouldnt say it was enough to push me away, but when I watched s1 + s2 my impression was "this is nice", whereas my impression after m1 + m2 was "holy shit this is incredible"
But hey, you could always watch both
Personally Id say m2 after watching both because I didnt find the plot thread that gets cut very interesting, and I found the animation of s2 really dated, m2 was a very large improvement imo
yeah
they were good
I think I watched the movies with the Commie subs
felt so wrong
The subs I watched Strikers didnt have the obligatory Nana insert song subbed

>Hayate pats
so Nasu was like "we'll just say Zero shows the events that happened prior to FSN in a different universe"
and he did some things that conflict with information in FSN
Fate Zero is a prequel written later by Urobuchi
so the same way that Fate Zero and FSN arent the same universe
is it actually noticeably a different universe, or is it a different universe in the same way that Fate Zero and FSN arent the same universe
Hayate <:blobmelt:552205361457922048>

<https://nyaa.si/view/1163166> oh wait lmao I just realized it isnt even English subbed
so guess Ill just bookmark it and download it at a later date
I might download it to check out, but I wouldnt be able to watch it anytime soon anyway with how busy I am
so Im just browsing the filesizes on the file list of the torrent
yeah I have it, but then Id first have to download the full 40gb which I dont feel like <:hokuLUL:585558733363347527>
it has the entire soundtrack in flac, but that surely doesnt add up to 30gb
because the actual mkv file with the movie in that release is only 9gb
Im honestly not sure why its as large as it is
<:penth:483052061324345363>
There is a release of Detonation on Nyaa thats 40gb on its own
It has Vivid Strike, StrikerS, and the first two movies
Im at 49gb
<:tamawut:601440071467401276>
Ive been meaning to go through relfection and detonation to see if I can get some gifs/emotes out of it since there is a draught of both when it comes to Nanoha, but then life got in the way <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
its a character from s2 yeh

thats where it goes from a funny romcom to an amazing one imo
yeah
45

<:HansSip:410260291104800779>
it matters in that they could have had a better experience than what they got
They added in scenes from the other routes and skipped crucial scenes from the Fate route
It wasnt even Fate
Thats some fucking Pixar shit
The Miyuverse hgw is already halfway to there
Instead of heroic spirits you summon mecha from various series that you then have to pilot in a battle royale
Fate with mecha is something Id pay top dollar for tbh

Same, but none as much as Bakarina
Bakarina being first might lead to the genre peaking very early on
The only issue is that if Bakarina leads to a wave of Otome isekai anime
<:peepoevil:576891115027038208>
The subbers managed to convey me thoughts through the subtitles
Didnt Nanoha start off as an eroge spinoff?
Some of the cuts in the fights strongly reminded me of mecha anime moreso than magical girl anime
thats a thought I had when watching Detonation last week

"This pregnancy thing is getting annoying, imma take a break and continue making this baby later"
In the Culture novels the people of the Culture could change genders at will, if you switched genders while pregnant the gestation would just halt and continue the next time you switched back to girl iirc
