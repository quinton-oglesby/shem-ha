<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
Hello, fellow gear users. I'm a part of the rewatch over on r/anime and I decided to come by.
Uh yeah, there's... wherever Maria's family is from. (Ukraine? Poland?)
I also agree.
As someone in the states
I know; I was just acting like someone from the States and pretending that the States is everything.
People in the States can't handle pure hype.
I decided to add an extra chapter to a Love Live one-shot of mine (NSFW): https://archiveofourown.org/works/20808728/chapters/49460096

I LOVE THESE DRAWINGS SO MUCH




I firmly believe that part of Hibiki's training was watching Kamen Rider.
Yeah, that looks like Agito's henshin.

It's wheelchair girl from Yuuki Yuuna.

How would you describe that kind of outfit?

<@106861977086779392> You might like this.

Nice.
"Dess"
Nice.

MARIA-NEE
I wish we had a :charmpoint:
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
<:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
Also, is this a Gochiusa reference?
Who's the other Hibiki?
Is that Hibiki by Chris' legs?
Nice.
Oh shit you're right.
Fuck it, now I need all of the users as SymphoMILFs
YES
YES
YES
(oh god this isn't nsfw)
Is this saying that when Chris goes off she explodes?
Hibiki, have you heard of being too swole?
(note being i *think*)
(i think it's done)

Also, is it weird that I headcanon Maria as having Jewish ancestry?
(I know the wiki says Ukranaian, but she's got a Polish middle name.)
The closest is Maria, and she's.... Eastern European?
I love the idea of these girls putting on an Oktoberfest, especially because I don't think any of them are German.
Looks like Oktoberfest.

I saw that on the Precure server.
Oh, I read that one.
What's that?
It kinda reminded me of this Love Live Sunshine fic, It's Always Sunshine in Numazu, except the characters here have a better grip of themselves in Aquors.
What she lacks in height, she makes up in meat.
<@!193408538909868033> Was the implication at the end meant to be that Bikki was about to throw up?
Nice.
<@!193408538909868033> Can you DM me that?
I feel like Maria would take the longest to get drunk. The quickest... either Shirabe or Tsubasa.
Now I wanna write a fic where all of the users get shwasted.

I like it.
Chris will fill her in.
<:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
I was going to use a Tsubasa embarassed emote, but we don't have one.
Isn't anata what you use to your lover?
I-Is this safe?
They're complaining about their lack of inclusion, but it's done like a silent movie.
That would be a fun OVA scene.
I know, but it's just funny to think about that.
Because even they realized how little they mean to the plot.
I love it.
I haven't heard this story at all.
Wait, what?
I know who they are, but the show forgets their existence sometimes.
*that was a joke*
Who?
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
For a moment, I thought Miku was petting a dog.
Her face is on the other side.

It does.
Is Hibiki cosplaying?
The gayer, the better.
Hibiki yuri.



DID SOMEONE SAY PRECURE
It was a real bad nose job.
Tsubasa says she's a blade, which is kinda like a ship.
Most of it is.
I main Danbooru.
I'd let her pet my head.
Kanade looking like a snacc.
IT IS KIVA
Truly, this is the power of a Relic.
Like this, for example:
It's that kind of pose that allows one to see boobs and butt and the same time.
No Hibiki butt <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
> kirika is cute
Ftfy
SETSUNA
... Good.
Kerrik's a good boy.
https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/2379295
https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/2865147
Maybe that's her kink.
Maybe Miku feels tired sometimes and she wants someone else to shower Hibiki with love.
YOU DON'T KNOW HER
Maybe Miku likes getting cucked.
You know what they say about girls with big hands.
Tsubasa's really into tango dancing.
Her boobs, though, seem off.

Serial Experiments Lain.
Oh shit, Kirika reminds me of what Lain would look like if she grew up.
She does look very 90s.

And I will be happy.
One day, there will be no more Dr. Ver art.
She would be.
Flat chest.
Ultimate waifu.
Miku's favorite outfit: Nothing at all <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
"Bikki, what are you doing?"
woa
https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/3728788
I think so.
... There's part of me that wants to see that. I don't know if it would be good but it'd be interesting.
Inb4 the real villain is Miku and she wants Hibiki to come home on time UNLIKE THE LAST THREE MONTHS
||Make sure he's orange.||
Can't be a Symphogear series without it.
Will you still retain the anti-American attitude?
You mean Fate and Nanoha <@163409869813186560>
B-But my nana...
She's also the kind of character most likely to wear a school swimsuit.
Oh God, what's the Miku?
I can't be buggered to check right now, though.
XV content coming in like a barrage of Zenbus.
If you choose the top dad role, it automatically mutes you.
Ghosts or not is up to you.
Chris' parents come back to support her.
Maybe Kaneko likes it.
The Custodians are defeated by giving them beef stroganoff.
The final episode of XV ends with everyone getting married... to guys.
"Miku, if you don't come back, I'm going to tell everyone about your panties!"
Except Hibiki's reason is that she doesn't know how to cook.
^ Yeah, and that's what they feel like often.
Trans is an identity; futa is a porn term, like creampie or mating press.
Well, the tags say trans, but they read more futa to me, so...
There's, interestingly enough, quite a few trans Symphogear fics on A03, thought most of them are hentai.

Theory: As her bust decreases, his voice gets deeper.

Coffee's for closers.
What about an OVA?
^ And that's what, oftentimes, it feels like.
Others, not so much.
That one, yes.
Is that this one: https://archiveofourown.org/works/15283107/chapters/35454090
I can explain (I think).
It doesn't in principle, but the presentation makes it feel like they choose it due to its sexual titulation rather than it feeling authentic to the character.

Hibiki: "I like food and eating the rich!"

And American schoolchildren pre-World War II.
It's like, what were you expecting?
^ And then Tucker Carlson got pissed at when he interviewed him.
It's like the college admissions scandal; those kids already had all the advantages they could ask for, but they didn't have *the prestiege*
Enough bullshit to power a Gear.
So, one of my friends on another server is getting kicked out of their home by their parents. They're 16 and pretty likely to end up on the streets. If any of you could consider helping them, I'm sure they'd appreciate it: https://www.gofundme.com/aikomovingfund
Took them long enough.
That was when I first heard of it.
tl;dr An asshole alt-righter on Youtube was harassing an openly gay Hispanic journalist, he noted it to Youtube, Youtube said "Guy's an asshole, but he hasn't broken our rules (except he has)", everyone was like "What the fuck?", Youtube was like "OK, we'll demonitize him."
> They managed to meme an entire hairstyle
In what sense?
Huh, that sounds familiar...
Olly's my husbando.
Did someone make a Olly reference?
Oh.
What happened with Undertale?
Yay.
I believe Felix is trans.
https://youtu.be/nxeB2AXIG3E
There's a video that talks about its evolution. Give me a min.
I also think I went from meme to slur.
Thug has often been associated more often with gang members of color than white gang members, at least to my perception.
Male formal dress is both the worst and boring.
^
Yes.
I'm confident enough in my masculinity that the idea of crossdressing/crossplaying sounds likes something I could do... someday.
You're not wrong.
Gotcha boss.
Sorry.
Even I wouldn't touch that.
I identify as Wooloo.
^
And a lot of the stories were like, "He was murdered because his indecent advances ignited a rage into his assilant."
That reminds me of a book that just came out that looks at true crime stories that involved gay men that occurred before Stonewall.
That's like when, in high school, a new campus was built and most of the walls had glass. I was thinking, "Great, it's going to be really easy to get shot if something like that occurs."
Wow, that sounds like a bad idea.
^
I feel like Ranma isn't a show that's aged well. (haven't watched it so I wouldn't know; just guessing)
Ranma?
I remember reading a section of Foucault in a theory class last semester and being like, "Huh, I never really thought about the idea of using other methods besides genitalia as determining one's sexuality and interests."
I'm an ace, so my general response is 🤷
Phobia is fear.
Oh.
Gynephilia?
Penis disgusts me, but all genitalia disgusts me.
But they get filtered into douchebags.
Agreed.
I don't know if I would ever say I wasn't accepting; it was more like I didn't think about it really. But once I met trans people in my life, I was always like "You good people, I love you and I'll always be there."
OG Carol not really; adult Carol OK.
That's just me; others do what they do.
Imma go on the record and state the only Sympho characters I feel uncomfortable lewding is Serena and Elfnein. Everyone else is fair game.
To Sakimori.
Hmm. Why's that?
All of Philosophy Tube is good shit.
^
What if they're like "I have no idea what you just said"?
I find it weird that being autistic is both politicized and not at the same time.
Everything comes back to fuck TERFs.
I've heard of that before.
So, basically, it's people not wanting to have sex with trans people because of what's in their "cotton"?
Oh I found something different.
According to Urban Dictionary (grain of salt and all), "A term used to describe lesbians lack of desire to date a transgender female because she has a penis."
I write erotica so I'm all about lewding, but like I say, you do you.
^
People of African ancestry then?
> But biologically you’re still either a guy or girl at any given time
Biology and psychology are two different things.
"Enby"?
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
I get the idea.
Thank God, that's over.
I vote yes.
Last guy who chaos'd got kicked.
Bad shit.
I don't really understand that, but it sounds like some bullshit be goin' down.
Once again, Max Landis is garbage in every way.

I mean, technically, yes, but fiction can also be used to help us better understand certain parts of reality that might be hard to comprehend otherwise.
All fiction or certain kinds?
Mormons.
Latter-Day Saints.
Making people feel like they're not welcome in a country
Big oof.
It's about a fox spirit who has to keep her identity a secret while attending high school, but she's so bad at it that all the other students know and have to help her keep her secret from the adults while pretending that they don't know.
If you like your kitsune, there's one called High School Inari Tamamo-chan.
Just be prepared for lots of talking.
Watch Re:creators.
You got a MAL/Anilist?
For a moment, I thought you were talking about a real life person and got confused.
Don't know if it's true, but it's funny if it is.
Regarding the Panty and Stocking dub, I heard that the Japanese creators wanted the dubbers to put in more profanity so that they could use it to learn English swearing.
I really hope it gets an anime.
I FUCKIN LOVE THIS MANGA SO MUCH
WAIT THERE'S A NEW CHAPTER GOTTA READ
Plus, Aoi Yuuki's in it <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I get why someone may not like it.
To each their own doe.
I've only watched the first half of Episode 1 but I'm liking it.
The only anime I haven't started for this season is Vinland (and Fire Force kinda).
https://tenor.com/view/muscles-popping-body-building-dumbbell-nan-kilo-moteru-anime-gif-14489924
I'm really liking Dumbbell, Uchinoko, and Maidens.
It operates as a collection of short stories, with each new customer to the restaurant allowing the viewer another opportunity to find out more about the world.
It focuses on a restaurant that, six days of the week, opearates as a small Western-inspired restaurant in Tokyo. However, one day of the week, its door operates as a portal to another world whose various inhabitants come to the restaurant to enjoy its food.
So yes, Isekai Shokudou is the good shit.
Beep boop
>ibo was meh
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
My favorite is SoL.
||Stone Ocean: Imma join||
... perhaps
See, that's what they should have done for the edgy Nanoha story instead of Force: place the Nanoha characters in a Black Lagoon-esque story.
Nanoha's backstory is still one of the most fascinating things ever.
That's part of the joke.
There is a fan comic where she brings Vivio home and her parents freak out, thinking it's her biological daughter.
Up to you, fam.
> They watch Clannad once a year
That's almost as lewd as holding hands together.
Yeah, her.
~~i know, i just wanted to see if i could remember it~~
shit
It's the woman who sits next to Ogawa in the base.
I don't even remember her name; that's how much she doesn't matter.
What does female Ogawa watch?
Topdad watches what he thinks Hibiki would watch because he wants to know what she's talking about.
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Serena can't watch anything ||because she's dead||
Oh my God, I wanna write a fic where everyone else has to go to America because Hibiki wants to help storm Area 51.
Bikki will lead the march to Area 51.
Maria pretends to watch dramas, but she's really into stuff like Citrus.
Kirika watches CGDCT just so she can ship the girls.
Cause, ya know, swords.
Nah, Tsubasa probably likes Bleach.
OK, time to ask: Among the Symphogirls, who watches Naruto?
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Boruto's Dad is a good show.
Themself.
Melua has friends.
Man, you know Kirika is a serial pinger.
So is Uchinoko's ed.
At least we got the third Heaven's Feel movie. A third Spider-Man movie...
He'd be worse than that serial killer in zero.
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
God, imagine if Dr. Ver was a master in the Grail War.
Imagine a Symphogear isekai.
No.
Tsubasa was a Precure once.
Did someone say Precure?
Makes sense; Nanoha's design was based on a Gundam.
So, what would you say is the biggest difference between Nanoha and Symphogear?
Huh, another thing Nanoha and Symphogear have in common.
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/eawr25/love_live_nijigasaki_high_school_idol_club_tv/
My worst is Chaos;Head, closely followed by Guilty Crown.
<@!139432096023183360> What's the worst anime you've ever seen?
Shuffle was also pretty ecchi.
Fair; that's something I discuss somewhat in my essay.
Maybe we'll get another eroge adaptation that's an actual anime and not a hentai.
What surprised me the most is that you can stream it.
Same.
https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/eerq9n/wt_yosuga_no_sora_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/?
It's good.
Yes.
She got isekai'd and ended up homeless before getting a job as a dishwasher.
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>

"Huh, I wonder what Elfnein's up to nowadays?"
Why does Yorimoi hurt so much?
Nothing about Symphogear is scientific.
