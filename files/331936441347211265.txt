Tanegashima!?
Yeah that
I've actually been there to view a rocket launch once. Rural as heck
||The place they launch the rocket to go to the moon||
Tanegashima does not work like that rockets are not launched from the north of the island TNSC does not look like that I have been there aaaaaa <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Symphogear is, in fact, very good.
Wasn't talking about the moon, but Tanegashima
desssssss
As for what it is or how to get there, I can't say. I don't think anyone can.
If you don't give up, you will be able to see the light. No matter how far away or how dim, no matter how many times you think it's a lie.
I suppose all I can do is apologize, as I can never understand how you feel.
It's true that reality's harsh, and sometimes you'll run into a wall for no good reason. There's nothing I can say to that.
There's a saying about how if you work hard and keep at it then everything will be alright and you'll achieve your dreams. I don't like that saying. I think it's a lie. But the one thing true about it is that the only way to lose that light is to give up.
And how thick are the cards?
Do you have a powerful electromagnet?
Do NOT do that.
Do not do that.
I definetely remember you acting... quite weird after that.
Wasn't it drugged the last time you smelled some?
Yeah.
But I highly doubt that.
Even if he was just a middleman, he'd still be hired by someone. Unless he was hired through a middleman.
At least, every courier I've had wore a uniform, delivered other parcels and required a signature on delivery.
Couriers usually don't deliver unlabelled envelopes, especially ones that are drugged.
Yeah.
Delivering unlabelled envelopes?
If it's been tagged with a GPS or other electronic tracking device, a powerful electromagnet should be enough to destroy it.

Probably my favorite band.

Huh.
I'll have to find and watch these. Still haven't watched the AXZ ones yet too.
Got it, thanks.
Or the AXZ ones, for that matter.
Actually, does anyone know where I even can watch the XV shinais?
I know, I'm terrible.
Mostly because I haven't been able to find them.
Wait, 3? Is there a 2 as well?
Cheers.
New shinai uploaded somewhere yet?
