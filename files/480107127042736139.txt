Thanks! üôÇ
And Yggdrasil is Nordic
So Shem-ha is Kabbalah
Ichaivel is Norse
Is the only defensive attack i've seen
thing
Also that knife shield
Oh.
Thats good that they can't purge there armour
Huh
Wait I thought all people could do that
Airgetlam is the special snowflake üôÇ
Gungnir can kill gods
Like Airgetlam can control Energy vectors
Wait doesn't every Gear have special abillities?
Oh I see
What happened to the whole Shirabe being Fine's descendant??
Um I have a question
I wonder what she would look like in Ignite form
*white like the granny nextdoor*
Miku possessed by Shem-ha, Dyes her hair before dying.
I think  this headset would fit better
Shemha: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Turns out Shem Ha looks like that thing Tiki turned into
Digimon
Symphogear but
If that happens
Shenshoujing has rays that can destroy relics right?
Also thinking about it
There would be brighter colours
Also I think
It looks like a vr headset
Yeahh
It just
Idk why
I want this thing replaced
Oh I see
*I mean canonically*
Because the contraption around her head was like a mind control thing
Would It change?
I wonder if she were to get Shenshoujing back
Oh
Season 7: Ayy Lmaooo
Dainsleif Shenshoujing *Oh wait*
How does she become a user again in Xdu
Oh well
Would it even be possible??
But she is a natural candidate
I know that will probably never happen
I really want Miku to become a symphogear again
Big gay.
What does Orange and Purple make?
And Shem ha dies
Mega Hibiki flicks SHem ha
They all fuse together and become mega hibiki
HAH.
And start beating up the now exposed Shem ha
Classical anime characters appear
Hibiki opens up portals from other dimensions
...
Crossover*
sYMPHOGEAR Becomes a Bayonetta Eva corssover
Kanade somehow appears again
And then she makes SHenshoujing again, and then turns into dust
SHem ha accidentally flings Ryouko back from the dead
Hibiki punches Shem Ha so hard she gets flung into another universe
Oh Noble red is just there in the background
And no wives die.
And then we have a happily everafter
Turns out Carol kills Shem Ha with the power of some untold forbidden alchemy
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh god
I don't theorize this
Don't worry
Miku turns into another moon
tURNS OUT
mE TOO
Season 7: AYY LMAOO
Omg
TuRNS out Symphogear has jsut been a very very long dream
üôÇ
Brighter
I want it to be
It's so dark though
And all the wives can be big gay together
Because SHem ha is dead
Every is happy
She makes Shenshoujing
Elfnein learns how to make relics
Noble red is just there in the background
The power of friendship, big gay and brown.
Hibiki becomes every shounen protagonist ever and kills SHem ha with the power of friendship and big gay
ERRADICATION
Super rabbit on the moon, IRON MAIDEN gauntlet Hibiki Style Super omega drop punch slice sigma style Blue flash, Alice in wonderland : Guillotine blades Baby's ‚úù cradle
What would the attack be called
Miku
Because
And then theres a mirror infront of the Gauntlet
perfection.
yes.
oH
Z DRIVE
Boosts the power so much they reach the unattainable
Somehow
Stronger*
And instead of erradicating gears she makes them stornger
Miku;s sYMPHOGEAR POwer gets reversed
ANd then they kill Shem Ha
And then Miku floats down and makes it stronger with a mirror
All of the girls combining there gears together
tBH I would rather
MIRROR PUNCH
They actually become brown
No
Yeah.
All of the girls survive because there the bridemaids
Hibiki aswell
Miku survives because the power of Big Gay Protects her
um
Noble Red gets redeemed
Elfnein and Carol share there body
um
Micha regrows her arm/leg
The spare bodies come back to life somehow
Noble Red in the background
And then all the wives live happily everafter
And then they both punch SHem ha into the sun
Hibiki dances around and summons the spirit of Big Gay
Yes.
There üôÇ
Hibiki just punches Shem ha into the sun.
they um.
Okay
Oh
Which also say Big Gay
And then Miku has her fist entwined with Hibiki's
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
And hibiki smirking
Saying big gay
A gauntlet with gem encrusted letters on it's knuckles
I'm just imagining
Omg
Her fist is big gay.
She fights with big gay
She doesn't fist fight,
I think all of the girls killing Shem ha with there fused weapon with a mirror at the front of somewhere is cool though
I have loads of ideas
üôÇ
I like making weird "theories" that I don't actually believe to annoy people
Yup
in americ
And Ryouko is actually alive
tURNS OUT Ryouko's death was an illusion
Fine multiplies herself
Makes all the girls symphogear users somehow
And then the little girl um
Even though Fine's soul died
And the little sister somehow gets the soul of fine
Ryouko's little sister we didn't know about somehow grows up
And Miku and Hibiki become the goddesses of big gay
And then thye all live happily ever after
So Kanade becomes a symphogear and miku
*They go to hell and get Kanade back and Ryouko*
I wonder what Season six would be about if the series doesn't get cancelled and season five wasn't the last season
Season six and seven: AYY LMAOOO
Becomes the Alchemist trio all over again
Noble Red um

GASP.
GSP.
For not crushed people
She fell down a hole got transported into a special facility
She didn't actually get crushed
Kanade appears and Serena appears
It's super cool songs
But instead of climax song
All of the Symphogears sing at the same time
Omg
I like talking about Noise üôÇ
pachand noise



They actually fight on the sun
but
Shem ha and Bikki fights on the moon
Turns out
Means that they wre basically the devil (s)
Devils with a plural
In Sumerian and ancient Mesopotamian religion, gall√ªs (also called gallas; Akkadian gall√ª < Sumerian gal.lu) were great demons or devils of the ancient Mesopotamian Underworld.
huh
*Actually swears in there language*
*Makes up chant*
So we can understand it
I hope they post an official alphabet
Oh
What is the language that the chants are spoke in?
||your mom your mom your mom|| < This right here is very spoilery
what have i done
oh god
Shouldn't this be in off topic??
uM.
Okay then
Don't spoil pls
Theres a new episode?!
Wait
Um.
Was it so üî• that even Tsubasa became üî•
üî• üî•

Oh sorry
I'll walk out
Spoil

Don't spoil pls
Were they hinting at Shenshoujing at the end of Season 4???
Okay i'm just gonna be serious
Milaarc becomes Bayonetta
Oh my gungnir
Before the credits
The very end
It's at the end
Well kind've
And Hibiki is like being poetic
No when Miku and Hibiki is out on that balcony thing
*HMM*
It also has a bit of Darkwave at the start
Wait the ending theme of season 4's last episode
And realized that,
I rewatched the last season 4 episode
You can hear bits of Darkwave in some of Miku's non Shenshoujing themes
I just realised
Okay so
ü§î
*killiter ~~yewfelle~~ tron*
*killiter ichaivel tron*
ü§î
I wonder if Relic's powers are just based around belief
So this is the reason why Airgetlam was so flashy and sparkly
In Irish mythology, Nuada or Nuadu (modern spelling: Nuadha), known by the epithet Airgetl√°m (modern spelling: Airgeatl√°mh, meaning "silver hand/arm"), was the first king of the Tuatha D√© Danann. He is cognate with the Gaulish and British god Nodens. His Welsh equivalent is Nudd or Lludd Llaw Eraint.
nUDA*
didn't know Nuba apparently wielded a severed arm
üò†
Miku has plot armour
Nora is based around Thor (The creators confirmed she comes from Atlas), and Ren is based around Mulan
Apparently
It's this
The nuckelavee ( /n åkl…ëÀêÀàviÀê/) or nuckalavee is a horse-like demon from Orcadian mythology that combines equine and human elements. It has its origins in Norse mythology, and British folklorist Katharine Briggs called it "the nastiest"[1] of all the demons of Scotland's Northern Isles. The nuckelavee's breath was thought to wilt crops and sicken livestock, and the creature was held responsible for droughts and epidemics on land despite being predominantly a sea-dweller.

A graphic description of the nuckelavee as it appears on land was given by an islander who claimed to have had a confrontation with it, but accounts describing the details of the creature's appearance are inconsistent. In common with many other sea monsters it is unable to tolerate fresh water, therefore those it is pursuing have only to cross a river or stream to be rid of it. The nuckelavee is kept in confinement during the summer months by the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient Orcadian spirit, and the only one able to control it.

Orcadian folklore had a strong Scandinavian influence, and it may be that the nuckelavee is a composite of a water horse from Celtic mythology and a creature imported by the Norsemen. As with similar malevolent entities such as the kelpie, it possibly offered an explanation for incidents that islanders in ancient times could not otherwise understand.
I-
Hibiki punches HIbiki and punches Hibiki and Punches Hibiki
Hibiki Punches the Universe
Gungnir can destroy divine weapons right?
Oh lol
That she can sing if she wants
that powerful
Carol is just
Why does Carol sing again?
Because her gungnir just dissolved
She would have to have another symphogear
If Kanade were too come back
Hibiki punches the universe and makes Kanade and Serena appear from a rift in time.
Oh yeah theres gonna be another season
Kaneko is lke
She was alive all alonggg
Serena pulls the rubble off of her
Kanade appears and Serena Appears

Miku: Hibiki punches so hard <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
The tables turned

Hibiki goes MEGA Z-DRIVE
What about
Omg
Fakeness*
Chris accidentally kills everyone with her fakness
And live happily everafter
And have children
And then thye get married
Yay
Hibiki is like
guns guns guns guns
Also are the Relic's powers based around belief?
I was rewatching season 1
I know
mHM
Sorry I was a bit confused because they said in the first episode Chris appeared in  "A new symphogear user as appeared" in it's desc
Also was the Neshusthan a full relic symphogear???
And blasts off into space
And gives miku back
Turns out Shem ha becomes nice again
And they befriend a male villain
Kaneko pranks us and makes the next season
Explodes
Exlodes
And then Shem ha
And she'll die
And then Hibiki will punch Shem Ha
A big eye monster.
Um
She becomes
Vanessa: Stil going I guess.
Elza: üò¶
Milaarc: swatted out of existence
*OH WAIT*
Noble Red and the Symphogears all combine there weapons to make a gigantic weapon which beats up Shem ha
*Insert another montage of Miku yelling Hibiki's name*
*Insert montage of Hibiki and the others saying Miku*
It was a <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I know
With the power of rainbow farts and explosive friendship, she also has rainbow hair and the power to make rainbow blasts of rianbow energy that convert people into njoise which then implode
Shem ha punches a hole in space time reality and suddenly bayonetta sonic hybrid appears from the rift and has a symphogear and she kills Shem ha
Lemme make up a mary sue real quick
Wait
Yeah.
God dang it
You have to link me this omg

jk
Jk
Shem ha accidentally explodes a cave, Hibiki's lost twin sister appears with insert fancy relic name and kills Shem ha
Huh.
I know this is a dumb question and it aws probably not confirmed, but is there a chance theres other Symphogears that haven't been used?
Because Fairies
Not even Enki has a connection to Dragons
It looks cool and all but how is this connected to fairies
ü§î
But like
Like I can see that Tsubasa's imago is one of those sword
Also what even is Maria's Imago
I wanna see how ridiculous Chris's Imago will be
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
I forgot this was Symphogear we were talking about
I think the Yoyos are just extensions of those blades or something
It displays her relic number when she transforms
Yeah
What even are those
I mean i'm pretty sure the real weapon is Shirabe's blade things around her hair
True
I never really see that with Hibiki's attacks
Gungnir in legend is a spear that never misses
I see.
Ohh
Same.
Change my mind.
S1 was the best season.
Turns out on this episode Miku's spirit appears and sings german waikyo shenshoujing
Meteor
yeah
Like I hate it
same thing Avatar said
Because
I never use Kissanime
rekt
Jk
:OOO
Turns out this is what chris does in the final episode
https://i.imgur.com/oiUqmqJ.gif
Time for the Ceremonial watching all of the episodes
I will
Idk
Um
True
Oh
Miku die
But does
I haven't watched the episode yet
This is all I need to know.
did*
this miku die
um
KaNaDe CoMiNg BaCk CoNfIrMeD?
OMg
Okay
I
I just realized the ending of the ending theme has a purple star
But
THis is really offtopic
I know
Wait she looks like a magical girl from pecure
It's faker then a balloon thigh
*FAKE*
If only it wasn't
Ichaivel sounds cool
A fake bow >>
Ichaivel is a bow
Kanade and Serena come back
Omg
<:KanadeSit:535301654464036884>
Bring my red hair back pls
Because I feel like she's been neglected alot
I'm glad Kanade has a bit of a fragment left
Hibiki Saint Germain, Kanade hybrid
OKay i'll stop
SYMPHO...GEARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
symphoGEARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
If Hibiki shouts "SYMPHOGEARRRRRRRRR"
This season will offically be the best
OKay
The faust robe becomes a miracle and becomes a symphogear
HMM
When she's supposed to be saying "Garbage."
"Cabbage"
I can dreamm
shhh
And then they live happily ever afte
And brings Shenshoujing back
Carol crafts a miracle
Shirabe's favourite vegetable is Cabbage
üôÇ
üò¨
Yikes
They haven't learned
Symphogear better comeback
üôÇ
FOREVER
BECAUSE IT'LL BE IN OUR HEARTS
IT'S NOT GONNA END
I don't want this to be the end of Symphogearrr
Kaneko: hmm does another season
forever
Fine is now dead
Anyways
She just said a few words before turning into dust
She didn't do anything physical to make up for what she did
She gets redeemed
And then when she sacrifices herself for Shirabe to live
It's the start of redemption arc when she gets cremated
I'm going with she gets redeemed in G
I-
Why are-
oH
To*
*She had a spear, and knew how do you use it*
Kanade was in my opinion most likely stronger then Hibiki
Imagine how strong Miku would be
Wait maybe her low backfire was due to the Airgetlam's abillity to control Energy Vectors?
She was able to use it without a really bad backfire
I think since her sister wielded the Airgetlam fine
Also I thought about this and I know this is off-topic, but is it possible that Ichaivel's philosphical armanent has the power to make anything into a projectile?
I think she can't wield other Gears imo
üò¨ Sorry
She could wield the Durandal
Without having injuries?
So Hibiki could sing a Superb song
Now I see why Hibiki's armour is based around agillity
Gungnir in legend is the unmissable spear
Sorry I forgot that
True
*Yikes*
ü§¶
And theres a person who's defending Fudou
Wiki
I just looked at the wii
People respect Fudou?
Not as populr
It's just
Puella Magi wiki's still around
Consider yourself lucky
Thats why I hate Fudou
THats not what a true protector does.
He might've wanted to protect his country, but at the expense of human lives.
Very
Kanade's Death, Other stuff, litterally watching a girl die before her in the same situation
She's just went through alot of mental pain
Tsubasa is strong aswell
Thats why I stay off the wiki because üò¨
*He said his family was useless.*
Another comment
"Well, his family was pretty much "useless"...

His sons were such disappointment that he planed to give his succesion to his daughter/grand-daughter, which in the end was an even biggest disappointment.
Honestly, they were fighting with things like songs, hopes and miracles to reach a world were peoples would be able to understand each other ? Just ridicule.

The nation needed a weapon of absolute power and he obtained it, threw away things like emotions or morales all those years ago for the sake of this mission for the nation.

You see this man as a monter because you can't understand his action, but he was willing to even threw away his own life for his goal.

I respect this man."
Mhm
Basically put Tsubasa through Mental trauma
Killed loads of people
I.E Episode 2
He put his daughter in massive danger
Exactly
People who support Fudou are people who don't know family.
Exactly
A litterall
A quote
"What purpose ? Obtaining the Divine Power and weaponized it for his exclusive used ... for the sake of the country, of course ... Also because it would be more far effective than the Symphogear and perhaps because he can't stomach the singing part of it.

"a very broken morale as well" ? Well as long as you realize you can live in comfort because some people with "a very broken morale" did what they have to do in certain situation is fine by me.
Is your reasoning is within the content of the first paragraph ?

He would seem to fit the description, except that is not incompetent, a coward and inexperienced and some others  ... So while the term would not suit him in the end, I see yout idea."
üò¨
I
Fudou litterally brainwashed Tsubasa, used her for his gain and tried to kill his relatives
Oop
But they had a faust robe
Also did th eLapis Philosphum have a aufwachen waveform just like the Dur Da Bla?
Deader then a dead spider
Fine
Oh gee
I drew Tsubasa smilin
Miku loves getting punched btw
I don't want it to end üò¶

Who doesn't know what Shenshoujing bloody is
Yeah.
Faust Robe-
Miku-
Shenshoujing-
I-
Shenshoujing destroys everyone's relics
or
Shenshoujing implodes and Shem Ha becomes a black hole and everyone dies
How did a piece of a severed arm become a piece
What i'm questioning is
Just me.
Just me?
Like maybe she wouldn't be so neglected in recent seasons
I wish Kanade has been more of a Character though
I was joking tho
Jk
Tsubasa coughs up some of Kanade's dust and Kanade appears
And punch into Shem Ha
And they both combine there weapons into Hibiki's
Kanade comes back but as a spirit and Saint Germain aswell
And kills every evil custodian with the power of big gay
Hibiki becomes half Kanade half Saint Germain

If Anime was realistic al of the time where would it's plot go
Anime needs realism, but not to the extent you are stating.
But theres a boundary between real life and anime
But anime is not real life
But saying that a character doesn't need to finish there character arc is defeating the whole purpose of what a character arc is
Not just dying in the middle of it
For development
Thats the whole reason for a story arc
They do
Armados has a Yugi-oh profile picture though
Symphogear 2.0
Plot armour
Magia record has
*Has flashbacks*
*MADOKA*
Jk
If there characters then does that mean were characters
All characters are characters because there called characters.
But Shirabe and Kirika got loads of development
They got development
Jk
Shirabe and Kirika?
Oh
Time and time again
She went through so much trauma
Tsubasa feels like a character though
And was only there for shock factor and too stop Hibiki from basically Dying
Shenshoujing was a plot plot device
But became a plot device
She had development in G
Imo

Chris accidentally blows everyone up
Symphogear isn't Naruto-
Shem ha won't sacrifice herself
For all we know
Fine is weird.

She did sacrifice herself
WHOOPS
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT

Characters *are writing tools*
Because they drive the plot
All characters are plot points
But
oH.
?!
||NEW SYMPHOGEAR??!?!?!?||
||There deader then dead there angels :)||
||nO.||
||WHAT DOES THAT SAY||
It was symbolic
The scorpion was the extinct species mentioned
Wait Maria and Serena came from Chernobyl?
In my heart it's still a symphogear...
Shhh
Wait so Miku regained her Symphogear?
zizzl
rei...
rei... shenshoujing....
SYMGEAH
A PARODY OF MEGUCA
I COULD WRITE A WHOLE THING
Wait
"CONTRACT"
And then rewrites it with distortion
And she destroyss the universe
Miku's love for Hibiki fisting her makes her regain shenshoujing
Miku becomes Homura
Tsubasa and Kanade
Chris is straight tho
i sing...
Zizzl
huh
Wait does Miku's chant have tron at the end?
fAUST ROBEs are activated through alchemy
yEAH
Because she sang the chant
I like to believe that Miku is wielding a Symphogear
Did Shem ha do that???
But why would she need to transform into a faust robe with a chant???
but it was an activation chant
Maybe an Animation error?
But they needed 7 relics/Symphogears
Thye don't have a chat do they?
Also the other faust robes
It's not she just plays a melody
Not a symphogear
And also Dur Da Bla was a full relic
But you see, that wasn't a chant, it was a melody
Not song
But how?
New symphogears
Symphogear will continue boi
Movie
Welp
Symphogear's twitter: New Movie coming out next year!
A few days later,
Rei shenshoujing.. rei zizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzl
not really
Yeahhhh,
^
S1 is too special.
It's super hard to make an hour of animation
I was joking, and I know
And Hibiki is Orange
Because Miku is purple
Ametrine
Also i'm gonna call Miku and Hibiki together
They all get faust robes
It will most likely have movies.
Thats what I meant
Yeah
You can't be stuck like this lol
Symphogear is most likely going to continue, but for now you should move on
i
(She litteralyl is the reason why Carol was there
(Elfnein isn't useless*
i cried
She did
Idk
um
Miku has ptsd
Shem ha is like: I'M BACKKKKKKKKK
Also litterally the staff have said Miku And Hibiki are like a married couple so like
Hibiki is every senpai ever*
Hibiki is senpai ever.
I-
SHEM HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Are the Va's for Maria, Shirabe and KIrika idols?
wAIT
WAR CRY.
Without having that
I don't think HIbiki will be Hibiki
Excuse
Every symphogear girl becomes an idol
Elfnein can't age
Oh.
They'll probably get another va
Dino
They've suffered for like five seasons
Suffering is badd
Her voice crack goes into another va
Tsubasa has a voice crack
Hm
OH
Does Aigis replace Ssj?
AIgis?
I was joking lol
DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNNN
Shem ha possesses Hibiki o-o
jk
JK
How about in a parralel universe Hibiki didn't fly Miku into that beam and Hibiki's belief in Miku being good made her her philosphical armanent turn to the exact opposite
Weren't Carol's Autoscorer's roles to get memories or something
Alright then
This channel is for posting about XV
Post that in nonsymphogear-spoilers
The main cast should reflect RWBY and JNPR
Wait MAria has a copy move
Then who is Weiss
I think he's too far gone
Why does he had a co-writer
But the real question is

*Cough cough*
Whenever I stumble on a good fanfic I feel bad, because
I-
He has a co-writer?
What happened?
Sorry
OHH
I think what happened is that this guy stole a german Waikyo Shenshoujing covere
I think this is whats happening

gun!
bang!
I-
And he half framed Noble Red or something
Fudou is the real one who did that massacre (He basically is)
They could've made it so
Milaarc killed a person üò¶
I THINK NOT
Same
Lewd
Oh no
I SWEAR
I saw it
There is
MIKU AND HIBIKI
I MEAN
what
Wait
Miku and Yang
Yeah
Hibiki = Yang
Weiss= Tsubasa
Ruby = Idk
Blake= Miku

Cause thats lewd
Porn is just handholding
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Okay then.
Do they have Miku's new transformation
Wait
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>

Because the roche limit
Around the earth
The moon fragment should've been turned into a ring
Technically
If the moon were to blow up we would be ripped apart by tides
They would be dead
If the moon had blown up
Didn't the Nazi's hate art?
Reminds me of those Tumblr people
