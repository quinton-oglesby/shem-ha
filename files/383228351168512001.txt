<:ShamikoDisgust:621650530309242891>
<:SerenaOhoho:671901865625124870>
Or so I heard
Meanwhile in Europe if someone does that expect to fight to the death or run away <:citrus:655091923048071168>
Expect to hear a few comments in your face but not in an aggressive/confrontational way I guess
I leave my laptop and sometimes my phone on the table when I go to the washroom say at a caf√© or something
Asians are notorious for not knowing to keep their stuff safe in places like Europe or the US
Ye idk too much but think US and white teeth or Italy and dem biceps
Tbh thats an exaggeration ofc most people are p normal but some people do fit the stereotype
<:citrus:655091923048071168>
More like everyone following the same trends so they look like randomly-generated npcs using the same few assets with a few colour variations
<a:WWHA:589796892204990466>
Go visit .o0. I heard they're a cool guy. <:circles:526351866368491520>
<:SerenaOhoho:671901865625124870>
Poland is p... conservative
<:S3AYAYA:681632873069150230>
so most of the time that's not going to be a good thing to say unironically
but even if that's the case you can still come off as really bigotted for a good reason most of the time so <:shrugg:694646429439885433>
to be fair tho, in reality I wouldn't put it against someone who's literally lived their whole lives in a place that's largely homogeneous to be uncertain about dating people outside their circle
So context does play into it.... kinda (probably shouldn't be so callous with phrasing tho)
"Sorry, ..."
"Sorry, I don't do Black people"
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
"Sorry, I'm not into Asians"
<:shrugg:694646429439885433>
so
yeah that's why some people are really against it
<@!203444794737950720>
> Wait what, what's wrong with being into asians?
it's just considered sexual and sometimes racist and fetishistic and objectifying
just a bunch of words and concepts most can't really appreciate the gravity of
tbh, in places where a vast a majority of the people or of one "type", stuff like "racism" and "stereotypes" are about as foreign a concept as say "public executions" or "slavery" for most people privileged enough to be on this server <:citrus:655091923048071168>
~~and whether or not your society is accepting of such forms of discrimination/distinction in the first place~~
whether it's more innocuous or more insidious
to be blunt the social associations with certain characteristics do come into play
it jumps around the line a bit
still not a very "nice" thing to say but <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
just to stay on the lighter side of things
asians -> small etc.
sometimes it does have to do with physical stuff tho
but that's where objectification kinda comes in...
whether that's silly or creepy depends on the context <:citrus:655091923048071168>
yeah it's a lot more casual in europe
parents just don't know how to deal with/help their kids sometimes but they feel like they have to do *something* and sometimes it leads to *bad* results <:DEDESS:434136208721969182> <:notlikemiya:359592618214031360>
imagine using therapy as a threat for someone who is apprehensive about getting help or because they aren't solving their own problems/what seem to be problems quick enough <:smugTohru:735385702333677619> <:heh:589088107585077257>
either way that's downright exploitative I'd say
~~or has he already dumped in thousands of dollars over dozens of months so that wouldn't be worth it either~~

could he ask for a refund at the risk of getting his account banned

<:animejanai:740391674534166548>

Someone else: "1XX dollars? Mustve gotten more expensive"

And theyre at the pharmacy so the people at the pharmacy cant do anything
<:harold:671899719940833291>

Always kinda sucks to see someone dealing with bills from healthcare
Rip people complaining about cost of medicine
ICBMs might wipe out a city but the real tragedy is going to happen *after* the attack
China might devolve into Warring Period 2 with all sorts of proxies too
If the situation over at the Middle East has told us anything it's that if too many players hold a reasonable stake...
Potentially catastrophic, understandably
If a crisis of that nature ever happens I'd expect it to be a relatively short one (other than perhaps the fallout from such an event... nuclear or otherwise)
Well if enough places want to break off there would be more of a limit on how much power Beijing can exert but I think theyve done a decent job of making most of the Han Chinese indifferent to the concept of autonomy.
But if its coming I hope it comes about in a sufficiently peaceful and undisruptive way
I just hope Xi's consolidating power to make some positive changes that might otherwise be met with resistance... But I think that's wishful thinking

Even if he pockets some of the "winnings" for himself, it sure would be great if China managed to... un-evilify itself <:citrus:655091923048071168>
> once NK falls down (and it can, from one day to the other), there will be *no* cushion state to slow/stop the americanization of china from SK influence
Or it could lead to a conflict right at the Chinese-Korean border <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Ironic cuz I sound more native in Chinese than Korean almost
I speak Chinese but theres a very strong invisible barrier when it comes to mainlanders
The problem with China is that the younger generation neither knows nor cares about whatever issues surrounding China
Welp
True
So eh
But in some ways they are reaping what they've sown... some of them at least
I really wish Europe could be stronger economically rn
Its actually a big headache(?) of mine
China's creeping rise as an international superpower
Both in terms of my prospective future career, humanitarian concerns, the geopolitical situation, etc.
Well, maybe I should have made it more obvious I wasnt saying that it was a good idea
Surprising how everyone is in agreement eh
Concessions concessions and more concessions
Nobody bat an eye to whatever china does until simon says...
Thats where the last part comes in
<a:15min:585535658567663627>
Easiest way to make amends
Nuke China
Out Trump
Apologise to China
Build monuments and things
Life goes on as normal... but with more China in everyones lives
Like what's going on in Ukraine
Which is why it's actually bad news less for US and China but more for smaller countries within their desired spheres of influence
To be honest if it were just between two countries life might be hell for those involved (even if it is literally US vs China) life might go on only just slightly differently
Oh boy
But imagine if US and China decided to threaten to raze each others' biggest cities to the ground and acted on it every few days
Trudat
Might have people misunderstanding and stuffs
Dont think you need to apologise but ye it was a good idea to yeet the msg
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:thinkhole:567202654657314817>
Can men and men be just friends?
Yup
Heh
Genghis Khan no. 2 when
SK and Taiwan would at least do fine if they could afford to ignore the region but welp
Its just kinda sad the whole region is infested with problems
But thats not to say both koreas werent/arent despotic in many senses
SK formed from UN-led elections
European countries might still be full of banter but at least different duchies arent constantly warring over borders except russia heh
Ofc not saying it ought to happen not at all wew
All in all WW2 did wonders for Europe in some senses
Heh
Tbh the fastest path to any sort of ameliorisation of tension a l√† Europe might be a proper genocidal war or two tbh
JP and CN are jsut p cursed in general tbh
Eh their spiel about honour and the like points to any sort of actual change being highly unlikely
That said CN is like the epitome of a populace who just cant be bothered or are unironically brainwashed
And the general populace just cant relate to CN and KR because they really lack the info amd perspective
Tbh not really iirc
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721> were they tho idk
I used to think it was about time for China and Korea + a few other countries to slowly let it go but hoo boi
~~also infamous in some countries for visiting the yasukuni shrine and for his right-leaning stance + blatant nepotism and corruption~~
~~tfw his wife is the daughter of a war criminal who got protection in return for outing others~~
Its like trying to diffuse discovered bomb in the smcity centre without evacuating the people
A simple cop-out either tho tbh
~~tbh us vs china can go either way in makin the world better or destroying it~~
Theres a significant proportion of the population in every country acting like they are the countries themselves in some of the wordt ways possible so ye
But the region being as it is...
Tbh as an individual it shouldnt matter as much all things considered
I mean even wars were really about economy and trade so
Trump just skipping SK and going straight to NK or calling TW for example
SK as a country has to constantly put in effort if it wants to even play a part in the region tbh
SK really wants some of that chinese market but i think people already realise at least in part working with china is shooting yourself in the foot
China got absolutely massacred tho
Also helped that Japan and China were decently large
Ye they managed to consolidate power into a nice little oligarchy
Heh
A lot of what is unfolding around the world today unfortunately does have to do with a few key decisions made by the few people who were in a position to make decisions... which as repetitive and contrived as it may sound, often leads to, you guessed it, "the western powers"
You do see parallels in Africa tbh <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Like the US working with and giving power in KR to rich peeps who got to stay rich cuz they cooperated with the jp peeps
Or the US not trying war criminals due to reasons
Etc.
Other than "the west just messed up the area for the sake of their own interests/convenience"
I guess in the context of CN and KR usually they focus less on what Western powers have done
But JP people being the way they are it really doesnt create a nice and accepting environment in JP itself even
I mean people usually direct their discontent towards the jp government and the continued grasp on power by essentially the same "bloodline" as in the imperial times
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
But yeah I used to think people were too sensitive about these issues but I guess I'm more aware of why things are the way they are and how there isnt a clear, un-icky solution to this wiremesh of problems in the region
It was considered ironic cuz the whole series is about fighting agajnst oppression and stuffs heh
Got leaked or something iirc
It was kinda his private opinion tho so cant say I dont pity him at all
Heh
Ironic that the creator of SnK was bashed for saying JP helped develop SK or something
As in GATE or stuffs
When it comes to anything political
The left are treated like trash
The rights still mainstream fwiw
You can p much see it directly reflected even in anime
They sure arent becoming any less right wing heh
Maybe Im alr getting old I feel like Im getting tired of these issues slightly alr oh no
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
The same cant really be said for the rest of the region
SK and Taiwan left to their own accord do look like they might progress as a society
Not a nice history
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Is it Mussolini now then? Heh
SALVINIIII
Tbh without context he looks charismatic
It sucks that reasonable arguments are being drowned out by friction tbh
Cant bring up valid points and try to work on the details when people are threatening the stability of society itself

.o0 is but circles
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611> maybe
I mean I can deffo see some of these sentences being written down on history books from the point of view of a few hypothetical futures
"Trump was ultimately right to contest the rise of China despite many ..."
"Trump catalysed the fall of the US as a world superpower due to his handling of..."
"The fall of Europe came after it accepted too many immigrants without a proper plan for..."
"The acceptance of immigrants ultimately managed to counteract many of the problems plaguing Europe by..."
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Imagine having the will of the people
To be honest a lot of the actions taken now will be viewed under the lens of hindsight in the future and I'd say few can really say what action would ultimately have been "right" anyway

Which is why the world is up in flames, quite literally in some places
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Heh

<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
The solution is obvs for Europe to take the lead but oh boiii
So yeah not the smartest idea either way
Might turn out that you lose only a lil and you didnt need the inconvenience of moving everyone out
Or maybe the whole city might be flattened and everyone ded
inhibit the rise of fascism

Welpp
Tbh it sounds like the plot of some 00s movie
Yeah, figured as much.
I see
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Tbh the premise itself doesnt sound so outlandish but am I missing some context
Yeah, sorry for not being too much of a help. I hope the situation works out somehow. Best of luck to you Gwen.
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>

Way easier to convince a few Chinese peeps that purging and lynching the whole CCP and the upper echelons of the Chinese military and replacing them with CIA figureheads is in the best interests of everyone <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>

Maybe even offer some of the occupied nations liberation with a truckload of strings attached

Then just slowly crumble down the legion of nouveau-riche or send some of them away for greater international presence and influence and mess with the local poor a little more and create a 2nd US of A üëç

Unchecked runaway capitalism with just a little less human rights abuses and "socially incompatible" criminal/overtly discriminatory policies

Set up a "temporary" restricted voting system and watch China rise to the top of the world in the wake of everyone else's dying economy and voil√†
or at least that's what the focus should be on, unlike what's being done in many palces

If trump (or pence who knows) wins 2020 imma finally put down my foot and decide on not working or even studying in the US despite big IT moniess

Might be a weight off my shoulders who knows

Maybe a kind of guilty pleasure of not having to take the hard route getting used to a new environment and gathering funds for further studies or for the move cuz US wont be worth it anymore

China might prove to be a bigger headache in the future tho <:GWossuKannaSip:395627468276367370>
Tbh the best thing for the US of A might be Biden just winning with a comfortable margin against Trump with Trump losing just enough steam to not cause a big ruckus nationwide as he exits
Him being a lil sick and maybe weakened like BoJo tho... ü§î 
That *might* be better than him just being completely asymptomatic and recovering after a couple of weeks
I think it was mostly known from the get-go that Trump kicking the bucket in either sense wasnt going to be in anyone's interests
You probably wont be able to convince her otherwise and the discord itll brew may not be worth it
Its a good middle ground

Just gotta expel Catholics and Conservatives from South Korea to eliminate the threat /s
Esp. wrt to a sudden incident
Really trust as in "least likely to go awry again"
I feel like you can really trust Singapore at least
New Zealand, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, maybe Japan (slightly stronger tendency to cover stuffs up + a slight rising trend(?) in no. of cases)
The only safe places are Oceana + parts of Asia
Tbh europe kinda on fire again
Luckily most younger peeps are sensible so you just need to stay away from old people /s but Bayesian/probabilistically this is actually kinda true ti an extent
Tbh KR never had a lockdown

Caf√©s were only allowed to do takeaways and restaurants were only allowed to do takeaways from 9pm to 5 am (basically preventing peeps from drinking or partying too much)

They even allowed a crazy conservative gathering to go ahead yeet (which caused a new spike up to.... 300 cases a day at its peak)

Invade China
Ask for reparations
That'll surely go well
Also those increased taxes might not go away
I mean you *can* prevent mass death while still keeping most things running
Hyperinflation go brrrrr
Might be better to manage 1/million a day than try to keep it at 0 by shutting down many industries or cutting off the flow of people esp. from overseas
There is a chance
But given that the death rate isnt like 100% i think its also good to consider balance
And you might think thats not that weird amongst smaller nations, but you'd surprised to know that smaller nations usually undergo change at about the same rate

:15min:
I wrote a lot but realised it's not going to contribute much and relay the nuance of what I mean so I'll just leave another important issue of how content stirs up things differently depending in the context

Also how content moderation works with a giant grey band and you have to choose between banning stuff overzealously or run into seemingly inconsistent rulings

Especially if/since you are expected to work with a hard line instead of a probabilistic/fuzzy one, the latter of which is actually something that could realistically work, but whose implementation would probably be full of holes given how it's not quite a standard anyone is used to at implementing/designing
But given how intentions and internal guidelines are a grey-box kinda thing it does bring into question if a sufficiently judicious system is possible under such dichotomies in power and influence esp. wrt to the US
I think trying to come up with a monolithical set of rules for a perfect system that is "unbiased" may be more of a hindrance than accepting certain flaws or biases in the system that stems from the multitude of end goals that people and organisations tend to have
A lot of media isn't just about the content itself but to whom and how the content is spread to incite certain responses
To get a "good" system going I think there will have to be a lot of seemingly biased judgements being made, at least with the current level of technology and society we're working with

We dont have to stop eating meat but the least we could do is try to work towards not slaughtering them en masse while putting them through such terrible conditions throughout their lives, at least incrementally
But it does require some planning  iirc
We can subsist on plant alone

Remember when Indonesia tried to name ships after "national heros" who bombed a McD's in SG a few decades back and SG went berserk over them honoring the "terrorists".
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Also yeah it kind of shows how much politics kind of affects everything in our lives in one way or another
But theyre probs more intelligible than Indi and Malay sometimes

Vs different variants of Spanish which are ???
But theyre variants of Hindustani
Urdu uses Persian words
Hindi uses Sanskrit words
Like spanish
North Germanic languages are standardised based on largely different dialects tho

Indonesian and Malay base themselves around the same topolect with strong differences in word usage
Urdu vs Hindustani
Or variants of Spanish
Ye
I mean, it's more of how it's viewed internally/socio-politically vs linguistically
More like Irish English vs Australian English
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
But obviously

Polyam usually leads to or stems from quite horrendous practices so I see why there are practical reasons it is not legally allowed in many countries
Dat asymmetry of power  tho <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
For organ donation the option tobopt out seems like a practical way to go tbh
Meanwhile, South Korea: abortion is illegal ü§°
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
The one on rape and the one on custody (and thereby child support)
To consider them 2 separate cases is quite horrid
Or have the man have automatic custody over the kid and whether they are sent for adoption etc.
Not how "fair" it is for the man
The law aims to help the child
But once the baby is born
Etc.
Since obviously abortion itself takes a toll on the woman's body (and psychology)

But say a woman raped a man and she got pregnant. Should a man not have the right to abort the baby especially given situations where the will not threaten the life of the woman?
Makes sense <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
ü§° <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
Instead of literally putting the woman's life in danger or forcing her to give birth

The discussion should be on how much of a right men have when they didnt consent to having a baby but the woman went ahead and got herself pregnant anyway (accident deception rape etc.)
I feel like the discussion should revolve around that more
Some people say men should have rights to keep the baby but I feel like their should have more rights to delete the baby instead  <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
üôÉ
Laws tho
Then they can put the child up for adoption or smth
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
Tbh in such cases they should be given custody at the very least no questions asked no
ü•≤
Alimony laws and the like are meant to balance the situation but it comes withba bunch of disadvantages too
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Marriage is generally not very good for eliminating certain kinds of abusive relationships
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
But yeah marriage as it had been is an overtly sexist practice almost worldwide
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Even if it's murder
üôÉ
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
Bring the discussion back on track
Time to
Organ donation: opt out
Abortion: right to abort (perhaps before n months where the child is reasonably human etc.) + some rights for the father (in terms of choosing to abort/deny responsibility, rather than that of keeping the child)
üëç
Ye iz gud

No escalate

<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
But I think it's not too egregrious in that regard
It is
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Last*
My grandfather literally passed away this Saturday
I think everyone should have the right to keep their body in one piece should they wish to
But there's so mucu inertia into optting in that I think opt-out is the way to go
You arent really forcing anyone into anything anyway
The right to control over your own frigging body is a very important one methinks
I feel like it's more fundamental than that
I think this trumps the fetus's right to live tbh

Someone's life vs some largely inanimate and unconscious cells
Kind of like insurance maybe
But if its in short supply (as it always is), it might not be so "unfair" that those who were willing to donate their own bodies are given more weight than those decided not to
Preferably yeah
üôÉ
Under an opt-out system
I wouldnt mind my parents donating their organs tbh
And having the choice is a big deal
You could appreciate the value of organ donation while still wanting to keep your loved ones intact

And in the cade of your body you may decide your own organs dont matter as much
Not necessarily
Wills dont justbaffect the dead after theyre ded
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
So like maybe your sister kills your dad cuz she's been taking care of him and the law will side with her
The dad knows this and leaves the house to you in the will
For inheritance etc.
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Not to mention
If wills couldnt protect people from err other people killing them prematurely or smth...
And wills definitelt make sense
Etc.
But how are they to be treated?
Are they propertis of the government? Their families?
This and the above point basically tbh
But giving people a choice isn't without some kind of social value either
I could see the argument justifying forcing people to donate their organs if way too many "usable" bodies were "wasted" because everyine opted out
And people's literal socio-cultural values
The value of the corpse, perhaps, bu what about the desire for people to grieve?
I feel like it's not so unreasonable to forgo a human life for the sake of another in a situation like this
Up till a certain point the fertilised egg is more the woman than the child
Vs
Mum opted in to a stronger clause which prevents her next of kin to decide for her
Children has no say whatsoever
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Children should get some say?
Mum didnt opt-out, comatose
Children want to opt-out
This too
Doesnt sound too bad to give them however many minutes to opt out
What about people who havent made a choice
But their kids want to keep their bodies intact right after they found out about a sudden heart attack or smth
Makes sense
Would you like to opt-out for body donation? (Default is no)

If not, do you want to allow your next of kin to decide if your body is to be donated? (Default is yes)
Spouse child parents etc.
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Next of kin
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Default: donate except when next of kin stops the donation in time
Option to not donate
Option to donate (next of kin does not get to decide to not donate on your behalf)
Not override
Opt-out system with a stronger opt-in option to prevent your next of kin from not donating your organs.
You arent superseding anyone's rights tho
The next of kin having the option to opt-out on behalf of the person
Like comatose states
Or like in exceptional cases
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Just start prepping the body immediately unless stopped
No bureaucracy
üòî
Seems liek a reasonable policy
They are allowed to opt-out on behalf of the dead person by default
And the next of kin have enough time to reach the body
So in cases where there are
Or maybe even allow the next of kin to object to the donation unless the dead specifically say they wish to opt-in into a stronger version in an opt-out system
ü§î
<:KanadeAngry:672861874966233118>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
they are a low-level threat in-universe but they do b doing some debased things
to be fair tho Redo the Heal and even Shield Hero (haven't watched either in full tho)
do give off that "this show's gonna romanticise stuffs for repressed *-phobics" vibe
wow I should've known anyone who likes horror movies is a potential mass murderer on the loose <:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
I am tho it's up to you to explain the apparent dichotomy between this and that
Yeah I agree we should lock up g*mers cuz they shoot people in violent videogames üëå üëÆ
whomstve pung
oh
It's one thing to say "screw the bible" for it's misogynistic, homophobic or other hateful teachings and another to say "screw Christians" or "screw anyone who found any kind of moral, psychological or emotional support from the bible"

In that one is relatively understandable stance to take even for people who don't necessarily subscribe to the same opinion and the other just another slightly more well-hidden form of misdirected hate
btw this scene is the only part where you could really see the clownage i think
and other stuff about NATIONAL PRIORITY MILITARY NIPPON STRONK but those were really more backdrops
üç∑
can't let dem leftist try to make it sound like the military was committing genocide tho no way
tbh GATE felt more campy and insignificant so the actual jingoistic parts didn't stand out as much as it would have if were construed to be some kind of moral spotlight for the Japanese people of Nippon to follow
and like any other whole countries of people none of them would be above committing some sort of atrocity or another if they had the power to do so
but their hate for the current Japanese government is there for very good reasons
Believe me when I say the Chinese and Koreans aren't the most egalitarian bunch
the Japanese propaganda is working! <:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
kek
I would think countries like SK and China would've reacted badly but I don't have info on that so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
so even anti-hate movements/ideas have their own little spheres üåê
cancelled as in the cancel culture kind of way not the cancelled on TV kind of way
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
~~AoT got cancelled in South Korea cuz the author was an "apologist" of Japanese imperialism and "colonisation" of Asian territories~~
because it doesn't affect the usual groups of disadvantaged groups of people in the anglosphere <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
not saying they should be enraged as a result because it's not wrong for people to deal with what's closer to them first tho
bet that sort of jingoism harms a lot of people too tho
but because it's less targeted I guess that gets swept under the rug
It's a reflection of the modern Japanese regime and some may even say its existence does more harm than good but I still enjoyed it
GATE was very <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> indeed
same with videogames
a lot of videogames will attract sickos but calling anyone who likes a videogame that a certain school shooter or murderer (and I'm not referencing any particular case unlike what it may sound like)  liked a potential murderer is just redirecting all the pent up emotion which is yet another form of hate onto the wrong people (and because it's still a form of hate I have to add one would also need to discuss whether or not that hate was justified in the first place but I don't intend to say whether it was or wasn't and it's not the issue here so)
It's going to attract a lot of "undesirables" for sure but you're really not targeting the right people when you start calling anyone who enjoys any sort of debased content names
there's also a difference between finding the media distasteful and just considering anyone who likes that piece of media *-phobic outright
Literally did nothing other than trying to start a fight <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Obviously it didn't sit well with me that you'd do that, but I guess the hypocrisy isn't there since you were talking about something else.
Armis butting in, tho... <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Which was why I tried to quantify it with an "if", since I wouldn't be too sure what exactly you meant with just what you said.
Especially since OP was talking about people being "way too comfortable with assuming major things about someone‚Äôs life from a little information". Eh <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
could you please stop saying people are doing something that they aren't? cuz that'd be great üëº
but this I have a problem with <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
>talking back
oh well, just thought I should point it out
whether you think that's hypocritical in the end isn't up to me
not going to dwell on this much longer either
the "so little information" part applies tho <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
just brought it up since there's an apparent double standard
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
and thereby quite directly related to what they jsut posted
but the hate they showed towards people for watching a show in the past was quite monumental
sure, if you want me to stop, I oculd
I mean
if you mean the people who qrt, then that'd be quite hypocritical coming from someone who has no qualms about judging people for their tastes and opinions on a single show <:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
because I don't really welcome doing this here as well
could you help me tell her to do that
well, it wasn't me who didn't was it <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I did come in with a bit of hostile energy I admit, but I held it back precisely because I wasn't being presumptive üß†
so I'd say it was relevant to the discussion
to be fair I saw an apparent hypocrisy and pointed it out <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Sometimes I wish I could enjoy all the free time I have more honestly
That and enjoy it without some weird mix of bad sleep, stomachaches, allergies and a bunch of other minor problems exacerbated by one another.

huh, TIL, it's been decriminalised last year
ironic cuz where I am right now banned abortions too
I dont have a solid source on hand, but even stuff like support for drug use is highly tied to "do you think people will start having casual sex cuz of drugs"
*very big*
It's actually a big reason why people are against abortions
Yeah
Embryos
Fertilised eggs
Fetus
Unborn baby
Funny how language works
Postnatal abortions <a:ablobthinkingeyes:658678494292869151>
Because you see it on the news sometimes
Baby bones and things
Or just deaths in general
Or even stuff like stillbirths vs murder etc.
I was wondering if anyone else thought something like slapping murder charges on the mother for killing a newborn was excessive too ü§î
And... (I dont know how I was about to continue the sentence)
Also, if you consider things like post-partum depression and stuffs
And the general reasons why one might opt for an abortion in the first place
(Just mentioning it since it did feel kind of jarring when I first(?) saw/heard about it)
And the way they take out the fetus can be quite... physical, as far as I understand, depending on the methodnused
Tbh having seen(?) some (but not much tbh) pictures of aborted fetuses they look pretty human way(?) before the "usual" abortion limit

Like inviting an organisation deemed to be a hate group in the US to speak to the students (16~18) about core family value hurrbdurr

I like how my school made the news like twice because the students werent too happy with what the faculty did

GAY MARRIAGE RUINS THE
SANCTITY OF MARRIAGE

ITLL MAKE PEOPLE DIVORCE EACH OTHER
Depends on what you make of the semantic difference tho
<:EssSip:889896549117734982>
To be honest full "marriage" mightbbe harder but an equal but differently termed sort of civil union should be quite possible
They still could tbh
When one part of the constitution contradicts the other it's a very good way to start getting things changed
The Consortium head going like "People say being gay is not a choice; I don't believe that" took the cake tho
<:hehAmelia:949312108204531723>
I remember when they were like "BAN THE GAY PENGUIN BOOK" then they were like "ok put it in the adult section"
I remember my principal appealing towards the latter in front of the whole student body when it came during some sort of debate-ish session
<a:smugSuisei2:949028353267097651> <a:TS_RumiaDance:803427311180447798>
They're deeply disappointed because there's enough wriggle room
" Protect "
" Singapore "

They used to be like
"It must be an internal decision made by Singaporeans and not as a result of external influences"
"Respect the law we're a democracy"
Throw them a bone because even they know they dont have much justification left for that level (criminalising  gay sex) of gay people hate
Enshrine it as you will it'll be easier to get the ball rolling and get enough people on board to codify gay marriage in the first place anyway
I argue decriminalization of gay sex (welcome to the 21st century)
is fundamental tonpaving the way for gay marriage in the first place so I think it's by and large a step forward
you know one could say i'm being hardly ironic with that statement<:ThinkSex:726645772522618951>

It really calls home to the fact that Singapore has really changed as a nation as is still changing
For better or for worse time will tell
I'm actually quite stunned SG repealed 377A
They no like marriage being 4 everyone
So weeeird!!!!
You really can't expect to live a "normal" life in Japan or Korea if you're LGBTQIA+ but in Singapore it might be significantly easier... as long as your immediate family is supportive
I'd go as far as to say it's better than Japan or Korea even

India and racism eh
<:hehe:867048140954927115>
So like, kind of different from CCP China/Chinese peeps/people who speak Northern accents and closer to people from Hong Kong/Taiwan if anything
Although they are sizable/wealthy enough in many places to thrive on their own even without the support of the local government/people
And many others just face general disdain or racism in many forms in the region
Some of them have faced being culturally genocided (see Indonesia and forcing Chinese people to take up "Indonesian" (aka Malay or Muslim) names and customs, banning Chinese culture, etc.), others are shunned by government policies (cf. Bumiputra, which tries to justify prioritising/helping supposedly local/indigenous peoples over immigrants/Chinese, despite the fact that in many of these places the Malays etc. are immigrants which have uprooted even older indigenous cultures over time themselves)
These are typically ethnically Southern Chinese peeps (imagine Cantonese, Hokkien, Hakka, etc.), many of whom have little to no relation/share little to no connection with modern China and have basically intermingled with the local population(s) for up to centuries.
Southeast Asia had a burgeoning ethnic Chinese community since a *long* time back (think up to 1000+ years ago pre-communism/pre-everything in some places like Vietnam) which essentially began acting as middlemen between British/Dutch/Portuguese/French/American colonisers and/or owning businesses in the region. So there is considerable hate against the ethnic chinese community/communities in many countries for being somewhat to significantly wealthier/more educated, for potentially having had some bad blood with the locals/indigenous populations or for more recent waves of immigration/domination from China (think Australia and the housing market etc.)

Maybe it could be industry-dependent, which would be more in line with what we already have
Not least the cloudflare/kiwifarms stuffs
That said that means you would add a heavy layer of bureaucracy to stuffs
I would say it's even more pertinent here because handling business transactions at such a scale isn't a very open market

We can easily refer to/find instances of the former with regards to the cake/marriage incidents
It's just that there hasn't been much of a precedent has there

but humanity is well-known for its foresight /s
that too tbh
just saying /s(?) <a:MikoSusStare:948123221889278014>
which isn't likely to happen with just a nuke or two... or maybe even a few thousand

that said the existential threat of humanity as a species exist mostly in the event of a nuclear winter
what's the point otherwise? /s
that said this war might do more for world peace than 60 years of "diplomacy" ever have /s
the world needs to come together to cancel europe for starting 3 world wars /s
if the war makes it out of Europe

Talk to us
<:sad:757376841022701678>
It's a strategically important location, but whether the excessive loss of life is worth it is something that could be brought to the table methinks
People are drafted up to fight a war some of them do not want to fight
You could maybe argue if it's in the citizens' interests to continue the war
<a:fishEyes:638899625780183070>
May it pass indeed <:essexpray:755948440176820405> 
Things do just happen sometimes <:heh:782946405856837652>
<:topcute:671901208109383701>
It's what this channel is for
Whatever suits you best, I guess. They might appreciate the call tho <:BikkiWink:391790927082946560>
Than they are at you*
Realised it sounded a bit misleading <:hehe:867048140954927115>
You know like they say, you cant avoid death and taxes.
And just like taxes, when the time comes it might be more than worth your time to deal with death healthily and thoroughly.
Might really help everyone be there for each other, even if not in person
Tell them what you're getting for lunch etc.
Video call your parents from time to time or something
Well you could even just stay with her at home
Ah
<:NeneSmart:759191469625573407>
Take your sister to the funeral too!
Yeah, of course, as long as it's handled well.
I think if you want to you could still schedule to travel to your grandpa's funeral
Yeah I tear up when I think about his passing sometimes not just because of my grandpa but also because I felt really helpless about my mother's grief. <:heh:782946405856837652>
It's gotten better over the year(s), at least
<:harold:671899719940833291>
And even if they do get a bit annoyed don't blame it on them theyre probably more frustrated at the situation than you
Sounds like a plan
When my grandpa passed my mother crying at the funeral with so much sorrow really stuck with me
Might have done a number on my mental health but what can you do
It's okay to grieve for a while and I think almost everyone will tell you that
<:hehe:867048140954927115>
That sounds ncie
<:noaPotato:699427792705683508>
How you interpret "life goes on" is up to you, I guess.
It absolutely does not mean that it shouldnt affect you in anyway especially in the short term
Just that all of life doesnt come to a stop forever
Indeed
<:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
Might be a bit unfortunate, but as your therapist said, life goes on.
And it's not like the interview itself would go as well given the current state of things
Even if it does there're things that're more important right now so
<:partypoppor:951707564037525505>
And you made the right choice to talk about it given the current situation
Maybe it just isnt the right time to be bottling things up now
Also it doesnt mean you dont have control

Great idea
Dunno what they said but enough people are clowns ü§°
Sounds like a start
Anything you could do to make things easier on you?
Usually, at least
However important they may seem
Other things can come later
I would say take the time to prioritise talking with your family and grieving together
Of course
*Usually* a death in the family has got to be more important than a day of... babysitting
Is it a one-day thing?
Not sure how things work on that side if the globe, you see.
Just curious.
Have you gone for grandpa's funeral yet?
ü•≥
Vs "something came up"
I think most will be mor understanding about a death in the family
Might be better to be clearer dep. on the job
It's alright. Grieving is more important than a job interview
Ah
just reminding them of what they're doing
the first thing i did was to cut to the point
I did tho
but Ukraine isn't like being fought over by the West like Vietnam or Afghanistan, per se
not false tbh
I'd say vietnamese was more of an internal strife kind of thing, afghanistan was more... idk politically-motivated?
<a:thumbs_up:998638344323997776>
dang you should be writing Zelensky's speeches
<a:MikoDingDingDing:753447973450547220>
morale is important
it's war
propaganda isn't necessarily being used pejoratively here
16 year-olds would be drooling to write an essay analysing your statements because it'll be the easiest piece of english hw they've done in half a year
you're literally trained in high school to look out for this kind of stuff
see one loaded question after the other
like forgive me if you were trying to rile people's support up by writing propaganda but if you were trying to have a discussion then sorry you might want to be more "nuanced" in your argumentation
<a:fishEyes:638899625780183070>
their premise doesn't necessarily lead to the conclusion, so as to speak
it's just that TP's being a bit presumptuous
and it's not what I *want*, per se
nah it's more than that tbh
give them an inch and they'll take a mile or smth
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
doesn't have to be one or the other
i feel like people would agree with you on the conclusion but less on how you got there
but chill
i kid

that said Elon Musk's tweet reeks of sus <a:rockSus:909562773669834782>
yeah it kinda shows you're more angry about "the fascists" than talking about what's in the best interests of the people dealing with them
extremism goes both ways
not saying the "right" answer is always "somewhere in the middle" but try not to sound like you're making a strawman out of everything

Genocidal War Crimes: Ukraine Edition
an eye for an eye makes the world go blind <:eyeJuice2:709428531272089680>
<:AHHHHsex:888778885481791538>
pre-war status quo was still kinda warzone-ish tho <:hehe:867048140954927115>
almost like you have to weigh the consequences of different decisions
believe me even if Ukraine capitulated a conflict like this never ends <:heh:814562279249018920>
really don't want to generalise too mch
hey there I bet there's a lot of people who would *really* rather be in the comfort of their homes watching silly cat videos than being engaged in an active war
<a:AFaunaNod:1016624428177698836>
and possibly at Ukraine's expense I'd say some would welcome such a development <:hehe:867048140954927115>
with them declaring the annexation of whatever they declared the annexation of the situation's obvious changed, however
but Zelensky said no
wasn't there a point in time where they were like "hey we only want crimea (+ a wee bit more land)"
<:hehe:867048140954927115> ye
that said if the choice was between Ukraine losing (just) Crimea (hypothetically) and the entirety of their male population to war (which is very thankfully not the case), I'd go so far as to say the choice in obvious.
it's almost like someone can call out someone else for being a tad bit fallacious in their reasoning while sharing similar views on what should be done
<:based:748564944449962017>
yeah I'm not being serious about Ukraine annexing Russia
<:essexpray:755948440176820405>

<:hehe:867048140954927115>

Nah I'd love it if Ukraine could march into St. Petersburg <:KEKW:755234216249393353>
help yourself understand what we're trying to say
no?
yeah I know there are people "blaming" Zelensky 
but we're talking more about the more reasonable... reasons why people might want to not prolong the war
<:heh:782946405856837652>
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
oh no not just until Russia makes peace
until *Ukraine* can secure their national interests
i think from what we've seen it won't truly "end" even if Ukraine were to hypothetically enter negotiations now <:heh:814562279249018920>
that said Ukraine seems to be doing okay and can probs can get more out of continuing the war than "ending" it

we do a little russia-ing <a:RumiaDanceRumiaJustice:1014352343023763546>
<:clownThink:773770773495676938>
but Russia really didn't wait before deciding to take their share of the cake
The nation was essentially already split into two
I don't remember all the details off the top of my head but Ukraine definitely was not an uneventful & stable democracy
all the internal instability and the like
essentially
Russia took advantage of the events leading up to the 2014 invasion of Crimea
yeah
not saying "hurr durr people of Ukraine acutally *wnat* to be a part of RUssia" but more in the dimension of
also I think it's worth mentioning Ukraine isn't (or at least wasn't always) like some kind of completely unified entity
Might help to mention that Ukraine has had a hard time playing politics internally too
to be fair it could be mass killing of people's who're essentially KGB officials and the oligarchy people /s

funnily enough East Asia did wars like that because they didn't have them so often and the Us vs Them was on a more national level than Europe where some cities often changed hands and people didn't necessarily identify with whoever was collecting the taxes etc.

(In SG only the boy would get prosecuted even tho sex with a minor is illegal for, gasp, both genders, heh, but that's a different issue in and of itself (yes no romeo & juliet laws) <:hehe:867048140954927115> )
Imagine *only* punishing the girl for getting pregnant
And punishing a child for getting pregnant at all
<:AHHHHsex:888778885481791538>

Like you'd think people would be marginally less caustic about this but no
Like literally a third of all women or more get UTIs and yeast infections and stuffs and a good portion of them start needing meds regularly right as they hit puberty
Changed within the last 2 decades or so at best probably (I kid I have no sources)
Just that some countries do it less or dont anymore
Literally what you hear from almost every single goddang country
Funny how its literally the same across the world
And also about how getting pregnant can get you kicked out of the school

Obgyn for stuffs other than pregnancy
Or how schools deal with actual cases of teen pregnancy etc.

Like thats not even getting too stufflike students going oooo somebody saw stephanie walk out of obgyn yesterday it must be the pulls she must be sexually active (or that word girls themselves use all the time) oooo regardless of it not being their business and what they were actually there for (pills as contraceptives or for menses or meds for utis and yeast infections or the bajillion other stuffs for a brazillian other reasons) cuz kids be kids but adults pls

Different story but my friends from SG who were posted in Australia for their National Service said their sergeants told them to not wear masks near the beginning of covid because it might be seen as an admission of guilt / attract attention

The way she was taking out documentation to show she was planning to study for some Kaplan thingy

Pls
Contradicting myself a little, maybe the barrier of entry is just high enough for people to not use it as "nefariously" as whimsically
So yeah, the tech is being kept way more pristine than you'd expect it to be
It's one of the things mentioned in actual papers
~~you could easily flood the "market" with fake child porn for example~~
Or the same with image-related networks
Imagine if someone made gpt-3 but with none of the steps taken to prevent "abuse"
Since you know, the tech needs to be marketable but we see firsthand what Shem-Ha spews out even when it's state-of-the-art tech
In fact its one of the core goals...
Even stuff like gender stuffs
OpenAI literal has entire departments on different topcis in ethics
Like the actual researchers are the first to try to keep things ethical tbh
Iirc it's being kept under the lid for now... ish
<a:RumiaJustice:619735456824688650>
How long until it's super easy to fake someone's voice
Did you know theres a whole bunch more you can do with *deep learning*? <:hehe:867048140954927115>
Like it's really a piece of knowledge that's spread rather than a program or the like
Although I guess a few leaks here and there made it easier for it to catch on
Like literally anyone who wants to can look up a deep learning 101 to do something similar
Not really techbro level stuff
You could just... train a new one from scratch
And like
NovelAI was literally leaked iirc
Techbros dont have time to care about smalll fish like ai art <:hehe:867048140954927115> /s
Tbh its less techbros and more of just.... people
And less a thing you add in and more of a thing that arises
Also watermarks are more for the network itself
Techbro probs didnt have enuff tech /s
Ye
Makes it a lot easier to steal art
Yeah
It was a bit meh for real-life stuffs but people figured out for drawings you can edit in post <:pinkehehehe:941072320351588403>
Luckily with respect to copyright and stuffs (I think(?)) people managed to reach the idea that it's about the same as copying other artists' styles and calling it your own (if significantly easier to do as a result of the new tech) by themselves
<a:pensiveFast:755954448009920592>
Might change the field as we know it but ye
New tech has a tendency to do that
But it may save a lot of time
Most of which probably needs to be touched up significantly
Like imagine drawing one piece and being able to replicate the style in many images
It's like televisions and cars and horses
Anywho AI could be a major addition to artists' toolsets tho
Huh
I kid but that pretty much sums it up
<a:CeobeSora:984976229461528576>
Try to understand their society
Liking children is a given in japan
Like people do drugs in the us 
People live and let live <a:pensiveFast:755954448009920592>
<a:RumiaJustice:619735456824688650>
<a:RumiaJustice:619735456824688650>
Look at all the things pepple managed to do with Dalle-mini

Imagine if the best-performing models and weights were leaked
Which may be why AI art was the low-hanging fruit that people kinda managed to hack
Esp. for real-life stuffs
Meanwhile: Ezra Miller
