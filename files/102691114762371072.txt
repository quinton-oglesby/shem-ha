Have you ever been annoyed that you can't have your top three characters selected without being green? Have you ever been puzzled by the fact that we don't have Carol? Are you concerned by Discord's lack of horizontal hierarchy? Well, with the World of Color update, the first two problems have been solved! Still working on the last one. Check out <#448237561085952001> for the new commands.
<#357682999300718592> is now a SFW place! Risque images go in <#336297808221044736>, regardless of origin. Smutfic is still allowed in <#357682999300718592>, provided a warning is posted alongside your link.

***YEE HAW***
(Add yourself to the role using the features in <#448237561085952001> )
Alright. Before I head out into the wilderness for a week, I'd like to take the time to say how much I appreciate all of you. Even the lurkers, you help by existing! Special thanks go to <@127644949884698624>, <@456226577798135808>, <@263983345669505025>, <@246146781832806401>, <@99695384296701952>, <@284390402210136064>, <@99158582326497280>, <@138131889142628352>, <@292451539136806913>, and <@106866895076003840> in no particular order. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

I'll miss everyone while I'm gone. Have a wonderful week without me, and be ready for a ton of pictures when I get back.
She tried.
<@449062815534153748> has an announcement! Maybe.
Shirabe.exe now searches more databases! If your source is on Pixiv, Nijie, Nico Nico Seiga, Pawoo, or deviantArt, she'll find it! Probably.
After nearly killing *both* of DMJii in a horrific "accidentally deleted the wrong files" mishap, we now have a functional feed from the subreddit! All new posts will (eventually) show up in the new <#449274763815157760> channel.
I'd like to bring everyone's attention to the <#448237561085952001> channel, where we've rolled out the much requested Geah color feature! In addition, there are special interest roles available. Feel free to approach me with any questions.
<:mariaWave:409855829941157888>
It's May 25th in Japan, which can mean only one thing. Tsubasa is one year older, one year closer to retirement, one year further from her first motorcycle. To celebrate, Kirika has helped me break in to Tsubasa's private armory, and I've been busy hanging decorations and generally tidying up the place. I've unlocked the doors from the inside, so <#581494826793566236> is freely accessible to all! Just be sure to bring a present <:BasaSmug:497598144083787796>
We recently had two mass pings due to an oversight with the role system that had been in place for months at this point. We apologize for not noticing sooner, and thank all of you for not abusing this fact *at all* in the intervening time.
I've been approached by someone who will be helping to finance the bots in the meantime. Disregard the above message.
Due to severe financial hardship, the bots will be coming down soon, probably within the next day or so. I'm not able to afford the hosting at the moment, but I definitely do not intend for this to be a permanent state of affairs. I will be re-hosting them as soon as I'm able to support them.
<#448237561085952001> is back up and running at full capacity! Due to Kirichan limitations, the emoji are now at the bottom, but function exactly as they used to.
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
It feels good to be home.

I'll be getting the bots back up and running ASAP, and some of you will be happy to note that all Kiricoin balances are secure.
It's with a heavy heart that I'm announcing my resignation from staff. It's been an absolute joy to work to create this wonderful community we have, and I'm so glad for the opportunity to provide tools that make everyone's experience easier and more enjoyable. Unfortunately, recent events regarding my position on staff have made me incredibly uneasy, and I can no longer remain on the team without impacting my mental health. 

I intend to keep the bots online, and to continue working on RV and various Shirabe features. Also, I'd love to stick around as much as I can. Y'all are lovely.
Hi! I didn't forget about RV! We've finally enabled another new gacha for those of you interested in collected the topmost tier of waifus imaginable, and also Genjuro sometimes. More details in <#495354212150935572> to follow shortly.
Mornin, folks! We've noticed that our golden Hibiki was getting a little dusty, so we've decided to change things up a bit. In the spirit of the holidays, the server icon now reflects the approach of Chris-mas! What's in the box? `It is a mystery...`
We'd really like <#447132690349555712> to be for the active discussion or sharing of music, rather than the <@431656503490117632> spamfest it is currently. To that end, her music output messages have been moved to <#336298587745157120>. Now you can unmute <#447132690349555712> if you're into that sort of thing!
It's Serena's birthday! And, more importantly, it's the first character birthday since we've implemented <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> on the server! So in celebrating Serena's birthday, we're holding a special event - Serenacon 2018! We welcome all of you to <#498548497478582285>, a channel where <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> may be found lying on the floor because Maria ~~is bribing people this year~~ is happy to support the local economy! But don't despair. Even if you aren't a true Serena fan, you can still get 200 free <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> for reacting to Kirichan's message below! <:SerenaOhoho:449358389563359234>
@everyone, please say hello to our new robot overlord mechanical FIS member, SG-x00 Maria!

Kirichan likes to meme with us, and handles a lot of things behind the scenes. Shirabe watches us, eternally upset because she did not appreciate being forced to attend classes. Maria is going to be a little different. 

We're enabling Kirichan's currency system, called Kiricoins <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>. You'll be able to acquire these with a daily allowance, participation in server events, and just generally being a good person, among other things. "Oh, but Saki, what are we going to spend them on?" 

Turns out that XDU isn't a terribly good game, but the waifu PNGs are pretty great. Maria will be accepting Kiricoins as the premier currency in her gachas. You can collect all the waifu PNGs you want, set your favorite as your representative, and look up other users' favorites. Many, many more features will be coming soon. Stay tuned!

Take a look at <#495331732887699466> in our new Symphogear RV category for more information <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Some of you may remember the <#449274763815157760> channel, that short-lived, magical place where Shirabe would tell us when a post was made to the subreddit. Unfortunately, Reddit is a butt with their RSS feeds (and many other things, but that's another story) and she stopped working after, oh, a week or so.

She's back, using not-RSS! The delay from the subreddit post to appearing in the channel should be a minute or less, because this new thing is ***way*** better than the old thing.

Our DMJii robos should both be much more stable now, as well, due to some tinkering I've done recently. <:ChibiDess:391790922565812225> <:ChibiJii:391790927686926337>
Would you look at that. It's Hamster Christmas, otherwise known as the birthday of Hamster Jesus!

Let's all wish Tachibana Hibiki a nice birthday, filled with rice, and also rice.
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
Oof.

The whole "Discord is down" fiasco a few days ago broke Maria. A simple restart fixed the problem, but some folks had their Kiricoins thrown down the pit, never to be seen again. I'm offering up 400 coins to anyone who clicks the reaction on Kiri's post below as apolocoins. You have 24 hours to claim them.

The suffering of the few leads to prosperity of the many!
IT'S HALLOWEEN! `sp00ki!` To celebrate the culmination of the scariest month of the year (along with the first four Saturdays of no Symphogear <:YuiScare:442105076933459979>), you could have reacted to the message below with <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> to get a frightful bounty of 666 Kiricoins! üëª

I love October <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Symphogear RV has finally entered version 1.1! Today, I bring you a way to spend your tokens. Bear in mind that this is 1.1.0 and there will probably be bugs, so I'm standing by with apolocoins at the ready!

Proper patch notes incoming in <#495354212150935572>.
It's Hibiki's birthday, and Melua forgot to take away my announcement-posting privileges <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027> 

There's a delay on the proper celebrations, but all will be made clear eventually. In the meantime:

hap birf bik
I'm stepping down from moderation. As the server has grown, so has the requirements of a staff member. I'm not cut out to manage a server of this size, and I thank each and every one of you for giving me this wonderful opportunity. I hope I've done a good job in my tenure here. 

It should be noted that I'm not leaving, and I don't plan on doing so any time soon. This place feels like a second home, and that hasn't changed. In addition, I will be retaining a small job regarding server operations. 

The Alchemist role is being revived as a caretaker of the Autoscorers, effectively a bot consultant to the full staff members. This is the new role I will be taking. As such, I will no longer be responsible for moderation, nor will I have the ability to delete messages or kick users. I will be solely focused on management, upkeep and (rarely) improvement of our dear FIS robos.

but `I must`
It's so hard to ignore the bloop

there's a bloop but ***I WONT LOOK***

Yea
I'm not that petty <:NononPout:454088299963875349>

Pats is awfully quick to yell at me about it
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
she painted a giant target on her back with that
Rahki did say she had the most experience in spectator between matches
I feel like Shirabe probably would have killed Luci in revengancing
Shirabe is also a player, and Pats helped me out a lot with the story <:ShirabeThink:461322366010654730>
the temptation is too strong
*fucking bloop I swear* okay muting that channel
I mean, anyone who's been paying attention to my game probably knows the meme
it's *ADVANCED MAFIA*
this isn't just Mafia...
AMR vs human target is a fuckin war crime
okay hold on
`because you're trying to frame me`
I'm like 90% sure its pats now
Shirabe's character in my game uses fans.
I'm smarter than that <:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
pats, if you want to frame me you have to be a little more subtle

I am suddenly regretting my decision
thats a luci vote
lots of people say yes, and for some reason I trust them
fuckin lets do it to it
is it too late to change
since I know the person running the game, fairly high tbh
Pats/Kabuto
yea
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
you're doing alright
I'm telling y'all, pats is trying to frame me with these stupidly obvious motives
and this is semi-public knowledge
night one I checked Sag, but you're good
Pats is Mafia, I'm telling you
and yeah pats has been involved since week 1
pats has been *really* forward with "fuck saki"
<:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>
first you try to frame me, then you misgender me, how rude
*she*
pats voted me first
So nice fucking try
Except I'm the cop, and I checked you.
You "know" because you're mafia and trying to get me lynched
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
but yeah you were pushing hard
<:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>
you didn't guess, you investigated me
I got you ***GOOD*** pats

Melua's birthday is July 2nd
dess_timelua
should be 2ish hours
Well, knocked him out
We just killed a pirate lord
After pathfinder, yes
But a bots channel would be supremely handy
Desubot is a meme, Kirichan is actually useful
The other important things seem like they're already covered by Ryouko and so we can gradually move them over
So what's the biggest priority? Self-roles?
we'll cross that bridge when we come to it
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
<:mariaWave:409855829941157888>
I don't wanna
`but`
but

Sounds good, I'll delete the unnecessary placeholder roles but I'll keep Autoscorer Color Prop
or would you prefer to do it all at once
Can I go ahead and change the color/name then rq
we're also watching madoka so she might not be paying attention to discord <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
I meant the puns she had mentioned yesterday
but apparently there are `plans`
I still think autoscorer should be alchemist and bots should be autoscorer
Mind if I go ahead and change autoscorer now?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
My first choice is Kiri alt color + old Autoscorer prop tbh




I'll see how the teal looks
or, I could use the teal from her X on her geah
first is to darken Kiri's main role color
I have two other options
Hmm...
Kiri-chan's secondary tie color.


with slight modification for readability
The colors were chosen based on the primary color of their SONG tie
light mode murders my eyes


the roles are still visible on click
doesn't solve the Bikki vs Kanade issue, but is it really a problem now that I think about it
a noble snackrifice
Kanade and Bikki would be nearly the same color and Miku would mean you'd have to change the Custodian color
I thought you had mentioned something about main 6
With light and dark modes, because I totally remembered light mode exists

Color options presented for your approval <@!127644949884698624>
click link, pick server from dropdown, and click authorize
so if you're logged into discord in browser, it should be super easy
alright
danke
and am far too out of it to do anything quite yet
I just woke up
10 minutes
um can we do in like
^there's the bot add link, so whenever me and one of y'all are around tomorrow we can pull the trigger
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=431656503490117632&scope=bot
<:sadfrost:336655265816641539>
Is it a Kiri-based pun
It's a shame the mod role is Autoscorer, because that would be a better name for the bot role
I ask because Ibu is pink, and shirabe is also pink
So after I get the self-assigned roles set up, we're deprecating the other custom colors?
95% sure.
it *should* work.
When I finish here and am ready to start configuring, I'll get that done
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
up to you
Actually, I think I could generate the link and send it to you
It's required to add bots
I'm not gonna go changing the name or anything, Scout's honor
I *will* need the Manage Server permissions to add her, when we get around to it
We have two nadekobots on my social discord due to shenanigans so Kiri is the more specialized one, and the one I run
Play music, respond to a few designated phrases, some other miscellany
I'm using custom BG though, lemme check with default dark
*squints*

Also, I'm not able to post in <#336297587802112011> which would be the best place for the reaction role system. The role assignment channel is for the commands only
I don't think I have access to that channel
where is role assignment
#got something to prove
If you want to handle something specific, I don't mind, I just want to make it easy on you
I can do everything *except edit the post*
Roles: done.
Self assignments: done.
Uncolor legacy roles: not done
Change mod colors: not done
You'd need to edit the existing post in rules to reflect the new staff role names.
The things you'll have to do are... actually I think I can handle all of it on my end?
Alrighty
So, am I in charge of making the announcement post?
because they see everyone else's
having all the role assignments in one channel makes it easy on people who havent done it before
Have them in a drop-down called Bot Commands
so perhaps a channel #role-assignment would be best
games, casino, etc
we have a few channels for bot commands based on what command you're running
On my social server
So
I'd like to keep the current bot-commands as a test bed
Make a post in rules-and-info for me to add the reactions to
Change Autoscorer/Bot role names
Change Autoscorer title
Edit the post in rules-and-info to reflect new names
Steps:
So, I think we're ready for implementation.
<:RecruitSalute:440719325306028032> you're the boss for a reason, Boss
lets trial with just the three and see if people use it
do a survey or something
yeah I was thinking that too
and c) XDU
so we'd probably restrict it to special interests that either:
a) have a large number of players on the server AND has multiplayer or
b) has a fast-paced news environment that people are interested in
lolol
idfk
or are they the same
azure lane?
Kancolle and
FGO and those two ship ones
we've got to find a balance between specificity and usefulness
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
good point, but these are opt-in so idk
but for a good start
What sort of special interest roles do we want? We can add more, trivially, later
once we add them to the self-assignable list
the command for roles is "dess_iam [role name]"

etc.
Reaction for choose character, command for everything else
or mix and match.
One post for "Choose your character" and another post for "Choose your special interests"
and we can have multiple posts (up to 5) for different categories
It'd be a single post in a channel with a bunch of reactions under it
I prefer the latter
type a command, or click a reaction emoji.
We also have two (2) options for users assigning roles to themselves
I mean, it saved you a bit of work, didn't it? <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
anything above is locked, as it should be
I can only manage roles at or below autoscorer too
i think?
change icon
change name
change region
manage server is uh
Assuming they don't need any extra permissions
Already done
really glad I didn't accidentally queue the ZENBU Ichaival mix I made
after she has to mute a bitch
dess_move
and she'll join your channel
all you do is, when you join a voice channel you use "dess_q [youtube link]"
she outputs a lot of status updates
I reccommend a "Music Commands" channel under bot commands
she doesn't have access to this channel
go CAPE! in general
it's already set up
it'll be fast
CAPE!
no, next step is
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
but role bloat is real
if we do decide to do that, I can set up another reaction thing but make it exclusive
con: *role bloat*
pro: they can pick color seperately from girl
that's got pro and con
yup
subtract 1 from all of them

answer, maybe
I'm back
Quite possibly the *worst* timing
and of course my internet goes down
I think it's ready.
yeah I wanted that one at the top
(it looked weird for a moment because I was faffing around with the order of messages)
is that not sufficient
"Click on one of the reactions to get any (or all!) of your favorite girls added to your list of roles."
I set up a prune but it's on 20 seconds instead of 200 and I'm trying to find out how to remove it
probablyt
oh you need admin to run that command, can you copy/paste that real quick
let me check
there might be a way to autodelete the manual commands
Actually...
The reaction post would slowly get buried by the manual commands, it should be in <#336297587802112011>
role assignment is donezo, unless you want a more in-depth explanation
true
that pink was nice too
yellow is good because it's different but you don't sound happy about it
does Miku have a SONG uniform tie, I can't remember
I know right
Indeed I can
Still a little on the dark side

there's a dess_qn command that queues your song next
that could work
then pick out of the list
so you'd just say dess_load 1 and it'd load all the symphogear music
you can save playlists to nadekobot
what i'd do is
if we're using 1TB I'd be *very* surprised
there's also this
i'll sort it out when I get home
so that'll help in the meantime
Looks like I can get 3 months free from this 1and1 service
if we can get low-bandwidth hosting for free or under $5 I can handle that
Which is why I want to sort out hosting sooner rather than later
My internet likes to just disappear every now and then
music isn't super complex
that should be good to go
queue up another and she'll be back
when she doesn't have any more songs she leaves
the interests category was fine, i think
the voice channel shouldn't be in bot commands tho because people will probably have the commands channels minimized
I'll just post an explanation and pin it
imo
<#447132690349555712> should be for discussion and recommendations, not for DJ
Alice, I mentioned earlier but I recommend a "Music Commands" channel under bot commands
`she outputs a lot of status updates`
yeah gonna do that now
let's see if we can get a game going tonight, when our german and swede friends show up
dayum.
`I fucking love this song`
how many cards is that anyway
that'd be just a custom reaction, ezmode
like, negative priority tho
if you wanna work on that in the background it'd be awesome
The questions are customizable, so we could in theory have a symphogear trivia night
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
looking forward to trivia
it's great
and nobody's asking questions about her commands being dess_
I'm glad everyone seems to be enjoying having her around
ye ye
but that's a lot of effort
I could have another app with AHK set up that would input the command autonomously on my laptop
hmmmmm <:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
so most geah music is only when I'm around
bot owner only
but it's exclusive to me
yeah
<a:WutChris:431361817009192962>
it'll be next to impossible to find anything in bot-testing if we need to go back to it
hmm, maybe but I don't think so. I'll check the docs
so the boxes are connected to 1Gb/s port, but obviously we don't get all of that for ourselves
finally found an actual number
doesn't look like RAM or CPU, as expected, but gotta check just in case
alright gonna try another song with the monitoring active
it's technically $5 per month but I used a referral to get $10 credit. Not sure how much bandwidth is actually allocated, I'm installing some extra monitoring tools and we can try again
looks like it supports up to 1000Mb/s so that's probably not it
where/when is otakon
so it's definitely on the host's end
me and Alice both got it same time
Perfect playing, then a pause for a second, then resuming from where the pause started
It was weird stuttering Glitch
I just ate but hardly anything
same
alright, i'm still doing looking
gonna put that song on repeat while I research
might very well be RAM, it's only got 1GB but it's also linux so <:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
but see I'm not sure if it's running out of RAM, CPU or bandwidth
very high quality. but it's cutting out more than I'd like
see when it's not cutting out it's great
so trying a few different things is ez mode
alright well now I know exactly how to set her up on linux remotely
like that
most of the time it's wonderful but there are stutters that I've heard
oh she isnt here rip
dess_vol 50
like that, just happened for me
so let me know if it cuts out for a second or 2
and I'm also getting a few stutters but that might be my internet. Wanna help me test?
I'm not sure, let me check
Runs like a ***dream***
She's hosted.
damn I feel good
step 2 donezo
now step 2: improvement
alright thats step 1: parity
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
HAHAHAHA
haha
ha
time for experiment
alright, back home
50%
maybe
I think I found the files I need to copy
I'm still out of the house so I can't action this quite yet but
I'll do more research after dinner
My problem now is figuring out what needs to be copied from a Windows installation to a Linux installation, once that's done we're good on a hosted bot
Oh, I can get 2 months free on that last service because of the referral nadeko has
is it truly behind the scenes
aren't I a part of the `Secret Symphogear Council` now
done
turns out someone wants to grab dinner with me but not for a bit so I can check it out now
Alright, I'll check out that free option then
I *really* like being useful <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I'll do my best to get Kirichan hosted by tomorrow
yeah sure
it's a `secret`
also bot-testing doesn't even show up for most users
but your decision to have everyone else be muted is a very good one
this is a trial, I'll assess the benefits over the next day or so
awesome.
drag the bitrate slider over
channel settings (the gear when you hover over it)
at 96
I'm testing on my personal server and there's a noticeable drop in "fuzzyness" in quiet parts
Nobody talks in that channel but her, so the impact on mobile users and slow connections should be minimal
Alice, can we try increasing the bitrate for DJ Kirichan
just checked
also, a grand total of 1 person has the overwatch role
that sounds wonderful
100% OJ is a game?
what on earth is that
<:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
try queuing again?
weird
she's still online
<@431656503490117632>
balls
an hour away from home about to start a hike
I'm like
what're you gonna use the color squares for <@456226577798135808>
that's a good idea
nadeko has built in functionality for RSS feeds so the subreddit poster should be trivial
I can't promise it'll be useful, but I can do that much
Oh, that's something I could do
Not everything we post is from pixiv, and googles reverse image search is mediocre at best
I'm not sure how good it would be, even if I found a bot that did that already
Absolutely no guarantees on that. It'd probably involve another bot that'll check for image embeds and search saucenao
and like, $15 a month is literally one less chipotle I get to go to
I hereby release you of any financial liability regarding any expense incurred running Kirichan, a Nadekobot‚Ñ¢ installation.
and I use this bot for my other server too, it's something I've been meaning to look into for a few months now
It's free for a few weeks at least
if I come into dire straits, that is
Alright. It's $15 a month, I don't mind paying, but I reserve the right for it to be the first thing I cut out of my budget
*crosses fingers 18 times*
gonna try a 2-core option and see if that helps
It might be related to single-threaded systems
huh.
WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN
hmmm.....
this is so puzzling
nope
crosses fingers
yeah, it's reversable so might as well
I'll try expanding to 2gb and see if that helps
According to a few forum threads, certain things Nadeko does use specific bursts of memory that wouldn't be spotted by these memory tools
this is still a better solution than before because it means I can turn my computer off at night, but I want to figure out why this is happening
I didn't want to upload a flac to test because my upload is *ass*
Nah, mp3.
is it the discord channel bitrate?
Memory 44%, CPU 12%
outbound only peaked at ~800Kb/s so I *doubt* it's bandwidth. I'll check the settings more thoroughly on nadeko
same issues, so it doesn't appear to be an inbound thing
So I tried a file straight from the server the bot is on, as well as youtube
"Based on my experience, speeds are very consistent on all sizes, though they also depend on workload across the board. Since ports are shared and not physically dedicated, there's not a base speed guarantee. For a more guaranteed speed, you'd honestly need a dedicated port, though that's not something we're currently able to offer."

can she not post in this channel
Kiri why
headpat
EASIER
MUCH
SO
WHICH MAKES THIS
I've discovered the ***SAUCENAO API PAGE***
for instance
each step forward is a really good feeling
but now I've got her pulling the attachment URL straight from the message
this is turning into "Saki liveblogs bot creation"

because DMJii is my life and I'm weak
Priority is for the *actual functionality* but I'll try to get some interaction between the two as rare little easter eggs at some point
Yup
functional bot that can filter by channel
Step 1 done

so that's good
desubot is python
and I'm gucci
all I need is a way to search saucenao via a program
so basically
I completely forgot about thumnails
See, this is why you're the boss
Anything else?
<:RecruitSalute:440719325306028032>
Alright, so my official spec requirements are:

A) searches saucenao
B) If no results, no output
C) the two art channels only
i've never had anything close to reasonable with anime pictures in google reverse
Google search is... it exists?
What other options are there for finding images?
step b is the complicated bit that I'm probably going to have to look up JSON or something for
The pipeline I'm thinking of is

a) check filename for meaningful information
a.2) if successful, find file on pixiv/whatever
b) check saucenao 
c) post link
Oh, excellent
Otherwise I'd be running a function on *every message on the server* and that's unoptimal
Would you mind if I only checked messages in <#336297674707828747> and <#336297808221044736>
For sourcebot, I think I can work with the skeleton I made for desubot
and is unimportant *at the moment*
with problems I don't have solutions for
It's a complicated thing
Yeah, I dislike the "just gamble and hope" thing that nadekobot does on its own
>5 Igalimas on DMJii duet finally happening this episode
>100 Airgelams on Elf9 getting a headpat
Honestly I wouldn't mind manually bookkeeping that.
oh my god, betting on events in S5 tho
And at that point you have to ask "at what point is this no longer worth it"
The random spawns would be disabled because that gets annoying, and also probably most of the straight "gambling for the sake of gambling" ones
Yeah I'm really on the fence about the waifu auction thing because that'll either be unused or a battlefield
<@127644949884698624> I'd like to enable Kirichan's games module soonish, stuff like connect 4, trivia and hangman. I was also thinking we could enable the currency, and do events every now and then with little prizes of currency, but that's still on the drawing board
Kiri would be exporting to a channel in the server iirc. So we'd have a #logs channel just for her
Hmm... unless they're the same format, probably not?
And I'd want to double check the logs Kiri keeps too
<:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
Kiri can also do that
Kiri can do that too iirc
so we stay at 2 bots
I mean, we can roll greetings into Kirichan *super* trivially, and unless Ryouko does anything else, she can be deprecated
Now I'm generating an API call!

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Just so you're aware of the limits
<:RecruitSalute:440719325306028032>
yeah i'm only searching on direct attachments
troo
that seems like it *might* be a problem *maybe* if we're *super* active
with a not-paid saucenao api account, I can request 300 searches in a 24-hour period
also
I still have my Kiel infinite button
i played up until post-jubilee and then took a break until PoF
yeah, that was pretty lame
I love the metas
wanna play through HoT some time?
(ls3, anyway)
and even then, only if you want *ascended* condi *rightside*
s not necessary unless you want condi gear
that'
She's always looking for new friends
This is my mesmer, feat. Astralaria

you want pof?
I've used it exactly once before, for a GW2 item search tool
I need to figure out how JSON works
I was right though
this api is basic, but extremely useful
<:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
Oh were they locked in just this channel
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
I can't tikipraise
did you take away my external emoji privs
nice bracket
So easy.

side note
maybe she can't post embeds here
her regular responses are embeds
chris doesn't dess
????????????????????????????????????????????
<@431656503490117632>
I was looking at API doc
beep
</joke>
oh, because she's on a mission she's not in the submarine, duh
she's still working elsewhere
simulated
üêü
It's a nice distraction from this wall of code
I'm more of a land beast guy but I enjoy shrimp and lobster
I have no idea what fish live where
she's not going anywhere
I've told Kiri we're getting a guest soon and she's a little excited
or something
or some massive file corruption
a massive issue getting it working on linux
I'm expecting there to be, like
not gonna lie, this is going *way* too smoothly
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Do you have a specific format you want the output in, or do I get freedom with this?
Fancy.
name ***and*** URL.

I may have gotten a little distracted but I'm back on track now, reading up on JSON now.
I'll try and figure out if there's a way to save to disk. If not, that's fine
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
all of the images are suddenly not working
rekt
I just see box, for all of Kiri's commands
is that loading for you
CAPE!
okay uh
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369> <:TikiPraise:378689957235130369> <:TikiPraise:378689957235130369> <:TikiPraise:378689957235130369> <:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Very Bad‚Ñ¢
is bad
that
oh no privacy
do it
they don't even look at each other
yeah but
You should try Girls Frontline if you haven't already. Also, if your psuedonym isn't Min Lanuel I'm gonna riot
excellent
so we're not both gone at the same time
I'm gonna be gone the first week of June hiking in San Francisco
That reminds me
what's your meal provider?
not that I'm expecting a crash, but this is why you test things
if something crashes on just pixiv, it's easier to know why
think of it like a beta test
Give Shirabe a day or two with just pixiv
I knew that little server was a good investment
getting python installed on the server was stupid easy too
I'd be stupid to not
lots of free resources of all types
yup

I'm gonna be watching this console like a ***hawk*** for any crashes though
New stuff is always good to add to the repertoire
I learned JSON *and* how to send a web request!
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I'm so ***happy***
but priority was getting core functions out the door
It's do-able, definitely
but the results for each site are a little different so to output the artist name I'd need to change the result string
That's exactly the plan
Soo, one at a time
But each source requires unique handling
I can run a mask on the databases to filter
Yes, that's definitely a thing.
I have something planned for introductions, announcements is all you
key in, ready to turn.
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=449062815534153748&scope=bot
aight, ping whenever
if you're ready I can get another add link inna sec
wise words as always, girl
I hope they like her <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
first from-scratch project for public use that isn't a meme
oh I'm so excited
she's ready
but yeah
I figured it was something like that
hi Ryouko (?)
`that's a secret so far, feel free to use if appropriate`
send help
SCREAMING INTERNALLY

is she asleep, she better not be asleep I swear to god
<@!127644949884698624> `edited out to avoid accidents, Shirabe.exe's join link was here`
PLEASE tell me before you click, I have a plan for deployment
Shirabe.exe is ready for deployment. She's fully hosted.
that was spooked
we're back baby
lewd
that was much faster
CAPE!
yup, there's the last cape
*dusts off hands*
seems like a discord problem then
after forever
just
that loaded

CAPE!
<@431656503490117632>
<@431656503490117632>
OKAY
they're
it's
what
I ran Kiri off home PC to check and they still aint
okay it's not a us issue.
I'll restart the whole shebang
I *did* install some python stuff on Kirichan's machine...
Shirabe.exe is hosted on my home PC right now
buh
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
your idea, my execution
Like I said
But at the same time, we want activity, and demanding manual source for everything would cut that back a *lot*
Exactly.
I was prepared
Yeah, when we get a karaoke solution I'll add the role
Take your time, Ryouko's logs are fine in the meantime
Yeah I'd rather not reinvent the wheel if the functionality already exists
damn, you log reactions?
What sort of stuff do you log?
Could I have a look at Ryouko's code? I'd like to merge it with Shirabe and I wouldn't even know where to start for logging. Shirabe's also pydiscord so it should be straightforward
files would be stored on there instead which I already have access to
I could run Ryouko off the same host as Kiri and Shirabe
Or.
web page would be easier on Alice but if you wanna just hook me up with SCP access that works too.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
some kind of web page we can access, or even something I could connect to with winSCP
I think that was more a general question rather than a "right now"
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
I'd be making a request to the pixiv servers, and I'd have to do all kinds of error checking on that that I just honestly didn't want to bother with
"Hey, this bot is neat, where'd the name come from?"
"Something about singing lesbians."
Maybe that's how I'll spread Symphogear
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
She's my *baby* and hopefully I'll be able to add stuff to Shirabe that Kirichan can't do, like what I don't know but I wrote her myself so the ***sky's the limit***
but I was still worried
My tests were all fine, every edge case I could think of
I'm so glad she's working.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
if that's alright
I wanna work on some fun stuff for the next couple days
that being said
yeah, that should be ez mode to set up
Which is also in-scope for Kirichan!
<:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
Alright, that's in-scope for Kirichan if I'm understanding the docs properly.
That's just my suggestion, and you're the boss
And by we, I mean I can take care of it when the time comes
I know, I'm suggesting we beef it up a notch
Kirichan has a slowmode feature for that kind of thing
So that's definitely possible. However, people already have role tooltips that are going nuts and we can do the same thing with a time-out role instead.
I hope we don't have to use those but people be crazy
There's kick, ban, and soft-ban features as well, with options to DM the user with reasons
"nice" as far as a "feel bad about it" thing goes
but the name and color is nice so
remove a few more perms
it'll have to be turned up
Yeah I know
We can repurpose the restricted role as the "You've been naughty, Kirichan gave this role to you automatically you fuck"
Alice you need to stop
It's whataboutism, and it's frankly disappointing.
Yeah, this isn't a debate, it's petulance.
As a more general thing, definitely not applicable here.
However, if someone wants to have a rational, calm discussion about a rule, they shouldn't feel unable to do so.
Agreed, in this case.
My avatar is surprisingly appropriate though.
Most of the nonsense is off-server, you're right in that a ban is probably unwise.
And besides, ultimatums are a bad look on *anyone*
This is not useful insight.
However.
It's still worth it to discuss rules. We aren't dictators, and maybe they have useful insight.
Ban, announcement to get ahead of rumors.
Ugh.
God okay if he stopped after the first page and said sorry won't happen again it would have been reasonable
okay, feeling less lenient
Like, I'm willing to give them another pass if they don't kick up a fuss about it, just because it was hiero. Maybe they thought it was a no rules zone or something
`Prepare for shitstorm`
how many times does he need to be told this
Yeah, I know
`not latest post any more but whatevs`
isn't ruki a repeat offender
<@!127644949884698624> need a Boss ruling on latest post in heiro
That's an idea.
let staff and bots only talk
<@!127644949884698624> Can I get a bots only channel in Symphogear called "Subreddit Feed" or something similar
gimme twenty minutes R
I don't actually mind
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
<:ShirabeJii:237687217437278208>
`you keep saying "we"`
Oh, that, yeah.
I literally don't see one
where's the valid point
wait
but I didn't care enough to keep arguing
which I don't even understand what their point is

followed by

did anything bad happen because of that or
so uh
CAPE!
panic over
<@127644949884698624> she's back
I downloaded a fucking SSH shell app on my phone
I was so worried
thank you
oh god
TALK TO ME GIRL <@431656503490117632>
still running?
okay she's
SHE'S THE ONE THATS SUPPOSED TO NOT
OH GOD X2 COMBO
WHICH ONE
OH GOD
It's a good feeling.
Being the driving force behind all these things that people seem to really be enjoying is a giant "fuck you" to my depression
I'm really thankful for the opportunity to help out so much
I love getting messages in <#336299268107403274> because it means people care about what's going on <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Oh is that why the embeds were acting up
Oh lord what is it this time
incredibly dense is an improvement over outright inflammatory
you missed Rukia being `incredibly dense`
I'm parked at taco bell eating before my first appt
*screams quietly*
I'M DRIVING THOUGH
Seems fairly civil at the moment
If I'm not actively tutoring I'll keep an eye out too
Bots are so much easier to deal with than people.
and I squished the Shirabe.exe bug that had her frozen
Kirichan seems hella stable though
Alright I'm going to be working from 3-4 and then again from... later, so if anything happens to the bots I'm out of the house
he's had enough chances
No questions asked
I'd rather talk about fun stuff over silence personally
TL note: keikaku means plan
I'm checking out of this convo, it got so fucking derailed
Of course.
let him yell into the void
Just leave it be
It's a noble goal, but...
I've got plans to watch some more AXZ with my friend after work, and after last night's big Issue I'd like to take a day to chill and give DMJii a break if that's okay
I was driving to my next client's place, sorry
Good emphasis on the fact that they're seperate from regular spoiler rules
Looks good <:GenjurouThumbsUp:267393750349643776>
I love unanimous decisions
That's a good argument, I'd have to agree
conundrum.
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
It's directly related to symphogear specifically, but it's also closely tied to the server.
Thanks for the catch
Ah rip
After making sure nothing was hinky
I didn't, I just enabled read and disabled write for everyone
she was sending messages last night just fine
I ended up having to learn a new way of dealing with programs on linux, but it ended up working better than the first one
I'm really glad we decided on wiping the subreddit feed channel, you would have seen my full descent into madness
it's tiny miku, wonder why they left + rejoined
<#368973801561653253> <#389113078450749440> that was weird
I didn't stop liking it, I think I broke my rss feed reader and stopped getting ping'd
two years ago
I was caught up like
<:wut:235243292965470208>
as do
http://www.69.bingo
and
http://www.dong.zone
http://www.dildo.pizza goes to QC
apparently.
huh.
ain't no judgements here
gotta get it off your chest, get it off your chest
and venting is fine
Speculation can be interesting though
Yeah, for me it's a "oh, that sucks. glad he's not in pain any more."
People who hated him suddenly mourning is a little weird, yeah.
To answer your question, you don't need to be sad about anyone, and he's the reason I got into online gaming in the first place. I'm not busted up about it, but it sucks is all
I never heard about this but I live under a rock with most things
Did he?
... Might be a while.
And now we wait for someone to make a post to the subreddit
There should be a way to let me manage just that one channel's webhooks in the channel perms
I need a webhook on the <#449274763815157760> channel
<@!127644949884698624> I think I have a solution to the reddit feed
that's a win in my book
the XDU ping means everyone who signed up to care will get it
(i sneaked a bikki peaky)
iirc
something about BOM apparently
tsubasa_sweat_wiping_brow.png
I'll check the logs when I get back
okay good
the rest are do-able
boorus are a no-go, I ain't fuckin with that
pixiv and Nijie I know, not sure if the rest of the green ones are worth
which sites do we wanna search
https://saucenao.com/status.html
you heard me
I don't work tomorrow so if I'm not <#407060923078017026> TitS or working on session 1 I'll get additional features on Shirabe.exe
She did anyway
I told Elise she didn't have to redact it
That was never in question
Oh definitely
personally though I wouldn't want to be spoiled just knowing what they look like even, and she's the same way
yeah exactly
not like he gets mentioned often
yeah just cos we don't enforce character spoilers so I was playing it hella safe
Adam
<:KiriCheer:442974585529434113>
she is Shaped Like a Friend‚Ñ¢
can I work in the engine room with nemui at least
CAPE!
I have only a passing familiarity with ship ranks
oh true
oh, re: the first mate comment, I was referring to specifically while R was acting captain
*concern*
actually having 4 arms, that is
and also complicated
that sounds fun
with vagina being an adjective
okay i'd say vagina mouths
yes
uh
are you arachnophobic
so that's good
but you're back and you're still sane probably
i do not consent
yeah honestly i'm a lil worried
you aight?
*I used that word* ***before*** *it was a meme goddammit*
yeah, like that
too many boops
Kiri posts a lot of updates to her playlist
oh yeah, I'd like to keep that channel muted.
it's whatinhellisthat.png
oh yeah I've got that too but I can't imagine why I would need it in heiroglyps
troo
that probably would count
I've got a Dead!Tikki reaction image
I honestly can't remember my stance originally but on rethinking it I do agree with you there
if someone else made a joke, sure it stays but if it was me I'd probably delete
oh yeah definitely not a spoiler by the rules but I still feel bad when it's me
I hold myself to higher spoiler standards than written
yeah it's usually like a topdad joke in general for me
no matter the meme
but yeah, there's always like 4 different relevant channels for memes
I've let a few things slip on accident but delete them as soon as I notice
I don't think I've had to invoke it *yet*. In a spoiler discussion I joked about "consulting the handbook" and just read Rule 4 word for word <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
People deserve to feel appreciated <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I haven't felt the need to walk on eggshells or anything close, and I just wanted to express that
On a (kind of) related note, I appreciate how I don't think you've ever said anything remotely approaching "well I'm the boss so you're wrong" in any sort of discussion regarding rules or enforcement between mods, at least as long as I've been around (which isn't long, but still).
Stupid moral dilemmas.
Yeah.
Scout's honor <:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
Thanks for sharing, and it definitely absolutely won't leave this room
explains a *lot.*
that
I ain't too full of pride to admit I was wrong
yeah like in retrospect that was definitely the correct decision, and you're almost certainly right about Rukia
which is maybe a good thing?
no fucking consistency whatsoever
I am completely unable to define myself as either optimistic or pessimistic because depending on scale and context my outlook changes
specifically the "multiple people are telling you you're being stupid and you continue" brand of dumbassery
I guess I (and it seems like R as well) have a low threshold for dumbassery
"Never attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity."
but yes, good call
I'd also like to point out that Rukia hasn't said a goddamn word <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
use your best judgement, and it'll be fine
That's actually a good counterpoint
Yes you're allowed to comment but try to not stir anything up
I've been watching that chat ever since I saw the title of the video
no manage messages here, which isn't a huge deal
not in here
can you pin that for me r q
if they do, I'll do that last
Pixiv, Nijie, Niconico, pawoo, deviantart
like 10 minutes
work on something else for a bit
I'm so bad at starting
I know that feel
I'm just unsure how to post them
Oh I know how to format them
you're fucking welcome
I did that from mobile by the way, R
Shirabe.exe is gonna get a few when I figure out how the fuck they work
embeds are nuts
its a header image
basa can't aim
CAPE!
upload to imgur, give me link
oh damn u right
CAPE!
what's the difference between that and
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
With Shirabe.exe I can have a channel blacklist so certain commands can't be used in spoiler channels
I just realized something
Yes. I will do this.
that's so extra but her sourcing is basically done
Oh my god I do have all those emoji
Also, added in functionality for call-and-response, ***including*** a random response picker, which Kirichan *cannot* do.
Alright. Shirabe.exe sourcing updated.
that's the bitmask for those particular indices, if anyone was curious
51539609888
fuckin bitmasks
depends on how hard I go
might not be finished tonight, might be
I'm adding the additional handling, and also functionality for call-and-responses like Kirichan for when we want to add some link-posting
Shirabe.exe runs off of a shitty config.txt so I'm finally upgrading her to a fancy config.json
hey guess what
I know, I was being sarcastic
have you missed the opportunity
nah, we can definitely avoid spoilers in a post-GX symphogear campaign
skype was more a blip than anything
oh yeah, I haven't heard that sound in forever
dess_.. test
dess_..
dess_. test This is a test quote
oh, no defaults then
dess_liqu
I haven't added any but I'm sure there are defaults, sec
oh uh
<:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
prep work for tomorrow <@456226577798135808>

her prefix is jii_, naturally
Shirabe is getting smarter <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
Holla, just added a function to reload the config without having to restart the entire bot
the matter is settled
One dess if you like Tk, <@431656503490117632>
just pointing out something to be aware of
Yeah I don't think it's necessarily a problem
I'm actually pronouncing it tee kay myself even though I know it's not, force of habit
Tk is my personal (non-Saki) favorite
`oh my god setting up config.json was one of my best decisions ever`
I know how it be
I still have trouble typing the name of one of mine
scars man
ah okay
many layers
Silver -> Ag
or is that a Sonic thing, that sounds vaguely familiar
Could go a couple layers deep and name them Silver
I've found that using external choosing options usually works, because either you don't really care or when you get a result your first thought is "oh damn I wish it was X"
<@431656503490117632>
Kirichan knows who the boss is though it seems
Strife makes them sound like a FFVII wannabe
dess_choose Saki;Tk;Haven;Aleph;Aleks
What's the shortlist
Mostly, how to define a function call straight from the config.json
Time to work on Shirabe a bit, I've got a few ideas I have no idea how to implement
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
o
I never added twitter features
which I'm not promising, but it seems *very* interesting
if I did this
I'd probably set a chance *and* some kind of cooldown timer
it's either spammy or never happens
mmm I don't like randomly responding
Oh hmm that'd be interesting
I was just gonna add a "reload config" command real quick
Autosourcing is in a solid place and she has call-response built into the config now
you could help me come up with stuff for Shirabe to do
well
I saw a control-f for "football linebacker" and nearly lost it in line at REI
which is basically exactly what Alice did there
baby steps.
<:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
<:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
Because the swearing at people is a really bad look on anyone
Do you mind if I point out you getting... "extra" in here or DMs if I notice it? Or should I just let you get it out of your system
I've also noticed that, yeah
mostly, anyway
Alice can stop the damage from happening in the first place
My specialty is mostly damage control
Honestly, it's super impressive
Oh believe me, I've noticed Alice can handle an argument.
Oh, yeah I getcha.
Unless they absolutely truly are unworthy of respect, of course
I still stand by my `vent in private, be respectful in public` statement though
Thanks for the history lesson though, explains a bit
Hence your `shoddy moderation` comment.
jeez
huh, I've been wondering who soiguessthisisit was
Something about differences in opinion regarding moderation
I have a basic idea of why the seperation happened
Bitch about it here, or DM me, but keep it out of public places
Yeah, i feel you.
A lot.
It helps me.
So maybe try saying "oh my got X person is so fucking stupid" in private and try to remain civil in public
Something I've noticed is that you tend to get hostile rather quickly when people disagree with something you feel is obvious, and then the aforementioned defensiveness pops up and it gets messy
I'd also like to point out explicitly that Alice and I are not trying to make you feel bad, or gang up on you or anything. We're just trying to help you be more effective in the future
Get more flies with honey, etc
I mean, I don't hardly participate over there. However, if you want something, at least *pretend* to respect the person with the power to do it
at best, they're going to respect you less, and at worst they're going to start getting defensive like they did
saying "fuck you" to the person you're talking to is never going to get them on your side
but you went about saying it in a suboptimal manner
I'll preface this by saying I agree with the spirit of what you were saying
would you mind a bit of constructive criticism
Self-control is at an all time high for me right now, this is unusual
Guh I have a few things I want to say but I also don't want to get rolled up in this discussion that I honestly don't belong in
on reddit
It autoposted a formatted source comment in response to my pixiv link
Woah, r/Pixiv has a new bot it seems
okay I've had it with not being able to iterate over generators, time for food and then games. I'll get back go that later
dess_liqu
dess_qdel 1
so it's [prefix].. [quote name]
It was a Good Dinner‚Ñ¢
Aight, dinner has been gotten
specifically, getting Shirabe to shitpost at people
Hell, the call and response module I added to Shirabe is mostly gonna be used for shitposting
shitposts are always fun
she probably doesn't, so either you or DL
i mean, if she's got any intelligence then herself.
Hm?
now to write to a datetime'd file and read them into a markov
finally got the ability to write logs to a file on command
okay well
sounds like you're perfect for the job
again, negative experience
Oh, that's interesting
what does the GM add
Oh, really?
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
oh man a flowchart would be heaven
bonus for bot feature is that people can throw together PUGs whenever they want
So that's decidedly in the "is definitely an option" camp
Custom made and everything
I mean, we already have Shirabe
but if you give me a spec sheet like I had for Shirabe's sauce feature, you bet your sweet bippy I can get it done
negative experience with mafia
I have like
Oh, color me interested
I put some tender love and care into my DMJii bots
Like **cavemen**
they have their mods *manually assign roles*
Kirichan is already way better than their Elfnein
Are you why their bot has a cape command
while they're executing their leadership capacity, at least
I ***haaaate*** unprofessionalism from leadership
See, this is something we can bitch about *together*
they don't wanna *work*
well, there is. That's *effort*
and I have a really hacky, inefficient way of parsing it into a dictionary
because what happens is I get all the messages from discord, separated by newlines
honestly biggest priority is a schema for handling the source material
I like this github markov but
I probably won't be able to, but if it's close enough to where I wanna camp then maaaaybe
oh god
I'll make us some mini snowmen
which there may actually be
if there's snow up in Bishop
lets try to make a cult of snowmen
`...`
oh that sounds crazy
bluh
that was just
I definitely wouldn't call that fun though
I'm not sure what you're trying to imply
I'll mess around more after my trip, probably
she plugged 100% OJ.
that I didn't find in testing
random-ass bugs
fuckin
Definitely
one mo
Aight let me figure out this bug I just discovered
should I add to list?
she's not enabled in announcements
where should I ping her first?
etc
symphogear ping will result in symphogear history
so the bot-testing ping I did pulled from bot-testing history
Oh, her responses are based on the channel you ping her in too
it's going off of "did she get pinged"
again, it's not gonna be random trigger until I enable that
we had very similar ideas
yee
fancontent, roger that

No automatic trigger yet, only works when you ping her

what channels do we want this enabled on?
markov is functional
***ARTICLE CONTENT TOO LONG FOR YOU!***

No, didn't you read, they're giving her a ***warning*** <:BikiShock:447891354278821888>
Just noticed that line, wow she's still leadership
>We will revoke her staff status **should we continue to have issues with her behavior.**
It reads like one of those "we're sorry it got this bad, we're gonna tell people not to and hope it doesn't happen again" PR posts
But I agree with the sentiment, at least
I feel like it's a little unfair to complain about them being amateur and unprofessional earlier, and now complaining that they're being too professional

sparkles XDU "postmortem" is really interesting
however minor the function is
I forgot that one was part of legacy because it actually has a function
<:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
nope, still wilco
I wonder if the Navy uses a different "will comply" shorthand <:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
wilco, Boss
<:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
But will keep an eye on
Not everyone on 4chan is a sociopath
I want to help somehow but idk how
I was basically him back in high school
their best friend sounds... interesting to be around too
Yeah I feel really bad for wfc
smol expansion followed by big expansion
Alice filled me in
Drive over five hours on featureless desert roads after not sleeping the night before
I have a new "stupidest thing I've ever done"
i know, right? well done on that
CAPE!
got it
Cape Lake
okay
Lake R
just like
R, you're gonna get a lake too
last night in a bed for a week, I'm gonna *enjoy this*
I forgot my spoon once and had to whittle a stick
with a spoon this time
Alright well I'm all packed up
it'll probably be around 3-5pm PDT ish depending on how much time I spend in town
aight cool, I didn't want to be presumptuous about it
would it be inappropriate to make an <#336300750248476693> tomorrow about how I'll miss everyone while I'm on trail?
probably
I'm hella good with topo maps so I definitely won't get lost
There are bears but they aren't grizzlies so I should be aight
plan on not doing that
week long wilderness trips are srs business
when I get back from work I need to:
```
A) Double check my food
B) Check map for possible campsites
C) Post map for people to call the ranger station if I ain't back on time
D) Pack my stuff in bag
```
oh jesus this is great
KERNEL PANIC
faded away
you just trailed off into nothingness
"not being able to use slurs" being a reason for not joining a community strikes me as something a terrible person would say
because it actually makes sense to use the everyone ping but also I wanted to use that command
I wanted to use that here
at everyone?
yea go for it
yeah solo or someone said "pin that" so I did, was supposed to be for only a couple hours
i think i was asked to, and was going to unpin but forgot
I've only seen G twice <:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
I dunno about watching it multiple times then
How long is it?
That sounds really fun
?
No, but I feel like I want to now. What's the premise
And I'm personally okay with the whole "each episode is a puzzle piece" format too, I enjoy speculation as it progresses.
Homura is my second favorite after Mami, so that's definitely a big part of why I love Rebellion.
Madoka is definitely a thing, and it was core to forming my taste in anime, and it's got most everything I like in a show, so I really enjoy it.
I like it when people give different opinions intelligently
I did really enjoy that conversation, for the record
but regardless yeah
It was Dragon iirc, not solo?
it's just twice in the last two days so I felt like I should mention it is all
keep an eye on it too, but like I said, not super common
but something I've noticed, and I'll keep trying to head it off when I see it happening next
it's not hugely common
When there's a discussion and it's not being echo chambery I've noticed people like to try to shut it down
I'm doin my best but people like to shut stuff down <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I'm gonna have to lean harder on the "different opinions about things are okay" angle
I should try that next time, it has a mobile app
that actually does
Then mahjong with dragon probably
I'm probably gonna use one of my bath bombs after I get home from the pub
We'd have to sort out the logistics though
Oh yeah, that's an idea
which is better than nothing
it's a when, you gotta have faith
>if
I'll work on ideas
are we gonna do anything for 1k?
I can action that tomorrow if <@127644949884698624> thinks it's wurf
I could probably put that together fairly easily
jii_userLookup @Someone
jii_userLog @Someone Gave a warning for t-word
Should I make a module for Shirabe.exe like
the lunch meeting went pretty well though
been a busy day <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
I'm out for a bit again
I can get it when I get home
don't change anything
Oh damn
Green is Good
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
would there be any issues with me keeping this green though, I'm very fond of the color
didn't know he got banned from valk
I've thought something was off about him
Oh jeez did he really
If it comes up that we need to, we can sort it out then
Iirc
Kirichan can do temp bans
Uh
issue arose, and settled it seems
awake from nap
imma take a nap
wow, sleepy just hit me like a ton of bricks
Ah okay, makes sense
I love that one <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
or if you do send me the OG first so I can add it to my personal server
`DONT REMOVE` <:KanadeSmile:341463635492601856>
What emote are you removing, and what are you replacing it with
half an hour
I'll check on my personal server when I get home
Uuuuuh I dunno
Yeah I guess "terrible" is a bit of a strong word
yea
remove 3 twice
removes the 10th entry
dess_rp 10
that lists current restrictions
dess_lp
so order does indeed matter
it's disabled in testing
that worked
boom
one mo'
dess_8ball memes?
again
now enable on channel
dess_8ball memes?
verbose doesn't work for some reason <:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
it's dess_chnlcmd
oh it's a different command for channel
enable dess_8ball for this channel, ***then*** disable for server
can we run some tests?
True.
I don't think that's necessary given that the only people who can use it know what they're doing
You can restrict to channels too but
I'm not quite sure
disable for server then enable for roles
the order you do it might be important
```
dess_warnclear @Someone [optional number here]
```
```
dess_warnlog @someone
```
```
dess_warn @someone Reason here
```
so I don't need to add anything to shirabe
Oh hey, they implemented a warnlog too
and do again for other 2 roles
that should work
dess_rolecmd "dess_ban" enable Alchemist
dess_sc "dess_ban" disable
X is days, Y is h, both are optional
its: 
```
dess_ban XdYh @Someone The reason goes here
```
Sounds good. Let me pull up the docs on the procedure
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
because lower
I can't click it
if you click the custom color it'll show
Alchemist is #a6ca8f
<:GarieSmile:432431646717902849>
R got an announcement when *he* was inducted into the Illuminati
<:NononPout:454088299963875349>
Shame that we need external bots for this, and it isn't *built into Discord*
and nobody else can
yup
she was probably writing to database, you were lightning mcqueen
i think too fast
that would have worked
if you had done 11
whitelisting roles AND channels is a no-go
it just adds an enable
it doesn't whitelist
yeah
now you try
dess_8ball memes?
but just to be sure
I expect this to not work
then enable it for <#447995991438786564>
Enable it for illuminati
remove 12
you gonna move it down, yeah?
I want another test
remove 9, but not 8
hmm
list
floof and gay
just
none of this suffering that Solo and Sparkle put out
this is the kind of fic I like
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I know nothing about it
it'll be a lot of compromise
but our interests don't overlap that much, you like the hibimiku and I like the DMJii
Lily and Vi inspired me to not let that be an excuse any more
It's been my excuse for a couple years now
fuck it, it's time to draw
that was me
I wanted a Maria version of <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
everyone's gotta start somewhere, right
I did an art but I'm too scared to post elsewhere so here <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
but I think I understand what you're saying
that's a very inventive description
Who is xaxas
where are you gonna bust this out then
`Do you feel lucky, dess?`
GUN!
so I'm thinking GUN!
CAPE!
well we already have
Good. Excellent.
did you not save the layers
`pin the misfortune`
Yes, good
getting that <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> outline was way easier than I thought it would be
<:MichaHee:260224421476696064>
apparently not
when I shitpost, I make sure to get it ***right***
it's all attention to detail
it
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
why
<@456226577798135808> what're your thoughts
closeup on the detail
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I did you one better
well then rip you
R, get nitro and I'll invite you to my personal serüáßer
And I don't exactly need Alice's permission to add commands to Kirichan <:MichaHee:260224421476696064>
but I need to brb for a bit
you will enjoy
I'm working on something
R
But you're right, it was the original plan
I feel dirty
Yeah, you do it. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Pings no longer work.
I'm re-enabling for fancontent now that random response is functional.
<:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
I've got 2% in config now
what % chance do we want
so this also feels a bit like bending to one loud person
90% certain Solo doesn't like her at all
I'm also like
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
Yeah I'll do that when I'm not working on something else, in the meantime I'll just disable ping and set to random response
It just, really rubs me the wrong way I guess
instead of "Saki please disable the bot" maybe "hey can we stop pinging her every ten seconds"
seems like blaming the wrong thing here
when it's completely user-driven
saying it's spammy
yeah but still
I really want to say "well maybe if you didn't just spam ping her, she wouldn't be spammy"
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
people always gotta ruin good things
The first one is easy. Second one, fairly straightforward. Last one, that's a *lot* of work
It'd require me to completely re-do how I pull logs, store the chain, and construct the message
I love it
more work earlier, less work now
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
lucky for us, all I have to do is change the config and run a command
aight good enough for me
oh
but if it's just him, I'd like to keep her there
I mean, if you can get like one or two more people who agree with you, then sure
I need more public support than one person
People other than Solo seem to be enjoying it
You said *make a motion* not *tell Saki to do it*
announcement spam was *annoying as shit*
but that was because one of my friends fucked up an announcement bot
I heard a billion bloops
but as written, it does seem a little off
As a spoken line, that would work fine
without context I have no idea how to even attempt that line
`gay and floof` indeed
like, that specific example
That seems like it might be a translation error
You like it so far?
Oh, nice
Oh are you QC for Zio?
sounds like a good plan
DL is Good People‚Ñ¢
not fightin
so fic is the place to go for
the show is gonna have fightin
The way I see it
congratulations, how does it feel
you are now officially my favourite fic author
I'm going to reserve the right to watch from the sidelines though
Please do
I'm sure you will
"suffering"
that's one of the better ones tbh
dess_. Shirabe Let's see the world do it, extra wholesome
dess_. Shirabe Now, launch a check on 100% wholesome
what's the electrolysis for?
shave that shit and do whatever makes you happy
arigato <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
just a heads up
i'm sitting out of fancontent for a bit
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
so that's <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
And I can still put on a professional face for public channels even when I'm pissy
I'm way better than I used to be
Hence my "I've been working on it" comment
Yeah, I'm well aware, I've done it in the past
but it pops up a lot
I've been working on dealing with it for a while
Yeah, that's probably my biggest character flaw is taking things way too personally
*deep breaths*
it's not an attack on me or Shirabe
I think I'm taking it too personally
Yknow
but yeah I get your point
who hardly says anything else
the vast majority of those pings were by Pizza Tactician
<:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
Yeah, I guess it is our job
but like I said earlier, maybe if he has a problem with people pinging Shirabe, ask them to stop
I always have to type out a thing, cut it, paste it in a DM to Kirichan, and then type out something polite
I honestly think I've heard him say something that *isn't* a complaint maybe twice
he's a really negative nancy
So I actually have strong feelings about solo's "strange opinions" but I try my best to stay impartial in public channels
I want to work on tomorrow's session, and do some arting
now: no
Possible: yes
Yeah, I mentioned I re-enabled her there
Langou is... odd. And I'm slightly worried
Same
because that's some pretty NSFW text, SFW picture
<@!127644949884698624> how NSFW is hiero allowed to get
Oh, that's neat
Habitica?
nicu
we addressed a lot of this in the vocal debrief
especially if we keep having those conversations afterwards
I have faith that it'll get better
I'll talk to them about it if it continues next time
I was honestly very tempted to ban Klepto as a weakness
Yeah I did feel like I missed at least one thing
it's not as disruptive in text as it would be in voice
and Ibu's trying to dial it back
Faye and Yuki are starting to talk more
people are slowly getting used to it
we were actually talking about that a lot
and 90% sure it was langou but I have no way of checking
I don't feel bad at all about that outburst
anyway thank you for the kind words Alice, I really appreciate it
`R I'M TRYING MY BEST BUT SHIRABE ONLY HAS SO MUCH CPU TO WORK WITH`
"the geahs find a horribly inaccurate wiki about themselves"
the first prompt should be
who this
but I'm still a wee babe
I'd like to participate in the first one
don't go too fast on that
Did you appreciate my commitment to the theme
did you fill out your own form
I filled out your form
did we need the infiniping gauntlet for that one <@456226577798135808>
Good plan
and so far the only thing on said list
the rewatch was on the list of possibilities
We were still puzzling over it
*rapidly approaching*

Shirabe's daisukis are just
I found THIS
BUT
`or my berries`
I didn't find that Bikki
or GX
is that G Bikki
probably
OVER
BIKKI THAT
DO YOU BIKKI
I REPEAT

<@456226577798135808> YOUR BIKKIS HAVE BEEN BIKKI'D, DO YOU BIKKI

and not something that we were planning on doing anyway
I feel like it should be something that allows for participation

bonus 2
bonus 1






screencap or fanart?
since you asked nicely
Which is a premise that have to respectfully reject
That implies that Kirichan can have too much attention
I demand an answer
Hmm
why is Kiri not good enough for you
but bikki
<:KiriSAVE:433174831002025984>
so something like
Oh boy
oh damn this is still a wee bab
what year, 2016 or 2017
discord anniversary?
If I remember later I might
I could very well do that
<:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
so we might be surprised
We were both floored by the 70 number
whereas he just excluded the xdu ones

<:JiiThreeSeconds:442974585650937856>
I have the bigger emoji stash
out of the two of us
basically, if it was reasonable to add to the config, it's been added to the config
<:JiiPleased:442974585596542987>
I really did prepare for everything
jii_reloadConfig
jii_reloadConfig
done <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
jii_reloadConfig
We'll test 1%
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
and 2% is fine imo, it streaks but that's the nature of RNG
integers only
*mostly just for me*
I'm very tempted to add a feature so trusted users can ping Shirabe for guaranteed response
GUN!
Oooooof.

where was it anyway
I got distracted by a meme
senkyuuuuu
right in frame
there
pong
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
**FORTNIGHTLY**
bi-weekly <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
<:ohno:400220431774121984>
to not exhaust people
the simulator thing should probably be fortnightly
has anyone suggested anything cooler than a skateboard trick contest

I can get Shirabe to do it
If it's open source
***SHIRABE AND KIRI ARE GONNA SWEEP THE ISLAND AND THEN KIRI IS GONNA WIN AND GIVE HALF TO JII***
I can probably make WHAT IN HELL IS THIS
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
is it open source
wut
`R is being humored`
that sounds like hell
is there something you want to tell us
you've been focused on dicks tonight
I actually don't know the answer to this
is it a Secret Kiri in Smash
imma be upset
if it's not a Secret Bikki in Smash
and it's *also* gonna have to wait until my arting abilities are good enough for me to make sprites
probably also Kanade because I like WFC
so definitely main 6
the character roster is basically gonna be whoever I feel like doing sprites of
XDU sucks ***ass***
I refuse to do Ver sprite
I mean, not okay but also there's nothing they could do about it either
I think I'd like it more if there was just, another relic that could access the treasury
I've got an entire engine to familiarize myself with ***and*** I've got to keep working on the whole arting business
I don't even want to start thinking about story
And give IGNITEs actually decent EDM
Plus that lets you have Chris play "Roundabout" when she Mega Deth Fugas if you really want her to
Pff. I'd rig up a "custom music" system where you just drop in the relevant character albums so we aren't distributing them ourselves
Does it do action games alright, I thought it was more RPG
I've yet to work with that one
Have you put any thought into choice of engine
So I'd still be doing regular sprite work and not 3d modelling, right
2d or 2.5d?
I'd probably want to make a smash-style pvp mode at some point too but that's just because I love that kind of fighto
Old-school
sidescroller, beat up a shitload of enemies, move on?
musou?
I think *balal* is getting in the way here
wut
Are you thinking Smash or Street Fighter style
I see
Or did you mean "changes until the next special"
That might get really musically busy
why 9
Absolutely no questions asked
I mean, 100% down.
daijobu
*sigh*
I'm going to do what I normally do and try to ignore the problem
<:wut:235243292965470208>
here u go
i'm scared to post elsewhere so
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>

I can't quite get to sleep, I'm a bit stressed about tomorrow, and I just watched a very moving video. This perfect storm has left me in a peculiar place, emotionally speaking, and thus I feel the need to say that I appreciate you folks. Thanks for existing, you make my life better by being in it.
interesting
maybe?
I think you can construct teams freely with online stuff
Yeah I don't want competitive battling to be a main thing
welcome bjkt
wut
I'll give it a go with you
R, if you wanna try that pokemon thing, gimme an hour, hour and a half
whats the point in making a hard to guess password on an unsecure connection

that's a good sign, right

but I'm expecting hot, hot garbo
we can certainly try it out
*skeptical is one of many things I am feeling right now*

yeah if you're gonna cheat for a temp title, you've got some bigger problems
because ideally people would post about their stuff en route
Anything with "speed" is probably a bad idea
That sounds like a good way to get me interested in ***actually playing*** a pokemon game again
but I kinda want to be the main art person on the project and if we presented this idea *now* I'm 100% not qualified
no timeframe, I was working on art skills *anyway*
I'm not about to go stressing myself out about it
`working on it`
"artist"
I'm working on the first one.
I'm already the second one.
We're talking about Gamemaker
It's not gonna be a fighto, at least at first, and when it is, my buddy would love to help out with design
how was drugs
you're surprisingly coherent
don't be a negative nancy <:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
we'd have to decentralize distribution for sure, or ideally just keep it small
Protected IP and whatnot
Langou likes to say 3D>2D in nsfw and I'm so proud of everyone for not taking the bait
I'm nowhere near confident enough in my ability to make arts
Again this is like, advanced planning
Yeah Miku probably too
it's the low-detail emoji ver.
here
he says yes
okay hold on lemme contact the artist
really
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Plus I'm 100% down for having the DMJii cooperation <:DMJii:457034117733941279>
Yeah, that'd be super ez
Uhhhh I might be able to do it through the config with no other changes. Failing that, it'd be trivial if there's a very specific set of qualifications for each message
Aight, I can work on that
wonder why
Ibu's friend that she warned us about just bailed
I shall take that as a compliment
did you really think it was from the OVAs
I drew it
no
...
<:DMJii:457034117733941279>
Oh, before the crash?
are you actually using her this time or is she languishing in boxsu
I'm glad everyone is on-board with the BlueMadoka scorecard
that's the one I noticed
`nice`
Litrock?
are we still at <:BlueMadoka:454043800998772736> <:BlueMadokaFighto:454043813720358926> by the way
I did not
if you're giving people a month, it should be pretty even
cant you change the clock on a DS
<a:micha_nodding:432434127149727744>
I have no idea what you're talking about
I'm assuming the idea is to swap <:KanadeSmile:341463635492601856> with <:DMJii:457034117733941279>
so I need to test it
I never got around to it before
the role assignment reaction thing
I'll test the emoji thing when I get home tomorrow, I can't manage emoji on my test server from mobile
only slightly, I'm bouta drive
if he was confrontational then he would have said straight up what it was about, idk
I'm concerned about this

dear lord
>crossdressing flag
Yeah I don't feel like sticking my nose into drama, I'm just curious about the goings-on
oh did something happen on valk
what did I miss
who
wait what does Shirabe need to do, just the message thing?
like 90% sure I was on phone at the time
I wasn't at home
<:ChrisSmug:273373218365243392>
i don't actually care but there was finally a relevant time for that

also <@456226577798135808> what, I'm finally back at PC and I'm insatiably curious
I'm probably forgetting something for me
am i forgetting anything for y'all
to-do list

im eating a bit and gotta take care of a fathers day thingo r q
just got home
so that's my personal vote
but it makes the most sense
I care about figures and hate gunpla
is super selfish
my problem with that
kits-and-figures
the will of the people and all that I spose
*sigh*
also looks like we have support for a goddamn gunpla channel
I can try
also which one is Green
if real then sure, it's a good look
joke or no
<:wut:235243292965470208>
so let me know your character description and I can try later
I actually have an idea for the first one
Probably either horizontal 3 panel or box 4 panel, or even just single scenes. I'm not sure how well I'll be able to do this, time-wise but given that I eventually want to do a doujin it'll be good to know where I'm starting from
it actually might be a decent learning exercise tbh
I could try to work on my quick sketch skills
I guess I'd need a description of your headcanon character and the events you want illustrated then
you probably wouldn't like how it turns out <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
Not that I wouldn't love to try but
it'll look bluh because I only just started <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
that's *pressure*
Oh god oh no
Oh no
Oh god
we can't add stuff because one person asks
I think we need to judge community interest first
Joe and Chris I think
unless you mean a new channel in that *category*
Like, I have an active dislike for them so I'd rather we didn't merge them into sfw
I really don't want to have to sift through gunpla to get my cute girls
Gimme like 2-3 hours
I stayed over at dragons last night in san Diego
When I get home, sure
that's right
O this is separate from the CA
Ye sure
Another one?
I'm okay with this
I'VE BEEN IN SERIOUS DISCUSSION
yes
hi
what
<:GenjurouThumbsUp:267393750349643776>
huh.
I didn't actually realize what that was until now either
oh I thought you meant just now
here
repost?
I see you got to it already
so yeah we'll put the word out
i know we had a few extra people interested
from the rpg, not the serber
i've been calling the sessions "episodes" in my notes
we're two weeks behind on episodes <:BikiShock:447891354278821888>
the senate supports this motion
mhmm
I used my regional indicator generator and everything
dammit <@!127644949884698624> you beat me to it
never heppened
what pictures
are undert the infuluence
that 2 of us
ur ewll aware
com
uses saucenao.cpom
shirabe.exe
I think I'll go with this and put the ally flag on my backpack? I didn't know there was an ally flag tbh
and the colors are *fantastic*
but I want to be outward about my support
I'm worried about intruding is all
I just
I'm not trying to be patronizing or anything
I'm well aware
do I have your blessing then
https://www.etsy.com/listing/565701354/trans-pride-paracord-bracelet?ref=bestselling_by_query-1
but no permission meant it was on borrowed time anyway I spose
its a good one
same
<@!127644949884698624> so if I walked around wearing this, that would be fine?
gettin stuff ***DONE***
im being productive

so you're good to remove Kanade
it*
I does
i'm gonna restart Kirichan and see if it persists
<@!127644949884698624> So I removed Basaval1 and it's still doing the role assignment

how do you ping when they're not present?
dess_warn @Airgetfrog#1040 Please refrain from using slurs in any context
airgetfrog with the dank "ni**a" in <#357682999300718592>, do they have a history
that sucks
or are reports anonymous
does it say which user
Oh. Nice.
what's the context for this
i'm gonna try sleeping some of it off
today is a really bad brain day
not gonna lie, I thought the lack of self-awareness was *hilarious*
twice, I think
I straight up told her to stop patronizing
interesting times
I have no idea what Shirabe thinks they're adding to the conversation but it's nothing good
arms are extremely WIP
here's my WIP <@!127644949884698624>, your move on writing
it's just practically made for you
its not bad
<@!127644949884698624> make sure you look at hiero
the habitica thingo, that is
do you want me to
is it a huge hassle like the other ones I've tried
I *guess*
promisewarned?
or... warned?
I was promised a week of being high
i haven't done any drawing in a few days
So next time langou breaks da rulez, he gets the boot?
bikki is me right now
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
i think the "no straight up porn" is fine
how do you propose going about that
it's definitely borderline
I dunno, I think it's okay?
wow my "trying to hit apostrophe but hitting enter instead" has been bad today
's pretty good at that
I say she because that's what I saw Alice doing and I know she
reaffirmed my initial assumption that bisa isn't worth interacting with
I skimmed
bad things
<:ChrisSmug:273373218365243392>
Just got this message from Lily:
"so, I just finished going through all that went down earlier today apparently. maybe it's not good to refer to it afterwards, but I just really want to say how much I appreciate you and rest of the mod team. especially after reading everything in the other server that happened with ibu, it makes me really happy that that's not allowed on the reddit discord. it's such a nice breath of fresh air in comparison to other anime communities"
Which is why I was leaning against it, to be perfectly honest
the ban screen is pretty great
I'm just glad we don't have to be worried every time "Langou is typing..." shows up
Ugh. I think the whole intersex erasure thing is awful but I don't want continuous, obvious patronizing polluting <#336297840529899522>.
Keeping an eye on Hazel.
i'm gonna start using that all the goddamn time to fix minor typops
apparently so
does that only work on your last message
oh neat
memes but more of them
wut
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
but not mobile
@ViviS#0454
see it works on PC
<@!225771411833225216>
discord is weird
must be desktop only
I tried that on mobile but it didn't work
it's nice that we've got a system to log infractions now though
<:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
and it's a little late to try again
so no, it didn't
dess_warnlogall
dess_warnlog
we'll get them when they pop up
Yeah don't do that
"who the fuck does it hurt?"
that should really be where it starts and ends
that last thing you said tho
I just forgot
oh yeah I didn't mean it as a negative
I forget that they're stratified
oh, admin only, right
Like an entire channel specifically for being bitchy?
"both sides" is me not letting hazel be patronizing even though I agree with her because that ain't cool. it's not "HURR I'M GOING TO MISGENDER YOU ON PURPOSE BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE BROKEN AND I'M ENTITLED TO MY OPINION"
fuckinnnnnn
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
what does that even mean
>disagreeing with your psychology
If you've got a grand strategy, then by all means
I remember that
I already barely interact with them as-is.
please try your best
R, are you sure you can commit to the "no more angry rants"
I'm outie


because there's quite a few on that list so far
>I'll call a trans girl a girl when they can give birth

Do we need to maintain a "ban on sight" list
I think you were thinking one thing and typed another
Uh
"Victim blaming is bad, buuuuuut it's kinda their fault!"
Any temporary color change wouldn't work too well because afaik discord will update every message's author color to their current highest tier role color under certain, very common circumstances
I'm very interested in how this turns out
so yeah, talk to them
I'm honestly not sure what was up with Sparkle yesterday
also :bikki: and :ikkib:
<:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
Saki thinks this is a weird hill to die on
<@456226577798135808> Saki thinks sparkle is projecting a bit here
and ShirabeThink kthnx
so I can put it on my personal server
I need the genjuro laughing emote from valk
<@!127644949884698624> this is an emergency
following my example, probably
who was it
<:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
can't
`I REPORT THE SAME, LEIUTENANT. A SOUND STRATEGIC DECISION IF I'VE EVER HEARD ONE.`
it's dependent on a lot of things
If and when these plans get finalized I'll let you know
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
it's still very tentative
around August 4th, if at all
wanna hang out and eat pizza
<@127644949884698624> I might be in NYC in August
*Shirabe is typing*
I really wanted to encourage more people to leave but I also didn't want to stir up a "two camps" thing
and then gets on my case about tone policing
Hazel is an issue because I'm on her side but she goes about things in a completely counterproductive manner
I can keep an eye on though
I'm out for dinner so you'd probably be on your own if it gets too heavy
offer's on the table
something to consider then

jii_feedback 3 whoever wrote this needs to learn how to use commas

(I get sent a DM by Shirabe, reading: "whoever wrote this needs to learn how to use commas")
you give each work a number, right?
<@456226577798135808> I have an idea for feedback...
but psychologically there is
mechanically there's no real difference between a self-remove quarantine role and a kick + invite
Yes, that's possible
Oh yeah I remember the Rukia Incident, forgot the RA role was involved
I think the only time I've seen it used was when you gave it to yourself after getting high as balls
So kick + send invite is the officially sanctioned response?
And also mutes them in voice chat, obviously
The Kirichan "mute" feature just applies a role that we set up in advance, afaik
blocking access to serious discussion is useful, imo
I'm well aware
Mhm.
If that happens I'm ***definitely*** gonna get yelled at for tone policing again though. Bluh.
Will keep that in mind.
it's the difference between "make sure you're packing heat" and "that neighborhood used to be awful but they turned it around"

One dess if you're worried about Ryouko, <@431656503490117632>
I do really like Maria...
Ideally we'd just roll Ryoko into either Shirabe or Kirichan though
The context of the parody makes me lean on the "it's fine" side as well
what a fucking tool
good fucking riddance
I had no idea they were here at all
they were here?
Further validation that I made the correct decision.
the writingSetup command would be to update the list each week

dess_warnlog <@107966612128153600>
dess_warnlogall
yes, that
and how do you propose we keep track of who we have warned in the past, in the event that it happens again?
I mean I could, in theory, rewrite the nadeko functions, but I'd have to learn node.js and figure out where each function is in the code and make sure I don't fuck up the javascript that I'm unfamiliar working with
I *really* don't want to write that.
I don't want to write that
but
no
fucking dess_tell "hey you did bad, don't do it again"
It was specifically mentioned that they aren't in trouble, wasn't it?
They wanted to show off what a dumb bot said, including telling someone to die. Sure, they understand what they did wrong, but that shit ***isn't okay***.
It *is* the same argument. "They didn't intend it to be transphobic!"
I don't want to deal with suicide jokes here, intended or not.
[any immediate punishment given] includes "you're not actually in trouble"
[what they did] [magnitude of offence] [any immediate punishment given] [appropriate sign-off]
Sure. "You're not in trouble, but that's not okay, don't do it again please" and a recording that they were told it was not acceptable. If they do it again, they don't get the "oh I didn't know" excuse.
If it doesn't happen again, then yippee.
The fact that it happened once is recorded. If it happens again, that's potentially indicative of a pattern, and having a record of that is nothing but good.
Saying "I'm on the fence about this" doesn't absolve anything.
Also: `there is a warn system in check that records users who do wrong`

There is. It's Kirichan. Cast's post was "doing wrong," they were notified, it was recorded as a minor thing.
I don't think I was privy to the "message deletion is bad" conversation because that's definitely not an absolute
And they deserve to know why their message is being deleted
as you said before, we're not robots. we can use our judgement on the warns in an individual's log more than just "how many are there"
this, exactly
`If it's enough to be deleted, it's enough to be recorded`
So. <@!127644949884698624> you have my stance on this issue. One log, Cast's post should be in it, recorded as a very minor offence.
I have a ***hard fucking no*** on suicide jokes.
Considering that I have had some ***very personal*** issues with suicide, yeah.

Cast deserved a (minor, but still present) warning to be in the official log. Having two logs is useless and counterproductive because then we'd need to check two places instead of just one for the exact same information. The current log isn't "USER WAS WARNED" it's "USER WAS WARNED: HERE IS WHY."

If you want another log, then you can go and write some code for me to add to Shirabe because I really don't feel it's necessary or useful. I'm not gonna pull that "if you want it then you do it" for much, but I'm pulling it here because I'd need to sort out a way to store the logs and read them efficiently but ***Kirichan already does so, so why should I need to?*** A log of warnings is a log of warnings, it's not a "three strikes you're out," it's not a "here's every little thing done wrong," it's "this is everything we felt was worthy of note. severity in the warn text."

I'm mostly just concerned about my personal memory is all, I like having stuff written down
<:DMJii:458047433067200512>
I'd like to apologize for my tone. I shouldn't have been getting so upset about a disagreement.
Okay.
And how do we check, as a group, if they like to cause problems?
`3. Are a member who usually doesn't cause any problems`
Honestly I'm willing to agree with whatever so we can put this issue to bed, consider your filibustering successful

Speaking of the subreddit, would it be worth it/okay to add me to the subreddit mods list? There's a rare occasion where I'd like to speak in an official capacity in comments (like, three times total) but *I have no power in that domain*
Well, we'd need a place to display their link, both on discord and the subreddit (because they have a Friendly Subreddits section there too)
they stopped typing. this is good, probably.
`I think someone's about to drop some homophobia in the Madoka chat`
but it's definitely possible
I'd have to look into how to start youtube sound streams
and that is definitely possible
well if the only reason not to was "well we're both too busy" then I'll see what I can do with them over there
Like, in general or specifically the Madoka folks
So after I get buddy buddy with the folks over there, that might perhaps be something we may or may not be interested in maybe
The reason I'm bringing it up here is because they have an "Affiliated Servers" link that consists of mutually linked servers to other anime
`I have infiltrated the Madoka discord`
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
Maria emoji please
`SHE'S GOT NITRO`
BUT STILL
THAT DOESN'T HAVE <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I TRIED THAT ON MY PERSONAL SERVER
OKAY HOLD UP A GODDAMN SECOND
dess
I'll keep that in mind
<:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>
I assumed it was some game or anime or something
Oh so that's why my quick google didn't help
Because I sure don't
Does anyone like being actively excluded from conversation?
I will when I get home
"Div 2 Engineer"?
For the Service Medal
If we want something sciency and antagonistic, I can think of something
Splitting off the colors is very doable
But it sounds good
Idk if it's a real thing
Outstanding Service Medal seems appropriate
Military medals given to civilians specifically
What are some awards given to civilians
I'm thinking more like a paramilitary medal
What's the SONG equivalent of a gold star
On theme though
`oh good I still have it`
Because like, that's where DESS comes from
This seems like it's basically the Legacy Role situation
Damn, missed it by 4 minutes
Also good morning
Wha
Wait Ibu left
I'm looking into other options
Yeah because the reddit RSS likes to stop working
Who the fuck knows anymore
`Don't let your dreams be dreams`
Me and R are the angel and devil on your shoulder right now
Important word there
Not accomplished nearly enough ***yet***
I'm very glad to be a part of this effort
From what I've heard from a few members of our community, we're doing a great job of it
I believe I've mentioned but I'm actually not an anime fan, I'm a fan of lots of things some of which are anime
Yeah I'm starting to realize this
So there's hope yet, I guess
He seemed understanding when I explained why that's a Not Good Thing‚Ñ¢
It's our DMs
JT is definitely not one of mine
<a:PicardFacepalm:396333078534029313>
Like it's right at the top of the goddamn welcome message
Goddammit why people gotta be weird

augmented,
`IT IS DONE`
because I have no idea
I need you to find this for me
I don't remember this
` I'm not concerned with encouragement as it occurs beyond the server`
Presumably, "evidence" here implies "evidence worthy of ban"
I mean they know the rules
are half the server blatantly transphobic?
It definitely is something we have to use very carefully
Hence my " I still think the kick was deserved in this instance" comment
Yeah I didn't think of that, but at the same time a horrible person is a horrible person. As much as I'd like to, it's not a good idea to treat everything like it's sent here. I still think the kick was deserved in this instance, but yeah we gotta be careful with this
Thanks for typing that out, I appreciate it
Reasonable.
<:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
and why, exactly?
but I ain't in the business of getting offended for people so it's up to you
you're being awfully generous
show em the door, and a swift kick in the ass
are they on our server?

One step at a time

If that's the path you want to tread, I'll be right there behind you, and many others too I'm sure
You can count on me to help out, that's for sure
It's not Shirabe, it's reddit
I like how the core principles are oddly specific to an argument that was had a couple hours ago
that has to have been self-sabotage because nobody could possibly be that stupid
yeah that's
jesus christ that sounds like a trashfire
however my opinion still stands at "we don't really need more than three, at this present moment"
Elise may or may not be interested but I fully support at least asking her if the situation should arise
we ain't about to shove this on anyone
oh of course
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
and from my talking with her, she actually checks in quite often but doesn't feel like she has much to add
brought me on anyway
I certainly didn't have any experience
I mean, I veto'd at least one suggestion for similarly wishy-washy reasons
*sips coffee*
raise your hand if you're surprised that a "waifu" community has a vocal section vehemently opposed to banning the word "trap"

oh, update on the "JT's waifu server wants Kirichan" situation
<:nagisahasspecialeyes:366003497767796737>
<a:FlippingEyes:442017142859104257>
Oh, apparently it's because the user in question was only around for two months before being appointed mod
But the drama is *delicious* as a bystander
Or what brand of alleged shitheaddery
I don't know how true this is
r/madoka discord is a shitshow because one of their new mods is apparently widely known as a shithead
Oh damn
If I have to give up DESS then you have to give up CAPE, it's only fair
CAPE!
<:NononPout:454088299963875349>
I thought they were perfectly acceptable.
Oh are we not using the same colors as current?
`You served us well but your time has come. Godspeed, DESS.`
<:RecruitSalute:440719325306028032>
I also work again today so I'll be very unreliable until 1530 pacific
The only reason I haven't seperated reps and colors yet already is the role bloat situation. I'm in favor of removing legacy roles, even if that means I lose my precious DESS
still don't understand
I don't understand
Which has been resolved tentatively by this solution
I was just worried that there qas was a complete lack of recourse available to us
No offense meant, of course. Real life responsibilities and whatnot
If we're planning on enforcing these rules internally, we'd definitely need someone more active than her, absolutely
Oh so custodians can report to other custodians
I completely disagree with that interpretation. Why should I wait until someone else has been impacted by this hypothetical asshole
So if I was made to feel unsafe due to someone's actions outside the server, I would have to wait until someone else was also affected?
I'd like to point out that "a user" includes us, given that we are users on the server
<:15min:453039155975553035>
If B wishes to repair the relationship, A has to be receptive
I'd say the two users need to talk it out personally before any decisions are made on our part
There's plenty of reasons for banning Trump
You know I'm a big fan of rules, procedures, and checklists. If we can put a set of criteria together, then I can't see myself having an issue following it
That doesn't actually surprise me, but I'm glad that statistics exist
<a:HomuraClap:393560045817692171>
Weren't we just having a legislative discussion involving the synthesis of new rules?
*Steps down from podium*
I'd appreciate being given that little bit of extra good will and showing that I am, in fact, responsible and reasonable enough to be worth it.
First of all: I never said that I felt unfit for the job. I simply dislike voting for myself as a matter of principle.

Second of all: I haven't exactly been in a position where I've felt necessary to "hold you back," as it were. If such a situation does arise, I have the utmost faith in myself that I'd be able to tell you that you're acting out of line.

Lastly: The difference between Illuminati and Custodian in terms of raw power is negligible. There is, however a difference in accountability and responsibility to the community, and while yes I don't have a significant amount of formal moderation experience, the fact that I'm here at all shows a significant level of faith in me as a person and as a member of this community.
<:mariaWave:409855829941157888>
3 minutes later
Red-light
But driving
I have things to say
```
This is probably bad timing but I have to drive my parents home, I'll be back in 20-30 minutes
```
I don't particularly see a problem with that
<:ShirabeThink:461322366010654730>
<a:MadoThumbsUp:393571557798313985>
Considering the lack of power discrepancy, I'd agree
Anything over 10% just feels rediculously top-heavy to me
Iirc
As a percentage, it was at the time, but as a raw comparison they still had significantly more
14 staff with 70 active members ***is*** 20%, actually
I'm definitely gonna need some hard data for that because nearing 20% staff seems absurd to me
For a community of 70 active members, at the high end?
I still disagree that we need *any* more staff at this exact moment
Thicker meaning more tiers, presumably
bitch we went to the ***FAIR*** together
`new`
to read it
but it certainly makes me feel better
in a manner that has very debatable productivity
oh right for some reason I assumed that was the question
kick/ban basically
I knew you would
Hey look, now you don't need my phone to see the submarine
keep the chain of custody
so I feel like it is my responsibility to pop the question to the `new blood`
it began with R asking me first in DMs
I'd say yes
indeed
being real life busy means you have less pull in online activities
which is the reason for my statement, incidentally
if that is indeed the next choice
I'd say asking Latooni would more represent the **WILL OF THE PEOPLE**
`I'm used to talking on eggshells`
Not trying to imply that those missteps will be made, but addressing your concerns.
I do agree with you, however in this particular case it's hardly a unilateral legislation position. There are still checks and balances that prevent any severe missteps.
Yeah I'm definitely not throwing a "I'm taking my toys and going home" tantrum
`metaphor extension is odd`
`oh that could possibly be construed as a stepping down from Illuminati, whoops`
And with regards to last night, we did all eventually agree that nobody was sad to see them go, and I said absolutely nothing about future events. However, if I'm no longer in consideration, I'll be taking my green name and stepping off the stage entirely.
and we're all judicial atm
I think we decided that the custodians are the prime legislators
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
you lost my emphasis
ü•Å
I still don't know how I manage it
cynical but also optimistic somehow
can I add some adjectives to my summary
Oh I remember that, I was at REI and had bad reception so it was a game of "when is this gonna cease"
it's been some bullshit, yeah
it's definitely reins
He's `very volatile` and the fact that I don't know what to be concerned about is, in and of itself, an additional concern.
R, I'm gonna be frank here.
I thought that meant something
michael's look off to the side after the "eight percent" fucking killed me
Fuck
And im sitting here like "why did I like that pronoun"
And Hana was like "it means saki is trans and she hasn't realized it yet"
Fucking one of my friends asked what an egg was
I love traa memes
I can't say no to an emoji request
Elise made me make it
<:SakiEgg:463997397392031755>
Yeah but Hana Elise and you have all said I do very eggy things
oh?
but I've had work and work uses literally all of my spoons
that I should have started by now
I have a project
that's actually for the future
CAPE!
do you need me to update the
I'd say pick your color
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208> If it's not obvious by now, I really wanted the position, but I understand why the decision was made as such.
So am I
***FUCKING EVER***
I knew it happened but not exactly how
Actually I don't think I know about the rise to power
My shenanigans can wait
R take it away
Alright
Uh
Yeah no you're good
`while looking for egg references in Alice's chatlog she was using him and himself and that just looks weird now even though it didn't before and now I'm really confused`
But one more thing
You're all good
I'm not concerned with acceptance here
To avoid confusion more than anything else
So `yes please`
Several other people are
And at this point I'm not sure so like how can I argue with that
Oh see that's actually one of the things I'm mildly concerned about? "You're not actually, you just want to invade our spaces"
Shame and/or lying to oneself
That I think Latooni would like to avoid
"Closeted" also has *connotations*
Closeted nb, which is different from closeted trans right?
As always
Memory is fallible
So did I
But see, Latooni your response is "but I'm definitely a boy tho" where as mine is <:ShirabeThink:461322366010654730>
<:SakiEgg:463997397392031755>
You've definitely said I was eggy before last night
I feel like you did
Didn't you call me an egg at some point several days ago
It's an inclusive or
Are you an eldritch being or just groggy
<:madokawave:366003510010970122>
And it was very entertaining
Like, I don't agree with R's methods but goddamn tgey got results
At best
Wasn't that like, a month ago
>long since
I think he's going chronologically
Oh 7 then
~~and not in a good way~~
So four-ish months of getting stepped on
Birthday Mafia is coming up
I wholeheartedly approve of past Alice's decisions
Gotta be two months
*grumbles*
I like symphogi
Kirichan does more than just memes
For worst case
Kirichan has a raid protection mode built-in
And yes the rules page is gorgeous
Rule 5 is the interpretation clause right
And then Sparkle's weird rape apology apology which I think we're all still a little "wut" about
There was some conversation in their serious-discussion that didn't even get a slap on the wrist and I said I was donezo
Yeah I fucking bailed because of some straw that I can't really remember
I don't interact much
I think they dislike me because of my affiliation and my whole "fuck this shit I'm out"
I like watching because they squirm, but I'd also like to try to repair relations, but I'm not sure if they even deserve that, basically it's a ball of fuck imo
That's it
So if you see a ban and a bunch of deletes
I had to ban a spambot who joined and shouted a discord link in literally every channel
o ok
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
I was busy
what did nobody see
apparently not
but Ibu is on another serber
no not yet
That's fair, I guess
<:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
oh yeah that was a shitshow on all accounts
Aw rip
you get used to it tho
Yeah I was like "here's how big it is when you can see ***everything***"
approval from the House of Commons has been granted
<:madokathumbsup:406514447973351444>
like, less than an hour from joining the server in the first place
It was something about GX and how I was actually enjoying it at the time
He just seemed like the type of person to shove his opinion down everyone else's throat and shout you down if you dared oppose
Bisa is actually the reason I started disassociating with valk in the first place, way before I joined staff here
I second Bisa and Xaxas
Yeah I don't particularly enjoy the callout culture thing
Get rekt scrub
And sends a DM, yeah
Displays a notification in the channel used
Here's what it looks like with the icons
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Figured now would be a good time for a new phone lockscreen/wallpaper
__latooni miku__
But it was always like "aw, one less person doing that now" when it happened
Yeah never any guilt at all because I never actively encouraged it
Never could put my finger on why
It's less that I found it thrilling, but when people would meet me in game they'd use she/her because of my character being female, and I would always get kind sad when they'd either meet me in voip or one of my friends used he in their presence or whatever
Thanks
I feel so loved right now, goddamn
<:huggo:405949421570883599>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
To avoid confusion
They/them until I feel like making it more public
<:ChrisSmug:273373218365243392>
I'm going to do that out of spite
Considering what he said earlier
<:ShirabeThink:461322366010654730>
I don't feel bad about saving it any more
Then why the fuck do they get so sentimental over that Chris/Bikki hug
Wait Chris is homophobic? I thought he and Joe were together, what in hell
I think switch exclusive
Uh I had just made it to a city, and there was a heart-to-heart in a theater
headpat
*play gun girls*
Why pout face
Just remember that you can only fight five times before needing to stop at a helipad
Oh uh. Friend support, set to capture base, try and survive long enough usually works
Or use two of your own squads, and capture the base via encirclement without actually fighting the boss
Use my friend squad, set to capture base, and just survive long enough
So you can actually probably do it now if you try one of two ways:
But nothing bad really happens apart from the wasted energy
As far as the sim is concerned, you get a lot less exp if you can't complete it
That's for levelling
http://dmesse.egloos.com/m/3567918
Which sim are you doing
Once you have more echelons than you know what to do with, that's when you autobattle
One sec I'll get you a link
No, uuuuh
Can't remember what PP-90 does
MP5 has a really good skill
It's nice to have a stash. Psychologically speaking
50+% chance of contract per 2 hours really can't be beat
1-4 is pretty much always useful
Sounds like a good plan
Logistics are free to run and give you stuff in return
No those are rewards
You wanna always have one squad on 1-4 though, for contracts
I prefer the ones that are around 1-2 hours long, not the 20 minute ones from early chapters
But they've got short timers so more micro
Actually one of the chapter 2 logistics is the best for rations
Damage + ROF up
Her formation buff is awful but her skill is pretty solid
Uuuh lemme check her one sec
Which is a shame because I love her aesthetic
For similar reasons
Which is **the** worst gun in the game
Micro-uzi
The AK-47 is probably the second worst gun in the game
Every AR is better than AK-47
But like, as long as it's not completely worthless, you can make a team for any specific raifu
There are a few trash-tier MGs because their skill is horrendous
AK-47 is awful because she buffs SMGs directly above and below her, so they would never get ~~good~~ used
Its the formation buff and the skills
The main thing isn't really the stats
So I quick repaired them all after they got rekt and then redeployed in the same mission
And boss damage persists
Oh yeah I remember doing one mission where my main squad got the boss down to like 20%
Because I still have that problem
Did you figure out how to do it
What do you mean
I'll do it when I get outta bed
<:KiriCheer:442974585529434113>
My order is if I like them more they're higher up. Not arbitrary at all.
<:NononPout:454088299963875349>
Did you even look
Shirabe is actually towards the bottom
It's not arbitrary in the slightest
I also have them in a specific order
It was an active decision
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I think changing yttt is better than changing bikki tbh
Well we're going to shift Shirabe's pink a bit
VERY!
Do you know how awful light mode looks?
I made them look good in night AND light mode!
But Boss why we gotta change the colors, I slaved over the current ones <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
Don't lie to yourself
Do they also explain the concept of blushy-crushy
Oh jesus wow
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
I'm a fake fan, I like the chronicles but I've never played any of the others
Ah, got it
I was gonna say, she looks more... Cyborgy, or whatever the man-machine amalgamations are called
<:FerrisThink:465485767905640468>
Are they ever *antagonistic*
Are they always protagonists
I'd say 'relatively high' rather than just 'high'
Yeah that's definitely a contributing factor I'm sure
God yes
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Kree-sah
Do I need to look at chats very right now or can I keep getting ready for my appointment
Name change is important yes
I'm never gonna not joke about that because that was goddamn hilarious
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
you also have a car full of "illegal immigrants"

No mobage is worth not eating
But that's $60 you don't have right now
Don't spend gems on anything that isn't echelon slots until you have at least 8
But you've got the right idea
It really is
It's her hair you nerd
I have a strong dislike of removing options, that's my main thing here. If Kanared is an option now, I'd want it to remain an option unless literally nobody is using it.
If I see that he's taken the orange, then I'll merge the original colors.
I'll be grabbing the Igalima role regardless <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Unless you want to specify which is your favorite.
Well if I leave the colors as-is, WFC can just opt-out of the override and stay Kanared. If the current stratification gives you the color you want anyway, you could just not use the overrides
And I'm not removing the colors on the old ones so that they're still colored in the list that pops up when you click on someone
Not even "Gungnir Orange" just "Gungnir"
I do prefer the first option
Probably for WFC
As it stands
Kanade is more red than Bikki is
We make the color role name "Color Me Hibiki", "Color Me Miku" etc.
We make the color role the name of the relic. Problem arises with Kanade/Bikki.
But! We have two options, with the third of "neither here's something else" implied
before it occurred
but I wanted to clear up the other case
yeah this one is different
so is that the official, endorsed response, warn and kick simultaneously?
saying "you should go kill yourself" is ***definitely*** grounds for an official warning and I'd like to be instant kick as well
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
I see a desu
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
I have a ton of jackets but this one is by far my favorite
And wet shower hair too whoops
Please excuse doofy smile
You wanted photo of jacket so here
I do a lot of things for the nebulous concept of "the meme"
But it's for the meme
I definitely don't
I actually just asked my friend (who is gay) if I can now join him in referring to the gays as "the gays" and I am waiting eagerly for the response

Every ten minutes
Yeah like
<@99695384296701952> she/her is fine now
Me and ZBD, mostly
I'm actually fuckin down
why ***is*** shirabe dead
My pathfinder character is named Kriisa so I put it on the shortlist, and it feels right
I mean, Kris would be perfectly acceptable and androgynous enough
so should I say Kriisa then
On a corporate level, sure. And it is starbucks, so...
but yes, it is a very good app
that'd still raise questions but not nearly as many
I'm very tempted to say Kris for the time being
fucking job apps


it's a lot of work but it's also fun when you get it working properly
you mentioned it to me at least
like, SONG was supposed to be paranormal disaster relief
At least, have a new enemy to fight
at least if I'm DMing
`more experienced please`
When I die I want my ashes ejected out of a satellite that's leaving the solar system
For real though
Can we put that on a satellite and launch it into space
Let the record state that I'm a girl goddammit
It was a combination of (expected) resistance to change and ignorance which hopefully we'll be able to work through over time
Oh definitely
She ***is*** refusing to use she/her and is going to go with they/them which is better than he/him and honestly I'll take what I can get
We settled on "it's okay to make mistakes but I'm going to gently remind you every damn time" which is actually perfectly reasonable 100%
So I excused myself, fumed a bit and then resumed the conversation over text
"you're neither a man or a woman now, you're a person" was said
Mum knows now, dad doesn't
I never actually read through it because ***overload***
K-on if my sources are correct, yeah
Oh jesus probably that, yeah
‚úä
3/5 is more than half
honestly
that's bad DMing
I honestly like whatever as long as it's consistent
and a couple lower sometimes for DRAMATIC EFFECT
I've had enemies roll like, one higher DEF than they actually did
it's why I roll physical dice
in our campaign
I've lied about rolls several times
just gonna drop that there
https://discord.gg/JyB7wF
it's one of my emoji hosts but Kiri is already there
We can use the Lulu Bus
Kriisa smoothie is not on the menu <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
Meanwhile I'm sitting here with my insides feeling like they're going through a goddamn blender
I'm working and my student is taking a test
latooni with the ***BIG MOOD***
I don't remember a single instance of her actually changing her damn mind on anything
Her worldview is and always has been "I'm right and my child just needs to see things my way"
Anyway.
And "trying to fit somewhere and his trans friends embraced him" reeks of the whole "you've been corrupted" rhetoric
I have no idea what my brother thinks, that's my mum saying that's what she told him
I shouldn't have said anything.
Ryan is my brother, these are from my mum.


it *is* wine, even
heh.
So this is probably a good sign
I'm a believer in the "booze makes you show your true feelings"
Yeah, hopefully it's not just the booze
said she bought it for herself but it would look better on me
she just gave me this bracelet

uuuuuhhhhhh
that was fast
too much T, idjit
***no shit***
like
My mum implied I have a "hormone imbalance" that's making me confused
t h i c c

like if someone showed up talking about how much they wanted to fuck the banana noise I wouldn't go anywhere near that
I don't blame you
honestly if the birds are consenting I don't see a problem
where else could I possibly go to validate my racist AND sexist opinions at the same time
damn sjws ruining our vidya
I should probably change that to not do it
<a:PicardFacepalm:396333078534029313>
tbh I almost didn't wanna ask you to mod this was because I was afraid you'd have your hands busy with zelda shenanigans, but figured no harm in asking
I'm glad I figured it out before three more sets of antidepressants didn't work
It really was approaching another breaking point
I'm prying happiness from the cold embrace of the cosmos
And now, finally
Like, for years the only thing that kept me going was this firm yet nebulous belief that "things will get better, even if I have to make them better"
Too much to live for now
Like i said before
I don't plan on dying soon
Hopefully we'll have a lunar launch facility by then
also, they put pickles on my goddamn burg
goddamn. I'm not entirely comfortable sharing ***why*** but there's thought glitter all over my brain and it's really fuckin me up
I will take bite first before removing the hell-slice
when mcdonalds accidentally puts pickle on burg

So not *quite* anywhere that has an airport because they'd also need to probably have anti-discrimination laws in place too
Aircraft maintenance and repair
As it stands I'm mostly stuck for the next two years, but after that I'll be able to get a well-paid job anywhere that has an airport
I wish this area wasn't so expensive or I'd be considering moving out again
awesome
if so I can use regular <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

I'm going to avoid answering any questions about valk.
I'm going to avoid answering any questions about valk if I can, because once that can is opened...
`fuck I need a new reddit account`

<:YuiScare:442105076933459979>
I'm spooked
HMMMMMMMM
WHO MODS THE SUBREDDIT
RED ALERT
OH FUCK
oh
there's literally only 5 of us
small price to pay
but like at some point in the comments someone's gonna say something about valk so we'd be giving them exposure too
Oooooh I wanna answer a questionaire
the appointment is monday gosh
I didn't eat the pickles because I'm *not actually on HRT yet*
I just dumped another pile so I need to pick up as much as I can
that's because that thing left glitter all over your brain, and you're finding another speck of it
yknow how when you think of something and it makes you feel bad
sorry to interrupt but that's 1k
FUCK

I don't mind being busy tbh

***I*** want the attention
see, I'd like to think it'd get downvoted but `mainstream anime community`
I think a "XYZ users might want to start shit because [very brief recap], keep an eye on them" is all that needs to be said, while remaining open to probes
there are a lot of good points on all sides.
I'm honestly not sure where I stand here
so the exact scope was not being discussed entirely in private
but you and Alice were just discussing how much to say, in front of him
and then tell him after you reach a full consensus
but like, discuss the exact scope in private
"hey I wanna show off how awesome your show and your community is!"
"Cool, hey do you wanna tell him about *all* the shit or just *some* of the shit?"
"Uh, I'm still here."
I hope pittman likes all our dirty laundry

Yeah, I don't see how this is relevant to the "issue" I pointed out and was then clarified
Is all.
I'm not necessarily against it, but I just wanted to make you aware of the implication.
Their subreddit, their rules, their mods, but we're putting a non-zero amount of extra work
the last part seems like we're going to try to take an active role in the moderation

I think the last one was me
`we gotta look professional`
and the it's is still wrong
the capitals look out of place
replace Discords with "discord servers" and Communities with "communities"
I'd remove the parenthetical at the end of the middle block, and say something like 
```
Make sure there isn't offensive talk against the LGBT culture in the server, as there are a high number of trans individuals in our community.
```
its, not it's

can I just post that image with a <:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>

fuck the reddit admins
all just say it right now
can we like
Like I think we all hate the admins as much as you do
fuckinnnn A+
Do we need to add that to the internal rules
R, you're literally suggesting breaking the terms of service.
Fair.
<:NononPout:454088299963875349>
Because I would love to vote brigade on some bigots but I'd rather not attract reddit admin attention
I'm just confused as to why you're suggesting either "Do what we were gonna do anyway" or "Drown out comments with a fucking vote brigade"
I
Sorry.
That's fair.
`Kriisa stares into the camera like Jim from the office`
I'm confused what the point of this was
anything more than that is 100% against reddit ToS, deserved or not

This is a *thing we should be doing anyway*
but not before you were like "nuh uh"

*I'm a competent leader, I just needa bitch sometimes gosh*
July is a pretty great month so far
yeah like before I couldn't say anything, even when it would have actually added to the conversation
are you lifting the moratorium on bitching about valk when relevant
yeah I don't really see anything changing
`also he used the wrong you're like twice`
(probably)
because they're fucking lies
but he isn't
and has the capacity to prove those things
he's saying things
But also
`fuckin politics`
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
I hate tacit endorsement
I'd love to scrub them anyway but like, diplomacy
That's my vote
I'd say if he won't give you the logs then we scrub their listing from the subreddit
That would hit the same issue of creating a second game mode in a dying game.
and I don't think lucifer does NSFW
Even the fics that are posted are sfw, or at least not smut
I have noticed that, yes
Those two, and an Other box, with the ability to choose multiple options
Uuuuuuhhhhh
I'm worried about mob rule cornering us into something bad
That works, as long as we're the only ones who can see the results, just in case. As long as something dumb doesn't happen, we can release the survey after the fact as a show of good faith
We'd still get people having their own ideas, I'm sure
Open response, not multichoice.
In that case: a single-question anonymous survey where you can't see anyone else's answer would give us a way of gathering the opinions of people who care enough, while giving us the discretion to ignore stupid shit.
I think that a community opinion would be worth getting, but we're being overruled here
If you don't care enough to say something, then... You don't care enough.
Selection bias is probably in our favor here
And then we can discuss the popular responses
Survey is my personal vote
I think a post in the box is fine
How is a strict definition of nsfw decided in part by the community going to lead to `very bad ideas`
I demand that my right to say bepis wherever I want to remain intact
I've said the words bepis, penis and tiddy in many places
I'd say it's fine, but just barely
It was gonna be this big thing but no, group invite
Still mad that Boss ruined my speech <:NononPout:454088299963875349>
<:DMJii:458047433067200512>
Shush, let me feel good about being right

especially considering the incident yesterday(?)
Since we only have the one, I want to make sure she doesn't feel singled out by this sudden rule
no, the "post dikki to <#336297808221044736> "
I'm making sure that she's 100% okay with this, stand by
`I wouldn't mind having to post my stuff in the nsfw art channel`
```
honestly, considering that me and DL are so far the only people who hav posted nsfw stuff in fancontent, I feel like splitting the channel in two would be weird because then it'll be a channel mostly for just us, and that just makes me feel weird
```

I've just asked for her opinion
would be warranted
so I feel like asking her her thoughts
but Lily is the most affected
I mean, that's for everyone
Should I just ask Lily if she wouldn't mind posting her porb in NSFW, and her sfw stuff into fancontent?
It'd feel even more dead afterwards.
and you never followed up

<#357682999300718592> is now a SFW place! Risque images go in <#336297808221044736>, regardless of origin. Smutfic is still allowed in <#357682999300718592>, provided a warning is posted alongside your link.
four letters and then your link
it's EZ
I think an in-channel warning is fine regardless
boofable?
how's that

better exposure
and Lily's gonna be posting her art to NSFW anyway because of all the people that have fancontent muted
I think fancontent sfw is a good idea regardless
my upload is questionable
I can try

Honestly I don't look at NSFW too much past "is anyone being assholes in here"
I'll be sad to see it go, but you're right about the "no public hypocrisy" thing.
Fuckin creepos gotta ruin my DMJii smut, but it's for the best I guess
I've had objections to merging music and music-commands before but neither channel is used very often so that seems reasonable now
Bot testing keeps existing, i don't care where it is but you'll have to pry it from my cold dead hands
And he didn't exactly break any rules, so no action was being considered regardless
Which is exactly why I'm talking about it in here, because it's ambiguous.
I could have been misreading it, yeah.
Lots of aggression in the "well fuck my A-levels then"
they're being *awfully* antagonistic and as soon as they got backed into a corner, they immediately changed subjects
do we have previous incidents with Vali
`concern personified`
like I said
They did seem borderline obsessed
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
I'm suspecting fatherly meddling
freaked them out enough to *detransition*, at least partially
they're like 50% the reason I felt comfortable going so fast, the other 50% is me being a boss-ass bitch
I wasn't lying to Ry, by the way
`it begins`

I did <:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
I'm not going to be late but *just barely*
I missed my alarm so I don't have time to shave
*balls*
`is it the mafia thing or something else`
I was happy with the old setup but I don't have any reason to oppose the merger so <:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
as far as music
and Kirichan isn't used all that much here regardless
which is why I was against it in the first place, but the music channel is slow as shit anyway
Like I said, it was easy, I just forgot to do it
Go for it
Vali had a rough spot yesterday so I'm attempting the "kill him with kindness" strat
It sounds super fun
but we need to keep an eye on it, they've already done livestreams so it's imminent

That too
Really simple
Just run a single command to set music as the new default output channel for music shenanigans
but it was too relevant to not use
I don't particularly like it either
you're allowed to say that tho
it seemed relevant
I wonder if she found this same page while doing her research <:thinksgender:401602471035666432>
UCSF
" The estrogen receptor agonist activity of spironolactone may play a role in reduced breast development due to premature breast bud fusion. As such an escalating regimen beginning with low dose estrogen only, and titrating up over several months, and then adding spironolactone may be an alternative approach"
so it'll only be like a week or two
fat paychecks coming up
like I said tho
If I do end up needing to pick up some spiro too then yeah I'm gonna need a loan
I can probably call anyway, this is important
Bluh I have three clients tomorrow so my spoons are gonna be trashed

that's the little corner receding hairline thing
I mean, I've already started to get a widow's peak so yeah the finas, at the very least, won't be counterproductive
my platelet count is perfect <:plateletSalute:467756515579789342>
I got the results today
but now that I'm looking it up specifically, it doesn't really seem like it'll help
The only reason I didn't bug her this time is because the only time I saw finas mentioned in my research before was a brief little "this is another option" thing
so that's the real limiting factor here
it wasn't cheap
I really can't drop anything more on another non-covered scrip for a while though
Should I call her tomorrow though?
I'll be getting more bloodwork done after a month so we can see if it's effective on me or not, I guess
And a month.
And now I feel like I wasted $80.
She doesn't specialize, but she has a few others.
if it ends up not doing its job then we'll switch
<:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
My doc wanted to use it over spiro due to the side effects
whoops
I forgot to ask for a signup thing
Called my docs office, she'll be giving me a call later today when we're both between appointments
here's the drive edition

All ambiguity is removed.
3. Is another user reporting hostile activity that makes them uncomfortable of the offending user's presence on the server in places we cannot see?
but I believe that should read "another user"
if this wasn't an official document I'd let it slide
your wording in #3 implies that the reporting user is the one that needs action taken upon them

Drive also opens .docs and has the added benefit of no install + cloud storage
I've already done the thing
wait, I can probably upload it to drive
I don't actually have the ability to open .docs

oh is that a /k/ thing
If either of them complained I'd be tempted to do something
Yeah I mean I don't think Cast or Ghost care a single bit about someone who never talks
yeah I think that was one of the things we definitely agree on
iirc
that was a n-word not directed at anyone in particular, just an exclamation
oh
what are you trying to do
Like, *I'm* probably going to need a break, no idea how this poor kid is gonna hold up
***Two and a half hours of math***
Alright so this next client
Yeah I've got the BDs of the first 3 and waiting on YT's release for AXZ
I haven't even started on the Mafia bot yet, because it was `no spoons > egg crack > so many things to worry about > now I'm work-busy`
Why
Wht?
I dropped the ball on the finas vs spiro yesterday, that's my fault
My doc is pretty cool though, lots of explaining when I ask and it's all "here's a few ways of doing it, what do you want"
I've heard, yeah
I have actual agency
Which is super neat
But yeah she's willing to let me make the call if I want to start spiro earlier than in the study too
***no vore***
***no***
Less liver abuse and more unlucky
I mean i get drunk like once a month at most
So few months delay on the spiro, unless the finas just isn't working at all
My liver, while healthy, is on the low side of healthy and so it's a combination of the breast development findings and avoiding unnecessary stress on my liver
Got an update on the meds situation

<:DMJii:458047433067200512>
Sakimori is a good fallback though
Kirika will be much harder
Fug
Can I call dibs on Akatsuki Kirika
When is full release anyway
He's giving me a training budget to work on my physics knowledge for a new student, he's being so nice to me I nearly cried
I might also be away for Mafia tomorrow depending on the times, my boss is taking me out to lunch and giving me some physics review stuff to work on
Sucks that I missed it but goddamn do I need the work right now
So I'm taking suggestions
This is one bridge that I have absolutely no problem burning
But I also want to leave a "fcuck you" scrawled in crayon
<@127644949884698624> by the way I do really want to leave a scathing note
As Akira relapses into his drug habit and wastes away in one of Tokyo's dirtiest ditches
Into just stone cold silence and walk away
Does that count as self-harm
the act of subjecting yourself to only the parts Akira is in
I opened up with "I know the egg jokes can be shitty, do you want me, as a staff member, to tell them to stop"
He's okay with it for now and is empowered to tell ibu to knock it off
I've talked to scrmz about it 1-on-1
You okay latooni?
`the entire conversation he was calling me "son" by the way so yeah not gonna lose any sleep over 'losing' him either`
Or what a blatant attempt at manipulation that was
And I don't think he knows how wrong he is
My dad had the nerve to say "your mother hates you right now, so I'm all you've got left"
I think one funny part of all this is like
That one was pretty good yeah
I will for next game
I might miss the first couple rounds due to errands, and I'm also not a huge fan of Mafia but I'll probably play at least a one or two as a show of good faith
Whatchu want the explanation to say
Oh right
<a:WutChris:431361817009192962>
Done

That's my alt account I use exclusively for the stupid nadeko waifu minigame
I CAN BRING YUKINE CHRIS

Same tho
Very good stuff
I un-hoisted the Event role
If it's not "Latooni is a different mafia family" then I'm lost
`jester`
***oh my god***
***Did you put an SK in this game***
get that out of the way
she straight up said she's played the shit outta this
I don't understand why Ibu isn't instant-kill every round though
you need a critical mass of good plan times quality execution
*still kind of confused that my gambit worked*
gives people time to talk about the previous round
the breaks seem to be welcome, in fact
says 1:40

<:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
I have a slight preference to the original but for the sake of avoiding a stalemate and because my preference is only slight, I'll vote for the edits
no, it's got something to do with the coroutine not awaiting properly
no, the markov module keeps crashing her
Latooni was that sarcasm or a legitimate sunshine
By the way
That ping woke me up
GUN!
That's so weird
Is it linear, logarithmic, or random
That's annoying
<:ShirabeThink:461322366010654730>
Is there a volume difference from midi to maple
That sounds amazing
Which one
God, someone's pulling "both sides" in defense of *actual self-described Nazis* on another one of my servers
Perhaps?
Add in "suicide jokes" explicitly
Weird stuff is going on with discord admin, it seems
The ffxiv discord just got unpartnered for loli stuff
Speaking of, I'm starting to get comfortable with my voice as-is so hopefully I can start working on fine-tuning it soon
I agree with Latooni on this one, wholeheartedly
I didn't read the punched Bikki at all, mostly because I was in a slight rush this morning
High likelihood the images have 4chan urls <:ohno:400220431774121984>
I'm filled with so much "nya nya fuck you guuuuuys" right now

Lily is very interested in drawing us a Miku for November
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
I already have an idea for Shirabe's
<:KiriCheer:442974585529434113>
Oh do I get to draw things for DMJii's birthdays?
I ain't about to do anything stupid, I have *responsibility*
I have no intention of doing so without express approval from Alice which I'm like 95% sure she won't for exactly that reason
which is the *secret feature* I mentioned
I need to implement log storage on Shirabe first
NOT YET
<:CagPout:409092440478187520>
Sleek, not slick
Mostly human.
Efficient.
We need to be sleek.
one of my other servers has *eight*
the madoka server has like, six
and I will not participate in such
Bot bloat is awful and I hate it
But this has to be after Ryouko disappears. I only want three bots on the server, max
Kirika already has a built in "welcome" feature but having Maria do the other messages, specifically the "bot on/offline" makes sense
<:ShirabeThink:461322366010654730>
I'm actually completely behind this idea if it didn't go against my hard stance of "avoid bot bloat"
you want a Kanade bot for the express purpose of her being permanently offline?
because we don't have a Kanade bot currently offline
Kanade (But Working On Shirabe Instead) Day
tomorrow will probably be Shirabe Day
So that's nice
I feel like I wasted today because I didn't really do anything productive after staying in bed until 1400, but at the same time I don't feel bad about it, more just *rested*

oh are they talking shit about "not being able to take the heat" or whatever
This reads like autism, not the meme slur kind but actually
but not enough of a flag on its own
that one comment they made is slightly concerning
think they're a plant?
Kriisa status: full of sadness, but also understanding.
oh my god please PM a screenshot of that to him
and sparing use of the ping
you have the announcements channel
telling people "put up with our ping spam or fucking leave" isn't a good look
it's honestly pretty annoying

We're getting visited by Rihanna

okay, if you want to access the logs, your homework tonight is to download and install https://winscp.net/eng/download.php
~~mostly so you don't see the awful hierarchy on this server~~
so you ***can't*** fuck with anything even if you wanted to
I'm in the process of making a new account
actually no
but do you *promise* though
okay so either someone is gonna have to show me how to set up a web portal, or y'all are gonna get winSCP and promise not to fuck with anything
but yes thank you for making it explicit
By "anyone" I meant "anyone who can see this channel"
the latter is already what's possible so no change
because the former would be either really easy or really hard depending on how much work you guys wanna do
So, question. Do we want it to be accessible by anyone at any time or is "Hey saki-chan can I have XYZ log" good enough
If so, then I will. But if there's anything that would just clog it up, let me know
There's lots of things, not all of which are probably important. Do we need to log every time someone adds or removes a geah color?
<@!127644949884698624> give me a list of what exactly needs to be logged so I know what to work on
***Then*** we can shoot ryouko
```
Split Markov and Autosource features (because whoops I put them both in the same script)
Add error handling 
Write new scrip for logging
```
Yeah the order is
But it has an effect on the population, absolutely
I actually wouldn't even call it work, due to the connotations
Latooni and I do a lot of work having conversations with the other users. We may not run huge events or anything, but we are big parts of the day-to-day.
I'd like to go on record saying that I have a problem with R's attitude. I go to another custodian for that, right
you're claiming that everything that happens *ever* is because of you. that's textbook arrogance
that is *incredibly* arrogant
I don't want any extra work. if you wanna pingus wingus then fucking do it I guess
I would absolutely hate it
pinging everyone for a character's birthday is ***not useful information***
Alright so now I just have to sort out storage for logs and we are good to go
fun stuff, dess
Okay new Kiri feature took all of two minutes to implement

and the mafia channels too probably
those numbers might be low, add her to jackbox rq
jii_userCheck
`21:27:58 Message: "BOOF" was edited to read: "MEGABOOF" in channel: "desu-meme".`
and the date printed at the top of the file for good measure
Every day will have its own file, with the filename being the date
that's a list of everything I can log

<@!127644949884698624> I found a string method in python you may be interested in
WJAT
Like... Kill la kill senketsu?
Seems like a lot of them are finding it on their own
Should I just make an announcement for all the new people to look at role assignment
Now all I need to do is figure out how to format each entry and we're good to go
I've got a file structure set up, I think, and all my coroutines written down.
Yeah that's what I figured
Oh I misunderstood but permission is pending
New emoji for the server. Permission granted by creator
dess_liqu 4
dess_liqu 3
dess_liqu 2
dess_liqu
A simple command blacklist and then whitelist staff on top of it
Yeah that'd be trivial to implement
yeah
if a link gets posted it'll have the link as the message

Good call. I'll change the script. Embeds are just blank right now, shows a message posted but no content
thank you, forgot about that one
<@!127644949884698624> please run "dess_greetdel 0"

wanna hang out in voice or naw
cos latooni is mia
<@456226577798135808> WE GOTTA FREE SPOT
I'm not about to write a whole new bot for something Kiri already does

probably not on the last thing.
and do we want an image attached
And do we want it to be an embed, or a normal message
what do we want it to say
alright so
I'm watching the console for a bit to make sure nothing hinky happens
Shirabe's logs are now active
that's exactly why I wanted the quote deleted
the audit log *does* show that information.
nope
let me double check
Not that I can tell via the API
and enable a new user fancy embed with Kirichan
<@!127644949884698624> If this is satisfactory, I can bring this module online and we can ~~shoot Ryouko in her fucking face~~ kick Ryouko
In your defense, it wasn't you who cracked me even
I'm just interested in all this, and occasionally I make sure Alice isn't being a small child on Easter morning
üçø
there was like two beats and I just shouted ***WHAT***
I ain't gonna press the issue
I'm not saying that <:Eggimori:463997397392031755> is relevant again but it might very well be
When I have internet back on my PC I'll get right on it
I'd have some sappy response designed to make you blush if I wasn't so upset about my internet
Are we covering the OVA ED
Which one though
so yeah that's ggez if Boss wants to add it
I mean it's from the show I'm pretty sure
<a:KanadeLecture:433421456991453204>
there's also

so that's a thing we can do

Admins can give currency at will
Which is also possible
It's a command that each user manually runs at a set time
that's built-in
we can do a daily allowance with a time-locked command
the default Nadeko games range from RNG to kind of boring
the pattern ruins it



oh that sounds like fun

jii_reloadConfig
iirc
Kirichan doesn't respond to commands coming from other bots
It would be a placeholder that Maria could read as "add one ticket to this user's account"
I don't know shit about SQL
because just because my script runs on Kirichan doesn't mean it would have access to the database
probably, anyway
You'd have to buy gacha tickets from the Kiricoin shop
The Kirichan-Maria interface is honestly the hardest part
running to the door literally every time the bell rings
But Kirichan, the excitable one
I WILL TELL THEM EXACTLY WHERE THEY CAN SHOVE IT
TELL THEM TO ASK ME
IF THEY ASK FOR IT
any problems?
and after 3 you get a "you tried" token and you can cash in the tokens for specific cards
so you can get up to 2 dupes + the original
no awaken, 3 and 4
per card
there are three card arts
sqlite3 is built-in on python so this is hella easy
find userID, check currency, deduct currency
I mean this looks simple enough
that's what I thought it would be
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
102691114762371072 is mine
that would only give one
and since the userid's are unique
is there a way to get the primary key by searching for the UserId
mhm

so there's a table called DiscordUser
im opening it now
Kiri's done
>read current kiricoins from user
>if enough to purchase desired number of rolls, call roll function
>deduct kiricoins from account

>if not enough, tell them they're broke-ass bitch
>leave account alone
does that change anything
oh it's sqllite
because those are guaranteed to be unique
so it would *probably* be the discord user ID
I'm mostly self-taught on python, never touched sql
in what context
and handle it straight from there
I'd just read the DB
Yeah I think I'm gonna have to learn SQL
which I don't think we want
there's a waifu thing that you can spend Kiricoins on to ***claim*** other users as waifus
oh okay it's just for the waifus
dess_gift
sparkle and scrmz get Kiri bonus
but I'm actually going to give WFC a bonus on Kanades
I jest on that one
if user == sparkle then kiri.droprate -= .9*kiri.droprate
and then delete gachas as I phase them out
so I can have multiple pools up
ideally, a command I can run that can set up a gacha. possible drops, with individual drop rates in a (long) line of text
I'm going to write the system to make that as easy as possible
Mhmm
well yeah

remarkably well-named, too
is on Kiri's disk.
every single geah, every single memoria
well yeah a fresh turd with a Kirika printout stuck to it is better than xdu
maybe FEH-esque
nah I plan on making a game too
I'll add them in an update
Because I want to get out the units first
go for it then
<:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
R, you're going to manually crop *every single unit card in the game*
at least not initially
no memoria
which is like, an extra couple months while I figure out how that shit works
if the bot resizes, I'd have to use facefinding

a ton of images
it's actually
it's gotta be like, 2GB right
okay I'm downloading literally every image on their server to my host
<:CarolStare:336656462287994882>

SG-x00 Maria
what should Mariabot's name be
the original is a lil washed out so I touched it up slightly

kerrik might have all of the triads
instead of in-client
I could use my server so that users could look up their collection online
UI for the gacha and collection, that's another day
the SQL hook I'd devote another day to
I think I can get the gacha logic and backend done in a solid day of work
and the people who are crazy enough to keep stockpiling with clear out the gacha as soon as it opens
like, right now
the currency is ready to roll out
this is mostly my project so apart from a few resources y'all are free to plan whatever
thank me for deciding that this is Maria's purpose
if it works
and I'm going to be like, actually the bossest ass bitch in town
oh I'm so excited
and yeah like a +2 to the weight of all their character cards
and for the actual gameplay, I'm thinking every character would have 1 ability that all of their cards have, and then 1 ability unique to that card
The weights would basically be stars
weight 1 would get 1
so a weight 5 card would get 5 entries
so if you roll common, it will take all the common cards in that gacha, put them in a list with their weights, and rolls on that
every pull on the gacha, you have a (for example) 65% chance of getting a common, and 35% special. The rng resolves that first
every card has a weight (lets say between 1-5) and membership in either the common or special pools
hear me out
I'm thinking, as far as pull logic
every gacha has the core pool
common and special?
no worries I can always slap stuff together
and get me like a list
can someone else figure out what the various gachas were
I'm gonna be a goddess
oh man if this pans out
and yeah

(it'll be reasonable)
rateup on X character for the next Y pulls
that can be purchaseable with an exorbitant amount of Kiricoins
like okay these filenames make pulling the art ***super easy***
it's gonna be super minor
is that you asking for shirabe
R and outside get Maria
Boss, you get a Miku bonus
oh my god you're right
<:Kiricoin:473685957330206731>
<:BikiShock:447891354278821888>
I can do a lot with embeds and filtering, actually
I'm going to definitely have some load handling
I've been spitballing
anyway are there any issues on the MDD so far
yeah
I think it's just delete isn't it
is that even possible
all emote get *edited by Kirichan* to turn into Ver
every non-mod color is brown
too long
xdu\_ and mom\_ are both stronk
I could actually have multiple, and check for both
mom_
dess\_ jii\_ *what*
***WHAT IS MARIA'S PREFIX***
I actually like 22 hour daily timers personally
my other server has Bikki's allowance on 2hrs
yes definitely

this is the master design document
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dVW2aNh9cQtVJ4lHhrMn6Piq8bCTB-bXHU1TIzRun98/edit?usp=sharing
but that would be a few days because I've never done web hosting like that before
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Oh good that has a max
True but it's the spirit of the thing
I was thinking the tails side would be CAPE
I'm very excited about that
I flip between "forgetting it exists" and "remembering why I forgot it exists because it looks awful on grey"
I think we're at cap yeah
So two gachas to roll, one cheaper but no special units that rotates weekly and one more expensive that has possible special drops that rotates fortnightly
The first one would probably be two weeks for gachas with special pools, weekly for a common-only rotation
I second the "we love Boss" motion
Are offsite quotes even allowed
probably
Yeah thats fair
I will try
Oh but not being all vague and teasing about it kills me
Also from what I've heard about him I'm not sure I want him on staff around here? He seems very hands-off which is kind of counter to how we do things
Can I be the other keyturner on that missile launch
You jest but honestly that's pretty American
Like in a "reclaim it" sense or...
Wait what
That would reduce user numbers
<:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>
They have some good emoji we don't but I just asked Boss to rip them for me
I like it as a spectator but not enough to subject myself to actually being on that server
Oh jeez what's happening now
Her logging is fine, and markov is fine
Debugging is hard
<a:oof:447819226795999233> I think Shirabe's autosourcing is offline
Can confirm, me being goof
Twas fun while it lasted
I deleted the Mafia Winrate roll to avoid the hypocrisy issue
I'm sitting out of this one
You all know my feelings on deception and subterfuge
That little conversation has put me on board with `espionage and subterfuge`
Oh in case it's not obvious
I refuse to interact with him in any way outside of direct harm, and I don't really care to break the law so that's probably not going to happen either
It's also a felony, last time I checked
His little stats site is probably pretty susceptible to a DDoS, not that I know how to do it but hey.
I'm just gonna keep this on hand as a reminder of why Valk is a shithole
The initial interface looks slick on Firefox Android
That tagline isn't exactly enticing, but then again it's fairly representative of the game
Also apparently https://azala.info/static/index.html exists
I mean as long as you don't drag the rest of us into it I can't really complain
So that's 
‚úÖ `espionage`
‚úÖ `subterfuge`
What was that earlier about `no espionage or subterfuge`
Why were you going to do *anything* for them
Your hand would have to be in DMs
Implementation would be awkward
I wonder if a CAH discord bot exists
<:FerrisThink:465485767905640468>
I'm not stupid
I've already got a server, might as well
just a file host
chances are it won't be a proper website
unlike some people, apparently
and I'm really good at figuring stuff out
If I can figure it out
Definitely not
<a:AngryBear:427315058725486602>
Fuckinnn can I change my name on Amazon
Very much so
There's a non-zero chance it'll take forever
No, tell nobody about this project
So I'll be trying this week- shit I work Saturday and I'm going to be very preoccupied on Sunday-Monday
Apparently I can do it myself

The dump?
Time to think of an excuse to not stop by on my way across the country
So we've got a user outright saying they're manipulative and sadistic, and in my experience when someone tells you that ***you better fucking listen***
I have unity installed already, and an emulator for GFL
The "crack it open" part is what I don't understand
That doesn't tell me how to get muh waifu pngs
No wonder it drinks battery
It's in ***UNITY?***
I don't like being reliant on YT
Speaking of taking what we want, can someone figure out what I need to do to datamine the waifu png's from XDU
See before I thought he just allowed bad things to happen, but now it's clear that he's actually complicit with those bad things and thats a whole other level of "do I care about getting involved"
wait is tts enabled on this server
I wanna hear that now
dess
<@!127644949884698624> can you run "dess_qdel 59"
dess_qdel 59
dess_qid 59
dess_liqu 4
dess_liqu 3
dess_liqu 2
you mean that?
dess_liqu
dess_qdel 9
we moved it to Alice
oh I need to delete that
dess_.. Saki
the Jacq pool is *not good*
not that I expect that to happen
the *second* anyone tries to throw a slur in there, there's gonna be serious consequences
yeah, for now let him have his fun
like how often does dess_.. Jacq really get called
it's not really hurting anyone
If I do like the show I reserve the right to choose the character
Nothing quite so custom as Shirabe but you'd have a nadeko
Honestly I could just spin up another nadeko for you
It's global prefix
And the avatar
If you want her
But you've got Kirichan either way
Depends on how much I like the show
june 23 last year, damn
the images get posted to discord via other means
I can set it to generate a drop on message with a really low %chance, restricted to certain channels, and with an IRL time cooldown
obviously
and never myself or other staff
small amounts, relatively speaking
I'm definitely planning on throwing kiricoins at people because they're awesome
like IRL currency
nothing tied to currency
I ain't gonna tell a soul
I will sign an NDA if that helps
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
they don't let us buy the shit anyway
#civildisobedience
that's it
literally victimless
I meant literally
I'd definitely light a bag of dog shit on fire on his doorstep, ring the bell and book it
and I'm not comfortable having someone in a leadership position considering the same
I'm really not comfortable breaking the literal law that could get me fined or thrown in prison
but do we need to resort to *actual illegal acts*
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
consider what I think you considered
did you really
did
I didn't have an account back then, and my new account is newer than that
I'm well aware
quick survey
how many DMJii bots do they have on valk
wow r/symphogear, how come your mom lets you have *two* shirabes
and not run the log script
I can just make *another shirabe*
*checks logs*
so she's this server and only this server
she logs *everything she sees in the same file*
so here's the thing about Shirabe
*can I change the megaphone into a* <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
dess_qsearch Saki breakfast
you can get specific quotes
dess_qsearch Saki Kanade
dess_.. saki
that was less exciting than expected
shy-rabe
SHYRABE
can you tts shirabe like 10 times real quick
It is for me
oh lord
I hope not
It's like "hey you like watching football, you're not really a trans girl obviously"
I'm actually a little upset about how common the invalidation of cisgendered folks' identities seems to be if they exhibit even a little bit of these so-called flags
And just to be clear, this relationship is not contingent on any egg status
Good point
I think I was reading it as "this is a friend who really cares about me and knows I need a lot of validation"
I'm rather oblivious
Only vaguely
maryland, dc, what's the difference
`/r/flip_flappers, created by soiguessthisisit`
oh no that's Nakacon I think
is that the one in Kansas City
100% go for it
I've got your back on that, then
`NOT IN MY HOUSE`
`ABSOLUTLY NOT`
`NO`
the trick is to not push it *too* hard, we don't want people thinking they're being used
I hate *balal*
I know, just setting expectations
but it's pending on my enjoyment of the show
you'll probably get it
that was more a "don't necessarily count on my help on the community aspect"
but again that's worst case
bot maiden would literally be maintenance and troubleshooting only, I'm not 100% sold on the sole "lesbians" sales pitch (ngl I'm like 85% sold on it)
Best case: I love the show. I would love an active staff position on the flapper server

Worst case: I fucking hate it for whatever reason. I'll bot maiden for the price of an honorary staff position
and then have them do a symphogear watch of some description?
it's a strong selling point
anything else or just that
what exactly do these shows have in common
okay I'm gonna have to ask this eventually, feel free to tell me it's spoilers
<@99695384296701952> wanna drive a bus into a bunch of shitty gmod maps and steal everything
***OH FUCK I KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING WHEN I GET OUT OF WORK***
Ramraid thing
Wait the
Hm?
Godspeed you glorious bastard
<:plateletSalute:467756515579789342>
Yes, fuck me sideways
Did the dess thing crash
Fancy embed, no link, no dess_
Remind me when I get home to add that as a proper command
And I also don't like the implications of "hookup"
It's got nothing to do with the fact that we're both mods, it's just a coincidence
Mornin
So we're incest kink now?
***how many times do I have to say I'm not into the petplay*** <a:SayakaYell:393564307893518338>
I'm glad I'm not the only one not really into it
Anyone says anything even a little sad and a million <:huggo:405949421570883599>s pop up
That's validating
Okay now that
I'm only a member of one specifically trans place and I don't participate too much so I don't really know what, if anything, is going on
I mean, until like a year and a half ago I was in your shoes. My entire friend group was consisted of people who had at least one letter in LGBT except for Me
I'm really happy you found this place, for many reasons <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
That's unfortunate
Missed the boat on that one, Lat
<:whatsthis:439154029432668170>
So you got multiplayer working?
Why does it not surprise me that those two specifically like him
<a:headpat:453406859194269716>
Many thanks
<@127644949884698624> am I allowed to use MikuGay for heterosexual reasons
Didn't Miku talk her into it
<:MikuShock:391808765009068035>
Is it limited to 4 players or what
Oh I didn't even notice until it was pointed out
I'll be home in a bit over an hour
I'm still at work <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
There's nothing wrong with Crown Royal
Our date will actually take us on a fairly large portion of the 5 (aka I-5 for you east coasters)
He definitely doesn't realize at all
Headpat
No real way to do so, and it doesn't happen often enough to be an issue imo
one more and I really want to ban because I don't want people saying welcome to someone that isn't here
weird
10:14:11
what time is it now
the logs use UTC
yeah, just now
02:14:11 EpicGamer#9983 joined.
they were 7 seconds apart
okay it wasn't sub 1 second
can I ban
sub 1 second delay
there it is again
if they're not on the server
mobile does that
also no avatar
but a join and leave less than a second apart is very bot-esque
Also: if EpicGamer joins and immediately leaves again should we just ban
shirabe is at 1% now

<a:WutChris:431361817009192962>
I'm offline on my screen
<:SmugMira:403652815920168960>
Just as a warning
Latooni and I are going to be preoccupied this weekend
Oh cool
I wonder how many of my servers are public
What's mine
I wonder what Discord Inc is going to do about it
What possible reason would you need to know what servers someone is in that *aren't* malicious
Who the fuck even built that tool
Or he doesn't and R has some good ammo for a public pyre
Either he takes it down and the users are safe
Oh I actually love this plan
I have no idea how to access that information
word from god, job's done
makes sense
I mean if you see someone join, you say hello
<a:WutChris:431361817009192962>
Server widget isn't being used anywhere by me
The webhook was an attempt at the reddit feed, didn't end up working.
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Traffic on the 133 babe, I'm stopped
That seems backwards
Can someone give me a TLDR on why R was banned from valk and not the users spewing literal transphobia
What's their full response
I was just stating a fact that anyone who cares to stay unlisted would need to know
Did nobody care at all on valk, even a little bit?
like, his stalwart refusal to do *anything* is legitimately surprising to me
Also, I'm not sure why but I expected bingo to actually care about this
AHAHA BOT MAIDEN WINS AGAIN
<@127644949884698624> I'm not sure I want to read the logs if it's just R yelling at Bingo for hours on end
That was not for me
Your eye?
He got a kiss despite his best efforts, mind you
<:plateletSalute:467756515579789342>
Don't wanna be in menus
And I'm on the freeway
I don't think I asked for that one
server icon for the day

My self-insert
That's obviously Maria
Like, I take care of DMJii
100%
I'm the Maria, by the way
That's 7th
We've got Alice/Glitch, Me/Lat, and Kiri/Shirabe
Tonight on "Things That Were Said"
dess_. Latooni Hey Saki, I wanna try putting my Switch in your dock
so if you have Maria *and* Basa, no dice
anyone else will override with a no
and I'll set it up so that people with ONLY maria can post
except people with Maria toggled on
nothing can possibly go wrong
also for Serena's birthday we're changing every non-mod's name color to the discord night mode background color
<a:WutChris:431361817009192962>
like three times
I literally pointed at my screen and yelled "WHAT IS THAT"
THE PINEAPPLE REFLECTION
send it to me to touch up, I fucked with the colors a lot
also when you get the screengrab
when even is Serena's thing
no


oh that's amazing
yes it is
yes
<:mamidisgust:366003497105227796>
That shit ain't me

There has zero progress on sgx00-Maria
What on earth did you do
WEIRD

Midnight GMT? If that hasn't happened yet
What time do we want to swap?

What

I'll crop to face and add background if this is acceptable
As per 98: "she looks so happy and inviting"
***S H E***
Oh my god can we use
<@127644949884698624> did you ever send me the high res of Top Mom Maria

He left, but according to him it's only for the day because he's "pissed off"
I'm still thinking how exactly we can word the rule
I like rule 1 as it stands, but some clarification would probably be nice
Your announcement that the announcement has been announced has been noticed
I think Jim would know exactly why his image was deleted, if he asks I'll tell him but no contact will be made directly
About the image
Alice I literally said exactly those things to Latooni earlier
<:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>

Like that's way too on the nose to be an accident
Jim's post in hiero.
And at the ***worst possible time***
I gotchu fam
If you look further at wobbles' comments you'll find some reasons to keep a *close* eye on him
Exactly my thoughts
Yeah, that's the one
User comment on the issue.
Oldwobbles with the pedophilia joke in <#336297387863703552> but it was hours ago. Quick discussion about action requested, another few hours before possible action won't hurt anything
I'll check it out when I get the chance
Oh, right I forgot you sent me the code too
I'll look into doing that, that's the Nadeko part of Kirichan but I can look into a script that ***only*** does the names
oh that is
<a:baka:431319117463683073>
which I suppose is the point
it's a little tight but it fits <:Shrug:388950974817107968>
so I just found a choker that one of my exes must have left at my place

What's that say
One nendo, a 1:7 chris, a figma and some statuettes left
Three nendos down
`let me rebox my figures first`
I still have that pack from before
Let me rebox my figures first, I think
I was about to suggest that
Regardless, I appreciate the concern
You guys are a very important part of it, but you're not the only part.
Outside of the server, even
And I have a huuuuge support network
*twice*
Fun fact: I've done this before
Also, R.
I mostly want to burn time until they go to sleep so they don't see me packing
I could use another excuse to not start packing
R did you already crop that
I went from laughing to crying and back in 10 minutes
I'm *volatile* right now
He needed to stop. Fucking. Talking.
His parents aren't kicking him out for daring to express who he is
His parents aren't yelling at him about how he isn't a boy, how *deviantart corrupted him*, about how his voice is stupid and boys don't even talk like that
What the fuck does he know about "what he'd do"
It worked though.
Fine.
This is appropriation!
Since when do we prescribe to societal gender roles in this house
You don't have the right ID to be a mom though
I was just wondering if the position was vacant
Do we have an official Server Mom
Yeah, it's not a huge deal

I will uh
Top Mom
One might even say
What if I just give her Shirabe's lines
`oh my god`
I'll deploy it *silently*

Rambunctious one, she is
I just wrangle her
If I did I was wrong
I never claimed to make Kiri, I don't think
But then I don't get to say I made her <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
If it's python, I can fuck with it
A little reinventing never hurt, it's very satisfying
Oh?
I can probably get fancier with her
I'm learning sql so that's a lot more robust than the built-in arrays
Buuuut.
Python
Oh jeez
And add the ability to go down to 0.01% just in case
I'm definitely going to lower the rate

Why do some people hate fun

***yes, the floopflip***
Ripped off the bandaid and all that
Honestly the big part is done already.
I'm *around*
No clue as to what about
R just said we needed to have a Meeting
I'd want the threshold to be stated before agreeing or disagreeing
I agree on that basis.
I have no comment on whether or not R gets demoted at this juncture
I think there are valid reasons for and against the exemption, but I sit on the side of "it's valid"
I had no idea that was a thing you could do
Oh, good plan
As long as we keep using the pastel/bright theme I think it's still easily identifiable
Perhaps a pink for custodian? <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
We use bright/pastel for staff roles
Could use a different color altogether
Miku needs the purple
I'll give you blue on the other server!
Alice doesn't want green though
Blue it is
***IF THEY GET BLUE I'M TAKING THE GREEN WITH ME***
Boss, could I possibly convince you to bring the alchemist blue up to Custodian? It's much prettier than yellow.
<:SerenaOhoho:449358389563359234>
Latooni does, eh
<:Praise:391038800232448000>
<:JiiThreeSeconds:442974585650937856>
When I do, should I change her name to "ShirabeOS 1.1"
dess_.. Shirabe
Novelty has worn off. We need ***quality*** now
True.
I think the 1% is definitely too high
And we do currently
We should absolutely feel empowered to tell each other we're being shitheaded
I'm on Latooni's side here, do the two of us together count
I believe we're unanimous
Mostly because I can't make an argument for it besides "I'd like it" and you're all making excellent points
I concede my stance
I support setting a number, but I suppose that could be due to my bias towards structure and removal of ambiguity
Having precedent in place for if/when we expand the ranks is healthy.
`my wording was ambiguous. The rule, applied to us, for the users' benefit`
I think any rule for activity, quantified or not, should be for the users. So they know that we're around, that we care, and that we're doing things. Not to prevent any egregious mod action
If "keeping a pulse on the community" is the goal, I'd say three to four days at most, excluding extenuating circumstances like a short-term vacation, hospital stay, etc
To ensure the users that the highest level (notwithstanding the non-stratification of the mod roles) of staff are actively participating in the moderation process, presumably
He acknowledged as much when he got promoted originally.
Again, I can't remember exactly but it happened enough for me to notice
The reddit rules thing is the biggest issue there but there were a few small things that involved our server
Oh right, one of the biggest things. His willingness, near eagerness to jump straight into "lets do shady things and lie about them to get people to agree with us"
I left that server for a reason
If I'm being unfair, please tell me to sit the fuck down.
And yes, in his defense he hasn't waved his experience at us in a while
If Latooni remembers it, it was post. If not, that's pre
I think that one was post? I have an awful memory past "he got very upset and I was yelled at"
Then yeah. That.
Am I allowed to reference "he yelled enough on Valk, past warnings, to get banned," or "he flew into a tantrum because he didn't like the way you RP'd your own character," or "he's yelled at me, on no less than two occasions, over disagreements," or "he constantly waves his *incredible amount of experience* over our heads like that automatically makes him right"
R, I don't feel comfortable with you in a leadership amongst leaders position. At all.
You've yelled at me personally before.
Yeah and my boss was giving me a house tour sorry
I think I'd want to leave it up to her. You trust her implicitly, and I have no reason to doubt you on this.
It should have weight in the context of a bigger problem
<a:banningINTENSIFIES:415306394917666816>
I retract that one, you haven't done that in a while and you deserve credit for that.
Exactly why I asked.
May I counter?
One of my legs has a bunch of tiny red bumps on it and I really like my legs why does it gotta be my leggy
Oh no oh no oh no
Two hours?
I've been lying on my back in this bed for
Destressing
Yeah I've been
Because it already exists as a quote and it's a right pain in the ass to make those reaction embeds on mobile
So I can do that tomorrow
Right, turns out I need server admin privileges to make aliases
Fix what
Indeed.
And on my end, I'll ease back and keep professional.
So I suppose there's a non-zero amount of bitterness there, and I should try and keep that out of it
I just see all this "I'll get better" and I can't help but remember when he was first promoted and a big sticking point for `not me` was "prove yourself" whereas he got a big ol slap on the back and a "go for it, champ"
Was I being too harsh? That's been festering for a while.
I thought it was exclusively based on the private facts
Oh, I see.
I oppose the concept *slightly* but I trust you have good reasons
Just make the decision as the executive and be done with it
If it's an executive decision I don't see the point of discussion
You can't just say "... Things" and not at least say what they are
About how you've done a lot and it's appreciated
I agree with that last thing
For the record
**business time**, yes?
Anyway
Although those are always relevant I guess
No, not the zenbus
Kiri is still my favorite, but Chris is just ***so relevant***
I wonder how many people are gonna freak out that I'm not Kiri
I might use a Chris avatar soon
I'm back
So maybe not
That's a yes, now, except I'm literally about to step in the shower and I'm gonna be doin my leggys so that might be a hot minute <:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
What question am I answering
`I mostly want to get business taken care of so my euro friends will be around for the official promotion`
Then we can talk jazz
My availability will be sporadic for the next dozens of minutes but I'd like to try getting business taken care of
It's pretty good, all things considered
I'm settled (enough), I get proper pronouns, there's two lovely cats who won't leave me alone
Oh my god I needed that extra sleep so badly
How's Ashley treating you
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
Turns out I don't like boys but I ***really*** don't like scruff so it's a double whoopsie
Now it's every morning and that's not enough
I used to go full "fuck shaving" because I didn't give a damn about my appearance
Wow
Like I thought mine was fast but wow
Your facial hair comes in so fucking fast
Like a good boy <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I probably wouldn't have liked it because of the fuzzy face
Latooni didn't even try
No actual statement from him but
With Latooni as an implied 4th?
That's three no's already, if I'm not mistaken
I think we're missing the "We need a definitive reason to demote someone" fact that was brought up earlier, and nothing Alice has done since I've joined has made me feel like she doesn't deserve to be where she is
You haven't done anything worthy of demotion, as far as I've seen.
I wasn't aware this was up for consideration
The unilateral decision is the second chance option, the demotion is something we're discussing
I don't want him to feel forced into disclosure so... Don't feel forced into disclosure, R.
Or something else?
Same way we do current Custodian appointments, a vote?
I do want to give him the opportunity to prove his ability to keep a handle on his emotions, but I feel like that's something he should work on *before* continuing a "watching the watchmen" position. I say Illuminati for now.
Again, most of the time I think that lying to our users is something to avoid but in this case, if R is okay with the excuse then I'm okay with it too.
Right because some folks are on both servers
And as long as R is fine with it
Just mostly
Which isn't 100% a lie?
that's a good idea
@Color Me Kiri would be green
oh yeah, in the "here are the options" post
and for the supporting characters without obvious colors, if someone likes them they'd probably want to rep them regardless of color
Like, duh Kiri will be green
does the exact color *actually* matter? for most characters, the color will be obvious
<:FerrisThink:465485767905640468>
the Serenacon meme room is gonna be ***great***
I'd rather go with just "Kirika Green" if we're doing that
That feels way too long, but it's an option, I guess
Your suggestion seems to... sterile for my taste, but the "Color Me X" option doesn't actually say what the color ***is***
"Color Me Kiri"
Didn't even think about the Gungnir thing
The problem with that is:
The characters without relics, but who are still getting colors, are <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
So what I'm thinking is, the "rep everyone you want" will stay as-is, and the color override roles will be their relic.
Oh, I was under the impression that each individual moderator would have the option to have their own individual color, if they wanted
I guess a better question is, what bad things do you think would happen if we removed the unique staff colors. You'd still be able to *make* your own color unique, if you wanted, but they wouldn't be standardized.
Latooni, how strong is your disagreement
I personally think the hoisting is enough. We talked enough for the presence of the green to not be terribly jarring anyway
I'm not 100% sold on it, but I like it. Latooni's point is actually why I'm not 100% sold.
Alice's argument is that people know us already, and we're hoisted in the sidebar.
So you can definitely have it.
We're also (pending everyone else's agreement) going to be removing the unique colors of staff, and instead, staff members will be able to use whatever color they want, even outside the characters.
<@99695384296701952> Alchemist blue will be Elfnein's.
In addition, there will be extra colors for supporting cast.
I'll be adding a ton of color override roles so the users can have everyone toggled on but still have their favorite geah's color
Anyway, the World of Color project
Yeah, that shouldn't take too long to hash out
Where's that pic of Kiri with her hands up when you need it
`I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THAT`
<:SerenaOhoho:449358389563359234>
I'll be abstaining from this one
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
I wouldn't call Alice Boss if I didn't respect the shit out of her.
that would be overstepping, and I'm aware
I won't
<:Pout:400188180265041923>
*yes and it bothers me*
the little bar this is the best though, I wish we had something like that
I tend towards Genjuro because I like the way it looks more, and the pronunciation is still apparent
oh, thanks
I realized that soon after sending the message
got it
A58D51
discord only takes hex afaik
that's RGB
I guess paint but does that even give hex codes
I'm on my laptop and it will take me literal years to open any sort of image program
can someone get a hex code
what even is carol's color
good call
<:ThumbsUp:447148126583783434>
I don't think people can see the role list, can they?
*when is Serenacon anyway*
Maria stays at 3 until it happens
*no*
we're already pushing it here
Genjuro, Ogawa, Elfnein, Carol unique colors, and then Cag Praelati and Germain share a color?
that was "Main cast, and these others who aren't"
(Kanade is included in Main Cast for the purpose of this discussion)
and if there's demand for the others, we can add
I think maybe we just start with main cast, Genjuro, Carol, Elfnein, Illuminati, and Adam
which isn't a problem
just for the record
what I'd do is I'd write a basic thing for Shirabe so everyone who sends a message gets the Obama role, and then we'd delete the Obama role afterwards

IITS AUGUST 4TH
NO
on Obama's birthday we can add that as a meme role
oh are all three of them the same color?
Adam would be purple, but lighter than Miku methinks
Dark Greys are dangerous with night mode
although they get a big blue bot tag
I want the bots to keep a unique color
Carol, Ver, Adamu
Genjuro, Ogawa, Elfnein, Bridge Bunny
I'll get to work on the list then. What non-protags get colors?
So we're going with "Color Me X" then?
Also I'm planning on writing the script to make any role starting with "Color Me" to have their mention capabilities either removed or added, so we need to keep that phrase exclusive to the World of Color roles
Are we making a "Color Me Custodian" and "Color Me Illuminati" now or was that a "if we decide we need it" backup plan?
Several hours from now
Welcome back
We can roll it out tomorrow night when I get home from work
And I'm pretty sure bots can edit roles, yes
I already agreed to the Maria thing I thought
I'm pretty sure just the ones that I added already, and Ogawa but I don't think he really needs one tbh
I don't blame you, have fun <:madokawave:366003510010970122>
She's `busy`
Do what you wish with anyone Miku or lower
So she'll probably be busy
Iirc Lyssa will still be there for a bit afterwards
You could flip the frown into a smirk
<:Shook:417170289697226752>
***GOHAN TO GOHAN***
Chris doesn't dess
I'm surprised they haven't said anything
Oh I just noticed Ox changed colors
<a:MariaBlush:448756431785820171>
:nani:
*spikes sword into table*
***"SAKIMORI"***
I want it to be like, an entire wall
Also unrelated, where can I get a flag bigger than 3'x5'
Hosting an event that a) rewards Kiricoins ***AND*** b) prevents the host from participating should definitely be rewarded if the host so desires
I thought you might like that one
I think so, R
I'm planning on being mostly hands-off with the Kiriconomy but if the invisible hand does dumb shit I'll intervene
Also Kiricoins are specifically emoji and the small flip icon, not sure we need an HD one but if you want to make one I can update the flip icon when I get my PC back up and running in a month and a half
R I'm going to release more stock and buy them myself specifically to prevent anyone from enacting a hostile takeover
The waifu game will forever and always be disabled on all of my Nadeko shards
R, it's not the same if it's not a proper cape
There's a reason I'm using the term Kiriconomy instead of the more sensible economy
Yeah I mean if a ton of people like it we just, keep that one
Except we're actively watching out for it
So good
I'm sorry that's just
dess_. R YA WANNA DO IT? YA WANNA MAKE THE KANADE CRY? SHE'S ALREADY A DEAD LESBIAN, YA DON'T NEED /SAD/ DEAD LESBIANS ON YER CONSCIENCE.
If there's shady business going down with the Kiriconomy we can deploy the Shirapolice
You already can
All is right with the world
***PURPLE ALICE***
And we're gucci

Use `dess_iam` followed by any of the above to claim your color! Do note that any "Color Me" is mutually exclusive to any other "Color Me."

Ex: `dess_iam Color Me Kirika`
<@!127644949884698624> I'm ready to make the change but you're the only one who can remove the color from Custodian.

```
Have you ever been annoyed that you can't have your top three characters selected without being green? Have you ever been puzzled by the fact that we don't have Carol? Are you concerned by Discord's lack of horizontal hierarchy? Well, with the World of Color update, the first two problems have been solved! Still working on the last one. Check out #role-assignment for the new commands.
```
Yeah that
NB: AngerDess not AngryDess
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
Okay Doxe is Carol, scratch that plan
I love it
Nice
Oh okay
Because I don't want to set up a dev environment on this shittop
I'll do it manually this time
Something something M Bison
cape is live, I added it to you <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
The overrides are so you can freely choose a color
Those are staying so you can have more than one girl
What duplicate
<:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>
I used it right before that
Yeah Miku is deeper
You can use it too <:NononPout:454088299963875349>
dess_color 605E96
Get a 10% lighter
Run it through that one color conversion website
Still dark
dess_color 2E2D48
If there's nobody using Color Me Carol by tomorrow night, I'll swap to it
Make it a different color and we can `talk`
I still think black names are dumb
You can keep substituting with a curtain but it's just not the same as a cape
I'm honestly thinking that if Hazel was nicer about it then none of this would have happened
I posted that one "The Evil Is Defeated" screenshot and everything
Very.
Langou was the last one, I think
Imo
If it's starting to end in moderator action more than once or twice a fortnight, that's when we should reconsider
Once every now and then is fine and expected with that kind of channel, and I believe it's worth keeping around for venting and education on more serious matters
This is the first one in weeks
True. Public action does help as far as user opinion
But then shit like the Saki Saga makes it worth having
Definitely have to frame it as "we're definitely not victim blaming here but you were incredibly antagonistic right off the bat"
`honestly I wonder if she'll be more receptive to me now that I'm out as trans`
So any "talking to" will be met with incredible hostility
Which I hate because if anyone on staff disagrees with how she handles things, she treats it as a disagreement with *her*
She really likes to go straight for "lets say shit that makes people upset and then spam the thinking emoji afterwards"
I'm willing to bet it was a case of "oh forgot that was there"
4) Pop posted a trap card parody with "nigga" on it in the middle of the whole shitshow, should I talk to him or just delete and move on
3) fuck Yorin.
Fuckin okay, read through the thing. 
1) I know pretty much nothing about the I-P conflict so I have absolutely no idea what here is reasonable and what isn't 
2) I think Hazel really needs to work on how she talks to people who she disagrees with because, yeah, the first thing she said was "I'm gonna deny Israels existence I think" to an Israeli which, while it may in fact be justified, isn't going to do anything except be inflammatory.
No easy way to do that with Nadeko because of how prune works
Use dess_prune, obviously
.prune @Someone removes all Someone's messages in the last 100 messages. .prune @Someone X removes last X number of 'Someone's' messages in the channel.
Pretty sure you can ping someone to delete their messages
She's got a prune but be careful with it
Godspeed
I sure hope he did
I don't like the arrogance in that statement
She likes to jump straight down people's throats and then "muh tone policing"
Honestly I'd rather she didn't come back
The situation is slightly different, but I'm not sure she will or not
Hazels is with a couple users
Jacq's problem was with moderators
It'll be a delicate situation
So what do we say when she does come back
Something to do with emoji
Lobsters are a trans icon now
Oh is Vali the Ibu-friend
In the slightest
I'm telling you, she wasn't following rule 1
The I-P thing is something I'm very uninformed about
I have no idea
He might have deserved it
Now
Solo didn't pull the "I live here so you don't know" card until after Hazel kept assaulting him
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
`Kiri in her green hoodie for the aesthetic`
`Me, wearing a pink jacket in 95 degree weather for the aesthetic`
I'm loving this already
`Cinnamon Toast Crunch`
If you're asking me specifically to read something then I will read it
Oh what that's not fair
But normally I just, don't
I read Boss's first one because she explicitly said that it was fluffy yuri, and her second because it was coming straight from the heart and she wanted me specifically to read it
No offense <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
It's not something that I do
I generally don't read fanfiction
Gonna be rocking Igalima Chris until the fateful Monochrome
Yeah I know, sorry <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
<@127644949884698624> I need confirmation that you bought that DMJii doujin ASAP because my heart can't fucking take this

Like a hour ago
Trailer for Risk of Rain 2 just got released
`YOU'RE IN FOR A WILD RIDE, SON`
<:KiriCheer:442974585529434113>
*wraps your ashes up in a cape, squeezes, and a brand new R pops out*
The workshop has EVERYTHING
Solos doing what on valk?
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
I thought
O-oh
YES YOU CAN
YES
Of course not
Petition to rename it the mistress bedroom
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
In other news, we put in applications for a 3br *and I'm getting the master*
Yes R, you were right
<:NononPout:454088299963875349>
Us not being professionally trained therapists doesn't necessarily preclude us from helping, he just. Doesn't want help.
So yeah, asking him to stop drunkposting is probably the best way. Everyone else just gets brought down and he is *clearly* nonresponsive to anything anyone says
He uses voice to text, rather often
More WFC drunk sadposting
I'm in between appointments now, fuck what did I miss
It's symphogear discussion, the only other pin is a countdown
Fuckinnnn pin it
Sometimes it's hard to remember that
Thank you
I'm not arguing for him to stay, or that I wanted him here. I'm arguing that factoring in "he's useless" is a dangerous rhetoric
But they'd have to break a rule for me to action that
If someone is a nuisance and useful I would also want them gone
Someone being a nuisance, sure, and that's why I wanted him gone
So if someone is useless, we shouldn't want them around?
That's very close to the "people are only as good as they are useful" ideology that I'm running from
I'm uh
Oh the one message from solo
Is that what's going on
DMs presumably
I have problems with Hazel but that isn't one of them
And yeah the nuance is, he was trying to shut down the discussion and Hazel was calling him out on it, not saying he couldn't say anything
Parm probably wanted a public spectacle
Got WFC to talk to me in DMs about the sex thing, he's stone cold sober
G4Y
And I've got it installed on my laptop
You can probably get her involved
Elise loves tts
It's fitting to go from the submarine to SONG HQ anyway
I'll be around and on Vals Corner in a bit
<:ShirabeEmbarrassed:278546061755154432>
That being said, I've got a couple more appointments today so ping me if anything is super urgent that needs my attention
Go relax. We've got this.
I was ***working***
And again
That does not preclude us from helping
I did clarify with "professionally trained"
She's in the same boat of "doesn't talk too much"
Lauren is straya m8
Kerrik, Outside, and Fergus come to mind as "EU names I know off the top of my head that aren't controversial"
We should definitely look at other candidates
I'm just emphasizing how much I think this is the wrong move
I know
If you want to nominate them, you're gonna have to pull the "server owner" card because right here, right now, I can't agree to that
Latooni brings up a good point. The one time I've seen them involved (if you can even call it that) in an argument they're invested in, she bailed.
And from what I've seen, I don't think Parm is anywhere close to ideal. At least not yet.
I'd rather keep our eyes out for an ideal candidate as opposed to bringing someone on board just because they're *convenient*
I absolutely do not agree with this nomination.
They don't participate much in discussion, either, at least that I've noticed
I haven't known them for more than two weeks, and what I have seen, is that they just left without any attempt at clarification
I'm gonna absolutely veto that
*raises eyebrows*
Hence my opinion that we do, in fact, need a euro-timezone moderator
None of that would help because the entire thing went down while all of us were asleep
Especially considering the temporal dislocation
So what action do you propose? I don't think an announcement is warranted here
But perception is important
I think that *acknowledging that Israel has done some fucked up shit* is not bigotry
I seem to remember that happening
Didn't solo specifically state that since she's not Israeli, he's more Jewish than she is
There's some extenuating circumstances here, they both seemed to want to leave because they didn't get the usual "oh I'm Israeli so I'm automatically right on everything about I-P" treatment
Oh are you trying to warn the bikkibot from Vals Corner?
Iirc
If you're not friends, and don't have a mutual server, you can't be DM'd
I'll be around all day because no appointments
Okay well, I'm gonna take a shower, ~~resist the urge to tear my chin off,~~ then go get lunch
Wilco.
Freshly served by Kerrik

Here's the gif

I reserve the right to joke about it here, and on Vals Corner
That's fair
But grumble about it
I will respect the tradition
`fuckinnnnnn he's MY DOPPELGANGER`
Well, it's only 2000 for him and he stays up late
Putting my neck on the table for this one
I know him, and I will personally vouch for him
But scrmz is basically smol boi me
Boom
And then invite them
Then I send the candidate that image of bikki getting cuffed
We make a group chat, just us
Okay I have an idea
That being said, shall I contact scrmz about this or do we want to talk more about this decision
He had no issues telling people publicly to knock it off about him and Ibu, so he's got some level of "knows how to impose his will"
He's also *very* responsive to my advice so we could work with that one
He's a little new to the whole "this is an accepting community" thing, and he's careful. Could impact the way he feels empowered to shut down arguments like that
Like, couple weeks ago
He just turned 18
It would be unfair if we didn't
That's the pros, we need to consider cons too
And he already moderates another server
But yeah I really like scrmz, I think he's got a solid handle on the rules, he's EU
I was just throwing out EU names
I believe so
Yes
<a:oof:447819226795999233>
Or were those sent out of necessity rather than convenience
Latooni, are you in a position to talk about scrmz as a candidate now
Okay, back to the earlier discussion
That explains a lot
<:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>
I missed that
Wait is bingo a fundie?
Thanks for bearing with me
***I AM A FOOL***
Even if I decided I suddenly liked dreads I'd never have them myself because of the reasons stated... Because I understand the context and significance
I didn't actually think about it that way, and ironically that's one of the reasons why I'd never consider wearing them, apart from the personal dislike
Paraphrasing myself slightly
Scroll up, I said "If you don't understand and appreciate the context, don't wear it"
Alice, I completely agree with that
Or do you mean the systemic kind
See, I thought "you can't deny someone the ability to do something based solely on their skin color" was how we fight racism
This is why I avoid talking anything even close to politics on the internet, I don't agree with everything and suddenly I have no empathy.
And I belong to the culture by... Being white.
`did I say something wrong`
I don't like prejudice, in any direction. If you were talking shit about a minority I'd be just as vehment. Just so happens that I'm white here.
*deep breaths*
And yeah, a lot of white folk probably won't understand or appreciate the cultural significance.
Saying "don't wear dreads because you're white" is not
Saying "don't wear dreads because you don't understand or appreciate the cultural significance of them" is fine
I don't even know why I'm arguing in favor of this, I hate dreads, but if I don't defend them then who's to say a hairstyle I like will be on the no-fly list next
For that, I apologize
And I should have specified in my initial statement
That's why I like to differentiate personal vs systemic racism
Anyway, that's my opinion and I know most of the left would fucking kill me over that, but there it is.
The *system* does vastly favor us as white people. There is no systemic racism against white folk in this country. But if a black man thinks all whites should die, that black man is racist.
It's hardly worth discussing, but I think that it's important to realize that *minorities can be racist too*
And I'm not *actually* offended
It's not enough to get up in arms about
Racism is bigotry based on skin color! There's "systemic racism" but personal racism can, and does, exist. Saying "you can't wear that hair because you're white" is absolutely 100% racist.
They're probably being an ass though, yeah.
For all you know they could be wearing them in solidarity. I know that's probably not the case, and they're probably wearing them because they're "cool" and yeah that's awful. But to write off a hairstyle based solely on the color of a person's skin is outright racism.
Hell, I'll be watching for that too
But saying "you can't have dreads because you're white" is kinda rude
I just, hate dreads
***I WOULD FIX IT BUT I'M A LITTLE -NOT HAVING A PC WITH MORE THAN 2GB OF RAM-OCCUPIED***
Looks good to me
Doesn't show that you edited it
dess_.. Vacuum
Also it would be remiss if I didn't bring up
It looks great except for the ending
Did you run out of characters
>so if you have an issue
Yeah rule 3 has been neglected as of late, but it would be good to make any amendments/clarifications at the same time as a reminder
That's a good solution for solo
I'll stop engaging in that stuff, and keep an eye on it when it pops up. Didn't know it was an issue
I personally think it can be once he wakes up
<@!127644949884698624> scrmz is going to bed soon, it's either now or much later tonight
I feel like my disinterest with fanfiction makes me the last choice but if nobody else will, I could try
Boss is incapacitated for the moment and Latooni will be home from work at some point
Isn't it just "post prompt, accept responses, yell at people to discuss them"
<@456226577798135808> <:madokawave:366003510010970122>
R seemed excited though
And I want him to settle in before his first night shift
Alice already said she wouldn't be around for it
How long are we willing to wait until everyone is online and available simultaneously
We need to bring him on board sooner rather than later
Looks like tomorrow morning
Latooni is 90% probably asleep
Now, or morning
Scrmz is awake
Alright
We all enjoy the words of Boss
kinda shit timing, if you ask me
I just checked it
No like, it hasn't been used
That chat hasn't been used since we moved to symohogis
Wonder where that's going
I like at the bottom of that, bardiche is saying something about how they're a "small portion of the population"
`the thing that is the title of the server`
Am I the only cag
Awesome
Oh really?
Fucking *balal*
He got it
I'm clarifying
Emphasized that hiero is strictly sfw
Kerrik, I talked to him
I'm gonna keep this for a while I think
Also I fucking love this Cag turquoise
*no pickle*
I'm gonna miss her
I love my doctor so much, she's great
Switching to spiro, and 2mg estradiol
Just got done with my doc
I think once we have a >50% staff availability level I want to pull the trigger on that confetti gun
jacq's on a roll of *foot in mouth* today
***eventually!***

You got your role, what else do you need
`I can continue to avoid the pickle`
Roasted peanuts *also* have salt
I just realized
<:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
True
Okay, I think the next time we have
A) One custodian
B) Two other staff members
C) Scrmz
all online and available, we initiate onboarding.
And you acknowledged it
Alice said that
Unless theres another
Situation might change, if I end up in Denver it'd be closer to Sept 15
As it stands, I won't begin work until Oct 3rd
Single monitor, 2gb of ram, noticeable delay on literally everything
It's pain to do anything on
I try to avoid using the laptop as much as possible
Not even a little bit
and my text tone is the chant from the start of Ressou Gungnir
my ringtone is the first chorus of Dangerous Sunshine
Well you didn't get any calls I don't think
no background, no ringtone, nothing
0 customization whatsoever
oh yeah
Mine is boring but functional

nice keyboard, by the way
<:KiriCheer:442974585529434113>
it's a shame I don't believe in pre-emptive strikes
if he breaks any rules I want him *out* because he'd likely just feed on the warn
I would very much like to skip the warn-kick part of our escalation procedure due to extenuating circumstances surrounding this user
I agreed with you
if he steps out of line I want to just ban and be done
I don't even know what to do
I
hoooooooly fuck
but I can't say I blame them, considering the warning Ibu gave us before vali showed up
I have no idea who that person is
Yes, scrmz
<:KiriCheer:442974585529434113>
Headpat
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
No it's just this persistent thing in MMOs and it's slowly driving me insane
Yeah, and the tech for "hey lets give everyone a UUID not tied to their name" has existed for way longer
They're a relic of a bygone era of bad database structure
Unique character names are absurd in [current year]
*rolls eyes*
So is this happening or not
Then I can do it <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
So if you have him on your list already then you're gtg
And I know a lot of people forget discord has a friend list
You need him onnyour friend list
Let me know when you send him the image and I'll invite him to the group chat
It's literally pinned
What image
Fuckin maplestory
3 staff members + scrmz
I'm sitting at a restaurant with like 2 hours to burn
Godspeed
Oh did they give the 1hr warning
Despair
Are you still vibrating
*a faint buzzing is heard down the hall*
I wonder if anyone's gonna be like "wow he was talking shit about riling us up and he hasn't said a word since"
Rip
How many names can you reserve
And the night shift is slow, as I'm sure you noticed
We just need someone who will probably be handling night shift stuff while the rest of us are sleeping
Scrmz, you would have been brought onboard like two days ago if not for the requirement that Latooni send you the gif
And you have a special *fondness* for tradition
Boss, you're the Boss
Traditionally, it's Boss's job to appoint the newbies
Did I write Latooni's
And yeah I'll be working on a game for Mariabot to handle too
With a better markov
Also Shirabe will be getting an upgrade to ShirabeOS v1.1
SG-x00 Maria. Round out the trio, and all that
And it's going to be used for an XDU replacement game gacha
***secret emoji***
<:Kiricoin:473685957330206731>
SG-x00 Maria
THE excuse you
We've been slowly cutting ties
Probably not
So I dunno if they have any feelings towards me
I left quietly a month or so ago?
Valk feels like 4chan sometimes
I have no opinions about /sgg/
***fuck valk***
pinned messages are important
Also bot-testing is MY HOUSE
I ain't doin shit
YES
<a:PicardFacepalm:396333078534029313>
***astute observation***
***yes we do***
I got to keep all my friends
Oh really
I hadn't hatched yet so more than 1.5
Ish
<:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
I told him already
Kicks do basically the same thing
We haven't seen a need for that
Not at the moment
Sooo?
This is why you run announcements by me first
And Europe and Australia are proper nouns
<@99695384296701952> you missed a D in "discovered"
Mhmm, I get that one
Shame Prelati is the pink but, what can you do
Turned out great regardless
That's what I figured
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
<@127644949884698624> why did you pick this color for cag anyway
I really hope so
The base Kiri color is the other shade of green on her tie
And I handpicked the color for Illuminati based on Kirika's tie in AXZ
I'm digging this turquoise though
We *might* end up needing to go back to staff colors
You're free to keep your Kirikolor for now
This was "we fucking need one right now"
Yeah but it was always a "we could probably use one"
Don't go lettin me down, ya hear
But like I said, I personally vouched for you to the rest of these folks so
The one thing was enough to get our asses in gear
4 days before mine
Sept 13
It's pinned
`symphathizer`
Oh is that timeline quinn's
You need server admin permissions
No, you don't
But I needed server admin to set one up
And then I rediscovered last week
I knew waaaay back when but that was when I first started running her on Vals Corner
Or rather, I had forgotten
Yeah I didn't know nadeko had them
You can trigger *actual commands* via reactions
kiri, mate, toss us the timeline and a can of VB
I have discovered a new Kirichan feature
So maybe
Gmod is old as fuck
I wonder if laptopchan can run Jazz
The offbrand I bought are peanuts that were roasted adjacent to the honey
I desire honey roasted peanuts
That was fast
Real life > server shenanigans
R also brings up a valid point
headpat
From the sounds of it, if you left now it'd go completely to shit
God that's a lot of traffic
Benefits of being a fringe show, I guess
<a:oof:447819226795999233>
`yes R that's the joke`
and also it's going hella slowly
because glaciers are the source of lots of rivers, and we care about sources
`Operation Glacier` is the wiki
I only have like, three secret ones
***Kerrik needs to know which project I'm working on dammit***
Because Airgetlam is an Irish relic
So the SG-x00 Maria project is officially codenamed `Operation Irish Springs`
needs like, four punctuation passes
execution is alright but it's ***rough around the edges***
I'm being too harsh
good concept, *awful* execution
trans!Tsubasa x Maria
yes
talks sometimes
she's one of our users, nice girl, from straya
It's a good concept but apparently "several people" have read through it and nobody thought to say anything about the 410 billion punctuation and capitalization errors throughout
So Lauren has been asking me to read a thing of hers, and I finally got around to it
As is Operation Higher Education
Operation Irish Springs is on hiatus
I'd argue for "Walyssigi"
Making Lyssa the Waluigi
`Everyone is here!`
I was in the middle of a Casey run whats up
<@!127644949884698624> <a:WutChris:431361817009192962>
good call
I should probably take my meds though yeah
noooo I'm not tired yet
*okay I was about to freak out like* ***how the fuck did scrmz get in here***
so jazz is reasonable
<@456226577798135808> so laptopchan can run portal 2 at a actually stable framerate
A little bit of brevity wouldn't have hurt
Considering the thing I was responding to
And there's nothing offensive in her best of
Shirabe didn't say anything new
I have faith it's good
I didn't bring my headphones so I can't listen to it but
Unlike Pluto is good shit
The pianist is a little too outwardly angry for them to be my standout favorite
Boss, I thought you liked the singer
I like the bartender and the pianist equally
If I get sponsored by Ty Ku that makes it a saki sake socky
I want like, eight different pairs of various colors but that's a wonderful start
Oh what
Latooni and I are in SONG HQ btw, if you wanna join us
<@!127644949884698624> when
R's giant modpack
<@!127644949884698624> are jazz is thing?
What's the theoretical max players anyway
If y'all are still playing when I get home I want to see how well laptopchan can run it
Agreed
Does the rest of the server even know about this
Found it
<:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
Craft supply store?
I've got like three hours to kill soon, and I'm not hungry, so where can I get one of those measuring tape things tailors use
<:papikaHole:241350705875517440>
I'd say that you're the lucky one for getting the opportunity to see me in said socks
And he continues to miss the point that this isn't the "simple basic code" that he seems to think it is
He's going in way too hard for this to be anything but "this guy agrees with me but he's being criticized so I have to defend him and by extention me"

Sharing socks is ew
You're still not allowed to try on my socks first, buy your own <:AngerDess:448761344104333312>

Why you gotta do this while I'm working
But yeah next weekend is shaping up to be a Good Time‚Ñ¢

you can say "me" or ping a channel
I'd <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209> but I don't read them anyway so my opinion doesn't matter
Perhaps
Something about an alarm in the submarine
And make them actiony, apparently
There you go, responding to feedback
I was actually going to suggest that yesterday but that's a lot of words to type while driving and then I forgot
Yes
Chris B-side, G
I'd like to hammer out design before working on the code anyway
Indeed.
The economy is actually important to discuss at all stages
Feedback can be half a roll
Because that's a lot of effort
I feel like submitting a fic is worth at least 2-3 rolls
But power of 10 is easier on humans
I'd *really* like to go with 128 because power of 2
Because power of 10, and not too big
I wanna go with 100
+1 Kiricoin if Kirika is your protagonist
you should write about the Cult of Andrew Hussie

Oh I want him to ***suffer***

I was a keyholder at Radioshack for like 2.5 years so I'm not completely useless
Dividing it as you go is waaaaaay easier than dividing it all at the end, and yeah it makes giving change faster
You keep it sorted, its not hard to dump the quarters in the quarter box and throw the bills in the relevant sections
Lots of times
Nearly 24
This kid, I swear
Not reading anything
Is bread just
Yeah I figured, stupid psychology
I feel like every person I know who's said "I don't see the point in getting offended by jokes" is male but that might be confirmation bias speaking
Iirc bread was the one who wanted to shut down the rimworld thing because they didn't want to see it
That was actually pretty cool

Who also happens to be slightly diminutive
Yeah I'm like 3 months older than you
Yes

Sounds like you're just not cut out for academia, which is fine. I'm not either.
I have basically zero tolerance for academic misconduct. I took my fails and my wasted time, and you somehow think you deserve better?
Because I didn't deserve to pass them.
I mean I've failed a couple courses
Sometimes I think I'm literally the only person who's never considered academic misconduct I swear
<:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
College and uni are synonymous here, but they're different in Britain and the commonwealth
To use British term
He's in "university"
Playing the system against itself
That's pretty extreme
What really
That'd be a fuckin twist
`rips off mask to reveal it was me, langou, the entire time`
gun?
Flips it over and flaps a paper on, maybe? For the wordplay
<:ChrisUwa:273453566746820608>
Or... Not go to classes because you can't pass them.
If I had cheated in my history and english classes, I'd be an engineer right now. You deserve your goal future more than I deserved mine?
Are you working in the framework that a college education is absolutely necessary, because it's absolutely ***not***
Doesn't give you a pass to cheat.
I haven't dared open it
Don't let them
yeah that would definitely depend on how much the place is
O-oh
Hopefully sub $800, which for a small place won't be too hard to find as long as I'm not like, middle of Denver
then yeah I'll be Colorado bound
about a week
and unless they somehow manage to lock down an address in Michigan in...
Remember, I'm most likely going to be alone in Colorado at this point
but I'm willing to go for wifi if that's not feasible
yeah ideally the router would be next to my PC, and I have a cable
but I'd rather not at this exact moment
I am willing to change that
my PC is getting internet through my laptop because I don't have a wifi card in Yvonne
eeeeehhhh it's alright I guess
"mhm Ill just not say anything next time. its easier than fucking up."
I'm actually completely lost here
He got kicked last time
I already know this is gonna end poorly so do we ban or kick
Or this fuck gets the boot
Get him to explain himself
Okay fuck him

I don't feel terribly comfortable doing actual suicide counciling
<:mariaWave:409855829941157888>
I dunno he was stupid enough to tell us he trolls servers for fun
Yeah but he might have forgotten, or something
I don't even think he knows I'm staff
He just wanted a sound file
I would have accepted "green weeder"

Neat
Wait is Denver one of the places where it's legal
Yeah, usually
Roger that Green Leader
I haven't found an easy way to do that built-in
If it ever gets out, I'm disabling that feature
Probably just part of the 410 billion anime fans that are upset
May as well ask
21 hours ago though
Relevant, kinda
There we go

Why did that not work

So if we see him posting anything even remotely controversial I'm gonna instaban

I'm going on record right now and saying that I refuse to have responsibility for anyone's continued existence thrust upon me. **I know that's not what's happening here,** but I just want it to be extremely clear that I do not have the ability, energy, or motivation to deal with that as an aspect of this position.

hey look it's way better when I have an actual wifi card installed

Lots of new people
I guess it helps us keep track of users who rejoin on the same account but with a different name
Does the mention actually do anything useful though?
I'm very impressed
So it'll get done
I've been either slammed at work or have no PC to work on, now I do have a PC and tomorrow off
I have no idea why Nadeko uses mentions but now that I'll have a few days of no responsibilities, I'll work that into Shirabe instead
<a:This:447898938796933120>
because they're being a lil rude right now
very tempted to tell Jacq off for being dismissive
I'm hungry but my head still hurts a little bit, I'd have to take my skirt off and put pants on, and it's like a quarter-mile walk to my car
Yes, breakfast and late lunch
And I feel like literal butt
But it's here
No idea where it came from
I've just been fucking smashed with a wave of apathy and general malaise
My god
Oh
Yeah and they used the MTF/FTM notation which made me vaguely uncomfortable
Including the non-binary option
But those options were all in the first section
The first part of the survey asks if the respondent is transgender *twice*
That's a spades romance if I've ever seen one
Oh jesus no please
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
What did I miss with Yorin?
<:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
good
headpat
wow that's not satire
`The Foundation for Economic Education (FEE) is a libertarian economic think-tank dedicated to the "economic, ethical and legal principles of a free society."`
I don't like that first one but the second two are good, yeah
Lol they posted to /r/yuri
<:RecruitSalute:440719325306028032>
Nyaa~
Maybe cat paws
Or fox hands
`trailblazers`
Yeah the shotgun approach is weird
I just really like doing surveys
It was "does it already"
It was really satisfying saying "strongly disagree" to "the anime community welcomes LGBT members"
If you hadn't vetted them I'd have quit out there
and who was NO
who was ü§î
and the "no word limit" jab
I love the five think reactions
I'm just going to overlook the fact that he referred to an *actual person* as a trap because he backed the fuck off immediately
Lectric deleted his own messages, that ain't me
CAPE
But it's done
Changing Shirabe's was a bit more difficult because I didn't add in a feature to do that
`why am I always suspicious of new people if they don't have an avatar`
but then again, I'm biased towards lobsters right now
I'd've said lobster

I got a bit more expensive shipping to make sure it got here before I moved
Like, $130
She's staying in there for a bit longer until I move
There's the boxsu

So I'm sharing here instead
But I don't want to share it because the elitists will bitch at me about it
The bellfine one the elitists were bitching about but I bought anyway

What about <@431656503490117632> needs a description
Elise was less than pleased
I managed to work a steamed hams joke into monster hunter yesterday

you'll be done when you "join an online session"
so go ahead and start

For all intents and purposes, my birthday is the 16th this year
So on the 19th ish I'll be Kiri again

I'm driving up to Denver on the 17th

<:ShirabeThink:461322366010654730>

I spoke to Latooni briefly about this but we need to watch Tiny Miku for incel bullshit
no, today it's "my character is in intense grief over losing an incredibly close friend and nobody is really doing anything to help her"
God I'm fucking bored
***YES***
I have now discovered you can use cross-server emoji in the topics
wise words, as always
<@431656503490117632> needs more representation on this server
I made a slight change to the <#336297387863703552> channel description
ah ok
okay yeah I need to sleep, it'll be fine tomorrow tho
might be 1player only but after that you're good
I forget how the early early game works
maybe
`it might want you to find the Jagras first and then I can join afterwards`
apparently you're not in a session
so we can play tomorrow after I get off
ow
but it's 2am and I have work tomorr
all the quest boards work the same, and have the same stuff
the workshop has one, canteen has one, gathering hub has one, tradeyard has one
yeah the handler is also a quest board
the quest marker should point you to where you need to go
there's a few scattered around
otherwise I'll join immediately
it might want you to find the Jagras first and then I can join afterwards
then go start the quest, and depart, and I'll try join
so you go to a quest board, online session, join friend, pick me
if you cant start a quest in like 5 minutes I'm gonna pass the fuck out
it really is
oh that's good
should I boot game back up
oh, nice
like, not enough, or bad sticks
what's going on?
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
what happened
so 1, to start
and I'll bring whatever the highest rarity of weapon you have
I'm keeping my beefy armor but it's mostly ranged skills so there's no damage buffs for melee
I probably wont be on too much longer tho, maybe an hour or so
feel free to pop in to voice when you ready
your what
ever
they don't force you to use any weapon you don't want to
it's a practice thing
We aren't the military, there's no fraternization policy. That being said, I understand the concern, hence me bringing it to light in this channel
But this is my "let's try to avoid that" thing
If the worst comes to pass, and I *need* to be involved, I'll try my best to avoid bias
Full disclosure for purposes of avoiding bias in moderation:
I'm dating Hazel, as of yesterday, so I'll have to be excused from any incidents involving her
Tiny Miku is now Yumi
Get just the video link and it should be fine
Because you keep trying to do bigass links with extra info
"I'll take anyone and everyone who will cuddle me"

"I'm definitely not going to be abused ever"
But I see it like the opposite. Instead of "I like this person, I wonder if they're romantically interested in me" it's "this person is romantically interested in me, I wonder if I like them"
Casual dating can be fun
sorry Boss
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
I can come then
Elise is going to bed in like, 2 hours
and the helmets
the waist pieces look different too, usually
like the rath gunner sets looked so slick
I did like having different options for the look on the same monster armor
I hated the armor split, kinda
there are a lot less weapons, and a lot of them are very samey
yeah same
and none else
I have like 10 rathian plates
me, eternally
Wants to relax a bit when she gets home
She's had a hell day at work
And then I need to make sure Elise doesn't have a meltdown
20 minutes until end of shift, 20 minutes to get home
When I'm out of work
Fun
Oh you did a backwards portmanteau
The magdala lama
Or am I forgetting a monster
Do you mean magdaros
I didn't upgrade any armor until high rank
Yeah zinogre thank you
Starts with a Z, does the same tail flip thing
Toby is more like the lightning tiger from 4u
Anjanath is my single least favorite monster in the entire franchice
Toby is the wall for new folks in the series
Oh right you've played monhun before
Did you hit the toby m'dachi wall
I don't mind the occasional whiff of weed but if it smells like they camped out in the devil's cabbage patch it becomes a problem
I'm working all day tomorrow
If you fire perfectly straight up the damage is lessened because the bullet loses its aerodynamics
The Mythbusters did do an episode
That was for scrmz's benefit
Both of those things
People do that
The damn thing is *always loaded*
Know what's behind your target at all times
Finger away from the trigger until you're ready to fire
Only point it at things you want to destroy
Temporal proximity makes me concerned.
<:homurathink:366003465387769857>
Does your job want you to open carry or something
Whazzat for
My execution
Like I said, boss's idea
excellent
why

eyyyyyy I didn't carry us that time
what rarity is your weapon
I restart
I just closed the game
I was rushin
sorry I forgot to bring the low rank weapon
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>

I tried to tail slice but it felt like it was gonna take too long
<:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
and it's rarity 7 because I just remembered to not bring good weapons
this bowgun has slicing rounds
i'm gucci
uuuuh in like five minutes, is that too long of a wait
I still have no idea what Police Story is but I'm working til 6 PST

<:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
it doesn't for me
you needed to unlock guild quests iirc
http://kiranico.com/en/mh4u/wiki/talismans
I swear it does
4u had charms
mhm
I kinda really like the scoutfly level mechanic
level 1 scoutflies do
sometimes, yeah
makes you really feel like you're hunting it
and *then* spot it
and then follow the trail
I kinda like how if you're trying to find a monster, you have to hunt around for tracks first
It took me 52 because I kept trying to be sneaky and not beat her up
<@!127644949884698624> I don't have the old serber image so if you head out early, I need it
I get off work in a bit over an hour
I work weekdays now <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
Rathian plate are Good
Oh nice
Exactly
It's a Bad Idea‚Ñ¢
Hence "damage is lessened" rather than "damage is nullified"
But even a little deviation and the stabspin is preserved
Because every time I do I feel like yelling at the both of them
Not look at serious discussion right now
I need to
it's *painfully* obvious pop and bread are straight
Did you not return the borked one
We have actual robos
I just noticed how pretty Elfnein's eyes are
the salt is delicious but it's never going to end
just block him

it's BlueMadoka
Nearly word for word what bingo said the last time I witnessed him interacting with anyone
I saw this and was reminded of why I hate bingo with a passion
oh right they hoist on the sidebar for whatever reason
or it'll quietly fail and they'll sweep it under the rug
<:SerenaOhoho:449358389563359234>
all three simultaneously?
wait really
what did they remove from their stuff? and I'm guessing they have a history of this
`we will held the event`
dess_local /root/music/Happy Smile Vacation.mp3
do we have new screenshots
weird
oh they straight up don't want to?
agreed
God, if we judged on 4 years ago ***I'd*** be banned without hesitation.
She's getting judgement passed because of the events of the past few days, with the 4 years ago being evidence of character
She's not getting judgement passed because of that.
As I mentioned to someone else:
` I don't want none of that drama but I also feel really sorry for her
so that's my cross to bear
not yours`
at least not productively
you haven't changed
People can change in 4 years. If you're still doing the *same destructive shit*
Exactly my rationale as well
used the departure ping
I've already banned her
`I wanna host one for once`
does the permanent September song in the DJ corner count as a server event
I'm going to the latter
I must know context
`I just really wanted to ask`
`I know I can't`
Can I ban her so we don't have to deal with this constantly
Hazel left this time because of some perceived slight by Elise
reason, not an excuse
as usual
it generated Ry being an ass about something they aren't into
will not look good smol
its so big tho
is in heiro
in hell
what
hey R
`oh my god you changed your name here too`
it's a thing, that happened
Overall I think calling this a "playground for mods" is disingenuous. I personally try to be involved in as many conversations as possible, while many users most likely feel like staying out of certain channels/topics
wow latooni passed me
dess_xplb
Exactly the same, Boss
I've never commented there, and I unsubbed a few weeks back because laughing at dumbasses who can't understand satire can't make up for the bullshit opinions in those comments
I'm saying if we banned now based on 4 year old shit
but I'd definitely get some warnings
so maybe not ban on sight
wait no 20, I just turned 24
I was 19, and I had some shitty views because conservative parents that I hadn't yet grown out of
I couldn't watch more than 10 seconds
shoot
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
I'm surprised Cast hasn't mentioned the nep in <#336297674707828747>'s channel topic
he admitted to being so, 45 minutes ago
probably relevant

I solved the random crashes, and Shirabe will get mad at Kiri for giving us useless strings of numbers in <#389113078450749440>
unless there's something I'm forgetting
There's no immediate things that need to be fixed, I took care of the two biggest issues in like 2 hours
Not when I have no idea why it's not overwriting the file properly <:YuiScare:442105076933459979>
I could work with it if it's either one or the other but both is just whaaaaaaa
and for IRC
this markovborg R linked a while back is written in python 1
We should have auto-restart on server errors on both critical modules
<:Praise:391038800232448000>
according to logs, Solidsnook#2079
that's next on the list, shush
<:Praise:391038800232448000>

so I'm implementing a workaround
it's a server thing
is unpreventable by end users
So I've discovered that the lasted bug with Shirabe that has been plaguing me for weeks
<:Shrug:388950974817107968>
The Madoka server keeps losing moderators, and had two ownership changes in the last month
oh god that's rough
for the same reason
I hated AT&T back in Cali
Open source is the best thing ever
Yeah I don't want to invite some scrando bot
I think adding it to the subreddit would be fun but also a little unnecessary

Heading out for f√ºd
Okay I can probably work with that one
Kiri does
Good call
as long as we're clear
I'm working on the stuff I want to work on
you're not "getting me to work on" anything
`i am also hesitant to get you to work on improving shirabe's talking functions`
also
it's really not a problem
can't change that one
still hosted on my end
nothing bad would happen
but like, even if she was added to other servers
I have her set to only allow me to add her
where did that print
yes
<a:WutChris:431361817009192962>
dess_lp
dess_listperms
full list, bingobongo
https://nadekobot.me/commands
I can work with whatever they give me
sounds good
feels good to get that out of the way
Our bots should now have close to 100% uptime
minor hiccup because I forgot to remove a debug
Alright, subreddit module should be active
it looks for a space before the dess
<:Praise:391038800232448000>
it should work for desspacito
and, because of how she works
it's easy, dess
Just added the no-crash fix to that lil module too
so, I hope you didn't forget about the kiri reactions, dess
it's over_18 not over18
the docs were wrong about the attribute
no thumbnails
I'm testing NSFW scrubbing now
so, closer to 30 seconds because of the login checks + corrections
oh wait no we're fine
this is a new error
*fuck*
just missed a post
maximum delta of 16 seconds
this is way more satisfying than using that off-the-shelf RSS bot anyway
I'm at 6 posts in a row, no alternation yet
anyway, "funny" things aside
I'm so confused

this should help
I've added some extra login checks
this is one of the better ones

I hate /r/funny now
I'm testing a few workarounds
consistently
it works for a bit, then posts every *other* post
I've discovered an interaction between the auto-restart functionality I'm making standard, and the reddit stream I'm opening
but it's working
it's definitely not funny
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>

<:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
there's a python API
I'm actually stupid
uh
oh
I ain't got no idea what the fuck is goin on but I'll try my best
<@456226577798135808> that code you linked is C#
self admitted, on several occasions
<@!99695384296701952> remember that Bread likes to bait
So idk
I actually love it, but I also don't do it too often

<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>


That's no fun
Oh you guys never guessed my new middle name last night
technically it was "disarmed"
how is "emulating shitty behavior" not a "real problem"
I'll shut up
fine
I'm ***venting*** in a private staff channel
I'm not citing rules, I'm not even challenging them
R, I'm not taking action *because* I have no evidence
it's absolutely for the sake of stirring shit up
coming out of nowhere, stating a clearly unpopular opinion, and grossly misrepresenting the other side
this one as documentation for lectric



I've never spoken to him
twice
in logs
so this lectric thing is touching on a sore spot
and then continuing to do it
I'm just really fucking tired of bread *admitting to stirring up controversy for no reason*
who isn't here
because Ibu responded
<@290431224596660224> don't engage
I added a bunch of my gif emoji, finally
just so it's written down in a place that isn't general
damn. I got a lot of bot stuff done today
we make announcement tomorrow
I'm supposed to be playing pathfinder not coding
no wait


I have yet to see any "harmful content"
I 100% agree with the person being replied to, savisavichan or whatever
people sexualizing it on places where minors can't see it is fuckin a-ok imo, and doesn't twitter have an age filter
so am I scrmz, I'm still in very early design phase
has anyone else had any ideas about the *actual gameplay* yet, I've still got my turn-based strategy thing going on
I'm going to work on keeping the cards up to date
Today
things like the gacha and card management and stuff
a webapp for the actual game, but most out-of-game features can also be accessed through discord
I think I've decided on how I want to handle the XDU game
that's an opt out
nah
but I could
I won't
I could make it so every time Kiri is mentioned, it pings everyone
so yeah if The People‚Ñ¢ will it, it shall be done
it'd take like 10 minutes max
that seems reasonable
14 members with the XDU role
<:TachankaDab:437694204387393537>
*dab*
That counts
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Probably after some gw2 with bae tho
Ye
I'm using my free time to name change and gender marker shenanigans at the moment
But when someone is telling you "this is bad" why is your first response "uuuh I'm actually not doing it at all"
I get it, empathy is hard

how can someone have such an incredible lack of self-awareness
`Well yeah but I like Chris`
***oh my god they really***
<:Kiricoin:473685957330206731>
I can now interface Maria and Kiricoins
we can fuck around with database values via discord text commands
<@431656503490117632>
<a:FlippingEyes:442017142859104257>
<:Praise:391038800232448000>
***YATTA***
that'll be snuck into a special event
YES
or JPG
because of all the waifu PNGs
PNG
we could do
oh my god
but let's see how R's logo for RV turns out
I do like IGNITE
so, maybe not
FF in games is also surrender
please do
RV for revolution
RV?
FMJ?
Symphogear DMG it is
Alright, that's good enough for me
Symphogear DMG
The Mariabot game
What should we call it
On that note
And I'm not sure what to expect on the other side
I've been waiting on XDU to load for... 5 hours
Sounds like you had a good time
let's do 5 to start
?
too many
with the special gacha geahs on top of that
I'm thinking 5-10, that's 30-60 in common pool
how many of each geah should be in common pool
cape will be in common pool, just for R
hopefully tomorrow?
and then add onto it for grand opening
Let's make our common pool first, which is probably just gonna be a few of the main 6's basic geahs
what should be in our grand opening gacha
okay boy and girls and Alice
I love programming
700ish database entries
we're not doing the "pick your waifu"
exactly
or one a day
like, one card a week goes on sale
do we want select cards in a "pay for 10 pulls, get this one card you want"
question
maybe even tonight if I go hard but I wanna play vidya\
tomorrow
I can have the gacha done in like
absolutely
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dVW2aNh9cQtVJ4lHhrMn6Piq8bCTB-bXHU1TIzRun98/edit?usp=sharing
kiri actually has a "react to get currency" feature built-in
like enough for a single pull
do we want the authority to hand out small amounts at our discretion
that'll be updated as we go

```
prompt sumbission (10x pull)
prompt reviews (1x pull)
participation in server events (3x pull per few hours)
running events (10x pull per few hours)
daily (22hr) allowance (2x pull[?])
posting self-made art/writing not related to event (4x pull)
```
how do we generate them
okay @everyone the use for Kiricoins is imminent
scrmz join SONG
`they're talking to each other`


feel free to keep rolling the bones
you shouldn't have gotten the same card twice though
you can name all your cards `tidy` if you wanted
no it was Latooni's file not being made
someone tripped an error
feel free to keep doing it
try sending Maria "roll the bones" either in a DM or on the Lulu Bus

I want more test
please do, actually
feel free to type "add card" anywhere on the Lulu Bus
confirmed persistence, added confirmation, and restricted replies to the DM so users can do other shit during the process
and it's the best way I can think of for them to remember which is which
they're the only ones who'll be using them
Everyone gets their own .json file with their own names for their cards

3 cards to max awake
yeah
but for release, all of em
we'll probably have a rotating focus gacha at some point
and it'll be cheaper than the regular one by a lot
and people can have one free pull a day
I was just gonna have all memoria available all the time
uuuuhhhhh
hey sorry getting some things working
add it to the doc
oh I like that
but you'll need like, 5-10 tokens
after that, you get a "Thanks for playing" token that you can spend on getting a card you actually want
The dupes give you access to the awakened art
I now have a script to build JSON gachas with shitloads of numbers
Attacks are non-determined right now
I have absolutely no idea which ones to pick, but they're numbered so I can definitely pick the low numbered ones
Not sure yet
And I have a script to load up the different gachas with relative ease
So yeah the framework is done
I'm gonna make fud
I want to keep testing the robustness so by all means, roll a few more times ~~please~~
screenshot?
can you click it and "view original"
I've already run a proof-of-concept for deducting currency
I approve
Zenbahamut
Boss gets me.
there's your problem
I haven't seen any attempts from you in a while
what have you been typing
***keep rolling them bones***
oh my god I'm so excited
and expandable
and this gacha system runs completely off of a json and my database so it's fully functional
I think we're gucci on the awakening thing
I've been doing quick reloads
you probably got her while I was rebooting
keep going
alright, I've squashed a couple json errors
Basic gacha features are fully functional.

It's a good thing you stopped because that pisses me off to no end <:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>
Honestly I said exactly the same thing when I heard that he got dumped
It was in general, hours ago
Ugh, Yorin was doing the "I'm right amd I have a one-liner for literally everything you say" thing to WFC
The XDU ping works
With a plaintext username
No, Shirabe should have sent an additional message
Also, I *thought* I fixed the leaving thing

best guess is that she was born in Eastern Europe
iirc
Federal Institute of Sacrists
yes
Rbetter than Vxdu
Revolution, Revolving Ver, Ressurection of Ver, Rewarding Victory, Red Vapes
so that logo would be sweet
<@456226577798135808> executive decision, we're going with Symphogear RV
oh also
R, that's exactly what I'm doing
check the todo <:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
renaming cards is now possible
which was a good decision because I use it a lot
Oh, the Gear name is in the database
I can do a rename real quick
there is none
what default name
that was what the "wait no" was for

wait no
added maria-color to the embed

XDU has their awakening system so I'm just using those arts
That's literally what it is, yeah
Easily
Anyway I gotta shower, brb
Revolution was actually the source word I used to arrive at RV
And RV does mean Revolution
rv_ is what we're using

So I can add it to the help embed
I'd like it if the logo was ready soon
Noooo RV
It'll check to see if you can afford it, add any bonus pulls you're entitled to, and roll them sequentially
Where X is the number of pulls
It's rv_pull X
Yeah the cost thing is the first thing on the todo list
I thought we were talking about tokens again
That
Oh oh
Oh, how about the tokens can be used to purchase focus units from old gachas
The store is coming later. Probably very soon, but I need a way to easily display all the cards for a gear
We talked about this
Roll 5, get 1 free was my plan
mhm
but yeah, they won't have a sprite or anything on the map
meaning you'll get a one-time special ability
unless you're seeing something I'm not
she isn't explicitly asking though
and that's not okay
Memoria will be off-map support units
I'm thinking 4

This shit is ready to launch as soon as I write the help embed
Alright, we're integrated with Kiricoins.
I like the restriction, yeah
I've made 4 channels in a "Symphogear RV" group

yeah
that seems pretty snazzy actually
coo
<@456226577798135808> biggest priority now is a logo
and I'm going to do PvP after PvE is fleshed out
Keep the story
the game itself will be a webapp
and we aren't restricted to discord
to represent the units you'll have in the turn-based strategy game
This is why I said it wasn't a card game
I do like the story though
Absolutely not.
Not doing a deckbuilder.
Nope.
I'm workin on it
I'll get the add link ready
she's on the server and ready to roll
that sounds like a good plan
there's no possibility of whaling here, so we'll be slower regardless
dess_timelyset 75 20
75?
and we can only have 1 reaction event at a time
I was thinking the daily could be just 100
It'd be stupid to just throw coins at people
yeah the "give 500" idea was going to be through a reactionevent
exactly
only works once
boop it to get coin

edited the announcement
pending the help command
yeah
I'm still working on that part
@everyone, please say hello to our new ~~robot overlord~~ mechanical FIS member, SG-x00 Maria!  

Kirichan likes to meme with us, and handles a lot of things behind the scenes. Shirabe watches us, eternally upset because she did ***not*** appreciate being forced to attend classes. Maria is going to be a little different. 

We're enabling Kirichan's currency system, called Kiricoins <:Kiricoin:473685957330206731>. You'll be able to acquire these with a daily allowance, participation in server events, and just generally being a good person, among other things. "Oh, but Saki, what are we going to *spend* them on?" 

Turns out that XDU isn't a terribly good game, but the waifu PNGs are pretty great. Maria will be accepting Kiricoins as the premier currency in her gachas. You can collect all the waifu PNGs you want, set your favorite as your representative, and look up other users' favorites. Many, ***many*** more features will be coming soon. Stay tuned!

Take a look at <#495331732887699466> in our new Symphogear RV category for more information <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
How's this for an announcement:

dess_cc dess_economy enable <#336299788792496129>
dess_cc dess_economy <#336299788792496129> enable

dess_award is a built-in Kiri feature
Definitely
works for me
and a valuable service
it's a low number
I think 25 for Rakhi's daily fanart is decent
at our discretion of course
to promote activity on the subreddit
I think 25 coins for a subreddit post is reasonable
750, submitting a prompt is a lot of work
I still think that 1000 is good for a submission
that I'll need graphics for
that's a completely different beast
Couple weeks, minimum
seeecret
headpat
yes
Shirabe doesn't bring much damage on her own
Chris would get fucked up if anything got in her face
Kiri's bad against extremely high-damage enemies, because avoiding their attacks reduces her damage
look, synergy!
paired with Shirabe's defense buffs
Kiri could be better when retaliating against something that just attacked her
so turret, kinda thing
oh, I like that
makes sense to me
if you need someone long-range for a mission, look at Chris cards
Maria is high melee sustained damage via self-buffing, Hibiki is an excellent support unit, Basa has flexible range
Chris is ranged nuke, Kiri could be melee nuke
I want Kirika to be flashier than poison though
sounds good
maybe 2-3 weeks
ish
probably add a new gacha every 1-2 weeks, and phase out the older ones once we have 4 up
`dess_award X user reason`
I wonder how long it'll be before the other server finds out
oh that sounds like big fun
that would be fun
mhm
you can award to a role, but not to multiple individuals
hell, even ask them if they think it's okay
I'd say make sure that the users know exactly why though, make it as transparent as possible
when we host events we're going to be getting less than if it was userhosted
I sure as shit didn't make this to not participate
Do I get coins for writing a gacha bot
dess_lb
That deserves *something*
It's selfmade fanart posted to this server
Can I award Lily 200 <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> for her booette
Oh
Anyway, brb shower
Alright, that's fair
If I didn't have any Kiris in the first day or two of XDU I would have dropped it then
It's a basic bitch version, but just having *one* of them keeps you invested
Honestly I'm 100% okay with those too but *sigh*
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
I'm just gonna make a temp gacha with just a Kanade for him
I can actually call myself a developer now
I feel like between RV and Shirabe
hey, just because I'm the developer doesn't mean I'm not interested in the design too <:Pout:400188180265041923>
that would work
which nobody else gets a buff for
and it's less "get a free counterattack" and more "This person hit me last turn so I do X% more damage this turn"
Kiri is really good at them
oh like "every Kiri card is the same"
I'm thinking like, each gear would have a small passive that's common to all of her cards
I'm just gonna give new people 500 <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> when they join in <#368973801561653253>
this is in general, on the celeste discord
this is exactly why I think stopping WFC from drunksadposting is a good idea
with 120
so you'd get 24 unicode characters
each unicode character is 5 chars
yeah that's why the card list is paginated
but it'll be obnoxious for you when you go to do anything with that card
Nope
no workaround for that, really
they auto-position
they're inline fields
it's the only thing she rejects
yes
It has specific formatting to allow for lots of flexibility in your card names
because we're not supposed to have the pngs
as long as it's not `at japs` as louis so eloquently put it
dess_$
dess_$ is the kiricoin counter
I'm okay with 200 for art, 250 if it's symphogear
The point is activity on the server
take does't take arguments I think
who used it isn't terrible useful
telling which invites get used is the important part
not that I could see
how can we tell which link someone used to join
I do like the termination of links idea
probably general?
oh now would be a decent time to get public opinion on awarding me coins for bot creation
agreed with melua
so I'll look into it
saw a new "session still open" error on the sourcer
so that's fixed
she was trying to post to a channel on the lulu bus because I forgot to update a channel ID
okay for the departures
I might know what it is
oh if that's the case
no idea, I still need to figure out why that part of shirabe isnt working
todo list is fine, but it's not happening right now
I don't want to make a new patch right now
I spent 3 days doing nothing but coding
Look
I could have them ask me about it.
or
so I know they're interested
I want them to ask me about it
should I add something pointing to <#495331732887699466> for RV to the intro message? and bugging me for the intro package
except I think there's *maybe* one person interested in Jacq's thing
we gave out quiplash coins and Lily's art
except they're not
the RV discussion channel
and assure people that we will never remove coins we've already given them
I think it's perfectly fair to say "this is a very volatile system, and we're still experimenting"
I'd want to raise the reward for submitting a bit in that case
and what will that be
because that's the best way to solve this problem
like literally five seconds ago
I just did
I'm glad I'm not going crazy
exactly
and I don't want it=
rahki is the only one doing it
except
because I ***hate*** crypto
I hate Rahki calling it crypto
that is equally possible to do with "here is a box, pay for a ticket, here's the rewards"
Okay, and I'm trying to figure out what  the concept of a pot brings to the table that "here's a buy-in, here's the reward table" doesn't
because they're spammable
and then back down to 5
I watched someone go from 100 to over ten thousand in 20 minutes
the built-in nadeko games are *awful* from an economy management perspective
I mind people giving their coins to other people
I don't mind people betting coins and losing/gaining it from the void
and it discourages hoarding after a point because anything above the cap is wasted
we can put a cap on kiricoins
we can print and delete coins as needed
I don't particularly see the point of a Pot
yeah I don't like the idea of people consolidating all our currency onto one person
what's the thing
shall I respond with that
"Yes, but we reserve the right to cap you out if we feel you're spamming your works for coins"
how's that for a response
"If you post it and it stimulates discussion, then yes you'll get coins"
we have *no idea* how much the winners are going to get
it's based on the pot, and we're assigning it manually
again
`rv_winner <name> <amount> to assign each winner's winnings manually`
That's *exactly what you're suggesting*
"Give us your currency! The winner gets 200 coins!"
`wrong as in morally wrong`
"Give us your currency! We have no idea how much you'll get back if you win, and if you lose then some amount of it is going to some other user!`
and both ways involve a lot more work than "Win 300 coins! 25 coins to enter!"
R, either we'll know how much we want to redistribute the wealth and be forced to actively fuck with the rewards at the end, or stick with our posted rewards and have no idea how much we'd be shifting around
` rv_winner <name> <amount> to assign each winner's winnings manually`
*while saying that it actually has all of those advantages*
R, you are arguing for a more manual, easier to abuse on our end due to "tweaking" after the fact, and an unknown redistribution of wealth
how on ***earth*** is that wrong or unfair
It's a constant number that would be presented as "Win this amount!" beforehand
with you way, we'd have to work out how much to give each person, based on a percentage
The math is ***built in***
If we're planning an event with 150 50 rewards, and 4 winners. We'd be giving out 150+50*3, 300 coins.
We'd have to do a lot more math, and we'd have absolutely no idea how much the wealth would be distributed
***Exactly***
it's called dess_award
we already have a command for `rv_winner name amount`
I really don't understand why you think I'm programming in the entire event
so the win command would be a single command, with a bunch of pings.
The "win rewards" in my example would be either a single number, for all winners to recieve, or a set of numbers for first, second, third etc.
so you're suggesting a system with ***much more effort required*** on our part, given that we need to specify name *and* amount to each person, individually
`rv_pot "name"`
`rv_eventlist`
`rv_enterevent "name" "buyin amount"`
`rv_winners "ping1" "ping2" etc`

this is what I'm imagining you're doing
that's my proposed system.
`rv_event "buyin cost" "win reward" "name"`
`rv_eventlist`
`rv_enterevent "name"`
`rv_winners "ping1" "ping2" etc`
How exactly do you plan on "initializing a pot"

I want to know how much we're giving to any one person before we even start
I've already discussed the psychological difference brought up. I don't want a percent because that's unpredictable
...yes?
The process is identical.
A moderator intializes an event via mariabot. Users use a command to buy-in. ***we,*** as the host of the event, distribute the rewards using mariabot commands.
the ticket is a metaphor, there probably won't be a need to limit the amount of them
How do you plan on adjusting the amounts rewarded from a pot, if neither manually nor programatically?
You still haven't told me what a pot does that a ticket doesn't
but without a "pot" and just a reward
whatever event will still be the same
and you're still participating with the others with the "pay for a ticket" model
R, there is a psychological difference between "oh I lost" and "oh I lost, my money is going to the winner"
100 people having 200 coins (total 20000) is waaaay better than 1 person having 5000 and 99 having 0
I think that's a huge problem
Kiricoins are a fiat currency, backed by the Bank of Maria
Those are the two exact reasons why I want fixed payouts. You've hit the nail on the head.
Exactly
5 or more entrants and we're removing currency.
"We're doing a special, contest writing prompt! 50 coins to enter, 200 if you win the popular vote!"
So yeah, that one has a variable payout.
I gave the exact commands that would be used
No, this would be a mariabot thing, as I outlined last night
Variable payout depending on what happens
100 coin buy-in, 200 coin payout. That's the gambling aspect.
Two events, I think she will and I think she won't
And an "event" can be "Who thinks Kirika is going to die before episode 4?"
Fucking time
This entire
That's exactly what I've been suggesting Latooni
I agree with that!
Nobody has even attempted to address it
I'm still very against the "someone has my coins" philosophy.
The question is "does saki want to put in the extra effort to make this happen"
If that's exactly it, then my current arguments against are perfectly valid.
I'm thinking "a temporary object that holds people's coins, and the coins get distributed amongst winners at the end"
I'm not against gambling. I'm against the pool.
The pool adds extra work for me, and us, introduces another failure point, and adds resentment for "that person has my coins"
Keeping track of who's participating removes the need to have a pool at all
And multiple lists of participants.
I have yet to see a single compelling reason for a pool at all.
And that can be easily dealt with by keeping a list of the people who've entered. Automatically, mind you, no extra work
I'll try to think of things but that's something we can all work on
Exactly, Boss. Keeping the pool around makes a psychological difference and has no real reason to exist
To do list

<:Praise:391038800232448000>
Because it is
nowhere did you say or imply that
so then she gives me 100. I get 105, she gets 5. We're both now 10 richer than we started
So, no
I'd want a tax on it but that actively discourages the giving
Exactly
`i actually even had an idea to encourage positivity and friendship with tipping by making the initial tip give a bit extra to the person its being given AND the same amount of that extra cash being given back to yourself`
And yes I think everyone can use give
if I give Melua 100. She gets 105, and I get 5 back. This is what you're suggesting?
Driving, sec
dess_give 5 <@99695384296701952>
And yeah I have a script to generate them

Thoughts?
Maybe introduce a swimphogear gacha
Patch today: every 5 pulls, not 5 at once
New user package
Internal documentation
Wanna huntan when I'm home?
Human-readable, too
Easy way to store and retrieve info like that
JSON files are super flexible and I love them
That wouldn't be too difficult, I think
<:NononPout:454088299963875349>
I hate TCGs
I don't want people to trade cards though
Profile trophies are a good plan
And that is now on my list
But profiles are a good idea too
Card management and the game was the thing
But I don't like the implication of throwing stuff on my todo list just because I like coding
And I plan on it now
It's a good idea
It was never mentioned
Do we plan on implementing user profiles?
<:badedisgust:428703435089510410>
The concepts are linked
The flat payout limits any one person's winnings, whereas the pot makes it easier for one person to shoot up
none of the rv_ commands get deleted
tell me what you get
go do it
ROLL YOUR GACHA
the memoria will be a whole seperate system
doesn't matter where you've made them
every 5 pulls, you get a bonus
I don't want to
Ok, I'm now storing the total number of spins people are doing. Now to figure out the logic on how many bonuses they get, if any
`good reason I'm patching today`
I forgot to comment out the roll the bones command
oops
<@!127644949884698624> you should award it to me in the currency channel, I don't like the idea of giving it to myself, or doing it privately
those are my 2 least favorite Kiris

But I want swimphogear Kiri <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
no elfnein for you quite yet
Sorry hun
I don't want to mess with those until the game exists, or is close to existing
that'll be a while
just, more options
rv_gachalist exists for a reason
the current one is staying
not that I'm aware of
We can do Fine, Ver and the Illuminati for Halloween, methinks
we're saving IGNITEs for game launch, but
and we have a lot of catchup to do
I feel like we should have another gacha up before people hit 500 again
The bonus would have to be capped
and now you want users to generate them on the fly, themselves
we were literally just discussing how to remove coins
And this, again, is completely the opposite of what we want
We host the game, play it here
why is that evil
Kiri just hosts the currency
The gacha is mariabot
Rakhi takes forever to name her cards
<@!127644949884698624> did you lose any coins
<@456226577798135808> why would you pull now, I'm working on the bonus counter <:SerenaOhoho:449358389563359234>
noice
User action is immediate, removal of the offensive card isn't
That's why you can delete messages, and perform action on the user
I have access to all the files
that's called "I go into the JSON and delete the card"
controlled quality too
Makes sense
Oh, like file directory and names
isn't it?
it's on nyaa
We already have a workaround planned
Like we've said four times
I refuse to give bisa clicks
they both use the JSONs and DBs
that's the plan, Boss
R
that's King Records

another person
yes you can have Maria's theme be "This is a Crab Rave"
it's definitely gonna be "Hey, this can play your own music! Place the files in x/y/z folder!"
it can, webapps use %appdata% for shit all the time

it's been working for the projects I can do on my own
yeah, ever since Kiri took over

yeah, constant updates with mockups and stuff would be great to avoid that sort of thing
the UI would be super helpful
I wonder if Lily and Lucy would be interested in being guest artists
`I hope everyone likes chibis`
oh jeez I'm gonna have to make the sprites myself
I have it already, it's good
it actually looks really solid

what
uh
but in the end, you're a volunteer just like the rest of us so you're free to work or not work on whatever
so after you get the UI worked on, I think the units are probable a good next step
and I'm working on the code, boss is working on the design
Yes, but they need to get done before we ship
animations are R's purview
mhm
they'd leave map then
mm good point
if we're even using noise
noise would poof
oh that would only be for gear units
respect for the dead
I actually kind of wanted dead units to become unwalkable terrain
also easy
no, those are fine
it either reverses meaningful progress made by the other team, or allows you to snowball hard
Summon minion is fine but I don't really want raise dead to be a mechanic
we can see both
this is all super early stages though so
duelyst uses red, and it's rather nice
not red?
whereas the enemy threat overlay could just be the same color as the "this is bad" color
You do a lot of clicking on friendlies, which generates the valid move overlay
enemies have red, allies have none

I honestly can't remember
it works really well in Duelyst
friendlies look right, enemies look left
Friendlies will be differentiated by facing direction
can I use the Kirika role-green as the "you can move to these squares" indicator
so it doesn't interact with any "extend duration of active buffs" effects
probably with a tag that just won't use duration
actually
basically
they're buffs with a duration of -1
is the answer
it's functionally identical to what you need, but way easier
the grass tiles are now also clickable but only without a unit on it
Unity has built-in JSON support so that's ezpz
but a minor pain in the ass
do-able, and it's all read-only
okay DB connection looks like it might be a minor pain in the ass
I'm not much better
Damn, you are a lightweight
special tiles we can save for a post-launch patch
that adds a lot of extra effort into planning your moves
Restricting movement I'd say no
but yeah, ideally I'd like a few different tilesets like, field (what I'm using now), urban, arena
friendlies are passable, but no unit stacks
either you can walk on it or you can't
mountains, rubble, car husks
movable and immovable
a couple nested "for"s
that's the plan now
the logic to map out all the squares is... interesting.
I'm stuck on "how can I display valid movable squares"
since every single ability will have one
I also added "Prio" to store that ability's priority
<:BasaSmug:497598144083787796>
okay, didn't make a whole lot of meaningful progress today but I'm starting to feel a little drained so I'm going to leave it there for a bit
"Values" are just the ratios that'll be plugged in
"Type" is going to be a list of text, comma seperated, of every function that needs to be called for that action
oh jeez girl get some food
here's the DB entries for the abilities

"and theoretically a UI option!"
like "look, theres a grid and sprites and spawning, and you can interact with yours"
this is ***super*** tech-demoy
and then back to player
all next turn does is swap it to enemy turn for 2 seconds
so I have no idea what's going on
again, can't recreate
and I've got the server version open
yeah none of that is happening on my end
I'm not able to recreate that
literally upload the files and bam
turns out super fucking easy
yeah it's super basic right now, I just wanted to see how easy/difficult it would be to host
are you able to do those two things
this is still the "click to flip units, next turn button toggles text at the bottom" thing

I wanna know how distro works real quick

I was about to have an aneurism
for a second I thought you were telling me I had a typo this entire time

for a mediocre end result
Staying in discord with a game means dealing with the platform actively working against me
Hmm, that's workable
the game will be non-functional without any cards in your account
technically, they won't see any assets unless they play the gacha here
In theory, yes, right?
only being able to see 12 cards at once is an issue
team management in discord will be clunky at best
very much so
We could use the lil square thumbnails, those exist unencrypted in the files so they might care less about them
shush
my vote is definitely not more important than yours
If we can't display card art then team management and profiles will have to stay completely in discord
I was hoping to display the card art ingame on the profile screen though
The only tie-in is going to be the database with card numbers and stats
Including it in the distro would be the far easiest solution
Can you contact Mili to see if we have permission to distribute
And also for the memes
I used it because the phases are planning and execution
It's not best practice but it's also not negatively impacting performance
Yeah, in the code the gamestates are world.plan(me) and world.execute(me) and those are going to stay the internal flags
Boss, you're gonna want to look at the gamestate text now, it's what I'll be using from now on to track what should and should not be allowed
*I love sp00kybasa so much goddamn*

can anyone find any "valid move detection" algorithms for me to use because reinventing the wheel isn't working out
It can happen whenever as long as the silence effect gets applied at the transition between execute and plan
And there should be a punishment for moving a unit into threat when you know a silence might occur
6)plan phase begins
I think you're missing what I'm saying

1)plan phase ends, execute begins
2)enemy silences your kiri
3)kiri still does whatever she wants
4) execute phase ends
5)kiri gets silenced
just like how units would die at the end of execution
I want this to be a game of knowledge, not luck
so you'd no which of your units are disabled
I feel like it would be okay for silences to happen, but for it to take effect on the next turn
native 0% on everyone, yeah
specific to certain units
Counters will be a passive ability, I think
`who am I kidding, yes`
for something they too could enjoy
would they do something *that petty*
I think 20% is a little high
we're making it a completely different genre, so no design copyright would be applicable

breadth-first searches seem to be recommended
circles

and that's an idea, melua
the *cartesian* unit circle, anyway
the unit circle is useless to me
R, I'm not working in regular coordinates
on the real number line they're identical
can also be read as magnitude x and magnitude y
most of the axioms hold except for SAS congruence
it's vaguely related to trig
I feel like r, based on headspace analysis
is that r^2, 2r, or r
The formula for the unit circle in taxicab geometry is | x | + | y | = 1

oh this is just rectilinear

oooooohhhh
also I'd ask to refrain from input on design until you're up to speed on the State of the Game
yeah complete is not a permanent state
and I have no idea why
also, the way I want the execute phase to work is 
1)hit button
2)all units move
3)abilities evaluate
4)death happens
5)debuffs happen
6)plan phase
q/e?
zoom, idk what buttons to use on the keyboard
camera pan will also be possible with wasd and arrow keys
preferably 128
I think I'd want the sprites to be 256x256 or smaller
fairly big
scroll wheel for zoom
I'm planning on using that for camera panning
if you execute while a unit is selected, it gets de-selected
or any other empty square
it'll stay selected until you click it again

"how many times has this Kanade died"
which are basically free to store
I kinda want to keep a shitload of stats because they're all just ints
add stat tracking to to-do
you're the designer allowing this to happen
why are you giving ridiculously fast units dots
so your `Not if it also has enough range to land a dot after it runs` criticism is invalid
before it hits the wall
and it can run for 3, maybe 4 turns, if it's all the way on one side of the field
no matter what system you're using
that's bad design
why would we give a unit 5+range if it's also highly mobile
being useless
Only if that unit with high movement spends all its time running
No, I'm saying in my system how would that situation occur
and that would be the advantage of having higher move distance
because if it took damage in one turn, there will almost always be capacity for it to take damage again unless it has a higher base move distance than the enemy
describe the situation in which a unit took damage in a turn and then is able to flee without being penalized
tiles have a Passable flag
yes
The grid isn't nearly big enough to pull off a cat and mouse for very long
plan and execute are simultaneous
this has nothing to do with speed though
look are you capable of saying anything good about any of my design preferences
but now that player knows red is targeting black
it wasn't before
`red goes first, red gets a hit and black leaves retaliation range`
red is the same either way
no, its a bad outcome for black
if they both have unit targets, yes that's option 1
black goes first and you get option 2 above
red goes first, red gets a hit and black leaves retaliation range
that's actually the worst outcome
left is simultaneous, right is unit target
let me illustrate
get as close as possible
2a) units with ground targets will move to that square
2b) units with unit targets will then move towards that unit
yeah that's straightforward enough
oh just changing the individual tile overlay
I'd have to start over
absolutely no to hexagons
define shape
the color is easy to change
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
I just want to make sure everyone is on the same page, which will take multiple examples
let me *redraw*
okay I guess I don't get to demonstrate
lines show targeted sqares. every unit has 4 move distance
`I'll redraw`
left situation

`two bursts`

If you think they're mutually exclusive then one of us isn't understanding the other
No, it's perfectly fine
two bursts
but movement is boring
you have 8 individual actions regardless
two bursts of movement vs 8 individual moves
turns would take a lot longer as you wait for each individual unit to move *and* act
they're completely different flows
getting one system working is a lot of effort, and not a lot would be transferrable to the other
oh so I need to fully develop two entirely seperate systems now
<:Shrug:388950974817107968>
and kiting is going to be a strategy in pretty much any system
I feel like I'm assuming you'd not be giving 5+ speed units dots with 5+ range
yes but she's picking out a single worst case scenario to say my system is bad
each turn can be planned out with no surprises
things like that is exactly why all buffs should be worded "adds X to the unit's *next turn*"
and then those buffs will impact balance elsewhere
so you're restricting every unit that has a buff ability to having high speed
and if their buff is crazy, they're OP
they'd be absolute garbo
I thought we were saying buffs/debuffs were applied at end of round
that's a goddamn mess
oh, absolutely not
speed buffs/debuffs are fine, I can just generate the turn order at the start of each turn
ah
scratch?
I could easily go from pictures to words
I'd already be going from words to function calls
python gui
In theory I could write another DB script for that, actually
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
it's going to be *very* precise
it relies on the db editor to get the syntax right
not really
that calls functions based on the keywords
it's literally going to be a limited programming language
and heals them for 20% of damage dealt
boom, unit's basic attack scales 100% off their attack
yeah, basically. add "atk, heal self" to basictype, "100 atk, 20 dmg" to ratio
armored car
and I'm planning on making it *so modular* that all you do is add a few words to the database
it's way too big
why would I make it hard on myself
I mean
I'm still not sure the best way to do it
the problem is storing it
I'll try?
I'd argue that if they didn't play by the rules they don't deserve the full payout
Oh lord what is it
I'm also changing now to avoid suspicion
I change my vote for the compelling color argument
True
I say cape is valid as well
Let's take a vote
Right?
So the plan is, only people with color me maria can talk in serenacon-2018 but everyone can see it
`SERNA 19`
Yes
When I get home from onboarding, DMV, and vacuum the house
I completely forgot about this scene
https://i.redd.it/03h6e17oqpq11.jpg
Mhm
I found one of my old W-2s with my SSN on it so I can get my CO license today
I don't want to mention that I really enjoy Elite Dangerous
Melua, we're going skiing, not skating
<:SerenaOhoho:449358389563359234>

Consistency, man!
Why use my name but Melua's screen name
<a:WutChris:431361817009192962>
`it was five`
He's four hours away and doesn't like leaving the house unless it's to skate
<@99695384296701952> how does it feel to share a color with jacq
Except for camera controls
Everything comes from a single event: "User makes click"
<:ChrisAngerDess:496162035856441354>
I need some solid logic to work with so I'm not just bumbling through on this
<@127644949884698624> and <@99695384296701952>, I want us to sit down today and flowchart the user experience ingame
It means I'm getting food and I still need to vacuum after I eat
DMV is closed
It's Sunday
Fuck
I haven't changed it
Twice as fast, too much?
I'll work on that next
Now that my camera is movable, I can change the window to scale with browser
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
which is exactly why I included a speed modifier, which I can change on the fly in the editor
I have a feature where vertical scroll with keys isn't as fast, because the map is shorter in that dimension. does this feel good or bad? it's trivial to disable
it's live
Building now, will upload
move map with WASD, arrow keys, or dragging with right mouse held down
Zoom with scroll wheel or Q/E
Camera controls fully implemented
Yup, all it'll take is toggling the "everyone can see this" on
mhm
but it's still worrying
thankfully it doesn't need to be cooled for normal driving, especially with the cold air
my inverter coolant empties itself in about half an hour
I think the big issue is gonna be car fix and name change
some time this week, looks like
*x-files theme plays*
**I'M CALLING THE POLICE**
which one
I should be able to get camera controls working
I'm gonna work on something easy today
it's not supposed to liquify, is it
I think you're leaving it in for too long
`I've got a slow cooker going
gonna be goo`

I wanted to watch subs because Kayano herself is a thing
Because Elise wanted to!
I think he might have valley'd

do you require headpats
are you alright
yes
<@!127644949884698624> I need that gif of Maria boxing
ok I'm definitely going to use my car issues as a convenient excuse to not go

<@!99695384296701952> I fixed the window issue
anyway
opening it in incognito worked fine
Huh, apparently my browser just didn't reload the program
<a:WutChris:431361817009192962>
rebuilding in a fresh folder
something broke the input manager <:Pout:400188180265041923>
building now
I changed the scale from 5 to 9, and found a new template that resizes the game window automagically
new builds take like, 5-10 minutes
Subreddit simulator is onto us
Melua is slep, and I will be soon
he actually used the lookup in <#495310550197075968>

I don't remember them
but he bailed before we did
we were *going* to yell at him about the baiting thing
to be fair
the Zionist thing
We've had to yell at Hazel a few times, and solo once or twice
Please do

And yes we can adjust it on the fly
I also want to do a reaction event to give everyone 200

I thought that was what we decided to do
Yeah that can have a real time cool down

Maria gets it because the message is sent, then Kiri gets the dess_iam alias
I can just alias rv_signup to a Kiricommand that adds a role
oh that's convenient
probably tomorrow
that's non-trivial and I have bigger thing to worry about, programming-wise
there's a big "but" here
but
possible, yes
they're very similar
can we scrap one of these


do we have a viable candidate
I've been asked to add <:BasaSmug:497598144083787796> to the server
so it causes a slight issue
but I have no idea who they're presenting *to*
none of them present as asshole
basically
The reviews are for judicial retention votes
I'm just gonna cross my fingers and hope for the best
None of my district judges *look* bad but I'm taking these reviews with a grain of salt
I wonder if there's any way to request a specific judge if I need a hearing
There are several glowing reviews for female judges, so that's a good sign
Apparently all volunteers
4 attorneys, 6 non-attorneys
I want to know the demographics of this council
All of my county judges have been recommended for retainment on these elections by this judicial council

No bikkibucks

Oh there's a *harp*

I can show you around rq before I sleep
have you visited my hoose
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Rakhi completely misses the point.
and. of course.
hm?
should I say that
`Staff are subject to the same rules as everyone else`
does that mean I can speak there
no, staff can't post unless color me maria
I will be saying `God bless our favorite dead im≈çto`
fine
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
I can also, I've seen her permit
I can't put my finger on it
Something just strikes me as really off with the whole "does everyone who watched GuP get coins too"
Serna, you're in the best position to do so, I volunteer you as tribute
Someone needs to talk to Rakhi about her Kiricoin obsession
I didn't, no

oh my god Jacq's tweets are ***so*** pretentious
I have no idea
<:BikkiWink:391790927082946560>
Maid doesn't suit me though
I want to be a tiny hat *something*
I think they were getting actively harassed over there
"pestering" was his word
But now he's bugging them about not doing it, on here
He submitted an ask to someone who does that sort of thing, which is fine
Jacq is now bugging an artist about a free drawing to satisfy his fetish
how expensive is it
I'm so digging it
it loses the 10 because of Trap Tower

It's not worth it here
Yeah I thought the same thing
Omegafriend is Zzyxzy
That would be alphafriend
Why
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
on the internet
in text
yup
That's not even where the thermal paste *goes*
***IT IS***
IS THAT
No, next issue is a warn
The.doc is outdated
Didn't R make a drive version
I just wish they'd stop filling nsfw with their fetish but we ain't got no rules against that so I just have to brood quietly
Because this is absurd
I'm prepared to start issuing formal warnings
Absolutely
I'm not hearing you say no <:ChrisSmug:273373218365243392>
And the last one was along the lines of "don't do this, it's creepy"
Literally the first message I sent in that chat was "I do not consent"

Same
In one direction
He lives 4 hours away
Jacq effectively invited himself to my and Melua's date, and added us both to a group chat to "discuss plans"
Jacq *is* skirting around the rules, and I'm tempted to make a formal complaint over him forcibly adding me to a group chat
ggez
just replace the one on the new subreddit design with that
that's the only valid invite
ewvbjUj
We vote on the 6th
where is the widget even used
I've disabled the widget
via widget
or
yup, discord exploit

:BikkiWhoops:
reason for Jacq's warn, I forgot about our protocol until just now because it's been so long since we've had to

I'm betting there's a new exploit
let's see if that helps
I've disabled invite creation for everyone below staff
so
No, something is creating new invite links

Someone not on mobile should ban that second one please
Pretty sure I left over the transphobia *before I hatched* it was that bad
It used to be the official subreddit discord
I'm biting my tongue *so hard*

I could have potentially sent lewds to a six year old
admitting to being underage on the internet is a horrible, horrible thing
hey you're not allowed to use that emoji anymore
well, that's a given
I want to yell at transphobes
I don't want to yell at nice people
but you're nice
I've been "sir"d more in the last two days than in the entire previous month
there's only so much dysphoria one girl can deal with without needing to yell at someone <:NononPout:454088299963875349>

he'd fit right in
how does he not like valk
*so badly*
I want to see him pop up in departures
letting it die leaves a bad taste in my mouth, but it's the better option I suppose
showing a complete and utter lack of improvement
he's been under the radar, and has resurfaced to make inflammatory comments
but it was pre-Kiri so we don't have warn logs
this is *not* the first time he's said this kind of bullshit
yeah, he's claiming that he was "just pointing out a typo"
for Scrmz, this is the statement in question
it's the fucking "oh but lol I didn't actually mean it like that"
typo my ass, and that was *definitely* greentexting
I really, really don't like the idea of Rukia getting away with blatant transphobia by using an incredibly copout excuse
can someone that isn't me *please* call him out on that bullshit explanation
they were typing for a while just to say that
<@!127644949884698624> Rukia in <#336297808221044736>
not anytime soon I don't think
Yeah, eventually

but it's a trivial for loop, shouldn't be too hard
it'll be a hot minute

pretty sure, actually
probably
I can probably write a script to rename the emoji too
oh that's a good idea
Serenacon was my idea and it was so good that I'm wiped
she can vouch for me
and did, to Melua in private
I *so* wanted to call him out on that too
got it
so public is the no-go zone
I will avoid
if you would honestly rather not be teased about it
This seems like a well thought out idea, it's got my vote

it would raise the highest tax bracket by a bit

I have a serüÖ±er ready and waiting for Melua to get home
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/terrafirmapunk
<@456226577798135808> perhaps
who's interested in terrafirmacraft
done
It's bothered me for a while but I always forget to ask about it
I was just looking through our channels and noticed it at the bottom
Jacq just left again
I don't actually have those on Kirichan, they're from before logging started
but what will we need imagedump logs for from 9 months ago
jokes aside, if you want that as a reason to *not* delete, I'll accept that
oh here's another reason to delete it <:MariaKappa:396363198347083786>
What's the reason to keep it around?
There's absolutely no reason to keep that channel in particular
I'd like to make a motion to delete the channel to avoid clutter.
what happened the last time we tried to delete <#419319372797050880>
What, 98 not liking things?
<:ChrisAngerDess:496162035856441354>
I believe the decision was that she neglected the duties
`it looks so gooooood`

New debit card is in the mail
Jobs done, bank next
Government office, I guess
Oh god I just noticed the framed photos of Trump and Pence on the wall
as is bibliocraft
that's on the list of cuts to make if needed
mhm
with Equivalent Exchange
was  it an old one
like every other skyblock
except for me
and since it's a server, world size won't mean much
but it's an idea
those generally don't interest me for very long
oh, a skyblock type thing
if not, we can find something else
this is our best bet for "modded minecraft that everyone can run"
that's my TFC experience too
we're going to slowly remove things until you can
before cables existed
oh also an early release beta build of Industrialcraft 1
mine was the OG buildcraft
I think the last time I played TFC was before NEI, JEI, or TMI existed
I was actually part of the first wave
same
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
buildcraft gears can be made on TFC anvils
delete the TFC and addons, and add tinkers
yes, easily
***FUCKING LOGISTIC PIPES***
and, R might like this
this one has TFC *and also Immersive Engineering*
the TFC tool system would make it hard to integrate tinkers
AoE does not have TFC
use a prebuilt until you can build your own
<@!127644949884698624> this is interesting because it spawns structures, alleviating the early game problem
wait until I get to the starching line and get bready to race
why are our private conversations so much memeier than the general public
because the person would die
that slows things down
and beer is just bread soda
you will be creating breads through sheer existence
R I think we've solved world hunger
and in four days you will create a single bread
so tomorrow you will eat 2
how many breads have you eaten?
how, uh
how
yeah, well...

Over and over

And his name was "Lectriclord is an retard" for a bit
It was a meme or something he posted
This is the third time he's been told to do that
He did make it, it's on his channel
<@127644949884698624> lectric's video in general, check the title
yup
a lot
and there are
apparently the quest book walks the reader through the intricacies of TFC
and it's got TFC integration
I've never even heard of that mod
But it's fine for a day or two

I think I'll be needing to manage my Hibiki tomorrow
Hibiki Management and Hibiki Check
The RV channel names are the best
I hate that's how it works though
I'm aware
that's called being fired, not resigned

shame that we needed a goddamn amendment for that but woo
`Slavery can no longer be used as punishment for a crime in Colorado after Amendment A passes`
the traditionally democratic areas?
I bet those areas were the ones in/around urban centers, right?
***oh hell yes*** we're redistricting by independent bi-partisan committee according to two amendments
no, what happened
our secretary of state *also* swapped to dem
our state attorney general also swapped to dem
they didnt gerrymander enough because it flipped to dem this election, only district to switch
that went up to the airport for some reason
remember that weird gerrymandered district on the east side of denver
Oh, Melua
I'm scared now

`Polis enjoys video games such as League of Legends, and his favorite champions include Maokai and Anivia.`

`Jared Schutz Polis is an American politician, entrepreneur and philanthropist serving as the U.S. Representative for Colorado's 2nd congressional district since 2009. He was elected governor of Colorado in 2018, making him the first openly gay governor to be elected in the history of the United States, as well as the first Jewish governor of Colorado.`
Colorado state legislature retains democratic majority, so that's nice
yeah he's acting
`On August 6th, 2017, one month prior to joining the Justice Department, Whitaker wrote an opinion column for CNN titled "Mueller's investigation of Trump is going too far."`

Looking at the reddit comments for that
https://i.redd.it/626oecsqzxw11.jpg
Aren't they allowed to try to push them out? They're two competing organizations and if one thinks they can outdo the other is there anything against that?
*what*
Apparently you can pin a message multiple times

Oh my god Scrmz you're a genius
But it sounds bad
I have no idea what the quoted tweet is trying to say
there was like, one bit that *kind* of worked
that YTP was subpar at best too
ugh I just read it
Because no permission from artist
I can't add it to the server though

oh yeah
if I'm playing ffxiv
I do have an alt but like
I'm ok with the idea but that's dollars
scrmz either transfers to ultros or I get transferred *off*
the problem we'd have to solve though
because $800 is hard
the sub is hard to justify *right now* but I'm going to talk to my landlord about breaking lease
I miss <:autoleft:323759610702069770> Foul <:autoright:323759622907494411>

as much trash I talk about it
she just isn;t interested in the game
she'll be able to join ffxiv
yeah the daily limit on maple really limits the useful time
exactly
there's a 4 days free return we can activate at will so whenever you do lemme know

it's weird
apparently ultros is the trans girl mecca on eorzea

fwiw, I think allowing advertisements like that on the server is a touchy topic that needs to be handled as a group
so I didn't bother bringing it up
I told her that if she wanted to announce it, I could talk to the rest of staff about allowing it, but she declined
She actually came to me about announcing it on the server earlier
was I?
he doesn't even make a beatmatching attempt
the transitions are still ***hard fucking cuts***
but not by much
bisa's OP mashup is better than the computer generated one from yesterday
`dess_remind me 1h reason`
plus my FC has a house we can hang out in

yeah because of the not-weekly tomes too
that's it
for 5 days
1 roulette a day
and hitting weekly cap is also way easier
and tbh dungeoning in ff feels *so* much better than maple
I think scrmz and I are sold
so like, that's workable
honestly my pandora sub is $10, which I'm cancelling because work gives free spotify
I'm a hoaaarder
but mine is like, $16 because of retainers
mhm, I used the "starter" sub
there is the quick level pots
so I can senpai that too
SMN is a consistent backup job for me
Machinist was my main in HW, I can senpai
you all can meet Akatsuki Kirika

basically, pull everything between the second and third boss all at once
we can do the meme strat for <:autoleft:323759610702069770>The Tam-Tara Deepcroft<:autoright:323759622907494411>
you can make an alt on ultros and I'd happily give heal/tank queues for the doogons
But when I finished, nobody was there and nobody responded to my texts
I was invited
A bunch of girls from work were talking about getting Chick-fil-A after everyone got off
So
I'm still very unsettled by Rakhi's picture
Ok so after a few days

Any night that isn't Friday works for official meeting
I was frustrated and not suggesting that seriously
It's not obvious, I'm not dumb, and it's just this shift manager's last day so she's going hard on the "fuck you"s I guess
Not cleaning inside the steam wand

this is apparently DDLC related

I think it's *mostly* fine
https://youtu.be/hIhzibKrmTQ this is relevant to her interests

it's basically mandatory
oh no you'll have tinkers if we do anything that isn't TFC
whatever happened to <@!127644949884698624> anyway
it's more "ugh I have to do tinkers" now
and tinker's is solved at this point
tinkers wouldn't work in TFC anyway
you do deserve it!
it's more "I forget he exists until he says some inflammatory bullshit, then get angry for a bit, then forget about him again"
couldn't give two shits about his hangup on that girl tbh

you're a lovely girl with a lovely name, Melua

people are shit, religion is shit, and the only reason I haven't given up on this stupid fucking planet is, well, spite
I laughed
I thought it was intentional
I hate religion
bigotry pisses me off but I shouldn't go off like that
that's fair.
arguing with older family members who have power over you never, ever ends well

I refuse

That's the TLDR
Yorin being a shit again, I was there to temper it, we need to discuss what do
Let me make coffee
I'm still in bed but I guess
In any case, the main offense here was the namecalling exchange. As I said, I stepped in and both parties stopped immediately. I don't think it's worth actioning, as much as I'd love to get rid of this asshole
That's the line where it starts
`likeeeee the amendments themselves are literally fucking additions to the damned thing.`
I participated in the shit. Soon as it devolved into personal attacks I stepped in, both parties stopped.
Wow I wake up to Yorin doing a "both sides" schtick

That would be horribly against our philosophy

Also it would be nice to have a Kiri icon in April, Maria in August, etc
And Chris is an obvious choice for this due to her birthday and Chris-mas
Because it's December and a couple other servers have Christmas icons and I thought it would be fun to do something similar

did I really look up python docs and a stackexchange help thread to write a revenge-bot
Turns out not long, as usual the barriers in my way have merely served to make me yet more determined to *fuck this entire universe and be happy anyway goddammit*
I wonder how long it will be before I start caring about things again
I want this planet to *burn*
just found out that due to shenanigans about my hire date, my healthcare coverage doesn't start until ***MARCH***
Ugh, there's this self-loathing doom and gloom 17 year old on traa whining about how they started transitioning too late and I'm just sitting here like Jim staring into the camera
it's definitely not an event substitute
Then go for it, I can't think of everything
If y'all have reasons to ping
It's a "I vote no, here's why"
Hey
If I got an everyone ping today I'd strongly consider leaving that server
Not everyone cares about crimmis
Not everyone cares about RV
Sure
We're doing coins
I vote no
Not in the mood to clean up someone else's mess at this exact moment

Reddit hits a new high of transphobia
A *spat*
Or problems you have with me?
These are problems Melua has with me, that you know about?
I think I misunderstood
Go.
I feel absolutely fucking betrayed by someone I thought was a close friend
Melua isn't involved in this, really
Why, so you can think of way to twist your words around and make me sound like a shithead and you're doing absolutely nothing wrong?
`demands the spotlight be on her 24/7`
Because I do, in fact, have empathy
Hey guess what, if you had told me you had issues I would have *understood*
Actively lied to me
Think I'm an egotistical self-centered bitch
You apparently trust me as far as you can throw me
That's... What?
Give me one goddamn reason to not leave.

Crosses fingers

Mhm.
Thanks
Can you please do your best to talk to the people affected and fix it
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
The stupid reaction thing didn't work and I have a sneaking suspicion it's because it took three tries to do it right
Thank you Melua
Any user, at least
If ***anyone*** pings me with a problem, and it's not specifically RV, I don't want to deal with it
I put the rare chance in the config for a reason
<@127644949884698624> <@99695384296701952> thoughts?
50% for one day?
Literally blessing the rolls
I could edit the rates to give a better chance of rare cards today
Yknow
I formally withdraw my no vote and choose to abstain
And your apology does mean a lot.
very, very upset with you. As am I, incidentally, but I'm not that eager to completely call off everything
Yeah Boss, R is
Can we please talk about why you think I think I'm perfect and never do anything wrong? I really want to know why you think, or thought, that about me, especially considering that I'm probably the single most flawed person on staff
For the record, I agree with Alice's addendum on 2.
at some point in the near future, anyway
the intention was not "now"
for my sake, yes
1) Alice, I considered you one of my closest friends. You're still a friend, but I feel absolutely betrayed and I don't know how much I can trust you right now. I'm sorry.
2) I would very much like permission to extend a re-invitation to R. I may have my differences with him, and he may not want to return, but he was a valued member of the team.
3) Can everyone here *please* remember that nothing gets solved if nothing gets talked about? Please?
I have a couple things I want to clear up immediately
I was worried you wouldn't actually get to that part.
I
I *am* excessively negative, apparently.
If it was months ago, why all this present tense?
I've been talking to her about that
And I'd really appreciate not assuming that my life is going swimmingly, on that note.
So then... where did all this talk about my tiny inconveniences, and not talking about me being a huge problem, and demanding the spotlight? That doesn't just appear.
Do you, now that you're no longer full of rage, honestly think I lack empathy?
Alice, I need you to answer some questions of my own, actually.
sorry
And yknow what
I was literally opening discord to say "hey sorry for snapping at you over the junkrat thing" when R sent me those
If you wanted to talk, you would have talked to me.
You're not the one who just discovered a close friend inherently distrusts you and has a laundry list of things to hate you for, and lied about your intentions during a particularly weak point in the past couple of weeks.
For not using a server that I had no idea even existed?
And so that's a strike against me?
Am I aware of this server's existence?
the dead one that has the mods from valk and sgg?
I'm saying that absolutely nothing was stopping you, or anyone else, from making another server
and I was aware that using my server as a social hub made you uneasy, but *nobody decided it was enough of a problem to not*
I honestly can't see how a direct attack on who I am as a person can be written off as simply venting
yknow, I did venting too, about the junkrat thing. I was talking about how annoyed I was that you're a one-trick, and how I play flex while you sit there on trashboi. Not once did I say anything negative about your character traits
that was one of the ***first fucking things you said***
you ***opened*** with `she lacks empathy`
But this is straight up attacking me, as a person.
I really do.
I understand venting.
Also, why is Sparkle suddenly a trusted source?
`I reccommend recalling what Leeuh said` reads exactly like you're trying to sow seeds of distrust.
nor does your threat earlier of  `Do you still want me to say shit, Kriisa? Because that is very much what I am going to say.`
this does not seem like "looking for reassurance"
`she lacks empathy`
`if she is the source then it can't possibly be her, she's too perfect`



I'll be thinking about this very, very hard for these 40 minutes.
I can't stand to look at your name right now.
`I'm very sad to announce that I am stepping down from the moderation team. My situation in my personal life demands more attention than I'm able to give while on staff for this server. Everyone has been absolutely wonderful, and I treasure our time together.`
How does this sound?
I don't really think I need to hear more
The bots will not be disappearing.
I can write it and sign it with a notary present.
Again, difference in stakes
Kiri is an important part of this server's functionality
Kiri was an extraneous addon on Val's server
I will not "pack up my toys and go home"
I've said it long ago, and it bears repeating
I see.
So you'd want *me* to have to navigate around *you* to hang out with people
I would never deprive someone of their friends. It happened to me, and it very nearly killed me,
Even if this hadn't got hashed out, if I left this server and took my bots
I was never going to revoke your access.
I've already offered to give everyone full admin
At all
That doesn't seem like it would solve anything
That
Everyone can be Alchemists and we have our Autoscorers
Motion to dissolve the structure and just have Staff.
We now have 4 custodians and 1 Illuminati
I second the motion
but Melua was allowed to vote for my promotion, right
I have an *incredible* conflict of interest here
So this is "I'd do a better job than you!"
Right. The trap of "all of my friends have to be friends with each other"
I'd just want to retain the name and icon
I'm failing to see what the difference between a curated list on the Lulu Bus vs a VIP channel here is, besides my sole control. I'm willing to give staff full admin rights on the Lulu Bus, if that eases things
and the staff channel here is *more* exclusive if you want to claim that, because everyone here is on the lulu bus, as well as additional people
I still think that "this set of people is allowed in" is a whitelist, not a blacklist. That being said, the "Kriisa's friends" and not "our friends" is a completely valid criticism that I didn't really think about until now.
I don't actually remember why I was so aggravated by it, I think just channel clutter
If everyone did what I wanted to do, god the last few weeks would have been different
I don't have a counter for that. I feel like you should have brought it up then, but also I just... shouldn't have been doing it at all?
One of my flaws is I get too focused on my own situation, and snap at people when I get stressed.
I'm a flawed person. I know this.
I brought it up because I knew it would be a mistake, and I wanted help to not fuck up *that badly*
If I really wanted to, I would have just hit the button
and I wanted my friends to hold me back, which is exactly what happened
Boss, on the Kiri thing I personally realized that I was incredibly emotional
Everyone does not deserve a degree. The stakes are different, but I see where you're going
Everyone deserves a life, free of harassment. If a theft is to that end, I think so yes
Yes. Slightly too much, probably
Melua, can you clarify
That was *your idea*
Except I actually flexed into healer several times?
I'd make sure they stay online, that's part of "not taking them down"
Exactly
If someone stepped down because they didn't have time any more, vs a giant fight with half the userbase.
True, the circumstances of the disbarrment/resignation mean a lot.
If scrmz stepped down tommorow, I would continue to have that trust in him.
I would not trust the average user, because they have never been on staff.
If this is about me, I think I see where this is going.
If this is about R, I would trust him to be a contributory member of the community upon his return should he choose to do so, or at the very least, not destroy it.
I would trust Melua and Scrmz with my life. You too, up until yesterday. The distinction between trusting and entrusting is not organization-wide.
I think you're missing a crucial step. You're not the only person appointing staff.
That's fair.
Because `But anyway, yeah "as long as the friend circle is mostly staff please let the owner of the server that staff sits on be the owner of the hanging out channel"` has me questioning the continued truth of that part.
I would very much like to emphasize the lack of import we apply to the "owner" label.
Scrmz as well?
Let's do it now
I'm expecting upset cabal
You sure?
Scrmz and I are mostly uninvolved with those. Melua doesn't need all the pointed questions that I'm sure will be asked.
So who's going to tell the writers that R left for *very valid reasons* and there's going to be issues with the writing prompts?
I am *not* making it easy for you to replace me.
I am under no obligation to give you Kiri's configuration. Shirabe uses saucenao, with a mask in one of the pinned messages.
Fine. I'll be *checking in* around 2pm your time tomorrow.
When you're back. Let me know by 2pm your time tomorrow if you want to keep the bots. If I don't hear anything, I'm going to assume you don't trust me and that you want them gone.
Fuck me that I'm broke, right?
If I had the means, it would have happened.
I would have fucking ***loved*** to when you had your surgery scare.
Do you have *any idea* how impossible that is right now?
Alright, fair.
Bingo!
Yeah, thanks.
Well, you've got your options.
1) Bots. I keep the source code.
2) No Bots. I keep the source code.
If you *want* me to take the bots off, I can, but I'm not releasing the code.
You're not getting my source code.
Sure.
I am actively against releasing my source code in full. I really, really don't want to do that. I will give you my word that I will not rip anything off of here the same way I did Val's. This community has too many good people.
What she isn't entitled to do is ignore the person who comes in to arbitrate, and fire off a warn herself.
Off server stuff can affect users on server.
I mean, she's entitled to make a complaint. That's explicitly permitted by the rules.
"Okay, I'll get a DM from Kiri soon then" is less `warn me` and more `I guess this is happening`
After a "hold on" even
And then took direct action with very little input from them?
The intent was to have a third party to deal with stuff.
Remember when I had an issue with R, so I talked to you about it instead of directly talking action?
I'm like, 90% sure protocol is "bring up the complaint with a member of staff"
Okay, I'll get a DM from Kiri soon then
And what action are you levying against me?
Unrelated to the color.
I count once, and it was about giving your role to lyssa which is entirely unnecessary
It's "Do this."
It's not *what she asked me to do*
This is between us, why are you pinging her?
I can't say I blame you for wanting to keep me out of your channels, admitting mistakes is difficult and it's easy to just hide from the person who you fucked with. But I don't have to go out of my way to be *nice* to you while you do so.

This is a social discord for friends. I don't want to cut anyone off from their friends, so I'm not kicking anyone once they join unless they're a bigot. But I don't have to listen to you bossing me around about it either.
You're not my boss <:beatriceWtf:361624848780361738>
Or you could just make a new role underneath yours and do whatever you want with it
And then it becomes meaningless
I don't want to exclude anyone from also being cute
If you'd like me to change the name of the role, I will
Congratulations
Well, there you go, you can manage roles now
You can give people individual permissions on channels, nothing gets in the way there
So you *do* have manage channels but somethings going wrong with the permissions
I thought I gave you Manage Channels
Nope.
I've already done so. Everyone has Manage Channel permissions
I'm glad that the community is using and enjoying them, and that's really the important part to me
You could *ban* me and I'd still host them
You could pull all my permissions and lock me to nothing but general chat and I'd still host them
It would have to be the entire server turning on me, or something of that magnitude. A community-wide "fuck Kriisa" is what it would take for me to want to pull them down.
Nothing you could do would make me do that.
I will clarify.
I put heart and soul into these bots and this community. If, on the off chance, I pull them, I will have a ***damn*** good reason to do so
I am under no obligation to assist in this, at all.
Okay. That's fair.
Not a goddamn word.
I will say that absolutely *nothing* you said was considered in my decision to stay.
I care about everyone here, and I don't want to just up and leave them.
Hey, guess what, I didn't, because I actually thought about that course of action and decided I didn't want to give up all that I had built here.
You'd have to ***really*** fuck with me for that to happen.
In the situation I leave entirely, then no, but I can't see that happening
As long as I'm an active member of the community, I'd still host them
They'd be up until the server bill comes due
And if you did it anywhere that *wasn't my server* I wouldn't even know to be distressed about it.
I told scrmz because he's one of my closest friends and I want him to know how I feel about all this. I'm not running around telling people not to talk to you
O... kay?
So you got Scrmz to go around and gather intel for you?
Okay, cool. I explicitly told him.. yknow what here's a screenshot
Oh?
You are still, in fact, part of staff

somewhere in server notification settings maybe?
I'm just not talking, it's ok
I mean, sure
I mean, I said what I wanted to
Was I being a dick by pointing out that you don't have absolute power?
I don't like the implication that you think you can unilaterally remove people from staff, actually
You're not actually my boss.
I called you Boss because you were staff when I joined, and continued to do so because it was a nice nickname.
You ***don't have absolute power just because you made the server***
none of whom would sign off on that, except maybe Lyssa?
Except that would have to go through the rest of staff
Sure.
Which you used to make private channels to exclude me, which I can see anyway.
I did give you the rights that you specifically asked for, namely channel creation.
I shouldn't have said I'm willing to give staff full admin rights. I'm willing to give Melua and Scrmz full admin rights, because I trust them.
This is why lawyers exist.
I make mistakes.
I'm human.
With all the posturing, I did in fact forget we had a procedure for dealing with this stuff.
I'm honestly not fussed about the warn, but I am fussed about the outright abuse of power
<@!127644949884698624> take my staff roles
Okay. Duly noted.
You're there because people there are your friends.
Because you are. Doesn't mean I'm fucking happy about it.
okay see I actually like that one
that's alrighty
The latter, hopefully. I've been thinking but any ideas I'm able to come up with are lackluster
<@285555416056856576> Now is about the time to start talking about plans for Kiri's birthday event, we had SerenaCon, #general-hibiki, and others so I'd like to do something fun, visible but not too disruptive
it's added, but to add it to the list means we'll need to toggle pinging to every other one
She has gone behind my back to try to poison my relationship with my girlfriend over assumptions about how bad of a person I am.
I am no longer comfortable with her joining staff in any position, moderation or otherwise.
None of the following will be reaching Alice, this is for server staff only.
That seems like a valid concern, and an acceptable way of dealing with said concern
I had an epiphany and it turned out to be right
I added "Manage Messages" to Kiri's permissions so she can actually delete user commands
Gonna keep an eye on

You got your break, congrats.
Which is no guarantee.
I'll keep it to the Lulu Bus, if I do decide to be public about anything else
Not right now, no
I'm going to read that as genuine, and not more passive aggressiveness regarding the short length of time that I've known her.
I'm an asshole, whatever
I'm tired and I want to spend time with my girlfriend after driving two days to do exactly that
If we're getting Alice involved I want to save time and just say I'm the asshole like we always do
Look, I just finished a 37 hour day with a 3 hour nap. I don't want any more drama, I'm probably not making the best decisions.
First of all, no, you were not asking for a favor. You were being passive aggressive about what I said.

Secondly, I had been talking about my drive *a lot* and I'd think at least a couple people would be interested in the conclusion. If I'm being arrogant or presumptuous in that assumption, then please tell me.
Hey <@99695384296701952> if you got a problem with me, I think you're supposed to take it up with Lyssa, not be passive aggressive about it in public. I shouldn't have responded to it, and I'm sorry for that.

For SerenaCon 2k19 I can totally have Shirabe automatically delete messages from people if their nickname doesn't have Maria or Serena in it
But I wasn't thinking straight `haha Kriisa's gay of course she wasn't thinking straight`
I think maybe we both could have tried de-escalation
They were the one taking everything in all the wrong ways, you were fine
I still posit that You Did Nothing Wrong
They have yet to actually show that the conversation was shut down.
```
Action requested: be more self-critical in how situations are handled and avoid shutting down conversations because you personally do not want to be part of it.```
This isn't a complaint, for a few reasons, but it might explain why I was so eager to `not deal with this`
I'll also point out that in an external discussion (that led to this) Alice repeatedly invalidated my feelings on the matter of "this person feels like they're just trying to waste our time and it makes me upset"

Sent this to Melua too.
From Illi:
hey kriisa, this is a formal complaint about neplatune/zerona because of his behavior in ignoring constructive conversation instead of just echoing his own points and not listening to anything that contradicts, generally having an air of condescension toward anyone who disagrees with him, and attempted emotional manipulation through self deprecation

But since it's a draft I figured I'd get your opinion
Yeah I really wasn't sure about it
Rough draft of announcement

This time it's for real.

Possible candidates:

Wanda (probably not)
Chris
Meta_mahn
Scrmz (big ol question mark)
Kerrik (probably not)
I'm intending on doing it tomorrow, unless you have anything to input
I can't take this
The server is outgrowing me, I guess
<@285555416056856576> I'm intending on stepping down from moderation into a purely bot administration role. I can't handle these constant stupid debates about assholes not understanding why they're assholes, being yelled at for doing my job, being in between  Alice and R, combined with real life stress

That's nice of him <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Just noticed Joe is actively funneling people here
yeah that's very reasonable
**DESS.**
*slams fist on table*
I wonder why Joe was so worried
Hm
Sketchy download?
What link was posted that Joe was concerned over
And was very much "it's too early for this"
I literally woke up to that
Yeah that's why I didn't say yes or no

Its not happening to any of my other servers
This influx of bots is really suspicious though
Maybe not, or maybe she can tighten up when she's staff, who knows
She seems a little passive, which is my only real concern with her
Oh yeah, Wanda
The stress is incredible
I'm homeless, I have 7 days of shelter at a transphobes house
2) *loud screaming*
1) Nara, Scrmz wants to come back, Meta and Ikxi come to mind
`I'm slowly dying`
Super able to do anything about them
I'm not
Yeah and Maria
Ooooof
I'm deleting it
Can I delete it please
I really didn't want to see this today
I'm conscious and available, for what it's worth
I'm fucking done with dealing with shit right now I literally do not care what happens about anything
Oh wait no, 9
7 hours from now, if memory serves
capped off by a shit saturday
it's be a shit week
yeah I'm getting evicted soon and Melua has left for work
üëÄ
if he doesnt get lynched
we need to leave pats alive
<@456226577798135808> can we kill you
can we kill ***FINE*** tomorrow night
Hey scrmz
<:ShirabeThink:461322366010654730>
I believe in you
do it to your taste, Fine
fug
oh it might give me away
that I refuse to let her have in tabletop
shot by her own anti-materiel rifle
yes, but how
`she knows too much`
ibu gotta die
are we allowed to use this channel whenever or just at night
we are `one and the same`
oh my
<:photomiku:442959133919019008>
I'm done being subtle. Scythe to the chest.
ggez
kill sag, we vote to lynch rem
right?
and win
we lynch the last with our majority
we kill sag, leaving three
so pats dies. leaving 4.
`GAMBIT SUCCESSFUL`
<:plateletSalute:467756515579789342>
Slice shirabe with an ornamental fan
lets do it
I think it's worth the gamble
so do we do a fan slice in a bid for pats? he was the one pointing fingers at me so that might be him trying to make it even clearer its me
might paint a bigger target on pats, or might backfire on me
`if we slice her with her own fans that'll make it really obvious it's someone related to the tabletop campaign`
shirabe then.
true
leave pats alive, he's safe
okay so Shirabe today, Rem tomorrow
exactly
just let it happen
don't fight it
Let people who want me dead lynch me, if it comes to that
yknow what we could do
I didn't even know they were playing
she ain't sayin much
So do we murder Shirabe tonight then
Serna is 21
According to the dubious timeline
<:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>
which we don't want
it made everything exclusive
we've already had this discussion
<:NononPout:454088299963875349>
stupid discord limitations
you're only supposed to have one color me at a time
the world must know the Gospel According to Maria
no, do it *loudly*
if you can snag it first, be our guest
who doesn't <:SerenaSwag:345583635795148800>
God bless our favorite dead im≈çto

That should be fairly straightforward
That would require a rework of her storage and construction. I'll see about adding a cooldown of some sort, but I'd like to point out that this is a problem not inherent to Shirabe, and more with how she's being used.
Motion passes
If you can get two more people to sign that petition, sure!
Roger that <:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
<:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
I'll add a keywords link to Kirichan when I get home! Anyone who knows where to find them, please DM(jii) me a link. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm also soliciting ideas for additional functionality for Kirichan and/or Shirabe.exe! Having a custom platform to work on has the potential to be very powerful, but I'm not quite sure what's wanted around these parts.
<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
Mhm! Much to some people's chagrin, <@263983345669505025>
As a team, we've discussed the various gacha games, and we decided that there's no real reason to ping an entire group for that. It'd be limited to events (every 2-3 weeks) and getting pinged every time someone drew a 5*. For these reasons, GFL, FGO and the like will not be getting distinct ping groups. XDU has one because we're a Symphogear server, it's mandatory.
the only names I recognize are alice leaving 100000 times when we were having issues with the join link
Added!
Also not a bad idea, I know that happens often.
Indeed. Motion passes!
What is the use case for the OSU group?
oh that's a good one, I'll sign up for that even
Done <:RecruitSalute:440719325306028032>
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
is that you making a suggestion, or you telling me to add it
Oh, if anyone has any additional ideas for Groups (ie XDU, Overwatch and Anime Club), please let us know.
Yeah it's built into Kirichan but I have it disabled, mostly because of the issue Chris mentioned. Even on a server with *much* less people it got pretty spammy
not sure though
I think there are websites that sync it up
I would absolutely love to sing goddamn
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
We have an XDU channel, try asking someone in YameteTomete about it
Yes.
A lot.
The reddit RSS feed likes to break.
Pff I'm fine, we're having a discussion about solutions to the color problem as we speak
But yes that is a good idea
Ibu you could ***not*** have picked a worse time to complain about colors <:NononPout:454088299963875349>
`Do you remember?`
<:BikkiPadoru:516719629784055826>
<:HibikiPadoru:516438720082346004>
<:padoru:516438720082346004>
I think I've heard of it, vaguely
<:ShirabeThink:461322366010654730>
We have yet to approach or be approached by anyone, but I'm not against the concept
that'd be very hard to read on light mode
What color would you be proposing
And is way better than Fred <:NononPout:454088299963875349>
Kiri does all sorts of things
I learned from the last one
I have *plans* for the quote engine, actually
but I never got around to floating the idea past staff
I'd actually been thinking of making a Hall of Fame channel where any message that gets a certain number of reactions gets saved
very slightly bigger audiences, and a risk of rules mismatches causing conflict
I personally wouldn't mind that particular partnership, though I wonder what exactly each of us stands to gain from that
Alice is not the overarching authority, you'd have to ask all of staff
oh yeah I gave Kiri to the 3HZ server for them to snazz up the place
om?
this is why we ban the slur, for the record
like, the person, the real life person, was called that.
pretty sure everyone laughed about it
one of our users got called a tr*p, and no moderator action was taken
like, Madoka's discord is an *absolutely not*
we would definitely have to poke around the communities before even thinking about parterning
<:pika:519520868116725762>
flip, flap, flip, flap
alright, did you want a different color from Maria or is same color ok?
I could have sworn we did, huh
<:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
dess_color fca1ef
<@483865763837378561> since you're the only person with the Praelati color, would you mind if I changed  the color to something brighter? Color in mind posted below.
yeah
did I ever get my <:AngerDess:535188304165994506>
<a:KirikaMegadess:502935599238479872>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Which tbh was just an excuse to get the Kirika album art for a few weeks
If confusion is a legitimate issue then I will concede this idea
It's weird seeing your icon without Gay Uwu next to it
<:HeadPat:388949660892397588>
I like them the most but current Bikki is GX
So we'd just use the GX ones until we get XV ones
And the album covers are usually similar within the season
We used to do seasonal icons, I think it might be something worth doing
Oh yeah Shirabe was the 16th
Is Basa March?
Pretty sure it's Shirabe then Basa then Kiri
<@285555416056856576> hey, idea for server icon. Since we're just using album covers, could we use the album cover of the person with the next birthday?
I'm not sure Melua wants to subject herself to reading 100x hibiki x OC fics
Alright, we have a new emoji
<:ShirabeThink:461322366010654730>
testing inline <:TonyEyeRoll:580561435495497729>
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561435495497729>
also
*squints*
***NO***
NO
hardly any use, that one
<:PharaDance:336657302914596866> is a contender
what shall we remove
:ToniNotAmused:
That's actually a good idea, with the caveat that *most of the ones we have would look like garbo inline*
And I'd be on the hook for "server premium" which is absolutely no-go
which is directly against the spirit of the server
Also Mudae has premium tiers that you can pay for
it doesn't seem like it's really... necessary
However
this one has an actual game, so that particular criticism isn't really valid
also featuring husbandos.
it's a giant waifu gacha, apparently
adding something to the self-assign is actually a lot of work
<@&558739031291199509>
<@184766091363352576> you now have Color Me Serena, sorry for the delay <:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
I will do it right now
Alright, I can get right on that when I get home <:ChibiSerena:391938615363502083>
<:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
Don't give me credit I don't deserve
I actually did forget because of the whole server boost thing
I'll get on it later
For now, I'll say "not yet" but definitely soon‚Ñ¢
We haven't discussed what to do with emoji, considering their spoiler potential is limited
It's okay <:SakuraHeart:591986908192702486>
It's good, and we'll probably use it soon!
Then not yet, and please spoiler tag XV things outside of the XV channel
Is this from XV
congratulations on your new Color Me Serena role
Oh, I heard about that
Done!
Sure
:BikkiOhNo: is my suggestion
Looks great to me! What do you want us to call it
<:bikkimoji:586336619045322753>
<:ElfneinWeld:497869710654963723> is now on the server
is <:ElfneinWeld:497869710654963723> here or on my server
... wait
art is fickle
j/k, do whatever ideas you find
Shirabe!
*slams fist on table*
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
If you've got inspiration, we'll take any Custom Lily Emoji
That would be awesome! I'd be drawing some of my own but *someone* has my tablet
then no, unless you get permission from the artist
isn't that fanart
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
The answer to "how many Chris emotes do we have" is now, and forever will be, ***not enough***
I'm in a much better headspace right now, so if anyone wants to drop me a timestamp or a screengrab I'll go ahead and make the emote from scratch
I'm not sure it would scale down that much
<:KirikaSpook:602224871585480776>
In like, a week
I can do that!
Oh! Yeah
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I didn't wanna be too bossy
crop it into just the faces and that would be amazing, actually
that's way too  cropped out
ask me again when I'm done adding features to Mariabot <:laugheline:454887887847030814>
<:ElfneinThink:605194207166070794>
hosting the bots does cost me money but I've worried about asking for help keeping them online for exactly that reason
I'm not with my PC for another week
I am actually busy again this time, for the same reason!
Might be worth a shot
If you increase the brightness of just her eyes and smile, they'd stand out more at lower res
Ha. Ha. Funny, completely original joke, said to a light mode user.
Default color doesn't override, and white would be invisible for light mode users
That's literally not able to happen
Wavy effect around her
Oh yeah and there's that
It's way too low quality
Kirichan can, it's just awkward to have polls in chat on a server this big
(that's me!)
did you save the 4 that Melua and I cared about the most for last on purpose
*there* we go
I vote the Chris without the swirl
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
Why are there no DMJii padorus
otherwise it'll be too low detail at small res
try to crop it the same way as mine, too
<:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
<:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>
Because there's three of themm
Never talk to me, my sword, or my dagger ever again
I propose
Idk something about three of them like that tickles my funny bone
`never talk to me or my daughter again`
To fudge the numbers and prioritize fun and a good story over the Rule Of RNG
That's why DMs have a screen
What's wrong with fourth
And Chris-mas Cheer was so goddamn sweet I need more of that in my life
The Armory was entirely my idea and I'm incredibly proud of how silly it was
I think the Chris-mas Cheer event was the only one in recent memory that I didn't help come up with the idea for
~~normally I just whisper my suggestions sensually into Melua's ear but she's asleep and I don't want to forget~~
DMJii+HibiMiku server event for Valentine's Day? I say those two specifically because of the whole "they're canon" thing but maybe an art channel for ships in general?

one of the reasons, yes
that's just for the one desu
not at all dragon
which will be explained as they get set up
Many things
she might come around for ***very special occasions***
no desubot is something else
she's gonna be super helpful
Kirichan is indeed a bot
so don't be mean
if that particular command gets overused I'm gonna have to disable it

Ryouko is sticking around for a while yet

Shirabe.exe is my girl, Kirichan is just her girlfriend
If this was a small personal server, yes absolutely
that I'd like to avoid if at all possible
Bot saturation is a very real issue
But but but
Kirichan and Shirabe.exe should be the only ones we need. *Should*
So expandable!
Something I wrote myself!

I suffered through the first two episodes of gaogaigar before telling her it was too much
the person who got me into it *really* likes mecha
I was also hesitant because of the mecha thing
calling it a magical girl show is what got me to watch it in the first place

Welcome <:mariaWave:409855829941157888>
Kiri does a lot more too, we played trivia earlier
the intro bot is Kirika, Shirabe handles a lot of our utilities and Maria does our server gacha <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:concerned:288512422912720896>
Also the bots aren't coming back unless something specific happens
I did write a module for Shirabe that lets users pick their own colors, like any hex code you want
Also no way to get my colors back
I just realized basic discord join message

There's a lot of overlap, true
this is more for physical objects
Writing content would be better served in the <#357682999300718592> channel, in the future
<#336297674707828747> is for image dumps, I got in trouble once for a DMJii overload elsewhere <:NononPout:454088299963875349>

That, but lesbian harem
`best scene of season 1` for a reason
With her B-side belting and noise surrounding the Tokyo Sky Tower
I'm like 90% sure Mega Deth Fuga was what she used in the best scene of season 1
A classic
It's her bread and butter
So I swapped to Mega Deth Party
One of mine kept falling off if it wasn't just right
Let me know how stable your Mega Deth Fuga rockets are, if you go with that config
The nendo is one of my favorite Chrises tbh
They're kinda small
I had to leave mine behind but they're like $50 so I can get another after I move
That's because it is

Don't a lot of them not get to pick their outfit? I remember that being a sticking point in KLK
And it's hard to tell the difference
Drunk people give amazing advice, and awful advice, but nothing in between
1/7 Bikkis are pretty great though

I'm tempted to say no
that's a good question
<@316755282716000266> I really like the rapid convergence, personally
I think there's a distinction between realism and aesthetically pleasing artwork
Looks alright so far, what are you seeing that's bad?

I really want to say something lewd
is that bad
I've never built one of these before but it was really fun!
Kiri mug for scale

mine is HG
<:laugheline:454887887847030814>
my adhd isnt playing very nice with all the fiddly bits so I can only work on it for like twenty minutes before wandering off
i will send pics when it's slightly closer to done
I have a head and an arm!
it's really neat how everything just snaps together and it can still be articulated and posed?
I was advised to try building one to prepare for the Chris kit later this year
i am building a *gundam*
The doujin itself is actually in the mail
This sticker is a lewd douhinshi cover
So tiny!
I'm not into that!
Ohno
I don't have enough hands for this
Wait
And the other is Aisleigh and also Sabriina
Yes, thankfully
My hand is waaaaay too shaky for that, I'm super impressed
That's *really good*
Holy shit
she looks like she could be in nichijou
Fancy
Hot damn
I remember having an xbox game too
line em up, knock em down
I was *devious*
because I had spent the previous week getting all the boys interested in bionicle
we were some of the most successful capitalists
so me and my friend sold "how to write bionicle" booklets
in third grade we had to make a shop for a social studies thing
I think I had the red one
headpat
little tiny baby!
you were born 10 years after me
ho my gawd
I didn't play it much
I remember something in browser
Mata Nui Online Game or something
I wish I could tell you, kid, but the last I owned bionicle was before you were born
melua is my fiancee and as soon as I mentioned bionicle she came running over
So when do we unpause
Thank youuuu
I need heart and miracle crystals, apparently
Waiting for 9 right
Game sucks, I don't blame you
Just got there

can we have a couple more miracles please before we move to red
i got 5 gigas one before that
I'm down
thank you many much
god bless
yeah if you don't wanna, stopping now is a-o-fine
all for rage, hands up

<:blmlove:522649271279812608>

Any more of Chris in that witch outfit or is that a one-off
I realize this Kerrik, and that's the best part
I'M IN HEAVEN <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Yes yes chrisbasa is good
Nah just surprise me
<@263983345669505025> We need some Chris up in here
I'm making a "rekt" reaction for my serber
I guess I could also use a already-beat-up bikki or basa
That's a shame
Wow did I ask for something you don't have
rip
Preferably Garie
<@!263983345669505025> I need a picture of one of the Autoscorers in the middle of getting punched/kicked/otherwise beat up, got something for me?

For now, but there will be need for more
same thing, different decade

that chris shooting Bikki is actually perfect thanks much
Now I kinda wanna see Bikki and Kyokochan playing the pokky game
*squish*
<@166040595465240576> go for it, I'm searching for Jii right now
Unless you really wanna do it that is
I'll try that rq actually
I'm using this as a base and it's mildly terrifying
Thanks for the assistance
Yeah I'm thinking that
That's a *CONCERNED* shirabe
Full body not required
hmmmm. If you have *any* OVA Jii with an excited expression facing more or less towards the camera (a bit to the side is fine) I can maybe do something with that too
I *might* be able to make that work
It's perfect except for her expression
Oh aight <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
VERY PRECISE NEEDS HERE IM SORRY
excited or embarrassed is ideal
I need full body unfortunately q_q
You are an integral part of the artistic process and I thank you
More along the lines of the zesshoushinai
better idea. <@!263983345669505025> Chibi Jii, stat
No promises, but an attempt will be made <:chris:431225538120515586>
got something for me? I'm assuming several somethings
<@!263983345669505025> I need a good action shot of <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>,preferably with no/simple background

<@263983345669505025> Top 10 DMJii pics, go






Should I dump the LINE stickers or do people already have them
As the minimum, can go all the way up to 100% as you can clearly see
0.01% dess chance for maximum rarity
I already pushed the updates for busy servers, just sayin
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
this green is ***SLICK***
that's the limit of my ability there
I can maybe get you a fake ID, maybe
if you give me approximate timestamps I can go through and rip exactly what you need

new color, check it

in that order of preference

little images you can send to people
there's "stickers" for a bunch of different things, anime or otherwise
Official sticker pack
it's a chat app
those are stickers from LINE

Maria's hair is... not that.
The surface of a solid formed by rotating a parabola about its center axis
No, I'm well aware what a parabolic dish is
What?
That's...
Where did Maria learn about parabolas tho
Excited DESS!
I think the Lulu plush was the first.
This collection has been with me through 4 states and 7 different domiciles
Although I've been meaning to swap to white, pink, and green.
My keyboard is blue orange and red, and my mouse and headset rotate between the 3
Oh, and a Kiri-chan sticker skin for my phone
I think that's everything?
Lapis pop, Lulu and Jinx figurines, Chris nedoroid, Mami-san figure, mini Krile from FFXIV, Corrin and Wooly Yoshi amiibo, Rocket League pullback car, Lulu and Rathian plushies, two hand-made (by yours truly) scalemate plushies, two Kiri-chan acrylic keychains, a teensy Pearl from a blind box, aaaaand the Mirrors Edge Catalyst statue.
I've got....
It *IS* a Lapis pop vinyl!

That I happen to own.

How dare.
She believed in you, and you let her down.
Igalima Chris!
Gungnir Chris!
wait til they see this iconic moment

My friends were both super hyped about her new style cards in G
Damn, S1 style card
Apparently
It was explained that it's a Chris "masu" or box/square
it's a Chris masu!

She shouldn't be treated like that <:sadfrost:336655265816641539>
Same, except for the uncomfortable ones
"Yup, this is definitely fabric."
*almost* as good as smol hat.
Feat. Color Coded Neckerchief
Can't punch those mountains. Still second biggest though <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
She deserves happiness.
Happy Chris is always the best Chris, no matter the outfit

Aw, was hoping that was a gif

Chris almost convinced her to get a tramp stamp but Basa put her foot down.
No, she just wanted a tat and Kiri-chan convinced her to get a butterfly
or maybe those pants just ride *really high*
her navel seems a little low
That tat is now headcanon


Kerrik apparently doesn't do the true lewds
marvel at how well it's sorted

<@263983345669505025> Got any sleepy Maria-san before I head off for the night?

**big spike**
*DAINSLEIF*

they got ***big wing***

I can find IGNITE tho, that's what, ep 6?
they've all got the wings and leggies. *maybe* the leg part is different but that could also be the angle
https://puu.sh/Acw6I/0cbf07797b.png
K2 is getting in the way here but it also looks about the same thing
https://puu.sh/Acw5q/f21b29c8d7.png
So that's pretty much the same. En route to Ichiaval

I'll look for G Ame no Habakiri
maybe?
I *feel* like the only difference is between seasons, and IGNITE
need more?
Only one I've got immediately available
Ame no Habakiri, GX

Alright I'm cutting you off, didn't you drive here

the event is starting today

I was planning on Yukine and Akatsuki for solo and friend play but with no scythe I might do Kazanari instead <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Apparently not
>implying i can do anything that isn't wait

Just did some looking up, apparently they didn't bring that scythe forward from 4U
I have no idea, no PS4 <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Chris should definitely have three bowguns and a gunlance all at the same time though
who even is this though
Much better.

One mo
oh hold on i didn't see those
here you go, complete with descriptive filename
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
this one fit better imo

Him: "I'm bored, wanna play a game or watch something?"
Me: *responds with that*
I also made this, because my friend is taking way too long to watch G
much better.
Ultimately, you're the artist so all we can do is offer suggestions, and I personally will be happy with whatever you decide to work on, buuuuut DMJii is simultaneously love and life so keep that in mind <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
This is true, but the context seemed to imply the futa-yuri do-er
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
As far as I'm aware, there's content equity between the two
to her tumblr
dropped a link in NSFW
I mean if she wants to keep doing Dikki/Miku I ain't gonna complain about it
Don't forget Pleased!Shirabe
Lily, or someone else

You could totally be Carol with https://monsterhunterworld.wiki.fextralife.com/Sectored
closest I can see
https://monsterhunterworld.wiki.fextralife.com/Wrath+&+Rancor
I wouldn't doubt it, lemme check
Yeah, both pokies come with shield
We need mod support so wyvern fire gets an attack card
But lance leans a little too heavily on the shield imo
She does use the cape as both defense and offense, a case could be made for charge blade
Although...
I don't think any of the weapons with shields really fit, but anything else probably
Would Maria be dual blades?
But between all 3 ranged weapon types + gunlance being Chris has a lot more variety
Yeah exactly
(Don't tell anyone how easy it is, I like feeling important)
I'm best with images but I dabble in A/V
Most are suppliers, I'm the one that turns them into other things
<:MariaAgent:278546060849184769>
See? SUNSHINE.
Given who you're pinging, I think I know the content of the thread
Hmm, good point
Shirabe doesn't look happy with any of this though
So would it be Alpha Style 6000 Rebirths?
One of those is your friend unit though, so I wonder if the bug would dupe that unit for Extra Bonus Jii
That's a lot of Jii
Advent lets you have 5 units
Oh I just had a thought
My PvE team right now is triple Kiri-chan so I think we would all appreciate some Bonus Jii
Bonus Jii in the middle of the screen at all times
I wish I had Trip's bug
Not nearly enough Jii.
I do need more Jii though.
Lots of DESS

For the "Don't Dess" shenanigans
I should see if I can make a version of that with Kiri instead

No, glass doesn't smash, but a small crater forms around me
That's a good alternative
I usually do it in a Genjuro voice
I really really really prefer the Japanese title over the translated version, it's more fun to say
Amended.
*Senki Zesshou Symphogear: Musical Lesbian Bonanza feat.* ***BIG FIST*** *GX*
Little misleading, but hey
In my defense, *Musical Lesbian Bonanza* isn't a terrible alt title
**SUNSHINE.**
My ex had been talking about Symphogear since the day we met. I, uh. May have called it "Musical Lesbian Bonanza" for over a year before finally deciding to watch it.
My friend who's finished it said "we'll watch episode 4 before I go to bed" and then we ended up binging the whole of G because she got hooked
G is really strong, if a little chaotic
Guess we got lucky
Neither of them had any problems with S1 at all
One has been on ep3 of G for a week and the other just went on holiday
I've got two of my friends watching it now
DEUS VULT.
Sounds good
Fine line, that.
Just don't be annoying.
Yeah it's early stages yet, but word of mouth is always good
Okay after I make a Chris crusade banner I need to make an SG one with that chibi
Grandiose plans to make Symphogear actually *gasp* popular
Damn, I wish I had the full image of that on my phone.
Only by coincidence, I assure you
And sometimes those skills are used for good!
But yeah I'm always down to teach nice folks how to shitpost
Me, Jii and Cypher on a boat because none of us have seen K-on
Tbh I'm really proud of myself for making the *HMAS Uncultured* from scratch in under 3 minutes
***S H E*** is already a reserved word, this is ***H E R***
Like them actually helping aim the thing?
Didn't she need Basa and Chris's help for that?
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
Yeah kinda, but I rule that Testament is just her, using the power of the others, as opposed to her facilitating everyone working together
Testament is FINALLY.png
All my attack card images are just <nameofattack>.png, except one
Kill Juliet is weird though, I love the setup for the card (all those extra scythe blades are kickass) but the actual card is usually just Kiri in the air with the blades flying out, so nothing really different across all the uses
And Blue Flash just ooozes style and class
Thousand Tears is a fun one
Shirabe and Chris both have some pretty awesome attack cards
Das a good one.
In general, not just XDU.
I would say that is *is* my favorite attack, but Serenade is really growing on me
Definitely one of my favorite attacks.
Giga Zeppelin though.
*sighs wistfully*
My PvP squad is Serenade Maria lead, IGNITE Kiri and ***S H E***
All two of them, anyway
It was *awful*
I had all of my physical single targets go to that one Fine once
High LB does give me trouble though because my max level is only 52
See I can deal with FM if the AI isn't complete garbage
She gets a proc on my Maria, I'm screwed
Burnbasa is one of the only things that I'm scared of this far down in PvP
There are so many Kiris and Marias and Shirabes that need levels, I can't go giving those sheets to Tsubasa
I have like, one decent Basa and the only reason I have her levelled is for dailies that need her
Got a nice ring to it.

They can heal any troubled soul.
It's the best.

I've got some Kiri ones from the same set too

I actually like IGNITEs way more than XDrives personally
Still good tho
that's not XDrive
is that the rainmeter thing for android
One of these days I should do that
It's just a solid bloo ain't it?
Discord should be easy to make recolors of
A+ <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
I like that drop-shadow thing you did
<@!239564932125949952> here's a closeup



*Overdose...*
rip
What are those rendered in
the hard part would be making it look good without the frame, the ladle coming out of nowhere would look strange
it's a solid color
Personally, I like the BG, but it wouldn't be too tricky to remove the BG
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
Discord's "jumboji" is the best
I think paying for name changes is a little scummy but if the demand is there, then ***capitalism***
yeah that'd be my fault, soz


Moved some of the characters to preserve the "EEEEEEEE"

you didn't do it so I had to ping *myself*

I was telling my friend how awesome the GX album art is so I feel like I should drop my favs here
*DON'T SCARE THE MIO*
*Pls Don't Scare the Mio*
Alright and here is my *Scaring Mio* series:










I'm slightly taller than Maria
My friend got this of their FFXIV character, same artist.
People who art as a hobby are wonderful.
I had this done of my GW2 character for $8.
I love disposable income
Aye. $5 well spent

My best and worst jokes are always made in that state of limbo
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
Hey, she was my favorite after season 1 but then Monochrome happened
That is not my area of expertise
Yeah if someone pings me for a Basa pic I'm gonna be disappointed <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I feel like the vast majority of my asks are for DMJii and Chris so it was definitely Maria's turn
<@!263983345669505025> Hit me with some Airgetlam Maria before I go to bed, will ya?

***REVOCS***
A relic from my debugging

So if you want a zenbubot I could arrange that
I mean, I wrote desubot myself

so obviously I made them chain together for maximum dess

and there's a configurable chance for her to append dess to any message sent
whenever you end a message in dess or desu she'll send a DESS
It's on my social server

Oh I just realized we have people here who are unaware of Desubot
and she always offers assistance
not joking, I message Kirichan things I dont want to forget

Let me tell Kirichan to remind me
and I'd have to go searching through G
it *is* almost 3 am
and then some time later I post it
someone says "We need an edit of X"
The reason I have the DESS role in the first place
That's, like.
Hey.
will always post those every time they're relevant


Is that Fate with Ame no Habakiri?

Nobody does determination holding to fist quite as well as Kiri-chan though
This is also a good look for her
*Arigato Mamu*, pixels on silicon, 2018.

It looks like Chris just got done eating popcorn and has some stuck in her teeth

Yeah, looks good to me

I took a shitload of screengrabs on my AXZ watch

Yuri = lesbian anime/hentai
You're really pushing this recipe thing ain't you
but that's dangerous because she probably already has all of it
you could also try bribing her with yuri
Provided they're insightful and/or full of meme
Even posting conversation topics would catch the Boss's eye I bet
I posted for the first time in 3 years on the subreddit
Damn straight
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/313512779116183553/447585627056373782/unknown.png
so there's precedent if you meet the other requirements
the DESS role does nothing except the bomb-ass color

I've been tempted myself. Got a project that needs done

it could be any one of them
don't you have like 600 Maria images?

there's the current season breakdown too

I liked GX.
But yeah ideally he wouldn't have shown up at all

no, that's ignoring the problem
BikkiMom was clearly not down for whatever was happening
I refuse to acknowledge his redemption
there's a difference

then I watched the first episode and it's been my fav ever since
I wasn't sold on it until that point
the thing that convinced me to watch was listening to gekisou gungnir
+ hype as fuck music
neither of those scenes existed when I started watching
it ain't good, but it's fun as hell
Alice, that's exactly my thoughts
I'm in this weird place where I know there are issues with the story and it just doesn't matter to me
Well yeah I don't think anyone believes that
Yeah just because there's a hundred doesn't mean that it's suddenly okay to have a hundred and one
asspulls aren't exactly the pinnacle of storytelling

you can on desktop if you view original and check URL
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
shirabe, are you alive?
do we want another Kiri-chan, or perhaps a Chris? If so, I can
it's XDU, did we expect something good?
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I definitely don't have those
it's in my name and everything
look
you got SUNSHINE

I've been dicking around in VR Chat as tracer because I can't upload the spoilers!Homura model I found yet

<@!127644949884698624>

that's a .png
but
The deviantart database is a few months behind for whatever reason
It's in announcements somewhere
Funny if you're in on it, stupid as hell if you aren't
Yeah thats like me linking Terepy Pipes to people who have never read homestuck
Did you really
ZENBU ZENBU ZENBU

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
except people who like to hate stuff, I guess
oh, well it's a good thing nobody cares about their comic
Wow, damn
Huh, I guess it was added to the db and then subsequently deleted
<:KiriApproval:453731003383676938>

jk, Maria is wonderful
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but... your name isn't green
that is a thing I can do, yes
I had Kanade too for a while
yes
I love it
my full roles list is a little much

4 people

it's hardly en masse
this probably also won't work for you but have anyway

all maria
***this*** is __the__ most precious image I have
Note: **one of**
posting it again because it's one of the most precious images I have
I liked it better when I didn't know
that's disappointing
One syllable, that's it?
enlighten us on the `Maria Safety Cube‚Ñ¢`
98, you're the Maria savant
now I remember
mhmm
"Don't panic" or somesuch
Oh when she yells at the crowd
`Maria Safety Cube‚Ñ¢`
at least I think it's hira
what's the hiragana above the blue circle say?
tile is apparently either „Çø„Ç§„É´ (tairu) or Áì¶ (kawara)
at all
none of those make sense
so
google only says "trout" "mass" or "masturbation (slang)"
where's the mas come from
but like
and then Eve because last name
how is that Christmas eve
I would be very appreciative
if you can explain either of the last two
this one is also confusing
this one still puzzles me
and japanese word for trout is "masu"
she's standing on a rainbow trout
oh, I finally figured out what the deal was with this image
me @ emoji sizes:
yeah
that feels like something I would do
and it was too smol
maybe I did
why haven't I tried adding that as an emoji



since at least this time yesterday
I eagerly await the finished product Joe
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>

I agree with this sentiment
I assumed you wanted her to spout gibberish
That's not enabled in this channel <a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>

ran a manual search

Like, I know pixiv is popular but *twitter tho*
even deviantart is almost a year behind on the index
It's just too massive and too active to consider, I think
I can't add Twitter to her unless saucenao decides they want to index that too, which I don't think is gonna happen
I heard you like Shirabe.exe's auto-source feature <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

*no bias here folks*
although my elfnein folder is very smol
I don't have enough of just miku or kanade or serena to warrant seperate folders
but no just Bikki folder
I have Kirichan, Jii, DMJii, Chris, Chrisbasa, Maria, HibiMiku, and Elfnein folders
My pictures/symphogear folder really needs a Bikki subfolder at this point
No I don't mind, but I know Ibu does
are you aware of this
You posted two dupes
Are they Kirichan

I haven't saved images until recently
and posted Kirichan
so I doubled down

now ***that*** is a boof. The Shirabe one above, at least

it's floof and not suffering and I love it
I'd have called you a liar
like, if you told me a week ago that I'd have made any art worth posting
that's what I thought though
it was natural for me to attempt to do so myself
so when I started to learn how to do arts
I have been wanting that emoji for *months* and never found anything suitable

ok she's back, try again

I approve
the syllables check out
you fuckin

*no tiddy in sfw*
isn't that the *only* sfw pic of Cags?
Perhaps you simply require a better vantage point. Your small stature begets a very unusual viewing angle, I'm sure.
is there DMJii too
i heard it was DESS
nah you're good
it's a little jarring and I might have a headache <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
not even annoying, more like "OH GOD SHE'S BROKEN" less than a minute after regaining conciousness
basically: ***LISTEN TO HER YOU DORKS***
she says to give it a minute and try again, so ***do that*** and if she's still borked that's when you're allowed to yell at me
if she says it's *probably* not her fault, that means either something's weird with the database, or she's actually a little bit broken
so a google will tell you what's wrong
her error codes are standard HTML request errors
for *future reference*
just ***read the damn message before yelling at me*** <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
don't change your habits on Shirabe's account
that's acceptable
... how much of that is DESS
which means I have over 200 images to look through
yeah you capped her out

<:ShirabeJii:237687217437278208>
y'all need to listen to her when she says it's not her fault, goddamn
no because I had a billion pings that ***SHIRABE IS BROKE*** so I was in red alert as soon as I woke up
I never thought I'd say this but that was too much DESS
it's a ***RATE LIMIT EXCEEDED*** CODE
absolutely none of you tried to check the error code
but damn that's a lot of Kirika
YOU DID THIS
SHE SAID IT WASN'T HER FAULT
I'd make some if I could think of something funny but it just ain't happening

I'm just as puzzled as you are
And we've previously established that Symphogear has several best girls anyway
I'm away from PC

I've made a couple of those too, that Chris is so useful
Sleepy Kirika is my mood, like, always
I already have that one saved
and the occasional earthbound-esque "RPG" sections
I was about to correct you to "read" but there's enough video content that "watched" is also acceptable, I guess

the pouting Kiri is mine though <:NononPout:454088299963875349>

Fun fact: my favorite symphogear fanart is actually Maria, not Kiri

Shirabe would look good in a suit, Kirika would just look uncomfortable I reckon

I definitely need to know what other stereotypes I do or do not fit because apparently there's 410 billion
I swear, I need like a pamphlet or something
Oh is that another one I don't know about
We already knew that

Unless this is Universe B and I got Mandela'd

<@263983345669505025> actually... Right now I think I need happy Chris more than anything else
Happy Kiri.
DESS
So that one is probably twitter or tumblr
Links actually aren't processed. Gotta embed the image
***fug***
And then DESS comes in from the left iirc
She slides in on Shulshagana first
I need Shulshagana Chris
That's Igalima Chris
<@263983345669505025> do you happen to have a screengrab of Shulshagana Chris from the OVAs
Fuckin perfect.
`is there a second copy`
I'm okay with this outcome
Oh at least someone who can appreciate it has it

DMJii love blue?
I feel like that's just, a constant state of being for me

I almost said that but I don't like that rhetoric, personally

Damn, y'all are giving Shirabe a workout today
She's awake again
*every time I fix one thing, another thing breaks*

I like the flower aesthetic on the left
`so happy`
BIKES?
it generally doesn't get the desired results
Jasmine, best to not yell at content creators to make you free content

Did you like poppi or elfnein first

I never got the whole appeal of blondes

Okay that's weird

sometimes I feel like my only friend

Go do it

I had no idea. Would it work with a regular bass though?
Wait, really?
They've all got killer bass lines

although we're probably in the wrong channel
reclaimed concentration camp symbols are interesting
lesbeaxe
trans is by far my favorite pride flag
98, the top one is the lesbian flag
<:transrath:490991510163030037>


they're alright
I'm actually not a huge fan of the lesbian colors
in case anyone missed the memo
just clearing the air
hi im kriisa and I'm also lesbian, for the record
98 meant it was news to him
*how could I forget lesbean*
there's lots of people who you don't know too well in here, many of whom are likely gay
`As long as it's in good fun and actually understood like that` is key
and yeah straight people have to be very careful with that kinda thing
People from New York aren't New Yorks
no, the people from Lesbos are Lesbian
all of the ones I can think of are reclaimed slurs, or *still* slurs depending,
... lesbian?
she's a nep by proxy?
Same girl?


<:NononPout:454088299963875349>
`why are we still talking about this here tho`
no article required
its like Big Pharma
not "the big gay"
a privilege I abuse often tbh, it's fun to say it like that
only us gays can say "the gays"
something something gay agenda

Cast, wonderful as always
But it's totally worth it
Bare thighs and snow don't go well together
Okay I can say from experience
She likes Kiri in glasses more than usual because that reminds her of me <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
She loves glasses
You should have pinged Melua too
Oh my ***god***
she does sometimes
thanks, shirabe
She's cute, that's probably why
Bikki and Miku adopted her, as far as I'm concerned
Smol
I dunno, ask staff, if I was still staff I'd definitely say better safe than sorry but maybe policy's changed
but still
I mean, nothing explicit is there
that

you can't take 9 away from 8, so you borrow 10 from the 10's place and make it 18
it's subtraction with remainders
it
but I wanted to show someone
I can't find any of them
I mean the public ones
<@!246146781832806401> do you have any of those gungnir toddler comics
<@231025503643893770> that is wonderful, thanks much

Why she sad
Please keep the dessposting to the dessposting channel
best kind of posting
that's I've Given Up Bikki
no pupil, just orange with shading
those are her Dead Eyes, yeah
oh my god
I need to make a label for sakimori cola now
`she monch`
I'm pretty fluff

what is zababaazu
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

wonderful
yeah I know zababa

<@209036464900538371> MORE














<@209036464900538371> I don't have much but here's a bit
I might need to reconsider my "416 is least favorite member of 404" now
Kizunaaaaaaa
can confirm, Luci's Kanades are top tier
she dropped her spaghetti and now she must stare
but it was too late to go back
and immediately regretted it
I was like `I wonder how this would look`
I made her sad on accident
she's still a cute
not as fancy as the rest but
and, of course, my contribution to Chris artwork













was that rain enough for you, chossei
too many requests far too quickly
she'll be fine
I broke my own robot





















courtesy of <@!193408538909868033>
G, in one image



she's just also fun
and Mariabot is practically a shitpost
remember every channel name being desu-d
nowadays my shitposts are fewer, but they're on the level of server-wide shenanigans
pre-HRT, my shitpost was ow.png and safety dess level
probably
it was actually before HRT
<@209036464900538371> my shitposting game was strong enough it got me promoted to staff

`ow.png`
now I must find the sacred
you posted that
okay see

HOW DARE
`Stand by for Bikkifall`
that's the intent












so <@!99695384296701952> doesn't feel left out üíú
I disagree
all Kriisa noises are apparently quacks
*impatient Kriisa noise*
***D

Kerrik please bestow upon us the wonderful, precious and absolutely amazing
it's not a lie
read his name very carefully, viper
which also drop another currency, Mi-cubes, which can be used to buy specific lewd arts
$10 gets you 1100 Shirabucks, still not enough for 4 things
cheapest thing in the store is 300 Shirabucks
nah, $5 is 500 Shirabucks
~~Shirabucks are the premium currency~~
but then one would just be an aggregate of the other
I wanted to call the dupe tokens "Shirabucks" but because they're specific to characters I decided against it
<:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>

dammit I forgot which channel this was

`desu`

LOOK MORE BIKKI
`maybe nobody will notice smol kirika`
after Lily, right
I heard saki
*perks up ears*
She does *not* use boorus because many of those don't have sources themselves
Twitter is unsupported, unless saucenao does it now
Shirabe uses saucenao, which supports pixiv, niconico, deviantart and a few others
and asking for free art is bad form
Luci likes doing armor designs but I also don't think she's taking commissions


excellent
30 Shirabucks for 1 hour
I guess basa is already involved because of the developer's name
what do we do with Chris, Maria and Tsubasa?
God bless
Ntw off on the left there
Kiri is death, perfect
You got lucky


precious child

that's close
hard to beat this

***I LOVE IT***
that's definitely not safe for work
thank youuuuuu
oh hey there you are
<@!263983345669505025> can we have some SUNSHINE
lots of precedent for SUNSHINE
no, that stuff is allowed in sfw
but just warning other folks
the link itself is fine
yeah
also that source is very nsfw
she's actually kind of on the bigger side, for how small she is
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

KIRIKA
Three, to be precise
I've made some modifications
oh she's so cute
...NZ75? I think?
oh yeah right by 36c
kinda meido-y
is this G36
416: "Oh fucking hell, not again"

on her face
she has gum
she is grace
she is beauty
***there she is***
NTW waaaaay in the back

And encouraged
That's okay
Just, not about lewding Maria
It's okay, I'm angry too
`TOUCH`
I used that for a whiiile


thank you!
"Kirika is such a cutie" is also a correct statement
Yess, big +1 to Chris and Kiri being friends
I like it
She looks smug

Preferably featuring Shirabe as well but not required
<@263983345669505025> I work for the next while, can I have some happy Kirika for when I get back
I see ku ri su in miku's box
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
it's not on this server
Pretty sure it's one of Joe's, actually
<:BasaExcite:391790924843319298>
Plus we're maxed out on emoji, and the obvious replacement would be to remove <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I'd have to a) get permission from the person who made the emoji or b) reinvent the wheel
Chris, can I also be a little silly fool
Kiri would absolutely jump to worst case scenario
now I'm just angry at the artist
I didn't see that before
why did you have to say that
That lingerie pic is *definitely* nsfw
Oh wow I guess I need to be here more often
Probably
Maybe
I think that should probably be in nsfw?
Owait
This is the Good Shit‚Ñ¢
YES
I recognize this Hibiki

<:BasaSmug:497598144083787796>

pew
She looks very uncomfortable
`I SEE A SAKIMORI`
<@182683872062865408> too for good measure
The knee is a little wonky but DEM THIGHS
<@193408538909868033>
I would like that coffee
Oh *yes*
but cuddle with Chris too because she needs affection
DMJii, still super lesbian for each other
that's pretty great
okay that's
*in* my DMJii
if I want Chris
but I don't know
`oh boy do I love DMJii`
and I love DMJii
I love Chris
okay see

good transition to CHRISPOSTING

Kriisa
Chris
Kirika
I thought you said Kriisa until I read it twice
`Kriisa has found a reason for Kiri`





look at this lady though
inflated sense of self worth
I do agree with Kerrik though

I haven't had a new entry in my Hibimiku folder in a while, actually
I have determined empirically that small boobs can in fact hold a boba cup if you squeeze and lean back a little bit

I can also do it IRL if I squeeze my elbows

My leggies, for instance
Smooth can just be "a surface that isn't rough"
Hell yeah it does
A smooth Kirika
You've been struck by
You've been hit by
Also, Chris
Because that's the "something fucked up and it's not me" message
I think Saucenao must be down, or something
Are you okay Shirabe
Are you okay
Shirabe are you okay

This one is exceptional
All Maria is cute
I'll let y'all pick where this goes
perhaps <#336297674707828747> isn't the best place for this discussion
indie has connotations far beyond "independent"
indie has connotations far beyond "independent"
what is this a crossover of
I'm not the one distracting her, I promise
stripey socks, good look
*SOCKS*
Ara ara~
idk about bushiroad as a whole
I have a Not Good opinion of bushimo because of XDU
<:AngerDess:535188304165994506>
Chris is very important
if it's twitter then Shirabe won't find it
I'd argue she's specifically Carol's not-bitchy parts
I think so
That's a hefty bump
Is Tsubasa okay
so her abdomen is squishing and twisting in a way that doesn't seem reasonable
because her hips are like, vertical
but Chris is especially egregious here
I wish I could pull that pose off IRL
chris's pose confuses me
That's a Good Bikki

I can make it work
If it has an API
That's incredible
Those black boots mean it's S1
This is Awful and Bad and should Not Exist
<@193408538909868033> look!
I don't know if I can augment Shirabe with this
Oh oof it's in Japanese
<@182683872062865408> Melua is calling you out
I love how they're casually being Elfnein
That's literally me

They leave more to the imagination
Why does *everyone* draw them like that anyway
They don't have boob pockets
That isn't how sweaters work!
That's incredible

It'll just be annoying
It's not gonna break anything
It lets me change settings without restarting the bot
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
this is a server rule but more to the point, it's why I wrote her in the first place, so please be conscientious
because the entire point of shirabe sourcing images is to give credit to the artist
I will say to restrict the use to things like comics
<:MeguShrug:586122984637595658>
it was a good idea, I can't take credit for it
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
just put "jii_skip" in the text box when you upload a picture
<@279341087494242304> I did it, with 18 characters
jii_skip

hrmph

Is that just ||Tsubasa selfcest||

I just re-enabled it due to someone pointing out the only victims are the artists
```
I'm issuing a formal apology for daring to post the same image twice. This was a grievous error, and clearly I should have used a browser extension that I have never heard of. To make amends, I have disabled Shirabe's auto-sourcing functionality. I hope this makes up for the horrible stress I've put you through.```
sorry for using it to make my life easier, I guess
I ***wrote the damn bot***

yeah

Also that Hibiki is amazing shoosh
Okay yeah Kiri would enjoy being yeeted
<:kyubeyhowitworks:366003507943178240>

That's a lot of dummy links
<:homete:410658578014273538>
Thanks, Shirabe
Also Shirabe takes payment in the form of Kiri-chan artwork
I've only done it once and it was an accident <:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>
God, sitting like that in a dress is such a powerful pose
Are they wearing pumpkins
She all legg
You ain't wrong
Honestly
Why would anyone let Kiri direct a movie
I literally just took my favorite echelon and wrote about them

Oh, I know exactly what you're trying to say. I don't give a single shit, that's all.
and I am under no obligation to listen to a goddamn word you say
I can dislike the art all I want
that too
because JK Rowling is a fucking TERF

Yatsuhiro was a dick to tiny tsubasa tho
it's like a button-down collar but without the rest of the shirt
oh yeah
She has a lot of hair and a LOT of floof
Look at Kanade
That's a lie
We need more long hair miku
Screw long hair bikki
Okay
it's very good floof
bask in the kanade floof
ignore the buttface
shhhhh
Shitty LiNKER and pre-all the power ups
<@246146781832806401> I know you have these already but I said "look at Kanade" and things happened
she doesn't do twitter because twitter is unpossible
She is my eldest daughter and she does her best
Shirabe is helpful!

because the aesthetic is gooood
Green waffles are one of Kiri's favorite foods
Look at her enjoying that green waffle
<:KirikaMunch:672599382670966785>
I know goddamn why
Knowing *why* doesn't make it better
The designers made a conscious decision to make her look incredibly uncomfortable
She doesn't want this

To add to the pile
More sad uncomfortable chris
But no
Smug Chris in a butler suit would have been a great addition to this
Yeah, so *don't force her into a maid outfit with a fucking boob window*
Fucking otakus need their "tsundere" or whatever
But no
It's really not fucking hard to draw a goddamn smile b
No! She doesn't want to be there!
It makes *me* upset
always fucking *upset*
Why is Chris
Fuckin dammit
God
Pramanix with the mofu mofu
And I've said this before but if anyone sees *this face* and thinks "oh my god how cute" then I don't trust myself to be alone with that person
Look, the reason they're in these outfits isn't "the others pushed her to wear one" it's "marketing knows otakus want to get horny at them"
And not profit off of making women uncomfortable
It would fit the aesthetic of the set
Just put Chris in a butler suit and make her look so incredibly smug

sorry for off-topic!
yeah my original post was tangentally art-related and then the guy who's said "why does transgender exist anyway" said tumblr was a shithole for no reason and it set off some alarm bells

you get what you sign up for
yeah it's very much a "curate your own experience" kinda place
do you mean "users"
tumblr is a platform, I don't know of anyone who's a "tumblr fan"
<:WutChris:524467717059772426>

iirc
it's like, 4 different channels
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
we will have a discussion channel for those who want to watch the raws to talk amongst themselves
this channel will have a spoiler policy of "nothing that hasn't been subbed"
I've heard a week-ish
because of the anti-linker
I'm glad it didn't happen in G
much anger
even moreso
if it turns out to be a little *pew* I'm gonna be so upset
fun fact, I was ***so upset***
<:KiriSkeptical:586406806482583556>
I was under the impression that futa is "girl with dick"
And what is the difference, in your opinion
I wouldn't expect there to be many at all
that actually surprises me
üëÄ
which is a little feature I love
she would have been knocked out for a few episodes
<#336297808221044736> please
about a kink
if you want to go in depth
barring use of "opposite," yeah I see your point
the latter is "she is a cis girl that acquired a penis"
so one is that he is a trans boy
Clarify.
I fail to see why "girl with dick" precludes a character from being trans
that sounds nice
I want Kayano to sing happy birthday to me
What is this, Kriisa Bully Hour
OI
Okay `no`
<a:KirikaMegadess:502935599238479872>
TAKE THE HAPPY BUS TO THE HAPPY SMILE VACATION
Maria's B-side in G was the OP of episode 1
Kirika is twooooo
Kirika is number 2!
My words exactly
No
Oh
God that
I think god's a girl
"Ryouko" implied that her love was a woman
it's the most personal "fuck you" move
I'm still mad at Fine over that
oh the "genjuuro 1v1's Fine and only loses because of dirty tricks" scene
<:PapikaAngery:503152497599315968>
If Kiri dies I'm gonna be angery
I prefer them to GX, in any case
S1 transformations are really nice, imo
I disagree with regression
okay also the Horrible release didn't do "SHORT STRAIGHT DIRECT" very well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbhcRKsRwFM
"sometimes
things that are expensive....

...

are worse"
it's an opinion
No, I actually really like the simplistic style
the different translation threw me off
you know how attached I get to tradition
I was lil upset
I LOVE THE SOCKS
And I think it's my second favorite Bikki A-side, after G-beat
The intro to Bikki's song is fucking incredible
Oh, something I wanted to mention
I believe it's Rebuild
She seems to enjoy the expenditure of ammunition, and I very much do as well
I want Chris to expend a lot of ammunition during the showoff segment
Is MAL a western site or is there a Japanese userbase as well
Honestly, I'm still glad that Symphogear is popular
during the showoff phase
she's gonna do some great yoyo tricks during her transformation sequence
for motion and combat, anyway
yeah Bikki having to train in S1 shows the gears don't really do anything
let's stop talking about the rapist and look at happy Miku
it's a good screenshot
I only took one screenshot during my first watch of ep 1
I don't really watch anime, XV is the first time I'm watching a seasonal as it airs
hence the followup
<:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
that's not a meme, symphogear is really the only one I'm really into
I don't really watch anime
oh, really?
symphogear does really like to lean on the "trauma isn't bad, just learn from it and forgive" thing
at all
don't like that
I
he slaps around Maria and tells her he's going to rape her
dude lost his meme status and just turned into a fucking awful shitbag after that
and Ver is already my least favorite villain because of his fucking "repopulate the earth" comment
I want Kirichris because they're my 2 fav characters by a wide margin
not necessarily far
it was dark
I'm going for "they needed something that sounds really cold, and don't know how negative temps actually work"
So it makes sense to have an impossible temperature
They literally go "wow they're fucking with the laws of physics"
oh! yeah, they didn't do those at all in S1
someone walked into frame and just... ***bam***
or Bikki knocking a bystander's lights out during her posing phase
never seen that happen
oh yeah getting interrupted
and it takes "real" time to happen
she's transforming and running simultaneously
that's actually one of the things I loved about symphogear, the transformation does take time
And the point isn't even true
S1, E10, falling with full transformation sequence



this will do for now
awwwwww
<:esiarP:488112050690588675>
where can I get bikkis?
I'm waiting on it to pop up in the show first
so hopefully yes
bikki has always gotten her B-sides in-show
have both


which one
there was, somewhere
I ended up formatting my spreadsheet such that it's trivial to add new seasons
I have wonderful news
I actually don't like her AXZ one that much
I think this is better than G-Beat
I thought it was all for one
oh that's the bikki one
All Love's Blazing won't be out til october I think
Joe mentioned it
It was in the torrent
And a note saying it's XV
Or there with spoilers
Here, please
`Chris is also my favorite but shhhh`
Kirichan exists specifically because she's my favorite
*please post more of those gifs*
no, Chris, you don't understand
please post more of those gifs in <#336297808221044736>
anyway this is <#431914167826382860>
my lesbian heart is weak
I can drool over titty as much as you, alright
excuse you kerrik
*titty* <:Megulewd:458391898361561112>
No personal attacks and we'll be fine
We are getting close to heated though, so just be careful if this continues
No need to chill
I'm going to say that so far, this conversation has been reasonable
I'm waiting until a) played in show or b) season end, whichever comes first

okay that track *is* fire
Mostly girls but I've got some bois too
I've got the *friendos*
I can't have a full meme name but I can have a fun epithet
I settled with Chris color and Kiri reference in name
Although I think Chris is my favorite character from any fiction at this point
Yisssss
That's standard for her
This isn't a "sex = bad" thing
I really like Kiri's, for the record
A sexy Chris transformation is ***completely*** out of character for her and I will be incredibly disappointed if it is
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
If Chris and Kirika sing together I will DIE
Same, Chris
Cags is a pile of archetypes he doesn't like
Genocide?
G Beat was my favorite Bikki song until XV
It's still fun to rewatch
It's my least favorite season, and it has some really shit parts, but it's still symphogear and I love it
I have that exact opinion
Ai desu yo?
Maybe call them Harmonigadgets
What if they use the girls' singing voices to power armor
Hey I have a crazy idea
The girl was already a donut, humans are topologically equivalent to donuts due to the digestive system
Kirika "knew" she was fading, did a bunch of stuff, felt guilty about being wrong and tried to kill herself from the guilt
KiriBikki was great, the bakaduo headstrong types who go first and regret later
<:dabpika:481971382104883220>
*holds phone*
Ver is an aspiring rapist???
Myself included
Looots of people hate ver
`no one hated ver`
Yeah Tsubasa got mindrekt by those gem eyes
<:ChrisSmug:273373218365243392>
Gun
Shot
She
`she shot gun`
SHE SHOT GUN
<:KanadeSit:535301654464036884>
And every frame she appears in the show
I'm convinced he does
SHE SHOT THE GUN
SHE SHOT GUN
Okay doing that for Hibiki would murder you
DMJii is my OTP and nothing else even comes close
I expected Elza to be my #1 but Milaarc is higher on the list
Millarc is already my favorite symphogear villain by far
They need to get bopped out of existence
I hope they don't get redemption arcs though
They're all neat
I'm Millarc fangirl, it's official
Like, I want Chris to shoot Millarc full of holes but goddamn she's amazing
*symphogear is* ***BACK***
I literally gasped when she spiked that girl
Exactly
Millarc is best ebil
My ruthless vampire **BABE**
You bet your ass I'm making some vampy emoji
Oooh yes
Am I going to need to make a ElfneinKami emoji
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
Elfnein did alchemy through Bikki's punch in XV.1
F
God I love that
`ready go`
And the chorus in Chris's is incredible
But DMJii are really really good
Hibiki is mine, actually
I want the flaaaaacs
It's ubiquitous, and well known
Ah yes, the ubiquitous and well known Newfoundland Tricolor
and a couple times prior to the season airing, iirc
Oh yeah she's my favorite villain by far and she should absolutely not get a redemption
Just as I'm allowed to like it, they're allowed to not like it
I'd say they're well within their rights to do that
Controversial opinion but Kiri's is my favorite so far
The leaping pose they do, I died
I died
If they try to turn her into a joke or an ally after that, I'm gonna riot
if she gets anything close to a redemption arc I will be so pissed
but she's my favorite villain
I hate her guts
I don't like her
like, milaarc is a fucking murderer but she is my #1 favorite right now
it should be said that I wouldn't hate him as much if he wasn't played for laughs
it's worth saying so that people know exactly why I'm so vitriolic
dr. ver is a fucking abuser and aspiring rapist
watching her get defeated is going to be so satisfying
she's acting in her own self interest, and has created a lasting consequence for at least one of our geahs
but as a villain backed into a corner
I was thinking the entire time "where are the rest of them"
just "oh yeah nah I bought it elsewhere"
without saying anything
and you stiff them
you told someone to buy you shit, on credit, and they did that as a favor because they're a nice person
okay <@583826941405298719> that's incredibly fucked up
hot damn
oh
https://nyaa.si/view/1161454
it should have been
Change the Future is in my top ten <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>

*fire*
but it's...
it's still in second place behind makyuu, tbh
okay I literally gasped
wait what does vore have to do with anything
I love me some symphoflac
Npnp
as in, not being streamed
I use Dopamine for local music
that's flacs bay beee
flac is love, flac is life
catsite.
https://nyaa.si/view/1018235
I'm saving B-sides for end of season
that being said, lullabye is still really fucking good
makyuu > all loaded > TRUST HEART > GUN BULLET > lullabye
if she gets a redemption she'll be my second from the bottom
she is by far my favorite symphogear villain
I'm sakimori and have been for like, 4 years
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
*hi hello it is me*
DID SOMEONE SAY MY NAME




because if Sakimori is more Fudou than Tsubasa I do not want that
okay I hope I don't have to change my name
permanently
I'm cancelling Ver
senjou
jouzai
SAKIMORI
i'm a sakimori
<:KiriWhoops:442974593498611732>
Transformation-wise
Kirika > Chris > Hibiki > Maria > Tsubasa > Shirabe but tbh I love allll of them
If miku: sad
If Elfnein: riot


<:ChrisDessPeek:604777295068266497>
oh that's a good one
tsubasa likes getting bapped by GF

<:DMJii:549819519082692608>
these are good eyes

Tsubasa songs delayed until serenacon 2k20
`male = shoot to KILL`
`if female`
And it makes my heart hurt.
And they're never going to kiss.
Shirabe has literally said, specifically to Kirika, that she loves her
<:gsad:363949694100963338>
I want DMJii to kiss but I'm fully prepared to never see it happen
I'd say it's more likely to be Millaarc than Elfnein
Does anyone have a betting pool running for who's bleeding


I like doing quick cutouts <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>


`hashire sore wo`
tsubasa
top: after I yeet the child
bottom: when I get told I can't yeet the child


we have matching gifs <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
hai
thanks
`seal control` hey tsubasa can you go pick us up some pizza, and betray your closest friends?
and we get a 4 episode epilogue
the show's climax is episode 9
bikki is luckyyyyy
I wish I was hot enough for someone to want me as their phone wallpaper
talk shit about my girl again, I dare you
üíú
am I acclaimed
that's valuable
oh
acclaimed by WHOM
<:AngerDess:535188304165994506>
ooooh that logo looks familiar
what even is it
I've heard of the symphocast
<#336297840529899522> is the place for this
please not here
please
this is heavy shit, yo
because
I'd honestly say serious-discussion
is <#431914167826382860> really the place for this
<:smugeline:600088130879750155>
that wasn't for me
dess_define contrition
my favorite gun in girls frontline is voiced by Shirabe's VA too
G-beat and the DMJii songs were also fantastic
I'm always a thirsty bitch
Can I just say literally every time anyone in symphogear says sakimori I repeat it back to myself really quietly
I was told to watch it because the girl I was dating at the time wouldn't stop talking about it for years
But yeah I trust absolutely nothing on the wiki
Okay, nice!
I'd trust that, yeah
Wiki is 100% bullshit
HAH
So it is likely false
Granted, my source for 17 is a secondary thing, not canon
Where are you getting this definitive information
Also age of consent discussion is frowned upon
I thought Kiri was 17?
basa can't aim
Do you actually want an answer
if it's ver reborn I will be very upset
genocide?
pretty sure BARK at the MOON was in there too
pretty much every insert song that isn't vocals is from S1 soundtrack
we've had a lot of S1 throwbacks this season
what's a frieza
instead of just 98%
it's 100% confirmed god power
do we need to update our Madoka Ending is Unlikely hypothesis
okay, so with this new information and returning characters
... why do they have different VAs?
could go either way
Elfnein's eyes, Carol's voice
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Because the autoscorers aren't bad because they're bad, they're bad because *Carol* is
I think it makes it better
I'm going to wear this pin at work today out of respect
So that's a very strong implication of more than one
When she wakes up there's something said about "this is the last one"
carol has always had the ribcage thing in dur da bla
hell, my parents were alive in the 80s
I wouldn't call my grandparents my "ancestors" but they were alive in the 80's
so, I'm convinced that's not an accurate translation

yeah that was mean but also oh my fucking god
perfect
it was
the conductor moves, the arrogance
because
can we talk about Carol's choreography for a moment
*so* fucking out of place
yeah I uh, kinda hated the docking
and then he said datto
I yelled "oh my god is this our datto"

it's like, a whole movie
is Final Commander caroru's song
I really hope that's not actually SSJ

God is a girl and she's got a *rockin* henshin
thanks for coming to my ted talk
I BEG YOU
PLEASE
LET THEM
LET MY GIRLS KISS
all the nods to the S1 soundtrack that we haven't heard in years
I'm loving the music
actually negative faith tbh
I have 0 faith in kaneko
and now miku needs to bust out from inside a god
because that's hibiki busting out from inside a god
I really hope we get a reversal of this from AXZ




time for a reversal
so far, it's happened twice where Bikki has been down and out but Miku saves her
I hope it's Carol(a side)/Elfnein(karaoke as b-side)
But this was the push I needed
I've wanted to be Caroru colored for a while tbh
ai
desu
yo
Her G song is *completely* different from AXZ
Like, Akatsuki Kirika? I don't see them being any more similar than anyone else's
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/117483179912331270/604131179972526093/c2f5fe1a-c1fb-402b-8a9d-075edc264c08.gif

so, subreddit person makes a good point
How are Anunnaki in Christianity
<@246146781832806401> I really enjoyed that million dollars joke
Miku, I think
Wait who's mawile


Maria is definitely jigglypuff
also
I made the connection after a while and it was embarassing to say I hadn't realized it
and then Kirika was my favorite geah for a while
my favorite non-eevee pokemon has been scyther for *years*
Yeah prelati was running with no clear threat being posed
Gamer
Hey we just fucking killed a person, a human, lets go have pizza
That's a "shut up or you're gonna get the cops on your ass"
Nah that's not a "shut up I disagree"
<@99695384296701952> I want to report armados for supporting genocide
And normally I don't support name-calling but bruh, you said in full seriousness that killing people isn't traumatic and like, I don't know what to say
Nah its "you're either stupid or young" in this case
DEHUMANIZING "ENEMIES" IS HOW GENOCIDE HAPPENS
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Dude, those soldiers that demonize the enemy *that much* are mentally sound themselves, eh
Armados that is the stupidest thing you've ever said
"killing people shouldn't be emotionally damaging"
I think Ver existed in GX for the sole purpose of having the "yantra sarvasa is broken!" moment
Tachibana Akira
It boggled the mind
I saw someone say that they loved Ver because he had a commanding presence and just
Right?
Akira and ver are both absolutely garbage and I hate seeing both of them but between the two I'd rather akira
Same
I have something vaguely representing hips and breasts!
Tsubasa is the only trained soldier and she's also the one with legitimate ptsd, yes
Let's not have a discussion about the morality of the nazis in <#431914167826382860>
<:SakiLaugh:539991687036928001>
Granted, the person I called stupid was defending genocide so maybe I'm justified
I guess I did call someone stupid earlier...
Personal insults are bad!

i'm sad that it's ending but I'm glad it's not going until it dies
I know I don't want that
in fact
I don't think I want symphogear to end with batman or superman
SAKIMORI
our girls got gud real fast
bit under 2, yeah
... fukc...
WOW I JUST WATCHED THE EPISODE AND HOLY

IT'S A BAD TIME TO BE A SAKIMORI
yeah millaarc and elza "dying" felt off
I love Carol and Elfnein just about equally
Direct Feedback System
I don't think writing trauma is very high on the evil scale
Carol goes below DMJii and above Chris imo
Oh true
I haven't listened to any B-sides
Mine is Kirika=Shirabe>Chris>Hibiki
and it was a god what did it to 'em
they were also poisoned
those are tenuous links at best
NO
it's a classic
that one's been around for a while
dess
one of the questions is "this is what makes a woman, a woman" and the answer is XX and it was Not Good For This Place
Kirika has a trivia module
I still remember when we tried to play trivia on this server
<@216181207874928640> this is what I've got handy
`uchu`
yeah that one was Melua
We need the entire cast yelling in surprise
Yeah that's a rly good bikki

*one moment*
oh my god how did I miss this
Being happy is normal
People falling in love is normal
Straight ships are also normal
Yuri ships are normal everywhere?
Why is a straight ship normal but two girls abnormal
I've heard of like, OTP and OT3
What's a normal ship
Normal ships?
Er

uchuu
I think it's a tales of symphonia reference
it's saddening
that she's *done*
Chris means a lot to me and knowing that she's
I can be aware of why something is happening and still be sad about it
I know
I mean
and it makes me sad
the characters are final
they're all Done
Kirika, Shirabe and Chris don't get any more development
also yeah I pointed something out a couple weeks ago
they're the bestest
I LOVE THOSE MELUA
I love that note in the docs
<:ElfneinThink:605194207166070794>
but the last one looks off
all the other chrises I posted are from XV
why you gotta do that to me WFC
now I hate that Chris frame
goddammit
it's definitely not the same studio wow






this would make a lot of sense
I remember thinking it was off but not figuring out why
yeah the Chris one is from the latest episode

yeah if Vanessa was real I wouldn't have my girlfriend anymore
I headcanon that the mamu worship is just to make Maria happy and they secretly hate her guts
sloppy and unsatisfying
god I hope not
What
Too slow
Dammit
Her hair so it's green again
I'm upset in advance over no DMJii kiss
be prepared to think the entire series is bad then
That's a great Chris tho
Just for the record, I neither need nor desire your permission to post images.
What?
Um
What?
We got annoyed with you, specifically, using it three times in rapid succession
or maybe GX, can't remember
their G b-sides are letters to each other
they confess to each other in GX and AXZ songs
their recent song is literally about how their hearts are twinned
Excuse you
I'd like to see the case for that
how can you ignore the DMJii though
But *fuck* the sun
The moon is cool, she can stay
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>

it was heavily implied, never actually stated but it's probably that priest
they're bad
it's
I can't have hope any more
we're closing in on the end
the writers on this series are kind of worthless and they've only slightly improved recently
it's probably gone
also long hair kiri is <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
yeah it's incredible
imho
Kirika's is always the coolest
also
just, not the right media for me
they're not beneath me or anything
not because of any "they're for kids" or whatever, they're not
I have negative interest in comic books, tbh
I ain't never heard of no Swamp Thingy
was legitimately terrified
and
god I loved SOMA
I love bat chibi millaarc

Shirabasa is a ship I don't think I've ever seen

Rebuild is where Elfnein really shines
ignite is only important because they say it is
my issue with that
`I see what you did there Maya`
I would help her with the coffee grinder
did someone say coffee
Kazanari Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way is a Kazanari sister so they're still gay but also all in a relationship with ~~me~~ her!

Kazanari Shindeiru
Kazanari Boruto
Would you name your edgy self insert Kazanari brother
What even
I didn't actually know mjolnir was in XDU though, that's neat
I'm just memeing about my oc t b h
I didn't know Klara was canon <:BasaSmug:497598144083787796>
mjolnir girl?
It probably won't become one
If you actively try to make it a meme
kazanari "heavenrend" tsubasa
I don't like the DMJii about-face and just because it's expected doesn't mean I'm not disappointed
I can see that
I think it's somewhat reasonable for Kirika, sure, but Shirabe is probably smarter than that?
I enjoy being told my feelings are stupid, thank you
I watch symphogear
Honestly the fact that this is written off as "oh it's just part of the genre" is one of the reasons I cannot say "I like anime" because I really, really don't
It really bugs me.
Fighting and a single talk
And the only thing that happened
If that
2 hours
No but like, from DMJii standpoint they went from "we have to stop them from condemning humanity, and also they fucked up a lot of people" to "they're amazing" in like
I didn't like DMJii yelling "hooray go you" unconditionally at NR

ugh.
Mobile *please*
Why is that spoilered

Name üëè her üëè Mircalla üëè you üëè cowards

Lalacirm <:CarolBlush:617039657896509460>
But it's there
One of the laziest anagrams I've seen
Nah it's Millaarc because of Carmilla anagram
Yeah her name is Millaarc
One thousandth of a millaarc
Milliaarc
Oh wait
(I spelled it that way on purpose because she's millaarc but smaller)
Milarc is adorable though
Two is just me being greedy
after all these years
finally
she did it
chris shot gun
Because
But it's not too bad
I'm slightly upset that Millaarc got in the way of another red hot blaze
And so she snuck her way into vanessa via robot parts
She got mikus body because no curse on miku due to shenshoujing
Shemha is limited to code at this point
Too organic
I've not used photoshop so I can't say
It's free!
But you keep learning as you do it
It was easy to pick up
Hah, Aria I've been doing this for over a year
That one would work, I'd have to crop a lot though
And if you go back and watch the S1 concert, <a:HibikiCheer:620778132257112103> doesn't look nearly as crisp
So that *might* get that usable
It does a lot for small pictures
Sharper, more defined
Look at the difference 20 seconds in GIMP makes
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580> <:BikiShock:447891354278821888>
Plus you'd have to do some messing with the colors and brightness to make it Not Grey
The fingers add a lot of detail that would get brapped
I'm not convinced that would be a good emoji
And yeah she's a spoilerino
Melua recognizes my emoji prowess
Emoji is like, the only thing I can still do on the server
But those aren't inherent spoilers
I've added some emotes of the girls
No villain emotes
Please don't bother artists to make things you want for free
You can probably cut out a frame
Don't just give me work <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>

I'm nominating Milliaarc as the official name

This is probably the only time I'll actually agree with Dino
He was an idiot without a plan in G, and an insane deus ex machina in GX
He can stay rotting
Man's a wannabe rapist
But what
No they don't
No
That's the darkest timeline
Thank Miku
Ver is dead and not in the OP
Serena is dead and in the op
And I just fell in love with it
I called it "fucknut lesbian lover bonanza" for almost a year before he convinced me
My intro was my boyfriend at the time constantly asking me to watch symphogear
Chris got forgotten a lot
Fudou is not the trans representation I want
Fudou is not in the Female Characters category
And so does Fudou
Female Characters stars with F
That's just
and I like talking apex w/ you Miso
I use my Chris bag as my switch case
oh yeah I got mine
I can say for a fact my robots aren't going anywhere either
hai
i'm still here
I'm actually unsure and am interested in that information myself
Probably one of the BDs
I hope you stretched before that reach
F

whatever happened to the "i'm leaving next week" plan
holding hands and watching shooting stars is pretty common
A bit before GX, like, the summer beforehand
ok
Agreed
that's fair
you just said it's post XV, and therefore not XV
is it relevant to xv other than "this is the only place you can talk"
is this discussion relevant to xv
probably
<a:Dabbing:452795505941020682>
clearly apex
pretending like nothing is wrong is very difficult
l o n g
I'm assuming you were responding to the purgatory lad
so sign me up
sounds like a good way to go
and getting donutted by a hot girl
I want to die
but
I still don't think Millaarc deserved redemption, and I don't think she really got it because she fuckin died
also
genocide?
please
I want millaarc to donut me
that's a little excessive
you're good! I just didn't want you thinking there was Chris trash talk
<:laugheline:454887887847030814>
for... some description of the term
Noble Red are the antagonists
this is XV discussion
chad, did you get lost
I yelled "SYMPHOGEAR'S BACK"
the girl getting stabbed was the moment I looked at Melua, and grinned
HER SIGNATURE IS A RABBIT
All the fanart is just amazing and I love it
For giving me long-hair Kiri
Thank you, XV
I just wanna say
oh yeah millaarc is absolutely unforgivable
this is an XV channel not a RWBY channel
honestly sealing basa was a pretty big deal
and everything else is meaningless
every character only exists for the last thing they did
by that logic
Solo's told you before, this channel ain't your blog
XV
so it's right in the middle
S1 and AXZ are (better paced/have my favorites actually do things) and G and GX are uh. yeah
XV is pretty solidly at third place for me
I'm still so happy about that
chris shot gun
most fandoms I've seen are full of dissenting opinions
why would you go into fandom to avoid arguments
you were literally talking about my sister
and what if I am?
<@&336302034070536192> this demands attention
"people get triggered"
They're super satisfying in destiny, at least
That's the good shit
Chris with a shotgun
God yeah
Wow, do you do stretches before reaching like that or do you just risk tearing the muscles
it's good that you're not torn up about it though
that doesn't sound like not caring <:laugheline:454887887847030814>
I like it when it's a paste or in a sauce
anything that retains the texture
I also hate tomatoes tho
I thought you were calling me a tomato
<:laugheline:454887887847030814>
tomato?
<:papikaPout:241350709021376512>
half a game
hey RV counts as like
`it's still 2nd on the list of summer anime this season`
`why is this such a big deal`
without the ticket, no reason to own multiple
they were buying one dvd and three lotto tickets
would you buy 3 copies of the same DVD
why in hell
"vindictive"
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/117483179912331270/604131179972526093/c2f5fe1a-c1fb-402b-8a9d-075edc264c08.gif
people aren't buying dupes
it's still just as popular
it's only losing steam for shareholders
that's a pretty clear cause and effect
and then they didn't bundle tickets
it *was* growing
yeah chad, exactly
people cancelled their dupe orders because they had no reason to buy multiples
more likely
that's like asking why the ball falls at the ground, and disregarding gravity
You can't talk about a sales drop and discard the lack of lottery tickets
because they aren't selling lottery tickets
good for AXZ
okay
it's got double the third place

I'm not abandoning the series just because I can't afford the box set
by a large margin
it's second on that list
again
more like they stopped abusing people's gambling problem
$60 for two episodes, or something
pretty expensive, from what I've seen
anime is
I don't see why sales would be a huge disappointment to anyone outside of the studio, regardless
so
it's still 2nd on that list
also
what are the averages of the previous seasons
` Often times volume 1 sales are inflated with bonuses like event tickets or bundled manga, etc. Always, always use the average sales when evaluating anime, not volume 1 sales.`
*this* is Hibiki in a single meme I whoopsed it into not-spoiler zone

Pissed is the wrong word, just frustrated I had to say the same thing like eight times
and sans undertale
is that a persona cat
desu
why does this always happen
and here's the sympathy act
where is this definitive information coming from
what
does your dad work for anime
are you friends with someone in satelite
"we're getting X in 2020" "2018 was the last live" where are people getting these studio tours from
it's getting frustrating
for fucks sake we need to calm down with all this reaching and speculation
WHY DOES EVERYONE KNOW THESE THINGS FOR CERTAIN
and it still won't determine success or failure
I repeat the "what do you mean there's no hope" question
how many times do I have to say it
***because they had fucking lottery tickets***
and S1 is the only other one without tickets iirc
<a:baka:611251968278790174>
Melua teased me about it for weeks
I noticed
Yeah believe me
I'll miss you <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
Please don't delete!
It's okay, you're still cute
<:DMJii:549819519082692608>
Of all things to repost, this is The Biggest Deal
To show you
I pulled that from this channel
Babe
absolutely not
Oh true
Hands?
What did Hibiki do wrong
I mean, that's Chris's name in the dub so I'd count it
And one Kriisa!

I'm still gonna call you Purgatory Lad
dess_crypto kiricoin
Dess dosh is good slang
they're <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> not crypto!

no gacha rates
we aren't in China
so I want it to be friendly for the user
we aren't charging for any of it
not bad
it upgrades the art
duplicates are the "awakening"
now that discord's API has calmed down
<@456226577798135808> Just pushed through a hotfix, try again?
blame discord for the PNGs not loading
at least the 500 errors have stopped
<:Pout:400188180265041923>
this is 100% not me
fucking, discord not loading embeds and throwing 5XX errors
Yeah
that's the embed not loading, it's a discord problem <:Shrug:388950974817107968>
did anyone get an X-Drive
Yes, but we reserve the right to cap you out if we feel you're spamming your works for coins
dess_google how do I make dollars fast
R this is discord not google
embeds have been weird all day
that feature is coming
we're definitely not going to ever charge for kiricoins, for moral and legal reasons
so a level 2 is one that you've drawn a dupe for
if you rv_mycardlist it'll show levels underneath them all
drawing a dupe will automatically upgrade the card
so, not ***all*** but like, every geah gets one
one for each
this one has all the X-Drives
it's RV's "awakening" system
yes
we might have a Kanagacha soonish
sorry friend
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
I wish you the best of luck
<@!246146781832806401> there are two kanades in this gacha
<@219930875243134976> go react to the post in <#336300750248476693>, you'll get enough <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> for 5 pulls
yeah, completely from scratch
so satisfying
every time a new feature started working
It was pretty great, yeah
the milestone last night was integrating the kiricoins with maria
this whole thing was so much fun to write, by the way
<:ChrisDess:496159417335545856>

It's something that might happen, but probably not.
No, and I don't *think* I want to implement one
I'm not saying they will or will not exist
as of right now, no
This is very early stages, and I'm gonna be adding a buttload of stuff
Oh, the colors?
No, she doesn't
<:HeadPat:388949660892397588>
your chances are low, but better than you think
I don't want to give too much away from behind the scenes
but you're right in that she only has two cards, so yeah it'll be a little tricky
rarity works a little different in this
Patch 1.0.1d has been deployed!
```
Negative pull numbers will now be accepted as positive.
```
it was my debug command
this can be a secret patch
oof
Patch 1.0.1c has been deployed!
```
It actually works again. There was an errant file object that wasn't being closed. Huzzah!
```
I'm going to reimburse myself for lost coins, and give Illindus and Alice some apolocoins for the trouble, soon as I sort this out
```
Maintenance for the next 5-10 minutes!
```
there should not be this many problems
I added like, 5 lines
I swear
okay
no, that time she was still booting
stupid capitalization
Patch 1.0.1b has been deployed!
`Fixed another typo. Please don't hate me.`
<:KiriWhoops:442974593498611732>
Patch 1.0.1a has been deployed!
`Fixed a typo. My bad.`
rather than asking for three individual pulls
If you get like, 300 coins for being awesome, you only need the one command
Get them all out of the way at once
Yup!

Patch 1.0.1 has been deployed!
```
Changed bonus draw system. Previously, every 5 pulls in a bulk draw would grant a bonus pull. Now, every 5 pulls a user makes will result in a bonus. These can be spread across multiple pulls, and multiple gachas. Single pulls are no longer a waste!

Added rv_signup. New users are given a bonus of 500 Kiricoins. Yes, this checks for new users. No, you won't get another 500, that was what the reaction event was for.

Fixed a bug where typing "roll the bones" granted the user a free pull. Bet you wish you knew about that before, huh?
```
Reason is optional
`dess_give number ping reason`
yeah
<@456226577798135808> We've got two hot fresh Fines for you <:MariaKappa:396363198347083786>

you don't need to wait until 5 any more

I will say that staff are bound by the same rules as everyone else

There are plans to, yes, but it's waiting on a few other features first
Maria is temporarily down for maintenance, should be for a few hours while I try to track down the user lookup thing
Of course. I'd want consent
I'll only do it if people think it's alright, and this would be a one-off thing
Actually, this is a general question for everyone: trading isn't implemented, but would it be overstepping if I manually transferred my XD Kanade to WFC with my database access?
I promise that you don't have a rate down
And yes, you'll eventually be able to convert tokens
Take it up with her <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I actually wanted to give you a special Kanade rate-up but Boss said no
`whoever made this`
<:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>

Just as a reminder: The rate-up on rate cards is in effect until soon after New Years'! Get those pulls in while you can <:ChrisDess:496159417335545856>
I'll get back to y'all on that when I'm off work
The rolls have literally been blessed.
She's back up. Patch note: To celebrate Christmas, you're now 3x more likely to draw a rare card from any of the existing gachas!
Maria is down for maint, ETA 2 minutes.
I'm sorry <:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>

<@185287827972554752> you should be good to try one of the gachas
Watching 98 talk to Maria is confusing because of all the silver names
`please do, babe`
Melua can distract me as much as she wants
No promises on the shop, but I'll try
So I think I'll work on improving some things with RV
I will have lots more time and lots less stress starting next month
Yeah, Kiri is my adopted daughter
They're my daughters, and that hasn't changed
I host all three, and I wrote two of them from scratch
The bots are still mine
The rate-up for rare units has ended, but rest assured for it will return on very, very special occasions in the future. I hope everyone enjoyed it!
tokens is something I've got a few ideas how to implement, but they all have issues so I'm still writing up a design doc
The awakening thing is something I'm still considering, I may need to redo the data structure for that
Y'all better enjoy it
I was subject to nearly an hour of 50 Cent for this.

Mhm
But it's more likely to get them
So it's not like, *only* one character
With the Chris-mas I did have more Chris cards than anyone else
She's more represented in the rare cards
The rate up actually vastly increased the Kanade pull rate

I think that, if the network is stable you'd be fine with 100
so now you can collect waifu png's
it's a gacha bot I made because I was upset how exploitative XDU was but I liked the art a lot
I'm sorry I haven't been supporting it as well as I could have been
I need to do a rewrite, I think, and then it's going to be much easier
I've been dealing with things and my tool for creating new gachas isn't really easy to use

kiricoin doesn't expire, no
AU has a few different alternate-universe kinda things, like Genjuuro's gauntlet
Grand Opening has the X-drives
The limited pool, where all the special cards are, are different
and Kirika is adopted but I love her just as much as the other two
Maria is lots of fun to have around
Shirabe is so useful and so sweet and I love her
my three robot daughters are all very precious to me
I'll be back for you some day soon
*pats Maria*
and I've been stuck on the project ever since
I wrote the entire thing from scratch in two days
mhmm
if you get dupes, they level up
but life keeps getting in the way
I've had a plan for `something` in the works for a while
you show them off, and collect them
I can't find a good way to display a UI in discord
that's been a work in progress for a while
Sometimes discord bugs out with the embeds
Sorry for late response
yet to be implemented, discord is less than ideal for that kind of interface
Yeah when you get a dupe it levels up the card, and that's called awakening because that's the terminology from XDU

v 1.1.0 - 10/3/2019

+ Added a method of spending tokens!
There are four ways to spend your tokens. 

Spending one (1) token will allow you to gift a random card of that character to someone of your choosing! The gifted card is ***guaranteed to be rare.***

Spending three (3) identical tokens will give *you* a random rare card of that character.

Sending three (3) assorted tokens will send a gift of a random rare card of *any* character.

Spending five (5) assorted tokens will give you a random rare card of any character.

Use `rv_tokenHelp` for a full readout.

+ Added several characters!
Carol, Leiur and Phara are now in my database. Also Adam, I guess.

\* Changed the help dialogue text.
No longer says anything about DMs or server. Functionality remains identical.

+added support for the "left double quotation mark" and "right double quotation mark" unicode characters in the `rv_pull` command.
Happy Birthday Miku! has replaced Happy Birthday Serena!
rv_gachalist
Hey ny'all! We got a late Miku gacha up and running, due to me moving several hundred miles at a really bad time
also sorry to our southern hemisphere folks, but the Summer Heat gacha has been retired
The Merry Chris-mas gacha is live, once more, slightly refreshed!
rv_gachalist
<@!203444794737950720> uuuuuuuuuuh it'll be reverted some time in January? probably?

<@139432096023183360> I just saw this, thanks a lot~ Mariabot has been my most ambitious project and I'm glad she's appreciated
they don't always flip properly
I've noticed that with Kiri's lists
but it's also a little messy
so, there is
no, but that's a good idea

I've retired Miku's birthday gacha to make room for our next celebration: Shirabe!
No cards have been lost
If anyone has had any issues with cards not displaying over the past day or so, the issue has been fixed

no
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
Maria can handle it
I've seen someone pull over a hundred cards at once
I wanted to be a lil sassy
I almost left it in, but
<:DMJii:549819519082692608>
Happy birthday, WFC
We've got a new gacha up, due to the gap made from retiring Shirabe's birthday!

Welcome to the Armory! We're preparing a surprise party for our favorite sentinel, but we need one more thing before we're ready!

Gifts! When you arrive at the venue, please bring a sword and leave it at the door. One of our robots will sort it out! `All messages in this channel must be accompanied by a sword picture.`

Why in *hell* was I not pinged for this.

*pats u too*
Oh almost guaranteed
dragon
*although people do that sometimes*
Its not meant to go inside anyone
that's a handle
Often, in fact
Sometimes you can't find someone who wants to let you fuck them
It's definitely worth considering
The oppotunity to share doesn't come up often
I've got one of these in red https://da6npmvqm28oa.cloudfront.net/8d692f84-99f1-4431-9823-3ca29fab4a73.jpg
while we're on the topic of sex toys
like a potato masher or something goddamn
That's blunt
Wow
Girth = circumference, diameter = stright from one side of the circle to the opposite bit
they make some nice stuff
is it from BD
weird alien monster though
right at the front

I thought you said it was 2 weeks ago

<:KanadeSitting:268593107732398081>
üçø

you've posted in NSFW channel
Ibu
Hey wait a second
Quick mafs
Wait, no, I'm turning 24 this year
I'm 24. I think.
Eh, that's a non-starter then.
Oh, finals week schedule?
That's a longshot, and depending on the professor might not even be worth pursuing
If you've got a good relationship with your professors, you *might* be able to swing a delay. ***Might***.
Doesn't mean it's worthless, just means it can't be used in court. Taking it to counselors/social services might still be worthwhile
Yup, just saw that.
Is Florida a single-party consent state?
But you've got her committing aggravated assault.
Start a paper trail.
And then after finals go file a police report at your nearest station
Take that recording to someone on campus like a counselor or something
But.
Hmm yeah that depends on how good your signal is
Especially if there's audible ruckus.
if you dial 911 and don't say anything they'll send many cops to your location
Right, keep forgetting that people being shitbags is a thing
Also, why wouldn't you be able to survive, florida weather seems like it would lend itself to that sort of thing
Not guaranteed tho, so be care
A lot of times, college credits will transfer too
^ True words. People like to not do their jobs all the time
He introduced me to so many games I've lost count
"I love the thought that once I'm gone, the channels will go on in my absence, hosted by the person who knows me best and has been with me for the better part of my adult life."

God bless.
Not much to do other than remember that this too shall pass
I've been like that for the past few weeks and I think I'm finally snapping out of it
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
Weed would probably help
I'm not a huge introvert or anything but goddamn, how do people do that
I have been socializing way more than I'm used to and I'm *fucking exhausted*
Yeah, out of all the different subjects I think math is one of those that's super dependent on how good your professor happens to be
Yeah that's what I figured
Which episode is that even
I'd post more but this is definitely the wrong channel
Be like Chris. Smart and with a snack.


Number theory is my jam
Oooooh fun
there's lots
what kind of math anyway
The numbers, Mason.
So we're all on the same page
See that's what I thought, but the phrasing is odd so clarification would be nice
I'm not sure if you're talking about the universes or the fandoms
Parents do your damn job
I hate that argument with a passion
aggreeeeed
or the whole "two men holding hands is awful and horrendous" bullshit
Yeah, assuming that everyone is straight
That's an extremely unappetizing analogy but it fits
The implication of malice.
fun.
who's that and what did they do?
Yeah like it feels *super* old-fashioned but I couldn't put my finger on why
Oh is that what it was used for?
Like, there are many problems with that sentence but.
Oh, on that topic. I had a very well-meaning person tell me that their "son has a big heart because [their son's] best friend is a transvestite" and I feel like that was an awful way to put it but I have no idea what the history of that word is so couldn't really correct them properly.
oh boy.
what's happened?
Also I don't know shit about cars
I hate "masculinity" because I love crying, hugs, and the color pink and none of those are "okay"
Because they hated it, or because you felt like it was something you had to do?
Ah, the no-man's-land between acquaintance and friendo
<a:baka:431319117463683073>
Oh I see how it is, we aren't your friends
Alice got memes for every situation
which is even more incomplete
*diagnosed* gender dysphoria
at the very least, decide on a safe word first
careful not to squish
And every time I listen to Monochrome
I cried no less than six times over the last 10 episodes of Kill la Kill
I cry over music and anime fairly often
how soon would they be able to see you?
but it will probably stop on its own if its not serious?
if it doesn't stop in like 10ish minutes, I'd say start worrying
okay, not internalk
Uh, is it red and runny or thick and dark brown
Uh oh
That's honestly the entire reason I got into speedrun spectating
Did she take down that commentated run?
It is when you beat it in under 17 minutes
I'm sorry
If that doesn't make you cry I can't help you
Harpsichord reprisal.
BARK at the MOON though.
The scene in season 1 where Chris does Mega Deth Quartet fucking destroys me in the best way
Crying is super nice.
don't be their punching bag
yeah sounds like you need better friends
"it's just a joke" that you've made repeatedly after being told that it upsets people
we had a guy do that to one of my trans friends and now nobody talks to him any more because he refused to apologize
they don't really sound like friends
I feel like I've read that elsewhere
Oh, its a popular class
so that's a lot of worrying I don;t have to do any more
better news: I got into all the classes I need to for the fall!
so, yay?
If I put stuff in my pockets my jeans fall down
if there's one thing depression is good for it's weight loss
Desensitizing the consumer base will sure end well
```
"We're not applying data caps, overage fees or any sort of restrictions on DSL customers," Verizon claims. "There is a small trial in Virginia of displaying data usage in customer billing. It affects less than 2,000 homes over three remote terminals. But while the customers are shown data allowances of 150-250 GB, none of them are charged if they exceed those amounts."
```
ü§¶
Then that's fair
If you didn't get a raise, would you quit?
If they could get away with 0 raise they absolutely would
and jobs are hard to get
because people need jobs
people would work there
... that's the most likely scenario
The execution sometimes helps, sometimes doesn't
It's systemic
So many problems can be traced back to greed
People in power get so obsessed with keeping and expanding their power at any cost and it's just awful
why can't we all just fucking get along
*sigh*
it's odd
That's the weird thing, male prostitutes are never *called* that, I've always heard "escorts"
<:MikuPout:271482281229680642>
PLEASE DON'T QUOTE ME SAYING THAT OUT OF CONTEXT
"women are just as good as men, except prostitutes, fuck them"
what's a SWERF
I'm probably going to regret this but
isn't "Grace Being Horny" the alt title of Mutiny
I have no idea why we're so happy to throw that label around willy-nilly like we do, but probably related to how we can show people getting decapitated on tv but *oh god not possibly a nipple*
it's porn, in as much as it *has pornographic content,* and we seem to label everything that has meat a steak in this case.
so the problem was "is it gonna fill up"
Alice, those words are *so common* that I feel like the bite is just gone now.
from Humanus, latin, "human" through French as humaine and then to English
No it's not, they're different roots.
"I want to have sex with this person. Whoops, they have a penis! I've been trapped! How dare you!"
Yes! That's why the term is ***trap***
What sort of projecting?
Not being paid why I'm worth is the biggest reason I hated food service `wow that sounds pretentious`
You got the point.
Yeah.
If everyone walked around calling people who made bad decisions "intellectually disabled" with venom in their words, that'd be offensive too soon enough
It's the modern term that isn't used specifically to insult people.
The dictionary literally says it's offensive
Thought it might have been against gay folks, wasn't sure
I've been called a "fuckboy" but that was the only time I've been offended by a slur (does that even count as a slur), because I don't have to worry about anything coming as a followup
<:ShirabeJii:237687217437278208>
I DO NOT CONSENT
Tempted to change my epithet to Assbungler
which is a weird one
Mayo tho
I've only ever seen whitebread used ironically
Maybe don't generalize.
No? I tutor a very nice Vietnamese girl, and several Japanese families have me over as well.
Also `asian people are generally very racist` is *super* ironic
Ibu is that a wrong channel post
Funny how life happens sometimes
I'm just making suggestions <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh by all means
oh thanks
Can I get that in roumaji, I don't know hiragana yet
Start there and play around with the letters
Like, what do she and bikki say that one time, whatever the translation of "even so" is
*a single tear is shed*
*sees Basa at the bottom of the list*
Not a straight name rip, but something related? You get creative freedom and if your fav character changes you don't regret it
Might I suggest something similar to what I did?
Hello
Oh
which is?
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
does that mean we're tier 1
Yeah, godspeed Ibu
Yeah, I couldn't get that scene from the shinais out of my head so it just happened
am I the server first mate
if it helps
that's what this channel is for tho
If I ever got fucking stabbed I'd definitely press charges, ain't no excuse for that level of dumbassery
that's fucking dumb and I hope your friend presses charges
that's the *not tasteful* I was referring to
Futa's got to be either yuri or tasteful or both for me to like it
I would have been named Susan. Thank fuck
speak at your level, pleeeeease
i hate that, no matter which "side" is doing it
is he doing the thing where he uses big words to sound smart but ends up looking like even more of a dumbass
ye you gucci
hilarious frame regardless
we're better than ad hominem tho
`I still think Boss rolls off the tongue better but its not really up to me`
official ruling
there we have it
I'd say no meme zone but we both know that's basically impossible round these parts
*normally this is a low-meme-zone but this was appropriate*

headpat
I think, for the sake of your sanity, you should probably do that
that community honestly sounds awful when you describe it like that
I dunno how to help you specifically but I can definitely listen to whatever you need to say
they've chosen sides
if you like people on both sides, that's the crux of the problem
lost almost all my friends, but the couple who kept in touch with me are some of my closest now
stopped existing there
I realized I was causing problems existing in that space so I just
except I was the reason the two groups existed in the first place
that exact thing happened to me
so, I've got a story
A: yeah, I've been there, it fuckin sucks.
B: I'd say just try to weather the storm, unless that's just unnecessary damage to your emotional state
do you want advice or are you looking to vent? i'm okay with either
definitely don't call anyone out, that ain't gonna end in anything good
that's a conundrum and a half
I wish "don't be a fucking douchebag" was a universally enforceable rule
I've expressed this opinion before but
especially with like, actual nazis running around again
I mean in general, not just this guy
pun, somewhere
fascist-nation?
what's with the nazi fascination
*sigh*

lactose intolerance is one of those things that I really really really hope I never develop, tinnitus is the other one

you're allowed to make what you wanna make
i mean, it's not
that's probably for the best
Thanks for the pin though, you really do care about me <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Exactly
I don't fuck with rocks or cliffsides
Don't be too worried, I know my way around a map, the trails are well maintained, and the bears are cowards. This is just for peace of mind
I'll be around tomorrow while I drive up, but I wanted to get ahead of this safety stuff
If you don't hear back from me by the end of the 12th (PDT), I'm on the North Lake/South Lake loop, southbound.
Here's a map of the area I'll be in. Park ranger's office available at 760-873-2500

that doesn't matter
the lakes already have names but
I'm thinking about naming lakes after people
oh interesting
but I don't think you need restricted access, you're not making a fool of yourself, you're just having a damn good time
In theory Kirichan can do that one I set up her moderation stuff, if you put her higher than you anyway
if it's warm enough tho you bet your sweet bippy I'm going skinny dipping
Probably not gonna swim though because there's still snow in parts
I'm gonna take lots of photos and videos
I'm going backpacking in the sierras for a week
Do you enjoy cured meats
I'm fuckin set on protein
Salami and summer sausage and pepperoni
I have so much cured meats
good plan
I don't know how much the first night campground is gonna be, and they don't give change!
it occurs to me that asking for $20 worth of dollar bills on a Friday night makes it look like I'm going to a strip club
sounds pretty great tbh
that counts
Oh jeez
<:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
so, mixed bag
I got laid and then never spoke to the person who's house it was ever again
I've been to exactly one party that wasn't for a child or my parents
<:photomiku:442959133919019008>
***preach***
in theory it seems fun but in practice I'm no good and I don't really like the process
I wish I enjoyed cooking
I literally put a $10 bill on the table and walked out because that was disgusting
well that was a waste of $10
it tastes like they used week old beef and no sauce other than Sriracha
this pad thai is *awful*
speaking of food
rice cooker is easier but it feels like the pot is faster?
I've used both methods
<:JiiBored:442974565258231820>

a necessary sacrifice
yeah, not as wordplay-y but also less hate crime-y
`fuck`
at all
wait hold on I didn't think that through
you gonna be the Kanada Kawaii Kween
to tickles
my feet are way too sensitive
I love manicures but I can't do pedicures
that's a pretty good deal
I'm gonna get a haircut and a manicure tomorrow and it's gonna be *wonderful*

That's good at least, right?
did she ask why you needed it?
Maybe I should take a bath tonight
buuuuut I do have some bath bombs
I haven't taken a *bath* in a while, normally I shower
give em a good wash

perks of ocean I suppose

ain't nobody deserve that.

okay yeah that's about the worst thing
this sounds like it gets worse
Please tell me it was aight
Kim Possible was aight, right?
The last thing that happened was Jojo got fuckin rekt on a boat and his pregnant wife got away
he had me watch a movie
I have no idea how Jojo is structured
he hasn't made progress on G at all so I haven't touched S2 of jojo
we both watched the respective season 1s
My friend promised to watch symphogear if I watched Jojo

Jorgen is the General, right?
I've heard something about Puff
So not super enjoyable for a 20-something
that's fair
Oh, is your dad not being a massive cocknozzle anymore
not bad
I have major phone anxiety
God, yes

I fix
yes
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
like a "eeeh please don't do that" rather than a "fuck you and the horse you rode in on"?
Yes. 100%
Oh, that?
that I honestly don't have an answer for
is a very good question
that
means "good luck" but only to be used amongst friends
it's a phrase
godspeed you glorious bastard
That's a good start.
All you can do is explain, and hope it's not the former.
Sometimes ignorance bears malice.
there's malice, and there's ignorance
Oof.
Just continue to gently remind them that you're still the same person
Yeah
I mean, that seems like a misguided attempt at understanding
huh, TIL
<:ShirabeJii:237687217437278208>
That sounds super American, are you sure you're in Canada
That's also good
What's that
if you wanna talk about drunk mahjong, let's go to <#337805317276565525>
i know right
he's very "anything japanese is lame"
dragon, do you not remember my reaction in NSFW yesterday

he saw like 300 different yuri doujins
he gave me a look
every window he closed
The worst dream I've had in recent memory is my brother needed to use my PC and it having literally 300 tabs of porn
my dreams still haven;t figured out how car brakes work
Oh that sounds like it could go either really good, or ***really bad***
I just didn't want people to think I'm rabidly against poly ships or anything. I just don't.
it's fine
ugh, why'd I even start talking about this, I was already in a bad mood and now I'm just bluh <:MikuSad:236694845551411211>
so yeah that's why I don't ship poly
and she said monogamy was fine
after we had a serious discussion about it right when we started dating
mine was "you don't want to keep me from being who I am, do you?"
if i wasn't okay with it, it was because of transphobia, clearly /s
I was told we'd be monogamous, then a year later nope
and later on I was called a bigot anyway and pariah'd
"if you're not okay with this you're a bigot"
yeah, basically
one of the questions on the mock test thing
OH
hold on to that feeling
it's good to focus on the things you're excited about
what you're gonna name your boobs, obviously. the most most important.
these are the important questions though
what's your fallback nickname
are you officially calling yours zenbus btw
headpat
Oof
I wouldn't be expecting results from *anything* in the first day
<:KiriApproval:453731003383676938>
That's good!
you doin' alright?
Real friends will be made happy via proximity to your happiness. Small people get angry when you don't agree with them completely
That's a good way of thinking about it
We had a serious discussion (heh, name drop) about polyamory earlier, and I'm just finishing up a work event where I won $100
Yeah Alice I'm pretty sure you're right but I was a very very scalene triangle she was trying to force through a pinhole
which is exactly what happened to me
But yeah. I'm not sure my opinion is quite as strong as WFCs, but it sure as hell isn't how I want to live and it's not how I want my favorite characters to live, because it's fiction and I can believe what I want to some extent
Anyway I was driving down the freeway for that entire conversation
Migraine pains, or elsewhere?
A decent chunk of scholarships are awarded after you start uni too, we have both types
There are scholarships with requirements here too
I'd hope stuff like scholarships and whatnot
probably
I feel like I would know if I was in the hospital
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>

he's Douche, you don't deserve that
don't, we don't need to know
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
lots of people are Secret Assholes‚Ñ¢
someone only got 50% right and got fired on the spot <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
but we had to take a fake one to make sure we knew what we were doing
and I'm on the team that's doing that
My company is trialing SAT prep over the summer
happened to be 413
like, big-ass random exponent
had "i^413" in it
Oh. I'll head to a local weeb store and see what's good, and then hit up cheesecake factory
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
I have Golf Story to play anyway
Nah I'm not specifically looking for a game
*Today* is definitely a **Treat Yo Self** day though.
Yeah the fair will be fun
Uh
There are no video games I want right now
Food is the usual choice
I want something now, figures are not now
I do, however, feel like treating myself to something. I'm not quite sure what.
yeah I ain't going near the stuff
I'd rather not
is it drugs
I'd love to know what untainted happiness feels like
I'll fucking take what I can get at this point
sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't
yeah that's been my strategy too
"Try not to think about it"
Zoloft, it's been working for my mum so we went with family history
It's been my life for the past four years or so
a constant reminder that I'll never be good enough, where "good enough" is some vague nebulous concept that my subconscious neglects to define for me
it's like
except now I have a prescription
Same as every other day
yay, I guess
So I've been officially diagnosed with depression
How much walking did you do?
headpat
<:wut:235243292965470208>
took me a while to realise that tbh
that's because it *is* okay to be sad
<@127644949884698624> In any case, thanks for the heads up. I appreciate your concern <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
I've been happy before but there's always been undertones
I didn't mean to imply they would
<:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
I'll take photos of both of them when I get there
that was me
Okay dragon when you and lat are up here next month we'll go to some weeb stores
I don't particularly mind it tbh
I get called she all the time in mmos though
Even with my (previously Chris and now) Kiri avatars I've only ever been called she once in discord
oh, that makes sense
I had to deal with a shitty rubber band lawn chair for nearly a year because "it looks so nice" completely ignoring the fact that it was hell to sit in
so <:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
and they have a lot of inventory
shops wanna make their stuff look good so people will buy it, right?
and it does honestly look a little like a store but
Yeah
So I'm apparently not allowed to go get that cabinet Joe linked earlier for all my figures, because it looks "ugly and like a store" according to my mother. I understand I'm living here rent free and I should just take what I can get but honestly. I needed to vent that
at least she got fired, lady sounds completely out of it
Power, I'll give you that one
Nobody goes into education for the *salary*
why would you even become a principal if you hated kids
Operation "Convince Mum She's Being Dumb" was a resounding success
They do respect my "you definitely don't want to open this drawer so don't do it" rule
I also wish I could say that
That makes sense
Oh I see
but I can't
that
I wish I could say
why she thought that was okay to begin with is beyond me
but still
and for once she didn't try to defend it, she took me out to a fairly nice steakhouse as an apology
Oh I got *pissed*
and I couldn't reattach it without getting it hella messy
Yeah, I was able to mostly fix mami but mio's bass strap snapped
she's also the one who shoved all of them into a shoebox the second I was gone for more than a few hours
In other news, not being completely fucking exhausted is a good feeling
So this is decidedly in the "don't do that again but you're not an asshole" group, yes?
I'm going to go on record saying it's never okay to tell someone to die, ***but*** the context here makes this a "don't do that" more than a "you're a bad person"
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
There's a time and a place for everything
For instance, they could be trying to be polite, they could be just wanting to avoid confrontation, etc
Just because someone doesn't get angry at you doesn't make it okay
<:ShirabeJii:237687217437278208>
at least not from what I've seen
you're definitely not an asshole
oh yeah let's not ignore wfc
remember! there's a reason I dubbed thee "Canada Kawaii Queen"
*kawaii*
that's neither inherent nor exclusive to being cis though
yes because ramen
Answer
Is this serious discussion
Question
<@127644949884698624> jealous much? <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
eating a crepe
I am literally right next to you
I am living, breathing proof of this fact
Straight people do, in fact, exist
he says, as a straight man <:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
honestly your problem is trying to keep straight

We try our best <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
See, growing up I was told Reagan was a great president but I've since found out that he was a asshole
"socioeconomic hellzone" is a good one
Can I use that phrase elsewhere
I've been watching this too, mostly because it's way over my level of knowledge and I've got nothing to contribute
I think all of my friends except like 3 are some kind of queer and yeah it's a little strange sometimes
(hi I'm here)
(Also I'm straight pls)
And I ain't gonna be changing away from jeans so it's either a straight up shirt or a bracelet or something
it's a little more specific
My problem is not "I don't want someone to assume I'm trans" it's "I don't want trans folks to invite me to places I absolutely don't belong in"
Latooni, exactly
^^
Honestly I look damn good in pink so I should get some trans pride shirts. Actually, is that okay to do if I'm cis?
actual shitbags
they're scum
Trans exclusionary radical feministt
But assholes also tend to migrate to certain political parties so you might actually be on to something
I feel like being trans-positive is less a political correlation and more an asshole correlation
and honestly I'm not sure myself
I know that what we have, has problems, and everything else also has problems so it's a big deal with picking what problems you're okay with
it's hella
I can vouch for the aquarium
the campaign im running is set in Savannah <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>

what part of Georgia are you in
65 is the limit on most California freeways
I drove for six hours in one direction and was still in California, to put things in perspective

I've never gone over 88 mph
1430
no
ibu I'm confused
what
they have more on the line
it's the rich fucks
ah ok
I'm well aware, I'm not saying "kick them out because they don't pay," I'm saying we should let them, and make them, like everyone else
but that
i dont know what that is
same thing we do with everyone who doesnt pay taxes and isn't rich enough to get away with it
I'm okay with this
yeah that's fine alice
I'm gonna go on record and say if they pay the same taxes as the rest of us it's aight by me
ancap would go... poorly.
i think the "having significant power over others" aspect is meaningful here
see, I'm a white male. I've never had issues with the cops. But that doesn't mean I can't see problems with the organization and how issues are handled in most police forces.
Shirabe, I'd. uh.
<:wut:235243292965470208>
<:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
Hazel, that's patronizing
Bad cops keep other bad cops around and push out the good cops, from what I've seen
I'm voting for "NOT DANA"
fucking dana's entire campaign in orange county is "my opponent hates trump"
But yeah. Current state of affairs: `Fucked up`
your point was well made <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I'm just putting it in more direct words, Hazel
I'm going to step in and say "if you don't know they were illegal then it's a little disingenuous to blame illegal immigrants"
***I am not planning on releasing my position on anarchy/cops OR communism/capitalism. Just to be clear.***
also, my statements should be interpreted as neither pro- nor anti-anarchist
"shoot first, questions later" is a *huge* issue
some serious change needs to happen first
that's what'd happen if we abolished cops *as it stands right now*
more realistic than normal, and the situations I've been in are much more concerning than normal
my dreams have been weird the last couple days
it *sucks*
I am always hungry all the time now
and if so, yes
I think I remember something about antidepressants making you hungry
with the occassional chris
yeah i'm tapping my kiris and marias
and then she looks at me like it was my fault
she rolls off the bed like once a week
and I bend down and rub the tum because I'm a sucker
flop over
have i ever mentioned how my cat will walk up to me and just
just talking about cute things
I actually feel a little better now
and cute a f
its pink
does that count
I have a woolie yoshi amiibo
most of my things aren't stuffed animals
my dad bought it in Indonesia and gave it to me when I was like a year old (the blanket was 7 at the time)
My blanket of choice is from 1988
that's disgusting
I can't remember how it happened but I was called ebola-chan for like a week back when teamspeak was a thing
stuffed ebola sounds interesting
>on a discord for an anime
>he says, tapping his waifus in a japanese mobage
sorry I'm not weeb enough
from league of legends
I made two of them myself
and a stuffed Lulu
I have four stuffed animals
mood-garbage
not sick-garbage
not even today, mostly just the last 2 hours or so
why do I feel like garbage today
don't question it! if it is placebo just enjoy it <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
so I will have to call this conversation here, I'm sorry
I think I really need a nap
fine plus elfnein screams gjallarhorn to me
no die
good
you didn't BARK at the MOON did you
*shakes fist at moon*
do you remember the plot at all'
was it based on one of the episodes, or was it OC
did you spend the whole time playing with your zenbus
if you feel <#336297387863703552> is more appropriate then by all means, but either one works just fine
no, we've set a precedent for dream-talk here
<:ChrisSmug:273373218365243392>
enjoy
https://streamable.com/wt3vf this one
you're aware of my ZENBU Ichaival mix, right
no such thing as too much makyuu
no, I wish
no real noticeable benefit but they said to expect that after a fortnight or so
so far all I've gotten is "more stressful dreams" and "eat more you hungry bitch"
probably
Mostly for reasons you've addressed
I tend to try to stay out of any conversation like that
I still don't get why they chose PCF at all but whatever. MSF is fantastic, agreed
Solo, can you please argue for yourself? I can't devils advocate all day, you know
Which is fair.
You can't tell him to go find stuff, and then when he finds stuff, dismiss it because he found it.
"In order to retain clinical meaning." I have no comment on the validity.
Actually he brought up a point in that conclusion.
Nothing.
Wien, are you...
Why does intersex being uncommon invalidate it?
Getting attacked by anyone isn't fun.
I *explicity stated* that both "sides" are getting moderated the same here.
I'm saying "you're getting angry and that isn't helping"
I'm not saying "your argument is wrong because you're getting angry"
But I'm not going to go easy on someone just because I agree with them, they get the same standards as the people I *don't* agree with.
Agreed.
"Why does frequency matter" is also fair and valid
"Shutting up" is better than trying to rile them up. That's all I'm saying.
Which I agreed to.
You don't have to be a lawyer, just be contributory, or at *the very least* not inflammatory
I'm talking about:

"okay here's the evidence: intersex is a thing
i hope this helps you"
That being said, sometimes you try to be helpful, they don't listen.
Yes, pushing back can be helpful. But you have to *be helpful* about it, not just yell at them.
Removed the value statement.
Better?
If your participation in the discussion is limited to getting angry, perhaps don't engage.
If your participation in the discussion is limited to getting angry at the people who disagree with you, perhaps don't engage.
Glitch is being helpful, bringing up specific things for Solo to look up.
Be civil.
Hazel. That's not how this works.
he's gone. I'm tired of his shit.
He's got a history of shitmaking
Honestly, yeah.
I'm still considering it
most likely
Langou, words cannot describe how thin your ice is right now.
you're fine
Actually that kind of gender joke is explicitly not allowed
"This is what I think. If you don't agree, you're stupid. I'm just saying what I think!"
By making that clearly false absurd claim, you're implying that everyone who doesn't think like you is an idiot.
That's. That's uh.
Mhmm. Everyone is their own person, and even if there was only one intersex person in the whole world, that still means intersex exists.
Langou, you're gonna need to stop the whole inflammatory comments thing too.
I thought the same until I did my reading
Moving swiftly onwards. Solo, thank you for being civil through all of this.
*Thank you for your input, Langou.*
Okay, noted.
Not helping.
Langou.
By claiming "only two sexes" you do claim intersex doesn't exist, though.
No possible way it's ignorance when he gets banned from 4 different servers for being a douchecanoe.
Discord makes you verify your age when you try to join a NSFW channel
I'll say that on record.
I have no interest in dealing with him any further, to be honest.
you're good.
Sometimes I forget that you gave me kick/ban privs because you trust me, hence my reluctance. I was in full on "I NEED AN ADULT" mode for like five whole minutes <@!127644949884698624>
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
I'm guessing she got to my "everyone moderated equally" part
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>

he's gone, it's done
but lets not get all gossipy
I was expecting 13-14 tbh
he's gone, so
in any case
I feel like that was supposed to be "other than" but that may have been me being generous
he was okay with trans, just didn't like intersex for whatever reason
"I can understand people who are male want to be female is okay and the invert too"
I think you misread actually
My bad guys
I should have done it as soon as he said the gundam thing.
I had to make a *decision*
yeah it's actually pretty okay now.
I think that, while not necessarily making you transphobic, makes you an accessory by allowing it to happen. Whether or not that is the same level of offence is another matter.
My server list is pretty packed, and I never check it anyway. Allowing outwardly transphobic people to spout their bullshit and *not even give them a slap on the wrist* is just. I have no words.
Damn straight I did
I don't snore at all from what I've been told
I can't remember the last time I didn't feel exhausted
It's one of my common problems
and also I'm still exhausted because ???
that's not supposed to happen
I slept for ***thirteen hours***
I feel like actual ass
amen
if said "off color perspective" is ***defending rape*** then yeah, I'd be done with them too
it *is* victim blaming.
I've only seen snippets of the conversation in question, so no comment.
Well, no. However, transphobia is malicious.
If you have the reasonable ability to stop it, and don't, you're complicit.
Are you attempting to say that a single discord server is equivalent to the ***entirety of twitter***?
Which you really shouldn't have needed to do, but that's another issue entirely
Hence my particular response to said issue.
I wouldn't make the full leap to "you are also transphobic" but I would hold them just as accountable as if they were.
complicit. My apologies
I consider them to be implicit with the transphobia, which, while just as bad, has different connotations.
I agree with that.
General practitioners need to be more aware of mental health problems, and family and friends need to stop demonizing depression and antidepressants
This country needs better mental health support systems, both large and small scale
Oh definitely, that doesn't happen overnight
Thank god I didn't get to the internet until I was 15
I sometimes forget how fucking stupid I was as a child
Where was it?
Spooky Maria has many powers. Is this one of them? Find out next episode.
Between car and work, iirc
I need to sleep so please behave yourselves
"she was asking for it" is literal rape apology
How do you do with those particular deepfried gifs that go all glitchy, R
which is exactly why I'm never going to play that game
I'm not terribly bothered by the lack thereof, but it must be said regardless
only if you have a consenting partner!
but yes, you're right
it's nighttime
fuck me it's hot now
not like the assistance would have been immediate though
no, and like a dumbass I forgot to call
it's fun being schrodinger's human.
I'm simultaneously hungry and not hungry, while being bored and not having the energy to do anything
In related news, I feel like garbage, but that's pretty normal and probably not because of the meds
I'll probably have someone else call but it'll get done
<:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
Mine does, she usually responds in less than an hour
I have crazy phone anxiety
but
because yeah she'll probably say don't do that
I mean, if I don't get a response today I'll call tomorrow before taking my dose
... perhaps that was a poor choice of words
I've shot off an email, we'll see what the doc says.
new meds leading into much stronger suicidal thoughts, hmm maybe the meds aren't helping <:ShirabeThink:461322366010654730>
but I'm still gonna talk to my psych about it.
definitely
but I never had anything even close to that before
`I'M NOT GONNA DO IT`
more like "hey, nothing's going good right now, you should go buy a gun and shoot yourself in the face"
`that I have absolutely no intention on acting on, mind you`
I was having *very* troubling thoughts on the way home
okay, I need to call my psychiatrist
she wanted me to let her know after two weeks if they started to work or not, it'll be two weeks on Friday
Yeah, I'm aware
yeah
<:gshrug:364316012184600579>
absolutely zero positive effect so far
speaking of meds
was very enjoyable.
getting woken up at 0730 and having to move my desk while in a haze, because I: 
a) don't handle mornings very well and
b) am still under the effect of the sleep meds
today's looking like it's gonna be ***great***

*he said, sarcasm dripping from every letter*
oh wow, did they really?
McDonalds covfefe is better than starbucks
this is probably a controversial opinion but
chill EDM in general
what I listen to is fuckin chill-ass future bass
Loud-ass dance music with a kick drum and like, maybe a hint of a melody sometimes is what I think you meant
rave definitely isn't my jam
oh damn I would hate to be in that car but I'm glad you had a good time <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
What kind of music
That's some good shit right there
amen, sister
`not to imply that it's gone stateside but I feel like my intent is clear`
that was a rhetorical question, and I was under the impression that homophobia is still the norm in most of Japan
Japan, I swear
like, thanks for changing it but why was that a thing to begin with?!
***W
H
A
T***

first of all, I got Tharja and Rhajat mixed up so thanks for figuring out what I meant

second of all: ***w h a t***
***what***
Yes, thank you
Oh, I thought Tharja was the only female character that FCorrin could S-rank
That's basically my opinion as well, well said
"it'll piss people off if we do this, let's fuckin do it"
yup, that
I have to assume that the heavenrend on Basa's armed gear was just them fully committing to the thing they know is kinda bad
it was awful
my role on the teamspeak of yore was "Ame no Habakiri" and for one April Fools' Day the server owner changed it to Heavenrend
fucking heavenrend pisses me off so much
I'm assuming this is the "team neopolitan" bit
oh okay
*what*
including my own
<a:This:447898938796933120>
I feel like we've at least met in the middle with "okay some things need to be translated non-literally due to idiomatic usage"
specifically, how much localization is okay
we're talking about localization vs translation
a little overwhelming, at this point in my life
strict time limit, and the sheer number of people that are depending on me that just makes it
But it's more the
I'm under no delusions like that
so yeah after tomorrow I'd like to take a break
`I'm sorry`
but because of some very nice offers, they'd still be able to have a story ready in time for the next occurance
I'd think that they wouldn't want to completely stop, but would probably want to go on hiatus until they sorted out a few of their personal issues
that person would be very grateful for the understanding, i'm sure
so they (hypothetically) have just been wallowing and hoping for motivation and energy that just isn't coming
but they also have really not been feeling like themselves for quite a while
well, in this hypothetical, this person really enjoys doing this kind of stuff

`what if someone is in charge of writing a story for a group of other people but they have been feeling miserable and completely unable to be creative for over two weeks and is now additionally very stressed out and worried about letting said group of other people down`
that in no way reflects the real world or any current situation whatsoever
I have a completely rhetorical question
so
"Never attribute to malice what could be adequately explained by stupidity."
in practice I do have some level of tact
That was merely an example
"Oh so you're just being homophobic! I understand now, thanks for clearing that up"
"Oh, what's a trap?"
"If it's a guy, what not call them a guy?"
oh yknow what next time I'll play dumb and ask them to explain everything about the term
That was to Ibu's "traps are girls" comment
Or men, but yes
except sometimes the "traps" are just feminine men who don't identify as girls at all
<:NononPout:454088299963875349>
I hate being new in a place and not feeling comfortable enough to call them out on that bullshit

I think the idea that "only people who are X can play characters who are X" has problems, but in this case yeah at the ***very*** least it should have been a man of some description rather than a woman
So that's nice
The headache is actually starting to fade a bit
<a:PicardFacepalm:396333078534029313>
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
So now I'm fuckin tired ***and*** my head is killing me
That sleep meds don't do too well with headaches
So it turns out
the math checks out
>being an ass
>person
how was the border crossing
welcome back
And you don't wanna do that even a little bit
That'll just put them on the defensive like any other human
Even then I'd be veeeery wary
General rule: no fuckin jokes with cops or border control
<a:SakiShock:454116812276105227>
Yeah she left the server, probably temporarily
Good because it's less to worry about but bad because there's no tangible benefit from that cash
Paying off debt feels good and bad at the same time
**SHINING RESODESS**
This is vidya game money
Nah I've already got pretty much everything I'd immediately want
No hard feelings
It's a small business, shit happens
It's already hit my account
My boss straight up forgot to pay me so when I poked him he sent out a fast-tracked deposit with a little bit of extra cash because of the fuckup
`BIG UPDATE ON THE PAYCHECK SITUATION`
So this is very effective at that
I'm not trying to lose weight, I'm just trying to make someone else happy
Chips status: ***demolished***
`GOHAN`
***GOHAN***
It's got chorizo *in the cheese*
Best mistake I've made in a while
I said fuck it and I'm eating chips and queso at this restaurant
that's a surefire sign that she (or at least the rep) knows they're sitting on a fucking landmine
I need potates
potatoes are what kills me
but I ***miss carbs***
no issues whatsoever and I honestly think that even if I don't continue with the diet I'm definitely gonna drink way less soda than before
I just completely swore off soda
yeah, and there's some good stuff like
it's aight but no fries ***suuuucks***
so here we are
My mum promised to get off my back about getting a job (even though I ***have one already*** but that's another story) if I tried keto with her
Like, depression is bad but depression without comfort food is even worse
And pizza, and rice
I've been missing burgers and fries very much
No carbs <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
No popcorn on this diet
Fuck I just realized
The entire second half of Kill la Kill is pretty great with popcorn
I do get popcorn for anime binges sometimes though
I can't remember the last time I saw a movie in theaters
<a:PicardFacepalm:396333078534029313>
Definitely not
Ideally both though
I think writer ***or*** consultant at the *bare minimum*
fuck em
so now
I mean, I didn't even think they were worth the time of day before this whole thing
they're not worth it
Don't bother
I hope you didn't go back to Valk
I'm willing to bet there were internal issues before this shenanigan but yes it was a bit odd, and suprising, to announce outright that they fired both of them
well it's good that he's responsive then
oh ***good***
I'm growing more and more concerned with every message
I've never really been interested in one
I have no idea
If he wasn't so nice about the "I really don't want this client" thing I'd be raising hell
Yeah it's fucking late again, one week is an accident two weeks is a Problem
Let's just say I'm glad I've already got enough gas to drive to LA
Fucking hell I think I dreamed getting my paycheck this week, is it late again I swear to god
Oh, glad he's okay!
My boss is strict on policy but respects my opinions and requests and honestly I couldn't possibly hope for more
I told my boss that I didn't feel safe at a particular client's house and he took me off them no questions asked
Today's shaping up to be a great day
Fucking hell I had no idea Rise Against covered this song though
The "no thanks" has been communicated
Granted this was years ago
The second time I was kicked out was because my mum snooped in my Gmail and found some emails that I had sent to someone venting about her alcoholism
Probably not? I'm gonna tell them no thanks and hope it was a genuine offer
https://youtu.be/shhIMz2tFCU
Also what the FUCK RISE AGAINST COVERED THAT SONG
My passwords are fine
I mean, I do already
Damn now I need to listen to that song now
<:utazukine:439933437797728266> *Into my heart it will creep*
<:utazukine:439933437797728266> *Paranoia strikes deep*
Like I'm sure that Keeper maintains separate accounts but like
They have indeed
Or literally anyone else except maybe like, one person and even then I'm like "but they're my *passwords*"
I'm not sure I want to upload *all my passwords* to an account related to my parents in any way, shape, or form
My parents apparently bought a family subscription to Keeper, which upon a quick google is a password management service
In practice there's lots the cops can do about a peaceful protest
I'm sad I took the effort to read that photo
It's only like an hour away
"I have business up in LA"
"Oh okay have fun"
It's actually my mum's but she said I could have it. Looked at me a bit funny because she doesn't know *quite* yet but still
That definitely doesn't count
I keep telling people that I'm cute on the inside and so eventually that'll start showing up on the outside <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
But fuck the haters
I didn't say I *am* cute in the jacket
I said I *feel* cute in the jacket
<:FerrisThink:465485767905640468>
It's also nearly 100 degrees out but I feel hella cute in this jacket
I have dollars
So this time turns out my bank screwed up and wasn't displaying recent deposits
Doesn't sound too bad but considering my plans I was ***devastated***
All it was was that I was completely out of gas.
I've never had a nightmare *quite* so literal and mundane yet so terrifying
I'm gonna just grow it out and see what looks good
Boss is writing that fic though
Peace l8 I'll be back when I'm done I guess
<:SexyLesionLegs:448607192015306752>
SHORTS HAVE BEEN FOUND
Observation: Fuck that, it's gonna happen, I'm gonna keep looking.
Observation: Normally I would let that be an excuse to not do it
Problem: I can't find any pants/shorts that aren't jeans
<:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
I never thought I would ever say any variant of that sentence.
But yeah looks like this girl is going for a jog.
Range shooting
Bottom is the color I want but suppressors are Very Illegal

It's the coolest looking small arms platform I've ever seen
*I should get a custom made Kriisa Vector*
I think it's Kriss
Or is it Kriss
Kriis Vector, a couple handguns
Yeah, good thing that all the guns I want are tiny
The thing about Informed Consent is that it assumes that you're Informed before giving Consent
Yeah I was reading about that
I *want to exercise*
Like, actual exercise.
Since I actually care about myself again I have an urge to go for a run.
Huh. Wasn't expecting this.
Yeah Latooni I know you didn't mean to upset me, and I'm not getting upset either so you gucci
I got that with my vasectomy last year too and it just bugged me
I always disliked the "its reversible" rhetoric because it implies you think I'm going to want to. I know you didn't mean it like that but still
<@99695384296701952> It feels right. I'm not gonna wait on doing what I want to do
Blood's been drawn, got an appointment next week for my Anti-cistamines
my understanding is that antifa is actually a false flag type deal to make real left-wingers look insane
It's more like "if the judge feels like it, they can tack on additional stuff under this title"
Unless I'm misreading it
That's a fuckin weird name for "additional penalties for doing illegal stuff with a mask on"
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
Keep us updated, I'm worried <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
But that'll come in time
My lungs are *not used to that*
One mile, half walking half running
<a:oof:447819226795999233>
she tried to tell me that I didn't almost kill myself in Tennessee like
oh man she's been pulling the "I know you better than you do" card since as long as I can remember
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
Yeah, that's my name
being called "she", funnily enough
sudden
yeah you really didn't miss much, it was kinda
yes hello <:mariaWave:409855829941157888>
I actually don't much like the archer archetype anymore
but that's less relevant
and other stuff like "I always play bows and arrows" so I started forcing myself to play mages and now mages are my favorite
yeah I noticed a pattern a few years back so ever since then I was trying to actively avoid it
it's just, ***extra*** wrong
not like it would be valid if that weren't the case
the "you can be anyone you want" argument doesn't even work because I have to actively try to not make the same girl in every game
I didn't have anywhere close to the same support network
I'm actually super glad it didn't happen earlier now because if this was during high school I actually would have killed myself, straight up.
100% oblivious
also I love the sneaky "blame video games" rhetoric too
no, I appreciate it
well duh
and thought it was a good idea
she *actually typed that out*
"You're not a trans."
I'll be fine. Honestly this is still better than where I was two weeks ago, mentally speaking
They wanna keep calling me by my old name, they can go right ahead and do so.
Ball's in their court.
I mean, I'm not going to bother pressing the issue.
I might have an earlier out
One of my friends' parents is having a friend of a friend live with them *because their parents kicked them out for being trans*
<:ShirabeThink:461322366010654730>
Actually
But yeah, I'm starting a cert program and it's a two year thing
It's nowhere close to being legally changed and my boss already worked with me on it
Like for fucks sake, my boss has already changed my name in our system
So yeah. Either she comes around at some point in the next two years, or I'm writing the both of them off and taking the loss
Here I was thinking "oh that truism about trans people needing to find their own family won't apply here, I know my parents and they've always said they care about me"
Few days. If this is part of grief that doesn't make her any less of an asshole
They do know, they're choosing to ignore it, and now I get to be filled with righteous gay anger
Look, the reason I told them was so that I didn't feel guilty about feeling sad when they deadname me because they didn't know
My response.

I'm just gonna roll with it, they can deadname me all they want but when there's one less person at the first one's funeral the other one is gonna be real fuckin sad I'm sure
I'm confused and lost! Who would have guessed, right?
That's from my mum, for context.
Pack it up, show's over
I'm not "a trans"!
Oh hey guess what

*cough* `ichaival` *cough*
yeah I love it
That's actually why I hesitate to call myself "MtF" because that implies I was male to begin with
my fuckin friend sends me this shit
them
not
yeah, but I'd do that for me
but I am not stooping to their level
would probably be 100% ok
god, if I went to a "proper" psychologist and got a fucking "diagnosis" they
that was totally me, but I thought it was depression
‚è©
and everything to gain
no real reason to wait
like I said
I'm leading the goddamn charge here
my other friend has been slacking on her doctor appointment until she heard that I already got bloodwork done
I'll keep that in mind, and it's never a gift, just a loan
hopefully that won't ever be me
apparently blizzard is too
really
<a:oof:447819226795999233>
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
also lul
I'm a big fan of trailing vowels
and this also solves the mystery of "why did I ask latooni and dragon to not call me [redacted] in san diego"
like, I wouldn't have picked it if I didn't like being called that
definitely
haven't felt any hint of depression in a week
boss already got my name change in the system
getting my HRT scrip next Monday
"Bitch we didn't talk for two years because you couldn't put down your wine bottle and you're lecturing me on how strong I am?"
is that the escaped "
FUCKIN BOBBY TABLES
Kriisa "Sakimori" [REDACTED]
Can a legal middle name have quotes so it looks like a nickname
Saki as a middle name is something I'm considering actually
thus, two names that I love
yeah but I wanted something *slightly* less weeby for professional, legal and personal reasons
I chose two names and I like them both <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
welcome back boss
<:BikkiDetermination:441154738185043968>
Escaped, or as yet uncontained?
Why is this here, R
That's a Good Kirika‚Ñ¢
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I'd like to think of it as a nat 1 on "being a good person"
Did it not bother you before?
New client, you see
Also that little bit of hesitation with introductions
That feel when you start a sentence and realized halfway through that you're gonna need to misgender yourself but it's too late to back out
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
look at me being super slow
OH! I saw something like that, but for physics.

`XX/XY is like Newtonian Physics. Most of the time, it's a reasonable approximation of what's going on, and for most people, it's close enough. But it doesn't cover everything, and it gets a lot of things *very wrong*`
Take any issues up with her because I've got very little idea what's going on
I'm not much of a biology gal but Glitch actually addressed that a little bit

`Genotype isn't 100% of sexual determination, incidentally - you may be interested in googling SRY activation failure or androgen insensitivity syndrome - and there are a number of other viable genotypes besides XX and XY`
^^^^
If so that's fine but if it's not what you really want to be called, I don't want to do that
Do you really want us to call you Ry now?
<@!225771411833225216> whatever you decide to do, I and everyone else stand behind you.
apparently I'm an anomaly
headpat
No, I think it's time for me to repay the favor. You don't have to start HRT before you're ready, but you don't need to be on HRT to be the Canada Kawaii Queen
Vi, you were one of my biggest inspirations
like, I don't know which muscles need to do the contract thingo
`shit's hard`
shit's hard
fuckinnnnnnn have you ever tried to move your larynx manually
As with everything in biology:

***It's fucking complicated***
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I was the one who dug up the IP track thing to begin with, I hate assholes who hide behind anon <:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
I might be able to help too
people are shitbags, I swear
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
and biology is, in fact, a science.
Yes, yes we do. They exist outside the previous theory, and another theory is built to include them. That's how science works.
so the XX/XY dichotomy works good enough for most people, but other cases exist that aren't covered. Writing them off as "too unimportant" is like saying electrons don't need to be considered because they're too small.
most people don't even need newton, tbh
technically, extremely small, extremely *massive*, or extremely fast
quantum mechanics and both relativities are ***weird***
Believe it or not, they lie to you in high school
Electrons can be in lots of places simultaneously, gravity travels in waves, light is quantized BUT ALSO ISN'T
Doesn't work.
Ever tried going the speed of light?
lots of places, in fact
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
<:Elf9Seal:432752319017254914>
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
they weren't bombs, they were "entry devices" get your facts straight /s
we keep so much shit hush-hush because it looks bad
Doing social stuff tends to drain the hell out of me
people are shitbags, not surprised <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
I probably should again tbh
I have in the past
High end of the normal range
My platelet count is very solid, incidentally
Platelets *are* serious
Everyone cool has secret emoji servers
üá¶ üá≥ üá¥ üá≥ üá™
<:plateletAnoneAnone:467220776387608586>
What server is that from
I'm gonna need that emoji like, yesterday
Makes a world of difference
you didn't do shit except end my years of depression
just realized that
also, what's with the implication that girls can't get upset about unexpected expenses
Let me check my next week schedule
She likes the passive-aggressive stuff way more
Oh I have no idea if my mum would be that confrontational
They're not worth the fucking effort
Also, don't bother correcting them after they misgender me if/when it happens around you
When were you planning on coming up anyway
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
More like DEFCON 2
He also gave me back the difference, so the money issue isn't DEFCON 1 anymore
My dad did help me carry some shit but he didn't even try to apologize, just said "your mom is being a knucklehead"
So we've moved past the "ignoring it" stage and into the "fuck you" stage
"that's not a girl..."
OH HEY WHEN I GOT UPSET WITH HER ABOUT IT GUESS WHAT I HEARD AS I WALKED UPSTAIRS
Like if maccas didn't have their "big sandwich for a dollar" deal I probably wouldn't be able to eat lunch
This week scares me.
And I need gas because my clients are in every goddamn corner of orange county
My parents gave me $40 to go pick up their $60 bottle of bougie wine and this is quite possibly the worst time all year for them to do that
And my tethering app is linked to my old phone so I have no internet on my PC!
Mum has removed the router from its place in her bedroom
Update
So
oh man, being introduced to new people by my deadname and my mum had the *nerve* to ask why I was giving her an evil eye the whole time
cinnamon roll eating a cinnamon roll
If I went is that like
back off
I was her friend first
honestly though like, I've been doing really well even before the meds
That's what my other therapist is for\
Also seeking validation that I'm not just being petulant and she is actually in the wrong
I'm less looking for solutions and more just *really needing to bitch about it*
But yeah i mean
Needs a FAA certificate
I'm studying to be an aircraft mechanic
Out of state isn't because my cert program credits don't transfer last i checked
Anyway I was actually looking for another job before just to shut her up but her attaching my name to it makes me not want to out of spite
***YES***
But I am
If I wasn't in the middle of Orange County CA then yeah
It is, but the rent is free
23
Yeah apparently I should be working my ass off for corporate America until I earn my free time
She's gone on record saying that I should not be able to enjoy myself until my mid 30s
But it's not a "proper" job because it gives me free time
Yes she is well aware that I'm a tutor
Being treated as a person is conditional on having two jobs apparently
And I'm working 30 hours this week for said job
Continuing to ignore the fact that I have one
"I'll call you by your 'name' (her air quotes) if you get a job"
Apparently mum wants to make a deal
Oh wowzers
<a:nini:465064391692255232> <:MichaSleepy:432445419071733771>
It's more like just the "I'm always right" part without the other 'justification'
It's not that, that's actually far too well thought out.
üåï <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>

BARK at the MOON
And Kyoushitsu Monochrome is just really really sweet and it makes me cry every time
Duo Shout is great too
Closely followed by Makyuu Ichaival and Tsumugu Mono
DANGEROUS SUNSHINE
Like when I picked up <@99695384296701952> in San Diego I was blasting Gizagizagiriri
Geah music is my driving music most of the time
I'm not a fan <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
<:ShirabeThink:461322366010654730>
Because he didn't seem malicious at all about it
Honestly I'm tempted to believe that my mum lied about telling him
<:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
Kept misgendering me but also called my mum a douchebag
Probably? My dad seemed to be on my side, kind of
So hopefully I can actually recuperate from the hell-night yesterday
*sighs*
I'm much less busy today
They're the only ones
But not my parents.
Literally everyone else I've told has been incredibly supportive. Friends, my boss, my colleagues...
Yknow what's really fucked up
I jest, mostly
<:Eggimori:463997397392031755>
Might want to reconsider
Hey scrmz, you're a guy right
If I went into uni straight out of high school I'd have a computer engineering degree and nothing to do with it

My hobbies are staying hobbies for exactly that reason

That's where <:DMJii:458047433067200512> came from

Those take *months* to even start
I'm gonna be kawaii a f
I started my hormones like three days ago
Uuuuuuhhh like, two, three weeks ago?
For reference, after I made it it was relevant for less than 24 hours

"Hey can Trump Jr come visit"
Orange boi
Like they're gonna wake up one day and their daughter is gonna be *fucking gone*
they clearly don't want me any more
that's a personal thing, they're giving me a month but I wanna get out asap
two weeks?
uuuuuhhhhhh
EVERYONE WHO LIVES IN BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND MICHIGAN: I'M GOIN ON A ROAD TRIP, WHO WANTS A KRIISA VISIT
honestly
I could definitely do that
where is "here", I forget
so like, 3-5 days depending
33hour total from here to Grand Rapids which is what we're looking at right now
Like, 10 hours
I could definitely swing down to San Diego for a day or two as a going-away thing
I'm looking at like a three day road trip anyway, so like
Well, I mean
not "just as expensive"
I'm looking for "less expensive than California"
So far I've got Kentucky and Michigan on the list, any other suggestions
So I'm looking at some other options now, based on a few friends and FAA certification offerings
The only issue is, this area is ***hella expensive***
Which honestly I'm perfectly okay with.
My mum sent my dad upstairs to tell me that she wants nothing to do with me anymore
Alright, shit's finally coming to a head here
They make a dildo that's just a smol dragon called Meng
Really cool dildos
And also a messenger bag
Bad Dragon makes some fuckin awesome sex toys
True, Alice
You're ***underage*** how do you know about bad dragon
Oh, you're familiar?
so I could just use that
I actually already have a messenger bag from bad dragon
I'm just gonna `hide them`
I'll keep that in mind
I think they think I'm a junkie
my dad also took my lighter?
bandaids and shit
the advil is missing, some blister pads
*why were they fucking with my medicine cabinet?*
Followup question
ooooh boy
but those ten seconds
Luckily they didn't take my hormones, they were just on a different shelf
I opened the medicine cabinet and like, everything was rearranged and a bunch of shit was missing
Okay I nearly had a heart attack
Sounds like a plan
around Aug. 15
okay so with current plan, I'd be heading out to Michigan with about $2k, a month's supply of meds, my shit, and my car
a generous benefactor or some crowdfunding or something I can maintain them just fine
Which I can't justify right now but if there's like
I mean it's like $11 a month
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Shirabe is also on that server
`I'm going to have to stop hosting Kirichan`
Pandora sub cancelled, FFXIV sub cancelled...
<@!99695384296701952> You can come up and hang at some point between now and then but you wouldn't be staying over at my place, and we wouldn't be able to do anything that costs money so idk if you'd even want to at that point
So I'd probably wanna fuckin bounce right after that so I'd have a month of meds to find a new doctor
August 13th.
So I've got an appointment with my HRT doc on...
because that's the time frame I'm working with right now
Alice would you be able to do that in early-mid august
They're never hearing from me again if all goes well
With the family, yes
I've got a month to scrape together what I can and then I'm peacing out
Yes Kerrik, it is silly to move out without steady employment and a load of cash. I don't particularly have many options
Anyway shower time
Seems par for the course tbh
Pff yeah
The second time, my parents told me they stopped drinking so I was like "oh maybe they can be not-abusive"
No, the first time my parents felt bad for me because I had awful roommates and invited me back home
I'll be fine
Kerrik, I've done this twice before
Yeah I'm hoping this time I don't have to come crawling back
I'm hopeful.
I'm not sad
But somehow
Like, I'm *very* stressed right now
I didn't drown four years ago and I'll be damned if I let the universe pull me under again
I've been kicked out before, I know how this works. This time they're being generous and giving me a month
Or last year for that matter
Better than I was last month
Normally I say hi in <#336297387863703552> but people seem worried about me here so here I am
Mornin folks
<a:nini:465064391692255232>
Goonight everyone
I've done enough bitching lately, time for me to sleep
Anyway
So yeah
Kriisa is my pathfinder character
but shit's come up and I need dosh more than camping stuff
Whenever I can, yeah
Backpack (Flash 45) and sleeping bag (some random 20-degree rated bag)
in no particular order
Tomorrow is my "day off" which means errands:
```
1. Lunch with boss
2. Return a bunch of shit to REI
3. Grocery store
4. Ship old phone
5. Sort out cancelling my classes
```
And I'm actually just gonna go the route of "get job experience and then take the test" rather than "go to class and take the test"
My boss is fucking awesome
I talked to my boss, he's gonna give me a fuck load of appointments so I'll be making like $750 a week until I leave
So dream is a bad word to use
My dream was for them to be supportive and help pay for electrolysis
It was awful
And the North was like "hey no wait that's not fair, they're not people"
Basically, the South was like "y'all aint people, but we want you to count as people so we get more votes"
For those of you unaware, the "Three-fifths Compromise" was a slavery-era act that ended up counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for the US Census, and by extention, the determination of the number of representatives for the state in the House of Reps.
<:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
I'm not sure whether to laugh or jii
Ten, did you do that on purpose
*Oh good I'm not the only one who likes that kind of thing*
<:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
It came up naturally in conversation I swear
My three friends were clearly not expecting that because they laughed for a solid minute afterwards
"I like having my dick played with, but also, `shoo`" - Me, five minutes ago
It's not so much "I'm sad" and more "wow things are going surprisingly well and I need to make the fucking most of it"
Is it a bad use of funds to buy some Mental Health Chocolate
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
`It's actually the Kriss Vector iirc`
Indeed it is
Especially dangerous to admit publicly, might I add
A useful skill, but a dangerous one
You're fine
This is <#336297840529899522>
Ibu
Zero-sum is fine in multi-player online stuff
At least in any of the really awful loss scenarios
I enjoy studying it but I don't like participating <:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>
If you're wanting to get a group together, take it to <#337805317276565525>
They really like to make connections
I don't trust brains
Well yeah I don't think anyone takes it too seriously but like, psychology is weird
It sets a dangerous precedent, I think
But yeah idk, bold-faced lying to your friends for the express purpose of winning a game never sat well with me
As teams
Whenever we play it's always us vs coms
Can't play Civ vs friends though
Nah if the competition is skill-based or otherwise straightforward I don't mind who's on the other side
<:KiriScare:442974591296733194>
I enjoy competition but don't lie about it <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
Subterfuge amongst friends doesn't sit well with me
So I do stupid shit like March to the Sea
I don't particularly enjoy it but sometimes I get roped in
in Risk I always roleplay Gen. Sherman and just make lines of troops to the nearest oceans
Throw in some stuff about the cotton gin, and Sherman's March to the Sea as well
Georgia was "we were one of the original colonies! Sure we had slaves but so did everyone else, ***did you hear about Jimmy Carter tho***"
I'm being *slightly* hyperbolic but not by much
I hate it because they leave out all the awful stuff and just shove "MURICA IS GREAT WE FUCKED UP THE COMMIES YEEEAAAAA" down our throats
Controlled substances in general is just weird
`It was #13 right?`
And somewhat made irrelevant with the Thirteenth(?) Amendment, but the fact that it existed at all is just horrendous
The "distractions are less distracting" applies to things you didn't know were distracting
But I'll take it
Almost certainly placebo
It's pretty great, even at low doses
Estrogen only works if the person wants it
<a:headpat:453406859194269716>
Especially when a light puff on hot food is perfectly acceptable imo
No reason to yell at people when they have no idea what they're doing is wrong
Yeah, I feel you
My parents were kind and caring until I turned 13 and they discovered how much they liked alcohol and poker machines
Lots of folks have that experience though, myself not included
That's not exclusive to parents, that's actually kind of narcissistic but I hesitate to give that label to people who I've got next to no knowledge of
health insurance that covers transition expenses.
he's going to give me an 1100-1900 work from home job in Michigan, pay for my gas there+deposit for the apartment, ***AND***
my boss *really* wants to keep me on staff
***GOOD FUCKING NEWS***
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
I think when I get home I'll do a couple laps of my block and then shower for half an hour
But who knows, maybe there will be weird complications or something
I'd imagine easier because the tubes are already cut
I'm still not able to figure out if my previous vasectomy is going to make my recovery from that easier or harder if I were to get one
And yeah you need an anti-testosterone (usually called anti-androgen) as well
There's also creams, I think, but I don't like those so I didn't bother looking into them
I've heard the patches like to fall off
<@183785454447886346> I take my estradiol via pill
the second I'm out of this house I'm never speaking to my mother again, I think
I mean it just makes it easier to get my paperwork from them, and less stress in the meantime
but thank you, regardless
hey, I'm not *that* fragile
honestly I don't care what they think anymore so if it helps them sleep at night then whatever
specifically "our son" which is factually false but yeah that seems to be what's going on
I'm very confused.
so now I'm just moving out instead of being kicked out, which is an improvement?
and apparently the news got to my mum and they're not kicking me out anymore but she also used my deadname when telling me they weren't
I told my dad (because we're still on speaking terms) about how my boss was going to make me full time and he was happy for me
So it's weird right now
Also glad to hear you're not squished, Kerrik <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
It gets better
*pats Kiri*
WFC do you really wanna have a "haha your favourite character is dead" fight right now
Mami understands me
<:mamibliss:366003511961321473>
Like I already was but goddamn that call was just <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
oh my god I am in such a good mood
*being in a position to negotiate is really nice*
I was like "yknow what would make me accept this offer? health insurance"
Apparently he wasn't expecting me to ask for that
I fucking know right
gone
that is so much stress that's just
that question was what really sold me on the "yup das me"
*slaps that shit billion times*
realized like, a bit over a month ago that hey, guess what, it's dysphoria
yeah I spent my teens and early 20's in pretty awful depression
The thing is I didn't "decide to change genders," I just realized that I wasn't a boy and I came to terms with it (apparently rather quickly but I also realized rather late, so <:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>)
It's... Not quite like that?
Um
<:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
yeah there was an honest moment where I was like "wow I guess she finally got over it"
the guests are aware because I told them a week or so ago, they're over a lot
second they leave, back to deadname
we had some guests over yesterday, and she used my real name in front of them
and like okay the worst part
not unless something severe changes in her mindset
Yeah I don't want much by way of clothes but I want some cute long socks and a nice winter coat
I assumed that was what you were talking about
I-something-desu
My birthday is Sept 17 but I'm leaving Cali on the 12th
I need to get some striped stockings for the Michigan winter
It'll kill time too so I can get food when I'm done
But I'm gonna do it
It's gonna take *forever*
This is a very good reason for me to actually shave my legs today
I need those in my life
Oh my god I never considered pink blue white strips on the stockings
Because Michigan is much colder than Cali in the winter
Did I miss the waxing discussion
Kiri says boots though
dess_choose knee-high socks;knee-high boots
Make sure you get lots of rest tonight
Negative spoons is *bad*
I need to stop biting my nails
Probably but it'd be awkward to do so, what with all the bending
*oh my god my shin is so smoooooth*
I'm going to next time but I didn't want to wax the forest
<:NononPout:454088299963875349>
Those aren't synonymous
I like sex but not BDSM
`What if I told you wanting to be a girl and being a girl were the same`
I'm not a dom either though, I'm just outside that whole thing
None of those fit me
Well I don't want to be a catgirl so I'm not *completely* cookie cutter
Huh.
Wait is "transgirls are programmers" a stereotype
The wrapper actually has really good docs for not-errors
And it's also not my fault that the exception thrown is undocumented!
Not my fault the discord api wrapper doesn't like that!
So splitting them into two seperate scripts solves the issue entirely
Shirabe kept taking naps because whenever she was trying to look up an image, if she tried to send a markov message during that time she'd throw an exception and give up on everything
Oh thaaaaat was the issue
I always felt sad when people online asked my real name because it meant they were probably gonna stop calling me Saki
Anyway
Her name is Yuri Girl, I was using the proper noun
I've met lots of guys, girls and other miscellany on the internet
Kerrik and I did spend many an hour talking about all manner of shenanigans
What, not Boss?
Wouldn't have it any other way tbh
<:ShirabeEmbarrassed:278546061755154432>
I don't think Saki or Sakimori are ever going to make it into my legal name in any capacity
Also yeah my deadname
Did you forget who made Chris Fucks Off Through A Window
Like, Joe, Latooni, Elise and Hana are the only ones who know I think
Oh yeah absolutely
Paypal thing?
Exactly, scrmz
When I decided to actually think about it, took me like three weeks to go from "hmm I actually don't like being called a boy" to "I'm a goddamn girl, fuck you haters"
I kind of ignored mine for a loooooong time
Also Sub/Dom is definitely BDSM because that's what the D in the acronym stands for
Saying I don't like BDSM is definitely not me saying I don't like sex
Red Alice henceforth known as little boss
I call Boss Boss
Who was red Alice talking about
It was before I realized I was trans so it was nice, I guess
I think when I was in San Diego we just used our internet names for the most part
See look I was right
Wholesome Internet culture is calling people what they want to be called
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Would you rather we called you that, or just keep going by scrmz
Yeah no it was completely out of the blue Latooni I swear
Hey I'm trans ***and*** gay, do the two hates cancel out
You can be theistic agnostic which is basically "there's something but no idea what"
I'm an athiestic agnostic. Can be summed up as "probably not, but how the hell can I know?"
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
I actually kinda like Red Alice if that's alright with you, no ambiguity
Who invited you <:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
Nothing in between, either city or complete wilderness
But I also like being in the mountains
I'm definitely a city girl
`by fight I mean "hey can I bring it" and Boss said "sure" `
I had to fight to bring this green with me when I got promoted
That was directed at Latooni, apologies
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Any particular reason?
Oh, Michigan eh
Kerrik, I don't want to live with you, i just want to be neighbors
"made of pure anti-masc particles"
Putting a label on my sexuality is useful because it gets across the "I only date girls" in one word
I've tried dating a guy before and it didn't end up being my thing
Bi is fine, pan is fine, even "lesbian except for a couple guys" is fine
```python
if gay == true or trans == true:
    print("hate") 
else:
    print("do not hate")
```
My experience seems to be a boolean with OR operations
So they add together
Because I'm coming thru Kentucky to pick up Elise
The thing about MN is that it adds like 16 hours to the drive last I checked
<:NononPout:454088299963875349>
***You were being vague with your terminology, how hard was it to just say Colorado***
Indiana?
You Kansas City?
I asked a week or so ago, didn't get very many responses
Is anyone living anywhere close to this line, by the way
I'm also moving, like next month
good pun. <:NononPout:454088299963875349>
I reserve the right to leave and then Latooni will tell me when I can come back
we don't kinkshame in this house
me_irl
<@!173112001684439040> <@99695384296701952> I think as far as niche fetishes I just automatically lose
Sowwy <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
Maybe some time before the end of the year though, it sounds fun
<@127644949884698624> sorry was in the shower again... Uuuhhhhhh probably not because the timing is gonna be tight on my birthday and I want to be settled in
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
and <#336297808221044736> is technically an art channel
this channel is also for "explicit" discussion
`grr.png`

<:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
no eggbeaters or anything, right?
Boss, show me your hands
oh dear lord really
Like, "sometimes my SO and I disagree on what to eat" is completely different from "my dad leaves bruises where nobody can see them"
Life's too short to not be who you are
<a:AngryBear:427315058725486602>
Like, relatively masculine
And racing is unhealthy because slow is usually the best results
I do too but they're "boy" glasses
I feel like if I pull that look off, and add glasses, Latooni would actually implode
I want a nice butt, so I will consider it
Maybe, I'm already a little on the tall side though
That's my professional look right there, give me a while and I'll make it happen
***YES THE ONE ON THE RIGHT***
All I've got are polos
I need some feminine "business-casual" clothes
You're hung up on the "two" part
I was definitely conditioned to "hate the dolls"
Same, scrmz
I still wanna drop like $300 on tracks and go fucking crazy with them
But then you'd run into an issue, like I loved hot wheels because of the engineering challenges, and those are "for boys"
Good point
Have to keep them away from literally any advertising for children
They use my real name when company is over, and as soon as they leave it's back to my dead name
Then when it's me, that's when it really showed that they're just performance artists
See my parents were all "we support LGBT rights, we love your trans friends, gay people getting married is a good step forward"
So like, all that effort definitely paid off
Mostly due to me consciously surrounding myself with good people
Yeah relatively speaking I've had a goddamn parade
So like, it's a Thing‚Ñ¢
And then my parents ignored it for a bit, then decided to give me a month to move out, and are now not doing that, but are still calling me their son
I was stealth at home for all of 4 days before it just got to me
`I wanna wear a skirt but I'm not ready for the stares yet`
Being raised as a boy led to 8 years of severe depression, in my experience
I was apparently born male too, that doesn't mean shit
I don't want to fully open source
If you want to see what her code looks like tomorrow I might give you snippets
Shirabe.exe is written in python actually
I can also help, especially with python
My fucking god I need to get out of this house
"Stop talking like that. You are not a girl, cut that shit out. Girls don't even talk like that."
Go downstairs to tell my mum something, forget to use boymode voice.
Well okay. That was nice.
One in the GLOVE BOX OF HIS 1969 FIREBIRD
One behind the wallmounted TV
"Fcuk you. -K"
One on the top shelf of the pantry. One on top of the fridge. One in the closet of the guest room. One under the washing machine. One underneath the really expensive tequila in the liquor cabinet.
My car is registered in my name, fully paid for. The insurance is paid off until December.
Definitely not
Typo intentional
Then in the middle of the night just fucking leave and put a note in crayon on my bed reading "fcuk you"
I tell my mum "wow you're right, I'm being stupid."
ALRIGHT HERE'S THE PLAN
*I can make a new* ***last name*** *too holy fuck*
okay I'm going to clean out my car in preparation. I'll be around but spotty
***where do they keep these things***
social security card
Birth certificate, passport (I think)
Where is my paperwork.
I need my paperwork.
*oh god how do I pack*
so it's like, I don't want to quit and he doesn't want to see me go
I'm *very* useful to this tutoring company, and I love working for them
My boss recognizes value when he sees it. And is also just a great person. Both things.
*I like my voice* <:NononPout:454088299963875349>
<:BlueMadoka:454043800998772736>
I'm leaving tomorrow.
My fucking boss is a goddamn treasure. He said I can crash at his place for a month, no charge. Private bedroom.
I did look up the phrase. The only things I can find are from shit like "theamericanconservative.com"
I'm very very tempted to go downstairs, tell her I looked it up and "wow yeah that's totally it, I'm sorry" and then go live out of my car for a month
You think my mother has trans friends?
But this is 100% bridge fucking burnt
She was already pretty much there
I was *depressed* for the ***entirety of my teenage years***
I'm not a teenager, I'm 23 years old
I'm not speaking to her, so that's not going to happen
Just got that text from her

Classic universe "fuck you" punch
And I was just telling Latooni on the drive home how I finally feel confident with my voice
That's a fucking coin toss honestly
Sept 12
Boxes acquired
I'll check home depot first because it's on the way
Target sells cardboard boxes?
It's 5:07 pm on a Monday evening
Okay where the fuck do I go to get moving boxes
How do you fucking think ***I*** feel about it
"oh one of my sons is studying to be a surgeon and the other just had an incident where he thought he was a girl, but we sorted that out"
She just wants nice stories to tell her book club
She's fucking wrong about it
So by her logic, I'm not
If I'm not a girl, she doesn't have to feel bad about not accepting me
Correction: she'd say anything to make herself feel better
How can you say that if you haven't heard it
Now I'm incredibly self-conscious about my voice again <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
Thank you so much alice
OF COURSE I CAN FUCKING GOOGLE IT I'M JUST WORRIED
I'm in California so idk
Except Social Security is federal
That's the answer to literally everything in the US
Is it possible to get a replacement Social Security card and birth certificate with nothing but a driver's license
Fuck, my paperwork is in a fireproof combo safe and I don't know the combination
Okay I need to clean out my car, and go get some boxes or something
But the law exists, so unfortunately that ain't gonna happen
If I had free reign and no legal consequences I'd smash everything that isn't nailed down into a million tiny pieces and take the TV from the living room
I also don't want to do anything illegal so no actual damage can be done
They clean under the utensils like, twice a year max
For weeks, even
It's already fucking gone
I'm having a moment here
<@264373970118246400> please stop talking
That's going to be the last thing I do before leaving
Definitely
I'm a vindictive bitch
Yeah that's what you'd do
Oh my god should I do them in pink and blue on white paper
I need to go buy a box of crayons
No drop ceiling, no
In the upstairs fridge
RIGHTEOUS FCUK
I'M FULL OF FCUK RIGHT NOW
One underneath the utensils inlay
One in the mailbox
One in the drawer they keep the remote
One behind the aboriginal kangaroo art
It's weeeeird
***FUCKING AWFUL AND ALSO SUPER EXCITED***
Where else
One in between the fold of the ping pong table
One in the little flipdown sunshield of her mercedes
This photograph.
I only took one thing that isn't mine. We had a photograph taken from the top of Mt Wilson hanging on the staircase.

It's done
<@127644949884698624> <@456226577798135808> <@99695384296701952> <@110653846665056256> <@290431224596660224> and anyone else who may be interested
<:gshrug:364316012184600579>
my boss is letting me stay over until I move
my name on the registration
anti-cistamines are lifesaving
My HRT is safe in an earbud holder <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Including my prescribed antidepressants that I haven't been taking
Oh daaayum, the medicine cabinet has been *cleaned the fuck out*
***that's the true tragedy here***
That the thing I choose to complain about is *reboxing my figures*
Yknow, that says something about my outlook here
That really sucks
Reboxing carefully posed Nendos
Yknow what sucks
And my mum would probably call it in anyway
This is being who I am, in the way that I have to do it
I'm 23 fucking years old, this isn't "running away"
Also: should I go to the local PD and tell them that they're probably going to get a missing persons report, that I'm escaping a bad situation, and that I'm okay?
But all of those documents are conveniently in a bright yellow folder
Which isn't there but that's actually relatively easy to replace
Like, my mum was leafing through looking for my SS card
She doesn't suspect a thing
I'll do it tonight when I leave
Along with medical records and some car stuff, and a ton of other paperwork
Its in an unlocked file cabinet downstairs
***GOT EYES ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE***
And he is, don't worry Latooni
He doesn't know it, rip
And also a med student
I'm heading out to dinner with my bro, he's super cool about it
No
It's going from contractor to employee
I'm going to say that I need some paperwork for my new position
Yeah my boss said tomorrow is fine
My dad maybe
It's a combination lock
And I can't even open it
It's got most of their documents too
My brain says "R is right" but literally every fiber of my being says "but fuck it"
It'll be the wrong name anyway, eventually
If that means she takes out a car loan in my name then fuck it, I can dispute.
I have no intention of speaking to her ever again.
Box of crayons: 50 cents
This is a real, honest to god name, not some fucking screen name
Guys.
Heh, Earhart would be a little too on the nose
*god Jesus fuck I expected a lot of things but I didn't expect a thank you*
I should start thinking of last names soon
"May they have an uneventful life and an unmourned passing."
What was it I said to you, Kerrik
Well know I know they won't bother trying to track me down or anything so that's nice
I mean yeah exactly
***what a bitch***

So I got a text from my mom
Oh my fuck
Unexpected. He only called once
I ain't answering that shit
Hell yeah ignore
>it begins
Just got a call from my dad
Claiming intellectual property on that one
As in, with my camera.
I should know, because I took the damn photo.
Yeah, I'll be vigilant this time, and I've got much better friends now.
It worked on me twice.
I'm well aware.
She doesn't seem to want to antagonize me. She sent me a "thank you" and that's it
They were in an unlocked filing cabinet. Snagged that folder, no issues
My pathfinder character is Kriisa Starcaller but like that's way too excessive to actually use
Oh wow that does sound slick
I give up
Anti-fog
What about Dental-probe
Lauren Tartar-Scraper
dess_google hyphenated dentist tools
My deadname is ***super*** common
I mean, when I do choose one I'm not exactly going to advertise it
the implication there is that you would accept a lewding

I think I'm mostly through the rough part
There's a few ice rinks in Sydney that are open year round, so I wouldn't be surprised if there was something similar somewhere in the states
That's a bit of a crapshoot
The quality, however
Nah, Craigslist and other websites you can usually find roommates
Not knowing anyone makes moving away easier, actually
Oh, getting dollars is the hard part then.
It's easier than it sounds if you have enough dollars
I'm going to change the world in my own little way.
Like I said. She's going to have an uneventful life, and nobody will care when she's gone.
But it's way better than the alternative
Yeah like, I'm still reeling from it a little bit
And I was also horribly depressed
The last times this happened, my best friend was a manipulative narcissist and my "friends" were just friends by proximity
You actually seem rather aloof
So we can't really say anything about too much or too little
We have no idea how much you worry
Happy Souls is one of my favorite videos ever
thank god someone got that
üì£ **BOSS WEAPONS**

***EVER HEARD OF FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS?***
<:SerenaOhoho:449358389563359234>
Ibu the only reason scrmz talked to you in the first place was because I told him to stop being stupid about it
Go *fuckin* ham, not go *fuck a* ham
dess_. Saki Go fuckin ham
what I will say is that y'all are 17-18 so go fuckin ham
we do ***not*** get into age of consent laws in this house
I'm not *wary* of her. I've *completely and utterly written her off*
But he's not harassing me either so that's good
Because he's definitely complicit
I'm not sure if I can forgive his standing by and letting this happen
I've actually got a slight dialog going with my dad, keeping him at arms length and he's defending her but he seems to at least want to *try*
Yeah ikr
She's drunk as hell but at least she got the memo <:SerenaOhoho:449358389563359234>
Just got this text out of nowhere from my mum
I'm not brave.
I sat there and listened to the woman who gave birth to me yell about how I'm not a girl, how the things I'm sensitive about are awful, and how I need to stop the nonsense and I couldn't say anything at all
I packed up and left in the middle of the night because I didn't want to confront them about it
Nothing I'm doing is brave
I thought soap operas were like, super tangled up and awfully written
I meant plotwise
Pff is it really that bad
Now that I'm not living there any more this is actually kind of hilarious
Specifically after using my deadname, actually.
<:SerenaOhoho:449358389563359234>
I love this shit. My dad has been sending me texts saying that he has things that he thinks I need that I actually already have, or asking for his one suitcase back even though he's got a closet full of them. And then he sends me a text saying that "he supports my decision and wants to help me"
***TYPO PLEASE***
The fwb thing was just me messing around
Any chance of you getting out of it?
stupid "self-sufficient" bootstrap culture
but muh "I don't need it, why should I pay for it"
and a therapist appointment on Friday
I've got a doc appointment tomorrow
DM's would be very appreciated <a:SakiShock:454116812276105227>
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
Oh so I should hold off a bit on tops then
Actually maybe the second, the first arc was me realizing that I wanted them
We're still in the first arc of that anime
How do the different clothing sizes work anyway
That's what I'm counting on
I'm nowhere near needing a bra yet <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
But still. *close*
Agreed
It's *close*
But still
Fuck em
It doesn't matter what people think about me
And I know that
"drag queen" if they're feeling *generous*
People see me walking into a dressing room with a bunch of skirts
People see you, they think "oh gifts"
That's different
But also shopping for one is `spook`
I definitely plan on it, don't worry about that
`I'm scared`
<:ShirabeEmbarrassed:278546061755154432>
Very much looking forward to the time I feel comfortable enough to wear one
I ain't gettin neither of those things here
I just want snow this winter and a place to put my PC, is that too much to ask <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
I just find specific people I like and roll with it, any "community" I can find is usually into drinking and partying and I just, don't do that
Haha joke's on you, I feel like that anywhere I go so I'm used to it
I'm limited to US locations for now because a visa would be a ***hassle***
My main criteria are:
Cold
Cheap
...
Yes
I've used it for... 5 apartments in the past
Yeah if you're not careful
But I want to be with my friends. But but the housing thing is stressful
I'll be making more money than I thought and I could actually live alone if I needed to
If August ends and we still haven't found a place I'm tempted to just cruise Craigslist for anything in like, Colorado
Yes
It's just worrying
Yeah for now
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
I'm also out $40 because that's how much the application cost
We were declined on our first pick for apartments so that plan is down the drain
And the other 1 and a half at night
So like. 1 and a half in the morning
From what I could find, it's usually twice a day
Or 6 all at once
Do you take 3/3
My followup is tomorrow and I'm going to ask for 2mg goddammit
But I started on 1mg
Recommended starting dose is 2mg
I've only been getting half the *starting* dose, so I don't really have the full experience yet, but yeah it's noticable
speedrunning is definitely not required
But it was pretty sketch for a while there
My friends now are fantastic and I wouldn't trade them for the world
I... Tried not to
There was a series of events in my life that I like to call "The Fall"
I'm careful now
Already had that happen once
Friends are nice
I do hope we find something in Michigan though
Close enough to know you'll enjoy it, different enough to be a fulfilling new experience
Hey, you don't want the exact same thing twice in a row
I'm probably Scandinavian honestly
I think I'd want to be on the outskirts of Denver though
I'll keep that in mind
Come to fucking southern California, we're made of sun
I wonder how hard moving to Anchorage is <:FerrisThink:465485767905640468>

But I'm glad I'm on the 2 now
Actually starting on 1 has some good benefits that are totally worth

I just got done with my doc and now it's time for fooooood
Yeah, you're good
You're fine
Nah I'm not angry
What did they operate on? If you're okay with sharing
It's not a cheap trip I assume
<:SerenaOhoho:449358389563359234>
This whole "an employer values me, specifically" thing is awfully empowering
And that too, of course <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
He ***really*** wants me to stay local, so if he wants it that bad he can pay for it, I figure
I'm going to give my boss a chance to convince me to stay here
I'm definitely gonna be looking into Colorado, but before I do
So we don't think moving to Michigan is gonna work out
Kirichan can't even do anything with them
dess_convert league km 40000
The whole concept of "leagues" is awful and I hate it
Probably to prevent resistance? I'm unsure but that seems reasonable
Normally I'd say be careful with the meds but since a nurse recommended it, that's probably a good call
That's good, tailor your environment to make the rehab process easier
Less pain is good, keep it up
mentally or physically?
For real though, I'm of the opinion that I need to be happy with myself before I can search for happiness with someone else
Sounds about right.

It's delicate territory
Asexual is sexual orientation, not gender
Cyberpunk is one of those genres that I'm like "eeeehhh it exists" so this is just a "well I'm definitely not interested, as opposed to probably"
Bread, the point is not "an apology isn't good enough," the point is "that specific 'apology' is barely an apology at all, and for the wrong thing"
My egg didn't so much crack as ***explode like a goddamn frag grenade***

`escapism is a valid coping mechanism`
More estrogen receptors, fewer androgen receptors
If this is true in humans, frequent masturbation would help HRT, at least in the brain
```
A 2007 study on rats found that frequent masturbation lowered androgen receptors in their brains. Androgen receptors help your body use testosterone. Another study on rats showed that frequent masturbation increased estrogen receptors.
```
```
a study published in 2001 found that refraining from masturbation for three weeks may cause a mild increase in T levels. Another study from 2003 found evidence that T levels may increase by nearly 150 percent seven days after you‚Äôve stopped masturbating.
```
I could be wrong about that, it's been a while
I'm like 90% sure that if you've got testicles and don't ejaculate regularly your testosterone production goes up?

I went to high school in Australia and it was pretty sweet, but I've heard *stories* from my students
But it sucks ***eighteen different kinds of ass*** in the good ol USA
High school *is* the general education
Yes, exactly
But noooo
Yeah see that's how it should be
It'd be nice if they presented it as a theory and not "this is 100% how the market works also btw command economies don't follow these rules and they're bad"
Yeah but did you have to take economics, or history
But I really wanted those specific fries

I'd also like to ask for why you feel like that makes blatant sexism in the workplace somehow understandable in a company that has its office in, and hires from, the United States.

Hell yes, good mood time. One of the places I'm looking at in Colorado is a shared house but it's in a really great location for the Rockies so I was hoping they'd have me as their next roommate. I told them I'm trans because I really don't want to surprise them with that and then find out they're bigots, and it turns out that one of them is lesbian and the other is a solid ally so we're on for this one
you have to use it a bit to actually build credit
***three whole newspaper postings what***
But it still sucked ***ass***
I was mentally preparing for it, and I understand why I had to
And now I'm in a `mood`
I had to write my deadname probably 30 times on various forms
And since it's formal, legal stuff
I did a shitload of paperwork for my new position today
Okay so
Now I feel guilty for being hopeful <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>

And, make an effort to stop wallowing at some point, but for now it's okay
Wallowing never hurt anyone, as long as you know that you've got lots of people who care about you

Pizza and monster hunter cheered me up
I had that happen yesterday

Yes, Jacq and I have plans to go skating at some point <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
I'm *so* looking forward to skiing this winter
It's just outside Denver, in the Boulder direction
See, my ID says "male" and I definitely still look masculine. Wonder if they would have let me in or not, eh?
Either way, I'm glad I stopped spending money on that game years ago
We'll have to wait for a statement, if they ever give one
I'm actually not sure if they're pulling the "see we tried"
"Seperating the work from the author" is fine, when it's not involving financially supporting a company that does business like this
Overwatch is significantly more toxic than, say, battlefield because of the existence of a ranked ladder, but it's not quite as bad as MOBAs because those are like, 45 minute matches so when you lose it feels *awful*
It's the sheer length of matches and the reliance on other people that causes it, I think
So I wonder if that was the influence there
And I was like "how did we become friends in the first place"
Funny, one of my friends got a job with Riot and we slowly grew apart because he was super dude-bro-y
Or she saw the writing on the wall
I have a feeling that either the culture was already at that point
But now it's making a lot of sense
And everyone was really confused at the time
But one day she announced she was quitting, right as League was starting to gain traction
She was a huge part of building the community
There was a woman who worked at Riot, went by Nikasaur
Yknow, back in 2013
It's "wow you really are pieces of shit"
The popular response on the subreddit isn't "why are you doing this"
I'm so confused
They tried to make up for it at PAX by *banning men from attending their panel from 12-2:30*
Yknow the whole "riot games is run by and staffed by sexist shitheads"
Apparently
In brighter news, these socks continue to make me happy by existing on my leggys

<:Praise:391038800232448000>
"hey my mum took me out to lunch" is forgotten in a couple hours, but "hey my mum called me a f**got and kicked me out" gets remembered for a lot longer
yeah, it's a lot of confirmation bias
Worst case is an abusive relationship
And that's close to best case
You just want someone, and you're willing to look past all sorts of things because "this person is willing to do this with me" and it eats at you for years and years
The `I need someone` mentality is how divorces happen.
Like obviously being depressed doesn't preclude you from dating but you have to be careful about where your happiness is coming from
The thing is, don't build your happiness on someone else. Share what you already have with them, and build it on that
Anything else results in horrible emotional dependency
That's toxic. You need to be happy with yourself before you try to be happy with someone else
If you want personal happiness you have to claw it from the universe's cold uncaring hands
The waiting is exclusively for relationships
Okay let me be clear
And being interested in what they have to say
The real secret to talking to people is to let them talk about themselves
Lots of different kinds of rocks, as it were
There's lots of ways
Oh uh, if you're passionate about something, have hobbies, know how to talk to people
We kept that one in an aquarium at home for a couple weeks and then took it back to the lake
I liked catching fish that way because it didn't hurt them
Outside the allegory and in the real story
So like, don't go out looking specifically for a relationship. Make yourself interesting, and people will come to you
I noticed that they liked to poke at rocks so I put rocks in the bag
It absolutely was
I sat there, and waited, and one just swam in.
But the only catch I remember is the time that I sat in the lake with a snorkel and a ziplock bag
We caught stuff fairly often, and it was alright
When I thought I was a little boy, my dad and I would go fishing
As an allegory:
It saves me so much stress and opportunities just show up sometimes
My advice, if you're willing to listen, is to quit searching for a relationship, full stop.

In other news, I got my blood drawn today, so tomorrow I'll be finding out for sure that my testosterone is still way too high
<:Shrug:388950974817107968>
It happens slowly, and your mindset is literally a magnet to those kinds of people
Literally everyone says that, myself included
Or you're in hell the rest of your life, pick one
Eventually you hit a breaking point
I was in an abusive relationship for almost two years because she cuddled me sometimes
`You just want someone, and you're willing to look past all sorts of things because "this person is willing to do this with me" and it eats at you for years and years`
Because of the #underboob

It should be noted that I personally don't put a whole lot of weight on that, but the society she's trying to skate by in does
As of a couple years ago, though, I heard that she wasn't as conventionally attractive any more, so I wonder how that's working out
Like, she knew she looked good and realized she didn't have to actually work for anything
She was dumber than a bag of rocks
In retrospect it was a waste of time
My first relationship was with a girl who had no brain but big tiddy
I need kisses like constantly

"it's okay to be gay, just stay in the closet so I don't have to think about it"
it's either pride or deep repression, kerrik
its a human problem
lots of trans folks are similarly biased, we're not immune to it either
quite a few gay/lesbian people who love to hate on us trans folks
and yeah the subdivisions happen and shit gets slung and it's a bad time
we get ganged up on a lot so we're already primed to for the ingroup bias
it's the basis of tribalism, yes
that's the cause of ***SO MANY PROBLEMS***
If there's anything I could change about the human psyche, it's the bullshit ingroup/outgroup dichotomy
or "I don't date them because they're more likely to cheat on me"
and "oh you just can't make up your mind, greedy bitch"
and yeah being bi apparently sucks ass because you get a lot of "oh you're just a confused gay/straight person"
there's a decent amount of "fuck you, got mine" going on

stay a while and listen

that being said
same shit, different day
`"Can I buy you a drink?"`
`"i dont know you, i havent taken the time to know you, but i want to ignore all that to take you out for a potential opportunity to kiss you. would you like to?"`
that relationship has a timer on it
so yeah, possessive asshole, who's also just a trash human being
they you apologize, back off, and wait for them to break up because you just found yourself a possessive asshole
and I'm not saying all frat guys are that way, it was just additional adjectives
it's the kind of thing fuckboy frat shitheads say to justify sleeping with their friends' girls
and it's especially bad here because in this case you don't even know that you're the side ho
and not the person doing the cheating
it puts the blame of someone cheating on the person they're with
that philosophy is awful
I usually don't
like, asking if they have an SO is respectful, but it also feels way too aggressive
see, I've heard multiple sides to this and both make sense

definitely a research study <:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>
`For the male and female manipulations, the researchers also played in the matches as expected, but also developed a list of roughly a dozen phrases that were recorded separately by a male and female voice (S1 Text). These phrases were broadcast, during the games, to other players using the real-time voice channel. These prerecorded phrases were identical in the male and female condition, harmless in nature, and designed to be inoffensive. Phrases included: ‚ÄòI like this map‚Äô, ‚Äònice shot there‚Äô, ‚ÄòI had fun playing that game‚Äô, ‚ÄòI think I just saw a couple of them heading this way‚Äô, and ‚Äòthat was a good game everyone‚Äô.`
they took into account MMR and current K/D
`In multiplayer first-person shooters like Halo 3, teams cooperate to kill members of the opposing team outside of a dedicated storyline such as that seen in a single player campaign within the game. As a result, the multiplayer games can be argued to be direct competitions outside of any sexualized storyline or content as they are only associated with the goal of eliminating opponents. Killing opponents results in a positive outcome for the team, while dying results in a negative outcome. In addition, improved performance within a game allows players to attain higher ranks and improve their skill rating, a long-term measurement of player status (i.e. dominance) that is publicly exhibited. We examine how individuals behave toward a male or female-voiced teammate as a function of positive (number of kills) and negative (number of deaths) player performance, as well as player status (maximum skill achieved).

A secondary benefit of using Halo 3 is that players are covered head-to-toe with armor and identified by armor color, rather than facial features or body type. Additionally, player controlled avatars are not the hypersexualized males normally seen in many other video games, hopefully decreasing the overt sexism seen in most online competitive games and minimizing the effect of the game environment.`
they used Halo 3
Men who are bad at video games are more likely to spout sexist bullshit in-game than their more skilled counterparts
TL;DR
https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131613
40% more negative comments at the "girl"
dess_calc (2.66-1.9)/1.9
`Focal players stated more negative statements in the female-voiced (2.66¬±0.36) compared to the male-voiced manipulation (1.90¬±0.34, œá2 = 5.88, p = 0.0015; Table 1).`
hence why that data got thrown out
yup
They removed a couple outliers because they were too rude
`For the examination of negative statements, there were two focal players in the female-voiced manipulation that made 10 more negative statements than the next highest individuals (greater than 5 standard deviations from the mean). As a result, we removed them from our analysis to ensure they did not skew our results towards significance.`
There's a difference
Or rather, less likely to get positive.
But, if you present female and are higher ranking, you're more likely to get negative comments. If I'm parsing that right
So, the higher your ranking over the person talking to, the more likely you are to be nice. The more deaths you have than them, or the less kills you have, the more likely you are to be nice.
`There was a positive correlation between the number of positive statements and the relative difference in deaths (Œ≤ = 0.13, œá2 = 9.44, p = 0.002) such that focal players that had a relatively greater number of deaths than the experimental player made more positive statements. Focal players with a higher skill achieved relative to the experimental player also made more positive comments (Œ≤ = 0.29, œá2 = 5.12, p = 0.02); there was a near-significant interaction with manipulation such that the experimental player in the female-voiced treatment received more positive comments when focal players were of a higher skill level, but fewer positive comments when the experimental player was higher in skill (Fig 2). `
`The number of positive statements uttered by focal players increased in the female manipulation as the maximum skill level achieved by the focal player increased. There was no relationship between the number of positive comments uttered and the focal player‚Äôs maximum skill level achieved in the male manipulation.`
people who died more tended to be more positive in general
`There was a significant positive correlation between the number of positive statements and deaths (Œ≤ = 0.20, œá2 = 14.61, p<0.0001, Table 1) with focal individuals that died more often stating more positive comments.`
but that doesn't seem statistically significant in this sample size
`Of the 147 teammates, 82 individuals were in the female manipulation and 65 were in the male manipulation.`
more people responded to the "girl" than the "guy"
pfft, casuals
`We stopped at 163 as this is a substantial time effort.`
`We played a total of 163 games of Halo 3 in the two manipulations. We stopped at 163 as this is a substantial time effort. Data could not be analyzed during the experiment as the transcripts needed to be transcribed. Of the 163 games, 82 were in the female manipulation and 81were in the male manipulation and players only spoke within 102 of the games. A total of 189 players spoke in these 102 games; all of them were male. This is not to say that women did not play, just that they did not speak.`
If the uncontrollable element is specifically the thing you're studying, ***yes***
`One independent coder and one of the authors coded the comments each player made. Coders were provided with a codebook that explained the coding procedures. Both coders looked for comments and questions that appeared to be directed toward the experimental player and classified them as positive, negative, or neutral. Comments and questions in the positive categories were those that coders perceived as supportive or friendly, while those in the negative categories were those that the coders perceived to be aggressive or condescending (S2 Text). Comments and questions were considered neutral if they did not fall in one of the previous categories.`
Uncontrollable
there are probably ethics problems with conducting a study where you purposely act toxic in a video game
126, not huge but not miniscule either
` Following this selection phase, the selected video files (N = 126) were then transcribed by a professional transcription company (www.pacifictranslation.com.au) by individuals blind to the true purpose of the study and the experimental manipulations used.`

It was a bug, it's still not filled
`x-files theme plays`

Had the numbers typed in
I was about to call my doc to see why my scrip hadn't been filled yet

Parm is talking about the video from earlier
tell him straight up
I really wanted to stop there too tbh
"Hey look at how irrelevant to discussion she is, hahaha! Here's 10 minutes of discussion about her!"
Why post it?
So, if the video is pointless and inane, which you have conceded...
That it's, in my words, inane?
So, you agree that there's really no point to this video?
inane
Like, I'm not saying she was right, I'm not taking her side here, but this video is just...

my mom is fine with gay folks, and *other* trans people

nothing good will come of this
okay, support your cousin by telling them that this is hopeless and you're better off just waiting for them to die

I socially transitioned in like, four days?
and you straight up said "no we're worse"

I'm... actually kind of skeeved that you would disregard what's going on over here
no point in saying what's worse
but my government is taking steps to make it so that I don't exist, that hurts me more than brexit. all about context.

Yes, absolutely! They're pushing for this stuff!
No, I'm saying that it's not `always "can we make some healthy changes to this"`
Several state legislatures writing a request to the federal government wanting to discriminate against minorities is a healthy change?
Removing my civil protections is a healthy change?

HEMA is the medieval fighting thing right?
Archery is super fun too

That was agreement
Nah I knew what you meant
Sport shooting is neato
I'm one of those weird people who wants a gun so I can shoot paper circles at a firing range. If the law was such that it was only legal to store and use at those establishments, I'd be okay with that. Lots and lots of people who like guns wouldn't be.
On *this particular issue* yes, discussion does end up in shit flinging and refusing to budge
Just, clearing up a point
I agree with you that it's bullshit
But again
Not specifically any one government
It's to promote justice and domestic tranquility, according to the preamble
It doesn't work that way anymore
I mean, as written the guns *are* for fighting "the government" but that era is long gone
It's ingrained into our culture and there's gonna be a lot of people who just won't hand em in
Banning all guns won't work because compliance would be super low for a long time
This is the kind of thing that's happening in a lot of America right now.
`Especially after any time Trump brought up anything to do with trans people, ever. Because his supporters listen to him, they hang on his every word. Any time Trump talked about trans folks, the anti-LGBT hate would swell up. You could hear people talking about it to each other over food at diners, at the gas station, et cetera. And in small towns they're super tight knit, almost cult like sometimes.`

as sad as I am that I'll never get to wear the girls' uniform
I went to an anglican high school and, if I'm being entirely honest, I'm kinda *glad* I didn't know I was trans at the time
it can be... a safe assumption.
depending on the religion
<:laugheline:454887887847030814>
Does it hurt people? If no, <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
for real though
you have to want to change, and be in an environment that doesn't constantly enforce the current position
did he
they probably won't
and you realize
but, you see all these old people that are still racist
by personal growth
I mean, they can
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
every sunday morning
oh, yeah
it's why we have the current US administration
this kind of thing still exists
Not always
>usually
Usually less efficient, but cheaper day-to-day
Subsidized by taxes too
When confronted with the reality of how hellish people can be I generally go into a depressive spiral
I'm going to choose to not watch that for my own mental health
I mean. That's why it would cause gatekeeping
However undeserved it is
People will put absolute faith in the test
Sure, because everyone reads the article and doesn't just react to the headline
Yeah someone admitted to being anti-LGBT
Oh huh. TIL
Taisha'd?
Looks like The Gays‚Ñ¢ are at it again, framing those lovely Catholic priests
https://www.thelocal.de/20190104/homosexuality-at-fault-for-sex-abuse-not-catholic-church-says-german-cardinal
Looks like they went with "honorable member"
`google don't you spy on me constantly, you should know better than to give me this one`
The title is even all caps
I shouldn't have clicked on that
Yeah no youtube is already recommending them
Oh jeez, I shouldn't have clicked on that, youtube is gonna start recommending those "SJW BTFO'D BY SCIENCE" videos isn't it
That's crazy, do you have any articles from back then
Oh jeez I didn't hear about this
I like my gender <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
We can look at patterns and apply them, but yeah the exact same thing isn't going to happen
Ugh yeah bi erasure is an actual thing
Because the answer is nobody
I love to shout "who the fuck am I hurting by being who I am"
***fuck terfs***
Fuck it, I will
Can I say it again
But the original is my second favorite film ever, and has been even before I came out
I still haven't seen the sequels
Honestly though I think the original Matrix is the Wachowski girls and then the other two were the studio going "fuck you, we need money"
I had to walk past one of the buildings they filmed in every morning on the way to school back in Sydney
I'm willing to bet the studio had a much bigger hand in the next ones
`there is no spoon`
The Wachowski sisters knew exactly what they were doing <:BasaSmug:497598144083787796>
It was probably producers though, not directors
People are idiots
That actually makes sense
Isn't the human metabolism kinda awful
What's the most useful way to use humans, if you're a robot
Actually hmm
Yay slavery
Honestly, if they're evil they exterminate humans. If they're good, they exterminate humans because we're objectively an awful species
As long as Melua stays squish I will be okay with robogf
Silicon is rigid iirc
Silicone
I want her to stay squish <:sadeline:407082544077733889>
Melua wants to be a robo
I thought the singularly was specifically the "conscious AI assimilates every technological thing"
Dyson sphere that bitch twice
No, fuck the sun
That's a constant
<@290431224596660224> you'll have me for the next three years, if that helpes
You were being almost aggressive, and it sounded a lot like you were trying to call Luci a liar
2018 was a fucking *nightmare*

Night
I assure you that that is not what this channel is for
Is talking about fanart and tumblr really serious?
Here and now probably isn't the time or place for this
Honestly, I'm trans because if I wasn't then I wouldn't be me
Hah, I wish I thought that
But now I know they just wanted stories to tell the relatives
My parents... I used to say they meant well
All As except for one class
And my parents decided that taking away all my electronics for six months after I got one B was the way to fix it
Suddenly school was work
Yeah, that's exactly what happened to me in year 9
that dude sounds like an asshole, but yeah Melua has the right idea
you're fine
<:MikuPraise:526879438420574208>
I like my slime girls as inanimate puddles, y'all are lame
definitely tiddie
nyaa~
`"Hey babe I need an integral"`
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
I'm gonna miss being better at math than she is tho
Melua and I have an agreement, she can become a robo as long as she remains squish
I'm staying soft and squish
`prove you're human`
like "choosing to be offended" is completely bullshit but sometimes you sit between emotions and you can go either way
you can, to some extent, but a lot of it is purely reactive yeah
empathy is basically required for a relationship
it all depends on the people
sometimes they feel like the most effortless things in the world
it can be
pretentiousness is something to look out for, yeah
Oh jeez, that's a delay
And human.
Which makes them complicit
Nothing to do but bail
Vocal minority is complaining, majority is fine with how things are

I nearly killed myself years ago and I don't fuck with those jokes
It's been a weird day.
I also had one of coworkers tell me to jump in front of a car *as a joke*
What the shit is up today, I haven't heard that question in months
I just had three different, unrelated people ask me about my "birth name"

Thank fuck it's not my fuckhead boss, it's one of the good ones
So I'll be losing money by showing up to work
I have a late shift tonight that's only 2 hours long
My car's in the shop, gonna cost god knows how much (that I don't have) to fix
Family is supposed to be a lot of things
Maybe breaking up with someone because they're depressed is a bad move
Y'all are both right
Also, Melua and Kerrik
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Sure but not everyone sees it that way and I'd just prefer to stay out of it
So you've got everything I'll say already
I refuse to comment on the merits and demerits of the theoretical communism vs capitalism anywhere that is being recorded
But in our implementation, the system is ***fucked*** and it's not going anywhere because the people in charge like it just the way it is
I'm not saying anything about the superiority of any particular economic system
Rich fucks want to stay rich.
Why does education suck? Why is the media awful?
That's not the root. You're one level down but keep digging
Ha. No.
Politics class is always gonna have weird folks in it
So, in a way, this was a test of that system and apparently it's working
If I remember right, a lot of our moderation style was "do things in such a way that the community moderates itself"
<@285555416056856576> the fact that this server is still here and still civil with just you is a very good sign, to be fair
That seems like an important thing
Is your eye still twitching
<:DMJii:535188656856498196>
It was a Bad Time all round
I was in a pretty bad spot too after the thing
<:MikuPraise:526879438420574208>
We only just started talking again, pls don't kill yourself
This is no cause for alarm
They are missing mild amounts of brain juice
I should eat my stromboli or something
Go get ur food
<:DMJii:535188656856498196>
It was a good time!
I get rid of my anger by demonizing the person I'm angry at and refusing to deal with them, which isn't the healthiest way of doing things. <@127644949884698624>, this is my public "friends again?"
like seriously this is the textbook way to make sure you never hear from your kids again when they leave
Python is one of the easiest languages to work with, <@!290431224596660224>
so not a chance there
my lab partners were some really cute juniors but I was in 2nd grade
yeah, in second grade I was invited to a high school chemistry class
I was reading at a college level in 1st grade <:laugheline:454887887847030814>
that's what I was doing
well, that and the whole chromosomes thing
going into the "gifted program" in elementary school was the worst thing that ever happened to me
You end up being so wrong, you're right
That's what happens when your bigotry is ignorant as fuck
Which doesn't happen often
That's if they remember trans men exist
And trans men are gender traitors, or just really butch women
Or some kind of patriarchal spy
TL;DR TERFs are people who believe that I'm just a man who really wants to get into lesbians' pants
I have very mixed feelings about ContraPoints
the rule is super heavy handed but it's honestly reasonable
ever heard of a goddamn book?
I mean, I'm not saying this is a good rule but y'all are talking like it's either screen or boredom
no time for comments
I coded the entire thing in like a day and a half!
because I'm awful
external documentation, rather than inline comments
Maria actually has like
Ah yes one of two people that I personally have banned
Amen, sister
Wat
Do you have any reason to think she'd say yes this time?
But yeah in your case that's some bullshit
We're all human and mistakes do get made
It is helpful to remember that
That being said (the following is not applicable to your case)
I hate it when you admire someone, and then it turns out they're not as great as you thought
I've gone on record saying that the world will be a better place when my mother dies
fuck anti-vaxx
<a:headpat:453406859194269716>
how close is the friendship, how much mental health is it costing, etc
that depends on a lot of things
Nice
Vali is a fuckhead who I had to ban because he's a bigot
Valistiri is a good friend of mine who doesn't even know Rakhi exists
witch hunts aren't good for a community
yeah I'm actually glad you aren't
who is this person
Hah yeah, that'd do it
Live-in nanny iirc
I really don't think he's interested in her romantically
you can't really put distance between you and someone who forces you to interact with them
Daijobu
US-UK or US-Euro is Atlantic
US-Aus is the Pacific Ocean
Is that Dante from the Devil May Cry series
I know I wasn't around for a decent chunk but can I come too
Cuddles are the best
I don't really like the "nuke America lol" sentiment
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
My dad is libertarian
Because of how fucking lopsided it is right now
I think that unions are a necessary evil in this current system
Until the union has no power anymore
And leave the union
More people would find out
So if it wasn't mandatory, you'd get a small number of people not paying dues and still getting the benefits of it
If there's enough non-union employees the union becomes worthless
The entire reason unions work is that everyone in that particular industry is in it
Chaotic neutral
That's... Not the best idea but the worst that can happen is that she can't speed up, the brakes still work
That sounds like the same thing
Does she drive in neutral?
It's exactly what you're saying
I'm seeing a lot of "it's your fault I'm hitting you" reasoning from you
The reckless driving is the person overtaking, not the slow person
You're the asshole
If you're the one overtaking on a blind bend
I don't think you should be calling them idiots for going below fhe speed limit, unless it's way under
Causing people to have to unexpectedly merge
Everyone else is going faster than you so you're effectively blocking traffic
If you don't speed in California, you're the one being dangerous tbh
It's scary
I have a friend who drives 120mph on the freeways with 65mph speed limits
But sometimes they're going 20-30 over and I can't
I usually go as fast as the person in front of me
School only teaches people who want to be taught, the rest just cruise through
Ya, downhill is spooky
Honestly I hate people doing that, but I'm not going to call them an idiot unless they're actually going below minimum
Public transportation in the US is a fucking joke
What if I need to go somewhere but I don't like going fast? Gonna ban me from the roads cos I'll slow you down?
The reckless person is the hazard
A lot of places do have posted minimum speeds, for exactly this reason
American interstates aren't always paradise
I was stuck behind a truck doing 20 under for literally two hours on a freeway once
So that excuses you being reckless and putting other people at risk cos you can't wait a bit?
"I only drove recklessly because I was bothered by the slow person, it's their fault"
<:mamishades:366003499093196801>
Stay strong, friend, and if it gets rough we all have your back
I'm proud of you <:Praise:391038800232448000>
Amen to that
Nobody stops and says "hey maybe don't"
And it gets laughed about and people move on.
I've been called a tr*p on other servers. Like, me, personally.
And they're also promoting this mindset that I'm "tricking" people
They're invalidating me and my identity
I'm a trans woman. Many other people here are also trans, but it's not my place to say who. When people ask "are tr*ps gay" they're questioning whether I'm a woman at all
It promotes the kind of mindset that makes me worried every time I leave the house. I've yet to see a good argument for letting people use that word, especially here.
We've had discussions in the past and it *has* resulted in people being banned due to actually throwing slurs or other harmful language directly at people.
That being said
I mean, that's why we allow discussion of the term, just not usage of the term as a slur. If you want to talk about why you think you should be allowed to say it, by all means.
In this case I'm under no delusion, everyone here knows exactly what it is. I censor because seeing the full word bothers me, and I don't want to do that to myself.

Winter, I'm glad you feel comfortable enough here, at least
My plan is once I'm able to rock a nice dress properly, I'll try a suit again
I realized too late to try to wear the girl's uniform at my school
The thing differentiating tr*ps and crossdressers is that one term implies malicious intent while the other does not
You were blessed
That's probably a part of it, yeah <:laugheline:454887887847030814>
Some of them are interested in reclaiming it, and that's fine.
Oof
My dad is alright
My mother gave me a lecture on how I'm not a girl and I'll never be one
Can I teach math at the Symphogear school
Which is nice
They remove one vector for bullying

<:papikaPout:241350709021376512>
`use Kriisa [lastname] transgender` as the address field
and it's been the cause of at least one pharmacy problem too
yeah but it could easily be avoided if my dad sent an email to his HR department saying "hey my daughter got her name changed, here's the court documents"
yeah but it means I'll probably have to wait a week or so while my old office transfers the records
plus they use my deadname in emails which is unpleasant
and won't let me proceed
they're like "hold on this isn't your social security number"
but since the social security office knows me as Kriisa
so I have to make all my doctor's appointments with my deadname
despite the ***court order*** I have
is because my dad hasn't bothered updating my name with his HR department
the reason the name doesn't match
because my legal name doesn't match the name I gave the doctor's office
I can't sign up for online medical records
*god dammit*
She went viral cos someone else posted a picture of her being excited
Yeah that's true
This guy went on record calling everyone fucking idiots, and that it was a team effort working under her excellent leadership
That this other guy wrote most of the project, it should really be his achievement, but the sjws want to push a woman
And pulling up her github commits where she implemented other teams' stuff (with full credit) and claiming that she stole it
Literally making up lies about amount of code
Ugh. The lead developer on the project to take a picture of the black hole is a woman, so of course fuckheads are trying so hard to discredit her
That sounds like some bullshit
Fuck sake
But then google pushes this ad on me
I've been trying really hard to stop looking at comments if there is anything to do with trans people
Yeah google that's really good targeting, I'm very sympathetic towards people trying to call me a man
But I get an ad from some conservative think tank complaining that they can't misgender trans people
I'm just trying to watch youtube before bed
I'm fairly certain that last part is correct
why not reclaim "crossdresser" which is explicitly your word to reclaim?
*at least* as bad
But you wanted to reclaim "tr*p" despite that being
But *why* is the word unliked? If it's just the sound, then sure, but if it's "I don't like the connotations" it's worth thinking about the connotations then
Mine would probably be "huh, I wonder why getting called 'she' felt so good? oh well" so I can definitely second the *please think about this* option
Sweatpants are mega comf
That's valid too
Speaking of, I'm being stared at by the cashier and three patrons sitting here in a wingstop
Forgive me if I'm misunderstanding, Lectric
It can be tricky to find stuff that feels good *and* looks good
A lot of women's clothing isn't designed for wider shoulders, or narrower hips
He's a boy who wants to make women's clothes look good on him
blockbuster
Kodak, Sears, etc
Very common outcome, yes
<@284624539743289345> does that help at all
Sometimes it's "if you're trans we won't help you" but a lot of the time it's "if you break a foot, sure. You want hormones? Go fuck yourself"
Usually it means specifically things related to transition
god fucking dammit

Okay *what*
24 now
Yeah, will be in September
How old do you think I am
it's all online
so many troll farms, social engineering, etc
russia fucked with our elections and half the country is just "ah so what, my guy got elected"
honestly, point
hence the "nuclear winter" comment, zun
another space race, maybe
probably nothing short of an invasion on US soil, which would almost certainly never happen if the opposing force is intelligent
the economy could go tits up and we probably wouldn't see much unrest, at least not in the US
not with how apathetic the current populace is, tbh
then we're gonna either get a fresh start or die out
everything is gonna get completely fucked by greed
global warming, nuclear winter, some combination of the above
if it's smart under capitalism, it's probably exploiting other people in order to increase your own gain
as most things are under a capitalistic structure
I can't really blame EA entirely for the "hopping on the battle royale" train, but in true respawn fashion they did a great job
EA publishes titanfall, makes them release at the single worst time to lower the value of the studio, buy them out
or do what they did to respawn
And didn't think for more than two minutes
*visible confusion*
So what the hell, hotel
In any case, Germany officially recognizes gender outside the binary
Chris explained it to me once
How they address you, or somesuch
Oh it's official government correspondence isn't it
Didn't Germany recently add a third gender option on state IDs
Okay, I think I see what they were trying to do
Ah. Sex.
But still... What?
That would be cheaper, yes
Yeah I'm failing to see *why* this thing happened
If I'm walking around campus and someone hands me a dude bag as some kind of gender celebration I'm gonna flip
Yeah this was a "lets celebrate our diversity" thing
What about closeted trans people
What about people who aren't binary
What the fuck
On the other, far more important hand
They better give me the girl bag
On one, selfish hand
I lost my parents <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
also finding a doctor is extra stress, financial burden
Social lashback, extra health problems, pain of waiting for the risk of nothing
it's not worth it for everyone
because I'm closer to who I want to be
but every minute is worth it
it *fucking sucks*
14 times in 5 hours yesterday
I had to tell people that no, I'm actually ma'am, while wearing a skirt and a nametag
I hate it
hahaha that fucking *sucks*
if you present as female and people gender you male regardless
it's still a struggle
yeah
oh, I see what you said now
<:DMJii:549819519082692608>
it's ***fucking hard***
and not want to subject yourself to the ordeal that is transition
you can be a girl
but she's a girl regardless of whether or not she wants to go through that
transition is scary, expensive, and emotionally exhausting
not everyone does
it's valid
big oof, I'm glad you're okay
excellent
remember that one guy who was like "I'm not against LGBT people but I disagree with their lifestyle because I'm religious"
it's gonna be a good day
I'm going to have a party the day my mum dies
but my granddad didn't acknowledge me
everyone else was super nice, and my little cousin was super interested in my experiences
my grandfather refused to speak to me at easter this year
the greatest lie ever told: unconditional love
Ugh yeah, fucking -phobes
I lost my entire plan for the next 5 years and had to basically rebuild from scratch
my father says nice things but his actions support the "I want my son back" mindset
they turned my house into a personal hell, and I can no longer contact my mother
Yes. We don't ban for first offence unless it's really grievous.
They were warned, twice. They were kicked, twice.
I'd like to repeat that this is a consistent, repeated occurrence with the user in question.
They were banned. The discussion to ban them took time *because we don't do that on a whim.* Their presence on this server is over. Feel free to DM me if you want to continue passing along messages.
We don't like losing members of the community.
We are not jumping at the bit to ban people.
I would also like to point out that in the last three months, we have banned precisely one other person. Said person was the one who pinged @ everyone.
This is the first time you've interacted on this server since joining.
I would like to state that they have been banned, they have been given the reason why they were banned, and we're not overturning the ban because they have a mouthpiece still here.
There was, indeed, a situation.
We've explained the problem to them.
It's a repeated problem, and we've followed an escalation procedure up to and including a ban.
Just like we've explained this to Rukia about four or five times.
If they really want another explanation, you can send them the announcement Melua made.
We've tried to discuss this with Rukia before, multiple times. We've warned, and kicked. We've done what we could to *avoid* having to ban them, but there's only so many times you can stir up trouble in exactly the same way before we have to get rid of the recurring problem.
the first time I wore a skirt in public was *absolutely terrifying*
reminder that the server has an official stance of `FUCK TERFS`
oh yeah y'all have way more terfs
being trans in the uk seems especially bad because of all the forced waiting
What happened there
F
alice why tho
gotta make that money
it's capitalism that's why they're doing it
But these accusations of commie SJWs censoring games
And Zerona, I'm someone who loves Senran Kagura. I like titty games
many games do and do not have titties
Celeste has no titties
If a company like Sony is doing that, it's probably for financial reasons
I have no idea, but it's possible
Have you considered that maybe the games without titty sell better than games with titty?
Alice, no vore outside of <#336297808221044736>
My point never got addressed
aw nuts
not mainstream, not console-movers
niche
the niche games are
How does the logic of "if there was no niche games, it would flop" work
bean for roast crush sippppp
bean not for eat
must bean water
but not to eat
I lub bean
it takes 20hrs to brew
you might also wanna try cold brew
it turns cold and becomes good again
if you put ice cubes
A+
Lukewarm coffee with some ice cubes
I never bother, I just start the brew and then shower
I have a coffee machine that I can, in theory, schedule a cup
Senran Kagura Estival Versus for PS4, a relatively popular titty game (that I really enjoy) sold 200k units
by your own admission
titty games are niche
but like
I think that Japanese games were important by virtue of being additional content for the system, sure
just for the record
also yeah Lily I think art is art
PS3 survived because it was the cheapest bluray player you could buy
whatever group of games you're talking about, you called them niche first
And, again, you called them niche
I was talking about tiddy games
I'm still saying
you're the one who called them niche!
not Japanese
No, I was talking about the tiddy games
What?
Uhm
but I liked what I saw
*almost a year ago*
I've actually started playing Trails of Cold Steel
What is this a list of
transit iirc
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
and it has ended well exactly zero times
I've ignored that... three times
ain't no getting out of it
Look, Neptunalune. You were victim blaming last week, and now you're... I don't know what
it was documented
But see
I had an original xbox, switched to PC and was not around any of the PS3/360 stuff, and even I know the PS3 was for blu-ray
*frustrated Kriisa noise*
Can you *please* acknowledge the titty game vs japanese game thing
you're just reading off a list of points to mention
***Melua brought the 600 up first***
Also *when did anyone deny the price*
that's all I need
just say "oh okay"
please
Can you please, please acknowledge that I was talking about titty games when I was repeating your point about them being niche
I was about to post that
I think that's probably *less* than 10 non-fatal cases
if nobody survived it until 2013
The first documented case of survival is *2013*
lots of people, iirc
:laugheline:
I almost made a really dark joke but it would probably set myself off in a spiral
if I get rabies I'm throwing myself off a bridge because there's not a chance in hell I'll ever be a patient in an emergency room
best to err on the side of "fuck no"
I'm not sure
hmm
or "makes me vaguely uncomfortable for ten minutes" bad
like "I won't be able to sleep tonight" bad
how bad is it, really
Alice
wait
I don't
oh jeez that sounds traumatizing
it's not fair because they didn't
the "why'd you start it here"
that's not fair to them, don't get upset about that
and got moved here
I think it was started in general
Nep, I really don't know what you're aiming for here
yeah that's a "you used this word so I am too" niche
We're saying "the PS3 was carried by blu-ray, here's why" and you're saying "no I talked about video games with my friends, it was definitely saved by niche japanese titles"
Your reaction to "official evidence" and new information is to ignore it, plug your ears, and pretend you can't hear it
Third, I was making a really stupid argument to demonstrate how silly your points were
Second, what exactly does "doesn't click me" mean
First of all, please don't accuse other people of getting angry
I played nothing but flash games online until I was 12, the PC is just for flash games and nobody can tell me otherwise
and you're like naw fam that's not true
with evidence
we're telling you now
Okay, but
why does that keep coming up today
This is a master class in `bad faith argument`
You're denying facts that have been brought up to you because they "don't sit right," contradicting yourself, absolutely outright ignoring people
excited and very disappointed simultaneously and the caps happened on accident
I'm
sorry
***YOU CALLED THE JP GAMES NICHE AGAIN***
also
I'd like to remind everyone that if a user is making you uncomfortable, feel free to bring it up with staff.
but it's not a good look
That's why I support outlawing pennies
No matter how small
Change is scary
I was uwu but now I'm owo

<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
I'm just a meme
For real though, I think <@175163984197058560> would know better than me
*lights shut off*
Currency is meaningless! Eat the rich!
*ding*
It's "fully automatic luxury gay space communism" btw
Sign me up
We're basically trading "IOU this much gold" notes
Modern currency is weird cos of the whole "backed by gold" thing
Copper is valuable, pennies are not
Also ma'ams on drive thrus
It's nice

I pass as female on another one of my discords
But with the Informed Consent skip you can bypass the waiting
Playing casually, you have to wait 6-12 months to get past the tutorial
Hell yeah
And showed up again with a new voice
I was silent for two weeks
Tabletop was fun because
But I already had the angerdess
We did
Adding angry eyebrows to things is one of my pastimes
Nah I had angerdess for a while before that
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I wanted <:DMJii:549819519082692608> so bad that I went and drew it
If we're talking requested emoji
Oof wow
I see a lot of the same, and a lot different
I joined and immediately shitposted my way into staff
but she was here when I got back <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
shenanigans
She wasn't here for the whole
I think Nara joined in January
Empathy can be learned, but often isn't
The staff channel has some interesting conversation regarding my coming out, actually
I once searched "I'm trans from:<@102691114762371072>" and that was a trip
I'm getting better but it's about as slow as my transition
And honestly, wasn't holding it against you, that was some shit
That's not an ofc, I for sure thought you wanted to never see me again
And I'm glad you're still civil with me <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
It's rly nice seeing old people show back up
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
*excited yelling from the other trans people there*
"why did that feel right"
*silence*
*laughter*
"it means she's trans and doesn't know it yet"
God yeah you should have been in voice with us
I thought there might have been a point of interest that made you bring it up specifically
I know nothing negative but like
üëÄ
Why was it so interesting, rakhi
Hatching took a while
Before that tho yeah
Once I cracked
I just went full speed ahead on most things
*cough* speedrunning *cough*
No bully
She's a shy bab
Can confirm, Nara is pretty great
I get ma'ams to my face about 60-80%
And it still took me like two years to hatch
And I was *jealous*
When I met one of my best friends the first time, she was just starting transition
I kinda don't want to hear anything else about Vali ever

We're reminiscing
Honestly I still get it with she/her
Alice being wholesome
just making sure it's clear
I know!
a lot of the cool people here are cis, don't alienate them
and cool people in general
`this is a server for an anime but apparently we're also a trans support group`
I always hated meeting new people online cos my characters were all female and I was called "she" but when they got in voice with me it changed to "he" and I would get sad
I hated everything about puberty, I was ashamed of my facial hair and never felt comfortable with my shirt off
that's needlessly discriminatory
we're not
#selfie-discussion

please don't pick fights
cis girls are jealous of my eyelashes, and a lot of them are jealous of my boobs actually
I actually got a lot of regrowth on my head
because if you get upset, the other party is always in the right
but none of it involved dragging other people to teach me how to do it
I've made dinner at 1am before, tbh

I know how it feels
it's happened to me at least once very recently!
It was me and yes it is absolutely a hot mess

under what conditions can they say nay
that's a big oof
nothing about a 3 year wait?

She's just jealous I'm prettier than her <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I got a lecture about how I'll never be a girl, I'm not really trans, get over it
I wish I had sent a text to my mom
Anyway I have to sleep
I had tummy issues yesterday but thankfully they went away
Oh noooo
Because that's been a lot of it lately
I feel like saying explicitly that this channel is for more than just trans issues
Answers would be nice but the answer is nobody, and some folks just get so upset
Whose life is fucked up by us existing how we want
Who are we causing trouble for
Who are we hurting
Like, okay
<:DMJii:549819519082692608>
Nope can't do it
Trans people want to change their name because seeing their old one causes severe mental harm
Women get married and get to change their name, no hassle
I just
Which just means I'm getting desensitized to it, I guess
It doesn't really ruin my day when I see it anymore

Yeah, I could have avoided speaking to her!
Absorb nutrients from the holders of wealth
Eat the rich
That's how prejudice and discrimination happen
Let's not say people "look like creepers"
"we knew already but you finally told us"
That could be two ways
That sounds like an attempt at being supportive? Maybe?
Lolol
Oooooh good luck

I've got *stories*
Yeah my mother is a shitbag
My mum, through my teens: "why do you hate dressing up so much? You should care more about your clothes!"

Me: *starts caring about skirts and dresses and socks and how I look, finally, after coming out*

Mum: "No! Wrong! Stop!"
EXACTLY
Money isn't real, eat the rich!
A lot of people have this "fuck you, I got mine" mentality about a lot of things
Honestly, sometimes yes
Thankfully (?) almost none of my old friends still talk to me
Ugh, I hate that
I'm glad you can appreciate the good people in your life

Wanting rights is now a political statement.
I just
Dividing stadium bans?
the implication is that they're helping the kids by making sure they don't "turn gay"
Not only are they pulling "for the children"
```
‚ÄúThe calling for us is to ensure that we are relevant and impactful in the community, and that we‚Äôre helping children and that we‚Äôre helping them to be everything that they can be,‚Äù he told the outlet.

‚ÄúFor us, that‚Äôs a much higher calling than any political or cultural war that‚Äôs being waged. This is really about an authentic problem that is on the ground, that is present and ever present in the lives of many children who can‚Äôt help themselves,‚Äù he continued.

Elected officials in charge of making our laws.
And I'd also like to say that 173 people in the house of reps want to be able to discriminate against women and trans people!
And it's not actually going to get voted on in the senate because the dude in charge of the senate has decided no Democrat bills will be voted on
Except it needs to get through the Senate too
This seems like good news right?
Speaking of failing American systems

Headline: held hostage
Got stuck
By Everlast
From "What It's Like"
```Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom that said he was in love He said, "don't worry about a thing, baby doll I'm the man you've been dreaming of." But three months later he say he won't date her or return her calls And she swear, "god damn, if I find that man I'm cuttin' off his balls" And then she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walking through the door They call her a killer, and they call her a sinner and they call her a whore God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes 'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose'```
And anti-choice
It's pro-choice
There's no "pro-abortion" stance, and there's no "pro-life" stance
Want to remove women's autonomy over their own bodies
They're anti-choice
I have to look at "real men love babies: heartbeat 18 days from conception" and a dude that looks like Yorin cuddling a 1 year old
On my way to work
There's a fucking pro-life billboard right outside my neighborhood

`the LGBT`
and placates people who would otherwise maybe actually help
I hate corporate pride.
and the majority of the consumers (cishet people) either get angry and post stuff elsewhere `as free advertising` or feel like they're "supporting the LGBT community" while doing absolutely nothing
I haaaate corporate "pride"
it means literally nothing
Budwiser is being "really cool" about pride flags and stuff on their twitter

on the topic of corporate "pride"
that's a pretty practical application
pls do that
Scrmz are you gonna make software for trans people to be in the bodies they want

not on their facebook
oh god
I doubt they will though
if I see chickfila with a pride icon I will *flip*

I'm sure that never happens in other memes
we're not allowed to be upset there's an entire class of "feminists" dead set on invalidating us
all very legal
they paid congress to let them do that

Arguing with staff about Rule 1
Failing to comply with moderator request
Alright, yes you were handwaving, you're arguing right now, please take it to DMs if you have a problem with staff
"X is triggered" is a pretty common statement that's belittling PTSD, and is used to demean other people's arguments
My initial thought was "oh they just don't want trans politics" but then they wouldn't have worded the message like that
Saying "trans rights are human rights" apparently poses a threat to mankind! Who knew?
r/dankmemes is now on my shit list

see, this is the problem with assumptions
oh, hmm
the Karen/"I want to speak to a manager" hairstyle is commonly associated with feminism. do with that information what you will
I'm glad it's no longer a crisis

Hana I thought we knew you were bi already
that's hardly "Germany"

it'll prob be okay
that feels like something you'd need to share tho
noice
well ofc
yes
how did ny'all meet
I don't see any contradiction there
you can definitely be a lesbian and still like a couple boys
hot damn
ooh specific hug
do you want me to come give you a hug
it's the "tr*p" slur acting IRL and that's one of the reasons it's banned here
lots of TERFs think they get tricked by hot girls turning out to have dicks
it's less that, Frei
like, I appreciate explicit support from cis people but I will absolutely take "hey gurl, you do you"
let me be me, asshats
nobody
who the fuck am I hurting by being who I actually am
Ya, exactly Frei
can't go anywhere with the homestucks associated with you
the undertale fandom was DOA because all the homestuck crazies latched onto it because of Toby
mhm
a big difference
okay, then be clear about that
elaborate
uhm
so everyone should hate terfs
terfs hate everyone
they are
everyone should hate terfs
also yeah being trans fucking sucks
oh, do I have to be trans to hate terfs?
yiss
you what
they hate trans men because apparently they're gender traitors
they hate trans women because apparently we're just trying to get in cis lesbian's pants
<@!266379640069685252> Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist
Most of those people really wanted to perform, so hoping they would actually break their leg would be mean
So they'd wish bad luck to bring good luck instead
Any wishes of good luck would bring bad luck
Also, break a leg was because theater folks were crazy superstitious
Fuck TERFs
Reminder
GNC boys aren't all eggs and assuming they are is rood
and yeah Nara, agreed
you're closeted to yourself
basically, but
an egg is someone who's trans, but doesn't realize it
<:Eggimori:463997397392031755>
oof that was me before my egg cracked
Starbucks doesn't let me paint my nails cos of health hazard
I have a regular at work, this guy drives a bigass truck but he paints his nails and I'm sooo jealous
respect, derp
this is why I refuse to gender people over voice

the author was like "hey might as well let them have this one" iirc
Ferris was retconned to be trans, yeah
yeah
Astolfo I think is just a GNC dude
<a:LilyPunch:517769788806660097>
I'm aware she's trans
I hate people
Lily is canonically a girl
*why is Lily there*
so it's outright banned here
in any case, normalizing its use as a meme makes it more "okay" to be used as a slur
it was originally a meme but turned into a slur
but it's being used as a slur against real people
it started as an animeme
actually the inverse
tr*p promotes this mindset of "oh they have a penis and they're tricking me into being gay because they're totally a boy"
they have an FAQ for trans women
actuallesbians is so wholesome
it's often racially charged, yeah
<@456226577798135808> pump those brakes, kid
<a:badelaugh:428703436566036481>
don't do it again, eh
It's fine, just
Sorc, you came close to an official warning with that
your ass is grass
if I see *one goddamn person* mention helicopters
<:enbyheart:549053521203429376> ‚ùì
I was just too dumb to realize "hey bitch you're trans"
and when people would use she/her for me I'd be really happy
I always play girl characters in mmos
just, in my case that was something I felt too before I came out to myself
and yeah, that's perfectly valid
it happened to work for me, but that was really lucky
it's invalidating to their current identity
never ever call someone else an egg
<@272035441312530434> that shit is why I have to *wear pants to not get beaten up*
god that's fucking awful
üíú
I only ever wear pants when I can't be fucked to shave and need to pretend to be a boy so I don't get assaulted
I rock dresses and skirts most days
Derp, I'm glad a lot of my fancy clothes are open
either they're guy who likes to dress as a girl, or a trans woman, or anything else
No, absolutely fucking not Viper
I have a cute purse
I don't miss pockets that often
nah we don't automate moderator action
that's fine
like I need to get a live-capture trap for some rabbits that keep fucking with my garden
we're not idiots
I self censor cos I don't like typing it in this context
no, not autobanned
Hormone Replacement Therapy
if the parent is a man, father is fine
you gucci
Viper, use "cis" instead of "naturally born"
I'm going to let you try that sentence again, without implying that me and my sisters are "mentally male."
*blinks*
regardless of genitalia
I know a lot of straight men who *won't* date a trans woman.
for others, no
for some people, yes
what's your point
okay, but yes
no-op is not wanting it at all
I'm pre-op
they are different
Since you insist, both pre and post op. And no-op, because that's an option too
you're right, it's an arbitrary distinction
I've seen *quite a few* straight men who are okay with dating a trans woman, but not another man
I'm a lesbian, but I like dick if it's on a girl. You wanna call me bi, I'll call you a douche
not synonymous
which is often correlated
and that's androphilia
not phobia
love
no, philia
you love goochie
but not synonymous
which are generally correlated
that's less "straight" and more "gynephilia"
this is clearly not "this is what I feel"
I see a lot of projecting on everyone else then
Melua's is rly nice yeah
but I like girls and whatever that girl is packing
I don't like boys
Derp, I'm a huge fucking lesbian, but penis doesn't disgust me
don't get it twisted, there are some douchebag trans people too
Age of consent discussion is creepy imo
this Kiri is too smol
but not this Kiri
Kiri can sometimes be lewded
it's almost like we're talking, even though we're typing
I do the same, actually
<:yayakaShrug:286284426541924352>
But if I start talking about my kinks, is that disgusting or a turn-on
but you aren't attracted to trans women?
You're attracted to girls on a mental level
So, derp, wait
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I'm a girl and I want to be collared
but not mine
it's a valid perspective
I don't really like that take, it doesn't feel like me
okay, so yeah
okay you've confused me now
thanks
okay now I have a more concrete reason why I don't really like contrapoints
does she really
I'm expected to know all her videos and agree with all her points
she's very popular, and trans, and so she's often treated like our spokeswoman
~~I don't really like contrapoints~~
so we *have* to fight back
except they're usually convincing other people that we don't deserve basic human rights
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I am what I am?
just to explain why I exist
I have to have a working knowledge of biology, genetics, sociology, politics, and medicine
god I *wish* my existence wasn't political
just, don't call me a tr*p please
I'm not owed someone's attraction
there's nothing *wrong* with gynephilia
Exactly
and now we're back to "fuck TERFs"
because being trans is so much fun, as evidenced by the above
`YoUrE nOt ReAlLy TrAnS, yOuRe JuSt FaKiNg It`
I'm stepping out of this channel until later tonight. If anything requires my attention, I'm relying on a user to flag me down
Thank you for understanding my side here
Please, please have some empathy with your word choice
Derp, the reason I'm upset is because I'm having to watch this chat like a hawk to make sure you don't slur on us
they're JuSt WoRdS
Like, for instance, this conversation in its entirety has basically ruined my relaxation time before work
if the second is executed, the first is unnecessary
good idea
Haha yeah I should just let people call me a tranny and it's my choice to be upset
can someone please take over, I'll tag you in
Look, I have a closing shift later and I've been wrangling this *all fucking day* since I woke up
Language is an important part of behavior
normalizing harmful behavior, putting someone down
And words can absolutely harm someone
Don't call people of color "Blacks."
I'm gonna say it once more, with feeling.
Language can harm. Diction or content.
but I know calling them "Blacks" is Not Good
I'm also uncomfortable talking for POC here because I'm not one, I'm putting words in other peoples' mouths
is relevant
the punching up/punching down distinction
yeah don't do that either
let's not call other people "Blacks," okay?
yeah that's why I said "maybe not"
or POC
current terminology is people of color
Mhm. Calling them "Blacks" is reducing them to their skin
it's dehumanizing
Perhaps stop calling them "Blacks"
Worried, hm?
*raises eyebrow*
refusing to use their pronouns is, in fact, being an asshole
That's precisely what you're doing when you refuse to use their pronouns
that sounds pretty bigoted
You're being an asshole to enby people for daring to exist as they are
This is precisely what I was talking about yesterday.

I need to have a working knowledge of biology, genetics, and psychology just to defend the existence of my siblings to a bigot.
enby, NB, non binary
okay being trans sucks, and enby sucks harder because there's a decent chunk of people who are assholes due to their identies `case in point`
that makes you a dickhead
<:enbyheart:549053521203429376>
*clears throat*
<:enbyheart:549053521203429376>
I'm glad you paid attention in 7th grade.
Oh, does it now?
I'm leaving this conversation, clearly I'm getting too riled up
<@!99695384296701952> can we ban this shithead so we stop wasting our time
YOU FUCKER
you went ***out of your way*** to "call me out" on saying that there's more than just the binary
it's "don't be a dick"
I don't want it looking like "anyone who disagrees with us is banned"
I just
science doesn't even do that, boyo
<:ChrisAngerDess:496162035856441354>
like
"there are only 2 and science says I'm right"
he clearly wanted to flex his knowledge on dem libs
with how he started the conversation
like, okay
I hated the "oh I'll gender them correctly if they're friends"
w/e
but he pinged me and dredged it up
nobody had to know
he could have gone this entire time thinking that
üëè

Yes, or no?
Are there more than 2 genders?
No.
So, Reaper. Are there more than 2 genders?
You've said *several times* you don't acknowledge that they're not binary.
It's not even a sensitive topic for me. I'm a binary trans girl. I will *not* tolerate my siblings being stepped on and erased like that.
Can we enforce rule 1 yet
I'm not going to be involved in this conversation anymore
that'd be Not Cool
If I publicly shamed them
a vaguepost
Is saying "hey y'all, don't do this thing, I don't want to say who because it's not important but please don't do this"
it's relatively easy
don't be a dick
ya just, Rule #1 folks
if we never have a conversation like that again I'd be happy
kthnx
but don't go spreading harmful stuff on the server
like, we can't control what people think
and that includes being a dick about gender
The general rule is "don't be a dick"
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
don't go after banned users and harass them please
so I'm emphasizing
exactly
that was merely an example
and, for the record, no ban evasion has been attempted in this case
don't chase after them telling them to gargle windex
if they attempt ban evasion, that's our (read: staff's) problem, not y'alls
if someone gets banned, it's over
What?
A user being banned doesn't mean you can go harass them
Hey, just so everyone knows
You didn't miss much
It ruined like, half my day
Interesting timing, that
I think I might have an enby as a regular now <a:badelaugh:428703436566036481>
Bouncing up and down with excitement
Said they liked my pins, and were like
Aaaaah I just had a high school kid come through the store
Alice, I didn't ping you because I didn't want to be responsible for any negativity in your day
the second could be an opinion but it's also being a dick
"oh, you're one of those people"
or
"oh, I think X"
there's also a few different ways to say that
it's important
please please please, remember rule 1
He got pardoned on Memorial Day by Trump, if memory serves
From bones that don't fit in where they were found, in the region her plane was thought to have gone down in
By a sexist doctor, no less
I just gave an example of it messing up
My middle name is Earhart and I'm so, so proud of it
Figured it out a couple months ago
Amelia Earhart's bones were found 60 years ago but they thought it was a man's skeleton
But it's better if it doesn't *immediately follow a controversy*
Fair
This feels like pandering
And, honestly
The Gamers will get mad about the pandering
I don't have faith in CDPR to handle this well at all
That's all it is
It's bullshit marketing
You've been able to do that in every rpg
Like
Oh you can make your character enby
Honestly though, what the fuck does "the game will let you" mean, outside of pronouns
<:Shrug:388950974817107968>
and all I know about this person is "they use dilate as an insult"
I think in a vacuum, murder is unjust
the only person I know who regularly says "dilate" is certainly not a fascist
I dunno
Unless they're a fascist, I'm willing to look the other way if they're a fascist
Which aren't exactly the same but both are relevant
And also unjust
Because murder is illegal
We cannot allow this, but we also cannot stop you
`what`
I hope it's not too much of a hassle
The black plague was a complicated mess
How did they resolve the problem before
`filthy rats`
`fuck corporate pride`
Good and bad
They like us insofar as it generates press
Getting cops involved is definitely not a good idea
I wonder if he's doing it on purpose
Say it again for the people in the back
<@!90229127075893248> is a friend
he's super chill, and one of the first people I came out to
the guy who runs it is actually here, too
the discord server is named after the thread
no like
/sgg/
but it definitely exists
I'm going to refrain from talking about it further
there's a 4chan symphogear discord server
which doesn't surprise me at all
no skin off my back
they're making themselves look like an idiot, not us
they can say it all they want
No, I mean
I'm gonna say "lets not let this catch on" because that's really fucking stupid
I don't like "4chan" and "trans woman" being in the same sentence
what are we talking about now
Didn't we do exactly that like, a week ago
If I'm going to be horny on main it should probably be <#336297808221044736>
No
What
Very very important
I might actually cry r n about it because it was
I cried for several hours because I messed up a ***very important cookie***
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
MELUA THAT'S MEAN
THE COOKIE
OH NO
Not here
I can be horny on a different main
<:FerrisThink:465485767905640468>
Nara you should know this
Just altered
Also it's not necessarily less sex drive
Melua is this a callout post
<:laugheline:454887887847030814>
Hey, hormones are way worse for me right now than they were in high school
2FA = GOOD
Yeah the Twitter thread even calls that out
Whatever gets it more visiblity works for me, tbh
Or didn't grow up in the era of "everything on the internet is a lie until vetted"
Especially if you're not super experienced with whatever it is
Ya I know
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Thanks for the heads up though
Yeah
Bad URL fully visible, fishy message sent
It's a basic thing
I appreciate the warning but I will also say, to save people time, if you're aware of phishing and careful about URLs, don't worry about reading this
They're `just cousins`
Just, for context
Yeah no this is the owner of the house I'll be staying at
Straight to my face
Last night someone was described as "maliciously misgenders trans people and calls them trannies" and "not a bigot" simultaneously
it's just such a foreign concept to me
but that doesn't mean I disrespect them
I don't really understand noun-gender or adjective-gender people
and that's valid
as a general rule, queer isn't a slur if you're not cishet, but some people don't like it in general
basically that yeah you're allowed to do what you want but don't tell other people that they can't be okay with it
oh I saw a really good writeup about that
it's probably a personal thing
all the enbies I know are okay with it
you'd have to ask them
nonbinary > NB > enby
not really
I hate this planet, where can I delete save and start new game
9500 out of the 20000
Half of the United States border patrol in in a Facebook group talking about how much they hate Mexicans
Purposefully seperating children from their families, might I add
There's a lot of other stuff there too
Okay fucking forget I said anything about Russia
His presidency is a constant threat to my existence and I'm honestly a little scared every time I see him in the news
Banned transgender people from the military, introduced bigots into the Supreme Court, started holding people in concentration camps on the southern border, started a trade war with China that's hurting far more than it's helping, eroding faith in the United States across the world, *probably* working with/for Russia (no judicial action has been taken thus far)
no idea about tanks, planes or military presence
bare minimum research shows there was a 4th of july parade in 2015, while Obama was still president
But if it's normal then it's systemic and not just "trump bad"
If $2 million from the National Parks Service was being spent on a parade every year that's Not Good
Eeeeehhhhhh
There's lots of other reasons to be upset
If that's a normal thing then it doesn't make sense to be upset at him specifically about this one thing
I'm actually witholding judgment on this until I find out how expensive the parades normally are, and where the funds come from
Alright, I need to go to work

Maybe the Mexicans aren't the fucking problem, eh?
When your work involves child abuse
When your work involves beating prisoners, and worse
When your work violates international human rights laws
I think maybe hating an entire country's people is pretty fucking awful regardless of why
The thing you were specifically hired to do?
Are you saying it's okay to be racist because they make you do your job?
I'm missing context
who is that
I'm mad at disney for basically purchasing laws
Very much in line with "let people be themselves"
That's my opinion, anyway
I think if the emotional connection is important enough to you to consider it part of your sexuality, then you can absolutely use it as an identifier
The whole "snowflake" thing gets thrown around a lot
Whether or not it's "extraneous" or "attention seeking"
it's okay to be gay just don't, yknow, *be* gay
yeah that's still fucked up
for you to be angry, that is
I'd say that's perfectly acceptable
a pet, a friend, a concept
to keep you going
find something
just
and want to give up
exhausted
and you get
and over again
and over
and you do it over
and then you miss, and fall further down than you were before
sometimes you have to reach out and try to grab it yourself
AMEN
honestly that's where I was
definitely not
but yeah the job thing is killer
free wifi
starbucks tho
it's not fun, but it's doable
overall, like 6 or 7
in the past year
I've done exactly that about 4 times
<:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
Utah is by far my least favorite state, I got stared at by creepy shitheads in a truck stop
I disagree, intention matters a lot here imo
it's the difference between "go ruin that person's day" and "I don't care if you do or don't"
I suppose
not everyone wants to know about your dick
it's unprompted and unnecessary in the current discussion
it's excessive
unless people really want to know
let's not go into detail about the effect of HRT on the genitals
`I know, I'm joking`
<:BasaSmug:497598144083787796>
no, I love and agree with everything on that whiteboard
same, nanoha
befriend... if female
July is Wrath Month because it comes right after Pride
I broke down crying at work yesterday because three dudebros decided to laugh at me over not hearing the name properly
Hey Yorin, please don't tell people who are struggling to deal with something that they're just immature
did you once swear off all media except manga
Even "black people" is better
Can we stop referring to POC as "blacks"
I have zero interest in freaky orgies, no thank you
Education is necessary but not sufficient
Well, yeah if people think we're just predators, or sexual deviants, or doing this for fun, nothing is going to change
always go for education tbh
"voting advice" is almost never good
What are you expecting from leaving the country, and why is staying a 100% punishment
What are you expecting from leaving the country
Maybe sooner
We're going to burn up in 60 years anyway
What do you mean
That's it, really
Marry someone outside the country with money
Without money?
Reducing them to only their skin color. Similar to "gay people" versus "the gays"
Because that's reductionist
But like, most things are better than "blacks"
People of color, it's the currently accepted thing
That's not exactly what I meant but okay
You'd need county sheriff or city police
CHP won't help for this
But yeah that one guy is focusing on the wrong things it seems
I think most advertisement is, in itself, disingenuous
What has this country come to
I just saw an ad for the democratic national debates like it was a goddamn wrestling match
I've heard one source say he was talking about how he got "ripped off" but no idea how reliable it is
Because school history was useless
I'm slowly learning *actual fucking history* as an adult
Ugh that must have been one of those bits they didn't bother teaching me
Nazis did practice eugenics, yes
Listen -- strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
This was last year
They didn't know I'm trans but I don't want to know what would have happened if they did
The family's dad had a really, really creepy vibe to him
I was sitting there, a closeted trans woman, being talked to about how Jesus is coming soon
The first place I ever felt scared for my life was in a house where the major decorations were all crosses
Amen
With individual beliefs and morals and prejudices
Individual people
As an institution, I hate organized religion, but the people are just
I've had some Christians call me an abomination and other Christians have really fun conversations about my hormones with me
I actually want to do that at some point a
And sorry for not wanting to be objectified, I guess?
But I do want to wear hot pants at some point, just not work
That's kind of a creepy joke
Skirt 4 inches above the knee. That's long enough for starbucks!
I show so much leg at work
I dress the part and everything
I'm definitely a witch though
But I'm also outside the discourse so who knows anymore
I've used it to refer to people who *fetishize* the "girl with penis" thing
That's not my understanding of the term
Wrong channel?
Oh jeez
I don't like advocating torture <:sadeline:407082544077733889>
Did a big animation studio not have offsite backups?
Girls are too good for that
I ain't gonna stop being lesbian

<:utazukine:524467727017181195>
"but the belief created by that Utazukin show gives you power now"
I've accepted that it's completely made up recently and that doesn't make it any less cool
You know what else is a serious thing? Sending death threats to women who may have been raped.
I feel like if you bring something up and then later say "I don't want to have these discussions" that's Not Good

Yeah he mentioned it first
*blinks*
Do I need to go through a rigorous and systematic process of examining all the evidence when I'm trying to decide to accept someone's game invite
I wouldn't call a simple google search "rigorous" but it's enough for me
Even if I've heard "oh yeah Actor is pretty cool"
<@189158439316881408> and that's actually exactly why I google "[actor name] transgender" on big names in a show. I want to see if they've said anything shitty about me or my siblings because that's an area of asswipery that I really care about
<@189158439316881408> and so when I'm looking at a show on Netflix, do I need to do a deep and thorough investigation on each individual actor when I'm deciding whether or not to watch it and therefore financially support the show
I'm just saying, nobody wins, and I don't want to see one over an *oil tanker*
I'm not arguing for, or against that.
Nobody won. Some people lost less.
Not to mention all the minefields that still exist
And raw materials that could have gone for infrastructure now sitting at the bottom of Pearl Harbor and plenty of other ocean vistas
Or the countless lives lost and real estate rendered unusable
Nobody wins in war except the people who have contracts with the militaries
Nobody does
Every government sponsors terrorism, but that being said, I don't like seeing sparks when I'm at a gas station

I think the dispute is over where the tanker was, and that snippet is BBC.com

`eat the rich`
Just because it's legal doesn't mean it's good, and just because it's illegal doesn't mean it's bad
I've dated a girl who told me she didn't smoke and then on date 4 she lit up a cigarette
Cigarette smoke gives me headaches and whenever this one customer comes through drive thru with her convertible open and cig lit I have to get someone else to take care of her
Alcohol is one of the worst things that's socially acceptable
#civildisobedience
Go for it
Maybe they didn't have Perfect Ideas
Also it was a bunch of old white men in the 18th century
I don't know how it works, but I know it was a "fuck the votes, this is what's happening and you'll like it"
It's bullshit is what it is
It's true if the parents have money
Unless you're getting 100% absorption through the lungs, you're exposing people to it
It's the exhale part
Do you know what second hand smoke is
Weed second hand smoke is still second hand smoke I have no idea what you're talking about
So you might have an easier job with less, more desperate people
I don't expect two generations from now to exist in a society, climate change is gonna take most of us down beforehand
The only way that *might* happen is if there's some external threat, and even then I doubt it
And then it turns out that it's Naruto but that's a conversation starter
Even "hey, that patch is neat, is it One Piece?"
If they're wearing anything fandom, those are easy things
Feel free
"nice bike, how long have you had it?"
"your hair is gorgeous! How long does it take you to do that?"
"oh I love that necklace, where'd you get it?"
And give them a genuine compliment, followed by a question
Find the thing that it looks like they care about
Everyone, every single person, has something worth complimenting
There's actually a trick to it
Put that on your resume
"Hey this kid is pretty cool, I'm his trans internet friend and we've never met but he likes good music and makes funny jokes sometimes"
I will personally vouch for you
Well, no, if you intend on crossdressing while skating then the political leanings of the area can be important
I personally won't step foot near that godforsaken city
I also think the distinction of "oldest member" isn't something we should be keeping track of but hey, if that's what y'all wanna do
And "I'm scared" is very, very valid
It's important to emphasize that you can identify as a trans woman without needing to actually transition, if there are factors preventing you from doing so
Transition isn't mandatory either
Naaaaahhh that's fine, I've seen women transition later than that
How old are you, if you don't mind me asking
It's hard to be "too late to transition"
`hey that's me`
<:TransOwo:587092678504611862>
My understanding is that it's one of the biggest tragedies *Japan* has seen recently
Honestly, the internet didn't make me trans but I never would have realized it without my internet friends
dess_ping
But she's having trouble tonight
Kiri should have done a thing
headpat
It's been lovely
I've received lots of headpats this week
Unwelcome contact is Not Good
I'm a big hugger IRL but I always get consent first
*headpats*
She knows the secret
I get hugs from some of my coworkers and friends but Melua gives the best hugs I've ever had
üíú
My hugs are currently at work but she will be arriving in 30ish minutes
We all do
Mormon
She's a Good Mod
We've done a lot to make this an accepting space, and Melua continues to do so
I'm glad you trust us enough
I'm so sorry
Uff, Brazil
And it's mostly because of the USA to begin with
I've heard very Not Good things about the political climate
But it's not South America so I've got that going for me
I live in Georgia, which is very much American South
I went balls to the wall speedrun mode
Mine was "I stopped repressing my dysphoria two weeks ago, but I've already come out to everyone except my parents and here's my hormone pills"
I've bought a lot of clothes at goodwill, maybe not kimonos but still
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Sakimori feels too formal <:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>
You can call me Saki, or Kriisa
But I'm better off now than I ever was before
I lost my family, my job and my housing
I started my transition one year and twelve days ago
Punching fascists is a-okay but going after random people isn't really very good
Since you were like 13 and that person couldn't have voted
Hmmm that's a little excessive
And it leads to a lot of pain, and suffering, and death
Humans are afraid of "other"
You don't have to be "out and proud" to be valid
Staying in the closet doesn't mean you're not LGBT
And yeah politics is kinda shitty
Hah! Chris at a buffet would be in heaven
Just hanging out and chatting
Not even a date, just
She's been through a lot, I've been through a lot, we both deserve a break
Anyway, I don't really "self-insert" with Chris. We just have a lot of shared struggles and I just want to take her to a cafe and have coffee and pastries
Yeah just reading it makes me uncomf
It's also no coincidence that my irl name is Kriisa <:gaylaughter:585748329061810206>
<@141531216200466432> I can see a lot of myself in Kiri, and mostly with Chris, so it's no surprise that they're my top 2 characters by far
All the main characters in gear are wonderful
Miku is wonderful
"becoming" trans isn't... the right language
Exactly
And then I figured out that it's because I just, wasn't a dude, and everything made sense
I always thought it was weird how I was so unable to self-insert with all these really bland self-insert characters
And people were always cheering them on because they could self-insert
I always got upset when any female characters I liked (not crushes, just good characters) ended up getting with guys
Kiri needs to get well soon
This is the intended headpat from earlier, by the way
There it is
YES
Pls let people know what's inside when you tag stuff
The above are XV ep3 spoilers
Ish
Also symphogear is in 2045
No XV spoilerinos
And all that
Sins of the father are not sins of the son
That's not good enough though
I guess?
Val Verde wasn't run by nazis but they probably had children of nazis in their ranks
HEY YEAH
But I'll punch a nazi
Yeah, which is why I won't kill anyone
I'm thinking you need to see that love doesn't work when the person is a white supremacist
If anyone wants to look down on me because I'll punch a nazi, feel free
I'm punching because they're a ***fucking nazi***
I'm not punching for the sake of punching
I will punch a nazi.
And if you think they'll be okay with your kimono, you're going to be very surprised
Those people are fascists too
If a nazi getting punched makes people thing that they're not the bad guys
You think they don't already hate everything I stand for?
Fucking *worth it*
If I die because I punched a nazi
Hell, I might die
My boss will be okay with this
Or hurt
I will probably be arrested
I will punch a nazi
No, I mean if they're advocating for the death of me or my trans siblings
I will punch someone who wants me dead
Um
Amen

The first two chapters are out
Both of whom are featured in a writing project I'm working on with Illindus
One of whom is support staff
I really like RP-ing Elfnein, and I have a couple OCs
I'm normally est but I'm pst right now
Lead them further down the rabbit hole
And just
They use places like InfoWars and people like Ben Shapiro to find conservatives who like that aggressive, angry pitch
They're scarily effective
That being said, nazis use some pretty insidious recruitment tactics
What did I just say about sins of the father <:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>
anyway
I don't keep up with science news enough to dispute points one and two.
Point 3 is a self-admitted "idealistic dream" and the current state of education is absolutely abysmal.
Cars that drive themselves aren't relevant in a discussion about "is the world doomed"
He isn't fixing LAs infrastructure, he's reinventing subways but worse
Elon Musk isn't a savior, he's a man with way too much money and nobody to tell him no.
I'd like to counter points three and four. I'll start with four.
Errrr <#357682999300718592>
Let's move out of this channel
<a:ChristmasShirabeBear:526822211332341760>
Yeah, no point in being wishy washy, I'll officially sign up for this as Elf9
You could probably be both
Okay wait until you read how I portray Elfnein before you ask for that
I could probably be convinced to make an Elfnein or Lt Cmdr Rhodes twitter/tumblr account if I had people to RP with though
Don't have much other social media presence outside of discord
I uh
I just do this thing with Illi right now, actually
I'm the text engine, and Illi is the "player"
I've heard that my Elfnein is very non-standard but still fun to read
there is *so much sky* and we can't watch all of it
that's definitely not true
I went back and yeah, I fucked up
you have to subject yourself to the same rigor
that's the thing about being skeptical
gomenasorry
I made assumptions and failed reading comprehension
<:Shrug:388950974817107968>
And that website does have a right-wing bias
Which is what conservatives want to hear, liberals being stupid
I wasn't able to find any information on that website about why the protests were happening outside of "he was black and you can't do that"
which invalidates everything I said
I'm awful at reading, apparently
...wow.
I don't particularly care to read much further, but my understanding is that the university itself, as an organization, got involved in an illegal manner and did, in fact, win a stupid prize
This was "a student was assaulted and beaten up prior to the arrival of police, and police did nothing about the battery"
So, in summary, this was not "some students from Oberlin got caught shoplifting from a nearby bakery"
If you shoplift, do you also get assaulted?
`Trey James, a worker at Gibson‚Äôs, said the 19-year-old was actually 17 and had attempted to shoplift alcohol. He denied the choking allegation, saying he was an eye-witness to the Tappan Square portion of the incident.

‚ÄúWhen you shoplift you get arrested. It doesn‚Äôt matter what your sexual orientation is or your religion or your ethnicity. If you shoplift, you get busted,‚Äù he said.`
This website is also hosting a video about the event titled "dipshit libtards" so they may not be the most unbiased of sources
something tells me this isn't entirely about the shoplifting
The subject was getting beaten up while lying on the ground
```On Wednesday, November 9, 2016, at approximately 4:58pm, officers responded to the area of Gibson‚Äôs Bakery in reference to a report of a fight in progress. As officers were responding to the area, dispatch advised that this was involving an alleged theft complaint. Dispatch advised that Allyn Gibson, who is an employee of Gibson‚Äôs Bakery, was attempting to apprehend a subject who Allyn had witnessed attempt to steal several items. As officers approached the area, Sgt. Ortiz, and Officer Feuerstein both stated they observed Allyn Gibson lying on his back with several individuals kneeling over him punching and kicking him with several other individuals in the immediate area. Officers attempted to gain control of the situation and were met several times with resistance from several different individuals. After a few minutes officers were finally able to take one female into custody and calm the incident and attempt to figure out what had taken place.```
not to scale, of course
the projected path would be more like this
He's in the opposition parliament
In a real life context
So why are you talking about "Blooming Yuri" relationships
My understanding is that yuri is not the appropriate way to describe a real life lesbian couple as well
I was hoping that wasn't what you meant but I guess I was wrong
I'm not sure how to interpret that sentence
So he's not just ignoring the T, which is good
`As Toshima Ward Assembly Member, Ishikawa has worked with local LGBTI groups across Japan to recognize same sex unions.
It is also important to ‚Äòcheck the administration with LGBT‚Äôs eyes‚Äô, said Ishikawa.

He, therefore, cited introducing gender-neutral changing rooms in public gymnasiums as an example.`
<@!246146781832806401> how important is parliament in Japan?

who does this hurt

they twist words the way they want to make people okay with ostracizing us

I'm in favor of humanity ceasing to exist, we're a scourge
I personally welcome the destruction of this stupid rock
<@379633671897874433> is there anything to be gained from freaking out
More money for weapons, less money for everything else
I'm sorryyy <:sadeline:407082544077733889>
Oh I got completely lost in the discussion
We don't know if any of these people are interested in that solution
That phrasing makes it sound like monogamous people just need education and maturity and then they can be poly too
Some people won't ever be ready for polyamory
Yes
<a:ChrisBaka:493803773001465866>
<:laugheline:454887887847030814>
I love you, Melua
üíú
Is joke
I know
Neither of us is straight, or a man
It sucks, and I suck, and I'm trying to be better
Don't idolize it, or me
Losing control has never, ever been something I looked back on and thought "gee that was fun"
It sucks, I wish I could control myself better
Why would you want that
<:MikuGay:535217808225861642>
Next to Melua where I belong
It's one of the reasons I'm not at the top of the server list anymore
I don't think about what I'm typing enough
Don't trust me, I get emotional and kneejerk-y
That's exactly it
Oh my god he pulled out of the agreement so that he could make a new one
There are more than three of us here
dess_define quandary
that's a good name
I like Sakirika
so it's not *that* surprising
and we're fairly visible people on this server

my usual reaction to someone making me angry is to walk away and cry
if it helps
I cry myself to sleep some nights because what the fuck, my mom literally doesn't love me
but it still hurt
it wasn't difficult
blocking my mother was really, really hard-hitting
can confirm
I've realized this is pointless and a waste of time
????????
the shooter?
`If the shooter's on the other side of the room, martial arts probably won't help you much unless you can find a way to close the distance`
*that was literally the conversation*
when we're talking about *the NRA and mass shootings*
where the hell do you get off, inserting this "oh it's an unarmed attack"
*when was this stated*
Also not everyone is obsessed with honor either
By... using it on someone pointing a loaded gun at you?
if someone is claiming firearms in self defense, they won't be bothered by legality of chokeholds
nobody wins in a knife fight, nobody wins in a shootout
about "federal encompasses all"
that's not strictly true
acab
He straight up tweeted outright, explicit transphobia. I'm *pretty sure* he's a transphobe
Probably?
Stay mad, asshat <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
I've seen so much praise for that little clip of Rockos
Second
FUCK YEAH PUNCH A NAZI
First of all
Two things
I mean, I brought up "hey is this question worth asking" and you're the one who engaged me in that
So why do people ask "is this pandering?" if a character turns out to be trans?
No!
Do people ask "is this pandering?" if a kid's first romance happens to be straight?
But I'll say it again because Rakhi missed it too
Alright, I already screenshotted the part where I said what the point was
What?
*blinks*
I tried. I fucking tried.
I'm done, I'm sorry, it's too early for this
WHERE THE FUCK DID I SAY YOU WERE ATTACKING THEM
I did, and you kept talking through me
No, if you ask that you've clearly not been paying attention

You were asking and answering "is it pandering"
No, Poi
So why does it need to be asked if a trans woman drives an ice cream truck?
I don't have to ask if it's pandering to white people every time there's a white guy in charge of a company
I don't have to ask if it's pandering to straight people every time a man and a woman hold hands
It's fucking pathetic
A single piece of media going out of their way to show trans people in a positive light and this discussion has to happen
Can you please just put it in perspective
I'm tired of being the butt of jokes
Please pander to me
Please
I am in fear for my life every time I leave the house, I'm worried that one day I'll wake up and have my rights erased, I feel awful about my body and constantly feel like I'm legitimately broken
Is "pandering" to ***trans people*** a sin worthy of basing your "should I like this or not" decision on?
The question I'm asking
Just don't laugh at me
Give me something, anything, I'm begging the media please
Y'all are here discussing "is this pandering, oh probably not" but I get fucked with on a daily basis by society
Is pandering to an incredibly oppressed, highly at risk group *really that bad?*

I don't trust the government, I don't trust cops, I don't trust anyone in power to actually care about anyone other than themselves
when a POC does it it's terrorism, when a white person does it they "need mental help"
I will apologize for exactly one thing: I shouldn't have used all caps, sorry about that
And then you somehow got "you're attacking me" out of it and now you're pulling the victim card and also again putting words in my mouth somehow?
fuck capitalism, it's broke
mental healthcare is out of price range of a loooooot of people
accessibility too
deal?
I'll start trusting "in charge" people when they stop being short-sighted, self-centered, and are actively trying to remove my rights
I'm not going to forgive you for immediately assuming the worst of someone who hasn't demonstrated bad faith
ooooh I remember that
I will dm them, I don't want to ping them in public about it
at least one other person
I don't see where it references cryptocurrency
DRM
er
they're using related techniques to
I don't see anything about cryptocurrency
It's fucking insane, wow
Would you fight a war over trying to deny rights to people
Do "people" have rights
Okay, see, you see there how it says "people"
`deepening internal war over the rights of transgender people`
I've not heard of this! I've only ever seen the term used to slur against trans people
Oh, I could be wrong here
In this case it was explicitly requested
In most contexts it's a slur
Oh yeah, Thailand
Did you sleep with a trans woman
So wait, WFC
It really is pure bliss
I love putting my head on Melua's chest and just snuggling
Awesome!
But yeah I don't think powerful female protagonists were ever mainstream
Fair.
Mhm.
How old are you?
PLEASE understand that we HELP amazon do all sorts of things. ME, well I'M in qa UNDERneath management's office and make sure the boxes don't show too much DURESS
but yeah genitalia preference is a thing that must be respected
I'd actually argue that if you refuse to date a trans person based solely on their trans-ness, you might have some transphobia buried somewhere
look, I'll bring my switch and some ghibli films, we can have a movie night
<:Shrug:388950974817107968>
I don't understand the point of "This person said something that offended me. I'm not going to say what, though!"
Why bring it up?
You... prefer not to say?
<@506219877724454929> what comment are you offended by
I'm still in debt to the IRS.
I had to pay 10% of $9000
melua is good at fixing things
melua is good at fixing things
lots of L and G who are uninformed on trans issues don't
most trans people I know, yes
they're not hostile but this is already not necessary
and if they've already banned it
a modmail on a subreddit that is presumably "hostile" won't get anything done
second, what is this supposed to achieve besides a laugh and a delete
I mean, first establish whether or not it's actually banned now
please don't use the r-slur!
But it's *seven major countries* giving a total of 25% of a shitty movie's budget
Not only that
What's the bet its just minorities
I wonder how random the people are.
explain
you doubt we'll die from global warming, but we'll likely die from climate change
wait hold on a second
It's honestly scary
In the US I took a common sense test, practiced driving with my mother for half an hour and took the practical exam
I don't know who any of these people are
Hooray for Twitter endorsing and serving bigotry on their platform!
They hit the "girl" setting but the "girl" setting saw something that shouldn't be there in my pants
Yeah it flagged me
Last time I went through the body scanner
So uh
Which invalidates the *entire thing*
You can pay money to skip security
My point still stands
Yeah
TSA Precheck
It's an online service
Officially
Like
You can pay money to skip security
<:DMJii:549819519082692608>
Hah! Yeah, my female rpg characters always felt the same way
But it's a place to look!
If the labels don't feel right you don't gotta use em
Homoromantic demisexual from this lil conversation
Might want to look into demisexual?
Hm hm hm
Hm.
And do you catch these feelings with other bois or just him?
Is it an emotional but not hormonal satisfaction? Or both?
What's up?
We've even got precedent!
This is probably the best place, yeah
Awful yet validating
But it was still awful
And they had the lady agent pat me down
Which is like, hooray, I pass
People agreed because of terror
The pledge was created during the cold war specifically for propaganda
what a badass, right
I didn't stand up for the national anthem at a baseball game I went to last year
And America gave me nothing but hell in return
I pledged allegiance to the federal flag until 5th grade
From budget to troop movements
Pretty much everything the US military does is dishonest
It's the US sowing unrest in foreign countries, as they have been for decades now
I have to wear a hat for work so I have this cute knit beanie w/ a flower on it
And everyone who makes rules hates the lower class, yeah
it's easier to manage if it's *that guy right over there*
it's hard to be afraid of something unknown
fear of the unknown
Not even that, it's more the
So he said he wasn't, but also that he is

fuck gamers, fuck cops
idk


I didn't make any mistakes to fix
So not having swearing on nick jr is a bad thing then
You keep repeating this "parents should parent" thing like that absolves him of all responsibility
so how do you propose to make parents infallible
You argued "they can get around the content block"
surely you concede that he's doing something wrong
And since he doesn't
You admit that he should
if so then sure, he's not at fault
Is it explicitly marked as unsuitable for minors?
Are there warnings on his videos for kids to not watch them?
sky's blue too
also yeah youtube is shitty
Does pewds have his content marked as unsuitable?
Is awful
But assuming you know someone better than they do, to the extent that you're telling them that they're trans
The "egg" stuff is fun to talk about when you're referring to yourself
There's a huge difference
I remember in the leadup to Melua coming out I spent a not insignificant amount of effort helping her figure out *who she is*, not *that she's trans*
permanent state of being
that's just my
I mean
No!
let me go
just
end me
I checked their profile and they were in a "fucking liberal snowflakes" group or something
some random sent me a friend request on steam last week
it's ***fucking pervasive***
on things completely unrelated to trans issues
I get smacked with random transphobia out of fucking nowhere
and every time I walk outside of it
I have my little bubble
the internet isn't really great for trans people
it'd be hard to find a fetishy but not-transphobic subreddit that isn't small
I would rather not do that particular research for you though
i'm sure there's a lot of fetishy subreddits
I don't think you're looking for "trans-friendly"
that one is slow as hell
there's someone on traansfw who likes writing erotica, iirc
<:MikuPraise:611252459637309450>
yeah I'm not dead because my friends would be really sad
Use the label that best communicates how you feel about your sexuality
It's why the Kinsey scale exists
Because the vast, vast majority of people can find at least one person of a non-attractive gender who is still attractive to them
I think the point of "if you're attracted to both, no matter how much, you're bi" is flawed
so I just ignored the request
the uh
how did you draw that absolute conclusion
they're only apologizing because it's a guest

just the privacy part
oh I didn't see the freedom of information part
good job lawmakers
that's wonderful
lets newspapers publish a person's suicide
protection of privacy act
That happened to me a few years back, actually
I don't like one of them because staff allows open transphobia and other assorted bigotry, as well as harassment of users
but we can get you through this
it sucks
<:DMJii:549819519082692608>
doing stuff that was fun and finding fun people who also did that thing
if it helps, I was able to find another group of friends just by
I hope that your one friend comes around
I only found out months later when someone realized it was fucked up
rumors that I was transphobic spread and nobody really liked me enough in the first place to doubt it
It tanked my mood for a while
Honestly, not knowing about the Lily stuff is probably better
random transphobia really sucks to just, bump into
like it's already dicey because of Astolfo, actually
Fate is so much bigger, I'd be scared to go anywhere adjacent if there was an indisputably trans character
look at what happened with her
look at Hoshikawa Lily
as a group there's not a great track record with trans issues
weebs
honestly, I'd rather not have representation in media so popular with
man, fuck the internet
that sentence is literally "this law shouldn't exist"
so, no stand your ground law
`Pulling the trigger should be an absolute last resort, imo. If you can avoid it, do so.`
why'd we get all the way to 15
how bad were the Assault Rifles 1 through 14
what?
<:ChrisPeek:611251991087415296>
you mean lederhosen
Or *literal Nazism*
Companies enforcing copyright on their IPs
What's worse
Look
please
fuck off
copyright laws
to fucking
you're equating genocide, white nationalism and fascism
please
shut the fuck up
dude
jesus
is worse than that
genocide
yeah okay
than whatever that is
are *much* worse
nazis
um
Ah ok
Is it slang or something
Why do you keep saying "cucked"
I can't really speak for the server anymore but I hope the folks in Hong Kong get their revolution
Fuck Blizzard, I'm glad I don't need their launcher for D2 anymore
It's right there in the rules. Make us look bad, you didn't win shit.

No!
It's stupid and it worked and people being stupid make me angry
They want to look like a traditional sports team, and that's exactly it: look like one
So transparent
It's marketing, and I know that, but it's
Like what's the point of being named the Atlanta Asshats if you've never set foot in Georgia and have no intention of ever doing so
If everyone lives and plays in LA
Team names with cities
I'm still angry over all these
Yeah no company is going to predict a shrinkage in their main marketing strategy and be calm about it
This shit runs deep
I remember wanting to mod in a HK flag for an xcom soldier but not being able to find one on the workshop
And that's all I can really do
The company ain't getting any of my dollars or attention
But as far as I'm concerned
Probably, yeah
(shooters and puzzles, if you're curious)
It's not anything close to my main genres
I'll try it, if I like it yay, if not oh well
I didn't much like it either
Thanks for the vouch, Lily
I'm not particularly wanting a dungeon looter but when I get the itch I'll check it out
That's a glowing recommendation in my book
I've not heard anything good about it, is all
I keep forgetting PoE is a thing tbh
Good joke, Kerrik
I haven't touched it in months
I'm gonna miss diablo, maybe
They love to complain about censorship
I wonder where all the Gamers will be about their free speech and censorship
Might be why I'm not familiar
Oh.
Oh, oof
I don't know of any other meanings of cuck other than the fetish
That's also a male chicken
You might be thinking of cock
The hard F lets you build up a lot of force
Fucked is more satisfying to say anyway
But if that's not the intent then by all means
I know it's a fetish and we don't do kinkshaming here
And then trading and sales and all that
I thought the draft was nationwide for most sports
Is that true, oclisto?
You are not stupid
<:Praise:391038800232448000>
make Mei a HK protest icon
god bless

and they made an example out of him
and he took it
and he had an opportunity to show that support very publicly
deeply important
it's an issue important to him
if I ever win something like that you bet your ass I'm gonna yell trans rights at the end of the interview
It was like eight words at the end of an interview
bread and circus working like a charm I see
to me
means something
that
employees staged a walkout


Which is neat
It's national coming out day in the US

ironically, he's on the SDU so he'd be deployed to assault and kill protesters
And for the record, that character's place of birth is here:
that sounds like hell

Question for youuuu
<@182890099183190018> <@193408538909868033>
ah ok
I don't know this person
<:laugheline:454887887847030814>
common knowledge
I forget all the acronyms aren't like
oh, sorry
saying GNC != trans is pretty Not Good
but
I don't think astolfo should be on that wiki
if someone wants to say they're trans that is not my place to tell them they aren't
but
and, personally, I think including GNC people under the trans umbrella waters down the term a bit
it's just a label
*however*
which includes GNC people
the original intent of the word "transgender" is supposed to include everyone who goes against the traditional notions of gender
fuck off
so am I
you can't say that outright
but he isn't a trans woman
and some people say that's trans
he's a GNC boy
I mean
Lectric can this wait a sec
Gross
<:MariaKappa:396363198347083786>
<:pogclamp:400027946808770562>
It's ass for everyone else
America's prison system is perfect for the people running it
I think you need a therapist
what the fuck did I miss
his name was "coolgamerdude"
Eh, did Philosophy Tube say they support Contrapoints recently
in the meme's defense they didn't actually use the slur but come on
<@!388516680742993933> I really didn't expect to see you posting a goddamn "tr*ps are gay" meme but here we are
Where is the camera looking? Is there any reason for these two to be fuckin or are we just boom, bedroom? Is there passion or just lust?
It's about stuff like
It's not about who's getting pleasure or w/e
I'm a woman thank you very much, next question
Oh, it depends on who you talk to
I'm very confused
`Hmm hmm
Problem is trans people themselves (the ones I have talked to at least) don't fully understand how it is?`
The labrys is a little too aggressive for me
Yeah I prefer the stripes
Wfc
Have you never seen one of my selfies wfx
Here's me at the airport

Trans on the right
Lesbian on the left
Thank youuuu
I'd much like the rightmost one to be "normal" first

I'm honestly more worried about the other
Thanks?
It's lovely
I'm looking at my lesbian pride flag hanging on my wall right now
Are you going anywhere with that? <:laugheline:454887887847030814>
I'm a lesbian, yes
No ty
Man
Because uh
I don't like the het stuff in that category
But it could be handled more gracefully
I love that it exists
And
It implies that we are more needy, that we're fragile
Sometimes I just wanna see fuckin
30% of the time?
I only like it
Because like
Porn for Women as a name is awfully stereotypical
Also uh
But he stared at me
He didn't draw it
Put a hand on his waist, and I could see a pistol
Stared me down
He walked up to the entrance first and held it open for me but when I got close he blocked the door
I legit thought I was going to die
Have I mentioned the time a dude nearly pulled a gun on me at a gas station
Every day is a struggle
I just wanna exist but it's like
Melua gained a lot of power because I respect her a lot~
So
Because everyone already hates us
And we're an easy target
Because punching down makes people feel better about themselves
Very appreciated
But yeah please stop abusing me, society
üíú
I'm just making it clear to others
I know
I want to make that explicitly clear
Being nonbinary is not being confused
It should be noted that
Yeah some folks do a lot of questioning
<:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>

https://lgbtbar.org/programs/advocacy/gay-trans-panic-defense/
Isn't it wonderful
Some states let you use "but they were trans" as a legitimate legal defense
I love sour patch kids
Because I have a crazy sweet tooth
I just wanted some sour patch kids but no, nearly got shot
Yay Georgia
For a long time
Someone they thought was cis, but was trans
Literally your same sentence but without the a's
It's an important distinction when the difference is used to dehumanize you
Yeah and I clarified that as well
For the same reasons
It's also not "a cis" for the record
But effectively yes
Trans is an adjective not a noun
It's not "a trans"
which might cause issues
I mean, you think anyone that disagrees with you is personally attacking you
one of my best friends came from a civil discussion that we are still on opposite sides over
er
that's an unhealthy framework
I don't really think the only options are "i'm the only one that matters" and "I don't matter at all"
It blows up
This is what happens when people get slowly pushed to the edge
The *point* is to cause problems
They will be ignored
If your protests are easy to ignore
```
‚ÄúI understand that civil unrest exists, and that people rebel against certain conditions, but the path that they have chosen is the destruction of one the greatest tools for social unity that we have [in this city],‚Äù said Chile‚Äôs transport minister, Gloria Hutt. ‚ÄúIt is incomprehensible that they would destroy a public service that benefits so many people.‚Äù
```
`riot cops, maybe`
Just look at who came dressed for a riot
Honestly
That's a reason to start rioting
They got tear gassed
I mean
also
that's Chile not China
It won't be great
So uh
And Pence is an advocate for conversion therapy
If Trump gets impeached we get Pence, is probably what he's worried about
Not one less
Five demands
I'll be your friendo
I'm not changing the subject
It's related, trust me
Hey do you say trans rights
That sounds toxic
By the way
Angela Merkel voted to block this
Why are they allowed to vote for policy when they're *leaving*
Am confused
I
Voted against thus
The group about to leave
The UK's Brexit party
Hm
You're not going to be able to take a vacation to Japan and also claim asylum
Good luck with that, I guess
In theory
Everyone does what they can, and everyone takes what they need
From each, according to ability
To each, according to need
It sucks
America's "liberals" are still conservative
And, she does, to an extent
I thought Merkel aligned with our lef-wing
This entire time
See, that's how ridiculous the political situation in the US is
Literally a closet
This is 9 square meters

Weird.
A lot of Asia lists rent as weekly
Aria, are you sure those were monthly prices
What kind of issues are wholesale keeping you from working retail or something
I think using your mental health issues as a "oh welp I can't ever have a job, oh well!" is fundamentally flawed
You've heard of fanfiction! Get ready for armamentfiction
And students
I know that a lot of states are making it harder and harder for poor people/poc to vote
Because people are stupid and propaganda *works*
I mean, propaganda is part of it
The government doesn't care about the citizens, they care about the corporations
You have a misunderstanding about how government works nowadays
Licenses
They tend to be *slightly* cheaper than licensez
Which are basically driver's licenses, except they don't give you permission to drive
IDs
Have state ID(
Most states I've been to
Okay but
Oh that's not why acab
ACAB
Hold on to that feeling about the cops though
I mean, I'd rather pay an extra $150 in taxes each year if it means I don't have to pay $80 each month for health insurance
They have a reputation for exploiting workers
That's Amazon
Also I scrolled up and saw "microtrans" and giggled a bit sorry
Kanye West likes fingers in his ass
You get the jacket *instead of* the job
Nah
Literally, just the one city for all of humanity and its not really that big
We have the energy for a Destiny City
Alas
I don't have much space here
I've not really had the chance in Georgia because `trans woman alone on a side street` is just asking for trouble down there
Oh yeah walking usually helps a bit for me
I'm just starting on a scarf
I learned how to knit
Last time I was in a huge funk
If anyone can help Aya please come help me out too
I love YSAC
Oh my god
I've been wanting to learn Go
And you can get ***arrested***
Demonstrations are *expensive*
Activism in general would be nonexistent
If everyone used that argument then protests would never happen
It's not throwing it away, Nara, it's being part of a movement (or whatever, it's video games)
Scummy but smart
To remove the option, temporarily
It was really smart t bh
Yeah and people aren't likely to still want to later
The "delete your account" thing was pretty big
What does one person matter, anyway
Or "I still go to chik fil a"
That's literally the argument used for "voting doesn't matter"
It drives down player numbers and install base
If blizzard announces what they want, they won't care anymore
People have been getting upset at blizzard lately and this was just a politically acceptable excuse to be really loud about it
I have zero faith in Gamers tbh
Bam, problem solved
All they have to do is hint at like, diablo 4 or something
Regardless, Blizzard is going to announce something and people are going to be talking about that and this whole thing is going to be a footnote and forgotten
That makes sense, rady
Oh, okay
The people who paid to go there are actively contributing to the thing the protesters are protesting, that's worth keeping in mind
I want them to be *talked about* but not hurting people
It depends on what we mean by bothered tbh
I hope there's no physical violence, at least, nobody deserves that
Blizzard has already shown they don't give a shit unless they lose money
Unless their customers are complaining
Blizzard aren't going to care, at all
Although in this case it's weird
Protests that don't bother people aren't going to achieve anything though
The best part, clearly
I was very pleased when Astral Chain let me pick a gender but like *what is that Jojo bullshit*
Some communities rely on other people who are unaffected, to also care and show support and sacrifice
If everyone supporting LGBT rights was LGBT we'd have a lot less people
Some people have empathy
That's a pretty big cost for just a +1
Agnostic theism, if you want to be more specific
Because we're the only ones who care, apparently
Also Rady, having pronouns in bio at all means you're probably trans right now
So that way having pronouns visible doesn't mean "this user is trans"
This is why it's nice for cis people to also be open about their pronouns
It was satisfying
Back when I was staff
Oh man I remember banning that "gay people don't exist" person myself
As stated above, methinks
So is gas and plasma
Yeah liquid is a fluid
Gendergas doesn't have the same ring
It's more the aspect of "can shift, is not solid"
"if I don't know what I feel like today, how do I expect you to know"
I don't know them personally though
I know of a few genderfluid folks who accept any and all pronouns
But I understand the theory
I can honestly say that I don't understand genderfluid people either. I cannot relate to that feeling either
It's a lot
It's
Hah, yeah
Genderfluid folks are non-binary
Genderfluid folks shift around, depending on a lot of things
I'm a woman, and I'm always a woman
So like
The people who are genderfluid is a specific subset
Often NB or enby
Everyone who is neither a boy nor a girl is non-binary
This is the non-binary umbrella
"Who don't identify with either of the standard gender identities"
Yeah, Anand so
I mean, you can't use subtext in academic papers either
And that demand of specificity, that removal of subtext, changes how you use language
Academia is completely different
Yeah, exactly
The dictionary has its place, but language does evolve, and pretty damn fast
But in a specific field it's always going to mean that particular thing
I agree with the "language is correct if you're understood" until it gets to technical writing
It could mean a lot of shit
If we're just chatting
If you're reading an academic paper, and you see the word "fluid" it's going to mean a very specific thing
Is technical writing versus colloquial
The main distinction here
It's actually a surprise when people call me sir nowadays
Yeah, I get people calling me ma'am so often that
<:paissasquint:297465028641161216>
That's me, no surgeries

<:laugheline:454887887847030814>
An entire pastebin rant
But that's like
For me it's *a lot*
So yeah, fear of the unknown is right
You don't know what it's like to hate it, and it's hard to imagine that
You like yours!
And yeah, like you said
The dick doesn't "make me less of a woman" but it does make me feel sick just thinking about it most days
But some people, it's not like that
It's bad
Yeah
And
There are days where I've come close to just, getting a kitchen knife
I fucking hate my dick
And, I'm going to be open here
It really depends on the person
Some people are perfectly happy with what they have
Some people find their genitalia to be harmful
So, dysphoria is different for everyone
(I'm not upset, btw, please don't think I'm attacking you)
Surgery doesn't magically make you look like another gender, nor is it necessary
Have you seen my selfies, Anand?
Related, the bartender just called me "girl" and that makes me warm and fuzzy
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
And I'm just here trying to be myself and that involves being a woman
And my brain is like "GIRL. YOU ARE WOMAN. BE A WOMAN BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE FEEL BAD"
So it's more the interface, rather than the brain itself
It's how the brain associates with societal norms and roles
It's not really *in* the brain
Gender is weird because it's like
It's amazing
One person calling me ma'am
Just
Because like
That's part of how I know for sure
I don't really
It made everything worth it
But then my friends called me using she/her and
"fuck."
"yup."
"I might lose all my family, right?"
"nope"
"I don't really have any money anymore do I"
"yup."
"hey, my life is gonna be way harder now ain't it"
It was uh
God
YUP
For a while
I was repressing bigtime
Hah, nooooo
Like anand is doing, like fuck dude this is great
And the important part is to look inwards and figure out if you need to change
Nobody's perfect, we all have pasts
Because I was an idiot
I thought attack helicopter was hilarious
Honestly
Bitch, I'm a lesbian
There's also this weird assumption that we're all straight? Like "why are you trying to be a girl, just be a gay man"
Gotten that stare a lot
God. Yup.
>the "you're an affront against god" stare is skin-crawling
It gets to you
Getting stared at is a bad feeling, and when it's pretty much everyone you pass
Also yeah the stares fucking suck
That was a real experience I had, for the record.
But yeah I like to know if I pass because, in Georgia. If I pass and wear a dress, no big deal. If I don't pass, and wear a dress, I've almost been shot.
It was a fucking shitshow
Have you seen that video of a cis woman being kicked out of the women's restroom because they thought she was a trans woman
Like I did with the bartender
But I like to tell people sometimes if I pass because it just, feels nice
Like "if you don't pass you're not a woman" is an awful thing to say
We don't like it being idolized
That's passing
If you see me and are like "oh yeah that's a girl, okay"
Also <@143129446046498816> I always got called ma'am on my drive thru at work, you'd probably get me right <:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>
***I*** had to deal with it too
And that's something that's hard to deal with
Yeah, the fact that you know I'm trans is making you push towards male
If I'm lazy on makeup or like, don't shave for a few days it's kinda obvious because I still have facial hair
I don't see it, personally
Idk
So I'm wondering why you'd say the person in that picture is male, because like
Blizzard and Contrapoints fighting for worst apology of the week
That's an oof
Just in time for my flight to actually start leaving
We got it sorted
That's okay!
It's really hard as it is
Please, please do
But, if we can make it easier for the people who are trans
Honestly, I wouldn't wish this upon my worst enemy
We don't want everyone to be trans
There is no "trans agenda"
Exactly
This is a "oh, you're asking for blockers? You, specific teenager, are actively seeking these? Here you go"
This isn't a "give all the kids blockers"
No!
What?
My tits are cones. My voice is too deep. I have facial hair.
Going through puberty twice is absolute hell, and the "proper" one is completely fucked up
And that happened because of puberty
There's no fixing that
Flatout wrong
Are wrong
My bones
Puberty is irreversible
They *want time to figure it out*
People aren't forcing these kids to stop their puberty
The *kids want the blockers* in most cases
Blocking puberty gives them the time to figure it out
People are going on HRT because they want to
That's kind of the point, honestly
I was always female but everyone got it wrong
I'm not going from male to female
And that's why I hate being called "MtF" because I was never really male
It's very, very rare for someone to get on HRT and realize "oh fuck wait"
I was just too stupid to connect the dots
My horrible depression started right about when puberty started
The puberty of your assigned gender can kill you
But if they are trans
Problem solved
Stop taking blockers
If they're like "actually nah, I'm my assigned gender" you just
Just delay puberty until the kid's sure, if they want it
And there's absolutely zero risk with puberty blockers too
And almost nothing is irreversible
There's a *lot* of time to go back
Meanwhile
I've had guys at work recoil in fear when I offer an estrogen pill (as a joke)
You're all "eeeh pass"
Right?
Does it sound amazing to you
Do you want this pill
Okay, if I said "here's this pill. It's going to drop your sex drive, shrink your dick, you'll grow tits, and you might shrink an inch or two"
But
That's not to say it doesn't happen
Are people pretending to be "former" trans people to sabotage us
Honestly, most "destransitioners" I've seen
The right decision
And it makes it all feel like
<:PapikaPout:636113698280439808>
<@99695384296701952> <:CarolPout:617039564313198602>
"a friend of a friend of mine" she says
<@99695384296701952> do u want nudes
Not the right channel to ask, but it's Miku yeah
She was apparently very stalkery
She wrote me a prescription for the thing I needed *anyway* but god I got screwed over
It took a round trip time of like, 5 hours, and the doctor ended up being the wrong specialty
In other news, I drove to New Jersey today
The *instant* age of consent got brought up is probably when I would have bailed on that anyway

Why does that keep popping up
"an equivalent form of the n word"
a slur has power behind it
`no they are not`
***they are official generational titles***
*neither is a fucking slur*
this place is not centrist
https://i.redd.it/oqm9smopexx31.png
fucking assholes
clearly boomer is similar, right
there's something to be said that "boomer" is thrown around but nobody dares speak the n word
a lot
it's
old white assholes saying that "boomer" has similar power to the fucking n word, that *they themselves used against real people*
Too much stuff to do and a way too high base level of stress
Spoon debt makes everything cost *more spoons*
And the irony
I'm exhausted in every way possible, I'm more irritable than normal
And I'm deep in spoon debt and I've been paying for it
About five or six

you have to find a job and then get paid a pitiful amount to generate lots and lots of profit for your employer
you can exchange it for goods and services
it's also called currency

<a:Police_Red:585625151685656577> Saki has a serious problem <a:Police_Red:585625151685656577>
alright, I guess
it's
I'm not good at anything but I'm pretty okay at a lot of stuff
mediocre at, at best
you could be like me and acquire a million skills that you're like
why am I such a problem

scotland knows what's up though
aided by Labour and SNP, whatever that means
yeah they've got a TERF in fucking Parliament on the Trans Day of Remembrance

the true neutral radical
*how*
kinda true, lots of bullshit, leave out the bad parts
resumes are basically marketing for yourself
and kinda lie about dates on some
I leave off entire jobs
why would you have to do that
just like how I don't put "hey I'm trans" on my resume
yeah
I'm a socialist
And "raising profit by exploiting X" is the defining factor of modern capitalism
Tracking doesn't make them viable, it raises their profit at the cost of exploiting consumers
The tracking maximizes their profit, but radios and television existed with broad stroke demographic based advertising

Money is not inherently important
Money is only important because money is required to buy things necessary to live
And has been since the 40s
Anything left of center is demonized
It's propaganda, for the record
(and I do believe that having too much wealth in general is also bad but that's harder to articulate)
That's why I specified
Hoarding anything causes problems and money is no exception
Because that's currency you're pulling out of the economy and not putting it back in
I'd argue that there is a point where being rich is a bad thing, if we're going purely on "how much money do you have in the bank"
Okay
Are you done
It applies to *marginalized* communities
Well
It does apply to every community
It reduces people down to a single attribute and makes it easier to demonize them
And why you shouldn't say "the jews"
Same reason we don't say "the blacks"
It reduces us to just our transness
It's dehumanizing
I'm not mad, just fyi <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
The right language is "trans people" or "trans folks"
Calling us "transgenders" isn't very appropriate
I know nobody asked for this but I do have to say this to a lot of gay men who are into drag
Yeah, most likely
And countless more lost to suicide
Yeah, really makes you feel appreciated
It's always good
Right?
on YT they basically get free marketing
it's marketing
free streaming isn't a service
that's actually a reasonable counterpoint
if they've got all the music, and are profit driven, they'll charge a subscription
god please not bilibili
And it's not exactly a good thing to have a woman say "I'm experiencing sexism" and then a man comes over to say "well actually no you're not"
Yeah True you're missing a lot of context here
but, mine was free so
imo
not worth it if you're buying it
it's a pretty good speaker
absolutely not
I don't trust that mute switch
I opened it up and physically disconnected the microphone
I got one and immediately muted it, free wireless speaker
location history, search habits, hell they've got people paying to wiretap their own homes now
they sell information too, I suppose
everything else is a platform to put more ads on
google sells ad space
I don't think you can afford a trip to Japan on welfare
And it's *a lot* of bits

Okay wait

shortly after
so that's 4
Let's Talk Symphogear
and formed his *own* discord
and come back as Antag
R had deleted his discord account
*meanwhile*
anyway
bringing up a lot of stuff I wasn't very proud of, and a lot of stuff I had said to them in private about insecurities and stuff
absolutely tore into me in this very channel
then Alice and their friend just
strained coexistence for a week or so
Melua rejoined staff, I came back and also rejoined staff, brought my bots back
Alice eventually gave up server ownership (good) to their gf (not good)
R was kicked as well
bout a month later, ish
stayed gone, pulled my bots off the server
"okay"
I was like
then Alice went on a small power trip and kicked me from the server
I stepped down, along with R, Melua and Scrmz leaving just Alice and their gf
Alice was talking shit about me behind my back, I wasn't happy about it
some shit happened
alright so then
yea
<@290431224596660224>
*then*
then Melua and Scrmz
I showed up
a boy named R was brought on staff
they and their girlfriend ran this server for a while, it was small but growing
that's us!
The rest of staff didn't really appreciate Alice's contribution to the server, so eventually they (Alice is nb, they/them) decided to fuck off and make a server just for the subreddit
Alice (this name is important) was the moderator of the subreddit, and was on staff for Valk
Valk (Discord of the Valkyries) is the largest Symphogear server, and it predates this by a while
now, we'll go chronologically
/sgg/ (4chan) has their server, they've always kept to themselves for the most part
there's actually at least 5
Can't remember what they are
There are subreddits
Idk, google
It's gonna be really disappointing for a long time
It's stressful
Aria I'm gonna say it's not easy
Normally T hardens the larynx nice and deep
Oh, interesting
Has he started testosterone yet
And I always get called ma'am on the phone now
okay, you can be an ally
him and Luci
yeah, he advertises the server with a pride flag
so I have bad blood there
the last I checked, Antag (R) [a cis straight male] was using the LGBT community to attract users to his server
we're so split
and
we're such a niche show
I actually hate how fractured the community is
anyway
that's pretty neat
we have had 107 unique users active in the last 3 days
I left after I was called a tr*p
Valk is run by bigots and is full of yuri-deniers and cliques
Valk is a hellhole
you did, but not because of users
we have 1155
valk only has 922
wow
I thought it was the biggest
it's smaller?
so that's where we stand
and nobody's heard from her in months
Alice's gf is still server owner of this place
anyway, most recently
sugarpunch is news to me
oh, right
oh, 7?
so that's 5
made a discord server
it's okay
and I'd rather not open up those scars
is very personal
that
yea
it was weird
then she said "I dont want a relationship" and then immediately asked Melua out
I dated her for two whole days
oh my GOD hazel
Hana cracked my egg, yeh
I mean the hurting me part
nonono
no
Hana just helped them shove it in
Alice had the dagger
nooo
but I know that would just lead to getting hurt again
I find myself missing them sometimes
honestly, even after all they did to me
it really hurt me
a lot
I trusted them
I
Alice was a big part of it for me too
but yeah we've got an entire history book worth's of stupid internet drama
and shoved him on his way
said wikia has their own server
I just
and he thought we were affiliated with the wikia
the wikia staff kept deleting his page saying the same thing
yeah
do you know how hard it was to be nice to him
until I DM'd him all nice-like and asked what was going on
he kept making new accounts and showing up
the wikia is why we had that one dude saying that (cw suicide) ||ugly people should kill themselves||
if you want to know, ask her
I understood the question just fine
but it's probably one of them? I don't know
I can't speak for her
at all
I don't like it
using my community as *marketing*
he's effectively
but

it was not enjoyable to have to live through
yeah, be happy
that's a different alice
haven't seen them in a while
I remember Alice being like "aw I liked that person, why are they leaving" at least once
Oh that's a valid take too
I personally can only really provide support to a very small list of people right now because of all the shit I'm dealing with in my own brain
If they reach out to a friend at any time, that friend isn't allowed to say "I can't handle this" without being excommunicated
but it's a really good backup plan
I'm not saying everyone who uses it is a nazi
it's perfect because you can signal to other nazis that you're a nazi and when someone confronts you you're just "dude it's just a meme frog calm down"
honestly the alt-right association is why he still gets used
like it isn't a very aesthetically appealing meme
ugly?
I think it's just
I personally am in the former camp, and also

if you keep moving the goalposts you can never be wrong
it'll end in tears
this fuckface has clearly looked into this more than you have
anand, it's not worth arguing something you haven't researched
I weep for Kirika in this moment

that's powerful
Bonus Chemistry and Being Around Crush
oh so
bonus chemistry sounds awesome
And if you didn't fit their set you got bapped
Or discovered
I mean, they didn't assume, they asked
No
Yeah and I say screw cisheteronormativity
I mean, cishet mostly-neurotypical is three adjectives
Oh, true
Cishet neurotypical white folks
I don't like them
Nazis want me, personally, dead
I mean, yeah they also killed gay folks and anyone who stepped outside of gender roles
<:SakiLaugh:539991687036928001>
I'm on brand if nothing else
Is "punch the nazi"
I love how my first contribution here in weeks
Also yeah Japan was literally part of the axis powers
To refrain from punching nazis
You get a pass
Fair
Alternatively kick him in the nuts as you walk off the train
Punch the nazi
So
I had to explain that to my dad once because my wallpaper put it up at exactly the wrong time

It's probably not on Fox News
Idk
I think you can claim pacifism in the US?
You'd never talk to a general

because the senate has gone on record saying they won't give a fair trial

god
Senate's already said they won't
that's your solution?
you're saying "lets make a power gap!"

Oh is this before an investigation?

Bulldozers is in all caps so it's probably an issue
I want to know what the problem is
It's just lies that they put on paper

I've met three people who said Ver was their favorite character
Ver is scum and people overlook his irredeemable villainy because "sugita! Meme man, haha!"
Anyone who says "ver is pretty great" needs to take a step back and say "would I say a rapist is pretty great?"
Also HEY LOOK WE'RE IN SERIOUS DISCUSSION
Turns out the dude was sexually assaulting trans men at cons
And *immediately* I got rancid vibes from this dude
He goes "oh, Ver definitely"
So I ask him who his favorite character is
And the dude was alright, and turns out he'd seen symphogear
I was introduced to someone by my roommate a few weeks ago
Speaking of
Yeah.
No they should not be emulated, I am not saying "yeah go be scared of gay guys"
Yes those reactions are problematic and rooted in my own prejudices

If they then tell me they're gay I'm actually going to be even *more* cautious
They're a man, I'm going to be a little cautious
Honestly if I meet someone, right

I don't think I'd be *offended*

Border camps in the US seperating children from families, denying healthcare from willing doctors, beating prisoners

I agree with Iski
And is very much "trans women aren't valid unless they pass like me"
She's pretty truscummy
I'm unsure why the mods are letting this continue tbh
You really do have to realize that by advocating for this system, you are actively wishing for the death of millions
On the basis that I "can't take responsibility"
I love it when people advocate for my death
Nice
So you want me dead
<a:MikuBlink:664329176244944897>
Bernie *is* the compromise, real leftists want Guillotine 2020
And people who have lots of money are absolutely terrified of losing it
It's because even the "left" is made of people who have lots of money
Politics just makes me really sad
And the fact that "Bernie owns three houses" when, to be a Senator you *have* to have a house in DC and your home state and the third is a tiny lake cabin that his family built
top of the image
I'm not a fan.
But if the only people allowed to have weapons that deadly are the *cops*
I'm not gonna sit here and say guns are perfect, or safe
I didn't know "Gritty is Antifa" was a thing but I'm glad they are
<:gritty:497554026607542274>

not that I'd traumatize him like that, roommate killing herself with your gun wouldn't be very nice
yes he keeps them locked up and away from me
my roommate has several firearms and he's incredibly careful with them
sorry
here I thought the objective was to stop people dying
I was talking about myself
I wasn't talking about some nebulous "suicidal person X"

<:MeguShrug:586122984637595658>
but, personally, if I ever get around to killing myself I'm just going to pick the easiest way, gun or no gun
yeah, most gun deaths are suicide
`I'm just miserable.`
`this is an unhealthy mindset`
I'll see y'all in hell in a couple decades
World sucks, it's burning anyway
Because a bunch of rich white slaveowners in the 18th century didn't think automatic firearms would be a thing and everyone treats their word as gospel
All the x-phobic propaganda in the media sure isn't helping either
üôÉ
Murder is already legal if you're a cop
I can confirm this
He lives somewhere where "having a talk" would be dangerous
<:Bayonet:660870998098444310>
because the democratic party is in "anything but bernie" mode
bloomberg literally ran as a republican in 2016
good luck getting that past the conservative nutters
you can definitely take New Parent classes
that's already a thing
pick one
either they're tax funded or you have to pay for them
and it becomes a class problem
that just limits it to people who can afford the classes
and they sure as fuck didn't deserve kids
my parents would have been given that license without a second thought
honestly
that's how you "get rid" of minorities
yeah I don't want the government in charge of who gets to have kids
`you said the trans word`
that's about the right reaction
yeah
I'm L-T
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
it's better than being ostracized but it's still not great
iirc that sandwich has a rainbow label
re: selling an LGBT sandwich and marketing it as such
yeah I love it when corporations appropriate my identity
Lettuce, Guacamole, Tomato and Bacon
I am accepting zero questions at this time
also asexual and aromantic identities are LGBT+ thanks for coming to my ted talk
it's got a ring to it
Lesbian, Gay, Bassist and Transgender
Bassists
Blasphemers
*right*
not romantic, but love regardless
i have a lot of love for bi boys
<a:bighost:607110630645694464>
I drew <:DMJii:549819519082692608> and <:Bayonet:660870998098444310> and added them here myself, I should know if they're on this server <:laugheline:454887887847030814>
those are all on this server

counterpoint
true
I still don't regret it
and the future I had planned was 100% demolished
I've brushed homelessness several times
they can go fuck themselves
if anyone is upset by you being yourself
not a damn
do I regret it
I got disowned by my parents, neither of them talk to me anymore
^ Nevis is saying what I'm thinking
*squints*
it's okay!
I don't "identify" as a woman, I *am* a woman
that's my preferred language
I'm a trans woman who is also a lesbian
TONY GLAZER
yes
from everything I know, that's a good thing?
Maybe don't just say "wut"
Socioeconomic mobility is crazy low
From irl
It's not too far off
I mean, the only way to get a lot of money nowadays is to already be born in the upper class
I was going to explain but nah I'm out
Oh, is that how we're doing it?
Unfortunately
You heard wrong, he lost Super Tuesday to Biden
<a:MikuBlink:664329176244944897>
so I stopped again, fingers crossed
I stopped drinking soda, lost 50 lbs, started drinking it again and put 30 back on
(SO WAS I)
Bye
***most presidents have not*** look why am I still here, the foreigner is claiming he knows more about politics
24 have not
21 presidents have had two terms
Okay that's straight up wrong
This reeks of propaganda
Why is this still happening
This person has done nothing but say awful things for the past few days! Why has staff not taken action
I'm just existing
I can't do what I want or eat right or get cool stuff
Being poor fucking sucks
It's called having a job
You have propaganda and prejudice
You don't have *any* data
`no comment`
But he's eaten up that propaganda
Like he knows he doesn't know shit
He's self-admitted as uninformed
<a:MikuBlink:664329176244944897>
Rich folks damage the economy by not paying taxes and not recirculating their wealth
How does an extreme minority taking a tiny amount of welfare damage the economy in any way
Also for the record I wasn't advocating a kick, just a warn
I mean earlier you made three generalizations of "all poor people *IN MEXICO*"
<@!263534352422404096> what was that about DNC primary votes mattering
they could come out and say "yeah we changed as much as we could and hoped you wouldn't notice" and nothing bad would happen
the DNC, as a private entity, is under no obligation to hold fair and honest votes
and no penalties can be levied
there is a legal precedent to allow the DNC to do that
so, even if they did fuck with the votes
Anyway he's not even talking anymore
Nah, nah he was yelling about MEXICO not india
Anand
I highly doubt it's that easy to game welfare in Mexico. There are people like that in America who are just full of prejudice and hatred for lower class people and love to think the worst
Hopelessly ignorant sounds about right
Other people who want folks to die can chime in at any time
Why do you keep bringing up "4 against me"
That's all
Nah, solo, he wasn't trying to start an argument! He just wanted to advocate for people's deaths
No admission necessary, just stop
Hell, you don't even have to do that, just stop spouting bullshit in this channel
I'm surprised you haven't already
Pointing at someone and saying "you and your family deserve to die" is monstrous
No, just the ones you think don't deserve it
That's what you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSWXWKEfLro
Anand is... Indian? iirc?
you also specified white
doesn't make them straight
yes
bisexuality is a thing
Go figure
Also yeah emotional abuse is no joke and it's probably why I hate myself
Idle musings from backreading
does it count as "breaking on the server" if I wasn't here when it happened?
Only fridays?

two hours ago was 1:20
I'm here too, it's between 720 and 1080ish

I'm a *valued member of the community* <:GarieSmile3:432431646717902849>
WOW
I ain't seen a lot of things
Nope
And why they get lewded anyway
I will finally find out why we can't lewd the keions
Did you get your tooth high again
Should be able to do the whole week
I'm the captain, joined by First Mate Shirabe and Crewman Cypher
The *HMAS Uncultured* is for people who've never seen it before
Your avatar is Chris so when I was putting us on the *HMAS Uncultured* I used Chris for you
<:wut:235243292965470208>
and then... Shirabe is Shirabe so duh
I used Chris for Cypher because avatar
No, I don't want Kiri associated with anything uncultured
I elected to represent myself with Basa because of the whole sakimori thing

No tickets required for the *HMAS Uncultured* so welcome aboard
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
I know that we're not supposed to lewd the keions but we do anyway
I woke up to a post saying that Pink Diamond and Todd Howard both died in IW and I nearly lost it
Aw shit really
and also *no spoilerinos here*
Might wanna update the channel topic
HMAS -> Her Majesty's Australian Ship
fixed the ship's designation so it's from a better navy <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
All aboard the *HMAS Uncultured*, apparently
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
oh look someone else who's in my boat
Shirabe, let me know when you get home on Saturday and we can catch up to the group <:MariaKappa:396363198347083786>
Yeah I can always watch the first couple episodes today/tomorrow
Like, 2 minutes ago
Aw nuts, my boss literally just scheduled me for an appointment on Saturday and I won't be home until 12:30 GMT
Yeah fuggin daylight savings
That idiom is more relevant than normal!
Respectful criticism of the captain's actions and a crew that feels like they have an impact on the runnings of the ship are both essential for smooth sailing.
And that's why you're First Mate <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Thank you for noticing this notice.
Your noticing this noticeboard has been noted.
The itineraries are posted on this noticeboard well in advance, keep an eye out
Tickets are free, so if you know of anyone that needs a ride, let em know
Yes, the three people currently on board the ship
Yea, been Saturday for 3 hours here on the West coast
Aight gimme 5-10 mins
yes hello
Buh
Yes








Should I post screengrabs here too for posterity
Aight I'm on my way home now, hows it going
Should work. My schedule is liable to change at any moment but as of right now, that's great
Thursdays are no bueno for me, but I can do any other weekday
<:MichaSleepy:432445419071733771>
peace l8
That's just episodes 1 and 5, I haven't gone back through 2 3 or 4 yet
ok that's all for now













That's aight
Oh lol
good news is I watched episode 5 on my own so y'all can do that one without me and I'll join up again for 6
I figured something like this would happen because my sleep schedule is all kinds of weird and I need time to not be dead, that's the bad news
bad news and good news
that ain't me
your first ping was at like 8:45am
Did y'all forget I'm pacific
yeah I'm free literally all day
<@284390402210136064> ^^
Tuesday is 100% open
Oh my god that last one
I kinda like the current name
how exactly does a yuri show have a straight protag
I'll join you inna bit
and wonderful
it's like 8 minutes long
I still think that after we finish Madoka we need to watch Meguka
ETA 50 minutes <@284390402210136064>?
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
Hey that's my line
Was worried I was gonna miss it
I'm so far out of the house it's almost like I'm outside
Oh thank god
all of these things
anger
disappointment
sadness
I'm missing the OP aren't I <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR MY INTERNET TO DIE
<:ShirabeJii:237687217437278208>
I'm right here
ibu
my firefox is using 2.5GB, but when Chrome had this many tabs it was close to 5
pls wait on meguka for me
My internet's down
?
stupid 32 character limit
You can change your nickname at any time, you know

but

trails in the sky
is tomorrow aight
I was gonna play TitS today
the one Saturday I was free we didn't do K-on <:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
Not unless the appt cancels again
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
am now
I forgot to add it
and we use dollarydoos
Australian keyboards also have @ on 2
Probably
I love Madoka, partially because it helped shape the kinds of shows I'd be interested in, partially because it was one of my first, and partially because Mami is a boss.
No spoilers for current shows; Madoka and I suppose Yuyuyu now
it helped shape the genre into what it is now, it's not ***the*** show
And Alice, I completely agree on that point
Madoka was the second anime I ever watched
Then suddenly dead
Like you said, 3 episodes, acting as a mentor.
I went in blind, and so Mami was super out of the blue for me
Yeah but I dunno, the business with Violin McTrashfuck is just really unfortunate
that's the reason Sayaka is at the bottom of my list
"i become meguka for kyuskiko"
Especially after some of the imagery in the final scene of the show
because of `one particular fight that I can't mention`
I *really* liked Rebellion
yeah, no rebellion
exactly.
if you say
so of course
the file name is daijobu.png
i'm surprised neither of you have tried it yet

>inb4 they go mad with power
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
that's the best
Yui's guitar has a name?!
Good point.
I personally wouldn't mind letting Ibu handle it if they want to
one of us is usually around, though.
yeah, pinging the group will reach all relevant people
anyone who wants the announcement will be in the group
We have the anime club group for that
Although that doesn't change super often, so it's not a huge hassle for one of us to handle it
Changing the channel topic to reflect currently watching shows was one of them
We can repurpose General General maybe? <@!127644949884698624> how's that idea?

I hadn't even shown daijobu.png to my friend who's currently watching because *the SONG uniforms are* ***amazing***
But team FIS are hard to enforce, especially given our bots *cough*
Yeah honestly character/outfit spoilers are big deals too imo.
And as do I.
As you should.
<:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
Well yes but I didn't feel it relevant for the "no spoilers" point I was making
Are there really spoilers in a SoL though
yeah that's exactly when my appointment starts
I will *maybe* be there tomorrow? What time is it planned for
That being said, I also really like GX <:MichaHee:260224421476696064>
It enabled every *other* mahou shojou, basically what Alice was saying
But it's not ***the*** mahou shojou.
so I'm going on 3 years now
I started watching... May or June of 2015. shortly before GX came out
That one stays out of non-spoiler channels from now on
`Secret Unlocked`
YOUSORO
HxH is our omega
aleph-null numbers, then you get omega
the number after all numbers is omega
its like
followed by HxH
let's watch one piece
just because people like to go off topic doesn't mean the channel's purpose has changed (cough <#336297808221044736> cough)
this place already *is* anime discussion
No, because symphogear spoilers aren't allowed there
just an episode or 2
I've seen a bit of gaogaigar
*what time*
what time
oh
Weren't we supposed to Rebellion today
slap da bass
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
wraiths are yeah, manifestation of negative emotions
aka Madoka
Soul gems are destroyed by the Law of the Cycle
It's just...
And I *really* like the movie.
My main gripe is that it seems to be confusing for the sake of being confusing
<@284390402210136064> I ain't puttin up with dead memes from a so-called "general"
you are under orders to ***ENJOY REBELLION***
iirc yea
enjoy rebellion
click the link
ibu posts a link
roundabout, yeah
Hype level:
What's on the table for your case
Excuse you, I will bulli you in response to your bulli of me ***thank you very much***
<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
You're in a ***helpful*** mood today
I don't think it is
Okay so unless the movie is 4 hours long I should be able to watch the whole thing
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312> <:MariaYell:336657352264646657> <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417> <:angrypaissa:332697344141295627>

***MOBILE*** <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
movie 3 is new
movie 1 and 2 were series
yes
small world
solo I'm dying r n because we literally just had a discussion like this <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
Homura v Mami.

BEST
THING 
EVER
That's one of my favorite movies, but I like knowing why someone would like/dislike it
^^
when's K-on *wait I can check*
but okay
I thought the conversation was being productive
<:BlueMadoka:454043800998772736>
I'm blue instead
wait can I retcon
*immediately strips and puts on pink outfit*
*checks under seat*
To me, the main source of confusion is "what is literal, and what is symbolism, and what is fake, and what is real"
YOU ALWAYS GIVE ME CLIFFHANGERS
INSTEAD OF WHAT
I've had to call off more than one DnD session because of that
That's super fair
My Mami-san is bigger than yours though so I win
this is the second fam

self-AngerDess
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
aw shit I'm out for lunch with the fam
the addition is seconded by everyone's favorite moe blob so I feel like it deserves special attention
I added nichijou to the list
Oh, Ibu
I really am
wrong place
oh
I can't ever find it
can you put the spreadsheet in the channel description
sowwy <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<@284390402210136064> I'll be in San Diego this weekend so no K-on!! for me
Might wanna make sure Ibu gets that memo
Nobody showed up for K-on s2 and only two people mentioned they couldn't
your opinion, man
that's just, like
she's building something
see
oh no she's fine
I'd like to vote for 1 and 2 simultaneously
Nope
especially considering the group watch
wasn't it already?
does that count
i gave you a ‚ú®
that ***is*** the main reason you have the club president privileges <:gtongue:363922311658602506>
you've got it, friendo
*grumbles* we have a bot for this, but fiiiiiine
yes
you'd have to ask her
I'm unsure
please do
this coming saturday I think
Since I host the bots, I feel useful regardless <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I'm still winding down from the alchomohol
9 hours
oh god GuP is in like


I always forget about that
Oh yeah feathering
If I remember my color math right, it'll be the white spots
And see where it is
Then make a difference layer filled with that color on the original
Try taking the rendered pic and selecting the color of the border
Sometimes if the image has a weird outline already it'll look strange, so try expanding the initial selection by more to delete more of the existing outline
Yes
Solves border problems and creates a nice outline at the same time
And then fill with an outline color (usually grey)
Invert, make a layer behind the image
Expand selection by a pixel or two, delete, retract selection
What I like to do is select all the transparency
I didn't zoom in too much on my phone, was my praise undeserved? <:BikiShock:447891354278821888>
<@193408538909868033> that is a high-quality cutout, not that I expected any less of you of course
Oh damn, I'm gonna find some uses for this one I'm sure
Pig-Rascal is my new band name
You can immerse yourself in the lewds of nothing-chan
I don't think so, maybe?
what a pretentious way to say beach town
`Set in a city where the skies and seas shine,`
Summarily ruined by DMJii being edgy assholes
Is that the Kyoushitsu Monochrome scene or something else
Slap da bass
Specifically the "use the BasaKanade duet knowing that Basa is there"
made me upset at her for a while
I liked her when she was introduced but the Monochrome stunt was just
I have a 30MB flac of Monochrome on my phone and PC

<@231025503643893770> what one chart
Same. Kiri didn't become my favorite until after AXZ
`shush, let me have this`
I cry every time I watch it
I hesitate to say more because apparently they're major spoilers
No, I've heard some *awful* things about various allegories
From what I've heard about SnK it's actually kind of awful and I'm glad I never got into it
You don't put cursed objects in a museum, you bury them in concrete under a pit of immortal snakes 5 kilometers underneath the vatican
Intentional or not, it's fucking cursed
When your friend has a little brother who's too young to get most of the references made by your friends in their 20-somethings, you gradually accrue knowledge of the memes of eld
It's cursed.
I have self-identified as a shitpost historian of sorts but that.. That needs to be hidden away.
It's pseudo-academic masturbation with a side order of dictionary abuse

No
That write up was awful and I hate it

Ice atop rock, iirc
<:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
Sounds like a good place for a gate to hell, tbh
Whereabouts is it?
Also halloween is always on the 31st but that's just 13 backwards
Coords can't be simultaneously N and S, or greater than 90N/S 180E/W iirc
66.6N 66.6W but yes
4 of which are symphogear
I've only seen six of those
wait what show is this so I can blacklist it forever
sure why not
<:AE3803Comfy:467756515240050690>
I like the aesthetic of nep nep
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
`I didn't even see it, thanks friend`
Symphogear GAYS
G, GX, AXZ, GAXZ
I'm sad it's not 4 letters
Oh yeah 2 more seasons until SYMPHOGEAR
God is gonna fuck or get fucked and I'm not sure which, or how
Zesshoushinai!
<:SerenaOhoho:449358389563359234>
so do you get why we ban it 'round these parts?
ah okay
just clarifying the question before I answer
oh you want to know what word is so unwelcome that we ban it here under the "T-word slur"?
I'll probably end up joining, saying hi, and immediately muting the damn thing
I feel like I want to join that server just for the bakuretsu emoji

***where***

<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Noot noot
and then I feel like the last three episodes devoted to the history of the gun, the reason why it's being displayed, were just a waste of time
you better fuckin make sure someone fires it
If you take the time to describe the gun on the mantle
me_irl
<:NononPout:454088299963875349> ?
Then binged that and AXZ over three days, y'all were here for that <:SerenaOhoho:449358389563359234>
I was stuck on episode 4 of GX for like two years
what hapen
the cgi show with all the aminals
<@!127644949884698624> didn't you watch that
I could very easily write a script for Shirabe to do that
https://vimeo.com/173849635
I've heard symphogear XV is pretty good
But yeah my personal server has a few that we use
Oh I have it too
<:MikuLewd:391808764816261122>
That one is actually one of Joe's, I think
Ya normally Melua and I swap when I find a new Dmjii art for us
Oh among friends it's different
Because of our adorable dmjii sync
Melua and I occasionally get comments on ours
Didn't realize it was important <:laugheline:454887887847030814>
I noticed a while ago
Are we still in the ara ara onee-san phase
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
It was unpleasant
I do enjoy waking up to pings sometimes but I was once woken up by six people telling me my bots were down
<@99695384296701952> I love you!
<:SakiLaugh:539991687036928001>
Because you're the only person able to ping everyone r n
I'm not an anime fan <:ChrisAngerDess:496162035856441354>
What's going on on r/anime?
`rinshan kaiho desu`
I think Saki does that with mahjong
`assuming the plot is simple enough to fit many people's tastes`
have you considered this?
is subjective
quality
perhaps
maybe
I can't tell which is supposed to be the "good" one
galloping bouncy ponies
green boys play
great british pound
If she has an hourglass, she ain't thicc
That is not the waistline of a thicc girl
Because it's one of the only anime I've ever seen
I say a variant every time I see a "what anime X" question
Symphogear, probably, it ended on a cliffhanger with those dead girls not being dead
while also thinking the only reason women exist is to have sex
they think it's the world's fault they can't get laid
sexists, bigots, and other horrible men who think women owe them attention
involuntary celibate
are they a villain or a joke

Make it accurate
Yeah if you're going to go to the effort of featuring something as a main event
That looks interesting

all y'all in the music channel, I'm doing some network shenanigans so Kirichan might be a bit laggy. I'll try keeping impact to a minimum
and now I get food
kiri should be back now, sorry for the interruption
I'll be leaving after HSV but the music commands channel is there
I haven't eaten in 26 hours <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
I need food
as much as I'd love to keep DJing for you guys
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

also one of my favs

good shit right there
I HAVE BEEN IN THIS PLACE BEFORE
This is stuck in my head so here
https://youtu.be/XCiDuy4mrWU
it's my fav Bikki solo
G-beat is sitting comfortably at #22 on my list
is okay <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I haven't gotten around to compressing those and uploading yet
Bikki shows up a lot in S1 and G playlists
Oh that's just my GX and AXZ picks
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Bikki is an essential part of that one
And don't forget Duo Shout
that's ALSO Bikki!
G-beat IGNITE!
and... uh...
That's Bikki!
G-beat!
hey, there's...
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
how'd you like my selection, Chossei?
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
`Although I do know all the secret commands`
She's here for everyone, not just me!
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i've paused her for you
use dess_play when you return
unless she goes through the whole playlist
she'll be there when you come back
alright I'mma leave you to it, have fun with G-beat

But if you wanna jam to my favs from GX and AXZ I can leave those on for you
I'm in the middle of playing TitS so I'll be leaving the DJ Corner after a couple songs
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I'm doing a temp DC but I'll be back shortly
<@209896097026408449> you want me to queue up my GX/AXZ playlist after this?
Ten second songs is legit, can confirm
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
here's $10, tell her to get something fun
98, you're back on Kiri duty
okay time for sleep

i've got a bunch of GX and AXZ music running on kirichan if anyone's interested
I think I can call that "mission accomplished" then
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Sound quality up to par?
<@137113218173632512> how's Kirichan treating you?
just so y'all know
i'm absolutely singing along
but she likes to take breaks in the middle of songs
it's no longer choppy *all* the time
we're running tests on a new version of Kirichan, to get rid of the choppiness
<:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
I'm linking it here for posterity
I wasn't answering the question
https://youtube.com/watch?v=1FPMF-yq8NQ
oh, now we've got Thomas Sanders
rap over the parks and rec theme
you picked a bad time lolol
this is a spoken word outro
turns out the parks and rec theme is really good to rap over
forgot he was on here, hella
OH SHIT IT'S E-DUBBLE
<@431656503490117632>
Trippy and I are listening to Kiri sing my personal playlist
I think I have like 3 different songs with "Shape of You" involved
Trip, thoughts on this one?
night JIm
I love this mix
and nobody is allowed to get upset
all are encouraged to join
welcome to the "saki made this for himself" party
yooo
thanks
I do now
well
50% songs that are good on their own right
50% meme mashups that work super well

like this one
it's also got just straight up bangers in here too
yes it is.
yes.
it's full of wonderful, crazy things
you joined in my "random" playlist
oh boy trip
CAPE!
hehehe
hey, sorry!
perks of being Kiri's best friend
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
The version of Gizagizagiri I uploaded is actually my ver. Hype Guitars
no hype *anything*
Pre-chorus, bam chorus
Nothing.
Gizagizagiri?
Melodious Moonlight may not have the hype guitars, but it's got *some* kind of build up right before the chorus. Same thing, different instrument.
because Chris-senpai clearly influenced Kiri with that one
and also
Dangerous Sunshine is #1 because of that
let's talk about those for a moment
okay
which is also on there, or at least it should be
yeah
It's amazing
Draft Folder is #8!

<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
you could just queue it up
SO I'M FINDING DIFFERENT MUSIC
YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT

what, not a fan of Eminem?

You wanna fite m8?
I'm jamming out to some other stuff atm, will check yours out soon
what is this majesty
too lazy to edit
nier even
I've been meaning to play niew
okay that's fucking dope
weezer covered agrica
fgucking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4c7EE8_IX0
Initial D is also on the shortlist
*considering CRAB RAVE*
I need more music
my symphogear playlist is only 3 and a half hours
So when I go hiking next week, the trailhead is nearly 6 hours from my house
we're well and truly off the deep end here
***no***
this one is pretty dope too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cXjcKTRWcg
this ones a classic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygI-2F8ApUM
Say it Aint Socal
also good
Wndrwll
is a real good one
Piss
but it is
it has no right to be
I know right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsoCe7C4Kmk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDjV0KlXfOY

also I think this is my new second favorite artist
yeah I can see that
https://youtube.com/watch?v=PGaeJz5blN8
Big Fan‚Ñ¢
this one is fuckin dope though
She's very versatile
Kiri's running the same song on two servers rofl
world dot execute, me
well thats a function call so just reading it out works
that's the one
30+ times
I've listened to that one execute.world song like
<@!127644949884698624> I'm adding that song to my Kirichan playlist, that's üî•

üî•
I had no idea ps3 emulators were a thing, shows how out of the loop I am
this is pretty fuckin rad either way
why have I not heard of this
>music is magic
I feel like I'm missing a lot of nuance because of my whole half-deaf thing but it's still wonderful
<:utazukine:439933437797728266>
Oh yeah you just rewatched GX didn't you
genocide?
but it gets better iirc
the discord compression doesn't play well with the intro
dubstep is cursed, clearly
I think those are the IGNITE's I've got on there
Playlist has... G-Beat, Ginwan, X-Edge aaand Trust Heart?
execution not so much
The idea is solid
I like a couple of em, but yeah
DE DESS
DESU DESU
HAPPY NYAPPY
<@138131889142628352> <:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
WOAH WOAH
but when I'm in the mood, yeah it's hella
Absolute Territory is one of the ones I have to be in the mood for
Fucking words to live by, those
*We don't kinkshame, no
If you're into it
Just be into it*
The elf futa one is We're Shameless and it's catchy as fuck
`Burgz is also highly recommended`
Yeah sometimes I'm just really in the mood for Burgz
in roughly that order
It's SUaTT, Wear, and Blue
Blue is definitely in my top 3 ashcorps
assuming you're familiar with Touch Fluffy Tail of course
For Ashcorp, I recommend Wear, Shut Up and Trust This, Blue, and On the Rocks
I also think I heard bits of it in a meme video at some point
maybe Ashcorps cover?
understandable
slap da bass
it's da best
have you checked Every Note yet tho
the Ashcorp cover of Paralyzed is also great
I'll be around when you're done I promise
go listen to Hellbent, Every Note and Paralyzed
Fucking ***Paralyzed*** though
There's... uh... Magic, and Hellbent, and Forever
Every Note is dope
Oh what, damn you gotta look his stuff up
we killed her
<@431656503490117632>
or is it just me
did Kirichan break for you
nice song choice
*perfection*
that's wonderful
Wasn't the like, mid-90s western cartoon era like that?
Oh so it's one of those passion projects?
what exactly is gainax
`I'm counting Tsumugu Mono and Monochrome as B-sides`
GUN BULLET is definitely my 2nd favorite Chris main song
she's well versed in meme lore
half the time I use kirichan is for meme songs
nah you're gucci
Eat lightning, crap thunder from Bikki AXZ is also a good line
I really love "To my dearly beloved Kiri-chan" from Draft Folder
I personally don't mind choppiness if it's not like, sizeable fractions of a second
a whopping 96Kbps
we're at max bitrate too
yeah it's kinda trash
by faaaar
Shirabe's best B-side
DRAFT FOLDER
if not my actual favorite
BARK at the MOON is one of my favorite instrumentals
then episode 9(?) happens with the Chris Tower Defense
yeah it was a lot of "this is how this universe works" exposition and Bikki pawnching things
<@431656503490117632>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
DESS
DESS
DESS
YES
I sing along to <:utazukine:439933437797728266> on the freeways
Maria's AXZ B-side is wonderful
This one, Chris' GX B-side
I've got several DMJii B-sides on the list
They're pretty great
so much
I love this one
How dare they
Best song in S1? When Chris exists?
FLIGHT FEATHERS is the only Basa solo on my shortlist
ZENBU
Makyuu Ichaival or riot
Dark Oblivion is cheating
thanks for doing it yourself <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I was about to correct you
Ibu, I said Makyuu Ichaival
spinners are my pick
this editing is wonderful
if it's intentional then carry on
I got used to it about halfway through though
The only thing I thought was a little off was that the rapid synth seemed to change chords at an odd timing? But that might just be me. It felt like the chord should change, and then it didn't, but then it did and it threw me off a bit
<@193408538909868033> It's simple, but that's definitely not a bad thing. Jam status: üî•
I'll put it on on the way home, gomennasai
I forgot to put it on in the car because my memory is basically a block of wood
I'll give it a listen in a sec
I know, I just like that song too
*here's a little song I wrote*
> Hurt (Johnny Cash)

mah man
oh there was a patch for her released
I thought P5 was hella popular
How are there no maps for that
`Haiku. `
*You should consider
Happy Smile Vacation. 
Add it to your list.*
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
***do you know
what would make
it stronger***
but you know what would make it stronger?
Okay that's a really strong set list
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
I will not have you besmirch the name!
Bringing joy to all those whose ears it graces
It's a modern wonder
But Happy Smile Vacation is an international treasure
Dangerous Sunshine is my number one song, yes

Revenge is probably the one I'm thinking of then, not 3
Oh hmm
right there in the title
it was TAKEDOWN
Oh, so my memory was better than I thought
something about revenge
it was the first one that let you I think
and whatever Burnout let you blow up your car to fuck with other people
I had Burnout 2 Director's cut
I already liked the Gorillaz tho
that gorillaz song is a Good Jam‚Ñ¢

What really
There was a mixup
here's a Chris activation too


at the end of Gekishou he talks about how he noticed something twice and could feel it coming a third time
completely blind
but Edge Works wasn't on soundcloud at the time
Edge Works > Oyuko > Gokuren
Oh, agreed
I paid for the Shul Shagana one <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Fairly certain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzPP39TngO4&feature=youtu.be

we're merging this and music-commands

Kirichan can sing for you! Simply join the voice channel DJ Kiri's Corner (do that first) and use the command:
dess_q [youtube link] without the [], and she'll join the channel and start playing the video.

dess_pl [youtube playlist link] queues an entire youtube playlist. 500 video limit.

dess_lq lists the current queue.
dess_next skips the current song.

That one and Beverly Hills are probably tied for my top 1
`I'VE COME UNDOOOOOONE`
https://youtu.be/LHQqqM5sr7g
Goddamn okay go listen to Undone, Say it Ain't So, Beverly Hills, and Buddy Holly
Also yeah Caravan Palace is dope
<@193408538909868033> what's your favorite weezer song anyway
it's ***beautiful***
<@!142136901602770944> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4pXdE7dS1I HOW DID I MISS THIS ONE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEt7KMekpms
Mouth Moods is just way too good
This is another top pick of mine
https://youtu.be/3cXjcKTRWcg
<:utazukine:439933437797728266> *Adrian Brody*
That's a ***damn*** good one too
It's simple but very well executed
It's my Niel #1
https://youtu.be/epTeA3Uz194
But my absolute favorite is...
300mb is one of my fav Niel songs
that's some good shit right there. I feel like the horn is a touch too loud, but that's just because I'm a huge fan of that piano melody and it needs the spotlight
damn that's a good cover
https://youtu.be/2Q1Y1O9DBhQ
Whenever September's Children comes on I have to drop whatever and just listen
But I ***love it***
Yeah it's definitely not for everyone
And they made it a point to mention that they don't ever sing about *actual events* and focus more on the underlying concepts and causes, rather than the symptoms
So when I saw them in concert last year they gave a little speech in the middle about how they love everyone who makes them able to keep existing

***ALL BECAUSE OF YOU

The Good Left Undone is great too
Or Wolves
Listen to Satellite again
Rise Against's songs always have a reason to exist
They're "September's children."
Specifically, LGBT teens.
Suicide, yes.
I had to be told about them before I noticed, stupid hearing loss *grumbles*
Did you hear the names?
Hero of War is one of my favorites but September's Children is #1
Which one did you like the mostest
As far as Growing Up, I used to think that my parents thought the same about me. Nowadays, it's a little more melancholy. What should have been, I suppose.
All of them
Okay Scrmz go listen to all of those songs I listed
It still makes me cry.
https://youtu.be/6mhtJduoCZ0
Now go listen to Growing Up
Yeah like, he can be stupid and he can be deadly serious
Compare "And We Danced" to "Starting Over"
Macklemore does similar things, in a completely different way
MSI is good civilization
Oh and can't forget Hero of War
September's Children us probably the most most important
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

`is it any good`
<@99695384296701952> ***WHAT***
***WHAT***
I can't enjoy the rest because *I know what's coming*
But that particular one absolutely ruins it
Literally any other meme song would have been amazing
Not least of which because it's an old white priest using the n-word
I actually hate it
<@99695384296701952>, that song is ruined by the fucking Christian rap thing at the end
<:F_:310140262561087521>

FFXIV isn't the greatest for sci-fi cosplay q_q
Threw this together with stuff I had on hand https://puu.sh/zXbfc/4334c589b3.jpg
ship 2
it's on hiatus right now but we're gonna get to it eventually
with a couple m8s
I'm actually just starting pso2
Do any of y'all play: FFXIV, rainbow 6 siege, elite dangerous, monhun
I used to play the original stadium at LAN parties in high school
which trackmania, aren't there a few
every time I poke my head into this gaming channel I'm reminded of how I'm not nearly weeb enough
pretty sure there's a doom3ds port floating around
You can do all sorts of shenanigans with a homebrew 3ds
very comprehensive guide
<@!127644949884698624> <@269526749249929227> and maybe <@174440042289168384> https://3ds.hacks.guide/ prepare for fancy 3ds stuff
So that's lost to the ages
and I never uploaded that one
On my old 3ds I also changed the BGM to makyuu but that was **SO MUCH EFFORT YOU HAVE NO IDEA**
not official ***in the slightest***

I'm famous
I haven't checked in months
OH CRAP IT'S GOT 43 DOWNLOADS
That's kind of my thing, hardly anything for us exists so I have to start from scratch
I made it myself of course


oh, while we're posting pictures of D(es)S screens
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
>mfw pokemon has better cosplay potential than ffxiv
wow, that likeness is actually uncanny
nope not me who would even do that <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
definitely didn't read that as Camilla and was about to go into Fire Emblem stuff
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
go sleeeeep
I've got one on steam that I've never touched, not sure which
I never did any singleplayer stuff
So I'm not the only one who noticed
noice
same
Dream Tank Match sounds interesting
<:wut:235243292965470208>
small world eh
oh yeah it's totally primal, just checked
rip
Then naw, I'm on ultros which is primal
Is that primal or aether
Was hella weird
I got matched into a dungeon with Chris Yukine once in ffxiv, while I was still Yukine Chris
No wonder it sounds like her.
Wait so the voice I'm thinking of is *actually* Nana?
I also tried to make a Chris but failed so now I have a vaguely Chris-shaped cutie
I swear, one of the voices in PSO2 sounds exactly like Nana
Cruisin' round space punching people until they become her friend
Making a Bikki-inspired character in Starfinder r n
All I know about FFVII is Cloud and Buster Sword
So by working on ep 1, they're *also* working on all the others by proxy.
Exactly
So you'd just be working on *new* stuff because the foundation is there already
Models are made, engine is stable and configured, animations are done
Assuming they aren't redoing *every single asset* for each episode, then once ep 1 is done it'll be much, much easier to do the next ones
Yeah, and our ffxiv sub money got shoved into that too and we get a whole 1 dungeon a patch now
But can they run Crysis?
It's got craazy fps and stability issues iirc.
Oh did they fix all those issues with the NieR port finally?
the only one that actually gets scanned is vigil
I drive my drone into a room with all 5 defenders and scan

dat 147 person everyone ping
did get some gun skins off the market
I'm still rocking the character creation gear, literally no idea what I'm doing in pso2
Looks cool but also *muh spaceships*
Is this that Frontier Dev game that they're siphoning E:D funds off for?
gas gas gas tho

She does have enough gold to craft *yet more gats* so that might be a thing that happens
Leaving her to just stew in her own mind, except there's an NPC here that's got a bunch of clockwork stuff keeping her busy
And now he's off doing diplomacy (which he is *very* bad at unless Kriisa is there to stop him from saying too much)
So he's making it worse, and she got so angry that she learned how to aim two guns at the same time to show off how much better she is than him
Kriisa's got some magical PTSD, and the party member she's closest with is *entirely* clueless and thinks she's just having a tantrum

>tfw it isn't on pc
halo online 0.6.0 is up after two years of dev time
Dark Souls shenanigans are pretty top tier shenanigans
Did I miss talking about Steep
<:SecretPeek:409855511043899404>
My old one was from the same scene. Good taste.
and ***diamond pipes***
Those wooden engines
Oh yeah that too.
that was about it
oh and a furnace
No cables, two different ways of generating power, and a jetpack
I started in alpha, then when Industrialcraft (the original, none of this IC2 bull) came out I was like "wow this is neato"
Humble beginnings, amiright
We just started like yesterday

No longer nervous around the cops

So Halo 3 is a thing again, but on PC this time
Fun game, I enjoy it, Switch release when, etc.
that opening cinematic was ***HYPE***
bootin up battletech now, let's a-go
Got space for one more in Siege if anyone's interested
How could I name it anything other than D√°insleif
I have a sword with an "Evil Iron" blade and a lead handle
That happened with a bunch of Weird Al songs for me back in the day
Oh, I thought they were PS3/vita era
I've been told I would probably like it, but I don't have any Sony hardware
I've never played any persona game
What was the issue with save points
What was the situation in 3?
I prefer the alt title. https://i.redd.it/mpv8p9shfot01.png
My friend and I are on a third party expert pack
Because those structure blocks looked like washing machines
the autocrafting in AE1 was always called "The Laundromat"
Yeah AE1 is almost a different mod
Applied Energistics 2 is even better, more complicated
Ender conduits are super simple for basic stuff, but I love them for how fancy you can get

... thanks?
https://puu.sh/Abdrk/6ba0245b5b.png
Dang, that beefy
Didn't help that I have negative interest in WoW
Oh nice, I never really got into that game despite my friends' best efforts
Toki?
Our swashbuckler occasionally finds grapes in his backpack that he definitely didn't put there
My backup is a fae rogue that's actually been following the party around this entire time and nobody knows apart from me and my DM
I've added two classes to 5e, one firearm user that's rather different from slinger, and Nanoha device users
Kriisa is a dual-wielding pisol wielder
Oh did you port slinger into 5e?
Thronewarden as an archetype
Gunslinger, yeah
Pathfinder
Definitely highest dpr of the group, feelsgoodman.png
So, Kriisa has been dumping round after round into what are maybe zombies, and also definitely cannibals
So, therefore, it's gonna be May
Basically, April is nearly over

Anyone down for FFXIV or Siege shenanigans soonish?
so that's fun!
Apparently, Rinna Mayfield is also voiced by Ai Kayano
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>

<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
Definitely a Good Thing‚Ñ¢
I have absolutely no idea what this game is but I'm assuming it's a mobage and also that this card is a good thing
"That's not even a magic tome, it's just a dictionary"
"I fucking know"
So when does Gunkolle open up anyway, that's soon ain't it
Thicc thighs save lives
Maybe Big Bertha as NPC
Just gun, no boat attached
isn't that Kancolle
And that bullet belt she's holding is obeying absolutely none of the laws of physics we're aware of
like I'm not sure she's even wearing pants
fuggin M2HB over here
At least she's tasteful, unlike
Spectre is a ***fucking solid*** replacement though, dat color scheme
but she's a 5* <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I need Vector so badly
üëå
Spectre tho

Why is this one a neko
none of the other guns are nekos

<:wut:235243292965470208>
>Maplestory 2
that's absurd that it would go off like that
but like
no like if someone's surrendering and they *shoot you* it's fine to shoot back imo
what a horrible handgun
that's awful
Ah yes, the good ol days before that was declared a *war crime*
more bullet = better
Nah nah
The holes are so the barrel doesn't *melt itself*
it's like the engineers knew that a gun needs to do certain things, but they had no idea how to make it happen, so they slapped a bunch of random ideas together and it ended up working
that's a CRANK
that's not a bolt
How tho
What, crank?
P90 is pretty rad, yeah
simultaneously
I love and hate top-loaded magazines
is that a Browning?
With World PC soon after, probably
yoooo Monster Hunter Gen Ultimate for switch coming in August
I'm not sure I want to
That's a lot
How complicated are the menus
Most of them are adorable
No point in rerolling, the "pulls" are hella cheap and just take time

Got a dummy link for Spectre so now I have two adorable orange SMGs
So basically, if you don't one-shot them they'll one-shot you?
that was a fast 4 hours
rolled so many SMGs and all I got was Suomi
I feel like I'm going to be wanting the Vector for a while
every symphogear flac + waifu guns, life is good
So glad I invested in that 64gb SD for my phone
*yes I am aware the boats have guns*
I like guns more than boats so here I am
good thing I have other games to play while I wait on this one rofl
What do your squads look like so far
Ah okay, so I'm not super in the dust
I wasn't in the last beta, was progress carried over or what

I am
one of these days I'll go a cruisin' for the lewds
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Or two-shot
I like the cloak but isn't it a little cold for the rest of that getup

oh that's wonderful
Probably
Aoi and Ayahi are pretty much the only ones I specifically look for
Aviators and Aoi not good enough for you?
The one I just posted
I do have the voice pack but I haven't been using MGs yet

Fuck me, really?
Free 4* that you shouldn't use for a while, some boosters, and a bunny girl costume for said 4*
Yea, seems like it's still active
Excellent taste in SMGs, Joe <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
6834 is my ID
I'm hosting the *Protagonists Squad*
Handguns are super easy to roll for too, you'll have her in no time
she tosses the revolver and does a BAN
Victory animation


dmg+accuracy buff + big group damage skill
She's actually hella good
Which one of y'all wanted this one?
"So are androids made by skilled craftsmen?"
DM: "Yes..."
"So then they're masterwork, right?"
DM: "Probably, why?"
"That means our barb should have a +1 to all their rolls, right?"
DM: "No, that's just for weapons."
"What if we define him as a sword?"
DM, (who just finished GX like 2 days ago): "... fucking *no*"
M4A1 is a story 4* AR that has a godlike tile buff
Skorpion is a 3* SMG you get from story and she's one of the best offtanks
SV-98 is only a 3*
One of the things I like about GFL is that a lot of the 2* guns look just as good as the 5* ones
Although I do like the extra couple mags on the belt, nice touch
Not my aesthetic, personally

Go figure.
I have both of the ones I don't want.

Only three 5* SMGs in the game.
Wanna talk about classy though, talk about the M1 Garand
Although the specter m4 comes close I suppose
SV-98, my current adjutant. She's my favorite so far, by far
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/326604005037834241/445330203556970540/Screenshot_2018-05-13-14-01-53.png
Springfield.
I do have this pretty lady though
best I can do
Gomen
I don't have her yet though so no pics
she's aight, actually
There is
M9 is... M9
Astra's a good budget unit
The Makarov is actually hella good
But yeah this craft could be the M9, or it could be Makarov or Astra
She really reminds me of Chris
This is the C96



and she's *super* loli if that's your thing
M9 is slightly better than trash because you can disassemble for cores
I swear if this is another M9 I'm gonna scream
My other slot is a 2* AR so go figure
If I read my timer right, I've got a Thompson in production right now

Holla
usually 2* but the occassional 3* too, and 4* is on the drop list but I haven't had that happen yet
Yeah guns drop, fairly often

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjKL-jNPDWM
she *L I C C*
<:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
I used the tokens from the dailies, not a huge fan of a lot of the stuff in the current pool but it gives bonus batteries
it's the little things
nice touch
I like how the garter is also an attachment rail
***ABSOLUTE TERRITORY***

*absolute territory*
128sqrt(e980) is approximately 6606. It also reads "I love you" if you cover the top half.
Excellent looking firearm
That's half of why I like the SV-98 too
The gun is pretty sleek, I will admit
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Why PP2000 btw
My room is aight, got lucky with the free tokens

I like her bandana
My SV-98 should be hanging out in your dorm now
I'm 100% okay with either
I've got one of the UMPs in the oven right now
YUS

<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
tag urself I'm Chris
Shitty personality is objective though, yeah I'll give you that
Hey, that's just, like, your opinion
Big impact.
She's so *full of herself*, and deservedly so, and it made it that much better when Ryuko actually had her worried
Oh no way, Nui is definitely top 5.
I will say that the first double transform near the end was fuckin *powerful*
"Oh, it's that part of the episode, is it?"
It loses its punch.
See, my problem with that is how they use it for literally everything
Best theme.

Jakuzure > Mako > Ryuko

That's a weird way to spell "first" but hey, maybe it's slang

The hair streaks are the best though
SOP II is a B tier: Waifu
UMP 9 is A tier: Waifu, very effective
Skorpion is a personal C tier: Not waifu, very effective

woo, my main echelon just broke 7k effectiveness
I had a lot of memes on the archipelago map but I hated it
I can't remember names for shit
also the beachside hotel map?
Metro was alright, but I did really like the map with the giant tower
slug shotgun sniping was the best
Oh man BC2
also switch now, actually
nah, I play PC only
I suddenly feel like playing a shooter that isn't tactical or tactical-adjacent
And is also my adjutant in GFL <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
The SV-98 was my go-to sniper in BF3

I love the FAMAS' aesthetic
Which is?
me too thanks
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
These loli cowgirls really like me for some reason

I got another one
the first step to solving a problem is admitting you have one
She does look pretty rad
<:GenjurouThumbsUp:267393750349643776>
I'm assuming that's a good ship
I'm a big fan of the parasol and dress
Which parts?
Ew.
Oh do you need one of those stupid Torx screwdrivers
3770.

2770, I think?
I'm rocking 20GB of RAM and a legacy i7 CPU
Welp.
*watches trailer*
this would be really nice on the switch

***THAT'S NOT HOW THAT WORKS***

>simultaneous Rogue-like and Rogue-lite tags

XDU fucking eats my battery for breakfast, but GFL is actually pretty decent
That's about the same for GFL lolol
For real tho, GFL is super friendly to F2P folks
I think Kerrik is allergic to mobile games

NB: Not every gun on the chart is available on EN yet
For anyone playing Gunkolle.

27 in July, Kerrik <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Wow, I see how it is. Ganging up on me because I dare to be different
fun*
Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is fine
Trip, you gonna fight me, and then we're gonna go online in 2v2 and destroy bitches
I have 2 of the 3!
<@!388516680742993933> you should invest in a PC, I play games there lots

I think
Oh, if anyone has a PC for gamu, rainbow 6 siege is free weekend
MHW PC is gonna be bomb a f
You know **damn well** that's not what I'm referring to
Why not
The regular ones unlock the logistics missions with are 400% the reason I'm not broke
I'd suggest going as far as you can in the regular missions before doing emergencies
What story mission are you up to?
Ah
Ooof, how's your ammo storage?
MGs don't do well if the enemy doesn't die before their first reload
Gotta make sure you keep her levelled+enhanced for that then
aka Gunkolle
Girls Frontline
MGs are when you want the entire enemy squadron to die before they finish walking up
MGs are amazing for burst damage
It was divine
Overnight
I actually brought my Switch on a solo hike up a nearby mountain and played through Celeste up on the mountainside
And yeah I tried to get all the strawberries I found
The hotel music is the *best*
Ye,
Isn't it! Have you made it to stage 3?
Oooooh Celeste, good stuff
6000/2000/6000/4000 is pain
not like I'd want to try rolling for them right now anyway
not yet
2 extra revolvers = 6 more cores
they all buff each other and get super beefy
apparently lolisquad of HG only is decently viable
I've already got WA but the <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> squad must be a thing
well looks like I'm gonna keep rolling rifles until the end of days
What about WA2k?
This is excellent news.
Rifles are my favourite gun class.
Fuck me sideways, really?
oh my god now that you mentioned it *how on earth did I not notice the dess AR*
notbad.jpg
Wow she even has an evasion buff for her SMG friends
Yeah.
Oh wait for some reason I thought she was SMG
UMP9 is my Squad 1 main tank, and she's an A tier so I don't mind keeping her there
She's one of my Logi team leaders right now but goddamn I think she's now my Squad 2 main tank
I KNEW THERE WAS A REASON I LEVELLED HER
HOW DID I NOT NOTICE
I'm on 5-4
It's way easier to return later, and you get to unlock better logi missions and the AR squad
But I've gone back and gotten ez S-ranks up to 3-5 now
Yeah I gave up on S-ranking everything after like 2-4
Blessed SV-98
220 more friendship points until I get get my waifu rifle icon
Kohinata Miku
Bad news for you, both versions are active accounts
She's Japanese
Akatsuki Kirika.
No!
Literally as soon as clubs came out I snagged the Symphogear name and Zesho tag, just in case
*stupid five letter restriction*
I wanna add you to the club so you can rep the Zesho tag if you want
I accepted and immediately forgot your name
oh my god
that under-stage brawl
Oh my fucking GOD SNAKE WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO THAT POOR THING
Yeah I can't play now either
send me a request and I'll accept whenever I finish patching
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Awesome, still got my name.
HotS is strange.
Oh yeah I remember that
yeah it ain't for everyone
sure, lemme make sure I still have my old name
*so many*
I've got *so many skins*
nice, I've been looking for a reason to play again
What server are you on?
Used to play the *hell* out of League
but yeah I'm down to talk more about GFL or LoL honestly
<:wut:235243292965470208>
league of legends is a game right
I used to work for Radio Shack
Ooof, I remember those days.
Tutoring is interesting, my "weekend" is tuesday and wednesday usually
This'll be the first Saturday I don't work in.... four months?
0205
I should probably sleep soon
and the top one is Mt. Wilson, near Los Angeles
The very last one is like 20 minutes from my house
Zaca Ridge, up in Santa Barbara
That middle one with my tent is where I beat Celeste
I can see the ocean from the roof of my house
Pics from my last three trips

Southern California is decent for mountains, bad for rivers and lakes
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
27 Ah, ***2 pounds***
Weight is king for hiking, every ounce matters
I should keep looking.
Hmmm... 20 Ah, 13.5 oz; vs 16.75 Ah, 10 oz.
Either way, I bring a battery bank regardless
BotW is around... 4 hours? And that's worst case.
I was playing Celeste, which is 2d, and it was going strong
Depends on the game
Plus the whole "take it on the mountainside and play video game in quite possibly the most picturesque place you'll ever play video game" thing is super neat
Basically, if a game exists on PC and switch I'll usually get the switch version, just because I need more reasons to use it
I'll be playing on Switch
So that'll be my July
Yeah, right?
Also Nana Mizuki is involved somehow, as is Elements Garden
One of the main characters has Kiri's CV, *and* apparently music is a big part of the story and battle
Shining Resonance Refrain
I've already got a JRPG remaster to look forward to this summer, and I still need to finish Xenoblade 2
Huh. That's hit or miss iirc
Find out who's doing the port, and look up their history
Normally I'm completely and utterly against preorders, but remasters are an exception
I have no idea what it's about but I love the meme names
dangit ronpaul?
which?
my logi teams have been doing *work*

In that case: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nyHPIcbn88
or is it different
Is this the same thing as Monster Girl Quest
sadness
If there's a lamia I'm 1000% interested
what *kind* of monster girls?
And what price change?

Oh I've just been rushing to boss, should I bother with S-rank?
yeah, like that costs exactly $0
1-6 drop
not too much grinding but every now and then
Oh wow, I've been trying for her for a few days now
ye
it's okay, someone forgot to lock in and we went back to siege instead
bouta play a game of league for the first time in months, who wants in? space for 2
same tho
Oh, Factorio. Bought into that.
If it releases, and it's good, then sure
Exactly
I don't buy early access on principle unless it's Zachtronics, and they haven't done an EA in a while
Looks interesting, but >early access
Never heard of it
that's a good one
https://clips.twitch.tv/TangibleNastyRaisinSSSsss?tt_medium=create
or are other genres okay
do you want specifically JRPG
Ooooh you gotta PC?

GFL authentication serbers are down or somthing, all my logi needs refreshing <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

That'd work, as long as you dont get wiped out by one enemy from full
I have 129 quick production and over 200 instant repairs
I know right
just interesting because every other chapter has one
Oh yeah, I know
no T-doll contract drop though, which is interesting
dat token drop
Chapter 6 logis

Operation Sneaky Bikki was a resounding success

I might be able to sneak behind and cap the command post
I'm attempting 5-6
holy shit chapter 5 in GFL is intense, story-wise
FGO?
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
that was more of a nani the fuck
I'm well aware
nani
DR/*vorpal*
I've yet to deal with any of those creatures. I have thrown wraiths and banshees at a party before, as a DM
hey I was talking about my tabletop rpg earlier
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
further update: she died to the bullet with her name on it
update: the bitch-ass showed up to the arena
Or an AR and an HG being also good
Yeah that's all one AR needs to be dope a f

I got another one

I also referred to my character as Tsubasa on accident because I was looking at this image at the time
Kriisa killed an ogre in one turn by unloading two separate firearms into its giant hulking body
along with Makyuu Ichaival
convinced my DM to add Gokuren Igalima's instrumental to the combat playlist
bitch-ass better get down here so I can shoot his butt
wow that enemy didn't even show up to the arena
indeed <:chris:431225538120515586>
if the enemy doesn't die to that bullet she's gonna be super embarrassed
Kriisa has carved the initials of an enemy into a bullet
you have ***4***
granted, that 5* was Suomi, so <:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
meanwhile i haven't pulled a single 5* in almost a week
damn
the guides joke, that is
oh is that where that's from?
trust his recommendations
im waiting on both of my main tanks to finish repairing after the last 4-3e run
is that a yandere boat
https://youtu.be/thNc39dah_U
serber up
but if you ain't, you screwed
so if you're still in, you're good
authentication serber down
2k of all resources when it's back tho
same

well yes, but for someone who's not super experienced it's a hella good starting point

I'll upload monster manual inna bit
I have a *ton* of resources for 5th ed

gimme a mo
but Im also in a siege match
I DM'd a 2 year long campaign in 5e
new DMs should definitely look at the monster manual and build encounters based on CR rules
players handbook
and some of it is essential
so a lot of the phb is fucking useless
targeted advice is way better than just "good DM"
Chris, I'd need to see what you're doing to offer improvements
I want to know the most fucked up thing
what in hell
***another*** one
you got
yeah same, sorry I missed you <@!138488296736030720>, ping me some time tomorrow and we can resume
you still around, I went afk for a bit
so pick a monster, any monster
oh noice
so I can use examples
download the monster manual before we continue
round starting, sec
next you gotta compare that number to the AC of the gobo. Ties can hit or miss, depending on the DM but be consistent
Then, have him roll a d20 and add the bonus
Second step, find out what bonus he gets to attack
Gobo.
Alright, first step is to figure out what his target is.
starting at initiative and ending at... somewhere
we can go over how to *actually run an encounter* at some point too
this'll help with your encounter *design*
grab the two files I posted too
<@!138488296736030720> http://slyflourish.com/5e_encounter_building.html
hence diablo 3
But I agree with that last sentiment
girls frontline
GFL maintenance
oh would you look at that
sometimes diablo 3
my catharsis game is minecraft though
I have yet to play stardew
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
it's from her tie in AXZ, I love those outfits
how do you like the color by the by
it's gotta be ESP or something
how did I know that the next time I saw you you'd be pastel purple
but what if I need them later
yeah I have 139
finding out which one in 4:30:00
oooh, 4* rifle I haven't seen yet
you infected my game too
***I wanted NTW***
I got a 416 *while rolling rifles*
Chris, what did you do to me
crypt of the necrodancer is 3 dollars
OH SHIT

is G-beat involved

I'm interested in SR:R entirely because of two voice actors
I'm well aware
jus sayin
`Shining Resonance Refrain launches on PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC July 10.`
Wien, I agree with you, I was making a joke
yeah same
I mean, also ffxiv and dark souls 2 which are *technically* JRPGs because they're RPGs made in Japan <:MariaKappa:396363198347083786>
that's what I've heard 98
and that's about as far as my JRPGs go
I've completed like maybe 10% of ffxiii?
like a chorus of angels, you are
Is TitS the name of the game because I'm not sure I believe you
Oh wow
PS2?
I'm gonna say...
As much as I hate RNG I sure deal with it a lot don't I
<:KirikaTongue:254795641937592321>
*and* Overwatch, *and* I was playing siege earlier
SEE <@!263983345669505025> I PLAY REAL GAMES TOO
I should install battle.net again <:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
game's not near as fun without it
cool
oh, do you have reaper of souls or no?
I'm fairly sure my DH is named Yukine but it's been so long
I never go super hard, I just play whatever DH or wizard build looks fun
next time a season rolls around we should play D3
I reblogged a fuckload of them
there are sooooo many more

and it unlocked some time recently
So todd Howard's wiki page was blocked for a few years
Yup
the Wikipedia stuff
Oh did any of y'all pay attention to the todd howard shenanigans a couple weeks ago
I'd rather not
I bought skyrim on release and still haven't finished it
SUFFERING <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
If I don't love the characters I have a hard time getting involved
Oh same

Why not both at once tho

uhm
I've been meaning to livepost something *not a giant meme*
Oh that's a great idea actually
If I don't get a summer job it'll be a lil tight
*If I enjoy it and also get a summer job*
I mean yes definitely
so we'll see
I buy games I enjoy
I'm probably late to this but I just found this channel and it's wonderful https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhh0igzqtqY
Tsubasa, specifically
so that's a thing on my hard drive now
also I downloaded TitS
I don't think I have enough ammo

those are always interesting
what's the genre
I've never heard of it
you can choose to fail any save
I'm adding this rule to my next campaign
"Every time you summon something, roll intelligence to remember that things other then Danny DeVito exist. If you fail, you summon Danny Devito, much to his great annoyance."
Oooh I've seen those
fishgun?
cool looking firearm too, that certainly helps
F2k is pretty rad
that's the one
at least one of them uses a tac rail as their garters

I will take her off your hands

I feel so lost in TCG talk.
or at the very least, continue
let's finish that tonight, shall we
but yknow this Phuckers in the Woods video has been sitting in my browser for a few days
you want me to <#407060923078017026> the hell out of it, I can deliver
(back on topic like a boss. *Score.*)
I don't *think* I'm doing anything else
anyway, I'll probably be playing TitS tomorrow
but yeah, first time I saw her I was speechless
and ***THREE TO GO EVEN FURTHER BEYOND***
**two for bold**

it's ***SHE***

>inb4 Kerrik says to just not play gachas
we're all in the same boat, good things are good!
I love it when people in loot box games don't get salty over other people's good luck, my buddy didn't tell me he got the Vector like 4 days ago cos he thought I was gonna be an ass about it
been trying all week for a Kayano rifle

it's fine <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I won't get mad at it happening but that's why I removed
that one's not allowed outside spoiler channels because obvious
it's like a Kirichan treasure hunt
feel free to ask around
I'm probably forgetting a few public knowledge ones
<@431656503490117632>
that last one is you pinging her like thus
```
CAPE!
genocide?
rekt
lewd
mariablush
<@431656503490117632>
```
so there's some that I'm keeping `secret` but quite a few are public
so please don't
but fun things are fun
b) I'll have to take away fun things
a) a stern talking to
If Kirichan gets abused, two things will happen
Oh I was lagging

Yup, here she is.

my AR squad runs STG44
I would have preferred that one but Kar98 is Good‚Ñ¢ too
I mostly wanted her because Kayano Ai <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Kar96, Thompson, Vector

Awakening was my first FE game so
I didn't bother with Tiki, but Nowi is definitely in my top 3 Fire Emblem characters
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I remember rerolling my account for three days to get halloween Nowi and I haven't touched it since
was FEH worldwide simultaneous?
Yeah, it's a bit of an issue
Are the ENG events hella behind the JP ones like every other mobage
inb4 symphogear DLC
that's bullshit
so wait they're in story mode
yes but if you start with 50, and take off 10, that's 20% off
20%, but yes
do we have enough interest for me to DM some kind of tabletop rpg for folks?
which reminds me
Skullgirls is the only reason I have a fight stick
dess_roll 1d20
I screenshotted it for my m8s
nice 69 alice
my players bought a mining town once
I love the RP stuff
my previous campaigns could go 3-5 sessions without combat sometimes
pff, I love remuz but yeah it loads like ass
but if we gotta go established it's gonna be one of those
I'm not pushing for D&D either, I'd prefer it if we found a new thing
oh I could houserule the fuck outta any system we choose to make it less complicated
and yeah, I'm always down to try new stuff
you've had DMs that like board games more than role playing then, the system is only as restrictive as the DM lets it
previous experience absolutely not required
And it's either gonna be D&D 5E, D&D 3.5, pathfinder, or some miscellaneous anime-friendly one, no 4E bs
I will say I'm gonna limit it to 5 players because anything more and it starts to get ***really slow***
the way I run my campaigns tends to be friendly for that sort of thing
that's the best part about being the DM. everyone else has to bow down to your schedule because there ain't no game without you <:MariaKappa:396363198347083786>
after we figure out who's actually in the game group
that's a question for when2meet
D&D is now selectable via Kirichan, pick up your character sheets in <#448237561085952001>
Done
Alice is the cap
alice I made you a kiri command
O Captain my captain, lighthouse in the storm, please be our guiding star
we can start talking about that now
if we have 4 people, and they're mostly around
no takebacks
do you want your nickname to officially change from Boss to Captain
*wait shit. Boss powers vs DM powers.*
if you give me the lore, everything is good
I *probably* won't let you be a moth unless you can give me a good reason for the existence of moth-people
it works surprisingly well
the character sheets are *super* handy
maybe we'll need roll20, maybe not
it depends on which system we use
not gonna edit, that typo stays
it gives us *character shets*
and how much of the rules we wanna use
depends on the system
we got a lot of good use out of the dynamic lighting stuff
but yeah I'm pretty sure my roll20 sub is still active whoops
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>

again, you can communicate in text, just be listening.
I've tried text based, I don't like it
you can mic in if you want, but at least listen
and I'll be asking everyone to join voice just to listen to me, no mic required
has everyone who's interested voted? ending poll in like 1 minute
if you dont care you're fine to abstain

geez alice, how come your discord has *two* dragons
oh two dragons
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
wow, shirabe just wants to help and you mute her
üëÄ <#449274763815157760> üëÄ
it's on the sub
I didn't shitpost ***here*** you dolt
you forgot the !!
I make shitposts, and procrastinate my shitposting via discord when I'm not playing games
<:CarolDone:432442665267888128>
no getting off the boat, not allowed
re a boat now
we'
I already called Nemui's Best Friend‚Ñ¢
so R and I are crew members
exactly
you want us all calling her that
what's lyssa's title even
but I wanna say ***MJOLNIR DATTO?***
I'll re-add
let me know after the change
nope you're good
Yeah probably
if we do MaidRPG we're definitely doing 
Master: Commander
Maid: Geah
Mansion: Submarine
it really is
Things you probably won‚Äôt need

Shame:
 Feeling shameful about pretending to be a Maid? 
That kind of defeats the purpose.

A maid costume:
 Not that you can‚Äôt, but it‚Äôs not neces-
sary  to  play. And  it  might  be  a  little  creepy.  Imagination 
and all that. If you look cute in one, feel free to send us 
pictures.
<:MichaHee:260224421476696064>
Commander and Geahs
yeah definitely
"So, finally, let‚Äôs explain Maid RPG itself. Put simply, in this game 
the GM is the ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù and the players take on the role of his 
maids. If you think this isn‚Äôt the kind of game you‚Äôd like to play, 
you‚Äôre probably right."
OVA, yes probably
never played 4E since then because it's super simple
my first ever D&D game was 4E which was great because it's super simple
yeah pathfinder is probably not a good first
I'm definitely down to handhold for the first few sessions until you get your sea legs
please do
I'll bring it back when we get finalists
dess_pollend
never actually played it
OVA is fun to make characters in, rolling is hella easy iirc
for when you decide
it's just availabel
no time limit on this one
pi is not a choice
dess_poll Anime bullshit?;maidRPG;OVA;keep deliberating
that sounds good to me
I've made characters in it, it's d6 I think
we have a couple suggestions, maidRPG is one, big eyes small mouth, and OVA
exactly
Anime bullshit wins, I was one of the pathfinder votes and I'm 100% ok with this
dess_pollend
has everyone voted btw
<:MariaKappa:396363198347083786>
and we'll even get visits from some big-shots if I'm feeling really adventurous with my RP skills
very much so
Any issues with that?
So if we're doing Anime Bullshit, just so everyone's aware of the premise I'm thinking of: The PCs are operatives for the S.O.N.G. B-squad, handling small-time bad guys that aren't worth the main 6's time.
not "we're currently deliberating such-and-such" <:KirikaTongue:254795641937592321>
he wanted TL;DR
everyone's gonna be my maid
according to the TL notes the original was like 32 pages or something
if you want combat and it's stupid easy you may not be satisfied
but its a matter of how complicated the combat is
well yes
no, that's not a "it's gotta be one or the other"
it's unanimous (kinda)
dess_pollend
Alice did you try to vote twice
has everyone who wanted to voted
dess_poll Focus?;Combat;Roleplay;Either/Don't Care
actually how about this
maid looks super fascinating to me
I briefly looked a tthat once
Oh yeah magical burst
and a normal-ass Normal McNormalgirl with a magic gauntlet given to her by her adoped uncle Genjuro
so Elf9's experimental autoscorer using Aegis
basically, if it can reasonably be used to fight alcanoise you're gucci
robo is fine
but you still have to be able to do stuff, otherwise why would they have you on the team
yes goofy B-team
if you have a good reason to not need one
uh
i mean this universe is gonna be canon-adjacent at best anyway
if you can make that fit, by all means
everything else is basically fair game
only "based on" insofar as there's Symphogears and Alchemists, and you're working for the UN
within reason, of course
the rule on "stupid shit" is as follows: if you're not purposefully meta-gaming to break everything, and genuinely just want to enjoy yourself, it's allowed
hmm, that'd be either a -0 or a -a billion and you'd be permanently depressed
iirc
if you take that as a weakness you mean that you're basically inoperable in their presence and will drop everything to protect them
üá´
for OVA?
yup, but you gotta take a minus somewhere else
I'm split between Maid and OVA but if we have at least one person interested in the fightin' we should probably do OVA
<@!99158582326497280> that depends on the system. heavily.
oh my god can you post one
Weapons from vidya are definitely allowed
Oh by all means
Back in my day, when the noise were noise and men had hair on their chest
complete with a phase shift inhibitor as a legacy from back when the noise were noise and not alchanoise
`phonic gain capacitor`
oh I like that
are you spitballing names?
so she herself is kind of frail but she's got a big-ass shield to hide behind
she had to build a relic into it to make it start up at all
that's perfect
oh yeah because they're inspired by their creator's psyches
I like participating in the character creation process, but you don't have to use what I say
just an idea, you don't have to listen to me
yeah, she tried to make one that doesn't wanna end the world and ended up making one with some kind of issue, either emotional or physical or both
all good ideas
axe would be cool
I forgot that existed
oh ***the*** Parashu
a regular battleaxe
isn't that just
Tyrfing is cool
we can workshop missions and stuff R, I'd like the process with someone to bounce ideas off of
gauntlet is a-ok
i have no idea and it doesn't matter because this is ***my universe***
familial relationship is joke btw
power limits...
Alcanoise is what you're recruited for
Although, this was stated before but reminder: you can definitely take strengths/weaknesses that aren't in the book if we talk about it first
that sounds hella fun as a DM
can *someone* please take dimensional pocket though
in XDU her IGNITE is laser punch
And only the once I think
She only had them in XDrive mode
it's 18MB, my limit is 50
Not with Nitro <:MariaKappa:396363198347083786>
I'll getcha soon as I'm done dl-ing a local copy
if I missed anything lemme know
file -> make copy
also example attacks at the bottom
here's a character sheet with a few headers, and a picture of shirabe https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ql9k3_OXG2CIblDz0Zr4dEKo3KrXciw58nrhIn3qjQo/edit?usp=sharing
people can mute the channel (like I'm sure they do anyway)
<:ikkib:235621294920433664>
yea we had the same idea
that hides discussion that others may or may not be interest in
?
maybe a tabletop channel only visible to members of the Tabletop group
until they fall over
just keep charging at people
`I don't`
`who knows`
`that may or may not be a joke`
anyone who uses a scythe or ranged projectile weapons gets a +1 on all combat rolls
dark souls weapons are pretty nuts
there's the bonefist from dark souls
seems your style, right?
alright, never made it out of prototype because it really fucks with your libido
this works for me
***SAKIVERSE***
Keyblade? Hey, whatever works
you wanna have the Buster Sword? Fuck yeah.
go get game then, captain an airship and i'll do the engine-ing
<@!127644949884698624> wanna captain an airship?
oh damn and it's a team pvp
I mean like, what genre? looks like a hack n slash from the vid
what kind of game is this even
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
I'm probably going to play more TitS tomorrow, if I wake up early enough you'll even get it first hand!

<#449826367903629313>
"No it's fine, just make a probie squad. They'll do great!"
So this is turning into a "Genjuro we don't have the budget or the space to have all these new recruits, stop it"
and if that ends up being too restrictive I'll consider raising it, but it should be fine
it's super rare for someone to have zero weaknesses so you'll definitely have more than just 4 points
so you start with 4 points, and taking weaknesses increases the number of points
you're gonna have a lot of points for pluses damn
that's cool
You can take Jealousy -1 (effective as 2) though
you just wear a glove, so no
Hmm...
if you're not a gear user, no dice
Transformation+1 if you're a gear user for free, if you want to take it to +3 be my guest and it won't count to your +3 limit
kept to herself, kinda rude.
you knew her mostly when she was in her Linkin Park phase
so you'll get upgrades yeh
I'll be doing progression
you can have one, maybe two level 3 abilities, and a total score of no more than +4
did you grind for *another* G17
lemme log in and send that
maybe, I can't remember
on gfl

anyone else who happens to have GW2 you're welcome to join us

hence the profile pic
Chris got like 5 416s in a single day
(as is NTW but I still don't have her <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>)
and Kar98 is voiced by <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But Vector is my fav out of everyone
I don't either
Kerrik gave me his untapped gacha luck
After my 3 5*s in a row I believe too
what's the bet on Grizzly vs IDW da nyaaaaaa
I just got a 1:10:00 timer
I think sparkle did 130+?
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>

jumping is hella weird
Sometimes the movement is pretty jank

I WANTED IT FOR MY PROFILE
I did my time
don't fucking talk to me about DSII

LOOK AT ALL THE GAMES
LOOK
I PLAY GAMES


Oh one of my high school friends was *obsessed* with Chrono Trigger, I got so sick of it
Yeah, never played Bioshock. I've heard good things but never got around to it
I have a joystick/throttle and everything
rinse and repeat
so I binge again
and then I come back and a bunch of new stuff is around
and then I don't play it for months
Elite is great for binges
Also yes SORRY I'M KEEPING THE CHANNEL NAMES MEANINGFUL
Have you played Elite: Dangerous?
for real tho I've never played a bioshock game
I love her.

God, I *really* want to be able to play Beat Saber
yeah
SOP II is the best story raifu
according to subreddit
apparently they can
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
saki thinks sparkle is insane
Shulk, I played a lot of shulk
I played Robin, Greninja and... uh....
even if it's new
I'll find someone I enjoy
I've learned to stop worrying about the roster
*crosses fingers for Smash to not suck*
I don't pay attention to PokeNews‚Ñ¢
ah, ok
wasn't there something about Pokemon GO mechanics
hopefully
Smash is gonna be dope
`please`
***SYMPHOGEAR MUSOU FOR THE SWITCH***
I think just Nowi is missing
Most of my favs are in FEW
very cathartic
Fire Emblem Warriors is *SUPER FUN*
I have BotW but I hardly play it
Same WFC
Xenoblade 2: dope a f
Enter the Gungeon: Switch release.
Shining Resonance Refrain is getting a switch version <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
every time a game comes out I check if it's got a switch version
I fucking love my Switch
that was weird
yknow I had to explain the "can it run crysis" meme to someone
Can it run Crysis tho
(switch notwithstanding)
I'm surprised there's no mobile Skyrim
```
Robin stays
Corrin stays
Nowi added
```
Any of these would make me very happy
oh man if Nowi exists I'm never playing anyone else
with Maria as DLC
watch, there's gonna be a surprise Bikki on the roster
clusterfuck smash is the best
I never owned a Wii U
I have smash 3DS
lights are my jam
I hate heavies, so much
damn you like heavies
If I had to pick one I'd definitely pick Robin
gnight folks
i'm going to bed
alright well it's been fun and we definitely need to organize some smash 5 stuff but
ish?
Mewtwo is kinda iconic?
Yeah Lucario is a lil old news
That must be hard on the psyche
Oh yeah, you play both don't you
as a crew member I'm contractually obligated to use her preferred title
her current moniker of choice
As opposed to Captain
I'll be rolling for M99, Type 95, G36C in that order
All will be getting rate-ups after maint for the next day or so
Type 97
Type 95

I like long hair + bangs <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
Except when it's a Bethesda RPG
Okay normally when a game gets a switch release I'm all about that
New IP Hallway?
Maybe even Elder Scrolls Hallway
Fallout Hallway
The next Bethesda RPG is gonna be FF XIII style, calling it now
It's Bethesda. Don't get your hopes up
"announce"
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
And there's my NTW!
That was fast
Damn, already got one of the Type-9Xs
ok never mind, not interested anymore
fuck yeah smash
I ain't no slave to Nintendo but fuck me, that's an ***EEVEE IN A GODDAMN HAT***
"Oh you like Pikachu? Name three of their albums"
those people are entitled to their opinion
some people are pikafans
it was *fantastic*
In Y I bred a full squad of perfect IV eeveelutions
Sen IV?
`Gateway drug`
battle frontier required ev/iv bullshit?
that's all that matters here
I wanna run around with an eevee on my head
exactly
>implying pokemon hasn't been easy since gen 1
I actually really like the pokeball throw mechanic thingamabob
if playing Go is mandatory for progression, then yeah this is bullshit, but to me it seemed like a very optional thing. granted, we didn't see much, but still
Sauce?
which is neat
unless you mean the pokeball throwing
The Go mechanics looked super optional
I haven't played a mainline pokemon game in years so
y'all can hate but I'm getting Eevee and nobody can stop me
I might actually die
FUCKIN EEVEE DRESS UP WITH THE BASEBALL HAT

FFXIV IS ***CANCELLED***
I GET THIS

THAT'S IT
I'M DONE

oh lordy
pokeminecraft?
quest?
it's definitely a joke but some people are definitely gonna get an aneurism
kanto only would be shooting themselves in the foot imo
this game itself isn't supposed to be a huge success, it's meant to make the next one an even bigger success
can you livestream eating 10 hats
how many hats do you have
I expect an uplift in Go participation over the summer
like if they advertise it right they've just doubled their potential purchasers for the mainline
that's good bridging, damn
wait so if you aren't fighting wild pokemon do you really just walk up and throw pokeballs like GO?
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
it ain't for us, it's for the `filthy fucking casuals`
but now it's like "duh"
I was pretty sure before tbh
yeah pretty sure R hit it right on the money
I tried splatoon, not for me
I don't do shooters with analogue sticks
except I have a switch now
same
holla
if you're PC I'll download it right now
Lily, on PC or console?
does anyone have battlefield 3 or 4 for PC
"100 headshots for gold camo"
I miss those
Tracer tho
but a lot of people really like her
Thompson is definitely not my aesthetic
the 97 is alright, but 95 is more my aesthetic
I wanted the 95, and I got the 95
Raifus




she's wonderful. new adjutant
I got her earlier too
burned through like 50 today
I'm glad I've been saving up quick prod contracts
please get out of my game
Chris I got another 416
"DID YOU CRY DURING LION KING?"
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i'm going to bed
in other words
I also might retire for the night
gnight!
I got my name from the G OVA scene where Ogawa is testing her for the quiz show
but I've never seen it written
Basa says "sakimori" a bunch
(does coding go here? idk)
Writing Shirabe has been super fun btw
Thanks for the confirmation
lit transation: Guard, Watchman, Sentinel
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Sakimori
machine translation says yes, but I want to check with a person
Oh, dragon does this say what I think it says: Èò≤‰∫∫
TL note: Zapato is spanish for shoe
god. I think it was Zapato
oh damn, mine was....
Shirabe, are you alive?
I was surprised when it wasn't
Normally Sakimorii is available
extra i because it was taken already <:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
<@106866895076003840> I'm Sakiimori on Origin
We play tomorrow, Lily <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

"Why you hef to be mad? Is only game."
I prevent tilting by remembering the words of the Zen Master:
I love me some PvP if the game is designed for it
<:MikuPout:271482281229680642>
I usually prefer multiplayer games, singleplayer is hard to get me interested in
i thought they were joking about fallout 76 but no that's the actual announcement thingo
that's the actual thing
oh you weren't meming about fallout 76
and it's not even available on the JP server yet, that looks like one of the anniversary costumes coming soon?
oh that's UMP9 not 45
lemme check real quick
no, that outfit is in the current gacha, I *think*
looks like UMP45 in an outfit
probably for the best
this rebalance ain;t workin
i ended up rebinding to be more like seege
and we were on the wrooooong side
yeah
gonna take a mo for loadout at the start of this one
i'm definitely more effective with the LMG than I am with the sniper
we didn't do too bad that round
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>

suddenly I can't aim
got me some dog tags
its been waaaaaay too long
had no idea how it worked rofl
I tried to res you with your own kit
I did get two 400m headshots which was nicew

why bother doing a squad join feature if it's gonna drop us on different teams rofl
wanna find new serber?
chats goin crazy about a hacker

I haven't played this in literal years so
booting up BF4 now
I can run functions ***and*** pass arguments via a fuckin JSON file
I have never been so happy to see `test` in a console as I am at this moment

I want to use as few `if`s as possible
give me a few though
Ah alright then, I'll just keep jamming, text is aight
it'll let me do some ***fun*** things tomorrow
but
it's all backend stuff
Awesome, let me finish implementing this thing in my Shirabe test build. VoIP or naw?
*don't quote me on that, I think it's what's going on though*

Welrod, specifically
finally getting a 5* pistol
it's a subtle difference
this is a `gun who is also an anime girl`

no, see

maybe I *can't* stream this
huh, another crash
but that's not the case
normally I don't have it on because folks in discord are listening and it gets weird
troo
I'll turn my mic on too if you want
what is with my pc and games crashing
I think my game crashed
I'm streaming Steep for a lil bit, chill time

because he doesn't gacha
he's got a ton of extra luck
Ask <@263983345669505025>, I managed to pull three new 5* guns in two hours
so it wasn't a total wash
But you initiated a fascinating discussion on the cultural differences of fish n chips
everything in one bag for maximum easy
yeah that shop was for commuters so you were expected to eat on your way through the station/on the train
I got mine from a little underground shop next to Town Hall station in Sydney
tatare on the side in a lil cup
You got a brown paper bag with chips in the bottom and the fish + lemon slice on top, pre-drizzled in vinegar
Even at the togo places
The lemon was every time though
I didn't eat it much
In Straya most of the time they give you tartare iirc
That's my favorite part, how did I forget
Oh, I did forget the vinegar didn't I
delicious
served with tartare and a slice of lemon
fish and chips tho
***fiiiiish***
***fish***
<a:oof:447819226795999233>

I wanna mod it so it says DESS like I did with Dark Souls
I love how you can import your own music, and the beat matching is actually competent
Crypt of the Necrodancer is dope
thanks for relocating <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
it's fine
your conversation was meandering
Lost interest though, idk why
I used to play
I've been told I would really like Futaba
this is complex
No wonder I forgot how to play
this is a wiki right
probably, yeah
fuckin zeroes
200
¬•2000 is like $20
>cheapest tables priced around ¬•2000, or roughly $2000 or so.
none of this dice cop-out
when I played we always did the wind draws for dealer
how does that help though
so that's why
>1-sou tile which is marked with a large bird instead of 1-stick to discourage cheating by tile alteration.
I must have learned a variation
oh the flower and seasons aren't used
lol this is on the Saki wiki
I'm well aware, it was joke

<:KirikaTongue:254795641937592321>
I am not an anime!
I have not been watching myself, no
Oh dragon I was gonna re-learn mahjong so we could play
that's the page I'm on
http://saki.wikia.com/wiki/Riichi_mahjong
so a meld is either a run of 3, or a 3 of a kind?
<@!231025503643893770> Nice, I got my Type-95 on release day during the rate-up event

I mean, I do have the best color on the server
`how much I enjoy Saki` would be a little odd in this context
I like how everyone has to format when they say "Saki" the anime
it's super fun
oh that's weird
is there no mAIjong
my food has arrived, give me a few
you definitely should
now now, be reasonable

mahjong is two things
that's a lot of red
lose something dear
progress pics, I wanna see this as it devolves into hell
<@138131889142628352> I'm gucci for mahjong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlx6mojjcYo
apparently Bikki is broken OP
She sounds different from what I remember of S1
Is that Ayahi? she sounds a little off, but I might be going a lil crazy
Oh, really?
maybe
I think that's the "one other game that his Bikki in it" I was talking about
Oh yeah, forgot about that
so... XDU and maybe that one other game that has Bikki in it?
any time, really
I managed to get my chap 6 logi unlocked and I've been spamming 4-3E for levels
Oh damn, good luck
I keep a team on auto 1-2 normal for enhancement stuff
level 20-30 so not super high stats but they have the equip to actually hit stuff so <:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
Half the time when I call a night support it's a day team and they get destroyed
My night team support is actually pretty nice, just a heads up <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I just want to unlock equipment calibration <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
finally doing the nighttime missions in GFL
daijobu
Devolver hoping for AG&D
I think <@449062815534153748>  might actually make more sense than this
clearly she's a ghost
>oo
Very sentimental, plus Blue Hair‚Ñ¢ is aesthetic a f
It was my absolute favorite gun back in MW2 days
I honestly thought the TAR wasn't in EN yet



<a:BeefStroganoff:393778449862492164>
<a:BeefStroganoff:393778449862492164>
such a good song
Hearing that guitar riff now
<@106866895076003840> I can calibrate my equipment now, finally
***buttons***
But I'm gonna chill for a bit when I do
I'll be home around then as well
Whazzat

my fav MGs so far are 2* <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
I'm gonna get my ARs to 90+ and then corpse drag some MG's through 4-3e
you get them by just earning XP on other guns. some of it goes into a pool, and you can use that pooled XP to craft the reports
you give them to guns and they get instant XP
GFL has these "combat reports"
<@106866895076003840> BAR is in logi because I don't have a MG team yet
these aren't "daily" or anything, they just can run over and over
nope
it's probably similar
but it takes a while
they go out and, instead of spending resources, gather them
I don't show them off ever but they're an important part of the unit
and 4
3
2
Logi team 1
1200 PDT
've got an appointment
and then I
I've got to get a haircut before Rebellion
I do need to be up and about by 1000
yeah only 0030
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
it's liberating
nothing huge but I love having 8 slots
I've spent about $15
I should probably get a 9th slot and move her to my night squad
It was quite the dilemma
But I can't use anything but the Vector as my main OT now that I have her
My Skorpion is taking an extended break because I don't have the heart to put her into logistics
Aw yeah I hate doing that <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I want at least 4 for my combat squads
they do so much for me
I should probably set one of my logi squads as echelon 1 one of these days
Used to be AR but they got enough visitors
I've got mine set to my rifle squad
Yesterday my dorm was *packed*
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
ticks all the boxes
I can't *not* have her set
I'm sure you've noticed my NTW and her <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
She's quality
checked my dorm but she ain't there
Who's your current adjutant anyway?
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
(the correct answer is yes)
NTW or TAR-21?
Second only to pink, but I've already got NTW <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
She's probably gonna be one of my MGs when I get around to making that team
yeee
or is that the other one
BAR is voiced by <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> right?
Yeah I've got a big list
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
So that's your checked boxes list eh
are you gonna OATH anyone, Lily?
perfect
she is
Pink hair
Smol hat
Big gun
Short skirt
Voiced by <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

didn't even have to think about it
<@138131889142628352> NTW, no question
Micro Uzi is awful but I love her too
OATH lets you marry them for stat boost
yup
Happy guns = Happy saki
I just got 2 echelon and 2 dorm slots
So many raifus
Screw it, I'm getting the last two slots
I won't be able to sleep if she's wallowing
Spectre definitely needs to stay on active duty
they're both around 65
Maybe I'll use her and Skorpion for a night squad actually
She was my first adjutant
Spectre has been with me since Day 1
think I could get away with using SAA as main tank, M1911 as OT, and putting NTW in the backline with the other 2?
both HGs have higher EVA than Spectre, and I don't want to swap out either of the current RFs
So with my RF team:
I'd like a second opinion
Hmm...
especially considering they still don't display unlock requirements outside that mail
but like, low priority
confirmed as bug
it's a bug for everyone I'm pretty sure
yeah
Is her sprite super low res
and M4A1 is 
```
1) my aesthetic
2) super useful
3) my aesthetic
```
SOP II is one of my fav guns so I didn't want to stop using her
(because of course I use the <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> AR)
STG44 had a couple though
I use SOP II and M4A1 so dupes weren't really an option
18 cores per 4\* is **killer**
my AR's are all through that point now though so I can start being a little more generous with them
and I'm being really cautious because I was approaching level 70
Yeah
going into that I had like 7
I didn't exactly waste mine, but I spread really thin
I feel like I keep bouncing between 60+ and 3
oh, how many cores do you have
yeah that one's pretty great
I need more combat reports <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
NTW isn't actually in any of my active squads right now though

looks exactly the same except no XP

Night Lily, and Dragon, and anyone else <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
I'm going to bed
I think
Alright well, with that

<:KiriCheer:442974585529434113>
1800 points get, I guess
I didn't realize I was that close
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>

I remember when I thought a 6k enemy was ridiculously difficult
dipped out of mission to start the craft real quick
hopefully
I think I caught it pretty quickly
<:KiriWhoops:442974593498611732>
my surplus XP is capped
whoops
I'm even more in love now
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
NTW goes prone in combat
oh dear lord
good call
yup

<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
wow yeah
also a bit of a prankster
she's a cutie
ye
she's gonna replace 1911 asap
she'd be great for a RF squad
ROF buff in the corners
but she needs to be MT
I want to use her in a real squad
are gonna be autolevelling
and 4
Squad 3
New Squad 2

SV-98 as well
but TAR-21 doe
the BAR is pretty sleek looking irl, yeah
what do you two normally play anywho
i'm pretty decent at siege
I'm usually decidedly average
got a hella fly flank around with the stairs
My friend was playing echo and got me a 3k on Mira by calling out pushes
but that yacht match I kicked some ass
normally I'm just aight
feelsgoodman
Just clutched a 1v4 as Doc in siege
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
post in <#336299268107403274> so I can action it
that's actually not a bad idea

so I'll be home at around 7:45 probably
I work from 5-7 PDT tonight
continue
no
I have no idea what's going on
***trading card game words***
his deck composition is really bottom heavy, didn't get a two drop so they lost board control
`trading card games`

did you see that ludicrous top-deck last night
move to <#357682999300718592> ?
even though some people don't appreciate it <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I'm still proud of <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580> vs <:BikiShock:447891354278821888>
now here I am doing cutouts in under a minute and color-correcting pictures taken at sunrise
Started with a crop here, maybe a little brightening
I've used it for years but only started using the "advanced" features about a year ago
I know my way around GIMP so much I don't think I could use anything else
What do you use?
pulled them off their ties in AXZ, changed em a bit to make them look decent, and then got the HTML from that boxsu
I used it to set all the Geah colors we currently use on the server
I love the HTML box, it's super handy

I use GIMP for all my shenanigans
fun fact, her gun is actually a shade of red
I made that gif from scratch, hence the delay
Too detailed for emoji, but that's the next best thing
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
please assist
is that acceptable
I grabbed the brown from her gun
She's runnin
okay, what color do you want the bar on the side to be, and what do you want the command to be
yeah, I wish it was a lil better but <:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
got it from the sub
not my gif, unfortunately
deal with it
okay here's the BAR one
I'll make a BAR one while you think
what pose, and what do you want her to say
these work anywhere that <@431656503490117632> exists
While I'm doing these, want an M14 one too?
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
pew
give me a moment
wait, Kirichan exists.
she's gorgeous
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I don't think this'd work as an emoji but

I only have 4 left <:MioHMyGod:454554161028005890>
but for now I'm gonna need that slot for something else probably
I'll keep the M14 on my hard drive in case you get it
all these and more could be yours
<:YuiScare:442105076933459979> <:photomiku:442959133919019008> <:GarieSmile:432431646717902849> <:BlueMadoka:454043800998772736> <:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914> <:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
lemme know
If you ever get nitro
Not up to my usual standards, but you're the M14 expert
<:M14Chibi:454558707079184384>
`I FORGOT THE CHIBIS`
`wait the CHIBIS`
got any other guns I should try
NTW was actually unworkable
that's the best I got
<:M14:454557383059046422>
I tried so hard
Neither NTW nor M14 makes very good emoji
<@106866895076003840> I have bad news
usually multiplayer games tho
I bounce around between a lot of stuff
are you willing to risk that
Maria's disapproval though

Probably
<a:oof:447819226795999233>
Dayum
pew
Worth?
I dont have any 5* MGs yet, congrats
Role added <@269526749249929227>
<:MioHMyGod:454554161028005890>
I used to, back on Dueling Network
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
>devolver
>not AG&D
Everyone's gotta take their turn
Oh right
I heard something about that
Did Ubi say anything about STEEP
***AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE***
that's incredible
not like it could make any less sense
DS2 world remix would be interesting
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
Fun
guns > boats
I dont know what either of those are
so what exactly did EA announce
you don't sound too excited
this is fascinating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6JoyTIhyl8
oh, I finally found my mahjong set
I believe in you
rekt
better than last
Is skyrim mobile happening
someone should mod that
<:gibe:332720112056532995> MUSOUGEAH
`why does Japan get nendos and we have shitty funkos`
what happened with funko pop by the way
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
why everyone gotta do mobile
Wasn't there an Elsweyr mod for Skyrim back in the day
someone ping me if they give a date for AG&D
Also shirabe is having shit luck in mahjong
>totally unregulated
*crickets*
who was surprised? Show of hands, put em up if you didn't expect this
no
that is nearly 250 THOUSAND digits long.
1.40 √ó 10^245938
that means it's factorial
considering the !
so
let's treat them as 5's
but S isn't a digit in hex <:wut:235243292965470208>
which was the one I was watching last night with the sacrifice things
G17 is Chris Alter
the runway markings are a nice touch
are they aircraft cariiers
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
no
boats are not quite as enticing
I'm a huge firearms nerd so I have a vested interest in GFL
I'
I *might*, not sure yet
She's only available as a drop from 1-6 and 1-4e
ALSO <@106866895076003840>
I DID THE THING
<@!137113218173632512>
already?
I've got a couple of them myself
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>

MMXVIII
I love roman numerals
oh that's pretty
no, that could very well be it
oh wait, the last five years are a thing
Why am I so cynical with AAA titles
hoping for the best, expecting the worst, and will enjoy myself either way
I'll be watching from the sidelines
good luck with that
three?
just
oh
did they announce Mega Sequel Final Mix Third Prequel Midnight Edition the Second
oh
who's Aqua and what's a nort
I'm disappointed he didn't walk out on stage wearing a groucho marx
"few weeks"
I got an AG&D release date update on the Gungeon subreddit though so that's nice
Dodd Boward, Leader of the Bebebsba Softworks
and I don't understand
But like okay, people are legitimately excited for TES VI, unironically and not just for memes
I will pats, after tabletop
and I'm just expecting it to be a shitshow
like imo Bethesda has shit the bed for so many years they've just lost all my respect
So I don't get why people are excited for TES VI
it's fun stuff
Eyyy 98, join us
damn straight
rekt
I just won a game of mahjong
oh god I don't wanna get destroyed
do we have anyone else
it actually exists
oh dear lord
I'm looking forward to the inevitable household objects waifu game
Gungeon such a good game
Nah they've been really good on policing nipples iirc
People might like it who knows
Eh, it's unpopular here but I haven't been paying attention to the wider stance
"We're taking your money and doing *absolutely no oversight* on what you're buying from us, isn't that great?"
"Well, now we're not even gonna do that!"
"Hey yknow how we only bother looking at games that we sell for money when people bitch about them enough?"
I'm in a Bad Mood about steam right now though so
True.
And the emoji system will never be as robust due to emoji being on the fucking marketplace for some reason
Yeah, discord has too much momentum and this doesn't even have parity yet
woo?
oh actually I've only ran 1-6 35 times
and then sparkle needed to get like 4 more of her
I got fairly lucky, and it was autobattle too
I think my counter was only at 80ish
5*s murder your cores
You should probably focus more on 2-4 stars for your first squad though
MP5 is a cutie
***IDW DA NYAAAAA~***
I've pulled her three times and I don't even like her <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
feel free to use
my friend support is dope a f
accepted
I'm 6834
we do GFL too
nah you're good here
oh yeah, Chris drew I think 6x 416's in 24 hours
WHAT IS THIS
Me and this rando *destroyed* pats and dragon

<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
there'd be no reason to ping the role other than "look what I just got"
we discussed that
I've been trying to get a 5* AR for *days* but noooooo I get my least favorite SMG
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
Wasn't even rolling SMGs
<:saki:332719481673482240>
which one is that
it's the emulator
oh
she sounds deeper than I remember
***Did they change Kalina's CV in GFL***
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
double riichi
You'll find Kar though, I believe in you
I'm somewhat uncultured
Both of them
I'm unfamiliar with her though <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
Never give up
I gave up on NTW and the next day she came to say hello
You'll get her eventually
Aw Sparkle <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
my raifu squad can cheese your way through most of the early stages if you play it right
<@138131889142628352> my friend code is 6834 by the way
I haven't seen anyone else I recognize
Aoi Yuuki voices the BAR, an MG
I have all three <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Kayano Ai is three of them
Every SMG, excludes handguns
and
Every handgun
The recipes I gave you are for:
Every individual gun has a certain requirement of resources that has to be met
When you go to craft a gun, you designate how much of each resource to spend
parts are used (in addition to manpower) for repairs.
Ammo and rations are both used as supplies for your squads inside missions
manpower is used to deploy your squads, and repair them after battle.
manpower, ammo, rations, parts.
So, you have 4 resources
Note that those are definitely not guarantees
Thompson recipe is best as 400/400/91/30
Colt recipe is best as 130manpower/130ammo/130ration/30parts
you get rare guns via Production which the game will teach you about
Thompson is a 5* SMG, Colt Revolver (known as SAA) is a 4* handgun
Oh, there's no need to reroll your account or anything so don't worry about it
lemme know how nox goes
I use bluestacks personally
even though TAR is only 4*
FiveSeven and TAR-21 too
WA2k
Vector, NTW, Kar98
I've honestly got most of my raifus already
`IDW DA NYAAAAA`
Some people *really* love cat.
`Everyone loves cat.`
IDW DA NYAA

are they gonna have a rate-up?
I believe in you
who drops there?
didn't realize I was that lucky
Astra is great
including your command center
how many squads on map + how many helipads you own
your AP per turn is
and also give you an extra AP
They let you resupply and call in extra squads
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
but she is not very good
she is very cute and I love her
I love the Uzi
it uses Cores and/or dupes
you get an extra chibi, more HP, more stats, more resource usage
you can add a Bonus Raifu‚Ñ¢
at levels 10/30/70/90
very very good SMG
Skorpion is fuckin A+
combat reports and affection gifts both count
you can give presents to your raifus in the Dorm
always and forever
like, it's horrendous
her squad formation bonus is unusable
it starts kicking your ass
like, chapter 2-3ish
AK47 is garbo, Micro-Uzi is garbo, but anyone else is "If you like the girl then use her"
some of those guns on the list aren't available in EN yet
which give you rolls on the bingo sheet
you can see your dailies
in *obtain more*
***RAIFU BINGO***
fairly decent at explaining though
yeah it's bouncy
dailies reset at 0100 our time
logistics, sry
contracts are from dailies and logi
two are enough for me tbh
as a %
it's 60/27/10/3
oh uh
so if it's available in prod, do it that way
it's an exercise in frustration to hope for a 3* or above drop
but you dump a buttload of mats and get a way better chance at rare guns
it's as yet unreleased in EN
thompson is 2hr30min
colt is 50 mins
https://en.gfwiki.com/wiki/T-Doll_Production
Might be, probably not
I don't think so
pew
I use NTW as my adjutant.
iirc
No, adjutants are specifically military
It's not a secretary, she's an *adjutant*.
tap name on the top
10 loss on the dead one, 5 loss on the rest of squad, no loss in boss battle or sim
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and the best emoji
dragon now has 2 likes
I like my 4-digit code
I usually get 6-10
I might not have any batteries for you
she's the tsunniest
I'm assuming sparkle means WA-2k?
I've rolled ARs for the past week too
I rolled nothing but RF for a week and a half
130/130/130/30 for HGs
get a couple good SMGs then roll ARs, then probably RF or HG
I don't like the *everything* recipe
400/400/91/30
probably the SMG one I sent earlier
hmm
so your dps in 1 should stay safe
8 and 5 are best for tank because melees hardly ever spawn on bottom row
the only reason that's not the best is because of how targeting works, but if it's working then by all means continue
then she goes in 4
so a HG, until you get M4A1
4 is buffer
1 and 7 are your DPS, use ARs early
early on, that's SMGs
you want tanks in 8 and 5
basically
there you go, good team for start
4 is HG
71 are ARs
85 are SMGs
is the grid
````
789
456
123 
```
so like
A+
it's been in like, 6 different garages across two countries and 3 states
but I cbf to fix right now
and honestly the scrabble bothers me too
that's really pretty
I'll sort it later, deal?
GuP <:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
it's actually been suggested for anime club
people keep asking me this
<a:SakiShock:454116812276105227>
you wanted pics of my mahjong set right
<@138131889142628352>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Kar98 is one of the DESS rifles
I think they're heavy production only
I still don't have one yet
little kawaii drones that help out
they do all the combat fairies too
Saru, yeah
good choice
oh she's new
standouts include NTW, Kar98, M14, WA2000, and SV-98
https://en.gfwiki.com/wiki/Category:RF_T-Dolls
that's an HG and an SMG <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
<:GarieSmile:432431646717902849>
dragon you should choose a RF raifu to fit in
we all love our RFs
Lily uses another RF for her adjutant
and you gotta have a special squad for it
new mechanics
night battle is
dorm -> auxiliary rooms -> data room
they're for the `DATA ROOM`
NTW Waifu status report

920, sorry
it ain't grizzly
if you used more than 930 total resource
**Everyone loves cat.**
`Everyone loves cat.`
she's one of my favorites
SOP II is level 80
focus on unlocking new chapters for the Logistics
1am
She's good, but not raifu material personally
My first 5* raifu in days and it's the FAL <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
I haven't yet but I'm workin on it
Yes, I'm going to sleep soon, gosh
I need to go sleep anyway, gotta get up early tomorrow
why did you even link this here <:wut:235243292965470208>

it's... eh.
"The illustration was cropped from an awkward looking futanari artwork"
<:JiiThreeSeconds:442974585650937856>
is there a pun I'm missing
at least raifu rhymes
is that what they're called
every time shirabe responds to your message that's a 5* raifu you could have received
it's actually 1% now
Even Shirabe has Thompson
is this jack
I'm glad I paid zero attention to it
Bonus Chibis‚Ñ¢
Yeah, I told you
Congratulations <:KiriApproval:453731003383676938>
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
That very well might be Tommy
I told you, it goes from "welcome, newbie" to "fuck off" really fast
The switch is a really neat concept and I want to support development for it
I'm always looking for more tbh
I've heard it's good
Oh hey, Golf Story is $5 off for the Switch too
this "best of Shirabe" list was a good idea
dess_.. Shirabe
like 80% off on Necrodancer, for instance
they'd better have some deep fuckin discounts for me to want to give them money
from what I've seen, it looks super fun
why sadly
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
Crypt of the Necrodancer is 80% off
<:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
oh, I've just been using gender-neutral for most people here so I guess it didn't parse that way
what's with the F by the way
probably
she has feelings
don't say that about your shield bot
*sigh*
but the SMG I wanna use is in a 5 hour logi mission
So I finally made an MG team
you're getting warmer
***HAT*** <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
keep trying, you'll know
you gotta find something that fits my A E S T H E T I C
still not 100%
but
the fox girls are pretty <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
keep em coming, not sold yet
maybe I will end up playing this when it gets the EN release...
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<:gsad:363949694100963338>
does it have any relation to yaku
I'm assuming hangyaku is rebellion
Someone has been rude to one of my girls <:ShirabeJii:237687217437278208>
I would never ask her to fuck off though
the rebellion begins here
`I paid zero attention to "fuck off"`
Weird
what genre are the games even
or are they unrelated
is neptunia the infamous nepnep
I want Shirabe to call someone a disparaging remark now
and was making a disparaging remark
I think Lat understood what you were saying
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
if you like Isaac you should try it out
The only game I've double dipped on was Enter the Gungeon
And saying something is like WoW is basically the fastest way to get me to lose all interest <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
which is a reasonable criticism
Except the authenticity thing
Sounds like AL took a premise and improved upon it more than anything else
No sprites?
same
two things with the same premise are not rip-offs of each other
So you're straight up saying there's no gameplay, and yet it's still a rip-off of a game that, at least from what I've heard, *does* have a game part?
but I *tolerate* XDU because it's symphogear
Like honestly if KC got localized I'd probably play it too
I'd rather have cute girls, readable text, and actual gameplay than kanji and authenticity
So they took the premise, but in a different direction?
But, AL is getting localized, and KC isn't.
if they're going through the effort of localizing, that counts for something
alright then, easy decision
Does KC have an english version
I dunno, I've heard mixed things about Kancolle but dragon's arguments are very compelling

that's definitely a Good Boat‚Ñ¢

Hmm, valid point but I disagree with the exact conclusion

You got a thing for blue pubes?
then that
If Rainbow 6 Siege in on steam
if you like hero shooters, it's best in class
I kinda like it, and it's still popular if that's what you're asking
It's been at nominal levels for several months now
I can't remember when it asked
i dont have akadora
then the fuckin seasons flowers
then ESWN

how are those supposed to be sorted
specifically the honors
how'd I do on the sorting
there's a decent chance these are ivory

I am simultaneously rooting for you, and concerned for your health
You are truly the most determined of us all
I'd rather we kept an air of (*at bare minimum*) civility, and let us mods take action if action is required.
so many dupes

true.
correction. I say I'm going to do 8 things, and proceed to do none of them because I'm awful
you're waiting on a lot of things <:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
so that's gotta count for something, right
I've platinum'd DS2 SotFS though
I've never been to blighttown because I've only played like an hour of dark souls
I have no idea what you mean, I've never been to blighttown
<:110:280839581409083392>

literally the only reason I want VR is Beat Saber
although that's rapidly changing
*cough* VR *cough*
Yeah just because the tech exists doesn't mean it's suitable for a commercial product
and yeah the 2ds is a cool compromise
I actually seem to recall something like that
<:gthink:364297870255587328>
then bust out the 3d tech when it was ready and cheap enough
to get people used to it
The 3ds is such an interesting concept, and I'm glad they tried double screen on its own first
I had an OG 3DS as well but gave it to a friend of mine (who no longer speaks to me, long fuckin story)
That one is a new 3ds xl (god I hate the names)
it was spooky
Oh. Yeah I made like three redundant backups
As long as you don't do anything dumb (connect online with a pirated/hacked game) it should be pretty a-ok
Did you CFW yours or just the homebrew launch every time?
There's probably other ways to do it, I don't keep up
my monster hunters are all legit
I still don't dare play pirated games online though
Yup. Audioplayer to do the initial install, then you use custom firmware to open a door and that lets you get system updates and everything
I'm pretty sure it replaces

Was a PITA to set up but definitely worth
custom firmware on 3ds was an excellent decision
Oh even better, I can play them on my actual hardware
What platforms are they on anyway
<:pirate_flag_emoji:350802274848604160>
Are they worth trying nowadays?
definitely had to shuffle around my top 5 after that
I only recently found out Yomi was Kayano Ai

<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Hardly the first try then, you've done it at least twice before!
Congrats!
*looks like it's time to roll handguns*
one problem: I don't have a Tokarev
Tokarev's waifu costume, to be precise
I finally got a costume from the furniture gacha <:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>

I love roguelikes and roguelike-adjacents
das a good one
high five <:BikkiHey:276033233500766208>
I'm a sucker for rhythm games though, even though I'm god awful at them most of the time
Beat Saber is one of those things, imo
but I'm waiting for the industry to actually do those things
I like the concept, and I think a lot of interesting things can be done with it
therefore, VR is definitely on the back burner
and I don't have enough space for Beat Saber
I usually hover between 60-70 but right now I'm at 90
That was also the day I got my NTW <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I got her in the rate-up event, it was nice
she's the blue one
95 is my preference between the two
45 can be my main tank for that one
I think I'm going to build another AR squad for the ARaifus that aren't story, because there are some damn good ones
So I'll probably run an HG in that spot
because they're MGs not ARs
Oh her formation wouldn't matter
If not, I'll be on the hunt for an offtank. Perhaps an HG of some description to √ºberbuff my top MG
I'm probably going to swap out STEN for UMP45... but I can't remember if 45 has a good offtank formation or not <:ShirabeThink:461322366010654730>
I'm a sucker for midriff and denim
Had a welrod from my last HG spree
I got Grizzly and m950 on accident trying for this Tokarev
I'm gonna keep rolling ARs after I get my Tokarev for a bit, then go back to SMGs methinks
I still haven't gotten her <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
raifu-ly speaking
She is, but there are so many good SMGs
Are her friends acceptable? I think STEN is temporary but I wanted to have at least one costume on my squads
<@106866895076003840> finally made an MG team by the way, I know you're interested in at least one of these guns <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312> but also <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
meanwhile I roll for a 3* HG for less than a day and get Grizzly AND THIS ONE
I spend a week rolling ARs and don't get anything but a single 4*
okay what the hell game
<@106866895076003840> <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>

props
let alone three
Damn, I'm having trouble with just XDU and GFL
which ones are you playing?
I've already got Negev, I went down to sub-20k ammo trying to get her but it was wurf
I'm not gonna quick prod
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
Grizzly or IDWdanyaaaaaa
I got a 1:10:00 timer with HG recipe
yeah the ad company they hired was super sketchy
*why can't I get my 45 minute timer* <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
speaking of production
I only have 263 quick prods
`the number just keeps going up`
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
but only a little bit
I actually kinda like the poppi minigame
WHERE ARE THEY
Where are all my legendaries when I roll ARs huh
I want a goddamn 3* and I've rolled three 5* in the process
I JUST WANT A TOKAREV
not only is it okay, I'd like to actively encourage it
I have no idea what she looks like, I avoided looking at any of the guns before I got them
She's a 45:00 and I keep getting 40:00 <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
I got her costume from the gacha
Tokarev
until then I'll keep drowning in M9's
One of these days I'll get the right fuckin 3*

I'd much rather some nuance get lost, but the work to gain the recognition it deserves, than for a literal translation that ends up languishing in "well that's just... too ***African*** for me."
I would absoluty love to agree with you, Dragon, but the world as it stands is too diverse and culturally complex for that to result in globally successful media.
A lot of times the intent is incredibly couched in cultural context that the target audience just *won't have*.
If you *translate* yamato nadeshiko you get "A japanese flower." If you *localize* it, you get what Latooni did.
In *principle* I agree. In *practice* I have to say that's a tremendous undertaking and would lead to a slowdown in globalization.

<a:oof:447819226795999233>
yamato nadeshiko?
but, it's an ideal.
My personal ideal is localization while remaining aware of the cultural context of the original, but that's a lot to expect from a wide audience (and rather unreasonable at that)
ah yes, the old "localization versus translation" debate

I always make sure to specifically visit the symphobaes
Oh do you have all your raifus on logi right now
4am your time
kill a map full of enemies for an assload of EXP for all deployed raifus
and EXP sim
data sim, where you kill a practice target ASAP to get training data for your skill research
there's capsule sim, where you go down a line and fight one enemy squad and get resources + enhancement capsules
combat simulations are three different things
not always but it's worth keeping in mind
and there's a theoretical minimum number of turns to cap all nodes that's often higher than the requirement to get S rank
Not if there are too many nodes, you have to win within a certain amount of turns to get an S
it should be noted that it's basically impossible to get silver and gold simultaneously
gold is "Get an S rank" to be fair
my bad
oh right medals, not ranks
if you win without losing or withdrawing a squad, you get an A
that menu tells you what you need to do to get an S
at the top left there's a "combat report" or something
so while you're in a mission
dess_. Shirabe I've been saving for a glorified chat room with guns
I had fun, and I'd probably continue to have fun if I played it again
like everything else
and bad things
its got good things
might actually pick it back up if they don't make you migrate completely
yeah IKR
<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
Promise?
$10, maybe.
It's 100% not worth it.
Don't spend $100 you can't afford to spend, on a mobage
You made this server, you built it into what it is today, and you `REDACTED` so I'd say you *earned* that $20
`I will buy you all those gun slots I swear to Miku`
***Do you want my money***
<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
then don't do it
I'll buy you $20 worth if I have to
Then as your friend I'm not going to let you spend any money on this mobage
<@!127644949884698624> do you have the disposable income to drop $100 on a mobage
so if you buy the $10 and the $5 you've gotten the same gems as if you bought $10 twice, iirc
The first time you buy a given denomination of gems, you get double gems
I never have any downtime in GFL
so while you have 4 out on logi and 2 in an autobattle and 2 repairing you still have 2 echelons for another mission
nah what you need is more echelon slots
I'm glad an opportunity for that emoji came up so quickly
<a:nepnep:453410843313569804>
She and Shirabe are both wonderful, I'm so proud of them
I'm so glad I found out that Kirichan has nitro
M950 and NTW are my special guns though
There are many raifus indeed.
<:NononSmug:453854264138137606>
You didn't ***yet***
It's the raifu agenda
It's very interesting
Have you seen the tumblr account that is mostly just SOP II pouring beer on herself?
SOP II with a box full of SOP II pillows
https://i.redd.it/gyoqcilafn811.jpg
dailies and other quests
pretty gooooood
you got the one that isn't DESS but still
congrats on your 5* RF!
MG34 and DP28 both require 600 ammo
then you're in luck
did you put in 600 of anything
have you checked it on the T-Doll list
***gunssssssssssssssssss***

Now that that's taken care of
<:DMJii:458047433067200512>
When it's working right, you have no idea it's even in the game
Oh fucking hell rubber banding in racing games is the ***worst***
Fire Emblem Warriors has several top tier waifus
<:saki:332719481673482240>
I have two emoji hosts because the Lulu Bus is full
It's hosted on one of my private servers
Kerrik posted it to heiro yesterday and I removed the whitespace
I can't remember how difficult the level 1 exp sim is
It gives a shitload of exp
<:FerrisThink:465485767905640468>
I have *exactly* 10 echelons
It's less, but it's also automatic
I got a few of my ARs to level 50 exclusively through autobattle
That's autobattle, actually
Oh yeah I've done 4-3e like 500 times and that's low compared to some people
Alice, I suggest using an emulator on a pc, and use the planning mode to semi-automate it
Don't forget ARs with night vision!
Night missions <:NononPout:454088299963875349>
I do have it
Poppi is one of Saki's favorite characters
Saki requests more photos of Poppi
No
Fuck me that's gorgeous
So many Poppi and still not enough Poppi
That's *another Poppi*

<:Ver:336656981144109066>
God I love that song
<:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>
That would have fucked me up
Oh what
Of course they did
What'd they play?
Oh damn I've heard that was good
*grumbles something unintelligible. The word Cage is heard*
I actually enjoy QTEs if they're not super mundane, and not in the middle of an otherwise no-interaction cutscene
it says in the bottom X/20 support echelons or whatever
that's my favorite tiki tbh

<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
Nice, what'd it take
I'll have to look at that later
Oh my
Oh

Nah Kerrik, you've given me yet another reason to live
Yeah all the archers do the same shit
And FE Warriors is pretty rad but only if yoy already like the characters
Fuck, that is now one of my primary goals Kerrik

<@99695384296701952> gentleperson's agreement on no spoilerinos, content must be confirmed clear before discussing it even in private
I'll be picking mine up after this appointment
For those out of the loop, that character is voiced by Nana Mizuki
Shining Dessonance is the best name ever, thanks Kerrik
And the skill is neat too
That's a *really* good buff though
What's her skill and formation bonus like
Congrats!

Welcome to gacha hell
Hasn't led me astray yet
I just slap em on guns I think look good
I regularly fluctuate between 60 and 0
Yup that's what happens

M4A1, SOP II, AR-15 and uh
Yup
<:fingerguns:427172356591583233>
Oh wow yeah you two have different opinions dontcha
Is this when 98 finds out that there was an easy mode and a hard mode and he played the whole thing on easy
~~it's on PC, mods when~~
I rescind my statement
RIGHT
I will just because it was tutorial
COST: 30
STOCK: 30

G41 is the only gun I want and don't have already
<a:headpat:453406859194269716>
Tar-21 is cool but not from heavy prod, sorry cast <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
Honestly I should just pin that because I say that a lot
NTW, Kar98 and STG44 are Kayano Ai
M1918 is voiced by Aoi Yuuki
I'm so sorry
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
My preorder was the only copy they had <:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>
Damn, this case ***is*** pretty slick
Oh wow okay then
How big is it
showing up as $10 for me
its so smooth and every death feels fair
yeah not at all

Seconded on Celeste

Please tell me other people played Mario Tennis on the GBA
Okay it's not a DS game but that one Mario Tennis for the GBA tho
Pokemon Diamond was my only DS pokemon game
I don't have any of them any more <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
Canvas Curse was dope
I had a few other games for the DS but it was my first Kart
Same, ten
Last time dry bones was playable was like, mario kart DS if I remember right
Followed by dry bones, boo, and yoshi in that order
Rosalina is my pick whenever she's an available character
That's a perfect compliment to my pink wooly yoshi, well done
***HELL YES***
What was it
Fuckinnn nice

MAIN CHARACTER-KUN HAS AN IDOL COSTUME
I'm keeping her in her default
yeah, armor skin

***KEY ITEMS IS RIGHT***

I know, right?
*I almost said Kizuna Ai*
featuring none other than Nana Mizuki and Kayano Ai
***SHINING DESSONANCE REFRAIN***
*clears throat*
we had an agreement
nah, no spoilerinos
what's the bet that I'll be reaching it in under 3 hours

after the demo
you're greeted by Blob Chicken God
the first bit of being able to control your character
literally
it blobs around like it owns the place
LOOK AT TBJS FUCKIN CHICKEN
I think that's silly regardless of gender tbh
so the only person allowed to have a relationship is the MC and whoever they choose?
that's the strong feeling I'm getting right now, yeah
amen
even if it was like, 1 guy and 1 girl out of the whole cast I'd be *fine*
"oh, you should expect entire mechanics of the game to be restricted to the male main character because he's the main character, duh"
when someone says that my complaint about a game is "silly" when it's directly impacting my immersion and enjoyment yeah there's gonna be a little salt
it *didn't happen*
even though
but all these NPCs are talking about how cool it was seeing the protagonist thing with their own eyes
but I wasn't controlling him, so it didn't happen
there's one part where theres this popup explaining how to do the protag-kun protagonist thing
because like, okay
the game also seems to assume that you're controlling him elsewhere
yeah sorry I can't get invested in an awkward, bland protag when there are cute girls RIGHT THERE
Protag-kun, yes
Except Yuma is the self-insert fodder so I guess that's the whole point
Replace "your" with "Yuma's"
Fuckin lies
yeah honestly fuck the yumabond system
`...`
I want to be Kirika flirting with Sonya dammit
I don't want to be protag-kun talking awkwardly to Kirika
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
you have to be main character-kun
but
camp lets you talk with characters 1 on 1
fuckinnnnnnnnn'
yeah I'm saving that for after the actual story
*oh my god there's a tsundere-KUN*
which I'm really really hoping isn't true
If my assumption is correct, it's all about bonding with *main-character-kun*
TINY HAT ACQUIRED
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
Same Krika, tbh
This is rediculous
Kirika has like 5 recolors
Okay, why so many swimsuits
SOP II, NTW, M590 are all top picks
`choose wisely`
which one
and they sold out in 48 minutes
they did
she loves saying her whole name and it's wonderful
`understatement of the century, in both contexts`
Kirika is pretty neat
they're not even voice-acted so it's not like having conversations for the other characters would have been much effort
but there's only one protag-kun
no idea
uugggghhhh I almost don't want to bother with all the NPC conversations in town
<:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
I beat a boss with KO'd party members
Yeah the gacha is outfits and furniture
One day I'm gonna pull off that look, I love bows

Lots of 1:10:00
I roll her fairly often
Lucky bastard
***EYE DEE DOUBLEYOU DA NYAAAAAA***
NTW is also the only one I've OATHd so far
She was mine until I got M950
Pew
NTW is like "if you touch me again I swear to god I'm gonna kick your ass"
So I don't forget when I get home <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

Definitely some of the more efficient dollars I've spent in recent years
I use my Switch fairly often
So they use the name because it's part of the license?
Oh I didn't know about that
I think they use it because it's somewhat limited animation
The adjutant like, looks at your taps and moves around a bit
Speaking of, I'm getting two SMGs from heavy prod <:NononPout:454088299963875349>
Better than whale gacha for the characters, at least
Hmm <:FerrisThink:465485767905640468>
<:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
So I just started waxing on Fortnite
I think I'm itching for another academic discussion but I haven't the faintest what the topic should be
**INTROSPECTION TIME**
(That's the general you, not `you, outside998`)
Your opinion on a game doesn't really have an impact on other people so feel free to call it whatever you want
You should keep your damn mouth shut if it has an impact on other people until you *do* learn about it.
With the caveat that
It's not often that you'll hear me say this, but *it's okay to have opinions about things you don't know*
Oh absolutely
If you say "it's crap" and then try it and actually like it, I'd say that speaks to your ability to challenge your preconceptions and change your mind
I disagree with that, actually
<:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>
If you told me yesterday that I'd be giving a passionate speech in defense of Fortnite, I'd call you a dumbass
That's a general statement, not necessarily applicable here
Honestly if you want to say it's crap and have reasons for it being crap then by all means, I'm not 100% right about everything
And yes, if they added like, a second or two to building structures I think I'd feel comfortable calling it a "good BR game"
I want to make sure that everything gets taken into account even if I'm not really into it. Anything less is disingenuous
<:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>
Look, you've gotten me giving a speech defending a game I've played exactly once and wasn't a huge fan of
My two biggest complaints with Fortnite are how fast you build stuff, and people getting confused when I say "fortnight"
I'd give it a bit more credit than that, to be honest. The gunplay seems solid, the weapons are easily distinguishable from each other, the mechanics are clear and easily explainable while still allowing complexity of gameplay.
But it's a "not good BR game" in my opinion
I'd say it's a pretty good game all things considered
And it's not even a "not good game"
Just because it's not good doesn't make it bad, there's middle ground there
It's got some great social play with the crossplay stuff, and the art style is actually something I'm a huge fan of. I don't necessarily dislike Fortnite. But as far as how "good" of a battle royale game it is, being able to cheese the shit out of the building mechanics is getting in the way
I am being very careful to not conflate popularity with quality
PUBG is more like BUG-G and Fortnite is just a bunch of building cheese from what I've seen
`Does a "good" battle royale even exist`
Iirc
It's another battle royale
I get it now
It was Culled down to 2
Was down to 2 players after 18 hours iirc
I feel like Grizzly likes me way more than I like her

***TINY HAT***
Not just any hat
As it stands, <:BikkiDetermination:441154738185043968> is in her regular outfit but <:SmugMira:403652815920168960> is in the idol outfit because ***TINY HAT***
If it wasn't so out of place in context, I'd definitely have them in the maido outfits just for those
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Fishnets
not me personally but I know a few people
So I've heard
GOTY Witcher ***3*** for $15?
A friend got it for me for my birthday last year
I should try that game again
That was one step ahead ***at most***
That's cheating <a:SayakaYell:393564307893518338>
I was about to say about the same thing but you beat me to it

have you got the double dess guns, sparkle?
I don't do superstition either
please
take some of mine

If we have that mindset, that's how we end up with channel bloat.
The problem is spreading conversation too thin, navigation problems, and picking the best place for your post, among others
Channel bloat is a concern we're well aware of.
Which is exactly why I said might.
I'm actually aware of a few people with that opinion. No promises, but we might consider something. *Maybe.* I am but one member of staff, after all.
SFW or NSFW as appropriate
I'd say the art channels are a better place

We have to be careful about what we add so we don't have to cull later on.
or maybe they don't want people running around calling other people n\*\*\*\*ers
27 minute temp ban iirc
In theory it's alright but yeah it's a tad aggressive
well I'll be damned
is fuckin peer to peer
my problem with payday
Aah I see
this is a game about shooting plywood and accidentally headshotting the people on the other side
there are many games about shooting people
note: I think the system is a tad aggressive right now. that being said, people seem to be actively trying to set it off <:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
I am wrong.

also who the fuck says "chink of light," that's not even a phrase afaik
never take anyone's word for anything on the internet
mostly because I've seen way too many instances of people claiming "unjust bans" and then the GMs post pages upon pages of slurs, vitriol and telling people to kill themselves
I have some amount of trouble believing that
not much to do on your own
if you have people to play with, yes
we were just floating some ideas around
oh right dinner
and are you available at this present moment
<@!99695384296701952> do you have tabletop simulator
also report, if that's an option
Retaliation never solves anything online, just mute and move on

I don't like her at all anyway
these are my shotties
She totally wants it
I got the popups, read them, and beat the boss with Kirika
not ideal but I'll take it
WA2k in heavy prod
well, speaking of gacha
is this what the not-gacha people feel like when we talk about mobage

I mean, is it really all that different

For instance:
I have autocorrect off but I get markov suggestions and whatnot

Enter the Gungeon is 50% off on the Switch for the next couple days
Dess
Excellent
<:KiriCheer:442974585529434113>

<:utazukine:439933437797728266>
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>

make sure you find some 4parters for next time when I'm in
<:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
>can play 10 times
<a:yeet:459639534850670595>
Spawning in siege, finding which one of my friends has the defuser, and sitting on their ass yelling "Give!" until they drop it
My new favorite pastime
Good luck on the muzak Boss
Oh hey scrmz you're up just in time for me to ~~log out of this account and commit to that one~~ go to bed
Godspeed, Boss
I wish I had an ear for music, I envy you
It's another M950 though, oh well
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>

Now my KS-23 can be the beefiest waifu to ever beef
***thwap***
<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
I'd best not see you skulking around nsfw
<:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
Oh great another person silly enough to admit they're underage on the server
Changed mine too <:mamibliss:366003511961321473>
<@290431224596660224> did you change your avatar or am I thinking of someone else
*squints*
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
See I really enjoy that one but I thought it gets PvP at the end once the Haunt starts
`something something Cones of Dunshire`
What're the big names in that genre?
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Dollars tho
I'm at work!
<a:headpat:453406859194269716>
and nintendo is hella slow with their patch approval
It's a known bug on the switch build
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
I can't fight the Dragun because the door won't open
Weird bug in Gungeon
desu desu dess
<:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
wouldn't that just kill itself on spawn
Probably emulatable, I'd imagine
<a:oof:447819226795999233>
<:KiriWhoops:442974593498611732>
So give me some time before gamu
Unless there's a new breed of earthquake that makes everything spin
Anyway I'm still in bed because I'm afraid I'll stand up and immediately *eat shit* because there's a lot of motion happening that really shouldn't be
Yeah like less than 5 minutes ago
<:glonk:363927619433136129>
I FOUND A ONE
<@!99158582326497280> GLITCH CHEST
huh yeah I just noticed the farmer
Otherwise known as the *tiddy shotgun*
That right there is the M37

Xenoblade, gotcha
Oh that's why the name Monolith sounds familiar
Completely unrelated to gacha
Hey the glitch chest is from Enter the Gungeon
***screeches madly***
floof
I missed an entire row of items whoops


killed [redacted] and got lead god
I was *so cool*
cigarettes the entire time
full metal jacket on floor 2 (first runthrough)
<@!99158582326497280> had a clone run
*very bad things*
`horn bone`
dess_. Shirabe Remove all pepes!
Are 1-4 *not* good?
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
***fuck now I gotta play another gacha game***
`That white fox is Kayano Ai?`
`Mithra is the Zoroastrian angelic divinity (yazata) of Covenant, Light, and Oath.`
<:KanadeShrug:278012179419234304>
I think it looks a touch too big though
Kiri's head looks out of proportion, is there a head size slider in that game or naw
I think she's asking what the hard part is
does the comma please you

***BIG MOOD***
dess_.. Shirabe
dess_.. Watersports
I wanna keep them sfw-adjacent, I know we have the watersports one but at least it's not `nonstop cum`
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
`wait which one is- ooooohhh I get it`
<:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>
It's a habit of mine, I called Overwatch `Abovelook` for several months
Maplestory 2 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Second Legend of the Mahogany
Oaktale Dos
STILL NO BELLYBUTTON <a:SayakaYell:393564307893518338>
Also
Steam/cyber/whatever-punk was never an aesthetic I got into either
Midriffs <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
***fake news***
Yeah and her bellybutton is covered
This is fake news <a:SayakaYell:393564307893518338>
The cloth covers her bellybutton
And also booty, even more right above
<@156627736327094272> drillhair, right above
Nice segue
Me too thanks
I think that's one of the reasons JRPG as a genre doesn't grab me, the characters are very locked in apart from sometimes the names
They the bestest
Exactly! ***Female protag*** <:mamibliss:366003511961321473>
Because das a good game right there
If Boss wasn't so strict about unnecessary pins I'd pin a message telling people to play Remember Me
Also, funny joke
Didn't they de-cheese backstabs in Bloodborne
Not a shithole mechanically, but aesthetically
Maybe even the first!
It was like, the second area!
So the proximity to wealth made it worse
The slums were basically favelas but right next to the Eiffel Tower
Those are fuckin awful places
We wanna talk about shitholes, talk about the Paris slums in Remember Me
***ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN***
>Oreo and Smores
Okay is blighttown worse than the poison gulch place in 2
I love it, shush you
<:YuiScare:442105076933459979>
Oh god Kerrik is gonna lecture me
üì£ **BOSS WEAPONS**
Ornifex is the ***BOSS WEAPONS*** bird girl in DS2
C's get degrees
Oh so I got like, 75% right
But how wrong am I
I know I'm wrong
Oh is that Smough and Ornifex or whatever the fuck
feat. Hibimiku and Madomura, I approve
you can't say that and then not post screenies of your character
üçå
Okay that's what I thought, just making sure
I forget, is she <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> or <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
She's the only persona character I know by sight
Wait isn't that Futaba
<:KanadeAngery:423961625066995712>
A ***great*** look
That is
I own golf story but haven't played it yet
Enter the Gungeon on switch is enough value for me
I love mine

definitely
`still $30 because they never lowered the price`
I think it's 50% off right now
basically, yes
next time we run one, I'll let you know
and modpacks exist that give a structured progression and an actual end goal
the "end goal" in minecraft is like, the end of early game in modded
*which then spits you out on the outskirts of another galaxy to get to the center of*
*get to the center of the galaxy*
do you have it
yes
and I'm one of the little lizard people
I'm playing *with a friend*
yeah like
not pictured: my rant about how spaceships are more like submarines than regular ships
no mans sky is now less shit

along with "gumption" "zest" and "a certain je ne sais quoi"
is there a "passion" slider in character creation
ooh
she never used anything even remotely close to that name so it's probably not the same person
gabbybites
name reminds me of someone I used to know
*squints at said bunnygirl*
is that R running around with the ***WATCH SYMPHOGEAR*** pet
Runescape membership with twitch prime
OOOHHH SHIT
and I thought pretty much the same thing, that titanfall was just a better version of AW
I actually liked AW too
double jump resets fall timer
Oh good point
Collaboration. Making good memes better.
Oh yeah true the wall-kick tech
The bottom path seems to suggest running off won't work
I'm the top path, every time
Discuss.

<:FerrisThink:465485767905640468>
I used to be like... #2 BLM on Ultros? maybe a bit lower, definitely top 5 tho
the scythe staff was definitely worth the $7
BLM here too
that's yours right
I got you wfc
here's mine
always leaving us on cliffhangers
she does that
<:GenjuroLaugh:461322367617073152>
now
isn't wow getting an expac like
<:madokawave:366003510010970122>
Yeah I didn't really wanna progress too much
Like, right after Cata I think
I have played wow for precisely 30 minutes and hated every second
and ***at*** max level there's not much to do
I got to max level and was like "why did I do that"
not too exciting
it's uuhhh
Don't have any screengrabs handy
Although my wildstar character is *also* hella cute
2, not 22
it's Guild Wars 22
Glam is the true endgame in *every MMO*
And Novachaser Sakii
Skydriver Kriisa (yes this is her, shush)
different game but here's Starmapper Yukii from GW2
***BIG MOOD***
thanks, shirabe
glam is the only reason I ever played that game tbh
Idk what to call this one but she smug
La Noscea Dress Uniform
Pristine Pistolier
Commando BLM
Here's a basic witch
here's my SMN glam from back then
ffxiv doesn't really have that many options for armored range
here's my Chris cosplay from back in the day
so I embraced the red and switched to DRG for 5-8, then MCH for 9-12
I was SCH in A1-4 until I realized that I wasn't actually healing, I was just a dps with a green box
I don't even wanna talk about them
My static for 5-8s was ***awful***
shut em up real quick
one week I went "Okay I'm playing BLM now" and they bitched and moaned until I got a 93% parse on our first boss
then eventually I was all "hey let me play BLM now" and they said "No way we like the res's"
so I was like <:NononPout:454088299963875349> sure
"Play RDM for prog"
My static in V1-4s was like
I'm hella out of practice though
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
I refuse to honor that with capital letters
Kanade Fortress or kingdom farts
make it happen
I prefer Kanade Fortress 2 tbh
Kanade Fortress 2
the speedlines are the best part
yeah I figured you'd seen it already but goddamn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiHIF2XACmI <@99695384296701952>
Play more Robo-Elfnein, life is too short to not do things you wanna do
Thank you for the learning opportunity
Latooni you made me look up a word and that doesn't happen often
I've never seen mercurial used in that manner before
***I
DO
NOT
CONSENT***
What up, I'm Kriisa I'm 23 and I never fuckin learned how to figure out when a meme is dead
Localized entirely within that blob
In this part of the internet
At this time of year
Is that biogenesis happening
***I DO NOT CONSENT***
<:BikiShock:447891354278821888>
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
Are words
These
we have a group chat for online mahjong round these parts
ohohoho
<@142192289760935936> do you play mahjong or are you just memeing
`way past cool`
I figured but I wanted to know if there was a reason for that specific song on that specific deck
Oooh neat
Just cos or is there a reason for that particular song
Why is your deck called that
No pls
Boof dog, 12 times
Let it wash over you, like a river past a stone.
Don't let them win
If you care that means they win
`My memes are the true`
Took me a bit to get it working but I can hotswap <@449062815534153748>'s meme database at will now
But yeah I wrote in a few utility commands for her a while back
Over 300 confirmed memes
Something something top of my class in the Navy SEALS
I could get up and install like thirty memes into Shirabe without even having to restart her
What do you have
I have the power of DMJii on my side
I dare you
Delete my meme
Go ahead
Much miss.
if you're interested
Go figure
Yeah I gave up about three years ago
We should 2v2 and I can bring my three year old freeze mage deck
Miss me with that het shit
But do you date them as a dude
I'm providing a Switch and my other roommate has a VR headset
When I move to Michigan, one of my roommates has a ps4
Oh my god I love them
That's a neat cat
I play sometimes
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
"Yukine Chris"
you're gonna like mine
as in, league of legends?
I love me some strip mines
and one of my favorite ways to play is construction bots only, no logi
I actually love every stage of the game
yo who the fuck wanna play factorio actually
I can't live without all my factory mods
it's the only version I *do* have
As in, you got it, or you're requesting it
indeed
fun fact, they're actually super necessary to save the "return to start" spin
did someone say unnecessary fidget spinners
and this one actually was on the reddit leaderboards for a while
this one's silly but fucking ***fast as blazes***
here's one of my old ones
I used to be all about the ***fast and the furious*** but now I'm just making sure it gets made
lots of yelling at orbies
this one was fun
not my finest work but it gets the job done

say the word and I'm there
it's been ages since I played that co-op
***OPUS MAGNUM HERE WE GO***
me: "I feel like playing a puzzle game"
oh my
not like
wait no what
Actually it's the definition of heterosexual
Ye
If it was the date Hazel would be congratulating the both of us
I understand now
Oh no it's unrelated
What am I being congratulated for
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Whenever you meet royalty, make sure you bowgaigar
<:SmugMira:403652815920168960>
Wowgaigar
More like
<:wow:378034256838000640>
What really
I didn't know it was a meme, I thought it was an actual tag on the boorus
`asymmetrical docking`
Didn't someone lose their bepis because they tried to fuck a car right after turning it off
The AR squad in GFL has been known to swear, better game confirmed
<:mamidisgust:366003497105227796>
Did they censor "nob"
Wow yeah those translations look absurt
I can't justify buying any video james right now, otherwise I absolutely would
<:TikiPraise:378689957235130369>
Is that the one with the mahjong
It's gripping
<@279341087494242304> I didn't want to interrupt your Samurai Warriors thing in <#407060923078017026> but I just wanted to say that it's really fucking cool, the way you're presenting the story and everything
What even is this game
I just watched Bayonetta suplex a giant angel dragon
Solo, that "everyone has the same personality" can be somewhat remedied by your extra commentary, which is the best part
I don't blame you
Gen is alright but I prefer 4
Same, but I'm limited to 3ds and Switch for the next while <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
Do you have 4 on the 3ds?
just nowhere to set up until September
I ***have*** a proper PC
I'm really fucking hyped but I also won't be able to play until September
Do they have a PhD or an MD
I'm several versions behind on vanilla minecraft but I'm pretty sure that's a thing you can do
Not a slime piston, but a slime block being moved by a piston
But a bunch of slime blocks stuck together can move more stuff right
I think if you pull a slime block, it'll move everything it touches
Iirc
Torches are 1 tick delay each
There's always going to be a delay with any repeating method
I'd argue that if you made a zipper effect it would look pretty cool
Stack it to infinity
You should make it vertically tileable
Joggers?
Or is hearthstone simultaneous with said plans
`other plans`
I thought you had
What does it look like in motion when you open/close it?
What happens if you load up a deck that's just "dessdessdess" until you have enough characters
I wasn't particularly enjoying it, like I didn't hate it but I also wasn't exactly having fun
`hey symphogear we found someone who's worse at consequences than you`
Oh jesus what
Oh I'm so glad I have that SSD now
Especially when you can knock the monster over and just go to fuckin town with the infinite combo
I loooove the swagaxe
Charge blade sometimes too because it's fun
Hunting horn when I'm feeling definitely not lazy
I use gunlance, switchaxe, heavy bowgun, and greatsword when I'm feeling lazy
<@110653846665056256> I know right, it's gorgeous
Hit stick was cool
What game, pats
Now that you mention it I haven't called myself a "gamer" in a while, just "I like playing video games"
There's usually a small loud group in any given group that does the same thing, and I hate it
The Rathian is my absolute 100% favorite monster
RATHIAN <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
Romance with a male protag is "please no"
Romance with a female protag is nice but not required
Exactly
And *no romance* is a plus when it's *male protag*
The *hard as balls* is a plus

Oh god is it manual saving
I'm still not 100% sure what that game is
I like the downtime in between the ***oh fuck what oof ouch*** moments
Not sure, but there's definitely a risk
40 second teaser trailer ***hype***

Oh hey thanks
I'm actually in the process of watching an Indigo Prophecy playthrough
No banning R for shitty Cage game references
But those others are dope
Face melter is close to the bottom of my tier list
Holy fuck
Who do you play
SIMULTANEOUS GUNGEON RUNS
And I haven't been to the second secret floor on the switch yet
I've been slacking on my key
I still haven't met the rat
When I re-bought it on Switch I had all 4 pasts killed before 3 deaths
I actually think that's more because learning the game is tricky
but it was ***so worth***
died on chamber 4
I got casey on floor 1
damn straight
<@!99158582326497280> YA GIRL'S GOT A CASEY RUN GOING
But I do
I wish I didn't
*I remember Evolve*
Oh I remember those games
Kiri/Chris as playable characters, some of the relics as items
I'm planning on adding in a bunch of symphogear stuff when the mod API gets updated
Alt costume: just add sunglasses
She's the Aoi, right
Is that the futaba
Free game!
<:KiriCheer:442974585529434113>
But I played the fuck outta 3u and 4u on my 3DS
In Gen, not much
Still don't know why they localized like that
It's a cooler name!
Also I just call it XX or Double Cross
I will be, not on release but yes
He was just one day from retirement
That's the Good Shit
Ooooh, megahand
Lemme know how it turns out
What even is this
He said "eight months" not "410 billion years"
Fire Emblem Awakening?
Kayano Ai is in it, and another character named Kirika

Shining Dessonance Refrain
If you need salt, just ask me to play SDR
Can't measure the fps on load screens if you don't have them <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>

Pff nice
Oooh which one
