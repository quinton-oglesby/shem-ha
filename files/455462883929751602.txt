Have you considered implementing the Not Quite Nitro bot into this server?
17 attempts on hard power, 700,000 dmg done, <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>  I better get good shit after I yeet the shit out of this boss
All dem cp refills <:FineShocked:672430513025187840>
nite
I actually need mega melody crystals, I have enough gigas but no megas
What's the best raid to farm mega rainbow crystals from?
Alright thanks, guess I'll go do dex raids
Oh oops wrong one, meant giga rainbow crystals
What are y'all dog piling on now?
This is the dex raid
There's a dex raid that's about to die, 400k health left
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
They're miracle crystals for a reason, it takes a miracle to get them
Oh btw would you use FM Chris for Red Carol? To deal with the Adds
<:FineShocked:672430513025187840>
<:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
I'll jump in once my cp recovers, thanks Iroha
I'm gonna need a goddamn miracle to get them <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

Lets quickly rekk Carol first
It's okay he still has 3 hours
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
ADDS ARE DEAD, DOG PILE HER
Y'all doing Green Carol?
<:KirikaJoy:672105345342111785>
Wow nice Jii <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
The only B there does physical
ðŸ˜® noice
The Unlimited ticket?
Everything else does peanuts
I'm using FM Chris as my B but the problem is that the int boss resists physical <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Is this the true power of alchemy <:AdamScream:672861878812147717>
How the heck do teemo and sanic do it <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
That damned physical atk resistance
We can all die together on int raid
same
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
Be like Hibiki and fist it until it's dead

Just put weaker units as your supports, randoms follow you less
<@292700103544930315> Both adds on Green Carol are dead
There's a red carol that's decently low, one add still alive though
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
