in s1 it was lilac, in s2 they changed it to silver
the only chris figma i've seen was a gk
I have the nendos and the figma, wish they had made a chris figma
chris in her gear might've also printed money
wonder why they made it and its variants
DMJii re first years and Hibiki is 2nd year
well what if s1 happened just before Tsubasa's 18th birthday?
she's 19 in GX, 17 in s1
at the end of s1 they were "missing" for two weeks

https://i.pximg.net/img-master/img/2017/10/07/20/06/16/65323836_p1_master1200.jpg
she should be 13 as it was  2years before most of s1 happened
if you made the fanart it goes into <#357682999300718592>
AU Miku showed up in the last edgebikki mission
Super Mahou Wars


they go kweh
aka the maids from Tsukihime
Here's some help for what to read/watch in which order
torrenting site
Chris takes EVERYTHING off, so it's still her thing
Kerrik, Lord of Pictures
something about him being the only Annunaki who didn't hate humans
a faust robe
xv will have all the girls get their best transformation
unless it's a dracula
a dead custodian's coffin and its anti-theft device
more alchemical knowledge to refine the robe and iron out any issues
it was a prototype so yes
"bang!"
wasn't it agematsu?
the scene shows a diagram of a line going from Earth to the moon, and then the Moon lighting up with glyphs, so it might be the Moon or Frontier, we don't know for sure until the show tells us or the keywords do
was it on the moon? It might have been Frontier
only Hibiki had a sorta training montage in S1
BD changed that, they came back
bodies deteriorate after a while, swapping bodies keeps her at her best
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
we wanted the s1 transformation sequences, the monkey's paw gave us them but we also got the s1 suffering
also Shirabe was not panicking
she got transfered to SONG in GX didn't she?
Millaarc
there are two floating around
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
if the family thing was brought up before the concert she'd be more likeable but as is she is irredeemable
didn't SONG find where the coffin was using Tiki's remains?
Vanessa is a cyborg, Adam is an android
the sword used to kill Orochi wasn't given to Amaterasu, the sword Susanoo gifted to her was found in the fourth tail of Orochi
probably got stepped on when Millaarc grabbed Miku
I think it was a lesser evil that Enki had to settle for to save humanity from the Annunaki
give it a week or two, just to allow people to have enough time to watch the latest episode
nehushtan and Durandal encountered a fatal error in the other
the symmetrical docking?
H) Hibiki flies off to defeat the rest of the Custodians
right now its reverse My Sunshine
keyword 9 on the xv site specifically says it's Hibiki's ability: https://www.symphogear-xv.com/keywords/key09.php
Hibiki's special ability is connecting others
Bikki can connect all universes to kill the god. Kanade and Maria could kill the god, but then it would be replaced with one from another reality
anyone who can wield Gungnir could kill a god, but if the god sees it coming they can pull in an alternate self to take the damage and they can keep going. Keywords say so
won't do much, Shem-ha can pull in  an alt universe of itself and cancel out the damage. Hibiki is the only one who can use Gungnir to cancel out the multiverse ability
why would Shem-ha care about some random humans?
Enki liked humans, and rebelled against his people and got stabbed for his troubles
Shem-ha has a different bracer to Enki
maybe heart friend
wdding pic is just Maria's side of the church, Yatsuhiro is just there because if the picture was more to the left there would be empty space.
they could have done the fight to get Hibiki to the godbeing
the slap was just the last little bit needed to break it, it was also  all that Maria said to Tsubasa about protecting others
or a sailor mars fan
shem ha might still come for him, he did try to subjugate their will and what self-respecting god would let someone do that to them?
mauser is German
that's the scariest one of them all
the keywords say that Vanessa made the ssj faust robe
Fudou thought that Noble Red had died after using Daedalus End without the right blood
and all is gone with the memories of some rainbows and flowers.
pre-christianity gods
the Annunaki were gods
their plan was: put ssj faust robe on miku>put shemha onto miku>control shemha
yeah I think Noble Red interrupted it and that's how they got Shem-ha'd
https://www.symphogear-xv.com/keywords/
I think they meant Miku ceased to exist as soon as Shem-ha took her form
or they're fighting it to get Maria out of its grip
they lie like how the fae lie: They give you the bare minimum of truth
https://www.symphogear-xv.com/next/XVnext10.php
and the tail thing sorta looks like what the Noble Red's shadows become before they form the monster silhouettes
it's a lung shot, and as long as both holes are covered he can survive until he gets to hospital
leave it alone until a few weeks after XV finishes airing to give people a chance to watch it spoiler-free
XV episode 10 shuttle defence scene
goes to an alternate world where she moved away right after the s1 concert
and the legend of the rabbit on the moon
all girls the best, an unassailable fact
Carol's Faust Robe is made from a sharp, so her singing makes sense as it's close to being a Symphogear
Wasn't Enki in the Frontier control room in episode 1?
and hibiki even tells carol she loves miku
XV: the fanservice season
she didn't need much focus, axz had the end of the majority of her character arc
don't think she has
chris is foodsexual
who knows, shinais might confirm if that was just a vision or not
no english subs, just japanese subs
they sometimes fix animation errors in them
too soon for that, they have to wait for the bd sale numbers to come in before they do that
they come on the bds
s1 had one
they really di forget them, poor chris
it also reminds me of guy shishioh from gaogaigar
<@431656503490117632>
or the shinai
In the screenshot above I'd say that the AnH pendant is activating and thus the glow makes it look larger
there was, I think it's just hidden rather than archived
at least you learn from them right?
Believe in justice and hold a determination to fist

do a find and replace sounds like the best idea to me
Definitely to be avoided, they are both slurs
starting to look like the changing of the Kaworu and Shinji scene wasn't to make it closer to the Japanese but to suit the translator's worldviews
are they skewing a bit closer to the original Chinese story?
sometimes, that's why you're told to keep people with a concussion awake
https://twitter.com/paulbensonsucks might be where the screenshots are coming from
more lives were lost in it than the sarin attacks in the 90s
Naraaa posted it a few message up
if you have proof of why you banned him Discord should hopefully not shut you down
I read the local governments in the area are appealing to the international community to fund them rather than sending the money to the central government
too big to fail, too big to work the way it was envisioned to is how I see it
i know of three: this one, valk, and the 4chan one
Played Hawkeye in the MCU movies
gender non-conforming
some people use trap to refer to trans people
so to stop creators being bullied they bully them instead
wasn't America Britain 2? Still managed to fuck up the politics
the military doesn't like drafts, they want people who want to be military as it means they don't have to work at making the draftees like being military
He thinks that if Trump could do it, so can he
https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12319029
you didn't post a warning about whatever the video is about, you just posted it
so more towards the fight than flight area of the fight or flight response
A few years back there was a poster on 4chan who would freak out whenever pics of the gears interacting with each other in ways they disapproved of eg Shirabe doing something with Chris. A few doujins that have been translated into English have comments from the uploader saying they didn't put up some pages as it would set off the person
<@279341087494242304>
tomosato and fujitaka
also that might be spoilers for OverDess who's just started watching the first season, so spoiler all of that
they use the same dressing room of course she knows these things
if it's anything like the NieR soundtrack, it would be spoilery
