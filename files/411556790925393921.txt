<a:laffeythumb:634681443104325632>
Nice
Adorable
If you beat the people into submission they will want to protest but you beat them so they can't
But not complete halt of russian resources
The most we getting is some pipelines
Its basicly stopped thanks to single country
In terms of money
So just making eu have no need to import stuff from russia would hit russia very hard
Alot of money
Cause money
But simply supplying european union with all the stuff it needs to import from russia would hit the country very hard
Dropkicking putin out of power and reshaping their system which would probably end terribly for everyone
But isn't the simplest solution just the one nobody wants to take?
lol
Wish i could help you
That sounds dumb
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
But does that mean you are alright?
Fenny you alright?
Sorry
Is it my fault that i view humanity as a failure
If i am to die i would rather accept my fate than cope with it
I wouldn't mind too much tbh
Why
Why
In a great catastrophe
And die
So i cam watch humanity crumble
Let my dream come true
Simple solution
Depends how low do we set the bar for democracy
Some probably take that to a whole another level
Us is not actualy an extreme example i think
But giving power to everyone isn't solving problems too well either
Being honest i want putin dead
Why
Person for that job can't exist
Actualy being kind would be problematic
Not too kind
But kind
We need people who are not selfish
Ye basicly perfect
Yes we need to summon shemmy
We need a perfect being to rule us
Democracy is a failure like every other system
That's how democracy works
That one time i look here i see a reason why humanity should be reseted
We seem to have stayed as racist as always
I don't ever remember stuff like racism being brought up as a big topic in poland tbh
Why is humanity like this
Nice
So sounds like a realy good guy
Ye
I have no idea who martin luther king jr is
I am just gonna say it
I hope you get wnough income to be happy
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Usa sure is weird
Like that's realy alot
I still don't understand hating black people in usa like they were infected with black death or smth
I think
Ye but like hardest things in europe would be some certain adolf
Usa seriously had some big racism problems
Why was usa so insane about it
Interesting
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I think china would be capable of clearing Taiwan with sheer numbers to begin with
<:FujiSmart:633028249408241664>
Like seriously?
Does that mean people have problems with this
What
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I hope
<:sayakawhythis_MM:406514345388933120>
I am betting it will reach 16,5% this month
Me with inflation reaching 15,6%
It's not like they are real people
Then try until it works
So they suffer for science
Then to orphanage
Let them grow in a lab a bit
Nobody
Just make people in labs or smth
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
It's hard to convince woman to birth more children
China kinda fucked itself a few times
Their choice tbh
There probably is a single small destroyer that achieved way more
Like entire yamato class didn't achieve much
They made 3rd ship of class of battleships an aircraft carrier
The entire class was tbh
Yamato was like a meme
Like the planes and their amount
I think a submarine carrier wouldn't work out too well with the part that is supposed to make it special
Why not check out the japaneese dream submarine carrier it's not like it will work or anything
Like it's stupid how we can't find a better solution to war other than preparing for war
Why can't humanity just stop these pointless conflicts
Wars are quite terrible
And it still kinda was a meat grinder
Ye cause you would need a giant fleet maybe
That just asks for a d day level expierience
Ye it has problems
To pull it off
And any good stuff
Like do there exist any good plans for this type of assault
I think this was beneficial
There can never be enough
It's money
But everything has 1 issue
Ye
Interesting
Are they impressive in any way?
I am kinda curious about Taiwan's forces though
Ye i am aware that murica is practically everywhere
Ye murica
It can't be perfect if people are imperfect
But it's impossible for utopia to exist
I wish for either annihilation or utopia
We should try making people equal for once
Like that's what paternity leave is for isn't it?
Ye
Strictly from business standpoint we don't want woman to get pregnant but we want them to have children so we have workers in next generations
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
We can't make everything work
And have quite big issues
Just to yeet our mental health
We ruin a working system given to us by nature cause it's brutal
You see
They are loud annoying and requite a lot of attention
On one end you have morality and idk raising the child the best possible way on the other yiu have the system we force on ourselves
That is not so useful
Ye
Don't give them ideas to just make lifes of mothers harder please
Ye but it's basicly same thing
Taking care of a newborn is the reason
It's like almost all of it tbh
Ye fathers can take pregnacy leaves where i live
Just cause we connect 2 cells outside of a human
Cause surprisingly discrimination is a thing
But still the problem is convincing people that people from in vitro are real people
Idk tbh
The problem is mostly mentality
Does it though
Probably hardest thing that's left is keeping the human alive long enough for it to develop into a human capable of living in outside world
Ye so we got majority of the stuff
It should be doable through the trying until it works
Cause what it's only moraly unacceptable and requires a ton of funding and probably nobody would pay that much for making a child in lab just for it to be bullied entire childhood
But still
I am kind not too surprised considering what topic the anime mentions
Lmao what the hell
Oh that way
How did you check it?
Sorry that my english is not perfect neither am i too good with words
Who is defending nazis?
No?
Like 3rd reich didn't even kill as many innocent people as soviet union
Difference
Not nice but nicer
Not just one but like you know
But when it comes to acting like civilised beings soviets way worse
Both were terrible
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
The soviets would do this stuff to
My great grandpas first hand expierience
On the other hand soviet soldiers had no such stuff like rules they would just steal murder and do the r word i am not allowed to say here with no consequences
<@207452640886521859> when it comes to 3rd reich soldiers they wouldn't steal and murder for fun and when they wanted eggs or smth they would just buy them if one committed a crime they had field court and the soldier was punished accordingly with the r word i am not allowed to say here being punished by being shot
Why can't we just make everyone able to enjoy their lifes
<:ServitorCry:700437019243053126>
Capitalism
You mean 99% of the people
I realy need to get out of poland
<:KurumiScared:696136193552810105>
I have 1 year and 2 months before this would affect me i think
<:ServitorCry:700437019243053126>
I don't enjoy my life too much on the contrary
Finaly someone who understood me

<a:FujiinoHug:709505005043974194>

Why undeducated anti 5g reptilian fighters attacking people for over their own choices
<:MukuSad:953421515116937236>
I don't know the guy but i doubt all he got amounts to that much if you consider the next families
Just wondering if this guy has the money he needs to pay cause idk
Hope everyone was fine
That is kinda terrible
And then you add the fact how much languages change overtime and we practically don't know how the original looked like
I mean we should always consider 
What was ok back then
How many translations has it been through
How many times was it edited
Every reason for me to say religion makes no sense is one i will take
So part of the bible is illegal?
Interesting
The more you know
But nice today i learned what the goliath is referring to
Let's wait a bit and we might get a more famous one
We need a better system
So if not enough jobs you get screwed
So you need a job
But you gotta pay
I guess
And what if there isn't enough work for them to work
Insane people
And useless
This sounds shit tbh
Sounds shit
And what is Alphabet
What was Meta
Existence is painful isn't it
It might be too late
Ah yes cause money > human lives forgot
I don't get it
Why can't they just make guns illegal though
Just make guns illegal already
I don't even know who he is
Welcome to poland we tell you to do something so you suffer from it
I assume people after drying would be usable but probably not effective
And probability of something emitting toxic gasses is probably around 100%
But then not much is left
Would need to dry them first
Mostly water
Probably no
But you will get sick and my furnance will starve
Coal expensive
To survive winter
We need fuel for furnaces
We have basicly an energy crisis approaching in poland
You will get diseases
No don't eat people
I never used snapchat ever in my life
Never heard of these
<:NatsumiWowYoung:647490547598098433>
Who uses Snapchat to begin with
What the hell
A cult like sanctuary?????
With probably no clear and easy solution
But ye poland sure has problems
Mel mel writing a kind essay explaining what people did wrong <a:TohkaYay:885155537291968532>
Lol
Ye
Unless action is taken on like everything
Like you can't solve our problem basicly
And they don't seem usable for longer distances
But i don't want these thrown everywhere
?
Wasn't it like we buy russian coal cause it's cheap and shit
Russia i assume
Cause i heard prices going over 100% up
Poland cheaper energy when?
In short it's toxic so please don't kill yourself drinking it?
But ye bikes are nice
Aria remember that being dumb is my thing
Ride it more
You get tired from riding a bike
It still is cheaper and just feels better
Even though i didn't ride a bike in years
Bike > e scooter
And it would probably cost alot
Ofc
Public transport works well enough even with 2 subway lines for entire country
That is not a problem
I can walk 5 kilometers and back so
You probably should add the polution from making one
E scooters just seem like additional cost with 0 problems solved
For the stuff scooter can do public transport is good enough or just walking while car solves every problem for longer distances
Ye but just making e scooters is not solving anything
Money
They just don't sound good enough
The problem is the possible alternatives
Seems more useful
I would rather just have a regular car than an e scooter
Sadly
You shouldn't stay there
I think if you can't be yourself and be happy where you are
Sometimes you need to sacrifice something to be happier
No fuel cause nobody drove it to the gas station
Ye
That makes england sound like a bad joke
Is England the type of place that would keep owning something deapite the cost?
Nothing ever would be without problems to it
I go shower now bye bye
So not realy
I could go faster on my bike when i was 12
Compared to a bike that will cost you water you sweat out and calories you burn
But if you use it alot it's gonna still be quite something
?
You mean energy usage
Expensive
Just don't be lazy ride a bike and be helthy
You gotta charge the e scooter making it automatically more expensive
Like if e scooter has equal price range and speed to a bike a bike is still better
And gotta pay for the energy
But then it's so much worse cause gotta charge it
Environment would prefer a bike
Your body would prefer a bike
Your wallet would prefer a bike
Yet you refuse to accept bike being superior
And give realy nice looking legs
Both can be lived without with public transport
Environment bike better
Gives nice legs if enough usage
Bike > e scooter
🧹🚿
Now it's time
Balancing is all the problems
Ye
Cause it was easy
I literaly got my bike license first try
Wow
I think i have one somewhere
<:MaikaWhatTheFuck:599031061812609044>
I guess having summer vacation does have it's benefits after all
Whaaaaaaaaat?
It's not  like i have these often
I am kinda concerned
I spend majority of my time infront of my computer
I literaly am in garbage condition and i can no problem have a 13km walk
Why?
<:mutsuwhat:899292882102521916>
What?
Like i had a 13km walk today and it didn't feel like that much
Realy?
Just stay hydrated and it is no problem
But i feel like a 10km walk is not that draining
Walking distance is like 10km at least right?
<:IsaacThink:740163723020468364>
Wondering how far they can go by feet
I heard people in usa reach the level of being fat where walking is a heavily draining exercise
I am surprised they can walk
Bike speed bike power
Oh ye mel mel cares
<a:MukuroRun:714539265014497400>
I literaly washed my hair 3x in a row to make sure it's clean
Then why get me dirty if i just showered
<a:laffeythumb:634681443104325632>
I will turn your chair into uranium glass set
Lol
Broom back
I heard the guy was kinda insane
Nice
I have no idea what raid you talking about
Oke aria
Interesting
Interesting
Most of the days i spend entirely inside
Now that i think about it it's not like i do much to begin with
Yes
It is reversible if you consider marvel science
It will take a while to adapt
For some time it won't
Only few more years and we could make this planet uninhabitable
We are almost there
<:SandyParty:530887651268755456>
Yes
So not everyone
I exist
I go back to reading DAL <a:MayuriPeace:758718452155809854>
Yes
Living as a human sucs
But then you don't chase them fully so you can't achieve the most happiness
Maybe
Why do i feel like not everyone should take this approach for safety of others
Sometimes i wonder what am i trying to say tbh
Please explain this thing mel mel
Socio what
But i guess my dreams are too idealistic
And not on making money
I would like to see big focus on effectiveness of our production
Why don't we try to develop as a species
Let society crumble
Yes
It's not like it's useful
Just kill it
Like why do we need to have so much of it
Just ruin it already
PiS in the lead doesn't sound good
I feel like scale is important if wewant anything done cheap and efficiently
Sounds like fun
But simple and very common despite it's long list of flaws
Public communication needs upgrades
I would love to see a nuclear powered car that won't make a large area uninhabitable after being run over by a train going full speed but that is probably impossible
My point is the very high amount of energy required
For trains right?
Wouldn't that be too violent to control
If i am not mistaken what triggera nuclear fusion in a thermonuclear bomb is nuclear fission so you literaly need a nuke power to make it happen
Isn't the issue with fusion how hard it is to pull it off
I tought that fusion was still only in bombs as a big energy source
I didn't know fusion was used for electricity
Wow wow wow
In a nuclear power plant
We should use it how we use it
That sounds horrible considering what a car crash would cause
Please no nuclear fission cars
Except when we want to move big stuff fast i think
While burning stuff isn't ideal we could try to burn different stuff instead
But why can't we check out other sources of energy than electricity
Feels bad
Ah yes
Me wondering why even use electric cars in the first place
<:SayaConfused_MM:366003479111794689>
Lol
I tought it had still some remnants of life
Odra
I think if i wait a bit more my country will have successfully exterminated life in a river
<:MariaPray:696136193435500634>
Sounds fun
Automated AA turrets <a:TohkaCooler:642012783298347011>

Ic
I am not so sure
Is it good if you exclude US existing?
But who knows what happens if the world flips upside down again
With the current balance of power i doubt unification will happen
<:MukuroStare:737187761005527124>
We need a better system
Are sometimes a big problem
Neighbours
Almost all of Russia tbh
Sadly
It has a border at least
Regional for Russia spreads over 2 continents
Sanctions aren't the best for anyone these days
Ah yes veto something that ruined a country long ago still is a thing
I have no idea who epstein is but i am too lazy to ask
Ic
Why is US like this is beyond me
Very normal for suuuuuuuuuuuureeeeeeeeeeeee
<:KaguyaDerp:730223246401863744>
I just said that
I don't think we can just blame US for not getting along too well with USSR in cold war
<:NatsumiThink:758718450838274078>
People when someone gets a delayed abortion are often more unhappy than with regular one
Fun fact it's still not enough
Ik ik
Interesting
No and i refuse to do so
<:EllenWhat:596130137926533142>
Lack of change is probably one of the worst things
Honestly the smart one would become a good side to pick and not sit there doing nothing
sounds fun
interesting
who this guy?
Tbh nobody would notice if something went missing when you think about it
PIS going crazy with the numbers
i didn't expect this to be this high
Ayo wth
but large part of Russia is still in Europe
Please just yeet TVP or make it stop being government propaganda
Sounds fun
Cypher sure got interesting pm
<:NatsumiStare:713180925197942844>
I think if they manage to convince the Ukrainian soldiers that they are unarmed from a large distance it should work
Lol
police needs tools like tear gass in these kind of situations when they don't have numbers
and that takes time to gather and prepare
requires more numbers than they mostly have
but this one is impossible
Guns: Police shot into a croud of people
guns exist after all
it's one of the better options tbh
surround the dangerous people hold the line and evacuate the innocent
sadly police can't use anime powers to stop a riot
to have good chance to stop you either need a "weapon" or numbers
then get more police
but you should consider how police didn't have many options
this was indeed by the police
which should go back to the design itself
the police shouldn't be the ones at fault as much as the ones responsible for exit routes
what failed the most is evacuation tbh
Doubt
I think squarcles wants a more polite vocabulary
Russia has shown to be untrustworthy already
Just safety thing
Also i don't want any more russia on my border
And many other cities and towns across the terrain which they occupied
It's probably the best for Ukraine to keep fighting considering what is going on
Russia currently facing motivation issues would certainly get part of it solved by having Ukrainian forces strike Russian territory
That sounds impossible
Doing that would be bad idea
It certainly isn't cause Russia didn't realy stop last time they took something
While USA is still respecting that promise Russia certainly isn't
Last time Ukraine got a promise for respected borders from Russia was when they gave away their nuclear weaponry to Russia
Based on what Zelensky is saying they will only accept full independence with all pre 2014 borders
To the country
East and south of Ukraine is realy important
Consider which territory first to it
The peace they want includes all of Ukraine being part of Ukraine
Just
I doubt they can win the war this year and they are seeking peace
there are many people who want to escalate conflicts into racial genocide competitions
if you believe everyone is suicidal yes
I barely know east asia politics at all tbh
Thx for info Miso

Hackerman
What did i just read
Could have tried to ignore the issue
He is so dumb then
?
Why not just say that you got no control over this so it doesn't concern you
Either way it won't help the sales
Like i often heard of him being a great director
But i never heard of him being charged with anything
I watched one of his movies
What about a stick
Lmao
That's what millions are being spent on
Yes
They actualy broadcasted it
This is the gas pipeline explosion simulation from TVP
<@87512939107450880> https://youtu.be/_22i_QRJGpo
They often even say stuff that is just purely stupid and makes no sense cause they don't notice the issue
And making up connections between russia nazi germany and anyone they dislike is quite common
TVP has so many lies and propaganda
Not even surprised at this point
Basicly propaganda tool
That's what TVP is all about
I am curious how his opinion would change if he got sent to  1930s/40s germany
He is good evidence that being rich is not enough to be great
TVP at it's finest
Lol
Loo
Ic
I have no idea what you mean by that but pencils have nice smell
Like adolf was quite talented and skilled at giving speeches and getting support but he wasn't realy amazing enough to be known for his skills instead he is known for his very insane ideology and the crimes committed cause ideology
But even worse one
If trump says it it's not a realy bad idea
"If musk does it" is the part that explains alot
I wouldn't be too surprised if making prisoners work for the state as rehabilitation passed here as a good idea
Well idk how hard slavery hits americans as a concept cause it certainly doesn't hit as hard here
If you are beyond rehabilitation you should be isolated like other insane people
Ic
They can't have as many rights but i mean like major violations
Cause they would run out of methods
Just punishment would end up with violations of human rights most likely
Criminals should be punished and rehabilitated tbh
Just better or worse ones
Is that there isn't any actualy good solution
I think the biggest issue with all that
Prison should be a punishment but that shouldn't mean that they aren't allowed to work
I want them not to just sit in prison but actualy contribute to society by working normal jobs and feeding the economy
I meant like actual jobs
Ofc that would require recalculating how long the sentence should be
And earn money
Feed the economy by having them just do normal jobs
Then they would be both useful and punished
With that it would be ok if they lived through taxes
I feel like they should be allowed to have a job and earn money while in prison to feed the economy
Just make them behave let them watch some movies and have some fun so they don't go insane
From what he says it was more about just making them behave in prison rather than any rehabilitation
My dad worked as supervisor in prison
That's the issue
But that never happens
Makes sense
Not everyone here is happy that prisoners are basicly living fully from taxes and just sit in prison
Would you rather have them live from taxes for few years ?
That looks like he is trying to make it sound like a sacrifice and not just people dying
elon realy likes to make large piles of paper doesn't he
Zuckerberg is going down pretty quickly isn't he
But it requires some extreme stupidity
It is possible to lose wealth pretty quickly
Or make terrible financial decisions
Why can't anything just work
He does things this stupid and still is this rich
That's the most impressive part
Yet he is pretty rich
<:MadoShrug_MM:827587159375740970>
It will never be these two so
I don't see the issue with the meme
This is a thing they have in common
Both made increadible fictional achievements
When you think about it
Elon Musk kinda is similar to Tony Stark
me not even knowing who is who
I feel like the word nazi is often overused
He didn't realy make any camps though did he
I bet if people said it is an American soldier many would believe
That is quite an issue
But twitter neutrality seems to have faied as an idea
<:MukuroMegaLUL:790211261669179413>
that's why elon decided to sacrifice the king to see what happens
Yuriko sometimes when you play chess you sacrifice a pawn to win the game
And owning one as better than car and house
Like just advertise buying a rocket as a normal thing
I wonder who would buy stuff from SpaceX
Lol
I didn't notice
Lmao
Wait he said biggest
While he isn't wrong with 7% being a massive part facebook dominates twitter with over 10x more so i wonder what is his point
I just feel like they don't want the conflict to end yet and want russian army to be destroyed in this conflict
this is pretty true
press the button
I can assure you there is quite a few in poland who would consider this as a reason for a military response
Doing nothing is the worst thing
Like actual reaction
I hope there will be a reaction
When you consider how big Russia is it's pretty poor for it's size
Typical russia <:Clown:642491422125326356>
~~Kaliningrad partitions when~~
it hasn't worked out well even once so
but with our current government they would probably try to find a way to make everyone mad cyphy
<:aizensip:418187376058302464>
🤝
most likely
they are too random
i am completely unable to predict our government tbh
what is the good outcome is the question
but hope is always there
i highdly doubt anyone would care enough for actual military response
also "BIJ BOLSZEWIKA!" <a:FujiHappy:549633918249467964>
That is realy terrible
I am getting my ass out of this country as soon as i can
No ofc i won't
And finishing highschool
You can't enlist before turning 18
In at least a year basicly
<:MadokamiHug_MM:617329340027240458>
Ic
Want a hug to feel better?
That sounds very bad aria
That is quite early
Like how can you be a nazi and slavic at the same time is beyond me
That means that they are not even polish/ukrainian
They should at least use the word fascist instead of nazi tbh
Best possible answer to putin is telling him not to shit himself
It sure did
Sadly
Poor Ukrainians now need to suffer cause of russia
Some form of escalation is probably the best choice
Ah yes totally
Worst neighbour wouldn't recommend
Quite alot
Russia is generally disliked
The one thing i can't deny too much is what he calls russophobia in poland
If i am not mistaken lockdown in china was a lockdown in  the most literal way
That sounds pretty terrible squarcles
Lockdown kinda is that but if it's necessary it's justified
Poor Chinese
There has been quite a few communist dictatorships on earth
Yuriko how could you
Yes it's a day dedicated to Yuriko
How will protest against zero covid policy start ww3
But this is more connected to left never being given a chance
They are a right wing party
The ruling party to be precise
Polish government seems to be trying to go more for no free speech no democracy tbh
I feel like polish government won't do much
Weird
Yet people wanted to escape the entire soviet block
Communism especialy with what ussr did is pretty much impossible to remember positively in east europe
Ye
I am unable to name a country that lived through communist regime in europe that would want to come back
I don't understand when was communism successful but if you want the hard anti communism it's actualy most common in eastern europe
From what i know china straight violates human rights
It collapsed for a reason
And ussr would certainly not be the developed successful country
I didn't say rich or developed
Like countries where you have high living standards
You see i mean cou tries that are rich and developed
Lank you ain't telling me the current leading party propaganda is even comparable to what you would here in news before they got power
So by west you mean basicly any developed and rich cou try i assume
It's literaly only the current leading party trying to force propaganda on people
Poland is one of the pro west when you consider  a large part of the government and people
In the meantime what about east europe
West is a very broad term
You see North Korea isn't focusing anything on external propaganda it's mostly internal 
Also define the west
Today's rely on today's tech so they wouldn't be usable
And i highly doubt same methods would be even half as effective today
These were so different times
I highly doubt entire planet cares about california strike
Also
North korea is a pretty good contender for that spot tbh
Many aren't
Polish government propaganda is pretty easy to notice how bad it is
Most countries aren't even close to china in terms of propaganda
You are overestimating this
Cause that's a broad term
Also define west
Cyphy asking good questions
China is certainly not bettet then the so called west
But china is also exploiting Africa
Often It's connected to corruption of African countries and companies using it
This is 2022 lank and eu doesn't own companies
Eu is more left than right tbh
And poland is too far right for eu standards
Poland was only benefiting from eu
It's not
Ye
Russia was the benefactor of soviet block
Ye
I just dare you to walk around eastern europe and ask people how do they feel about communism and soviet regime
When ussr fell apart
The one country that basicly lost it's colonies
But russia is like what
Communism is remembered as one of the worst things here you know lank?
We can't
That's like brits regretting losing colonies when you think
Yet who else did
The number saying no is still pretty high
Also you see the sharp drop in 2012
communism is the exact same reason why no left wing party has a chance at winning an election here
That doesn't prove that soviet union was better
Why would people want to get rid of communism if it was so good
The nationalism in eu
Then how does eu support fascism
Eu is basicly anti fascist
Good night
According to lank you either are pro communist pro china or a western fascist idk that's kinda how it sounds
What am i even reading at this point
<a:CocoStareWTF:728344017301143642>
But not fascists
They are just a greedy circus
They aren't
They are closer to a circus
Not fascist
Like there isn't realy any fascist party with at least 1% of votes in eu
As far as i am concerned no party went with fascism
Lank there is pretty much no actual fascist parties in eu
Europe as what eu stands for is purely anti fascist
How would you prove that they are fascists lank
There is like no real fascist party in italy i think
I will just 🤡this
Why are you suddenly so mean though
So
Not realy
Cool but do you compare them to good countries
That is a good place to live in
Me waiting to witness a successful communist country
It sadly most likely won't yet
Ye but PiS collapsing would benefit everyone
It is for everyone's benefit for PiS to collapse
No lank
I am actualy looking forward to the collapse of PiS
No
They even have infighting
Ye they are just stealing
Like at this point PiS is trying to force a country into a crisis
They wouldn't just build the most useless airport ever
With slowly killing the economy
Cause a compilation of tragic decisions is not helping
Ye but PiS pretty clearly doesn't intend to make this country great how a nationalist would
And there isn't realy fascist countries in eu
Cause eu is basicly best thing that happened to poland
Lank you aware how worthless are words without action
But you don't seem to be aware
PiS is just a circus if you know what they are doing
Poland is still pro eu
Also not even 10% of poland wants to leave eu
They would do anything that gives them money you know?
Despite PiS trying to make eu the bad ones
Poland is largely pro eu
But still
It's not actualy if i am not mistaken
Only korwin with his clowns can beat them in being a circus
They are basicly the 2nd biggest circus in polish politics
Ye the right wing that buys vites with giving money
Like it's pretty obvious they are doing their best to get money and destroy free speech
But PiS mostly is just corruption
It's just enough to get the leading party to lead
It's about 30smth%
<:NatsumiStare:713180925197942844>
You are now trying to force your image if what i am thinking onto me
What knockout argument
And current leading party is trying to make eu seem like the bad people that work with russia against poland
Like large majority of poland is pro eu
Just because leading party is doing stuff it's not entire country supporting it
Like straight up majority of poland is pro eu
Most of poland is pro eu
You seem to have weird image of poland
Like tell me how is eu nationalism even working
Is about as noticeable as an ant
At this rate there won't be future to look forward to
i swear humanity will one day collapse <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
And i guess it's the same thing  again
I guess cyphy was realy right
Communism literaly slowed down development was trying to rewrite history and had huge propaganda machine and you here declaring that ussr was good?!
The iron curtain was the line that separated west  and east
Lank moment is i guess how i will describe what i see now
Cause you don't seem to be
Are you aware what even was communist europe or no
Lank you are so oblivious to how communist europe was like
Lank you pretending to be like this or you fr
You aware that forcing a workplace to exist despite it being worthless isn't good right?
Yet everyone says it got better
Look at what happened in europe switching communism to capitalism
How is socialism the answer to it
Can you deny that some countries aren't overall good to live in compared to other countries
The 3rd one is probably the best way to say that they don't care tbh
Or just make it an exception and change the age discrimination part at age of 16
Move all the rights from 16 to 18
Make it 16
Either
To make it logical there are 3 options
If it's an inconsistency with their law
I guess it's something that was bound to be brought up at some point
Weird situation is the best way to describe it
But still
I feel like they should get voting right to be consistent with rest of the law
Is it realt that important tbh
Unless it was russia noone here cares tbh
Cause not everywhere it's a valid option to be friendly to the environment
And have money for it
You need to convince everyone that it's worth it
The issue is
This would require multiple years of planning and negotiations
You can't just stop polluting the planet in few years
The issue is we can't fix every problem we make
Every species will go extinct some day
The good news i can tell you is that it's only mostly our doing as humanity
It's kinda predictable that any material about animals is gonna include sad stuff
I assume thos wouldn't even be a topic
If there were good things to say
I know 0 cases where equality was achieved and it ladted more than a year
That's what happened
You switch the people who are at the top
The issue is that there is always someone at the top and you can't realy change that
Ye
Pretty much
They will be rich
And these people will earn alot of money
The moment you have big companies people own these
Simple
You pretty much can't
Like if you hate the uber rich so much stop adding to their wealth
Rich is still rich
Just because they bother to gather wealth is their choice
The moment you own a company you are rich
Yet the rich own them
There needs to be the rich
This is the issue
So you need tge rich to help you survive
<:aizensip:418187376058302464>
Ye they do but why work there if it hurts the environment
And then you realise people work wt these companies and it's not the one person at the very top who should be responsible
Why make rich people your enemies in the first place
In middle ages exploitation was going realy hard
You sure you know what middle ages looked like?
But you still didn't prove that it actualy happened and isn't idealised view/minority
I strong 
I get best stuff
Rest get trash
Rest work for me
That's how primitive humanity js
Simple human nature
Some but prove that it worked for at least half of humanity
Lank saying most tribes like have you seen at least how primitive humanity is at core
You didn't even prove that tribes have no exploitation
Pretty much gets best stuff for himself and leaves rest for the lower ones in the hierarchy
They probably need to to understand how it looked like
Show me valid proof of tribes not having exploitation
Yet it wasn't one without exploitation
Which you pretty much can't fully do
Hierarchy basicly leads to exploitation unless you somehow convince people not to do bad stuff
Are you trying to say tribes didn't have a hierarchy where some had more power and stuff
Be specific
This is no proof just saying a most human history
Now show me an example that worked on a large scale of at least a few hundred million
And if you mean cavemen sharing then there was still a hierarchy
Define primitive communism
There is always a hierarchy
But it still exists
The exploitation is not always on the same level
Some are at the top some are at the bottom
Some are exploited some exploit
Yet it all has 1 thing in common
Lank realy doesn't know
Are you even surprised that the red scare happened
Look at what happened in communist countries
Being shot in the head was the good fate
Fuwa you realy don't know what cheka was doing?
Cause you say so
Ah yes everyone lived a great life
You don't seem to be aware of what cheka did
While not limited to them i don't rember many reaching cheka in what they did
The communist revolution didn't realy go too well for people
You know that when Lenin was ruling there were still purges
<:sayakaFacepalm:635345423690891274>
Remember that all this allowed you to be here and have internet
Cool
So many died and suffered
To get rid of all that could oppose
Violent is mostly for what they did right after the revolution
Communist revolution in russia also went realy bad
Big bloody wars not just wars
And if you are a millionare you have ways of becoming a billionaire but it's not wrong that you own more than most other people will ever
Exploitation is pretty much part of human nature at this point
That's disappointing
You can't even make your own proof by using the knowledge that you already gained from it
If you can recommend a book than you have probably read it and can prove it using what knowledge it provided you with
I am waiting for valid proof not a book
I suppose
Lol
Me in middle of math class in the meantime
This is still going <:MukuroMegaLUL:790211261669179413>
And then you realise that amazon still can't win everywhere
What is a terf???
Extreme ones require different solutions than most
These are the extreme cases not the more common ones
While yes it is ofc more common for men to commit sa on women then for women to commit it i think it's more the feeling of no responsibility for this
As disappointing as it may sound this issue is basicly impossible to stop but should be possible to reduce
That should come down to people abusing their positions or just people not being the best at behaving properly
That is a separate but quite important issue too
I think the biggest issue would be that you need more women to even apply for positions of power so it becomes more normal for them to have this positions just slowly changing how it looks like
Not denying that the conservative leaders for most part want to prevent that from happening
I think best way to look at fashion would be to look at it same way as a painting
Despite how it sounds like a joke it is still logical and makes sense which is pretty concerning
But over longer period it should change compared to how it is now
It certainly is not a quick way and a perfect one
Shouldn't alot of this be solved by steadily increasing how populat positions of power are as choices among women
But you know that if there is 1 term to describe them then there are viewpoints that are shared in common
<:basathink:823212165494079528>
What are the feminists viewpoints, arguments, ways to fix the issues
I wonder how terfs see the concept of reproduction tbh
Ye i noticed
I am unable to process how someone can even give a reason for this being feminist
<:PtiloStare:703401638731317319>
The type of people that refuse to understand that without men humanity as a species would have died out
Ic
Without actualy being an extremist
You join a group not an ideology
And how would you do that
Rare cases of shit enough situation
What else was supposed to happen
You don't need to have an extreme ideology to take extreme action
Random example
Prices of electricity going way too high for people to afford 
Extreme action freezing the prices
Ye but you know that extreme action doesn't mean extreme ideology if one is necessary
Extreme ideology is not realy same thing as an issue that requires extreme action
Isn't the most logical conclusion that extreme ideologies are in general very bad
If you rarely hear of a murder being caught and punished it will be easier for you to believe that you will get away with it
But hearing about them might give people the idea of it being punished often
Not hewring about them won't make them disappear
The painful truth is that the more of these stories you hear regardless of men on women women on men is better
You will get used to it idk
I don't think everyone does that
I am not denying that
If i am not mistaken here it is
I have no idea what this is implying but okay
Ye
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
i am not art critic either but you can pretty clearly see this painting looks very good
ye
so much potantial for good paintings wasted
seems like a good painting if you ask me
sadly
which is painting and getting people to follow him
in total i can name two things that overall separated from who he was would be good qualities
hitler had good qualities like being a good painter sadly he decided to follow his very bad qualities instead
Someone here pretending not to use their brain subconsciously
<:TiredTalulah:688526708093354067>
You do it without even thinking about it you know?
Basicly mixes stuff from what it has seen
I am aware that it uses the same method as human brain when it comes to created
Didn't look at AI art much
I think the biggest issue with AI art would be loss of value of human made art
Like i said it's pretty much how human brain is "creative"
Like when you think about it AI creates images same way humans use their imagination
As always people are the issue
Combining it
Mixing it
Taking apart what they have seen
Also AI art generates picture the same way humans get the idea for their pixtures
Quite important that not everyone is fueled by greed
Way too much
There was alot of stuff there
Neuron connections are sometimes through electrical impulses sometimes through chemical ones depending on the neuron type
There is so much in human brain
Replicating a brain as complicated as human one without legal ways to even study how it works through experiments is quite hard
In way too long
And at the core is similar
AI has more potential
But then
The variety of expierience instincts and level of complication in a human brain noticeably make a difference between humans and AI
Asking a why question to something that wasn't supposed to answer these and has way less expierience with interactions at the same time unable to relate to concepts driven by instincts
A brain is considerably more complicated than a computer
The most noticeable differences are the complication level of a brain in general
Ye
Like humans are that much better
I am only talking about the process not the information used
The entire process of human imagination is just mixing stuff you have expierienced your memories to make something
And AI being designed to be effective
That is kinda related to you know not teaching AI to recognise what a face is
For 99.9999% of the time ye
What mel said
<:PtiloStare:703401638731317319>
You can't force everything to be a choice between good and bad
I am not saying you shouldn't do it but that it is bad
It is still bad even if there was no other choice to survive
It is bad
Quite obviously
oke
While yes people have the right to their own opinions and to voicing them it's kinda an issue when these are based on misinformation
give them reeducation or some more "interactive" lessons on instead
tbh idk what is a better idea to do with people like that
either way they would be exploited and exterminated at high rate
i don't think you can assume that so easily but they certainly would have reached some high numbers there or in different kind of facilities
Yes
I can't even legally insult police, firefighters, teachers lol
Great idea tbh
That sounds nice
Idk if it is but their choice
Ye but being competitive among men is just so much more common
The probability of a man going into a competition is pretty high if you challange them
?
You mean the constant feeling of life being a competition
I said for example read carefully for once
Just simple there isn't as many female programmes as there is male
Cause when you have alot of people in programming for example you will most likely never reach 50/50
Not necessarily
You can't just magically get 50/50 cause time
Then get 50/50 women and men applying for every position
Different positions have different ratio of female to male employees
Depending on positions which they were it's not
But without a statistic telling that there was much more men and actual proof that they were doing their job equally well you can't already come to a conclusion
You would need to somehow prove this is targeting women
Like which positions they had
But more data would be nice to get
With this percentages difference i don't thing it can be targeting women tbh
Interesting
Since when can you get sued for that <:NatsumiStare:713180925197942844>
Still you can't achieve full equality
That would be an unachievable utopia
It's realy not
Equality is impossible you know?
And vice versa
It has alot of differences
That depends where and i don't think you can just say better
Like you can find quite alot of people who regard others as slaves to them regardless of gender
I am actualy surprised by this
<:NatsumiStare:713180925197942844>
I am not assuming
And my country is supposed to be christian conservative one
That can be said both ways but majority regards women as equal at least here from what i know
<:NatsumiStare:713180925197942844>
Didn't it stop being controversial already?
Ye ik
Ye i am just saying
Aria the amount of blood that gets spilled in women fights was noticeably more than with men
<:aizensip:418187376058302464>
From what i have seen in fights like boxing and stuff women would be more violent
Quantity is very different
I am not negating the society being there but testosterone also has it's part like always it's result of multiple factors and not just one or two
Clara you can't judge majority based on an individual
I didn't say that
Testosterone straight up leads to competing and fights due to increasing how much a person wants to do these things
The dumbest bets who can smth more are a men thing mostly
If you do way too many you will get into some trouble
You can fix issues easily
If you do a few
With every change there is consequences
Just don't flip everything upside down
<:NiaFacepalm:682306061566214163>
How much short term suffering do you want for your goal is the question
But do you think flipping the world upside down would go easily
Cool
Now you talk like a 60 year old
I believe the world is shit so idk
Step by step doesn't mean take 500 years to do smth
It's not
Logic 
Change 1 thing look at probabilty of failure
Change 100 and look at probability of failure
The bigger the change the bigger the risk
Ye but not too big
Something comparable to flipping the world upside down in a way
You need to do stuff step by step
Sudden big change is not something that realy can go well due to too much too fast
Wdym?
We need to avoid giant changes cause that will end badly and we need to avoid stagnation cause that will end badly tok
Makes sense but stagnation is bad
Strive for perfection cause that's the only way to get the highest
Strive for 100% and see how far you get
Wrong
Ye but equality itself is unachievable
But shit
Better than any other system i know
All i am saying is that democracy is pretty shit
Aria stop putting words in my mouth
If it is reliant on humanity being so good it will never be good
Best and still shit
Please don't pretend to be blind
Like everything else humanity created
It's shit
It's not since it failed to maintain itself
Like how is democracy a successful system
But why is everything about US
From what I know US still is a democracy
I don't think it was intended to stop being democracy
The biggest flaw of democracy is how easy it is to break
If it was good it wouldn't have flaws
Not good
It's better
Just because something is better than everything else doesn't make it good
Democracy very noticeably still is here
But shit
Way less shit than any other system
Democracy is shit
That's my view on democracy
Democracy is the greatest piece of shit ever created
I don't realy think humanity could handle a sudden change on a giant scale
Why do you assume i have faith in humanity
And no just suddenly flipping the world upside down is not good
This is now
But this is not sometimes
You said this not me
You can't just do it suddenly or losses might be to great
Closer to trying to a clash of entire armies
The world is not a tank
This refers to issues that the change would create
That was quite predictable
As expected aria
To be precise
Not so nice people buying positions with promises
Whatever is going on poland should be an example
For which thing exactly do you want
More tired
I certainly did not get angered
But it's natural that people will feel offended in discussions when they have different views
And no i don't think i attacked anyone
You're making me question why do i even look in this chat
<:NatsumiStare:713180925197942844>
Like changing entire system
How is having faith in humanity not believing it can just handle alot of stuff at once
Cool
<:aizensip:418187376058302464>
A case of forcing your image of me onto me
You said i have faith in humanity
I already stated what i think about anything humanity created
Now forcing your image of me onto me
What is your point
I say something is bad but best we have and you want smth better from me
And you asking me for an elternative for some reason
Ye
Democracy is the best system but i am unable to say it's good
Cool
Then it's not good is it?
<a:MayuriPeace:758718452155809854>
Now i disappear cause class
https://notesfrompoland.com/2022/06/02/polands-judicial-council-is-no-longer-consistent-with-the-constitution-finds-supreme-court/
This being possible shouldn't be ok
That's my issue with democracy
Am i seriously supposed to drag an article from months ago
<:NatsumiStare:713180925197942844>
At the moment they are doing their best to gain control of judges
Current government
Due to people often having attention span of a 6 year old 280 is too much for some already so
Ye looks like china
Relatively it's expensive to be poor and rich so
Or it ends up in being excluded
They have the right to do so and it's their choice and people can feel insecure about their salaries
They can just not want it due to privacy that they value
If everyone is ok with that sure
Every step removing privacy brings the world closer to complete lack of it
People have private lives you should respect it
But not everyone so you shouldn't force unnecessary things on them
Like i said their choice
It should still be their choice as long as they aren't public entities
Ye
Ye but shouldn't you ask for everyone's consent adding that cause privacy exists
This is basicly a dumb question so i won't even answer it
You going to force people to share information about them even if theg refuse to
But what if they don't want to share it
Taxes aren't the same thing is information on people
Cause that is for example like data that is useful to identify cars for example in case of a robbery
Like it should be their own choice cause forcing stuff onto people telling them it will benefit them and ignoring the fact that they may not be ok with it is not hoe you should treat the world
And they may just not want to share it
It's their private information
Doesn't change a thing
<:FujiShrug:774321937173315614> his choice to say it not your choice
Cause unless he is a public entity it's private information and if you want to know that much then ask him or smth
It still should be a person's choice and not forced on them
And you shouldn't just throw it out of the window in one case cause you think it's unnecessary
But privacy is still a thing
So you think neglecting people's rights just because some people think it will benefit them is okay?
Why do you refuse to accept that not everyone is okay with private information becoming public
And it should be respected
It's a person's right to have privacy
Like i said
But if people just aren't okay with it then it's just unnecessary change that probably wouldn't matter much except for dividing people and making insecurities worse
Apparently
I come from planet earth in the solar system
I don't think we live on the same planet
<:NatsumiStare:713180925197942844>
Idealistic is the view that showing the inequality between people will magically make them work together and force the world to be how they want it to be instead of dividing people
But the more differences you show between people the more they divide
All i can see here is idealistic view on people
Not everyone wants to
If you want to live in a world like that than go make one
Go and try convincing one country to it and become a politician then if that's what you want to do but i don't think i want to stare at this idealism anymore cause that's just disappointing and not even funny
I feel like this place is just a bunch of people with idealistic view of world who keep saying they will make the world better yet don't seem to be going anywhere with it
<:NatsumiStare:713180925197942844>
Germany could not be trusted as an ally overall
with both sides wanting to invade each other
ye you see how it ended
it wasn't possible to be beneficial
ye but nobody was dumb enough for it
ye but that clearly wasn't a good idea
play perfectly how it would benefit Germany?
like what was UK supposed to do
with 1 member ...
the allience wasn't that impressive
ye
when France was invaded
ye but i don't remember UK rushing an army to France
he kinda conquered half of Britain/France allience
the closest that went to underestimating was british airforce and soviet abilityy to rebuild their armyy
the france part wasn't that underestimated
hitler at some point probably stopped trying to win a war that much
but it kinda didn't go that way for multiple reasons
that was overall the plan to just target countries one by one
ah yes and germany attacking UK itself wouldn't be enough of a reason to continue
it can be shortened to just deciding who invades which part of europe if i am not mistaken
but not everyone is you
you say you think
you think is pretty important here
i am not saying it should but if they can and they believe if they don't it will hurt them then it's pretty predictable they will
you mean you don't want them to be a global superpower and make sure nobody else is?
cool but you shouldn't expect people to do things that go against them you know?
were but can you prove that they wouldn't be a potential threat to US?
these 2 were pretty much enemies
USSR wasn't realy an ally to US
i am not saying it's justifiable but logical
that isn't even being world police but not letting an enemy be a bigger threat to them
was the US supposed to just let USSR grow it's sphere of influence to cover most of the planet or what?
if i am not mistaken he copied his look from older party members
wasn't his ideology just parts of other together
Hitler wasn't even original at all if i am not mistaken
ye ye ye Germany locks itself US companies just take a small part and leave them in Germany with different name and stuff like that happened
love the fact that fascists took a liking to having socialist in the name
Hitler had plans to conquer pretty much all of Europe so
ye but that wouldn't have them as permanent allies
i don't think you have ever seen how multiple poor post communist countries looked before and after joining EU
<:NatsumiStare:713180925197942844>
like simple you join EU you follow the EU rules and if you don't you will not get some of the benefits of membership
you lose the benefits of being EU members when you leave simple
they left pretty simple
i don't remember EU holding a knife at UK for brexit
you can just leave
kinda logical
like if you join a group you follow the rules
ye but you aren't forced to join
yye
i don't remember EU actualyy forcing stuff on countries tbh
if you have debts isn't it kind stupid not to try and pay these ?
so you won't be precise with change from what to what ?
the exact policies
be precise
name the nations and show precise events that occured and crushed nations autonomy
also Russia pretty much cut off resource supply so not much to lose
as far as i am concerned everything that goes against Russia can be considered a benefit here so <:ChenShrug:924013423363231844>
yes cypher it is but it's human nature to be hypocritical
but that's assuming banks won't have any trouble paying
but what if the private banks failed at it
being EU member > not being EU member
joining EU was an absolute win no matter how i look at it
could have built homes with this money tbh
or overanalizing the most random cases
or doing absolutely nothing
i think they are going this deep into the problem
ye but like if they require 30 million $ for this
you can blame it on evolution for creating people
<a:kyarusmh:962916222779945011>
but everything in a country relies on people being there and doing something
unless you are completely blind to what the world is it's quite a difference
cultures exist
people exist
you can't make a place good if vast majority is against it
ye but then unpopular one would be to get an absolute dictatorship with a leader who will make it better and rule the entire world removing history culture nationality and everything like that to just rewrite the world removing all that will or even could make people be against each other indoctrinate peace and tollerance and make everything owned by him then sharing the riches between the people
If i am not mistaken
Extremely orthodox religious group doing their stuff
Just say the king/queen
That just means there is a correlation but not one caused by other or both with same cause
Does he sell ice to iceland or what?
But isn't cancelling cringe?
Of a single person making most of these
Ye
The famine was mostly cause by a certain single person's decision if i am not mistaken
<a:MayuriPeace:758718452155809854>
Now i leave this neo-communist meeting cause am pretty busy
The main communist state fell apart and couldn't even survive
Communist countries were poor relative to western countries
Communist countries were filled with indoctrination and propaganda 
Using military against civilians
You try to make communism great despite how flawed it is
What is your point
So
I never watched fox
