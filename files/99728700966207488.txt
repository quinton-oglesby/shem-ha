I have some bad experiences in the general weeb community and they pointed me here. <a:flutternodharder:480357620172193830>
Hee, thank you. I suppose you can understand why I was invited then... I heard this was a pretty nice anime community <:thumbsupcat:471601096696135700>
Oh, heya. <@!99158582326497280> invited me, told me that it's a nice and welcoming community and that I'd enjoy it, even if I haven't watched the show.
Such a good girl <:traaheadpat:360209299458228236>
Ahh I see, it cleans up after itself. Such a responsible bot.
Gacha, gotcha.
Howdy howdy~ I haven't actually seen Symphogear before, I should look into it. Oh, which channel is the best one for botcommands? Off hand assuming general-commands.
I hope you excuse my ~~american~~ Canadian anime horses, I come from a distant far away culture called Equestria. We are strange and foreign, but we try to be friendly.

Thank you, you have all been very warm and welcoming! <:hugs:465530574426341402>

Thanks, everyone <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Oh it's my favorite Dragon.
I'm more of the mindset that a little bit of sickness isn't *that* bad so long as you're not infirm or too young, as it *does* help build a healthy and active immune system. The problem is that isn't exactly accommodating to people with compromised immune systems.
My husband works in a medical labratory and saw that article and immediately said laughed, as he knows that *everything* people touch regularly has got trace amounts of poo on it.
