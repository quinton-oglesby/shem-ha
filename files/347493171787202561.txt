It seems very likely at this point
PTSD is strong with Tsubasa
She’s not mentally ok rn
Considering he kinda invited her in their phone call
I wonder if Tsubasa will go to Fudo next episode
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
If they continue to refer to previous season she might go against Maria or Chris
Ghost kanade just needs to be there to snap her out of it aha-
And Airgetlam
GodMikus only goal is to talk to Hibiki again
Yea sounds like something that could happen
But more like he’ll say some bs about bass being a failed sentinel or something
AND GENOCIDEE
Fudo is just like all according to keikaku
Noble red really thought they did something when they used Daedalus end huh
With all that copy and pasting she can have infinite memories
And now infinity memories
Ah
How would they redeem Millaarc though
Where do you guys watch the episode? Besides premium acc on crunchy roll
I intend on doing that
Ah I haven’t watched it just spoiling myself through twitter
||I only saw Millaarc and Elsa was Vanessa there too? I didn’t see ||
||i have no idea why he did that tbh ||
Ahh I have to as well
||when his sword broke though ||
Lmao that’s so true
||Can someone explain what happened with Genjuro when Basa attacked- twitter pictures have me confused ||
Alright tyty
Sorry but how do you put spoiler tag? I’m new to this-
Oh wow-
Oh my
I laughed
His face when it broke though
That’s a fact right there
She’s probably got a secret hardrive
Basa’s scene had me emotional but I’m outside with my family and I can’t tear up now ahhh
It might happen again if Fudo isn’t arrested
I wonder how they thought they could take the god power for themselves
Tsubasa crying made my tear up
The knowledge from movies taught him a lot
They might just activate offensive for the rest of the gears in the end
Maria made sure to bring her wife back
Tsubasa would flip
He’s gonna have a burn mark now
It’s always displayed wdym
Ah makes sense
They skipped her birthday give us her graduation instead
Just have the girls living a normal life would be a nice ending too
Hopefully they leave it as just one important figure to basa
He needs the bloodline to continue
I wonder what happened to the anatomy there
Maybe last episode might
*oh f-*
When he realizes Miku has been released
Ahhh my feelings
There's a slight chance
She might not be killed
Not too sure if they thought it was gonna go so smoothly
~~Defintely would've been better if it was Millaarc who got pierced though~~
It wasn't shown on screen but it definitely was hinted
She might not be dead but maybe Miku did kill her idk
Yea ig
Attend a Tsubasa concert too
That’s the most you’ll get atm
Unless you listen to the live 2018
It's a good song
^^

~~When your friends don't watch anime either~~
~~Lmao when you’re the only friend who watches symphogear so you have no where to fangirl except here~~
**A noise is approaching**
I listened to it on the symphogear wiki
Yep
~~**If she survives Shem ha’s attacks**~~
~~I don’t see why not~~
Symphogear XV went from rank 99 to 88 on mal
Oh god I completely forgot previews were out today
Who made Shirabe this handsome
Oh my god I was wondering why people were suddenly drawing Maria disguised as basa fanart-
Is that weird
In the preview picture with Maria I thought it was Millaarc attacking her
In what context though
The one I can think of is half fighting and second half training
||When Fushichō no Flamme came back omg||
I need a Doctor oof
My heart- ahdifkdksng
Poor Basa
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
||Suggested by Maria aha||
**quickly slides through the door**
Giant robot
https://twitter.com/symphogear_xd/status/1177493074705965057?s=12
There's more
I'm in tears woo
On my god
||^^||
||uhh she kinda just popped up with SSJ||
||Imagine how Chris feels||
||^^||
||I thought that Chris attack looked strange I didn't know it was referenced lmaoo||
||omg||
||yeahhh kinda sad about that||
||I mean Carol's protests from 4koma can come to an end||
||^^ my thoughts when I heard it too||
||Tsubasa throwing her hair made me laugh||
||How did Miku transform if she didn't have a pendant?||
||I need a full cover of flugel song rn||
||oh true I forgot about that whoops--||
||I'm not the only one who though Shem ha would pull that "I'm Miku again" stunt right||
||we got a Serena and Kanade cameo though||
Mk
Is it safe to mention parts of the episode yet
I need both
This episode really played with mine
Would be a cool future for her though
;-;
Now it's over
Mhm
^^
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
||Do you have the Yatsuhiro and Kanade one too ;-;||
^
||I thought Metanoia would be a better attack tbh but eh||
Indeed
I mean I count them both as characters
ah
Lmao and Tsubasa fans too
||Miku is also flatter than Tsubasa funny enough||
||At least Tsubasa got to visit her dad's grave||
I watched the livestream
||I mean we can't see his eyes||
||Mamu||
I mean to be fair symphogear is pretty underrated
Ranked 37 whoa
||I'm not 100% sure about how school works in Japan||
||I mean I don't think she graduated yet right||
It's implied that she is but they didn't show it on screen
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
In the end we never figured out what Miku wanted to tell Hibiki huh
~~Movie~~
^
Kirika was mainly a clown this season smh
Hopefully we do get one though
^
Who is singing in the new ver besides Miku addition, or is that it?
Miku tossed it into the Nephilim
Got thrown away
Noise have been dead for a while
Yeah same
I hope if they do make a movie it'd be like either a zwei wing prequel or time skip
Is it weird that I thought they might have brought back Fine through Kirika
I laughed I'm sorry
There's not much point in using the gears again tho
It is Carol's body
How did Miku use SSJ in the end
Basa had anazimg scenes huh
Some songs releasing in January 2020
The heck do I do with my life now
He’s laughing at how songs can’t save the world while gears save the world through singing
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
They had a different x drive
I appreciate how Hibikis scar just moved south and enlarged in the last episode
Speaking of that
I mean if ever they want to pop out a sixth season you know <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Same energy as pikachu face
Someone will make it eventually
Yeah I get that
“The song in my heart is telling me to change the tall mountain records again”
And knowing Hibiki she’d try to get Miku a ring worth enough for her
Hibiki doesn’t earn enough to buy Miku a ring yet
Ah
Wait I’m dense what was implied that Miku and Hibiki were gonna say
I mean at least Mikuand Hibiki finally saw two shooting stars after5 seasons
Ignite strengthened he gears against alca noise
S1 opening
Is it weird I thought they might’ve included that into the ending
Or GX I forgot
They used it up in axz
Strong enough to eradicate a god
Metanoia is a deadly hug
There has been someone in twitter putting on accessories on symphogear characters
Has she ever addressed Hibiki by her actual name
Shinai Chris be like we gotta keep this straight
Ty
Ohh
Like lighting?
I’m a bit under a rock but what’s dimming
Oh
How different is the BD from the aired one?
Sameee
^^
What about beef stroganoff
Oh
What’s SoL
Ever think they’d ever do a prequel of Maria and Serena before FIS
I mean like without any gears fighting  during or after the concert
I want to see a Tsubasa concert that finishes to the end without any issues
Another season I wonder what they’d do that that point but I wouldn’t be against the idea
