The thing is once I have those I think I can actually at least try to help people here
For awhile I think that'll be most people. The ones for Power/Int Dr. jiis would be good too, but I'm still a few level off for both of them.
All I need is mats
My chris is lvl 60
So Mega red, Rainbow, and whatever those galaxy looking things are
The ones for the Power chris everyone has
Tried to help with a carol raid, did like no dmg <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
*not carol
Well I'm starting a hard Power one if anyone's interested
Well so long as someone's willing to help
*remembers my attempt that only did 35k dmg*
I don't have a lvl 70 yet, just as a note
Zoop
Hey so I need Large red and rainbow mats, which raid should I start/anyone able to help?
I filp between like 3 different ways of talking about things in this game due to terminology changes.
Also I mean a Body I can actually get without praying to gacha
Yee
still no event Pink type ; _ ;
<@!145234510684880896> Ah sorry got you confused with Kartis. I'm following you now
A tad overkill
Btw I've just been using 5cp for battles mostly, (not using cp refill just yet) that ok or should I just go with 3cp?
Trying to get that myself <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Nice
Yee helped with a couple of your raids (all 35k dmg of it...)
I believe I'm already following you
I just need to finish getting event currency and cool off from making raids myself for a day due to some frustration that's really silly
Hey so I just cleaned my friends list a little, who should I grab and if anyone wants to grab me just @ me here if my list is full and I'll try to make room. I'm not going to be super active discord-wise or starting my own for a day or two, but if I see a raid I can actually help with and spare CP I'll see what I can do.
It‚Äôll be like 20min but I‚Äôll give it a go. Haven‚Äôt seen what that fight looks like yet
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
Oh you meant 670 dmg not 670k dmg
I'll try if I have cp rn
Yeah that was my frustration, connection issues during that week so I never got the chance
I'm currently f2p right now, just waiting for a deal that's reasonable/event I actually want
Yeah but the Maria body wreaks
Or maybe a chris booster one, that'd work too
I'm just praying for a banner with a Body 5-star I can actually grab
Thank
<@!107532017809260544> hey can you remove a follower or two so I can follow you back?
K
Why are we worried about bans?
Yes
Ok it‚Äôs up
Just starting
Give it a moment
Hey anyone want to help a hard power raid?
That was my last raid of the night. Thanks everyone!
One day we‚Äôll be able to help people instead of leeching
That was semi meant as a joke, i‚Äôm sleepy
<@!96113323279421440> wanna help me kill a hard power boss?
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
3 giga reds. Thank you <@!127991170201681920>
Memoria are just kinda helpful
On the mission screen you can tap the portraits of the enemies and it displays the name
I personally thought of advent battles/pvp
It is a group heal. That‚Äôs real good
I kinda rolled a bunch on the shirabe banner for 4* blue and 3* red dr jii
Mlb I think would be better
3* red shirabe is good too
You can take top 3 easy
Hard power 1/2 dead
The carol just landed a ridiculous amount of stuns and silences when I need to heal and in general
Ok dex carol is oppressive
Got it, thanks!
I think karu‚Äôs the same
Same as my discord
Or two? : D
That explains a lot
I'll look for it, thanks
oh it wears off, but what buff/debuff symbol tells you that
I've noticed in the advent Dex battle, after he uses the Kill beam or whatever in his awakened form, my shiabe heals for zero once and then it starts working again. that one feels like a bug tho
Tomorrow I'll do raids, going to be busy with events rn
I was short on Giga rainbow until a random green carol raid gave me 5
Also yes one sec
Yep
Thanks
Room now
Give me a sec
i should if I don't I'll make room
Ok it's up now
Sorry if I've jumped the gun
Well give it a moment, i'm still in battle
Same as discord
Can I get help clearing some Power bosses? I just need 1 more Giga Melody Crystal and then I'll have my first 7 star
That's every power boss what are you talking about
So commiting 4 cp refills for a raid that you know will finish isn't a bad idea
Highest damage, Hunt, and starting the raid are the 3 that are most likely to get you stuff
Ah
I suppose but where is the buy button? Or am I just dumb again?
i would whale but current deals are crap
Red carols are currenly butts to do unless you have 5* body maria or 5* event Basa, not enough Body cards out yet
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Now to do so for my other power and two int cards
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
I GOT IT
oh it died (I'm still fighting)
and I mean 4-5 times at 50k apiece
of course that's still not guaranteed
the thing is if you start one and attempt it 4-5 times people actually start helping sometimes and then momentum goes from there
one giga melody for mine
Now pray for my RNG
Thank
Room now
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
just noticed
How is this not an emote here

Thank you
Yea me to?
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
Well it is only 15 gems so not the end of the world if you don't want to spend a lot of time on it
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Also I missed that same weekly mission last week due to the same mistake
Good luck
Yeah, if you spend 1-2 cp refills you can probably do a normal raid by yourself no problem if you have a good team for it
Could you do a normal? i can do like 200k to a normal red power boss with the 5cp option
if you can kill them in one go, just use 1 cp 3 times
Bruh why didn't you just use easy raids at the start?
K
<@!256214824109867009> lemme make room in my followers
5 CP is most efficient too I think, ~4x dmg with 10cp instead of 3x with 9cp or the 10 3x dmg option.
So I just go for it
I have an excess of CP refills and buying more in shops is easy
So just figure out what 3% or 5% of her hp is and do that. I don't know if getting the higher contribution rewards gets you better odds for gigas though
Yeah, at that dmg level I go for contribution (awarded at 3%/5%/10% total damage) and then stop
Ok
<@!256214824109867009> If ya want to get one started I can help at least somewhat, once it's started people usually pile on after not too long
I mean I could help you with those but still not great, (I'd like to have LU Body shirabe to take out one add to make that easier) Also probably cc
<@!120363283151585280> Can you help with Body raid or are you too busy/don't have good cards?
Power dead
Be there in a sec
I need maxed Shirabe for CC
And I'm far from maxing the event welfare card
All my tech cards do Phys dmg instead of special <:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
Gonna mlb the event Shirabe
But then I can help Int and Red Carol raids
Well if none has a Power raid for me to help, does anyone have a decent team for Body Raid? I deal 25k dmg and need the Giga mats
I probably shouldn't
Because I feel bad
Any Power Raid I can help with real quick first before I ask for help for my own thing?
Hey so sorry I haven't been here for awhile got burnout on the game a little
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
People are too busy with CC
There's no way I can fight my own efficiently so I'm just hitting any that look good
I'd help but busy trying for body mats
Wait you mean like with Sanic nvm
Body Raid perhaps?
Miracles is what he's trying to get
welp
I'm blind or something, it also doesn't help that 90% of the names are in Japanese
I have a list of all events lemme go see if I can find it
I have no idea, but I think he said it was fairly early
It's the Two relic event I think
Save your üê≥  for that particular one
But hey giga dex will be good for Tama miku if you go for her
I fought like everything once
You should have seen me when I needed one giga rainbow
I need other things first
Gonna be fun when I need to get Miracles and magic myself
I think it's rice and oof 
I think Coffee is for AP
Every little bit helps right?
And by that time I should actually be able to do Power Carol raids (and green too kinda)
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Thanks
too bad I can't send you like 20 of my CP refills or something
Oh yea way better
Phys dmg also being 1/2 or more of all tech units rn
yeah it resists Phys dmg hard
Great. thanks dude
was that on 5cp?
Guess lvl 70 just kinda breaks everything
100k Noice
Holy crap Halvrave
I do that with one of my healers in the power raid cause she tends to die otherwise
Try putting her in the last 6, boss usually blasts your team in the first couple turns, have someone die and then bring her in for a heal
awwww
You want in?
<@!177328724759281664> Body raid is open in case you missed it
5* green Miku that's busted in PvP.
Tama Miku, whenever that comes out will be great for that
Opened Body Raid
<@!177328724759281664> Also if you have any decent Tech Special attackers put those and a healer in your team, burnbasa will be good for this if ya got her
Also opened up follower space
I'll open one in a moment
Noice
I know but also haven't seen that many people going for raids that have super high dmg and such
Need burnbasa
HDK just started a body raid, please pile on if you can
Blue is way too low to just be Carol
Well the thing is after I LU a couple of my units my inventory's going to look like that in a month
>339 giga reds holy crap
Like small/med, not giga
I had a crazy idea of having an event shop where you pay your awakening mats for stuff
Probably not the best of ideas but could be cool
Like it's nice to have 26 rainbow in stock since everyone uses them, but I just want 5 giga body.
Looks like I should go and LU my XD jii first though. I'll start raiding again tonight
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
I think the game is messing with me this week (weekly missions this week are rainbow crystal)
All giga mats I've gotten so far are rainbow, and I just tried the Rage raid twice on normal and solo cleared them...
And got nothing but rainbow. I just wanted to see what my 4* rage chris would look like at lvl 70
As far as I'm aware, we could get one tomorrow
Thankfully Dex Raid is easy because after 4 5cp rounds I've done almost 900k dmg
Imagine what'll happen when I LU my XD jii
Insta dead adds
Imagine if we had actually good dex units at this point in the game
I still have 100 rice in stock yikes
I assume next month you're going to grab all the rice from the shops
Wish people who start raids and deal decent dmg would do more than 1 run at least
Trying to kill Dex raid rn for Giga fantasy
But Dex is 200k per 5cp so no prob
No still need Fantasy Crystals
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Needed one Giga body
Got all I would've needed at the start in one go
Need to grind Fantasy crystals on dex raid now because I got zero
I know small reward
You can pound Dex into the ground at least
How did that happen? Only grabbed Kanade and XD Maria or something?
I'm saving for VER but also spending gems on XD Maria(tech) (since she'll be back eventually) is super tempting
Yeah but I don't feel like üê≥ for Chris, like another 5 rolls or something for the next guaranteed
The event one
Once I get LU Body Shirabe who wants to do Int raids
Not Power carol though, she can wait
I should go back through wiki events again
There's a pirate event soonish (though that might get moved to summer) that has some dex units
Getting Ignite Chris is üê≥  tho at this point
This shit again
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Two people came in and killed it, I did 63k
Oh. Also level 70 Kimono jii only deals 1200 dmg with skills to add
I mean I'm really not doing much dmg
Slowly
I'ma kill it
<@!263392442345193472> want help?
