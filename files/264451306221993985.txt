I got to the point where I'm only missing 2 Giga Crystals to 6 star LeviBasa, and then suddenly I can barely scratch them
That recent update really made a difference
Yeah, I can imagine the Hard ones are tough
hey, so how does this chat work? Do you just ask people to dogpile a boss?
so you guys going for the X Drive Bikki unlock?
click on the server name in top left
reee
either way, better safe than sorry
huh, I transferred twice so far, and while I did generate it before both, the code was the same
on that topic, you genereate the code once and it's set forever, right?
should be some space now
if you hadn't removed anyone since that previous message then you don't
Body raids are hard, man
<@!292700103544930315> your int is about to die
the next event is supposedly coming very soon
for the xp quest you can bum a lv 70 from somebody, makes it much easier
yeah, the first story mission is weirdly good right now
wait so are basic attacks a separate damage type from special/physical? Kinda weird
Is the int raid resistant to phys damage?
contribution caps out at 10% right? I got a lost cause here and I dunno if to go for more
the weird Fine? Ye probably relic
desire sensor is real
ree
that's my 3rd 5* LU, just had the worst luck with melodies
finally! jesus
I'd absolutely watch that trainwreck
To be honest their hair is very similar
cursed
she's even doing the bang
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
Bikki doesn't play around
and a camera feed of Hibimiku's bedroom
dear lord, fluffy Chris
yeah, but she used one solo later to juggle Durandal
oh, and Ignite bow
even through GX it's missing her cluster missiles, dinky pistol, and beam cannon from 1, and Ignite missiles from GX
even with all that it's missing a bunch of stuff
we all do
everybody's gay in the symphoverse
man that's some great hair on that Bikki
good point
did you translate it?
thanks
<@!263983345669505025> Would you happen to have a source on this one?
ah, here it is https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/336297674707828747/656146592541311008/1576505083671.png
Anybody got that fluffy winter Chris one?
what hasn't had an idol show crossover at this point
feels like a game show
hard to tell
Tsubasa without her apostrophe? What is this blasphemy?
if it's in context of Symphogear art it'd be hilariously ironic
When I was making that stitch I forgot where her right leg was, and for a moment thought it's the bottom left sword
How about Fine?
What happened on 1.1.2019?
Damn, that's a good Leiur
Damn, those doll DMJiis are getting a lot of good art
wait that's not edited?
Hibiki-san to Hibiki-chan. I hardly know this stuff, but I believe the change means a closer relationship?
What's that DMJii from? It's more than similar.
in a post klk world there's nothing to be conscious about
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
looks like something out of r/surrealmemes
alright but what's up with the lemon?
man I wish ^
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
dear lord

it's fine, thanks
Is that posing Maria a reference to something?
uh... it's not incest if she's from an alternate universe?
That Basa reminds me of MGR
Zombieland Saga Geah crossover? And it's not Junko==Chris? That's rare
The amount of fanservice this season makes me hyperventilate god damn
Wasn't it the other way around?
let's hope?
X-Drive Bikki's got Saint-Germain's red plume
believe in the Ichaival in your heart
pull off a gun array like Metal Wolf
or an avenger
Yeah, I hoped for a cannon honestly
