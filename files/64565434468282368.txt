dess_timely
my one gripe is that there's too much Strike Freedom greeble on the legs to make them into proper striped thigh-highs
lighting situation sucks, I know

Dessscythe assembly complete
not that big a loss here, but I need the dark green stuff to be super stupid slick to match Kirika's usual geah shading
I think I lost some gloss on my Dessscythe's brighter green pieces going from Testors Glosscote to Dupli-Color Gloss Acrylic Lacquer
changing rattlecans mid-Gunpla: not a thing I was hoping to do
or maybe clear coat singular; I dunno if this Testors can will stretch through the whole kit on two coats
I can do clear coats on my Dessscythe's contrast colors now
oh thank god yesterday's showers are finally evaporating
no, Ismail (the one from 00)
`>And Marina`
maybe save Kudelia to kick off a series of joke pacifist 4*s (Relena with oddly high Shot ATK, Marina with an actually good auto-repair, etc.)
you'd think they could pollute the 2* pool with like
Biscuit, Eugene, and Crank
Andy Waltfeld has the following several distinctions:
```
- pilots one of the Gundam franchise's very few quadrupedal robots (the LaGOWE)
- does custom coffee brews as a hobby
- has a cyborg shotgun arm (only after apparent death following first appearance)
- the only innocent soul in the Cosmic Era timeline
```
at least pilots aren't limited ever since they added Amuro to the pool at New Year's, so I can eventually get Wacky Coffee Zoid Man later
usually I don't 10-pull for pilots but for the Tobia/Andy week I made an exception and topdecked Tobia
Judau and Kou
I think I've gotten two 4*s from single pilots in the last week?
I just chase event multiplier and sometimes the daily pilot singleton gives me new dudes
sometime when it's finally released
I need to remake Cherrim Gundam with as many Cherudim/Cherudim GNHW/R parts as possible


that's one way to make Marsfour arms look good
when's Reverse Bunny Armor Bael
(complications from being framed around Susanowo Legs)
I have a pretty nice "Xenoblade 2 Mythra/Siren" one going but it doesn't map to 100% of my melee parts quite right
also when's more custom palette slots
when's Epyon EW Sokai
we need Heat Rod for a proper Airgetlamh whip
attention IRL Gunpla/modeling nerds: Woundwort, Hyzenthlay, and Kehaar II just opened up on US P-Bandai. Also US has a P-Bandai with working Gundam stock now https://twitter.com/BluefinBrands/status/1252403510240395265
especially Johnny, the Arms, the Shield, and the Zook
Gundam Breaker Mobile Players: Arena Shop changes with the v1.04 maintenance Tuesday night; buy out all the copies you need of Johnny Ridden Gelgoog parts
Unfun Fact about the GN Partizans: I tried to coat their fold/unfold gimmick pylons in gold too. This resulted in two of four clips breaking from overpressure, but also in rail tab/slot connections thick enough that they're still stable in folded mode
probably my first shot of Dessscythe in passable lighting

was trying to go for a Praxis livery here but I think I overbrightened the powder blue

nostalgic for the parallel universe where Gundam 00 came out in the 90s and Taco Bell ran a concurrent promo campaign
fun fact: these are *the same* palettes I first made when dolling up kits during the Throne Drei event (the red on top was eyedropped from it and made brighter and more metallic)
Going into tonight's new GBGW event with about 350% multiplier and 450% swag
my Siren paint scheme has evolved with the power of Soft Horny
preferably in the same month they do the Cross Dimension 0079 HGs so I can call in just the one transaction
can't wait for P-Bandai US to start going through a decade of backlog exclusives and spin up a run of RG 00Q Full Saber
a lot of the Late 2019 The Origin kits, basically everything from Build Divers Re:RISE older than Jupitive/Mobile Doll May, and the Exia Repair II I need to outfit a Shin Avalanche Exia Dash
though that reminds me the FLGS got in a positively orgasmic Gunpla restock
I don't recall if the HGs had the universal 2-peg backpack system that early
00 backpack, head, and Raiser on Exia everything else
I keep wanting to use Marsfour arms for the defense bonus but they keep getting outbid by arms with offense EXes
you never know when something like a Build Fighters/Divers kit has leftover pieces from whatever the original suit was and you can build them in to get another couple of functional parts
always save spare polycaps
that's "your choice of" all the things you can do with the Beam Tomahawk
if it's not X'd out in the manual's runner guide, it isn't truly "extra"
release welfare Super Custom Zaku F2000 cowards
I want a Dead End G with actually passable stats and/or "with Axe equipped" support
https://twitter.com/ShoujonaCF/status/1254627699563339776
they'll be absolutely essential for RGs with as many reflective stickers as they use to brighten up exposed frame joints (RG Nu Gundam is notorious with them as of late)
so you can also use them for things like Gundam eye stickers, 00 crystal-reflective panels, etc.
preferably ones with narrow points like in the cosmetics aisle
tweezers are a great way to mitigate that
that'll definitely be a Sokai release
Sinanju (and/or Stein) had a pommel-to-pommel double Beam Tomahawk thing going
...oh right
```
assorted Gelgoogs: Mass Production, Cannon, Jaeger, and Johnny Ridden's are already here
Astray Red Frame Custom: I guess they're saving BuCUE Head for Red Dragon
any 00 Gundam: I guess GN Sword II [Twinblade Mode] could be relegated to the vanilla or Seven Sword/G release
Sword Impulse: literally unplayable without Excalibur dualies
Strike Freedom/Infinite Justice: twinlinked Super Lacertas aren't what they're remembered for but OK
Akatsuki: see above; Oowashi already got a single saber so why not give Shiranui doubles
```
and who the hell gets to debut with Naginatas with the code technically laid down for 'em
place your bets now: will Snow White Prelude get in before Double Rifles are implemented
someone's got a case of the Out-Fighters
maybe use them as replacement Narrative Gundam arms or something; I can grab a C-Packs and have everything needed to build the rest of it without the Psycoframe pieces
see what newer kits look like once I finagle its grabby claw sub-arm forearms onto them
>old-ass GP03S
I've actually been intrigued on and off lately about revisiting that myself
polycaps are the most common leftovers because Bandai has several generic runners of them instead of tailoring them to a specific suit (PC-001, PC-100, PC-102, and so on)
that leaves us...Arms, Legs, Ranged, and Shield to put EXes on, unless for some reason you want Vulcans
hypothesis: AGE-3 Fortress Body (+% Shooting Power @ Long-Shooter) + Buster Head and Pack (both +% Shooting Power @ Power)
oh hell it's a Devices event tonight
but if we get another good Sokai welfare in the blueprints tonight like Susanowo or Strike Noir...awww Tony in heaven, you gonna wish you didn't
I didn't even try and blitz the three during a month of the Abyss event since Gouf Custom was so shit
remodeling all my old welfares to Trait Lv10 is gonna be the death of me
*several hundred Skip Tickets later*
that or Garrod is just *that* good; I haven't pulled him yet
this Out-Fighter fixation of yours is getting out of hand
now including a total of 12 Standard Tickets if it logs 50k Friend Battles across the whole playerbase
don't forget to beat on `JQJSL8R6J` for fabulous prizes to be awarded at a later date
(and also jury-rigs a P-Bandai HGCC Gavan Gooney's Borjarnon out of the HGGO Zaku I mold)
I swear we'll be able to use them in your Ingressa Militia diorama as soon as Bandai finally backtools Regular Kapool from HGBD Momokapool
1500% multiplier in 2 10-rolls
so AGE-FX banner was surprisingly generous
hell it's a crapshoot most weeks whether a Build Divers reprint will come with Nami or Ayame
my usual local and online retailers only ever stock DBZ FigureRises
yeah but like
are these a thing Bluefin acknowledges exist, orrrrr
very glad 30MM inherited those to a degree
I miss the AGE EFF grunts' hyper-utilitarian box waists
I still have no idea how many actual blades are in play, between squadmates/kit debris still being in each shot and overall color clashing on the main suit
[rifle and Funnels sold separately, and they couldn't even make but the two articulated ones at that]
...oh, you had one already in the pipeline, my bad https://twitter.com/HobbySite/status/1272325525889888257
https://www.1999.co.jp/itbig66/10667783z5.jpg [below, during two-handed pose reassembly]
Alus-E3's beam rifle just has incredible furniture if you leave off the Halo Chamfer Shrouds
then I put together an Alus Jupitive and got a clean-looking git
wasn't too hot on Alus Earthree Gundam's "Planets System Adaptor" head only having purple stickers available
https://twitter.com/ShoujonaCF/status/1274874496328110084
downside is, this means I can't cleanly remake the micro missiles either
...probably moreso for better than worse, I won't be able to remake the Double Beam Rifle because its barrels are part of the quad cannon/beam saber pack array
>the outer head uses almost all old-work pieces
tempted to use the original ZZ V-Fin instead of Tryon's Daitarn-ass kabuto
tedious but not wildly incongruent
the little calf vents [stickers 5 and 1, x4 each] are exactly the same as the HGUC ZZ ones
>29 numbered and 7 duplicates
at least we're not looking at damn IBO Sticker Toes here
lord I hope it's sufficiently crowbarred the HGUC Double Zeta mold into passability
picked up a Tryon 3 to commemorate pulling the GBGW version
hi kids, it's Umi Tryon
I've still got Japanese series logos on kits from the FLGS's April-May restock (probably pressed in March)
*looks up*
those are some hecking new IBO boxes
and then POTP gave us those claw-pads that required a Voyager's extra pad to work as a foot
the toys in general were great
but the combiner hands/feet barely peaked with CW
sad that they got worse for CW and POTP
I forgot how goofy the High Moon-WFC combiner extremities were
leaving him standalone, or plugging into a Bruticus?
Option Weapon Set 1 for Alto comes with a nice kukri-type curved blade
theoretically, I guess you could use some 30MM option sets for that
but there's no easy sword handle-to-3mm peg/post adaptor you can use to make a clean set of Swordchucks
what drives me nuts about Binder Gun is it comes with a full set of Ballden Arm Arms' ball sockets and hinge joints
ANSWER ME DOMON. ANSWER ME DOMON.
so as it turns out, Mobile Haro and Haroloader share the same 1cm shoulder joint peg
and Loader's arms are surprisingly flexible
they pump them out in so many colors (two main armor tones, an accent matte for a dedicated joint runner, and flat gun gray for accessories) that painting isn't really a needed thing
the big sticking point is needing an Option Weapons Set for every 2-3 of the same figure type, but that's more on Bluefin for being behind the gun getting 30MM product at large in stock
a lot of polycap-less joint tech from HGAC Leo and the like, and most parts gating is thin enough to not need serious sanding
they're pretty high-spec for what you're paying for
Mortarnova in the front is the result of Space [White] and Navy having a perfect match of gray off-pieces, and took the Red's B runner for optimal monochrome visual signature shenanigans
Gafranova in the back inherited the cannibalized Red's burgundy offsets and an HGBD:R Injustice Weapons set
the lanky Red Cross Portanova in the way back is the oldest; I didn't care much for the gray offsets on Space Type [White] so I started swapping in armor from a spare Red I picked up while cleaning out a closing Barnes & Noble
wasting no part of the buffalo with a trio of recent Portanova builds
they made a Zeta retool for Island Wars and put Fin Funnels on it that double as bird mode wings
bird mode vaguely reminding me of Scramble Gundam
"what if Navy Blue Portanova, but with an Injustice Weapons set"
pre-gaming my Uraven/Saturnix Amazon gift card buy with some 30MM chicanery
debating converting one into a Harodolfr of some sort
real talk, apparently 30MM is getting tank kits now that double as skiffs for the main figures
...holy shit, was not made aware Koto did a reissue of Metal Gear REX in March
ah, Amazon was doing the thing where whoever translates the Alibaba listing has primacy
quick Amazon search says Lafarge
I want to say some manner of Hresvelgr retool
I wanna say some manner of Frame Arms with the very Kotobukiya instruction layout
back in my day, Kotobukiya just forgot to inject enough plastic for a couple of detail pieces on the runner and we rolled with it
most of the Revoltechs were made back when Kaiyodo was still doing cut joints for hips
Max Factory's Dynamic Change series have fiddly connectors and require parts swaps with retailer pre-order parts sets
SDCS Shin Getter 1 doesn't come with Stoner Sunshine parts
man now I'm reminded of how basically no Getter toy ever can handle the sheer enormity of the Getter Robo in question in a single SKU
you just need to dig up SB-1 saber blades from Tryon 3/ZZ/etc.
the larger saber handles used for its shin beam guns can actually be used as beam sabers
speaking of Seltsam, I think my favorite thing about Tertium was its easter egg for the any-day-now Gundam Mk.III retool
finding my favorite thing about the Core Defensor to be that its handhold lets you actually do human shield things with it
"I found you, Faker!"
you get the perception of detail depth without drawing excess focus to it
one tip I usually hear for mostly-white kits like Barbatos and Unicorn is to use a soft/light brown or purple instead of black for panel lines
one of the main features of each review is conspicuously thick panel lines to show off each kit's scribing/molding/panel seams
Dalong is a Korean blog/webpage that does model kit reviews
I dunno if it's just IBO designs going ham on the scribing, but it feels a little Dalong Thicc
or maybe Silver Bullet Suppressor can bolt it on as a spare arm with some HG Customize Campaign joints after it goes through all its other right forearms
looks like it belongs on something like Master Grade 00 XN Raiser
what even can you do with it on something that isn't Astray No Name or another Astray retool
forged from the finest Jovianese steel that Teiwaz could let fall off the back of a freighter
I keep wanting to think this is the katana off either HGIBO or MG Barbatos 4th
yeah but the more appropriate Rhongominiyad LR is Saturnix Weapons
and by the time I set up the MHXX catalyst, it'll be in a more dignified pose than "pelvic thrust with the Hyper Satellite Cannon threaded between the legs"
but it's done, and the stickers are all done to spec
in retrospect, picking X Maoh as my "I'll just snapfit this while waiting for AP to refill" kit tonight was a bad idea
I built this for an RP and the DM demanded I seal that true name because she wants to not actually have me as a player
you might recognize the silver-on-deep purple paint from somewhere
hidden compatibility with SB-1 round-pin beam sabers
[Daybreak's Bell intensifies]
my concept is "we turned Exia's option sets into Victory core block shenanigans"
...as long as we're stuck with the delay, how interoperable are the arms and legs with Amazing Exia?
I've got an Exia Repair II and Avalanche Exia Dash waiting for this eternal "we're predicting rain all day but it only actually falls around 5 PM" season to cease
this includes...all of HG00, all of HGAGE and HG-Reco (despite the box front boilerplate), all of HGBF prior to Island Wars/Battlogue, and the first 160 or so HGUCs plus P-Bandai offshoots
it'll be a cold but refreshing day in Hell when Bandai Hobby goes back to every mostly-modern kit first run before Unicorn OVA Episode 5-ish to redo the manuals with English liners and cautions
tell 'em I'm working on Revision 7[H/M] close combat macros
if anyone asks why I made the Armor Schneiders from the leftover RG Strike runners

digging out rivers in the Weeb Desert of northern Indiana
needs more Flauros [Ryusei-Go] flank guns
rather than turning into Silhouettes for each other or for HGCE Impulse
Arc and Lancier's crime is that they combine doing the Bawoo/Victory Gundam/Transformers Energon thing
is this HGUC Banshee/Norn [U] or RG Norn
and also the Windam Nuclear Striker doesn't come in MG either
needs more Heavyarms Igel for that
Barbadess
>Use Decal 6 freely.
here I was worried the made-from-spares DODS Rifle wouldn't have an optic
(...oh, this is canon apparently)
the plan, basically, is to build it as an AGE-1 Flat (kit contains full utilization of the AGE-1 Normal runners) and bolt the Zefuld/Glastro Launcher pack onto it Striker-style
digging an HGAGE Gundam AGE-1 Full Glansa out of my backlog; trying to figure out whether the Glansa armor can be a slip-on/slip-off deal like most Gundam NT-1 Chobham Armors
I guess that counts as Technically Strike
I want to say Granddad had a Core Fighter but not a full Core Block System since they were more focused on nailing the full inner frame at the outset of RG
is this one of the GP01s or Strike or Impulse
tiny pilot in a Real Grade-scale fighter jet seat, Gundam livery runners
Hobby Lobby gets their Gunpla from Bluefin; it just doesn't look that way because they had Bandai Star Wars kits for months before Gundam/DBZ/etc. stock
the mustache arrived in late June between the initial COVID freeze on foreign freight and Bluefin fulfilling requests from the factory instead of cracking open shipped stock to cannibalize
I used it toward the start of the year when a HGCC Turn A came without a mustache
Bluefin has a "send replacements for Gunpla parts" form, but you have to be meticulous in evidence that A) you got the kit from a retailer served by Bluefin, and B) the parts you're replacing aren't a result of user wear and tear
"You want a piece of me?" "I'LL HAVE TWO!"
I can never tell when new Super Minipla drop because Bluefin only ever imports the Power Rangers ones
is this a Super Minipla or Bandai doing one-off retro HGs again

I forgot how hard Black Luster Gungnir [Normal] hits on account of his base level is 60 and most of my INT squad isn't
that's on a Deuteros night probably, so no big loss for me
at least the Normal one
efficacy not guaranteed on Carols
I am always down to drop like 300k on Kain Highwind in one CP10 set-and-forget
might host another after some Hexa runs

I guess it's very early starting

you don't HAVE to solo it (though wacky worm is weak enough for it), you just have to be the one who started it
"without an aid request" is somewhat misleading
it has to get to 0
whomst one of you is IGN "Murcielago"
trying to hit a Hard Power but can only manage 80k per rice bowl
JetBasa can't solo steel Autoscorers
I'm just hitting a raid owned by Murcielago and wondering if it's owned by anyone here
...I don't follow?
I'll do wacky worms for the raid weekly and despite me running P/I hybrid for it, the profile will be anything from my event team to whoever leads my awakening daily
Profile is just whoever your last leader in an AP/EP mission was
that's for your Support
not to be confused with Wacky Worm, which is actually graded as Easy but doesn't drop any Gigas
and I thought all of those mainly used Finesses from the other new raid
...but why bother dropping Training Crystals if you're not going to run the Otonaverse event(s)
I'd put my chances at being able to solo Normal with 2x5 runs at 50/50
yeah, XD Serena is very much non-optional
...here I was thinking Instant KO was a more dangerous status
but of Otonaverse Raid Finé's three Skill1s, only [Taste the Despair!] detonates it

I don't think Bandai will let the Precure division get that horny yet, but it's awful close
it's basically those two
but does it eggs

you aren't ready to have a conversation about post-financialized government alignment

Twitter is only marginally useful as a substitution for that kind of IFF because only the richest, most well-insulated 20% of valid targets get blue checkmarks
the boog cannot reach a state of kinetic implementation until we create They Live glasses, mostly
but also there's private citizens doing the work of what's ostensibly a supranational unaccountable post-government regime (i.e. self-policing in ways that incite demographically motivated violence/neglect like in Portland)

you'll get GP series with Orchis as a BAF completion bonus ~~requiring P-Bandai GP00 to finish~~
but apparently not so bad they'll give it a whole remold like the F91's recent MG 2.0
so bad they made replacement joints part of the P-Bandai V2AB expansion kit
the absolute shittiest joint QA on top of the usual "MG ver.Ka" whining about proportions
Levels of Commitment:
```
Gradeless 5-6 inch kits: ~$10 price tags, shitty single-hinge joints and peg-in connections
High Grades: $15+ based on part count, very stable everything with a few occasional odd paint separation choices (Barbatos sticker toe hell, etc.)
Reborn One-Hundred: $35-60 simple 12-inch renditions of suits Bandai still wonders who the hell even likes. Like anything from Victory
Master Grades: $40+ with a head height of ~12 inches, usually with backpack span or other chonk justifying the higher price too. Good unless you wanted Victory 2 Gundam
Real Grades: MGs but shrunk to HG form factor, with no real price difference till you hit P-Bandai releases/effect sets. Ironically better the less they rely on ultrasonic-welded premade skeletons
Perfect Grades: I don't think Bluefin even orders these $200+ boys in
Metal Builds/Hi-Resolution Models: MGs, but now there's diecast metal and Kotobukiya-tier obsessive pre-painting! Occupies the PG price point for Bluefin
```
I hear "Ranka" and wonder if this is equally applicable to Macross Delta
Fawn Farsia never got a retool from the original
oh yeah the other mortal sin of Gundam AGE
it failed miserably but at least the later Armored Girls Projects from other IPs were good thanks to the development lead time
Infinite Stratos was a psyop for the collapse of Busou Shinki so Bandai could say Masaki Apsy wasn't needed in the robot girl action figure industry
how did Amuro [The Origin] even place
I thought the anime adaptation of The Origin cut out after Part IV/right as 0079 TV starts up
will probably make one a Midas Messer with leftover gold paint from a "cover up Hyaku Shiki's terribad swirly gold" job
dumbass plans for HGUC Messer

MAD WANG 1160
it couldn't possibly be a Crossbone series
just making an X1 Full Cloth cameo for Build Fighters TRY probably ate half the show's budget
oh joy
even more entirely new model molds that'll be P-Bandai
so if you wanted to do a proper sunsetting of Psycoframe Hax as the plot device of the UC 0090s with Hathaway's Flash, the only way that still leaves an opening for F91 and beyond to happen is something that tries to finagle Gundam X's conclusion of "OK maybe we're really fucking up in our treatment of Newtypes as living weapons supercomputers"
which is a theme that kinda falls flat with Hathaway's Flash
SORE DE MO ("EVEN SO") is Banagher's catchphrase for "you may have a good point but I'm supposed to be Young and The Future and I have the Newtype Hax to prove it"
Hathaway's Flash But SORE DE MO But Also No One Learns Any Lessons sounds like a lot of counterproductive work

THUNDERBOLT: An ongoing manga/net animation production that asks "what if Gundam but everything had dustproofing joint covers, but also exposed sub arms for holding their shields instead of dumb cavalry/samurai bucklers?" And also "what if Gundam but both sides got Really Fucking Serious about using child soldiers outside of Newtype experimentation?"
THE ORIGIN: A six-volume manga and a trickle of net animation releases that start back deeper in the late 0070s, mostly pivoting around Char Aznable's growth from scion of a purged noble faction within Zeon into one of their ace pilots. Retcons a lot of the Federation's slow MS development to the point of giving them very crude Guncannons and Guntanks around the time of the Battle of Loum (January '79)
THE ACTUAL ORIGINAL: 50-ish episodes or three movies covering the period from September to December 0079, primarily from the POV of Amuro Ray commandeering the RX-78-2. Everything looks like the future as envisioned in the 1970s, and like it was drawn in the 1970s

IBO Season 2's problem is they totally misread fan reactions
"Oh, you didn't like all the character assassinations in Destiny? What if we made them *actual* assassinations"
Ichika has been dosed by Belldandy all these years
change my mind
(I mean yeah it's already announced as a Metal Build but)
time to unleash GRAHAM GUNDAM
crank up that P-Bandai tooling, boys
adaptation of the stage show?
*stirs coffee*
to answer that question, first we need to talk about parallel Kiras
...did AGE try to do some wacky 3 cour thing, or did Asem's arc get season-split?
I thought Gundam 00 ran as 2 seasons instead of cour-by-cour
leading to Zeppelins, C-130s, and the Supersonic Transporter coexisting in the same Alliance/OZ fleet
also the air power doctrine outside of MS is "All Of The Above"
so you've got no capital ships or other "named" transports like in other series, except the Peacemillion
particularly fond of After Colony's "Mobile Suits are a thing, but anything resembling a post-1920s navy isn't"
how much closer to the manga does this bring One Piece
is it going to be like a Tsubaraya/Toei YT release where they copyright claim themselves the second subs are added in the Captions
they haven't made Anaheim Girls' Love Project canon yet
Gundam Build Diners

I need that "Hail Hydra" redraw of Saitama going "100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 10km jogging, and 100mg of anabolic steroids a day."
Cute Girls Getting Cute DMCAs
at this point I just don't touch anything running in Jump on principle
Build Divers Re:RISE has the right of it
the continuous downward revision of the shonen primary age group and its consequences have been a disaster for anime
because Type S is supposed to be a thing girls grow out of
uhhhh.....Qwaser?
should've put that in Berserker Static instead of ROT13
>caseless rounds
>but after-images
what the heck were MICA thinking
a hecking relic, but I'll allow it since the HGAC is another three(?) months out
this old lad came with a bunch of weapons that were concept art-exclusive https://www.1999.co.jp/eng/10020414
and even that I have to be delicate with because no reissues ever
the last Koto kit I did that didn't feel like a dropoff in plastic quality was KOS-MOS ver.1
of course now you have to track down the HG 1/100 for its twin saber, lance, wire hammer, and rocket pistol
but they kinda screwed the pooch on hardpoints for a potential P-Bandai G-Falcon
which in all honesty is worth it
$30 sounds more like HGAW Double X

A WAIFU WHOSE PANTS ARE DESTROYED IS DISQUALIFIED

and the shield itself definitely didn't have that functionality in GB3
I always thought it was cool that V2AB used it to project a "V Laser" Special Shooting attack in G Generation World/Overworld, but it isn't acknowledged by Gundam Wiki as a thing that exists
weird retro question I need answered as GBGW is about to have V2 Assault Buster Gundam debut as a limited suit: did Victory Gundam ever feature V2 Assault's Mega Beam Shield being used as an offensive weapon?
yes
the "new Love Live group name vote" above
if you're not voting Linkle to force Koei Tecmo's hand, I swear to god
*looks up*
yeah but like
I thought they already did a side manga about the cells of a slob compared to the original work's human
Attack on Nicotine?
so what's this installment's gimmick
