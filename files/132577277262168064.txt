yeeaaa skill lock has been kicking my ass
hey i was wondering if there were any tips to get my girls "raid ready" and not melted on entry
Not poison
Faint yea
Theres a hibiki that can clear poison
GOSH
Fine. Ill take yours then
<:KanadeSit:535301654464036884>
Ok imm take a seat
Wats best way to get resources when you have no LU items for 6* and no 6*s?
Its the truth
O.o
The gearocolypse
...after i exaust my EP
been at an event all day. Time to hover the raid screen
Wait theres dexterity units in the game?
5 giga o.o
~~lonk~~
oof

wait theres dexterity units in the game?
lul
i should purge mine
o.o
the most imma be able to afford is the commander pack ;-;

<:3540_Aqua_cry:587464760895995928>
how do yall have so many LU 6*'s while im hardly able to get 1..
Obligatory
"wait there dex units in the game?"
<:FudouEyes:672846284725682195>
ahh
and whats hunt o.o
so as a non-6 star owner i should be gunning for  Discovery, Participation, and low contrib?
what do you have to do for that contribution perk? I sometimes get it and sometimes dont after poking
not yellow boss
nono like yellow health bars
oh? been just looking at the yellows/reds
i barely have dmg tbh
for someone who dosent have a single 7* yet, is poking a hard raid and praying to rngesus the best way to get giga melodies? I feel like im doing it weong
Sadly i still cant do that much ;-;

Most relatable line in the anime
"I DONT UNDERSTAND A WORD YOU SAID!!"
__yet__
Same. I didnt know i was that deep into the fandom yet
Ikr
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
she is in THAT stage of life
where on the spectrum do we protecc or lewd?
so like
so true
too late
it was pretty lewd
https://youtu.be/tQsOqg32Y7o
lmao
thats why she begged maria to join
she was having it already
cuz she always back
and we got best girl transformation
they still get nosebleed seats
nah
and they arent holding punches on bloodshed either
yeeep
the Gs
gx
g-revolution
why cant we go back to when it was good
terraria level yoyo moves right there
there has to be purpose
for the music to change like that
just give it to me
so how much longer do i have to wait for my shirabe x kirika transformation
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
i expected kirika to just cut a hole through the boat tbh
ye
<@398201668338057216> smiled way too much at that right there
üí¶
I hated that. It was not ok. It was not
Ahh a Raz fan i see *sniffles*
That was cute tbh
Best faces
I love kirika period
Kirika gets alot of things right tho tbh
she is DEStiny
That she was right
Which was funny
That was a joke tho
At first it was the other way around tho
Shh kirika is independent, shirabe has started to become pretty dependent tbh
<a:KirikaBear:493835576659935232> <a:KirikaBear:493835576659935232> <a:KirikaBear:493835576659935232> <a:KirikaBear:493835576659935232> <a:KirikaBear:493835576659935232>
FITE ME
Fite me
BRUH
Exactly
You never make kirika and shirabe compete
So far whats the best transformation do yall think??
Oof
With the song in your heart
Then go save the world
I second that
Yo that last 30 seconds confused the FUCK outta me
I chuckled
He was ALMOST perfect
Was attempting to make a perfect one ye
Only perfect one is the philosophers stone
DONT REFERENCE
NO
STOP
Chris shelter girl
Sooo tru
SHH THERE ARE TOO MUCH ADORABLE CHARACTERS THIS SEASON
Ended like why did i sit through this
It started like omg this shoutld be great
Bye
Yo jojo last eps is out
Theres like 2 i can say were decent
Every season *
<@239893407122718721> i dropped all of the isekai eps1. But symphogear isekai when <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Man i didnt watch anime for 2 days, and now i gotta catch up to all these seasonals ;-; brb
Really? Ive mostly heard G
Thats a first
I cant tell if that was a joke or serious
And we arent even at the fun stuff yet
Im loving how alot of the fights this season has that final fight feel to them
Im waiting till they power drop that info from the pevious seasons last 5 min
Hibiki gets to do everything
Isekai is as potent as marvel is in theaters
Lets go back to .hack
Isekai harem trash is passive aggressive 
Generic harem trash is aggressive af
The new season is really good after kirito cuts a tree
Tbh SAO is on its redemption arc rn i have to say
and hibi was not having it
lmao
not inside tho
can i get a F in chat for tsubasa?
soo
like alll major events caused some cancellation
yeaaa
yea
^
we are talking about the country that cancelled 3 anime cuz of the earthquake a few years back
japan is hardcore respectful
they always evac pretty damn fast
they evacuated
wait no
you might be right
wait
watch him appear this season for no reason yet again
^
i kinda like them except for robobitch
got 2 kills doe
"fodder villan"
but my charizard..
they already put out there that they aint scared to kill a bitch this season
this season is ripe for it
dude
or it might be in the beginning of the next season
i dont think tsubasa killed cuz she wouldve been in a much more perilous midset at the end
F
F in chat for snowman  being the alt. sacrifice
^
cuz japan is respectful as fuq
me when i see shirabe transform
https://tenor.com/view/yes-jojo-anime-gif-4921582
Like holy fck this season is a mofo treat
I smiled so damn hard this whole damn episode
^^ **My body is for aiur**
Bro this aint even the end im just ABSOLUTELY LOVING this season
It was but it wasnt a XV cliffhanger where they drop a huge event at the end
And not a cliffhanger that makes me rio my hair out
Its a painful wait but i think this eps finally gave me actual closer
Lmao
Now thats a statement
OwO
One of the rare ones
You consider occultic nine a 10
there

https://myanimelist.net/animelist/AnimePhionex21?season_year=2019&season=summer
Actually lemme just update my MAL
Ugh lemme get up and check
do i have to catch up again frig
why am i hearing  this everywhere
my head man
and did u say the prequel has a movie?
cant we say prequel, original, sequel, and sequel movie?
dude these names be confuuuuuuuuuusin
NoWaSuYuMooGoo
not to mention i unknowingly binged yuuki today  UwU
last time was "that scene" from march comes in like a lion S2
<@138380189741744128> THATS WHAT IM SAYIN. Its been a min since ive watched something that genuinely made me cry
(looks at the discord server's name)
maybe cuz its a little similar to another anime i like
idk but something about the Yuuki Yuuna franchise makes me want more
ill put both on my list
i see them
oh
theres movies?
mkoy
prequel or sequel 1st
u good
i have a rule of not watching seasons back to back so imma watch something else then it
we have tools now to make a death person hear sound
ya know
wait
oh
2 years ago
wait didnt WaSuYu just come out?
why must i bring myself to more heartbreak tho
it wouldve made me cry too much more
ye
and the ending felt like the writers were just throwing us a bone
i only say that cuz i just finished yuuki yuna is a hero and im over here bawling yet again at yet another dark magical girl anime.
yo why does anime make it, like, illegal for magical girls to have a happy ending
Oh ik
YuYuYuNoWaYuWaSuYuKuMeYuYuYu
mkooooyyyyyy
oh u meant seven deadly sins
"shenanigans"
name
...fine
NOT THE DEPRESSION
IM LOOKING FOR THE LIGHT
but its good
tears part 2: idk why i watched this damned series if all imma do is cry my ass off
i wish it were that easy
^
when you watch the prequel and you know what certain things mean but dunt wannit
i just want ppl to be happy
some ppl are too busy being depressed bout yuuki yuuna
its an extremely popular anime so thats real high doubt
good dose of depression
ok im watching yuyuyuyuyu prequel
Cant believe hajime no ippo is still goin
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
berserk spoiler:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
AHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
Maidens in their savage season for my slice of life boner
Grandbelm for my magical girl tragedy boner
And symphogear for my over the high power action boner 
GOD DAMN i do not deserve what we are getting this season
Dororo op2
And ill watch the movies tomorrow maybe
In dont remember who i was talking to about yuuki yuna but i finished the wakaba manga like u said
but its ok, its finally over..
cried my ass to sleep
i regret binging Yuuki yuuna season 2 before going to sleep
amazing movie, but why the hell i chose to watch this in the morning knowing full well i gotta function the rest of the day is beyond me
So i watched "I want to eat your pancreas"
