I have three max LB 5* that I want to LU
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Is it the power of the 🐳?
Don’t know how you guys manage to dish out that much damage in one attempt
To both idk
Yes<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Makes me wonder, did you manual it or did you set it to auto and left it there for a while?
Halp<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
So, the 3*?
Cuz I need more<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
What’s the best way to get more normal medals for bowls of rice?
Question
<:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392>
Hng, okay fine I’ll chip in...<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
And I have a limited amount now
But I need to munch on another bowl of rice
Which one?
<:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397> <:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
I want giga fantasies
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
Raids are weird and I can’t read results normally
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
Since when did I have 11 giga magic?
Wait...
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
Same
I was kinda waiting for the next event to come so I can get the enhancements
Also I don’t have any high lvl Techniques at the moment
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
Ik, which sucks cuz I only have to copies of her so far
There’s the 4* basa that cures and heals burns
Yes the dragon is a pain in the ass
It’s the kimonos’ kiri and Chris
The other two are the main problem
If I think about it, I wanna LU x-drive biki cuz I might have enough lvl 60 Body’s to attempt a few times
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
I need HALP<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
So....
Cuz I don’t have all the materials
But I can’t
You dont see that everyday
Thats new
