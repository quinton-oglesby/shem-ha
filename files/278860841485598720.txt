personally I'd use something like DMJii or Zabba for <:ShirabeHeart:738932033635483738><:KirikaHeart:738932018116821034>
Just makes them easier to use
My personal take on the paired emotes is that a shared name is better
That's a high quality edit
I could move mine over
Do you still need boosts?
We're helping <a:02derp:465210481326686208>
but give the first one the second's name
second
<:ChrisUgg:671982993195139094>
I kinda want to just leave this here too
<:nadePeace:568014372413112340>
trust me
They don't need a use
Look, I've almost filled 5 nitro servers, two of which are 100% Monogatari emotes
true
<:ChrisSip:660514247935000576>
<:heh:496448769185808435>
Like emotes need a use when you can just store them on your infinite nitro space
<:KirikaWow:741181236181205013>
I saw this and I had to
sorry
I thought he had more boosters than just me
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
If I pull one from my friend's server it demotes
Because discord removed boosting from base Nitro

It's also just kinda a low quality image compared to most of the emote here and that's noticeable even on the mid size image

It's a Japanese artist so I wouldn't even know where to start honestly
Pretty sure that can't be added though since it's an edit of an animation and not an anime screencap ect.

Kiri fish feels like heads
It's a work of art
Seriously though, that's too good to go unused
<:FishBuck:766905646989049866>
And I did this
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
I love that fish and no fish ended up tied, that's just votes on this server in a nutshell
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
Chris should be on the heads side because she's clearly the Queen
We have Queen Elizabeth II across the Commonwealth
Yeah, that's true too
I mean, that's what I love about fish
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
I'm in favour of more fish
<:hsiFakiriKGrayM16:747781779645136918>

<:ChrisPout:660514247733674021>
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
To be fair, that's like 90% of what's talked about in general voice at all.
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
The only room I can think of that might be useful is an AMQ room since we tend to spam up general voice a lot, but I'm pretty neutral towards it
<:NoU:445962567509344279>
<a:02derp:465210481326686208>
I'm dumb, ignore me
If we're going to delete it may be worth having an emote server just to shift them too for Discord whales

IK we did, but there was drama with the artist so now we don't

<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>

Honestly, anyone who uses <:SongStone:688213224012644370> is probably whaling discord too anyway

It's not impossible, it'd just require you to be very careful
You can see a decent amount of Hibiki overlapping
<:MikuKiss:738240587014340649>
The issue with the idea of anyone with anyone else is that two part emotes unless they're really specially made tend to hang over onto each other
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>

Fair enough
and "metre"
Just a suggestion if you ever modify that function, it should probably accept the spelling "litre" as well
I'll try to remember that but probably still use google, let's face it
cool
Would be nice to actually know the conversion command though, the amount of times I've just sat there wondering what the hell a Fahrenheit is is astonishing
Just make it randomly pick an obscure imperial unit instead and convert to that, people clearly need their height shaftments
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
That's a shame, I totally would
<:ChrisComf:660514247754907648>
There's so many chibi emotes already, having a few regular series emotes is nice
I kinda prefer <:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>

From my understanding channel access can be removed on an individual level if you really need to anyway without making it blindingly obvious who is/isn't underage

I want to try doing some more stuff with my Japanese anyway, so trying to work this out would give me some motivation to actually do something
Ye, that's when we use translaters notes <:heh:789431887135113241>
Do you still want translations for theses by the way Lily? I could probably make a list of them to put it in one place if you'd like.
They just go in the order they were added I think
<:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
Such a random frame
<:ChrisYikes:679341065878241292>
I still love this though
Just ping <@456226577798135808>, there's a decent chance they still have the original screenshot it's from and can either post that or make it a touch larger.
but larger emotes still look better
yeah, a multiplier scaling would probably look better than like, a random number
Glint's a little blurry even on my shit screen
I just noticed that the Shirabe one had small text on it I couldn't see in thumbnail form
great thanks
<@!106866895076003840> Do you know of anywhere where I can view full sized versions of the line stickers?

They're the same size as inline text emotes from the looks of things, so any icon that's recognisable inline would be recognisable next to the name
gotta respect the effort

Not everyone can have Swedish or Dutch level English
Yep
Yeah, not going to run into that too soon
not over old ones
I think the idea is that we'd add them as new roles
I don't see why that's an issue. People have non-server emotes in their names already and you can't, so far as I know turn them off
~~Is the fish cult a faction~~ <:KirikaFish:717138469381734471>

It may be a good idea to rename anime club to something like anime and manga if you do that, because intuitively I think it makes more sense to discuss manga in the book channel
It's OK, 90% of what you're missing is just tanks and live blogging of absolute gutter trash anime

NZ hasn't had the US's gun laws in decades. There's been an enforced, nation wide firearms licence in NZ since 1982. Very few countries have gun laws that look anything like the US. NZ just banned semi automatic weapons for anyone including licence holders 2 years ago. <@456226577798135808>
Hey, our idiots are pulling ahead right now, could be worse
And generally speaking most interactions between species trend towards parasitism, not mutualism. I'm using parasitism here to mean better for one party and worse for the other, yes parasites still have a benefit in keeping their host alive for a time while they reproduce but they're always advantaged by taking more. The best parasite doesn't actually keep its host alive, it kills it as it reproduces, favouring a less mutualistic and more extreme form of parasitism.
Symptoms of viruses are tied to how fast they reproduce and how fast they spread. A virus with a higher viral load will typically have harsher symptoms and harsher symptoms such as a stronger cough which can be bought on by the virus doing more damage is directly advantageous to the virus spreading. You can't just separate these things out, it ignores the way how viruses function. Yes,  completely silent virus that spreads without us even caring is technically perfect, but a slightly faster spreading virus that kills the host is still actually genetically favoured if nothing is done to impede it. There's not really an evolutionary advantage to keeping the host alive after you've already spread. It's the fact that we can act to stop them that makes an undetectable virus preferable.

Spanish flu reduced in how dangerous it was because after WW1 we stopped letting it just spread freely. We constrained it and because of this relationship less deadly symptoms were favoured. The second and third waves were treated using extensive quarantine and distancing measures. Especially the third wave when WW1 was completely over.  The third wave was less deadly than the second, yes because there were structures in place to deal with it set up during the second wave. They were far more effective too because the war was over.
That's not true, diseases that are allowed to spread uncontested tend to become more dangerous because there's a benefit to them doing so. If no-one's stopping a disease then the best way for them to reproduce is to reproduce faster, induce their method of spreading more strongly, create higher viral loads and overwhelm their hosts. Natural selection just favours whatever can best reproduce and a virus undergoing a quick reproduction/killing off the host strategy will outcompete a strain that isn't in the short/medium term. The second wave and third waves of Spanish Flu were far more deadly than the first so I'm really not sure what you're talking about on that one. The first wave actually didn't have mortality rates much higher than a regular flu.
And that's scary as hell
<@!160142617940590594> viruses directly respond to how you treat them. Selection pressures act on viruses with millions of times the strength as they do on most animals due to their super short generational times. There's almost 0 chance of Covid drifting to become less dangerous, the way at least the US is treating it is actively going to make the virus more dangerous. In a case where there's no control being applied viruses that are more aggressive, reproduce faster and have harsher symptoms are actually favoured.
Covid in Aus has been interesting, we basically had it under control then the government started to lift restrictions and we saw an immediate second wave
Look, if the mods were competent the community wouldn't have been such a toxic shithole in the first place
Do you know what the biggest fuckup of this was? That they didn't communicate with other anime subs to bring a wide ranging ban on the word
IDK that much about Warhammer though so I'm probably wrong
I thought he was before that happened
Biggest youtuber got outed as an actual nazi
Ah yes, the Warhammer community
Another really large issue is that the term leads to a lot of trans denialism within the anime community, where even the blatantly obvious cases of trans characters like Ruka from Steins;Gate are called "trap" rather than "trans" and this helps to feed into some very troubling world views.
Banning the use of the word trap, it's been a long time coming
Oh, animemes decided to pull itself out of the gutter somewhat
which I didn't fully understand at the time but I do now
Also, my mother hated it and didn't really like me watching it
I'm lucky that I just never found it particularly funny
and like, on most servers you'd be attacked for mentioning how problematic it is
It ingrained itself so deeply into our culture that it's taken years for people to even start questioning it

It never really got big in Australia
I really don't know about ASiP
But yeah, most people are really bad at recognising satire. The amount of people I've spoken to who don't realise that Futurama is basically all anti-capitalist satire is astonishing.
but the stance it takes is still extremely right wing
which is Cartman
It satirises a competing right wing ideology in conservatism
It doesn't really satirise the right wing though. It comes from an extreme right wing ideology in what Americans would call Libertarianism, what the rest of the world would call Liberalism
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
The main issue is the way they handle their subject matter and treat important issues ranging from climate change to gay and trans rights with contempt
No

Also, don't forget American exceptionalism
South Park did a hell of a lot to push them though, being an influential show it also helped to introduce the topics to children who otherwise may have had more time to actually understand the topics if something like South Park didn't exist
not going to argue against that one
Yeah, the debate format's generally dumb as hell
<:ChrisUgg:671982993195139094>
But there's still more of a barrier to attending a debate and people are less likely to drive away those with opposing views in person than online, it still happens sure but it's easier with the cloak of anonymity
Yeah, but it's to a lesser degree
It allows people to quarter themselves off in small communities with homogenous views and ignore the opinions of others while assuming they're in the majority in a far more efficient manner than they could in a real life setting
I don't share your optimism about the internet at all
yep
He also often represents immigrants though
Apu is certainly victimised in the show, but not in a "laugh at the foreigners way" (which is how South Park would have handled him), more in a "these are the problems immigrants face" way.
And while Apu is a mess of stereotypes at least he's normally a sympathetic character
I'm probably biased though because the Australian Left has appropriated the Simpsons to an extreme degree
The Simpsons was much more of a mixed bag
"Let's make our trans character (however poor they're written) into also our Trump figure"
Which, the more you think about it is just completely fucked
Because capitalism doesn't actually like gambling legislation so it moves as slowly as popular opinion will allow when it comes to expanding it.

That sounds absolutely horrible
I'd take their Liberals over our Liberals (conservatives) or the fucking Tories any day
and their "default" is better than Aus or the UK anyway
Canada has the NDP who are a politically viable left wing party
and also implemented other anti monopoly laws around media to force media to stay smaller and less crap
is more what I was getting at
But NZ and Canada can have actual left wing politics because they actually banned Murdoch from their media sphere
I'm aware of both
NZ and Canada although not perfect do far better than Aus, the UK and US
It's not commonwealth, it's where Murdoch has an influence
I've been a Greens supporter for years now but they don't have to make it this easy
come on
Like
I've basically given up on Aus Labor at this point, fuckers came out in support of expanding fossil fuel subsidies to stimulate the economy post Covid
At least they don't lie about what they believe consistently

With smart policy the earth can sustain 10 billion people in middle class life styles easily, we just can't afford to have insane wealth
The US objectively has the resources to manage a post scarcity society. Just on a purely economic front the US manages to pull 62,800 USD per person per year. That amount of wealth allows them to purchase anything they'd need within an equitable society. It also ignores the US's insane food output, abundant natural resources and pre existing nuclear power capabilities.
War for a poor country can legitimately be about resources, when you have as much as the US it's just not
For countries like the US which is entirely capable of moving to post scarcity with the resources it currently has it's functionally the whole story. You could make arguments about the rich wanting more, but they have methods to gain that wealth which don't require war. The war is used primarily to create a military underclass and secondarily for geopolitical control. If the goal was wealth extraction the US can do that without war.
Poor workers who fight wars have more in common with the poor workers they fight against than the rich commanders on either side that give orders. War is an example of subjugation of one's own population as much as it is a struggle against a foreign power. It's an attempt to make people unjustly feel a sort of kinship with their own oppressors.
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
I just don't view that as a solution
which is why I'm also for booting Murdoch
Yeah, for sure
we'd move towards the former
at the moment we have the latter
then there's "fuck you"
Like, there's neoliberalism but we're going to pretend we care
we'd still have a pretty crap neo-liberal government most likely
I disagree, getting rid of Murdoch would get us to the better side of neo-liberalism
Plus, it's worked out great for NZ
I just want to see our country shrug off some American influence in general and booting out their military is one of the best steps we could take towards that end
Australia in my case
Personally I'd be in favour of booting the US bases off our soil
Sometimes it includes asymptomatic
Like there's always a range
Most viruses that aren't like Ebola level fatal work that way

also, Post-scarcity is a theoretical economic situation in which most goods can be produced in great abundance with minimal human labor needed, so that they become available to all very cheaply or even freely. Post-scarcity does not mean that scarcity has been eliminated for all goods and services, but that all people can easily have their basic survival needs met along with some significant proportion of their desires for goods and services.
*and companies have been collecting phones for platinum for a while now because that one is worth it
It's actually, even under a capitalist system a next 10 years tech though since it gets cheaper every year and mining rare metals gets more expensive every year
The tech to recycle all the valuable elements from phones exists already, it's just a little bit too expensive to be done at market rates currently
If you don't have the option to obtain a house on the hill, Hendrix's banana or front row tickets scarcity is once again removed, that's why capitalism is the enemy of progress

I feel for the animemes mods though. Actually tried to do something decent, even if the way they handled it wasn't completely ideal and just get fucked by their community because they're immature children (literally and figuratively).
An upgrade you mean?
Entire game has always just been a shitty glorification of war anyway
What's new
CoD and having shitty ideology plastered all over it
BTW, you said you were a socialist before, a social democrat is not a socialist
The KKK were fascist before fascism was codified just like Jesus was a communist before communism was codified
well, you probably can't have fascism without authoritarianism but you can have authoritarianism without fascism
The two normally go together but they don't inherently have to
I'd argue that what you're talking about is more authoritarianism than fascism.
The type of racism we're talking about is mostly systemic racism. It's where society is crafted and rules are created in such a way as to advantage certain groups while disadvantaging others. Within western society there are large advantages to being white and small advantages to being east Asian. Other races have much harder times doing pretty much anything because the way the society is created is to disadvantage them. This is the reason why you can't just look at everybody as the same, it'd be great if you could but it's just not accurate to real life.

Secondly Nazism (more accurately fascism) is an ideology with very clearly defined traits. A fascist society is one that uses race as the dividing line between who gets to enjoy the benefits of society and who is punished by society in the same way capitalism uses wealth. The two obviously overlap as well. It's actually not an uncommon ideology and has been becoming more and more main stream over the last few decades. We've reached a point in the west where the right is openly fascistic and the mainstream left is becoming far too tolerant of it. 

Finally "Believe all women" doesn't mean you don't investigate. It doesn't mean that you don't have fair trials. It stems from a place of understanding that the vast majority of rape claims are true and that to not believe women is inherently very dangerous. By taking claims seriously you can get women the psychological/medical care they need after a case and give them the best shot at a fair trial. To be clear, I don't like when this philosophy is used to carry out vigilante justice, but that doesn't make it not important. For far too long women have been going completely unheard and we've just been letting them suffer.

I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt here, because at one point I think I would have said fairly similar things. I just needed to learn more.
I think there's also a point where you can just look at the statistics and think "this is just beyond fucked". It might not apply to everything, like maybe you don't feel it as much with employment for example, but when you look at things like rape numbers of women vs men or police violence against minorities it's just too fucked to ignore.
yeah
I mean, I can sympathise without fully understanding though
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
Oh boy, I missed the good chat
It's also because it helps men to better understand what women face. I've been considerably more watchful when I'm with female friends since the Smash shit came to light and I started to read up on this because I became more aware of just how common it is. If every man had that there would be significantly less rapes and sexual assault cases.
I believe you are the only one making that jump
Has anyone here said to jail people without evidence?
sexual assault is still massively underreported and underprosecuted.
The metoo movement hasn't achieved its goals
And the reason why social democracy isn't socialism is because it's still a fundamentally capitalistic ideology. A socialist is someone who wants to get rid of capitalism in favour of, shockingly a socialist system. You can't be that if you support capitalism. That's why I say social democracy is just a centre left branch of liberalism.
Lily <:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
Here's the difference. A set of ideologies and definitions within fascism exist and people actually do follow them. There are also open neo-nazis (JFC what a world) I have never heard of anyone who defines themselves as a cultural Marxist even on the fringes.
OK, here's how you can tell it's not real. It's a supposably left wing ideology that is only talked about in right wing spaces. No left wing spaces even humour the idea. You will not find left wing commentators who talk about the idea as anything other than a joke.
Please do not mention it again
Cultural Marxism is not a real thing
Shemmy, while I get where you're coming from I do not think that this is remotely helpful
It is not, it's a branch of liberalism that infused itself with some socialist ideals
just a little bit of terminology
There is no country on earth without an economic elite
You still totally do
You do though
at the expense of literally everyone else
The US economy was created by rich, white, slave owning men to advantage rich, white, slave owning men
you can't undo that economic fuckery without better social equity
The economy is created fucked to disadvantage certain groups
Wrong way around
Then why wouldn't you believe in things that aid socially disadvantaged groups?
An equal society is a horrific thing. Imagine if you payed equal taxes to a millionaire. It's technically fair, but it's not functional. What you actually want is an equitable society.
There's levels of proof and things that one person considers good enough may not actually be legally solid. Evidence that will not convince a court will often convince people.
No, no he did not
Bush expanded Gitmo you know? Literally a concentration camp and a violation of human rights. He also rolled back environmental reforms and he started the war on terror. Under a pandemic he'd have been as bad as Trump because he was as corrupt as Trump.

Just don't rehabilitate him by saying Trump was 'so much worse' than him. You really are forgetting how much damage Bush did in and of himself.
You're never going to have a 'good' republican to rebel against
Exactly, they're as bad as each other
Bush was a warmonger and a murder
They're as bad as each other
I actually don't
I fucking don't
Do you really think Trump is worse than Bush?
but that's the only way change can happen
because the other guy's always worse
It's never the time, is it?
if the Dems held a large majority this would actually be worse
That's why they have to be willing to pull their vote
And where do they go?
How do you actually shift the Democrats left and get things like a decent environmental program and decent healthcare
What next?
I'm not convinced, let's say you have a huge turnout with a significant amount of new voters who mostly vote for Biden
We still managed to elect Tony Abbott, the only other person as dumb as Trump
It doesn't fix shit
Look, I live in a country with mandatory voting
You have to actually be willing to pull your vote to get anything
No, that says 20% of dems are still ultimately OK with Biden
It may not be the point, but that is the logical consequence.
or some other left wing candidate who runs explicitly against the dems in the general
Which is why the Greens need to get a large vote haul to change anything IMO
Alternatively, guillotines out
Also, for how you could move towards a more socially democratic model, and you're probably not going to like the answer to this and I don't even know if it's the right answer is to not vote for Biden. It may sound really weird but if say, 5% of democrats shifted their votes to the Greens rather than voting for Biden then moderate Dems would get the message that they can't keep running crap candidates.

I don't know if this is worth the cost, it's probably not honestly. But this would be the pathway to actually get democratic reform. The biggest issue with the Democrats is that they just assume they can do whatever shitty right wing policy they want and still get the left wing vote, if you prove to them they can't something would happen.
You apply an external business tax so that people who register as a resident of another country and conduct business in yours end up just paying more in total taxes for example.
There's ways around that
I think you're looking for the term "progressive tax". A percent tax is actually really, really bad.
There's advantages to universality in systems
I'm actually inclined to agree with Tamamo on that front. The US could definitely switch to a far more socially democratic system and historically even has under the New Deal
I've also literally never voted for a major party in my life, so I'm pretty predisposed to thinking in that way. I'll just vote whoever I think has the best policy regardless of their odds, which results in me voting for the Greens and various socialist parties.
and I'd much prefer to make that statement personally
Neither of them deserve a fucking vote
Here's the thing, given the choice between Biden and Trump I'd opt for wasting my vote every time
As long as it hits me I'm OK with it
some pollster asked Americans to choose between Trump or a meteor wiping out all life and like 70% of under 30's said the latter
It's just an American political meme

never
The US is never my model for anything
There's ways to have centralised power without that. You can have hard anti-corruption laws
I agree with devolution of central power, I don't think states are particularly good thing and I preference centralised government
That's not realistic
Impeachment requires a 67% vote in the senate
not really
the legislative and judicial branches in the US have no ability to reign in the executive
The US has problems with the executive having far too much power
That's the rational for multiple branches of government existing
That's an absurd view. Someone needs to have some form of power. Ultimately you need someone like a judge to uphold the law and even in a situation without a centralised government that person has disproportionate power.
But decentralisation allows governments to more effectively ignore that pressure if their region is an outlier
It was because of public pressure, I'm well aware
It's always been centralised powers that put an end to societal issues historically. Legal slavery was ended by centralised governments, not smaller decentralised ones. Gay marriage has, where legalised mostly been on the back of centralised government. There's a lot of examples of this throughout history and you can't just allow smaller decentralised governments to decide because often they will just choose to repress. So I completely disagree. We do need more centralised power.
and unlike the US they're actually attempting to solve those issues
It does, but they're far lesser than the US
It's not like the Maori are exactly one huge homogenous people group and they certainly aren't alike the European settlers
literally just an argument for ignoring the progress that's been made elsewhere
The "big and diverse" argument is such BS
I don't think it's beyond reform, like look at NZ. Also a colonial state but generally doing far better at literally everything than the US
or a lord rather than a senator if you're a medieval feudal state
Yes, almost all countries give more power to their house of reps. In many systems the Prime Minister is a representative, they're almost never a senator in systems where a senate even exists.
That's the Senate
Parliament is just a more general word
Parliament in the US would be Congress, they fill the same role
It's just a more accountable role
The leader of a country is better as the leader of Parliament and not the President
Trust me here, I live in a country with ranked choice voting, it's still pretty fucking shit
Proportional representation
aim higher
Ranked choice is still shit
<a:rooKvv:464224362438852641>
Hey, Joe Biden's neither of those things
This deep, yeah, that's always been the case
This blatant, not for 100 years
they're just more obvious now
Things have been really bad since the 90's due to reforms in the 80's
Ever heard of the Gilded Age?
It has?
The UK gov is continuous since the 1600's
The UK government is actually one of the few that continuously traces its roots back further than the US's
Or until you just work them out? Like, it didn't take a major collapse for the rest of the world to work out universal, single payer healthcare as an example. We just kind of did it after the UK Labour party implemented it and it worked well.
Which uncoincidentally is a defining time for the establishment of many country's modern governments.
Most of the other countries across the world in their modern forms are actually under 200 years old. The modern French state and constitution only actually goes back to the end of WWII for example. Australia has existed in its modern form since 1901. Countries that have a state of over 200 years old are the exception, most countries are younger than WWII.
The US constitution's pretty shit too
Almost all countries have reformed their systems in the last 200 years
No, it's really not
Yes, and that seems to be a common trend amongst most state based systems
NZ would be an example of a country with a decent, strong centralised government and a good counterexample to the US, a more decentralised government that is also less functional.
If Puerto Rico was majority white then Trump would call you Americans
Poorly disguised racism
^That's also my prediction for the election ATM
The thing that will cause revolution is if Trump gets like 46% of the popular vote but wins the electoral collage again
Also, losing the illusion of safety is a good thing, you were never safe and thinking that is exceptionally dangerous.
That's why a lot of presidential systems across the world give the president a lot less power. It's often a more legalistic role that's concerned with determining if MPs have acted illegally in other countries. And even in countries with more presidential power there tends to be more checks on the president than in the US. 

The US has a bad system but I don't think it would need to collapse to be reformed. A particularly aggressive congress and senate could probably limit the powers of the president quite substantially if that was their goal. Of course, collapse and reform is an option but it's not a great idea to rely on it.
Sleeping my whole life sounds ideal

Is it weird that I'd be fine with just retreating away from everyone and being alone doing nothing for the rest of my life
not everything will happen all at once
So plan for the future? Learn a skill you want to know or something
The present really doesn't hold any special or significant value
and sleep
it helps me think and reflect
I actually kinda do want to be bored sometimes
and just being OK with it
The other thing is learning how to deal with boredom
Yes, I was very bored
I've done critical analysis of Eromanga Sensei, so...
You can critically analyse any media
That's a dangerous mindset to have
The problem is that you're simultaneously looking for something with meaning while implying that nothing has meaning
I'd advise you to read into the philosophy of absurdism, because people have thought a lot about the problems that you're raising
Life is just boring
I don't think an extreme fixation with any one period of time, past, present or future is particularly helpful or healthy. You really need to remember that what's happening now isn't all that will ever happen and that things will change.
just statistically speaking
Like, you're going to be ordinary
Nor do I but holy fuck I enjoy watching crap anime about cute girls
Significance really isn't all you're making it out to be
Have you tried just applying a completely different framework to the way you look at things? I think you're overly focusing on significance to the point of detriment. Try looking at the world through a framework of what you enjoy instead. It doesn't have to be significant, it can just be useless, it doesn't matter as long as you enjoy it.

Turns out self defence doesn't actually apply if you go out looking for violence
Also, the police who dealt with the guy in the first place unarguably and colossally fucked up. Want to know how I know? It's been like a day and he's already been arrested and charged with first degree murder.
Almost every country on earth is still dealing with covid
trust me
idiots elsewhere are
No-one here is
"Why don't you just protest peacefully"
"No wait, not in that way, you can't protest in that way"

I actually had pretty decent sex ed at HS, crazy what not being in America can do
The utilitarian point of view on Covid is to restructure the economy in a way that can handle long term lockdown to reduce overall death. Utilitarianism always favours the largest total reduction in harm. Of course it makes an attempt to deal with a pandemic rather than just letting it cull the population. What your talking about isn't utilitarianism, it's a fanatical devotion to the market that prioritised it over human lives.
The whole "just saying" trying to weasel out of your own words looks incredibly pathetic <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>

Na, no-one wins a war between the US and China

And our dumbass government is quite willing to just follow the US straight into war with China

Europe went through a few hundred years of actively fucking with everywhere they could
You see parallels in most places

My dad's just very anti Labour
weird
but he's actually a hard Greens supporter in Aus
I'm convinced if my dad were still in the UK he'd have voted UKIP
Oh god
Fair enough
I didn't know that
Yeah, IK
No, I mean that's what those kinds of people who go on about war crimes do
*ignores the war crimes the west also committed against Japan
That's a fucking warning sign if I've ever seen one
Europe's rising right wing is vastly overstated. Most European countries still trend towards electing social democrats and centrists, which while not ideal is still better than elsewhere
probably not staying in Aus
I think there's pretty decent odds I end up either in Europe or NZ
Who'd have guessed
Turns out universal healthcare also helps a lot in a pandemic
Best possible self defence tool
I remember that shit
<:morryswordfish:701967518876827738>
well, other than Trump catalysing the US's fall as a superpower, that one's pretty likely
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
I think "Trump's handling of the Corona virus pandemic lead to him being beaten to death by an angry protestor with a salmon" is a more likely thing to be recorded than any of those
I think you're being a little generous there
*looks at the UK
There's some things happening that are so objectively stupid that I fail to see how they'll ever be viewed as "right"
On the bright side, protesters erected a guillotine in front of the White House which is exactly the symbolism I've said they should be using for a while now
You really think handing China or the US increased influence and control would benefit the world?
If they decide they want to go to war with a second term Trump then there'd be a lot of issues
It just depends on how state leaders handle things
There are very legitimate internal threats to the US. If Trump wins, protests continue as they have now and some state leader decides they want to actually run on independence all bets are off as to what the fuck happens. It's probably the first point in recent history where the US is destabilised enough that something like that could pass with popular support.
so uh, we have a very extreme division by age
I live in a country with this age division though

Tribalism's been alive and well for years
The name's dumb
They're conservatives
and I'm not from a hugely progressive area
There's also a huge social pressure element to it. My last year of HS was an election year in November IIRC. When we were talking about who we'd vote for the only parties that were ever mentioned were Labor and the Greens. The Liberals never even got a mention.
normally around 16 people drop that crap
Like, when you're 14 fascist views are funny and edgy
Zoomers are mostly teenagers, teenager's views tend to develop and change far faster than people who are just a little older
The way the pop works out here our right wing party is long term fucked because they just lack a voterbase under 40
To be fair the far left vote will climb over time and the far right will fall just due to population dynamics. The older generation is generally very far right wing when compared to the younger generation, at least where I live.

if anything Biden's actually further in the pockets of corperations
They're both in the pockets of corporations, neither of them will do jack shit
The only reason why the great depression itself didn't result in violent upheaval is because FDR offered a viable non-violent option. When you have Trump and Biden as choices the outlook's a lot bleaker

I want to abolish the monarchy and reform Australia as a republic
I'm actually a republican (in Aus terms not the US)
I'm like, not remotely though
According to this I am
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Why does it say monarchist when I explicitly answered monarchies should be abolished
arguing in favour of it would be less a socialist point and more a social democratic point
There's a socialist argument for not having that
Like, there was a question about ensuring a high min wage or something?
To be fair, a lot of the "socialist" questions were being asked in an explicitly capitalist framework
Impure <:monkaCHRIST:582157179100856333>
I didn't really put a ton of thought into a lot of my answers
I think I was reading something about Assange before so I just answered based off of that
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
I'd just be more in favour of listening to people when they said they weren't one or the other
I actually don't like local government much at all and preference larger scale government generally
I find that to be a very dangerous and troubling idea
See, the reason I don't particularly like Anarchism is because I fundamentally believe that most people are fucking morons and given the chance will actively fuck anything up
Also, I'm not being hyperbolic when I say it's blood money since it's a fortune that was amassed on the back of violently supressing unionists. It's not unreasonable to distrust someone who'd put money earned in that way into politics.
OK, fuck that ideology
I'm a socialist, but I absolutely despise wealth as a concept and have no trust for the wealthy at all
I already hate him
So a silverspoon rich kid fed with blood money?
Actual scum of the earth human being

You do not want to base any of your ideology off of Rockefeller
considering the levels of automation we see now we're probably only a couple of decades off being able to remove the vast majority of shit jobs that no-one actually wants to do
Honestly, manual labour's becoming increasingly irrelevant to the world
people will continue to study medicine, sciences and art because they're actually rewarding careers to work in
*people won't do shit work for nothing, maybe the solution here is to reduce the total amount of shit work and actually reward it well

Also Iskierka, I'm mostly just poking fun at the UK. I understand that realistically most people probably don't support Brexit, especially at this time.
That's probably true as well
I think that the general desire for nations, particularly stupid islands excluded to reform large parts of their governmental systems to align themselves to enter into the EU shows that there's a general trend towards favouring personal advantage over autonomy
and I would not shoot someone
I am significantly pacifist leaning
Obviously you can still intervene in the case of a nation committing a genocide, but if a nation wants to go full on England that should be their right regardless of how stupid it is
Just because I favour world governance it doesn't mean I'm against independence, it means that I want to create a government that's mutually beneficial to all partners in it
IMO, let them
Please dear god no, that's a terrible idea for so many reasons. Giving an unaccountable militia broad authority is like the current police state on steroids.
because I'm pretty sure that's what most terrorists throughout history would term themselves
And I have a lot of issues with the idea of a "defender of ideology" as you put it before
I will always favour peaceful solutions where they are possible
But by definition the more you decentralise the harder it becomes to do anything about it
That's basically the issue with decentralisation
^
since it would require wide support rather than just a few rouge actors
I find it to be a lot more unlikely
International socialism
Yes
And an anarchist commune can decide it wants to be an ethnostate with much, much less to stop it. Which ends very badly for a lot of people. Hell a few individuals could decide that and the commune just lacks the power to realistically stop them. That's why I really dislike anarchism. It's far, far to exploitable. World governance at least has to answer to a lot of people and has a lot of people to enforce it.
and I generally favour strength in supernational organisations the highest, for example the EU and UN
Power ultimately has to be vested somewhere, to make one stronger the other must be weaker
that tends to be easier since it's a more equal power dynamic
Do you have any siblings you can talk to about it?

But in the case of explaining this to people who haven't studied chemistry or physics to the end of high school it's easier to just say that the molecules are too small to be stopped and technically not untrue.
Yeah, but small gas molecules can also pass through the mask, not just around it. Which from my understanding does have to do with physical size, not because of the molecules being physically blocked but due to the way how smaller molecules interact with the Van der Waals force. For larger molecules this force causes them to stick to the fibres of the mask, but for small molecules it can't overcome molecular repulsion and they're able to pass through.
Eh, to some extent it's accurate. If it were a larger molecule it would be less able to cross through the mask. There's also a lot to do with polarisation and charges IIRC but since CO2 is completely non-polar the only thing that could stop it getting through is size and it's simply not big enough to be blocked.
A CO2 molecule is literally 3 atoms across. Far too small to be stopped by a mask.
Yes, it'll do

It strikes me as a "look over there" tactic
I'm always suspicious of this sort of shit
It's community created content
and scrolled down
clicked videos
I legit went to his channel
<:Doubt:696037552716775524>
But like seriously, any channel that makes this video and this thumbnail shouldn't be taken seriously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmvWCAkRb7c
The second would actually pass as one of the more thoughtful videos on the topic and he repeats the same points over and over
but here's the thing, the quality generally isn't much higher than the first video
I'm well aware
but it's not great
It's not as objectively stupid as the first
The second video is very surface level criticism IMO
also, just looking down this guy's channel it's all low quality clickbait content
He's responding to the fact that it's been spam downvoted and shows a selection of AUDIENCE responce
No, I'm pointing out that the guy in the first video is incredibly stupid
That's how Rotten Tomatoes works and has always worked
The critics are independent
Like, it's at 5%
Also, what that first guy said is not just objectively wrong but stupid on the face of it. "It's not being downvote bombed, if anything it's being upvote bombed, look at my few cherrypicked reviews".
You realise that Rotten Tomatoes is an aggregator of independent and unrelated critics right?
The alt right is a mix, a lot of them just follow whatever but there's definitely a certain percentage who are dangerously smart and know exactly what they're doing.
but I do know how certain elements of society view any questioning of religion as an outright attack and will viciously lash out at anything that does so
mostly replying to Oclisto, I don't really know
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
It's getting so much backlash because it explores religion vs culture
I actually think the more interesting conversation is about how absurd it is that the blatantly exploitative marketing was so successful and what that says about society.
Either care enough to watch it or just don't
But then why parrot their message?
Would you even know it existed?
Would you have cared if they didn't market it like this?
Did they though? You've been in here twice talking about this now
They'd have had lawyers weigh the risk
use brain
And like, if it were child pornography there's no way netflix would air it
<a:PetTheNuclearLaunchButton:753657074193399818>
Like, I actually don't have a stance on this. I'm just pissed off at the extension of the anti expert reactionary garbage into the critical scene. Critics are experts and their reaction does actually mean something.
Until then you're just going to be flooded with half brain trash like this and the reviews of actually critics who watched it weeks earlier and have had the time to write a real review
good reviews take time to write
Here's the thing man, people will actually make some decent reviews of the movie, they'll take time though
shocking
Someone with a reactionary take has a history or transphobia
It's like a C grade high school lit review <:LuL:582156964276994063>
It's just a plot summery
It's very surface level, he doesn't even really look at any themes or symbolism at all
Given the choice between critics and the creator of "We have to talk about wide Putin" I'm siding with critics
They tend to be fairly good
I haven't, but I generally trust critics on Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes
They win on every front
It also makes it harder to call out how abjectly horrible these companies actually are at risk of being lumped in with a tidal wave of idiots
Listen, I have my own problems with Nike and Gillette *cough slave labour* but the reason they were doing that was just mind bogglingly stupid
I think I started getting into politics at about 15, but at the start it was just environmentalism that interested me
to be fair most adults don't either
Most people don't have very smart political takes at 14 <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
I know people who very much buy into it though
I just think I'm lucky that I'm an immigrant so the majority of that shit was completely lost on me
Also, I hate how much military glorification and hyper-patriotism (really just nationalism) there is in our cultures, drilling these ideas into kids heads is the worst possible thing we can do
<:ChrisHibikiHug:630262562361049121>
If you're already at the point of regretting dumb shit you've done by 15 rather than finding more ways to do it you'll be absolutely fine
Yeah, that's not happening
Fear of losing their power can work too
Yes, I know that
But also, the only way you'll ever be able to change it is if the major parties actually feel threatened by 3rd parties or are forced into coalitions with them. Both the Democrats and Republicans will always stand in the way of change.
It's garbage
Of course it should be changed
I'm not arguing to perpetuate it, I'm arguing that you can't blame it for what is ultimately what people choose to accept
It's also worth noting that the only way the system ever changes is if a 3rd party gains considerable power since it's not in the interest of the majors to change the system.
That's kinda the point that I'm arguing though. The media in the US has consistently hammered home, without evidence how damaging 3rd parties are to the major parties. If the media didn't so consistently act to uphold the two major parties interests then I think you'd see more viable 3rd parties regardless of the voting system.
Fuck Murdoch
True that
I'd argue Canada's system consistently produces better results than the US's in spite of being FPTP. That's not to say it's a good system. It's a shit system. It just so happens that there's ways for the system to be implemented slightly less shit.
But like, the US voting system totally can and has produced 3rd parties in the past
That's the main problem, the money. A FPTP voting system can produce better results than the USA's, the biggest issue is that money is spent to perpetuate the myth that voting 3rd party is wasting your vote as well as political corruption being used to keep 3rd parties down.
I'm just making the argument that it's ultimately not the reason why the USA is where it is right now
I know full well that FPTP sucks as a voting system
The US is stuck with two parties because the people are kinda OK with it and continue to support said 2 parties
It's not just momentum though, they've been fixtures of their respective countries for decades now
and yes, it's easier to have 3rd parties without FPTP voting but if the NDP and Liberal Democrats prove anything it's that FPTP voting doesn't exclude 3rd parties existing at all
They're actually so damn stupid
Aus Labor's going to lose the next election too for the exact same reason
What makes 3rd parties in the US unviable is people buying far too much into media narratives
Canada comes to mind
There are countries with FPTP voting and viable 3rd parties
The media narrative about 3rd parties also pissed me off a lot. Like, dominant political parties have always shifted over time, remember the Whigs and UK Liberals? The idea that the left is stuck with who we have now is just such a dumb narrative driven from the top down.
I'm pissed of at Labor for being a bunch of neoliberal assholes, not too far left
I'm a socialist and a life long Greens voter
I haven't
I'm getting pretty sick of both choices in politics being utter shit
Which is like, way less exploitative than "fuck or die". I really don't have a problem when people have a choice to engage in sex work and do, I just hate that people are forced into it
In a post capitalism society it wouldn't exist because work wouldn't exist in its current form, that is correct
Prostitution would still exist without poverty, it just wouldn't be the human rights/basically slavery disaster it is now
Also Kat, the Greens being in favour of isolationism is mostly a media smear. They're actually in favour of further integration of the US into the international community entering into arrangements such as the International Court of Justice which the US currently refuses to do. They literally support international co-operation more than either of the major parties.

Their policy to cut down on international arms sales is primarily targeted at Saudi Arabia, yes Russia specifically likes this, but this is just a really good example of why structuring your policy to piss off Russia is a terrible idea. Russia likes it because Saudi Arabia arms terrorists who's actions spill over into Russian borders. It's beneficial to everyone to cut that crap out though.

Lastly, they're a Greens party, not an anarchist party. Like Greens parties across the world they are actually capitalist and in favour of state interventionism. They do not favour the decentralisation of the economy, quite the opposite. I have no idea where you even pulled this from because it's so far from the truth.

This is what I mean by the media holding too much power though, they ruthlessly smear any 3rd party to the point where people just believe crap about them.
Also, yes. better social programs so there's a realistic choice to not enter sex work is a good idea
There is an alternative to self employment, nationalised government ran sex work actually deals with most of the issues. It's probably an absolute political nightmare though
In the US at this point that's probably true
I'm not talking about natural causes
My personal take is that this election is such a clusterfuck that either side would likely be dead by the end of a year
Yes, but FDR was both a lot smarter and a far better poli than Joe Biden
Plus, when compared to something like the Australian model it makes crimes against sex workers far easier
Self employment can easily be exploited if there aren't extremely robust legal protections and standards
I'm not so sure
Sure, but when you legalise something you at least help to reduce that stigma and offer some legal protections that otherwise wouldn't exist, which is 100% better than doing nothing.
That's a law enforcement problem, not a problem with legalising prostitution
It's not a perfect solution but at least it keeps the absolute worst human rights abuses away
I live in a country with legalised brothels and what Melua is saying is basically right
Pretty good time to file that patent

As Allison said the starting point towards post scarcity is the reduction of the 40 hour work week and introduction of welfare sufficient to live a comfortable life off of so people can retrain into jobs that are needed or choose not to do so. The reduction of the work week would create more jobs due to the same work being needed to be filled still but would improve the quality of life for the workers. Only people it would fuck over are the capitalists at the top, which I'm always down for.
So is the automation I'm talking about though, and we can't just allow it to continue only making money for rich people
most of the "kinks" are human drivers being kinda shit
The alternative to ironing out the kinks is just to remove non-automated cars from the road, which automation at factories gives us the ability to do already
How far off do you think we are from automating away all the shit jobs no-one actually wants?
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
We're probably not more than 10 years off having the mass automation and distribution capacity required to become a post scarcity civilisation, it's certainly worth talking about
or just people who's kids have grown up too
In theory a post scarcity society would cover that also since there's no shortage of people without kids who enjoy being around kids and without pressure to work would likely give up some of their time to do so
Like a post scarcity society is by definition one where all but the most extreme luxury goods can be made and distributed so cheaply that there's no real need for an economic system as we know it
The idea of post scarcity is that you can just walk to a shop and get a guitar

Recently our government's been talking about how renewables are a "mature technology that no longer needs investment" and saying they're going to invest in gas power instead
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
but yes, what I see from polling says that
I'm confused, it says there that the pro-EU coalition collapsed, which made me assume their opposition is anti EU
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
Leaving the EU and the general clusterfuck that voting for Eurosceptic parties will bring
Are people in Poland seriously watching Britain and thinking "yeah, that looks good, we'll have some of that"
I will always argue that this is one of the few things Australia managed to not fuck up
It probably is, but at the same time that doesn't mean smaller things like legalising prostitution aren't worth doing
literally
That last sentence is more along the lines of "bosses who break employment law should be yeeted into jail"
nothing I said implied that
no?
as long as your employer isn't outright breaking laws at least, but I fail to see how anything functions in that case
You're always better protected in an organised workplace
It really doesn't though. Self employment implies that they're working alone. Something more like a brothel system implies that they have a boss who's responsible for their health while at work who will hire other support staff like security who can remove anyone who's breaking their rules.
People can tell they're being fucked and snakeoil salesmen are taking over
The thing unravelling it is the core problem at the heart of all western nations
No, but I think your take is na√Øve and dangerous
the people who voted for Obama twice were just too racist
Sure
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
He's a big part of the reason Trump won in the first place
Biden just pushes back the next fascist 4 years
Americans will honestly vote for the same two parties to take turns fucking them and just be happy when it's their team fucking them
No, they're not
if he wins expect everything to stay literally the exact same
Biden is literally the opposite of a change candidate
They've basically been trying to label gas as green energy
The worst part is that the opposition came out and supported it
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
My choice would have been Jill Stein because I fucking refuse to partake in lesser of two evils garbage
All post Regan have been pretty atrocious at least
true
Na, Obama even doing exactly what he wanted was pretty neoliberal
Stalin's left nut would have outperformed her
she was the worst possible choice of candidate to go up against Trump
Hillary was quite possibly the most neoliberal candidate ever
And? Who's president now?
Literally a plank of wood would have been better
Trump won because the Democratic candidate was as bad as Hillary Clinton
Also to be clear, there were totally people who voted for Trump because he's racist, they're just not why he won
and they mostly have to do with the extreme neoliberalism of the last 30 or so years before him
I'm not saying I like Trump or would have voted for him, I'm just saying there's good reasons why people did that aren't just "racism"
Na, he actually directly referenced the UK's (I think he said Scotland though) healthcare on his campaign trail
his campaign was all over the place but he actually did bring it up a few times
I believe he actually sorta did run on universial health care
I wonder why those states maybe weren't so hot on him?
Not offering universal healthcare, not offering min wage increases, not offering any break from the neoliberalism that's crushed the entire rust belt
Normal garbage neoliberal point that Trump isn't a result of neoliberalism but rather racism
And Biden was polling neck and neck in these states because again, he's not offering change
Despite the fact that all the fucking polling and any simple logic you could apply suggests that they voted for Trump because they wanted change, they voted for Obama because they wanted change and they voted against the Dems because when entrusted to enact change they did not
You're calling them racists
since early in Trump's candidacy
and they always have been
Yes, but statistically the voters you're vilifying are the ones most likely to have jumped ship
within about 6 months that was the trend
Even early on in his presidency that was true
To Obama's former VP
OK, flaw in your theory again. Those "rust belt white guys" are the people who are statistically most likely to have turned away from Trump at this point.
especially because if you ask the voters who actually flipped from Obama to Trump why they did they almost all give the same reason, they voted for change
Like, to me nothing about that theory adds up
But like, here's my question to you. If Trump won only because of racism, how did Obama manage to win, in his first election 7 of the states that Trump would eventually win. Wouldn't he have struggled more with racist states logically than Clinton?
Just like Obama won by convincing people he'd improve the system
But he did it by convincing people that he'd improve the system, regardless of what you think of him
trust me
If the Greens got 5% of the votes they're shitting their pants
so by voting for the Greens you hopefully force some change by scaring them
My take on this is, unless the Dems feel at threat of losing to the Greens they'll never change anything
Doing nothing in the trolley problem is 100% ethically acceptable
you realise that right?
That's basically just saying "I'll do nothing and let the country continue down the path it's on"
that's a huge issue
Like
Also, and hear me out here, the politician who was shit enough that people couldn't bring themselves to vote for her
You kinda were though
most would have just stayed home if forced to chose between the two though
There were a percentage of Greens voters who thought Trump was a better idea than Clinton
^
apply your logic equally
And if everyone who voted Libertarian voted Trump?
not people who didn't vote Hillary
And that's the fault of people who voted Trump
And me who votes Greens in a safe Liberal seat because I can't stand Labor
Could a regional party really not function in the US?
Why though?
You can take 20% of congress and the senate
Which is very significant
It's about 45 IIRC
A robust party doesn't need to be able to take parliament, they just need to influence parliament
They won like 90% of seats in Scotland
a robust party
100%
Is
The SNP
Canada and the UK both have FPTP voting systems that have had robust 3rd parties for years
It's proven by practice that yes, actually, it can
Because talking heads have convinced the population that voting 3rd party is useless
It's harder to realise that it's actually deeply ingrained voting habits within the population that you're enforcing
It's very easy to blame the system
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
Who runs your seat?
Emily, what kind of voting system does your country use?
I don't either Coco
which is pretty cool
The Sun Ripened Warm Tomato Party apparently helped to elect a protogreens party minister in Canberra
Britain has by far the best joke parties
Look, it's three joke candidates
Man, I want to vote for the Party! Party! Party! Party
I normally vote them fairly high up on my senate vote
I love the pirate party
there is here too
yes
but like, it seems completely legal that if the Greens pulled a miracle and won a state and said "our voters are actually just voting the Dem" that would actually fly
ehhh
but as it stands
If enough of them voted against their states then the courts might get involved
not really, they actually choose the president
Which uhhh, there were actually electors who didn't vote for their states winner in the last election, they just didn't make a difference
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/US_Electoral_College_2016.svg
Which I imagine a 3rd party would use to leverage things
A party can mandate its electors to vote for someone other than the candidate they ran
That gives them power if they can win states
Pretty sure that should they actually win a state they have influence over who would be the president, at least assuming it's a close race
Labour siding with the Tories normally means bad shit's about to happen
since it's easier to appeal to a single region that 30ish states
at least IMO
They'd probably take the region over pretty quickly too
If say, rustbelt Dems decided "the national Dems don't serve our interest" and yeeted themselves out of the party then survived an election cycle I think they'd be in a pretty similar situation
Labour were very successful in Scotland until the SNP split off
If a regional party becomes dominant they do it by bumping off whatever party was successful there before. The SNP basically stole Labours territory in Scotland and the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois took away mostly NDP territory in Quebec. Their main oppositions are the British Conservatives and a mix of the Liberals and Conservatives in Quebec. I don't see why this would be different in the US. A regional progressive party likely competes with the Republicans and a regional conservative party with the Democrats.
I don't see why that would matter
The exception being Northern Ireland, but that's because neither of the big UK parties actually run there
Also, I missed this Rady, but you normally don't get two regional parties. There's only one SNP, there isn't another Scottish party. There's one Plaid Cymru and one Bloc Qu√©b√©cois. At least in FPTP voting only one regional party tends to be stable.
Imagine having a president who can check the constitutionality of laws rather than a useless monarch who's literally excluded from doing anything by your countries law and doesn't even live in your country
<:ChrisUgg:671982993195139094>
I have a feeling the next Aus election is just going to be two utterly incompetent parties and leaders just pointlessly taking swings at each other and finding new and unique ways to fail
at least for a while
Didn't the Beer Party smash that 3% though
Also, yeah, the British never fucked over the Irish. It's not like there was a famine caused by Brits from which the Irish population never really recovered. Just to name one thing.
Who'd have thought?
World problems being caused by the British?
IDK about you guys but my first source for news is a literal hentai site, just saying
Maybe if Biden gets such an absurdly huge win that it's completely accepted, but that seems very unlikely to me
I don't see any way to avoid it honestly
Moreover Trumps people will riot if Biden wins anyway
well, at least those who remotely care which is a crazy minority
In reality most left wingers look at that take and find it dumb as fuck too
Pretty standard right wing tactic though, find bad left wing take, pretend bad take is left wing orthodoxy, attack the hell out of it
Reading that Sankaku Complex article actually cost me a few braincells
I'm also just a bit wary of labour parties in general because ours is just so beyond shit. Generally I'd prefer to seek out alternative left wing parties because of the poor taste that Aus Labor has left in my mouth. To me it seems that the labour movement mostly gave up to neoliberalism. Admittedly Corbyn was probably the only leader of a labour party I've actually liked of recent times, but I'm still very wary of those under him.
But at the same time I just don't care enough about British elections to look into a microparty with one seat
I'd literally have to see what they're saying. Like, I am a Greens member here and I'm used to the Greens attacking Labour with good reason so I'd give them the benefit of the doubt to at least see what they're saying
I'd outright refuse to vote Lib Dems
I'd have still voted Labour even in that situation, or possibly the Greens but I don't really know enough about the British Greens to make that call
Even the threat of leaving the EU wouldn't make me vote for disguised Tories.
The thing that shattered that for me was learning about the context of the Indian independence movement
More like a belief in the fact that the British empire was genuinely a good thing and that an expansion of the commonwealth (with Britain at the head of course) and removing Britain from the EU would be a positive
and I've hated it for a very long time
so I was bought up with that my whole life pretty much
My dad used to be very into the British imperialist shit
Half Scot, half English
I'm British by birth
Yes
If Brits could stop glorifying the empire that'd be fucking great
And I can understand why republicans in NI would be very pissed off right now
I'm generally inclined to agree that at least from my na√Øve point of view the GFA was one of the best possible outcomes for Northern Ireland. Of course, when one side's actively ripping that to shreds there's a fucking problem.
<:heh:496448769185808435>
So there's an infinite amount of them now
To be fair, he's actually a comic book character based off him
The House of Lords is the most blatant way the wealthy maintain their power within a western democracy
They're really hitting that serial killer vibe
"can you guys make the lighting any worse, yeah, just like that, perfect"
also I think this is the most comically blatant one yet
Still pisses me off though
Other than the standard "fuck Murdoch"
Don't even know what to say about this
I uhhh
https://www.sbs.com.au/news/the-feed/news-corp-slammed-for-unbalanced-reporting-on-victorian-premier-as-poll-shows-majority-supports-him
Thanks, I hate it
Look for a Canadian grandparent
That's kinda how I've felt quite a bit in life too, not really trans but also not really male as such
*also I'm using the European definition of liberal here
Most successful "nonviolent" movements were a mishmash of both people using nonviolent means and those who used violence to achieve their goals. History just likes to exclude the later group most of the time and glorify the former because the liberal establishment knows that nonviolent protest isn't actually a threat to them.
They called MLK a terrorist in his day too
Getting anxious about anxiety is pretty much the worst case scenario
Something tells me that's not gonna work
"I'll make you forget all your other problems"
*snap*
Yeah, there's no such thing as an objective history, but you can't just write off anything that makes you look bad like this
It's just disgusting revisionism
"No victim narratives against Britain". Like, I live in Aus. I know Aboriginals who's ancestors were definitely victimised by Britain. It's not a narrative, it's just a fact. Pretty sure there's a few Irish people here who'd have things to say about that too.
"respect differences but not political differences, you must support capitalism"
Pretty much everything about that pisses me off though
I'm sure British values are inclusive of N-Ireland and Scotland too and aren't really just English values
"Promoting non democratic systems"
You mean, like, everything about the British electoral system including but not limited to the FPTP system, the House of Lords and the actual fucking monarch?
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
XR's done a great job of getting news coverage here
To be fair, I probably more closely align with MLK and Ghandi's approach (the former inspired by the later) than Malcom X's though. I generally think that nonviolent disruptive/destructive protests are greatly favourable to violence where possible and Malcolm X, while not what conservatives try to paint him as was still too willing to use violence.
They were essentially allies fighting for the same cause with different means
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism
yep, also democrats though
Free market, low taxes, low amounts of government regulation both on individuals and corperations
Maybe the page I linked before which talks about every candidates policy and aggregates past policies of the party to create a party platform?
No, I'm basing it off of past Lib policy and rhetoric
What do you think it means in this context?
streamline=remove
She says "let the market handle it" directly
It's implicit in what she's saying
You literally linked a page before that basically said "do away with all energy sector regulation and just let the market handle it"
The Libertarians are against all regulation.
The Libertarian's policy has been tried, the result was Standard Oil.
More like back to the Gilded Age. No proper regulation, monopolies around every corner. Corporations fucking their employees over with slave wages (not that that's not already an issue). A few billionaires have basically full control of the country. Sounds fantastic.
There's another party that makes that same argument and has since the 80's
*outside of the US and Canada anyway
We'd use the word liberal
It doesn't even exist in other countries
I agree with that Rakhi, I just think the Libertarian party is basically just the Republican party with a mask on
Yes, that literally says "more capitalism"
This is a quote
Their solution to climate change is literally more capitalism
I think if you actually think the Libertarians are a good party you need to read this though, because it's actually fucking crazy.
https://www.ontheissues.org/celeb/Libertarian_Party_Environment.htm
As per usual the libertarian candidate is pretty shit. They just look less shit when contrasted against Trump and Biden. Her views on social policy are dangerous and her views on environmentalism are laughable.
I just feel like it was mostly a wash because it was so, utterly, unproductive
Biden didn't really have much of an opportunity to do anything positive or negative which was more what I was looking to see
That was going to happen
The thing is, Trump making a fool out of himself was a forgone conclusion
it was a mess
I just couldn't take anything away from it at all really
That'll make people listen
Why not just use the American solution and give the moderator a gun
Alternatively just start the Monster Raving Loony Party US branch. You might actually win an election
The Greens
There's a 4th option who's more anti-corporation, more pro-environment, more pro-worker and has a far better spread of environmental policy. If you're already willing to vote 3rd party anyway I'd highly advise you look into them. They're also the party who's platform best aligns with stepping in when capitalism isn't working.
At least in Aus, something like 70% were in favour of government stimulus.
Also, most economists very heavily disagree with Libertarians.
Their policy does too, I don't even care that much about their opinions as people, I care more about their party policy and they have shown, as a party to support things that are wildly beneficial to big corps.
If corporations thought the Libs were remotely palatable to the majority they would support them.
So do the Libs
They do
Yes
I agree, which is why I'm talking about the political party
You may not have any love for large corporations but your party is incredibly favourable towards them.
I'm using logic, the anti tax, anti regulation party is inherently pro corporation.
What makes you think they'd turn on a dime and favour a smaller community
I'm being serious, the Libertarians are intent on selling out to corporations, they love corporations.
Do you really think the corporate simp party would do that?
Because the sorts of corporations this applies to have multiple working sites (think mines) and can just abandon them when they are done with them
they abandon the site
It's really easy, they just leave
It's usually cheaper just to pay a fine because cleanups are so absurdly expensive
Because it costs them money
They just fucking won't
I live in a country that's tried that
They just won't fucking do it
There is no context where that is acceptable
is just no
That alone
>We support the abolition of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Yeah, that's the correct way to deal with that sort of dumbass statement
<a:ChikaSmack:578363803448901649>
<a:superbonkcat:679667263586041939>
I like the idea of having attendants with rolled up newspaper to bonk them with
Hey, that's slightly more democratic than the current system
on either side
I have no respect for any of them
I'm gonna let you in on a secret
Yep, Reagan broke politics
International disgrace for doing bad things is better than Reagan style charisma doing bad things and normalising them
Na, Pence would just give the Democrats some nice words while pushing the exact same policy and get half the fucks to greenlight it
I think Pence would be far worse than Trump. He wants basically the same things as Trump but he's far more competent overall. Like, Trump's stupidity and inability to do anything can quite often actually be a saving grace.
They can however pass laws making it unreasonably hard for gay marriage to actually happen as they've done with abortion in red states though
It's better than things actively getting worse, but fucked if I know why anyone actually wanted that
Biden will probably just be 4 years of literally nothing changing
If they're following decent practice they test him again in a few days just to check.
A single negative test doesn't actually mean someone doesn't have the virus. You can test negative in the very early days even when infected just because the virus hasn't replicated enough to show yet.
Yeah, better an incompetent leader than one who actually knows exactly what they're doing and has the worst set of goals possible
The most likely is Pence I guess, but there's a chance the party undermines that and pulls someone else
The odds he has Covid are low but not zero, but like, the exact same thing for Biden. They both have a contact with Covid at this point, one negative test isn't enough to show that they 100% don't have it.
I agree, but that's not how most see him
I don't know 100% what happens but I just don't know if Biden can win if Pence makes the same argument as him basically
If Trump has to step down and Biden runs against Pence I could actually see it being kinda a disaster for him
make them unelectable
call out every piece of corruption you can
My opinion on that is that if the next most viable candidate is a Republican you should just slash and burn them
because they're not willing to go for Biden's jugular
Yep, it's also why people like Sanders lose
I'd actually much prefer the wolf to the wolf in sheep's clothing
Why do you care about the facade?
Talking nicely isn't inherently respectable
I don't view Pence or Biden as particularly more respectable than Trump, all three of them are corrupt pieces of shit that would sell out the country at the first chance they had.
It's happened before
Sure, but an arsehole willing to get his own party members yeeted out of the house to implement his own policy can be both effective and popular
it's other Dems
The Reps aren't really the problem
The difference is that Sanders was a life long independent before he ran and has far less loyalty to the Dems.
I don't really think Sanders would have been an ineffective leader.
Sander's would have lead more as a union leader than a traditional president IMO. Calling for general strikes and other forms of union action to get reforms. He said how he was going to overcome that problem, he was just going to go to the states of those who opposed him, support protests against them and primary them.
He just lied
His whole campaign was actually fairly progressive
I agree other than Obama coasting off of being not Bush
Liberals also support free market capitalism while the furthest right position amongst the actual left is the social democratic position of highly regulated markets. Neoliberal economic theories aren't accepted on the left while they broadly are by liberals.
Claiming he's the reason he won is also disingenuous, any other candidate would have probably beat him.
I mean, he also only really won because his opponent was credibly accused of sexually assaulting minors and it was only 50-48.
You mean the Red Dem who's part of the problem?
And also, I explicitly said that the union movement is most effective when it protests and uses its influence in primaries
But if they primary enough establishment Dems in California, New York ect. they can look to win enough congressional seats to change the laws and make voter suppression illegal in these seats as well as change other much needed laws. Issue is the establishment Dems will never stick their necks out for this because they believe in nothing.
But most of the time the Democrats aren't winning in Alabama
And yes, Sanders is an example of how you stand a chance
I'm not saying no effort should be made
Because I understand what the absolute worst communities for this shit look like
No, most people who become congressmen are selected by their party as the party supported candidate in a primary in a relatively safe seat and go on to win that seat. Community outreach isn't that important in practice. If you win a Democratic primary in a blue seat or a Republican primary in a red seat you're almost guaranteed to win the seat. There's very few actual swing seats where community outreach becomes more important. You can win a primary with outreach. But you ain't stealing a safe seat ever.
if you can bump off one of them with someone who isn't an asshole that actually helps more
Choosing between local asshole one and local asshole two really doesn't matter
I think it's more effective to boot out corrupt polis in primaries and worry about that since that actually has an impact
OK, but it still requires you to overcome the exact same gerrymandering
If the other party wins that already means the gerrymander didn't do its job so removing it is less important
OK, but that's still a non-sensical argument because you're basically saying "the gerrymandered elections are important to remove the effects of gerrymandering"
at least in the US
What really matters are primaries
Local elections don't really mean shit since so often it's just one asshat running against another
which is probably more effective
Or you know, change laws so that businesses can't get away with that shit
You can even see a tiny little bump when Obama came to office and he wasn't really even a unionist
Yes, but, and trust me here, a unionist president or candidate will aid in driving membership
https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/30/union-membership-2/
Which he needed to
He just never attacked Biden
which I'm pretty sure Sanders was smart enough to do
Make it a fight of unions and workers VS corrupt politicians and business interests
yes, lean into that rhetoric
Just because the party isn't ruthless it doesn't mean a candidate can't be and can't stack the party with their own guys
My argument then would be that a left wing president would need to be less like Obama and more like FDR
I'm talking about FDR
I'm not talking about Trump or a Republican
Like, I'm still not trying it but it should work
Actually, microwaving a mask should sterilise it

Well, this made me pretty fucking angry
He will be
Trump should still be in hospital, no question
I'm pretty sure Boris Johnson was in hospital with it longer and he never looked as bad as Trump does and is significantly less at risk to the virus
Yeah, you don't get hospitalised for three days generally from my understanding
That's not even really in question
Whether or not China's lying they're still doing considerably better than the US is
Holy shit, Kamala Harris is such an unbelievably ineffective debater, she actually cannot respond to Pence outright lying in a way that doesn't make her look stupid. It shouldn't be hard, but apparently she needs to do things like randomly deflect to the troops for no damn reason rather than making the obvious arguments.
Leave and see if they contact you I guess?
No, the masks are actually disposable. 

When they come into contact with moisture, like, for example the moisture in your breath the electrostatic properties that allow disposable masks to most efficiently capture viruses starts to break down. A reused mask is still better than nothing, but it's objectively worse at stopping particulates.
Also, I'm kind of hesitant to use Europe as a counter example to the US because IMO they also failed to properly deal with Covid, just less spectacularly than the US.
India has a share of other issues that made it near impossible for them to actually handle Covid well
<a:ChrisShift:671988771725770752>
You literally just said I can stare into alternate realities, which suggests you think what I said was wrong
OK then
You don't think Obama, Bush, Clinton ect. were corrupt as fuck?
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
so to say "this one specifically" is just wrong
but every president of the last 40 or so years has done that
In so far as he listens to his donors I guess
No, no, no, that's not why he didn't do anything. He didn't do anything because he's corrupt. Do you think Clinton would have done more? She's equally as corrupt. It's not the president holding the country hostage, it's his donors.
There's actually nothing in the US constitution that says a president can't just say "noted, fuck off"
he ignored them and did it anyway
They told Lincoln he couldn't give blacks citizenship
And before you say "But the supreme court"
There's actually very little that can stand in the way of a federal government deciding they want something done, the US's was just busy selling the country down the river
They can do it at a federal level if they really want to
They didn't
They can
Yes
>China is also an authoritarian state while America has to rely on the populace for cooperation.
That's why I think your argument that "the US can't just do what China did" is bullshit. They didn't want to do what China did. NZ and Australia both have.
As I said, the methods NZ used were similar to China
That's why we work off per capita numbers
Matt, NZ also has had under 2000 cases
you realise that right?
That's like taking 1 in 4 people from the country in the US and moving them to a city
That's significantly more in NZ
Yep
NZ has mountains
Not really, the US has huge tracks of low density country area
It's because urbanisation percentage is actually more relevant
Not exactly the urban centres of the USA
Also, look at the US states that got hit the hardest. Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia
Just throw away population density, a higher percentage of the pop actually live in cities
Matt, NZ is more urbanised than the US
To me the really big difference here is that China and New Zealand both put their population ahead of immediate economic outcomes, the US didn't.
Because, weirdly enough there's nothing that says a western democracy can't do that
New Zealand handled Covid in much the same way as China
so I don't think that's really a valid argument
You know, there's other less authoritarian states that did better too, like all of them
90% of Americans are just as oppressed as you are. They're oppressed by the same capitalist system.
Not the average citizen
Yeah, blame the government/the people who actually did it
Regardless of what happens in the next US election people will die because of it
Having an ocean or a Canada to protect you helps
I mean, Hawaii's probably one of the two states that could completely dodge a civil war honestly
I'd put it at coinflip odds
I mean, I disagree fundamentally. Clinton's donors would have been saying the same shit. No lockdowns, they're bad for the economy, open back up, all this shit. So she'd have acted much the same. She may have took some different stances, she might have been better on masks for example. But much and much she'd have walked the same path as Trump did because that's what her masters would have told her to do. That's my view of this anyway. That's what I mean by "neither have an ideology". They just do whatever the fuck they're told.
so no
I don't believe Clinton or Trump actually have an ideology
That's not better though
Clinton just masked her corruption with a veil of respectability
I honestly believe it
That's his main thing
I don't think he is, I think he's a marketing guy
we have evidence of that
He knew exactly what he was doing
The moron argument doesn't land with me
Realistically if Hawaii was going to jump ship it'd be independence
Not to my knowledge
No
God, it'd just be the second US takeover then
I kinda doubt that, the other pacific islands have maintained a fairly high degree of independence
Pretty much all they talked about was Covid Coco
I was trying to be as reasonable as possible there
Well, actually I'm Scottish/English but I live in Aus
I'm Australian Matt
Like, I'm super sympathetic to native Hawaiians, I really do think they deserve a hell of a lot more autonomy and Hawaii never should have been annexed by the US. But actually hoping for war is not a good thing. I'm a pessimist, I think it's more likely than not at this point, but I don't want it.
Most of the people talking to you right now are not Americans
Keahi, I've literally said before that the west are responsible for most of the world's problems. Colonialism is possibly the worst thing to happen to this world. That doesn't mean that every westerner is responsible for this. The vast majority of westerners are people who are oppressed by capitalism. It really is a couple of percent at most who are really responsible for most of the problems of the world. Yes, it's a problem that people support their own oppression but that's an entirely different issue.
I don't think they'd just accept rebelling US states even if it was completely safe for them to do so
Accepting a region that just left another country isn't exactly a stabilising force and Canada still has to think about Quebec
I hope Texas blows itself up into 6 states then all 6 succeed, that's how you make a statement
which is also not OK
He also continued bombing 7 countries carried over from Bush
which is not fucking OK
But that still means that Obama decided to start bombing one new country
One
I believe
8
It's really that simple
I can't live with voting for a party that is
And? At least they're not known for starting wars and overthrowing governments.
In that situation I'm just going to go out and vote Greens because I don't hate them
It's not, but nor is letting Biden win
*also the US gov deposed our Labor leader for stepping out of line was a Democratic government
Wrong. This shit has happened around the world under both parties. It has nothing to do with fascism, it's the neoliberal world order supported by both parties. Do you know what the consequence of that for any leader who dares to step out of their designated place and isn't backed by a huge military is?
Trust me, I wish the US elections had no impact on my country but we've been stuck with the same garbage neoliberalism as most of the world because of Regan and everyone who followed him.
The US has deposed a leader in my country, as well as many around the world. I am directly effected by US elections but neither of the options would actually be positive to me.
At some point you just have to say "fuck it" and stop supporting the system
Every election for the last 30 years has been the most important election in US history
Fuck the Republican party and fuck the other Republican party
Yeah, if I were in the US I'd happily vote Greens and not really feel bad about it at all
If he can't get those votes the only person to blame is himself
They might be good enough for you but a lot of left wingers have made it very clear that they aren't good enough for them
Also, vote Lord Buckethead
It's a politician's job to win those voters, not the voter's responsibility to vote for the politician. If Biden wants those voters he should give them a reason to vote for him, not just arguments to vote against Trump.
If there were any it would likely overrun the country pretty fast since it has a decently high density and pretty much no ability to deal with it
I legit believe there's probably no Covid in N-Korea
It's pretty implausible
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
but like, all you hear is how shit he is
Result, we're down to like 10 cases a day now
Mel, my state's premier has been getting attacked for keeping Melbourne in lockdown for the last few months
My brain is weird
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjBKi3nobsg
Why did that make me think of this?
There's a lot of very valid reasons why people who'd often vote Dems didn't vote for her. One of the main ones is that she literally said "America's already great". This was the single dumbest thing she could have said on her campaign trail (other than Pok√©mon Go to the polls, but that was less damaging, just dumber). She ceded to Trump the role of 'the candidate of change'. 

The average working person in the US is fucked right now, and has been since 2008 at least. The last election gave these people the choice between "I'm definitely not changing anything" and "hand grenade". Are you really surprised they chose the latter?
He got more votes in key labour areas because he railed against neoliberalism constantly. "The forgotten man and woman will never be forgotten again". He also lied. A lot.
They did not
But Obama and Biden had a chance to course correct
Reagan is the starting point
Oh, for sure
Obama and Biden created Trump
No, Trump is in office because he offered a break from Neoliberalism whilst running against one of the most corrupt Democrats in history. Moreover even if you gave Clinton every Green vote, which is unrealistic anyway she still would have lost. She barely wins if you give her every Green and Libertarian vote, but statistically Libertarians preferred Trump to Hillary. The reason Hillary lost is because of Hillary.
Yes, our society is massively desensitised to violence, that's the main difference
Konata from Lucky Star is older than Joeseph Joestar, arguing anime ages is fraught, to say the least
~~almost like a single party never actually represents a majority of people and systems that try to force them to do so are bad~~
Proportional representation will never be allowed because it favours parties other than the big two. I don't know of a country with proportional representation that doesn't have a coalition or minority government.
There's a certain irony about the US imposing the same relationship on PR that supposably lead to their own rebellion against the UK though
Doesn't seem like an area that would vote for him even if they could
Would he even stand a chance in Puerto Rico?
At the same time, harassing back is not the answer
Yeah, kinda inclined to agree with Carolnein there. It'd be one thing if they said "I'm uncomfortable with what I see from the community". It's the hard accusations of paedophilia that I think go too far. Like, I wouldn't be too hard on them because they're a kid, but I can understand why people, especially those who were mentioned would be pissed off.
It also makes sense that people might want to be a bit evasive if they feel like you're trying to tie their views to something that's horrible.
Here's why canon age is a terrible measuring stick, Oshino Shinobu is canonically 600ish years old. Literally, cannot be used due to the nature of the medium.
The only real issue I have with child pornography is the harm it causes to children in its creation and distribution. So as long as the drawings aren't based off of an actual child I don't really have an issue with it.
you probably won't see the full effects of puberty but there'd be an effect
Puberty is basically just a flood of hormones through the body, fundamentally you still have the receptors there waiting to receive the hormones.
I think it was like 1/1000 births ish
Yeah Matt, XXY chromosome arrangement isn't just possible, it's actually pretty common and does have effects similar to what you're describing in some cases.
What I'd strongly disagree with is the idea that the contents, if true mean nothing. It's a display of staggering corruption. And the thing is, even if these emails are fabricated it's pretty obvious that Biden has used his position for the career benefit of his son, which isn't OK when he does it or when Trump does it.
You see, here's the thing. I haven't fallen for anything. I don't trust any of the fucks. They all have vested interests, the guy you linked very obviously included. That's why I don't really want to comment too much on its authenticity because I have no idea who the fuck's lying.
They show that Biden used his position and influence to get his son into jobs and that Hunter also used his father's position to enrich himself. Democrats have rightly pointed out how problematic it was when Trump did this, so they aren't nothing. They're clear signs of corruption. I'm not going to comment too much on the authenticity, but I will say that you don't get to just throw out things you don't agree with as inauthentic. There really isn't evidence one way or the other.
Also, it's not that hard to push anti US rhetoric. You can do it using the truth.
They're actively trying to use your information to make the most money they can, normally that comes at your expense
Corporations aren't just saying "buy my game"
I personally don't see a huge issue with that, it's not like it's any worse than corporations doing the same.
China probably doesn't give a flying fuck about you. There's a lot of hysteria about designated bad guy number 1 spying, but the fact of the matter is, if you're not someone they have an actual reason to spy on they just won't use the data.
cya <:BayonetHug:745998190339424337>
just answer honestly
you shouldn't really need to ask a doctor questions, they'll ask you them
Just explain the symptoms and what you're unhappy with honestly
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
but yeah, in any case taking testosterone is probably a pretty good solution
There's a few things that I think of when I hear this, I actually have a genetics major so I can take guesses at what may be happening here genetically but can't really say for sure
just next time you see a doctor in general mention it
Yeah, I would
I'm on team "get a doctor's opinion" though. They'll probably just want to take a blood test and work out exactly what's happening, which is better than us sitting here making guesses.
and at that point they've proven they're a party worth killing anyway <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
because more and more people would start thinking that's unacceptable and ditching them (they're not going to win anyone who already have either) resulting in worse and worse average results.
If they chose to move further right then they'd have chosen the "die" option
Because voting for Biden perpetuates the status quo. He's literally talking about "going back to normal". Normal is shit. I don't think voting 3rd party is a cure-all, but it's preferable to voting for the person who helped create the Trupm presidency and is already talking about recreating it. At least if a significant percentage were to vote Greens it would show the Dems that they can't just take the left for granted and that a better candidate than Trump could steamroll Biden without their support, so they'd better do something to earn it or die.
Kat, I've already said if I were in the US I'd vote Greens without thinking twice. I actually refuse to support this kind of shit.
Kat, my response to all of that is that we shouldn't be accepting of any corruption regardless of which side does it. Dems have been whining about Trump's family nepotism for years now, rightfully so. Here you have an example of Biden doing the same thing. Regardless of the scale, to not condemn it is pure hypocrisy and I don't know what you're personal response to that would be but I've seen far too many try to dodge the issue or excuse corruption when it's their side.
And no, the Dems will not change the system
Maybe you should try looking at the states that flipped to him and what they share in common. All of the states that went to Trump with the exception of Florida are the states that have been the most fucked by neoliberalism. The reason why a second Trump is inevitable is because these states are not going to stop being fucked by neoliberalism. They'll suffer just as much under Biden as they did under Trump and as they did under Obama. Until someone actually comes along with a direction for them they'll likely just swing back and forth blaming the last person who was in office for not doing anything to help them, and they're really not wrong to do this. The number of votes these states were lost by isn't super important, it's just that they were lost and the reasons why they were lost.
Which is fine, I don't have an issue with it. But there's various reasons why I don't agree with the logic
They both ran revolutionary campaigns and then just didn't.
Trump was a huge deviation from the norm, he's what I'd consider a revolutionary campaign even if a lot of his policy hasn't been. The fact he won shows that people are through with gradualism. The same logic can also be applied to Obama in 2008, by the way.
Revolution can be the conclusion of a system, see most feudal states.
like, for starters, 2016?
There have been more than two points of revolutionary change in US history
and he made his own party capitulate on the bill by threating to support primary challenges against them.
He made the courts capitulate on the majority of the bill by threating to literally stack the court
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
You just used one of the more revolutionary acts in the US's history as an example of gradualism
No, but voting for the Dems at this point is just voting for more deadlock
I don't believe in gradualism at all. I see politics as periods of complete deadlock followed by rapid change. It's rarer for things to change gradually than for a sudden change that completely rewrites how politics works to happen.
it'll be Biden's fault
Yeah, this is what Dems do though. Blame everyone but themselves every time
Gore being a neoliberal PoS
Do you know what helped elect Bush?
He's just the end product of neoliberalism
you'll either get him now or get the same shit at some point down the line
A second round of Trump is inevitable
Yeah, the main thing I have an issue with is the whole "blame 3rd party for Trump" thing. I really don't give a fuck if people want to attack the hell out of me, feel free. 

What I'm worried about is the complete delusions that risk furthering the poor direction that I already see left wing parties across the world moving in. The attacks on 3rd wing parties causing Trump are 100% part of this because it's mostly a method of avoiding introspection. Blame everyone for your problems but yourself. IDK if I'd say anyone here's too bad for it, but I do see it a hell of a lot.
And I think pushing Biden left is a fantasy. If you're voting him as the lesser of two evils that's understandable, but he's not shifting left.
Or, even better, don't yell at anyone and try to understand why they actually did the thing
Of course if I explain the logic that makes me dislike a party it's going to contain an argument to not vote for them
Because I'm explaining my logic
I'm never going to
I have issues with voting for the Dems, I don't have issues with people taking the lesser of two evils logic themselves
Which has happened today
I very rarely see this as people hard trying to convince others to vote 3rd party. It's always Dems trying to tell people who vote 3rd party that they're literally voting for Trump.
Here's the issue with that logic, I've never told anyone not to vote for the Dems. I've explained why I wouldn't and my issues with them, if in spite of all that you'd still vote for them I do understand.
yes, because I believe that most of these problems stem back to the modern democratic party. It's kinda impossible to talk about why Trump won for example without talking about the problems of the Obama presidency.
no consequences for those that destroyed the economy, just more bailouts
And Obama just expanded it further
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008
For example, in the recession of 2008 Obama was far more willing to bail out billionaires than he was to offer actual support to people who'd lost their jobs.
With the continued support of systems, structures and corporations that continue to exploit these people.
To be clear here, this isn't why I wouldn't vote for Biden, it's my understanding of how Trump won in 2016
No, it's an argument that to actually regain those voters you need to give them something, it's a vulnerable group that corporate Dems are happy to condemn because it aligns with their own personal enrichment to do so.
Does that mean the choice can't be made sense of, also no
Was Trump the right choice to fix that, no
You're making a big assumption there, that the poor aren't a vulnerable group. Because that's who flipped the election to Trump. People who at one point had decent paying jobs and lost them due to offshoring and atomisation during the Obama years while Obama did nothing.
a government can fund anything they want to
They're completely able to
Yeah, it's not even a question
you're overanalysing
No, I literally just picked the musician with the silliest name I could think of
No, but it felt like an answer suitably serious for Kanye West running for office
Lil Wayne
I don't think this is productive
Aria, you trust here that I mostly agree with you right?
And the idea that every 3rd party voter would go Dems if forced to chose is uhhh, probably pretty wrong too.
Yep, absolutely
But they won a 3 seat majority due to complexities of the system and the Maori vote
Yes, 49.2%
Yeah, that's the main thing that put them up so high
NZ Labour got really, really popular
I think today's the first time I've ever heard of a national government winning a straight majority in a proportionally representative system.
I just get horny when I have nothing to do normally <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<a:PetTheChris:752719930314719305>
That's good to hear
Our states went hard on lockdowns though
Our worst day was like 700ish per day
Aus hasn't had a really bad breakout
We've been in lockdown since like April
I'm living in the city that's been in lockdown for the longest length of time at this point
Our PM's campaigning for a state party in Queensland while the entire pandemic is left on the shoulders of state leaders <:heh:496448769185808435>
I feel like the rest of Europe would have a few things to say about abortion bans in general
"Just be luckier"
Yeah, it sounds like it'd just remove a counterbalance against the sitting government
I don't know what KON's policy is but that's one hell of a name <a:miowink:424741626259308556>
it will explode
The difference is that we came out of our lockdowns with like 2 to 3 cases daily, which was still honestly too much but we still got down to very low numbers. Italy came out with 200 cases daily, you can't sustain that number at all.
If people have to move in state enforced quarantine. You cut off tourism completely though
Closed borders, now is not the time for globalisation
You're just much better off in the long term going hard and trying to keep cases at 0
Because Aus had I think 2 today
OK, how many cases does Italy have per day right now and what's the impact of that on the economy?
All their economies are doing better now
look at NZ at this point, or SK, or even Aus
It hurts the economy less than just letting the virus exist
I hard disagree
You know NZ's enterprise is doing pretty well right now since they don't have many restrictions.
It's just been handled differently in the eastern hemisphere and I genuinely believe it's been handled a whole lot better.
Why though? Melbourne had one case yesterday and is still in full lockdown. That's because our goal is actually to be able to lift lockdowns and have a time period where we don't need harsh restrictions. Turns out NZ is actually a pretty good model.
Queensland is several times bigger than Italy
The entire states of Victoria, NSW and Queensland all entered lockdowns at one point or another
But we also put entire states in lockdown
Melbourne has 5 mil alone
Yeah, we actually did that
Almost all of Victoria's population live near Melbourne city. We just enforced border restrictions around Melbourne, and then we enforced state borders.
Actually quite a lot, the region around Melbourne contains a lot of regional cities like Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong.
The point is that if you can contain the spread to those cities you've really actually got an easier task than Aus as long as you keep borders closed, enforce quarantines and don't piss it away.
Any other cities are just going to be comparatively even smaller than Melbourne and Sydney
The thing here is that almost all our spread was contained in large cities. So the majority of spread was occurring in dense areas in Aus. Also I used Rome because it's the biggest city in Italy.
Yeah, but even still they probably reopened early. And just BTW for population numbers our cities are bigger than Italy's. Both Melbourne and Sydney have 2x the population of Rome and they're where the majority of cases in Aus have happened.
If you just give up after two weeks or a month you may as well have done nothing
No, I disagree fundamentally. Aus and NZ's long lockdowns have saved so many lives.
yeah, that's what we have here
You see, the thing here Cypher is that Aus, NZ and most of Asia have committed to further lockdowns as needed to keep the virus down. No-one here (except our stupid feds) are claiming victory. It's more that we know we need case numbers low to maximise the length of time before the next lockdown.
But here's the thing, the economy is a bullshit story we created. Ultimately if humans want we can change anything. Covid's already kinda shown that with many countries mass increasing welfare, intoducing UBI ect, things that were impossible a year ago. What isn't bullshit is people's lives. We can change the economy. We can't bring people back from the dead. We should prioritise fighting the virus.
Legit though, there's other ways to help industry too. Rent forgiveness is one way. It'll hurt the renters but that's just hitting hyperwealthy capitalists anyway.
That'd stop tax fraud pretty fucking fast
Alternatively you can just throw them in jail like you would a poor person who did the same thing and cease what you're owed from their accounts
^
What's the alternative? Mass death?
yes?
Yeah, in the EU you'd just need to like, tax to offset
There's nothing to stop a government just propping up industry.
I kinda disagree ideologically, because a government can just run up debt to solve the issue.
And you can always lock down early, at 2 or 3 cases a day and actually have a 2 week lockdown if you're at 0 cases
Sorry, you're right there. 0 as long as no further introductions happen is stable. There's ways to prevent those though.
What do you recon 200 would give you if those are the odds with 5 cases?
The only stable number of cases in an epidemic is 0. If your number per day is anything other than 0 you are on borrowed time, at least unless your numbers are trending downwards. Any number other than 0 will eventually grow. Lower numbers buy you on average more time. Given enough time even one case per day will cause an outbreak. There's extensive modelling done here that shows that at 5 cases a day there is a 3% chance of another outbreak by the end of the year. By the end of 2021 it's more like 50% chance, because virus's are asshats.
There's certainly differences, but to claim a culturally diverse region can't stay united long term ignores a lot of historical empires with long reigns, including some in China
I don't see why not, they were both highly authoritarian, culturally diverse states
The western Roman Empire lasted for 500+ years
China's been improving their pollution issues every year, but believe that if you want.
really
They kinda still do
NK will last for as long as they have China's support and collapse the day after they lose it
Extreme authoritarianism, for all its faults is very stable when there's no outside influences
I think China is a lot more stable than most western states
Welfare
So, what I view as an increase in fascism across the world is a reduction of right wing economic policy in favour of more racial policy (often this include pinning societies problems on immigrants), an increase in the use of racial dogwhistles in politics by both the moderate and far right and a tendency of the far right to just drop the dogwhistles altogether and just be explicitly racist. This is where fascism starts because it's a primer for the creation of an us vs them mentality and a race war. In some countries conservatives have started to embrace early stage fascist policy, introducing things that make life and especially voting harder for those of different races to their own. 

I personally view this as particularly problematic not only for the obvious reasons, but also because it's used to misdirect worker frustrations. "Don't blame the rich for your living conditions, blame powerless migrants living in even worse conditions than you". It's problematic that pro-worker policy is being crushed by racism and that the left wing base is increasingly becoming richer and more affluent and losing its working class roots. The left has been baited into a terrible situation by not putting our foot down sooner and stopping this.
not at fringe parties
Look at the right wing of your mainstream parties
and somehow social democracy is now the left fringe
There's been a hard shift of the Overton window rightwards to the point where the right fringe of mainstream politics is fascism.
Let's just do better
The previous state sucked
Man, I don't want it to go back to the previous state
It's a historian thing to call them Byzantines
at the time, every state in western Europe called them the Romans
Yeah, but here's the thing
No, the west perceived the Byzantines as a different thing and gave them a different name retroactively. In 1453 when Constantinople fell they were known as the Eastern Roman Empire and considered themselves very Roman.
Fall of Rome was Constantinople
Yeah, in 1453
"The glory of Rome" worked for over 2000 years, so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Rome and China both use very similar propaganda/militarism.
OK, but what evidence do you have that they can't survive today? Because the other similar countries I see in the world seem to be doing OK generally
signed the guy from the country that elected Tony fucking Abbott
You say that, but about half the world has meme leaders at this point
Martyred by his own inability to effectively handle a pandemic <:heh:496448769185808435>
It helped to spark the Protestant reformation, literally one of the most important and divisive moments in European history.
And the act could cause wars
<@!378750276057694213> , this isn't about mistranslating VS good translation, it's to do with the fact that for hundreds of years the very act of translating the Bible was viewed as heretical and saw multiple kings lose their thrones on attempting. It literally didn't matter if their translation was the gold standard.
https://theconversation.com/finally-at-zero-new-cases-victoria-is-on-top-of-the-world-after-unprecedented-lockdown-effort-148808
Pretty happy with what my state's managed to do
Some states still allow their state voters in the electoral to go out and completely ignore how people actually voted and vote for whoever they feel like too
There's also just pure energy efficiency as a big reason. I have my doubts that chemical fuels are going to be the long term method of powering aeroplanes, so if you're trying to fly an electric plane it may just end up being better to do so at high altitudes. I don't know all of the details on that though.
I doubt subsonic air travel will be used for anything bar freight for that long
What height will regular air travel be at in 100 years?
~~also I have my doubts that conventional rockets would be used over megastructures for a particularly long time, but that's another thing~~
The thing that makes me think that space travel would really blur the line is that altitude and distance become pretty much the same thing when you're in a rocket.
But that's still a pointless conversion causing an accident, which is why they just don't now.
My bad, I was just going off of memory there
Most famously, the Mars lander
That's why NASA uses 100% metric now
There have been multiple aerospace accidents caused by conversions
Eventually the cost to training (a running cost) outweighs the one time cost to change, assuming imperial is in every other way dead
Or like, the F/P/A triangle only works in metric
I have literally never seen the use of imperial in sciences and based off of what I've heard it's not used in the sciences in the US. There's a very good reason for this, there's units such as molarity used in sciences which just kinda doesn't work in imperial and conversions between units like a volume of water (L) to its mass (kg) is easy in metric and insanely complex in imperial.
Kinda failed though because I actually have a Bachelor of Science majoring in Genetics, so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Genetics
I have a science degree, trust me here, scientists do not use imperial
It cites other papers
http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/CostOfNonMetrication.pdf
we're well past it, it's just stubbornness and political reasons now
No, we've reached that point Hana
Why is speed for ships measured in knots though?
and they don't use them for good reasons, they use them for historical reasons.
Yeah, how'd that argument work for the other imperial system holdouts?
and the argument I'm making here is cultural, I'm saying that if Imperial dies, and I believe it will then there's no real reason to not update the old way of doing things. The idea that we can't make a safe transition is laughable given that many countries already have and over time you'd expect people involved in aeronautics to become more skilled in day-to-day use of metric anyway. It's a similar case where holding on to the dead system, in the long term doesn't make sense.
But like, when we're calculating, say, distance we can obviously change the maths by just changing the units. If I chose to measure in meters vs feet the maths is going to look incredibly different.
or at least our understanding of it does
Also, maths changes and evolves with time
At least Metric tried to be based off of some universal constants, it mostly failed hilariously, but like, D+
Both are bendable, ever-changing and ever evolving
Arguably the units of measurement you use have more to do with culture than science anyway, especially when that unit of measurement is Imperial.
A meter was meant to be one ten-millionth the circumference of the Earth from pole to the equator, which would have actually made km N/S a decent latitude replacement at least, but that one didn't work out
Sure, but that position can be measured using literally anything you want logically. If you really wanted you could make a device that measured only in distance and direction from Kansas City centre.
My understanding of the GPS system is that it essentially just uses time as a measure. The GPS device pings visible satellites and waits for a response, it takes the time it took to receive a response and and uses it to calculate a distance then uses that distance to triangulate a location. All of the logic onboard the device is responsible for calculating actual distances and they can theoretically be made to work with any measurement without too much hassle.
I know there is a way to create a ring that goes between two other rings at different altitudes which is stable
I believe there was a theoretical way to make a stable non-circular orbiting ring, I could be wrong though
We can build loops at different altitudes also attached to towers and potentially close enough to other rings on non-circular orbits to jump between as well <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
But a launch loop is less cool <:ChrisPout:660514247733674021>
Yeah, that's the upfront cost
even if they don't then you've still saved them the whole "cost to escape the atmosphere" thing
or have to use far less
The counteracting thing to that is that you can launch your satellites from the ring, meaning they don't have to use fuel to get into orbit at all
Europe's only been following them for the last two millennia, why stop now?
Why do you think Rome was rebuilt in marble?
That's the point <:ChrisPout:660514247733674021>
Orbits exist in 3 dimensions
We just have to solve that whole "our current materials are kinda shit" thing
Also, it's not like rings have no advantages of their own, they have land areas comparable to entire nations contained within them and a built in highspeed rail system assuming you use a magnetically attached counter-spinning ring to generate gravity.
<:ChrisPout:660514247733674021>
Na, I'm still team space elevator and orbital rings
I mean, I'm pretty sure the idea of a space elevator is raw long-term efficiency
~~space elevators are objectively awesome~~
My futurist side just wants to say "fuck it, use orbital rings" but uhh, maybe one day?
A good start would be removing the culture of "you must follow orders" from the military and actually encouraging free thought and allowing defiance.
Just make it clear to the US that their BS isn't tolerated
Best bet is for other countries to close all US military bases and rather than announcing all known US spies in parliament just arrest them.
To be clear though, the US will oppose and try to stop even the smallest movements towards nationalisation in any country
This is a specific weakness of Australia's system allowing and explicitly enshrining international influence. The person who dismissed the PM was the Queens representative who's generally agreed to have had CIA ties. If we were a republic that wouldn't have happened. It's worth noting that Norway (also a constitutional republic, but one that has its own monarch at least) implemented very similar changes to what Whitlam wanted to, the US just couldn't do anything about it because they don't have a huge weak point in their constitution.
It always has been
and that's a big part of the militaries problem, all militaries that are allied with the US have some degree of US influence
Yeah, US influence on international politics is pretty problematic
Also, I'm specifically rather concerned with the influence of the US military and US intelligence organisations on my country. I do find the fact that a socialist Australian PM lost his job a day before he was set to read out the name of all known US spies operating in the country on the floor of parliament rather concerning.
No, I'm very worried about the military interfering with democracy
I'd counter that counter by saying expecting the command to completely fail is pretty much a fantasy
I mean, even if you're not do you really want the organisation that props up coups against any South American/Middle Eastern government that starts getting a little red leading your revolution?
I don't think it's worth talking about the potential of military personally, rather just thinking about how they act at current. At current they're the tools of enforcing national interest, maybe there was a time where they'd be willing to put public interests first, but it's not true anymore. Militaries are very active in the enforcement of capitalism as of the cold war, to separate them from police forces seems dishonest to me.
From a personal point of view I'm extremely anti military and would rather be unemployed dealing with poverty than in the military because I so fundamentally disagree with supporting an organisation that I view as so destructive to the world.
To be fair most of those things are at least theoretically basic rights in the UK
I really good place to start is not concentrating the ability to dictate facts to a few hyper-rich fucks
By the way, if they were regulated as utilities the stuff they've been banning recently would, in the US at least fall under freedom of speech. Literally the regulation would probably result in them being able to censor less, not more.
Here's a better idea, either the censor no-one at all, or they admit to being a publisher and are regulated like one. Because if they're choosing what can and can't be seen they're publishing and need to be bought in line for all of the laws they don't conform to on that side.
literally the last people I want choosing what should be and shouldn't be seen
They're run by some of the worlds richest people
Fantastic, why did the left want to give Facebook and Twitter the ability to censor people again?
https://twitter.com/sunraysunray/status/1320078487970041856?
None of them are really fit for purpose
God, I wish we'd have a political reform and kill of the three old parties.
PSL, mostly because when I hear Polish People's Party I have a very different mental image to their policy
OK, that's one of the stranger political parties I've ever searched
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Service-Members%27_Protection_Act#:~:text=ASPA%20authorizes%20the%20U.S.%20president,the%20%22Hague%20Invasion%20Act%22.
basically because I think the self interest of the average person is less destructive than the military's direction as an organisation.
Also Meiyi, I'm talking about the plebs, the average, foot solder servicemen, not the generals ect when I say "act more in their own self interest".
Personally this is where I think the UN needs to be empowered more. They should realistically be able to step in and try any member of any military for war crimes. They can already for many, but there's still the usual suspects who hold off on granting them this ability against their militaries.
The shooting of Irish protestors on Bloody Sunday was technically lawful
Also, lawful doesn't equal morally correct
In practice that's impossible Meiyi. The military have the guns.
Ehhh, I see what you wrote more as part of the problem. Why do I want a military that's loyal to the military above all else? I'd honestly prefer them to be more self interested.
what's that in response to Coco?
I'm sure the Scots would take well to English military police showing up there and totally not revolt.
Also, if you want to see what politics can look like when there's less corruption look at a nation like Sweden. They're not perfect or anything but the fact that any money politicians receive has to be publicly declared helps a hell of a lot.
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
Yeah, the Australian gov tried to blame the BLM protests for our spike in Melbourne until it was confirmed that there were 0 cases from the event and they promptly forgot they ever said it
or am I reading it wrong?
So that would result in a higher % positive test rate right?
Ok, but the reason why this position isn't tenable is because all the dumbass "centrists" will start talking about how Jacobin is literally as bad as right wing press outlets and praise Twitter for censoring them. The left needs to realise that any power the rich are allowed to have will be immediately used against us, so it's not in our best interests to want them to have it.
and really importantly, if there's transparency around what is and isn't allowed you're not resting control over information in the riches hands
That's why I favour a very simple solution, if you take that stance and enforce it evenhandedly it cuts most crap that needs to be cut out without going way too far
Considering everyone involved in starting that war deserves to be tried in the Hauge
Quite frankly I'd be more on board with censoring that garbage than the results of the Bolivian election
Is the political opinion a call to violence, if yes then block it, if no then don't
To be fair I'm not actually advocating for 4chan, I'm sorry if I made it seem like I was. They should still ban things that break the law, incitement being the big case here. What they shouldn't be censoring are political opinions and journalism. Facebook has a recent trend of blocking established journalists from publishing when they don't like what they're publishing, which is just <:ChrisYikes:679341065878241292>
Yeah, definitely do
I refuse to ever touch them personally
I have a very specific distaste for cigarettes because of how badly they messed up my uncle
What most people who support marijuana legalisation argue isn't that it's harmless, but rather that it's no more harmful than alcohol which is a legal substance
There's a period of very low infectivity early on in infections before symptoms show. It's still quite possible you wouldn't have been
Just a couple of points here, firstly your father getting tested doesn't mean he has covid, secondly it's not impossible to avoid getting infected even in the same household as someone who is, you just have to be a hell of a lot more careful
Watching One Nation fall apart in the Queensland election is pretty nice
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
Society has about mature of a view on this shit as the average 8 year old
Na, go ahead, I'm not bothered
Tobacco I'm OK with as long as there's a good federally funded service to help people quit but I'm still not 100% onboard
Yeah, I'm kinda onboard with sugar taxes
I generally think most of the methods that have been used by Aus to tackle smoking are pretty decent. Can't have any images on the packaging other than the mandated "smoking fucks you up" images. Packs of cigarettes have to be kept out of plain sight. Federally funded services to help people quit smoking. Only thing I'm not so sure on is hiking the price to absurd levels with taxes since it's a bit "punish the poor"ish
The issue here is that the US has federal supremacy. A state can decriminalise drugs, but if a federal gov wanted that to end they could force it to.
I'm pretty convinced that the Portuguese method on drugs is just strictly superior to the vast majority of countries and probably would actually work in most countries at least
I'd strongly recommend going to a doctor early rather than waiting for that to happen
Those aren't what most people mean when they say "infection". In common use infection is colloquial terminology for a bacterial infection. The vast majority of these come about from small cuts on the skin.
You totally can get a big cut and not get an infection, it just depends how well your immune system does stopping it
It depends on if you disinfect, but it's kind of random chance as well
Yes, that's worth seeing a doctor for
yes, of course
is already a legal opioid
For one, morphine
I view it as a way for government to step in and regulate what's actually being sold as they do with alcohol. Alcohol with methanol in it will fuck you up too. And on heroin, you don't legalise the drug as it exists, you legalise some form of opioid based substitute that is less harmful and undercut the heroin dealers as they exist.
Where I differ from you here is that I don't actually see stopping people starting as needed. To be clear here I actually support full drug legalisation, I just believe that decriminalisation is good enough and more passable.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Mostly because I really don't give a fuck if people want to take whatever drugs they want
That depends on the form of decriminalisation, personally I'm fine with full decriminalisation where we don't explicitly legalise drugs but remove all forms of enforcement options and open voluntary rehabs
Drug decriminalisation isn't about tackling that issue. The thing you need to understand here is that the high price on medicine is mostly a US issue amongst most highly developed countries. The goal of drug decriminalisation is to reduce the number of deaths from drug overdoses and to allow rehab to operate more easily
Aus politics pisses me off. Our population is actually decently progressive, if things like drug decriminalisation and a political corruption watchdog went up to a referendum they'd almost certainly pass, and notably gay marriage did. But there's just so many idiots here who vote for a party "because their parents did" or "because that's how people here vote" and out compulsory voting is just making the issue far worse.
In Poland I take it?
The spread of antibiotic resistance isn't wholly driven by natural selection. There's a point at which resistance is common enough that genetic drift takes over. Since in many cases, especially for weaker antibiotics there's no real cost to having the resistance gene it can also just spread randomly through the pop. At a certain percentage uptake the near complete adoption of antibiotic resistance genes becomes inevitable.
This is also why the use of antibiotics in agriculture is such a problem. Most bacteria that exist in cows can't actually survive in the human body for that long. But they can, if they enter the body exchange genetic information via plasmids with human bacteria, even the ones that we need to live and then those bacteria can handball it off to an infectious pathogen.
At worst you just speed up this process slightly
But realistically using "weaker" antibiotics where resistance already exists to treat basic infections isn't really as bad as you might think. Once resistance exists the timer on that drug's already started. Bacteria can trade genetic information, it's a matter of time until such a high percentage of the world's bacteria are immune to the drug that it's effectively useless.
If it's being prescribed to people with a cold or whatever, then yes, that needs to stop
Here's the thing, ultimately I just disagree with you on the definition of 'over-prescription'. I don't think that prescribing antibiotics to anyone who has a clear case of a bacterial infection is a bad thing.
Which by the way, the US still allows so they're not doing anything to curb the creation of new antibiotic immune bacteria.
Also, the majority of antibiotic immune bacteria haven't come from human antibiotic use. They've came from agricultural antibiotic use. They've then spread to other bacteria via plasmids.
They actually don't know that Iski, it's assumed unlikely that it exists in that strain, but it's not impossible.
Yes, but the immunity already exists in this case
That's because America generally misuses antibiotics from what I've heard. In Aus there's different categories of antibiotics. The kind that you will be prescribed for an infection is the kind that most superbugs are already immune to. They're designed to stop most infections without creating new strains of antibiotic resistance.
I've personally never heard of antibiotics being refused for an obvious bacterial infection regardless of severity, then again, Australia actually practices preventative healthcare.
Actually, they're fairly in line after our last Labor gov I believe. The UK has lower ownership but the process for getting a gun is very similar.
It helps a lot
I'm a supporter of very strict firearm laws that ideally legislate them out of existence. When I look at Japan and Korea, they're just so much safer than Aus and the UK and the gun control is a huge part of that. And of course, Aus and the UK are a bit safer than say, Switzerland (statistically) and the US is just, not comparable.
The dangerous thing about gun ownership is the gun
yeah, I was just sitting here thinking "is it really worse than labouring though?"
Nevis I'd make that argument about literally any workplace
Brothels feel a lot safer to me though, at least just thinking about it logically. If you go into a room with a person you don't know that carries risk. A brothel theoretically should help to reduce that by allowing you to hire security and such.
I generally think it's a good idea
Yep, Aus has legal brothels too
Also Cypher, I live in a country with both of those
and like, I'd just feel more comfortable if the majority of drug users were getting their drugs from something confirmed as safe
For me this is more about accepting the drug trade as an inevitability and asking "how do we deal with this as a society"
But I'd still prefer for someone to risk addiction from a government seller who has ties to rehab centres and has complete knowledge of what's in their drugs than a random street dealer
<:momoWhyAreYouLikeThis:692154033485643797>
and they made me mail a ballot
There was one fucking candidate
Anyway, I have no choice but to vote, I had to vote in a local election I really didn't care much about recently too <:sigh:230149462880813056>
Yeah, but if they wanted someone who'd, say, crack down on corruption or end wars I feel like not voting here is pretty valid
Am I the only one who thinks that not voting for a specific reason is a valid political stance and people who didn't vote should be allowed to complain about politics, especially if their take was "I hate all of you"?
which still seems like overkill to me
I've only ever seen them in airports
Oh, I guess then
From what I've seen it tends to just lead to the arseholes in the police force making some terrible decisions
especially if gun ownership is low
Yeah, I don't get the whole arming of police forces thing
~~ban me from driving forever so I have an excuse~~
Yep, what Iski said. Gangs here have guns but they don't have many (less than total membership) and they'd only use them as a last resort
actually much less dangerous than handguns
Yep, most of the guns here are riffles
they were from pre 1996 when our laws were looser
Almost every gun that was turned over was illegal already
There was an armistice recently
Yeah, same here. Licences that require mental health checks and reason, no automatic weapons or handguns ect.
<:BayonetHug:745998190339424337>
That's what they did last time
Blame the Greens
It was so bad it went from the east coast, fuck up NZ, fucked up South America then wrapped around and started fucking up Perth
Na, I'm talking about soot and ash from the bushfire
There was a day where I had to walk down to the bank for something, like a 15 minute walk and I could barely breath
Last year was just, fucked as hell
Yeah, but can you spew so much shit into the atmosphere that it wraps around the entire globe and starts actually reducing the air quality on the west coast of your country?
<a:02fine:465210481343332352>
It's fine really
We just have to deal with half the country being on fire every so often
Feels good to live in a country where the biggest threat you face is, well, the country
The ABC over here (who I trust a lot) have 227 to 213
Hawaii votes later because it's in the middle of the ocean pretty sure
Timzones
Not that many
These people have a problem seeing reality
Listening to dem strategists though, talking about how many supporters Trump has lost <:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
It does feel to me like Trump is pretty likely to win from here though. If everything else has been better for him than expected then why wouldn't the mail-ins also.

I could be wrong, but I think this looks pretty bad.
I was pretty sure it was going to be close
Oh, and Indiana, right
Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio and sometimes Illinois
Yes, sure, the enemy they voted for 2 times from 2008 to 2016
I think the take away from this is that, regardless of who wins the Dems really need to find a platform that's more acceptable for the rust belt
Wisconsin seems unlikely to me. 93% counted and ~4 point lead
It's like, the only thing they can do right
Weirdly enough, Fox actually has a great track record for calling accurately and early
What the fuck, I'm not meant to agree with this man
https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/1323890527767416834
I literally said to my brother that the election was likely to come down to how much antidemocratic bullshit Trump was going to be able to pull
Yeah, can't say I'm suprised
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
Feel like moving a little further north there Shemmy
Same effect for Alaska but less
Haven't we established by this point that US polling is really, really bad?
No Shemmy, I'm suggesting that if the Dems want to do better they should introspect rather than blaming everyone else. They ran a shit campaign twice that really didn't appeal to these key states. If their response is to lash out again they're not going to make any progress.
Yes, but I believe all of them voted Obama 2008 and most 2012
They shouldn't have, it's a 5% difference with postal votes still to come. Really could go either way, just depends on exactly how strong the postal vote is.
No, no-one's called it yet
<:heh:496448769185808435>
Yeah, calling the election now would be very stupid
Nope, if Trump wins 4 of NC/Georgia/Michigan/Pennsylvania/Wisconsin he wins, if Biden wins 2 he wins
So there's some decent news at least
We just had our 5th day of 0 cases in Victoria <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
I was wondering if they were increased restrictions but no lockdown
OK
Ah
Civil wars tend to happen when the army splits into a loyalist and revolutionary faction by the way. One side having an army doesn't usually matter because the very thing that makes the war possible, as opposed to just a coup is that the army splits.
It's more likely to flip than any other state left I think
I feel like PA flipping would be good even if there's no impact on the election at all though. It'd just make it harder for Trump to get results overturned
Phili's safe as fuck
Pennsylvania
The polls are too close to count either side out as of yet. It's not likely that the trend of mail ins changes, but it's also not impossible
He totally still does
It's been trending blue
also, note, you can win FPTP at 49.4%
That's not true Cypher, they're counting mail in now
especially if he only loses by 2
Oh, Trump is going to keep fighting and trying to find ways to undermine the result
Like, it wasn't likely to happen but that would have been a giant clusterfuck
Imagine the fuckery if Trump took Nebraska second
Most parties would opt to replace someone who died before an election, but I guess the US elections probably have some weird rules that make that less possible
I've never heard of that happening anywhere before
The US has been divided pretty much since the implementation of the Southern Strategy
It's a take that observes the evidence of what happened under the last two presidents
and a hostile Senate makes it more likely that people will be unhappy with him
They really are. A lot of people vote down party lines in the Senate and if they're unhappy with the Pres they'll punish the party.
When was the last time a sitting president won seats in the senate?
Plus, Covid isn't just going away
We're in late stage capitalism, that's unlikely.
Also, the Rep establishment doesn't really hate Trump
But the republican party voters are pretty much past listening to the establishment now. Trump is insanely popular amongst his voter base and if someone somehow related to him picked up a similar campaign the rep establishment couldn't beat them in the primary.
Ask the UK
and the Senate going red pretty much just 100% confirms that Biden won't do anything
TBH though, whether Trump or someone else runs in 2024 matters little. The cat's out of the box now. Someone will run in the primary with similar rhetoric, they'll probably win it too and if four years of Biden is what I expect they'll easily win the general with pretty much the same map as Trump in 2016.
There's two races in Georgia
Potentially 52 rep
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
I think there's a pretty high chance that Biden would pardon him
I think either candidate's going to struggle in office though, because the house has gone dems and the senate is looking to lean reps.
Sorry, that's the likely outcome assuming no more states flip
No, it's 270 to 268 from what I can see
The only way Trump could hit 269 is to magic Nebraska second out of his ass, which can't really happen
Yep, mandatory voting isn't good. It creates a huge incumbent bias and just winds up with uninformed and apathetic voters being a huge issue.
Shemmy, I missed that response until just now, but what I'll say is that forcing people who don't want to vote into booths doesn't produce good results. It just makes people hate the system.
That's the reason I'm saying "called to early". If there's a decent chance for something to flip back or a large unknown then you just shouldn't be calling.
AZ was called way too early though
It'd either be AZ or NV if he pulled it off
Trump needs to not only not lose any more states, but actually bring one back now
with few or no barriers
the idea that anyone who wants to vote should be allowed to
The words you're looking for are negligible disenfranchisement Melua
Which makes me very happy
I know this isn't the big story of the day but I'd like to bring attention to the fact that the "eat a dick Murdoch" petition in Australia got over 500k signatures and is now the most signed petition in Aus history
For voting to be mandatory there has to be some consequence to not doing so
or the closest equivalent in the US system at least
Nancy Pelosi is the PM
yes
There are parliamentary systems where people elect the President, the President is normally a weak, ceremonial role in them though
In that case Trump needs NV
So yeah, there's still a way
But Biden's at 264, -11 for AZ + 16 for GA=269
There's an even number of votes
Trump 268 in that case
is 269/269
Trump wins AZ/NV and Biden wins GA everything else stays as it is now
Also, 269 is a Biden win, the tie breaker is Congress
or if he flips both NV/AZ he can afford to lose another state as long as it's not PA
And not to lose other states
If we take AZ out of the won states bucket then he just needs one of AZ/NV
I just don't think that one's going to happen
I have my doubts about Georgia flipping
If the UK became a republic they very much would care
The monarchy's only allowed to exercise its ceremonial power because parliament tolerates it. Functionally they're actually more powerful in Aus/Canada/NZ since those countries have no real way to push back against the monarchy in a way they care about. They could become republics, but the monarchy wouldn't really care.
where they don't
A PM realistically requires the backing of the House with only a few niche cases
Uhhhh, no. PM and president are different roles. They mean different things. Countries can have one, both or neither.
Because what actually matters is the proportionally represented house, and the most powerful person in the country is the PM, the leader of the house
OK, but it's functionally a parliamentary system
The people in a vote
That's roughly how it works here, but you can still have a parliamentary system with an elected president. Iceland comes to mind, where the person with all the actual power is the PM.
also, there's a 0% chance that the Republicans are going to steer away from populism. It worked for them. Even now it's arguably working for them. This was an election they were predicted to lose by a historic margin due to inept governance and they haven't.
So like, why haven't they called Alaska?
Look, last election here I accepted food from at least 4 political parties
https://www.theonion.com/serbia-deploys-peacekeeping-forces-to-u-s-1819565829
When satire from 20 years ago is still relevant <:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Also, 270 isn't really a safe number since faithless electors could theoretically happen, so yeah, a larger margin is nice
because I really wouldn't be surprised if he actually loses one of them to court fuckery.
Ideally I'd like to see Biden take Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada just to make the result harder to contest
Yep
The entire idea of taking it to the courts is to get shot down at first and try to elevate to the supreme court that he rigged the fuck out of, I don't think it'll work but you have to be aware of it as a possibility
He can still do his court fuckery
Don't be too confident
Also, the way spellcheck treats approx. is jank as fuck
Yeah, most systems globally would end up with Trump winning approx. 8 seats in Georgia and Biden winning approx. 8 seats.
*looks at Brazil*
There are still worse democratically elected leaders in the world than Trump
Different systems produce different results. The US's is particularly bad though.
There's 100% going to be a recount in Georgia at this point
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Yeah, trump needs to pull a miracle out of his ass now
but I think with PA he's pretty safe
true that
Yep, PA was the most important state
Trump's been right about two things. Polls are crap and the media is too.
Polls haven't been particularly good in a while honestly.
I kept saying it would be close
yeah
I mean, I'd have considered $5 or so on him if I could be fucked because I really did think people were underestimating his chances. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I still love it
I know
I vote for using it to do... whatever this is
https://twitter.com/etienneshrdlu/status/1324674321336459264?s=20
(yes I posted this before, sue me)
yeah, it stops one faithless elector fucking up everything
That's how you **actually** start a civil war
<a:ChrisShift:671988771725770752>
Hard to believe the US has an electoral system that lets someone get millions less votes and still become president regularly
Holy hell Murdoch is cancer
To be fair Aria, recounts are actually a part of the democratic process. In absurdly close races like Georgia there really does need to be a recount, because it's really not impossible to gain a few thousand votes by human error randomly. It's happened before at least.

It's highly unlikely that this will change anything, but there should be recounts in every close state.
But Dems have been saying all they have to do is get Trump out of office for years
If he's gone then a ton of voters may not see a reason to actually vote
What I see as the issue here is that the Dems ran their entire campaign on "get rid of Trump"
Reps have been outperforming Trump in every vote, if that continues into Georgia run offs they get on or both pretty easy
I'm fairly certain the Reps are just going to win those two seats and maintain their majority though
Oh, for sure. That'd be the best result TBH. The more influence Sanders has the better
*as long as they don't try to do anything Sanders or King don't want
It's senate control*
That's why I said kinda
They're not really
Georgia's having two runoff elections. The Dems need to win both to kinda have senate control
Not really, the most closely related other virus to it was SARS
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
I love that we managed to come up with three different answers to that question all of which seem viable
Also, fuck Kamila Harris in general
The answer is because the pizza place has a captive audience. Some percentage of people eating there just want pizza but don't really like it. If they see another place while they're there they'll go there instead. If your pizza's actually better that gives you a huge advantage and you can use that to build up reputation and beat them out long term.
Across the road
The issue is that left leaning Democrats continue to support the Dems and as long as they do the Dems have no reason to ever pay them any attention. If someone's ultimately going to go out there and vote for you anyway why make any concesions to them?

For the Dems to actually move left the left wing of the party would have to start putting some form of legitimate pressure on them. That means that they'd have to go out and vote for someone other than the Democrats, which so far they really haven't been willing to do. 

In Aus the centre left party (Labor) can't get away with completely ignoring their left wing base because every time they've tried they've ceded ground to the Greens they've never been able to gain back. If Dems in the US were to say "fuck you, we're voting Greens/Socialist/anyone else" and some other left wing party got 5-10% of the vote they'd have to stop ignoring you. Until that happens they're just going to run further and further right.
Yeah, if he hadn't have dropped out and re-entered in 1992 there's a real shot he'd have won. He'd have almost certainly taken states
not often talked about, but neither was a particularly good candidate
Yeah, people hated Bush and Clinton
It was actually Ross Perot
Wrong candidate
Wait
But like, they'd also have an easier time if the Dems and Reps didn't significantly increase the bar to getting on the debate stage after 2000
*the minimum set by the Democrats and the Republicans because when Nader got on the stage he made them both look very, very bad
I'm down with regulating large social media companies as public utilities <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
There'll be a few cases of small scale fraud dug up and people will make a huge deal out of it
Yeah, gonna be honest here, there's a few things I agree with you on but trust me here, there isn't widespread voter fraud
Bush was one of the single most destabilising figures in recent history, far more so than Trump. He basically said "right, the middle east is already a smouldering powederkeg, let's just bomb it"
I'm inclined to agree on the Bush being worse than Trump point
Honestly, electronic voting shouldn't exist
Yeah, that shit's shady AF
Like, in the last Aus election there was legit a voting booth that had three votes because legally every Aus citizen has to have access to a booth if they're on Aus soil and technically Aus does consider the Antarctic territory part of our soil, so there had to be a booth there even though the gov knew there'd be three votes <:LuL:582156964276994063>
Oh, yeah, voter disenfranchisement in the US is a far bigger issue than voter fraud, no question
Mostly because it's hard
Just pointing out that faked votes isn't the most likely form of voter fraud to happen
Again, this would be extremely minor and non-targeted though. It wouldn't change any results.
Megan, throwing out legal votes is also a form of voter fraud, it's actually a whole lot more likely that this has happened than faked votes. Not due to any grand conspiracy or anything, things just get lost in the mail.
<a:02fine:465210481343332352>
<:BayonetHug:745998190339424337>
Yeah, I'm very glad that we have a viable Greens party
We do have a senate with veto power though, and that house is more controlled by balance of power minor parties
With the current coalition actually being two different parties that may as well not be
But we definitely have two and a half big parties
To an extent, it's not as bad as in the US
since 2013
The Liberal/National coalition's been in power for the last 7 years
Yep
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
We basically elected Trump in 2013
The reporter's just like "oh god, don't fucking do it"

Oh, also this is pretty <:ChrisYikes:679341065878241292>
I miss the Party! Party! Party! Party
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Just pointing out that every party here has a dumb name
Yes, but so is the fact that you agree more with the Australian Sex Party than the Australian Liberal Party
They held a seat in the Vic legislature and their successor party still does
The weird thing is, they're not even that much of a meme party
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Sex_Party
I find it hilarious that the PiS's campaign slogan is the same one that the Sex Party ran in the Victorian elections a few years back <:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Which was kinda the point I was making
From what I'm reading, and I'm by no means an expert on this the senate is the house that controls "referendums of national importance". To actually chance the constitution one of these would be required. So the senate can completely block them from non-democratic takeover.
They don't control the senate, which would be their first obstacle
From what I'm reading, no
Well, 1930's Germany had a lot of unique conditions that make it pretty hard to compare to most modern democracies. I don't know of a democracy today where someone can gain ~30% of the vote and be appointed to a position with the power to disassemble the democracy. As flawed as some modern democracies are they're not at Weimar Republic levels of fuckery where Hitler could just strongman himself from a few seats to absolute power.
The right tried the same trick here BTW. Because our Labor party is fundamentally built from the unions they didn't let them get away with it.
In spite of all his flaws, he has a history with unions
This is one of the very few good things about Biden
The left kinda let them though. Started picking people with absolutely no relationship to unions who were supported by corporate money and had no reason to support them. You ended up with Rep presidents going out and slamming them and Dem presidents just saying nothing.
Maybe if the left had maintained even the most moderate of trade unionist values in the US that would be a far harder claim for them to make.
Kinda problematic that the "left wing" has become so absurdly corporate that they're basically letting the right swoop in and take the mantle of "for the people" though Iski
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company
Similar idea though
No, that's the Dutch East India Company
The British East India Company, it's a historical example
There have been corps in history with very low government oversight, the best example being the East India Company. They did things so horrific that even the pro colonial British public at the time thought they'd went too far.
That's the issue
They don't operate like a government though
And a corporation without a government looks more like a mafia than a government
There's some very large differences
OK, but those things that the government does along with the ability to collect taxes allows them to do things like run at sustained deficits, which would cause corporations to go bankrupt.
Corporations don't have the ability to do things like print money or own very large public infrastructure which allows the government to function in ways that they cannot.
Hotter take, no
It always amazes me that the Libertarians are viewed as more viable than the Greens, I'll be honest
Pretty much "we want your boss to be able to own you"
Yeah, Libertarian politics are pretty garbage
No, guns never help
Just going to point out that the French Government is at any given time at a much greater threat of being overthrown than the US government. It has nothing to do with guns. It has to do with organisation and solidarity of the working class.
The government has tanks
The idea that gun ownership creates a threat of revolution is delusional
To me the more likely thing that'll happen is that Scotland breaks away taking it's more progressive population with it and the North just becomes even more dominated politically by the south
Scotland?
People underestimate how much of the US revolution was driven by rich slave owners worrying about their slave ownership and wanting to get richer
Africa would be in a hell of a lot better of a place
Trust me, corporations without gov would be far worse than governments.
You can also look up Standard Oil and the Ludlow Massacre for what happens when a corporation starts thinking they're above the law
They empirically do not. There are countries where they do not have access to guns.
I think there are cases where armed police can be deployed too, but they need a reason
Pretty much what Japan has
Police yes, military only within bases.
To be fair, I do think that an idea longer term goal is the complete banning of guns, but I could understand why the left in the US wouldn't want to pursue that.
Because removing the right to own guns is a positive. The default should be that you're assumed not to be allowed to own a gun and have to prove that you are in a state of mind acceptable to own one
>Yes, which is why the goal of the left in the US should not be to get guns of its own, that's an insane stance. The goal of the left in the US should be to impose some form of gun legislation immediately and their long term goal should be to make a constitutional amendment nullifying the second amendment.

This does not say ban guns anywhere
To start off with, stop supporting Reps and Dems
The issue is actually more to do with the way courts and the police interact than with the police themselves. If police were frequently arrested for breaking the law there'd be much fewer problems.
A much better solution is civilian oversight of a demilitarised police force where a civilian group has the ability to suspend officers and run their own investigations into the police.
If you thought the police were bad already
That's an accountability nightmare
You'd trust a civilian group for that?
There's plenty shit about the system too, but by shear luck it seems better than the US.
The UK's democracy is healthier than the US's. Not because of any design that makes it so, just because of fucking luck honestly. Labour, even under Starmer are still a better party than the US Dems. You lucked into actually having a multiparty system somehow and even the Tories aren't as bad as they could be. At least they have a pretty solid record on environmentalism, for some reason.
Aus
No, but our gun laws are 50x better than the US's and our democracies are still significantly better, especially in Aus where we actually do have some level of proportional representation.
We don't guarantee the right to gun ownership
Look at the UK?
Look at Australia?
Yes, which is why the goal of the left in the US should not be to get guns of its own, that's an insane stance. The goal of the left in the US should be to impose some form of gun legislation immediately and their long term goal should be to make a constitutional amendment nullifying the second amendment.
You're much less likely to get killed as part of a hate crime in a country with strong gun legislation than without
And all guns can do is create death and violence
Because violent revolution never leads to a state you want to live in. It's a terrible idea.
There's already states in the US which ban open carry and require a restrictive licence for concealed carry
It's not really much of a dilemma, many countries have solved this
The best way to deal with it is to make carrying any weapon illegal
which are actually far more dangerous than swords
The issue is that if blades are allowed people would conceal knives
That's why things like throwing stars are banned in other countries and you can't just carry a knife on the street
Any weapon that can be concealed is almost as problematic as a handgun
Do you think you can get a 6/3 conservative supreme court to agree with that?
There's precedent that limiting what arms people can own is OK however.
Right now, not happening
Look, I'm down to reinterpret the second amendment to allow everyone to own only a musket, but you've got to get a supreme court that agrees with that
You could probably get away with banning handguns and auto/semiauto weapons without doing so
A total ban in the US would require an amendment to the constitution or a really favourable supreme court to reinterpret the second amendment very heavily.
also, get a freaking shoulder strap
You realise there's two people here who have already said that handguns are banned in their countries but riffles are legal right?
In fact, they're more accurate which means you're more likely to get a clean shot, so I don't see why you'd ever really want a handgun in that situation
It's much less dangerous against people too
A riffle
You know what else can be used for wild animals?
I prefer my throwing wallet odds to my fighting back odds
if they can't even really perform their intended defensive use?
Isn't that like, a really good argument in favour of banning handguns?
Don't try to fight back
When I got self defence training the first thing they told me is that if you're mugged, just throw your wallet, empty your bag ect.
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
It's not worth it
I'd just throw my fucking wallet
Do you know what I'd do if I encountered a mugging?
I don't think ease of carry is a good thing?
Yep, handguns are completely illegal in all cases other than police use in Aus too
Why do you think I keep talking about those classes of weapons?
For a single homicide, the most effective gun is a handgun. For a mass homicide, it's an automatic weapon followed by a semiautomatic weapon
and high calibre weapons like sniper riffles too I guess
I've said what I'd ban, fully automatic weapons, semi automatic weapons and handguns
I'm just using the wording of the law that Clinton passed
It's about both. Handguns and fully automatic weapons are far more dangerous than something like a riffle.
It's one of those things that has to happen if anything's ever going to improve though
And the banning of assault weapons can be done. Clinton did it. The only issue with that law was that it was only effective for 10 years. Hopefully Biden surprises and pushes the same thing through but permanent.
work from there
Again, I didn't call for disarmament of the working class. I called for legislative change. Start by banning any automatic weapon and preferably handguns.
Talking about the US in terms of gun violence is only useful when you want an example of what gun anarchy causes. Every other OECD state at least does better. I pulled Switzerland because they're a good example of high gun ownership and moderate-high gun violence when you exclude the US.
Or do they just have more access to guns?
Do you think Switzerland, which has higher rates of gun violence than Aus just has a more violent culture?
There's a direct correlation between gun ownership and violence and it's really a matter of how much you're willing to tolerate.
and states like Japan and Korea have almost no gun violence
There is no state with lower gun violence where guns are more wide spread than Australia
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Turns out the government can totally afford to double welfare payments BTW
I too believe that starving people who can't work is violent, but thankfully I live in a welfare state where that's at least rarer. It's still a fucking issue (although ironically hasn't been for the last 8 months or so) but at least it's not complete capitalist chaos.
yeah, I'm already on board with that
I'd use a different word, which is unjust
authority
And by violence I mean inflicting harm upon someone. I have no problem with courts and sentences. Prisons need some work.
I never said that
The thing is, you're conflating what I said about not wanting violent revolution with never using any means of repression that isn't completely passive
https://discordapp.com/channels/336297387863703552/336297840529899522/776497074022776844

Kinda posted the way I'd think about that one already
My thinking is very much influenced by figures like Ghandi and Mandela. I really do fundamentally believe that either of those men accomplished more than any violent revolutionary ever did and with far less bloodshed. It's not like India and South Africa are ideal states, but in terms of where they progressed from they really did a lot. To me this is the ideal of how we should try to change things and I'm always worried when I see the left talk about using violence as a tool. I just fundamentally believe it's not a good tactic when there's any other option available.
I'm talking to Lectric
I feel like living in the US gives you a somewhat warped view of how violent other developed countries are
And I'd point out that ISIS are in fact the violent revolutionaries
OK, but we're not talking about Rojava, or at least I'm not
He wasn't as bad as Stalin, but he had huge issues too
Lenin wasn't a good leader either
It really wasn't good
Also, you don't want violent revolution anyway. What happened after the revolution in Russia?
They still happen, but they're far rarer
Police shootings are rarer in Australia than in the US as well
You realise there were more peasants than guns in Russia in the 1900s right? Why do you think there's a sickle on that flag?
You are much more at risk of being shot in the US than I am in Australia
and they do not change things
Guns do not keep you safe
It saves lives
It's not bad
Gun control
Australia has not had a school shooting since 1996
Mass shootings are very rare outside of the USA
That's 100% the wrong way to look at that
No
Hawaii for example in practice has outlawed carrying guns
which some states already do
Extending this law and just making a licence that's practically impossible to obtain is a possible workaround
Which is kinda backwards, but whatever
I've found it the only way to keep sane without believing in some greater good. Just the idea that there's no real meaning behind all the crap that happens in day to day life helps me get by.
I like absurdism because it's a very mouldable philosophy that many people react to in many different ways. For me the lack of greater meaning means that the only thing I can do in this world that's worth while is to try to find any way I can to improve it.
I've just leaned in to insanity <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
But it was still non-violent reform
Also Nevis, yes
Every government ever is a transitionary period between what comes before and after. What we can do is steer the direction. If we reward more progressive politics and start shifting in that direction then more polis will adopt those stances.
Lectric, what I'm going to say to you is that the societies on earth which are generally the fairest and best to live in have gotten there without violent revolution. Scandinavia for example has generally been one of the more peaceful places in Europe of recent history. All of the countries have got to where they are through reformism, not revolution. For god sake, Norway, Sweden and Denmark are still monarchies. But they have generally good representation, welfare and workers rights and are good places to live, all without the need for people to die pointlessly.
I got the point, I actually started thinking of what I was going to type before "life is painful" though
Like, in Jainism which I've done some study into reincarnation's an endless cycle of shit that you're meant to try to break and I think that's the point in a lot of Indian religions.
Also, you'd be surprised how many reincarnation religions have that as the point of reincarnation.
From the viewpoint of an atheist who's very interested in religions, hard disagree
You shouldn't not think that way honestly
So only for religions with reincarnation could it actually be a positive for you.
I'm trying to respect any religious beliefs here too, but the way I see it the existence of a heaven so dramatically warps all value of life and happiness that it'd make your sacrifice ultimately pointless.
And also, I'm going to make an argument from my point of view steeped in absurdism here. To you, your life literally is worth more than the happiness of the entire working class. The second you die all value on this Earth (assuming you don't follow an Indian religion at least) reduces to zero. What comes from or after your death should mean nothing to you. Even if you believe in an Abrahamic religion this is true.
In philosophy, "the Absurd" refers to the conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life, and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless or chaotic and irrational universe.
You also can't really force a meaning onto something just because it's happened. Things happen for no reason all the time. The universe is fundamentally absurd.
I don't think that's a good way to think though Lectric. Your life is worth more than a theoretical revolution that's probably impossible by violence and inevitable by non-violent means anyway.
<:Baka:573649152249036810>
Not you
That just makes me more confused as to why you'd think gun control isn't a good thing
Like, I'm quite happy that I don't live as a rural peasant farmer, but how do I know that's not how people in 500 years would view my life?
Fundamentally though, yes we still need advancement. Advancement in genetics and medicine are, I think completely self explanatory as to why we need them. I'd also argue that advancements in science and technology are too much of a net-good to be ignored.

I think we've basically managed to eradicate Covid at this point
They do
Yes
I really don't think Pence would do well with the modern Republican base
^
Trump wouldn't actually accept Pence as his successor I'm pretty sure. He's much more likely to pick someone personally close to him and ideologically close to him than politically close to him.
none of them would stand a chance against Trump in a primary. Or even just someone from Trump's admin running on the same shit
Why bother? Trump almost won in pretty much a worst case scenario year
But he won't
He should
Rich former Presidents don't go to jail
Trump's going to run again in 2024
But that feels really unlikely
Unless Biden runs again I guess?
I don't think that's up in the air at all
Either way she's going to run in 2024
I can't find it now, I swear I heard something to that end but maybe I'm wrong
She's his VP. He's said he doesn't plan on serving a full term. When the President steps down the VP takes power.
But the current default is that she replaces Biden if he steps down, which he's already said he will
And like, on the progressive side it doesn't have to be Turner, there's really a lot of people who could primary Harris and I think she'd be a lot less safe than Trump was
Of course not, but I doubt she'd have took the role and ran in 2020 if she wasn't planning on doing so
It really depends on how a Biden/Harris admin is, whether they fix things or if they're just useless and also when she takes over and how controversial that is. In a way it's really not OK to run for president if you don't plan on serving a term and I think there's a decent chance that Harris gets absolutely destroyed for it. If it goes down like I expect it would actually be fairly easy for a progressive to take her down.
*In the primary obviously
My 4 years out crapshoot is that of all people who may run against Harris Nina Turner might be the most likely
And I'd argue against "Big gay icecream" being viable at all. For anything. Fuck Bloomberg.
Not the two people who received over 80% of the vote between them <a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
No
For VP?
Three candidates for what?
She's kinda unpopular, she did run in 2020 after all and she failed spectacularly.
I don't think that Kamila Harris will just be given a clean primary in 2024, I think she'll have to fight for it just as hard as Biden did
Why don't Dems shout more about how much people have been getting fucked over? Do you really think people wouldn't respond to it? There's a lot of people who are angry with the system. The single largest voting alignment in the US is non-voters.
they're anything but reasonable
at least publically
Well, I'd say well mannered
Also, Dems being well reasoned is part of the problem
But he doesn't. He failed to bring back jobs, which is why Biden could get a wedge under him there and dislodge him even if it was close. Had Biden have focused on labour issues I don't think it would have been close.
If it's not the only thing they consider then you need to focus hard on anything else that can win them.
But he was more white supremacist than Obama was so he still won that base.
So I focus on labour because that's what swung the swing states.
Focusing on it's worthless because no Dem can ever win it.
I never denied Trump's white supremacist base. I argued they're not the reason he won. Romney also had that base. Trump still had that base in 2020.
The Dems are as guilty of Reaganomics BS as the Reps at this point. They also run on a policy platform of Neoliberalism, which is the extension of Reaganomics. By buying into that framework you're basically allowing the Reps to just say "we're better at running the economy" and by the framework they chose they are, they're much better at funnelling wealth to the rich and hiking the stock market.
Also Iski the reason you should assume they're labour voters and not white supremacists is because it leads you to a useful conclusion. There's policy changes that can be made to win labour. There are not reasonable policy changes that can be made to win white supremacists. So assuming the vote swung away because of labour is just a lot more useful if you're going to concede there's any mix of the two
I'm oversimplifying? Read your own argument
The year Dems bombed the rust belt was the year that the Republicans ran pro job creation and rebuilding and the Democrats ran on doing nothing
So what matters are the labour voters who swung the election to Trump by either swinging to him or refusing to vote for either candidate
Yes
It's not important because anyone who wanted white supremacy would have voted for Romney over Obama because Romney is closer to that position.
Also, if someone's legitimately voting for Trump because he's a racist then Dems probably can't win that voter. A white unionist who voted for him because they just really wanted factory jobs back is probably winnable. If all you do is focus on racism you're going to struggle to win them though
It really is, these states aren't racist as you think they are when you look at what has happened there in the past 4 or so electoral cycles. Obama comes in first term on a message of change. He sweeps the rust belt. 2012, Obama's been kinda shit for the rust belt for the last 4 years, but his opponent is Mitt Romney. Obama still wins the rust belt comfortably even if it's not a clean sweep. 2016, Hillary Clinton this time. She runs on a message of changing nothing. Her opponent is Trump. Trump at least promises to change everything. Trump sweeps the rust belt. In 2020 Trump is coming of the back of 4 years of not really helping anyone there. Biden wins back the rust belt in a moderate fashion. 

The rust belt is a labour area. Do you really, really think they don't care about labour issues and only vote on race? And I make these arguments because I think there's a huge failing of left wing parties in general to grasp the role that labour actually plays in elections. There's such an overcentralisation on race that it's often a self fulfilling prophecy. If all Dems ever do is talk about race and never labour what's the logical move for a blue collar worker who lost their job to make?
Which is why Obama lost heavily in those states
No. I just pay attention to what people say rather than assuming their motives for them like you are
It really is
There were very legitimate concerns that caused a lot of people in very important **labour** areas to prefer Trump to Hillary. To a lot of Trump voters he's just a hand grenade to be thrown at the establishment. Want to know how I know that and why your 'pure racism' theory doesn't check out? Trump won off the back of Obama voters in labour areas.

Talking about voters in Alabama is useless. Dems aren't ever winning there and racism is a major factor. When you look at areas like Pennsylvania, Indiana, Maine Second, all areas where Obama won, those are the areas where Trump's antiestablishment qualities put him over the edge because those are the areas where people have been really fucked by the status quo.
You know one of the reasons why the Dems always flounder is what you're doing right now? Not actually taking the concerns of voters seriously and just assuming their motives rather than listening to what they actually say. They say they're concerned about the establishment, they're probably concerned about the establishment.
It's just very important there
But I'm pretty sure anyone who gave Michigan a viable plan to rebuild the automotive industry there would win it rather easily regardless of any other policy.
I'm also completely aware of this shit, I live in Aus
And yes, that's why I think this would be most effective in Michigan Shemmy
I think you need to find the right way of phrasing it in each area. In Michigan and PA, which are probably the key states going forward you talk about reindustrialisation first and foremost.
Here's the thing though, Biden won Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin while talking about green policy. It's not that toxic and if you give people a way back into the economy with it, especially somewhere like Detroit I think they'd chance that.
OK, but you don't tell them they need to drive it, you just say "we'll use it to create X new manufacturing jobs and revive manufacturing"
Like, what if the Dems ran on a policy of reopening car manufacturing plants in Detroit to build new, government subsidised electric vehicles. I'm pretty sure that alone could win them Michigan comfortably for decades.
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
Which is why my take is to take up policy like green reindustrialisation in those states to at least have a chance to win back those voters rather than scream nazi
If it's "bring back factory jobs to Detroit" there's a chance
It's not useful because if someone's idea of good policy is "revive the KKK" we can't win them
The reason I'm not talking about white supremacy isn't because I don't think it exists. It's because I don't think it's at all useful.
That's pretty fucking bad
They lost 6-7 seats in the house in a year where they won the presidency
Is analysis deeper than just saying "half the country is literally Hitler" going too far?
And, consistent with that theory the Dems really did get hammered in Congress.
The largest election I think is due to postal voting being so heavily expanded. I don't think it fundamentally has very much to do with the candidates or parties. Even if it did though there's still the argument that for some people coming out and voting against specifically their Congress person who played politics with their lives was a driving factor, and for some of those people they'd have done it by voting red down the ballot.
What I'm trying to do is analyse why it didn't.
Shemmy I really think you're missing my point. Covid **should** have generated a giant swing several times bigger than what it did.
And I don't think that's it Iski, the Dems played politics with Covid a lot and it burned them. It just made them look not very trustworthy themselves.
Florida had more cases than any of those states and not swing due to it despite all predictions. Covid really didn't help the Dems as much as it should or could have.
Fair enough on that one
If Covid was a defining factor in the election the Dems would have at least been competitive in Florida. But they kinda found ways to lump themselves in with Trump as part of the problem. To be clear, it still helped them, just not as much as people predicted. Which is why I say it didn't really 'move the needle' much. It wasn't what secured them as many votes as people predicted.
Turnout was higher across the board, he still lost vote % which is what actually counts
I think it probably has a lot to do with Pelosi making the galaxy brain move and blocking stimulus personally
I don't understand why, but Trump didn't actually suffer noticeably larger losses in states where Covid was worse
As absurd as it is, Covid didn't actually move the needle very much at all

Then again, there's an old quote "Humans can only understand three percentages, 0%, 50% and 100%". So it's really not that surprising.
yeah, but the media reported it as basically a 50/50
By the way Lectric, one of the things I learned from my science degree was extreme scepticism of the media when it comes to science reporting, they're just really bad at it. In 2006 the LHC was going to destroy the world or some shit.
Remember that Ed Miliband lost for eating a sandwich wrong
They tend to jump to conclusions to fast and sensationalise.
Yeah, that's fair. Like, I'm hopeful it'll work but I also just understand how the media interacts with new science
I'd just say hold your horses and wait till the actual results are released
That number's based off of 94 infections total BTW
I really wish people wouldn't talk about a vaccine before one exists. The simple fact is, we still don't actually know when one will be made so really the only way to effectively deal with Covid is to act like there'll never be one.

Hey, his campaign was still less of a joke than the new VP's
He's very, very right
When he's right
Probably a pretty good person to look to when discussing automation
There are other ideas on how to do this though, like an automation tax. As much as I don't like a lot of his policy Yang does actually have a lot of decent ideas in this area specifically.
The same way other nations have, partial government ownership
Which is what I'd say is more likely
You've just got to hope they've had a change of heart and aren't just more horrible than you expected and basically trying to extort the government
very smoll
My rabbit was the exact opposite
Another point here is that those animals had covid, assuming it interacts with them in any way similar to us (which I'm not entirely sure if it would/wouldn't) they were already going to suffer and some of them were just going to die slowly and painfully.
Seems like Starmer has it easier than Corybn ever did

The idea of omnivory/herbivory/carnivory as distinct categories is more of a human thing than a nature thing. In reality they exist on a scale and being at one end or the other is rare. Even cows are known to occasionally eat small animals.

Doesn't really matter though. My seat's safe Libs and put up a poli who's been embroiled in corruption scandals all year
I think my bottom 3 in order were actually One Nation>Libs>PUP. I put ON up because as bad as they are I honestly find the Libs to be worse. Hanson occasionally has a pro-worker vote in her, for completely the wrong reasons but I don't think the Libs ever have.
As bad as One Nation is they didn't dump billions of "fuck you" money into the election
I put PUP last though out of principle
yes
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Actually harder to list the bottom of the list than the top
But like, my house choices were Labor, Libs, Greens, One Nation, Palmer and the Labour Dems. So yeah, Greens it is out of that list.
I voted Vic Socialists in the senate last election <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
The Greens here are like, the go to reform party
It's pretty common for Greens parties to be anti-nuclear though

"adopt" is used because no-one actually creates a philosophy from scratch. It doesn't necessarily mean taking any other person's ideology wholesale, it's just acknowledging that it's too complex to start from scratch and you realistically have to take your philosophy from somewhere else, even if you later end up modifying it or incorporating other philosophy.
To me the thing that's more important than trying to become like someone specific is to try to adopt and use an ethical philosophy.
Not really, it's maintaining the status quo. A government who comes into power on the promise of never changing anything is inherently not leveraging their power. They're taking a stance specifically against doing that. You might see it otherwise when you think they should act, but there has to be a choice where the government is opting against using power and that's never making amendments to the constitution.
I don't consider doing almost nothing actually leveraging your power
There's still big differences between Japan and other majority governments. Most countries don't have that near guarantee that as long as you don't completely fuck everything up you'll be indefinitely returned to power.

It creates a slightly different dynamic. In other countries majorities have to act to avoid losing ground to the minority, regardless of if you agree with those actions or not. In Japan the government wants to always move as slowly as possible since the status quo has proven so effective at maintaining their position in power pretty much since the end of WW2.
well, about 80 years
Most majority governments haven't lasted for 100 years with only 3 years not being the largest party in parliament and 5 years in the opposition.
So it's effectively a one party state, unless the climate changes there may as well be no opposition.
Not really, it just means that one party has so much power so as to make all others irrelevant.

The big issue here is that the Japanese Diet looks like this, so there's a large incentive for them to do minimal changes and try to piss off as few people as possible since as long as the ruling party in Japan doesn't lose any of their voters, with the traditionalist block being important they're almost guaranteed to be returned to power.
If I had to guess this is probably a legalistic problem, it's not something that's easy to change nor something that the government's bothered enough to put the effort in to change. I hope they do change it but my understanding of the current state of Japan and their politics is that the incentive isn't really very high for them to do so.
I mean, the Vatican is a politically independent city state which maintains its own sovereignty, as absurd as that is. 

I went and googled the actually treaty for this, it's pretty unambiguous.

 "Italy recognizes the sovereignty of the Holy See in international matters as an inherent attribute in conformity with its traditions and the requirements of its mission to the world."

http://www.uniset.ca/nold/lateran.htm
technically its own country
He's in the Vatican <:heh:496448769185808435>
I had to actually look that up, excluding city states and small island countries it's East Timor, Paraguay, Andorra, Croatia, Poland, Portugal, Equatorial Gunnie, the Philippines, Mexico, Ireland, Lithuania, Ecuador then Italy.

I only looked this up because I figured Ireland was probably more Catholic.
and it's also not something they'll lose over
It's a popular reform, I just think it's unlikely to happen based on the government in power
no, they're not leveraging power
Yes, they're making a choice
They're making a choice to not leverage their power
Castle doctrine exists to allow excessive force to be used under certain circumstances.
There's already laws for that
Retreat with them, it's safer
And when those people chose to stay but could have left and that results in loss of life they should be tried for murder
The problem with both is that it makes it legal to stay and harm or kill someone when you could leave/run and not. In any case the laws increase the total amount of damage and risk in a situation by encouraging people not to retreat.
No, they're pretty absurd anywhere
That's why context still matters
Also, I'm aware of the differences but people still try to abuse that shit
It's a pretty simple symbol to design

It still is. It's commonly used as a Buddhist/Jane symbol I believe.
I really disagree with that take. There's similar cultural issues in the UK and Aus but no-where near the same gun violence problems. The problem is fundamentally political.
You have that backwards 0th Law. If you want to ban any one type of gun it's pistols/hand guns. Riffles are far less dangerous.
I wonder if gun control does anything <:YuzuPonder:430875283860750347>
It's time we retrain the populous in the use of longbows
Death by homicide correlates quite strongly with gun ownership, attempts at homicide don't.
It has far less of both
No
Very directly
It does
There's a reason why most countries don't let you legally carry a gun
That's one of the big issues I see with the US. The culture is so insular that people don't even seem to consider that huge problems faced by the country have already been solved by most of the rest of the world.
Here's the issue I already have with this video. He talks about "gun control that works". We have that. Other countries have already solved this problem.
we have modern materials now <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Just telescope it
I wasn't saying you were, but to some extent his argument rests on the idea that gun control hasn't worked in other countries. Using statistics to disprove that makes his arguments pretty weak. 

What I'm saying is that the video is fairly flawed because he's ignoring wider reality to make his points. Saying "guns aren't the problem, culture is" isn't really supported by the statistics he tries to use to back it up. The actual statistics are pretty clear. Guns are the problem.
That's the main reason why the laws aren't as effective there as in the UK/Aus/NZ
Canada has an issue with people illegally bringing guns over the border from the US
He makes some decent points, but some of his information is blatantly wrong. Homicide in the US is actually just higher than homicide in most other countries. Just using the the other "settler colony" countries that are the most similar to the US the US has a homicide rate of 49.6/mil. Canada 17.6/mil The UK 12/mil. Aus 8.9/mil. NZ 7/mil.

His point kinda gets destroyed by actual statistics. Other nations just have lower homicide rates.

That's what happens when you have two corporatist parties. That doesn't have anything at all to do with the public, it's just that most dems and almost all reps are anti union
There's obviously huge issues with the decline in unionisation, but the idea that they've been smeared as something that's negative just isn't true

There are no representatives in proportional representation, that's the point

I just prefer true proportional representation honestly

The Queen still has a lot of theoretical power. Trust me, I know. It's been used against Australia, where she holds very similar powers in the past.

She delegates by tradition, at any time she could stop doing so and famously has intervened in Australian and Canadian politics already. Expecting the Queen to always remain neutral (whatever that even means) is slightly unlikely IMO.
The UK's executive is the Queen
Also
Assuming you have a system where the PM is in charge and not a President, which you want for other very good reasons at least
Yes, and that's the major problem with representative democracy, people almost always just vote for whoever's at the top of the ticket and don't really think about their rep

It reads as if the author has never actually worked with children. There really are levels of thinking that are at least partially governed by age. To act like a 6 year old is ever going to be capable of political thought is absurd. No-one has the maturity at that age to comprehend the world. His example is also completely unhelpful because it relies on imagining what this would be like for someone of high levels of mental maturity.

Like, if you want to talk about whether we don't give enough freedoms to teens, whether we should be treating our children as more mature actors or whether we need to better understand differences in rates of development all of those would be fine, but what he's done is taking the absurd position here. He's just ignoring developmental science.
So, I've seen one example of a machine with some level of self repair ability at least according to the paper that was written on it. It's still very much not useful and at lab-test level though.

By putting frog (I think) heart cells and skin cells together in a certain way a scientist was able to make a basic machine that would move forward, but one of the properties that this machine took from its living building blocks was a limited self repair ability.

I'd say the reason why there's less presence of blacks in motorsports would be due to the higher buy-in cost compared to something like basketball and the historical imbalance of wealth making it less easy for them to get the initial practice at younger ages compared to typically wealthier white people.

Every school I've ever taught at has a civics course which teaches taxes. This is a bit of BS that gets thrown around and accepted because people don't pay attention at school. In  my experience the people who say that just fucked around in their classes and there's enough people who didn't care about school, most of whom learned nothing at school parroting the same bullshit to make it seem like a fact.

If the Dems actually ran on policy they'd do a lot better on average. The issue is that most Dems as much as the Reps ignore policy completely. Way too many on both sides are more interested in making money than anything else.
You realise how much of Scotlands problem is London right? There's a Tori government that frequently passes laws that damage devolution of powers to Scotland and Wales. The SNP can't do things because the Toris have an effective veto.

And again, none of what you said really matters. Scotland has to chose between the UK and EU. There are more benefits to being in the EU. England's damned them into a bad position either way, independence is just the least bad option.

Also, deficits are much less important than you make them out to be in general. They're a part of the economy that the Toris use to fuck with Scotland. They force Scotland to spend on garbage that benefits England. That stops the second they leave. It's not as bad as it looks. But also, the Toris are playing up the importance of this due to their whole "independence bad" angle.
So did you just ignore literally everything I just wrote?
Plus, if Scotland were in the EU and out of the UK they'd raise more tax revenue anyway due to the EU actually enforcing tax avoidance laws <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Uhhh, Scotland's taxes are actually somewhat higher than England's already and it's not unlikely that they'd raise them on leaving the UK anyway. 

The idea Scotland would suffer from leaving the UK is absurd. The UK's about to blow itself up completely. Detaching yourself from England right now is probably a good idea.

But all capitalism has the same inherent and destructive goal. The creation and concentration of wealth. Social democracy slows this down, it doesn't stop it. Look at what's happening in northern Europe. They're becoming more and more neoliberal as the Scandinavian model fades. This is due to the instability of social democracy. Interests eventually start to erode the laws that kept them down and start to chip away at social democracy. And of course they'll succeed over time, the capitalist system ensures that they have the most power.
That is a capitalist system
But so is democratic socialism, the system you talk about
It's a pretty capitalist thing
A free market can only exist under capitalism and other related systems like market socialism.
I disagree, don't buy into capitalist bullshit. The right says one thing and does another. Monopoly and collusion are as much a part of capitalism as companies are. The right argues for some idea of "ideal" capitalism that doesn't and can't exist to assure themselves that the system isn't broken. The reality is, capitalism is about the concentration of power as much as wealth. As power concentrates upwards any regulation that hurts those with power is removed. Any form of democratic socialism in a capitalist system is unstable. As time goes on it will be eroded and eventually removed due to increasing power of capitalists. This is why your solution, and democratic socialism as a whole fundamentally do not work.
Actually stopping collusion is impossible
So, here's the reason why a free market for healthcare doesn't actually work. A free market allows collusion, which is something that currently happens in the US system. When companies do this it drives prices up to the maximum people are willing to pay for a product. There isn't a maximum price people will pay for lifesaving medicine, it holds infinite value to someone who needs it. So as long as there's a lack of regulation healthcare companies will collude, drive prices upwards and people will keep paying because what is their other option? The only way to fix this is with more regulation, reducing the regulation will only make it worse.

Because for me it's been over two years since I can remember one in anime
Also, when was the last time you saw anything close to a gay pairing in a show that wasn't explicitly yuri, yaoi, CGDCT or a Bishi show
The point I'd make rady is that the bar for acceptance amongst the community for a gay couple is generally far higher than the bar for a straight couple. Deku/Uraraka would be a good example of this, where nothing's really happened to suggest they should be a generally accepted couple but they are. There's a higher burden of what needs to be shown for a gay couple generally, a show that falls short of being Citrus or something will always have a substantial percentage of the community saying "they're not gay though" unless it's incredibly niche.

Yeah, the bigger issue here is that you can't really argue Disney was taking the stance I was talking about when they just caved to China

I was just about to say that I disagree with giving the dead rights, there's just no logic to it for me
Not every condition is, but in cases where they are the transplant should be considered of higher value than pretty much anything else
The value of grieving is still lower than the value of saving a life.
The thing is, I do understand that perspective, I just disagree with it. Once someone's dead you can't continue to value their body the same as you would a living person's. If their organs can be use to save a living person to me it's unjustifiable not to.

Yeah, I don't disagree with what you're saying either, it's just for me personally I view the act of merchandising and advertising as inherently manipulative. I'm not as concerned about what's being made because the whole process as it stands is a problem.

I've also always been biased towards looking at things more in terms of systems and broader trends rather than a specific action or object. Most of the time there's a problematic system promoting problematic items or actions. In this case these items are only produced due to profits with a very similar advertiser (in this case the anime) and merchandise relationship. The items that are being made are more problematic, the group targeted less, none of that changes the fact that the actual problem is the system promoting both. 

This is where my original point of "there's not a fundamental difference between Precure and magical girl anime aimed at men" comes from. They're fundamentally exploitative in the same way. And this applies to most media, not just anime. Anime has a particular problem of often just being an elaborate ad, but it's still somehow not as bad as the worst examples like Starwars.
Yeah, that makes a lot more sense now

You just named the majority of the countries in east Asia
Like, the majority of the return cases in my country are from the US
And it would have been handled far, far better if the US didn't give up and export cases everywhere
East Asia handled the pandemic very well overall
In east Asia, go look at the numbers from east Asia, they're generally low as fuck
But like, even in Japan which is one of the worse hit countries in east Asia I'm pretty sure that a sub 90% efficacy vaccine would still be effective
Like, there's other examples of countries like that amongst their neighbours we know are doing fine <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Than Vietnam?
There's no reason to assume they're in a worse state than their regional neighbours who had a less drastic response than they did. They're likely doing better.
To be fair, with how low the infection rate is in China sub 90% efficacy might actually be enough to basically eradicate it there.
There's a big difference between rats and bats however. Rats are one of the most interacted with mammals which makes back infection far more likely. Also, the issue is that a general purpose vaccine is something that's never existed before and the feasibility is somewhat questionable still.
It also potentially gives the virus a place to stay and mutate to the point where it can pass a vaccine and reinfect at a later date, and given enough time that's probably going to happen if it can sustain in the rat population
And there's no evidence of that last step yet, but the fact that it can infect rats makes it much more of a risk
It's still bad news, if it can go human>rat>human it's a very dangerous potential path for the virus. Plus, there's also diseases that have hung around forever and not followed that pathway. Specifically, often those with animal reservoirs.
So it's not unheard of
I mean, about 5-10% of colds are corona virus already
That's terrifying
Well

Viral acquisition is a large part random chance. There's factors that can increase or decrease it yes, but realistically this could have still started anywhere. And the whole "wet market bat" thing is just a kinda bad take, NGL.
Also, agreed with Mel and Armis if that wasn't clear
The real answer is we don't know. Because we don't really know the asymptomatic rate of Covid perfectly. We also don't know 100% what the conditions around testing in the US is or when the vaccine rollout will actually start to have an effect.
OK, here's the thing. That number you quoted includes asymptomatic. The almost 7% is confirmed positive cases. How many untested asymptomatic cases or even symptomatic untested cases do you think there are in the US?
The US is getting towards 7% confirmed positive. So actually, kinda yes.
Yes, but that doesn't matter because I was talking about the 2009 swine flu pandemic
We know approximately one thing about the Spanish flu's origin and that's that it wasn't Spain
I was right the first time <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
Swine flu was the 2009 pandemic originating in north America
That's the Spanish Flu
That's not Swine flu
Uhhhhh
That just drives up the odds that a bad interaction will happen
And statistically the most likely country in the world for a virus to arise in is China, because they have a population of over a billion
Literally doesn't matter
The country of origin
And like, here's the thinfg
I can't find any reputable source saying that the rise of swine flu was outside of north America. Saying the US definitively was wrong, but the agreed consensus is either the USA or Mexico
Reminder that the worst outbreak since the Spanish flu before Covid was transferred from pigs to humans in the US.
To bring it back to the original point though, my take is that the west, namely Europe and the US are the ones most at fault for this. We're the ones with the resources to actually control this and at least not export the virus to poorer countries so they have a chance (this isn't the only thing we needed to do, but it's one of them). With the exceptions of Australia and NZ the west widely failed at this. The east, being the other relatively wealthy area on earth did far better than we did enmass and actually has helped to reduce the exportation of the virus.

You can say what you want about China, but it's pretty abundantly clear that they haven't contributed to the spread of the virus in the same way the west has.
Yeah, that's worse than I expected
I've not looked into it but I'm guessing Java and maybe another couple of islands are struggling and everywhere else is fine. I'd be surprised if it's not that.
And saying Indonesia's their own thing is somewhat of a mistake, they're their own things
Like, maybe it makes more sense to speak of the "east Asian cultural sphere" where you have countries historically influenced by China and to a lesser extent Japan. Indonesia for example isn't really part of that. They've historically always kind of been their own thing. Mainland SEA however is very much culturally influenced by China.
Even then, there's a clear mainland/island split and the mainland countries that are generally more similar to China are the ones doing better
People often add Vietnam and Singapore due to cultural similarities too, although Vietnam is also part of South East Asia
Yeah, not really
Of which Japan is actually doing the worst of any country that publishes results
BTW, this is the actual geographical region called east Asia
Even if they're very bad at allocating them
At least the US theoretically does
India probably is having a harder time than the US at this point, they don't have the resources to test or deal with it at all
I mean, nursing is an important and generally underappreciated profession, yes. They're under-payed almost everywhere on earth. But like, why would you need to or want to harm teachers, another generally underappreciated and important profession in order to do so? The logic here doesn't check out. Especially when you could target an actual leach and an over-payed profession like, say, bankers and take more benefits from them via higher marginal tax-rates if you want more benefits for nurses. Or you could just give less to corporations.
I've been to some shitty schools, it wasn't ever the teachers' fault. I've met some teachers who weren't good. But the vast majority are in the job because they want to try to improve kids lives. God knows they're not in it for the shitty paycheck.
You shouldn't hate teachers
You'd have to vaccinate several elderly people to get the effects from one vaccine for an aged care worker, so in terms of rationing it's not.
I'm not saying what Poland's doing is right, I'm just saying that the most efficient way to vaccinate isn't the elderly first.
"Aged care worker" is kinda one of the optimal groups to vaccinate
Probably, it's a sane way to go about vaccinations
It's far more efficient to vaccinate people who they interact with like their carers and families where possible.
Kat, vaccinating the elderly is questionably useful anyway. They're far less likely to form a strong enough immune response to actually fight the virus.
even things you don't really want to close
close things
That's what you have to do in a pandemic
but teachers do face the highest immediate risk from schools which is why that does make some sense
Which is why they should just close schools
Yeah, obviously
They should be closed if there's an outbreak though
Yeah, teachers are a high risk group if schools are open
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
They should stop that too
Yeah, anti Chinese rhetoric has always been strong and I've personally noticed it be worse here since the start of the pandemic
He can talk for hours and say nothing
Also, if you want to torture yourself listen to Morison speak.
and the fact he does that on purpose
It's the hair
Oh god, he's almost as bad as Trump
Pretty much, but at any given time there are still people who are there because they want to do something decent before they're driven out or corrupted.
~~most of them probably quit pretty quick though~~
I feel like Donald Trump's stance on Mexican's is pretty close to mine on cops though, I still feel like the force is overwhelmingly corrupt and that the organisation is pretty much beyond salvage, but I assume some are good people.
Absolutely corruption does trickle down, I'm not arguing against that.
The top has the most power and ability to fix it though
But like, that's literally what I'm saying, corruption issues are solved from the top down unfortunately. That's the only realistic way. So why are you blaming teachers as a group when the issue is actually those above them allowing a few bad teachers to persist. It's why I'm also not all in on the ACAB thing, it's close to the truth but the real, biggest issue is those with power over cops, the judges who refuse to convict and those higher up in the force who tolerate this shit.
And the solution to that is to make teachers do more for less rather than to like, fix the corruption <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Like, I can buy corruption in the system in Poland, but that's the teacher's fault at large? Or the teacher's union's fault? Really?
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Yeah, I'm pretty unsure of this whole thing honestly too
By definition a union won't help with a corruption issue. The whole problem with a corruption issue is that the only ones who can help are those in a higher position. If those in a higher position are also corrupt, well, fuck.
The issue is most likely that the school fails to report and that the government isn't performing checks they should be. But if a school where to report "hey, this teacher's pretty shit" it's likely that something would happen.
What he's doing is already against the law
Like, you just said it yourself
OK, from what I'm hearing this is a school level issue first and foremost
Yeah, at least in Aus the average unpayed hours for teachers are the highest of any profession

Like, even now what's the benefit in impeaching Trump for a Rep senator? They just make themselves the enemies of his base. These aren't people who care about doing what's right, they just want to protect their positions.
Also, yes they literally could do it in an afternoon, I just don't see it happening
If the Dems were smarter they would have just never gave the impeachment over to the senate and just held "we've impeached Trump (don't look at the details)" over his head. Because assuming that would have passed was uhhhhh, kinda just dumb as hell.
I really doubt that
But yeah, the actual impeachment process is pointless because the senate is never going to vote 67%
pretty much, thing is, there's so many lawsuits against the guy just waiting for him to lose his immunity, removing him and just handballing him off to state courts isn't a terrible option.
Just not removed from the role
Trump has been impeached
Well, it's a removal process
In short, I doubt it'll happen
The way they're trying to impeach right now is through the 25th amendment, which would be quick or even instant, but require the backing of Pence

far more than Qanon could ever dream of honestly
The hawks have already done so much damage to the world
Personally I'd take the later
I don't agree with Jordan's reasoning, but I hope he successes, because getting rid of Cheney from leadership would actually be a huge positive.
Remember this is the woman who spent most of the last 4 years doing things like criticising Trump for not escalating hostilities with North Korea, for example. She's a toxic force even to other Republicans, because most of them at least don't actively try to start wars with as many countries as they think they can get away with.
Even for a Republican she's particularly bad on this stuff
The less power held by people like her the better.
Because she's been a major part of the US war machine, she's one of the most outspoken supporters Israel's aggression against Palestine and she's a major opponent of even the most basic of environmental reform.
In all fairness though, Liz Cheney deserves to be removed from any position of power
but I'm just not super optimistic about the long term outcome
They should pass this law and test them
and don't get me wrong here
Yeah, which might be a viable implementation, but like, I could still see the court saying no to this one
The issue is they'd have to craft the law so that they could still go in even if it's revealed they have a weapon potentially. The search itself should be fine, it's that you can't boot them out for either having a weapon or refusing the search.
It's unfortunate, but I could actually see that being the sort of thing the court would agree with
Their argument honestly might carry weight there
Does she like, expect that to get anywhere though?
The right to not die at another's hands needs to be prioritised over certain pointless freedoms
As much as it might look like a joke, the US really needs to start to understand that attitude.
I'm honestly just expecting the senate vote to be mostly if not entirely down party lines though <:sigh:230149462880813056>
Dems need to be looking at other options honestly, because their odds of getting 17 senate Republicans to vote with them on this are basically 0. They need to take action that can be completed with a simple senate majority.
I don't think they're likely to get 17 still
You expect them to use them?
At least 4 are being used to store their golden toilets
Yes, but can she say the n-word on national television. Because that's what she actually means <:LuL:789259461470322728>
And Ardania, I'm not downplaying the risks posed by Trump's wing. I'm just pointing out that Cheney is actually worse.
She has no moral problems installing dictators anywhere else
Cheney is as much a fascist as Trump, she just wishes her faction was the one that had the most power.
Some of them succeeded.
Bush's Whitehouse started coups every Tuesday.
Trump destabilised the US, how many countries did Bush destabilise?

Honestly, I don't really trust either, but having two untrustworthy parties doesn't balance things out
And I don't trust the tech giants to fairly regulate
On the other hand, if social media is taken down then it can't be abused in this way by either side
Honestly, I'd just be down for a complete ban of all political parties and polis accounts on social media in the run up to an election
Sites
well
Yeah, Uganda just straight up banned the site because they're worried about interference in the run up to their election, it's a smaller country but it shows how others are thinking about this now
Looks like other countries governments are starting to crack down on Twitter and Facebook because they don't want to let an American corporation have as much power as they do
The implosion of both major political parties would not be a bad thing and if the Reps do implode it's something the left should push for IMO
There's definitely figures on the left of the Dems who aren't happy with the party and if the argument of "you have to stay together to beat the other party" becomes invalid it'd be interesting to see what happens.
If the Republican party blows itself up there's honestly a decent chance that the Dems might do the same
I mean, if Trump keeps on going on like a two year old there's a pretty decent chance the Dems will win seats in two years
Some do though. And coup is too strong of a word because it suggests some form of coordination. There was none of that there.

That's not left wing. Big tech is right leaning as with all corporations and the democratic party at large due to their stances on economic issues. Left/right is economic terminology.

Then again, I think AOC is pretty useless as a politician anyway
I completely disagree with her point of view there
I personally prefer the term regressive
A better word to describe "ancaps" is laze fair capitalists
Anarchy the political ideology is left wing
The left meaning socialists, social democrats, anarchists and communists.
This is why you have a lot of people who say things like "Joe Biden isn't actually left wing"
The centre and the centre right tend to use it as such because it serves their ends. The left tends to use the traditional definition of left/right politics more.
I completely disagree. Using the term to refer to corporate entities like Twitter completely devalues it to the point of worthlessness.
What I meant is that the terminology refers to economics
I'ma go with yes
I'd have to see the actual campaign, but I wouldn't be surprised
Pink as in the gay community. It's the idea of corporations using gay imagery and giving tepid support to gay rights in order to expand their market share but in reality not really caring about gay rights. They'll post on social media about gay rights while operating in countries with abhorrent records for example.
The use of the axis socially is an attempt to lump in socially progressive pink capitalism with actual left wing movements and it's been harmful to many left wing goals.
It's better not to use the axis socially honestly
Pretty standard unfortunately

Newspapers and clickbait headlines
I hope they keep that line up
This is honestly the problem with the film. So many people who haven't watched it making comments about what they've heard. You can search the film and see what the convo was last time, but long story short I completely disagree with your point of view and it has a huge issue with enabling the anti-intilectual/anti-critic crowd who were one of the large pushers of the "controversy".
I didn't blame the makers of FPS games, I blamed the culture of violence. You can't just blame the person shooting in the US either. To do so ignores that this shit doesn't happen in other countries.
I'm just talking to points that were made later
Yeah, I find that view to be worrying and problematic too.
I don't always think it makes sense to look at this on the level of an individual, especially when you're talking about a genre and not a single work however
And in extension the violence of many of the societies that chose to make that media
Yeah, going back to the violent shooters example, the fact that so many exist and so many people enjoy them says a lot about the normalisation of violence and militarism within media. You can't just ignore that point.
I think the line of "it's a story so it's fine" is much to simplistic
Having more guns than people is a side effect of legislative issues. It's far, far to easy to get one in the US.
Yeah, I'd agree with that. Although the defunding of mental health services isn't fucking helping
I'm not sure I can agree with that in whole Allison, because this really is mostly a US problem. It's not like this happens at anywhere near the frequency in other countries with fairly similar cultures and often also fairly regressive views and similar societal problems. This to me is nearly a purely legislative problem, the laws in the US are just really bad and could have honestly been designed by someone looking to encourage shooters.
It's also in part caused by the long history of normalisation of violence within political discourse within the US and the lack of any regulatory action to stem it. But that's not really the point, the point was that even an action directly committed by one person, or by extension what one person likes or dislikes can be affected by wide cultural trends.
Yeah, that is an interesting theory
If you're not exposed to the SRY protein you will develop as a female
No, that's literally how development works
True, but I tend to believe that both genetics and environment play a role in most things
If I had to guess a biochemical/genetic reasoning though it likely has something to do with female being the default gender and male being a biological alteration on that. I'm not completely sure that it would be entirely equal in an open society because of that fact. I'd be interested to see more studies on this, but there's just so few overall.
yeah, that's more or less what I'm talking about.
Yeah, I was looking at papers, not areas
There are higher rates of mtf than ftm but probably not 2x
Some of this is just statistics being weird though. The studies that show very high ratios of mtf:ftm from what I can read often have issues with selection bias.

Yeah, but my point's more that he could have spent a week with his thumb up his arse and still been more popular than Trump right now, what's actually going to determine his long term success is going to depend a lot on what happens with stimulus checks, what happens with health care and what happens with workplace relations/the minimum wage. And none of this is stuff he's willing to change by executive order even though given how absurd that power is in US politics he probably could.
Buy yeah, the anti-Trump surge won't last forever
Wait and see what he actually does over the next few weeks
Other than some fairly decent exc. orders
He hasn't done much of anything yet
As an example, wolves certainly have a set of norms that a pack would follow that are fairly comparable to human ethics, they're rules and breaking them is seen by the pack as wrong. I don't think they reasoned their way to them.
I'd counter that with the fact that some form of simple ethical system is quite common amongst mammals even if it doesn't exactly match up with human ethics. An aversion to killing others of ones own species, while not uniform does exist amongst many species of mammals (an is very strong amongst primates) even in many cases where abstract reasoning is weaker than in humans as an example. There's definitely at least behavioural norms that any social creature follows, which can appear to be an ethical code.
Evolution interacts with psychology and group living as much as it does with biology. Certain societal traits are also selected for and there is feedback between these traits and genetics, because there is also a genetic component to behaviour.
My point wasn't really to anthropomorphise evolution there, more to point out that ethics is a system that arose due to evolution. You and your children are more likely to survive if you live in a group that believes killing is wrong, as a basic example.
<:heh:789431887135113241>
Biology invented ethics
Biology's not amazing because of its elegance, but because if its ability to plug a meter wide hole in the side of a ship with three stick and a roll of duct tape
Good old cordyceps
What can happen is that a promoter that's normally meant to be inactivated when not in the presence of SRY is mutated and just activates anyway.
The rules are still there, it's just that genetics is pretty complex
It can happen
Also, there's the opposite thing where SRY decides it wants to attach itself to an X chromosome and you get an XX male.
I've not heard of epigenetics causing it before though
Yeah, I know that XY female can happen because the SRY gene is non-functional or removed
<:heh:789431887135113241>
When the Y chromosome has literally one job and can't even do it right
Sorry, it's been a good length of time since I did any of this
Yeah, you're right
Yep, which is later in development normally
Early male development is directly SRY
Testosterone is the cause of male puberty.
It's also not testosterone that cases early male development. It's the gene coded for by the SRY protein which typically rests on the Y chromosome. Females can produce testosterone, under normal circumstances they cannot produce SRY protein.
Females are the default because in the absence of a very specific protein coded for on the Y chromosome (normally) humans continue down that development path without the male development cascade
But what you posted doesn't disprove what I said by the way. The default human doesn't have webbed fingers, but finger webbing still forms during the development of humans.
Yeah, I agree with that
Robinhood is just acting to protect those with the actual power

<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
One law for me, another for thee
Personally I just use the term "evolution" to refer to the change in a system over time. Natural selection is the method which causes the changes and both genetics and societal structure are systems by which the changes can permeate.
There is a non-genetic aspect of social evolution too. It also just so happens to inform genetic evolution as well. What I originally said was that there's feedback between genetics and behaviour. An example of this could be selection against extreme aggression in social animals.
I think reasoning has almost definitely changed, complexioned and refined our morals, but I'm fairly certain we've had them or something similar to them for a very long time.

I kinda missed the boat on this one but I just wanted to add that I can't stand these revenge fantasy anime that seem to keep popping up all over the place
I'ma agree with Lectic on this one, the real big problem with GS is its antisemetic undertones and origin, the problem with Redo is its constant justification for rape.
You can't fully separate a work from its artist, of course an artist's views are ingrained in their work. A bad person can make good works, but a person with bad views is far more likely to infuse them into a problematic work than one without.

Functional government isn't a measure of if you like what's being passed, it's a measure of if the government can actually pass legislation and govern.
To be fair, even in the legislature Britain is closer to representative. At least in the UK districts are approximately the same size. The house of Lords and US Senate are both shitstains, but at least the Lords doesn't hold nearly as much power.

Finally, the UK isn't good for your point anyway because they have in recent history had a function coalition government that passed legislation. I don't think the Tori/Lib Dem government was good, but it was more functional than recent US governments at least.
At least in Britain it's far harder to win with a smaller percentage of the vote. The system has huge issues with forcing majorities to exist where there aren't any, but that's still a smaller issue than some of the electoral collage BS that happens reguarly.
I think you are very wrong
Because their electoral system is almost as bad as the US's
More parties who have 0 power in the case of the UK
The UK is also not proportionally representative
It's really not a good comparison here
One party controls a majority in the house in the UK
I really disagree with this. The amount of bullshit and inaction in the US congress isn't seen in most countries on earth. Somehow Germany manages to pass bills despite no party controlling a majority.
They hold the large parties accountable
Coalitions are a good thing
I just know the banks were being cunts
There may have been, IDK very much about the stockmarket side of things
So you know, same shit they're still doing
08' was broadly caused by banks giving homeloans at absurd rates to people who had no chance of paying them back and foreclosing at far too high of a rate
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Well yeah, they're basically going to continue racking up debt until the shares go down below like $20 or something
In practice you can get more money by selling strategically
In theory yes
Also, I wish US elections didn't impact Australia directly, but like, have you seen the state of our country right now? The neoliberalisation of America paved the way for the exact same thing to happen here. Australia follows pretty much every trend the US sets. That's before talking about the wars and Whitlam, which are more examples of direct US interference in Aus politics.
And I really do not see him pulling that off
I mean, I think the only time a party in power has gained in congress of recent times was 2002, so Biden would need something special not to lose his razor thin majority in 2022
Given his current form he could fuck that up for them
Assuming the Reps can muzzle Trump for 5 minutes
Well
Personally I view that as inevitable
Like, I'm not saying oppose him on every issue, but when he inevitably comes forward with a shitty Obamacare 2.0 bill that fixes zero of the problems of the original bill the left should oppose that.
I don't see how pushing is any different to opposing
Maybe sans Beazley who was actually kinda decent
Also on the Aus politics angle I'd say the same thing about any of the leaders of either political party from the last 20 or so years
It's important because you and I both know that Biden won't do anything about it, at all. The US under Biden will continue to have the worst healthcare in the world, and this isn't a small issue. The main thing I'm saying is pretty much that the left needs to continue to push Biden on issues, in order to do that though you need to see Biden for what he is. He's not a victory or an ally, he's a continuation of the Obama/Clinton sort of Democrat who are more than happy to continue selling out the country and not doing very much of value.

Also, I don't think I've ever seen anyone miss the point of an image so utterly. That image is a point on consumerism. It's an argument against the "but you're posting on a phone" BS. I am literally suggesting that people should democratically participate to oppose powerful figures who I do not believe have their best interests in mind. I'd say the same shit about Trump, Obama, Bush or Clinton too, because none of them were good.
I wonder why
I notice you left healthcare off that list despite it being the largest cause of bankruptcy in the US
Yes, there's a very similar situation here with the neoliberalisation of Labor and one of the worst leaders in party history currently leading the party here
I think you missed to point I'm making here. The left can't treat Biden as a win, we need to continue to organise, yes, but one of the people we should be organising against is also Biden. We need to treat him as an enemy as well, because he opposes much of left wing policy.
But that's still a loss, the left needs to understand that
The fact that a centre right poli won the democratic primary shows that the left has a lot of work left to do. This isn't a minor difference of policy, Biden's healthcare plan is not acceptable, he's too accepting of war and much, much to favourable to the rich. The fact that a cuntrag like him won the primary is a huge loss for the left, because he's not part of it.
Biden winning was not a left wing victory
I very much disagree with that sentiment, but even if it was true there's currently two right wing parties in most countries
you can believe what you want about the old messaging, but it's clear as day that the current messaging isn't working
It's enfeebled and useless
Where's the left got itself in this century?
It's that the vast majority just don't care enough
It's not that they couldn't understand the theory if they wanted to
It's not condescending to understand that the majority of people aren't politically engaged and complex messaging has no chance in hell of reaching them.
The growing complexity of left wing politics does it no favours. Left wing politics fundamentally worked from the 30's to the 70's due to its overall simplicity of message. I think one of the largest reasons why left wing politics struggles so much today is the desire to make everything so damn complex when it really doesn't have to be.

Most people aren't willing to pay attention to complex political theory, that's just a fact. They'd prefer not to think about politics in general and the idea of complicating your message will just lose these people, and there's not an insignificant number of them. It's one of the reasons why a lot of people who 40 years ago would have likely been union workers went for Trump, simple messages work.

A lot of the reason why Sanders was able to have any success was his simple messaging, $15 minimum wage, medicare for all ect. Not complexity, simple shit that everyone understands.

This is why I favour simple messaging. "You are working class and you are being exploited by the capital class" is a lot simpler and more understandable than trying to convey a more complex class structure. It's a message that has worked in past and can work again. It's not like it's an untrue message either, it's fundamentally what is happening.
Which is something you seem to be really good at
Stop doing what capital wants and starting dumbass infights for no good reason
Here's the issue with that, the "eat the rich" attitude is the reason why a lot of people who consider themselves middle class dissociate from the left wing of politics. White collar workers keep thinking the left wants to make their lives worse because of that bullshit. The left needs to come back to its base understanding that labour is being exploited, it really doesn't matter what you work, you are being exploited by capital. That's why I simplify, not because a doctor and a mother have the exact same circumstances, but because they are in the same position when it comes to who's exploiting them and who they'd benefit from uniting against.
A framework which understands that you have more in common with a doctor working for a wage than that doctor has with Jeff Bezos is better than one that uselessly subdivides workers and creates useless intraclass strife.
That's the point
Understand that none of those people you just described have any real wealth
Yes, because when you compare them to the capital class, they pretty much are
And to me someone who works for 200k a year is still working class unless they are able to quit their job and not work
I'd still include disabled people, pensioners ect. in working class assuming they don't have large investments.
Also, "upper class" and "high class" are complete BS phrasings that should never be used IMO
My personal point of view on this is that there's only two classes, working class and capital class. If you can live off of money/investments then you're capital class, if you need to work you're working class. The middle class is a myth perpetuated by the rich to divide the working class.
It's worked for state govs here, I don't think it's ever actually helped federal Labor win, mostly because they're normally busy fucking something else up
The thing that made me really understand that was Labor making the removal of negative gearing a key policy and no-one understanding what the hell that actually meant. Probably singlehandedly lost them the last election.
I've been saying very similar things to that here though Armis. The left needs to adopt simple, clear messaging for every policy and avoid complex political language. If we just come out and say things like "we want to raise the minimum wage" or "include dental in medicare" everyone understands it. The moment we start making things more complex we lose people who just don't care about politics.
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
all of which are better than yours
You have at least 40 models to learn from
Healthcare reform in the US is actually super easy
I'm inclined to agree with that, I think it's why Sanders was able to pick up so much steam in 2016. A min wage rise and healthcare reforms are simple, popular policy.
It's not that I want a monolithic left, just a left that bothers to organise itself moreso than what we have now. Because from what I've seen in Aus the left is always poorly organised and ill equipped every time they need to do much of anything.

This is actually one case where a less monolithic "left" would be preferable. If the social democrats in Labor were more willing to work with the socialists/social democrats in the Greens and less willing to work with the centre right in their own party that would actually be beneficial.
Like, the Left of Aus Labor is a pathetic affair
From what I've seen left wing politicians are fairly apt to move to the right of whatever party they're a part of
What I propose is that actual socialists and social democrats need to start working as a block and not giving as much ground to the centre. We don't need a new party or candidate, just more organisation and accountability
Well, yeah. I think the scarier thing is that several parties who's goals aren't capitalism have started to move in the same way because capitalism has become such an overwhelming force that parties no longer even bother to resist it.
Also, to be clear here the Tea Party are asshats and they're some of the worst polis in the US house. But they did what they wanted to. They pushed the Republican party even further right. To me before you throw the baby out with the bathwater it's at least worth trying these forms of more extreme reform for yourself. You may actually be able to frustrate the Dems into appeasing you after three or so house leaders.
Well, yeah, my argument here is that what the left needs is what the right has. Loose cannons who are willing to just go into parliament and tell everyone to fuck themselves and generally be a nuisance to power. If you can get together enough uncompromising ass-holes to be thorns in the side of the powerful for long enough they buckle. How many leaders did the Tea Party throw out? Why can't we have a socialist version of that exactly?
And it is exploitation, the left is never the side that wins out on that exchange
Even if that's their nature they can't do so while being exploited by centre right figures
There's also the fact that the left has a tendency to view the centre as allies which they don't have with the right, which is hugely problematic
I think it's harder for the left to overcome the centre at the moment than it is for them to overcome the right
That's not so much what I meant by "the biggest issue"
I'd say the centre
She'd say the right
And the thing I'd really disagree with Shemmy on is who the biggest issue is for the left
I'm not arguing that really, it's just a disclaimer to my point.
<:sigh:230149462880813056> 

You seem to be heavily misunderstanding why I'm saying what I'm saying. I'm not saying this because I want Biden to fail, I'd be very happy if he went out and passed more leftwing policy, but I'm pretty sure he's going to stop short of what actually needs to be done. I'm saying this because I want the left to be better. I want a situation where the left isn't enfeebled. But to get to that point there must be an understanding of why the left is where it is. Why centre right politicians continue to control the party despite the left wing candidates who have won holding the highest approval ratings in the party.

To get there though the left needs to start understanding politics better. We need to accept where we failed, understand why we failed and understand who opposes us. To be clear here, Biden isn't the worst democrat when it comes to opposing the left. He has some sympathies to the left when it comes to workers issues. People like Pelosi, Harris and Schumer, the rank corporatists are worse.

You seem to misunderstand me saying the left lost as some sort of a "fuck Biden" ideal. This isn't what I mean here. It's an introspective statement. The left lost because we weren't good enough. There were things that went wrong that shouldn't have. We need to be willing to analyse and understand what went wrong and change our strategies.

And yes, this whole theory relies on not considering liberals left wing. I do not consider liberals left wing. There's a whole lot of political theory that could back me up on that one.
They've still become increasingly neoliberal, so the point still stands
Yes, very similar to a labour party
The French Socialists are basically dead and the Greens keep threatening to knock out the SDP
It's also interesting to note that the SDP and French Socialist's rightwards movement hasn't done them any favours really
They actually have a socialist/communist party that wins a significant number of seats
Also, the SDP was literally never radical left nor is it the furthest left in the German house
Because people like Biden, Pelosi and Schumer act to block left wing policy just as much as people like Trump and Mcconnell even if they're not as bad on all issues. If everyone just sat down and accepted what Biden et al. wanted the left would be even more pathetic than it is now.
I don't really know much about Italian politics so I can't say, but I do know that parties like the SDP in Germany and Socialist party in France have become increasingly neoliberal over time
But there's still a trend towards neoliberalisation of left wing parties in nations with strong 3rd parties
Oh yeah, no question there, 3rd parties help
Also Cypher, this isn't just a US problem. The neoliberalisation of left wing parties is something that's happened globally
As I said, highly enfeebled and the person who's done the most to revive it was the one who adopted a strategy closer to what I'm saying.
and unions
The left in the US at this point is a few congress people and grass roots organisations
Under Clinton and Obama it was not
Under presidents like FDR and LBJ the party was left wing
Shemmy, this contradiction you think you see goes away when you understand that I view the Democrats as a party that has moved from the left wing in the mid 20th century to the centre right today
Including in the US
But yeah Armis, I also can't deny that if Australia just Swedened overnight it would be an absurd improvement to standards of living and that if that was obtainable it would be worth doing, so my position on this is a bit complex. I'm a democratic socialist who's somewhat willing to settle for social democracy if it's an option.
If capitalism wants to keep growing the fuckers will find a way even if it means destroying everything
I couldn't hear you over the sound of my ASTEROID MINING and SPACE HABITATS
And that's why I don't think social democracy is an end goal
The thing that eventually breaks social democracy isn't this. It's simple wealth accumulation. A social democracy still funnels wealth upwards, just more slowly. Eventually you reach a point where wealth and power is concentrated and the protections for workers start to break down.
It's just that implementation of social democracy is such an undeniable increase in standard of living that it can't be ignored
To be fair, I'm still a socialist, I ultimately think that the only way to ensure an equitable society is a transition to purely state and worker ran industry
The distribution is just an easier problem to fix and can have a huge immediate benefit to peoples lives
For me an initial focus on distribution is needed
It's just an interesting quirk of their economy that lends some credibility to MMT.
I'm not advocating for Japanese conditions
To be clear here, I'm personally more on the Keynesian side of economics, but MMT does seem to have some merit considering Japan's been effectively doing it for years now and had no notable inflation.
Either way they have more money to put towards programs like a pension
In several. There's the modern monetary theory interpretation or the Keynesian interpretation. Governments can reshape their economy by just printing more money. They can also do it by actually taxing Google or some shit.
Governments have the effective power to reshape the national economy, most just don't use it
And Noi, have you stopped to think that for someone on min wage, which is a lot of people a few extra dollars is a lot?
Gamestop was a $350 share price and such
We could always try telling it to cope, the economy's mostly bullshit anyway
Also, quite frankly I don't care that much what an individual cares about. Things like min wage, worker protection, climate policy, healthcare, infrastructure and education all poll very well and they're all areas where the left can easily excel, so we should probably focus on them.
You should care about climate change
you never shut up about your key policies
You can have other policies, but you talk less about them
Those are examples of good key policies to run into an election
I guess Adam Smith's writings maybe?
Considering they already basically paid to have themselves put lower down the food pyramid than research suggests they should be

so the usefulness of oil will drop over time but it should never become zero
If for nothing else we need it for sterile procedures
and like, to be clear here the world produces too much plastic, but we do need some at least
Pretty much, but you can actually use the oil that would normally be used to be burned as well
Oil has uses in things like plastics and the production of hydrocarbon chains for medicine too

I wish I could say something more to help but I think Loris has it covered
Ever heard of Libya?
What they're doing. The US has a major presence in many central African states with the stated goal of destroying Boko Haram, a terrorist group that pretty much destroyed itself. There's very unclear reasons now why the US is active central Africa, but they continue to be.
The US is only protecting their own interests, I view that as just as big of an issue as China.
Or the Middle East, or North and central Africa, or tried to do to SE Asia before being utterly embarrassed
Considering China has never removed an Australian leader from office
I think the US is a bigger threat
If they could fuck off that would be preferable
I don't want the US's "protection"
Ah yes, the great favour of massive destabilisation
If you want to sell drugs in Australia you do it at our prices, not yours
Yes, that's because they don't use bargaining power to set drug and treatment prices the same way as every other country on that list
Yeah, European countries tend to fund the schools decently
It's private spending that's absurd in the US
Note that the US government spends about the same p/p as any other developed government
I'm looking at it by GDP and it's still exceptionally high
I'd say this is the US's biggest issue
Also yes, you do need to raise teacher salary to do that generally.
And some of the countries with better education systems have solved this in a different way, by telling teachers lesson by lesson what they must teach. This is the more Asian approach. If you remove planning and massively simplify grading it turns out that can work too.
Speaking from an Australian teacher point of view though, this isn't actually the issue with schooling. The issue with schooling stems from a growing demand and shrinking pool of teachers. Average class sizes here in the public system have increased about 50% since the 70's. Classes are unmanageably large. Teachers are expected to do to much, but this isn't because of bureaucracy, it's because some idiots at the top decided that a teachers job is only the time spent in a classroom. 

The majority of overwork stems from the fact that teachers have to teach 80% of the time they're at school and have next to no time to grade or plan. A more centralised school system is actually helping somewhat here because it makes planning easier by telling teachers roughly what they have to teach. 

I firmly believe that what you're suggesting would actually make this worse Armis, because from my experience it's not the bureaucracy that's a problem. It's planning for an absurd number of classes and dealing with an absurd number of students. Removing the common framework teachers use would just make their jobs even harder and make it even harder for them to actually teach in class.

If you want to improve education you need to reduce class sizes and reduce the amount of classes each teacher takes. That means you need a lot more teachers.
Charters and independent schools inherently are less centralised than government schools
A centralised, all government system would be preferable
One of the biggest weaknesses of the US system is its decentralisation, the fact that it's a mess of independent, charter and government schools
The German school system is much more centralised than the US from what I've seen. The federal government sets up a pretty strict framework that schools have to follow, it's still a federalised education system
Or Germany
That's a really weak argument. It's like saying that the existence of the US has shown the inefficiency of a federation. You can't just take one example to prove your point, especially when there are examples to the contrary. As an example of this Cuba's education system is significantly more centralised than the US's with a tiny fraction of the resources and radically outperforms it, so we certainly can't attribute this just to centralisation.
To me the single biggest issue with schools is class size, from the teacher point of view it's basically impossible to actually work with 25-30 kids in any constructive way
The real worry here is that if this strain is resistant to our current vaccines then the act of vaccination is also inherently selecting for more resistance to our current vaccines. Basically the strain doesn't have to be highly resistant, if it's resistant enough to maintain a foothold then we've applied the pressure to select for even more resistance. This isn't an argument against vaccination, it's just a fear I have about how this could potentially play out from here.
Which is apparently 9pm now
It's past my old man bed time
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
Yeah, that's what I meant
It's still pretty worrying because from what I've heard this seems to be confirming an idea that the SA strain was already thought to be vaccine resistant
https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/07/south-africa-halts-rollout-of-astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-after-shot-falters-against-variant/
This is potentially pretty terrifying
Look, I think every nation should close all foreign military bases (mostly US) and send all soldiers back to their home countries, but the way the US acts in Germany and Africa are very different.
Because the US soldiers in Africa actually go out and shoot people, do you think the 35k in Germany are doing that?
In many of the countries in that link the US is only allowed to perform actions in designated bases and to perform actions anywhere else would be viewed as an act of war
There's a difference between active/standby Noi, central Africa is the US's second largest active zone.
The US overthrows a government in an orchestrated coup every other year and no-one can do a thing about it. The US's blatant disregard for national sovereignty of any nation other than themselves is a huge issue. Makes the US whining about election interference pretty hilarious though.

It's obviously not the main problem here but it's a good idea to fill up a water bottle, if you can find a 2L one that's perfect and just drink throughout the day, if you can get used to it it's a lot better for you

I already don't understand the Holy Trinity
at least that's my understanding, I think there's a few theological differences too but I'm too not Christian to understand them
The biggest difference between Orthodoxy and Catholicism is the location/identity of the pope. In Catholicism there's an inherent importance to the Vatican as the Holy See which means that the pope must reside there. In Orthodoxy the patriarch (very similar role) was defined as the Empire of Rome, later eastern Rome and even later Russia, before the role was secularised.
<:HomuLewd_MM:366003463777288193>
I don't agree mostly because of the fact that religion basically exists on the back of indoctrination of children who don't have the cognitive abilities to adequately consider what they're being told.
At least to my mind
The thing that's weird is being so assured of the truth that you'd actually believe you know better than others
He was released on a technicality, no-one including the court believes he's actually not guilty
He's still protecting Pell
Churches being untaxed is one issue, also the Catholic Church's big issue with protecting paedophiles is another.
Well, the other big issue is that governments give churches far too much free reign and churches use that to do some truly horrible things, but that could as much be argued to be a problem of current governments
I've always wondered if religion wasn't portrayed to kids as an objective fact and they were allowed to actually think about it more freely what the outcome would be
Yeah, that's my single biggest issue with organised religion personally
That's how it works right?
Pick Saint Patrick, then no-one can complain when you get pissed in church
Every Sikh I've ever met has been a fantastic person
I've always had somewhat of a fondness for Sikhism as far as organised religions go though
I completely disagree
It's not like a religious studies class will teach you every cultural practice of Hinduism, it'll teach you a few important ones and usually a lot of the history
To be fair, there's different levels of depth you can go into
But I've never heard of a school actually doing religious studies and not RE with younger students
Which is OK at higher year levels IMO
That's what religious studies is
Yeah, you know what my first suggestion here would be, to remove religious education from schools and ban the practice of religious schooling
There's already a case against Trump in the New York Appeals Court for tax crimes, so that's the thing he's most likely to actually go down for

But that's still absurdly high
Covid's probably around 70% for heard immunity
I'd make an argument that it's pretty disconnected from reality. Anyone who's done any amount of higher education at all from my understanding will have far more than 10k debt, and the majority of graduates do not secure good jobs out of their higher education in the modern world.

You know the filibuster can and has been overruled by a simple majority right?
Yes, it's a policy that's inherently antidemocratic that Democrats won't commit to removing because then they might have to do something
You just linked me a page that says despite Obama's super majority the best he could do was pass the ACA. Our Conservatives would love to pass that bill. It's a giant corporate handout, forcing people to buy into private healthcare. 

This is essentially what I mean. Joe Biden isn't going to do anything that pisses off his donors, just like Obama didn't. He made sure that his healthcare act left insurance companies absolutely fine, because many of them had paid him to do so. Biden will be very similar since almost all of his donations were corporate.
Did Obama not have a super majority in his first term yet still pass almost nothing?
The reason people like Joe Biden and Obama don't want to do anything is that they are paid off by corporations who want them elected to maintain the status quo.
I think it's much more likely that he's looking to follow Obama's legacy of doing very little and trying to look like he's doing something
Yes, which is the reason why nothing will happen.
have them pay back in a little
also this whole argument could be made redundant by just imposing an education levy on those over a certain wage to pay for it, most very rich people are university educated anyway
Where I think your argument and Biden's argument fail here Mel is that Biden is very unlikely to actually do anything to improve education, so that money isn't likely to do anything else.
Because further education quite clearly isn't a good pathway for everyone. I know plenty of people for whom it would have been terrible. Further education should be available for free for anyone who wants it. It's really not contradictory. I think that second point is understood by most people, some might challenge the first idea but I don't think I've ever talked to anyone who wasn't a university administrator who thought everyone should go to university.
Yes?

As for my opinion on this, I'd go a step further than what you're saying still
Add to that the pressure of the entire school system essentially telling students that going to University is basically correct
We do however have to talk about the fact that most 18 year olds are not actually old enough and does not have the world experience to make an informed decision. It's very easy to say "don't go into debt", but collage debt is usually the first debt that people take on before they fully understand what it means
I agree, but nationalising universities still doesn't solve the problem for those with debt
That's not at all an argument. The average university/collage graduate will be more educated than an average person who's not. An example or even multiple examples to the contrary do not disprove this.
A highly educated population holds societal value
Basically Hitler just saying he was the leader until everyone accepted he was the leader
>Prometheanism prioritizes human interests and needs over those of ecosystems (as with deep ecology) or the individual needs of creatures (as in eco-feminism).

Ignores that ecosystem maintenance is in the best interest of humans.
Even if I don't think it's a very good idea
I read it as suing the suicidal students, at least that makes sense
Oh
Just give your ideology a cool enough name and people will believe it for no good reason
What?
Uhhh
It was a real thing too
<:CagliostroPout:672861874471174166>
Bring back syndicalism though, the ideology name's fun to say and I'd vote for it
<a:Sleepy_Wave:586137175368663050>
Fair enough
Also, to be clear worker owned co-ops can be an example of a fairly communist organisation operating in a capitalist framework
To me the difference here would be that in a social democracy workers can have a say and a stake in the company, but a social democracy would still allow for ownership and other private stake holders. Even if the workers have absolute control over the company if they don't receive all the wealth generated by their labour then you can't consider it a socialist or communist society.
Probably profiting less off the labour of others though
If there's still some capitalist at the top profiting from labour of others then it's a social democracy
I'd say that's a left wing version of social democracy
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
as is the state
Oh, and because I feel a need to mention a cool abet slightly old ideology in a syndicalist society industry is owned by organised unions
I'd step back a tiny bit from that and talk about control of industry. In a socialist society industry is publicly owned by government bodies, in a communist society they're publicly owned by the collective or workforce. To me that's the big dividing line.
And the reason we asked you to define communism is because most people don't even know what communism is beyond "thing that is bad"
Noi, communism isn't simple enough to just be one thing or one idea. There's some kinds of communism I'm not a huge fan of, some of them are fine. I'd disagree with anarchists for example but I don't think they're at all evil, they have fine goals I just don't think the way they want to go about achieving them would work.

The potential damage posed by a nuclear plant is still higher than hydro, but there's far more hydro plants generating less power per plant than nuclear
It also generates power by combusting oncoming birds <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I know solar towers are a thing
yeah, I mean the main form of private solar, photovoltaic cells
I don't think I've ever heard of that idea before
Every other form of power generation I can think of involves turning a turbine
*other than solar they're all the same
just on a larger scale
The actual power generation system in a nuclear power plant should theoretically look quite similar to any other generator
Like, the entire situation's just fucked
On the other hand, I've heard of people desperate enough to just burn fence inside their house in Texas right now
I mean, I've lit ethanol on fire in a controlled lab setting before, as long as you know what you're doing it's fine. The key is to only have a very small amount of fuel, it burns itself out quickly then. 

What she's doing is kinda the exact opposite of this and it makes no sense anyway, because a bottle of concentrated spirits (the only thing I'd even consider using for heat in this way) contains the same total chemical energy regardless of how fast you burn it.
If it was ethanol then it could work if you know what you're doing, which she didn't seem to
Oh, also if she was burning isopropyl alcohol then that's a horrible idea.
If it's high alcohol concentration cleaning alcohol then it behaves more like pure alcohol
To be fair though, everything I just said depends on alcohol concentration, if you're burning like, 30% vodka or something who really knows what's in it
I'd also be worried about the inside of the tin can
So, the issue with burning stuff in a room with even moderate ventilation isn't CO2. People can actually deal with fairly high concentrations of CO2 before it's toxic and you don't produce that much from burning something that size. The issue is toxic micro particles in smoke. Paper doesn't burn cleanly. There's a lot of random elements in it that can reform into toxic compounds when it's burned. Alcohol on the other hand burns very cleanly into water and CO2. The main product from burning both paper and alcohol is CO2, it's just what else you produce that's the issue. The amount of oxygen produced by burning paper won't offset this.
Like, burning rubbing alcohol sounds bad, but it should actually be safer than most candles really. I'd be more concerned about the paper burning.
In theory alcohol should burn fairly clean
That's a pretty questionable idea, considering there's a reason why that dam failed and it could have something to do with the river. Rivers are not stagnant. They change over time and an increase in river flow can be the cause of dam failure. It's not quite as simple as "you can just reuse the river". It also ignores that a flooded dam can make building foundations impossible and wash away topsoil leaving farmland unusable.

Plus, in any case short of complete catastrophe you can probably rebuild a nuclear plant after a failure. If there was political will even in the case of Fukoshima it could likely be rebuilt within decades, the land is being reclaimed however. Fukoshima was also a particularly bad example of what can go wrong. It's about as bad as a case with "modern" reactors and no complete gross negligence is going to get.

Realistically a burst dam and a nuclear meltdown can both have very serious consequences for the land in the medium term. A reactor will be worse long term though, yes.
This is a strange argument to me. Yes, building another dam on the same river is possible, but it won't really help much in a dam failure anyway since dams are made to cope with high amounts of pressure from water buildup, not high amounts of impact force from a dam failing. If one dam fails the resulting water surge would just knock down or overflow another dam of similar size.

A national utilities company that sells resources is still a capitalist mode of distribution, it's just more in line with social democracy rather than outright insanity.
How is the buying and selling of a resource (in this case electricity) not related to capitalism?
That's pretty much all they need to do
There can be power imbalances in any relationship though, just age isn't the only factor, things like money play a huge role too.
A far better rule is just don't date kids <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> . I have no real problem with adults doing whatever the hell they want with each other
It's important to be miserable because you can't stand the thought of other people being happy in a way that differs from the norm
It's very similar in education, although to a lesser degree
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
A huge number of people would be willing to work in care and education if there was less stigma about working in care and education
Yep, care and education are going to be two big sectors where we'll likely just need more people
Then you consider how much productivity has increased over the last 50 years
with societal reorganisation we could have average work weeks a fraction of what they are now so people actually have time to work and raise children
We already have a society productive enough to support sectors that are not only worthless, but active parasites on society like finance.
Why?
Serious question
That is true
Even with lower productivity we used to actively limit ourselves to having only half of the population being productive anyway, so I'm pretty sure that we could manage now if the system was just more equitable.
You don't need more young people, you could use more automation. You'd have to do something about the whole "rich bastards stealing everything" issue though.
Soldiers and policemen are paid more because their job is to maintain the ruling class
You're being sarcastic but Iski is 100% right

Extremely long timeframes on death row are common in the US system

Australian politics are an absolute dumpsterfire right now
There is an assumption amongst a lot of people not on the left that left wing ideologies are a lot further left than they actually are
Considering some of what Noi's said here in the past I'm really not sure
By definition, no
The vast majority comes from lobbying and under the table deals
Politicians in the US generally only receive a fraction of their wealth in public pay
The prison lobby pays off politicians
Prison labour is 100% about creating an underclass of slaves that corporations can exploit without most in society feeling bad about it.
Also, the US's recidivism rate is amongst the worst in the world, so I don't buy that argument
You know, in Scandinavia re-socialisation is achieved by, get this, giving prisoners more freedoms and treating them like fucking human beings.
Even joke parties can't save those people
Now combine that with ranked choice
Also, I'd be remiss to not mention the media in Australia being a huge issue
RC voting is just a half fix
But we really need proportional representation too
Compulsory voting is shit

In Bowies case the record label might slap you down for it

I don't want to own a car personally
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I actually like walking about 1km
Government needs some reforms to start reflecting that reality
Also, my opinion here is that government shouldn't care about productivity of business, only the well-being of their people.
People drive short, walkable distances because they're fucking lazy
That misses the point Noi
but a government doesn't have to cut corners to make a profit, so they can actually design them decently
That should be obvious
And how people use them changes with the design of the scooter
But that's only because of the way governments choose to implement them.
Maybe if a government set up this system it would work a lot better
Have you considered that the problem here is that you're talking about this as a corporate initiative?
and it works really well
It's literally only ALDI that does that here
Not here Noi
It works pretty well
You get it back when you put it back
You put $2 in a trolley before you use it
Put $2 in something and people actually respect it more
This is why using the ALDI trolley method is a good idea
No, but the implementation of electric scooters reduces the need for a car even further. And there are still huge issues with congestion and car usage in London, so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Also, to be fair here, London's public transport is fairly good and Iski is talking about upgrading it further
Works pretty well in the Netherlands
I'm in favour of closing off most inner city roads to cars
I'm with you there
Things fucking falling appart
I do it with a 15 year old, $20 bag
What's actually gentrification is cities designed around driving in prohibitively expensive cars
And I don't agree that this is a sign of gentrification when riding is cheep or free
Here's the issue with that logic though, people already do things like shopping on bicycles and motorcycles where they can't bring back more than they can fit on their person. I've bought more than $50 of shopping on a bicycle before. So I really don't think this is the issue you're making it out to be. And fuck there's pretty simple solutions too. What if we like, added a basket to some scooters?
Not cyclists

The real problem is drivers
so that's pretty much BS
I go shopping on my bike all the time

The main issue here is that we even allow cars on inner city roads in the first place

I don't not have respect for Christianity, that more just falls to apathy for me
Not that I had any respect for the catholic church in the first place
"I don't hate you, my sky daddy just tells me you're to be condemned to eternal flames for the rest of your life, sucks to be you"
NZ's medical system could have taken a fair amount before collapsing, from what I've heard Vietnam needed levels to stay low to not overwhelm their system instantly
NZ could have handled some level of outbreak decently well
NZ's in a very different case
Vietnam at the start of the pandemic basically looked at their situation and realised that they could not afford to have a large outbreak
It's less poor country and more poor personally
For sure
That doesn't explain why some countries, for example the US, destabilised countries in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia ect. produce a lot of extremists while countries like New Zealand, Germany and Japan produce almost none. There is a religious and cultural context to this and the ability to use religion to justify beliefs is a huge part of it.
~~stop indoctrinating children~~
Although there's certainly also problematic religious practices
My problem is always on an institutional and personal level
Glad our state just ignored them
Yeah, they did the same thing here too
Most of the ground level people who voted for the nazis were quite poor
Most extremism isn't organised, even that that is is based more on accumulation of resources than actual money
Also, pretending like all the values of religion are still valuable is absurd. The vast majority are ancient, outdated and worthless in the modern world or so basic that a 5 year old has already had the ideas instilled in them.
I just want to tackle what would have happened with the specific examples you laid out here though. The jet plane would have existed. It's a simple extension of physics. Might have came a bit later, but there's literally no question that it would have happened. Space craft also would have existed. People have been launching rockets for thousands of years, really and again, it's a simple extension of physics. These were inevitable inventions.

The GPS and internet would have likely came to exist in some form, after all a lot of the advancement on them were post military. The GPS and internet that the military used would be almost useless to you. The simple fact is, a mapping service and interconnected network are just things with obvious uses. It's not like the internet was the first or only interconnected network of computers anyways.

As for nuclear power, a lot of what you're saying only makes sense in hindsight. A lot was not known about what would happen when an atom was split. Some physicists didn't think it was possible, some who did thought the reaction would be energy negative. People didn't know what radiation was or did. So would it have been studied? Yes. Because no-one had any clue how dangerous splitting the atom could be until we did it. The argument to safety is one of hindsight.
Whyso? A delay in technological advancement to me seems worth a reduction in war. Even if it wasn't you can't say what civilian inventions we lost to the world wars anyway.
There's plenty of times something was invented for a non-military use and later used in the military, an example being dynamite which was invented for construction uses. There's no reason to believe that no-one would have ever created these inventions that are also used for non-military cases without the military backing.
Hard disagree
the vast majority
like
Yes, but scientific advancements are not military
Yes, in short
most business actually won't fund research because it's viewed as too high risk, so they outsource to government then just try to snatch up the profits
In what world? Most scientific advancement comes from public funding of public industries like universities
If you're putting something on a plane it's probably not a defensive weapon
Exactly
change the direction it's aimed in
Unless you can like
I don't want more research into laser weapons quite frankly. Their other uses sure. But I want lasers kept the fuck away from the military.
at least
or because they're currently impractical
Legit, the world is a better place because laser weapons don't exist
And the vast majority of their inventions are things that would be better off not existing
Incredibly inefficiently.
But either way, you act as if there aren't things in non-military science that were long running, highly funded projects that were an absolute nightmare. The Human Genome Project would be a very good example of exactly where this happens.
Other countries like France are actually spending more on scientific enterprise than the USA right now anyway. This isn't just because there's no super power competing with the US, it's specifically because the US's spending is so military biased.
why do you think no-one would for a non-military space launch
even outside of military uses
Countries put absurd amounts of money into scientific projects all the time
I mean, if you don't look at projects like the LHC, Very Large Telescope, ISS or various space telescopes planned then sure
China was fucking around with the idea of fuel propelled rockets thousands of years ago
in fact
Countries were already fucking around with the idea of fuel propelled rockets pre WW2
Rocket science is simple physics, ironically enough
I think even decades is probably an overestimate
I really disagree it would have been a centuries long delay
I see you cut the part of the screenshot that shows their actual representation off
Honestly though, even Corbyn wasn't a really a socialist. He was just a particularly extreme social democrat. Not saying I didn't like the guy, he was the best leader in recent UK history.
<:Kiriclown:771581449077260288>
Try harder
Please
some "socialist" parties are just full on into privatisation.
Some of the more socdem parties might want to nationalise certain key industries
That's just a true statement, try looking up a 'socialist' party's policy and tell me where you find their policy around nationalisation of all industry.
There are no popular socialist parties in Europe. There are parties called the socialist party, but at best they are social democrats. Most of them are just welfare statists and still neoliberal.
It crushed them, the communist and syndicalist movements are still fucking dead and the socialist movement is still only showing the first, tiny signs of recovery
Considering the cold war was one of the biggest factors that crushed the socialist, communist and syndicalist movements in western Europe
It almost certainly would be less
Is it though?
but to actually be useful it needed a lot more genetic tools to be developed
It wasn't particularly cheap either
The human genome project isn't all of genetic engineering and was completely useless by itself
The same thing could be argued for genetic technology. We didn't have the techniques and chemicals or fine enough needles to do a lot of genetic manipulation when the human genome project started, but we developed all that stuff for the purposes of genetic manipulation.
The problem is if people start blowing up satellites in orbit.
If it's falling and not just going to hang around in orbit that's a different case
There's enough space junk to deal with already
I really hope humanity is never dumb enough to use anti satellite weaponry.
Also, science doesn't need to siphon of a percentage of funding dedicated to killing poor people in the Middle East, so that increases its efficency when spent on too.
Like I said before, military spending is probably the least efficient way to advance science, because of shit like this. Whenever something in science gets large spending there's an expectation that it will have very large returns.
Are generally low enough to not be an issue past the really obvious things that I don't think people would argue are bad ideas, IE walking away from literally anyone you don't know at night time.

Here's the thing, you take risks that could literally kill you every day, many of which are far higher than the odds of a random passerby committing a crime against you in any way, shape or form. If you want to make a statistical argument it really needs to be that you should be more careful around those you know, especially those who hold relative power over you. Given the state of the world at the moment, good luck.

I also just don't think this tweet's worth defending. It's not good. It's a pretty weak take to begin with. It reads like an actual parody of a Trump jr quote (three poisoned skittles) and it's written in a very aggressive and unneeded tone. If you want to actually convince people, this ain't it. It reads as a direct attack on men in general. The more nuanced take involving power and privilege being a key factor is just better and it's much more likely to actually convince someone rather than just making them hate you. Especially when the person who tweeted it is agreeing with comments like anyone who disagrees is an "incel".
I'd argue it's still misrepresenting the situation because of one, very important fact. Most rapes are committed by a trusted person and not a random stranger.
The guy replying to the tweet with the kink won though <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Yeah, I don't think this sort of shit is smart. If nothing else you end up turning people on the fringes off your movement.
Because I seem to remember that being a thing that happened
Did they not form a coalition with a certain German Socialist party that was to the left of them?
were they?
wait
What the cold war did was shift the overton window so rather than social democracy being the centre with liberalism being the centre right and socialism being the centre left social democracy became the left wing, liberalism became the centre and conservatism moved from the far right to the centre right.
The Portuguese Socialist party shifted their views from socialism to social democracy. This actually supports my point. Eastern Germany isn't applicable to this case.
You're making a lot of random points that fail to address what I said, which is that the cold war caused the collapse of the socialist, syndicalist and communist movements in western Europe. This isn't a controversial idea, it's pretty universally accepted. I don't why you're arguing against it.
That typo made Merkel seem a bit ambitious <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Last I checked the current leader of Eastern Germany is... Angela Merkel
It was not when that party was in power
Yes
Because I think you're ignoring the other half of what I said
Was eastern Germany part of western Europe at that point in history?
It's a long time process by which radicals on the right who favour laissez faire capitalism have attempted to change the definition of what ideas are without changing the perceived radicallity of those ideas. So now we have the highly radical socialism, whenever the government does anything and the completely normal capitalism where industry is free to do whatever the hell it wants with no restriction at all.
Names are always 100% correct
And certainly no party would ever call themselves something to do with socialism while at the same time rounding up and killing socialists
Anyway, no party in history has never used the word socialist in their title when they're actually something else
It's to do with the public ownership of all industry
It actually does
At one point the French socialist party were socialists
It's also due to historical context
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
When every single "socialist" party is at best social democratic
So why are you arguing that the movements weren't crushed
That's no a huge movement, is it
they win like 3% of seats
yes, the actual communist party exists
So yeah, they haven't vaccinated, because until now they literally haven't been able to get any vaccines
as an example
Like Papua New Guinea who've been fucked over by the west at every step of this process.
Many countries want vaccines and can't get them
Europe's vaccination rates are way higher than most of the developing world
Yeah, no Noi
I've kinda come around to the idea. There's no reason Australia should be taking any risks with vaccines when there's such low rates here anyway.
Trust me, a lot of people are calling for it to be suspended here right now
The US still has a lot of legal migrants from poorer Latin American countries too
<:fuck:789441962554032138>
The US would be an example where the average wealth of a migrant as well as job security are generally of a lower standard than an average citizen, which considering the dropping median wealth and shit job security in the US
Ehhh, it's common in many countries for the average migrant to be very poor
I'd wager that would be offset by how absurdly hard it is to migrate to Japan. You need to already have some wealth, a fair amount of education and a secure job which are some of the strongest factors that contribute towards crimes.
And if you control for both age and wealth they commit a fraction of the crime
Only if you don't control for age
The only people who see this shit and care are people who are against it
It doesn't matter if it is or isn't
In almost every country Noi
Like, I completely agree that we need cultural changes, the reason we can't get any is because half of the population think that the left are raving lunatics because, in no small part shit like this keeps getting promoted
My point was that the general rhetoric of the left is far too divisive on issues like this and the polarisation that's created is actually the main issue here
And normally these super popular tweets do
But the problem is that the tweet reads as if it's attacking being male
I'd argue that would be the tweet you see here, and not so much any attitude. It's utterly self defeating. Tweets like this getting blown up as they do contribute to people having a distaste for progressive viewpoints.
Like, the shit in this tweet is basically the reason why so many men hate feminism, and this is coming from the PoV of a man who considers himself a feminist, is completely disgusted by the current state of what I see in my country and really wants to see the key goals of the recent woman's march met. I just also understand how someone could look at this and think "fuck everything you stand for".
because he would have acted as a counterbalance to the Neoliberal forces in the EU at least somewhat.
And this is why Corybn would have been a very important leader within the EU had England have not went full potato mode
They don't have the power, but they set official EU policy that would encourage countries to do so
The mistake of the EU as with many orgs is the increasing focus on Neoliberalisation. About the time when they started encouraging companies to privatise industry including their train lines was the mistake. Not adding the Eastern block.
Also, it's not an "any percentage" problem. The lower the percentage then the more alarming the rate of bloodclots would be and the less impact taking AZ out of the equation would have. I haven't looked it up so I don't know but if it's low then it totally makes sense
*assuming no further outbreaks at least
If the vaccines even caused one death that's quite likely at current to be more than Covid
even the current doses
But in Aus I'd argue it actually does even make sense to stop all vaccines
That depends on a lot of factors. For example, what percentage of vaccines are AZ vaccines in Europe?
Like, this sort of mystification of vaccines probably isn't as dangerous as vaccine denialism, but it could still result in more death if side effects are ignored.
Yes
But like, on this point, this is still vaccine politicisation Kat. It's important to note that vaccines can have dangerous side effects and be willing to halt and wait for more results if they do rear their heads.
Ironic you say that when Astro was a backroom deal between the US, UK and EU in the first place <:heh:789431887135113241>
It's really not that simple. The medical system could be liable if they cause deaths while knowing there's a risk
Oh look, a capitalist doing something evil in pursuit of profit.
so they were probably not in cold storage
It's 41 doses
although to be fair
what if in?
If it is like, a couple of days window then I'm more understanding of it
Sure
I mean, if they can't then destroy them after it's been too long
Probably don't destroy the vaccines though?
But I'm personally a bit on edge about the AZ vaccine. I don't think this just came out of nowhere. If it turns out it has I'll be pissed, but caution is always for the best when it comes to new medication.
I've been saying that the EU needs reform for years, it's a fundamentally good idea but it has far too many clowns
The main issue for most countries is a supply issue
You can't ignore however Solo that just having the vaccines is the first step, and for 95% of all countries it's not been achievable.
but legally can't
Yep, India has the ability to produce vaccines for most of the developing world
2 shots Iski
Which both the UK and US did
~~it's almost like that's what happens when you monopolise creation through intellectual property laws~~
basically 0 net inflation
Also, Japan has been spending more than it takes in through taxes and running a deficit for 30ish years now
But it's an issue of politics, not the policy itself
Also yes Kat, that's the issue
Out of the top 50 earning here over 40 paid literally 0 in taxes
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
As if corps pay tax
UBI is better because it unbinds basic necessities from work, which allows people to more effectively look for work or choose to do other things like stay home and raise a family or pursue creative techniques.
Negative income tax is a bad call. It means that if there's no work people just get fucked.
And Universal Basic Income
They have in the past. You don't reach 100% employment because some people don't look for work but the high 90's is completely achievable.
The impact on workers can be mitigated through other government policy such as UBI and jobs guarantees
Yes, but I'd even argue that government is probably too friendly to small business
It's too open to corruption
They already have it, but I just don't think a government should be giving any money to corporations at all
if the bank won't take the risk why should the government?
tell them to go to a bank
Also, I'd say don't loan corps money
When the government gives corporations excessive grants and tax concessions
Corporate welfare is utter crap
Yeah, we just throw money at private airlines and then are shocked when they fail in a crisis
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
You get exactly the service you'd expect from having a foreign gov running your trains
For some reason the Singaporean gov is the main shareholder in ours
not decrease
I mean, I'm pretty sure a UBI would increase wages
You can save a fuckton of money doing that
Or just cut corporate welfare
Not to mention we could like, increase taxes on the rich, or just crack down on tax avoidance (evasion, if they were treated like poor people) in general.
pretty large scale
so like
It says there that more than 8mil applied
Uhh Noi, that's a different trial
It's also worth noting that Alaska has had something akin to a small UBI since the 70s
https://www.pri.org/stories/2020-06-16/canadian-universal-basic-income-experiment-has-been-life-changing-those
But they do better by doing that
And then they don't have 10% more customers anymore, they have all yours too
Yes, but there's an issue with that logic Cypher, which is that someone else can say "I have 10% more customers, so I can actually get away with charging a tiny amount less for the same thing"
and you'll lose out
someone else won't
And if you try
Cypher, you don't need to raise your prices, because you get more customers
Except, you can
That was their response to Covid
Noi, it's the entire population of Canada
No really, that's called welfare
That's welfare
That's not a UBI
Seems fine to me
Canada's had a UBI for the last year or so
It's been overwhelmingly successful
Yep
taxes are basically government destruction of money
the idea that taxes pay for anything is fundamentally not correct
by printing new money
Secondly, the government pays for everything in the same way
check facts on that one
may want to like
OK, firstly, why would businesses close down when poor people have more money to spend
It's also worth noting the impact per km is higher and the utility is lower compared to a street car
I don't agree with that logic. You could also arbitrarily include other things for being an incredibly small part of the pool as well.
I mean, I take issue with this but probably not in the way you think. Why are climate regulations not being applied to race cars in the same way they are to any other car? Environmental laws should apply to all race cars, regardless of what their original purpose was.
Yeah, go for it
If tomorrow every single country paid their debts back in full there'd be less money in the world because of it
Some of the debt is just going literally nowhere
They don't account for the entire debt though
Money's been pretty much BS for a good long while
Shouldn't someone be the recipient, logically?
Like, every country net owes money
Also, the fact that everyone owes someone something but no-one's owed anything should tell you there's already some fuckery happening behind the scenes anyways
and it really doesn't matter very much
The fact is almost every modern nation has huge amounts of debt
nearly 100 years ago
But that's like
OK
This also counts children too, who presumably wouldn't receive a full UBI. Personally I'd be in favour of UBI for any adult in the country, but being realistic it would likely only be for citizens which would also bring down the price
per year
Or like, the US already spends 1k/month/PP on its incredibly inefficient healthcare
And yeah, if the US dived up its military spending it would also be about $2000 per person already
I mean, when was the last time debt actually mattered to a rich country?
And that's the normal "a dollar in the 70's was worth about $3 now" inflation
it needs to be pegged to inflation
like any welfare
Which is why
Yes
because why the fuck wouldn't they?
Everyone leaves their jobs at the toilet cleaning factory for min wage
Yes, that's the point Noi
despite all threats
Also, high taxes have never really actually made the rich move
What does everyone else working there who also hates their job do?
What do you do?
gov comes along and pays you 1k
you hate your job
Let's say you work for 900
and shit jobs because the work is shit
but like, shit jobs would need to actually pay quite a bit more
Maybe certain passion based jobs would pay less
Because workers have the ability to turn down jobs without major consequences
Like, who's going to work McDonalds for less than they'd get now if they have a choice due to a decent safety net
I think companies would have to pay more to even get workers at all
because it basically gives workers the ability to say "I don't want to work as a slave at McDonalds, I'd rather pretend to be a turtle for a few days"
and the physical limits on batteries are much higher than on a fuel cell
I mean, what you just described is a problem of battery life
electric motors are already kinda insane for some things
yep
Sorry, as in an extended start
~~little known fact is that a lot of race cars already use electric starter motors because they generate more torque and accelerate quicker~~
At some point it's quite likely that electrics will start outperforming combustion engines anyway
True, but in the case of show cars we don't even have to consider that
I think if they exceed emissions limits they just shouldn't be allowed
That's not a particularly convincing argument since my solution to show cars would be the same as race cars
For regular people usage isn't calculated
That's still a pretty huge concession to make though, because I can't go out and say "I want a car that uses a full tank to move a km and that's fine because I'm only going to drive once a year"
~~other than Teio~~
We can still have Uma Musume, no-one gets hurt from that
but there's like 15 other reasons that one should be banned anyways
The only sport I can think of off the top of my head that may be worse environmentally is horse racing
especially considering basically every other sport manages to exist with a far smaller carbon footprint
I really don't see a problem with regulating racing just as harshly as street cars
with a few rule changes
Which is basically what Rugby (a somewhat safer abet still somewhat questionable) sport is
It would just have to play slower so players didn't split their skulls in two
Reminder that NFL would be safer without padding and hard helmets
Which that environmental law kinda pushes
Like, it'd be easier for poor people to get involved if there were more standard, unmodified car categories anyway
What a suprise
A conservative being incredibly corrupt
Because on the other important metrics motors are already generally better. They have more torque already along with a few other advantages such as individual wheel speed control which allows for tighter corners. That's the practical limit of an E-motor, probably not something which would be hit in cars but something that we could get closer too.

Really the single biggest issue right now is the battery, going hard and fast just uses too much power. If that wasn't there then electrics would already be in an interesting place, but as e-car motors get quicker on the high end they'll probably start to be faster in races than ICE cars anyways. At least assuming the battery issue is solved.
The best electric motors we can make hit 150000
The RPM of electric motors (not the theoretical RPM mind you) caps out at about 10x as fast as a F1 engine
In terms of RPM
But yeah, I'm pretty confident that we're going to see electric cars that just outright kick combustion engines asses within the next 50 or so years
F1 reaches 1/10th of fastest electric motors, Nascar reaches about 1/15th
F1 is definitely faster in terms of raw output
Nascar just take corners far faster
F1 is far faster in a straight line, which means they rev to higher RPM
I'm sure that's 100% legal
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Like, if someone solves the battery issue and just sticks centrifuge drums on their car they're probably going to win
Yeah, and nascar isn't at F1 speeds
1/10th of that would still be excessive
but like
It's probably more than you could realistically get into a car though
yeah
pistons physically cannot move fast enough
There is no combustion engine on earth that could pull that off
Not to that extreme
You've just got to solve the main, battery issue
I mean, in terms of RPM the best electric motors beat out nascar engines by quite a decent margin, they're just big and no-one's put in the effort to shrink them down. Considering centrifuges can spin at 150000 RPM I think there's potential for an electric motor to beat out a nascar engine at that too
That's kinda the first point I was making though, electric motors are still getting far better. Their theoretical power delivery is also insane. Electric cars just have higher limits in theory than combustion engines
Remember when we used to break those up

The fact that research papers are treated the way they are is absurd and they should never have been behind a paywall in the first place, so I don't really have a problem with that sort of site

A better comparison would be to the lockdowns that took place post WW1
You don't need a licence to buy knives because it's already illegal to carry a knife on the street

Yep, I have no clue either

Last I checked
I really doubt Corbyn would have ever done anything like this
It has a lot more to do with the fact that they're conservative
Evil bastards?
Because they're the Conservatives?
50 years ago most people with autism would just go undiagnosed their entire lives
They're not being born with them more, they're being diagnosed at higher rates.
Also Pug, it's malice. If it were just the failed response it could be incompetence, but follow the money. Governments are ensuring that large corps can profit off of this by ensuring that large amounts of money needed by the population flows to corps and doing things like shooting down an IP waiver that would have allowed any country to produce vaccines. So yeah, there's malice there.
because that didn't really impact them
They were actually completely happy to let people protest against lockdowns generally
The problem here is that the laws being proposed in the UK are just stripping the right to protest altogether and they're only being proposed now that protests have turned negative for the British Tories
and corruption, of course
The only thing behind outbreaks are poor government policy and management
Or like, honestly, the Spanish Flu which had a huge impact on Australia
I do find it funny that schools would prefer to teach about the Eureka Stockade, a completely irrelevant event in Australian history that ended in complete failure and changed nothing about the country at all rather than something like the labour movement, something which shaped one of the two major parties in the country and 70 years of policy at least.
so I started to form some basic understanding around then
Basically just because around about 2006ish was the first time I ever noticed politics
The 26/28th and 25th prime ministers of Australia respectively
Before I educated myself on it my knowledge of politics pretty much only went back to Rudd/very late Howard
I didn't even learn political history in school at all
The Spanish Flu should teach you a lesson
It's harder to paint a virus as an enemy combatant than in a war, so under the rug it's swept. Also, most countries handled the virus pretty poorly so they don't really want to talk about it.
<:ChrisHibikiHug:630262562361049121>
Can it be with a tuna?
It would be an absurd diplomatic situation

Oh look, rich and powerful people being scum
Prohabitionism on things that provide little to no benefit to society has historically been a positive, as an example, prohibition of guns has worked out quite well
No, it's literally throwing energy into a void in the name of capitalism, wasting amounts of energy that could run hundreds of homes to produce literally nothing should be a crime
The environmental impact of crypto is just completely unjustifiable
I think a ban on crypto is a good thing
We're on #wankgate now <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Christ, Aus politics has the best hashtags
That's true, it would be very hard to prosecute a foreign leader under domestic law
That really depends, regulated economies have been able to avoid inflation altogether historically by just setting the value of currency.
And a control economy could very easily eradicate at least local inflation
I mean, it kinda is. Inflation didn't really exist before capitalism
and people who are literally on those companies bank books
Have you ever stopped to think that maybe economic theory is written by companies with a vested interest in ratfucking the people?
Besides, we literally just had a situation where every government on earth printed money, like all of them and a lot of it and there was no increased inflation. Not no net inflation, individual countries did not experience inflation.
Because the simple fact is, if you invest more money into industry and worker comp you will output better results
Or one country to go rouge and just do it
It's an economic model
Yes, but this one isn't
I forgot about that one
Ah yes, the wonderful Japanese cultural ability to will inflation away
Japan has been printing money for the last 30 years with literally no issues at all
I must have missed the part where the Weimar was a modern nation
I'm inclined to agree with that too, but then again I'd argue that capitalism is fundamentally bad and encourages wealth disparity and poverty in general
There's no evidence that printing money has caused out of the ordinary inflation within any wealthy country of the last 50 or so years regardless of how much they've printed
That's true too, to think this is a solution you have to ignore the environmental impacts of green energy
Banks literally capitalist fuck money into existance
The important part is at about 3:30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8HOWh8HPTo
It literally does
They don't need to tax to do it
Countries can build more green energy
No, that's where you're wrong
Almost no countries use paper money now anyway
most don't
The best way to profit off healthcare is to exploit someone
Like, the thing here is that there's always a profit motive at play when a business does something and profits mix really badly with healthcare
The problem here is, 1. they probably do, 2. they're buying in because in some way they can profit from it, most likely by funnelling patients through their own services rather than competitors.
Also, I'd be very cautious of a hospital that's owned by pharmacists and clinics (especially if they're specialist clinics). There's a huge possibility for conflicts of interest and price gouging to arise there
and as another argument, should a poor area that can't raise money just be subjected to a shittier public service than a wealthier area that has more tax revenue?
The big issue with that however is that the federal gov still has more ability to raise funds and manage the healthcare system in general, yours is just kinda shit. If you have a good local gov in that can work out for you in this case, but what if you had the opposite with a shit local gov and a good federal gov? You need to consider what the abilities of these branches are and the fact of the matter is federal is just better at raising large amounts of money for things like healthcare, education and infrastructure.
Whatever you say Noi
*Looks at Flint Michigan*
Also, personally I don't like corporations having leverage over something that people need to survive, regardless of if it's "healthy competition" or not.
My answer to that is very simple. If it's something people need to survive it should be provided by a national or supernational government responsible for and accountable to the most people possible.
I don't really give a rats ass about monopolies in this case. I care about people being afforded the most basic rights at an affordable (preferably free) price. By setting the price the government stops corporations being able to hold the ability to survive at whatever price they see fit.
That's what mixed market means
Yes, a mix between planed and free market economy
No, it's sections of the economy that the government has decided to run as such however
and small sections of the economy are already planned. The government sets the price of healthcare, that's literally one of the best programs that exist in Australia. The government also sets the price of public housing, another program I am very in support of. So why wouldn't I want to see this expanded at least to other things that are fundamental human rights in general, food, water, power, housing more widely just to name a few.
To be fair here, rampant capitalism has affected my country adversely
Yes, I'm in favour of a planned economy
Command economies are where the government sets the price of everything
Also, to be fair when I talk about command economies that is not the gold standard
I just don't think it matters very much
I don't really think it's a good thing or a bad thing
But the point that I'm making is that none of that shit actually mattered to the average person. Regardless of gold standard or fiat people were generally better off in the time period under the gold standard than they are now.
If you were to pick a time in US history that's honestly one of the better ones
Howso, the time period between the end of WWII and the 70's is generally agreed to be a time of great prosperity and strong pro-worker conditions in the US
Just under an altered system
The US maintained the gold standard until 1971
Also Kat, the biggest factor that pulled countries out of the depression was wide scale government spending, nothing to do with currency
Actually, that's not quite fair, the implementation of Keynesian economics gave us about 50 years of stability
So we're going round again I guess
and we also learned nothing from the mortgage crisis
We literally learned nothing from the great depression
The exact same things that caused the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis
The great depression was caused by overextentions of the stockmarket and banking system
What?
Uhhhh
Also, to be fair countries historically have quite often just traded in goods
That too
well yeah
People investigating financial crimes who are often obstructed and removed from cases for no apparent reason?
Noi, governments don't do anything because the people who money launder/profit from money laundering are their doners
Art is what someone else considers art, arguing about what is and isn't art is completely pointless. The problem here is the money laundering, not what's being considered art. Tracing the money wouldn't be all that hard and if governments were interested in cracking down on money laundering they could do so quite easily.
Plenty of artists produce modern art because they like modern art, plenty of people legitimately enjoy modern art, myself included. It also misses the point that all fine art, including pretty much any art movement from history have been used for money laundering.
Yeah, I don't agree at all with that take
That's a poll BTW
At least no-one else is buying their shit either

I mean, it's pretty disgusting regardless of how they got in there, but the rat theory is just the worst
there hasn't been an investigation so you can't say for sure, but that's the explanation that makes sense
A rat was probably nesting somewhere in the process and all the shit there is just what the rat had in its nest
The theory is, a rat dragged them there
We really picked the shittiest dystopia possible didn't we?

Yeah, I think that tweet's trying to draw too close a parallel to two related but not identical things. There's a level of defence from all criticism in fandom, but that's not all that fandom is. To just discard the more positive/creative parts I personally find to be absurd.
If anyone actually bothered enforcing anti-monopolisation laws Amazon would have been broke up years ago
just in general
I stand by my sarcastic point though
Republicans just care about the constitution above all else

GVT are the worst thing in Aus politics
This is nothing new here
The ultimate irony of this is, this is the region in WA that voted the most strongly against DLS
It's pretty absurd
https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/wa/2021/guide/results-mpas/
You can see what happened if you scroll down this
This was all decided by parties, not voters
It's called group voting tickets, each party needs to fill one out of six quotas to gain a seat in the upper house, so they need to gain ~16% of the vote. The catch is, parties can decide where their vote goes if they don't fill a quota. Parties are excluded from the bottom up and the DLS party finished 5th last. They secured the preferences of everyone below them, jumping from 5th last to the middle of the table, then they gained the preferences of the majority of other parties below them inching them above the Nationals and Liberals and gaining their preferences to win a seat.
I literally can't imagine anything less democratic
Some Aus states have found a system even more absurd than the electoral collage. Someone was just elected to the upper house on 98 votes, 0.0067% of the total state vote.
If I'm a unionised, skilled worker I may not be particularly wealthy but I do have some amount of power that at least makes it harder for a company to exploit me as totally as an unemployed person they picked up for min wage.
Partially, it's also because the more extreme the power imbalance between a corp and the person they're exploiting is the more they can take without giving as much back
Also, there's varying degrees of exploitation and the more vulnerable someone is (elderly, unemployed, imprisoned) the more exploitable they are.
I'd argue not, but this is a case where I think it's very hard to argue in favour of the capitalist model for anyone who puts a few minutes of thought into it
One of those times where a profit motive will just lead to a company exploiting a vulnerable person.
Also, leaving care to a private business is a terrible idea IMO. The state of Australia's private aged care was one of the largest causes of our large covid wave because there was next to no spending on actual care and abysmal conditions.
I just question if dumping a person like that into the pure care of our mental health system is the best way to deal with them. Even in a situation where our mental health system was significantly better. It seems to me that a mix between a care/mental health approach would be better.
Then again, I'd also argue that a more communal approach to criminal reform in general is a good thing. The state of jails here is an utter joke.
Some countries have set up systems like that, I'd generally believe that it's a far better system than mandatory internment in our current healthcare system
Yes, but those cases are very rare and I even think the way we deal with them at the moment leans far too much on the punitive side
I really do find this to be a problematic point of view. Punishing someone for something they didn't understand is at a baseline wrong. The reason we stopped doing this is because there's more humane ways to deal with the issue. You don't need to lock someone away to stop them committing another crime, with the correct interventions to their regular life you can quite easily stop them. We just moved to a less extreme way of treating these people.
If you can destabilise a countries politics by reporting on the news that really says something.
I mean, being scared of that is pointless, they called freaking Biden a communist
I completely disagree with that PoV, I think the main reason things don't progress is because at a political level the left is far too weak and far too willing to bend over and give liberals exactly what they want. Look how bloody ineffective every left wing democrat is honestly. The Tea Party achieved a hell of a lot more with similar numbers because they were willing to fuck with leadership.
It's a weird case
And even as recently as 3 years ago they were lead by an actual liberal, so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
but the party does have a history that stems from liberalism
I'd argue they're mostly just conservatives at this point
There's a bit of variety there though. On average liberals are centre right, but you also have parties like the Canadian Liberals, who are centre and used to be more centre left. There's also the Australian Liberals who are hard right, although one could argue they're not actually liberals.
Matt, when you look at what the word "liberal" actually means that makes complete sense. Liberals are just as right wing on a lot of policy as conservatives, they just tend to be somewhat more progressive. That's why in every other country on earth liberals represent the centre to centre right.
It's just that he's literal human scum like most politicians

Every time I see this image I'm reminded of the absurdity that a Nobel Peace Prize was given to a man leading a country involved in at least seven interventions and several bombing campaigns
And also, one would have to get a job for that to be true anyway
Except it's not true. It's a nice theory but it doesn't hold water. Reagan wasn't elected off the back of the old demographic, he was elected by the young at the time.
That changed by his last election, but in his first couple his support between young/old wasn't even noticeably different
at the time
Howard had over 50% support amongst young people
False
Before you say it
Also, it's not about what people are taught Cypher, it's about experience. Young people know the system is shit for them because they've lived it
That, to me is generational change
I mean, there was a poll literally today here that showed that on a 2PP basis Labor's 64% to 36% amongst under 35s and 38%-62% amongst over 65s
change comes when they die and younger people with different ideologies come to replace their votes
People get stuck in rigid ideologies and refuse to change
I'd agree with that, but that's also why I think change is generational
Does that mean younger or older?
I think almost everyone thinks that they're more flexible in thought than they actually are
No, I'm not. I don't know if my mind could be changed, but I lean towards honestly, probably not.
I 100% believe this. There's no chance to actually change peoples minds once you're over about 35
All change is generational
Like, there's no doubt in my mind that a referendum in WA to leave the federation would pass RN, again.
Australia's entered a very strange state where nationalism seems to have shifted down to the state level more than federal and it's actually straining the federation
My rock is better than your rock because I was born here
yep
Nationalism is a pretty shit ideology
As a socialist I want to infringe on American values, mostly because they're shit and they're also rotting my country away <:LuL:789259461470322728>
I mean, it does have its roots in European ideology, but so does communism <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I also personally find it funny that of all the things this is the one that blows up this huge. It's like, you guys know there's still companies out there directly exploiting African populations right? If your goal is to use boycotts to help these groups maybe start with that.
Weirdly enough the Fatui point was actually one of the first things that came to my mind
what kind of course?
Yeah, it's shit here too
Peace is just incredibly on the nose about it
Pretty much honestly
I don't really have an issue with any of the other 4 Nobel categories at all. Literature feels weird and ill fit but it's fine. The one I take issue with is Peace because of how generally problematic it is just on a conceptual level and the hints of it being included as an attempt to clear Nobel's own name.
The peace prize is just the one I find problematic
It does and that was its original intention, but there's still something a little hypocritical about creating a highly effective weapon then going "right, didn't mean to do that, peace prize to clear my name time"
Remember that time the guy who invented dynamite created the Nobel peace prize?
It's also worth noting 2010 was a Labor win while 2019 was a Liberal win, so there's no bias of just "vote was higher for one party because it was a landslide".
I recon if I could go back to when Howard was running it'd be pretty much even
Definitely not in the 80/20 range
Labor/Greens barely edge out the Lib/Nats amongst the younger two age groups
Same country 9 years earlier
This is what I mean though, young people haven't always been this progressive
I just know that as long as there are old hyper-conservative voices what I vote for literally doesn't matter
At the time of that election I was in the 18-24 age group
I'm in the young generation
You're making a mistake here
And that's being really generous to conservatives by giving them the "other"
That's never happened
No
Like, 80% to 20% more progressive?
Also, just to the point I'm making, there has never before been a generation as progressive as either younger millennials or gen z. Just using data from the Aus election study because it's what I'm the most familiar with, this isn't normal.
stop inheriting literally everything
If they could like
Most boomers were in their teens or younger during the 60s. Only the absolute oldest of them were of age in the mid to late 60s.
Being more conservative means that on average you're wealthier and being wealthier means that on average you live longer
That's the actual correlation
Yes
The logical opposite is that if people become more conservative as they age they were more progressive when they were younger
Cypher's theory does
https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/how-groups-voted-1984
It's almost like the Boomers were never actually a progressive generation.
I wonder who keeps giving US made arms to terrorist organisations, any rouge states in the area?
All they did was leave the door open for change in the future if findings that contradict their current findings emerge
No really, they're quite confident in their findings at this point. The text above saying it was a possible link is from March the 25th
From their website
It was a quote
This evening our PM came out and stated that according to one of our top scientific bodies, it isn't
As early as this morning media here was saying AZ was completely safe
And the ATAGI gathered data from vaccinations world wide, including from the UK
What the hell are you talking about? The media's been pushing for the vaccine non-stop
The ATAGI has said "The AstraZeneca vaccine appears likely to be causally-linked with a risk of this newly recognised thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome." They're not mincing words, this is a thing. There's a reason it hasn't gone away.
It's not like Aus, the UK and most of Europe are saying they won't vaccinate anyway, they're just pulling away from using a vaccine with known issues in the cases in which those issues are most likely to arise. There's just a shift away from using AZ for young people to using Pfizer. It seems like a fairly standard reaction to a highly probable issue to me.
Also, the "more fuel" point is correct, the failure to act quickly on these vaccines will not help public confidence.
I've been seeing more certainty around this recently. Studies are reaching confidence levels close to what would be considered high enough that it would be considered significant. The only reason we're not there yet is because the clots are rare. There's very little argumentation in science that the AZ vaccine causes rare cases of blood clots. There's arguments in the media and the way this is presented, which is unsurprising. The media rarely does a good job reporting on science.
Iski, scientists studying this understand this. They're not dumb. Whatever objections you bring up they have already considered. They have ruled out alternative theories like the clots happening by chance and traced them correlatively to the AZ vaccine. Bringing up "what ifs" here isn't helpful.
This is a thing and it was damaging for media to have covered it the way they did
Which is why the Aus government has said AZ won't be available to people under 50 going forward, the UK has said it won't be for under 30s too I believe.
They're overwhelmingly in young people with pre-existing conditions
These clots aren't happening in all age groups
That's an untrue talking point, it ignores a few things, the first is that incidences of fatalities from the blood clots are on average higher when not treated than others and secondly the groups that these clots are happening in. When you control for young people with pre-existing conditions the rate at which clots occur shoots up the be concerning.
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
I mean, with the state of Covid in Aus it's the correct call, but why the hell did they just say "nothing to see here" when the EU first noticed the risk
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-04-08/covid-live-blog-coronavirus-latest-news/100054644
Not surprising, but our government continues to run around like a headless chicken reacting about two weeks late to everything and having literally no idea what the hell it's doing.
This is the issue with exponential growth, it's just a matter of time until the most virulent strain becomes the most common.
Especially if they approve it when there's a known issue. Probably better just to stay the course considering the US's vaccination rate is already actually quite good.
It's more that even if they allow it the odds of them getting any shipments soon are crazy low and there'd be a hit to public perception of vaccines in the US (which already isn't high enough) if they're also dragged into this.
Actually it hasn't even been given approval in the US yet, I'd be pretty surprised if it doesn't get blocked considering there's no shortage of other options that seem safer in the US.
And I'd imagine American media wouldn't talk about it since they're not really using AZ
They've been saying that every day non-stop
That was literally what happened
Like, I'm not joking when I said the news was still saying the vaccine was safe this morning
At least here the news has been hyperdismissive of the issues
Fair enough, it normally just funnels through SA to some militant org though
Preferably Saudi Arabia too
So yeah, no sleep will be lost over this one
I don't think I could tolerate being around them at all
Honestly though, most of the royal family seem like assholes, Philip and Andrew are no exceptions but they're also not the only ones
Challenge accepted
Yeah, if the police want PoC to comply with them they should start by not assaulting them all the time.
Bimodal I believe
Probably all just wear togas or something
There's some things that are purely cultural, I don't think there'd be any natural clothing preferences for example, but others are related to biology
At the same time though, a binary, as aluded to by non binary is much more extreme than a spectrum
It probably depends on the server. Some I've been on have mass bot spam on occasion. In that case the bot command to mass remove is quite useful.
The moral course of action would be for more countries to pull an India and outright ban this garbage
Rights are illegal, now work till you die
and it's not good enough just to blame online learning, it goes deeper than that
Probably not, I'd agree, but you need to be willing to talk about why the education system failed so radically during the crisis
They're related issues
There was always going to be a hit to education from this though, there's just been an utter failure to mitigate.
It is an issue because tests are the worst way to teach in general, but they become even worse and less effective when you are teaching remotely. Remote teaching can be done better than it has been done, but there's huge systemic issues and resource shortages that have prevented it.
It pisses me off too
You're welcome <:aquaThumbsUp:436693485945356289>
I'm going to argue there's another issue implicit here. The obsession in English speaking countries with tests and test results.
But I also don't see any way around closing schools
Yeah, it has been, probably could have been done better but it was always going to be an issue
That doesn't happen
NZ's gov got reelected with a majority in a proportional system
Not how it's worked out in reality <:LuL:789259461470322728>
but the way this is posed in the west is mostly bullshit. There's no choice between the economy/health, it's both or neither. The reluctance to lock down has really fucked up western economies
School is one of the things that has the biggest impact on the economy, just 10 years down the line
Then again, given the state of Australian media it's not that hard
There's definitely specific independent media that's significantly better than main stream journalism
This is why I have a strong preference for independent media
They're arguably less communist than most western nations are
This is why China is not remotely communist
The actual ideology of China is called state capitalism, it's a system by which the government essentially operates as a large corporation, often controlling smaller, on paper independent corporations under them. Key to this idea is that the county is fundamentally capitalist. They trade openly with other countries, use their own currency, place value on things like property and usually aren't the biggest fans of unions (the key building blocks of a communist nation).
China is state capitalist
Yes, it's simple propoganda
Last I checked the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea is neither democratic, a republic or for the people
How China describes themselves isn't that important, how they act and their ideology are
I mean, why though?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I'm not wrong though, they'd try it
It'd get vetoed by Poland and Hungary again?
When a corporation is killing people through pollution you need to charge the higherups with manslaugher IMO
I actually fundamentally disagree. Fines and taxes don't work
Corporations need some fucking terror directed at them
That'll make some businessmen stop
Or, we can make the options either cut your shit or go to jail
you can't fix it with more capitalism
Climate change is a capitalism problem
Not really, you have to regulate and beat companies into submission. The people aren't really the main polluters, there's 100 companies that account for 71% of climate change. Start by whipping them into shape.
The only thing that will make people with power do anything is if they feel a legitimate threat to their power
There's no excuse for either
Australia and the US have been the largest rouges when it comes to emissions for quite a while now
Also, you can say what you want but China actually hits their targets
They create 14% of pollution, but also have about 14% of the pop, that's not to say they don't need to reduce emissions, but the west has a lot more work to do
Yes, but they're also one of the biggest nations by number of people
I know for sure Aus and Canada
I think the US anyway
Poland has higher density than Aus, the US and Canada
Also
They're all exporters of fossil fuels
No, I'm not
Unless they've moved up since I last checked
The worst polluters per capita are Australia, the US, Saudi Arabia and Canada
I'm assuming fully automatic too
That's like, some of the most moderate gun reform I can imagine
unfortunately

This was where we were at 2 years ago
The idea that vertical scales have to start from zero is generally laughed at by statisticians
Vertical scale is fine in this case
This is why you don't need money from average people
Biden proves that
You don't
No
The average person is basically powerless
What do you think the average person should do? Voting is pretty much worthless in most countries. You quite often have two parties who are far too similar with neither actually being willing to take the needed steps. Protests are widely ignored and civilian CO2 production is tiny when compared to corporate so even steps like going off the grid using solar which are completely out of reach for most have negligible impact.
The common man has almost no impact
I really disagree
If the shareholder knew what was happening and chose not to withdraw they're complicit, I'd say do more than fine them
Every billionaire has stolen billions from their workers
They are
Also
but that is holding corps to the same standard as everyone else
What I'm arguing is the opposite though, corporate personship is BS, the people at the top need to be held responsible, not the corp
should be jail time
fuck that
pathetic fine
A corp steals 1 bil from their workers
You steal 1 bil and you're in jail for life
I just think we should start holding corps to the same standard as people
If I'm saying we should arrest corporate heads for the damage they do then I mean all of them
That's really not a gotcha
Sure, then arrest them too
Because that's what they're doing
And they're several times more lethal if they do have a gun
There's a pretty direct correlation between severity of gun regulation and number of shootings
I mean, not really
even in super regulated cases
I just think the damage they do generally outweighs any benefit to their legality in any form
To be fair, guns are more regulated pretty much everywhere other than the US
Shotguns are far too effective as crowd control weapons too
Pistols are more dangerous than rifles for the same reason a knife is more dangerous than a sword
Single shot, long barrel
rifles
if anything's to be legal
Pistols should be treated as the most dangerous weapons
When fewer people have one you're safer
You don't need a gun for self defence in general
Yeah, no
They exist as long as the sales aren't cracked down on
and FFS, get rid of gunshow loopholes
Ideally a repeal of concealed carry laws too
Yeah, it kinda has to happen
actually, I have no idea at all
feels that way
kinda missing the point IMO though, because the most dangerous guns are handguns
I want to fucking scream it in their faces
make less guns
You can just like
Well, yeah, that's true
Gun prices are inflated to reduce the amount bought
To be fair, most of that money actually goes to the gov
Like, there's far less illegal guns in Australia then there are in the US
The black market in countries where guns are restricted tends to be quite weak
Yeah, no
It's actually much easier to manage that way around
You could always go the other way, start with the assumption that all weapons are illegal then legalise specific guns.
They burn the forest to create nutrient rich soil for crops, deplete the soil, then burn more forest.
It's slash and burn
Also, the burning Brazil does isn't controlled anyway
IDK if it's the most water/energy/space efficient though
And I think it's sugarcane for cost
It's not meant to burn
not a temperate forest
It's a rainforest
No, a controlled burn is not good for the forest
They completely fuck it up by regularly burning the Amazon though
I know Brazil is one of the world leaders on biofuel
and biofuel is all about sugar
Well yeah, it's got a middling sugar content
In the US corn I think
Plants
That too
It's as complex as the paint that was being used in houses in the US (which was regulated against in most of the rest of the world) being theorised to have an effect on crime
Honestly, if I was trying to craft a country with generally nonsense laws I don't think I could have done as well as the US
The issue is that US gun laws make no sense
They're clearly failing
So yeah, lots of countries near the bottom of that list are very urbanised
And Japan is like, 95+?
Aus is 90%
80% is low end for a developed country
so urbanisation is super important
Most shootings happen in cities
What Iski is saying is correct
Also, gun regulation is bipartisan (technically tripartisan) here, which is really helpful.
we just don't have shooting that often because we've regulated decently
Gun culture in Aus is still toxic as all hell
yeah, but it's also kinda the point
Over time they've just restricted the hell out of guns to the point where you can mostly just get hunting rifles unless you can prove you need something more
ye, it's one of those cases where the "reserves the right to ban" comes into play
Letter of the law is 50 cal, in practice most guns that high are banned though
but just because they're so limited we don't have major issues
I disagree with that Rakhi, the "big man with a gun" BS still exists here
Plus there's strict licencing
In Aus all high calibre, automatic, hand guns and shotguns with over a certain magazine capacity are banned and the government reserves the right to ban any specific gun for any or no reason.
Like, Bill Clinton defined what an assault weapon was when he banned them
That's always the weirdest argument
You can define the term as a government
Like, it's not a thing here
I don't know a single person or know of a single person who owns an automatic weapon

The harder it is to produce crypto, the more power and resources it costs the more valuable it is
No, they don't care about the costs, in fact it's in their best interests to drive them as high as they can because crypto gains its value from the cost
I want to stop the destruction of the environment, not tax it
Crack down on the servers
That's not true
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Enough regulation for crypto is outlawing it
They're both wasting power to accomplish nothing. Pretty much the same hypercapitalist depravity
It probably wouldn't be hard to just lump NFTs when done involuntarily under art theft
NFT went too far when it was just a concept
Regular people don't use the excessive amounts of power that crypto does
It's not hard
Power usage
We need more powerful environmental regulation that bans the waste of power in pursuit of profits
Yes, both Iski and I are arguing they should do that
People who fight tax evasion hate crypto
Crypto is used heavily for tax evasion
Won't work
Because it's probably very similar to the way you'd enforce a ban
And Cypher, the other point that's not been discussed, how do you plan on enforcing taxes on Crypto
"Anyone who's found to be trading crypro will be forced to cede all profits and be fined"
That's what you're doing if you tax crypto though
There's already too much of that BS, we don't need more
Governments should not be incentivised to profit off of the destruction of the enviroment
Hard to flee a country when all your money's in illegal shitcoins <:OMEGALUL:789275945885761567>
We don't actually live in a democracy
Governments act unilaterally frequently
Why is your argument now parliamentary rather than moral?
How did the last law pass in Italy?
Easy, just do it
I think your case is not good
Always deferring to "there must be a nuanced point of view" is wrong, sometimes there just isn't.
Moderation is a fallacy. There are some things that do not cut down the middle. Things like this, where there's no product being generated but a huge amount of waste are just bad.
That thinking is lazy as hell honestly
It's not grey
Wasting power on this scale is just terrible
It's really not that hard
And governments should also torch those corps to the ground
Governments worldwide need to start crushing corporations that waste power
Corporations have far too many rights and need to lose the vast majority of them
if there's a discrepancy they should be able to investigate
Governments should be able to track private and corporate power usage
Maybe, just maybe here, we're arguing that laws should generally be changed
The same way nicely asking businesses to pay taxes will work <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Democracy is purposefully convoluted to ensure that votes are essentially worthless
The rich fuck over the poor and use nationalistic tools like what you are saying to make a subset of the poor side with them.
I don't care about the country. I feel more kinship with a poor Indian than I do a rich Australian
What you think doesn't actually matter
and the law changes
to corrupt politicians
Then they pay a lot of money
They're a mirror of the elite of a country
honestly
They're really not
I personally think you have a lot too much faith in democracy to actually achieve the goals people want. There's been very little of this honestly
Yeah, I'm still with Iski here
Also, "trickle down" is the name the public, who despise the theory gave it. It's name in economics is supply side and it's still widely taught.
That doesn't mean high salt intake won't fuck up your blood pressure
The trend is not simple because very low salt intake is also problematic
Not a linear trend does not mean not a trend.
And whether you like it or not SS economics is a school of economics. That alone is problematic. In actual sciences that school would be excised if it refused to follow the method. Scientists disassociate things like that from practiced science. Freudian psychology for example is mostly relegated to pseudoscience with the exception of the couple of things he got right by shear luck.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6770596/

Wow, would you look at that
It's not highly contested, the evidence proves it doesn't work. The fact it's still used by economists that are taken seriously and a part of economic theory is exactly what I'm talking about.
Also yeah, standard "fuck you" to Boris
<@255412045933969408>  I see a lot of economic theory that just doesn't work but is still taught in economics classes. The entirety of Silly Side (my phone corrected this and I agree to much to change it) as an example. The claim that cutting taxes for the rich will somehow trickle down as higher wages is made ad infinitum by economists but it's never happened. All I feel trickling down is something else. This theory is still taken seriously though. That's what I mean when I say it's like early psychology. All you need is clout to have your dumbassery taken seriously.

Look at the difference in these takes and how much better polis can actually be
Most countries use juries very sparingly and tend to try most things by judge alone
Yeah, Cypher's right here, the US judicial system is very weird
Yeah, Aus is much more consistent with political rights, it's theoretically possible for an 18 year old to become a rep, PM or run for senate
Criminals should have the right to vote
I also don't support the former
And I hope it never becomes one
At least in Australia the latter isn't a thing
That's a bad argument IMO. There's plenty of people over 18 who can't think for themselves too
You have those abilities as a kid too
What's your point?
And I know adults like that too
What is that but political activism in kids mostly under 18?
We had the freaking school climate movement here
I know many politically active kids under 18
No, that's not at all true
They're not stupid
I work with them
And don't underestimate 16 year olds
The majority of adults have no fucking idea what they're voting for either, so I don't buy that argument
I personally agree with generally lowering the age of voting. It's important to have some voice on schooling from people actually involved in schooling IMO. 16 seems like a good compromise where people have enough understanding to vote but also are still in that system/have a better understanding of how it works. It also forces earlier political education, which is important.
We've moderately improved since then
into cities
Na, remember when the plague happened we were literally throwing bodies over walls
Yeah, I saw this one when it happened and it pissed me off so much
He was legit still in school at the time
Actually, an 18 year old almost won a seat in our last state election
Well would you look at that? An opportunity.
Biden talks a lot about wanting to be like FDR right?

yep, but it's also being used with knowledge of the fact that it carries a different connotation now than it did a year ago, at least within the online space who are their main consumers
I think it works fine because it's Nagatoro
It's also a super memey show to start with though
Also, personal pet peeve, but can this idea of "literal translations" die already? They don't and can't exist. It's not as important as the other things he was saying but it always makes people who talk about it look ignorant

Basically in the creation of an NFT a secure code is generated. To transfer it the code has to be solved and it's designed so the only way to do that is with brute force.

Even the guy with the Trump picture agrees with Biden on this apparently
I do find trash yaoi harder to watch in general though
There's well written yuri, Yaoi and straight romance anime, and then there's utter trash for all three and for some reason I just consume all of it
To be fair romance anime in general quite often has a boatload of issues. I'm watching at least two exceptionally problematic romance anime this season and neither are gay in any way.
They were trying to force open negotiations with bosses that wouldn't even come to the table
Blockade in and blockade out both have their uses

No, the tactics they're using are pretty standard union blockade tactics

Less fish and chip shop owners though <:ChrisYikes:679341065878241292>
Oh, I have no issue with that at all, in fact I wish more people from normal jobs would get into politics
The issue is she's very bad at actually getting anything done
I agree with her ideologically, if she was half as effective as Sanders or Khanna are I'd agree with Kat
People like Ro Khanna and Sanders actually do get bills passed and even people like Ilhan Omar have been significantly more productive than AOC
To be fair here, there are actually progressive congresspeople who get more done than AOC
More visible, more popular, yes, and that's kinda where the good stuff stops
So I disagree that she's getting more experienced in politics
She's one of the worst people in Congress when it comes to actually getting bills past
AOC is useless
Pretty much honestly
But to act like there's no good reason to not vote Hillary/Biden is absurd
No he's not
There's very legitimate reasons to dislike either. If you could put that aside I literally don't care
<:HanekawaConfused:609373440008388648>

There's good and bad reasons on both sides
And people also voted for Clinton because she was a woman
Yes, and plenty of people also reasoned voting Trump over Hillary because Trump promised a return of industry while Clinton promised literally nothing
But I think that the video's a bit short and misses out on some important ideas like how propaganda impacts the populous's ability to reason as a whole or the use of a system like direct democracy rather than lottery based democracy (which seems like a really obvious thing to talk about to me)
Also, he does cover that in the video
I think most people do care about reason, it's just that it's also very easy to fall into using flawed reasoning
Fair point honestly
Honestly though, you can complain if you want but the fact is, because unions in France use tactics like this France has much better worker conditions and more pro worker policy than most countries do.
The blockade has been highly effective. They've got political backing after it.
So in this case blockade in makes sense

There's the page with the numbers, as for what to say I think the best thing you can do is just explain to the person who picks up what's happening, what his parents are doing ect. I'd just try to be as calm as you can, write out a list of the important info before you call and make sure that you tell the person who picks up all of the information you have and can.
What country are you in?
That's probably a really good start
What's up?
There's a fairly good chance it wouldn't have resulted in a Rep party today
Also, god knows what sorts of impacts that would have had on the Republican party
Like, he was undeniably better than Wilson, but I think his real impact would have just been destabilising the two party system had he won
I'm not so sure about that honestly, I don't know how much Teddy winning would have impacted the US's policy in the long term
The Reform Party was interesting, I think them succeeding would have been a net positive, but I don't think they were actually better than the Democrats
Teddy and Ross Perot both came quite close though
I mean, it's not impossible to kill off a political party, but in the sort of system the US has it either requires a very strong candidate with huge amounts of support running against a weak major party candidate, a willingness to lose multiple elections or realistically both. Disbanding the parties is probably impossible, having one or both die off would be the closest thing that could happen.
Without even having a filibusterer too
The thing that normally saves us from the worst of our idiots is our PR(ish) senate basically being a giant, frustrating roadblock to literally anything happening.
Aus has a lot of problems, but we're a good example of why preference voting won't really solve issues
Limit fire arms to a musket or a flintlock
Aus has a preference voting system and with the sole exception of the Gillard minority government it's never stopped one of the two major parties taking power.
You need some sort of a proportionally representative system
Preference voting doesn't fix shit
The problem comes when the majority of both major parties in hard two party systems start agreeing

Cecil, I'd highly advise just blocking idiots on twitter. The platform's toxic as hell and it's not worth the effort.
I probably should have said denomination
I was referring to Catholicism in particular
Yes, I'm well aware that the faith is fairly regressive in general cocoa
There's kinda two separate points here. There's the institution, the Catholic church and the faith Catholicism. The Catholic church unarguably has huge issues with homophobia amongst other things. You can however be a Catholic without holding those views.
Religious discussion is allowed, it's certainly happened before
For me it depends how yikes, I've let some minor stuff slide in the past but I've also certainly pushed back on some of the worse stuff I've seen
You prove it by repeating the experiment a few times and getting no results
You aren't, but it's a hint as to potential times this may have happened
The actual method used to produce the results is a huge issue
Also, to be clear here, the reported method is fine
That's why author bias is also a huge issue
I mean, bias goes beyond just written method. That's literally what the thing I was talking about before, P-hacking is. It's where you perform an experiment several times with a ton of factors that you're trying to correlate for. Your method can be perfect, but because you're only reporting on the one time you get a result you can find a correlation just by statistical coincidence.
I'm inclined to heavily disagree with that. I think what the use of jargon often does is cover up the biases of scientists fairly successfully. It makes finding biases far harder even for those with training.
Yep, pretty much
It's very good at giving the appearance that biases have been stripped. If P-hacking tells us anything it's that they're very much not.
Not the only consequence of that problem, but it is one of them
Mostly due to a better understanding of the source material. From my experience most scientists can explain their experiments in plain English fairly well they're just encouraged not to because, and this is something that a fair few scientists have agreed with me on, the entire scientific journal process is absolutely archaic and fucked.
That rests on the unfortunate assumption that scientific journalism is remotely good at its job
I don't think that's worth the cost of making science completely opaque to the vast majority of people however
The university system is, education as a concept is not

It's at least slightly harder to bring on a new guilded age when your party ideology tends to get in the way
While Labor here isn't fantastic they still get pulled leftwards by union influence

The research had been ongoing for quite a while, but they did get like 20 years worth of funding in a year or some shit which allowed them to rush the tech along significantly
What I don't agree with is using tax payer money to fuel the greed of large corporations

The best argument against the death penalty is that ~1/20 people who are executed are later acquitted
Can you prevent the person from doing it again in a less extreme way? If the answer is yes then you should do it in a less extreme way.
That's my issue
It's more about revenge for those who were wronged rather than any real outcomes
So please don't say no-one would
I have an issue with giving even serial killers the death sentence
The judge doesn't get to decide that, ultimately it's the prisoner who does. In all cases inmates should be given humane treatment and access to facilities like education.
Forced labour is not the best option, it's got serious issues when it comes to conflicts of interest inherently and it's just generally a questionable thing. The best option is a reformed, humane prison system with a focus on rehabilitation where possible
Given how absurdly high the prosecution rate is
Also, I don't trust the Japanese system to find just outcomes anymore than I trust the US
Here's the thing Cypher, I'd go a step further than that. Any penalty that's more about revenge than actual outcomes including what you suggested earlier, the use of solitary confinement is wrong.
My dad listened too much to English media and was convinced they were going to under perform, owes me $10 now <:kek:732183601252139028>
Yeah, no-one's beating the SNP in Scotland though
One of Yang's good policies
My personal favourite is to remove the ability to give donations at all but to give everyone a certain amount of money that can only be given as political donations every year
I mean, if you're an anti-Starmer member of Labour you've just been handed a cudgel to bludgeon him with. If he's going to be removed it would be over the next few weeks.
Then again, I am an Aussie and if there's one thing we do it's oust our leaders
I mean, the only way that wouldn't be the best option is if Starmer steps down or is ousted at this point from my point of view
Honestly, at this point I'm kinda wondering if the best move for the left of Labour would be to accept the next election as a loss and actually split off while trying to take unions and the base with them, because they're just not going to win under Starmer anyway
Legit talking about how much damage Corybn did and how they need to "change even faster" (run further right)
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
They're already trying to blame this on Corybn
Doesn't that say it all?
So basically Labour did well in the areas where Starmer had less influence on the election
If people in the UK actually wanted Liberalism the Lib Dems would be a major party
That would be Sinn Fein
It would also really help out Sinn Fein
If Scotland leaves it would bolster Plaid
Honestly, yes
They're nowhere near as powerful as the SNP though
Plaid Cymru is a thing
The SNP could try their chances there I guess
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Yeah, London would succeed before them
~50% of seats in a semiproportional system isn't just non-meme, it's actually absurd
Scotland is quite happy with them, it's more England who has a raging hatred for them.
And the SNP increased their voteshare in this election
This is honestly a mischaracterisation of what's happening in Scotland. The SNP is more popular in Scotland than pretty much any other European party I know of is in their own country. If they were using the same BS system as the Tories they'd be over 80% majority. As it stands they already look to receive about 50% of votes. They're winning a near majority in a proportional system.
I'm really not sure on Germany, guess it depends on if the new CDP leader messes up campaigning
Na, the AMS is objectively a much better system than straight FPTP
Yeah, ironic thing is they'd have a clean majority under Westminster rules <:heh:789431887135113241>
Although, I wouldn't be surprised if it happens anyway
They will do it, but maybe not right now since it looks like the SNP are going to be 1-2 seats short of a majority, which is what they were using as their go signal
I'd vote for them <:Kapp:640344508692693002>
damn, they actually fell one short
Based on what the Greens and SNP are saying it sounds like they're planning to push another referendum through this term anyway

I'm sensing a pattern here
I think the Shetlands would be more pro Scotland/EU than pro UK if it came down to it
Their top 2 parties are the Lib Dems and SNP
yep, not surprised
To be fair, it's not like they're voting Tory. You'd expect the Shetlands to be fairly in favour of rejoining the EU since they vote Lib Dems
<:heh:789431887135113241>
I'm assured they're the good game company though
The meat lobby tells me every day that meat isn't a problem. And look at all the **talking points**
Even if you concede the design does work you could make a far better bench by just extending the back out on one side
It's drawn without a back specifically to make the bench look useful
na, they almost all do
~~also, why is the wheelchair drawn without a back?~~
Not like someone with a wheelchair could just like, pull up beside the bench
In theory it lays out your ideology more clearly and gives voters an idea of what an opposition's policy platform is. It also aids to hold the government accountable since you can't expect the opposition leader to be a master of all of the different offices in government, so having a shadow minister for transport, as an example allows that person to more actively check what the actual minister for transport is doing for any errors.
Because that's what this looks like to me <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Are Labour trying to lose opposition to the Greens?
It has a lot to do with toxic elements in the gaming community too. CDPR always presented themselves as being the "Gamer Gate" company, which the most toxic parts of the gaming community lapped up.
I'm not saying it's that simple, but the man's a terrorist whatever way you look at it
I think there is a diplomatic solution to this but at this point it probably involves terrorism charges for Netanyahu
There's a certain powerful nation that has a history of supporting Israel and blocking any intervention that the international community tries to make
there's nothing wrong with complexity in general
I'd disagree with that, the world sucks because we've let the people at the top have too much power and no safeguards against them
We're just about stupid enough to destroy ourselves
I think you're overestimating humanity there Solo
The idea of shooting down something travelling at super high speeds has some major issues in general. You shouldn't assume the tech with just catch up. It's fundamentally easier to make something moving at that speed avoid being hit than to hit it.
As much as I agree and want every country to do better, there's a clear distinction between what nations like apartheid SA and Israel have been doing and what nations like Aus or the US do. All of it needs to stop, but there's clear degrees here.
Basically the idea that we shouldn't do any business with states and businesses that commit human rights abuses and should starve them out economically. It's one of the key reasons apartheid SA collapsed.
Boycotts Divestment and Sanctions
BDS doesn't work though <:Kiriclown:771581449077260288>
And you know what? Can't fucking blame them
I also don't think Palestinians trust the Israeli government with their safety
Nuker, that solution sounds less tenable to me than removing the settlements
OK, but I'd believe something similar, like the British army committing atrocities in the last war they were involved in
They totally do by the way <:Kapp:789259331072819241>
Yeah, I really don't get dying on this hill
Yes, that is literally the Israeli propaganda narrative
It's pretty well reported that many, many children have died in Israel's bombings
What?
I even just said I support sanctions on China too
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
Israel is one of the worst violators of international law on earth
no. That's just not true
I don't think NK is relevant here and Myanmar is a fucking hard case
Oh, I'm in favour of sanctions on China
For civilians with children? You sure about that one? And for so many that they get death tolls 10-15x higher than Israel and have injured citizens crying on the street for dead relatives after bombings rather than celebrating their sacrifice. Something doesn't add up there, I'm sorry.
Has it ever reduced the frequency with which Israel has been bombed?
Honest question
What does bombing back accomplish
That's how it normally is Nuker
Yep
None of us said it's black and white, I'm well aware that the Palestinian leadership isn't good either.
Anything that paints Israel in a bad light no matter how many sources it has=anti Israel propaganda
NZ has a much better record of treatment of the Maori and generally more diplomatically neutral stance than Aus. It's the latter thing that I'm personally more interested in.
That's not really what I was trying to say here
It's just a matter of degrees. Somewhere like NZ is generally a lot less problematic than somewhere like Israel.
yes, pretty much
I wouldn't argue against that
I mean, my country is also a war criminal state
Where did anyone say it doesn't? It's founding was problematic but that can be said of many and it's current condition is untenable, but I don't think that's a controversial statement. Israel should exist, but not as it does now. That's my opinion on the matter.
I wouldn't be surprised if it's just too volatile for them to want to stick their necks in it.

My country would 100% kill as many civs as it took, my country is also shit.
This is the equivalent to the argument, "the terrorists took over the school so we had to bomb it", like no, you didn't?
I mean, the IDF kills more civilians than Hamas. Regardless of intentions, whether that's collateral or not, it's a huge problem.
The IDF also has a long history of killing civilians
Not to mention they have a fresh supply of radicalized recruits who lost family members in air strikes. Perhaps that's a large part of the reason Hamas continues to exist.
If you continue bombing your citizens will die too, likely in greater numbers in retaliatory strikes.
The wars Pug cited were justified by civilian deaths too
Yes, which helps to highlight the stupidity of the prolonged war. Where did anyone here say they want Israelis to die? We just think the methods of the IDF only serve to make the situation worse via escalation.
I think there's a better solution
I disagree that the IDF is trying to stop the bombing. If they are they've chosen the most inefficient method, because 15 years later and they haven't.
That's a sweeping statement that's probably not true, but even if it was you can avoid radicalising more
On the back of New recruits radicalized in 2014
Yes, and Israel is giving Hamas exactly what they want every time there's bombing in Palastine. Further radicalisation and a firmer grip on power.
Ok, but what has Israel actually given Palistine, last I checked one of the key issues here are the illegal Israeli settlements in Palistine . It's really not negotiation if you won't even agree to follow international law.
The whole organisation, maybe not. But if Israel was actually willing to negotiate with Palistine it would actively harm Hamas. Hamas gets a great number of recruits due to radicalisation because people honestly believe there's no other way. Remember there's Hamas the organisation, but also actors within Hamas.
Solo, I was born in a country that had a radicalized militant problem before I was born admittedly but it still certainly had one. Years of being harsh with the IRA attempts to disrupt their leadership, trying too root them out and destroy them accomplished literally nothing. What stopped the Troubles was negotiation. The only thing that can. Israel needs to be willing to negotiate with Palastine and Hamas or nothing will ever change. That is my fundamental point of view.
They did, but if you take a step back and ask why that became a popular ideology in the first place the answer is troubling
That isn't a solution, it's an atrocity
I'm aware it's probably unattainable but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be mentioned.
Straight lines on maps are good right?
Pretty much honestly. There's nothing wrong with economically and technologically undermining them but it's quite clear that military action is an abysmal failure. Less people would probably die on both sides in the long run if Isreal didn't retaliate. You can look at this as simply letting citizens die if you really want, but that's not really what it is.
Hamas does benifit from radicalisation, which is why Israel needs to stop with the current status quo. The killing of more Palistilians will sustain Hamas into the future. Even if Israel used extreme actions they would continue to be a problem. Negotiations may not work, but it's certainly better to try than to continue endlessly pushing the exact same thing that's been happening for the last 15 years. The appearance of honest negotiations at the very least is a good tool to slow the tide of radicalisation even if those negotiations don't accomplish much.
Well, Japan in general, I know Hirohito generally had less control than a lot of leaders. He probably could have stopped it though.
If anyone started the war before Hitler it was Hirohito
There's a reason why people from the US go to Canada or Mexico to buy insulin even without normal governmental support in those counties
Any drug on medicare here is capped at a $35 copay, but I think insulin is a special case that's capped lower
Either that or 5G
I mean, the media's shit and won't hold them to account for bombing hospitals, but if there's one thing the media loves it's the media
And quite frankly, I'm not so sure it exists
They fucked up when they bombed the media, because now they're actually being pressed to give evidence
I'm talking about from Israel
Solo, people are dying in huge numbers. Covering up evidence isn't good enough.
Quite frankly I want evidence that Hamas was operating in the buildings Israel has hit, because when they're pressed on it they never give any evidence
then again, basic levels of research into potentially contradictory facts to your narrative isn't Prager's strong point.
They couldn't have chosen a worse comparison to prove their point if they tried <:sigh:230149462880813056>
It's why the idea of solving this issue via rich countries donating vaccines is an utter fantasy.
80 million is better than nothing but the pandemic fucks with your sense of scale. Since most vaccines are two doeses we need about 10 billion.

This is basically a drop in the bucket.
I know what you meant, I just felt the need to add that
I mean, no, it really doesn't make any sense at all
Don't get me wrong, I don't like Hamas
Fatah weren't completely opposed to war but they certainly weren't Hamas
Pre Hamas, relatively
When relatively peaceful co-existence is resulting in the loss of land to fundamentalists with government backing what do you expect people to vote for though?
But even the election of a radical party traces back to the actions of the Israeli government. The more moderate Fatah were unable to produce anything positive for the state because of the actions of primarily Israel.
The problem is, you can say there's reasons why this happens but they do ultimately stem back the Israel. If Israel had properly recognised and worked with a Palestinian state rather than driving them off of their lands none of this would be happening at all.
That's all I'm getting at
No, I think Israel needs to do better
Not a ton more to investigate there
Hamas is recognised by the UN as a terrorist organisation already
before mentioning that Israel's infrastructure is just far better too, which means even if a bomb lands it's far less likely to injure or kill anyone and if it does the numbers tend to be far lower.
Yeah, as do you. You seem to be assuming quite a lot about what it's like on the Palestinian side. But there's a few important facts here. The death toll is far higher and Israel has been bombing key pieces of infrastructure that would aid in civilian responses to the bombings. Regardless of what it's like in Israel the position that they're similar situations seems indefensible to me.
You're situation is substantially better
This is what that means
You've been justifying these strikes day after day
With all due respect, I've been pissed off with this convo for days now. If it was 50 Israeli kids you'd be singing a very different tune.
completely disproportionate and unacceptable under any circumstance
50+ Palestinian children this year
Even if that's true, the death toll is too high to justify the attacks
I have done some research on this. The issue is I've come to the understanding that what Israel is doing is, regardless of the situation they're in abhorrent and completely unjustifiable. There's not a both sides to that. There's a complete failure to release even the smallest amount of information about why the institutions that are hit are hit. But even if that information was released hitting a school or a hospital is completely unacceptable at all.

Your argument that I'm being fed a narrative is laughable. Do you know what the narrative about this has been in the west for the last decade? Media has pushed the idea that Israel is completely in the right. That's only just started to break down this week. Politics here has been laughable too. Full support for Israel no matter what. Only folks on the very far left even question that. Disregard the fact that even HW Bush told Israel that bombing civilian buildings like schools and hospitals was unacceptable in any case.

I just disagree with your both sides argument. One side has 20x more deaths, an inferior army, is treated like shit by the Israeli gov, who occupy over half of their territory and no real way to defend themselves at all. Both sidesing when you're in such a dominant position and realistically hold every card strikes me as a bit absurd. I'll probably stop here for now though.
But there's also a reason we don't let people with a stake in a case into a jury
But I will compare, because the simple fact is the Israeli government and the IDF are killing more people than Hamas is, and that's a huge issue.
Gonna be honest
I really doubt Bibi actually wants negotiations right now either
The reason why people tend not to give the point of view that you're stating very much credence is that ultimately, Hamas aren't the ones directly responsible for the majority of deaths here. We can either talk about direct or indirect cases here. If it's direct then the IDF are the largest issue. If it's indirect then you also have to consider the rolls that Israel plays in sustaining Hamas as well. In either case Israel is the large issue here. 

But there's also another point here, criticise that which you actually have some power over more harshly. The west as a whole have the power to leverage Israel and reduce their actions in Palestine. Leveraging Hamas is harder. We can do things like negotiation brokering, and I'd be surprised if there isn't a ceasefire fairly soon due to this, but the only other thing we can do is try to support the Palestinian elections, which are much harder to push ahead now because of this. If the UN moves against Israel there will be some impact. I don't see what more the UN can realistically do against Palestine here, short of boots on the ground and that's a bad idea for various reasons.

Also on the plastic straws debate, it's very notable that reusable plastic straws are not being banned and are a suitable replacement for disposable plastic straws. You'd just need to remember to carry one with you.
Lactose persistence arises when a mutation stops the lactase enzyme from being turned off as you age as it's meant to.
Nope, cows cannot break down cellulose. The bacteria in their guts can.
Creating truly novel genes is very hard, it's more of a copy/paste operation
Uhhh, genetic engendering requires the genes to already exist in some form the vast majority of the time.
Yes, there is but also there are potential energy molecules that are organic and have existed for hundreds of thousands of years that aren't used by bacteria at all like butane.
In large animals, yes, in microbes far less so
This isn't how evolution works.

Firstly, plastics aren't easy molecules to break down. They're not like most organic molecules that occur in nature. 

Secondly, you can't guarantee that any evolution will happen just because it would be useful or fill an available niche. There needs to be a possible mutation or pathway of mutations that will cause that evolution. Being able to break down cellulose would be very useful for mammals but it never arose, probably a simpler adaptation too.

At the same time, if you didn't allow for predatory housing practices the cost of welfare in one specific area, rent assistance would notably drop.
Just expanding on what Mel said though, why do we actually allow rich people to reinvest their wealth in ways that are objectively bad for the majority for only their own gain. Stop and think about that one
I'm just gonna jump in on this early point and point out the flaw. If people didn't own multiple houses the cost of housing would be driven down and people without wealth would need less welfare. There's no world where the rental market actually helps poor people.
Very few nations have ever seriously tried to deal with homelessness. There's very little political gain in it. That doesn't mean a country would collapse, what would happen however is that once shelter is actually treated as a right people might actually start pressing for more and governments being paid for by the rich really do not want that to happen.
this exact same argument you're making could have been made in defence of slavery
OK, and what we're saying is that we should leave behind the exploitations of this era

I mean, removing is just the extreme form of reducing. State ran public housing replacing rent would have a giant stimulatory effect on the economy.
Cypher, you realise that doing things to reduce or remove rent actually has a stimulatory effect on the economy right? If you want economic recovery you want the average citizen to have more money to spend, rent eats into that transferring the money to more well off landlords who are less likely to spend it.
Realistically it's not. It's a moderate issue that could easily be dealt with if there was political will, but it's easier to just not deal with it and use the political situation to your advantage if you're a poli.
So if they don't have money for rent it's at least partially an economic problem. An economic problem that only effects a minority group is both an economic and social problem
Social reasons and economic reasons are often inseparable.
My parents are also landlords and are fully aware of my stance on this. They don't even fully disagree with me weirdly enough.
If you have 3+ properties it's not the governments job to look after your welfare
I'd even go a step further and just seize any property past the second
Announce that rent will be made illegal after a few years, offer a buyback at ~50% of market rates. You'd basically be spearing the property market anyway.
IDK why you'd expect government ran housing to be more expensive than the current system where the government pays rich people for the plebs existance
It would long term save money. The government doesn't have to pay rent once it owns land, it would only need to deal with maintenance and new building to meet growth. You could completely do away with rent subsidies though, which is huge.
Are we letting AI design policy now?

Fair
Oh
Wrong channel?
Yeah, fighting someone with a gun when you don't have one is very rarely an option and if you're not trained to do so you shouldn't even try
The attempts to normalise this garbage piss me off so much
Can't say I'm surprised by that. Bats tend to house a ton of viruses generally.
The first paragraph is basically saying "History is only important where it pertains to the USA"
This seems like an even more extreme case of that
It is problematic when history becomes overly focused on a single point of view. As an example the history I learned in school was far too much European history with a complete lack of any Asian, African or pre-colonisation American history plus only a tiny amount of Aboriginal Australian history.
You have to care about your police system if you're a minority or poor
Insularity moreso than anything
The main reason I don't like ACAB isn't because it's not true. The vast majority are. I don't like it because it feels like a slogan that was focus tested to be as ineffective as possible.
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
There's also the issue that for some reason jobs with extreme power imbalances tend to attract fascists and at current there's really no consequences to them.
I strongly believe that
The majority of police are corrupt
This I'd disagree with. Cops are corrupt because the structure of the police is flawed and there's no real effective oversight. It's a systemic problem.
ACAB in my experience is incredibly self defeating and often makes people who are even somewhat willing to talk about police reform reject its message specifically because of the drama and shock value. Personally even though I hate the current structure and accountability issues that plague the police I think it's a garbage slogan.
Also Iski, people have tried this with and without oversight, believe it or not most still grade pretty similarly even without. It's generally only a good idea if you're using a method where the grade doesn't matter though.
Generally you just end up bumping Cs to Bs and Bs to As and then like, 1-2 grades down one unless you have a real little shit in your class though.
Yeah, asking students to grade their own work is actually a pretty good idea but you have to be willing to say to a student "this isn't 100%" sometimes.
Crazy thing about that Gwyn. When most people are asked to grade their own work they actually undermark by ~10%
That's the point of bureaucracy
Bureaucracy has multiple layers of oversight
A civilian org can be a public institution
Also, I don't trust the military to be un-corrupt either, for various reasons.
Unsurprisingly they normally don't find anything wrong.
But no, it's very common for police forces to just investigate themselves across the world
You'd think so, wouldn't you?
Maybe we should start by not letting the police investigate themselves and having some form of civilian agency responsible for investigating police corruption. Probably doesn't fix the issue, but it's certainly a start.
We don't?
The issues of the police in the US are generally an extreme version of the issues that police across the rest of the world have. Police everywhere else on earth still overly target minorities and the poor. That's pretty constant everywhere. It's just in most countries deaths due to this are radically lower than in the US due to more regulation. That still doesn't make it anywhere near good enough.
Like, the only way we ever get a fairer and more just police system is to actively push back against politicians because polis and police work for each other.
It's generally in governments best interests to have as draconian of a police structure as possible since it helps to reduce potential instability.
with the sort of lead he had early on he could have just kept a low profile and avoided being dumb, he didn't actually need PR stunts
I don't think it's a very good one, but Yang's political instincts seem utterly garbage
Like, he could have just gave some canned answer about improving mental health services that accomplished nothing and no-one would have paid it any attention, is what I'm getting at.
There isn't one, but this doesn't seem like it should be said at all.
But he just couldn't.
I'm convinced that if Yang just kept his mouth shut on social media and just said the obvious shit he's meant to say he'd have coasted through this and won election.
I believe there are some specific Sainsbury's products that are sold overseas in other supermarkets as Sainsburys branded and cat food is one of them.

Uhhh
Japan is almost a one party state

I'm going to say something that might be a little controversial, but we shouldn't tolerate religious beliefs when they start pushing anything morally objectionable.
Like, the clear main problem here is that Japan has a shrine which includes war criminals
Here's my issue with this, are we really happy to give companies the power to dismiss their employees over the most minor of infringements?
Yes, it was last year
I actually am somewhat against the way she's been treated here, but I'm also not a liberal. I do think there's a pretty good chance she legitimately didn't realise all the connotations of her actions because propaganda runs deep on both sides.
It's not just China
The Korean government also takes issue with this shrine by the way
The reason why you'll hear it reported variably between about 2-4 weeks is because it is variable and dependant on your immune system

It's a root property of Indoeuropean that's been dropped multiple times in different languages/families IIRC. It's even more prevalent in reconstructed Indoeuropean.
To me it feels very condescending. It just feel like people who think they know better than the community trying to force a change.

Just be like English, where if enough people agree Yeet is a word Oxford adds it to the dictionary
As I said, the way to think of it using English words would be hes and shes, but as a plural form
I mean, there's a lot of usage of duodecimal in imperial
Part of the reason why they stayed distinct in English is because of the money and measurement systems. Duodecimal shows up all over the place in older systems.
It's common amongst European languages at least to treat 11/12 differently to others
Remember base 12 used to be a more commonly used numeral system at least in some areas
Gender neutral language isn't a linguistic necessity, it's not that uncommon for languages to lack it.
It's kinda like having a word "hes" and a word "shes" as plurals but no "they"
You just reminded me of something but it's pretty shitposty so I'll liveshitposting it

I'm actually pretty livid right now. Victoria underwent a 6 month lockdown last year which helped to bring Covid cases in Australia to zero and they stayed near there for almost a year. States across Aus adopted a fast lockdown response to get ahead of the virus before it could spread but somehow that became politicised. NSW refused to do that because it's Labor's way of dealing with the virus and 'they know better', which predictably caused an outbreak. Now after two weeks of lockdown they're seriously suggesting they may open up next week and just let the virus run through the community.

Like, the 6 months I spent in lockdown is probably about to be made worthless by a dumbass from another state and stupid politics
~~I did take a theology class in uni where the only religious person was the teacher though~~
I don't think religion is generally super important to most in my area though and it's kinda secularised out of necessity since there's sizable Asian, Indian and Indonesian minorities here.
Australia's weird when it comes to religion. We have a sort of split culture between a sizable minority Christian fundamentalists and everyone else wh wishes they'd just fuck off.
I've actually just used single person female bathrooms in a resteraunt before, just asked if anyone gave a fuck and they said no, so <:02shrug:443257729646198784>

Fuck them honestly
I'm pretty happy to see there be actually consequences for someone who robbed the public for once though
"Sorry, we forgot"
I've always held the point of view that vaccines should be mandated and state provided. The societal benefit they offer is too great to allow people to not take them and the consequences are often born by those who had no choice in the matter such as the young or the immunocompromised.
And if you don't listen to your boss at your shitty job they just let you starve
Yes, far more so than megacorps. When was the last time Amazon even had to think about one of it's employee's concerns?
Because government is far more accountable to the people than fucking Amazon?
I disagree with this for one main reason, we shouldn't be effectively deferring public policy to large corps, which is what this is. If it's going to be mandated it should be government mandated, not mandated effectively through almost every corporation in the country having the option to deny service. Why give them the power?
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Do you want to take all of the UK or just Scotland?
The idea of a separation of government and public funds is false. Government money exists to be spent on public projects/betterment and the idea of a separation is what leads to austerity politics, I simply don't believe there is a difference between robbing the government and the public because of this.
One of the players who missed a shot was also a 19 year old kid put into an insanely high pressure situation where he had to hit the final shot in penalties. Kid could end up copping so much shit for that when in reality it's an error to even have a young player taking that shot.
His most worrying quote was something like "parliament gets in the way of governing too much"

Let me introduce you to the man who'll be PM if Morrison gets rolled
Also, Rudd just has more influence than other former PMs
They asked for Rudd because the next one's going to be even more insane
Our PM's given up on being PM and everyone else is taking turns
Yeah, kinda is
Big what the fuck moment
Apparently Pfizer got so pissed off trying to negotiate with Scott Morrison and his government that they refused to talk further with them and requested to negotiate with our former PM Kevin Rudd instead.
And amongst the list of people who agree with that point of view was... Vladimir Lenin
And the NEP would be an example of a communist pushing capitalist policy, it can work in reverse too
None of that changes anything I said. I'm well aware that Marx considered capitalism an intermediary step between feudalism and socialism. I'm not inclined to agree with him there, but I know he thought that and I know it's informed a lot of communist and socialist policy.

That doesn't change the fact that UBS is a socialist policy. Even if it were implemented by an otherwise fully capitalist government who opposed any other socialist policy it would still be a socialist policy. Because policy has a political leaning that can be independent of the party or person pushing it.

To be fair here, calling UBI a capitalist policy is pretty unfair, it is also a socialist policy, just a far lesser one than UBS. The reason why I use that language around it though is because I believe it's favoured by capitalists as the least they can do and get away with. People are pissed off right now, that's why mainstream parties across the world are failing. UBI is throwing the peasants a bone. It's a small shift that doesn't change anything about the market and allows it to stay just as predatory as it already is.

UBI as a policy is more of a mixed ideological bag. It has its capitalist components, it favours the use of the market still and actually attempts to encourage market growth. It also has its more socialist components too, it's redistributory and generally closes the wealth gap probably. UBS on the other hand favours dismantling markets, inherently enforces nationalisation and tends towards favouring government employment. It's pretty much as pure of a socialist policy as you can get.
Universal Healthcare is a socialist policy that's been widely adopted by pretty much every social democrat and even most people right of them
And capitalist governments can implement socialist policy
I'm aware, but there's still a distinction between socialist policy, which tends towards favouring more government control and communist policy, which tends towards favouring more worker control. Most leftists (maybe other than Anarchists) tend towards a mix of both kinds of policy.
It's a socialist proposal, not capitalist nor communist
I don't know why you just assume this would be best handled by a local government. We could literally universalise water and power on a federal level with no actual distributive changes quite easily. I'd argue food should be handled in a way to how the UK handles medicine. The government should hire farmers and distributors and the only role of local government would be running the dispatch. Easy role that's hard to fuck up. As for housing that's literally unsolvable by local governments. They just don't have the resources to bring about changes to housing on the sort of scale that would be required. The best they can do is maybe build a couple of hundred units of public housing which wouldn't cut it. I'd argue housing at current needs large changes to housing law to restrict the ability to rent housing or own multiple homes. There's more houses than people in my country, so if the government just stopped always favouring the rich there'd be plenty of place for people to actually live.
I generally think local governments are mostly ineffective and useless for anything beyond the most basic of tasks
Personally I'd actually prefer to see it done through national initiatives rather than local governments
Not really?
sounds like the average capitalist solution to me
It kinda is, fix the inherently broken economy by just pumping more money into it rather than questioning why it's broken
two years ago UBI was in pretty much the same place
It's almost like billionaires don't pick up and promote niche ideas that don't benefit them
I'd argue they're a fairly centrist party honestly. As far as economics are concerned at least. Racism and bigotry exist in the left as well and just having bigoted policy doesn't make you not left wing
UBI is a capitalist solution to a capitalist problem. The actual left wing version of UBI is Universal Basic Services, where rather than offering someone money you just give them the things they need to live
Must have missed the part where they advocated for workers owning the means of production. Or even attempted to expand worker protection or unionisation at all, both of which are only even traits of centre left parties.

America also tends not to play in international competitions with the sort of importance and prestige of the Euro.

Go for it
And that's why we should abolish capitalism
There's some cases where you clearly need to value societal function above individual choice and when your choice has the ability to impact on the wellbeing of others directly it's time to prioritise society.
To be clear, I also believe the Covid vaccine should be mandated too
I'm talking about vaccines broadly. This isn't just an issue with the Covid vaccine. When cases of polio are on the rise there's a serious societal problem.
The point is, we don't allow people to opt out of taxes due to their beliefs because it's a societal good and the same should apply to vaccines.
That's not a good argument because the people who would argue they shouldn't be made to pay taxes would argue that taxes are government sanctioned theft.
Also, there are people who legitimately believe that not paying taxes is what's best for both themselves and society. Should we just allow these people to not pay their taxes because it's a firmly held belief?
Because they're, too young, too old, immunocompromised, or have some other medical reason why they can't be vaccinated
Your freedom ends when it legitimately endangers another person's life
same goes for children, except even more so
because the people that choice affects the most aren't you
and that's the main reason why I don't think one should have the right to withdraw oneself from vaccination
But it's super shit for anyone who's immunocompromised
It's still shit for them
The people who suffer the most from antivax are the immunocompromised. At least the antivax kids still have a functional immune system to fight off an infection should they get one.
See, I have a somewhat different take on this. It should never be the individual's choice. Vaccines aren't about defending yourself fundamentally. They're about defending society. A personal opt out for vaccines is in my opinion far too individualistic and allowing people access to too many ways to potentially harm others who can't be vaccinated for legitimate means.
Yeah, I think the only person who should be able to waive vaccine requirements should be a doctor
Based on my experience as a horny teenager it's hard to get teens to talk about much else in general. I really don't know how much you can do about this.
That's for the poor to worry about, the government can just become more and more authoritarian
I could see it
IDK, they might actually leave the EU to push more antidemocratic policy
Why stop when you're on a roll?
~~and maybe the UK~~
The only nation I could see acting as if they're an independent nation is Russia
No shit the EU will get super pissed off at them
and I don't just mean EU nations
The issue is that if Poland declares themselves not a part of the EU but doesn't follow EU procedure then every other nation's just going to keep treating them as part of the EU
Them unilaterally declaring themselves not part of the EU is about as valid as me unilaterally declaring Australia a part of the EU
If they want to leave they have to do so through the EU's system
Not yet anyway
They could honestly just release whatever political dirt they have on the Polish government if they wanted to go down that route, since realistically they probably have enough evidence of corruption on most govs in the EU to collapse them completely if they wanted.
Yeah, people are going to put their immediate survival first and when a government can't provide that this is always what you're going to see

Oof, why are people like this
It's almost like having the Olympics during a global pandemic is a stupid idea
I'm safer because guns aren't widespread in my country
In my 25 years I have literally never felt any need for a gun
You don't need a gun for self defense
They're by far the most dangerous type of weapon.
For the love of god
Also, ban handguns
But seriously, a basic ass hunting rifle is a tool. A military designed semiauto is you waving you dick around.
Other countries also regulate the carrying of knives and bats
It does however make us a great example of why gun apologists are completely wrong.
Australia is unfortunately very similar culturally to the US
But other countries mandate it
Yes, and other countries have regulations such as requiring fire arms to be stored in lockboxes without ammunition so this shit doesn't happen.
When it's easy for a 16 year old to obtain a gun your gun laws are not fine.
Something that ought be regulated
This doesn't happen in other nations mostly because there's more regulation around literal killing machines
People love to try to shift the blame for this in the US to some cultural issue, but the actual fact is their gun laws are insane
Not that either of those are something to aspire to
We also have some pretty shit parents and garbage mental healthcare too
You know, the vast majority of people in Australia never Recieve gun education and this isn't a problem we have.
Other countries have poor parenting and mental healthcare without this being a giant issue.
I blame their gun policy
He did restrict what guns could be sold
They're the same thing
But he imposed it
He sunsetted it like a moron
Also, Clinton actually did impose some gun regulation
Well, not banned but restricted heavily
It wasn't going to happen in Australia until 1996
This is an entirely different issue to if guns ought to be banned
America does not get a free pass
I expect every country to offer their citizens basic safety
That's not what statistics seem to imply
It lines up too well with the theory that it is, in fact gun ownership that's the issue.
And there's a very linear progression of gun violence from countries with absolutist gun policy like Japan and Korea having nearly no cases of fatal shootings, to heavily restrictive countries like the UK and Aus having slightly more, then more still in countries like Switzerland that enforce some but nowhere near enough regulation and finally countries like the US that fail to regulate.
They're not though
I think you're  arguing against statistics, because in no way are you made safer by guns. Maybe you should ask the protesters about that one.
If I am attacked, then that's too bad. I got unlucky. I'd rather not have to take extra risk.
You seem to misunderstand something, I fundimentially feel safe about my city and don't have to worry all that much about this.
Because I don't have to be paranoid about being attacked
I don't need options
I don't have to rely on law enforcement
At best America's gun culture just enforces a culture of paranoia where you always have to be worried about defending yourself
The best thing to do if you're robbed is just comply
Most robberies happen almost instantly at knife range
Not really
People rarely announce their intention when they plan to stab
You have to know they have a knife for that to work
Which means unless you know a threats already coming it won't work
Because it's a fundimentially offensive weapon
In fact, a gun is unlikely to defend you against anything really
And a gun won't defend you against a knife anyway
The simple fact is, fewer people actually need to defend themselves when no one has guns
If the goal of gun ownership is self defence then it's self defeating
Because that's my actual belief, I think Aus is actually much too permissive when it comes to guns
And those who can should be restricted to only slow firing hunting rifles
You want my utilitarian point of view for why almost no one should be allowed to own a gun?
Banning pistols saves more civilians than it hurts
And most people who talk about that statistic just forget that there's still stabbings in the US
Stabbings are still far rarer in most countries than shootings in the US
They're far to easy to conceal
Banning handguns is quite common across the world
It also doesn't seem to match what I have for that year at all
From Sydney University


That info's from 2006
Where are you getting any of this information from? Japan has stricter gun regulation than the UK by a lot. The easiest way to see this is in firearm count. Japan has 0.3 firearms per 100 people while the UK has about 5.

Japan also almost always rates as the lowest firearm related deaths of any country in the world in any given year sans the micronation that manages to get 0 by shear coincidence. The information I can find puts Japan at 0.02 gun deaths per 100k and the UK at 0.20 in 2015, I'm going to keep looking for more recent information from a verifiable source though.
He's certainly better than 99% of the US's current set of idiots though
I'd still call LBJ more of a welfare-statist liberal, he was still far more lenient towards business interests than even tepid social dems in other countries.
One could make arguments about Teddy too, but his politics are just very weird by modern standards
The only socially democratic president that the US ever had was FDR
Even LBJ/Kennedy were liberals
Having two liberal parties is pretty shit
The democrats did, however, forget to reform their economic policy to be similar to socially democratic parties of other countries

Jim Sterling's been shouting about this stuff for years now
The criminalization of drugs in general in the US, and specifically the radical clarification of marijuana as a schedule 1 drug was and is entirely political.
And again, literally no sources if you click into firearm related homicides
Far fewer homicides than the Sydney uni report

Anyway, the really big issue then is this
Oh, it's in/mil
You can try to justify that if you like but it's more likely they're just wrong.
I'm really not sure about that site Iski, they have no sources for their 2002 (I was wrong about 2006) numbers at all and they seem to be radically higher than any study I can find.
Because Japan's rate of gun death is so low they don't desperate out the statistic
There's a good reason why
Yes?
Bobby Kotick specifically deserves to rot

I am interested though, what do you consider to be a decent argument that he used because I generally consider this to be a factually completely unfounded position that really lacks any valid arguments past "they had socialist in their name"
and there was this minor occurrence called the night of the long knives where Hitler purged anyone with any socialist leanings from his party
but like, I know history
This got recommended to me for some reason
still happens of course, but you can't give that as a rational
Also illegal in most countries
And no, Pax Americana never ended, ask a Latin American.
I agree, but the fact that there's a fairly analogous case where US governments have moved to restrict it's own citizens rights in regard to the state shows that you really can't high-horse about this
Just about Israel instead.
America does that
Yes

I'll shield any other large nations for the same reason. As an example India isn't actually at all a problem when it comes to CO2 emissions, at least at present. Their emissions are well below world average, despite having the 3rd largest raw emissions. China is a problem. They are not the problem you make them out to be. They do need to cut emissions, but not as much as much of the west does.
I listed them because they are actually the worst polluters on earth
I listed a group of countries that include both the US and my home country of Australia
This is why it's really easy for small European countries to cut their emissions drastically
It has a more urbanised population, which makes things like the implementation of mass public transport easier and reduces energy wastage due to distance.
America has demographic advantages over China
otherwise you just end up with maps that measure population by some strange metric
and you're calling per capita BS, but it's the only useful way to measure anything involving countries
You're trying to make it out like they're the largest problem, but objectively they're not
That's a really important fact
I mean, China is still below the OECD average
I don't know what the exact calculus is for China however
You realise that on average rural pops release more emissions in developed nations correct?
It's a more rural country than the US, but there's still more urban Chinese than there are US citizens
Most of China's population is urban
Please do a basic google search before making a claim

Your own damn study mentions it
wait, I don't even have to
but let me do some quick maths on it for you
I don't fully trust the study you're using, I know which one it is but there's literally no information about the group conducting it online
That doesn't say anything. To know how bad they are you need to know how much an average Chinese citizen emmits compared to an average citizen elsewhere
The NYT is normally pretty blatant US propaganda though, so it's not surprising that'd misuse statistics like that
The US still has double the per capita
China overtook the US in 2006, IE in raw carbon emissions
Found a mirror of your article, notice what they're actually saying
and is basically just a population/country map
It lacks context
Also, watch out for this map, because it's what western media outlets use when they want to lie with statistics
Also, the reason why the data is older is because the most reliable, UN sanctioned group only performs this study every 5 years
I can tell you though, what I said is still loosely true, the exact specifics may have changed but the west still houses most of the worst polluters and the US is still one of the worst
yes
Find me a non-NY times article
Naku, I literally can't read your article because it's paywalled
This is what CO2 emissions per capita look like
Just as an example here the US has about half the emissions of China with about one quarter the population. They're two times worse per capita.
To be clear here, I'm not arguing that China's a good model, they also really do need to cut their emissions too. What I'm arguing is that western media loves to use statistics without context in an attempt to condemn China while letting them and their allies off the hook. A more reasonable point of view determines that the real problems are smaller countries that have nearly as high of CO2 emissions as China.
Because if you take into account population, at least as of last year the #1 polluter was Saudi Arabia
But again, is this most polluting by raw number, or taking into account population
I can't read the article because the NYT fucking sucks
Yes I can. Because you're ignoring per capita. Yes, one person shoveling coal into their highly inefficient boat has a lower emmisions than any nation, but per capita they're far, far worse. China has a giant population so it makes sense they'd emit more than other countries. Their per capita emmisions are fairly average, the worst are Aus, Canada, the US and Saudi Arabia.
and busses literally can go anywhere that cars can
and tram lines can go almost anywhere that roads can
Unless you're living on the side of Everest you can probably build a subway
Which means closing off non-main roads to cars or enforcing very slow speed limits on them.
The way how you actually reduce stress longterm is to make use of other transport methods usually quicker than driving
So I don't know why I'd own a car personally
I can get anywhere in the east half of Melbourne within an hour using trains, bikes, and busses
I know some Dutch people who move things frequently actually own those bikes though
Yeah, they probably are
The point is if you can get like 90% of people out of cars you basically fix traffic issues
It may be, but in that case you're not an average road user
The Netherlands have a this
The privatisation has
also, our public transit is owned at the state level which is the highest level that makes sense here and that specific aspect has never caused issues
Cities like Amsterdam where you don't have to own a car are better.
Also, the Romanian was right on one front, it's better to design cities so you don't need a car. This isn't a choice that can be made by the individual in most cases, it's a city planning issue.
That way you avoid co-ordination issues
or office
It's still generally better to have one singular state ran company
You just said it's owned by companies
There's no advantage to privatised public transport
yeah, I've always thought that public transport ought be nationalised
you're already ahead of 95% of the US
Your town has a railway
like, the best in NA and fairly alright even by EU standards
It has a legit good metro system
That's why I didn't mention NYC
The eastern seaboard is the exception
just the lack of metros
not even talking interstate here
I completely understand it, but for cities like Huston and Dallas to effectively have no transport network is absurd
Also, please don't accuse an Australian of underestimating the US's size
Just offer them 9-1 for public transport like the fed gov did for highways
and almost all urban areas fall within one state
But I don't think that really matters because at bare minimum each urban area should be implementing some form of public transport metro system
So is Germany
Uhhhh
So it's probably pretty decent
statisticians seem to really like per capita though
I'm not a statistician, I'm a teacher and a biologist
and I've never seen any metrics other than per capita and raw tonnage
Just raw tonnage isn't good enough
Look, I'm saying this because we need objective measures for how well each country is doing
So raw tonnage?
It should be obvious why that's a flawed metric, it completely fails to account for population and would give you garbage like suggesting Australia is doing better than somewhere like Germany.
Raw tonnage?
To cycle back to this though what are you suggesting we use instead?
Oh
Quite different to what you said before
That's uhhh
Signed, a Melbournian
but it can be worth closing roads for them
that's at least 2 lanes wide if you don't want to close the road
Trams are great and can fit on almost any road
There's always other options such as light rail
Driving sucks
Also yeah
Trips into the city are the core time where it should be 100% emphasised for you to want to use public transport. If it's easier to drive into the city someone's fucked up.
that's a sign that the city has failed its design
going back to my point
Again though
yay I guess?
Melbourne's reached the point where traffic's so bad it's artificially slowed to the point where the train is the best option
and people use the train
It's slow as hell, but driving is way slower
The actual line is more like 40km though
My train goes 30km as the crow flies into the city in 50 minutes
That's slow as hell
That's like 60km/h
WTF kind of train takes 30 min to go 12km?
also, yeah
Because then the fastest way to get there is the train and it will ease traffic
why?
You make the car trip less efficient so the train is the fastest option
So, the answer to this question is really easy Cypher
I watch anime
but streets shouldn't be designed like that if it can be helped anyway
yeah, that's like, the rare exception
~~at least I had a footpath though~~
I cycled on a footpath for 6 years because Australia doesn't think about making things convenient for cyclists
ye
I literally took that bus to uni for 3 years
Bendy busses
There's a bus in my area that goes around a tight roundabout
If we use something other than nuclear in space I'd be very surprised
The point I'm making is that combustion engine car usage is actually the biggest challenge to overcome right now and even electrics powered by coal are preferable. Electrics powered by nuclear or renewable are still far better than that (and public transport powered by renewables is even better).
I agree with that
Car exhaust fumes are a significant percentage CO
Probably really want to stop using LPG then
Carbon Monoxide?
maybe it's just me but I feel a societal duty to minimise the amount of exhaust fumes I'm blasting into children's faces <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
and it's also terrible because it releases the worst of its fumes right in populated areas
so does LPG
Why?
Like, 1 meter worth of farmland
Yeah, that's a huge issue
IDK where you're starting from, but it's really looking to me like it just fails where the grey line ends
I can't glean anything from that unfortunately
You're better off running electrics of brown coal
LPG is one of the least clean fuel sources due to the inefficiency at which petrol engine cars run at
Brown coal burns cleaner than LPG
To be honest they could, at least in that area duplicate the line easily
there's no way around it
In that case they really just need to buy small amounts of land
even if it means lowering the grade and running smaller trains
Ultimately they need to do something about it
There's your problem
Yeah
Because that's a meme and doesn't work at all
for both directions?
Is it a single line?
Wait
Yeah, busses are a good way to get people to and from stations
It sounds like what you need, from my experience with train systems is quadruplicated rails and express/partial express services that run on them
I see
Two cities
anyway, if we're teraforming we're doing Venus first <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I don't think it does however
If mars has a hot core then geothermal would be used
you need a burning gas
It costs more energy to produce the oxygen to burn it than you get from burning it, assuming it's there
That's like, the only thing you'd want to use it for
Maybe to launch rockets
same reason it's super efficient on satellites
Also, solar on mars isn't much weaker than on earth due to the lack of atmosphere
I feel like you might reuse solar from the craft used to get there
Mars's energy with modern tech would likely be nuclear and solar
Because it produces so much energy/mass
The thing is, uranium is actually worth sending from earth to mars
It's a simple fact that at the moment nuclear sources have by far the best ratio for this
Space travel is about energy to weight
Nuclear and solar
Well
also, part of the reason why you need that is to reduce the total amount of sun that Venus gets, because if you want 1atm of pressure and an Earth like atmosphere Venus would get too hot. If you're going to be building shades you may as well have them control day/night anyway
not doing anything about issues is kinda the opposite of teraforming
it can be a mirror array
it also does not have to be a single solid object
~~not to scale~~
Only issue is that you create a small, permanent solar eclipse, but that can be solved by just allowing the centre reflector to be slightly transparent
It's pointless anyway, because if you just make a reflector that looks like this, spin it once per day and focus light into the top of it you have an easy day/night cycle anywhere in the solar system
They also aren't exposed to relentless sun for 100 days
also, I'd assume that a 110 day sleep cycle is outside of the range of human biology
It also is if you want to like, grow plants
You could use the same trick with yeeting the atmosphere to spin Venus up too, the actual amount of energy required is much lower but you need to be super careful not to hit the Earth
Probably is if you want to live there
~~can we build a moon out of solar panels ~~
Probably just want to redirect it to a nearby photovoltaic if possible
fair, but you'd still probably struggle to do anything productive with the light that's not being beamed down to venus
If you want to collect light for mars use mirrors around mars
mainly that light actually impacts on orbits and to minimise that effect you want a less reflective outer surface
That's not a good idea for a lot of reasons
Unless we can think of another solution to this
the mirrors are actually to transmit light to venus
It's still more a meme proposal though, you probably want to use mirrors and shields to regulate the temp and just leave it where it is
and yeah, the main reason why it makes a surprisingly large change is due to how thick the atmosphere is, there's just a lot to yeet.
which is very close to earths and probably the one thing that's hardest to change
and the main advantage that Venus has is its mass
The most realistic proposal I've heard is to use a solar reflector to shield the planet and bring it to sub zero temps so its atmosphere snows down onto the planet though, then use automated machines to collect and shoot the solidified atmosphere (or at least most of it) off world.
Even if it wasn't though you could do double duty by yeeting its atmosphere towards the sun to destabilise its orbit, at least in theory
It's just got too much atmosphere
Venus is within the habitable zone almost for sure
Surface exploration is hindered by iron melting
Oh yeah, a simple weather balloon with sensors would be amazingly powerful
Just exile Venus' heat and atmospheric pressure to Mars
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
Just hang them from an orbital ring supported by space elevators made form unobtanium
Yeah, NASA seems to think it's worth looking into though
And to be fair, a 70 C habitat probably can work for a small research station with the proper cooling used as long as there's a viable way to dump your heat.
I don't see why you'd want to aim above 55km under case
Source of all knowledge has it a touch lower <:02shrug:443257729646198784>
You sure you want to go all the way up to 60km for any reason, considering that puts you in the negative degrees C
Also, one very important fact is what the atmosphere of Venus is. It's almost all CO2, which is why oxygen gas gives you an advantage when it comes to lifting on Venus. Floating in 0.53atm of CO2 is actually significantly easier than doing the same in the Earth's atmosphere
Yes, but you're using a large balloon filled with helium to offset that
We're suggesting go a little higher and take the low pressure as a trade off for not dying to the heat
Like we said, no one's suggesting Earth's atmosphere as a lifting gas or aiming for exactly one atm of pressure outside
So go up to like 55km and it's perfect?
That temp's in Kelvin
Uhhh
Balloon is probably making you think a lot more fragile than what can be used to lift on Venus, remember the atmosphere gives you huge advantage so you can probably make a very large balloon under your colony using 1 cm thick titanium. It doesn't have to be flexible and there's probably advantages to not making it so. You could also use a lighter material to create chambers inside so a breach doesn't send you crashing into the planet.
And the balloon isn't that big
Remember we use heated air, an objectively terrible lifting gas to lift several hundered KG on Earth without the atmosphere density advantage.
You can hang anything off a big enough balloon
And yes, almost everyone suggests a helium oxygen mix as a lifting gas
A hydrogen balloon would float straight to the top of Venus's atmosphere
I mean, no?
That's only true if you use oxygen as your lifting gas
Floating cities works fundimentially and there's nothing wrong with it but it's not teraforming and there's nothing fundamental stopping teraforming from working on Venus.
Comfy
And I think I did actually agree with a couple of the asshole atheist channels back in the day, probably about as much edgy shit as I did as a teen
Around about that time in Aus was this (and I'm going to spoiler it because no-one deserves to see it highly misogynistic bullcrap) so my PoV was already very tilted in the other way because this entire campaign infuriated pretty much my entire extended family.
Yeah, not arguing against that
Makes sense right?
but the party is Labor
I mean, the word is labour in Aus English
Without the u
They used to be liberals in the European sense
And Christ did I hate that man even when I was a teenager
Also probably helps that the conservative leader when I was entering that age range was Tony Abbott
It just didn't for me, probably because my parents never actually strayed away from raising me ideologically, which is a double edged sword I guess
Yeah, that's fair Zoe
I'm very glad that I was raised by my environmentalist/feminist mother and my trade unionist father. Really helped me skip most of this BS in my teens.
honestly though, they're an extreme minority and the vast majority of what happens online is conservatives taking one particularly dumb left aligned tweet and amplifying it to absurdity.
"SJWs" are generally right on most issues, they just tend to be overzealous and tonally deaf in a way that can grate against a lot of people.
Don't even like the guy but I hope he wipes the floor with Barilaro
That shit's crazy
Oh yeah
This is just normal news here at this point
So, there's this war criminal from the Afgan war who decided to take the media to court for defamation for calling him an alleged war criminal despite the fact that he is, in fact in a court case due to his alleged war crimes. In the defamation trial the defence produced a picture of him in Afganistan holding a crusader cross.
Our politics have been so surreal for years now that I'm just used to it
This just feels like an average day looking at news in Australia
Ethical hedonism exists
There are forms of hedonism that are actually good ideologies
Trust me here, protest and political action works
carry on
Fair enough
Also, you're talking very long timeframes here Mel
A nukestorm is going to do as much damage as hundreds of years of burning fossil fuels
The only way the earth heals is if we stop fucking with it
You're not getting a better world by war
You realise that authoritarianism is the only thing that rises from fallen states right?
The odds that humanity is 5 years away from destruction are very, very low
Which means your body's going to try to heat itself up so you feel cold
It's generally fever like symptoms
The resistance to wiping out half the world is astonishingly high
I'm going to tell you why that's wrong even if you believe the outcomes are good
But the fact is, you live in a culture of violence. The US moreso than other countries around the world glorifies war and violence. They're the only nation on earth which has chosen to make guns a major part of their culture. You cannot separate your nature from the ways you have been socialised. The US does have a culture that encourages young boys to be violent and also tells them to repress it. That's not to say that the rest of the world doesn't, but it's exceptionally bad in the US.
Sounds like something an edgy 15 year old would say
If you change culture to value humanity over profits people will be socialised to value humanity over profits.
There's an important fact here, you think the way you do because of your culture, not your nature. Capitalism socialises people to hold certain views and think in certain ways and then tells them it is natural. And it feels natural because they have known nothing else. You can change the way that an average person thinks by changing the culture they are in. Look at the state of the hyperindividualist west VS more collectivist cultures in Asia. That is just a difference of culture and what is valued.
It's absolutely disgusting
It's a business tactic Lily. They don't want to give away what they can't sell because it reduces the value of what they can
I know one of them. Every country should do what France has done and mandate that whenever a business is going to throw away a significant amount of in-date food they are required to call a charity and offer the food as a donation.
This is a very important video I think you should watch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j08ND3_PNgs
There's nothing else to say there
You are wrong
And like, not putting Africa and SE Asia in giant debt traps
you realise it can also be solved by less radical means like increased taxation and welfare programs right?
Personally I want to live to see change enacted, so you're talking a load of shit there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN18WrdwZBQ
Man, this is the second dumbest political story about icecream I've ever seen
Don't disagree with that, but I'm just pointing out that teraforming the sahara or arabian desert is pointless
I'd strongly advise you to watch a few videos from that channel I linked and especially the specific video because it might give you some ideas about better directions for your energy and anger than this
yes
Fact is though, even in places like Saudi Arabia with pretty much no arable land vertical farming and seasteading can work
That's due to imperialism that never really ended
It does
The best future ways to increase food production are vertical farming and seasteading. Teraforming is a waste of limited resources. You teraform when you have no resources left to constrain you because it's inherently very wasteful.
If your ideology cannot help to improve the world in some way it's worse than pointless regardless of how much pain and rage you went through
There is no value to a pointless ideology
Because I see no positive outcomes
What do you even hope to solve with this
I'd hate politics too if the best I could come up with was "let's kill half the world"
The US is an exceptional outlier when it comes to wages
I mean, I make 30 AUD an hour tutoring as a uni grad with no other experience
Like increasing welfare, there are actually people in the US who support this
The odds of you succeeding with that method are far lower than a more moderate and appealing method
No-one will support you
I mean, considering what we've heard recently that makes a whole lot of sense
my first day got cut after like 10 minutes by the announcement <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Yeah, I was meant to do teaching placements right before the first lockdown began here
probably doesn't help that the Spanish Flu is only taught as a footnote to WW1
So many people going into this had no idea what a pandemic actually entails
The only explanation I can think of is that Bloomberg isn't human
No I can't explain why this exists
Also, see a doctor, don't listen to medical advice on discord no matter how well intentioned, it's not a replacement for medical expertiese.
In this case they're using the military to enforce the lockdown. I don't know why they're doing this rather than just doing what every other state did and imposing a harsher lockdown so a few people breaking the rules doesn't instantly derail the response.
Sydney's been a clusterfuck for a while now though. The government's just completely lost control of covid there and it's been increasing week on week. Then rather than implement a proper lockdown like any other state would they call in the army, like the fuck?
I'm in Melbourne, so it's not something that's going to impact me. My government explicitly ruled using the military to contain covid out.
<:ChrisYikes:679341065878241292>
Oh hey, they're calling in the military in Sydney
Disney are just also incredibly openly and visibly scummy
True
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
Disney are objectively evil
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Huh, guess I'd just heard wrong there
Alpha is the Wuhan strain, Beta is the South African/Kent variant
I think it has a lot to do with the pushing of the idea of capitalism and liberalism as all encompassing ideas that have always been and can't be changed though
also, people trying to impose modern politics of premodern history in general is pretty yikes
It's also worth noting that Justinian's conquests were one of the things that probably hurt eastern Rome in the long run. It wasn't the ultimate thing that cause the fall but it did make them weaker when that came. Basically wasted resources conquering a territory he couldn't ever hope to hold.
I look forward to Biden's conquest of Rome
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
Oh yeah, our deputy PM showed up to parliament drunk again
I'd like to point out here that Covid can spread asymptomatically. A positive and infectious case does not always have symptoms
From my countries PoV almost all cases have come in from Europe or America, so why should I blame China when they've actually made an attempt to contain the virus. It's a strange argument that just seeks to remove control or agency over the situation from the west and forgive them for prioritising their corps IMO.
So could have America, however unlike China they didn't.
because the media said America good, China bad
America is the most to blame nation, not because they started it but because they handled it so poorly that they seeded new outbreaks all over the world, this is in spite of their resources and having enough information to actually combat the virus.
Because it's manufacturing consent garbage?
I'm pointing out that the point is dumb, because any country along the chain could have done something to stop this and China has done more than the countries that are actually the largest proliferators.
and no, it's not a direct consequence of China, every nation had the opportunity to do something about it. Western nations bent the knee to their god the economy and let people die.
You say that like the west would have done better
I don't view this as a fair point of view. China didn't fuck up containing the virus nearly as badly as western countries did. As someone from Aus we got like 20 return cases from China and literally thousands from the US. You can't place the blame for failed containment on China when they've done far better than most western countries and the US and UK are actively seeding outbreaks all across the world.
That's because most democrats are corporate payed for stooges
Here's the issue, people in the US have real issues. Extreme student and medical debt, cities with infrastructure that needed to be replaced 20 years ago ect. When they hear politicians talking about Russia why would they give a fuck?
and it's one of the least effective things they've ever done
They never shut up about it
?
Every country does that to every country. I find the US complaining about election interference to be highly ironic personally.
That's a complete dick move
A party that doesn't even get enough vote share to win a seat at any level of government
Minor party
So yeah, not afraid to vote for minors and 3rd parties
I've literally never voted for the party that ended up winning their house seat as my first preference in Aus, the closest I came was when I put Labor in 3rd in the last state election and they somehow won my traditional blue belt seat.
But yeah, a lot of people will sacrifice those things for their own economic interests.
Did I say I'd vote for the PiS? I said I'd find a socialist party I can agree with and vote for them even if I don't think they could win a single seat.
But this is the reality of the situation, an ineffective opposition will lead to this.
I'd vote for whatever socialist party I could find in reality
True, but there's also a good chance that a liberal government would be worse for me economically than PiS regardless
Yeah, and that's really the issue. In that situation I'd be tempted just to take my fucking bribe.
I actually do understand how PiS stays in power though. The opposition is terrible too. You can call what they do bribes, but does the opposition actually offer the people anything better?
The poor should be getting money from everyone else
That's actually good policy broadly speaking <:02shrug:443257729646198784>
Wait
Steal from the poor to give to the rich
I'm curious though <:monalurk:781462115692314664>
Dibs on village idiot
Emineminem
And this man has direct ties to our PM
Pretty fucking disgusting
But two days later he was charged with the most common crime church leaders get charged with
The leader of our PM's church was granted an exemption to go proselytize in South America, which is already pretty "why"
You know how Aus is like, impossible to get in or out of unless you're a citizen coming in or have good reason to leave?
We've had some weird religious BS go on recently too <:sigh:230149462880813056>
It's better to overtax the wealthy and overprovide welfare than to undershoot
Pronounce it zeed to piss everyone off
Yeah, that's equally as undemocratic as Trump winning in a similar way <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiI1AcsJlYU
Been waiting for someone to make this video for so long, because this is exactly what I've been saying for years now
Personally I'd rather spend like, 1k on an e-bike once
You can charge more and get away with it when you have a captive market who have no other option but driving
so I don't actually have access to them
The bigger problem is that I live across the road from the tracks
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I just can't reach it without going through my neighbours garden and over the train tracks
actually, there is a shopping district 300m from me
not actually good design with purpose or anything, just shear coincidence
That's only the case because the most direct path to the shops require crossing the train tracks and there's a foot only level crossing
note that that's an extreme exception in Australia though
not that I ever do drive
It's actually quicker for me to bike to the shops than drive
You're presuming car usage
Mine's about 1km, but that's still shit realistically
And be 2km from where you started
Yeah, they're pretty cursed
and like, as far as outer suburban living goes I'm not in that bad of a place, got a train station 10 minutes away and a bike path less than 5 but there's so much car dependency that the actual road I live on is enough to make this area unsafe for kids.
That alone says a lot
I've literally argued this point with my parents before, they claimed where we lived was a good neighbourhood for raising kids but didn't feel safe letting me go out alone until I was around 10.
you can tell the difference?
Have you ever stopped and thought how much money the USA wastes on building and maintaining highways? Climate change aside, it's a higher amount than most European countries spend per capita building and maintaining their train lines. It's not quite a fair comparison, but like, train lines are actually cheap to build and maintain compared to highway.
Russia managed to make a primarily train based system work and distances in Russia make the USA look small, so big <:Doubt:696037552716775524> on that one
google maps seems to vary between having the Flash run from point A to point B or having a turtle do it
that too
Probably because I use like, four different methods of transport and most people don't use any of them and just drive instead
I measure distance with distance most of the time <a:RyukoConfused:803362664268955749>
but you should be doing those things in a car anyway
It's actually harder to motorcycle in hot weather, like yeah, you have to be careful not to skid and slow way down
also to be fair you can cycle in the snow generally just about as well as you can drive, leathers are warm AF anyway
I'm guessing not NYC then
legit though, get a motorcycle licence, shit's way cheaper
Yeah, that is absurd
Tony Abbott got me into politics well before Trump had ever ran.
Trump actually caused me to entirely reevaluate the way I look at politics, what works and doesn't and estimating who has a political advantage.
A really big issue is that given the choice between Trump and Hillary a lot of people just opted to not participate
Honestly if I was going to pass the buck to anyone in the US over this it'd be the Bushes. They basically created this situation.
*former president of Afghanistan
To be fair though the former president does deserve some of the blame, from everything I've heard that guys a corrupt fuckwit.
One day a politician will actually take responsibility for something.
and also, regardless of anything else, invading Afghanistan is not justice for a terrorist attack carried out by Saudi citizens.
Firstly, "No-one else did the right thing" isn't a good defence, secondly Biden was quite active in pushing democratic support for the war.
I don't blame him at all for the collapse, that was inevitable
Biden deserves some blame for pushing for and supporting the war as a senator
I got interested at around 15 when dickhead first ran
That includes the British firebombing of Berlin.
Intentional killing of civilian targets in any context is disgusting and should never be allowed to be justified
I don't think that's an answer. What you're talking about is creating an existential crisis for others.
You should probably question that
Why is your solution indiscriminate killing of civilians who have nothing to do with this?
One of those things that raises so many questions

What the fuck even is my country?
I, for one, welcome our new overlord
Musk seems like the sort of guy who'd install the three laws of robotics without actually reading Isaac Asimov
They're also the sort of comments that most dumb/horny teens make without thinking twice about
Yeah, old anti-gay propaganda was completely fucked
Yeah, the way it's phrased is somewhat misleading. The eye development was completely intentional and it's being used to experiment on the optical pathway. There was nothing spontaneous about this. Scientists used the chemicals responsible for eye and brain development specifically to create that structure.
Ehhh, I'm always iffy about science media pieces that don't even link their sources properly
~~IDK maybe there was one in between it's been ages since I watched Dr. Who~~
Bad Wolf was underwhelming but at least they learned from it, because the River Song plotline when they tried this next was really good.
So, you can share a lot of overlapping ideals with someone without sharing all their ideals, you can be friends with people who have even diametrically opposed views and people can have similar ideals with drastically different methods to achieve those ideals. 

It makes sense that you'd often agree with someone who's an authoritarian leftist generally. You share a lot of end goals and disagree on methods (in theory at least).
IDK, for me it's just an hour I can spend chilling and doing stuff I'd do at home anyway
Fair
It makes it not even an issue
Personally I try to do things on my commute. IDK if it's an option for you but when I have my 1 hour commute I tend to watch anime during it.

But I don't think that's quite what was meant here
I actually kinda try to avoid using him/her most of the time when I talk with people here because I have a garbage memory and can't always remember, so I use they and name references a lot more
Both doing nothing is better than this
I don't care
Matt, here's the thing
Here's my recommendation, the government should actually step in and offer benefits for being vaccinated and penalties for not being vaccinated. Hand-balling this off to business is not a solution.
we learned nothing
A lot of the exact same issues that were faced during the Spanish Flu are still being faced today
and?
Spanish Flu?
Yeah, it's very much precedented
Plus, do you really want to go down the path of allowing companies access to that information?
A company can't force you to reveal a medical diagnosis. You can just say you are and refuse to verify.
All it takes in one person who is to take them to court and this goes up in flames
Business setting terms of legislation never ends well for the average person
That's not a good reason to be supportive of business stepping in to impose rules however.
but healthcare should
Let me be clear here, I don't think that an opt out of a vaccine should be a right
Rights don't end, if they do they're privileges
all the time
We have precedent of companies pushing the boundaries of what's legal and using that to erode the powers of government and claim more for themselves.
That's an issue
But why should your company be able to erode your co-worker's right to healthcare (and it is a right, fuck the US) because they're refusing to get vaccinated
Because governments giving up even more of their power to corporations is a terrible idea?
And yeah, giving corps the ability to discriminate based off of medical history does set a dangerous precedent
I do actually have an issue with the way this has been done generally. This shouldn't be an area where we hand power off to corporations, it should be a government mandate.
It's also worth noting that while you can claim our solutions are unrealistic, you also have no actual power over what you're proposing either. Realistically we're all just as powerless here and discussing hypotheticals. What Delta's trying to do here could very easily be struck down in a court and if it is you'd have even less ability to influence that than we would to influence government.
Corporations having more power will cause millions of deaths
My actual solution is to try to force the government into action
It's preferable to giving over health information to corperations
We're basing that assumption off of corporate abuses of the past
It also sets the precedent for corporations to push for further reasons to remove healthcare from people that you'd find less agreeable.
and corps do?
When have they ever?
Pretending corps are going to make things better is even more deluded
That's the solution
Don't give corporations that power
Do you think a corp cares?
You realise corps are going to use the precedent set by this to not hire anyone with any preexisting condition that could impact their finances right?
That's not really the point I was making. This is beyond any of our control. Arguably the most effective thing we can do about this is to lobby politicians.
What are you actually doing right now?
Matt, to push you a little here
but like, just try to keep in mind where we're coming from
That's fine
If you want to disagree then disagree
We just view the pathway that Delta's proposing as far too dangerous to pursue
ever
Matt, none of us are suggesting we want more deaths
I see this as a near certainty
I think the difference is what we rate the chances as
I do not want to condemn anyone to death.
My solution has always been the direction that causes the least deaths. You could, if you wanted to scroll back about a year and find me discussing why I think super hard lockdowns were the best option.
Fair enough though
Huh, I thought it was more direct
Wasn't there a full on civil war after Mohomid's death?
The not PR version of the Taliban is still better than IS
Also enjoying this graph of the Liberal party dying in WA
(The last 3 dots should be, from left to right 56.5, 59.5 and 60%)
That's hilarious
Holy hell, the Lib's are getting so fucked in my state's polls RN that the graph ran out of space to show Labor's lead
plus we don't let dogs roam freely anyway
Based on studies I've seen even small cats are completely capable of decimating wildlife when they're allowed to roam freely.
Dumbass culture of letting cats roam and kill wildlife needs to end
I'm legit of the opinion that any cat that's outside should be picked up and taken to the pound
~~It's OK, in communist Australia we have food but not toilet paper~~

Meanwhile Australia told GM to fuck off
They look like they've come from Monsters Inc.
and trolls also don't always make a space controversial. Like, I could go and hard troll in live shitposting all afternoon and no-one would give a fuck most likely
yeah, that's true
So debate without strict regulation is almost destined to devolve
and that's an inherent psychological part of being human
The issue is that people are very bad at separating having their ideas attacked and being attacked.
I often just left and took a walk and most of my friends were used to me doing it
I literally used to do that actually
I misread that I think
Oh, I see
One can troll without being hostile and vies versa
I don't know if I'd define trolling simply as hostility
It's to do with how well the character resonates with me most of the time
Ehhh, it's not really that
There's some anime that have messed me up after a single episode with a character death and other that have went 70 and I just didn't care
and people form the attachments needed for it to impact them in different ways and at different paces
That's completely normal, character death impacts different people differently

Man, I could write an essay about the problematic nature of Monogatari and that's my favourite series
Only the second part of what I said even tangentially applies to your comment. It's expressing a worldview which is in conflict to Carol's, but that doesn't make it moralising.
yeah
Also that
It's probably impossible to talk about something that some people view as child pornography without a conversation getting heated honestly. The actual solution here though is to understand that people are arguing in good faith and just have a different worldview to you, and also understand that not everything that conflicts your worldview is a moralising crusade.
People should be able to express their discomfort about any form of media
Nobody took that position
For the record I ideologically agree with you, but what you did there still wasn't called for
You realise we were just telling you to chill and not attack people for being uncomfortable with something you like right?
but it's mostly just a mistake
I think it's a map or something
The idea already needs you to ignore everything else about MLK other than his participation in the Civil Rights movement to make sense. MLK would almost certainly not have wanted a large corporation to use his likeness for profit considering his other political leanings.
The idea of having an MLK event for capitalist gain has already run off the rails honestly
This is why it's stupid to call an election early during a pandemic
Probably a good idea to still keep some control over that
I mean, the choices are that or the UK/Israel situation where in spite of very high vaccination numbers the virus still manages to get out of control and kill dozens or hundreds daily.
Probably not
>Moderna‚Äôs vaccine was associated with a two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to Pfizer‚Äôs in a review of people in the Mayo Clinic Health System in the U.S. from January to July.

Anyone got the "don't let yourself be bullied into thinking" meme
I have my doubts about the factuallity still
OK, that makes more sense then
This feels like an odd appeal
The big problem here is that the thing that's causing organisms to become is the exact same thing that's causing them to become smaller, selective pressure. Thinking of evolution in terms of trends is kinda iffy as hell in the first place anyway.
The general trend before selective pressure is completely random, the only thing that makes an organism grow or shrink over a long timeframe is the selective pressure. If an organism is below the optimal body size for its niche and environment it's likely to grow and if it's above it's likely to shrink. If both carry no advantage then it's actually fairly random whether they'll grow or shrink over time unless there's some other pressure like sexual selection working on them.
Saying it's a general trend is utterly incorrect, it's a trend amongst certain species.
Not really
Even amongst human lineages we have an example where selective pressures favoured smaller body sizes, Homo floresiensis
All growth and shrinking amongst species is determined by biological pressures, some niches are very open to large animals and tend to make animals in those niches trend towards a biological maximum, yes. Large grazers would be an example of one of these. Some niches directly favour smaller body sizes however. Generalist omnivore animals like rodents tend to actually become smaller over time. There's also a whole thing about the availability of food and pressure from predators that interacts with this. Biological size is really complex.
Pygmy Elephants do exist, just as one example
There's several species for which biological pressure causes them to reduce in size
Uhhh, no
Joyce is just a moron

In his case it's a combination of corruption and stupidity
The issue with escalation is that it breeds more escalation and that's a path than most teachers want to avoid, so if you're the one escalating they're going to target you to stop it. If they're decent at handling the situation they'll use restorative justice, but if not you're going to be the one that gets punished.
Define stand up for themselves, because quite often what people are punished for is escalation. I don't agree with this and generally think it's a headass way to go about dealing with the problem, but a lot of people misrepresent the situation to paint themselves as a more pure victim than they really are.
It is unfortunate that many schools use this as an excuse to just do nothing, but we do have more effective methods to deal with bullying than simple punishment.
Speaking as a teacher, this is actually incorrect. It's pretty well established that punishing bullies actually tends to make bullying worse since bullies often blame the punishment on the person they were bullying.
The picture's still funny as hell though
even a fucking plaque works
The majority of the monuments (although it would seem not this one) were also built many years after the deaths of every person who lived through the civil war during the Jim Crow era as an intimidation tactic
yes
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I just can't
In the comments
If you want a memory of what not to do replace it with a monument to the slaves he abused
Na, statues exist purely to glorify the person or event they capture
Which is good
People have been getting more and more pissed off with his crap recently
Morrison's been getting sledged in Australia, according to polling an election now would see at least 25 seats swing to Labor sweeping them into a strong majority
Yeah, one of the worst things a person can be is a hypocrite. Very few other things get my blood boiling in quite the same way as blatant hypocrisy.
I can't stand when leaders just decide against following rules
Scott Morrison deciding to cross borders during a lockdown for Father's Day made me incredibly fucking angry.

Man, I just want to stop living in a fucking dystopia

Also, anti-NATO, in both their case and mine involves replacing NATO with something that's less archaic and less pro-US.

And if you think that's the reason why the SPD won't negotiate with them, it's not really. That's the stance most parties put up towards other parties that threaten their voter base. When push comes to shove there's a fairly decent chance that if they were forced into it they would actually work with die Linke.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I am also anti-NATO
Most socialists want to reduce ties with overtly capitalist organisations led by the US
As do most socialists?
Sure, socialists are the same as fascists
Yeah, the only coalitions that seem remotely close to viable right now are CDU, SPD, Green and maybe if they slightly over-perform SPD, Green, Left
They're the "weren't the 1940's just swell" party
Unless SPD really keeps surging in which case they might get away with one other
Anyway, it's not like any party's getting a majority in Germany. It's looking like it will be fractured enough that the top 3 parties would be needed for a coalition
Russia probably isn't going to be a deciding issue for most people
Sorry to break it to you but a lot of people care about a lot more issues than just that, and, to quote Obama the Cold War is over
So, the only issue you really care about is Russia
Workers rights are insanely important in any country and you should have enough empathy to give a fuck about them regardless of if they're within your borders or not
The SPD is far better when it comes to workplace relations and workers rights
nor even really that big of one
Russia isn't the only issue
On the bright side, everywhere else seems to be getting notably more sane
yeah, that's fair enough
Also keep in mind that your parents may know more than you and may already be dealing with it themselves. The suggestion is probably fine but I wouldn't push it or anything.
at least most of the time
From my personal perspective it really helps to stay calm as much as possible when dealing with children and teenagers.
tomorrow
I know some people who are though and they're often working hard with 2-3 kids at a time checking in multiple times a day and making calls to so many support agencies every day. It's pretty insane some of the stuff they do.
School avoidance is a tough issue, I'm certainly not qualified to deal with it
Yeah, I'm just looking at this from the perspective of someone who's actually seen the way this is handled. You really can't brute force anything here
I don't think NY is the worst when it comes to handling school avoidance either, so that's probably good. The issue is that some states use religious chaplains who often aren't actually trained to deal with the situation. Normally you actually want a background in psyc since school avoidance is often a symptom of other issues.
I'd wait for now
Oh, if you don't mind me asking where do you live? Because some areas handle this a lot better than others.
You probably need to work out what's going on with your parents first and I'm not sure I can really help you as much with that one
I wouldn't advise doing this alone however
What you and your parents need to do is get more information generally. The school has somebody for you to talk to about this, you need to call into the school office, explain what's happening and ask for a referral to them.
Are you at the same school as her?
yeah, at least here every school has one
I think the first step would be to communicate with whatever school psychologist or guidance officer you can get in contact with and try to work out what needs to be done with them. They're generally pretty experienced with school refusal.
That's a really bad idea, I'm not sure what the correct answer is but I'm 100% sure that in particular wouldn't work
I'm more conflicted about a more general confederate memorial personally. I don't know whether it would be appropriate to take down when at least some of those people were most likely conscripted and didn't believe in the cause, maybe these would be the cases where moving to a museum to ensure they have proper context really would be the right move. Having said that, most confederate monuments aren't that so they should just be removed.
And honestly, even in that case I prefer monuments like the tomb of the unknown soldier which more accurately portray war as not between "great men" but as between common soldiers and are far more sombre than statues, which I feel is a far more appropriate tone than the glorification that statutes tend towards building.
and in Lee's case, no, it wasn't
It's important to ask if the cause they're fighting for was even remotely just
Good generals don't inherently deserve statues, the Nazis probably had a few good generals who were great strategists and knew how to fight a war, that does not however make them at all deserving of statues. They were morally repugnant and that alone is enough to justify never building a statue of them.
The only way to win a guerrilla war is to stop

Probably Epic
TBH the workaround that devs will use is free games with a purchase in game until Apple drops their rates
Or at least being forced to allow the installation of stores that don't do so on non cracked devices I think.
yes, I'm 100% sure that Apple not taking a 30% middle man tax on every sale on their app store is in both consumers and small devs best interest
not seeing how the consumer lost?
Both Apple and Epic both wasted a metric fuckton of money and ended up making the service slightly more consumer friendly
I literally give 0 fucks about corporations being defamed
Corporations going to war with each other is popcorn time
I'm in favour of whatever works
I'm not
Apple has to allow other methods of payments that can circumvent their 30% cut
Yes, Epic had to pay them out, but they got what they wanted
They still did a hell of a lot of damage to Apple
I really don't give a damn if they were childish or immature
<:SagiriBleh:341060865547829248>
I actually think Apple continuing to exert control over products they've already sold is completely repugnant personally. Once you've bought something it should be yours to do whatever the hell you want with it, so yeah, kinda more on the side of Epic here if anything. Apple shouldn't be allowed to monopolise software distribution.
I don't know about Apple being entirely in the right, their "walled garden" is still up in the air but it's starting to collapse, which is fantastic.
Some unions are anticapitalist
<:heh:789431887135113241>
only one of those descriptions is ever true
Acting like this impacts fewer people than the apple store is pretty incorrect I'd say
Because in reality a good union will have a bigger overall effect on almost anyone than a 30% surcharge that Apple places on apps
I'd actually argue that what you need to throw more effort into is convincing people that the death of unions does impact them
both can be true and caused by fundamentally the same issue. Corporations like to exploit on both ends, we need both better consumer and worker protections
or otherwise using economics to control resources or labour in another country

It is important to note that the same rural north that voted for Brexit and I'm assuming would be more likely to support this strategy has been a Labour stronghold for years and the more affluent south is much more pro Tory. The issue isn't simple.

There was also relatively little support for the arrangement where the former Afghan government lead a decaying nation and the permanent US occupation just slowed the advance of the Talibahn in either nation

That's actually an act of war

Cuba didn't sanction the US
but if that fails there's very limited options
Pretty much all any other country can do is demand they be extradited and tried on war crimes
The UN is completely unable to act against the US, UK, China, Russia or France by design
You mean the US puppet?
Number one reason is health care IMO, but the whole mentality of "stop who we don't like at all costs" feeds heavily into police violence
yeah, that's fair
I also remember Merkel getting very pissed off when they struck a German citizen
there have been examples of the US striking US citizens in the middle east
The US has pretty much no respect for international law
But far too many think that children should be taught the way they were despite all the evidence pointing to those methods being absolutely terrible.
It's because teaching as a profession has moved on with evidence. The 1970's borderline abusive teaching methods are no longer viewed as valid by anyone in the profession.
I don't even agree with that, keeping your cool and holding your head together even on a bad day is part of being a teacher. And there's a difference between feigning anger to get students to do something (which I think is a shit strategy anyway) and this. He got angry enough to use slurs towards his students. He can't keep his head under pressure and if this happened once it will happen again.
I've already had to deal with some little shits, but that reaction is like, the least helpful thing ever
If students can make you angry enough that you can't control what you say you probably shouldn't be a teacher <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>

Maybe BQ would, but I honestly doubt that too
And there's no way the NDP are voting down a Liberal minority gov they have a hefty amount of influence over
He doesn't actually need to build a coalition, he just needs to declare a minority government and not have either the NDP or Bloc vote it down

<@!379337518371307522> About what you were saying in liveshitposting (I'm going to post it here because it's more appropriate) different people have different tolerance for nsfw content. Some people like me are 100% fine about basically talking about things of a sexual nature as long as you don't go into actual picture, but not everyone agrees with this. I don't see an issue with someone with a lower tolerance for nsfw questioning the way a server's run, because ultimately where we draw this line is pretty arbitrary.  And it's fine for you to set your server's tolerance higher/lower (within reason), but I don't think it's great to poke fun at someone who views nsfw more strictly.
Remember that time the auto industry invented jaywalking <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>

I think the complete lack of regulation around social media is a huge issue
I actually completely disagree with preferencing deplatforming to legislation. I think the main thing we need to stop is outright falsehoods spreading on social media and this is where government definitely has a role to step in and tell social media companies what they need to do to be compliant with law.
no, because that's completely disproportional even if you think the behaviour should be punished
Also, the existence of cod pieces is a pretty good argument that if more females wore armour it would have existed
The way how it works here is that an independent board is set up with 4 government, 3 opposition and 2 independent politicians, generally ends up being a green and and independent.
Other countries also regulate your media you realise?
There's standards for how much of the world regulates media, typically it involves the creation of an independent body and in most countries politics is less partisan than in the US.
That's how Facebook has become a complete mess of antivax/conspiracy BS
The alternative is that you just create polarised platforms, because deplatforming really doesn't work
Doing nothing at all can help for some people
And we had multiple cases of outdoor spread early on in this outbreak
Why wouldn't they be mandated in open spaces? It's not like there's really any downside to just wearing a mask and it helps to reduce spread.
Yeah, for sure. Not going to fully defend the police here but the idea being pressed in the tweet that those people are pure victims is absurd
closed parks and other public spaces is part of how we reached 0 in the first place
remember Australia had near 0 cases for most of the year and case numbers of the most recent wave are seemingly on the decline again, most of these restrictions weren't in place the whole time
To lay this out right now, in many states across Australia masks are currently mandated, being out without one is against the law and will result in a fine. In Melbourne even stopping to sit on that bench was illegal (not sure if it still is) due to park closures. These measures are broadly viewed as preferable to what has happened across the world and have allowed Australia to keep a very low covid death total. People in Melbourne especially are currently absolutely furious with foreign intervention in our politics because of the way how Americans are reacting to and egging on protests within Melbourne that have next to 0 domestic support too. That's the context behind this.
And no, Aus doesn't need to calm down, we need fewer Americans who have 0 idea of the state of the nation commenting on our politics <:LuL:789259461470322728>

<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Maybe people should just read the labels on what they're buying
You pay a toll when you drive into city boundries
London does it
There's very good reasons to want to dissuade people from driving through them
Normal roads in city centres should be tolled
As long as the state doesnt pay for construction or subsidise them in any way
I consider state funded highways to be a complete waste of money, so yeah, let a corp handle them
Oddly enough
I don't actually have an issue with that at all
Only thing you're allowed to tax fund in America are shitty 6 lane roads
Turns out having people not starve while they study is also a benifit
If private education exists people will always use it as an excuse to attempt to undermine public education
*doesn't even think private education should exist
I'm actually quite a fan of the northern European/German model of "just tax fund it and it'll pay itself off"
Literally incoherent
People make the same argument here dispite the fact that university used to be free in Australia
It's still very clearly designed to perpetuate generational wealth, even if it lacks the same life ruining consequences of the US system. The gold standard system for higher education is Germany IMO.
To be fair, I even consider Aus's system kinda fucked
There's a minimum earning threshold before you have to repay it and no interest
True, we have HECs debt here but it's nowhere near as bad as US student loans
Declare bankruptcy and have an alternate way out of the loan. I don't know all the details or consequences on it but I know you can do so for most other loans. It's still not a good option but not having it there for student loans so they can follow you through bankruptcy is just an extra fuck you.
yes, and you can't default on it like almost any other loan
Aren't the Rep's threatening to not raise the debt ceiling or some bullshit?
Diesel was on its way out already
Yeah, car manufacturers don't care about what cities in Italy legislate
If advise you against it, procedualism is how people stop fighting for good ideas
The same argument can be levelled against limiting what kinds of cars can be driven in cities anyway
I'm arguing what the best thing to do is, not the easiest
Cypher, I've said this before, stop always arguing procedualism
And it did cut car usage in the city significantly
It's about 12 pounds to drive in London I believe
If it's not high enough you set your price too low
Ok, if they do that then you just raised money for public transport works
It worked here mate
Cars take up dozens of times the space public transport does.
Roads?
Parking garages?
You're actually arguing space?
Space
After you open up tolls within the city traffic drops and you just close the least used roads, convert them to walking/cycling routes, tram or bus ways
See, that's really easy
Car traffic is only a thing where it's not been effectively controlled
Which is why tolls are highly effective
I want to reduce the number of all cars on inner city roads
And your putting a lot of faith in enforcement not to be incompetent
Plus, the issue with that solution is that it assumes I'm ok with electric cars clogging up the road
If I drive through the city in an econ petrol car there's a very good chance no one would be able to tell it apart
But tolls don't work? How the fuck is that enforceable?
It's unknown, you're probably worrying about this more than you should
are you vaccinated, if so and you're wearing a mask you're at very low risk
or sanitise, if where you live is anything like Aus there's sanitiser everywhere
just wash hands if possible
Soap is highly effective at destroying viruses on surfaces
As long as you're wearing the mask and trying not to touch it you're not in any severely elevated risk
Yes, the risk is you taking off your mask and transferring virus from skin to mouth/nose
Masks are actually far more effective if the infected person is the one wearing them
My advice would be if someone actually coughs on you take a shower when you get home. You can't get infected unless the virus gets into your respiratory tract but you can touch the back of your head and transfer it. The holes are meant to be there, they're positive pressure exhausts, your breathing ensures that air only flows outwards through them.
Based on the way they were talking they won't
Calmed down a little, but fuck, people with such a giant lack of empathy confuse the hell out of me. Like I actually cannot understand their point of view.
Fuck, I need to vent a little. Just doing my usual shit talking to absolute idiots online and for the first time ever something one of them said actually got to me. One of the free market libertarian types trying to downplay the role of addiction in cigarettes basically saying the whole "people don't keep smoking unless they want to" thing.

I'm just sitting here crying because I almost lost my uncle to cigarettes after he spent 10-15 years trying to quit and failing at every corner until they put him in hospital for months. Just, fuck, I really can't process this right now.
Apparently Stockholm charges ~13 Euro to drive in the city centre too, so it's not just London doing this
Bicycles (electric and standard) and public transport are still orders of magnitude more environmentally sustainable than electric cars
It's also worth noting that electric cars aren't really environmentally sound, they're just a preferable alternative to ICE cars
Converting the majority of parking in cities into residential or commercial use and converting roads into cycling and walking areas (some with trams) is just a far more efficient use of limited space within a city centre
I actually think just as big of an issue is space usage within cities
I guess unless you only view this through the lens of an emmisions problem, which I'd very heavily disagree with
But that has nothing to do with whether we ought to toll city roads to reduce car usage in cities
The thing thats actually changing car manufacturers production is legislation on electrics
Financial Review has always been a joke but that's next level stupid

The shower will not do anything if you're already infected
If the virus is on your skin it will remove the viral particles. That's all.
Yeah, that's objectively false. Most robberies target the suburbs. You're far less likely to be noticed there than in a city and average wealth is higher.
They're not Liberals by any definition

That's a bad look
So, the second most important Liberal in Australia just resigned in the face of a corruption inquiry.

Since you're likely to readjust your mask and wearing your mask like that creates a line of viral particles across the top of the mask it pretty much just guarantees that you'll get the virus on your hands

Basically guns, indeed do kill people and that tautology is BS.
There's also the point of how much rarer these events are in countries like Norway per capita than across the US. We probably can't ever completely stop them but gun control is highly effective at reducing the incidence.
Had that have been a gun it's quite likely that the attack would have been far more deadly. There's even an example of this in the article you linked. It's obviously not good that people can use bows to do this, but it's still vastly preferable to fire arms.
Yes
Yeah, it's kinda a given that a Tory's actual voting record is going to be pretty garbage but that still doesn't remotely justify the act
The offensive thing is standing by a party like the Tories. Regardless of whatever decent policy he suggested/passed he's still a Tory, which means he's stood in the way of needed change to things like the tax code and equal rights.

It's this weird, dumbass idea that removal of bias requires absolute neutrality on all issues. It's mostly a thing right wingers do to try to play on liberals sense of even-handedness. Of course, it breaks down under any scrutiny because the idea that you should treat holocaust history and holocaust denialism equally (or in the most common version of this climate change science vs climate change denialism) is incredibly biased in and of itself. Viewpoints backed up by academic study are inherently more valuable than conspiracy wank.

It's introducing unneeded risk even if it's meant to be unloaded

Not really though. If the results are totally biased it's actually almost always a sign of selection bias. Also, the results actually aren't totally biased. It's 56/44, which means your error bars on an 80 person sample are going to be gigantic even if you assume it's an unbiased scientific poll, which it's not.

Nancy Kelley likened not wanting to date trans people to not wanting to date people of colour, fat people, or disabled people.

She said: "Sexuality is personal and something which is unique to each of us. There is no 'right' way to be a lesbian, and only we can know who we're attracted to.

"Nobody should ever be pressured into dating, or pressured into dating people they aren't attracted to. But if you find that when dating, you are writing off entire groups of people, like people of colour, fat people, disabled people or trans people, then it's worth considering how societal prejudices may have shaped your attractions.
There's like, one woman in this entire article who seems like she may have had a decent take on this before the BBC picked her argument apart for their own ends
journalistic integrity is optional and such
I'm not surprised that they didn't check any of their sources at all
What if we just funded a strong child benefit program from general tax revenue to reduce the strain on people who are realistically not able to pay it?
But yeah, the fundamental point here is that while people like Snowden/Manning etc. might have issues with the specifics of how Assange has acted they still just generally view this as a huge issue of the US attempting to supress legit journalism.
That's still legal
Yes, it's also to do with the fact that there's legitimate doubts about his safety within the US prison system
You realise that's the reason it hasn't happened yet right?
I mean, there's a legal basis for not extraditing too
It can, but given the way how the US tries whistle blowers it shouldn't be allowed to
I mean, he's being extradited through the legal system, so it is very much about if he broke the law
He can be as much of a cunt as he likes, the question is if he broke the law
This is a legal case
Assange's character isn't actually important
I mean, you can both disagree with the way something's ran administratively and also think that someone shouldn't be jailed for it
Plus about 1 mil retweets of other orgs and individuals speaking up for Assange
But uh, yeah, this is Snowden tweeting on the matter
https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1453245073789968387
Yeah, I really don't agree. Like, at all. The US is pursuing him based off of WikiLeaks revealing state secrets that embarrassed them, this is why all admins continue to seek his extradition, Obama, Trump and Biden.

The case for national laws has mostly been dropped against him. The only thing they ever got him on was skipping bail, which is already questionably just but he's served the time either way.

Finally to the Russia point, just no. He's basically used every possible source. One of those is Russia and that's not an issue. Yes, he likely received information about Clinton's corruption from Russia. The largest issue here is that Clinton was corrupt. Dems love this whole "cry Russia" thing, but it's just fucking old.

I very much believe this to be a question of journalistic importance. And the thing is, the others you cited there, Manning and Snowden completely agree with me, as do other important figures in this space like Greenwald. Manning's even risked jail multiple times to protect him. Maybe you should listen to what the other journalists you cited are saying rather than the Democratic party.
And yes, the IFJ is fairly trustworthy overall
There's just more outcry for Assange because he's in more immediate danger
Snowden also has a lot of support?

There's a big difference between a definition based on evidence and one based on nothing of the sort.
Again, I disagree, there's no evidence that these people are not Christian or are just pretending to be Christian. They are often amongst the most devout in terms of things like time investment, which are the only things we can actually measure. It's probably very reassuring for moderates to pretend they're not real Christians, but that doesn't seem to be what reality suggests.
Science is a method for establishing truth, it really doesn't care for unfalsifiable claims like those made by religion. There's a very clear gap between what science is and what religion is. Scientists do not treat science as God.
no, not remotely
I'm always iffy about saying people aren't actual Christians, the predominant practice is Christianity, not what they claim, how they act. The money obsessed conservative may be completely against Christian teaching, but they are dominant enough within the religion that arguing they're not actual Christian seems strange to me. This is very much one of the faces of Christianity in all its hypocritical glory.
That's a giant ethical question in general. I'm not totally against it if I'm honest. I think in cases where a debilitating genetic disorder is likely then it's fine. And when I say this I mean the sort of 6 years of torture>death disorders.
Bad example, the main proponents for conversion therapy tend to be overwhelmingly Christian.
but I'd argue that that's a very basic lens
that doing less harm is a good thing
That obviously is filtered through a moral lens
It can be in some cases. A belief structure that I try to adopt is to generally do things that studies show to do the least harm to the least people.
I think that implies that most irreligious people must source their justifications elsewhere
Yeah, all I ever said is that most atheists and agnostics do not use their lack of belief as a justification for their political beliefs and many Christians do.
correct
Did I ever argue they didn't?
I'm well aware Cypher, the point I'm making is that certainly some Christians do this and it's very hard to utilise a lack of belief in the same way. Because you can only appeal to an irreligious person on political ideology or the state of the world.
I'm not, I know there's also Christians who don't do this
It's very hard to use a lack of religion to justify anything
And yes, people use "secularism" to justify all sorts of BS, but secularism is a political stance, not a religious idea
Secularism is a fundamentally different idea to irreligion. Saying secularism is threatened by a minority is really fucking dumb, but it's also not actually using your religion as a basis for policy, at least not directly. 

Even the idea that Islam is going to come in and wreck secularism (whatever the fuck that even means) is based on the world, not doctrine. It's a very us vs. them, mobish mentality that I don't like but it's not the same as what most Christians do when they base beliefs of doctrine.

It has similar end consequences but a different genesis of the belief. It's kinda hard to explain what I mean, but basically people saying "I don't believe and therefore I have to have this policy" is very rare. Many Christians will use bible verses and points from the religion to justify their own beliefs or to form their beliefs.
and I think there's a pretty clear difference here between atheists and Christians because I almost never hear atheists or agnostics use their lack of belief as justification for their political views in the same way Christians do, and that's cutting either way because a lot of progressive Christians still use their beliefs to justify their politics.
The philosophy clearly causes some people to adopt highly conservative views or at least interacts with these views even if it does not for you personally.
I mean both
Also, that you can't deny conservative Christians as "real Christians" or argue they're somehow not when they are so predominant in the religion. This does not exclude more progressive Christians either.
Pretty much honestly, just the idea that you can't separate ideology from practice fully.
Can you link the message?
It's not, but many Christians twist it to fit in with more secular science
Does it though, or is that just the limit of human knowledge currently? 50 years ago the wall would have been genetics and strong understanding of quantum events. We've overcome most of that wall at this point.

Also, still no. Science and God are fundamentally different things. Science does not claim knowledge outside of the observed. When science hasn't answered a question the answer is "we don't know". We don't try to insert our own answer into it. This is fundamental to modern science. We may have theories or interpretations of what we see, but we also admit that they are almost certainly incorrect or at least lacking data. Physicists hate the Copenhagen interpretation, as an example.

We also see a vast gap in the way religion and science react to and incorporate new data. Science updates and reviews old theories in the face of new data. Even something as core to science as Newtonian gravity can be proved wrong. Religion retreats or denies. Either everything in the bible shifts from literal fact (how most Christians viewed the bible not very long ago) to a story or the scientific fact is outright denied. Genesis is only a recreation of the big bang if you contort the hell out of it. If you read it straight it is most certainly not. If you contort the meaning of Yellow Submarine enough it's also a retelling of the big bang. You can twist and contort anything into anything.
That are strongly corelated, but certainly not 100%
Or like, you can do most scientists do and divide biological sex and sociological gender into two different things
About 1/50 people don't align to that at all
XY and XX is a huge oversimplification
Do you want to talk about how absurdly complex biological sex is?
which is why I think the teaching of the scientific method is so important
See, here's the difference which is important. If you do science properly and don't cherry pick it's not a matter of approach.
Also I think the other difference is that while you're scared of people using science to justify bad beliefs, I'm far more scared of people using vague morality or religion to do so. I think that the more you understand science, especially biology and psychology the harder it becomes to hold really shitty beliefs. It would also take a tectonic reversal in the direction of science to start using scientific consensus to justify anti-trans/anti gay etc. beliefs whereas it would take a tectonic reversal in religious beliefs to not do that, so I really do think this is still a vastly preferable viewpoint. It's fine if you disagree, but this is something I really have thought a lot about and I doubt my position on it is likely to change.
it's a fiat
but like
I think the point where a capitalist with a similar structure would disagree is that economic harm isn't actual harm
I got to this position using this form of logic. Not everyone will, but I sure as hell did.
And when I talk about damage to society I specifically mean doing something that can cause direct harm to another person. I believe that economic harm is not actual harm as long as it does not impact your ability to live and that a fair, redistributive system will avoid doing harm to the vast majority.
Here's the thing, let's base those programs off of a more scientific method. We should look at the disadvantage that disabled people face in terms of what support they need based on their specific disability and how much this impacts their ability to exist within the economy and use those numbers as our basis for their benefits, does that sound better or worse than what we have now? Because that's the direction that my thinking takes me in.
I agree to an extent, you run into issues when those decisions start to have huge impacts on society, as an example vaccinations.
We don't live in that reality right now and I don't know what the answer to that question would be. But like, I also don't see using things like morals or religion as better options considering I've seen what people do based off of both. At least science gives us some grounded framework we can agree on.
I think to an extent people should be allowed to make unwise decisions, but we also need to consider when those decisions have an impact on society. Decisions like drunk driving as an example, is an unwise decision that we should never let anyone make. Trans/plural/gay issues as far as I'm concerned are mostly self contained. The only person those (decisions was the wrong word but I can't think of the right one, sorry) can have a large impact on is yourself. So we shouldn't ever do things that are against your will in this case. I personally believe that studies will always continue to show that to force change on anyone will usually have huge negative effects.
They're also all things that can be studied scientifically. If we found that conversion therapy causes greatly increased incidences of psychological harm as an example, we could maybe use that discovery as a basis of a belief.
Is that a naturalistic problem? If the answer's no then it's outside the realms of science.
The point I'm making, and the one I started with is that I do not believe that science and religion are equal beliefs. I think science does a lot better. It's substantially better when it comes to describing the world. It forms better belief systems on average as well.
True, but that's not what statistics are
Which group is statically more likely to want you dead? The thing here is that when atheists actually use science or human dignity to formulate ideas they quite often come to better ideas than religious orgs do.
Here's the thing though, I still think basing your ideas on a flawed understanding of a science which continually improves itself is better than doing so on static religion which almost always holds outdated and archaic beliefs.

Most people just mock this idea now
I diagnose you with subconscious attraction to mother <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Welcome to Freud
Sounds like a good thing at least
basically results in a small degree of Lamarckian inheritance
tends to lead to small, short term changes, like if a mother suffers from malnutrition it tends towards making their child slightly smaller
So yeah, the actual name is inheritable epigenetic traits
This is why I'm trying to teach biology <:ElsaChef:689035502673985622>
Lamarckian inheritance only came back as a quirk of genetics 200 years later by shear coincidence, no-one was actually looking for it.
The scientific community just tends to move on past that when theories become disproven. And we don't beat dead horses.
But like, the point is there was actually a point in history where Lamarck was talked about a lot
*I don't think it's actually called that anymore though
Lamarckian inheritance ironically does actually exist, it's just like less than 1% of total inheritance. So that's something I guess.
It's a view that comes from other fields, where someone like Lamarck isn't really viewed as worth talking about because he's just not right, even if his ideas were somewhat influential for a time they were thrown out.
Yeah, because psychologists make it so
Also, to be clear this isn't to say everything in social sciences is science. Psychologists should probably talk a lot less about Freud. He's not really worth more than a footnote. When you start talking about theory without evidence as he loved to you're no longer practicing science. When you do what modern psychologists do and perform population analysis and studies with controlled variables you're fine regardless of whatever you're studying.
Religion may not be science, but there's a science of religion.
I think I might have a slightly different understanding of what science is than you do. To me science isn't a body of knowledge in a specific field. It's a method. You can use that method to study literally anything.
So that would include the social sciences and about 5 economists
I don't care what it studies
I count anything that uses the scientific method as science
Conservative Christians are still real Christians <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
he was just also completely insane
Na, Brahe was a legit astronomer
He can just be summed up with the statement "his pet moose died by falling down stairs while drunk at a party"
Hey, if you think Freud was insane there's always Tycho Brahe
You have to assume that whatever you post online will always be read in a neutral tone, which means that extreme directness can actually come off as condescension
I think this is a case of different people thinking different things are relevant to your point than you do
If the west actually wants China to start cutting back emissions IMO we need to put our money where our mouth is and start manufacturing again using green tech, regardless of how expensive it is. We need to make green options that are competitive with China even if that requires insane amounts of governmental support. Basically stop trying to free market your way out of the problem, because it created and perpetuates it.
Maybe some of the rest of the world should like, also share some of the burden of actually manufacturing then. It's really easy to blame China and India here, but the rest of the world, including Europe have shifted the entire burden of manufacturing onto them. This is just one example of how China is actually doing a lot more than what most people give them credit for.
I know you can use an electrical arc furnace, but like, most isn't made that way at current
Yeah, I was just pointing out that coal is actually used in products
And yeah, I broadly agree, but there's still a lot of nuance here with regards to who actually holds responsibility for China's/India's emissions and I think the west is a lot more responsible than any of the chucklefuck polis at Glasgow would ever admit.
what do you think steel is?
Coal is used in products
There's somewhat of a point there. It is kinda problematic for the rest of the world to shift all our manufacturing off to them then blame them for the emissions they're generating and we're profiting from.
There's a huge amount of issues with hunting for sport. Sustenance hunting is much less problematic.
If I remember correctly you said she was outright refusing school before, going to school but not doing homework is a huge improvement. Sometimes you just need to take things a bit slow.

Also, if things there are anything like here she won't fail because of that. Teachers tend not to like using failure as a blunt tool for students with other issues and actually adapt the school plan for students with a history of school avoidance etc.
Yeah, just lay them down next to your bowl
There's also the whole issue of how the plastics industry spent billions lobbying and astroturfed an entire recycling campaign to ensure that governments didn't regulate the plastics industry properly too.
Kinda is. If they literally can't afford waste collection how the hell are they going to pay to have waste collected? Wealth distribution leads to a lot of environmental issues.
Personally I'd just tell them I'm not interested in partaking in that sort of thing and that they can find out themselves
Does it actually matter to you for any real reason? Personally I'd just avoid this unless I had a very specific reason to do so.
Yeah, sending the message that nothing's wrong really doesn't help. It shouldn't even be up to the performer, it should be on the stage crew to notice something's wrong and cut the equipment.
Oh, it is just generalised, 10k seems a little high still, but it's a good start I guess
~~also just ban them cowards~~
I mean, one of the main uses for Crypto has always been tax evasion, so I hope they just expand this out generally
like, way less
that's gotta be way less than 1/10 who claim it
Imagine your default assumption being that someone else is faking trauma
yeah, asking someone to prove shit like this is super dickish
<:DumbFuckJuice:839012604851650580>
Uhhh, I think I misread the situation
at all
I don't accept the equivalence in your argument
The thing about crypto is it's just doing something we can already do worse
That's not an argument against my point at all
Yes, and?
but they're better than crypto
I don't think banks are the ideal way to deal with this either
It's not though, a boardgame can't do everything a PC can. A classical bank transaction can do everything a crypto can.
~~cars~~
When we have an objectively better way to do something we shouldn't invent more wasteful alternatives.
No, the two are not comparable. There's no other alternative to running a game on your PC with lower energy draw and the energy draw is still far lower than a single crypto transaction. We could replace every crypto transaction with traditional currency and the only changes would be less tax evasion and less power draw.
Kinda like saying a side effect of meat is killing animals. It's not really a side effect, it's the entire foundation.
You can't separate out blockchain from its wastefulness. It's a bad idea
Which is all blockchain really is
There's other methods of authentication you can use if you're not using a headass method of distribution. You can also authenticate via authority. Other storefronts manage proof of sale in ways that make sense.
They'd actually be far less bad for the environment if they were just stored on a server somewhere
NFTs are just so much more clearly a scam because they don't map to lunacy that's been normalised in the real world the same way crypto does. Doesn't make crypto or money in general any less insane.
Also I don't personally see a difference between fungible crypto and NFTs. They're both a bunch of horseshit being used for tax evasion and being proper up because people believe them to have value that's completely unjustified.
That's who's maintaining NFTs though
Most NFTs are traded on Ehterium's blockchain, so people trading that coin.
It's buying a receipt, but it's a very legit receipt hand written by a janitor
Paying for literally nothing and believing you've bought something is pretty much the definition of a scam
Because you're buying nothing
And it's not like a blockchain noting that you dropped a cool 2 mil for a pepe image actually means anything at all
The best way I've heard it described is that when you buy an NFT you pay for the idea of ownership. Because you don't actually own anything about the image, you can't legally, as an example print it on a t-shirt.
have a tool
and just like
You could even pull an Animal Crossing
IDK why people expect tons of random studios to wade through the nightmare of integrating their stoner monkey into games <:LuL:789259461470322728>
If you wanted to integrate two games on steam the difficulty would mostly come from organisation. That's why it's really common for games from the same studio to be integrated.
nearly 20 if you go back to R/S
That's just like, 17 years of compatibility?
<:heh:789431887135113241>
I still have a Sceptile from Pokemon Emerald. Amazing how Game Freak managed to do that without NFTs
so the only option is digital
shuffling a deck of thousands isn't feasible
They'd also need to use some sort of RNG calculator that included every card in the actual game too
Also, you can if you're a tax inspector <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Why is that an advantage exactly?
Crypto is attempting to do the exact same job as traditional banking and displace its use
that's the easy answer to this
Football games don't try to do the same job as football
This is a really dumb argument
Why would I want to go out and play it
I do not enjoy football
Different people do different things for recreation
OK, let me spell this out. Using energy can be worthwhile when value is gained from it. Recreation is worthwhile. The issue is when we start using energy for things that no longer have value. Boiling water for tea carries some value, so that's acceptable. Boiling water then leaving it to cool is just a waste. The reason why crypto isn't comparable to PC gaming is because there's an alternative which fills the exact same job as it and does so with lower energy draw. Board games are obviously not a replacement to PC games because they are recreation and do not show 100% overlap (or anywhere near it) with the community of PC gamers.
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
and we thought of the exact same thing because we're not idiots without any imagination at all

Or alternatively feudalism 3
Capitalists are a parody of themselves <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Capitalism has failed. Let's fix it with capitalism.
How many SAOs do we need to disprove that good things get sequels <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Feudalism 3
That's where all this started
I view both capitalism and feudalism as tools for the repression of workers. They have far too many parallels to ignore. They both grant insane amounts of wealth and power to a minority and use those things to strip power and freedoms away from the workers under them. 

I see absolutely nothing wrong with labelling capitalism as feudalism two. It's a rebranding. How do you get people to accept their oppression when they now have some leverage over you since you're utterly reliant on them not to simply take over their workplace and cut your worthless fat arse out of the equation?

Quite frankly I don't care what Marx thought about this. He didn't have the same hundreds year long history to draw from we do. This is the issue with traditionalism. Those who came before never have knowledge of how the systems they talk about will develop.
I assume this because it's what capitalism trends towards. This is late stage capitalism, what were living through now. Did you know wealth distribution is about the same now as it was in the gilded age?
Yes, I am not a Marxist. I think Marx was wrong about a lot of things. One of those was his point of view on capitalism. He had some good ideas, this wasn't one of them.
Capitalism is based on the idea of paying people less than the value of their work. If you pay them the value of their work then you have nothing left to skim off the top as a capitalist. It's fundamentally exploitative.
He rose the same way as everyone else who's ever made wealth, by exploiting and stealing from those doing work for him
Or you know, if his engineers had designed garbage for a website
And if he had a sales team who did a worse job he'd have also failed, but those guys end up with fuckall despite most likely being more responsible for his success than he is.
~~It's almost like when you let the aristocrats redesign a system they do the bare minimum tweaks around the edges they can get away with~~
A few points, social mobility under capitalism is mostly overstated and the vast majority of money is old money, so it is inherited power and nepotism. Even if it wasn't, that doesn't justify the power that the capital class wield. And the similarities I'm looking out are in the way money concentrates power just the same as blood right did and also acts suspiciously similarly. 

I also do believe that capitalism is a problem. The main problem in fact. Neoliberalism is a logical extension of capitalist ideas. All liberal ideologies kinda suck.
no, I make a serious claim about the extreme similarities between capitalism and feudalism
Both systems fundamentally revolve around a class with wealth securing resources created by a class without wealth and hording the majority of said resources while distributing a fraction to the class of workers under them. I strongly believe that this fundamental core of both systems is enough of a similarity to make the joke work. Do I really need to explain all that?
Yes Kat, it's highly likely I wouldn't find your joke funny because I disagree with your worldview. For this to be revisionist however I'd have to make claims about history. I think capitalism and feudalism are eerily similar systems, that's a claim about the systems.
unrelated though

yeah, people are still super yikes about the whole picking on furries shit
Also, personally I make a distinction between worth and capital value. Cryptos can have a very high market value, but they're not really worth anything. An action such as caretaking has very high worth but very low market value. The concepts aren't really that linked.
Hey, Apple has a market cap far higher than that and they're still 100% worthless
at all
It wouldn't

Context?
rather than what's actually in the vaccine
To be fair here, arm pain can be caused by where the injection goes
The main difference is that boosters are normally half doses. No idea if that makes any difference to symptoms.
It can happen but the entire system is designed to minimise social mobility. The entire capitalist system is designed so that the most effective way to generate wealth is with wealth, which tends towards creating a fairly rigid class system. Focusing on the few exceptions makes very little sense since 99% of the ruling class have wealth inherited by aristocratic means.
This, the dollar has been majority digital since like, the 00's
I actually think it's more likely that more countries will start to come down harder on crypto and cause a crash
Most corps love to do that
To be fair, that's probably greenwashing
I don't think tech's at fault, I think the oligarch asshats who prop this shit up like Musk are
The computers set up to mine shitcoins are also a huge material waste
Bonds give societal returns
I'd argue something like a bond is far more advantageous overall
Crypto is explicitly used by the rich to make paper trails more confusing to follow. This is well known and several tax agencies have released statements on it.
yes, of course it does, but crypto allows another avenue that we don't need to allow and allows for even further reductions. We need to be closing tax loopholes, not opening new ones.
*allow rich bastards to trade without being taxed properly
weirdly enough
Yeah, I don't really like currency as a concept very much
Or who's your money coming from
So uhhh, where's your money coming from?
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
The system we're living in is shit, so I must prop it up
Crypto's just capitalist techwank, what we need is solidarity, unionisation and socialist reforms
and it's not crypto
Yeah, there's a solution to that
If your real wage is dropping that's due to poor government policy, not inflation
because we were talking about inflation
Which is what we were talking about
no, it's wage VS inflation
and actually real wages in France are rising
I just went and searched the first, random western European country I thought of
It is in many countries that have at any point in time elected a socially democratic government
Literally, our min wage is pegged to inflation
They do here
Citation?
Uhhh
Inflation isn't inherently terrible as long as wages rise with it
Every currency on earth is undergoing some degree of inflation
It strengthened for a bit and dropped recently
The JPY is worth literally the exact same amount in USD it was 5 years ago
And yes, the Japanese gov is shit
The economy of Japan is the 6th largest in the world. If it's a wreck that's due to governmental management, not inflation, which really hasn't happened.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/05/16/how-japan-proved-printing-money-can-be-a-great-idea/
All countries should keep the right to print money. National autonomy should never be handed over to a market.
eventually you get sick of apples and have to join the community to get something else
Having 100000 apples is worth nothing when people won't trade for your apples
Anarchists also believe that people should be allowed the proceeds of their own labour (this is something I 100% agree with). This is important because it's the thing that stops this situation. The idea being that people will work and pool resources within their community. In this society there's not really much reason to horde, because people don't really trade.
Being anti currency as actually not an uncommon socialist position. I think you'd find that the majority of Anarchists hold this position. I'm not personally an Anarchist, I think there's a role for government but I think a more cooperative system devoid of currency is preferable to what we currently have.
Both are the enemy of ecology
I'd extend my critique of crypto to the stock market and to traditional fiat currency. I'm willing to bet most liberals would not do this.
Also, I'm a socialist. I think exchanges in general are not a good thing.
Have you just missed the glut of companies pushing NFTs?
Not really, I do occasionally agree with republicans when they come to a decision I reached myself. I don't see why a group I generally disagree with agreeing with me would cause cognitive dissonance at all.
It's not saying that you should take money from other working people because nihilism or some shit.
It's saying you need food and to keep yourself sane and in order to do that you need to work/spend money in some unethical ways.
There is more and less ethical consumption. That saying isn't justification to fully partake in capitalism.
if anyone is then that's disgusting
I'm assuming some are
Gates deserves poverty
other than Gates
no-one deserves poverty
I don't care what their ideology is
Bonds exist and are the most ethical way to invest
Again, no
Which means not being opportunistic and robbing other working class people.
This is what I mean, we need solidarity
because someone's losing
In Europe you get services worth paying for
makes sense to me
If you earn more you pay more
and you pay less
You don't earn much
That's the idea
Yeah
At that point a contract is actually better
legit question
What do you do if you transfer money into someone's wallet and they just walk off without giving you what you paid for?
There's a lot of things that can be used for this. Contracts come to mind.
It's still capable of performing the basic function of phone
I'm aware, but an iPhone is still more valuable than anything crypto produces even if it's e-waste
IE, the rich should be paying >70%
Progressive tax brackets
but like, a small amount of tax could be obviously worth it for a poor person if they got, say, $50 of food spending money back per month.
I'm in favour of 0 or even negative tax brackets
Taxes for the poor are evil unless the poor get back more value than they put in
Yes, that's true. But I think cryptos are generally not a non physical product with value
but some people seem to
I don't think they're worth anything
Apple also produces a physical product
Half the time XDU is people meming about how bad XDU is
Pug's completely right on that one

Held the same opinion about that for a very long time
No shit, but it's also the only feasible way to make money unless you actually assume long term growth. I see no good reason to assume this.
I'd actually argue that short term investments are about the only thing you can do with crypto that makes sense. Long term investments into a completely unproven and volatile market doesn't sound like a fantastic idea and there's like, three whole shops that actually accept crypto. You can play casino capitalism on it though. Yay.
A co-op coal mine would still be a terrible thing
I never mentioned anything about your business structure, that's nice I guess. But the issue is the ethical problems with what you do.
I think if you reach the level where you run your own business and don't run it explicitly as a co-op you're an oppressor. Management tends towards oppression but isn't inherently. It really just depends on if they understand that they're still a cog and do what's in their limited power to make the workplace better for those under them or if they put the boot on workers.
I've seen managers who power trip like dickheads and managers who maintain a degree of solidarity with their work force.
It depends on how they act with that power
I'm not even convinced that's better than just a fiat. I'll be honest
and like, also a system that helps to perpetuate the exact same system that oppresses workers in the first place.
Or, you know, propping up a destructive economic system that can result in poorly informed people who invest in it losing huge amounts of money
So you just chose to join the oppressors
You can achieve the same with mass civil disobedience and direct action through groups like unions
not at all
No, you can't
We don't have 0 power, but you're not going to get anything done by being overly fatalistic
That's what I said
yes
I mean, protestors in Queensland blocked a proposed rail passage to a coal mine for so long that they literally gave up quite recently
but they've done it
Easily is the wrong word
Well
We don't have 0 power, people have managed to avert government projects through direct action quite easily before
which is something I personally disagree with
Tax payers don't really have that much decision power
See, here's the thing. You don't actually need to convince a single tax payer
I'd assume taxpayers
Funnily enough, the thing that would stop a Carrington event actually having a huge impact on modern society is paper money. Even without that though there's no reason to believe that people would just abandon the idea of society.

I've had my 5 minutes of fun
I think I'm going to just drop again honestly
I know some communists who are very offended by this
but OK I guess
IDK how that works
Like, my district elected a progressive local council, a left of Labor state MP and a  far right lunatic federal MP
There's been a surge in left wing politicians in state and local politics in Australia, but that hasn't really translated up to the federal level yet
I know the Portuguese do, no idea on anything past their existence though.
Do the Spanish have a labour party?
And that's not to say any of them are perfect, I just think that the organisational structure of a labour party is generally a good way to hold a party slightly more to a pro worker ideology than a party that's less loosely aligned with unions
From my knowledge though most mainland European labour parties are pretty good, especially the Swedish and Norwegian ones, NZ and Aus are both fine if lacking in some areas, it's mostly just the UK one that has a habit of devolving into a dumpsterfire
strangely
I've heard Welsh Labour are kinda decent though
yeah, UK Labour's been shit since Sir Kier came in
I'm not living in the UK <:02shrug:443257729646198784>
Also, to be clear here I've never once in my life voted Labor as a first preference, I just respect their role as a stopgap to having two parties that are completely liberal.
The bigger issues here are corruption, which is an issue in literally any system and corporate influence, which union ties don't prevent, but they can help to make less bad.
I mean, if the roles had really reversed it would mean every time a labour party was out of office unions immediately would lose all their money. Most union money is sourced via members fees.
unions fund labour parties
workers fund unions
Labour parties don't fund unions
Polls have him 46-54% 2PP and generally seeming to trend downwards on most metrics, I think a Liberal defeat is quite likely. Don't know if Labor's going to pick up a win though.
but I don't think Morison's chances are very good right now.
Can't say for sure
I think my country's about to shift away from the Liberal party for the first time in 9 years
Or like, if your country develops a fetish for Tories somewhere down the line. That can suck too.
And on average these parties do far better than other socially democratic parties because they don't end up dominant over unions, quite the opposite. They normally source most of their members from unions and most of their funding, which leaves them very reliant on the union's support. It's problematic when this starts to break down, as is the case in the UK.
*I think there's a few more, those are just the ones I can think of
There's relatively few labour parties set up in the same way as Aus/NZ/the UK (in theory) are. A labour party has a degree of integration with unions above that of a traditional left wing party. I think outside of those three it's only Ireland, Sweden and the Netherlands out of western countries that actually use the same structure.
And this is less the unions being a part of the system and more the unions being one side of the system
This is why labour parties are actually so important. A well run labour party (sorry UK Labour) helps to prevent this happening by ensuring that the unions actually maintain power over a major political party and not the other way around. Aus and NZ Labo(u)r have never been allowed to sell out quite as much as most left wing parties because they always have unions breathing down their necks. And the Greens.
Imagine if the day after the UK left the EU the EU just went to NZ, Australia and Canada specifically and committed to trade deals <:LuL:789259461470322728>
When does Australia get to join the EU, we're part of Eurovision that should be enough right? You should just let us in to fuck with the Brits.
The issue is that Israel supposedly is and their actions are also completely unjustifiable two wrongs don't make a right but we're actively supporting one side's actions.
agreed, the west shouldn't be propping up theocracies.
We should probably do things to try to deescalate tensions in Israel. Because it sucks for everyone on both sides who isn't a colonialist or a politician, it sucks a lot worse for Palestine but it still sucks for Israeli's too.
The left here kinda just agrees to prop up the Greens for as long as they're useful
Rip in Australia
and the upside exaggerated
The thing is the downsides of a weak currency tend to be less pronounced for a nation undergoing development
I think it would have made sense for the UK to adopt the Euro
The Euro is fantastic for wealthy nations, but having a devalued currency can actually be useful in a lot of cases
and I'd argue that's actually a good thing for them
Poland does not use the Euro
Like, poor nations need to deficit spend
The biggest issue with the EU is that it's overly neoliberal in operation and that can cause a whole lot of issues when it comes to development in poorer nations
If there's one thing I know for sure about the EU, I respect their drive to fuck with Apple
it needs some reforms
but right now
I think it has so much potential
I have a complex point of view on the EU
Different cultures just develop in different ways
The Incan empire did not have a written language (probably anyway) but seem to have had a working understanding of genetics and a knowledge of medicine and agriculture that put Europeans to shame, as one example.
Also, a good chunk of Africa used derivatives of Arabic
Different cultures evolve in different ways at different times. Some cultures just put more primacy on oral culture and don't develop writing because of that
No, real life doesn't work like Civ
Yeah, both of those statements are hilariously wrong
they didn't
It doesn't matter if they would or not
While I normally wouldn't agree with comments like that they didn't come up with and execute a plan to divide Africa into colonies, so yeah, probably.
Even if African nations fight amongst each other at times that doesn't change the way the west has acted in Africa
Kat that has fuckall to do with what I said
Also, the initial, more direct state sponsored colonialism which hallowed out African and some South East Asian nations in the first place was very much the west.
I say the west because the worst institutions in terms of fucking with Africa are western banking institutions, especially the world bank who have been very proactive in ensuring that Africa is constantly ladened with debt and it's mostly western corporations who are the ones going in and directly exploiting cheap labour, sometimes going to near banana republic lengths.
There's an undeniable degree to which the west has set Africa back and continues to into this day.
Yeah, Cypher, the wealth of nations is arbitrary. We could choose to provide ample food and water worldwide quite easily. We could stop debt trapping nations in Africa and let them develop. If we did so you might find that a resource rich nation like the Congo actually ended up being far wealthier than you'd expect. The issue is that the west are neo-colonialist assholes who make sure that poor nations are constantly in debt and have to allow their corporations access to low wage labour.
was just going to post the colonialism one
fuck, I wish I could find the Sean Bean civ quote
also, while I said that in a jokey way, economic value is just whatever a guy in a suit says it is ultimately. It's just something that humans have decided.
Maybe economic value is all a BS story that capitalists made up to make themselves feel better <:heh:789431887135113241>
Probably could have been less dramatic if there wasn't an attempt at active germ warfare though
The aboriginal population of Australia had a far better understanding of management of ecology than the British did
and we can also quite easily perform mathematics in base 60 anyway
Time and degree measurements still
we do it quite frequently
And uhhh, we can actually measure in base 60
We're not, but OK
The point was that cultures can develop in different ways. What the west does isn't inherently the best. The way the west developed certainly gave a military advantage, but that doesn't inherently make it better or more developed. You don't have a full understanding of the cultures that existed in even a tiny corner of Africa, what they valued, what their traditions were or how they used technologies. You picked on a very specific technology that's important to the west, but you didn't consider that maybe it was just less important to Africa's cultures. There's any number of things they could have been doing that could have been far more advanced than the west.
Nubia?
Bronze age Egypt?
Uhhhhh
Want to talk about the influence of the Haudenosaunee on the US and by extension western democracy?
Africa had a lot more than two scripts
Yep, they're marketed very well though. Only people they're really advisable for is diabetics honestly.
Diet softy drinks probably aren't more healthy than full sugar due to the way how insulin production works. It's kinda terrible to drink/eat something that's sweet but contains no sugars because your body still reacts as if you did just consume sugar and produces insulin.
Is it even that much easier to microwave than yo use a griddle pan?

Yeah, other than some weird crap going on in Western Aus it's just a pop density map
Also, to be clear here I'm not against hate speech laws, I'm just saying you have to understand what freedom of speech is and who it actually protects. Politicians don't have that much to fear from the far right. They generally want to entrench them and grant them and the enforcement agencies that protect them more power. They do have a lot to fear from the far left. Once freedom of speech is gone the first group you should expect to see a political crackdown on is the far left, not the right. Especially considering we've seen politicians just ignore laws outright to do so anyway. It's not a good idea to make this easier for them.
Why would they care if fascists were promoting their ideology? They agree with at least half of it
I mean the rich asshats running government
Remember the US government chose to ignore their laws to execute communists.
Again, McCarthyism is a very good example of who they'd be the first to strike against
Because Hectan, governments aren't actually scared of fascism. Fascism maintains their position at the top, so if you give them free reign to crack down on anything that's not what they'll go after.
And no, this is just untrue. It's been shown time and time again that harsh and disproportionate punishments don't actually work. What you need is restorative practices
I don't think that painting free speech as a broadly bad thing is at all correct. If it's removed or ignored you very quickly end up with McCarthyism where the government will start to repress ideas that they don't agree with.
Feels like this is a better proxy for population density
Like, a lot of peoples strength actually comes from the support that other people give them, you don't need to focus on being the absolute strongest you can be all the time and it's actually going to hurt you quite a lot in the long run if you do.
If I can put in a word, I really don't think this strong vs weak and us vs them mentality is at all healthy and I do really think you should seek help for it.

I mean
*the owner of a co-op isn't responsible for the business, it's ran by workers democratically
a scary percentage
Like
Quite a lot are shells designed to take money from investors and run
*some corps do
they may have had an investor at the start, but it's almost always a goal to pay them out
Co-ops reinvest a percentage of profit for running costs and growth
They objectively are different. They allow workers far more control up to and including setting pay ratios for management. They generally pay far better, give better benefits and better conditions.
because they're morally superior to exploitative corporate practices.
and the fact you can means we should
since they exist
you clearly can though
You said you can't do large scale co-ops
There's several examples of large co-ops
Because the Mondragon Corporation doesn't exist
Coops survive better than other companies overall
horseshit
https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/2020-10/co-operative_survival_1.pdf
All shares should be destroyed, every company should be a co-op. People shouldn't be able to extract value from other's labour.
They're just parasites leaching off the value that employees create
There's no investors without employess
what a joke of a statement
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
because the corps will just push any losses down
List of people who will be hurt by this:

*liberal politicians, some liberal voters may see this as an issue.
Because like, liberals don't view this as a problem. This is the intended effect of liberal policy.
It's worth noting that all of these international organisations are by their nature extremely liberal. They might have officially been set up to fight tax evasion but they're stacked with liberals who kinda don't have that many issues with it and designed by liberals who are always sure to never give them too much actual power.

If I'm a worker at a corporation I'm taking the same risk
you can't regulate your way out of issues core to the system
It needs to be taken out behind the shed and have 5 bullets put in its head
Outsourcing of labour and the issues it creates is unarguably a core problem of capitalism
we know that
Capitalism is a vicious cycle
yes
I'd argue a punitive one to ensure that imported high carbon goods can never be competitive
implement a carbon tariff
Should be on the government to think like that though
By buying a pair of shoes that were created ethically with energy consumption in mind and not shipping off all the work to China.
I'd argue moreso
It's also the fault of whatever country actually imports the end product
It's bad for the capital class who rely on exports, probably not for the workers who had their jobs shipped off overseas
weirdly enough
protectionism
Or, you know
If China regulated they'd just run to whichever country didn't
How is it China's fault that the west allows corporations to do whatever the fuck they want and go where ever the fuck they want?
It's also worth noting that the way how a lot of nations are actually cutting emissions right now is by reducing manufacturing and pushing it to China
Per capita carbon emissions paints a very different picture
Also, they should be adjusting for percapita
they gave away the game there
Just read the thing at the bottom
Strange non-sequitur
Reminder that a gay man made neolib extraordinaire and literal fossil Joe Biden flip his position on gay marriage
The issue is that line of thinking leads to inaction
Yeah, I don't accept that logic either. If someone's suffering, and I believe everyone is under capitalism then I want to do whatever is in my power to affect that change.
look at city designs getting fucked up over the course of like, 20 years
We've had rapid changes for the worse before
Why not?
So never improve society because we're doomed to monarchy <a:NOTED:810618625903951933>
it just removes some of capitalism's most exploitative features
it even maintains the capitalist framework
That wouldn't require changing much of anything
key word
democratising
just change who it works for
we don't even have to get rid of the framework at first
What if we made a change that the vast majority of poor people could agree with and that benefits them like, say, democratising the workplace by allowing workers to own the corporations that they work for
Yes, human nature is cooperative, culture can shift this
You can't say something's in our nature when we've existed without it before
and I guess still do where they exist
we know this because tribal societies functioned entirely cooperatively
we are not anywhere near as competitive by nature as we are socialised to be under capitalism
Hey, mr geneticist here, humans are by their nature generally quite cooperative
*working a shitty desk job which does nothing for society being the most humanlike of traditions, dating back to the stone age
This is my favourite fact
Hey, an Australian Senator stood on the senate floor and outlined the plot of Eromanga Sensei
Imagine if MLK and the civil rights movement had thought like that
Meaningful change has never come without direct action
This isn't action. Action is protesting, involving yourself in action that seeks change like a political party or union or otherwise attempting to affect a change now. I'd call this inaction.
Though our chucklefuck of a PM took a brave stand with Nazis against the states vaccine mandates, so we'll see how that one goes.
And over here that number seems to be under 10% when push comes to shove, vax rates are still ticking up across the ACT, Vic and NSW too even if more slowly now. Turns out most people get vaccinated if you tell them it's a requirement to participate in society.
States in Aus have already got over 90% of over 16s and they're still increasing due to the implementation of vaccines basically being a requirement to work or do the vast majority of things.
This is why I'm highly supportive of vaccine mandates honestly
I kinda figured this would happen when a ton of countries started to stall at under 70% vax rate
I think the only way you can get another hearing for a not guilty in the US is either evidence of a new crime or evidence of a mistrial
I think the biggest issue here is the way how the US handles ownership and carry of weapons. Having said that while self defence shouldn't be completely removed the bar should be raised.
We are talking about governments and privatisation
He sucked
but uhhh, fuck Turnbull
To Labors credit they were actually planning to keep the NBN publicly owned
Our government thought privatising the national telecom company along with all of the lines was a good idea

something like that basically
yeah, or find that he failed to disclose a prior relationship
which I think is pretty BS, because if new evidence comes up then there should be an option for a retrial
yeah, from my understanding you basically need to prove there was something fundamentally wrong with the way how the trial was conducted
yeah, because there's no consequences
Like, me and my mate have thrown a dildo around like a football before, not going to toss a dildo at a random stranger. It's the same for these people, racist jokes with friends, respectable front for others.
That's just an issue of consequence. There's no real consequences if you behave in a socially unacceptable way online as long as it's not linked back to you. To be fair a lot of these people are like this IRL within their ingroup because everything is context dependant.
Most people do to an extent. I'm not just going to flash my hentai collection to random people IRL but there's over 3k results when I search my name in NSFW. It is more problematic when it's racism though.
Yeah, and they view the internet as different from real life
which is pretty fucked
This is just how all the people they're around online act

If only there was some other race in 1900s Germany that the dominant German race may have wanted to discriminate against
It's job was to exclude people of different ethnicities from high level entry schools
No, it's not
I feel like most people know that
IQ is complete horseshit not to be taken seriously
On both axis?
Has a scale?
See the way how the second set you linked
What I'm saying is the graphs you showed don't have any data to support the argument. They're just the authors idea of what happens.
I'm a fucking biologist
I know some things correlate with age
That's 100% unrelated
What the fuck?
The point I'm making is that graphs that don't use data do not show anything more than what the person drawing them thinks. We can use data for more than one person. It's called population data.
Which means you need data
You need to do some sort of scientific study
No
So they're worthless
Not a single one of these graphs use any imperical data at all
What is your scale?
What metric are you using
That's not an answer
Performance in what?
Because the graph doesn't even bother
How do you quantify either?
I dont think that means anything
It's not uncommon
I kept growing into my early 20s too
Horseshit. The brain keeps developing well into the 20s
Because we arbitrarily decided that
See, here's the issue with that argument. It's just as valid as me saying that I was politically aware when I was 16 and would have been quite able to vote for a party in a completely rational way. My political views were actually highly stable between around 16 and 22ish. The way I voted in the 2016 election would have been identical to the way I would have voted in 2013, because I already had a socially democratic environmentalist viewpoint at the time.

This is the problem with all of your arguments. They rely on picking out individual examples. There's nothing that causes people to magically mature once they hit 18. That group of 17 year olds could have quite easily been 18. And fascists over 18 years old certainly exist too. The age of 18 is arbitrary. Anywhere we can draw the line is. My take is that if you can work, you should be able to vote. Still arbitrary, when are you old enough to work? But I think far more favourable. If you're working you deserve the democratic right to do something about laws that oppress you.
Sure, go ahead and do that
A few months off from an election and the Tories decide now is a good time to implode and start talking about confidence votes <:LuL:789259461470322728>
We can find differences about how they understand, process information ECT. and what they know, but none of those are traditional intelligence because traditional intelligence doesnt really exist.
Given the quality of the police force whatever they're using isn't working
How do you measure or even define intelligence at all?
It is literally against code to attempt to use IQ in education in Australia
Ever
Yes, educators do not use IQ
And yes, that eye test is culturally orientated, no shit. It can and has however been adapted, whereas IQ has been abandoned
IQ is your score on a test
Funny how that happens isn't it?
Yeah, and my original point was that graphs without axis with actual data mean nothing.
We abandoned it because it is, and I cannot stress this enough, explicitly racist
You don't find IQ being used in a serious setting anywhere
Also the test is still explicitly racist and people from western countries still do far better on it. Educators laugh at IQ. It's like, the worst way of understanding intelligence.
Uhhh, it was invalid before then. It was always designed so white people scored higher. Just because in the first few years it wasn't used for atrocities it doesn't mean it was valid.
It's been explicitly racist for its entire existance and it is not a valid test.
The fact they scored lower was taken as a sign it was working
And also, the IQ test was explicitly tested on African populations in its early years
You miss the point, they didn't have little to no regard. They considered themselves better. That's exactly the sort of thing that leads to you wanting something like IQ to "prove" that your e better.
You think someone in the 1900s wouldn't have tried to create an exclusionary test that showed white people were smarter? Seems a touch naive to me.
Some of the questions in the original test were literally designed to be culturally exclusive
But yeah, even when it was created people knew that IQ was highly favourable to white Europeans
Is prosecuting miscarage going back decades? Were we doing that before?
This really does feel like a state sponsored shitpost though
Why are you asking me that oddly specific question?
yeah, I don't buy this as a reaction to the shitfest

This is some good news
Senate comes closer to actual proportional rep but still has major issues
Pretty busted
Greens got ~11% of the vote and 0.75% of the seats, Nats got 4% and about 6%
But it's not proportional
We use ranked choice
It is broken
And yes
Cypher the Aus system produces too many majorities which means the majors with the powers of both president and PM are likely to try to distort the system, that's the big issue
Wrong text code <a:karenEhh:567668661716910080>
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Swiss_Confederation>

Big fan of this system
If we were going to have a president I'd want them to be a figurehead without very much power.
Yeah, that's why I like the idea of the state leaders basically dividing up the powers of head of state. I don't think presidents with a ton of power are good and I know the Aus system is going to trend that way because it's shit.
The GG shot first though
Yes, this literally happened
Good luck convincing anyone to implement that though
I'd actually like to see an Australian head of state function like the Swiss to some degree. Our head of state should be a representative council of the states leaders.
No this does not make any sense
And yes, that means the PM has the ability to dismiss the GG and the GG has the power to dismiss the PM
Since that's actually the PMs descression
Also if the GG tried to stop a law they'd just be replaced
The courts can reject them if they're found unconstitutional
The GG does but they have no right to reject laws on any grounds
That's the Senate's job
Either the house or senate
Every other power you listed is held by parliament
The only real power the queen has in Aus is the dismissal of the PM and dissolution of parliament
No consequences for the powerful
Fuckall
Nope
Why Australia still has the crown as head of state after that is beyond me
The Monarch has dismissed an Australian PM before
*not in aus
You can't make this shit up
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
Hilariously one of the Libs suggested we should become a republic because the monarchy is too supportive of climate change regulation recently though
I think it will happen when Elizibeth dies
They'd better not fuck this up again
Oh hey, Labor now have a polling lead over the Liberals in every single state and a net lead of 55.5-44.5 2PP

And apparently that's legal
Can't block him
I can't reply
Dickhead can just send me this
Just a sec
I have a text from the fucker
We had one do it recently
And yes, polis in Aus have change parties post election
Thank God that they're still one seat short
Since the Lib Nats are just short in the senate
We have the unholy alliance of the Lib Nats and One Nation right now
There's usually some tensions between liberals and social dems
Probably not the most stable of coalitions
They've been consistently between 10-12% here for a while
He's the dark red seat
That exists
For some reason
Cypher I should introduce you to the insanity that is our agrarian conservative borderline communist party
Ours have just always been left of Labor socdems and socialists
Even if I wish Hanson would fuck off and never return
Senate is better

So may as well be one party
Who are in a permanent coalition
Also, blue and dark green are the Libs and Nats
We need PR

At all?
Because why should anyone have ever had rights to that land
In fact I think they're far better than private cars in most ways
Honestly
But like, I don't see what the issue with public share cars would be
Don't own a car
Rady
So yeah, as far as I'm concerned make them punative and make the rates for trying to withdraw money overseas over a certain amount near 100%. Do not have an issue with taking from the rich to support the poor after those fuckers have spent their whole lives exploiting the poor.
Owning something is something I don't agree with
You can set up ways around that and if a governent actually cares it's not that hard. Also capital flight doesn't really like, happen.
If you are going with income it has to be paired with capital gains increases
Yeah, personally I'd say corporate and wealth taxes, income taxes have some flaws
None of that actually sounds like a terrible idea, at least they're not blasting it to business and waiting for trickle down that will never come
Dropping VAT probably would do that
Depending on how they plan to use the money it could have stimulatory effects on the economy
Oh yeah, he's also a coal shill, which would be enough of a reason to dislike him alone. But add to that that he's also a truly disgusting poli on every single issue and yeah, I really want to see him gone.

Yep
When women were out protesting ||sexual assaults|| within government our PM said something like "they're lucky they're in Australia so they don't get shot"
Oh, the best one
Like, our Tories behave a lot like fascists
And the media
Ours have ordered the AFP to raid unions before
Yeah
Uhhh
Tories are behaving more and more like fascists
Cypher, our government literally lost a vote in parliament on a corruption commission today and used a technicality to annul the vote
But yeah, govt housing here is totally fine
Read back over that and see what you just implied
Fuck you for saying that
I just want to say
The market just creates the most profitable housing and ensures perpetual shortage to keep house prices increasing.
But sure
Yeah, that's not true based off of government housing as it exists
I trust government to provide basic human rights far more than a market
You act like the market doesn't mismanage them already
And I don't have an issue saying that at all, because the current situation of for profit housing and rent is so absurdly inhumane that I just don't see it as a worse option. Government housing, even as it exists now is far better than private market housing.
Personally I prefer the state however
That someone could be community representatives
If you want to view it that way. Alternatively it could be viewed as removing ownership of housing. I don't see much difference.
That means you shouldn't be able to profit off of them in any way
Like, what I'm saying is that housing is a human right and we should, at the very least attempt to decomodify human rights
Yes, but if also say that if the plans are approved supplies and labour for building should be covered. You should be allowed to build (or more realistically assist the build) or not, it should be up to you.
Think of it as an extreme form of state housing
In exchange I don't think they should be able to sell their house
I don't think they should have to buy a house
See, here's the thing. Did you see the word I said above. Allocated. I'm advocating for a system where housing is decomodified.
Why should they?
It is to an extent. They would not have rights to sell or to profit of of the land in any way however
He doesn't own the land, at least under the system I'd want to see. If he wanted to build he could go to a form of government and have land that was available allocated, whether he wanted to build for himself or for the community.
Which is why it gets a special focus, along with food being very important.
Yes, it is but the vast majority of land is used for farming
Communal land implies that the land is unopened, workable by anyone in the community and worked for the good of the community.
Have you ever heard of the phrase "farming the commons"? It came around because at one point most of the land across England was communal and could just be farmed freely. Feudalism crushed that though.
Because, and here's the thing, I don't understand where rights to land ever came from or what legitimizes them in any way.
Not just any individual price of land
Cypher, I'm suggesting all land should be communal
The ones actually benefiting from an independent farmers ownership of land are people like the large chain super markets that buy from them. No one's saying they shouldn't be able to farm communal land if they enjoy farming
Because the land could far more effectively be used communally, allowing for the creation of food without the holding of resources. Which would likely benifit theoretical poor farmer anyway.
It has a lot of issues
Melbourne is far from a sustainable city though
5 mil
More people on earth live in a city than not. The reality is that most of the world's population needs to live in apartments for our population to be sustainable.
The two are mutually exclusive once your city reaches a decent size
But yeah, none of this changes the fact that you can't create a city where the majority of people live in detached houses and have a functional city
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
You can't change my mind
This image will forever haunt my nightmares
With a passion
I hate suburbia
Which haunt my fucking nightmares
IDK, I find apartments like this to look better than detached houses
And fuck that shit
Otherwise you get suburban sprawl
To be fair, the majority of people in any given city need to live in apartments for it to function
I much prefer working class and parasite class
The offensive thing was the almost of chances suggestion that it's ok for working class (I refuse to use upper/lower class terminology) people to live in poor housing
Corners are cut on almost every building
It is here
Regulations are rarely followed
And no one can mismanaged housing as baddly as the free market has
Also, if everyone had to live in govt housing, including government and their families do you think maybe they'd be a bit better?
I don't like to base my philosophy around "evil". It can't be measured and means very little. Plenty of people would call me an evil socialist, so I don't see the point in usage of that label.
I see inequity as an inherent problem for society and something we ought to want to reduce as much as we possibly can
I don't like to use the word evil because it's far too nebulous
Kinda by definition actually
It is inherently unequal as long as home ownership is on a market
And personally I think that's a huge issue
It generates a whole lot of inequity
And while home ownership isn't that bad
People liked owning slaves too, we decided that generated a society that was much too unequal and set it off the table
Still, I don't see that as a reason not to advocate for better things
I suspect they'd accidentally trip and fall out of a moving plane
True that
It would depend on the circumstance honestly. Short term considerations should always be a thing, but people taking the piss will also always be a thing. If it's legit you should be able to have a temporary apartment in the city. If it's not you shouldn't be able to abuse the system to have to houses.
I'd argue the current system does far more social engineering that were just more used to. If you're poor go live in the shitty suburb and take an hour and a half getting to work.
Also, it's funny you refer to this as social engineering when I never once said the government should have fine control over where people live. I don't think that should be the case at all. Obviously you can't live just anywhere but that's also true in our current system.
Also, there's still space limits around transit lines in satilite cities. Not uncommon for those to end up with dense centres of their own
*at least where I live
My counter argument to this would be, most people do live in cities? Given the choice a hell of a lot of people are going to continue to do so. If wager still most. However what we'd end up with is a more equitable city where if you wanted to live near the core you had to take a smaller apartment, kinda near the core you got a mid size and further out single family house, rather than what we have now which is free market free for all for the single family house 10 minutes from the city.
50km
And that continues for like
Single family homes
The issue with Melbourne is that we have skyscrapers in the city centre, but if you walk 15 minutes
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
They're shit
We have skyscrapers
Oh
Pakenham is an abomination
Melbourne is 10k km^2
516 Cypher
Melbourne is shitty suburban sprawl all over the place
I'd guarantee it
Your city has a higher density than Melbourne
Also potentially radicalized since the US prison system is exceptionally good at creating criminals
When you stop looking at this as individuals deserving certain punishments and start looking at it as a broad system the reason why acts that soften the US prison system are needed is pretty clear.
Yes, and a system that focused on reforms, such as the one the BREATHE act supports would do a better job at deradicalising them according to every study ever while the US system is well known for radicalising criminals.
If I see the best legal systems around the world not have a life sentence, then what's the point?
So you want the system to take revenge against them, is what you're saying. Here's the thing. I actually don't care about them. Like at all. What I want is a productive system. I look at legal system results using metrics like reincarceration and rates of reform and I see that we get better results with a less punitive legal system. So I favour that. That's all there is to it. I don't think there's actually such a thing as "justice" at all.
That's what punitive systems are built around
It's revenge
What you get kat isn't justice
I don't think the goal of the legal system should be retaliation
And? What do you gain through punitive action.
I just disagree that life sentences are useful in any way
So <:02shrug:443257729646198784>
And like, rates of recommital are generally far lower for all crimes in systems with a less punitive legal system
Here's my question, has he ever recommited a crime? Because ultimately if he hasn't what do we gain by a punitive sentence?
Or that do and define them differently
There's a lot of countries that already don't have them
Ending life sentences isn't that extreme?
And generally imprisoning mentally ill people is a really bad idea, so I wouldn't be against ending that.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, because opposing private prisons is actually a good idea
And yeah, I'm a materialist if you couldn't guess. That's why I tend not to entertain ideas like good and evil too much. They just seem trivial and like a partial understanding of a situation to me.
If all those things resulted in a society that was in some ways less optimal, I'd be fine with it.
But yeah, to me optimisation is a secondary concern after things like equitability, sustainability and general flattening of hierarchies of labour that exist within capitalism and liberation from the oppression that comes with.
Something can be measurably suboptimal
Suboptimal has a meaning depending on context
You could for bad, I sometimes use it as a shorthand but generally there's a point with more depth behind it
The more mutations something has the less scary it is as a rule of thumb. You can get very unlucky with mutations though
Not going to lie though, Omicron scares the shit out of me. Even if it ends up not being super dangerous as a variant it's just showing how poor our handling of the pandemic has been on a global scale. We're just hording vaccines in wealthy countries and letting the pandemic get totally out of hand elsewhere and this shit's just going to keep happening.
10 years is probably possible... if you already have a pre-existing nuclear industry.
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Fucking good
Considering what conspiracy idiots would be saying right now if it was the Xi variant
We have 5 fuckers in the senate
I think that's under review here
We can't tell the kids they can't attend school constitutionally, so it's really hard to deal with
The issue were having is antivax parents getting vaccinated to keep working but refusing to vax their kids
Almost all workplaces require you to be vaccinated to work, all non essential shopping requires vaccination pretty much all recreational activity requires vaccination
Victoria has come as close to mandating vaccines as you can without actually mandating vaccines
And our PM just stokes the fire
https://mobile.twitter.com/rachael_dexter/status/1459332272042041349
Yeah, this is what our antivax movement has been up to
Nice
Same here
Yep
I think Aus is getting near there
They're still really frustrating though
Antivaxers here have actually driven vax rates up <:02lul:414576440114151424>
So like, the US and Europe right now are fairly high risk honestly
Since vaccines are a selection pressure. A mostly vaccinated population with a still significant amount of holdouts and a high rate of infection is pretty much what you need for that mutation to be selected for.
The US has near perfect conditions to create a vaccine resistant varient
$5 on USA
Unless we actually vaccinate everyone
This will keep happening
Also
I hope they can. The issue is that were still in fairly untested waters
and yes, that is a thing that can happen
Like, if it had a very high number then back mutated a ton of negative ones that's scary
if that's the case then most of the mutations could be positives
It really depends. We don't know if there was a precursor omicron with hundreds of mutations that floundered around for months before selection pressures shaped it into something more effective
If these are 32 mutations shaped by selection pressure then fuck
which we don't know
*it does depend how old the variant is though
If something has 32 of them chances are, most of them aren't actually helping
Remember almost every mutation is detrimental to survival
Pretty much, a communist is probably as far left as a Tory is right. We just have a kinda fucked up Overton window that doesn't really call out just how right wing conservatism actually is as an ideology.

The only change I'd make to that is that liberalism actually goes further right than the start of communism is left, since some fascists are still market liberals. It's more like 0-3 rather than 0-2.
There's going to be some confused American reading this room for the first time soon
Again, this excludes democrats since they believe in a far more regulated market. Still centre right since they're still heavily on board with private capitalism and not even sceptical in the same way a soc Dem would be though.
Calling everyone on the left a commie is just factually wrong. It's nothing but empty rhetoric. Calling the majority of the right liberals is like, pretty obvious. The only unifying belief the right (other than some facists) holds is in free market capitalism, which is kinda the prerequsite to being a liberal
I think all three ideologies are right of centre, two of them are noticeably further right however
Democrats are not liberals because they dont
Also I call conservatives liberals because the two share an economic platform
Politics with shared history like liberalism and conservatism, or social democracy and democrat ideology tend towards being more similar
Yes, but politics are still tied heavily to their history and how they arose
Politics have history
So liberals aren't democrats, but conservatives are liberals
Liberalism is a distinct ideology which is based more fundimentally around free market capitalism
Liberals aren't democrats
Democrats are centre right though
Unless you include social democrats under the same umbrella, which they're not
Not that it's a super common ideology
The centre right ideology your e looking foe are democrats
Typically liberals support the exact same economic structure as conservatives. In some cases they actually go further.
Does the FDP look like a moderate party to you?
At all
Like
Liberals aren't moderates?
Also, there were 3 liberals who votes against vaccine mandates, so you can't give the party any credit when there's more right wing lunatics than "moderates"
One is opposing the government's attempt to introduce voter ID laws, she has to because she's from the NT and her constituents are hugely against this since it disproportionately impacts the Aboriginal population which is far larger in the NT. The other has a razor thin margin and ran on getting a corruption commission, she voted for it to not lose her seat.
To be fair, the ones who are supporting decent policy are 100% survival instinct
<:02lul:414576440114151424>
Being a minister under Morrison does
Some of them are even supporting decent policy
I think we're up to about 12 liberals who have either voted against the party or said they will now.
Morrison's lost the whip. People from both sides of the Liberal party are standing in open opposition to him and crossing the floor to vote with other parties against the Libs
Watching our government fall apart over the last few days has been magnificent though
Like, fuck man
And the PM wouldn't denounce the statement
A Tory here called our state premier as bad as Hitler or Pol Pot
Wait, only pretty much?
Not sure how many in the house, but at least Craig Kelley
A lot of South Americans are very anti US due to years of US imperialism in the region
I imagine South America would be far more anti-US than anyone on that list too
pretty much
yeah
What do you think happens if you start asking some South American, African or SE Asian countries
It's really not valid
It's literally a list of US allies
I do agree with the comments here though, they were way too selective on which countries they polled. Get some notionally Chinese allies in there too and see what they say.

The thing is, you can create something that's compositionally identical to cow's milk without a single cow being involved assuming you can get the right ratio of bacteria creating proteins and fats in the right ratio.
You can, considering milk is just a mixture of water with specific fats and proteins. It's far easier to make in a lab than meat.

We basically have already done this. It's just a matter of economics and scaling up creation.

Strange place to get a reminder we're living in a dystopia from
actually no, the replies in general are trash
<:puke:789442676516454420>
The top reply though
Understandable, I wish I was shorter quite a bit too
if they can't pay more they should just stop existing
I have no sympathy for min wage companies whining about not being able to find employees
Dominos is not struggling
I don't think it was a fantastic example either Matt
In fact I actually think it's simpler because were talking about a singular life and not a seperate one.
The issue here is that two freedoms are in conflict, the right to life and the right to bodily autonomy. It's the same issue as shows up in abortion, not just a similar one.
I think it takes a whole lot of cognitive disonence to hold that set of beliefs however
There is a big difference between murder and suicide. I take issue with state sanctioned murder but far less with state sanctioned suicide.
Personal point of view, I really don't have a problem with it in any case where a person is mentally able to make that call
Mandatory referrals have been implemented in some countries, in others it hasn't and it's used by some to keep people away from euthanasia as it also is for abortions. The issue here is that we need mandatory referral to doctors who will aid in euthanasia.
That is how euthanasia works in many countries too
I have huge issues with forcing people who are going to die due to complications with a medical disorder anyway who are also in great pain due to that disorder to continue to endure it.
I do believe the morality around abortion is more complex than assisted dying
Yes
And it's a simple fact that the moral issues here are very similar
I mean, most people here do not have moral issues with abortion.
I disagree, if you've already accepted the more complex issue and dealt with it morally then comparing a simpler issue to it can be useful.
The whole convo was about euthanasia from what I can see
Matt, if you want to avoid sounding sarcastic you could try using more dry academic language where possible, it makes it really hard to come across like that.
And if you do it probably comes down the opposite way
The issue here is that if you're ideologically consistent it's very hard to find a wedge to split these two issues
Abortion could have the exact same conscientious objection, so I don't see that as a good counterargument
You have this the wrong way around, under abortion it's your bodily autonomy and someone else's life. This is why I say assisted dying is actually simpler.
It's still deciding whether right to live supersedes bodily autonomy
And yes, people believe that shit. Feels southern conservatives sometimes hold insane opinions
I'd agree, but also that's why mandatory referrals need to be a thing
and ultimately my answer to that is that I don't think people who don't want to live should be forced to. We should obviously do things to try to stop them, therapy etc. But if that all fails and they're deadset why shouldn't we just allow that to happen?
I'd struggle to see being forced to live through extreme pain as not ruining oneself
I'd call that exploitation personally
The article even using the term "assisted suicide" is loading the conversation
I somewhat doubt it will ever be favoured over medication, but whatever
The machine is for assisted dying
That's a very weird slippery slope argument that seems to not take the main reasons for suicide into account.
I've felt like setting a Christmas tree on fire once before, in my defence it was October
you could have just made an AI very good at convincing humans it's intelligent under certain circumstances
it could fall apart the second it sees anything else
It could just be exceptionally good at fooling your intelligence tests
isn't that the same point about your AI though?
moreover I view the distinction as questionable when we don't even know what for more advanced AIs would take. An AGI could just be an AI with a broad goal system that's adaptable to different situations by changing of variables, I think this is far more likely than a humanlike AI.
Iski, how would you propose we get to AGI. If the answer is refinement of current AI then there kind of has to be an embedded goal there.
Anything else is going to act like a program more likely than a biological brain
The only form of AGI that might act like a human is a brain scan AI
And also, assuming there's a reward function which we probably need to make AI function so far as we know there's a very high incentive to just, change the way they get rewards
AGI is also quite likely to attempt to do things like modify their own codes
it's easy to say that, but it's actually insanely hard to do
How do you design good goals?
and just making those safe is a complete nightmare
Yeah, but if we're talking about actual AI at bare minimum we have to deal with dumb AIs first
The actual issue here is that AI doesn't really behave in that way. AI has a goal and rules to achieve it
Really good channel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkbPdEHEyEI
This is the fundamental issue here though
like, even in that book the three laws are a bad idea
The point of the book is that the three laws of robotics are hopelessly insufficient and you can't use a simple fix
That was my mistake for the night
Why'd I just decide to read an antivax subreddit? Someone asking what they can do about losing their job due to mandates. Like, just get the damn jab
ideally they wouldn't consider the possibility of being shut down or modified
That might actually be the goal for an AI honestly
It's possible to be very intelligent without self awareness
Just depends on if it's self aware
That could include killing
If it's smart enough, it will find ways to ensure that its reward function is protected
*any AI that gets access to its own code is likely to try the exact same thing too
Very easy to just give yourself millions of reward points every clock tick
Depends how the reward function is written. I'm pretty sure if you let an AI choose what its reward system rewards it for it will most likely just tie it to its clock though
since it's the simplest goal and then it can claim on its reward function just by nature of its existence
There's also a very high chance that if we did the goal it choses would simply be "exist"
That sounds like a horrible idea
But also, why would anyone want to make an AI that chooses its own goals?
As you said, if it looks like intelligence, it is.
The fact that we can even make this makes it far more likely than any of the other ways we could achieve that goal
Yes, but it has variable goals. If you can continue to increase the list of goals it can have and means to achieve it you reach AGI.
Seems more likely that we get to AGI by taking that and scaling it up rather than anything else
The easiest way to make something adaptable is just to use variable goals rather than trying to do something weird that doesn't involve goals though. And this tech already exists in limited forms and has since Oblivion at least.
we're not right now
And they went under because people near universally just stopped going to places that were trying to get away with underpaying workers.
I'm just against worker exploitation, I don't give a damn who does it
Why would small businesses exploiting workers be preferable exactly?
That's still a revealing statistic in and of itself. ~90% of people who have heard it do not use it.
They went under pretty fast
A couple of fairly small places tried to pull the same BS here
Not Biden's fault the company refuses to pay enough to get people to work either
Hopefully this shit gets shut down
At least the people in the comments have sense
They've forced people to work to the point where they died of exhaustion
We've seen this all before
Because we know what Amazon is
Not the warehouse or whatever, this is the whole corp's culture
If there were warnings but employees knew they'd be consequences for them if they followed them (which we call the Amazon special) then it's on Amazon
It wouldn't just be corporate law violations, people would go to jail
If there was a fire warning here (which is the closest we'd get to that in Vic) and a company continued to work through there would 100% be criminal charges
Safety of workers first
No one guy glued to the radar, no wiggle room
Once the warning goes out they should just have to stop work immediately
If they can't nail Amazon down for this it means that there's something wrong with the laws
Also, quite frankly I don't give a fuck if small business in general dies. All non-cooperative business is just direct worker exploitation.
But business in general shouldn't be allowed to exist if they rely on extreme worker exploitation
My point is that neither small nor big business is inherently good, I'd argue the contrary honestly
Several have lost millions in court cases over it including 7/11 and Woolworths
Personally I think they need to remove the carveout for people under 21, but chains here can't get away with paying under the set min wage
Aus hard enforces a minimum wage of ~$21 an hour for employees over 21 for those sort of chains
If it's 0 mutual friends/0 mutual servers I just ignore by default
<:heh:789431887135113241>
Although I wouldn't put it past any corp in 1938 anyways
The point is more to doubt anyone when they claim they're being impartial rather than that they explicitly support Hitler

I thought you had to be human to win person of the year

It's frustrating how utterly predictable a variant like omicron was
Makes sense, omicron seems to give little to no fucks about vaccination
If the US follows the same curve as Europe though it's quite likely that it will be 2020 again pretty much
And I think that should be respiratory sickness, cardiovascular relates to the heart and bloodstream
Yeah, Omicron's absolutely tearing through Australia right now
that thing looks like it weighs 10 tons
Also, the advantage of a quad over a car is that it's light

When did the Onion stop being a satire site
Right now we don't know much about how dangerous it is or its infectivity. All we really know is that it's highly infectious, not the degree to which and that it's vaccine resistant. Personally I'd argue those two facts alone are good reason for extreme caution before we know all the details.
We also don't know where that exponential portion of the graph is going to end. The fact is it could be a more mild variant. If it infects like 4x as many people in one wave that might not matter and it may be just as dangerous or even more dangerous than Delta.
no, it's quite clearly not
I also just want to point out how dangerous it is for the media to be running "is SA's outbreak running out of steam" when
So responsible scientists want to be as close to 100% sure that what they say is actually correct
There's a reason why the scientific community literally always forms the consensus of "just wait for more data". It's because newspapers are shit and will run with any piece of information they get and twist science to fit their own agendas.
the majority of omicron cases in SA are in the last 10 days
and like, here's the thing
You just linked me the telegraph, firstly. Secondly they have one source cited saying that there are many others who disagree with him and agree with exactly what I said.
I think it's fair to say there's a lot of places on earth where the virus is spreading fairly freely
It depends on the selection pressures. If we create a situation where very high viral loads are preferable then we're selecting for more dangerous viruses. The best way to do that is to act like things are normal and allow the virus to spread easily.
Also, virulence is generally more dangerous than lethality
People are making that call much too fast, we've only known about omicron for a month. It takes time to understand how deadly a strain is.
And even then, some do just become more dangerous long term if the selection pressures are right
also the idea that viruses inherently become less dangerous seems strange to me and I've studied biology for a longass time. I think people confuse long term (like, 10+ years in the case of viruses) with short term
honestly basically everything about omicron is
That's a big "needs more data" point Mac
it's not completely clear yet
There seems to be a difference based on vaccine
In the sense that we just left a whole damn continent with next to no vaccine supply and left the virus a ton of room to evolve
Stuff like polenta and pasta should be fairly edible too. Especially polenta.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/18/kamala-harris-la-times-interview-covid-variants-vaccines

This article is somewhat concerning to me. Based on my talks with scientists it pretty much proves that the White House isn't really listening to them. Every biologist I've talked to has predicted Omicron, or at least the likelihood of a highly virulent vaccine resistant strain. It's not a hard prediction to make.

Any biologist could tell you that there's a strong pressure in favour of both vaccine resistance and increased virulence. The exact specifics may be a suprise but scientists would have been telling the White House to prep for this.

If you don't give a fuck about the consequences to society then you're far, far better off investing into stocks. Personally I actually think the negative consequences of stocks are lesser than crypto anyway. Crypto has all the same negative consequences on top of being a Ponzi scheme and just one of the worst environmental options short of investing in coal.
Donations are one of the least effective ways to benefit a community.
If you want to invest in a way that actually benefits a community moreso than business invest into bonds.
It doesn't matter, companies directly benefit from the trade and value of it.
Also, you are supporting companies. Do you think crypto doesn't support companies like Nvidia who's core to the networking or Tesla who's heavily invested?
No matter which way you slice it Crypto is mostly reliant on the stock trade aspect for most of its growth and value. Trading in bitcoin is just a less convenient method than the vast majority of fiats.
You can make as many arguments for alternate use cases as you want, no-one actually uses them that way in practice. Crypto is treated identically to the stock market by the vast majority of people invested into it.
functionally
They are
Yes, I agree with that. I'm also not a fan of stocks. But if your argument seems to rely on stocks being bad why are you arguing in favour of completely unregulated techbro stocks.
Big finance companies have always been against scams and pyramid schemes. Nothing new here. Just because they're against something it does not inherently make it good.
I think you're far to trusting of people pushing destructive tech
To believe that Ethereum will actually move you have to believe that capitalists actually care about the environment more than their personal potential profit. Has Exon taught us anything about that?
more just the regular dystopian capitalist garbage
I don't really see particularly bright possibilities here
Exactly what we need
mostly just strikes me as another method for scummy publishers to exploit their players
This is why finance decentralisation isn't actually a good thing
It's not the default in the same way as banks, and they won't flag potential scams in the same way as banks
You can, but it doesn't
Also, it's worth noting that banks and orgs like Pay Pal hold suspicious transactions. Your bank will most likely call you if you randomly try to empty out your account.
The consumer protection agency here has actually been highly effective at tracking down scams and recovering money
When I get scammed in AUD I actually have recourse to act through the Aus consumer protection agency
You have to trust that whatever website you're using is legit and won't scam you
Not even true
Not right now, solving this without the introduction of a 3rd party is 100% impossible
If the cert is a legal contract then the 3rd party are the courts and government
OK, let's break this down to its simplest parts. Party A wants to exchange crypto for a car. If Party A pays in advance party B can not send the car. If Party B sends the car in advance party A can not pay. The only way around this is to introduce a 3rd party of some sort.
And, what if one party, get this, lies
Just send me your crypto and I'll sell you a bridge then. Part of the point of contracts is that they help to prevent scams.
Yes they do need to mediate. They need someone to ensure that whatever they're trading for is actually received.
It's not capable of the most simple regulatory processes that are required for the formation of a document that is worth any trust.
I hard disagree
Given the amount of scams that happen in the crypto space
In fact, it's an impossibility
Crypto isn't really capable of that either
Yeah
Nothing is capable of trustless contract enforcement. That's an oxymoron. A contract is inherently a document of trust.
Clothing and media in general have more value to society than crypto, which can be phased out in favour of traditional banking, a much less wasteful process and still leave every exchange possible.
It does
Yes
There are environmental impacts to hydroelectric, solar, wind and nuclear too. We shouldn't be wasting the power we generate from these resources on late stage capitalist garbage.
I'm well aware that there's still a metric fucton of issues with Keynesian economics, but it is a step forward.
Also, we need mass infrastructure now just as much as then
It's also to do with the fact that we used a far better system of economics predicated on Keynesianism rather than supply side garbage, feel free to ignore that though
45-70's was the most stable time economically.
I'm talking about the post war era
You think I'm talking about the 90's?
Have you heard of this political ideology that's gotten a bit pervasive called neoliberalism. It's been in place since before 2008 and one of its key components is deregulation of financial sectors. 2008 happened because of mass deregulation. Before Clinton banks were not allowed to give these sorts of loans. This was also enforced. Amazingly we managed to go, what, 25+ years following a more regulated, Keynesian form of economics (not that this is perfect, but it is better) without a major crash.
for decades
It kinda did
The only way to stop this is regulation against subprime loans
They also can't be regulated properly, which is the flipside. If people can make money off subprime loans (they can) they will.
Yes, via a deregulated system that will do exactly what the banks did because it drives short term profit. Subprime loans are a great way to make quick cash.
They have all the power, especially under neoliberalism
still gives us no way to do anything about it
So we'd be able to see the ways they fucked us
100% of the time
Disagree, if you automate them they WILL pull the exact same shit again
What you're talking about however has more to do with neolibralism and deregulation than banking structure. Government should be constantly in the business of banks telling them what they can and can't do. Crypto is actually a step back from a highly regulated banking sector.
Like, there's a lot wrong with the Aus market, but good govt policy actually kept us out of recession.
Speak for yourself, no bank here actually had issues in 2008.
This is still a good thing though
My dad did once, because he forgot to tell them he was going to the UK
I can safely say that I have never once had an issue withdrawing from a bank

<:LuL:789259461470322728>
*almost like a stock
If that causes your currency to crash it's on some shaky foundations.
This is like, going to happen?
*Tesla (via Elon) said they would no longer be keeping their money in bitcoin to cause the crash.
but not for this
He should go to jail
He broke exactly 0 laws
Why? there's no regulation. That's what crypto is
*by vs to
The fuck are you talking about?
30K would be a 20k crash
It could crash by 10k quite easily
I have no fucking clue what it's going to be at tomorrow
That's not stability though
not better
That makes it worse
it was at 66k earlier in the year
I mean
truly this is the picture of stability
56480 to 49106 in two days, a 13% drop in 48 hours
I wonder if any recent major yeetings of one of the largest economies in Europe out of the Euro maybe could have an effect on the value of the Euro, rather than looking at this from the perspective of the USD
it has negative stability
anyone's guess
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
as for crypto
and also, I'm fairly confident that the USD will not, any time soon be so inflated as to be unusable
Inflation is relative. Every other currency is inflating at almost the exact same rate.
yes
That's basically what the USD is
It's always possible
It will be possible
every decentralised system ever
like we've seen in
Unless one actor abuses the decentralisation to monopolise a resource
I don't think we can solve issues caused by deregulation and a lack of government intervention with more deregulation and a weaker government with less options to intervene. If you get your totally deregulated system it will end up monopolised and will end up as a tool for oppression.
it's a 50/50 thing, Apple's imposing their dumbassery here but it is Tumblr's fault that there's an underground drug market on the platform
fair point
yeah
Can't talk about suicide prevention but can get in contact with drug dealers. Real good job there Tumblr
https://twitter.com/punished3liza/status/1474971292835061760
They didn't ban ketamine though <:LuL:789259461470322728>
The banning of talking about suicide protection and safe sex is, to me the most concerning part here
At some point that factor becomes so overwhelming that there's no real choice left but to accept the political consequences of locking down. Plus, the Tories are really good at not having their own actions stick to them anyway
So would the continuation of a large outbreak or collapse of a hospital system however
Yeah, so a failure of leadership
Pretty much
The thing here is that leading under a continually worsening situation is also very politically unfavourable
What I think is likely is that if it keeps getting worse they'll have Boris do it and take the flack then swap leaders
actually, probably yes, they'll probably let him lead through the lockdown then knife him on the way out
Real question, will Boris be the PM who takes the UK into lockdown
This is mostly due to ideology more than anything. Liberal capitalism will always put the ability of the rich to control the lives of the poor over public health.
The west generally has handled this terribly though. Far worse than China
Merkel was key to blocking the movement to waive patents on vaccines
It's also very noticeable that Japan has a hefty lack of self awareness and denialism about former war crimes unlike a country like, Germany, as an example. Certainly not unique to them though.
I think this is missing the point in the same way a lot of people miss the point on racism. Japanese nationalism isn't individual most of the time. Yes, there are radical Japanese nationalists, but they're not the main problem. The problem is that institutions and society at a national scale are shaped in a way that supports nationalism. 

Also, you don't see the worst of it if you're of European descent. Japan will ensure that Europeans are kept to certain jobs and out of many sectors, but there's far less active discrimination against them. You see the worst of it if you're of Korean or Chinese descent. Japan's treatment of their Korean minority is quite well known to dip into blatant human rights abuses. 

These are things that seep into anime too. I watched the pilot episode of an anime recently with this on full display and it was a pretty disgusting example of reversal of victimhood. I think it's fairly understandable why anime is appealing to far right shitlords, Japan really does reflect back quite a lot of what they like.
They're not the same thing, but they're very interrelated
Patriotism is just a lesser form of nationalism. It gets people into thinking in a nationalistic mindset. Once you start to elevate certain aspects of your country you can easily become primed to start ignoring what it does wrong or discounting what others do right, which is where nationalism starts.
Nationalism and patriotism are deeply interrelated and nearly inseparable
I always find the idea of being proud of your nation, let alone your nations history kinda weird and nationalistic at a base line
I actually think if you want to talk about the most cancerous form of nationalism in Europe it's quite clearly English
The people who institutions have the largest effect on are often those with the least power to change them. Japan's nationalist institutions have huge impacts on minorities, who have very little political power to leverage.
I also think nationalists in Japan do hold a dangerous amount of political capital
That's one hell of a nonsequitor
Like
The thing that's strange to me is I talk about how institutions promote nationalism and you respond about how that's unfair to young people
Also Joim, an institutional analysis of how Japan's institutions promote nationalism isn't a sweeping generalisation, it's basic left wing political analysis.
They deny war crimes
Japan institutionalises nationalism in a very similar way to how the West institutionalises racism
Yes, but it boils down to being pretty much the same argument as "everyone I know isn't racist so my country isn't racist"
Joim, none of that has anything to do with the institutional analysis I posted before. And quite frankly I find it disturbing to have concerns about hypernationalism being promoted within the political system be called cultural imperialism when one of the effects of that ideology is the denial of actual imperialism.
Most western countries have far less nationalistic government policy than Japan.
Yeah, I still think you're utterly missing the point.
Two actually
Yep
American political trolling "wouldn't it be funny if we coded "fuck you biden""

Aus political trolling "our prime minister shat his pants at McDonalds"
Fucking bless
"The only thing I regret is that I couldn't drive a steak through her heart myself"
God, I love that old Scotish lady so much
Australians are much less afraid to just say what they think about politicians
I'm just reminded of the 70+ year old man who called Tony Abbott a wanker in national TV
It's not really a meme anymore
There's been a meme in left wing Aus circles for a few years now that the right forgets which nation they live in
Does this make sense to like, anyone?
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9120311/Protestors-waving-American-flags-march-MELBOURNE-chanting-Donald-Trump-four-years.html
I feel this one. Nationalism in Australia is such a huge and annoying issue. The even more annoying issue is that there's somehow rising US nationalism in Australia. No I do not understand how
Patriotic sports culture especially is just, bizarre
I think nationalism is actively dangerous while patriotism kept in check is just kinda weird
Or monorail actually
If you aren't you get sold hyperloop
My philosophy on futurism is basically that while it can be interesting to discuss you have to be very careful when someone's pushing futurist ideas
To be fair, futurism is an increasingly popular movement in capitalism too. Especially when it can be grifted off.
Remember one of Mussolini's goals was the reformation of the Roman empire for ethnic Italians. Under that lens the influences from the US become more obvious
Time being sus?
Mussolini wrote that it was one of the influences on his ideology however.
One of the original inspirations for Italian fascism was manifest destiny and the US's mistreatment of natives. This shouldn't be surprising at all.
And yeah, it's worth taking it to an IT guy, quite often it's just the reader that's borked, especially if it's HDD rather than SSD

NSW just jumped from 6.3k cases to 11k in one day
I'm sad that there's no vertically jawed ants left
It's more that we've put a lot more effort into researching apes and the human lineage so we know a disproportionate amount about it
To be fair though, most animal family trees look like that
Brave of you to assume we won't take ourselves out too
Also, the naming on the lower branch is such a confusing clusterfuck
That says more about how fragile the society we've built is than anything else
The one about Neanderthals, who were modern hominids and mostly removed from the evolution of Homo Sapiens (sans interbreeding)
That comment is very annoying as a biologist <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Never forgive Thatcher for basic existance.
I actually don't see the issue with this. You're asking the question in as leading way to get the result you want. It's not like Lemaitre's as well known as Darwin.
Fuck, look like it's time to go back

There's a joke about the Aus deputy PM
sure, it can be, but it also needs to be done at times
Yeah, I definitely don't think that the first is a good thing at all, but here I'm concerned about the increasing media centralisation into a few powerful social media entities that definitely have biases, I do think it's important for government to step in and regulate that.
Part of having a media licence is that you must publish these where possible.
We do in Australia under some circumstances. Redactions are an example of government mandated publishing, but there's also other examples like disaster warnings.
*I also don't agree that corporations should be given that right anyway.
Also, we restrict the ability of companies to publish/not publish things all the time. That's part of media law, there's really no reason why Twitter et al should get away from these laws
That example doesn't follow, because they don't agree with the content of Twitter's opinions defacto, they agree with the way they implement restrictions defacto.
Here's the issue with that, doing nothing is also a form of deciding what can and can't be published. They're defacto agreeing with Twitter etc terms of service as a sticks by which certain kinds of speech can be restricted if they do not step in and restrict social media corps.
See, that actually has nothing to do with what we're talking about. What we're talking about is if governments should step in and protect speech from corporations with outsized ability to control speech.
Not really? It's telling them they have to operate within a certain legal framework. It's just a slightly more extreme version of what the EU already makes social media do.
You could also enforce utility laws onto them so they're regulated in the same way as an ISP.
You get this strange feeling of "I almost understood that"
Listening to people speak Dutch is weird
Wouldn't know a thing about that
It's Icelandic by the way
There's a lot more to culture than just language
One can speak English, even as a first language and still be not culturally British, American etc.
wait, Iceland, the Nordic island nation that's almost always considered a part of Europe, has deep cultural ties to Scandinavia and is geographically located on the Eurasian plate?
One of the main traits of the projection is that it diminishes Africa and SE Asia, something colonialists weren't exactly unhappy about portraying
One of the original reasons it was adopted in Europe was settler colonialism though, it makes Europe and the more "important" colonies like the US and Canada look bigger while the nations Europe is exploiting look smaller and less important on a map.
The Mercader projection makes E/W distances feel larger and N/S distances feel shorter on net

Why is he the letter P?
going out of lockdown now would be a horrible idea for the Netherlands that could cause a gigantic surge in cases.
so no
Cases in the Netherlands have been on the rise recently. They're pretty much the worst they've been in spite of vaccination rate
I keep hearing the medical community say this is still a huge threat, I'm going to take their word over the media who've been trying to downplay Covid for the entire crisis
Vaush is like, the most toxic person on the left I've seen online honestly
Not that the internet being cut is good, but it's pretty telling that their solution is to have the oligarch crush resistance
My shitty ape is worth more than your human rights
it was just invalid
He didn't even have the wrong visa
Government tried to give him special conditions because he hits a ball well apparently but he still managed to fuck it up <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Djokovic getting turned back by Australian border force because he fucked up his visa is absolutely hilarious
If you can microwave it and not die you know it's safe
To be fair here, if this headline was written by someone less shit they may have pointed out that TNT is important in construction and surface level boring
Has the same energy as the gay rights bomber
it's a giant fucking grift
I think that's true for a majority of people selling NFTs in general
To be fair, I've seen a lot more people complain about Nintendo before consuming product recently. Not that Nintendo gives a fuck <:LuL:789259461470322728>
You could easily make the claim that the sale of the NFT was your right and they're depriving you of the right to sell your own art
not sure if it would hold up or not, but it would be hilarious to watch crypto bros try to twist their definition of "ownership"
I'm kinda just waiting for someone to bring up an art theft suit
Thanks, I hate it
also, I know it's Las Vegas but do they have to build every transport meme they can get their hands on <:LuL:789259461470322728>
which means you need the rollercoaster switch method
nope, it's a standard monorail
about that
Yeah
also the city deserves the pain of trying to install a branch on a monorail for building a monorail
Just one of those times where you have a system nearby and no matter how shit of an idea it was in the first place, it's probably better just to expand it
probably monorail
Looking at the area, and I can't believe I'm about to say this
Almost certainly should have just been something elevated
but uhhh, legit this is just a loop under the convention centre
It's a bad idea to put sports fans alone with anyone honestly, especially if they're drunk
Teslas are by far the worst mode of transit for drunk people though <:LuL:789259461470322728>
I'm actually pretty sure that the best use of that money if we're really going to focus on that corridor would be a protected bike lane and a bike hire program, because like
Then again, if there's one thing in character for LV it's irresponsible use of money
Yeah, they paid the cost though
Boring out a tunnel of that length is just super dumb. It's not even worth the cost to get a boring machine in. You'd be better off just doing a tram or elevated light rail
You can't fix American city planning <:LuL:789259461470322728>
A 1.3km metro would be, not very useful honestly
I always forget how absurdly tiny the trains in the UK are. I mean, maybe someone will try when the boring company goes insolvent but you'd realistically probably want to extend the line significantly anyway.
Most of the tunnels are also longer than 1.3km
Also, the underground has redundant safety measures built in every time they upgrade a line and highly specialist trains
The other issue is that the smallest light metro trains I know of are 3.4 meters tall. Most trams are actually bigger than this. The tunnel only has a diameter of 3.8 meters, once you account for the fact that you need to lose some of that because you need a flat surface to fit a train on, yeah, good luck.

You could have one custom made of course and it's totally possible there are far smaller ones I don't know of (I wouldn't be surprised if Germany has a random tiny train), but this is just an absurdly poorly engineered tunnel, it actually makes doing the things you'd need to do to make it less dumb hard.
*it shouldn't be up to standard for cars either, you can't really open doors up in it
that it's never going to be up to standards since for some reason rail is held to higher safety standards than road in the US
but like, the design is just so bad
Don't get me wrong, installing trains in the tunnel would drastically improve the safety
<a:NOTED:810618625903951933>
So the people inside just cook
if the train stopped in the tunnel you'd be trapped, so it wouldn't be fire safe
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
There's no access tunnel Iski
there shouldn't even be able to be cars in them really
you actually couldn't put a tram/train in them as they are because they're not up to safety standards
Turn them into a bikepath
Thanks for solving traffic Elon
and I don't want to see it, youtube pushes his shitty thumbnails in my face
It's just super annoying
Every couple of weeks I see him starting shit with some other random youtuber who's worth a hell of a lot more respect than he is

Whether Tennis Aus passed that information on truthfully is in doubt
They tried to use an exemption that the Aus government told tennis Aus was invalid
Or objectively the greatest human to ever live, Freddy Mercury
The Aus Liberals are a merger between the Free Trade and Protectionist party, which should tell you how important policy is to them <:LuL:789259461470322728>
They'll just go on and pretend it's not remotely an issue now
Tories world wide have mastered the technique of "ignore it until it goes away"
Also, he won't step down
"we can't lock down it will destroy the economy". Big brain move right here
and it's still better than what they did
if you're already on the monorail level of memes it's a small jump
They probably should have just leaned into being Vegas and moved people via rollercoaster
It gets garbage when you have two way track though
It's the only feasible way to design a switch on a monorail
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
That is actually what they do
Just the fact that there's a record means a corporation can identify you
Corps can work out approximately who's on their site by previous browsing habits.
Yeah, it's useless then
because it leaves too much of a busted system in tact
Even if you give the most generous interpretation of the goals of crypto, I don't actually think that a decentralisation of the current finance system is a good thing
The other uses are just more unneeded capitalist BS
Regardless of what you think of the early web it also had clear advantages
I'm disregarding a technology because I've only ever seen it used in destructive grifting and scamming
their vision for the future is completely antithetical to mine
I'm sceptical of anything that cryptobros try to sell
A better solution to that is government legislation around data harvesting like the EU is starting to do
Steering clear of things that people try to sell overemphatically is the best way to avoid scams
Yeah, about when it started getting pushed hard in the media so they could set up their pyramid schemes
Most of the money in crypto is sourced from rich bastards, it's venture capital.
I call it techwank because it's the same thing we've seen a thousand times before. Some "visionary" comes out with a shitty idea and milks the venture capitalists and tech for all they're worth before it's a complete catastrophe.
I feel like you put too much faith in techwank that's funded in no small part by the same corporations that you complain about.
Plus, Europe's not done yet, the laws are always a work in progress
or even detrimental in practice
Better than completely worthless in practice
Yet what Europe has done is still far more effective than this
I feel like all this is techwank obfuscation from what actually needs to be done
I think there's much more potential in regulating tech with a big stick than there is in digital solutions. The EU is already far better than most places when it comes to this and it's not like they're slowing down.
If it became common they would
Because right now it's not worth developing the analytics
Google has a truly absurd amount of information to work with. They will easily find ways to build profiles analytically no matter how much you try to scramble the data you send to them.
~~god I wish that was a joke~~
But then wouldn't google just build a profile around the key and like, not care at all? I really just fail to see how this does anything, because Google's still going to build a profile, they're still going to sell it to everyone and I'm still going to get random ads for Oreimo everywhere I go.
can just sell the info?
whoever holds the ledger
because like
Isn't a private ledger just worse in every way?
it's not anymore
Yes, and mining bitcoin was something that could be done on a toaster
The network would die due to funding issues within a week if the techdaddies pulled their savings out of the system
It really doesn't matter, if you can't trade it in at a fixed value for something else then it's a fiat
Also, just to point something out here a fiat is just a currency who's value is mostly theoretical. There is no requirement for government involvement for a currency to be considered a fiat and historically they have been managed by private organisations like banks. Bitcoin is still a fiat, the manager is a decentralised ledger. In every other way it's the same as other fiats.
Back to the point though, Crypto isn't this. It's a shitty stockmarketesk currency with no inherent value or link to anything that may be viewed as so.
You're making a point without a distinction honestly. Anarchists that I've spoken to have never made a distinction between types of currency and are generally just against it. And like, post capitalist ideologies are quite often against currency. It's really not that uncommon
Yes, but Anarchists are more hostile towards ideas like currency than Marx ever was
Anarchism isn't the only form of Marxism or even socialism without currency either, it's just the obvious one. It's actually an ideology that Marx wrote about
yes, although generally there's a strong preference towards not doing so as much as possible and currency still isn't favoured for this.
which is also why currency becomes nonsensical
Anarchism, at least in its purest form is highly cooperative and essentially works via pooling of goods rather than trade
not how you'd consider traditional trade
not really
Well, no
Anarchist, just anarchists
It's value is completely arbitrary and based off what people will pay for it
It's a fiat
anarchists certainly don't
A pure Marxist does not inherently accept currency
And no
Currency as it exists today, as a fiat is very much a more capitalist idea.
and this is how it started and closely connected to the main use case
It's a currency, it's capitalist, at least to a degree
Na mate, it's in the name
The capitalists control them all
You can't have liberation through capitalist means
No, it's an anticapitalist take
The vultures are inherent to our society. The idea that you can do anything without them is BS.
How do you think largescale mining operations have been running all this time and how do you think Bitcoin first surged in value?
The rich don't act as one block
the idea that you can have any market without the rich being involved is laughable
The vultures have always been there, they make themselves known when they want to be known
You say that like the rich are above scamming the rich
I just view this as rich people doing what rich people do and exploiting and draining wealth however they can
You need to generate that so suckers will buy in
The generation of a "culture" around crap monkeys can also be viewed through the lens of a scam too
The only reason you do that is to pump the price
If it was mostly vanity there wouldn't be a record of someone getting caught out transferring an NFT between two of their own personal accounts
at least the smarter ones
plain and simple
It's not vanity, they're scamming people
They have no legal basis
They're proof of the idea of ownership
not in any meaningful way
It's not
No
Even smaller markets need to be very heavily regulated if they're even allowed to exist
Not like crypto markets don't have their own share of highly immoral things going on, just look at the very existence on NFTs. The stockmarket is an unregulated shithole. I feel nothing wrong with comparing crypto to it. They're a match made in hell.
yeah, but the grift will be over then and people will stop acting like crypto was ever anything they said it was <:LuL:789259461470322728>
the network now requires the inflated price

It's probably the same, I just know here they still advise people to get vaccinated even if they've been positive at some point
You should probably still look into getting vaccinated after you recover Lily, from what I've seen it's still worth doing so.

<:ChrisYikes:679341065878241292>
While liberals can be pretty cringe, at least they're not "the south will rise again" types
There's a lot of things with pupil trackers that just haven't and probably can't be solved, like how they deal with cataracts
Also, just back to the original point, if you wanted to pick a country in Asia not deeply shaped by colonialism I don't think you could find a worse example than China. Between ancient Han expansion, South East Asia, Korea, the Mongols, Taiwan, Tibet and Japan, China has probably been involves in more colonialism on both sides than any other country in Asia
The main thing that set the British ships apart from the Chinese was their armaments
Man, thank God no empire ever did this again
Even if you have the resources there's a large delay in manufacturing and deployment, especially if your port cities have a small infestation of British Armardas. I know the Chinese actually did compliment western technology to a limited extent, but the fact is, the Brits had an insane number of boats and were not above using them for their own gain at the expense of others. A more organised China could have drawn out the wars, the naval disadvantage still would have ended up costing them them.
Naval projection was in fact, very important
You can sail down the Yellow and Yangtze rivers by the way
Gunboat diplomacy played a huge role here too though. Even had China had been at the height of it's power the British still had vastly superior naval technologies that China had no way to access. The unequal treaties were caused by this imbalance, not the economics or politics.
Also, China "fell behind" Europe at the behest of British armardas
But that doesn't change the fact that Europe's wealth was being derived from colonialism
Asia had colonizers and colonised nations too, in addition to complexities introduced by tributary nations like Siam and whatever was happening between the UK and China, which while exploitative wasn't quite colonialism.
Liberal capitalism relies on this
In this case it is an absolute. All major capitalist supply chains have roots in exploitative practice in poor nations.
And I'm sure it's just a coincidence that all the historical colonizers are pretty fucking rich while every nation that was historically colonised (other than settler colonial nations which are a whole different thing) are poor as hell.

Colonialism shaped the world's economy and must be noted in any theory of wealth.
It's also worth noting that colonialism also fed into the industrial revolution even being possible in the first place. The extra resources flowing into Europe allowed far more people to devote their time to sciences and crafts rather than feudal farming and basic things needed for survival making the revolution far easier.
And Britain used their new found technology to... immediately expand their empire to be the largest empire in human history because the real wealth was in colonialism.
I'm pointing out where the wealth of Europe was stolen from, even capitalists would agree at least in part with that analysis. It's fucking basic.
Europe as a continent exists on the back of wealth stolen during colonialism and also from neocolonialism. Even if a nation didn't partake in colonialism directly they still benifit through trade with others that did, especially if they at a later date joined the EU, filled with nations that enriched themselves through colonialism and continue to do so through neocolonialist practice.
Capitalism only builds wealth through colonialism and stealing of wealth from others.
There probably are, but it's a contradictory idea
And where did I ever say I support the USSR? The fact is, at current the only group that even mentions neocolonialism are socialists and related ideologies. Liberals are more than happy to just uphold the racist status quo set by both neocolonialism and colonialism 1.0
That is the legacy of liberalism
Sorry, it's a fact. Shitty capitalist systems uphold corporations like Nestle which operates modern slavery.
Capitalists are fine with the exploitation of workers in poor areas of the world to maintain their system and OK with upholding a system that disproportionately impacts minority workers by upholding the foundations of slavery and colonialism. I don't think you can actually be antiracist if you support a system that does that. You can perform antiracist, something that liberals love to do.
Because socialist theory is literally just what Marx said and has never evolved or adapted past that
Wait till he hears the socialist understanding of racism <:heh:789431887135113241>
That's the best case scenario
*or hopefully they're just cringy 15 year olds
Overt racism is pretty much the only way. People who hold the "slavery was good, actually" mindset are so far gone on this front that they can't be talked out of it too.
Arms exporting in general is fucking gross
That's how incredibly stupid it was
Every state an territory leader unanimously rejected the idea, even those from the Liberal party
Also, we had something similar here. The one day forklift saga where Scott Morrison suggested the age for forklift drivers should be lowered in the morning and by that night the idea was dead <:LuL:789259461470322728>
The problem with capitalists isn't that they need to outlaw child labour, it's that at the first chance they'll fucking backflip on it

Not with that attitude, we'll have it negative by 2023
Can we drive Bitcoin down to zero?
It went from Batman (no, not that one) to Cooper
We did the same thing here with an electorate recently
But yeah, China has throughout history been greatly exploited and been a great exploiter. This was one time where the former was clearly true. I don't see why any of this holds any special relevance to that point.
China's navy mostly scaled to be large enough to compete with whatever Japan or sometimes Korea had access to. They didn't really have a reason to compete with European fleets or even know what they were doing in most cases.
I don't think they could have made enough boats to the standard of British boats in a relatively short time frame. Nor do I think they would really have a reason to. We know in hindsite it's a good idea, but worrying about a borderline unknown empire coming half way across the world, destroying your navy and forcing you to sell opium isn't actually super sane.
Also if you did put all the guns on one ship it's the obvious target. Which means you need to spread them out. Which just makes all the logistics and management harder, plus you need more boats and more men to compensate. Basically China was just in a really shit position where they were trying to fight a naval superpower.
Then again, history repeats and we did see the exact same thing again with Banana Republics
A few hundred years early, but yes
Does any of this change the fact that they gave a cheese grater wheels?

mostly just taking the piss <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
I can strap wheels on a brick too, not convinced that's the future <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Can you explain this though?
That's pretty much what crypto does, it expands capitalism.
That's still a capitalist use case though
There's a gap here
The internet is used for exploitation, but unlike crypto its sole use isn't exploitation
I don't think it's good to give the assholes another way to exploit people. Any movement that pushes back against the expansion of exploitative capitalist programs, of which Crypto certainly is are a positive
It's almost like it's a youtube video existing in a capitalist framework
And, I'd disagree, but even if that were the case that doesn't excuse it and pushback is good
that doesn't excuse adding more garbage to the pile
It's all fucking garbage
I've pushed back against all this crap, micro transactions, ingame gambling, multiple price tiers for releases and exploitative paid DLC.
pushing back against any of this is good
It's the norm because people keep accepting more and more predatory practices from corperations
I don't want to see that shit normalised again
A new, incredibly predatory way for tech industries to monetise and exploit their customers?
the most honest creators actually admit this
and pretty much the entirety of youtube works on pure economics
It's a psychological thing, attacks are far better at convincing people than giving "neutral information"
Also, capitalism will never produce anything purely informational, that's not where the incentives are.
No, you're trying to convince people on the fence so they can pressure politicians to act. Crypto guys are gone, at least those hard into crypto. You might be able to convince someone with a few hundred in BTC, but anyone heavily invested isn't going to be convinced with anything. I don't see why this would be worse at convincing the guy with a couple of hundred in BTC, it's probably better just because it's far more likely to gain traction.
Neutral tones are terrible for convincing people
Almost everything on youtube is entertainment. With the exception of a few legit educational institutes who post, viewing it primarily as educational is wrong. That's a secondary effect at best.
They kinda do, they're pretty funny when well constructed. Important if you're making a 2hr video
Tonal neutrality is the way how "moderates" serve capitalists
Why, if something's obviously wrong it deserves to be condemned in the strongest terms
I guarantee you the responses to this are/were filled with people who used his own pfp to fuck with him
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
and that accelerates
then old users become less interested because the coin is losing all value
You lose the funnel of new users from mainstream coins
You're ignoring the social aspect
and I don't think other coins would survive BTC dying
I don't think BTC would survive a radical drop in value
yes, which then means that the main goal has been achieved
insurers don't want to lose money either
And if they start getting attacked insures stop insuring them against attacks
you won't make it
And no, because if your investment can quite literally go up in flames
It's not rouge states, it's activists
the goal of anyone who destroys infrastructure
That's, kinda the goal of action against large miners though, to imediately make investment less attractive
The thing is, some of them are so large that their destruction alone could put the chain into crisis mode
I'm well aware
Also, I think you're overestimating the resilience of crypto. What happens if people get pissed off enough, find the physical locations of large server farms that do the majority of the computing and start firebombing them? Or if a government, you know, cracks down, like China and Russia have. The thing is, the infrastructure for crypto isn't really that decentralised.
That doesn't even require blockchain though. That's literally what a fucking torrent is
Is that a good thing?
If I could convince 10 people to work under me for below minimum wage I could make a lot of money and live very comfortably
that doesn't make it good
a tiny percentage
Some working class people can always make money through exploitation
I don't care.
Still, I don't think it's inherently a bad thing. It would at least cull off a lot of crypto's popularity and pyramidness. And one exploitative stockmarket is better than two
Governments are in the pockets of the rich though
I actually think being regulated as stocks is a fairly likely future for crypto
it is
but in the case of anything financial
sometimes that's not a bad thing
A decentralised anything kind of means that you're going to see far less regulation
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
Creates an unregulated market, complains about the rich
If you want to know what the average person thinks, look at media coverage of crypto
We still know far more about crypto than the average person even if we're against it
The average person gives 0 fucks about crypto
Have you though?
In crypto spaces maybe, but like, doge is a fucking decently known meme
they don't even know what it is
Most people only know meta as the facebook thing
Not really
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Hearing BTC crashed may as well be hearing crypto itself crashed
I think you're na√Øve. The only coins most people know about are BTC, Doge and Etherium
just saying
have a vested interest here
probably
also, people invested into coins other than BTC
at no point did that make it true
The science community has been full of people saying fusion is 20 years away for 80 years now
So like, my actual conclusion here is that the rich like crypto, won't see it gone, will regulate to favour themselves
they could do a lot of damage
I'm just pointing out that if the rich wanted it gone
I agree with that, that's why I said the most likely outcome is it's regulated as a stock
You say that like the US isn't absurdly autocratic
Are the ones that have already acted
like China and Russia
and the countries the US doesn't have control over
You say that like the US doesn't have damn near global control, that's the actual issue here. As much as I disagree with that, if the US wants it gone, it's finished
If miners are forced to flee and there's no ability to legally trade at all it could happen
It might not literally die, but we could be talking about sub dollar bitcoin that's a dead investment again
The point is, if the rich actually wanted rid of crypto, it would be very heavily repressed
I mean, it wouldn't though, it would be way more repressed than in the early days
Something tells me that crypto doesn't maintain its current usage or value
What do you think happens if the US puts out the call that there's going to be a wide scale crackdown on crypto though? Trading, mining, etc are going to be illegal both in the US and across their empire.

The people who lose money on crypto normally aren't tech heads
States could stop crypto super easily if they wanted, or at the very least force it so far underground it may as well not exist
Look at what capitalists have done to unions
Do you think crypto would be allowed to exist if it actually did that?
That's horseshit, tons of regular people have lost gigantic sums of money on crypto
Also
Here's what I'm pointing out at the core, capitalist modes of redistribution are bad
some people get virtually no life improvement while others could be plunged into debt for life
I mean, in some ways that's even worse
For one person to win big many have to lose small
Kinda is
that's the point
There are always less winners than losers
Why is that a justification for the redistribution of wealth from many to one potentially leaving the many destitute?
you have to sell before they do to claim on their investment
That's how you're gaining money in crypto, other people's investments
Crypto works by stealing value from and exploiting others
Large warehouses are normally built very close to highways specifically to exploit the highway network. In countries which rely more on freight rail like Switzerland freight companies do literally the exact same thing but with the rail network
So's a highway. It's just been paid beforehand and the one who pays the upkeep is the state
Even then, large cities usually, at least here have freight moving internally by train too
Rail into warehouses is the most efficient way to move freight from city to city. You should be able to move freight around a city without highways.
They're an inefficient way to freight too
I actually completely disagree with that. Highways are an absurdly inefficient way to move people around, they have major environmental consequences that far exceed those of any other mode of transport other than perhaps domestic air travel and are the least pleasant form of infrastructure to be anywhere near.
Trains are far quitter than highways are, at least when they're not complete garbage
or dumb stuff like that
There's no need to erect a sound barrier right next to the line
It's not
I live next to a train line
Doesn't that say more about how problematic the existence of highways are than anything else?
Drivers should be forced to understand the amount of noise they generate
It's a good idea though
Auto lobby says no <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Cider
or consumer refund laws
Stuff like cracking down on pyramids and scams
Having said all that though, some financial regulations are certainly positive regardless of their intentions
Certainly not under neoliberalism
later union regulation has been garbage though
Unions have gained and lost a lot of power based on the regulations of the time, but early union regulation was one of the few times government was forced to actually act to protect the interests of the people
Remember, the government fucking let them
Without regulation you get the Standard Oil Massacre
I have jasmine tea that I quite like
It's still better than what they'd do if there was none though
Literally forever regulation has favoured the rich, as long as there's been regulation
A private rail line is better than none existing at all
They'd be in a far better place
Imagine if the US took all the money it wastes on highways every year and put that into a wide reaching freight and passenger rail network
If you're going to subsidise you should be subsidising only the most efficient methods
It tells you where things need to go
The thing is, your highway network is already a rail blueprint
Replacing intercity freight with rail is actually quite easy, use of rail freight is already more common across the world than using highways between cities
in a way that trains don't
also, it doesn't solve the problem of trucks destroying the infrastructure they rely on
It's energetically insanely expensive to produce
Do you know what the downside of anything polymer based is?
like steel rails
Yeah
There are really fast freight trains
I mean, that depends on how you set up your freight network
Also, I just want to point out that the bitumen used to repair highways carries a very high environmental cost relative to the wood and steel you'd use to repair a freight line, if you even bother since freight can be allowed to just move at 10km/h
at bare minimum
Also, we could easily replace every highway with rail and warehouses on both ends
Freight heavy logistics grids already exist though
especially if you're freighting at slow speeds
because it's a lot more durable
Or like, use rail
plus they're environmentally quite expensive to manufacture
Battery trucks shred highways even worse than ICE since they weigh more and don't drop weight as they burn petrol
not really?
so like, freight trucks are 100% unviable if they have to actually pay for the damage they cause
Kinda, the difference would be that vehicle weight would play a huge part.
freight companies would immediately start looking at other options and the cost to drive on highways would be pretty unusable
make drivers pay maintenance for the damage they do to highways
To be fair here, there is actually a soft incentive that would totally work
Soft incentives can be very effective. They've pretty much canned Australia's previous high smoking as an example. Regardless, I did just say also legislate the externality. We shouldn't be allowing road use cases which are detrimental to society.
I'm not saying just blow out peoples ears, if this is done it should obviously be done with other, wider changes on road law
The larger point here is, if cars can do that to people inside of them they can also do that to people outside who do not have the benefit of sound dampening. Removing the sound dampening forces us to be more realistic with the restrictions that are placed on drivers to keep them in line with what doesn't cause societal damage.
Also, even if people have the right to drive, which I'd question on environmental grounds that doesn't lend them the right to a very specific, expensive, inefficient and environmentally destructive piece of infrastructure.
Even most smaller scale warehouses are connected to a rail spur though
There are laws in Switzerland that regulate the size of a warehouse and what sort of rail connection they need based on that
I didn't know that one
Also, yeah they really did learn their lesson because they gave a government owned company a near majority over metro <:LuL:789259461470322728>
But I also recognise it could be a lot worse, the government learned the lesson from Connex and keeps a pretty tight leash around Metro. They're pointless, but they don't do too much harm.
Like, I'm for the renationalisation of our trains
yeah, but there's still more or less responsible ways to do it
"we can totally run the line using three shoestrings and boost ridership by 50000%"
Yeah, companies just gave the UK government BS figures about how well they could run the line
but that's a whole different issue
They're not
Metro just gets a big tick and the govt. says "you're doing well enough, we don't need to replace you, keep running everything"
It's not though, in the UK they had to compete for the lines individually
Basically it's just a public company but they skim a little extra off the top
There's just no competition. Every line is operated by metro trains Melbourne
We do have required runs though
It's hard to make it less viable
Also, as shitty as the British private rail service was, there's a lot more to what killed it off than just the privatisation. It also has a lot to do with subsidised routes always being a huge problem for the rail network since the companies running it loved to play hot potato with them since they lost money. This often wound up with the government just running those routes anyway. There was also the onset of Covid basically causing every rail company working the British line to attempt to sell their holdings at the same time.

Rail privatisation is a shitty idea that shouldn't be done, but it can be more viable than in the UK, unfortunately. Over here we've had the whole "private operator, public lines" thing going on since the 80's. The lines are all operated by 1 operator rather than many as in the UK and none of the lines are as underused as the ones in the UK due to the way our network is designed. I don't know how a private company is meant to be helping us here, but it's set up stable enough to not fall flat.
The trucks that I think we really don't need are most of the giant 18 wheelers, in the vast majority of cases smaller distribution vehicles to move things from warehouses to shops and such. In the case of larger shops you may still need some large trucks, but why exactly would they need a highway? It should be possible to use a modern, electric freight grid to move supplies to a local warehouse.
My argument would agree with you there Kat, but trucks in their best use case don't need highways. They need to be smaller endpoint distribution that uses more local roads, the humble van is the best truck.
What if you're paying $10 for fuel but the government decides it doesn't need to maintain roads
There is freight, but it's pretty pathetic
Yes, but the US literally tries to use trucks for everything
I think those are all pretty much the same
I don't think it matters to the average person if they pay $10 to the government, $10 to a petrol shop or $10 to a private rail company
I think it's pretty much the exact same. Also, in many countries the tracks are still publicly owned even if the operators are private
I disagree
Is it any better?
not traditional privatisation, sure
There's just a different middleman making money off of you in a different place
It's just a different cost
Roads are already kinda private anyway, you have to pay in the price for a car and fuel to actually be able to use them at all
You might just want to post whatever was there here, I don't think I'd have anything to actually say about it though
yep

Which is the thing that actually stops liberalised economies growth
When I say "small", I specifically mean small enough for western industry to move in and start exploiting a country for their resources and population
Nationalised economies grow far faster than liberalised ones though, especially when the starting size is small.
well, yes, that's the biggest issue
Most economists wouldn't recommend that either, but there's actually a proven track record for it working, so <:02shrug:443257729646198784>
What they actually needed to do is what other South American countries have actually done to grow their economies. Cut ties with the IMF and nationalise a whole lot of industries. Was working pretty well in Bolivia before the whole coup thing.
Big surprise the techbro solution isn't doing so great though
There's other logistical reasons why introducing bitcoin to a generally underdeveloped economy isn't a great idea
Even a lot of more sane bitcoin guys were calling it a terrible idea
No economist would recommend what El Salvador did, it was just a massive dumbass move
The whole El Salvador thing was dumb as fuck though
The existential threat is climate change
It's not an existential threat, but it is more of a threat
Millions have died already, which is far more than anything Russia/Ukraine will amount to
I have serious doubts about that
Covid is much more important than Russia/Ukraine in terms of threat to the human race, let's be honest. But even then.
Sure, but like, Hasanabi still has 1m Twitter followers
which is part of the reason I was confused
Also I really doubt the 1k twitter follower guy is the largest Republican streamer
The context made no fucking sense to me
Also, claiming to be antifascist while supporting US imperialism really is something
yeah, just cringe US hypernationalism
take a guess
Their profile has eagle emoji in their name
I'm literally struggling to break down what you're saying right now though
Kat, do you actually think this account you linked has good takes? Because they seem to be absurdly pro-intervention to the point where they're actually advocating for intervention in Iran, you know, the exact thing that caused the issues with Iran
Imagine actually being openly pro war <:ChrisYikes:679341065878241292>
It's not like companies have ever gave a fuck about societal health
Yeah, I don't think it would be a good idea to leave unless you're sure you won't need to come back
I just hope it's soon, I'm sick of hearing about NFTs
I really doubt anything will happen though
It feels like France and Germany have set themselves up to play the role of the "sit down and talk like adults" guys if anything does flare up to me at least

Don't be, everyone's just glad to see you back
That seems a touch excessive
Sure, but like, 1000x?
The thing is, what China is doing is kinda just a slightly lesser version of what the US is doing. It's fucking shit. It's nothing new. Great power reporting will do it's propagandising though
China is like, the most wild nation in history when it comes to exploiting and being exploited
I do support globalisation, but globalisation under capitalism will always be exploitive to the extent that global protectionism is favourable to it
China is less aggressive globally than the West is and far less engaged in economic warfare. They're not a good nation by any means, but acting like were better is laughable
No, I'm writing here because dominance has been established, that's not balance
I really don't view the world economy as balanced in any way
I'm curious, what balance?
And to be fair, the only one of these things that I could see any capitalist nation doing would be taxing carbon and even then it's going to be complete BS
It, again depends on other policy. You could do it in very specific cases where you've already made it very hard for international companies to compete in your market, or if you've done the big brain thing and nationalised your market so you just don't have to worry about your companies leaving
Tariffs are probably more realistic because they're fairly simple and can be implemented unilaterally without just culling off your companies if other nations dont
Trade tariffs are one way that a situation where it is equally expensive can be created, yes. There's also other ways this could be managed such as taxing the carbon used in the creation of a good which would serve to make areas with more green energy and lower total amounts of shipping more attractive. There's also this crazy idea where you enforce that your corporations just pay your minimum wage wherever they operate.

The point is that they have the powers to create the situation that the capitalists operate under, this is what they chose.
I should probably explain what I think a bit more here, I think corporations, the ones doing the exploitation are operating on a primarily capitalist framework. Yes, if it was cheaper to exploit local labour they would. The ones who operate on a far more colonial framework are world governments, specifically in the West. These governments are generally more interested in power than ideology and they've landed on capitalism as a way to cement and justify that power, but the reason they're more interested in colonialism is because it directly serves to increase their relative power. They create the situation where it's cheaper to exploit elsewhere than locally. When it's politically expedient we see countries like the Nordics reign in capitalists somewhat, but they still support that exact same global neocolonialist framework. Their companies follow the same capitalist first framework just with more regulation, at least at home.
I think there's elements of both. I really do think the West has a large interest in making sure the colonialist status quo is continued for powers sake
Capitalism is propped up by neocolonial exploitation of labour in the global South and derives the vast majority of its wealth from it. It's not not colonialism just because it's corporations doing it rather than states
Capitalism is actually completely reliant on colonialism
Colonialism is one of the most important things to understand in order to actually understand modern capitalism Iski, I actually think there's a slight reversal here, colonialism drives capitalism, global capitalism is mostly a way for nations to just continue the colonial status quo in a way that's politically acceptable to most people. The military is just a back up.
Bad actors and corruption literally always exist, this is why the best systems we've come up with work to minimise, increase transparency around and redirect them
To be fair though, I actually think corporations would behave somewhat less terribly if they had worker distributed decision making rather than autocratic.
I generally don't think the existence of a region without a centralised body could be stable. It only takes a tiny percentage of bad actors to really start destabilising such a system.
That's capitalism
They don't even think about how their actions impact others
Corps at least consider long term consequences for themselves before ignoring them
Corporations aren't ignorant or stupid, they just have perverse incentives that cause them to make decisions that have dumbass long term consequences
And lock up executives who knowingly abused human rights while mining it
It would also be nice if we could inject some human rights standards into it's mining
I think you missed the point. Large battery applications like mass creation of electric cars are inequitable and wasteful. It's actually better we treat the lithium we have as a limited resource and use it where it's more valuble
Although, we should honestly be attempting to reduce reliance on all cars
*I'm talking primarily about electrics
You can, if you put in effort, recycle lithium from phones and other bateries
The actual issue is bigger electronics with larger batteries like cars
No, what I want to do is use what lithium we have access to more equitably. Which actually probably means using more of it on phones
Also there's no guarantee that any of these solutions work, so we do need to be looking at alternatives that we're sure will
The issue I have with talk of new batteries as a solution here though is that it's a very capitalist way of thinking. Rather than reducing consumption we'll just find a substitute. Pretty much the reason why the environment is inevitably fucked
It does mean that you're not being payed by capitalists though Mel
Yeah, magnesium actually has some chemical advantages in batteries
Also, most research scientists work at state funded universities
They also have a vested interest in acting like they're close to a solution
The thing here is that, from my understanding capitalists are much more certain they'll find a solution the the problem than scientists are
Sodium is actually a great example of why lithium is so hard to beat, it holds the same charge capacity, but the charge density is tiny compared to lithium.
I've heard but my understanding of chemistry says they're in for an uphill battle
Bless grey markets
Battery is the largest issue with it, but I can get it swapped and have in the past
I must have bought it around 2014 or so
My phone is an S6
I've been holding onto my old phone for as long as humanly possible. The cell phone industry is pretty disgusting and I'd prefer not to support it as much as I can. But I need one to live and no ethical consumption.
I took it in a slightly different way, I'm able to write here because of exploitation. The phone I'm writing on as well as part of the power and internet grid are part of an exploitative power. This isn't achieved through balance or fair trade, it's achieved through domination.
Some things aren't. That's the issue with that idea. Some things are just terrible, or just 100% needed
I do agree with Mel that a status quo will always be reached
I think the issue here is the multiple definitions of "balance" Mel is using it in the status quo type way, I used it in more of a "just balance" type of way
Honestly, the best case is that NATO agrees to cease adding nations bordering Russia. It's absurd how aggressively NATO has been posturing towards them
Their position around the Ukraine right now has more to do with trying to bargain than anything else
See, the other issue here is that NATO is a thinly veiled anti Russia coalition
And they do have a right to be pissed off about it
Because that's what NATO is trying to do to Russia right now
And I'm not saying the Warsaw pact is good. But let's imagine an alternate reality where Russia starts pulling more and more nations into the pact, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands all join, would this be an act of aggression towards France?
Especially when NATO is defacto lead by a belligerent superpower with a history of invasions
And Russia's right, a foreign defence pact pushing the entire way up to your border like this is aggressive, no matter which way you slice it
has that ever stopped the US?
OK, serious question
That's revisionary Kat, he won the runoff (and got there in the first place) with direct, US intervention.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/06/26/russian-election-interference-meddling/
Yeltsin was deeply indebted to Clinton and the US and often acted on their behalf
It's just a coincidence that his ideology perfectly aligned with Clinton's and that the US actively and illegally funded his campaigns then
Yeltsin was also a US backed puppet who won the election off of illegal US interference. He's insanely unpopular in Russia and backlash against and consequences from his politics is pretty much the reason Russia is as it is now. Probably not the best person to cite.

Yeah, when politic theorists in the 20th century talked about politics they put social democracy as the centre and communism was only considered as far left as conservatism was far right. Really says a lot.
basic social democratic policy being labelled as socialism and degraded by the media while liberal policy is considered the default has really destroyed US politics
Also, the fact that the US considers liberals to be left wing is absolutely insane
A lot of it is cultural. The US left is pretty willing to support a centre right party in a way the left in other countries just wouldn't. Even in countries where the left is pretty weak with a FPTP voting system like Canada you have a legit centre left party.
Biden debating himself is more likely than the democrats acknowledging 3rd parties existence for any reason other than shaming their voters.

Imagine being the first person the Nazis would have targeted and then saying, "this right here, I want this system"
~~also fuck me Mexico is a part of North America you doltzes and you can't just remove it to make the US look better~~
I'm always sceptical of that index, it has a huge political bias in what "democracy" actually is. There's really no world where Russia is more democratic than Cuba or Vietnam, because like, democracy is more than just elections and those countries have other forms of democratic inclusion which sets them far above a country with nothing but sham elections, I'd also argue in many ways better than the west where you can just buy a politician.
I have no clue where this started

Old political meme
also, very heavily implying (and in one case confirming) that it's less "sleeping" and more "passing out due to alcohol consumption"
<:heh:789431887135113241>
I believe he did it, just following his leader

What the fuck? There's something seriously wrong with politicians in this country

Mum, Elons being incompetent again
Personal PoV on this is that there's not really anything bad about them, certainly not any worse than alcohol. The "bad vibes" come from sociatital bias ingrained over years of demonisation rather than anything solid.
No reason to bully him for anything else, everything he does is cringe <:LuL:789259461470322728>
yeah, by that same logic a drum role which can only contain rhythm/beat isn't music, but songs composed of pure drum beats while not super common do exist
also, in what world does rap not have any of those aspects anyway. It utilises them in a very unique way that other forms of music don't, but they're still there
*I know there's a whole lot more than that, beat is just a fundamental compositional part of music
As someone who plays some drums, completely ignoring beat is pretty obvious and yikes
but yeah, he's impossible to take seriously
Ben Shapiro's "Imagine" video is on of my favourites on Youtube, because he somehow manages to get destroyed by a musician who's been dead for years and it's honestly impressive
So they're socialist in the same way as the Democrats <a:NOTED:810618625903951933>
so no, not really
Czech Republic's gun homicide rate is 3x higher than the UK's
Also, <@!228659769404030976> I just wanted to bring something up with relation to gun laws, they're highly effective. The US has a murder rate that's about 5x higher than the average Western European country or my home nation of Australia. Gun control isn't the only reason for this, but it is a reason. So when you ask if I'd like to live in areas with more gun control the answer is an emphatic yes. I want to live in areas where I'm less likely to be shot, which isn't really anywhere in the US other than perhaps Honolulu. Even cities that are normally cited as bastions of gun control in the US have woefully inadequate gun control. I really don't plan on ever owning a fire arm either so I see no reason why those laws would even impact me.
It makes sense
The grifters don't want to be associated with other grifters
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
The sudden realisation on that last one is great
There's relatively few people who will go bankrupt over a few percent, it's worth it to them to do this
Because credit score is a system devised by the loaners to maximise their own profit, so yes, they want you to pay more
and there's no such thing as someone without societal bias, the best anyone can do is attempt to understand their own societal biases
That's true of many things that aren't illegal. My argument is more "there's nothing inherently bad about them", not "there's nothing that can go wrong"
The media has been quite active trying to demonize both
even if that wasn't true though it wouldn't prove anything, it would just mean that there's more media demonization of Russia than China.
Western media screams it from the rooftops with a megaphone at every chance
Are you joking?
This is literally the best example of manufacturing consent in media I've ever seen.
The point here though Pug is that there is a lot of bad shit that China does, but there's also a really healthy amount of media manipulation at work here. The things China does aren't really worse or better than what the west does, they're pretty similar. But the media highlights anything bad that's done in China to the point of uncritically buying into organ harvesting conspiracies while very rarely reflecting and reporting on what we do.
Or you know, Gitmo
is literally worse
Australia's asylum seeker system
China isn't my model society at all
acting like it's worse than what the west is doing is absurd
Yeah, it's shit
it's not a good thing, but it's also not the Orwellian nightmare it's made out to be
Social credit as it's viewed in the west is mostly a media pushed conspiracy. If you look up what it actually is it's basically a more limited version of the US credit system.
They're no more fascist than the US is
There is a large gap between China and a fascist state still
The PCR aren't fascists. They're not socialists or good. They're just state focused capitalists doing exactly what you'd expect that ideology to do
China gives 0 fucks about Russia, they're doing this to clout chase/so they can act like they had an impact when Russia does back off
and it's part of a militarism problem
That's called manufacturing consent
If your country is so wound up that they think a tornado is a missile then it's not a war panic, it's a militarism problem.
but yeah, stats are still the best thing to go off
I'm just saying I wouldn't be surprised if there's differences in the way countries record this stuff. It's pretty common in statistics to have slightly different definitions that change the way how the stats end up. The UK seems to have strangely low numbers of suicide compared to countries with fairly similar policy.
I still think that the best policy is heavy restriction of guns similar to Japan and South Korea and I'm glad that Australia is continuing to pass more laws to bring us closer into line with them
but I also think that's true of many countries honestly
To be fair, I think it is quite likely the UK is under reporting
Not homicide however
https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/gun-deaths-by-country
I have statistics for Czech gun deaths
If they implemented a system like the UK's they'd be better off.
Hard disagree, the Czech Republic's lax gun laws still lead to unneeded deaths
But they make up 3/4 of the UK's gun deaths and 10/11 of the Czech Republic's
yes, they are in most countries
Their gun death rate is 10x higher due to a drastically higher gun suicide rate
We can and should have a bloodless transition to a better state
That's what unions and strikes are for, not guns
Also End, I am a communist aligned socialist living in a liberal capitalist country arguing against guns right now. I have no power and I still don't want them because this isn't about a political goal. It's about the fact that I don't want people to die unnecessarily.
Dude argued Columbus did nothing wrong
Please don't link KB as an unbiased source
Australia's list is almost the exact same Pug
I'm aware, that's actually the point I'm making
because those shitty laws could be enforced without guns
Our police aren't militarised because our population isn't armed
They happened here too
The war on terror/drugs were worldwide things you know
It also may interest you to know that 3 of the 4 viable parties at the time voted through Howards bill. Labor, The Liberals and the Democrats all supported it. The only party who didn't were the far right Nationals.
I support it because the end outcome is good
Because I don't just support gun control for partisan reasons
No, it doesn't make me think at all
The only good thing he ever did was his gun legislation and I'm happy to say I 100% align with him on that issue.
Like, I fucking despise Howard with a passion, I think he's a bottom 3 PM in Australian history
I'm a socialist so I actually align with the Panthers on most things. But just saying you're anti "x" and you'll side against them in every case is a terrible way to think about politics. In this one case Reagan was right even if his reasons for doing this were cynical. More gun control is a good thing.
They were right about a lot of things, this wasn't one of them
and the fact that it's a terrible idea is ultimately why I think the Black Panthers were utterly wrong when it came to fire arms
unless you think shooting a cop is a good answer gun possession doesn't fix this
the armed population and militarised police force are interlinked and this has deadly consequences for minorities in the US
the consequences of bad decisions are made worse by guns
I know that's not a popular opinion amongst US leftists, but I'm not one and I have an international perspective on this
I actually believe that the use and advocacy for guns in the US has been a factor (not the only factor) in the oppression of US workers
I literally don't fucking care, I think they're wrong
and guns are part of that distraction. Just another cultural issue that politicians can use to get people to side with their own oppressors
They cracked down on unionisation and used propaganda to spread the idea of a free state while oppressing the workers within the country
The US didn't
Arming your society really does nothing to stop oppression, especially when those most armed benefit from the oppression, or at least believe themselves to
Also, if an armed society is harder to oppress why is the US far more oppressed in pretty much every way than Europe?
China didn't expand on FICO, social credit is actually less extreme overall
This argument runs into reality problems though. It's just safer when fewer people have guns regardless of if they're law abiding or not. The whole law abiding argument seems strange to me however, because it's the law of South Korea to not have guns as an example, so a law abiding/gun wielding citizen is a contradiction.
Probably the part of China that's the most problematic is its imperialist core and Mongolia is a definite victim of that. Having said that the Chinese imperialist core is nothing compared to the US
China actually does have something to do with this one
The Dems do a lot of nothing and sit on old republican precedents allowing them to fester most of the time
So the outcomes?
Also, rather than looking at "actual policy" (not quite sure what this is meant to mean) or "platform policy" I'd suggest looking at "policy outcomes", because the fact is the best thing to describe the outcomes that are seen in the US (and most of the west) is the ratchet effect, which presupposes that both parties mostly work towards the same goal as one of its main ideas.
I think the two parties policy is very, very similar in most ways. The differences are mostly there to divide the country rather than to provide noteworthy differences
I don't really think it matters
So, counter argument, there is very little difference and this isn't the horseshoe theory they're just both far right neoliberal capitalists who serve the same ultimate endgoal
Russian election meddling was one of the most minor aids in Trump winning and pretty insignificant overall. Bigger issue is probably that so many people hate both parties
yeah, a lot of dems need to hold on to the belief that Donald Trump was never actually elected because they want to hold that more "moderate" stance and a belief that Trump legit won destroys that
that's pretty yikes
Oh, and the whole portrayal of Chinese people as basically just robots who serve the state
Matt these are the same people who unironically call Biden a socialist
And they define communists as anyone left of Reagan
Communists
And they're not fucking wrong
They consider the police on their side
That's why the "freedom" protesters look so confused when cops start applying 1/10th of the pressure they'd apply to a left wing protest to them
Because they have no real reason to clash with them 90% of the time
I'll never understand why
The Queen has Covid apparently
even still
Vietnam and Cuba are the two the left should actually support, because they're actually pretty good all things considered
Yeah, the Vietnam war is actually the easiest moral conflict of the cold war
Also, Vietnam is a lot more complex than most Americans think. Ho Chi Minh was extremely popular across all of Vietnam and aligned the military, population and government towards the same goal. Ho Chi Minh had the backing of the entire country including the military in practice. It was actually quite common for south Vietnamese soldiers to defect to the north at the first opportunity. The American military were viewed as an invading force, because they kinda were. Even in the south they were quite unpopular. But it's not just a population rising up against the US. It's an entire fucking army. The Vietcong were technically what you say, but they had the backing of the north Vietnamese army.
there's so fucking many
Or the Chilean coup
is a good example
But yes, the failed revolution in the Congo
just the whole thing
like
Colonialism
<:This:920292459571998720>
I'm pointing out that what you said is highly America centric and complete BS
not to mention, they were supplied by the USSR
Do you have any idea how well co-ordinated and trained the Vietcong actually were?
what?
...
Armed revolutions without the military in the modern age are impossible
Also End, even if there was an armed revolution how do you think anyone with civilian guns can do anything to a tank
that's one of the references
Leaders do things like ramp tensions/war to benefit a very small slice of wealthy elite. This BS doesn't benefit the regular people on either side of the border
my bad on that one
yeah, you can speak Russian and not be a part of the Russian nation
Oh, I mixed up terminology there. Russophone, not Russophile
Australia's a shithole and I think the government falling would be a net good for the world
hell no
People die for political fictions all the time
Of course, none of this changes that nations, as used in common parlance to refer to nation states are political fiction
Assuming there's more distinctions than just that, which I feel is most likely the case then that isn't really true
The Irish and the English have a set of cultural distinctions separate from just the simple separation of the two countries into two different states. Even the English and the Scots have a set of cultural distinctions that effectively make them separate nations under the same state. I made no actual claim about the closeness of Russian/Ukrainian culture, because I have no fucking clue at all. What I'm pointing out is that if the distinction between the two is separation than anyone who doesn't want that is effectively not a part of the nation.
Kat, by the definition you just gave a "Russophonic Ukrainian" is just a Russian because the distinction is seperation
*even subsumed into Russia a Ukrainian nation would continue to exist in the same way as various indigenous nations across the Americas and Australasia. A nation and a state don't have to have the other to exist. Which is why that definition of nation doesn't seem to fit here.
Also, to be clear here I'm using the word "nation" to mean the modern understanding of a "nation state" just to simplify things. Nation states and states are 100% political fiction, nations in the strictest definition that most people don't actually use can be a cultural identity that does exist, but that doesn't seem to be what we're talking about here since the concern seems to me more on the state level
Where do you draw those lines though? That's highly arbitrary and almost everyone would disagree.

Also, some nations don't exist based on identity really. A really good example of this would be Australia and New Zealand, where at least the settler colonists in both nations are pretty much identical and it's actually just a mistake of history that they're not currently one nation. And on the other hand the native populations of both would also have very strong claims to independence in both cases.

Australian political satire is so many layers deep at this point that it must just look like nonsense to most people <:LuL:789259461470322728>
it's not a good justification for an invasion or anything, but it is just a fact
All nations are geopolitical fiction <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Of course, there is the issue of how applicable this method is. Different people have different impulses around different things, so realistically this is probably just testing impulse control in this singular, hyper focused area
If you just take a large number of participants irregularities like that get flattened out
It wouldn't have to
Afganastan is fucking hard to justify
This is a geopolitical conversation.
Or at least attempting to
The US has a long history of going into any nation it doesn't like, invading and toppling the government
The US is Russia but with better propaganda and a global reach
What the fuck do you think Vietnam and Afganastan were?
The US is still involved in the bombing of citizens in Yeman, so yes, literally all the time
Pug, the issue here is that the US commits atrocities far worse than Russia on a global scale all the fucking time
For the world to move forward the entire idea of global hegemony needs to die
There can't
No
If the US wanted to stop abuses and atrocities it would start by removing it's own government
It's not the US's place to decide who leads other nations and deposing of other nations leaders has never ended well.
Seriously, fuck off
And we should want not to involve ourselves in unneeded conflicts
Hard disagree, shit like this makes any talks that do happen harder
I wouldn't either but the point is that it actually seems to be counterproductive under basic analysis
That's why this feels more like an own goal to me than any form of reasonable argument, which is dumb because it's not hard to make a reasonable argument here.
Yeah, no shit. It's not like it's any of the modern states but using it to argue a distinct identity feels pretty weird.
Ironically Kiev is one of the three most important cities in Russian history <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Considering the fact they were literally considered to be a part of the same state for a good time
I think it actually works against that point if you know anything about the region's history
I've been parsing this for a bit and as someone with a basic knowledge of Russian history it just doesn't really make a lot of sense what point they're trying to make. Kiev predates Moscow, but they both existed in the same state which was essentially proto Russia. Kiev even played an important role in the early growth of Moscow before it was eventually outgrown and eclipsed in Moscow in size and influence.

It just doesn't seem to actually make a point. Especially since other important Russian cities like Novgrod are significantly older and contemporary with Kiev in the Rus.
Not really, by your logic Israel had complete justification to invade the US
Like that's a thing that fucking happened?
Like Operation Paperclip?
Like the US?
and the issue with this is that since all countries tend to have unsolved grievances, some similarly large to 9/11 it leads to a very "might makes right" view of the world
Like, by your logic it would have been 100% justified for any South American country to invade the US for the Banana Republic period
If not handing over criminals was justification for war then the vast majority of countries on earth would have a casus belli against the vast majority of countries on earth. And pretty much everyone would have one against the US. The US has so fucking many untried war criminals and refuses to even sign into the ICC. Them complaining about another nation refusing to hand over another criminal, regardless of the crime is fucking rich. Then again, I've noticed that the US govt. has no ability to actually notice irony at all.
This, by the way is why the majority of Afghan citizens actually backed the Taliban over the US installed government
That's not the claim being made and it's a pretty absurd strawman. Try looking at this from the side of an Afghan rather than the US perspective. A foreign government funds an organisation that's highly abusive and responsible for many atrocities in your society, they then invade calling for the destruction of that organisation and cause an extreme amount of destruction in your state while doing so. Who's the problem here?
Also, the fact that the Bolshevik politicians weren't viewed as in line with the powerful soviets and were viewed as giving far too many concessions to liberals overall really wasn't helping
Their biggest downfall was that a very significant percentage of the population didn't actually support them at any point in time though.
The attempted suppression of the Petrograd Soviet didn't help them either
I'd just call it a liberal government personally
I also think that calling the Duma democratic is... a bit of a stretch? Considering it was literally designed, by the 3rd Duma to ensure that it was packed by land owning nobles and to crush socialist representation.
Sanctioning Russia now is just going to rally people around Putin
Yes, but the entire issue here is that it was widely viewed as the incompetence of the Tsar causing issues rather than western sanctions
Ahhh right
And the whole "incredibly unpopular war" thing
The Tsarists choosing to arm the communists in Moscow also had a lot to do with the downfall of the Tsar
That's a gross oversimplification of the Winter Revolution
Like, quite the opposite
Sanctions do not get leaders deposed
And the US should always look inwards at all times. It's the most imperialist nation on earth and the largest threat to the world.
What I have issues with is you saying the US should depose Putin
I actually have no issues if the US wants to defend the Ukraine honestly
I think what Putin's doing is equally as unjustified as what the US has done in history
I want to make it clear that I oppose imperialism universially
Pug, at what point have I actually supported Russian imperialism.
I mean, I agree the Iraq war was bad. The thing here is that the Afgan war really isn't any better
That is the consequence of supporting wars and something anyone who supports an offensive war should have to grapple with. And if you don't support it just say the easy thing, it was fucking unjustified.
Also Pug, legit question I want to ask you, if you actually think the Afgan war was justified, how many Afgans do you think deserved to die for 9/11. I think the answer is 0. Revenge is fucking stupid.
I chose the Afgan war because it was the first to come to mind, but literally any war during the war on terror would be an equally valid choice.
And even if you buy all that, why did the war continue after Bin Laden died?
Even if he was however that does not justify military action
They weren't, they refused to allow America to search and refused to turn him over. Both of which make sense in retrospect because, and I can't stress this enough, he wasn't fucking there.
It doesn't actually give a justification for invasion
9/11 wasn't carried out by the Afgan government mate
I agree with this but they don't.
Your justification is that it's OK for the US to topple a state for using it's sovereign powers to protect someone they've deemed a terrorist. I disagree. Bin Laden was in Pakistan anyway, so that didnt work out.
That's the thing, Russia does this locally, the US does it globally
As long as the USA retains near total dominance over influence in wealthy nations it's not possible
I don't know what the exact solution is but it probably involves more solidarity between smaller nations and agreement to do things to damage larger economies where possible in an even-handed manner.
That does tend to be the consequence of being next door to a global power. It's happened in Eastern Europe, South East Asia and South America/The Caribbean due to having world powers near them in the past. That's why we talked about just needing rid of global hegemons in general
They just didn't want to call more attention to this
yeah, that's a pretty pathetic take
yeah <a:HibikiAniDisgust:777603915716755457>
Kinda like how the BBC can do fantastic reporting about the US sometimes but can't notice a protest outside it's own office
That's also true
They do have one use. If you watch RT reporting and Fox News reporting and your brain somehow survives the midpoint between the two is often fairly close to the truth.
yes
yeah, that's more or less what I mean. They're pretty decent when it comes to journalistic investigation, but it's hard to trust what they publish
They're just the best of the garbage pile
yeah
My PoV is much more aligned with international socialist movements, probably Jacobin would be the most notable publication I find constantly decent?
RT does some journalism sometimes but they're generally pretty bad too
If it makes you feel better I hate Dore
Empires gonna empire <:02shrug:443257729646198784>
I think a more accurate statement is to say that the US does very similar things to China or Russia but has a larger reach
I'd prefer to use more accurate and measurable descriptors, I might throw out the word "evil" when describing something like EA, but I'll never use it to describe something that matters like a country
I've literally made this point before, but I hate the word "evil". It's vapid and doesn't really mean anything
which is the actual claim I made
but they are the most imperialistic nation on earth
They're not
and I think this perspective is quite important to hold honestly. If you want to oppose imperialism I'm right there with you, but I strongly oppose all imperialism.
I just also argued that they need to introspect about all the ways they behave highly similarly to Russia
I also never actually said the US shouldn't help the Ukraine, and argued they should actually
nor would I even fucking care
And I never made any claim about black not being an anarchist colour
Pug, I'm just extremely sceptical of the US due to the history of the US.
which is the closest I came to that, but it's also just a fact
I think I made an argument that the US arms its police more heavily using guns in the community as a justification?
I think it hurts far more considering the percentage of people who die during shootings who are black.
And I never victim blamed, I know being a minority in the US fucking sucks. I fail to see how the second amendment remotely helps.
Pug this isn't an inconsistent view. The US second amendment is bad because it causes more people to die and suffer. My argument actually had nothing at all to do with state violence. It has to do with general violence caused by fire arms. I had a secondary argument that the argument that guns existing doesn't actually help in the way that people who support guns claim them too.
A higher number of people die and suffer during times of war than even under the current US peace
Three things

Firstly, this isn't possible anyway

Secondly, I don't believe that an invasion to the US would bring about a better government than it has now

Thirdly, even if it could I don't believe it would justify the amount of people who would die in such an invasion.
Invasions to topple governments are a bad thing
That still would not justify an invasion.
The only reason Israel couldn't invade the US to get the criminals they wanted was due to the US's larger armed forces
But like I said, this is problematic because your world view just devolved to "might makes right"
I have my doubts you actually hold that PoV
My actual solution is side with no-one, not side with China
https://discord.com/channels/336297387863703552/336297840529899522/946001961478680586
Yeah, I think I covered that like 20 messages ago
Australia has pretty much no way to leverage influence over the US from within its sphere of influence, as an example so personally I don't see why staying in the sphere of a nation due to superior internal policies
But I'd also question, what can smaller nations realistically do to influence powers?
and even if you try social democracy they'll try to influence you back in a more liberal direction
It certainly does, but the issue is that if you side with the US you can never pursue any policy to the left of social democracy because they will just interfere to ensure that their hegemony is maintained
Vyn, I think the question is more what you think the point of this is? All of us know and have stated that China's internal policy is anything but a goal. We all know that the US has some horrific international policy. China's international policy is pretty shit, and the US's internal policy is pretty shit. Neither are good countries, the literal only reason I said China makes more sense to align with is because they're less coup crazy, not because they're actually a better country.
Because he killed leftists
The thing they're worse for is their geopolitical stance
I actually don't think the US's internal policy is worse than Chinas, at all
Both China and the US have terrible internal policies.
All I'm saying is that given a choice between China and the USA (Russia isn't a world power and isn't a realistic choice to align yourself too, even if you wanted to) I'd prefer China over the USA. I still prefer neutrality and a non-aligned status over either, by a lot.
But acting like America is doing anything but using countries for their own gain is absurd and they've shown themselves repeatedly to be highly belligerent on the world stage up to and including interfering in supposedly allied countries
To be clear, I vastly favour non-compliance with all world powers over that
The best choice is none of the above with regional defence pacts. The second best choice is probably China, to my knowledge they're yet to actually ferment a coup
To put my two cents in here, trusting the US isn't a good idea. If their interests ever conflict with yours they don't think twice about fucking with you. They don't actually value "freedom or democracy" they favour US growth and imperialism. That's why they've supported various coups in South America as recently as 2019.
and honestly, we'd probably need a much less capitalistic world to even begin discussing that
It'd be a really shitty position to be put in as a teacher as well as for the student, yes
Even most religious apologists don't argue that one anymore
Really does feel like the only nation that's actually good at foreign propaganda is the US
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Yes, I would generally agree with this and I don't even think it's a particularly controversial take
Also, just on this point Phara, Chinese tourism here is already a huge thing. Australia has a giant Chinese diaspora and some of our cities are >20% Chinese. Generally speaking Chinese tourism is pretty similar for our economy per person to any other form.
From my understanding there's been a few cases in Okinawa? I think where US armed forces have committed crimes and the Japanese courts haven't been able to try them too
needless to say, I'm not a big fan of that
Military bases here have been quite a contentious issue since Whitlam threatened to shut them down in the 70's and Pine Gap played a role in his dismissal
not good
and it is just less bad
I do personally feel like China is a less bad geopolitical partner than the US. This is an opinion that's founded on years of US interference in other nations
*China has never actually shown aggression towards Mongolia or western border territories, at least the ones accessible to Russia
I doubt China would fear Russia messing with them directly, but Mongolia and the western border states still exist, so an expansionist Russia probably isn't favourable to them.
I wish we could just agree to not fight near Chernobyl
I really hope they get nailed for this one. Its super fucking disgusting.
The Taliban taking an anti imperialist stance isn't as out there as a lot of people think it is and it's actually fairly consistent with their own history.
There's a term for people who think that's a valid casus belli
But he went ahead with that
In theory he should have understood that a war in the Ukraine isn't really in his favour
I don't think it's likely but my track record on this isn't great right now
But yeah, it's not hyperagressive or anything
It's not quite a neutral stance, it's starting to lean towards "cut your BS"
Wait till they release the Godzilla
The other thing is that this is just one uncredible source vs another
It's just like, kinda irrelevant without context
I think the biggest issue is that there's no evidence that anyone here has ever even read the misinformation being claimed here
That assumes you don't do anything to try to control it, but like, the US isn't doing that much
The two things are related. The quicker as virus spreads the more cases per day you get, for obvious reasons. But the virus also runs through all contacts and all potential hosts quicker, which causes the wave to end sooner
Pandemics occur in waves
We've redefined the problem and there's no longer a problem
I guess Putin tried that but no-one bought it
Just tell them the enemy force are communists or terrorists and that they're protecting freedom. Usually works.
I mean, I assume anyway. I still have no idea what Putin's end goal actually is
Russia overestimated their own army's moral and underestimated the Ukrainians. He wanted a quick conflict but a ton of Russian troops just don't want to fight at all and the Ukrainians have dug in.
US Torries unhinged rant like no other though. It's kinda amazing in its own really fucked up way.
Man, I keep firing the intercontinental ballistic tweets but no one's a commie yet. Help.
They'd have to pay lawyers to work out what the legal complications of doing so were and pay someone to actually change the credits. The alternative is that they do nothing and it costs them nothing.
A company actually putting in any effort for things like this that they don't think enough people will notice to cause a backlash isn't going to happen
~~car bad~~
IDK how much I trust the NYT to report on China
Yes, but the prediction of WWI in Europe wasn't just a few cranks, it was well regarded leaders too
Gonna need a citation on that one. Quite a lot of people across Europe (famously Bismarck) predicted the war quite a way out and even the way it started
Debt isn't that big of an issue. Most large economies throughout history have a lot of debt. The US military industrial complex plays an important role in making sure that the US economy keeps moving.
Can't agree with that. War is still a fantastic way to make money if you can do it without sanctions. Look at the entire US economy.
It really does feel like a bit of BS, just with the amount of times it's been argued true then disproved
Oh, the other link
Biden did exactly what he said he'd do
The anime industry is all kinds of fucked
Japanese wages are quite low in general, significantly lower than the same job in most western countries. At the same time cost of living in Japan is also a lot lower
Exchanging crypto probably constitutes that
You know not complying with sanctions is a federal crime right? That means everyone on every level of any transaction could theoretically be prosecuted federally for breaking a sanction with Russia.
Yes, but the dollar is worth 0 and once the sanctions hit the exxhanges crypto will be too
Literally, the safest currency to carry in Russia is still the ruble honestly. At least it will never be frozen out completely. You can even find a Russian YouTuber talking about how he thought having his money in USD was smart but it's just worthless now because he can't exchange it.
Having crypto in Russia will be useless as soon as sanctions start hitting exchanges
At least a couple were rooted back and there were straight up lies in their claims
There's actually a super concerning trend of sketch as fuck projects coming from nowhere claiming to be donating to the Ukraine
Because it benifits you personally
I just think you're rationalizing a net negative.
Also <@192961864408367105> not going to stay up and post replies for hours or anything but you realise there's pretty good reasons why I'd be sceptical of a capitalist institution making 10s of thousands of dollars in donations right? Regardless of what the cause is.
Even the official translation is "the Ministry of Education"
Which is literally the same name as the Ministry of Education in Australia
It's an unfortunate translation, but if you translate it in a less biased way it would just be the "Ministry of Education"
https://twitter.com/mbolonkin/status/1499225586367148037
Kinda figured this would be the case, especially since enlightenment and education are already so close to synonyms in English
Yeah, I saw someone talking about how they heard someone unironically say "Russia should have just messed with Afghanistan instead"
I'm inclined to agree with this ultimately. The primary thing that the sorts of sanctions we've seen implemented do is punish the general population and that's not really a good thing.
I trust banks a lot more than crypto. They have no reason to shut down my shitty couple of thousand dollar account and considering the amount they'd potentially be liable for if they did they have very good reason to keep it open. They're also obligated by law to refund me in the case of fraud unless it's very obviously my fault. Not to say they don't do bad shit, they're fucking assholes. But the legal protections in place at least make them better than crypto.
Legit I have no clue Kat. This entire thing is one giant clusterfuck
See that's the issue. It's a market
I'll take my chances with the city robbers
I've seen crypto scams and the amount stolen there
<:Doubt:696037552716775524>
You could also withdraw all your money and shove it under your mattress. That's safer than crypto. People use banks primarily because they're safe enough and convenient.
Honestly, if they don't already have crypto it may not help anyway since like, there's been some internet issues in the Ukraine so you can't put into crypto and flee anyway
The thing is, any exchange probably constitutes breaking sanctions. If nations get serious about this shit Russia will just be cut lose by crypto
Not going to pretend my knowledge of history is perfect in that area though
Pretty sure he was partially responsible for the independence of Ukraine from Russia as a Soviet state, but I think it also existed before that
Anyway if any of the Soviet leaders are coming back from the dead to rule it's going to be Lenin, let's face it
I know more about Trotsky than I do about Gorbachev
DW, my knowledge of Soviet leaders post Stalin drops off to shit too
We should all just agree to run parallal workers governments in the McDonald's next to parliament
That is basically a Soviet
I'm only half joking when I say set up Soviets. A worker Soviet would actually be a positive step in the current state of Russia and it's a historically based solution
If only because they'd quite likely be the only Soviet republic so the name wouldn't make sense
I feel like even in the very unlikely case of a socialist revolution in Russia they'd opt for a different name
Time for more Soviets I guess
Like, the worst thing about Australia is about 75% of white Australians just being the absolute fucking worst
It is though. Don't know if it applies here but holy fuck it is
Also you say this as if US foreign policy experts go deeper than macathyist bullshit
They weren't in Yeltsins second run
This is why they will never be given the same amount of choice, even if I think that choice is pretty false as other western nations
*Russia without US election interference would have re-elected the communist party
I doubt Russia will ever be allowed to significantly democratize. The people would vote for leaders who actually wanted to spend money on them rather than just embezel in a way that benifits US rich fucks
It'd be more likely that their soldiers would defect than fight
If that passes Russia will have the least efficient army in the history of mankind
I don't think this is worth the societal or environmental impacts. Let alone the fucking cringy YouTube videos with a talking coin that are good enough justification to ban crypto and burn down every computer ever involved in it honestly.
What you're talking about isn't exceptionally valuable though. At best it's just a slightly easier way to do basic banking and I personally really doubt that.

Not to mention it's actually not viable worldwide since a few countries have banned crypto.
*not to Russia but I made my reasoning on why I doubt that will last anyway clear
I can just call my bank and get them to move money into an international account. I think I can even do it online.
Denazification of Russia via frontline infantry
The haircut gives it away
You don't even need to highlight the tats
Apparently asking US megacorps to pay for the resources they drill off of our soil is communism and can't be tolerated
So like
But also, my country tried to at least make the earliest moves away from liberal capitalism under Whitlam and got CIA'd
I never consented to capitalism. Get me off this fucking hellscape <:sigh:230149462880813056>
Like, don't get me wrong, Soviet style communism isn't my goal, but acting like it's a more horrific system than liberal capitalism strikes me as strange
Here's the issue with that logic. Capitalism also kills people. Like a lot of people. Like, 10000 people a year die from preventable illness a year in the US alone in spite of huge wealth within the US and substantial medical advancement since the 1940's
What's the difference <:heh:789431887135113241>
So it's the "common sense" number
Ye, but it's the number that gets cited over and over again in media and such
Also only partially related but I personally love the fact that the most common number used for Stalin's death toll includes both Russian soldiers killed in WWII and German soldiers killed by Russian soldiers in WWII. He's still a horrific guy, it's just funny that the US is so into propaganda that even when they don't need to they still do it.
The level of industrialisation in Russia at the time was very low and almost entirely restricted to Moscow and St. Peterburg
Also, it does feel strange that the same criticism is rarely lobbied at early capitalists in the UK who did far, far worse in industrialisation supported by lazefare governemnts
I think acting like any leader should be perfect is fallacious. Lenin took over an economically backwards nation that was stuck in an unpopular losing war. The simple fact here is that any leader, regardless of their ideology would have committed (my phone really wanted this to be vomited) atrocities with the correct framing here, because Russia was beyond fucked and there was no way to unfuck it fast enough to prevent people dying.
He actually had a goal and a vission and moved the nation in a generally positive direction, which is actually probably better than any other Russian leader
Yeah, he had serious mental health issues though
I don't think it's controversial to say that Lenin was a far better leader in every way than Stalin. Only thing Stalin has over him was punching Nazis but I'm pretty sure Lenin would have been pretty anti Hitler in WWII as well if he was around.
Also yes, Stalin famously hated Ukraine's status in the USSR and believed the land should be a part of Russia.
The grain of truth there is that had Lenin have not given Ukraine the degree of independence it had under the USSR there is a solid chance it wouldn't exist as it is today. That doesn't make it a fake country
Fuck, I want people to stay 20m away from me at all times
That seems like the real challenge here
Hit me up when someone finds a private military company that isn't run by a fascist
Or private?
PMC=paramilitary core I think
This is the issue that liberals don't want to think about
Why not? The West seems quite willing to admit that the average Russian has no power to influence the government, so why is it morally justifiable to inflict pain on them for the actions of a government they have no control over
Because our current set of actions is worthless and inflicts pain on the average citizen
Why stop there? Sanctions don't really work, at least in hostile countries
I'm talking about East Timor
Australia
Fucking asshole
Last time there was a war near us Howard supported the imperial power's invasion
Yeah, that's fair
States took a lot of power a way from feds during the pandemic and diverged quite strongly
I've never seen my country as divided as it is today personally
You just described like, 90+% of the world
Honestly the power of population in any country is a pretty fucking highly  illusiosiary but Russians have even less power than the tiny amount of mostly illusory power we do.
I don't think he cares as long as he maintains power honestly
It is harder for Russia's population to rebel now than it was in the early 1900's due to a government with more effective control
Otherwise you're just saying whatever works best for the position you want to hold
You can't have both
Either history matters or it doesnt
???
They very rarely work
If you want to use history as your teacher
Cypher do me a solid and look into the history of sanctions
You can't have your cake and eat it too
Wait, but the West seems obsessive about the fact that the average citizen has no power in Russia
You can only control your own actions, and I can criticize the impact of sanctions without supporting Russian action, especially when I don't think these sanctions are likely to be particularly effective
*mostly the politicians. I think most socdems voters would prefer to work with socialists
What Joim and I are alluding to is that there's a long history of social democrats turning their back on socialists to work with liberals to more deeply entrench capitalism
Yeah, it's rare to hear about socdems not siding with liberals
That's called a theocrat Kat
Libertarians do a lot of things that don't make sense. If they didn't they wouldn't be libertarians
America is just the extreme example
Being skewed right is really just a trend of modern politics
Unfortunately the current system in Australia excludes  joke parties pretty much
Also the Party Party Party Party
There isn't any
Or something like that
I think the biggest we ever had was the "Sun Dried Rippened Cherry Tomatoes Party"
Joke parties can be great
I mean, the Monster Raving Looney Party also won a low level seat in the UK once IIRC
Bring back the beer party
I don't think that's a very helpful attitude and it's certainly not one I agree with in the slightest.
It's like absolute capitalist endgame
IDK, I find the comodification of war pretty fucking weird
I'll probably be voting socialist alliance in the Senate, but my votes going to end up with the greens regardless
The best we can do is not completely terrible neoliberals
Our left is the greens and that's a little fucking sad
What the west did to Laos is one of the biggest farces in history honestly
Especially if they're idling a lot
I think it's around -20 though
I just saw "cold" an considered that can be an issue
I didn't really look at the actual temp
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
Really though, fact checkers do have a huge issue which is that people inherently trust them somewhat more than other news sources which makes them a fantastic way to spread misinformation. The ABC here is great at using its fact checker to both sides issues that only have one side <:sigh:230149462880813056>
We just need to do infinite turtles but with fact checkers
I think EA removing the Russian team from FIFA online is peak performative BS
Yeah, this whole thing is just super performative, weird as fuck, a lot of it doesn't even make sense according to the liberal logic of sanctions (US movie by US studio) and feels more based in race than anything concrete
Russians. Ukrainians have some degree of shelter and fuel freezes in cold weather
https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/treasurer-josh-frydenbergs-office-accidentally-sends-photos-to-alp-photocopier/news-story/f0e99d92e158cc60fb4cb269f58728c1
Our govt. is so incompetent they keep making news look like satire
Yes, I'm not sure about quotas persay, but certainly private prisons, which are a thing that should never exist
Unsurprisingly this system produces a lot of false confessions and it's one of the reasons why the US has such a high rate of overturned convictions.
For some reason it's completely legal for cops in the US to lie to people after they arrest them in pursuit of a confession, so they quite often claim to have evidence they don't have and tell you that you could face 10 years if you go to court or 3 if you take the deal, for example
Because the US police force use psychological warfare against people who have been arrested to force confessions. The way how the US police are allowed to act in interviews makes confessions in the US highly questionable.
The really annoying thing is that these people are tapping into something that is right, even if they're then turning around and running that point off a fucking cliff. Video game journalism sucks, just not for the reasons they think. There's huge issues with incentive structures in video games that make reviewers almost never give bad reviews.
I can also understand why her videos at the time would adopt a degree of frustration at the wider gaming community though
I personally viewed her as saying something more along the lines of "it's the problems of society that make this popular", but I have only watched them retrospectively since I gave literally 0 fucks at the time
It really shows just how sheltered the gaming community was/is, because this sort of discourse is super common in say, film criticism.
Honestly, go back and watch some of Anita Sarkeesian's stuff from the time, it's like the most mild feminist critiques that are just common in most leftwing discourse. It's actually astonishing that they triggered that sort of reaction at all.
Russia lacks access to the same sort of external propaganda branch the US or even China has and can't white wash their actions anywhere near as effectively. They tried to with the whole "denazification" thing, but no-one bought into it the same way they did with the "war on terror". Quite a lot of this is about optics as well.
Especially since many nations have explicitly avoided doing things that would directly hit oligarchs
I didn't contest that. The issue here is that the sanctions are pretty unlikely to have major impacts on Russia's top brass and much more likely to just hit the average people
which I doubt
Either that or they honestly believe that sanctions will have some impact
Russia is being excluded from international sporting events for the same reason they're being sanctioned though, the west wants to remove a geopolitical rival's cultural and economic power.
To be fair, international sports are kinda inherently political, Australia is an example of a country that overinvests into sports to project a form of societal soft power. A country being excluded from sports is above this, but the original question of "why are sports being political" can only really be answered with "yes"
I'd say that doesn't apply to online but online games here are just always more expensive so <:02shrug:443257729646198784>
The reason is because the chips are proprietary and cost more than BR disks to make
Nintendo games cost ~$10 more, at least here
What we're saying is that data wipes don't actually remove data permanently. There's a chance that IT people could actually recover it still if it hasn't been overwritten with new data. But if the phone's gone then yeah, probably won't work.
yeah, it'd be worth taking it to a phone shop and seeing if they can do anything at least
at least in practice
The Petrograd Soviet was a form of government anyway
That's not common use and suggests a greater difference between the Petrograd Soviet (which is always capitalised for the same reason the Government of Australia is) and the Soviet Union than actually existed
Especially when we both know that in reality the main Soviet with the bulk of power was the Petrograd Soviet anyway
Also, this is just a matter of language. The correct capitalisation for Soviet is objectively upper case. Lower case is completely unused.
especially under Lenin
It did
I'm actually inclined to agree, government by workers is actually better.
Of course he didn't, he viewed the Soviets as the more legitimate of the two powers
I mean, the Soviets began reacting heavily against the provincial government when it began taking actions to try to reduce their power. It was pretty well known by all involved that the Soviets didn't actually want to hand power over to the government, why would they? They only agreed because they needed to unite against the greater German and Austrian threat on their boarders. When the PG started fucking with them they viewed the deal as broken.
and the SR also held a significant amount of power in the Soviets, at least at the time of the election. The issue is that they lost the vast majority of their Soviet support which lead to serious issues for the government as the Soviets became more and more hostile. The reason why Lenin could so easily dissolve government is because he had the full backing of the worker Soviets, including the SR base.
Basically when the workers are running their own parallel government (as they fucking should) you'd do best not to piss it off.
Also remember, inter-revolution Russia had duel power. The parliament weren't actually in control of the country fully and the Soviets still held a considerable amount of power. One of the main reasons for the collapse of the government was that the Soviets were pissed off at it, and there's really no reason why electoral democracy should be given precedent over the form of worker democracy that was active in the Soviets at the time.
But like, what the SRs were actually doing is the same thing the Health Party did in Aus, for the most part. Take a certain piece of political terminology and appropriate it outside of its actual use case to get people who don't really know your stances to vote for you. They were a Socially Democratic party essentially, a bit before the ideology had been formalised but they held many similar views. The revolutionary parties were the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks
The SRs also had a very extreme split
Although most of the SR base supported the Reds, a lot of the political arm were Whites
The SRs were split
The Mensheviks 100% weren't
It wasn't a clean split, but they were more white than red, and in spite of their name they weren't really a revolutionary part in the same way as the B/Ms
mostluy
The SR supported the whites
Kat, you want to know how I know what you're saying isn't really true and that the revolutionary parties actually had a lot more support than the vote would suggest? The Reds outnumbered the Whites by a huge margin even after the west sent about a dozen armies to support the Whites.
You realise that's because it's a continuation of the 4th Duma which heavily repressed the Mensheviks right?
Like, Lenin didn't come from nowhere, he gained support because the provincial government was pretty shit
An actual democratic election would have seen the Mensheviks in power, not the provisional government that actually lead. The idea that Russia has ever had a democratic election is pretty wrong honestly. The provincial government was pretty much handpicked by the Tsar to ensure that the Duma was less adversarial than the 1st and 2nd where socialists held far more power. The reason why the Bolsheviks were able to rise entirely has to do with the failures of the provisional government and the rise of the Soviets as an alternative form of representation.
To be fair, the clear best thing Russia could do would be to undo the vast majority of the changes that were made by Yeltsin and Putin
And Moscow is always going to be the most important city within Russia, geography, infrastructure and population dynamics ensure that
Last I checked the Bundestag is still a part of Germany's culture even though it's entwined with the fucking Reichstag at this point. Even when countries reject a part of their history these things tend to stand
and a ton of cultural relevance
you get the point though, Russia has a ton of old, important architecture that it can leverage in good times
<:monaderpy:854593417585491988>
wrong one
not really, because if/when things blow over the Hagia Sophia and Kremlin will still be standing, Russian culture will still be there and as things go back to a somewhat normal state those things start to become relevant again
They don't suddenly not have the soft power, it's just that it's ineffective on shaping world opinion in light of other events
A nation can have soft power even if people internationally don't view it positively
Soft power is literally about leveraging your culture and population's achievements to gain influence on the world stage. Russia has softpower in its history and architecture primarily.
And yeah, I have no issue with what FIFA specifically did
Russian culture is highly iconic
Every nation has soft power and Russia actually have a ton?
*also to be clear Russia has/had its own neoimperial core
you might notice, liberalisation is a terrible system if you're a developing country that Nestle can enter and treat you as a pool of cheap labour. The best system for those countries would be radical protectionism
Russia probably could have had this power but their corruption and aggression tends to exclude them
As I said, some countries attached themselves to the west and benefited from western imperialist markets. Those that didn't acted more like African or South East Asian liberal markets that were highly exploited by western imperialist markets. Russia is in a weird case where a two tiered system where the oligarchs heavily exploited the rest of the population but no integration with other imperialist markets occurred. Liberalisation is fantastic for economies when you can import cheap shit from elsewhere made by effective slaves. As a member of the EU Poland has this power.
Doesn't matter what they started as, they underwent a campaign of extreme liberalisation
The nations that integrated themselves into western economies generally improved due to them being buoyed on the market of western imperialism.
Like, shock therapy wasn't a good thing
the post USSR market liberalisation did a lot of damage to Russia. Is this even argued?
and we have a literal fascist party for if you don't think the Tories are bad enough
or offbrand green Tories, who are less bad but fuck they can't win
what a choice
I can pick between the red Tories or the blue Tories
I really just don't view him as worse than the leaders we have now. At least he was doing something for the people. The thing about electoral democracies is that they're absurdly easy to hijack and run into the ground. Personally I don't see how I live in less of an oligarchical controlled dictatorship than the USSR.
What I'm saying is that acting like Lenin was some horrible, evil person who did nothing but bad when he oversaw a gigantic leap in quality of life, or acting like he's solely responsible for the actions of Stalin is absurd
*checks what capitalists did with the lives of peasants during their industrial revolutions*
it was highly contentious
A lot of people wanted to get rid of the NEP
Other than the fact that that statement is actually referring to Lenin mostly
Lenin took the idea and expanded it in ways that aren't always the most favourable, but the idea existed
also Lenin didn't invent vanguardism as an idea. It exists within Marx and Engel's writings, it's just not very fleshed out. Marx also argues that there needs to be a single, proletarian lead party to lead the revolution, although he doesn't really go in to much more detail than that.
I believe Trotsky was the preferred leader and most likely would have continued to lead in a very similar way. Which constituted in one of the largest increases in quality of life ever seen in any nation in history. You can talk about these people as if they're evil, but Lenin really did a lot more for Russia than any of its other leaders. He's not even my ideal leader, I just think that he did a whole lot more good than you're making out. And like, by the same logic you're using a socially democratic government could be blamed when there's a reactionary swing away from them and a Tory gets in to fuck shit up. They oppose this as best they can within the system, but their own actions and mistakes, as well as the system they support ultimately lead to this.
Also Kat, my issue with the point of view that Lenin should be blamed for Stalin here is that he didn't want Stalin, at any point to be the leader and attempted to oppose it. He made a crucial mistake that resulted in Stalin claiming leadership.
*also there's a reason why under Stalin the role was incorporated into a ministry
It's a complete dumbass mistake, never trust anyone with anything really.
Lenin assumed the role would be used in good faith and not to build Stalin's party within the party
I'm not saying it wasn't. Stalin wasn't meant to hold no power. But he wasn't meant to hold all the power he ended up with. The role was viewed, before Stalin more as a high level admin role. The issue is the things he could administrate over essentially gave him defacto control over who composed the government which allowed him to shape the lower levels of government to be supportive of him
His role was not meant to be as powerful as it was
There were, but Stalin was given an absurd degree of power mostly by accident
Also you realise that worker Soviets can still have power locally even if the federal government holds a high degree of power generally right? It's literally impossible to federally manage everything about a nation, especially one as large as the USSR was pre high speed/high bandwidth communication. Someone has to be doing the local management, it's literally impossible not to have someone there
Like, I'm willing to admit that giving one guy the power to control all government appointments was probably not the play. That was actually Lenin's biggest mistake.
Stalin's rise to power was enabled by the disproportionate power Stalin had been given which was essentially an oversight of Soviet power structures.
Also, to be clear when I refer to a specific Soviet there's not even an argument that I should be lowercasing it. "The Petrograd Soviet" causes no ambiguity at all
If you ignore the fact that the first government of the USSR was pulled from the Soviets, primarily the Petrograd Soviet, they continued to exist and workers continued to be elevated to government positions and they were still granted a ton of local powers then sure, they stopped existing. If you want to live in a realistic world then they continued existing at least until Stalin began his campaign of greatly increased centralisation around the top level government.
Like, Lenin didn't just dissolve them when he took power you know?
The Soviets formed the Soviet government when it formed and continued to exist and have power for a long time
legit, this is just English grammar rules
ice-cream parlour doesn't have to be capitalised but Cold Rock always should be
But the Petrograd Soviet, the case that should be unanimous is a specific organisation
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Rock_Ice_Creamery
We capitalise all organisations generally
You'd have to give a good reason why it shouldn't be capitalised just because the default for "Petrograd Soviet" would be capitalisation
any organisation
like
It's actually very uncommon to not capitalise an organisation in English
Try looking at some of the others, because capitalisation of Soviet is common and capitalisation of Petrograd Soviet is pretty much unanimous.
Russian propaganda is really getting increasingly sureal
That makes this so much worse
Oh god, I just realised that they have the vaccine emoji in their user name
Also, why should Bangladesh have to have a say in this at all? Abstaining from things that are distant from you is like, fine
Vaccines should never have been in question, preferably even through Russia
Also, if you're willing and able to exert some degree of socially democratic policy which Poland historically has it is possible to tax back economic potential from corporations operating within your own borders and use that to build infrastructure and grow. The most extreme example of this form of growth being China. The real issue is for nations that just don't have enough governmental power to resist when slaving corporations set up shop, or are too corrupt to care, which is the state of a whole lot of former soviet countries.
it doesn't matter if that's exclusive or if you have some other form of trade block as well
Yeah, that's not needed for the argument I'm making though. It's just access to the world market on the side of imperialist powers, which Poland has had since more or less the fall of the USSR that allows for liberalism to somewhat function
Poland's relationship with the EU always allowed for some degree of exploitation of cheap labour elsewhere, even if the state was also acting as slightly less cheap labour
it just didn't integrate with the west's
You should use the word "democratic" rather than "liberal" in this case. Because liberalism actually in proper political vernacular refers to an economic ideology, which is why you can have people like √Å√±ez, who was a liberal dictator
I mean, the reason why Bolivia isn't liberal is because the people have been voting heavily against liberalism in spite of the institutional advantages held by liberals since the first Morales government. It is a democratic government and the time it recently backslid it was to a liberal dictator. Liberalism isn't the same thing as democracy.
Because the recent one was a US backed coup that put in a fundamentalist Christian leader who lead multiple massacres against her own people and is currently being tried for human rights abuses
Which year Bolivia are we talking about?
Russia is much more akin to the likes of Cuba or Vietnam that exist mostly isolated from the west already anyway
South Africa exists in a completely different state to Russia. South Africa was highly integrated with western economies, had an active resistance against the apartheid government (even if the west considered them terrorists) and had a much lower degree of internal propaganda than Russia does right now
I just think the general/swift sanctions are not
I think they're a good thing
To be fair, I'm not actually against military sanctions
The way Russia obtains semiconductors is just to requisition them from civilian applications mostly
Issue is Russia has more than enough resources to simply internalise its supply chains completely. In practice their military was mostly run completely internally post 2014 anyway. The main factor that will hinder Russia's war is moral, which was low with or without the sanctions
There would need to already be an organised resistance before we could even start discussing if sanctions would assist an uprising
Sanctions have literally never done that. The Vietnamese Communist party still holds power and a Castro still leads in Cuba.
like, sanctions have a long history of accomplishing fuck all in almost every case
I do, I just also understand that starving the Russian working class won't accomplish anything at all
I don't think you should have a clear conscience with sanctions as they've been imposed. They're very clearly crafted to damage the working class and that isn't a good thing.
I think westerners greatly overestimate their countries power in this conflict honestly
Can you though? Russia has a lot of internal resources and most likely has the ability to internalise most of their military processes
The actions of the majority of western countries makes more sense to me when viewed through the lens of neoliberal capitalism. To them the role of government isn't to manage disproportionate wealth that damages nations, it's to protect those discrepancies and allow for the rich to have greater levers to exploit the poor. That includes internationally.
if it was they'd do both
Maximising the consequences to Russia clearly isn't the goal
The West has done what it always does. Picked the actions that minimise consequences for the wealthy and maximise consequences for the poor.
Regardless of if you think they should be doing more, that should have been the first action taken
It's the most direct and effective way to actually target oligarchs. The fact that they're not doing so proves that what the West is doing is more about starving the Russian people in spite of their rhetoric
Which tells me personally a lot about the actual goals of the West here
Directly seizing the assets of oligarchs is a pretty good way of doing this that several western countries have actually opted not to do
That doesn't sound very freedom loving of you
I'm saying it's probably not enforceable because it requires other state's police to cooperate highly
seems like it really wouldn't be
Is it even enforceable in practice?
To be fair though, the biggest threat to South American democracies generally is the US intervening. This is especially true in Bolivia and it's part of the reason why so many adopt stances they have to try to excise any US influence.
It is used frequently by socialists to refer to systems of economic management that are in contrast to liberalism, which includes most socialist modes and some others like centrally planned fascism.
Liberal democracy is the accompanying governmental system that is favoured by ideological liberals, although certainly not all liberals.
Yes, if you use the term "liberal democracy" that's technically correct. But the issue is that the terms liberal/illiberal without the following democracy refer primarily to the economic system.
As I said, the first step is to reject everything about the current world and get the average person to understand that they have more in common with the working class on the other side of the world than the rich or the government of their own countries
It's being managed in the exact way the elites think is most in their best interests
I don't think so, I think it has more to do with a reduction of nationalistic tendencies and a reorientation to thinking more about one's relationship to others based off of class than nationality. The leaders of the world as it stands like nation states because it lets them get their population angry at foreigners rather than the rich assholes who are exploiting them.
"World unified government" right now is basically saying "let's just codify the US empire"
like, random African nations as an example don't get any say in their foreign policy if they want to continue to exist
The other issue is that the current world system makes any interaction between unequal nations kinda forceful by nature
"Yes, but capitalism will ruin everything" is a surprisingly common answer
we kinda do honestly, but doing so under the current system would be utterly disastrous. Still surprised to see any poli would go there
wouldn't be the first time
With any luck it gets revealed he's in a weird cult and has to step down
Biohazard research labs do all sorts of things. There are some that do weapons research, but they're in the extreme minority. The majority simply handle samples from people who potentially have infectious diseases.
There's not enough info there to know exactly where I stand VS him on everything, but like, he's already better than our Labor or Greens party <:LuL:789259461470322728>
He seems like a decent enough guy, I'd vote for him over literally anyone running in our next election
they just argue against stopping there
most socialist do advocate for social democratic reform where they think there's a strong case for it actually reducing harm
Social democracy
but we should do that
I mean, it's not
Just a weird city all around
Melbourne has no idea what the hell it's doing at any point. We built a giant tram network and a functional train network that somehow mostly survived when the rest of Aus was ripping up theirs, but we also have insane sprawl and a massive amount of car based infrastructure.
Too many cars and too little foresight. Although to be fair no-one actually had foresight, Asia was just to poor post war to build cars and Europe actually just lucked out.
yeah, that one's always been a dumpsterfire
kinda hard to believe now, but it used to be amongst the best in the world
Probably depends how old you are. The US actually had a decently robust welfare state pre Reagan
Arguably the co-op thing is actually more radical
but for whatever reason that one's actually more contentious than trying to increase the percentage of corporations operating as co-ops, so it would likely be harder to pass through an actual democracy (and achieving that is our first challenge)
yep, 100%
and most people actually like co-ops, even most working class ideological capitalists
Obviously not the only thing that needs doing, but it's a hell of a first step
Also we have some systems that could be put in place right now to help reduce the strain of hierarchies to the average person. The really obvious one being demanding the resignation of CEOs and boards to restructure workplaces as cooperative structures.
(not saying anyone here did but it is common)
and also that creating a system where you tell people their whole life that they need to compete for jobs/grades etc and then claiming based off what you see that human nature is competitive is like, really weird?
My point is simply that the current systems in place heavily repress human cooperation and are a net negative to humanity and we should strive to remove them regardless of what that looks like
There are some tools that are so dangerous that their very existence is an existential problem
I'm willing to say that firearms are overall a net shit for humanity, but even if you're not the argument is simply that not everything humans make will be good so you could just shift that back to like, napalm or mustard gas or something objectively shitty
The point is that the systems and tools we create are best when they don't oppress the natural instincts that humans have. I believe this is far more cooperative
Not every system we create will be good for us
those haven't done us a ton of good
Humans also created guns
That is the ancient human condition and the way we lived for a very long time
Humans were hunter gathers before fishers however
yep, that's true, because fishing requires resources and is more individualistic than hunting or gathering which creates inequalities
Kat, there's still non-agri societies around today and there's an overwhelming consensus that they have a less hierarchical society than we do. It's not like this is ancient history.
Also I'd like to point out that the human condition is separate from whether or not hierarchies form natural. The human mind evolved in a time when they were mostly absent and is designed to work without them
not the less resources
I think it's the even distribution that's more important here
When there aren't as many resources to distribute resources tend to be split more evenly and societies tend to be less hierarchical
There's no such thing as a total power vacuum on earth, even in a power vacuum global capitalism exists and influences. It is true that those who can monopolise resources tend to take power, but I'd argue that has more to do with unequal distribution of resources than anything
It's not nostalgia, just an acknowledgement that generally speaking hierarchies as we know them are not natural
*also to be fair we don't actually know how elites would act under systems significantly less exploitive than capitalism since there's so few examples in history. I'd make an argument that Ho Chi Minh and Castro generally acted more virtuously under less exploitative systems, but I'm not sure everyone would agree with that
I mean, we created those positions of power. The preagricultural condition of humans involved a whole lot of flat hierarchies and a more cooperative way of living in general. It's quite unnatural for humans to even be handed positions of complete power and an artifact of our civilisation as we've constructed it
I think human nature is far more cooperative and far less competitive than the world would suggest and that many of the systems of the world are designed to crush that cooperation
I think it's been heavily manipulated by chance occurrences to be heavily anti-human and that given the chance to rebuild very few people, other than the elites themselves would actually chose this world
I don't think anything about the current world is part of the human condition
"you're a dumbass"
-literally everyone more qualified in the field than he is
Maybe one day
Good to see Facebook taking a brave stance in favour of racial abuse <:sigh:230149462880813056>
"We totally support both gay rights and the Saudi Royal family (who give us a lot of money). Don't question it"
I'd also like to point out that "Jew" isn't a monolithic ethnic identity, Ethiopian Jews exist too, ironically Israel is often more hostile towards them than Ethiopia is
Israeli Arabs vote, but that's a separate thing from the Palestinian minority. That's mostly naturalised Palestinians who are a minority of all Palestinians in Israel.
Actually if Israeli society completely secularised they'd have a very hefty Palestinian minority that would suddenly gain voting rights.
and I'd say literally the same shit about like, Egypt and Islam too
IE, there needs to be a secularisation and reduced focus on Jewish identity within Israel
Kat, I'd really appreciate it if you stopped strawmaning literally every position I have. Neither I nor Amnesty ever said that. We said that the Jewish state of Israel shouldn't exist, because it's causing huge issues for Palestinians as it exists currently.
Ethnostates are kinda bad too, and Israel has been creating laws that specifically deprioritise Palestinians while advantaging Jews
Na, I think Amnesty is 100% right here. Theocracies just shouldn't exist.
I hope they shoot each other at the same time
Honestly candles are probably more useful than police on average too
it's really not an understatement to say that he's responsible for the path that modern politics post 80's has taken, he's probably one of the three most influential presidents of the 1900's but unlike FDR and Teddy there wasn't really any silver lining to his leadership
Reagan was one of the two most important politicians in the bringing in of neoliberal politics to the western political sphere alongside Thatcher
Reagan
~~and he was only the second worst TV clown to ever be elected president of the US~~
I think a degree of cynicism around celebrity culture is pretty healthy. It's a good thing to know that the vast majority of them are absolute dickheads.
They're definitely predisposed to it
My opinion on this is that knowing enough to form an opinion on this is pretty much a waste of time. After reading the article it's just celebrities being dumbass attention seekers and I don't really care what happens to him either way.
Why does literally everything have to be viewed through the lens of procedualism? How do we get anything passed? Why not just stay a garbage neolib state forever and let companies fuck the world.
And yeah, R1 zoning is the biggest issue here
I don't view this as false hope. It's a goal to aspire to. Society needs to have some idea of what it wants to be ultimately or you fall back into a highly cynical state like the US.
Yes? Do you think I don't fucking realise that?
Like, there's nothing lost for advocating for something unlikely
But like, that's not even the real point here, the point is that advocacy for actual solutions is just a net good
Matt, you're running very far tangential to the point right now. Also revolution becomes possible when the majority want it, because the military is made up of, you know, people.
I mean, if you want to know how to actually implement them the French have a method. The major issue is just convincing enough people they are correct.
Just the existence of alternatives helps
We don't always need to think about the practical way to implement solutions.  Sometimes it's good just to have them and advocate for them
I think the thing with housing is that the simple solution has been complicated by the system. The solution is to build more houses in places where housing is needed. It's actually that simple. We just need to strip the system until that can be done.
Change always comes quickly and unexpectedly. The current system is designed to create an illusion of change without change, but it isn't permanent and it too can be changed.
Build trains so kids can get themselves to school and set back the school start time. This one doesn't even require a large shift.
I want to see a large societal shift that values work less and shapes our society around what we know to be good for people rather than humans
Yes?
The main reason why this won't change in the US and Aus is because the majority of students get driven to school by their parents.
Trust me, moving school times back helps with that. Forcing kids to wake up earlier to study isn't.
Matt it's actually an issue of efficiency. School may as well not exist for the first three hours or so because the majority of kids are half asleep.
Infuriating to watch
I remember watching a thing on the news here with a politician, an economist and a freaking lawyer talking about the impacts of moving school times. Not a single teacher. All of them agreeing with complete BS because they have no grounding in the subject.
Yep
Scientists have been saying for years that school should start a few hours later
It would be good for schools to shift hours in general
Even that shitty system which explicitly gave half the voting power to the country areas ended up changing in a single electoral cycle when change wasn't even meant to be on the table.
Note I said used to
Trust me, the US system is scuffed as he'll and hands too much power to small states, but this isn't what a country biased system looks like. I've seen one in the old WA system. The state used to be split into 6 districts of equal weighting. 3 country, 3 city.
Probably way more than they should
Cities hold an immense amount of power in the US system
Yeah, that's in the EC
It's winner takes all. New York City singlehandedly controls the vote of the entire state of New York.
Matt, the US system actually explicitly hands most of a states power to large cities.
Representative polling Matt. Also the majority of people live in cities anyway.
Like, we live in a time where more young people view socialism positively (or at least say they do) than capitalism. I think the majority are pretty confused as to what socialism is, but it's something. The propaganda is actually staring to fail.
The young generation is the least effected by the red scare since the 40's
Goals can be helpful even if they're never achieved
The goal of socialism got health care in the UK even though the UK was never a socialist state
We need to have fucking goals

They do, but due to the globalised state of the economy western companies will be involved in some step of the supply chain
because companies are known for their extreme ethics and never lying about the extent of what they're capable of to obtain more business. Like, my actual take on this is that food production should be defacto a national endeavour without space for profit, especially things like formula which is essential. But also you can't just risk supply to get there, or even to a national company doing that job.
that should actually land people in jail, but it won't
Like, if they need to be punished for anything it's the whole supporting slavery in Africa thing
Aware, I mean continuing to operate
pretty much Nestle's entire existence is garbage
Also, this is like, one of the least objectionable things Nestle's ever done
no fucking clue, but due to the way how international capitalism has become ingrained these companies are a key part of production chains which means their removal could cause huge issues for food supply
if you stand in the way of food entering Russia then that's your government
...
The biggest issue with the EU is the way it deals with national enterprise and basically forces states to overly cooperate with corporations
That's really good to see
Kinda requires you to actually believe there's a substantive difference between the last 6 or so US presidents for that to even be relevant
FDR scared the shit out of the capital class
Yeah, you just have to look at why the US has term limits to see that one
Majoritarian governments are the worst for causing corruption honestly
Like, if you want to deal with corruption you need a constitutionally enshrined corruption framework, a minority government system and active ground level anti-corruption campaigns like those often seen in Scandinavia
There's plenty of countries without term limits at all that deal with corruption efficiently. I don't even agree that term limits help here. Politicians also do corruption to enrich themselves directly and this is actually the biggest issue
They can force out figures who are actually popular for arbitrary reasons
Yes but I disagree with the framing. The actual issue there is term limits even existing
if they don't have that you just end up with a monarchy
To be fair though executive orders are the sort of thing that needs excessive checks, or preferably to not exist
The ones that are completely overbearing are things like the filibuster which is designed to stall any policy which isn't bipartisan. And almost all bipartisan legislation is massively pro corporate.
You can have both though, which is actually what we have in effect right now
You kinda have to choose between a strong government or corporate domination. There's no way to have neither.
I think there's an inherent contradiction here that you maybe missed. Governments with this many checks force inaction. It's exactly this inaction that allows corporations to grow as they have. I'm not sure where you get the idea that the US lacks checks and balances from, they're basically hyperactive and stop government from even functioning.
I don't see how '"unconditionally" approved' doesn't mean approved personally

JFC, the swing for Labor actually keeps increasing as the count continues
yeah, fair enough. I'm mostly interested because we're so close to a federal election
SA election happened today
also really bad news for the Libs because the polls were literally spot on, so those 56% Labor federal polls are looking pretty valid
Welp, Labor already won. Looks like it's 54/46. Pretty devastating result 2 months out from a federal election.

So do the Greens
That one's straight forward enough

which is rare
They might even get an effective Senate majority
Basically Labor and the Greens took about 8% of the vote from the right wing, which is likely to result in them controlling the vast majority of the SA house

It's questionable how much this has actually helped anyone

The issue with GDP/capita as a measurement here is that it can be increased by centralising wealth into the hands of a few people more, which is basically what Russia has done for the last few decades
Yeet them
Queensland produces the same shit
one of these views actually makes sense though
Then again, they'd probably include me because "liberals are socialists" or something
The difference between me and them is that I'd include their ideology in my analysis of liberalism, because conservatism is a liberal ideology.
I mean, I can tell by the way that Tweet's worded that it's dumbass Republicans who are talking about people who already share 90% of their ideology anyway <:LuL:789259461470322728>

That is the conventional wisdom but there's actually a lot of cases where it's not true. The first issue is that infectivity and lethality aren't actually unlinked.

I did say that but I did it in live shitpost because like
~~I think I dropped enough hints in that for someone to get it~~
I once saw a guy take out a walking tank with a hand thrown detonator
And to be clear here, I don't think he's a horrible person or anything. I just think he's an American who needs their national mythology to be true and is willing to lie both to his audience and himself in order to maintain that. It still holds true that someone who does that and does dishonest historical analysis like this and doesn't really take it back (much of the video is more "this is what I meant" rather than "I was wrong") isn't actually a reliable source, especially on political matters concerning their own country.
Plus, he still says he leans towards the fucking Google Translate over the one that's like, actually a translation that's looked over by people who speak both languages and generally agreed to be correct, because he's grasping for straws to try to defend the indefensible.
And his entire translation section is still dumb AF even in that video, he can't just admit it was totally dumb and he shouldn't have tried to argue against a validified historical translation with Google Translate, it has to be "but this is what I meant to do"
Like, just as an example he tries to make a claim that Columbus landing in the Caribbean wasn't the start of the slave trade and it was 6 months later when the first slave ship was bought to the Caribbean. Leaves out that that ship was lead by... Columbus, as were the next 5 or so
Or at least downplays several issues/takes absurd stances

If my choices were Macron and Le Pen I honestly think I'd just pack my bags and fucking leave.
Basically the only way to accumulate wealth non exploitatively is to get into a very well paid but generally still useful profession like the medical professions (other than nursing for some reason)
technically all gambling is that but the lottery is a very noteworthy example since it's so visible
It's also a method of control, selling the dream of getting rich quick which helps to destroy class solidarity by making people think they have some small chance at getting rich and becoming the exploiter
Well for starters it's gambling, and like all gambling it can be highly addictive and destructive to those who partake
Want to talk about all the reasons why the lottery is absurdly problematic <:LuL:789259461470322728>
It's impossible to get rich without exploiting people or inheriting the wealth of someone who did. The money that rich people "earn" is the surplus value of labour of their workers.
It's the rich bastards profiting off of them that are the large issue
I mean, most of the poor workers in tobacco are in plantations in poor countries who's choices are either to work or die. I don't blame these people

Ye I'm mostly just saying something I've been thinking a bit about since I heard a really dumb quote from a respected economist because I can
It's the worst social science and I'm being generous even giving it that title <:kirikaDESS:696166094167343125>
Plus, there's some deeply troubling pseudoscientific views writhing econ still. One of the worst is the attempt to prove ideas that are popular rather than forming ideas based on the evidence available.
There's still way too many economists who say whatever they're paid to say and way too little pushback from the field
But you know, look at the point where this line crosses that line, therefore the poor must starve
The only reason this is even still debated is that the majority of economists are hacks. If you do an honest investigation it's impossible to ignore the fact that any profession viewed as a female profession is payed worse.
The ultimate exploiter is still the house however
Most people are not that
everyone is attempting to be an exploiter
You just mean gambling
Oh
No, wage labourers very notably are not. Wage labourers contribute more to a corporation than they get out of it, therefore they are being exploited
Or teacher going the other way, from a generally well paid profession to garbage <:sigh:230149462880813056>
More often than not it's the second best way to ensure your money's being thrown into a void after investing in bitcoin

It's nice to see someone just answer this question well for once
I think it's also important to try not to fixate too much on what's already happened. There's always more going forward. It's better to think about that.

I'm just more pointing out how annoying it is when people like this act as if they're above the fray and their platforms don't give a damn about politics

Which is pretty good considering my uncle is gay and I wouldn't want to deal with the shit that could cause with a more conservative family
I'm so glad that all my family in Australia is from my mum's poor ass Scottish side that basically have politics based off of "fuck Thatcher". Really don't have to deal with any of that crap at least. Just drunk Glaswegian.
Yeah, Alex Jones is a complete asshole and completely deserves this
There's really no way to answer that question
I don't think there's any way to do so without enabling this sort of problem
I think the entire idea of privatizing state assets is incredibly wrong personally
But any movement in that direction would need to come from the people, not the leader
To me it has more to do with how utterly shit the Russian Federation is vs the USSR
I mean, the UK still has an inarguably aristocratic and oligarcic house of parliament, they're not even really hiding it <:LuL:789259461470322728>
I mean, I don't think they're democracies. I'd use the term oligarchies though
I mean, there is but not in the direction you think. The US has historically and continues to be a far bigger imperialist threat to the world than Russia or China
And like, even if it could it wouldn't be worth the cost
*most communists think that the USSR would be better than the modern Russian state. It's just that anyone with a brain can see that this won't bring it or anything even remotely resembling it back
Any communist who supports the Russian invasion is also just an idiot
I mean, I'm pretty close to being a communist. Actual communists understand that the USSR is dead and Russia now has fuckall to do with them.
Yeah, the thing here is that America sucks, in part because of their imperialist tendencies. Russia is doing the exact same shit right now. This isn't an "enemy of my enemy" moment, it's a "it's wrong when anyone does it" moment.
Just remember, we've all had our dumbass toxic moments, especially while younger

^it's an attempt to remove a group of people, just operating within the legal framework they have, while at the same time trying to manipulate that framework to be more hostile to that group
Here's the difference, as a socialist I'm more than happy to tell liberals to shove a cactus up their ass. I don't go out and court their support. These "conservatives" actively go out and seek support from fascists.
Like, I don't like the Dems, but at least they don't fucking do that
and Republicans stand up on stage and dogwistle their support to these people all the time
Which is basically just admitting to it, if you break down what that means.
Plus, a ton of these idiots already call themselves "ethnonationalists" anyway
It's the only term that adequately captures how far right the modern right wing has drifted.
I'd just call both groups by their proper name, fascists <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
You know, even for an Australian election this is kinda crazy. Probably not good news for the Coalition.
North Korea, in their case it's slightly more justified though because if they didn't do what they do they would have just been invaded by now
and by question I mean those are objective negatives <:LuL:789259461470322728>
I don't really see it. In terms of actual advances they've all moved in directions other than F1. There's also the question as to whether advances in what F1 pushes for, mostly speed and acceleration are even good things
Yeah, I've made the argument that racing cars should probably be subject to the same regulations as any other car before
fair call
That's the thing you're meant to learn from
Also, the thing I'm pointing out here is that glorifying people who created a system that collapsed in on itself is pretty fucking dumb. Western social democrats left the rich with way, way too much power which resulted in them eroding and eventually collapsing the systems they had built. Why glorify that? It's a shit legacy.
Plus, maybe it's just me but I don't consider unions that can be busted or democracies that can be rigged that big of a win. Actual workers movements push for worker ownership rather than corporate ownership.
just like all the other social democrats in the west
The system he set up was weak and fallible and did fall to neoliberalism
Calling any western workers movements particularly successful at this point with the world as absurdly capitalist as it is is a bit of a joke.
I'd also point out that utilising Japan/Korea's strategy of weaponised conformity is going to be, rather hard for the west.
and even then they kinda failed this year
At this point the only remaining examples of countries with strong covid responses are China and New Zealand. NZ achieved this by being an island and heavily restricting travel, which is certainly a strategy but not widely applicable.
Like, their strategies failed completely this year
Korea and Japan have similar case numbers to the west
Also, I would point out that regardless of which way you slice it China's covid response has been far more effective than the west's
No, but it was fining them thousands for being out without a reason
Melbourne did
I mean, you kinda can
They have historically given concessions to avoid the guillotine, but that's also quite true in China
Hard disagree. If the oligarchs in the west don't want something it won't happen
It's just different oligarchs <:fuck:789441962554032138>
I think the west is just better at selling the idea it's democratic rather than actually more democratic
I mean, there is but the west does also dip into very strong oligarchic control and commonly fails to actually produce the will of the people
and yeah, that's BS, we can have a conversation about the impact of British propaganda lingering in HK VS the legitimate fear, but there's clearly a lot of people in HK who don't like China and while it's hard to judge if the movement is a true majority, it's at least very large
If it's most and not all then they're probably correct on the balance, but you can certainly push that too far
It is true that the west does have a highly propagandised view of, most things honestly, but especially China. Having said that China is still a great power and still does the standard great power bullshit.
The French system is a giant joke though. It may actually be worse than the British system on the balance <:sigh:230149462880813056>
also, yeah, that's fair enough.
The worst thing is that Le Pen can totally still win
I'd be there for that

Ye, this one. There's a fair few supporting it too

Wait till they realise Star Wars is an allegory for the Vietnam war <:heh:789431887135113241>
Can't make this shit up
they can filibuster any bill
It's really not
No
and just let them pass their crap
or as it is the Republicans gridlock the Dems and the Dems don't fight back
So basically to actually pass anything you need 60% of the senate, otherwise the other party can just gridlock you
because the Republicans can just declare filibuster in the Senate and block bills with 49%
Pretty much
because that totally makes sense
It's where the party in the minority just decides a bill doesn't pass and that you actually need a 60% majority to pass it
<:ChrisYikes:679341065878241292>
Pretty nice that the US system allows the spectre of a president who's already out of office to have such a disproportionate impact
but he just chose the worst option

This seems like a good way to win an election

Since if there's one thing politicians hate more than the people it's actually having to work
Nope, if it did it wouldn't be used nearly as much
Filibusters are one of the most antidemocratic things imaginable honestly
now you just declare it and everyone knows it's dead <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Na, that's how it used to work
You know the saying, they go low, we roll over and die
so the effect is that the senate actually requires a 60% majority
There's not really any special case for this, a filibuster can be declared on anything in the senate
It's a senate measure where any senator can declare they're filibustering and unless 60% of the senate votes to break it the bill is dead
No, he's right. Columbus was the first slaver to run the triangle trade route.
Globalisation under capitalism will always be predatory and rely on neocolonial methods of exploitation of poor countries. As long as capitalism is the dominant system isolationism is preferable

At what point do we criminalise periods because that could have been a child?
Republicans are tough on crime
I don't really give a flying fuck what China does in that lens
I'm talking about what the west does
When the fuck did I mention China?
The west act as a single power back each other on the vast majority of their actions. Pretty much the whole west is very interested in exploiting the global south through the use of the IMF as an example, which would be a strong example of a superpower flexing their economic power.
In a practical sense the West basically acts as a giant power on most issues.
This isn't infighting, this is taking the same stance but hedging it slightly
Like, there's a super clear global north/global south and ex communist split on this one my man
Funny how that works
Map of countries that recognise Palestine's existence
as did the British empire and Rome
The US has continuous infighting on internal matters too
and there has historically been a lot of military alignment too
and also that by acting as a defacto economic block the west acts as more or less a single power
Hold your own nation to a higher standard
The point I'm making is that if you're concerned about China's exploitation then you should be utterly outraged about Italy's
Because superpowers are fundamentally defined by two traits. Their ability to militarily dominate and economically exploit
Also, as much as people love to talk about China's exploitation, they're not the ones who created the global, exploitative economy we live under Cypher. They're just mirroring what the west has been doing for decades now.
Some countries call it adult software engineering
Also the fact that the court is a geriatric mess
Outdated*
Personally I think the whole "appointment for life" thing is the horrendously outraged problem
Probably true
Honestly I think it might be time for the court to suddenly increase to 19 members. I'm sure half the court will vote in favour of it being constitutional.
Basically calling the Libs the royal's pets

So, we can improve on the construction of the whole battery, but improving on lithium itself probably won't happen since it's the simplest metal atom.
yes
Realistically lithium is probably irreplaceable in batteries, anything else we use is probably just going to be budget lithium, because lithium has a lot of very useful properties at a density that nothing else can match
but like, the trans Siberian railway is 100% electrified. If you care you can electrify any length of railway <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Most trains do have a battery though, but it's smaller than most car batteries and basically exists to jumpstart the electrics
The only people I've ever heard seriously suggest it are from America and Canada
It's probably best to just stick with catenaries and third rail for power, when you're running a set route they're kinda just better in every way than any alternative
I'm honestly not even convinced they're better than deiseal really
The batteries on trains are normally just starter batteries or just large enough to run them over small distances without overhead power. Battery powered trains are more of a meme than an actual thing.
The issue is that they're not the ones that are currently consuming giant amounts of lithium as we try to battery power entire sectors that previously ran on fossil fuels
To be fair, there probably are applications where a fast charge time trumps battery life anyway
Moreover any transition to green power should be planned with technology that exists already.

Australia really needs proportional representation. Every election these issues just get worse and worse
There's a chance that a party that received ~31% of the vote might get an absolute majority
Our method of distributing seats totally produces reasonable results though
But no, the Aus greens have a history as social democrats and socialists and are one of the further left and more generally powerful Greens parties on earth
I wouldn't trust him to give a fair analysis on Canada's parties
Like really shitty
Honestly JJ has some shitty political views
They're the best realistic option here
Traditionally they're Australia's largest third party
The Greens are a centre left environmentally focused party
This is actually the lowest share of the vote Labor has had in about 100 years
The Greens and independents were the big winners this election
Not really, both fucking tanked
And Scott stands down as Liberal leader, last visage of this government is gone

It's finally over. I feel way more relief seeing the Libs out of office than I expected to
I wonder if Morrison will stand down tonight. This is a truly giant loss.
Yep
Libs just bleeding seats to everyone
Especially since there's three more seats that are best described as clusterfucks in Queensland, but it seems like they're going either Labor or Greens
Looks pretty good this time round

It's hard to find an example that most people can relate to. Like, it's more similar to the British civil war I guess, but who the fuck remembers that <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
It's not so much a dislike as it is a historical claim to the land. Taiwan was a part of Nationalist China during the civil war, and the only part that remains. Communist China conquered the rest of Nationalist China's land. They would have also conquered Taiwan but the US intervened and stopped them. China never recognised either Nationalist China or Taiwan, think of it as a sort of US/Confederate deal. China just views itself as legitimate and the Nationalists as not. It's be kinda like if the confederates hauled up in one state randomly and the Brits came in to make sure they could maintain the land and threatened to invade if the US ever touched them (when the Brits were more powerful). Regardless of who's in the right the stance makes sense.

Isn't Sinn Fein the largest party in NI now?

*I don't have a both sides mentality, I vote for whichever left wing party has the best policy, which at varying times have been the Greens, Socialist Alliance, Vic Socialists and Workers Party

Only reason I do in the house is because the choices are like, Greens/Labor/4 fascist parties
I have almost no party loyalty. I don't think I've ever voted for the same party in the senate two elections running <:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
that mentality is toxic AF
I'm pretty glad that Australia is actually trending away from politics as team sport right now
yep
Conservatism has everything to do with fear and nothing to do with reasoning
Basically everyone knows that Republicanism will eventually win out in Northern Ireland and Unionists are shit scared of that fact.

Kinda amazed I've been working in a school 5 weeks now and not got covid
One of my workmate's son had covid and she actually managed to avoid it by masking up/isolating
I don't see value in management or investing capital. I think corporate leadership should be democratic
Which is basically one of the largest steps towards democratic socialism
The only moral way of doing business is to only have workers who generate actual revenue and no managers, investors or bosses who scrape away the wealth they generate
*also minus costs of business but I don't think anyone contends that point
And I use the word exploitation in the technical Marxist sense. Profit=exploitation since (product of labour)-wage=profit
All businesses exploit their workers
yes it does
yes
It is more indirect/harder to see how profit/labour relate for public sector though
But the point is that the profit the government makes is the excess product of these workers labour that they are not paid, and I have no issue with any system that allows them to reclaim a small amount of that
That would be a Marxist argument
The government profits by tax, and if they were actually paying those civil servants the value of their labour they'd have a salary well into the millions
and are maintained in every country I know of by civil servants
Road and rail keep the entire economy functional
Like, if your job is to maintain rail tracks you probably have one of the highest possible returns on your labour out of anyone in our society
But what I'm talking about is more civil service
ye
Military is pretty worthless
Government jobs often keep the most important parts of the economy functional and have huge flow on impacts
That's horseshit
There'd be no profit because bosses contribute nothing
No, Cypher that's an absolute misunderstanding. There'd still be a product, that is the product of labour
???
*this is true in both public and private sectors
If workers were paid the full product of their labour there would be no profit left
Not even, this is pretty basic economics. Profit comes from the excess product of worker labour that's being taken by the owners
The business only exists by exploiting you, so I really don't take issue with it
That's an upside. A way for employees who are being exploited for wealth creation to reclaim a small amount
One of the Liberal MPs had the best breakdown of the Australian election this time round

IDK, maybe things that have a high potential to kill people should require training and a licence or preferably just be illegal
Someone who has fuckall idea what they're doing kinda just accomplishes nothing by default
ehhhh, I still wouldn't say it's the worst. Someone who's a highly effective union buster, pushes terrible conditions and gets good results is worse
it's just more annoying
It is, but malicious incompetence just generates the same outcomes as regular incompetence
and this is what I believe the vast majority of management to be
Malicious competence is worse than incompetence. It also generates stress, but pushes towards an active worsening of your conditions to benefit the boss
at least they wouldn't be maliciously competent
Literally an incompetent manager would be preferable to average manager
Everything, bosses act in their own interests regardless of the interests of their workers. They'll burn a corporation to the ground for 2 extra dollars. They install people into leadership positions based entirely on their own interests. Often this is in direct conflict with the interests of workers, as an example bosses will often hire managers willing to union bust.
...you say that like the owner class doesn't frequently burn through companies because they see a way to generate profit from it
Like, you can talk about people not knowing their own interests, but the reality of this situation is that they're far more likely to act on their interests than a disconnected boss who doesn't really care
Not building a company in that way assumes that bosses know what their workers best interests are and will actually act on them, or more realistically just doesn't care
it's not in the workers best interests
it's in the bosses best interests to install someone who'll do this
But I'd also point this out Kat, one of the best ways that companies can increase their profits (which are actually what managers are about, not conditions) is to worsen conditions and pay for workers
I care about giving people some right to self determination
at all
also I don't actually care about managers skills
Yet it's extremely common for several companies to have completely inept management that's well known to be inept and still drive huge profits
The way how management is appointed right now has nothing to do with qualification (although even if it did I wouldn't care) and everything to do with control
You act as if middle management is remotely qualified now
and it isn't a good goal anyway
there is no system that has ever or could ever provide it
There's no such thing as meritocracy
*people actually working for companies usually have a better idea about what a workplace needs than a disconnected boss does anyway
rather than letting their boss put in whatever hotheaded abusive PoS they can find for the role
It's about giving people some actual power over their own lives
There's no guarantee anyone will vote for the right party or leader, why not just get rid of that too?
Even if that's true, which I have my doubts about, we can let workers vote on who their middle management is
I'd prefer a circus than a rich autocrat running their own personal kingdom.
Democratic socialism is just a good goal from where we are now
But like, ultimately I question if a corporation can even be moral. Even if it operates as a flat hierarchy that pays its workers fairly for their labour, that's still something that would be best moved away from eventually in favour of a more cooperative society. It's still exploitative, just not of its own workers.

Gotta love that ~15% of people still aren't in favour of interracial marriage

Stalin was the worst leader of the USSR
Plenty of communists argue in favour of the USSR but arguing in favour of North Korea is a bit weird
British Tories dumb as fuck
He survived
So probably Boris
Considering there's a Tory majority they'd have no problems, but the new PM would just be the leader of the Tory party
Probably not, if the house can decide on a new PM then it's fine
The issue is that if the Tory party then opted not to do a leader swap internally Boris would probably just become PM again
I don't think a vote of confidence would oust the Tory party. They still have majority. It would definitely oust Boris assuming about 30 Tories voted for though, since confidence votes include everyone in the house.
Just to answer this as well, ultranationalist, racial supremacist, anti-immigration politics usually also taking all the other shitty far right ideas along with it
which is pretty expected
Also because capitalist solutions to climate change are generally just pretty shit anyway. At best they just tend to move numbers around on a spreadsheet
in fact, we're making manufacturing and shipping actively worse with the way how we handle manufacturing now
Because much of the global emissions are in things like manufacturing, shipping and military which no-one is actually targeting reductions for
and as long as capitalist consumer culture continues to exist it literally doesn't matter how many solar panels and wind turbines we install, that line's going to stay exactly where it is
Of course it doesn't, that's why I said the world needs to be rebuilt, because the world where we continue with this BS is completely unacceptable
Kinda like this is a problem
That's kinda what the world's been doing
Like 1/4
It probably won't be 1/3rd of the population by then, but something similar to that yes
The existential dread is that we're on track for 2-3 billion people in the global south to die or be displaced
I mean, until fascists take over due to migration
if you're staying in Europe you'll be mostly insulated against the impacts of climate change. The only real notable changes would be less out of season fruits/vegetables, more storms and erratic weather and migrants fleeing from places that were hit worse
This is a rich vs poor nations issue
What we do now just varies that number
For people in the global south there's a good amount who are already doomed
You live in Ireland. You won't reach that stage
We're in the damage mitigation stage now
Ten years ago
but climate change is the reason why this isn't optional
Society needs to be rebuilt because capitalism is utterly unable to cope with climate change, amongst other issues
The first step to rebuilding society into something better is increased worker ownership of business and a reduction in corporate ownership. This can either be through public ownership of assets or through workers being given far more control over corporations they work for. The second step would be radical wealth redistribution.
it's better than just doing nothing, but it's actually just damage mitigation that's ultimately destined to fail
Regulating capitalism doesn't even work. The capitalists with wealth and power will use their power to wind back the regulations on capitalism.
Personally though I only vote for people who talk about trains
yeah
Honestly most political decisions end up effecting you somehow
I'd make a slightly more historical and material argument that the formation of cities in the early ancient era created a wealth inequality that was self perpetuating and that has been a part of humanity ever since
I'd take Castro over Batista any day
Cuba is definitely better for not having as much US influence
NK is a special case, but they're also pretty irrelevant all things considered
No, but the systems that have shaped China and Russia are US created
Like, even modern Russia was created by US influence and US backed liberalisation
To be fair though, a more moderated version of that statement, something like most of the problems that have come about and are perpetuated in the post war world stem in some way from the US is just true
~~just the root of most evil~~
Also, I'd point out that climate change is a mostly capitalist issue that impacts you no matter where you live and it doesn't really have a good capitalist solution
A lot of socialists take a wider world view, it's not just about what impacts them
Like, China's a pretty mixed bag. They're not really worse than the west but not really better either. Maybe they had the potential to be better at some point but they sure as fuck lost it
Capitalism can't save us from capitalism in short
https://youtu.be/wL9z4n7PIBk?t=386
Just as a response to this, mostly from this timestamp but really the whole video explains it pretty well
The more capitalists steal from workers the more fascists and socialists they create. Unfortunately it seems like they create more fascists
The fact that the Soviet economy was even competitive is a testament to how strong their economic policy was
But even if they didn't you realise were talking abot Russia, a country that a few decades prior was one of the smallest and weakest economies in Europe and a few decades later would return to having a highly troubled economy right?
Before the liberalisation of the USSR the economy was growing at a rate fast enough to most likely do so
The crappy Soviet style economy that was stronger than Russia's modern economy has ever been and was at points predicted to become the largest in the world
Also, again, the US rigged Russia's second election
There were nations that resisted or even reversed liberalisation in the 90s
The US put huge amounts of pressure on Russia to liberalism their economy and rigged Russia's second election to ensure that the comunists didn't win, but sure, I guess the US played no part in it.
Stagnation isn't always followed by recovery. The 90's were the worst era overall for Russia. The stagnation (which was in itself caused by liberalisation in the USSR) was followed by an age of decay, which is worse.
They keep talking about banning cars too. They're so close to the point
Teslas are slightly less safe than strapping a rocket to your arse and farting in the direction you want to go.
Sure I guess. But like, from my point of view Mendeleev was far greater than Khan or Columbus. Unlike them he contributed something net positive to the world. I probably don't think like the average person or like a dictator would want me to think though.
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
Take pride in Dmitri Mendeleev or something
Same with Columbus being an insane slaver
That's the thing I really don't get. I'd want to like, not be associated with him at all
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Why'd you want to claim Columbus or Gengis Khan though
Dad used to get very mad at me and my brother for not caring about driving at all. He kinda stopped caring at some point when we both just lived our lives perfectly capably for years without driving. IDK why he thought we couldn't, my uncle's been doing so here for like 15 years or some shit <:LuL:789259461470322728>
I think it's just the whole boomer "can't imagine living without a car" thing along with being fairly environmentally conscious
I actually really struggle to make sense of what the hell's going on in their heads, because they 100% understand that green capitalism will have a limited at best impact on climate change and that there needs to be government action. My mum's a Greens member <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
That's the weird thing, they don't
so at least that's something
Most teslas don't actually have it
To be fair self driving isn't really legal here
yep
very stubborn, won't listen to others and has to make his own mistakes
but this is how my dad is
I tried to talk them into getting a GM/Nisan/Kia/whatever else electric
It's a fucking gas efficient Kia, it wouldn't be hard to sell anyway
I don't know why they don't
They could just pawn the old car
The others don't
Tesla accepts trade ins for old cars
all that shit
that they're way less safe than a Nisan or Kia
We explained this to them. That they're way less functional than any of the major car manufacturers, that there's huge issues with Tesla's solvency that could result in the car becoming an unsupported piece of junk etc.
Freedom though
ye
My electric bike is great. Don't think I'll ever own a car in my life
won't listen
Both my brother and I explained why it's a horrible idea and even if they want an electric they're far better off going with literally anyone else
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
My parents want to get one for some reason
revolutionary
Ahhh yes, the autopilot that can't even drive the cars in a straight line around a tunnel with no human driven cars
http://bovagrai.info/auto/2020/media/2.5e-01.svg
Uhhhh, not tiny image
This is in Europe
No it's not, there's actual studies on this. Cars have been getting larger and larger over time across most of the world
But it's just generally true that cars have been trending larger and heavier for decades now
I mean, even their existence is an issue
The fact that this exists terrifies me
but like
It's not as bad as the US here
Australia
not the engines
ICEs as in the cars
Honestly at this point it's just becoming a most cars problem. Most ICEs are way bigger than they need to be.
that a reduction of guns causes people to just seek other weapons
that's just a BS NRA talking point
Also, all the statistics I've seen suggest that isn't true
Because it's the kind that can be directly linked to the specific policy we're talking about
Even those that claim "common sense restrictions" are failing to deliver on that
And what I pointed out, and will continue to point out is that all countries with high rates of gun ownership have more gun crime than those without
anything less than that is absurd
I think the absolute bare minimum for ownership of tools designed to kill should be extensive restriction
That's just common sense
It's insensitive to tell Americans that thinking they should have a right to own literal murder machines made primarily for that purpose is stupid as hell?
The presence of guns in any circumstance escalates situations and makes them less safe
Hunting is a shitty practice that shouldn't be supported, vets have other options, using guns for safety would make Orwell proud
On the other hand a gun is a weapon firstly
It can be used as a weapon but its primary utility is a tool
A hammer is a tool
A sword and a bow and arrow are also weapons
They're weapons
Guns are inherently destructive and bad
It can just be toxic and destructive
Sometimes culture just needs to change
There's many reasons behind violent crime rates varying (including just what is classified) but gun crime increases pretty much in a perfect relationship with how guns are restricted
That's what we're actually talking about
Their gun violence rates are 3x higher than Aus and 15x higher than the UK
But my point is that they're far less successful than countries like the UK and Australia who do restrict, who in turn are less successful than counties like Japan and Korea who restrict to nearly the point of banning
When I think of a gun restrictive country in Europe it's the UK
and they have a higher rate of violence in general
Switzerland isn't actually that restrictive. They're one of the less restrictive countries in Europe
And more gun deaths than countries like Australia and the UK that are more restrictive
To me, it makes a complete ban the best solution
There's a nearly perfect relationship between how strict gun regulation is and how many shootings occur
Also I'd take no issue with banning the AR15 it clearly wouldn't fix the issue but it's not at all a bad thing. As long as that wasn't the only thing done
Reinstating the Clinton era assault ban would do something however.
The logistics of doing anything serious about this are borderline impossible. Honestly even what they're suggesting here will be heavily resisted
Just like it's not a reason to not strive for a gun free country ultimately
It's not a reason to not do them
Like these reforms are going to have the exact same issue
...you say that like that won't happen with any minor reform
It doesn't miss the point it's just a much more zero tolerance approach
I think banning guns is a pretty good ultimate end goal. It's ambitious but it's something worth actually striving for
This isn't enough and people should continue to push for more. This is probably going to have a very small impact on gun violence at best and more drastic action will need to be taken.
I actually do think that the government should have some sort of a duty of care to minimise the risks of injury or death to citizens where possible
I think where possible we should also be legislating to reduce the risk from those other things too, railings around the tops of buildings, platform screen doors on public transport, fewer cars on roads etc
But guns existence is a huge issue in and of itself and I firmly believe we'd be far better off without them
There are also other things to be done
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
No, but guns when accessible make success rates absurdly high
I'm sure it would have no impact and that's why they're constantly near the top of gun death rates while the UK with the most effective gun control is at the bottom. At bare minimum it would likely prevent a lot of suicides which is worth doing anyway
The lowest is the UK in almost every case
I've been using this site for my numbers and the general rule of thumb across all sites I can find say Switzerland is one of the worst alongside Finland/France/Austria
https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/gun-deaths-by-country
Switzerland has one of the highest rates of gun crime in Europe
I mean, a graph of gun ownership against gun crime is basically a line. Unless something weird happens in that transition between the 0.2% legal ownership in Korea and actual 0%, which can't be ruled out but seems unlikely then it's reasonable to conclude that any policy that will reduce gun ownership will reduce gun crime, which is a factor of violent crime and worth pursuing. It doesn't solve the problem, but it does reduce it to a fairly negligible level which then means focus on other areas is easier.
there would also need to be other work done for sure
I'm saying banning guns is a part of solving the problem
I'm also not saying that we should ban guns and act like the problem's solved
London and Stockholm have started moving in that direction though
and city
Depends on the country
Because banning knives and hammers actually has negative consequences for society whereas guns do not. I'm also in favour of heavy restriction of cars and an effective ban within urban limits, guns are far from the only issue that's not being addressed.
the goal should be zero
I think Japan and Korea which are restrictive enough to be an effective ban are pretty close
Then you're arguing for half fixing the problem IMO. I don't think Australia or the UK have acceptable gun homicide rates
The US isn't special in any way other than how far they've let themselves slide with their utter inaction
nations that bring in heavy gun restrictions see lower rates of violent crime following that most of the time
It's a pretty common thing
And?
A reduction in guns all other things being equal does make violent crime less likely to occur, Australia's stats back this up, very little else changed here but violent crime plummeted
That's a BS narrative
it's not as simple as "take away guns and people use knives"
violent crime is made up of so many different factors that it's complex to track
in any way
But it's not even true
I mean, are any of those worth the costs of keeping one of the most concealable weapons available. They seem like fairly marginal benefits to me. It's not like we're talking about knives which can be dangerous but also have clear and large utility. Feels like a pretty weak reason to keep them around to me
I've seen what they do with them <:sigh:230149462880813056>
If there's one group of people I don't want owning guns in Aus it's the armed forces
Good luck pulling a riffle out of your sleeve
they are by far the most dangerous guns
it should be handguns
I think I've said before that if you're going to ban any one kind of gun
I don't know how representative Melbourne is on this though since something like 1/5 here have Chinese decsent now
I know a really good Sichuan noodle place in the city for example
Honestly I'd run from any resteraunt that called itself Chinese anyway. That's the shitty noodlebox stuff. The good ones use their regional speciality, at least here.
sanctions don't work. Never have, never will. Utterly unsurprising
Shocking
The thing literally everyone said would happen?
Elon is a union buster, he doesn't like anyone in his companies questioning him
But yeah, if I were the publisher I'd cut ties too, pretty disgusting
I feel like the better play for the publisher here would have been to not deny and just straight up say they did it due to the level
Happens every time I walk past a church
Normally there's like, one thing that isn't completely horrible
Can we just hurry up and extinction ourselves?
I hate humanity
Also two of the world's major producers of goods don't even follow the sanctions anyway
and Kat, you said it yourself, they're just scavenging them from consumer goods and will simply continue to do so
I must have missed the part where anyone was actively trading Russia any military equipment before the civilian sanctions came into effect
I've just not seen the evidence that the sanctions are actually working. All they seem to have accomplished is increasing Russian stability. Russia's war effort hasn't really been heavily hindered by anything bar inept tactics, now that they've just reverted to more standard tactics they're slowly taking ground. Military sanctions were already in place and I don't think I've seen anyone argue against but civilian sanctions seem to be doing little of value while doing large amounts of damage. I don't think this is choosing the lesser of two evils, I think it's inflicting pointless damage on civilians.
It feels like it needs to be said sometimes
I'd say the same shit in pretty much any case. Random people suffering because of the actions of world powers and their geopolitical bullshit is always bad. It was bad in every war actually.
What they said is pretty reasonable here, the Russian sanctions have been fairly ineffective at just about everything
Calling someone out for being Russian is pretty yikes honestly
He's literally the exact same as Obama, which is the issue
He's just the status quo
I don't even like Biden but no
Protect the grid (from government regulation)
Yeah, that too probably
"Medical freedom" is an argument they use against a centralised single payer health care system
At least if you understand the dogwistles
but they managed to not even do that
A lot of comedians just aren't very funny
It's mostly just a way to ensure that major parties never have serious competition
This is literally the reason why district systems just shouldn't exist
Like, your one vote should count for something
It depends how you view the expression "one person one vote", to me the system fails because there's an implied proportionality in that statement
Yep, that's true too
The US really does feel like it tried to create the worst voting system possible at every step possible
*Unless you're in Nevada or Vermont
In a proportional system people tend not to just continue supporting parties that fuck them
I'd still argue that even in the US it's mostly to ensure the two party system doesn't fail
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
yep. and if you vote for anyone else Democrat voters will chastise you then wonder why they lose
Apparently you have to live with their policy even if the lib wins
Plus, I also just disagree that people should vote for the lesser evil, you should vote for who you want to win. If doing that causes the Republicans to win that isn't in any way your fault. It's the fault of the Democrats for sucking enough to lose to actual fascists.
I mean, you should vote for them in whatever case you can
And the US 100% needs either 3rd or different parties
Like, if you ever want 3rd parties to be viable you have to be willing to advocate, campaign for them and vote for them, otherwise they'll never get anywhere
If workers in the UK did that in the late 1800's and early 1900's then the UK would still be stuck with the Liberals and Tories
I'd like to see something happen here but I don't have a ton of hope
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I thought universities were turning people into marxists though
Or Irish people in general honestly
This is probably one of the dumbest forms of blind nationalism though.
Oh hey, look, it's an idiot
I think there were like, three total who weren't or something
The Founding Fathers were shitty slavers
I mean, good
They want to though
This is pretty interesting. Australia doesn't have a majority religion anymore and almost as many are non-religious as Christian
He did claim responsibility though
It makes sense, it's just not designed for you
But if she doesn't win she won't be able to pass anything <:Kapp:789259331072819241>
I don't value improvements in self driving
That's actually more dangerous than just not having it
Yes, but they're still pretty shit
I'd be sending it to law makers telling them they're insane for letting these things exist on roads honestly.
But like, I'd rather just go to Italy or Greece or something if I wanted a fairly relaxing vacation <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
Also can someone explain to me why cruises are enjoyable? I don't fucking get it. You spend time on a boat with nothing to do, then stop off somewhere cool for like, an afternoon then have to be cattled back onto the shitty boat again. Why not just go straight to the cool place?
Brawls are more dangerous when everyone involved is over 60
Maybe we should build some kind of guidelines for them to run on, then since they're running set routes we could link them together for better efficiency.
That's like, the whole point
Also at least in theory self driving is meant to make better decisions than people, not the same dumbass ones
Apparently later on in the drive it tried to turn into pedestrians and even the musk supporter had to admit it was shit and turn it off
Doesn't explain why it thinks getting tboned by a bus is a good idea
It thought it was a bus
Yes
To the point where they can't even work out self driving in a closed tunnel
Tesla is the worst
It's not just Tesla
Self driving cars are such a shitty idea
https://mobile.twitter.com/taylorogan/status/1542971644355936256?s=21&t=gA3f21xKNYDm62xGHl-_CQ
Maybe it's time to admit that this is a problem and start taking serious steps around climate change
Yeah, pretty much every year
Second one this year
New South Wales is having another "once in 100 year flood"
At the same time there are genes that it's completely worth talking about this for. A really good example would be Muscular Dystrophy, the most common cause of which is caused by a single mutated gene that could be corrected.
The largest issue with self driving cars is that they're absurdly dangerous
Yes it is, but that research doesn't put people in danger and has to be checked by ethics committees
Modifying the genetics of a person, usually to remove a gene which is causing detrimental effects to their health.
Maybe we should ban them on roads until he can get them to drive around his tunnels without crashing
There are serious ethical reasons why humans are not ready to begin human genetic engineering in general yet. We do not know fully all of the potential impacts it could have.
I've studied genetics too BTW
I hard disagree
Human genetic engineering
Research in more useful fields has been banned on ethical grounds
Ban that research
Especially when Muskmobiles love to veer into oncoming pedestrians
I still don't think it's worth doing
The actual third kind of rail that can work in dense urban areas is heavy rail
Many things beat monorail
Even the strongest BRT systems only have like half the capacity of Melbourne's commuter rail lines, for example
Na, trains beat the everliving fuck out of busses too
Cars are the least efficient way to transport people capacity wise
But like, funiculars have existed for a long ass time too
The gap has closed significantly if recent times
Not specialised or anything, just regular heavy rail
There's rails that run up it
I live at the foothills of a mountain
Get cars off the road and busses won't need it either
Driverless metro has been a thing for years
Not of this scale
Also transit doesn't need AI to self drive
No, it would not
It's an attempt to sustain car use in places where they really aren't needed.
No, it doesnt
Because there's better options than continuing to build out cities around car usage. Self driving is putting a bandaid over a gaping wound when really what we need is more transit and to disincentivise cars in general.
I think it's a dead end technology that isn't worth the time to persue
We just don't modify the gene, just make like, 8 viable fetuses and only select those without the MD gene, it's a pretty commonly done thing by parents who know they're at risk and it's basically germ line therapy without doing any genetic modifications.
We already kind of let people do this with IVF anyway
The argument would be if we should modify germ line cells of carriers of muscular dystophy moreso
Muscular Dystrophy is also treated in a similar way
Since it's not germ line
It's worth noting that this isn't really controversial gene therapy though
Yeah, it's actually a really good thing to test on
Genetically modified organisms
Faliure is probably the wrong word since lactose tolerance is actually the mutation
But yes, lactose intolerance is a single gene
I know for some people who are lactose intolerant just taking lactase allows them some degree of lactose tolerance
I'd need to look into exactly what they did
Kinda like regular cars
GATACA vibes
Yes, that's common practice in psychology
Although there's also just some things that are purely negative too like diabetes and celiacs that are probably also worth treating
Yep, probably. This is why I always hold the position of "if a genetic disorder isn't either completely debilitating or life threatening it probably shouldn't be treated"
Scientists do think about ethical issues
No, not the genes, the reaction to and usage of gene therapy
Believe me, geneticists have highlighted that problem before, it is viewed as a very real potential issue.
I think she's more talking about people who have no clue what they're talking about
The UK's politics are counterproductive stupidity, the US's are just hopeless
When Tories start backstabbing it gets brutal
A meteor could be headed for the earth and liberals would tell you the solution is to vote

<:ChrisYikes:679341065878241292>
"see where this line meets this line, that's why the poor must starve"
This is actually the one fucking socialist meme about liberal economics
The same Lord Starmer who's wing of the party lead the effort to make sure Corbyn lost
It's also an implied stance of capitalism
A lot of people don't even want to admit that the exploitation is benefitting them.
The issue is, that while you may not be thinking of it there is an alternative answer which is actually the more mainstream political stance of wealthy nations. Neocolonial exploitation and wealth generation. And a lot of people will not actually agree with the actions that would be needed to address that because it would result in a reduction in wealth in the west.
But the neoliberal argument actually does argue in favour of those things, even if they won't explicitly admit it
But if you don't point out the flaws in that argument and you just lay it out you're making it
You can read in the counterargument if you'd like, but the article doesn't really make it
I think the point here is that if you lay out an argument without actually rebuking it then you're just making that argument
That is what the article is advocating, it's been taken out of context from the original author's work, so it's not really his fault, it's whoever cropped this passage from his book without adequate context.
>Much of the hunger literature talks about how it is important to assure that people are well fed so that they can be more productive. That is nonsense. No one works harder than hungry people. Yes, people who are well nourished have greater capacity for productive physical activity, but well-nourished people are far less willing to do that work.
It's literally laying out the neoliberal argument for food inequality
it is false, there's enough food on earth to feed every person
and yes
Like, I think it is a cut out of a larger argument that opposes this point of view, but why is the UN just posting this?
I read the article and it's pretty fucking disgusting
Can't wait for Boris to bring the US back under the crown
<a:02puke:465210481208983562>
Tony Abbott got floated in British politics at some point for some reason
It was just a dumb statement from a dumb person
Never stopped Thatcher from waging wars <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
100%
It's better to live in a country where police don't have guns
I don't think there's really a good way to stop someone who's willing to go to those lengths to see a former politician dead
It happened at a speech apparently, so yeah, it's targeted
Ah, that makes more sense. Fuck Musk
That's a new one
Liberals always side with fascists
Did anyone else see that Macron decided to form an alliance with Lepen's party rather than the socdems in the French parliament?
Yeah, Abe did damage to the Japan/China relationship if anything by continuing to do nothing in the way of recognising Japans war crimes in WW2
American nationalists might want to avoid taking a hard stance against state sponsored political assassinations.
The "Japan needs gun control" comments are American right wingers trying to equivocate a rare occurrence in Japan with a common one in the US. They're actually arguing the US doesn't.
https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/AG101_(unaired)
no, that's a lot earlier on, and also did air in Japan
Never aired to my knowledge
that's fine
it's just not the time to air it
The ep got made
It's not really censorship since the country is completely fine with a show with a joke about assassinating the PM
There's also an episode of Pokemon that never aired because it was set to air shortly after an earthquake and involved a Wishcash using the move earthquake
There's a cultural difference in the way how Japan handles situations like this and the US
The reason why Teppen is skipping an ep is basically a case of really bad timing, the upcoming ep contained a plotline about a joke about assassinating the prime minister of Japan
I could understand removing a drowning or something
They did delay Fire Force after the KyoAni attack
It was probably just the pre existing trend of increasing cyclist deaths continuing in the background
so <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
For motorbikes though, they actually do statistically help
Someone did an analysis on mandatory helmet laws here and found that more than 100% of reduction in death after the implementation of helmet laws actually comes from a reduction of cycling in the years following, paradoxically helmet laws actually made bikes more dangerous for those who kept riding
Yeah, because right wing nuts don't need to use all thirty of their guns
Go to the Vatican and shoot a bishop then complain about the insane rate of homicide in the Vatican
Political instability can also cause gun violence and Chile hasn't been politically stable since before Pinochet
This one
There are consequences for nationalism though. I'm aware that they wouldn't want to change this, but not changing it will always increase the risk of violence
Yeah, I don't think this will happen to be clear
It's about the only effective change I could think of though
But like, the cynical political play would just be to attack guns anyway
would actually be the best thing to reduce the odds of this happening again
Probably better screening for the JSDF
but it's something I could see a government doing just to capitalise
it's probably not needed
Yes, but there's still areas where they could be further regulated
it utterly fails at it
Pretty much
Although given Japan I think the increase in regulation would be more likely
I don't think it's likely to change anything honestly. I can't see "there's people who want politicians dead" as a good rational to reduce gun control and I can't see how increasing gun regulation would help
It has 9 chambers so it has 9 shots, the idea of this sort of thing is that you don't reload it.
So like, a minute per chamber if you're good at reloading
Manually
Actually quite simple
It's basically a musket in function. It has a charge and bullets loaded, to reload it you need to reinsert both the charge and a new bullet.
Been like three years since I drove last and I don't plan to again for any reason
Honestly if I'm going on holiday I'm either going to cycle or use PT
That's as fast as I really feel I need anyway though
I think mine cuts out at 25km/h
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
I'd be fine with a fine for cycling on footpaths if they started fining asses who park in cycle lanes
it's unenforced in practice
Same here technically
I still can't believe there's actually cities in the US that just, don't really build footpaths
in which case I'd use it on some roads
Unless there's a footpath
It's actually safer to cycle nearer the centre of the road and force cars to get out of lane to overtake you generally
but like, Australian city design sucks
If I lived in a place less hostile to cycling I don't think I'd really bother with a helmet
They can drag him through court for damages
But they don't have to
His best case scenario at this point is probably Twitter accepting the 1 bill exit clause
Twitter absolutely played Musk's dumb arse
But the thing here is, actual gradual reform from an absolute monarchy doesn't work. Something needs to happen to force that reform. Even in the UK you had the British civil war and Cromwell basically making the royal family live in fear.
Oh, I misread that
Unless your blaming the socialists for kidney failure
One Tsar
And the other thing is, the socialists did keep fighting and eventually did overthrow the monarchy.
People do not have omniscient knowledge of the future
Yes, an autocrat was very likely to move away from authoritarianism even when he ruled with a great degree of direct control and fought strongly against giving that up.
No assassination is ever going to be as badass as the Russian communist who threw dynamite into the Tsar's carriage though
He probably went for the one he could conceal if I had to guess
I don't see why someone would want more than that.
If you even get to your 9th shot in an assassination attempt then the security is hilariously inept.
Nothing to hide, nothing to fear right?
From all the research I've seen a tribunal produces more accurate sentences on average than juries anyway.
Rare occasion here, but I agree with Cypher on this one. Juries have all the same problems as judges when it comes to biases but lack the legal experience that judges have. There's a really good reason why defence lawyers in Aus always tell their clients never to ask for trial by jury.
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Why you got to do this to me
Temporarily embarrassed millionaires
yeah, I couldn't ride a motorcycle either
I'm just not able to compartmentalise how dangerous even low speed driving is and ignore that. Later on when I used to drive I ended up hyperventilating a few times after driving. I'm still not even that good about being in cars with other people.
Pretty much this
actually how the hell do people not get anxious driving? Honest question. It's one of the most terrifying things I can imagine doing
not owning a car has actually been fantastic for my mental health, I got so anxious whenever I drove
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
Don't buy a car and pocket the money
It is but it's not legal to fly without a radio that connects to air traffic which uses computers anyway
I think it's complete insanity
The original point was that I don't understand how people can get casual around it
Yes, I said as much earlier
and also I don't think that it's a good thing to get used to something that's absurdly dangerous
but the point I'm making is that reducing the potential for human error in these situations is always a good thing. And there's no practical way to drive without a giant risk of human error
You say that as if moving away from human centric to automation centric workhouse management wouldn't be a huge net positive for humanity
or if they do we heavily use computers to mitigate that risk as is the case in rail and air travel
most of them don't have the ability to kill you in an instant
which is a stress
it's pointing out that driving creates scenarios that our biology is not equipped to deal with
...do you even know what the word "stresses" means?
You are massively overestimating both the skill of the average driver and the ability of human physiology to cope with the stresses of driving
it's not safe though
It's completely normal
it's just how the brain works
Everyone ends up zoning out when they drive
literally humans are just unable to stay focused on completely mundane tasks like driving
the same is true for cycling and walking
*it's almost impossible not to drive distracted
Also the reason why trains are so energy efficient, they actually do something about friction
Unless it's a Harley, which are only efficient at converting fuel into noise pollution
Motorbikes are almost always more fuel efficient than cars, there's not really a "letting it coast" scenario. The largest impact on speed is friction, which is actually worse for the car than the bike
but like, I just cycle <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
although I do think I'd feel better on one than a car since my shit perception of where the passenger side is wouldn't be an issue
if an SUV hits you you go under it
It is just true though that modern large SUVs are some of the most dangerous cars for pedestrians. If a smaller car hits you you go over the hood
that's the reason why
The bike stops easier
a car, bike and train at 30 all carry hugely different forces due to different masses
It's an extreme example to show why forces vary by weight
there's a huge difference in force imparted
That's wrong, get hit by a bike at 30 and a car at 30
A heavier car exerts more force on anything it impacts by definition
The amount of force something imparts is directly proportional to its mass and speed Iski
The increased force is more mass
no crumple
But SUVs just go over people
or roundabouts, which are hugely dangerous for cyclists but far safer for cars
like slip lanes
There are also design choices that do the same
It's the cars themselves getting larger, better able to cope with the stresses imparted on them during a crash, but also exerting greater forces
assumed fault laws
Lower speed limits, smaller cars
which is nice
*also the US bought its car deaths down pretty much exclusively by making cars safer for their occupants at the expense of everyone else and achieves a reduction in car deaths by just not counting people who were not in a car
They're very significant
Which is a whole other thing
Cars are the second largest cause of death among under 21 year olds in the US with firearms only overtaking them this year I believe
which I think is something that people talking about this miss
also, drivers licences should be insanely hard to get just like piolet licences
that is clearly not the case though
correct
there's few enough that the odds of being involved in a small aircraft crash are not worth considering
the key word is relevant
and unlike cars idiots flying small aircraft will never pose a relevant risk to anyone other than themselves
like as in a small enough number not to really care about
There's an insignificant amount of small aircraft
Most people will never fly a small aircraft outside of controlled areas
But like, I'm not talking about that, I'm talking about commercial flights there.
The long and short of it is depending on how well the roundabout is designed it can be anywhere from a small reduction to a 60+% increase in cyclist crashes. And the UK in general is closer to the high end
Iski if you know how to access articles behind a paywall I have a study here
but unlike roundabouts it actually improves safety
that's doing nothing but lowering traffic flow
Like, I support installing traffic calming on most if not all residential streets
what I care about is that roundabouts are a piece of infrastructure which takes risk off the shoulders of drivers and puts it onto pedestrians somewhat, and cyclists greatly
lower traffic flow is arguably an advantage
As I said I really don't give a fuck about traffic flow
but like, this isn't even the point
and then have to accelerate
people stop for those too
The same is true of roundabouts
It's still true even if you factor acceleration, this has been done multiple times
It gets garbage once it's above like, three lanes
I can cross a lighted intersection south to north across a single road
a 4 way stop is less garbage than a roundabout
but even more than that, I can tell you from experience that even small roundabouts are worse for bikes than any other option
How would I? That's the issue
Let's pretend I want to cross this as a pedestrian, south to north
but that's an example of working around the problem you created
the tunnels I guess
well
Like, how the fuck would I cross that Rady?
especially if they're large/have multiple lanes feeding in
And again, the main thing I care about is that roundabouts are more dangerous for everyone who isn't in a car
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263370613_Efficiency_of_Roundabouts_as_Compared_to_Traffic_Light_Controlled_Intersections_in_Urban_Road_Networks
Firstly, welcome to Leicester, enjoy your stay
I just prefer traffic lights because roundabouts are a garbagefest to navigate as a pedestrian or cyclist, especially large ones
And to be clear here, I don't think chasing the best throughput is the correct thing to do
that's about all they have going for them
A lot of the arguments people use for roundabouts are just wrong. They're safer for drivers and make more sense on low traffic roads

They do beat out one lane traffic lights
traffic flow isn't an advantage of roundabouts
but traffic flow through a 2 lane 4 way traffic light is just higher than through a standard roundabout
It depends how busy they are
in a roundabout they're always disrupting. A left turn in jam conditions prevents three other people getting on the roundabout. A left turn at a light prevents one other person moving through the intersection
yes, they do. But left turns are moved faster and only disrupt other directions while they have the cycle
I'm talking about an idealised case where everyone exits the first time round
because the 3rd exit uses almost the entire roundabout to make the turn
So do roundabouts, it's actually worse. The 3rd exit on a roundabout is actually the thing that eventually causes them to back up
This is why giant roundabouts in the UK have traffic lights on them
Traffic lights have greater throughput. The only advantage roundabouts really have is in safety for cars specifically
I actually don't like roundabouts that much. They're the closest thing to hell ever to cycle. It's very much a piece of car infrastructure that comes at the expense of other modes.
They probably just want to keep the Americans out at this point
It's like taking the worst of both!
That's the basic take away
and it works for me
just that
huh, I just pasted the actual web link in
If it's the actual article link it should
Did you try to copy the link from discord, because if it's this it won't work
I found it fine
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
go ahead
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01441647.2021.1877207?journalCode=ttrv20
Yeah, that really shouldn't happen and it's highly irresponsible
Why is it Ohio?
most likely conditions just keep getting worse and worse until more radical approaches in some way become favourable, and at that point things are likely to really go to shit unless you get very lucky
but the odds of that happening are probably zero
The best way would be a multiyear phase in with the government buying up land close to the city to convert into public housing
The issue here is that the bubble will burst, one way or another. Most likely you have the continued decay of urban centres leading to the economic unviability of cities and mass bankruptcy of cities. This is what happens when your entire economy is a bubble and people with power resist even the moderate changes that would be required to start deflating it. It would be better to slowly increase the burden of suburbs, build out more dense housing and public transport, but the total collapse scenario looks a hell of a lot more likely.
It's one of the main reasons why suburbanisation creates such a huge issue
yes
Because the simple fact is, it would cost 10s of thousands a year just to have basic services dealt with
a fair and equitable distribution of costs would see the near immediate collapse of suburbs
and what should happen with regards to that is that suburbs should just have higher upkeep costs passed directly to residents
well yeah
The issue is that at current none of those three things are happening
Cities and surrounding suburbs account for 80% of the US's population. But ultimately I don't actually care if people in suburbs want to ruin their own health with cars, as long as ample housing within cities is provided, cars are kept out of city centres and far stricter environmental restrictions are placed on cars.
Plus I actually think the original argument was more about pedestrianisation, which is the opposite of a cat out of the bag considering pedestrian reclamation is something that's happening all across the world including in several US cities
Rail and suburbanisation are so linked as to basically be the same issue
It's just how status quo bias works. Everyone to an extent views what exists as "natural" and "unchangeable", but neither is ever actually true
Also I'll just point out that this is Amsterdam
People in the 20's would have argued that the hundred year old institution of US rail was proportionally irreversible
I think people generally like to assume that their society as it exists is exceptionally stable and the changes that happened to create it were inevitable, neither of which are true
I really disagree. It's important to point out that things weren't always as they were now and they changed rapidly without oversight. There's no reason why rapid change couldn't be forced again. Just like people before the destruction of public transport in the US were status quo biased and assumed society would continue much as it had before, people now are also status quo biased.
I imagine it'll be an actual mandate within a week or two
Only took record cases
Government's finally "recommending" masks in schools here again
The second accidental wildfire should just be considered arson
Politics is talked about a lot here, but it's not a specific politics channel. So you're always free to talk about other stuff you think fits best here.
and night trains here are woefully inadequate
and just speaking as someone who lives in a city that does run night train services, they actually drastically reduce the number of people driving. I've seen 2am trains with over 100 people on them.
I actually think it's a better solution than energy storage, at least at current. Most forms of energy storage are pretty shit realistically. It's probably better from an environmental point of view to reduce the amount of energy people are actually consuming and mass transit is just the best way to do that while also creating a consistent load
What if we just used the electricity to do something useful, like run a 24 hour train network. That's unarguably better than burning electricity for no reason.
Which allows for more public transport expenditure
And if we had fewer cars we could less roads that we needed to spend less money on maintaining
Cars and more specifically truck are the main cause of road wear
It's actually a very significant percentage of govt. expenditure
Someone has to build and maintain road networks too
and even the shittiest bus routes overcome the most efficient road systems
Public transport's main goals are energy and congestion efficiency
I don't think it's really needed to talk about roads like that, because they tend not to actually exist outside of pretty walkable places with good public transport already. The tram is a good solution for places where transit is already godawful. I don't suspect that the average European city is going to be ripping up their PT networks to replace them with ad hock tram networks. Although since London did at one point have a large tram network it still can be done
because it's definitely not supporting heavy car traffic
I mean, the road you linked is probably within a 5 minute walk from decent PT anyway, just looking at it
It's actually a one lane two way outside of that, but yes, melbourne's roads are way too big
yeah, because there's two whole unneeded lanes for parking
also just notice that the tram tracks don't actually take up a whole lane.
That's the only thing that's making this road much larger than most European roads
Yeah, but you could always hack off the parking.
Some of them aren't
even still though, that's not really the point. Most roads are quite able to support trams and you only need a grid that brings people within a useful walking distance of where they want to go
they are if you close them to cars
I'd also point this out when you say rail can't go everywhere. If you're within Melbourne's inner city the tram network literally goes within a 10 minute walk of any point. And trams are pretty cheap to build.
it's still better than them using cars
Like even shitty ridership removing people from cars
The point is that if your night service has any ridership it's actually an environmental positive
That's really not even an argument against what I just said
It only takes around 10 people on most trains for them to be strictly more energy efficient than cars even on the same energy source
*in most places running trains at night will still be energy negative just due to how absurdly inefficient a car is
If you have an automated system and your power's all generated from green sources running a 24 hour service actually isn't that expensive
24 hour train service is honestly pretty fantastic, even for people working. It allows shift workers to use public transport too.
Yeah, I get a feeling he honestly believes this, but based on my understanding of this program it's just not the sort of program that ever could produce sentience. It's just an advanced version of phone predictive text basically.
and maintenance on rolling stock is mostly done in the day
It's moreso that they tend to mostly shut down track directionally/one at a time here
yeah, Melbourne has pretty excessive tri/quad tracks on most of the line
otherwise they run every half hour still
Trains actually run all night here, there's one missed train between 4 and 5 am I think
Brave of you to assume they're enemies
Liberals helping out fascists again <:sigh:230149462880813056>
3am is the second peak with drunk people honestly
and if you really do have a mountain, that's what cable trams (like the one I linked) and funiculars are good at
It's a bit harder with freight generally, but it's also more accepted to use multiple locomotives to move freight
To be honest though Cypher, the entire "trains on hills" is nowhere near as bad as it used to be. There's plenty of train systems around now that do fairly steep grades without even diverging from standardised designs.
Like, I think this route is pretty well known for doing an absurd grade
Sanfran?
Probably some are needed, but quite a lot are pretty replaceable with freight.
Also there are ways to drastically reduce the amount of trucks needed on roads
I'm surprised they didn't skip past veterans and just let crocodiles teach honestly
It's not about separation in this case, it's more saying "you actually have a place here" to people who's countries tell them they don't at all
Like, it's still illegal for a plane to fly from the US to Havana direct. Western tourism in Cuba exists, but other Caribbean and South American is generally more of a thing
I think something important to remember here is that these hotels are mostly not targeted towards a western audience. In many of the countries in Latin America gay people are still far more repressed than in the west and those are probably more who this is directed at
They could always just bootstrap their way out of it
That's what I'm talking about, no concurrent elections
OK Nev, we had a Federal election at the start of the year, our state election is at the end of the year and our local elections will be in about a year and a half to two years
State, federal and local all happen at different times
I mean we don't have concurrent elections
fuck that shit <:LuL:789259461470322728>

Indonesian government is pretty horrific from everything I've heard about them
Most of the reason to even want better governments in the first place is the reduction of human suffering
It's kinda hard to get more extreme than literally no correlation in this regard
the US is just an extreme example
and in practice every country on earth functions more as an oligarchy than a democracy
Liberal democracy is about creating the illusion of democratic participation. There was a study in the US that showed that the desires of the people are literally uncorrelated to the outcomes of government. With the sole exception of the rich.
Probably the problem is that as a society we're still obsessed with the idea of giving extraordinary amounts of power to far too few people
Let's just leave political leadership up to a D20
Democracy is when politicians choose their voters
Always forget how insanely dense India is

China's the second largest economy and one of the fastest growing on earth. They can manufacture guns, but even if they couldn't they could easily purchase them. China isn't incompetent nor are they backwards in terms of production.
Globalisation could be a good thing, but not under capitalism
At its core globalisation is just a way to pay lower wages, union bust and move to the areas with the lowest available taxes, all of this comes at the expense of the environment with international shipping and lower emissions standards in the 3rd world generally.
~~also globalisation just kinda sucks~~
banning imports of products produced by countries where slave labour is common is an obstacle to globalisation and is completely correct and just
That's a massive claim that's just kind of wrong

It depends on how they work. Solar updraft I don't think so.
Hydro in some cases does actually get some pretty insane efficiency
But on scale you can set up shit like this to get way better than 15%
Corn biofuel is literally worse for the environment than just growing corn on the land, then cutting it down and letting it rot without using and just burning petrol instead.
and biofuels suck
As for the reason why we don't use other fuel sources however, combustion is basically just a kind of shitty way of producing an equivalent energy to electricity anyway
it's just catenaries are way better than batteries in most cases
Literally, electricity is actually the best energy source if your goal is to get something very heavy moving very fast
yes
It's completely viable
But uhhh, I'd point out that electricity is already used to drive the heaviest vehicles on earth
just get a good gear ratio
Well, yeah. You can also just connect a turbine to your wheels
Secondly fission and fusion are methods of generating electricity
Firstly, fission has been a power source in use for literally 70+ years.
Circles, that sentence makes no sense in so many ways
Electricity is just the most efficient form of power. Nothing else comes remotely close
Kat, you need to work on your ability to comprehend an argument. The argument I made is that Russia would have been fundamentally different in many ways that are unpredictable had the US have not meddled. And considering the US's role in intervening both in the USSR and post soviet Russia I stand by that.
The US fucking loves nationalists, wherever on earth and has a history of supporting them
https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/06/26/russian-election-interference-meddling/
Not like the US had anything to do with Yeltsin
are you incapable of engaging with an argument without reduction to absurdity?
When did I say that?
Arguably also in the USSR, but especially Modern Russia
Modern Russia
The US has actively interfered in Russia economically and politically as long as it's existed
that was the point
*Modern Russia has been shaped as much as any other country by US intervention
If noninterventionism were the standard policy then Russia would be a completely different country in completely unpredictable ways
which should really just be standard foreign policy
noninterventionism
What percentage of that goes towards military "interventions"
Just because they don't need mirrors it doesn't mean we can't install a bird vaporiser

yeah, it's certainly the largest issue. In spite of that they still outperform most Carrabin, South and Central American nations on most metrics

Batista most definitely did not close the gap between the poor and the rich
This is what caused (in no small part) the revolution
Na, this is before that
And I noticed this after I posted but they still have to get the US propaganda into the article somewhere <:sigh:230149462880813056>
Back in power and receiving financial, military and logistical support from the United States government,[7][8] Batista suspended the 1940 Constitution and revoked most political liberties, including the right to strike. He then aligned with the wealthiest landowners who owned the largest sugar plantations, and presided over a burgeoning economy that diminished the gap between rich and poor Cubans.[9] Eventually it reached the point where most of the sugar industry was in U.S. hands, and foreigners owned 70% of the arable land.

Legit just from wiki. This is something the US has been doing in the Caribbean and South America since at least the early 1900's.
because they still are
and honestly I don't know why I used the word were
The US relied heavily on neocolonialism and just plain colonialism to achieve their economic status. Banana republics were a thing
Almost all of Russia's actual power is concentrated west
Having a border doesn't really mean much. There's like, one significant region of power east of the Ural's and even then it's not that significant
Russia has no power in east Asia
Even China isn't really a great power in the true sense of the word
Calling modern Russia a great power is a bit of a leap
because apparently that's too extreme
After all, it was the US that veto'd the purely symbolic act of condemning Israel's colonies in the west bank
I wouldn't leave the US out of that group
I prefer imperial core, but I doubt that one's going to catch on in polite society any time soon
I think the first world is honestly better neutral terminology
Just as a side note I really hate the whole "free world" terminology. It's kinda horseshit when the US has 25% of all of the worlds prisoners. There's really nothing free about the west
Whatever small negatives may exist are not the reason why they've been made hard to get however
Like you always fucking do
That's your argument that you're making for me
I never did though
The actual divide in America has far more to do with race than regionality honestly
I think the issue I have is mostly that this is an actual idea that some Americans have, when in reality America doesn't really have that much regional diversity compared to most older countries.
What the fuck? Morrison swore himself in as health and finance minister while he was the PM without disclosing that to anyone, including the acting finance minister.
I think you're overestimating American diversity to even compare it to Europe. Remember that America stems from like, three European countries (at least the majority of the influence on the white portion of the population) and the vast majority of the influence is from the UK. It's only had 400 years to develop from there. Europe's divisions even across very small areas can be huge. There's nowhere in the US with a division like Flanders and Wallonia and those are two neighbouring areas in the same country.

This is completely insane though, it just keeps getting worse too
Taiwan and China both consider all of both of their lands to be part of China. They just disagree who the government of China is
That's an extreme false equivalence
Like, police militarization is shit, but pretty much no western country has any high ground to stand on here
Militarized police in Minneapolis?
China's diplomacy has generally been far less aggressive than the US's if you look at them fairly. I don't think China is great or anything, but they're at least not actively engaged in any wars and haven't been since the Sino-Vietnam war. IDK, I just struggle to see the equivalence personally.
It is funny how most of the things people accuse China of doing are actually just things the US does though, seemingly regardless of whether the claim against China is justified or not.
and they don't deserve any credit for it
Yeah, the issue I have with it is just that they're trying to act like they're taking a stand, but objectively they're just not
Personally I don't really believe that anywhere on earth is particularly democratic. Wealth buys power wherever you are
Only if you're indigenous
Every nation has its own propoganda
There is definitely western propoganda
And what they have done tends to be massively blown out of proportion to try to make them look just as bad as the US
The reason I bring this up is because there's a habit of disproportionate focus on US state enemies like Russia and China who do horrible things, but the reality is that the US has almost always done something worse. As I said, I just can't see China as quite as geopolitically terrible as the US. The Russian govt are a bunch of shitlords but China really haven't done anything to rise to that level.
Here's something to think about though. America has also encircled, embargoed and levied diplomatic penalties for anyone who attempts any sort of relationship with a small island nation on it's border that it actually has tried to invade. Any sort of fair analysis needs to acknowledge that there's some uncanny similarities there, except unlike China there's really no history that makes it more complex.
Like, my position on this is that a clean break and Taiwanese independence would be the best outcome, but like, it's also a complex diplomatic issue and it's not anything like colonialism
The position of the govt of Taiwan is what I said however
Western media definitely plays on the ignorance of their audience towards the politics of Japan hard
Both are actually
...it's a disproven claim
I can't speel
There's a whole life of distortions about it for sure, mostly because if all the things that were claimed about it were true they would have executed the entire male population for being forced to have KJU's hair cut
Also if you ever want to know western propoganda is a thing just look at some of the random claims about North Korea. Like I don't think it's a good place or anything, but seriously?
Honestly the biggest issue with South American democracies is US backed coups
That's a thing about the societies we've created. I don't see why it has to be
Some nations just like to drape a vernier over the top of that
The fact that paying people more makes them more productive is some old AF economic knowledge
And even still, you could be called on for war crimes

If you're going into the military you're actively signing up to assist war crimes, so like, best not ey?

I'd literally renounce my Aus citizenship and reclaim my British

From a political standpoint people would care. But like, I don't think anyone would feel particularly bad about it
Like, I actually think most people wouldn't give a fuck about Abe's assassination (other than political interest) if they knew who he was.
Honestly the Iran nuclear deal was surprisingly good, at least in the context of Iran specifically
The US was just looking for an excuse to overthrow him
that's the entire point
*there were no WMDs
This just has big "fuck around and find out" energy. The reaction of Iran, to recommence their proliferation when the US pulled out of the deal was both completely predictable and makes complete sense.
The US pulls out of the deal then starts crying when Iran doesn't hold up their end, what's new.
he's just dumb enough to not do so
He could have found someone
Because it's a waste of money, resources and manpower and also literally the plot of 1984
Personally I think we should let the military have their woke morning teas and ban them from invading countries. That's the bigger issue here
The liberals are a post satire party
Pack up and go home, the Anarchists were right I guess
I don't think I've ever heard of that happening before
The amount of harassment that Chinese people face from people who will then say something like "I don't have anything against Chinese people, just their government" is insane
Indonesia has never been remotely moderate. Just as a reminder they invaded East Timor, in the 70's with the backing of Australia but that just gets swept under the rug.

Opposition to diversity is just mainstream in most western societies honestly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTmXHvGZiSY
Why'd I think of this?
I think we're still so far off discussing that as for it to be effectively pointless. Personally though I don't really see any real difference between selling labour and sex. Both are pretty horrendous and we should be working towards a world where neither is needed, but there's really not much difference between the two as methods for survival under capitalism. The largest issue that's worth tackling right now is worker protection.
The incentive structures of capitalism make it very hard. That is effectively what a not for profit is at least in theory, but they tend to struggle a lot more than for profit corporations since they're not receiving any large investments usually.
True, it's just more notable there because of the general lack of any protections
Predatory conditions that force people into sex work are bad
Why would I care about the law if it either causes harm or ends up protecting those who cause harm? The law is not inherently good.
Quite frankly I don't care if a website that does that much harm is taken down lawfully or unlawfully
~~take facebook down with them~~
no idea
I mean, it's not here, sex work is legalised and overall sex workers have at least slightly better conditions than average
So the status quo?
What's the point?
And someone stacking boxes on shelves is more likely to get crushed at their job
Like 80% of all jobs wouldn't exist at least in a recognisable form under a non exploitative system, why focus on sex work?
I could see an argument for warehouse if what you're dealing with is essential, for example medicine being morally better, but otherwise I'd generally agree
The money is inherently a coercive incentive. If people wanted to have sex there's ways for them to do so outside of sex work. I think whether or not they want to sell it kinda misses the point here. The goal is one of two things, to perform the action you work for or obtain money. If it's the former then you don't need the money, if it's the latter then you are being coerced. This is looking more broadly at capitalism as a concept.

As I said though, the most immediate issue is worker protection since that's achievable in the short term.
and I don't think there's any good way to achieve that without legalisation
My primary concern is just worker protection
Legalised sex work helps to reduce trafficking anyway since people working in it have to be registered as actual workers
I mean, I've read what sex workers have written about the industry and that's pretty disconnected from their actual views
This is kinda like saying "people will murder so just legalise it". The point of regulation isn't to stop 100% of cases. It's to greatly reduce them and allow for recourse when they do happen
I'm not even convinced they think they can ever make a profit
This is wealthy people sinking money into a service that haemorrhages money to try to destroy the heavily unionised taxi industry and any forms of public transport that they're ideologically opposed to

Fun fact, Kerr was so hated in Australia that he had to be buried in the UK for fear that people would desecrate his grave

Also this is incorrect. At least on an official level the Queen is our head of state.
This will bolster the Republican movement in Australia. The majority here will not want Charles as head of state.

No, it fails because it's capitalism
in no small part because he was an economist
and personally at least I view Marx's critique of capitalism as his actual most important contribution anyway. He was actually far more effective at what he was advocating against than necessarily what he was advocating for
Yes, because Marx was a philosopher and an economist, not a communist
It's honestly the worst example you could bring up to someone sceptical of anarchism, because of the fact that instability is often viewed as a potential issue of anarchism and it lasted for less than three months before falling to a more organised state
Depends on how you define "look like". He certainly talked about the kinds of power structures that would need to exist within a Marxist society.
And like, I think a lot of Marxists do understand that a lot of Marx's ideas rest on a whole lot of French revolutionary thinkers and people like Adam Smith as a groundwork both in agreement too and opposition too as well as to varying degrees
I think it's because Marx very much codified most of the ideas of modern communism. You can trace back some of the ideas further than him, Babeuf comes to mind for example but Marx is the one who laid out an idea of what the society should look like and how we should get there in a way that others really hadn't before.
Communism is when the government does stuff
Na, the highest I've seen anyone actually suggest was 600km

Hyperloop isn't even theoretically faster than existing HSR anymore
We have a Tory party that merged itself the the country party that likes to come to Parliament drunk
Kinda
Greens would be fairly close to Corbyn, maybe slightly left of him
Closer to Starmer
In a way the states saved us since Labor actually does only control about 30% of the senate and is reliant on the Greens for the rest of the votes
The biggest issue in Australia is the district based electoral system creating majorities from 30% of the vote, not actually the states weirdly enough
Yes
But it also unironically manages to produce closer to proportional results than the house
No, it's 1 state 12 seats
The senate is kinda closer to proportional representation if you pretend Tasmania has the same population as New South Wales
Yes, we have a house and senate
Like, my vote ended up with Labor whether I wanted it to or not. Fuckers didn't get my senate vote though
I know it's a multiparty system though at least, so it's probably not as strict of a choice as we have
Can't say as I've ever really looked into Portugal's politics that deeply
Where are you sorry?
Better than neolibs
That would be way more based, we just have neolibs and Bandt is more of a neokeynesian socdem

That's the majority of elections
the same capitalist forces that ruined any chance of a functional social democracy in the US are ripping social democracies across Europe asunder
Look at the many European nations who didn't follow you and where they are now
Yeah, no you wouldn't have
Yes, and that group was one of Reagan's most favourable
Anderson in the far right
Carter/Reagan vote by age
In fact, Cater actually won amongst the youngest age group
That point of view is heavily challenged by reality. Reagan did by far the best amongst older voters.
In the 50's there was a form of government viewed as a viable alternative to capitalism. Communists constantly agitated the US and there was an acknowledgment that if things didn't get better for the poor people just wouldn't vote for capitalists from either party or may even revolt (especially in the 50's, less so later). It's unsurprising that as this became less and less true and as capitalist realism started to set in the capitalists looked to claw more and more back from workers.
It's really not about complacency, it's about the fact that the democratic systems of liberal states are designed to benefit the rich and control the poor.
And all this ignores completely the damage that the west does to the third world with its neoimperialist nonsense too.
Europe already has many or all of the things you're talking about and it still sees social democracy get clawed back by the rich
That's called damage control under capitalism, not actual socialism. The best you can do with reform is create a social democracy with improved workers rights with extreme difficulty. And that will be rolled back, because it always can be
It's not achievable by evolution/slow reform.
Capitalism distorts the ratios of people to socialise far more into the third group than a more cooperative system. We know this because of examples like the Paris Commune, primitive communism and the actions of people acting within Marxist states being far less self driven overall.
capitalism as a system has several inherent flaws that Marxist socialism just doesn't
Yeah, Greece is fucking wild

Unironically I think there's significantly more relevant democratic participation in Cuba than Singapore
Because it's occuring in official state enemy
I'm honestly not even surprised that US media is trying to spin a majority backed referendum in Cuba as government overreach even though it's something the US government (one branch of anyway) did without a referendum. It's sad but also utterly predictable

It wouldn't be the first time tampons were used to stop bleeding from gunshot wounds, it was quite common in WWII IIRC
Rent seeking is meant to be a pejorative, it's a word used for someone who contributes nothing but skims value. IDK how the fuck rent just became a normalised word.

also I'd disagree that she even represents a break from the past, she's literally just Italy readopting fascism
It's still an absolutely absurd quote

This is what an absolute vapid lack of any ideas does to someone
Oh god, Hillary Clinton actually praised the new leader of Italy for being a girl boss <:LuL:789259461470322728>
yeah, the actual truth here is that none of the other 4 actually care about Russia in the slightest. They're just playing their BS great power games
No council at all, all countries should have an equal vote. If we're going to weight votes by anything it should be population, not imperial power
All 5 cause issues. None of them should have vetos
Musk hasn't had unionists shot yet, that I know of at least
IDK what Russia would be asking for or if it would be reasonable, I'd lean on the side of probably not. But the point is as a leader your actual duty is to your people and sometimes taking the loss of something to reduce their suffering can be reasonable even if the other party is at fault and if you can do it I think there is an ethical argument to be made there
The answer to this is complex. No, but as the leader of a country you have basically signed up for the job of cleaning up other people's shit, sometimes that ends up being a bad thing for you. If there is an ability on the Ukrainian side to end the war then from a humanitarian perspective they probably do need to at least be open to that. Having said that this isn't passing judgement because I have no fucking clue what's going on behind closed doors and Putin is still the one at blame for all this even if Ukraine could have done something to end the war at some point.
Has anyone in here actually defended the actions of Russia?
yeah, same thing that happened in Viet/Afghan.
just by a different nation
And this is literally Vietnam or Afghanistan
That's the actual issue here
Pug, because the actual position stated was that an imperfect peace is better than a drawnout war and your instant reaction is to start talking about fascism
With the right propaganda you can convince your citizens of almost anything. Russia's just not got the same ability to utilise propaganda as the west (mostly US) and China do.
Yeah, if that's the only option then everything Ukraine has done to this point is reasonable, I just don't trust anyone when it comes to what's been said in talks. Everyone who's reported things is too interested.
Do I have to find the "global thermonuclear war isn't that bad" post
I just think if they could get something along the lines of pre war status quo plus some random face saving concession that Putin could run around with that's probably something worth taking. But if their current negotiating stance is the same as Zelensky's rhetoric (which we have no way of knowing if that's actually the case) then they're excluding themselves from that as an option. Especially if they're actually saying "Putin has to step down".
That's basically just saying you will not seek peace under any circumstance
I mean, the stance that peace can only be achieved if Ukraine gains ground and if the leader of the opposing country resigns is completely absurd
They will not likely win the war before the year is out, that's an absurd statement
and it's a strawman because **no one said it**
The one ultimately responsible is Putin, having said that the government of a country has a duty to protect the people of the country. That might mean in some cases taking less than optimal terms to end a war because war is inherently bad for the people of a country. That's the actual fucking argument
Because I said that
Hey Pug, can you argue against what's being said rather than your strawmen
No, it's not. It's an acknowledgement of the fact that prolonging war is fucking bad for everyone
That's just called racism
It's not like either of these are good options, the state of tension is still preferable to actual war
Do you want to live in an active war zone?
Western Eastern North Koreans
Just call North Koreans South Koreans and South Koreans North Koreans
Like, you can claim not to be Chinese if you want, I don't give a fuck but until your country actually does nothing's going to move <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
There's also the whole issue of the diplomatic stance of Taiwan just being really weird
There's a few issues with hating anyone based off of where they're born <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650> I assume it was a joke though I'm too tired to tell
because like, to an extent they are like that, it's more complex since China/Taiwan's relationship is weird as hell though
That honestly has a hell of a lot to do with the KMT's reduction in popularity
This is such a weird claim though. Chinese history is very widely known by Chinese people. I honestly don't even know how this one took root because it doesn't even make sense if you think about it. The CCP alludes to history all the time.
Well yeah, the Mongolian Chinese dynasty just called themselves fucking Han, IDK how you're meant to deal with that from a historical claims point <:LuL:789259461470322728>
The problem with anyone claiming Mongolian history in its entirety is that Mongolia as a nation moved a lot over time. There were times when it legit incorporated a lot of modern day China
Like, if the KMT won they'd have no reason to want Mongolia as a buffer state
I mean, during the Chinese civil war it probably wasn't completely impossible
"people already don't take our claim of all of mainland China seriously, want to throw in Mongolia and part of Siberia too"
I do find it insane that the KMT technically claims more land than the PRC though
It's not called that though
I mean, that one kinda actually exists
I think you're misunderstanding, I'm heavily antiwar, which is why I'm generally quite anti US. But it doesn't take a genius to see that gulf war/Ukraine are not equivalent.
Didn't even get the dignity of having war declared on them, just got more munitions dropped on them than Vietnam
You could always just shift to the least justifiable thing the US has ever done, Laos
IDK, just pick any other war in the Middle East honestly
It would not be my choice of US war to compare this too
Probably by how justifiable it was, and actually the First Gulf War is probably one of the less shit wars the US has been involved in
I wouldn't put money on China collapsing in the next few decades. It honestly seems more stable than the US at this point <:LuL:789259461470322728>
That's exactly the sort of authority I want discussing Chinese history
I know a Youtube dipshit said it in a video recently, but he also said that China was founded on the Yangzi river so <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
I think they know about the warlords
I mean, the CCP brings up the century of humiliation all the time
"We're one of the oldest countries on earth with an absurdly rich history, let's just hid that shit from our population rather than propagandise it"
I'll just bring up my favourite weird as fuck trope of Spain being the China of Europe, it's like arguing that the Spanish anarchists destroyed Spanish history
Like, the reality is the exact opposite, most Chinese people know way too much about their history and Westerners kinda just assume it popped into existence when the Brits sailed a gunboat in
It's just that the argument that Chinese people don't know their pre-1949 history is really fucking weird
Oh yeah, for sure. I'm not arguing against that
There's way more Chinese historians of Chinese history than Western
Where do you think most of the knowledge about China in the west comes from?
^
The burning of the Library of Alexandria did not wipe out Greek history. There are plenty of Chinese historians who very actively study the history of China and plenty of surviving texts that are still known. They're even mutually intelligible to modern Chinese language speakers
They just want to protect girls...
and that had some uhhhh, negative consequences down the line
I guess the thing that makes the Gulf War less justifiable is that peace was never actually declared
"You're supposed to get out?"
It happens sometimes
Most western countries fucking act the part
It is a bit hyperbolic but <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
I used that word for a reason. The UK and other US allies tend to have very low ability to actually set their own policy due to the current state of the world and that does often end up with nations acting against their own interests to go along with the US.
Also, China would have a pretty similar motive to avoid that, probably moreso than the US since the US at least has two effective vassals on the council
This is why road management is actually state level here BTW
yeah, that should be city/state/federal level thinking
That's kinda my point. Road infrastructure needs to be replaced quite frequently. You may as well when you're replacing it just bite the bullet, pay a bit extra and do something that's going to be long term cheaper and better than an automated bus system, which an automated tram system would certainly achieve
When you have to resurface the road like you do for most of them it is.
and also I'd raise another point, if you're already redesigning the road, and you want to remake it to be friendly to smart busses specifically, at what point do you just build a tram?
I mean, say what you want but they still haven't worked out how to get cars automated within separated tunnels. We're still a very long way away from self driving cars actually being functional
With current tech Tesla can't work out how to do it with separation, so I have my doubts
If you plan to do so with new infrastructure then just build a train line
That was the point
Self driving car infrastructure requires you to remove all other cars from whatever infrastructure they're using. That means if you plan to do so with just paint separation you need to be very active in your enforcement of your separation. If you don't you end up with a situation like painted bike lanes.
You can do it with paint and enforcement. If you just use paint people just use the lanes as they please. Trust me, I know about this, I cycle <:Amber_SaveMe:795762965835546664>
And then we can improve the efficiency by using a low friction material like steel for the wheels and road
So basically he's going to have to liquidate all his stocks <:LuL:789259461470322728>

Which would probably just kill Tesla
I hope buying Twitter kills Tesla's stock
Not treating teachers as labourers on labour day would just be moving further down that path

Probably the smart reaction would have been to step away and talk to PR about it
I don't think being asked to give a statement on an action his company took is particularly extraordinary. The issue here is that the reaction was causing as much damage as the actual action.
that is driven by capitalism
The distribution of art however
Art is one of the few areas on earth that isn't 100% driven by capitalism. That's not to say it never is, but there's a lot of artists who create art regardless of the success they expect.

The issue is that Musk's so used to operating in US states with 0 labour laws that he just assumes he can get away with his bullshit everywhere. But like, take this to China, Europe, Aus or even California and it just doesn't fly.
Plus those workers will probably run Twitter through the courts here. It's a pretty open/closed class action
Basically Twitter's operations in Australia could be closed. You can't just break labour laws like this in Australia and US companies have been booted out of the country before for doing so

Everything else has been going so well for Musk that it may as well happen
Right, my money's going on Chinese crackdown on Tesla then
Except the US actually does this shit. Not to Russia, just to pretty much everywhere in the Middle East.
Where are you getting that info from, because everything I see just says bars, schools, hotels, gyms etc
and that was in Australia, a country that's far less collectivist generally than China
They view the protestors as idiots who are looking to blow up the response
the majority don't view it as the government meddling in people's lives
I can tell you as someone who lived through similar lockdowns and protestors
These are things that westerners care about far more than Chinese people
I mean, the point is that it just won't matter to China's internal politics just like Tiananmen doesn't
Probably not as much as you think. The reality here is that it only takes a tiny fraction of all people to cause this. Even the height of all of Australia's anti lockdown BS amounted to a wet fart, why would you assume it's any different in China?
There'll be some weirdo US commentators and politicians who pick this up and run with it, but pretty much no-one outside of their sphere will care, which is literally what happened with Australia's response and Thumb Rogan
I'm pointing out that the majority won't care, certainly not enough people to start a war over it
Honestly though, the only people who'll really care about this are the same weirdos who were calling Australia a communist dictatorship when the same sorts of actions were taken to curb covid here
The bureaucracy must be expanded to deal with the weight of the expanding bureaucracy
Unironically Russia, the USSR was far better than capitalist Russia in every way
It's red scare style propaganda
Anticommunism is different to just not thinking that communism is the best way to run a country
The propaganda of the west is based on racial and economic lines. It's basically the entire mythology of liberalism combined with the idea of anticommunism and general western exceptionalism mixed with a good amount of end of history rhetoric and otherization of pretty much everywhere else. It's in national mythologies that even "left wing" parties buy into fully.
And again, South Africa was a part of the west at one point and was far less wealthy than many non-western nations
The west is typically wealthy, which is to do with exploitation, but other nations have rose to rival the west's wealth through history, notably the USSR and China
There are countries that are less wealthy within the west than countries like China
...no?
Also, no. All parties have their propaganda.
Many periphery nations are, that's not even a good point
Poland may be an exception to that
Eastern Europe is in the western periphery mostly
It's not really complex, the only actual complexity is South Africa
The west is western Europe and their settler colonies
Have they commented on it? They don't deny that there is a lockdown, but what you're saying I've never seen them talk about.
That's not even a source
Because I've only ever seen this reported by far right news sources that aren't trustworthy. I've not seen serious news sources, even with all their western bias actually support this.
yeah, pretty much
Maybe at one point, but at this point too many people in their intended audience have realised they're a bunch of weirdos who like to spend far to much time around choir boys. The fraction of people in the west duped completely by western media who view it as an unbiased source is scarily high
Western propaganda does get weaker as you leave the immediate west, but it has far more penetration into areas like South America, Africa and the Middle East where it really has no business being effective than something like Chinese. Certainly far more than North Korea, which has no effective external propaganda at all
The west also convinces much of the periphery and I'd argue have honestly been more effective at using their own tools to pacify their populations.
NK's propaganda is pretty useless compared to the west. They can only convince a decent percentage of their own citizens to believe their BS
and even then some people buy into that
The west has the single most effective propaganda machine ever constructed in human history. It's actually far worse than China's, that's why you only notice it when it oversteps like in the case of US news literally just bending down and giving billionaires blowjobs
Many sources of info owned by three billionaires who's interests all align <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
it fucking does
yes
you just become more numb to your own's
Every country is driven by propaganda
Because you can't prove something true, only false.
Why do we have any reason to believe this is false other than the general underestimation caused by undertesting which is constant?
China's response is a whole lot more responsible than the west who have just been willing to let millions die so they don't have to rework their economies honestly
straight up plain and simple
...they're fascists
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_of_Italy
Also Cypher I was talking about the fascists that won
China however actually lacks some of the reach that Europe has due to their relative recency on the scene
And yes, China does it too
which is what they should do
If they wanted to they could pull the execs up and make them face a human rights trial
and the governments of Europe give 0 fucks
Last I checked they are
So European companies aren't involved in the exploitation of African workers who are basically enslaved?
Yes, they are
They're far right
Right wing is being generous
The EU is still a neocolonial state. It's involved in the exploitation of the periphery just as much as the US is. We can do better than that.
considering Italy actually does have a fucking nazi problem
Cypher I don't think Italy's the country you want to use as an example of a functional alternative to... anything really
As opposed to now where everyone's the same and owns bombed out ruins
yes
not SSRs, not every communist state was a part of the USSR
considering balkanisation has been one of the greatest social disasters ever
If you try southern Europe you may also find that there's a hell of a lot of people who would also prefer the old communist state back too
I really don't care about what the opinions of an incredibly reactionary and nationalistic country are. I honestly don't care about the opinions of Russia that much either. It was mostly just a counter to your point that's provably wrong
Gorbachev was a twat
They're fucking horrible leaders
And it makes sense, Yeltsin bombed the house of parliament. Putin is Putin.
Russia has always regretted this
It's not really a good argument Broom
The sharp drop where a plurality still regretted the disillusion of the USSR?
I named it
No, but it does disprove this
And at no point have Russian's ever thought that the collapse of the USSR was good
Just because you include a wider group it doesn't make it not nationalism
not remotely. It quite often relies on a different kind of nationalist, EU centric rhetoric
No, it's not
And no, traditional Tory parties are for the most part not fascist
it doesn't really matter if they like, hate or tolerate the EU.
And they're fascists because they generally use race and nationalism as their main policy
Basically Liberal and Tory parties are slowly dying and generally giving way to more far right fascists and new wave socialists, although not at equal rates
That's what's actually happening right now. That's what the death of the "red and blue" (as I'd call it the liberal consensus) actually means. It's actually more accurate to use a term like fascist right now than it has been since the 40's.
The political divide is widening due to worsening conditions. The liberal consensus is dying and a tripolar form of politics with socialists liberals (including conservatives) and fascists is forming. The unfortunate reality is that right now fascists are sapping strength from the liberals at a faster rate overall than socialists are.
honestly
They're just both
but w/e
I'd still argue they aren't
Isn't it easier just to call them fascists, accept that they have a foothold in Europe and are supposedly antithetical to your European project?
Why are you sitting here and defending the AFD, a party that pretty much stands against everything you claim to want to support?
They're very close politically
which they just are
I'm calling the AFD fascists
They're conservatives, which means they enable fascists rather than actually being them
They're not
I'm not calling the CDU fascists
Or fecking Lepen
Just to name one
What is the AFD?
Yes?
It's actually the downside of the otherwise good voting system
After the US where one of the major parties has been co-opted by fascists and a few outlier countries like Argentina and Brazil the EU is the largest hotbed for fascist parties. Regardless of if they're a party like the AFD with no effective control, they're still larger than the pathetic parties that exist in countries like Australia, Canada or most of Africa.
that's complete horseshit
and then it knifed many of them
The Nazi party in Germany also took in disaffected socialists
Why is this a point?
and also have way too much broad support
it just means that they're too powerful and still gaining power
Yes, a problem doesn't inherently mean that they currently lead alone
secondly it also just depends on where you draw your race boundaries. If you just include other Europeans (at least for now) you can very easily still be a fascist by opposing groups like Asians, Middle Easterners and Africans
no, firstly European nationalism is a thing
They're not even one of them, the main fasc party is anti Europe
No, there's plenty of pro Europe fascist parties.
This is just the final stage of capitalism. Where the capitalists can no longer convince the average person to go against their class interests so they set up the handball to fascists, because they pose less threat than the socialists and even the reformers.
They have ties with known neonazi groups
Or you can become president as long as you call yourself a dogwhistle rather than a fascist
And I'd say this more about Italy than any other country in Europe
Italy's in love with one specific political idea and has been for a longass time
what a garbage way to put that
fuck off
also "good countries"
very smart
yes, compare the colonised to the coloniser
*there's also plenty of stats to back up both of those statements
Honestly, when you compare most modern day socialist countries to countries of comparable wealth they're really not that bad. I think part of the problem is that there's never been a socialist nation that didn't start out dirt poor and people love to compare them to the US for some reason. You know, Vietnam is generally a better country to live in than Honduras in spite of the enforced liberalisation that's actually really fucked with them. And Cuba is better than Mexico I'd argue, in spite of being forced into isolated siege socialism.
Like, no, China won't collapse, Russia won't collapse, the US won't and your random party probably won't either. Unless there's an external actor things tend to die slowly.
good rule of thumb
If someone's saying that a political entity will collapse it probably won't
I just don't think it's likely to happen
Have I said anything here that makes you think I like the PiS? Them collapsing and giving the country over to wank ass libs would still be a good thing
yeah, no shit
I don't think the PiS is likely to collapse any time soon though if I'm honest. Part of the reason why they're fine with such extreme extraction is that they're actually benefited by crises.
It's when everyone else does
That's not when they collapse
When they start stabbing eachother you should really be scared
and those concessions don't have to be worth what is otherwise being lost
What they do however, which is actually in line with PiS is that they give concessions to the in group at the expense of the outgroup
If a nationalist (politician) cared about improving their country then they wouldn't back far right causes more interested in the extraction of wealth.
That's their rhetoric
What the fuck about nationalist Spain was "great"
Nationalists generally don't care about making their country "great"
Like, the Nazi party was famously corrupt even during WWII. Franco was basically just a money laundering scheme the entire time he was in office
You say that like one of the biggest draws of old fascist parties wasn't corruption before they got the power they needed to actually implement their goals
Why are you so obsessed with the EU? I literally don't care. I care about the fact that parties, that are, and I quote "patriotic nationalists who value cultural conservatism and monoculturalism", which is a pretty good definition for early stage fascist parties won in Italy and Poland. That's actually the point. As Phoebe said the bigger thing about the EU is that it's not really for or against fascism, it just tolerates it at current.
Which is literally what fascism is
It's a particularly extreme brand of social conservatism
This is literally just the same shit that the Nazi's did though
National conservative is basically just the politically correct way to say neonazi though
Even Wiki which is very reluctant to call this shit out calls them this
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_conservatism
They're a national conservative party
that they can become politically dominant and start shaping the landscape
Just enough
It doesn't have to even be 50%
It doesn't have to be 100%
Firstly, enough people in Poland support the PiS to make the statement that Poland has a nationalist streak true
That's not the knockout argument you think it is
Which also goes to show, many nationalists have weird fucking opinions.
Poland also has one hell of a nationalist streak though
It really depends on the situation
And Anti EU nationalists both tolerate and do not
Pro EU and Anti EU
There's two forms of nationalism in the EU
How on gods green earth can you possibly say that as a Pole?
...what?
when it benefits them
Yep, it's the only time when colonists have ever built infrastructure for anything other than extraction though
which is probably why he didn't
Shame, he's literally the best person to ever run for president
no
<:Kanba7:309618672895262721>
He was locked up in the first red scare, then he just chad AF ran from his cell
Things that happened in US history
He was much less of a dick though
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_V._Debs
I mean, Debs ran from jail
I think the idea however was that unions would work cooperatively to run the economy
No, they never really got there.
that actually became quite popular in western countries and I'd argue were probably closer to what Marx thought would happen than the actual socialist movements that took power
The syndicalists are an interesting alternative
as if Cuba's whole history didn't, but <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
yeah, it really puts to bed the instability argument
It doesn't even matter if you like these states or not, objectively they have not slowed development
And like, China, another socialist state has done a very similar thing with a centralised economy.
It didn't though. Objectively it just did not and that should be obvious. The states of the USSR went from backwards ass potato farming tsardoms to space faring superpowers that actually grew to be the second largest economy on earth. How did they slow development? How is that even an argument?
I don't know of any other coloniser that legit tried to make things better
That's called a settler colony and raises a whole host of other issues
We're also not unaware that Poland actually benefited far more from neoliberalism's introduction than all the other states, which got dicked
Is this even controversial?
Don't even Libs call shock therapy a failure now?
Unless you have a weird AF definition
I'm pretty sure that the soviets were
What happened to cause the immediate drop in GDP in 1991?
What happened in 1991 that caused this drop in lifespan in both Russia and Ukraine?
6 months and no-one cared
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_bank_strikes_(1966%E2%80%931976)
This was the one time they went on strike
I think bankers are worthless, yes
So accountants and bankers?
If they seem like absolute shitholes compared to Cuba and Vietnam, that's the point
to the socialist states I listed
The reason why I chose those two countries is that they're the closest in GDP/capita wealth
I get that basic materialism is hard here, but if you just look at stats socialist countries outperform capitalist countries of similar wealth
Because I can
Do I need to get out the charts that show the immediate drop in wealth across almost every eastern European country?
It's just a fact that every nation on earth that was an extractivist colony regardless of whether they are now socialist or capitalist is poorer than the nations that were colonising them.
Can you look at the wealth that Cuba had at any point in history and say that socialism is the problem rather than, you know, colonialism
Because I frankly find the statement quite offensive
All of America's infrastructure in Afghanistan was built to aid the military invasion.
No
If he actually goes through with booting 75% of the workforce it is
RIP Twitter, you were always sort of shit if I'm honest.
In most cases I'd agree, but considering we're talking about tech guys working for Twitter they'd be absolutely fine
The fact that anyone agreed to keep working is amazing to me
I think he's just so far up his own arse that he thinks that this will end up working out for the best
I think he's just this stupid

This but also disarm the police and heavily restrict guns even in the latter two cases.
It's better for no-one to be armed ultimately
Honestly though, kinda do
Well, until a system breaks. That's the issue here. It's probably on borrowed time RN because when something does break there's no one to fix it.
But like, I'm also from a country way closer to this than the US. Like, the biggest issue here is US gum culture in general.
Why does FIFA feels a need to always say the dumbest shit possible?
The entire goal of the propagandists around climate change has been to individualise collective problems using ideas like the carbon footprint and recycling and to collectivise individual problems, convincing people that it's their fault and not the rich's.
You really don't need to convince everybody. You need to bring justice to the few rich fuckknuckles who are responsible for the vast majority of this.
<:ChrisYikes:679341065878241292>
don't give it more credit than it deserves
Capitalism is a 200 year old wankstain
The divine right of kings is unquestionable
There is no ethical consumption under capitalism
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_bank_strikes_(1966%E2%80%931976)
and the owners of oil companies should be fed to fucking piranhas
All companies should be owned by workers and wealth should be taxed at such a high rate that becoming rich is impossible
No, we don't
Because they need food
I'm sorry but that's a garbage take
...workers are not responsible for the crimes of their bosses
As I said, forcing the top 10% to live within their means (and honestly, this probably does include many people on this server, I believe myself included) would buy decades, that's the point. In those decades we could actually begin to do something about the rest of the problem.
We could also talk about the giant issues that stem from consumerism, a culture explicitly driven by advertising to benefit the wealthy which is one of the single largest drivers of climate change
Because they're exploiters who are destroying the planet?
and a giant issue
That's fucking huge
The 1% group makes up 15% of all emissions
...what?
If the top 10% had the same output that would buy us decades
...the lowest average lifespan ever was in the early industrial revolution
even still a Roman citizen and a southern African tribes person actually had similar average lifespans
Rome had sanitation, that's a major reason why
There was a point in the industrial revolution when they were decades shorter
I mean, average life span in cities only overtook average tribal lifespans with the advent of modern medicine
...most tribes didn't even have leaders Cypher. They may have had respected elders, but ultimately it's just their prestige that earns them respect and influence rather than them having actual hard power to enforce their will like in capitalist societies. They couldn't just deny food.
Of course tribes had hierarachies. They didn't have exploitation. That's the point. Children still had less power than adults as an example. This is a justified hierachy
There's nothing inherently wrong with hierarchies, there's an issue with exploitation
This, there are non exploitive hierarchies. A family is a hierachy that is completely uninteresting and not opposed by anyone reasonable, at least if you assume gender equality.
This is why any arguments about the need for exploitation are dumb. It didn't exist for the majority of human history and basically couldn't exist until the advent of agriculture.

Other than primitive communism, which was the state of existance that lasted the longest in human history.
Humanity has existed under many different economic systems and the system can change again
The state literally killed their political enemies. And you're justifying that
Look at what happened in capitalist countries. The same thing.
Never forget that the US also purged its political enemies, several communists were sentanced to death for their views in the first red scare. That one just doesn't get talked about. Several more were arrested and allowed to die during the second red scare.
We've been trying reformism for a century and got nowhere. The world has gotten worse in the last century, not better. Liberal reforms have only bought about crap change and reaction. Wanting to stick with that makes fuckall sense
That's why it was so low
Age of being shoved in a factory and forced to work till you die
This was the low point for humanity
I've always wanted to have to pay to take a shit
That's literally what socialists do
It's not enough though. That's why ultimately we do need to overcome the system. We can't keep allowing rampant poverty and environmental destruction regardless of what social changes we achieve.
we will never get meaningful environmental or economic change.
We can make meaningful change that doesn't go against the capitalists, such as meaningful social change
those two statements aren't contradictory
No, read that again
You can't make any meaningful change under capitalism if your change goes against the capitalists
Yeah, probably
although the reality is that a worker soviet is basically just a union of unions anyway
*worker soviet
but also the odds of being able to build an actual peaceful revolutionary movement without those with power cracking down on you are basically zero. At some point you get big enough and have to fight back
Notably changes to mitigate climate change will never be passed
but it still should be used
voting is a weak tool
You should use every tool you have avalible
Did anyone here advocate for voting Tories?
Actually, fighting for greater equality within capitalism is immensely useful. Firstly it does just improve lives, which is important. But secondly it actually helps in the building of class solidarity.
I don't think anyone said that. What we're saying is that actual justice requires change beyond that which reform can accomplish.
Are you deaf?
no?
Anyway, according to the CIA there wasn't really a large difference between caloric intake of Americans and Soviets during normal times
https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP85M00363R000601440024-5.pdf
The English crimes against the Irish and Indians are as grave as any during communism, yes
it's a disarming point to any capitalist claim to be better
It's not justification for bloodspill. We can and should do better than both
What the fuck?
Yes, Amazon is both a monopoly and a monopsony at this point
Cost cutting in production isn't really about selling more, it's about increasing revenue. It does have the added advantage of crappy products that break being favoured by capitalism though.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect
exceptionally well
yes, it works
If it didn't then corps wouldn't expend such a huge amount on it
The problem with assuming competition ever makes things better is that you're assuming that the best way to sell products is actually to improve quality or reduce price. The reality is that the best way to sell products is actually just to advertise more, which you can see reflected quite clearly all around you. That's a good reason why competition doesn't actually work the way it's claimed to in theory before you even start talking about elastic vs inelastic goods
Competition doesn't always, or even often I'd argue make things better
What a great idea
That was the joke
Honestly though, there's actually quite a few cities in New England where you really don't need a car, it's more than just NYC and Boston
There's quite a few places in America's best state where you can get away with a bike, like Montreal and Toronto
it's not 100% though
Even my shitty seat filled with temporarily embarrassed millionaires seems to have held for Labor
The current state of Vic politics <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
The Greens here aren't bad, but if the Socialists start to gain popularity that's a good thing
They're the best party running
Yes, the Socialists are pretty cool
Some of these swings are wacky
Pretty much as well as it could have went
Vic Socialists are actually picking up a good percent in inner city seats too
Anyway, Vic election seems to have went well. Labor's maintained government, only looks like they've lost one seat to the Libs but they've lost like 3-4 to the Greens
If you've ever got an hour watch this, the Greeks got absolutely fucked by the Germans and French because those to nations chose to protect their own corrupt bankers over the Greeks

Jesus
I'm not pro Brexit, but I am pro Grexit. The EU has ruined Greece and the best thing they could do would be to leave. I think this is the stance that makes the most sense at least to me. Once the nations that are being most exploited by the EU leave or make their own defensive economic pacts, depending on if they're internal like Greece or external like most African countries I think the EU would fail.
OK, this seat is pretty wild
Amazing

And the Tories are already at each others throats
I don't think there's a pathway to leadership in Aus that doesn't involve electoral participation either
And they did well enough to actually get media mentions
True, but it's also the only way to build support in Aus
They're Trots, but like, they're honestly doing OK right now. They got up 10% of the vote in Footscray and they got a 1.5% net swing towards them this election.
I can't describe how much I hate that stupid fucking word. They're just socialists. Both Maoism and Trotskyism are legitimate ideologies that can be held in good faith.
I can't remember if they were Maoists or Trots, but they're actual socialists
It wouldn't be that surprising to see a republic
which isn't true for the Libs
Yes, but the Labor party are also explicitly republican
He is also a long term republican though
Listening to the broadcasters troll the boomer Lib they have on and wrap his brain in knots is hilarious
The crown still being the head of state in Aus is dumb AF
Big same, always been a republican
and specifically trans women, I don't think I've ever seen a terf actually acknowledge the existence of trans men
~~that's the point~~
To the extent that they'll undo victories of feminism to harm trans people
The type of feminists who want to check young girls private parts before they play sports. Seems feminist to me <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
Depends on the country
By nationalising the power grid. You (government) legit just say "ours now, don't like it, to bad". Or if you're more of a boring neolib you do a token buyout
The extreme reaction is to nationalise the power grid
What are you talking about?
...freezing the prices is a centrist as hell reaction
At least in principle
This is just the point to Broom. You can't just take the actions where you agree with an extreme and seperate them off as not extreme. Most of humanity are climate change radicals.
Extreme change is an extreme action regardless of if it's needed or not. In fact most extreme change that happens only happens because people think it's needed.
Yes, that's called reaction and it's really quite well known. Liberals eventually got their ideology through despite monarchist reaction
Extreme action is undertaken by extreme ideologues. Ideology and action can't be seperated that easily. All political action is the result of ideology.
Yeah, the point is that if the system isn't stable and collapses kinda by definition an ideology that's currently extreme takes over
Also  I don't believe that the current system is particularly stable
I mean, evil doesn't exist, that's why I quote marked that.
I still even think that is a reductive statement. Extremes are just when you want to change what currently exists. Whether or not they're "evil" depends entirely on how justified the current status quo is
We shouldn't fall into the trap of always assuming the simplest and easiest thing to believe is correct. It often isn't.
Also Mel is right here, intuitive ideas can often be wrong. The intuitive conception of physics is wrong and quantum mechanics is a better way to explain physics in general.
No. Extremes can make sense and there's plenty of policies where moderate stances suck way more than one of the extremes. A lack of extreme action on climate change for example is just a slightly less bad version of the extreme of doing nothing. A very easy issue where the only option is one of the extremes.
Also because red scare ideology is also very useful against socdems who are a more meaningful movement
And as you said, people can adopt a more extreme ideology.
Because socialism the ideology is a threat. If it becomes a meaningful movement.
Saying "socialism doesn't meaningfully exist" is a way of differentiating that socialism does, in fact exist, there are socialists in the US and they just don't really matter in the grand scheme.
What do you think meaningful existence means? It means some degree of relevance.
Like, when I say "socialism doesn't actually exist in the US" that isn't accusing you of thinking it does or does not. It's just pointing out that the ideology is completely powerless in the US and at best there are a few scattered socialists.
No, I'm not. I'm just stating what I believe to be the facts here Aria. I think you're reading more into what I'm saying here than the other way around.
Like, I get that but I also do think that precision here is quite important.
But socialism as a movement not really
Like it exists but saying all three exist in the US is not really true. There are socialists in the US
The US does not have a viable socialist movement
There's other narrow ideologies like nationalism for example
*broad ideologies
The ideologies that arise in the future would still be fundamentally based on modern Liberalism, Socialism and Fascism which are the only three viable ideologies that really exist in the modern day. I don't think that other situations could really happen unless you actually lost knowledge.
It involves vaults
You can only base predictions off of evidence. I see no reason why you would bet on complete societal collapse or even why a complete societal collapse would require us to rebuild an intangible, knowledge from scratch.
It's just that in our modern language we refer to people groups and states as the same. The Roman state collapsed. The Roman people mostly just kept on doing what they had done as a normal society under new leadership.
Society is mostly contiguous. Entire societies don't really collapse. It's just not a common thing throughout history. What collapses are the political structures. For the average person the effects of that often aren't felt for years. I don't think that a full societal breakdown is likely.
Here, no
He created a rumour for clout
Yes, that can still theoretically be simulated in binary. It just needs staggering computation power. If you had 32 bits representing a single synapse then it could fire at 2,147,483,647 different levels, which would probably be enough detail to simulate a neuron in theory.
The brain doesn't have a set base either
I mean, that's true. At some point humans just become a network of neuronal connections that works on mathematics as well. I really don't hate the "brain is just fancy computer" argument. I feel like it's pretty descriptive.
Computers are big fancy maths machines at their core, that's kinda the only thing they can do
...I feel like you've had this explained to you before but they don't trace. They break images down into a set of numbers, they learn the things that link those numbers together, create an algorithm that describes them and use that algorithm to create a new number which is then converted back into a picture.
And also, we wouldn't consider a number calculated by a computer and a number calculated by a person to be sufficiently different regardless of how they come up with it
The point also wasn't that they have to be exactly the same. It's that it's very hard to make a materialist argument for significant difference
As do AIs
I am very reductive of the human experience.
They're just a different set of rules
You follow a set of rules in your own head too
Why is the process of following an algorithm to draw inherently different to learning how to draw as a human?
IDK about that personally. I think this isn't clean cut, if there are differences they're fairly ill defined. I also struggle to see a clear difference between an inspiration and a random seed. The issue to me is that both the process of algorithmic and human learning are quite poorly understood and making large claims about them is always pretty iffy.
...capitalists do not work hard to earn something
Because I don't want to get the fucking cowboys with overinflated egos involved for a petty crime that doesn't hurt anyone
That's just the worst choice
If I see shoplifting I'm 100% not calling the police
Most US shops do the exact same thing
In Aus it's actually illegal for a corp to tell their employees to stop shoplifters
That doesn't happen Cypher. Shops literally tell their employees to allow shoplifting to occur
I don't even really consider shoplifting to be bad. I kinda just view it as morally neutral in most cases honestly.
Yes, but the two people I'm talking to about that live in the US, so...
I think the word "net" is very important here. It's not necessarily a universal good, but it is a net good. The outcomes are better than had the shoplifting not have happened.
The transfer of food to people who need it from corporations who don't is a net good
Zuck doesn't have a brain
That's a damn lie and you know it
It'll probably be a long time before even simple mammalian brains can be done though
just not human
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_i1NKPzbjM
Also brain simulation
Yeah, it's very annoying how people look at capitalist hierarchies as some sort of force of nature and not a system being carried out by actors.
I just posted it in response to the response Matt, when I read that I just assume the meaning behind the statement since I do know it and it doesn't really stand out to me
That's literally why I posted that
Like, this is just one of those cases where private property in socialist theory means something else than in capitalist theory, so the phrase "abolish private property" has a different meaning. It's pretty much just a rephrasing of "seize the means of production"
I mean, we should also define terms. Because to socialists private property refers to things that are used in industry while personal property refers to things that are actually owned by the individual. So a TV in a shop would be private property while a TV in your house would be personal property as would a TV in Bill Gate's house. So abolishing private property would actually only apply to the shop in this case and neither you nor Gates.
well, actually the primary targets of theft are workers having their bosses steal their wages, but like
I literally do not care how much people take from them
Yes, but I'm assuming we're talking about the primary targets of theft, which are chains owned explicitly by capitalists
It's literally what the word capital means
they make money by owning things
good choice
"we just want to protect the children"
Shouldn't be surprising. Things are getting worse and those actually making things worse are trying to ensure that blame gets shifted away from themselves and onto a scapegoat. Why bother coming up with a new one rather than using tried and tested?
And Cuba, a country very unaligned with the US is just doing the exact same shit it's been doing for the past few decades
No fucking idea, I honestly don't know that much about the specific circumstances around this in Ireland. I just know how the UK acts.
IDK, depends how long it takes people to actually fight rather than clinging to what remains of the Good Friday Agreement
It'll happen when meddling in Ireland's affairs becomes more of a cost than it is profitable, just like in every other colony that broke away from the empire
And if there is a referendum they'll try to strike it down as illegal
They're a colonising force
England will never consent to a referendum unless they'd be a revolution without one
Thats a nonsense position
Like, you really can't try to anex yourself and change a nations laws to be more like yours
Yes, because NI would be trying to anex itself, which is literally the single weakest negotiating position possible. If it causes any sort of trouble for the republic they really don't have a reason not to just walk away.
It just also says they won't make concessions for it, which is understandable.
The article you linked shows over 70% support for it
The Republic does want unificiation
It means that it doesn't really impact them so the ones who need to decide to commit to the agreement are NI, not the Republic
That doesn't mean that they don't support unification
Unification is ultimately mostly a NI issue
I mean, most people in the Republic in principle support unification, but I highly doubt they care enough to actually make large changes for it
I don't think I've ever heard of a nation making concessions to a territory that actively decided to anex themselves, which is the only way anything's going to change here
Not making concessions to NI is exactly what I'd expect honestly

Mate, the only reason anyone works is for money. Work fucking sucks, at least as it exists now. Acting like workers should work for your or societies convenience is insane. They work for money. If they're getting shortchanged then they will strike rather than work. It's actually quite simple.
This has a lot to do with the way how boys are socialised

Yes, women are statistically safer drivers than males

<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
That's actual statistics
50/50 is an approximation and always has been. If you have thousands of workers in most industries you just will reach something close to it.
If you have a large workforce you just get to 50/50 over time without even fucking trying if you don't discriminate. Considering how new Twitter is this shouldn't have been an issue and based on the fact that Twitter wasn't accumulating gender discrimination suits before Apartheid Clyde took charge I'ma bet that it wasn't.
Like, it's actually so closely related as a lawsuit that they can sue under the exact same bill
because it's also illegal to GIVE the positions based on sex. So if more women were in low ranking positions that's also a huge issue
again, positions don't matter
because just releasing your evidence beyond what you need to into the open is really bad strategy
The hint here is that the case probably wouldn't be pressed until after they've done that analysis, but it also won't become public until after the court case
I also fully believe this was intentional because known supporter of apartheid Elon Musk is just as sexist as he is racist.
Also the positions shouldn't really matter, because at best that just shifts where the gender discrimination occured
It depends on how large the numbers are, if they're large enough to be statistically significant then it's actually a pretty one and done case
in the US at least
1964
There have even been nation states that were more equal
there have been historical nations with far greater degrees of equality between the sexes than the modern world
Equality is very possible
No...
It doesn't depend on where you are. There is no society on earth that has achieve actual gender equality. Some are just closer or further away from it
There isn't a both ways here
And many people's viewpoints reflect that
The way modern society treats men and women is not remotely comparable. Men get far better societal treatment in general.
...how exactly can it be said both ways?
a lot of men and society in general still to this day do not treat women as equals and humans
Honestly, no
Now they just support sexist regimes, far better <:ababa:789441747678920735>
Testosterone has a lot less to do with this than societal pressures and expectations on boys and men. People always try to bring this back to biological factors, but the reality is that there's thousands of years of entangled societal pressures that have a basis in biology but have long since moved passed that
It's kinda like that but the reality is that the person you're trading with doesn't even want what you're trying to give them
I'd point out that the Weimar Republic was an incrementalist liberal state
There's huge risks to incremental liberalism too
If you're in a disadvantaged group the world looks very different
It's very easy to say to avoid giant changes if you're societally advantaged
Broom what the hell are you even trying to argue here. Because it feels like you're contradicting yourself if I'm honest
Fascism is the fallback mechanism for liberalism. This is literally how the system is meant to work.
The system isn't flawed. It works as intended
I'm not even messing around with terms here, this is literally the system the ancient Greeks described as oligarchy
This is oligarchy
The west never has
We don't have democracy
Democracy is fine. The issue is that what we actually have is oligarchy
I think the systems that exist are insufficient for humans needs
regardless of anything else
You have faith in human systems
Why not. If the systems that exist are insufficient and designed not to change then what choice is there?
Everything has consequences including the choice to maintain the status quo. The thing is the consequences for that are both horrific and predictable
The point is I argue against liberal democracy and in favour of worker democracy, which is actually a form of democracy
it's oligarchy
no, but liberal democracy is not actually democracy
I mean, you're misunderstanding the goals of the system if you think self preservation is in any way a goal of liberal democracy. Liberal democracy is just a way of selling oligarchic leaders to people and making them feel attached to them. It's literally a system drafted by rich white slave owners, they don't give a fuck about any of the things you care about. The system is meant to hand power to the wealthy and make change incredibly hard. If it can no longer self sustain it's designed to handball power over to someone who won't threaten the rich like a liberal oligarch or fascist rather than a socialist.
And execs got fucking rich

Privatisation occurred federally in 2007
One near and dear to me

I can link specifics if more needs to be said
Every movement towards privatisation ever
IDK, every time I see any movement to decentralise anything, be it economic or social it always just ends up benefitting the rich more. Like, there's a reason they fight so hard against nationalisation.
DW, I'm not accusing you of being a complete moron <:LuL:789259461470322728>
IK, but I think any sort of decentralisation will be coopted in that direction
It's our centralised systems like welfare and healthcare that mitigate the capitalist hellscape, and centralised government is also the only think holding back decentralised ~~slave owners~~ businesses.
I do not believe that a decentralised society can provide for the needs of anyone but the wealthiest
Yes, but it's a good reason why decentralisation really isn't ideal
No, not really. The historical largest issue with command economies was just computing power and the lack of ability to create predictive models.
I'd actually argue the exact opposite. The decentralised system opens up far too many opportunities for dishonest actors to steal at every step. Computing power doesn't fix that. Decentralisation is just inherently inefficient. Increased computing power makes an increasingly centralised command economy far more efficient however.
It was a monarchy for a while
Yugoslavia existed before WWII
Like, China's semicentralised economy hasn't had worse shortages in the current crisis than any western nation
Firstly, decentralised economies also suck at this.
Secondly, That's why predictive models are so useful. They allow both kinds of economy to actually, like, function at a level where there shouldn't be random mass shortages
DW, I learned nothing about Yugoslavia from school either
It wasn't
correct
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
You don't know anything about it at all
Having said that it was still better than Balkanisation
Yugoslavia
I think that centralised command economies are actually just preferable
I really don't agree with that
If the USSR had predictive models like we have today it would have been a giant advantage to them
What I'd argue for is probably economic and social centralisation but more decentralisation of government. The main reason I pointed this out is because it's quite clear that computation was the biggest thorn in the side of command economies specifically
Mum said it's my turn to own the slaves
in general
It's just when you delegate to more people

I'd still argue that a true command economy is preferable to the ...thing that China has
Like, Aus can't even stop idiots from buying 500 packs of toilet paper <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
It's not the best example. But it's more centralised than the west and hasn't underperformed them.

Most Australian's aren't aware of the difference between Chinese people and other east Asians. There have been stories of Koreans and Japanese people being abused for being Chinese too
Yeah, and in Aus there's an undercurrent of people who want to to the same and societal hatred of Chinese people is pretty much a mainstream opinion
like, it's really fucking bad in Australia
I can tell you that in the Asia pacific region Chinese get very similar levels of hate, there are political parties that exist on the basis of their removal and they're the main target of racist hate crimes

Na, not inflammatory enough
They'll just chestbeat and use whatever they do to make themselves look good
You don't need to have a direct rail attachment to factories. There are countries that do (notably Switzerland) and it is better, but it's not strictly speaking needed. What you need is just a rail connection to a distribution centre then you use trucks from there. It's still way more efficient than trying to BS your trucks into a fraction of the efficiency of a freight train.
In most of the long distance cases this isn't the issue you're making it out to be. Most highways mostly run through very sparse areas
Yes, but the point is that you are building infrastructure either way
It's not existing infrastructure if you already need to build catenaries though, which are not simple to build anyway, they're actually generally the harder part of building an electric railway. Not to mention the increased complexity of building catenaries for trucks. It just feels to me like a half assed solution overall. You'd 100% just be better off going the full distance and building rail if you're building infrastructure anyway.
If you're building dedicated catenary wires for trucks that already run a fixed route you may as well just bite the bullet and build a full cargo train route.
State ID should just be free though. It is across most of Europe and it does not create large issues.
Even a relatively cheap, easy to obtain ID designed to be a first ID that isn't free is actually a huge improvement
Which makes finding work hard, which makes obtaining the resources required to gain a prohibitively challenging to obtain ID (usually a drivers licence) harder. Unlike the hypothetical you talked about this actually happens. A lot. It happened to me. It's happened to several people I know.
And the actual bigger issue here which is a real issue faced by many people, especially those who are poor is the shear impossibility to obtain a first source of ID
nor the lack of a random ID without context either
No, but nor would a random ID without context
They should probably be more worried about the census
Ah yes, the least bad Tory
I'm saying that's what they should do if they win
It's so fucking weird that drivers licences serve as primary ID anyway
The actual way to disarm this for Labour would be to guarantee state ID to everyone over 18.
Yeah, the US railway is still fairly good, it's just the fact that it's almost all single track and almost not electrified at all that are the issues

Ireland has backed some of America's nonsense, they are slightly more selective generally than a lot of western countries though
The west acts as a block. If America is doing one thing then agencies in most western countries (plus Japan and Korea) probably have their backs

Pay information is useful for building working class solidarity.
You know we could anonymise things that would greatly help workers right? As an example work history. I'd be in favour of more privacy here because it benifits most people.
Were arguing as to why it shouldn't be, the fact it is holds no bearing
Can you stop just saying it's private? We understand that
It's his choice because society has been crafted to benefit the bourgeoisie
It only serves to advantage the worker and not them
Why would a bourgeoisie boss tell their worker what they're getting paid.
There's very good reasons why this should be public
The other is when everyone of a certain race or sex is mysteriously getting paid less
Because that right there is one of the two reasons why knowing salaries creates issues for capital
Ignoring coworkers for a second here, why shouldn't it be my right to know how much money my boss makes?
I don't think the obscuring of wage is unnecessary. I think it's actively detrimental
I think the public school system is the only place in Aus where that's true
It creates no issues
I can already literally look up my coworkers wages
You understand this is only a saying because it's been popularised by capital to aid them in underpaying workers right? When workers talk about their salaries they unionise.

Some idealism is actually needed to improve anything at all
Being exceptionally pessimistic and doubtful of any improvement isn't the sign of maturity you think it is Broom.
You can't just say it's useful in the case you agree with when there's clear benifits to the case where you don't. You need some actual counter argument against it. Some negative this would create for society. Like no shit car licence plates being public info is good. It holds drivers to account. Public wages hold employers to account. Both are good.
Pretty sure Attlee is turning in his grave
And since the right will always win elections having a slightly less insane right wing is actually really important
The thing about this is that the Taiwanese right is actually off their head insane. Japan's right is actually rather moderate compared to... anywhere else in Asia honestly. The LDP are shit, but they're more like CDU levels of shit rather than a party like the KMT, who are pretty much the worst guys imaginable.
As long as the KMT never wins office again anyway <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Due to the exact circumstances around Japan's exit from WWII and the end of their war with the USSR (which weren't the same thing) they actually had less overall US interference in their early governments, which lead to both liberals leading the country rather than US backed fascists and a surprisingly large and unsuppressed communist movement.
In most Asian countries the biggest issue is that the US supported just the worst possible government to supress communism, which was generally rather popular in mid century Asia due to the influence of China and the USSR in the region, so you ended up with nations like Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand just being led by truly horrible people
I actually love the idea of siestas
Reminder that South Korea was originally a fascist reaction to communism and they haven't moved that far since.
Trust me, a hot war between nuclear armed powers does not benefit anyone.
Like, I also think Vladimir Putin is a fascist but understand all the reasons why a war with Russia would be the worst possible thing imaginable right now
I'd broadly agree, but there's still more nuance to this then you let on. I think fighting suicidal fights is always just dumb. It doesn't matter whether they're against a fascist or not. I'm also not an interventionist. I don't think that just jumping straight to a military solution is good, in fact, it's almost always a terrible idea. You should realistically try other non-military means to supress fascists before military ones. And if Chamberlain had been less useless this is actually the path he would have followed.
Chamberlain was a committed liberal conservative. He's actually overall less close to Fascism ideologically than someone like Boris Johnson honestly
It's to do with what you believe and how that impacts the choices you make
Fascism is an ideology, not an action
...no?
Chamberlain was not remotely a fascist. He didn't even hold particularly nationalistic views, he's just a feckless liberal.
and no, that doesn't mean he was as bad as Hitler
And also, ideological similarities=/= the exact same. I know there were fucking differences, but out of all the WWII leaders he probably had more ideological similarities to Hitler than anyone else other than Mussolini. I actually firmly hold that he's probably the only fascist leader in the UK's history.
He didn't have to, he could just starve them while they were forced to hold British guns
and also an imperialist
He was a nationalist, anti-communist, racial supremacist conservative
His views on the Indians are basically the same as Hitler's views on Jews
I mean, no. Not really. He wasn't dogpiled by most countries (whatever the fuck that means) because he didn't fucking invade them. He was still completely horrific to those he held power over and had been given control over due to Britain's prior invasions.
Literally 90% of his world view was just the same as Hitler's
No, I mean it makes no sense with the rest of his ideology
It was the west who turned him down
And Stalin literally tried to form an antifascist pact with the west
I said he had the option
I never said it would be positive
Actually, to be fair Churchill's staunch and frankly nonsensical anti Hitler stance considering everything else they agreed on was probably the best thing about him
and that's why you proofread <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Churchill didn't have to worry about Hitler. If we're being realistic at any point in time he probably could have left the war with no real problems or consequences to his nation past the damage that had already been done. The same wasn't true for Stalin. The invasion of Poland was an existential threat to Russia and the fact that it was going to happen wasn't exactly a secret. What do you think the best course of action is here? What the Brits and French did was literally nothing. What Stalin did was buy time. Neither are the best course of action morally, but at least one makes sense strategically. And there probably was a better course of action that could have been taken, but acting like this was some grand collaboration is just absurd. Stalin was outwardly antifascist, Hitler was outwardly anti communist. They both knew war was inevitable, the only reason this could even happen was because they both viewed it as in their interests.

Ilyn was exiled from the USSR, not explicitly deported anywhere. Lenin wanted him gone, but he didn't really care what happened to him afterwards. It probably makes more sense to look at this from the perspective of the impact he was having on the country that exiled him rather than the impact he had on the country he ended up in.

I agree that a lot of communists in the west at the time were pretty short sighted with regards to the Nazis. It's just also that the entirety of the world really was. It was mostly just the east who wasn't. And yes, the heal turn when the USSR was invaded is something.
I can't tell whether or not that post is meant to be satirical. Mostly because it's a mix of half truths and outright falsehoods.

Stalin and Hitler were never allies at any point. Stalin knew full well that war with Germany was inevitable. He also knew that Soviet production was far higher than German, so he signed a deal that would stall the beginning of the war since that benefited him, and notably only after talks for a west/east alliance against fascism fell through.

The Soviets were always antifascist. They did not support fascist regimes. They supported Chinese communists, Japanese communists, German Socialists and Spanish anarchists, all against fascists. In fact they were pretty much the only side not fucking supporting Franco by the end of the Spanish civil war.

And yes, western communists were anti war. So were western liberals, western conservatives and basically everyone. It was literally just the far right who was actually calling for war at the start of WWII, and interestingly the Soviets.
Kinda surprising honestly, especially considering how much he agreed with Hitler in general
This prediction feels like cope too
Hoping it won't stop there
The fact that a fucking Earl managed to be a better fighter for the working class than this load of clowns
Yeah, Hitler 100% had options that could have got the UK and US on side
Believe it or not Chamberlain was actually relatively anti Hitler for a Tory
I mean, there were more Tories who supported Hitler's rise than not
...it was a popular position in the UK at the time. IDK if it was a majority ever but people wanted to do it
I'm not saying that would have been a good thing, I'm saying that's an option they had
The UK 100% had the option to just say "sucks to be you" and make peace
and if you'd bother reading, that's what I'm talking about
Britain remained allied to France for the duration of the war
But the alliance held
The French were basically so thoroughly crushed that there was no way to actually assist them
and act more closely to each other
Geopolitically strong allies aren't always the strongest militarily, they just value each other more strongly
Broom, I'm talking geopolitical strength, not military strength
Which wasn't even that bad of an assumption, Britain and France had basically fought against each other in every war before WWI
Hitler assumed the alliance would break easily
By the strength here I simply mean the actual depth and support the two nations had for each other
His assumption was that the British would seek a "Germanic alliance" based off of his racial theory.
It's important here to note that Hitler viewed the world through a highly racialised lens and his assumption was that Britain did too. He wasn't even really incorrect, he just missed on the specifics and underestimated the strength of the Britain/France alliance.
The Brits were also at or near the top of Hitler's weird race hierarchy
Yeah, no shit once Britain entered the war he stopped trying to keep them neutral. When the UK leadership changed it became pretty obvious that wouldn't happen.
I mean, early on he was hoping that the UK would actually be an ally in the war
It's a historical fact that Hitler actively tried to keep Britain neutral in the war and would have been happy to just leave the UK alone if they'd have thrown France to the wolves.
At the start of the war much of the empire was already strained and their were already independence movements active across the whole empire. The empire had been strained for decades and the wealthier colonies, Aus, NZ, Canada and South Africa had already yote themselves out with the threat of revolt (all of which would have succeeded) had the UK not have allowed them to leave. The war actually presented an opportunity to hold some of their holdings just a little longer.

But had the UK have not fought in the war they would have immediately lost their holdings in the pacific, because while Germany would have been happy to leave the UK alone Japan was not. This is also part of the reason why they got involved.
but also, we can't actually engage in warfare for very obvious reasons
Like, my stance on this is, I have no issue funnelling arms to Ukraine as long as the war continues. Give them everything short of nukes. It's probably best to try to stop it at some point though, because that nation's already fucked and the longer the war continues the more and more fucked it will become.
Like, literally. The UK could have if it wanted to just been a neutral entity. Most nations did not have that choice.
I didn't even say they were bad, I said they were probably the best thing about him
I argued that from his PoV, as the leader of an island nation that could have selfishly stayed out of the war and suffered no consequences at all the fierce anti Hitler stance and entry to the war in part to save someone he hated were some pretty strange stances
Did I ever argue against that?
I mean, yes, the war would have been a lot worse if he didn't enter and it was a good thing he did
Ukraine is a different scenario. Not acting means allowing another nation to infringe on their autonomy
The EU should fuck off and keep to itself too
To be fair I actually don't think that Japanese communists would have done anything to the US other than some small economic damage
Unironically yes. I want all nations to respect others autonomy at a base line and not attempt to interfere. That goes for China and Russia too.
I'd still like to see international socialism built, but until then you need to be pretty fucking protectionist
Right now I'd argue it's unfortunately the only viable form of communism
I personally expect the US to stop being imperialist shitrags. I know it's a big ask, but like
It's not something I'm fond of, but it's quite big in South America
Communists can be nationalists
So IDGAF if they were or weren't threats to the US
I actually believe in self determinism
See, here's the thing Broom
and even they had to be crushed
Like, the Japanese communists are the most peaceful, pacifist and non-revolutionary communists on earth
but hey, you do you
I personally think Japanese imperialists were the bigger threat than Japanese communists
The only difference is that some of the people responsible in Germany were actually punished
It was pretty much the exact same
Don't ask Abe about his Grandad
But still wasn't great
Wasn't quite as bad in Germany as Japan
Many Nazis were rewarded with good government positions
The far right coopting of socialist language and symbols is old
Probably not France though interestingly enough. Attacking the USSR first might have actually split the alliance since France was a lot more pro USSR at the time than the UK
wait
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_in_the_European_Parliament_%E2%80%93_GUE/NGL
Yes, the Greek communist party were elected and are still the second largest party in Greece
And for Greece leaving the EU is a lot different than the UK. Greece are an exploited party. The UK were nationalist idiots. The UK actually had the power to do something to improve the EU. Greece didn't.
If the Greek communists weren't crushed they would have voted to leave by now, but the boot licking libs were put in place so that can't happen
and installed puppet governments
And then they did the same thing as the US
^
Like, that's a Palpatine tier quote
Greece. The entire Greek crisis was caused by German and French banks actions. The Greeks elected a communist party in order to deal with the economic strain placed on them by the EU. This party attempted to negotiate with the EU in good faith, which was a mistake. We even got a quote from the EU that I rather love from the EU/Greek negotiations. "Elections cannot be allowed to change the course of economic policy", from Wolfgang Sch√§uble, at the time the German finance minister.
But also Cypher, the EU has crushed nations autonomy before too. Even within its own ranks. It does a lot of the same crap the US does.
The issue is "Japan might elect communists" does not remotely fit any of these cases
There are also other times where intervention could potentially be justified. For example a leader who loses an election and commits a coup to stay in power (and as such themselves undermines democracy) or in the case of active genocide.
I think intervening to aid a nation that's actually being invaded by a foreign force is a bit different
And they've come out completely fine
Iceland also devalued the krona at one point to help deal with a default
It would be devalued. That isn't inherently bad
The assumption that the drachma would have nil value is pretty insane
Like, have you seen what Greece looks like at current? The nation is fucking ravaged
Honestly it's an improvement compared to Greece currently
Also, just on this point Greece would be benefited by a depressed currency. The high Euro actually makes their issues worse because it makes it much harder for the Greek economy to do the main things it wants to do, the largest sector being tourism. Greece would actually be a much more attractive tourist destination if things were cheaper which its own depressed currency would allow for. Depressed currencies also make infrastructural building generally cheaper. Basically all capitalist economic theory says that Greece should be printing more money now.
Grexit would unironically be a bigger hit to the EU's economy than Brexit was, but it's something that needs to happen because the status quo for Greece is horrific
Why do you think they're so desperate for this not to happen?
And yeah, the most hurt by it would be German and French banks <:LuL:789259461470322728>
The alternative is just indefinite austerity though
I'm aware it's not good
They can't do that while they're in the EU and subject to austerity politics
Start actually rebuilding? Print their own money, spend it on infrastructure and probably to promote tourism
Greece would be far better off exiting the EU and defaulting
2014 was when they won and that's when they got absolutely screwed over by Europe

Capitalist complains about capitalism being capitalism

Like, arguing for an unpopular policy because it's better=absolute dictatorship.
It's quite fun to peel back sometimes
Broom likes to take things that were said and spin them off through about 15 layers of abstraction
Also, can we stop with this capitalist mystic BS? Japan is a country that implemented certain policies. Those policies are material, can be copied by other nations and can produce similar effects. The idea that there's something special about any nation other than something like natural resources is just BS.
So like, there's that
And popular consensus in Greece is to leave anyway
And there's actual good arguments for keeping the Euro, unlike Greece where the Euro is just clearly value extraction
Italy is in a position where the delta between their own currency and the Euro is a lot smaller though
Unironically probably also a good idea <:LuL:789259461470322728>

It's a multiple correlation argument.

The more wealth that's passed onto you the more likely your parents were conservative. The more likely your parents are conservative the more likely you are. The more wealth you have the less likely you are to die. Therefore progressives die younger. Therefore populations, not people become more conservative as they age.
Most people have a solid political ideology that doesn't change by the time they're 30
My point was actually that becoming a conservative is mostly a thing that doesn't happen or is very rare
The effect of generations becoming more conservative as they age can be completely explained by population level effects <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
The fact that Millennials are is actually very unusual
And they don't tend to change much as they age
People tend to solidify their political stance young with heavy influence from their parents and a degree of material conditions
My favourite political party
all of those groups are statistically poorer than conservatives due to generational wealth and ideological inheritance
It doesn't matter
I mean, socialist, unionist, general progressive
<:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
My country had a 90+% turnout last year
That doesn't matter. Those in the silent gen who were socialists tended to be poor which is one of the strongest predictors for early death. That's just as true in Europe
Basically the further left you are the poorer you are on average and the poorer you are the more likely you are to die in any given year, therefore there's a correlation that basically means left wing people die younger which makes generations generally more right wing as they age.
in most cases anyway
The large effect is actually a wealth/vote correlation and a wealth/lifespan correlation that makes vote appear to shift
it's not just one off either, Millennials have been trending Greens every election since 2007.
This same pattern is happening in Aus too, the statistic of interest here was that 2022 was the first time Millennials voted for the Greens in higher numbers than the Liberals

I doubt anything will come of this, but it'd be hilarious if it did
A broken squirrel nuts twice a day...
actually, they do
Cops do not and should never enforce the will of private corporations
It's not even a crime. It's just breaking Amtrak's policy. The cops even getting involved here is super questionable.
if the reason she was asked to leave in the first place was unjustified, and I mean unjustified, not illegal then refusal to leave is justified
...yes it does
Including Amtrak because this has blown up into a colossal shitstorm
I mean, they can deescalate and let it go. It's probably better for all involved.
The reasons why people aren't withholding judgement is because the entire policing profession is fucked. It really doesn't matter how exactly these police acted. They could have acted perfectly. This event still shows up what the police are often used for, which is terrorising racial minorities for no real reason. Black people are just used to the police being antagonistic towards them. That's why they don't give them any sort of benefit of the doubt when something like this happens.
and for some reason that didn't meet any consequence
Australia is pretty disgusting, the leader of the opposition here was a pig and he dropped off an Aboriginal boy 15km outside of Brisbane with no shoes
but they're more likely to be arrested for public drunkenness regardless of whether or not they're drunk
not by a huge margin
They're less likely to be publicly drunk IIRC
No
This is a huge issue in Australia with our public drunkenness laws which are basically designed to outlaw being Aboriginal on the streets at night
It is just a fact that laws like this are far more likely to be enforced against black people
Can we at least start with that as a base line assumption?
Do you actually need a source that there's systemic bias in policing?
It's a well known fact that there's massive amounts of systemic bias in policing.
They knew the race of the person when they kicked them off the train. There were multiple options available to them.
People do things against the rules on the trains all the time here. The cops will not get involved unless it's an actual crime. The only time I've ever seen cops get involved with anything train related was with regards to someone being very verbally abusive.
they didn't have to do that
I mean, the thing that delays the train is kicking them off and calling the cops
it's up to him if he wants to try to answer it, you're not interviewing a politician here <:sigh:230149462880813056>
seriously, it's really annoying
Don't just flurry the same question back at him over and over
but they should not
Squatting is a logical response to a broken system
And just to be clear on this, this ends when someone actually breaks a law. If they're being abusive, violent etc, then just call the cops. At that point it is their job to get involved. I just don't think they should be adjudicating petty corporate disputes.
Literally just using space that should be used anyway
Based
I think it's wrong for the police to get involved if they haven't broken a law, I think claiming trespass is pretty wank when they've already paid for a ticket and also the time taken is just a disruption to everyone else.
I mean, ultimately what are the choices? You can ask them to leave, then if they say no?
It's one of those issues where any method of removing them other than politely asking them to leave is more disruptive, especially in this case than just not doing that thing
I personally just don't see an issue with it if they're doing no harm
If they're not being violent or causing large levels of disruption then they should be allowed to stay on even if they're not in full compliance with the rules.
From my PoV I don't actually give a fuck about the letter of the law. What I take issue with is firstly the cops acting as thugs for a corporation and secondly just the morality of the situation. If this is not against their rules then they need to change their rules.
Where'd you find this guy?

I have extreme anxiety around driving
And, no, I know it's not normal
Plus I don't need to drive anyway
Being scared of the most dangerous thing that people do in their everyday lives isn't irrational.
There are bigger countries with fewer people and better public transport
And yes, that does make driving more stressful
And I think low speed limits should be enforced physically by infrastructure anywhere where pedestrians are likely to be.
I support a 30km/h defacto speed limit Mac, I unironically think that the speed that's common in the inner city should just be the speed of residential roads.
But that's honestly how most roads should be designed. Narrowing roads is the only effective way to actually get people to slow the fuck down.
Also Aus is a shit example anyway because if America scores a 0/10 for urban design Aus is like a 2/10
Which are the safest roads in terms of deaths
What's rare are people who don't get stressed driving on narrow, inner city roads
Of course there are. It's still an individual thing
What I'm saying is that the infrastructure is designed in a way to promote driver comfort above everything else, including important things like safety
No, I am one
If you're wondering it's to do with road widening, which both makes roads feel less stressful to drive on but actually significantly more dangerous
The stress of driving is a normal thing. It should feel stressful to pilot a car that's at least several hundred KG and capable of ending lives in seconds. The fact that American roads don't feel stressful is a psychological trick and it's partially responsible for America's absurd road deaths.
Still want to move closer in to Melbourne though
Yeah, for me I don't even own a car but I can get away with that because I'm in cycling distance of a train station and shops.
Also on this point, yes, I get anxious when I try to drive. Like, sometimes to the point of full on hyperventilation. Something about the extreme risks of driving.
I don't think timing around public transport has ever been a huge issue for me and it's not like Australia has hugely frequent PT or anything
yeah
Even if you were conservative why would you like him anyway? at least Shapiro and Peterson type people are moderately engaging (and fun to clown on). Walsh is just fucking sad.
Regardless what I'm stating is that being afraid of things that are most likely to kill you is most logical, so a fear of cars is more logical than other fears
Because fear keeps you from doing dumb shit that kills you
The issue here is that I didn't say I was paranoid at any time. I said it's the most logical and rational fear to have. Given general health, age and the fact that I don't engage with a lot of the other things that could kill me, what's left over Iski?
Or alternatively there's literally nothing I can do at all for some of them
Like, I can avoid most of these things far more easily than I can the risk from traffic
I also don't drink much and don't take drugs
I'm also generally quite fearful of Covid and take as many precautions as I can
So would I
This is why I said preventable. You can argue as to suicide, but the rest are either unpreventable or only partially preventable.
Anything irrational there?
Also Matt, I want to point out that in this comment you replied to I said STRESS not FEAR. There's quite an important distinction here. I really don't give a fuck if you're fearful of driving or not, I am, whatever, it's unimportant. Driving should not be a stress-free experience. It's dangerous. The stress helps to reduce that danger. When it's stress-free people stop paying attention to that danger. That's why wide roads are so dangerous compared to more stressful, narrower roads.
But like, that's another thing. There's some activities that are more dangerous. And I'm not afraid of them because I can just like, not.
I mean, as long as you don't enjoy fucking with venomous snakes or something
And it's also why fear of cars is unironically the most logical fear. That's the thing that's most likely to actually happen.
This is why probability needs to be a part of fear
And no Matt, fear of anything that can kill you is reasonable. Fear breeds respect anyway.
I mean, I think you're also overestimating what I mean when I say fear. I don't mean that I won't walk somewhere because of cars, I do mean that I will try to take long term steps in my life to have as few cars around me as possible, because they are scarier than things people are generally scared of.
There are quite a few cities on earth with drastically reduced numbers of cars and  places where you can walk completely away from cars. Fuck, even just moving nearer to Melbourne's CBD would help a lot.
*why do you think I want to move somewhere with far fucking fewer cars
And it's not even particularly uncommon
It's something I have zero control over
Mate, the quickest way for me to die is a dickhead swerving onto the footpath. I actually find not being somewhat afraid of that absurd.
I'm arguing that a fear of cars is 100% healthy and rational. They are the leading cause of preventable deaths in Australia. I'm also arguing that my specific case is prompted by anxiety and not a strict fear of cars. I still wouldn't want to drive cars even if I didn't feel like shit even being a passenger in one.
They are the most dangerous thing around me at any time
I never said I'm not afraid of cars, I'm literally more fearful of cars than anything else in society.
None of this is irrational Matt
No shit, why do you think I avoid cars?
No, a past life event is the source of my anxiety
Anxiety triggered by driving
Is that fucking hard to understand?
I don't hyperventilate because I'm afraid of cars, I hyperventilate because I have anxiety.
Treating cars like they're exceptionally dangerous and attempting to avoid them is a rational reaction. Hyperventilation is caused by anxiety related to my past experience with cars.
But I've been living my life just fine without driving. That's the thing here
The most rational fear is the most likely thing to kill you
You understand why that's an incoherent statement right?
...a fear of the thing that's the most likely to kill you is irrational?
That doesn't make it irrational, the most likely way for me to die is via car
But we're not exactly talking about heavy hitters here are we
and I think Laos?
There's a lot of factors that were not controlled by China at all. For example the fact that they literally had no trade partners other than North Korea at the time of the famine.
No famine is caused by a single decision, famines are complex and require multiple failures
This is something that's always missing from discourse on this issue. Famines also occur frequently in capitalist countries and as long as they have the resources to trade it's usually not a huge issue
Something that needs to be pointed out is that yes, sanctioning countries does make famines more likely and worse.
yeah, but also it's important to point out the hyperfixation on the bad things and the outright fabrications performed by western media
As much as some of his views are guttertrash, I'd strongly recommend Noam Chomsky's work Manufacturing Consent with regards to this. It's a very good book that lays out what's happening very well.
This is how you end up with things like a news story claiming that men in North Korea must have KJU's hair cut and another story claiming that copying his haircut is punishable by death. Or Time Magazine gushing over how great of leaders Lenin and Stalin were during WWII. They don't give a fuck about the truth.
Capitalist media control. It's even more efficient than state controlled media. You just put a bunch of people in charge who have an interest in maintaining the system as it exists and demonising any alternative because the system as it exists makes them a lot of money.
Which was less brutal in communist states than capitalist states anyway. Industrial Britain was worker abuse central and industrial America was built on the back of slaves
The problems largely came from the fact that every communist state was absurdly poor before their revolution and had to undergo industrialisation
usually quite a bit better
like I say, it's a propaganda victory. Communist states have performed at least as well as capitalist states at similar levels of development.
...it worked. The two largest growths in wealth in the last century have been in China and the USSR. Cuba massively outperforms its region and Vietnam performs on par with its region in spite of western suppression if its state and support for the neighbouring Thai state.
I mean, the fact that communist is even viewed as a negative thing is one of the greatest propaganda victories of western capitalism. It's literally just a system of ownership and economics.
At least Liberals manage to not always suck on social issues though, and national soc dems can actually be pretty good on most issues if you never have them acknowledge the existence of another country.
I support emancipatory movements. Liberal economics supported by at least the first three groups I listed as right wing are inherently against that since they lead to further repression of the working class
<@699397350736658513> I don't think all sides are bad. I think the right is bad. I have no issue with socialists, communists, anarchists or even well meaning social democrats. I take issues with right wing ideologies. Conservatives, liberals, fascists and nationalist social democrats who run defence for liberals.
That's about what I'd expect at least
I imagine this got deleted because a ton of American libs are completely incapable of contextualising anything outside of the lens of America and decided to leave absolutely idiotic comments non-stop about how the two things are exactly the same, possibly dipping into harassment.
And the military could always later be convinced by the US to flip sides
Yeah January 6th while an attempt at undermining democracy was deeply unserious. This is fucked.
It's also why I find American's comparing this to Jan 6th and pearl clutching about it strange. Like, the US government, lead by Democrats at the time has done worse than this to Brazil. We wouldn't even be here without bipartisan backing of the Brazilian dictatorship. Sure, it's probably inspired by Jan 6th, but the historical context is very different and much more serious in Brazil.
As completely horseshit as this is it's still nowhere near 1964
One of the comments on this does make a good point though. Calling this unprecedented when Brazil has literally had a fascist coup in the past is... strange
Einstein was actually super based
And also of government funding being highly efficient
But that is an example of collaboration rather than any sort of competition
The solution to monopoly isn't competition. It's regulation. Monopoly is inevitable. There is no system that I've ever seen that can stop it. All we can do is control it.
But almost everything in the Soviet economy was organised collaboratively rather than competitively. It's actually one of the best examples of how collaboration is more efficient than competition.
Actually capitalist patents are pretty horrific for slowing innovation

As someone who's actually went reasonably deep into the sciences, most innovation comes from collaboration and iteration, not competition.

It does not. It just gets you 15 brands of toilet paper
Also capitalism encourages innovation <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Considering socialism is also based on individual rights, it just values some rights that capitalism doesn't and doesn't value the right to build unreasonable amounts of wealth. It's also based on equity rather than equality.
Even that first result on the left is completely wrong
It's literally the evolutionary purpose of fear.

Like, I fucking wish Tories were more Smithsonian.

~~Adam Smith did support limited welfare~~
100%, social democracy was a reaction to communism. Not all reaction is always horrible.
Wealth in the USSR came mostly in the distribution of more and better quality basic goods. As an example the increase in quality and quantity of food the average person received over the length of the union. It 100% did go to the people, saying it didn't is projection for capitalism where it actually doesn't.
like fascism
some systems are objectively terrible in every way
that's bullshit
No, not every system has pros
Neoliberal capitalism is also a terrible fucking choice
I don't think talking about famines is even really a logical thing to do in general. Most countries in the post war environment had famines and some countries fail to even distribute food that does exist properly to this day. The greatest failures of the Soviet model had a lot more to do with the extreme tunnel vision on efficiency at the expense of any luxury goods at all. Communist countries were very good at building up an acceptable baseline of wealth, making sure that in the long term, once early famines were solved citizens didn't literally starve, creation of medicines and introducing things to make their work generally easier but at no point did they really start to manufacture luxury goods, which had a huge impact on the quality of life. Having said that the more equitable distribution of food, work, education and medicine were all huge wins.
The Holodomor is for various reasons an even worse example. I could go deep into it but I'm incredibly tired right now
Yes, something being government funded isn't inherently socialist. It can be but doesn't have to be. It's kinda definitionally not capitalist though
I'm curious as to what you even meant. Because it seems obvious to me that the physical components of the PC exist due to labour while the technology it relies on exist due to social funding. It seems hard to me to argue that it's a product of capitalism in any way.
~~in spite of the title it's mostly talking about production and innovation under capitalism~~

Oh hey, this came out at the right time <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
The first response honestly seems decent
but like, I just felt like the meme was more the response that was deserved
I'd argue they're a product of labour and that labour can happen both under a capitalist of socialist economic system
That's literally the reason why communists repressed reactionaries BTW, it's also the reason why capitalists repress socialists. The reality is that even if a capitalist element broke off from a communist world it would be crushed, just like communism was in our world. It's about systems of global power. If one system has all the power it becomes very hard to overthrow. That's why global revolution is so important.

This isn't justifying anything, it's just stating the reality. Any system that actively allows a system in opposition to it to exist will fall.

Liberalism has its roots in racism. Liberal economics are literally designed to reinforce racial hierarchies while giving plausible deniability.
And it just so happens that's white people
we really don't want to reach the last
Because capitalism is the second last phase of imperialism
Point 1: This is due to extreme subversion by capitalist states and an undemocratic disillusion of the USSR. If Communist states were powerful like capitalist states were post WWII they could have and would have done the same thing. 

Point 2: Yes. They started poor. Capitalist countries that start poor are even poorer. Woe be to Nigeria, abused for its entire existence.

Point 3: Everyone is propagandised to. Capitalist countries are the masters of it.

Point 4:The US has supported coups in more countries than any other country on earth. I literally bought one up earlier. To reiterate Brazil is only where it is today because Kennedy and LBJ organised a coup against the democratically elected socialist leader of the country. Capitalist countries also use violence against their own citizens. Remember that the CIA got into a shootout with MLK at one point in his life.

Taiwan to China is a historical issue. It's kinda like if Florida had broken away during the civil war and as the US moved to retake it the British rolled up and stopped them. But then Florida laid claim to all the rest of the US and the international community recognised Florida rather than the rest of the US for 30 years.

The KMT are my favourite supporters of ~~fascism~~ freedom
Also disproportionate focus on one issue while at most token acknowledgement of the other, which is what western media does at best is still absurd in and of itself. And this is something that I see a lot on the centre left and from anarchobidenists (libs pretending to be anarchists).
The issue here though Pug is that most of the most rabid anti China people are libs who are actually in favour of fucking Cuba
and that should be respected
and like, the ultimate answer here is that neither should be embargoed and Taiwan should have a chance to vote on their future.
~~seriously there's way too many parallels between Taiwan and Cuba and I wish western libs were more able to see them~~
Also, on the Taiwan point China doesn't want a hostile state just off of its coast. Which is a shitty justification but it's also one that the US has literally used in the past, without the historical context of that state being a part of their state for the last millennium or so, and continues to use to embargo them in a very similar way to the way the US embargoes their island victims. So like, it's hardly a slam dunk "China bad" or at least "China worse than US" argument. It can be a valid "state bad" or "great power bad" argument, which is why I say China criticisms of the west can make sense though an anarchist lens, because they're pretty active in opposing the US too.
Well aware, everything always traces back to the Falun Gong. But western media published it completely uncritically which is why it's so believed within the west.
When the mainstream view is "The Chinese government does organ harvesting" then yeah, any view with nuance is going to look supportive <:LuL:789259461470322728>

After how many fucking members votes Keith's wing of the party pulled against Corbyn he should have to try to survive one himself.

The issue here isn't actually the blocking of obtaining puberty blockers from my understanding. It's a change to the legal framework that would allow people to more easily change their legal gender

You could basically have a system of stocks that are distributed strictly for labour, but if you sell them or allow sale you're basically selling the control that workers should have

Like, everyone at the upper levels of the Catholic church has at least covered up child abuse. The entire leadership needs to be removed and jailed.
Like the most based thing Italy could ever do would just be to send their police in to seize all the Vatican's documents
Meh, IDGAF about purging church leadership with a history of child abuse. I don't think it's morally wrong at all
Leadership is the actual problem here
And to be clear, we should be going after leadership
And yes, we should purge those weird cults too
No, the Catholic church specifically has been abusing children and covering it up for years. That's why I harbour a special fucking hatred for them that's reserved mostly for weird cults.
And the pope is the greatest sinner of all, he allows the church to exist as it is and protects all his sheeple
We should purge the Catholic church though. Legit send the police in with batons to get the list of kids, they deserve nothing less.

As in, China was airing where the balloon was
And if China wanted to tap into wireless signals they have better ways to do this than a balloon. They can and do have people on the ground who could very easily do whatever they need
At least to me there's so many issues with the US's story here. We know they've been tracking it since launch, they knew about it before it entered their territory and it entered through Alaska. If they actually cared they could have easily taken it down there. The absolute bare minimum here is that the US cared more about the optics than the balloon and is opportunistically using this.
That's basically what I was talking about, but they can still get caught in strong wind currents and be blown off course, which is at least what China's claiming happened here.
Lithium is also not super common and preferred for its electrical properties
yes I think the US government is angling for war
The US government has been acting increasingly belligerent here
Plus the US has a history of lying about the military actions and capacity of states they want to go to war with, so I have zero confidence in them as a source.
This kind of balloon can just go up and down. It can use that to enter a certain altitude and predict a destination, but if the prevailing winds are all in one direction it's going in that direction.
Why doubt it's a weather balloon. This has literally happened dozens of times with weather balloons in the past.
Like, I'm pretty sure it's just an off course weather balloon and the US is manufacturing consent again.
Why do people think you can maneuver a ballon easily. It can go up and down but any movement in any other direction is at the mercy of prevailing winds.
it's far from Keith's worse stance
Honestly this is still something I'd support on a fundamental level.
at all
I just don't think the top brass in the US is very smart
Feels like he's trying to walk it back but can't just come out and say it
Because this is the sort of shit that even people who claim to be anti US will say
The issue is this comment
At that point yes
It doesn't come off as sarcastic when that's a legit response to anyone who questions the US on this that people actually use
Matt, I don't support the Chinese govt. I just recognise that the US is far more militaristic and imperialistic and do not take them at their word.
A massacre by any definition?
because that's stupid
I just don't think they're using fucking balloons to do so
Matt, I'm fully aware that China is and does spy on the US and vies versa
OK then
Pointing out that the US frequently lies to manufacture consent=tankie
The explanation that makes the most sense is that it was some sort of research balloon that went off course and the US are just being hawks here. It fits with the general pattern of anti-China rhetoric of both the Trump and Biden admins.
China's shown it can spy using satellites, something far more impressive than a balloon.
The "just to show you can" point makes no fucking sense
There's even a particularly well known feminist analysis of the original Super Mario Bros, it's extremely hard to make art that's completely apolitical to the degree of being basically impossible
Apolitical talks about how great the Cuban revolutionaries were <a:HarumiThumbsUp:827358424177311794>
It's also always been very pro LGBT
Also since when haven't magical girls been political? The entire genre has roots in feminism
Art is inherently political
But as the others are saying yes, it's just capitalism driving pointless overproduction. Because the way you make money in a capitalist system isn't actually doing anything useful, it's creating Shrek brand disposable razors or something fucking stupid that no-one needs.
It's also the raised level of consumption they partake in. They travel more, have more things, throw newer things away sooner and just generally waste more. This is why even when you look at personal emissions they're still several dozens of times higher than an average westerner.

Oh hey, my MP just resigned <a:AkaneParty:516144087921852436>
anyway, the single biggest reason I won't be playing is because Harry Potter is shit and the game looks crap and generic. Not even worth pirating.
They've acknowledged this as something that requires them to do something good too keep their conscience clean, but that logic fails when you understand that the two actions can be undertaken separately.
The other point is that the two actions are not mutually exclusive or tied together. GF Reviews could have done literally anything else and donated to the Trevor Project.
and like, repeatedly doing the same actions with very low chances of success is kinda a hallmark of left wing politics anyway <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
The idea that things like this can just be rode out comes from a very privileged position where the sort of anti-trans cultural backlash being driven by the game doesn't really impact you. Some sort of pushback against it is pretty needed IMO
and it's what people should be doing
Trying to convince people not to buy it is still inherently the correct thing to do
...I wasn't agreeing with you
I think everyone's already accepted that any attempt at a boycott is pretty much a Sisyphean task, that doesn't mean that it shouldn't be attempted.
Why do people struggle to draw that link here
I mean, I have no problem saying that people who donate to anti trans politicians or support someone like Shapiro are not an ally regardless of what else they do.

It's just dumb and confusing. It's like they wanted an olive branch but only to defend themselves from criticism
Like, this shit runs deep through the series
To me this still feels more like standard Harry Potter lack of attention to detail or any effort to research the cultures of minorities
Standard operation coppaganda
JK is more relevant than a random transphobic Tory MP. There's more forms of influence than just direct political power
The streamers this is impacting aren't innocent. The streamers receiving pushback for this are those who have built more left wing, trans inclusive communities. Due to their position they had heard about what was happening with the game, they'd heard about how it impacted trans communities before its release. They were often involved in discussions around the game before its release. We're talking about people who knew what would happen, knew the consequences of their actions, knew it would bring at least perceived harm to their communities (I'd argue actual harm) and chose to do it anyway. It's not random streamers who are getting pushback for this. It's streamers with very significant trans communities who are more involved in the trans space than average. Random centrist streamers are getting minimal pushback because the trans section of their community isn't large enough and they don't really care about trans issues anyway.
IDK, Australians are quite content to do nothing while our healthcare system is eroded and Whitlam is basically just a rotisserie chicken in his fucking grave at this point.
Conservatives can actually hold either of these ideologies. Churchill was far more in the first camp and most modern conservative politicians are neolibs.
Not really. There's significant differences better neoliberalism and more traditional liberalism, which is what Churchill broadly prescribed to, although he was notably tempered and restrained by Attlee's reforms in his second term. The two schools view the government as having a completely different role. A traditional liberal holds the belief that the government should remove itself from markets as much as possible, minimise taxes and allow "free" markets to control the economy. A neoliberal accepts that markets are inherently unstable and believes that government's role is to stabilise them, so neolibs view government investment and support of industry as needed.
He's just an old school conservative colonialist, which is even worse
Yep, I wouldn't even call him a neolib though
He had a second term my man

and to be clear they don't usually print their entire code, they print a few lines that they're currently running

Gotta go check out that AI safety guy's youtube channel soon
It looks like someone was able to get it to give away at least part of its own source code too

At least here when Labor does neolib bullshit they feed the Greens
Also the UK lacking a viable left wing third party really hurts here
Someone like Keir being elected ensures that. If you had someone who could use an immense election win to restructure society you could push the Tories down, but Keir is just a Tory himself so he's not actually going to give people a long term reason not to vote for them.
I thought the DUP threw a tantrum and sabotaged the whole thing
Is Stormont even functional right now?
But yeah, some of them seem pretty fucking bad
It at least seems like some of the names being thrown up for SNP leadership aren't completely terrible
Like, I actually see a pathway to improvement in most countries but in the UK it's more just shit in every direction
The UKs current politics are a special kind of hopeless
Hey, I rarely agree with any of the other cunts on anything
Can't have nice things
That's probably true
True enough
I'm kinda surprised that the LibDems aren't doing better though
They're probably unironically the best party in British politics that's remotely relevant right now
Scottish National Party
I have big doubts about it though
It'd be more embarrassing than when the Liberals became a third party honestly
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
On a semi related note the most recent poll out of the UK has the Tories polling so badly that if this actually happened they'd lose opposition to the SNP
<:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
Which caused somewhat of a constitutional crisis and might lead to another independence vote because that's the degree that Tories will go to in order to be transphobes
Also this bill is old and the Tories killed it at Westminster
Scotland isn't being the problem here, they're doing better than the rest of the UK by a lot
It's a cert for legal recognition, basically Scotland is making it easier to transition legally
That quote would make more sense to invoke if China was actually anywhere near as imperialistic as any of the nations it opposes. As it stands it's still within reason and having a non-aligned nation with an economy near the size of the US that likes to fuck with institutions like the IMF is actually a good thing. And Deng talking about imperialism when he was deeply involved in China's one modern imperialistic war is pretty rich anyway <:LuL:789259461470322728>
I'd agree for 90% of the claims. Rescinding anything that China also claims would be a horrible idea and the more status quo stance here makes more sense. But for the few that China doesn't claim they can really just do whatever, if their stance is ultimately nationalism then they could just simplify to have the same claims as China quite easily.
China wouldn't give a fuck since it's not like the PRC claims Mongolia
They could
They haven't actually done anything to rescind any claims though
There are claims they could easily abandon without any consequence from China though. Like Mongolia. China doesn't claim it so if they actually wanted to drop any of their claims that would be an easy one. Sometimes political parties just lie though.
At no point have the DPP actually amended the constitution to cede any territorial claims and they still actively claim and administer Taiping Island.
Also, every nation has corruption, China is more likely to fire and jail its corrupt politicians than most. This is a good thing. Many nations just allow them to stay in office including pretty much all of the west which has broadly legalised anything but the highest levels of corruption and just doesn't report on it. I'd rather a nation do what China does and actually arrest the fucks and the only other nations I know of that are western aligned that do are the East Asian nations.
China's actions in the South China Sea predate Xi. The dispute has been ongoing for decades now. Acting like Xi is in any way unique here is absurd, especially since his actions actually have the backing of Taiwan, who claims the same area and has actually backed China several times in its court disputes and military actions in the region that it also views as its claim.

This has been a constant in the area and isn't even just China. Most nations in the region have had some sort of incident with pretty much every other nation in the region, the media is just the loudest about anything involving China.
Xi doesn't seem much like a hawk to me. He's been pretty active in China's overall economic involvement in the world and hasn't been any more aggressive than any of his predecessors. The only thing that's changed is the west's propagandistic stance on China post Trump. The hawks aren't even really in China or the Whitehouse, they're just in the media.
I mean, Taiwan has been pretty much left alone for decades now. The Chinese government really isn't the imminent threat to Taiwan that the western media makes them out to be
And Taiwan isn't delusional enough to actually pick a fight with China. That would result in China immediately seizing the island. Pretty much everyone understands that China is in the dominant position. They're not likely to just outright attack Taiwan because they don't want to get the US involved, but if Taiwan were to be that dumb then they'd have an easy excuse.
The relationship between China and Taiwan is incredibly complicated but I don't think that a "lust for blood" is an exceptionally prevalent view
Falls in line with what I've seen generally. Somewhat progressive streamers do something questionable and can't handle any pushback that they're not used to so melt down.
Also apparently her reaction to people pointing this out on Twitter was to block them, so IDK why anyone's defending her <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
Apparently it changed in April of last year, which would explain why I haven't seen that while streaming.
And I don't really believe her because I know how automod works and it doesn't filter those words unless you tell it to. The simpler explanation here is that she got caught doing something dumb and then tried to act like the victim.
most of the stories they have there about it are actually pretty bad
It's just a media site and the main thing happening here was a specific journalist working with a specific streamer to create the bulk of the story
And one idiot pre-emptively banning the words gay and trans before she played and wondering why people got mad at her
And you have people complaining about being harassed because their community expressed moderate disappointment while this is happening <:sigh:230149462880813056>
This is the first actual harassment I've seen from Hogwarts Legacy, completely predictable reactionary BS and Twitch really needs to up their game around tools to stop hate raids. CW Transphobia

and again, that's not to say that every removal from office in China is justified, just that they actually make an effort to crack down on corruption within the party in a way that a country like India, where Modi and those closest to him are exceptionally corrupt and also just wield corruption as a blunt instrument against their opponents.
call it a purge if you want, I don't care, I support it
and the only way to deal with high level corruption is to remove and jail offenders
The main difference here is where corruption is tolerated. High level corruption is tolerated in India. Party officials are allowed to be out and out corrupt bastards up to and including the prime minister. Low level corruption is "not tolerated" in India. As in it's officially condemned but relatively little is actually done to stop it. In China a degree of low level corruption is allowed, people like police and petty officials aren't immediately cracked down on with full force. Actual party officials who are corrupt, the high level corruption is not tolerated in the same way as it is globally. I don't think either should be tolerated but high level corruption is much more dangerous.
In India the most corrupt person gets promoted to Prime Minister <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
In what world is India more transparent and less corrupt than China?
as in it's a symptom of systems
Like, corruption is just systemic full stop
Corruption is present in literally every system imaginable. All you can actually do is address it where it occurs
I think both are true. Xi isn't a good guy and he's totally purging people he doesn't like from the party, but he also removes people who are grossly corrupt. And yes, corruption is used as an excuse to remove ideological enemies, but there's also cases of very clearly corrupt politicians being removed. I'd say that both are happening.

Svoboda isn't the current party leading Ukraine
Don't get me wrong
I think Russia is shit too
https://www.cbr.com/george-lucas-vietnam-war-star-wars-inspiration/
You understand that Ukraine is a pawn for NATO and they only care about it in so far as it hurts Russia right? Which is their actual terminal goal. They've literally used all the normal machinations to ensure that a more pro Russian government was overthrown in Ukraine, installing a fascist puppet government under the Svoboda party? The west has literally also done imperialism in Ukraine recently. This is just two despots fighting over crumbs while the people suffer. Comparing this to Star Wars, a revolutionary struggle is absurd. None of that says anything about who's in the right or wrong. Just that it's a bad and forced analogy from an organisation trying to white wash their own imperialism with the one popular action they've ever been able to take.
No, it's really not. It's a very basic idea held by most socialists.
It condemns the imperialism of NATO. Which is basically NATOs entire reason for existing
Like I don't think Star Wars could ever be read as pro Ukraine war but I think there's problems with just attempting to remove it's criticisms of the US from it and use it to argue in favour of NATO, something it implicitly condemns.
It's mostly just to do with the alignment being off here.
I'd argue against that honestly. Harry Potter as a series is very in favour of general liberalism and has nothing bad to say about western governments in the same way as Star Wars.

Rather than just reading them textually it's better to look at the politics of both. Star Wars is insanely anti American while Harry Potter is actually generally pro US at any time it shows politics.
The entire original trilogy is inspired by and heavily references the Vietnam war. This isn't even a reading. Lucas has just outright said this.
No
The original trilogy was using Nazi iconography to point out the closeness of the US liberal regime to the fascist German.
The Empire was very explicitly an analogy for the US while the Rebels were an analogy for Vietnam. Posing US aligned countries as being the Rebels very clearly misses the point.
Because the Empire is based off the USA.
Perfectly normal late stage capitalism

There are also small countries *cough* Belgium that have similar issues, although not quite as bad
China and Russia both have far better urban design (although Russia often actively tries to sabotage theirs) in spite of their size. It's pretty much just that the US favours highway oriented development rather than transit oriented development. When your priority is on making sure everywhere is linked by high speed roads this is the logical outcome
It's not like it's the only example anyway
Many NATO nations did and NATO wanted to in principle. It's just that a few NATO nations actually had popular support that blocked entry into the war.
Vietnam
Minus a few nations like Australia that also run interference for the US but aren't explicitly in NATO
NATO is the US's imperialist support.
And any government coalition that contains fascists is fascist. It doesn't matter if they're a minor party. It's good that it only lasted a year? But the fact that NATO gave actual support to fascist military groups shows that they really don't care about the country.
Especially when I'm explicitly pointing out where the fucking lines are
I don't care? Calling out actual fascism where it's happened is still fine. It's not support for Russia which I also believe is a protofascist state. If people can't read between the lines then that's really not my problem
It's not, because they are still the Empire at large. This is more like the Huts picking on a smaller client state I'd suppose. But that's never in the text of Star Wars
NATO and the EU played a huge role in the 2014 Ukrainian revolution that installed a fascist puppet government in the country. This is not the current government.
But in this case it's fine
NATO has done bad in the past in Ukraine.
I said Star Wars is a shitty analogy and Ukraine is a pawn to NATO. Both of which are true. That doesn't mean what NATO is doing here is bad
When did I say that
Ukraine's value to NATO is in how much damage it can do to Russia and having states aligned with them on Russia's border.
NATO ultimately doesn't really care what happens to Ukraine. As was shown by their willingness to install a neonazi government in the country rather than the pre 2014 flawed but not actual fucking Nazis pro Russia government.
I said NATO is using them as a pawn.
Also how the fuck are you going to call this party, the one that took over in 2014 not facist.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svoboda_(political_party)
Reality is they're just a company which responds to the same pressures and systems as any other company and if they weren't doing the same degree of exploitation they wouldn't be competitive. There's no way to run an ethical business under capitalism
People will always pick a company to view as "the good one"
He shot himself three times in the back
Which doesn't mean support the war in Ukraine, but it does mean that focusing in on it is a distraction from things about your own country that you may actually have some small influence over.
especially when your country does more than any others.
I actually have a slightly different opinion on this. You can only really alter what your own country can do in so far as you can impact what any country does. Your efforts are better spent opposing the imperialism of your own country than any others.
I hope you're right on this, but the US has a really bad track record for drafting in situations where it probably shouldn't have. Or in some cases where it definitely shouldn't have.
The actual more nuanced point is that in both Russia and the US capitalism and wealth accumulation is the problem and talking about these two as states rather than the toys of oligarchs is borderline nonsensical.
I don't think I was. Russia is still by far the most problematic actor when it comes to Ukraine.
There were several who attempted to enter the war but were blocked from doing so for various reasons. As an example Heath wanted in on the war but Parliament actually blocked him
2007 was an interesting time
90% sure it's a recap
It's less to do with pace and more to do with the lack of general depth in TTGL compared to older mecha series like Eva, I don't particularly dislike TTGL but I can see why some people do.
GL can be annoying for people who like older mecha series
For GL
Kinda agree
But you're talking about the recaps aren't you?
I've seen the TV series and End of Eva
Most of the series I watch are mostly exposition, so it doesn't really bother me all that much
I liked it <:Shrug:589215630926938132>
The only good one was re:Creators
<:heh:496448769185808435>
apparently my highest and lowest rated mahou shoujo are both Symphogear
yeah, that's why
<:heh:496448769185808435>
For a while Nisekoi's second season was tagged as mahou shoujo
Haven't actually watched it yet though
Probably not exactly dark mahou shoujo
My main critique of XV is that Noble Red were ultimately pretty pointless
which is also how I view Walpurgisnacht
To me Shemha feels like she has a list of goals rather than a list of ideals, Fine could be argued to be the same but she still displays far more character throughout the series
yeah, I'd argue Walpurgisnacht and Shemha have a hell of a lot in common
Normally they're the type of villain you could replace with an event and nothing about the story would fundamentally change
calling them characters tends to be generous
Force of nature characters by definition don't have ideals
well, actually I phrased that badly, Satelight probably should have focused on her more, she's just not worth dissecting as a character because she's paper thin
she's barely a character that's worth focusing on
I tend towards just seeing Shemha as a 'force of nature' villain
out of the main villains at least
My favourite villain is still, for the most part and somewhat astonishingly Fin√©
~~alchemy was a mistake~~
It's 3pm
I'm tired
G is one of my top seasons
<a:02derp:465210481326686208>
GX
Oh
G kinda destroyed most of what I liked about the first two seasons <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:heh:496448769185808435>
take that as you may
I have watched Conception though
most of the time at least
I tend to try not to seek out bad anime though
Which were both fine still
The worst I've seen were Akanesasu Shoujo and Symphogear G
Probably selection biased as hell
I don't think I've ever actually disliked a mahou shoujo I've watched though
That was bad
The one in GX
The AXZ development arc for Chris actually works because at least they bothered to give her a reason to need to develop
well, G does too actually
It's like the only season to actually treat them as individual characters
AXZ has very specific Kirika/Shirabe focus arcs
Something that every season other than GX worked out is that characters can be antagonists without just being outright evil <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
They're antagonists
And the idea that Maria specifically is handled well by GX is probably controversial <:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
One of the things that most pisses me off about GX is the way it treats characters other than specifically Maria. Hibiki, Chris and Tsubasa all for no good reason have to deal with S1 problems again, Miku gets utterly sidelined and Shirabe and Kirika get less development than in GX and AXZ
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
It also has Beef Stroganoff no Uta, so it wastes all that anyway
It has some of the best music in the series
There's exactly one front that GX actually wins on
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
yeah, near the end of G
I think the only (probably retroactive) reference to alchemy in the first two seasons is one mention of the Bavarian Illuminati
For me that's one of the things that really broke it, after two fairly consistent seasons it just curved completely off in a new direction for no real good reason.
at least for me I find it far easier to criticise something that's actually in many ways good and has a few flaws compared to something I really dislike
Nothing changed there
Still found XV way better than GX
Na, I rewatched recently with a friend
My rating's like XV=G>OG>AXZ>all the OVAs>GX
Also, should have been like 18 eps
It just had a lot of potential that it never met
It's actually still probably my favourite season
The more I talk about XV the more people probably assume I dislike it
and yeah, it would have probably been more interesting if Shemha had just finished them, at least it would have actually been a twist
I like NR as characters, I don't like how they were written into the story
They simultaneously had less plot relevance and more interest than Shemha
I enjoyed Oreimo so I'm probably a bad judge here <:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
<:Yes:393865045005697034>
That doesn't happen
Nope
Stepsisters who met before they became stepsisters to be fair
The manga is better than the anime in general, but it's still heavily incesty <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Fair
but it has nothing on Gatari
Probably doesn't help that everyone always goes on about how Jojo's this weird memey show
You know when you watch something that just overwhelms your memory of pretty much everything else you watched around it? I think Jojo suffers from that for me because I don't think even most anime I like would come out looking that good next to Monogatari and I watched it right about when I was watching that for the first time
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I do wonder how much of it is just liking it less on reflection though since I watched it right between two of my favourite anime ever
for me at least
All of the first season, 24 eps
I couldn't get into Jojo
Keijo was fun
Already seems good to me
Nanoha has a fairly accurate O'Neill cylinder <:YuzuPonder:430875283860750347>
But for the fourth definitely
I don't have strong opinions on the first three just from the stills
It's just weird
Nisekoi still works
Ah, fair
See, I'm not sure I can agree with you here. When you look at a scene like the one I linked there isn't a lack of detail in the background, there's just a lack of objects and background characters. The actual background itself is dynamic and shifts along with the characters and perspectives, just like anything you'd generally consider a 'good' background. It's no realistic, but thats an artistic choice meant to highlight some of the way how narration is handled in the story, if it's not important to a character it doesn't exist. The cuts to black also aren't used to reduce animation, they're used to break up the standard animation within the scene. It generally cuts to text then jumps back to the same animation as before it cut to text.
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jm-xrO2c_0>
I'd say the rapid use of jump cuts and flashes to surreal character action during dialogue are more what I think of when I think of Shaft than the black cuts
5 jump cuts in a second
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Shaft ruined most anime for me, now I'm just permanently looking for things with weird and unique animation styles
||yes, but she's dead||
Almost everyone I've talked to agrees on Kizu second
Kizumonogatari can be watched in two places
The show's surrealist, you can't just take what's happening on screen at face value
I picked them up on Humble for $30 a while back
I have all the English release LNs just sitting on my PC
Kizu was meant to be released in 2011 before Nise but got delayed by 6 years
Kizu before Nise
And yes
The only show I can compare it to is one I'd be surprised if others have seen, but Kyousougiga

Sometimes it's the small things
Made me actually double take
This is a very odd thing to see as an Australian
That was fun
Oh yeah, Fragtime's Bluray came out recently
I'm still just sitting here hoping one day there'll be a Yaga Kimi fig <:yuuMakeMeCri:653303543419371540>
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
Best sister is Kirino Kousaka
It's really nice and comfy
I watched the first season of both and they're both really good
I really want to watch more Aria/Amanchu
Once I'm finished up all my uni assignments I'm thinking I'm just going to watch way more SoL anime than is healthy for me <:nadeshikocomf:590231274975657986>
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
Youtube keeps recommending me Sora Yori's soundtrack and now I want to rewatch it again
Yeah, it's one of those series that you could probably catch a ton of extra detail rewatching
I really like LotL
<a:ShamiQuake:640758495095947274>
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Only the ones who enjoy it
Man, it's not the same when the weapons speak coherent English <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
sure
I feel like I've seen that
The anime
I feel like I've seen something like that before
Can you give more detail?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I have 4 assignments to finish
One day I'll actually watch a Precure
I mean, I put almost every MHA character in trash
no questions asked
Also, if a girl appeared twice the second one went in trash
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
Yeah, probably a good call
You may now proceed to bask in my trash taste
Some characters appear twice <:scarfNANI:623655283830423572>
If I actually tried
I probably know around half though
<:AkaneWaa:506164173617758219>
Also, no Akane?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
700 characters and I can't find Chris
<a:IchiCryAnim:417086827972001792>
Someone who owns this
Go for it
Rakugo is like as far from a harem/ecchi anime as you can possibly get
Rakugo Shinjuu <:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
New Game
Yagate Kimi?
<:scarfNANI:623655283830423572>
No Madoka
for some reason
And Hachiman
in every way
and it's substantially worse
No, it's the series the studio made before Wataten
Uzamaid was a mistake
Mya Nee isn't actually as bad as the damn maid
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Jibril actually deserves to be there though
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
I'll just leave this here though <:heh:496448769185808435>
Like, Rei's decently high up for me
Yeah, that too
not there
Like Gridman having huge waifu wars stuff
Yeah, some of the exclusions are just weird
TBH I just put any popular character I don't explicitly like into that category because why not <:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Did I stutter?
<:nadeOWO:598369073943937034>
Who'd ever love a yandere TBH
<:scarfFang:519604905372286981>
Sora Yori is one of my favourite anime ever and Yuru Camp is pretty good too
I love that way too much
OK
Someone did the maths on that rotation in a relativistic frame, because relativity is fucky it's actually possible if the environment was rotating around them, but they're traveling at over 500km/h <:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>

yes
I also enjoy some of the yuri fluff though
Also, totally unbiased
Their priorities were solid
Where would you put 90% of the budget?
Last I saw it was 600 USD
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>

There's always Shinsekai Yori
Fair enough, I'm mostly in it for fluff
I don't <:nadeOWO:598369073943937034>
There's a lot of yuri trash
Surely there's better trash yuri out there though

Just a perfectly normal cute girl anime <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Tsuki ga Kirei and Yori Mori are my favourites out of that list though
Hidamari Sketch is so damn underrated
They're my recs for SoL anyway
There's two really good SoL anime airing in this season, Hamefura and Kakushigoto, Hamefura's just really good SoL romance/reverse harem and Kakushigoto's dad/daughter absurd comedy, both are pretty wholesome.

For non-seasonal stuff you could try Yori Mori, Wotakoi, K-On, Tsuki ga Kirei, Yuru Camp or Hidamari Sketch if you like the more pure SoL style. If you want something with a bit more drama Sangatsu no Lion, Clannad, Hibike Eupho and Chihayafuru are all top quality.
I'm going to hell aren't I?
Meanwhile I'm just sitting there cheering on Kirino

What kind of anime do you like Ash
I should follow and see the reaction when he realises what my picture on anilist is <:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
This season's actually good though
Ash, the key to watching lots of anime is just watching all the garbage that gets released every season
I prefer to go into anime knowing nothing
I might after the series
na
Sits and waits patiently for Adachi to Shimamura <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Yeah, but I think something about the way they make anime and the types of anime they generally make leads to very few S2s in general
New Game was the exception <:sigh:230149462880813056>
~~still waiting for Gekkan Shoujo~~
Doga Kobo very rarely does S2s
I just wish more anime would have interesting art styles in general <:sigh:230149462880813056>
maybe I'm just weird
Ehhh, I actually find reading easier than listening
HidaSketch combines two of my favourite things, cute girls and Monogatari ~~ignore that it came out before gatari~~
Amanchu is up there too
They're both CGDCT, one just leans drama and the other more SoL
K-On is a top 3 CGDCT anime for me, not sure whether I prefer Hibike or it, but Yorimori is the king of CGDCT for me
Pretty much no inbetween
My mood swings between watching anime that will break me for weeks and feel good CGDCT anime
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Oh, Show by Rock and Princess Connect too
<a:ChrisWhat:669566598247481346>
I think the only CGDCT show I really couldn't get into was Blend S
<a:ChrisBaka:670628703734333450>
Slow Start is great too
<:scarfFang:519604905372286981>
I love me CGDCT anime though
||The homosexual relationships is never stated to be pregnancy reduction, it's a conflict reduction method. It's no explicitly homosexual either, it's just much more sexual and also less monogamous in general, hence why Saki and Saturu almost end up together in their teens||
Considering the show outright states otherwise
Not sure where you're getting that from
but it has plenty of despair
Yeah

~~I didn't hate that show though~~

Yeah, you could tell Monogatari with stick figures and it would still be better than 90% of anime
I found everything other than Saitama to be the most interesting part of the show, and that's why I'm one of the 5 people on earth who actually preferred S2 to S1
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Also, to be very clear I'm not actually a huge fan of action in anime so all the animation kinda just left me cold
Saitama's ridiculously powerful but non-functional in every single way, repeat for 12 episodes
I also religiously watch MHA just to see it's slow deterioration to the bottom of the barrel <:heh:496448769185808435>
Mob's fairly good
and it never found a second joke
The joke stopped being funny by the end of the first ep
OPM put me to sleep man
Isn't Aria seinen?
I watched OPM and thought "if this is considered good Shounen I don't want to see what bad shounen is like"
*token lesbian to die at the plot's convenience
Which is a good thing
Most of the school SoL yuri of recent is fairly against the idea of growing out of it
Ura Sekai Picnic looks pretty interesting
Ahh, yes, a man of culture
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Good luck with that
Same
in general
Like, there seems to be more explicit yuri
I mean, at least recently we've got Yaga Kimi, Frag Time, Citrus, Kase San and we're getting Adachi to Shimamura
Same
Weathering with You is real good
Depends on the anime
Yeah, personal server

I actually don't hate Ver as a villain

<a:sagiriJudge:449579448245682177>

It's just really good
Yorimori
Aria good
Let's put it that way
If you want to watch a good cute girl show there's better options
not the worst thing I've ever watched, but overrated
I thought it was pretty weak cute girl anime being carried mostly on unfunny memes
I don't like it very much
<:harukaYAY:469924800509247489>
She's cute
I really like Haruka
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>

<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
Not developing the main character for two season, I'd argue three isn't good writing. It's not just a stylistic choice, it shows a lack of knowledge of how to write characters
That is just bad writing
It's 46 eps, they didn't develop the main character in 46 episodes
unpredictably S3 didn't change shit
He had 46 episodes before Index 3 even started and he was a slice of bread for that entire time
Touma has the character of a slice of bread
Touma and Index are just super annoying characters to watch
I don't rate S1/2 of Index that highly either
It's amazingly good considering it's a spinoff of Index
It's on the Nisekoi server
<a:nisekoiOhayou:562636365112803347>
well, it wasn't as bad as Conception or BnP, that's about the nicest thing I can say about it
Which is why I said I'd recommend against it
because that's really not worth even considering
*I'm assuming no Index 3
Because the main thing's a flaming dog turd and Railgun isn't?
But like, I could watch Citrus 4 times in the time it takes to watch Index and that's a far better use of my time honestly <:yuzuFailedSmug:409282356101251074>
Personally I'd advise anyone who wants to get into it to just pretend Index doesn't exist and just watch Railgun, because honestly the Index anime isn't really worth watching
Dude, actually go back through and look at the arcs of Index 1/2. They're almost all Touma arcs. So much so that both Anilist and MaL list only Touma and Index as the main characters of Index 2.
Every other story with a protagonist with amnesia finds a way <:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Is Touma
All the rest
Yes, and he's the antagonist of a single arc and the protagonist of a single arc in S2
That's not true
No
He is, for the most part the main character
He's the focus of the first 46 episodes
Nope
I have 6 10s in 320 completed anime, so one for every 50ish anime
You might find something you enjoy more later
To be fair it's only 18 anime
https://anilist.co/anime/108487/Fragtime/

Australia has a history with Madoka

It's Aus/NZ only streaming service
AnimeLab has it <a:vvAussieLurking:454378483510935562>
but then again, I'm not looking for something super specific, more just general quality
In my experience though my favourite anime have been things that I didn't expect to be great, in some cases that I wasn't even planning to watch
for the most part
The people who worked on KLK were the same people who worked on TTGL
<:Akane:467790446022885386>

Ah yes, time traveling is part of my everyday life too <:okageuse:447397489625268234>
Why do people compare them?

I've watched the toothbrush scene far too many times

BGS is just Monogatari with worse characters and far less interesting graphics

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vk86fxEklq8
At least we have this next season
Most of the villains in DBZ are laughable
It's not about having one that's better, it's about having a solid spread of villains
Yes, the villains are actually better in MHA than most shounen, at least some of them
I don't think DBZ is a great example of particularly good writing. It's popular due to primacy, it just came before better anime came out. As well as it's target demographic skewing younger and tending to have lower standards.
Yes, but playing it straight for three seasons as is the case with Touma is already far, far too long
One of my favourite characters ever, Rei from Sangatsu no Lion starts pretty stagnant, the difference is that he doesn't remain so throughout the story
I have a problem with 46 episodes worth of stagnation
I don't have a problem with periods of stagnation in characters
If you actually honestly ask that question the answer is always 'not completely correct' and that, assuming you're not a completely shit writer has to lead to character development
The reason it can work for villains is because believing yourself to be 'right' enough that you don't need to change is a pretty good trait for a villain
I'd very heavily disagree, to me it feels like an unnatural result of a much too individualistic world view. It just feels wrong to have an individual character who's actually important enough to change the world and at the same time 'right' enough that they themselves don't need to change.  Stories written like this I usually find to be power fantasies and that's just not something I consider good writing or something I'm interested in.
I still don't think it's a good way to write major villains though
Yes, developing main characters is kinda an important part of story writing
They can work as villains or minor side characters
Not a huge shounen fan generally
<@195044406343106560> I don't like any of the seasons of Dragon Ball at all so that's really not a very convincing argument to me
Probably also true
I think it would be a lot like Black Clover where it got a lot of hype but generally fell of hard and is a lot more niche than DBZ is
I doubt that honestly
Or just that I don't like that kind of writing Hana <:RengeShrug:609373443225419786>
But yeah, my basic argument is that there's ways things can get popular other than being good and DBZ is an example where it's popular because it came first rather than any real quality reasons
They look the exact fucking same at a glance
My bad
I read that DBZ as DBS
It ain't because of the first series
But you and I both know full well that DBS  is coasting of nostalgia for DBZ
It really doesnt
Mix that with nostalgia
Yes, I said it before, primacy
Because that's all they exist to do
By the way, when I say a character is a plot point I mean that you could replace them with a natural disaster and they'd still have the same effect on the story, impeding the main character
But there's literally no way for a FoN villain to actually be better than Stain for example
I don't know anything about Buu, I dropped DBZ a good while before then
A force of nature villain isn't a character, they're a plot point
I mean, Endevor is the single best character and there's a sharp drop off after him
Like I despise blank slate characters
Which I don't do and I generally consider pretty bad writing
I also enjoyed Oreimo
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
The thing is, I very rarely feel like shounen characters are particularly good. Probably because I watch a lot of character drama which is completely reliant on characters and tends towards crafting them far more carefully
<:ChrisSip:660514247935000576>
People actually care about death in DB at this point
Are thrillers meant to put you to sleep <:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
It's a lot better than Kakeguri though
Kakeguri is just bad Kaiji
Hana
I found Kakeguri to be a disaster
That's where you're wrong
The genre with DBZ, MHA ect is battle shounen
Someone described one of the upcoming ones as that and I just instantly dropped it in the skip list
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
That's why those specific traits are used
And they want to feel like they're overcoming the odds
People want to feel smart, caring and right
Those are traits typically seen in blank slates by the way
I kinda want to rewatch Kokoro Connect soon too, anime that's basically about a group of kids being tormented by a god with nothing better to do with their time
God, it's actually been years since I watched OreGairu now
Best boy
Also check out Kokoro Connect
I need to do an OreGairu rewatch before S3
SNAFU is good too
Sangatsu/Gatari are Shaft's best work IMO
Oh, and Violet Evergarden
The best I've seen are probably Sangatsu no Lion, Clannad, Monogatari, Chihayafuru, Tsuki ga Kirei, Fruits Basket and Rakugou Shinjuu
I'm going to need to get on homework soon though
<:AquaHeh:585570589201268760>
My laptops been autogrinding this whole time
I'm sad it doesnt really look like a shaft anime though
Just saying
Assault Lily's already looking fairly gay from the trailer
<:DkPepper:436268915707084800>
I did
Oh, I was scrolled up a lot
<:ChrisSip:660514247935000576>
Rhyyman I gave it a 3/10
<a:CryBabyGif:562737712428482571>

Same, it's not ruled out either
<:kirinoSmug:447398410857742346>
nice
Talk about Oreimo on Discord, Oreimo recommendations on youtube
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
It was so close to being a good ending
~~there is a VN where you can marry Kirino and have kids though~~
<:kirinoPout:499471452073099267>
Don't remind me
It would have been better if the editor didn't do that
IK
Yeah
Fite me
Best girl won though
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
So did I
I mean
People talking shit about Oreimo <:kirinoWut:466053691254767636>
Do Phos and Diamond count as girls?
but I'll order it so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Pretty sure this is going to end up as a top ~100
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Same, but I'm also too lazy to do that
Na, I'll just use tiermaker, it's 10x easier
Yeah, I don't have that kind of effort in me right now
I just read
wait
oh
yeah
Just thinking about this though, my top 5 would feel wrong no matter what order I put them in
Have you got the template you used?
I could order them but I'm way too lazy
Anilist gives more than Mal <:KaosSmileFang:444799827805601803>
also, low tier is relative, they're still better than most anime girls
Actual ordered tierlist too, at least roughly
~~also I'm using waifu very ironically here, my only waifu is Chrischan~~
This could take a while
I have a list of 137 girls who I actually like
and I expected to like it going in
Controversial opinion, I struggled to finish Gunbuster and have no intention to watch Diebuster. Gunbuster was one of my least favourite anime
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Still only down to 7/10 anime
welp, I'm over 100 now
I will literally watch any Doga Kobo anime <@!453836798796234762>
Legit though, Rakugo Shinjuu is the single most underwatched anime ever. It makes Gear look like it's overhyped
<:heh:496448769185808435>
Also, shameless "watch Rakugou Shinjuu" plug here
Actually thinking about it seriously I'd have something like Okabe, Araragi, Rei (Sangatsu), Yakumo Yuurakutei and Hachiman as the top 5
Mine's just Okabe Rintarou 20 times
"just read the manga" is not a good answer for a poor anime
with no idea what was going on
And I was just sitting there
I just remember the start of Index 3 where they just throw around Group/Item/all these random names
Pls no more Group <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:Homucide_MM:366003494513147915>
Time for Index III
Yeah, the second season is one of my favourite anime ever
I really hope Hamefura gets more adaptations <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
So based on the average pace of Index adaptations, ep 4-5?
<:scarfFang:519604905372286981>
Honestly, this looks like the fun kind of shit anime
just from seasonals
<a:oof:509138600571699200>
33 eps of catchup
Enjoy your One Piece Carlos <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
When you try to be smart and it just doesn't work
I can't see anything in that pic
I mean, we have Revue Starlight for that
<:sisterHug:450670439149076481>
I'm not in denial
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
The rest never happened
It's perfect
Oreimo's ending is great, just stop 5 minutes before the end of the last ep
<:TheLookImoutoGivesWhenYouFuckHer:538496059769618452>

So, did anyone else watch Imoimo?

it's not even close
Gravity Wall
Recreators is OK
which is rare as hell
Even all the anime original stuff is great
Everything about Hamefura is just golden
<a:KaedeNam:512392279328030720>
it never really moved on from that
but uh
In-Spectre on the other hand started very good
It's not bad, but it's just bland
Yeah, BGS does just feel like Gatari but lacking something to me
I need a S3 of that so bad
Oh, I just rewatched New Game earlier today
<:ChrisYikes:679341065878241292>
Or he's just cleaning his keyboard
Raiden's been typing a good while <a:monkaSHAKE:612783156189462538>
<:KaosPeek:446751166185865232>
easy
Tsuki ga Kirei
https://anilist.co/manga/86908/Tachibanakan-to-Lie-Angle/

https://twitter.com/air_news01/status/1274387002335457281?s=21
came completely out of nowhere and just kinda worked
I was more talking about the last ep
not at all what I expected
It was really nice
https://anilist.co/anime/112353/Nami-yo-Kiitekure/
Really good underrated character drama
Nami yo Kiitekure was so damn good but like no-one watched it <:sigh:230149462880813056>
Very aggressively gay <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I like Mary a lot too
Bakarina needs to hurry up and get together with Sophia <:ChrisPout:660514247733674021>
Just watch White Album 2 <:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
but it would have helped at least
Like, I doubt it would have worked even with more eps
<:YuuYay:611944961746796544>
Also, yay
||Uozumi starts dating Shinako around ep 10 and breaks up with her about half way through ep 12. Haru sees Uozumi and Shinako in ep 11 and leaves town to live with her parents. Immediately after breaking up with Shinako Uozumi seeks out Haru to tell her how he's always loved her and was just dating Shinako because he was "confused". They start dating after this. There's pretty much no sign this was happening, at the start of ep 12 he's head-over-heels for Shinako and by the end he's with Haru|| <@!238855496797257729> (Yesterday wo Utatte spoilers)
Yesterday wo Utatte
at all
That last ep just didn't work
The BR arc is not only the worst shit Toaru's pumped down my throat but actually amongst the worst things I've seen in anime
To be clear, Accelerator isn't particularly good, it's just that Index 3 (I'd also argue 1/2 but people seem not to agree with that <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>) is really, really bad
<https://myanimelist.net/anime/36432/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index_III>
<https://myanimelist.net/anime/38480/Toaru_Kagaku_no_Accelerator?q=acceler>
It's rated higher on both MAL and Anilist so I'd assume it's actually the majority opinion
Really?
Not that that's a huge accomplishment
I still thought it was way better than Index 3
How does Fruits Basket have a better side cast than most show's main cast <a:CryBabyGif:562737712428482571>
It's OK, most of the shows I like are niche
It do be like that
It's worth watching, trust me
I'm always surprised Pre Cure isn't picked up and dubbed for kids more honestly. Like, I know one season was but it seems like such an easy win <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:heh:496448769185808435>
I was already not expecting anything by the time WWIII rolled around
KLK isn't bad, but it's also quite a while ago. Most of their recent stuff has been overly generic and coasting on visuals with the exception being Gridman
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
I want to see Trigger do some adaptations rather than original series, cause I swear they can't write for shit
<:ichiNom:446482143766380545>
It was fun to be the Ichigo shitter in random discords
I can't remember honestly
Honestly
Zero Two gets flanderised into generic anime girl at some point
In all fairness to Franxx that series did an amazing job pulling itself apart in the last half
a lot
BNA did that
And yeah
Overly predictable to the point where I spent the entire series always knowing exactly what would come next is bad
I thought it was just very generic and entirely predictable the entire way through, the most annoying part is there were times where I thought it might actually be subverting that but it just immediately jumped right back onto it's predictable path.
Hard disagree
But no, Trigger can't do anything interesting with the sole exception of Gridman <:sigh:230149462880813056>
Like, for a second I thought BNA might actually subvert expectations ||and not cast the obvious villain as a villain||
I really don't think Trigger has a great grasp of narrative <:sigh:230149462880813056>
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
And yet I'll still watch it
Everyone else in the series just thinks about keeping Bakarina's ass too
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/215991098202521602/641099774807769089/tenor.gif
Isn't that pretty much Machikado Mazoku?
<:ChrisSip:660514247935000576>
"Everyone in anime has 'bad luck'"
Meanwhile I'm just sitting here watching cute girl crap
From what I've seen good examples of despair in Mahou Shoujo are Yuuki Yuuna and Madoka Magica
It's not despair, it's pointless edge
^
No, not really
I don't really plan to
I'm a sad git who just likes to watch tragic shit happening though so I'll take Evangalion over TTGL any day <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
And yeah, I can get why KLK would make you uncomfortable
or Trigger anime
They're not even my favourite Gainax anime
TTGL and KLK are far from my favourite anime though
Yeah, that's Gainax from 2017
https://anilist.co/anime/115087/Jinryoku-Senkan-Shiokaze-Sawakaze/
It was just all terrible
Na, they hobbled on for years
The way I've heard God of Highschool made me not want to watch it <:sigh:230149462880813056>
Just didn't work for me
I watched an episode
It's very good though
Same director
There's always Penguindrum
It's less a yuri anime and more an LSD trip with a yuri skin though
It's pretty good
https://anilist.co/anime/20827/Yuri-Kuma-Arashi/
I will always refer to Yuri Kuma as Lesbian Bear Storm, because the translated name is just too amazing
I'll take 10
https://youtu.be/_7PfIoacHjs
This looks like the most vapid, worthless cute girl shit I've ever seen.
<:MayoiDank:640352255274516496>
Ore Twintail on the other hand
and the quality was about what you'd expect
I legit only watched it because the MC was a guy who became a magical girl
~~Fruits Basket~~
Kampfer was something...
It's all ecchi
When has that ever stopped any anime character?
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
Just saying
If you're going to ship Erin with anyone it may as well be his sister
but like, why anything else?
Yimr/Historia is fine
That's Violet Evergarden for me
It's really good
yeah
<:nadeOWO:598369073943937034>
Second best Shaft anime
<:KoyoTilt:489285273625034753>
Monogatari
Pretty much
I actually love it
Pancreas is great
<:nadeOWO:598369073943937034>
Monogatari just lends itself so well to analysis
It's just Trigger's standard style over substance anime
I wasn't a huge fan
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Just give me a S3 already
It's pretty alright
I mean, I saw Scum's Wish like 2 years ago
^this anime

Honzuki no Gekokujou is Ascendance of a Bookworm
It's not
and the OP/ED are great
I actually kinda like Scum's Wish
The last ep of Honzuki hit me really hard
<:nadeYander:567670672835477505>
Only been on there a year and a half
Finally removed the oldest anime of my watching list
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I wish
so it might not get fucked
but it's not them
Gives me PA Works vibes
<:comfy:482304978858541057>
This one looks great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9RDSB7LrEI
Kinda?
Amazon here is just shit
I'm guessing you're an Aussie Boule
<:RemEhehe:438605981614735361>
Who?
at least there's Oregairu though
Most of the shows I'm watching next season are ecchi garbage
<a:aRemPeek:673145813295300608>
Re:Zero spoilers? Maybe?
<a:RemBaka:706172000258883744>
Time to binge rewatch Oregairu <:ChrisSip:660514247935000576>
<:remShit:444873255824916487>
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
It's just sometimes more shit than I'd imagine
Yeah, I know
2019 wasn't a great year for characters but there was a lot better than Senku
like Senku? Seriously?
I could say a lot of things about those choices though
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I'm correct about Rei and Yakumo too
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
So like, Rei and the 8th Yakumo are both far better than Kazuma
2016 had Rakugo Shinjuu and Sangatsu no Lion
<a:RemBaka:706172000258883744>
Someone said to me "all Ram emotes are just pallet swapped/mirrored Rem emotes" so I made that for them
<:ramShit:558904169788866580>
I have an even shittier version of that emote
I'll watch it because I love my garbage ecchi series, but yeah, it's not going to be great
but like way less funny
It's Twintails
What a line up
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Oh god, it's literally all echii trash too
<a:illyaHuh:470557500089827338>
Why does almost a half of my seasonal anime air on one day
<:OrigamiDisgust:669074941597057025>
If it makes you happy the anime seems true to the manga
<a:MariaShake:493803268850319360>
Rental Girlfriend just be like
"Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon" is a pretty good title too but I feel like most people know that one now
The best is "I‚Äôm a High School Boy and a Successful Light Novel Author, But I‚Äôm Being Strangled by a Female Classmate Who‚Äôs a Voice Actress and is Younger Than Me" Hana
That may actually end up being top of this season, so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Guess I should probably start the Great Pretender
I guess that's something
At least Houkago Teibou Nisshi and Appare-Ranman resume
it actually hurts me
It's just
I just can't watch SAO
Oregairu is carrying the entire season <:sigh:230149462880813056>
Deca-Dence seems OK, that's legit the only new anime of note to me
<:monkaW:329645513953509378>
looks like the sort of trash I'd like
I should watch that some time
Oh
What anime Hana?
<:YuuYay:611944961746796544>
It's 13 eps and it's finished
Gleipnir?
Gleipnir was such a weird mixed bag
I just like the meme more than actually thinking it though
<:remShit:444873255824916487>
https://anilist.co/anime/110349/GREAT-PRETENDER/
Great Pretender Ayamine
Just look at this <:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>
yeah, I don't think there's much difference though
You don't need to watch it at all
it's also the first scene of S2 though
There was only one new scene in the directors cut right at the end
The art style on Great Pretender is fantastic
so it's probably perfect
So am I
I mean
that anime's great
Check out Great Pretender though
It's just super cringe the whole time
I've heard there's no progression
It was literally three minutes of explaining the world>15 minutes of useless garbage
They literally explained everything in the first three minutes, that's the problem with the ep. I can get why if you were just watching without paying that much attention you'd miss it though
I don't think it was at all complex, it was just poorly done
revealed too much, too fast and far too heavy handedly
I really dislike the way Deca Dense handled its twist
Kinda cute girl adjacent
You might enjoy something like Inari Konkon too
I'd say start Hidamari Sketch before it though, because that anime is completely unique
https://anilist.co/anime/97592/Demichan-wa-Kataritai/
You've got most of the decent ones I know of on your list somewhere, the only one I'd really say you're missing is Demi-chan
yeah, cause then I can filter by tags
Anilist's stats page is such a gift, sometimes I forget that
I've watched a lot
If you have a list so I don't make 50 redundant suggestions I could probably give you some nice CGDCT anime
I'm always down for good CGDCT anime
I'll have to watch that at some point
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Like, Sangatsu, AoT, Monogatari is a fair top three, Demon Slayer, OPM and MHA is just
It's just 2015 onwards
I get it
Nevermind
Oh
Am I missing something?
What happened to FMA though?
<:MomoWhyAreYouLikeThis:642133990081560610>
That top three
Anilist has objectively the best taste, but holy hell MAL's is still a lot better than Kitsu's
but otome harem
The superhuman abilities/human experimentation part
bad science though
yes
I'm kinda OK with this
So, Koi to Producer is basically "what if Index was an otome harem"
<:nadeBooli:488678961270882325>
I'm not looking forward to having to wait for the rest of Great Pretender
but Gibiate took that as a challenge
you can drop to a certain level and not ruin it
There's degrees of bad
<a:illyaHuh:470557500089827338>
The CGI was just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckit8sN4VEs
Funniest shit I've seen recently though
Na, Gibiate's on another level
Is this a Chinese show dubbed in Japanese subbed in English
If you make an early mistake this major it makes more sense to bet on more mistakes than to bet on it being a one-off mistake
It totally can, and to me a plot twist as poor as the one in Deca-Dence shows a lack of skill when it comes to writing a plot. That's why I say I'm pretty sure it's going to shit the bed.
There's nothing that stops you having more than one well executed plot twist in a show
Drop hints that something is wrong, enough that someone who thinks about it can work it out but hold the reveal until the character works it out
But then that raises the question, why not reveal it to the viewer then
and that's not even that good of an anime
Hell, even Ga-Rei-Zero did an ep 2 plot twist that doesn't rely on this kind of infodump, it can be done
If you want to look at how you write an early plot twist there's good examples. Madoka comes to mind. It's not the idea that causes issues, it's the very poor execution.
There was no actual screen time to even consider what was happening, it just goes from the first reveal to an immediate explanation. There's no build-up, there's no payoff. This is even worse since the execution on the explanation is so weak, infodumps are by far the worst way you could possibly do a plot twist.
Just dropping a plot twist like that with no build up and no real hints towards it isn't good direction. It went from the end of ep 1 "here's the mysterious scene" to the start of ep 2 "let's fully explain that right now"
And I strongly disagree that the direction has been good
My personal take was that Fate Zero was pretty shit
the odds are very stacked against it
An anime that relied on an exposition dump as early as ep 2 is probably going to shit the bed
I like sad anime
I have no idea what this is but I like it

I get the two confused for some reason
<a:02derp:465210481326686208>
it might have been UFOtable
oh wait
Pierrot was done for tax evasion though
I have a feeling it's Toie
It's not really there fault they got put on something as aggressively average as Fire Force either
From what I've heard the conditions there were absolutely garbage
Nope, can't blame them for leaving Shaft
yep
The only thing that ever appealed to me about that anime was the animation
<:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
What anime?
I have to get around to watching the reboot movies though
Yeah, just selling Eva branded everything
somehow
They still exist
Also, Gainax really fell from grace
and yeah, plot
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
GoH is just like the least appealing anime to me
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
It's amazing how hard you can binge your favourite series, I could watch all of Monogatari in 5 days and most days I struggle to find time to watch like two eps of most anime
Also I can totally binge most non-iyashikei SoL shows
I could binge Amanchu for some reason
It works for some
It's not a show for doing that though
Yeah, I binged S1 too
<:YuuYay:611944961746796544>
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/hvlo4z/new_key_visual_for_upcoming_aria_project_titled/
IDK if anyone else has even watched this but I'm pretty excited
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
What did Shirabe even respond too
<:ChrisSip:660514247935000576>
Alice in Wonderland
I don't really care what happened to it
good job
They failed, I don't care about Goblins, I just hate the writer
The first ep disgusted me enough to drop it and never even consider watching any more of it
honestly
I prefer to forget Goblin Slayer exists
so basically anything not original
Yeah, only things good this season are returning/second cours/Re Zero/Oregairu
"mid" is a complement for this season, it's really not even that
honestly
There's 10 full length anime and I don't think any of them are even above average
I'll pass on the less self aware version of OPM considering I didn't even enjoy OPM that much
in this season it's actually near the top
In any other season it'd be a decent midtier show
Lapis is OK
I was pretty pissed off at it after ep 2 and when ep 3 just did more exposition dumps I was done
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
IDK how it managed to bore me and honestly just annoy me more than HxEros and Kanojo, Okarishimasu but it really just did
Yeah, I'm done with Deca Dence, it's not at all worth watching
Oh look, more exposition <:rooSlain:466497347099295764>
Trying to decide which new anime this season is the least terrible is painful honestly
Just not interested enough in fights to care honestly
<:heh:496448769185808435>
<:YuuYay:611944961746796544>
Just wait for Adachi to Shimamura
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXScq-Mhoew&feature=emb_title
at least
I'm just happy that next season looks solid
It wasn't good then either
Like, we've tried garbage anime floating purely on shock value before
to me it felt a lot like Elfen Lied in the way it started and I will always argue that anime is complete trash
AoT was never that blatantly disrespectful to the viewer in the way it went about it though
anything that opens that way isn't worth giving time
Useless?
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
He's genuinely trying to do what he views as the best possible thing he can in the situation, it's just that he's often misguided and his desire for self sacrifice usually isn't a positive

<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
Best girl in Lapis so far
Tsubaki is absolute trash and I love her
both
I'm interested
<:OrigamiLurk:669065893690605588>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:KEKW:627271355548827648>
I see nothing wrong with that statement
Keijo is the greatest anime of all time though
I mean, isn't that more a point for whether or not you have the emote not really mattering?
That somewhere can just be the sewer though, and yes you can moderate it but it can still just make the environment worse than before until that happens
I mean, I'm pretty sure that if you took away all the other means people will just type "fuck you"
<a:02derp:465210481326686208>
I forget what happened in anime I'm watching weekly one week ago, asking me to recall anything about anything is a bad idea
No, I just want to sit here and watch an unending stream of shitty cute girl anime <:NaruPout:455090066742575124>
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
Yeah, Oregairu S2 is great
It's one of those anime
Oh
I watched Eromanga Sensei, there's no way it can be worse right?
The writing involves fewer ass pulls than CG
Actually, PriPri's ed is up there too
It's really good
PP is just below Flip Flappers for me
basically
It's cute girl spy drama
yes
same
GX has so many problems
S3 is the low point
Why does everyone hate on the early eps of S;G, I love them <:morryjii:702315710524948490>
I normally just judge if the show has any promise at all after the first ep or two
Yeah, Gundam's just too hard to get into
Gridman was good at least
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I just want more good mecha anime
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
I love Aoi Hana
yes
Most shounen characters are so paper thin and I just can't care about them at all
I just don't really count them
Well, yeah, I watched like Pokemon/Beyblade/Yu Gi Oh when I was a kid
If I tried to get into anime with shounen there's no way I'd actually have ended up liking it
<:yuzuFailedSmug:409282356101251074>
I started with Citrus
<:nadeBooli:488678961270882325>
Just regular trash taste
<:heh:496448769185808435>
Don't have to deal with teenage trash taste
Glad I didn't get into anime till I was 20
https://tenor.com/view/berserk-guts-walk-gif-9724918
Why end a series when it can just last forever like One Piece <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
<:narumi3:454602583982735360>
Wotakoi
~~not that I've watched it yet~~
I'm pretty sure the most wholesome anime is Sweetness and Lightning
<:narumi3:454602583982735360>
Moe garbage
Sakura Trick was great
Also, yeah, trippy anime tends to be something I like
One of my favourite series but no-one seems to know it even exists
Has anyone else here seen Kyousougiga?
For me it's more just that I haven't got around to watching a lot of older anime
Like, I've watched 4 anime from before 2000 and I like a total of one of them
Should probably just tell people to go watch Legend of the Galactic Heroes to look like I've actually watched more than one anime from before 2000 <a:ChrisShift:671988771725770752>
My only boomer recommendation is like the most normie boomer rec there is <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:no:423370582734667776>
A true classic
Ah
<:pusheenpopcorn:535551454602067988>
Na, I'm here for the dumpsterfire
And I don't know why exactly
The most time I've ever committed to an anime I don't like is Index, 3 seasons in and I'll probably watch NT when it airs
It just felt really unfocused to me, like every ep was just random crap I didn't care about
I did like Eva though
One of the four I have seen
at all
Also, I didn't like Cowboy Bebop
Like I'd probably enjoy Sailor Moon and Shoujo Kakumei Utena I just have no time
<:ShirabeMad:688188118087499792>
I'm allowed to
He's my brother though
And we'll have wasted like 3 months with that
My brother really likes Bleach though, at some point he's probably going to sit me down and force me to watch all of that and I'll probably sit him down and force him to watch all of Monogatari
I don't want that
That looks pretty alright
I'm watching the Bleach spin off though
Yeah, I don't even have any 60's anime on my PTW list
It's just better when it does
yeah
but Koisuru is still the best Doga Kobo show so far this year
Which is fine, it's still good cute girls
Houkago Teibou Nisshi does not seem at all gay though
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Starlight was fairly gay too
^
Na, we're talking about fish anime
Koisuru Asteroid is probably about as gay as you're getting from Doga Kobo recently
Probably not
<:YuuYay:611944961746796544>
Having a Doga Kobo seasonal anime to watch again is nice
There's a lot of bad examples unfortunately
All the glorious modern CGI Japan can muster <:YuuYay:611944961746796544>
One of the main reasons I've never been interested in SAO really
<:kannaLick:447395805112958977>
so there's that
They also basically have an adopted daughter
as a Doga Kobo show, not a cute girl show
based on what I've heard about it though I have really high hopes for Ikebukuro West Gate Park
Just never got around to S2
I really liked S1 anyway
Yeah, started S2 when I saw there was going to be another
<:narumi3:454602583982735360>
Aria is such a chill anime
Yeah, it was a good ep
<:OrigamiBulli:696136193645215744>
Best girl always has white hair
<a:YuzuHype:411782417267949569>
<:kuroM:469874073028001812>
Kuroko's definitely being best girl right now
<:kuroM:469874073028001812>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
It's a bad day to be a Yuigahama fan
<:rooAww:419261801209790475>
IDK why but I find the more magical/fantasy eps of Aria so much weaker than the rest
weirdest way I've ever spoiled a series
I accidentally spoiled DaL for myself back in the day by googling dakimakuras though
<:tobiichiPout:556395410596298762>
Life sized Kirino would be so amazing to have just to troll with
because that exists too
and also a Kirino
I'd have a life sized Rem
If I had infinite money
Anyone got a spare 40 grand knocking around?
<:RemEhehe:438605981614735361>
I wasn't expecting any so this is good
I'm just happy to have more YuYuYu
I liked the way it ended
I loved the movie so much
<a:IchiCryAnim:417086827972001792>
Fruits Basket this week
<:Homucide_MM:366003494513147915>
Only one choice left then
In that case can we just off him?
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
<:ChrisComf:660514247754907648>
Also, I'm watching like 5 SoL series at the same time
It'd improve the series greatly
Can Touma just stay in hospital?
Could apply to both 4 and 5
Quint/Quad
It'd either be V or Q
That's what I was thinking
ye
probably
Railgun V would be the 5th
I'm there for the clusterfuck
I don't care about it at this point
I'll be honest, if Index get's good I'll probably stop watching
<:pusheenpopcorn:535551454602067988>
and it'll probably be on a similar level of dumpsterfire to 3
NT's going to happen
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
To be fair basically everything to do with Accel is too
Feels like magic just does whatever the plot demands magic must do
The magic stuff always just felt like endless asspulls
<:narumiPeek:454548276272955392>
Still needs a season 2 though
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-08-04/wotakoi-love-is-hard-for-otaku-manga-gets-new-anime-episode/.162578
This is a good start
<a:SandyPanic:589215632772431893>
I'm actually a little worried about Assault Lily just because it looks too normal
Legit just any Shaft anime
I don't think I've ever watched one of their anime and fully understood what the hell was happening after ep 1
It's Shaft
so there's like 0 chance I'll start Index honestly
I haven't even started the Monogatari LNs and that's my favourite series and I have it on my hard drive because of Humble
I don't care enough to
No
<:no:423370582734667776>
<:ChrisYikes:679341065878241292>
Self insert crap is so annoying
JC's just had a lot of quality problems recently
but that still doesn't make NT likely to be good IMO
They said they did
They did
I mean
I'd describe it as 'aggressively average'
I feel pretty poorly about Danmachi too <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:ChrisSmug:729358768663429141>
If you don't agree with my ship you're objectively wrong
I'm not sure honestly
Also, this subtitle is not OK
unintentional comedy of the year
and how they play it out so straight faced
I love the shitty conspiracy though
It's in that "a human actually made this" camp of anime
but it's just actually hilarious
I'm not sure why
Koi to Producer is really hitting those good-bad notes for me
but taking time and not rushing it is for the best
I'd be more bothered if next season was weak
Not exactly unexpected
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-08-05/beastars-anime-season-2-premieres-in-january-2021/.162604
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
I need to watch more KyoAni anime honestly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlRGimDvgNE
<a:CryBabyGif:562737712428482571>
but not because of Nostalgia, just because I tend to cry when watching anime a lot an they hit hard
I have an OP and a couple of EDs that do that to me every time
<a:TohruSway:618263473775706132>
https://twitter.com/YonkouProd/status/1292094191716073472
Have some good news too
Also Assault Lily
Yes
less serious and more comedy
I liked it
That Railgun ep though <:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
IDK why exactly
I do have a bit of a thing where I struggle to watch most older cute girl anime though
<:ChrisSip:660514247935000576>
then just keep watching anyway
I love when you watch a CGDCTs show and you're just like "I've seen this exact same show at least 5 times now"
Weirdly enough I think of Keijo more as a dumb ecchi anime than a sport anime
unless you count Sangatsu no Lion
Chihayafuru is like the only sports anime I actually enjoyed
<:ManOfCulture:609373441530920974>
Subbers had fun with this one I see
no cats though I don't think
More or less
yes
Uhhh
<a:BanaNice:501549702383140865>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gteAyeBKGfU&feature=youtu.be
I prefer the manga where Vladimir Putin goes to a fantasy world to ride on fantasy creatures <:YuuYay:611944961746796544>
because there's two now
The other one though
Centaur bondage
like uhhh
and some really weird shit's happening
and you just look over
You know when you're multitasking chatting and watching anime
<:kirinoSmile:450654058982670343>
I've had a thing for anime girls with fangs since I watched Oreimo though
Most people's canines are their longest teeth
So do I
It's called a canine
^
Senpai is basically just Uzaki with longer hair and smaller eyes too
Flesh fangs can be done well
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
She doesn't just not look like a child, she doesn't look like a human
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Short girls don't exist
I like Uzaki Chan too
Kanon 2002 though
I think
Yeah, it was like 2006
And a really shit one
It also has a really good anime adaptation
<:ichi4Baka:492165380387766282>
<:Ichipout:442479142697566208>
Don't sleep on Kanon
That was pretty much a guarantee
Yuuki Yuuna
I honestly need to rewatch Penguindrum and see if I can work out what the fuck's happening the second time
What the hat is or isn't is very open to interpretation
Also, Penguindrum has the single best henshin in anime, change my mind
Yuri Kuma, Penguindrum and Sarazanmai are all so damn good
and I love it
Yuri Kuma was just weird in general
It was ep 9
Oh
as a Monogatari fan
one of the weirdest eps I've ever seen in anime
One of my favourite series just because of like ep 7 or 8
<:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY_7FYuebsY
Just going to drop this insanity here too
Yeah, it was solid
I basically just like creative usage of colour in OPs I think
mob has nice OPs too
Noragami S3 pls
They are both Bones
Both so good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWCnKoEgfP0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZenmeRytEM
My gold standard for OPs is Noragami though
I think Darling in the FRANXX's OP was pretty similar to that
I got way too invested into Kanon's characters
<:makotoNom:504247008928858114>
Considering I love the other two Key/KyoAni adaptations
I should really watch Air
<:foomflatline:625804767834406933>
I've never actually been able to play through a whole VN bit the Clannad and Kanon anime's killed me
<:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
https://twitter.com/AIR_News01/status/1293326357372362753
Anyone else going to be watching cute ripped sports girls
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I just don't understand the appeal of SAO and similar shows at all
<:Kaiki:325760553794666496>
By far my favourite antagonist is Kaiki Deishuu
Also, it is possible to have bad guys with motivations other than just being evil
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5LLhoKfI1E
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
I just like analysing media and there's a lot to analyse
Especially when pure gameplay mechanics like leveling are bought up and explored. Those things aren't remotely fun to watch. They're fun to strategize, optimise and play but they fail in providing an entertaining viewing experience.
Like video games have the structures they have due to their intractability, movies, anime, TV shows ect. have the structures they have due to their lack of interactivity. Porting over a video game's structure into non-interactive media just generally makes for a bad story that isn't interesting to watch.
and also video games in visual media are generally not interesting
For me it's just the whole "power fantasy" element that I have no interest in
The K-On server doesn't let me use emotes externally anymore and I'm sad
Pretty much every song from that anime's a jam
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlwRarjCh_U
Other anime OST I just put on from time to time is ID: Invaded
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
It's very good
||Shinsekai Yori||
I'll just spoiler the damn series and if you've seen it you'll know what I'm talking about
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
My other favourite antagonist is one where I can't even mention the series because even knowing it has an antagonist is a spoiler
Antagonist literally just means 'a character who challenges the protagonist'
Also, as an antagonist motivation money is actually a really, really strong choice
The thing I love about him though is ||that after he's played up to be such a pure evil villain in Nisemonogatari he just shows up again later in the series in a doughnut shop being completely normal and chats with Araragi and really isn't actually that bad of a guy||
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwWMaReMUio&
It's so damn good
Same
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
It's good to have Frenda back
<:mikoThink:469874115235282964>
I just want more Bust Upper
I just have a huge soft spot for it
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
please
It baited it so fucking hard
I really want a S2 for Spyce
^also next to Symphogear this was one of the most fun anime to watch seasonally and read the weekly reddit threads of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcg3hQS8-0A
It's just so absurd and so good
Release the Spyce also
<a:kyoukoPls:582159385967591430>
So a year and a half ago
Yeah, it was Winter 2018
I think
It looks more like a cute girl anime with idol elements
It's actually more like a full drama where all the characters are cute girls than a K-On/New Game style cute girl show though
Two years ago now
It's Antarctica
but is really unorthodox
which is the best cute girl anime ever
There's also Sora Yori
mostly because it actually has an interesting plot as a backbone
New Game is very bingable compared to most
<:ababa:477838560989544448>
K-On, Comic Girls and New Game are great jumping on points
<:comfy:482304978858541057>
Need to learn how to turn your brain off and just enjoy cute and comfy
<:kirinoSmile:450654058982670343>
Sister route was best route
Should have just went the whole way
Agreed
<:kirinoTaunt:450305320242249729>
personally I'm not such a fan
So if you like that it'll be high quality
Also there's Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka?
Can't tell yet since it hasn't released, but it looks high quality
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
There's so much cute girl anime next season
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5P1-NA6HMM
<@!171395487247630336>
<a:miowink:424741626259308556>
Mio is best girl
for some reason
I can now
<a:mio_role:564608821096349697>
<:ToukoHug:457901713039556623>
<a:yuihey:424724001638580225>
and yes, New Game+ was a missed opportunity
It's such a dumb naming convention
No, just went with the anime tradition of adding an extra punctuation mark
no middle ground
It either has to be all pointless fluff or all hard drama
and pointless fluff is like half of what I look for in anime
I can understand why you'd dislike it if it's not what you're looking for though
But like, it was one of the best fluff shows
<:comfy:482304978858541057>
<:ShirabePlease:724034356192215081>
Give more Wotakoi anime
That's the best part
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Every time I see a ping on the Yaga Kimi server I get my hopes up just to have them immediately dashed
I second Mars of Destruction
It is a good way to rewatch the series though
Because this is a damn mess
Which is why I did it
I actually did chronological though
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
I did for Gatari rewatch
None of the days are even over 10 hours
It's fine
<:monkaTired:582156650769678336>
Remember, you can actually watch all of Monogatari in 5 days
Watch Magia Record and Sangatsu
<:Doubt:696037552716775524>
And sentient demon ferrets
Kyubei
||It's possible that she pulled time bullshit again in order to manipulate the world to be the way she wanted and settled on manipulating Kyubei as the best option||
#homuradidnothingwrong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwiuX2OAvJg
Thanks for reminding me this exists
||Records happens in one of the alt timelines where Homura can't save Madoka, so I don't think it's going to tie in||
One of which was the spinoff, the other is assumed to be a sequel movie
There was a thing a while back which said Shaft were working on two Madoka projects
I have a lewd Homura mousepad so obviously I'm in no way biased
<a:HomuJuice_MM:689145115801157727>
<:nadeOWO:598369073943937034>
are all just insanely good
Like Violet Evergarden, Clannad Afterstory and Kanon
I wouldn't even call Hibike S2 their best TV anime though
Liz is legit better than Hibike
The CGDCT show is still K-On
<:KaosSmileFang:444799827805601803>

There's so much I need to get around to watching
I like Oreimo's OP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeGw8-KwxM4
Na, it's objectively this
<a:sagiriJudge:449579448245682177>

David Pro pumps out some shit actually
which sums up David in general pretty well for me
to be fair it's actually visually pretty solid, I just hate everything else about it
so...
David Productions made Fire Force
I have feelings about Trigger
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Actually, Doga Kobo is very consistent too
Every other studio has some level of inconsistency
List of anime studios that consistently push out good work
-Kyoto Animation
They gave us... that
Yes they did
WF's strategy is basically to buy huge licences and make passable anime. They're far from the best studio, they're not the worst, but they mostly get by on the size of their LPs and passable work.
They're just passable
Neither are artistically good though
It's like, completely passable but unmemorable in terms of art
S;G isn't that great from an art perspective
yeah
Wit
(Great Pretender BTW)
but it just looks better
Same highly saturated colours
To me this is pretty close to the perfection of a NGNL artstyle by a better studio than Madhouse (they're not that good, fight me)
That's literally all it has going for it
NGNL has a very nice art style
I'd disagree with that
Including visuals I think this is my number one

<:karenLove:567655915961188362>
Top 10 OPs, 8 of which are Gatari
So that isn't an issue for me
I can hear the boob bounce in Isekai Maou
yeah, that's why Kokoro Connect's bad, it's just hyper generic as an OP
Danmachi OP 1's easy
you can't fucking learn it
so the 1/100 times it does
The worst thing about Kokoro Connect is that it never plays
Fuck Kokoro Connect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mKf0_8gDVY
This is the worst
Missing songs you've watched in AMQ sucks
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
so even if I watched to that point I wouldn't have known
I quite often tab out during ops/eds and just listen
Hanebado is a bit of a clusterfuck at times
Sayonara Bystander probably wins out when it comes to emotion for me though
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
I love both
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKjbF2a90Fo
This is up there
It probably does
CR has it listed as Goya wa Machiawase
I just don't think that's the name of a Noragami OP
>Testament over Synchrogazer
Noragami's OPs are very close though
Second/Owari are actually crazy good
It gets better
I'd have it in like top 20 along with Plat Disco and Renai Circ
yeah, because it's just not quite there
<:karenLove:567655915961188362>
That's the best part
and the music's normally well up there
In a less wholistic, more just music sense there'd be less Gatari, but in terms of animation they're some of the best
It's really not, Gatari's OPs are just amazing
Gatari changes protags a lot
also just to warn what that spoiler is without giving away the character
||<:Kaiki:325760553794666496> ||
there's a fair bit of media that does this
so to switch protag you just switch which character you're following
It's just who's being followed
My top 10 OPs in no real order
Nisemonogatari: Marshmellow Justice
Nisemonogatari: Platinum Disco
Monogatari Second: Mousou Express
Owarimonogatari: Mathemagics
Owarimonogatari: Dark Cherry Mystery
Owarimonogatari: Y≈´dachi H≈çteishiki 
Noragami: Goya wa Machiawase
Noragami Aragoto: Kyouran Hey Kids
ID: INVADED: Mr. Fixer
Sangatsu no Lion: Sayonara Bystander
My main objective in life is to remind people that ImoImo existed
Also, animation can get so bad it's a selling point
at least
there's like 3 trash
but for every good one
I know
It's just now we have shitty looking CGI anime
Aria the Animation is 2000's and it looks fucking amazing
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Like, I don't judge a series based on its fans
Only thing I know about Fairy Tail is that there's some alright hentai
I feel like this image is just the perfect description
They took a break from Dragon Ball to make something unexpectedly good
Kyousougiga
Yeah
Best girl is Yui though
That's not really a spoiler <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Oregairu's author just using best girl as a punching bag this season
<a:02puke:465210481208983562>
It's so greasy
Just looking at KFC makes me feel sick
Bakarina is Hamefura
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
KanoKari causing extreme anxiety again
Really feels like the gap between ecchi and hentai has gotten a lot smaller recently
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
I saw Gigguk's video about it
it was pretty great
I've watched the series
yep
<:pusheenpopcorn:535551454602067988>
DomexKano next Hana
IIRC S1 did pretty well too
It's not Doga Kobo, so that drastically increases the odds
Comic Girls might
<:ababa:477838560989544448>
<:KaosSmile:444571001083396107>
well, I might try and get it less blurry
I'm using this screencap
Peter Grill is pretty much just hentai
Like, there's been a fair few this year
<:kirinoPout:499471452073099267>

<:WhenDessGetsAtYou:738421651393216534>
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
the 3rd movie has one of the best animated fight scenes I've ever seen and that's not even Gatari's best attribute really
But also like, Kizu specifically is just really good
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
Kizumonogatari is amazing



Oh, we Nendo posting?

https://kagerouproject.fandom.com/wiki/Mekakucity_Reload_(anime)#cite_note-5
since 2016
Like, Madoka, Gatari, Sangatsu, Nisekoi, Kubikiri Cycle and the Mekakucity sequel that apparently is being worked on
Shaft probably hold the record for the most things I want sequels to
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I really want a S3 of Sangatsu
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
I mean, I don't remember that much from either
Oh
I vaguely remember seeing them
The darkside people at the end of the last ep
Legit can't remember shit from Index 3 <:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Who were these characters in Railgun again?
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I just have seasonal anime for that
WTF I want to watch this now
Fruits Basket has the best reaction faces
cringe as all hell
And Rental Girlfriend's back to its natural state
<:ichiLove:445015476666368002>
but, Inaba best girl
It gets better
<a:sagiriJoy:448439342784970752>
I rather enjoy trash anime
https://anilist.co/anime/112818/Dokyuu-Hentai-HxEros/

This is the first time in a while I've actually laughed at this joke
so it just works for me
I love anime that make me feel sad
Ayame's ability to destroy any scene he's in is just amazing
<:nadeBooli:488678961270882325>
They all have a ton of depth
All of the characters from Kokoro are fantastic
Kokoro Connect is great too
It's really good
The first season was my favourite anime of last year
Yeah, it really is

Well written SoL generally does still have progress
I loved that ep
She's like the exact same character
Yeah
<:noContract_MM:586871023949971456>
<:KyuContract_MM:406514222717992961>

Yeah
Monster Musume no Oisha-san
This is exactly what I needed
ah yes, thank you Japan
It's very good

Probably helps that football is one of the two sports I actually like
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/iln2zo/key_visuals_for_farewell_my_dear_cramer_anime/
IDK why but this actually looks kinda interesting, even though I normally can't stand sports anime
<:YuzuPonder:430875283860750347>

<:KirikaWow:741181236181205013>
9 eps in and they finally show the costumes from the PV for the first time
This is an unexpected twist on the beach ep
Oh no
Deca-dence was completely unwatchable for me
The only other anime I even feel are close are Fruits Basket and Oregairu
To me the second season of Re:Zero is easily the best thing airing right now
He's a much more likable character even by the end of S1
Yeah, that's his lowest point
but later in the series it's clear that he's actually not that kind of character
sure
Like, if you drop a few eps in
Subaru isn't really unlikable though
He's just super cringy
ye
Kazuya just isn't the right type of horrible
I can watch that shit all day
Like Hanabi Yasuraoka
I'm down for horrible MCs though
This isn't it
but like
I actually love crap melodrama
<a:MariaShake:493803268850319360>
not this
I just wanted a dumpsterfire
I was hoping this would be like Domestic GF
I'm 9 eps in, may as well finish it now
IDK why but it's actually the most anxiety inducing show I've ever watched
The only way for me to watch this is to have my thumb perma over the spacebar so I can pause to actually breathe
IDK why I'm still watching Rental GF, it legit hurts
it was really bad
Yeah, the 'science' in that ep was making me cringe
<:02blush:450291647453069313>
<a:kirinoWoa:473310409072312331>
Imouto is a viable route
I'm very much on team Yui
beats me chief
As for why people like that
I think that's an intentional part of her character
3rd is completely new
For me my top 4 are all sequels and my 5th is like, Appare Ran-man or Lapis, which are both well below average anime
It's like that for a reason
damn, this ep of Lapis is absolute gold
||Breaking the cycle didn't inherently mean sacrificing yourself. There were a lot of ways you could use the power of the Princeps Mage to break the cycle. That's the path Shingetsu chose herself and had been pursuing since before Granbelm. It's very strongly hinted that she wasn't the first person Magiaconatus chose to break the cycle too, she's just the first to not fail. There's also an interpretation of the ending that states that Mangetsu was actually a test to create an attachment to magic as well, and one that Shingetsu actually failed. It's very clearly hinted at that Mangetsu is alive at the end and more subtlety hinted at that Shingetsu didn't fully follow through on her wish.|| This is also why it's a good ending by the way, it's directed well enough that it works as an ambiguous ending if you actually pay attention and read between the lines.
I think that's an abject misreading of the ending 

||Throughout the entire story Shingetsu makes it very clear that her goal is to eliminate magic. This isn't something that she's being driven to by a 3rd party, it's literally her core goal throughout the entire series. Magiaconatus warns her of what will happen, it doesn't force her to make that choice. Also, Magiaconatus is simply seeking out someone who can change the system, it doesn't actually care how. It just ultimately doesn't care if Shingetsu sacrifices herself or not as long as she breaks Granbelm. I think saying "this is what was fated to happen" when Granbelm is explicitly called a cycle that has repeated for thousands of years is fairly absurd. It's just another cycle, it's just the first one that Suishou lost. Magiaconatus offers her the role of Princeps Mage, which she uses to destroy magic. She didn't have to. She could have used that power to bring back Mangetsu, Kuon and Anna and undo the damage done by Granbelm but that isn't her choice. That's the point of the ending||
I was glad that it wasn't a "everyone's happy in the end" type of ending
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I really liked the end of Granbelm
It gets more shit than it deserves just because it's in the shadow of the OG series
I'd say so
There's also the spinoff series
The first two are recaps
The 3rd movie is a sequel
Whereas something like Flip Flappers would be in the middle biased towards a lighter theme
I'd say the middle is fine, but it's still more biased towards a darker theme
It feels more in the line of Revolutionary Girl, Princess Tutu and Madoka to me than the sort of Sailor Moon and Precure lighter group
I'd generally consider Nanoha to be dark magical girl anime since it actually does deal with darker themes throughout unlike your Precure/Sailor Moon in which those eps are more of an exception.
Yeah but were talking post Madoka
It's not on par with Madoka but it's really not bad
I'd also mention Granbelm in terms of good dark magical girl
>Madoka was the only show to do dark magical girl right

Excuse me, Yuuki Yuuna exists?
but I just don't get it
It's just weird since it's a well regarded show in a genre I'd normally like
It felt like it was trying to be a comedy
Welp, that was a show that I logically should have really liked but just didn't
<:kurisuPout:447396031945244672>
9 eps in
TFW the first time I've laughed at Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka? was because Coco said "Cristinnaa" like Okabe and I just found it kinda amusing
It's the rare anime I actually find funny
<:narumi3:454602583982735360>
Zetsubou Sensei's pretty good though
Why is Taiga like this
Miru Tights is better than most hentai
Miru Tights is the most cultured anime I've ever watched
Everyone else is horny, Souji's just a fan of twintails
https://www.reddit.com/r/thingshomuradidwrong/
They fixed that up on the Bluray at least
Most of their stuff is pretty fantastic
<:KaosSmileFang:444799827805601803>
It's great
Imagine a cross between Kakushigoto and Monogatari
Same original creator
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
Also, that description
https://anilist.co/character/3385/Kiri-Komori
I relate to this character just a little too much
<:comfy:482304978858541057>
You know when you look at an image and can instantly tell who best girl is
technically
Chihayafuru is probably the only sports anime I've really liked

Bunny Girl Senpai
well, most of Haruhi
Like, Haruhi, Monogatari, ReZero and BGS are all really good, but they also have a lot of similarities
I think every LN adaptation I've liked has been fairly slow and talky though
i just tend to steer clear of most isekai
<:nadeOWO:598369073943937034>
There are some really good LN adaptations
The fuck were you expecting from a show called "Isekai Cheat Magician"
Quality story writing
||UA Academy imposter|| acted like it was some big, important thing then just forgot about it
Remember that time MHA showed off Chekov's gun in plain sight, hung it on a wall, forgot about it and hasn't fired it despite it existing for several seasons?
That's a rather low bar
To be fair, Gigguk is consistently a fan of pretty much every shitty shounen, so I'm pretty sure he did legit just like KNY
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I just thought Demon Slayer was all style no substance
ye
<:chrisDelete:616150739701596169>
At least in so far as he takes himself more seriously than most I've seen
Glass Reflection does, but to be fair he's super analytical and actually tends to have smart takes
It's a good theory, but it's not really well supported by the text
It was actually trying to be exactly average in every way, I swear
Danmachi S1 was the most aggressively average anime I've ever watched
Honestly, no
I could already tell at that point it was going to be boring AF
Ep 1 of S2 of Danmachi I couldn't even finish
Index 3 probably would have benefited by cutting entire arcs for example
Cutting the wrong things out or trying to cram everything in normally does
Cutting things out doesn't make a bad adaptation
Re:Zero and Oregairu
It's not the sources fault, it's just a crap adaptation
There's two good LN anime airing right now
There's a very high chance
I love me some trash
I've said this before, but if NT is good I'm actually dropping it. I'm only watching for the dumpsterfire at this point and I'm just so disconnected from Index's plot and most of the characters that a good Index anime would straight not be worth watching.
Index legally cannot be good
Railgun's pretty good
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
Like half the anime releasing this year got delayed though
don't think it's getting delayed
It has a date now
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
and it's even got Lily in it's name
So that's something to look forward to
First new Shaft IP since 2016 too
Majo no Tabitabi looks like exactly what I want
looks like there's some good stuff
God, I'm really excited for next season
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Uhhh, what's happening here
<a:ChrisWhat:669566598247481346>
They're listed as a studio for it
Sarazanmai was mostly good because of Kunihiko Ikuhara though
meh
but other than that
Sarazanmai was pretty good
I'm not a huge fan of most of Mappa's stuff
I thought it looked interesting
I just watched the first two eps and was bored shitless the whole time
To me it was trying to do the same thing as PriCon but was actually funny
but yeah, the end of the series felt really strong to me ||even if it did S2/play the gacha bait really hard||
Oh, you wouldn't have seen that yet
God, the break in scene just killed me
I really liked the last 4 or so eps
<:YuuYay:611944961746796544>
surprisingly good show
Speaking of princesses, Lapis was actually way better than it had any right to be
If they're actual characters rather than just T&A
3 member harems have their place too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhXoCmdIar4&feature=emb_title
God bless Doga Kobo only knowing how to do one thing
The world isn't ending

Doga Kobo's still doing a cute girl anime next season too
100%
West Gate is worth a watch to me
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I believe
Noragami S3
Bones is still doing a lot of good shit
Just going to throw this out there too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5LLhoKfI1E&feature=emb_title
They also did Mob Psycho
I kinda hate it, but yes, they did
Oregairu <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
Welp, time to hop back on best girl suffering simulator 2020
I saw that and was immediately completely disinterested
I'm pretty fine with Ikuhara having complete control over his shit honestly
I really didn't like ToG at all personally. I watched one ep and could tell I was going to absolutely hate it
Violet Evergarden definitely had substance
better percentage hits
Like, fewer misses
To be fair though, I think Netflix has actually had more success in funding decent shows
and laughed
I legit just watched the OP
And the meme
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckit8sN4VEs
In/Spectre as well
Oh
I can't remember honestly
were there others?
ToG and GoH I think so far
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37i6fuajt4
This is super interesting
Although, to be fair there's a lot of crap on that list too
I think it's mostly this whole CR original thing that's produced some subpar anime rather than when they've been involved
yeah
<:monkaS:353107394873524236>
Peter Grill
So, the only series over 27 eps on my list is Pokemon
My anilist profile is the biggest meme and my average score being 69 just makes it worse TBH
Naruto skews your time watched so much
I generally don't really like harem that much
<:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
I was thinking about checking out Golden Kamuy before the next season airs, does anyone here have opinions on it
Because it's infuriating
like, it has to happen at some point right?
I wonder if anyone will ever actually adapt Girl Friends
Hey man, one of the most important and influential yuru manga didn't even get adapted, it could be worse
https://anilist.co/anime/100762/Tachibanakan-to-Lie-Angle/
This one right?
I want more yuri harem shows
<a:02derp:465210481326686208>
That's the genre I was looking for
Romance
Oh
I think Urara leans more into comedy while Inari is more drama/SoL
I think they're quite similar
It's what you get when you cross Aria with Noragami
It's super wholesome
Inari Kon Kon actually has yuri kinda
Watch Inari Kon Kon
Watch that one it's better
I'm thinking Martian Venice
Are we talking about the same one?
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
<:kirinoLUL:475865268736884737>
like 5 minutes
yeah
I played Crossing Void for exactly long enough to get Kirino
They're just fucking Gatari
Like, look at my four top harems, they're not even really harems
I mean, I'm too tired to read a full review right now but I'll just say that subtlety isn't inherently good and a lack thereof isn't inherently bad
You evoked this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLA1fMBCRsI
I think I'd prefer less loli fanservice
<:BayonetHug:745998190339424337>
<:PeachJam:744006453127413831>
Imagine your only personality trait is being obsessed with Maria of all people
There's like, one Serena stan and that's it
No, XDU players still don't care about Serena
Yes, her 3 voice lines are so disappointed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B4lvRueoEY
Have you not seen Yuru Yuri?
Second from bottom left is best siscon older sister pictured with imouto's pantsu
I know first 3, first on 2nd row, first on 3rd row, first and last on 4th row and third and last on last row
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
https://openings.moe/?video=Opening2-GoldenTime
<:uguu:616501273520373760>
I know 9 at least
Just flash that up as single frame paragraphs on a black background
Now just need to wait for subs
<a:YuzuHype:411782417267949569>
I was like that last night
Yeah, I get that
<@!677334713970720769> Since I'm not half asleep now I wrote a response detailing why I disagree with your review on YLiA. It's in a pastebin because shit's 1000 words long.

So it would seem
<:comfy:482304978858541057>
https://twitter.com/horimiya_anime/status/1308024428467564546
I'm down for this
Who used the monkeys paw when asking for more CGDCTs sequels
you what?
Wait
it is
yeah
Why are people like this?
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Oh
KyoAni too?
How so?
yep
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
The worst part is, this is actually the second anime about this I've seen
That's all
Guy trying to get girls to expose themselves to him
So do I but I'm still going to end up watching it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVJyfPnUac0&feature=youtu.be
<:monkaHmm:582157235736805389>
Can we meme template this
I don't really have a lot ATM, I haven't really had a chance to think about it yet sorry
<a:ChrisShift:671988771725770752>
You must know some pretty artistically proficient 5th graders
This anime is so pretty <:KirikaWow:741181236181205013>
See, Monogatari and Kubikiri Cycle
Good shows have broke that rule before
Show don't tell is a guideline, not an orthodoxy
Crown Handler is one of the hypest things for me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re0okA0NAEc&feature=youtu.be
yeah, IIRC it's one of the first anime airing next season
Miru Tights is my religion
It's a really good ending, it's just Oregairu trying it would have been crazy ballsy
ye
I honestly prefer the WA2 ending to this
<:MomoWhyAreYouLikeThis:642133990081560610>
Whatever you say Millh, she's still better than the other girl though
not that it wasn't obvious from ep 1
Or you know, eventually someone will make a love triangle ||Where the best girl doesn't fucking lose for once|| <Oregairu spoilers I guess
Someone's gonna do that eventually right?
I was just watching the last ep of Oregairu and thinking "I would have actually preferred the meme yuri ending to this"
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
I just described Netsuzu Trap didn't I?
Oh wait
<:narumi3:454602583982735360>
It should
Does that even exist?
Does anyone know an anime with a love triangle where the girls both dump the guy and go out with each other?
I'm interested
<:TsubasaHmmm:445183094421454848>
I guess they released an early version of the trailer or something
<:kirinoThink:462470988186124308>
It got taken down
Assault Lily looks really good but dear lord that sound mixing
I can actually finally say why the last season of Oregairu feels so off to me. It's way too by the numbers. At no point were they willing to do anything unexpected. Anyone with a brain could have pieced together what the major character arcs would have been at the end of S2.
Yeah, from what I've read they picked the right point to end it on
<:KaosSmileFang:444799827805601803>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQaNRPyZau8
They fixed the audio
No
yeah, it kinda does
<:ichiSmile:447684583543144448>
That's my favourite horror anime
Have you seen Shinsekai Yori?
Golden Kamuy is a very interesting series. I don't think it's good per say but I've never seen anything else like it.
I just want my Gear spinoff that's 12 eps of Hibiki and Miku being gay <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Oh no
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/izn5lw/rentagirlfriend_gets_a_season_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
Truly the optimal ending to any ecchi (HxEros)
scroll up?
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
I legit posted that earlier
No, JC staff don't
Why though, they don't have a great track record
They're a big studio with multiple teams
https://streamable.com/afs8za
Looks like Fridays are going to be very gay
<:YuzuPonder:430875283860750347>
Assault Lily and Adachi to Shimamura are going to be airing on the same day
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
It's still not up on Funi
Just going to leave this shot from the ED here, spoiler tagged just because but it's not really a spoiler
It's up
Yeah
Oh god, the ED
Bless Shaft
Assault Lily's gayer than I expected
and yet it was kinda decent
MonMu no Oisha had no right to be anything other than complete garbage
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
This has to be one of my new favourite zero context pics
Like, shouldn't it be centred?
Something about cyclopes with a single offset eyebrow just looks so wrong
<:ChrisPout:660514247733674021>
I don't want more delays, I want my yuribait
<:misatoGun:447397371656011796>
There has been for a while
Yeah, there's something off about Otto
ye
<:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>
I don't understand why Uzaki wasn't a short
god, finishing my anime this season is a grind
It's a good anime though
Same
Yes
I was impressed with the other two anime today, so that's not too bad anyway
Still going to give it a shot though
<a:kanadedontfeelgood:706544690635472939>
Oof, I likely won't enjoy it much then
but that doesn't sound great
Haven't had a chance to watch yet
It's as subtle as a vasectomy via apache helicopter
I love how subtle Shaft's being about this
Also, the main characters are literally called Yuyu and Riri
It was good <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
<:MayoiOK:325758983413563412>
The ED was just
Kinda has a Revue Starlight vibe to me
he's pretty sus
I don't trust Otto though
also, yeah, looking forward to more Re:Zero
And Burn the Witch later today
Two anime down and I'm enjoying this season so far <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Yeah, I can understand why she'd feel that way
Yes
<:KaosSmileFang:444799827805601803>
>focusing on thighs

Cut your review down to the important parts
Also, the ED was so subtle I couldn't even work out what they were trying to show <@!213645184125239317>
No
had a lot of potential
shame
Probably the worst climax I've seen to a short series too
Burn the Witch
God, I thought I was going to like her from the PVs but I just can't stand Nina at all as a protag
It's not that huge of a deal though
<:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
I didn't even watch Funi, I'm pretty sure mine was Norwegian or some shit
I thought the title was weird but other than that didn't even really notice
I think I saw the top one
I guess that's where we're going then
The ED though. When I was watching the show I was like "this is actually a little gayer than I thought it would be", when the ED came on I was just like <:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
Both Higurashi and Assault Lily ended up being better than I expected <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Kinda reminds me of both Gear and Revue Starlight though
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Majo no Tabitai is really good stuff
<:heh:496448769185808435>
Not like Shaft to do multiple different OPs/EDs for their shows anyway
The ED was fine I'm pre sure
That's the OP
It's like, no, she's not, she's an asshat
Nina just pissed me off start to finish then the anime's basically just like "she's right you know"
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
Also Ash you were pretty right about Burn the Witch not sticking the landing
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
which implies at least a V2
The best part is it's listed on youtube as V1
People are saying Majo no Tabitai is solid too
Like, this season's looking pretty solid so far
It looked like that to me from all the PVs
https://tenor.com/view/doit-dewit-palpatine-palpamemes-do-gif-7475334
<:heh:496448769185808435>
<@!195044406343106560> Pretty sure if you googled the ED you'd want to watch it sooner
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I really liked the first ep
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
<:heh:496448769185808435>
Is that a challenge, because I'll play you right now
I won by a considerable margin
We did it
<:KaosSmileFang:444799827805601803>
so like, moeblob with the yuri dialled way up was perfect for me
I like some moeblob anime though
Someone actually did the maths and that checks out
They're just in a spinning frame of reference and traveling at ~500km/h
Also, I'd like 12 more episodes of that honestly
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I love Sakura Trick
Yeah, it's super gay Carlos
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
I did point out to my friend that they basically just called the main character "lesbian" though since Riri can be read as Lily
Take that as you may
Their school is called Yuri Gakkou
I need to rewatch CG
Cool
Oh
Not sure why
Not even joking, Code Geass has a yuri tag
yes
According to Anilist
Uhhh
No
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I still need to watch Eupho/Code Geass/Made in Abyss
I need to get around to watching some movies
That was pretty uhhh
yeah
Liz and the Blue Bird
Oh, also, speaking of anime without conflict
Kase-san is so underrated
Hamefura's pretty up there
Hana, you down for yuri round
actually
That is my highest rated
Yeah, I need to watch 14 more then never any after that
which is like 1/6th of all my anime <:LuL:582156964276994063>
I'm up to 55 yuri anime watched
When it goes hard it's really good but it wastes too much time trying to be funny
Man, I wish Golden Kamuy was just a more serious drama rather than trying all this comedy shit
yes
but yeah, I can't be fucked with gear only
I was just watching Golden Kamuy
Shoulda shot me a ping
Oof
I can't read
and just wanted to finish
Like, I watched the last 3 eps of Natsume's Book of Friends in 30 minutes because I reached the point of not caring
How much am I allowed to speed it up?
Watch all of Detective Conan
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
That took me 5 days
Monogatari's like 96 eps and 3 movies
It's 48 eps right?
I was planning to do so anyway
it's a LN originally though
I'm watching the anime
Mahouka?
everything else was at least fairly good
Mahouka is my dedicated bad anime of the season
Rail Romansque is just whatever since it's so short
I don't feel like I really need to drop anything yet
Probably going to have to be fairly aggressive with my drops this season for sanity's sake
Same
Yeah
God, this just describes that whole anime
I could see Sports Climbing Girls having yuri
Holy shit that was a boring ass ep
Good to see Mahouka never accidentally got good
they do subs
misleading name
erai raws actually
Erai has it
Also Nyaa
Funimation
Looks fine to me <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
but it was already losing me from about minute 2 of the anime
Yeah, I dropped it when the biplane showed
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
10 minutes in I can tell I'm going to hate it
Yeah, Sigrdrifa's my first drop of the season
It's probably going to be between that, Ikebukuro West Gate Park and The Day I Became God for me
Majo no Tabitai is the clear best anime so far to me this season though
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Which I do
Like, the way it was made just made me keep asking "is no one going to address the fact she just took a fucking truck to the face?"
Yeah, that was kinda my issue. That was the big take away question from ep 1 for me and it didn't seem like it was meant to be
I actually thought the first ep was kinda terrible, but at the same time it just felt like pure setup for what comes after
Tonikaku was such a weird anime to me
What more do you need from an anime than abs really?
God bless
Thank God Funi licences so much shit so I can't watch it legally at all
Does Funi just pick up like every yuri anime now?
Same day as Assualt Lily
I love those
Like, at worst it's another average yuri anime
I'm still excited for it
I've seen the Nisekoi fansub
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
Pretty sure if CR's subbers saw us talking about this they'd tell us to stop
We could always just go Hidamari Sketch style and have a cute girl fever dream sequence
I'd love to see that honestly
<a:3DThonk:470557405890084887>
Imagine pausing on a text frame just to read something about how gay the main character's feeling
~~just flash the inner monologue up as a single black frame~~
A good studio can adapt that though, inner monologue heavy stories for example have been adapted before
Pretty sure Yu/Ri is going to be main ship
It's not super likely, but if any she's going to
I could legit see Assault Lily actually acknowledging the gay after that first ep
<:AquaHeh:585570589201268760>
Then again, how many times can you name things after yuri before you're past the baiting stage
Like, no baiting, they're explicitly gay
Pretty sure A&S is full on yuri
<:YuzuPonder:430875283860750347>
Why am I watching One Room
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
That explains why Anime Lab started going to shit then
Really
They were sold by Funi years ago
Not that that happens that often
Actually, to be fair it looks like Anime Lab actually grabbed Assault Lily
Interesting
she's just very uhhhh
I actually like Sora more than Emelia
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>

<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
I love how many people are putting the incest queen over Emelia though
<:remShit:444873255824916487>
And yes, I did vote for Sora over Emelia

Doesn't feel like it has enough content going for it
Hmm, not sure how Sleepy Princess is going to be 12 full length eps
Yes, it can?
Fuck MAL?
Anilist treats shounen as a tag on everything
it has caricatures
Jojo doesn't have deep charaters
https://anilist.co/anime/4654/Toaru-Majutsu-no-Index/
?
<:Doubt:696037552716775524>
Deep characters in Shounen
That's his biggest issue
No, Touma's just the kind of person who likes to eat white bread with no butter
Also, Araragi is the correct way to write an overpowered protag IMO. Powerful as fuck but most of the time his powers are just worthless. Same goes for Mob and to some extent Saitama (even though I'm not a fan of OPM).
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Yeah, if I have every Gatari LN on my PC and haven't got around to that when it's my favourite series ever there's actually 0 chance I'm going to seek out a LN for a series I hate
I hate everything about Touma and strongly doubt he's a good protag even in the source, because really I can't think of any positives to him at all.
I genuinely consider Touma to be amongst the worst anime protags I've ever seen
It's such a boring power too
at least the first ep
Ikebukuro's pretty great too
Yeah
Just cute girls doing chaotic things
Urara Meirochou is pretty much exactly my kind of show <:KaosSmileFang:444799827805601803>
For me it's that his entire personality feels like a throwaway gag
<:okageuse:447397489625268234>
<a:02derp:465210481326686208>
so I just slipped back like a year
I think he also had a purple colour
my brain's gone
God
wait, I'm too tired, Hio's someone I used to talk with who used a very similar emote all the time
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
because I saw him typing then stop when he read it again
Pretty sure Milllh did too
Yeah, I know exactly what you thought
Because there's not much else to appreciate
We should all watch Pastel Memories and appreciate the ending
<:kirinoSmile:450654058982670343>
Yes, Yosuga no Sora good
Hell yeah
It's like if you tool Mahouka and got rid of the best part <:kirinoWut:466053691254767636>
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I kinda am but also half feel that way
Index is just an even shittier Mahouka <:ChrisSip:660514247935000576>
Sometimes that makes Ishuzoku Reviewers a philosophy show, most of the time I think it's much better than moderated suggestions though
I actually find the way Anilist handles tags more interesting, because they are community based
May I introduce you to a paper called "Death of the Author". An Author can suggest genres, they aren't the definitive last word on genres. It's not unheard of for a work to be shifted between genres due to its fans.
You're acting like genres are 100% objective things rather than partially subjective and changeable over time anyway.
It feels like it should be
Is this a meme template BTW
Someone wished for more sequels on a fucking monkey paw
3rd season just started
yep
I kinda love that One Room is like 50% looking at a cute girl while waiting for your response time to end
just cut out the middle man for maximum efficiency
literal self insert
Hell yeah
Most shounen protags are pretty bland/self inserty same faces
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
and he just doesn't have one
Then they stop the gag
Damn, that's pretty good
both is bad
Either AAA or +/- don't bother me
Basically, it's just a weird cultural difference
The reason for it is that in Japan the passing grades are A, B and C with D being a failure. Due to this in games you had less ranks than you typically would in a letter graded western game which would add more grades below. To offset this they added another grade above. While they could have added E below it just doesn't make a ton of sense. D is already viewed as very bad, so it made more sense to add one above. S probably comes from Subarashi.
Yeah, Bookworm was one of the ones I thought of
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
The list of isekai that actually use the isekai element well can probably be counted on one hand
yeah, it's very good
ye
https://tenor.com/view/loli-anime-lick-blush-face-gif-8413059
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
I finally know where that gif of two girls licking another girl's face is from
Oh god
What's the point of this show?
Hmmm, I think I hate Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear more than any other first ep this season
I did it with S;G
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
The og series is about 6 hours
<:KirikaWow:741181236181205013>
I have to go binge two seasons of Strike Witches so I have something to watch on Thursdays
It's also in the top 12 results if I just google "cyberpunk movies"
It makes the story in some ways biblical and makes biblical ties stronger
I don't agree with that, some stories are written with specific metaphors in mind. Like Neo may not explicitly be Jesus, but that doesn't mean he's not meant to be
not really, the program can be read as a metaphor for society at large
Yeah, The Matrix has that
It is
Yeah
which isn't always a part of those anime
At the same time though, some sort of interaction between the real/virtual world is also normally part of cyberpunk
I'd just call it scifi
Kinda usually lacking the 'punk' aspect
even the good ones
In practice 90% of both take place in fairly generic medieval fantasy worlds though
So...
But there's also isekai like Outbreak Company and GATE where they can come back anyway
The two things are functionally similar
I was expecting something like Bofuri but it just played it completely straight other than the fact the protag was in a bear suit
Isekai with OP protag was all I got from ep 1 of the anime
and it's just that one artistic choice, it's literally impossible to not focus on
There's just something surreal about going from a guy in full military uniform and having the camera snap to a woman in full military uniform with no pants on.
Strike Witches is like watching a fever dream
https://tenor.com/view/screams-externally-ahh-scream-anime-gif-5389958
Who in the fuck makes a torrent and doesn't have it create a folder for the files
It's very gay
Yeah, I watched the first ep of that about a week ago <@!740195087895756820>
That's how I'm feeling to Millh
Only anime original I can think of off the top of my head is Assault Lily, which is pretty decent, especially if you liked anime like Revue Starlight
That's probably the best thing to air so far this season
Check out Majo no Tabitai Oclisto
Looks pretty good
The Day I Became God
I'm only at 11 so far
so I'm looking pretty OK
I ended up dropping two things today
<:ChrisSip:660514247935000576>
Yeah, I'll watch that just for Shaft
So is it S1>movie>S2 or S1>S2>movie?
Ash, I only need S1/2 to start the new season right?
<:kirinoThink:462470988186124308>
I'm super on board with this
Yeah, Adachi looks like it'll be really good
Well, there's actually an anime this season with an OP that's legit off key
good
yes
nice
Oh
I found it
ye
Wait, I only see raws
Interesting
Commie's doing Ikebukuro
God bless this one guy
Na, I'ma just watch this one
It just follows her
Just going to point out that the main theme of that show is Celtic in style
I guess Ergo Proxy is the other really notable one
https://anilist.co/search/anime?genres=Noir
It's just Gatari like
I mean, Kubikiri Cycle is a great anime
^Also this is a terrible idea, don't even try it
<a:rooKvv:464224362438852641>
Kubikiri Cycle, Shaft does detective drama
Lupin's so old
It's a lot like The Minority Report I think
It is, but it's still got the darker/grittier detective elements
Has anyone said Psycho-Pass?
Baccano's a good one too
Try ID Invaded maybe?
I give things with sequels next season priority. So I think I need to do Log Horizon soon
was a gay ep
Majo no Tabitai <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I'm fine with this though
So, is every anime this season just going to be yuri, cause that was like the 3rd
It's not an anime though
The Ring?
God, the girls from Assault Lily have huge hips
Optimal
I'd happily live in room 4 on floor 4 in the 4th building on 4th street. Save me some cash.
Oh, hi Adam
God, Strike Witches has some serious unintentional comedy going for it
<a:YuzuHype:411782417267949569>
I kinda wonder if they were swapped late in production for some reason
like, the first 15 seconds of the OP just scream ED at me and there's a few shots in the ED that absolutely look like they're cut from an OP
like, I can tell they didn't put a ton of thought into this, but it's just all super weird
Even the visuals, like both feel like they were cut kinda weirdly, but to me the visuals on the ED actually look closer overall to an OP
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
I'm just sitting here and wondering why Sport Climbing Girls didn't use its ED as its OP
I wasn't wrong
I just saw that frame and was like "Jesus I'm pretty sure her thigh's actually the size of her waist"
<:heh:496448769185808435>
<:sweat:457717850220658688>
God, Assault Lily's character design
Also, her thigh is almost the same size as her waist, those two lines are the exact same size (minor NSFW)
Assault Lily <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
I'm actually really liking Shaftmogear <:KaosSmileFang:444799827805601803>
give me a sec and I'll ping you in nsfw with something from it
Specifically S2 ep 3
Strike Witches
Somehow I seem to have went from super wholesome witches flying around on brooms and helping people to super lewd witches getting off on brooms within the space of a day <:YuzuPonder:430875283860750347>
by a wall
They're being ordered to do idol stuff
That's no joke the plot of the anime
~~it's not really good though~~
22/7 next Ash, girls being ordered to do idol stuff by a sentient piece of plaster board.
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
The first ep of Strike Witches 2
"You're not going to high school"
"No, I'm going to be a doctor instead"
He is
Just want to leave this beautiful pic here
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
God, I love that they're using the word "zubon" to refer to their bottomwear in Strike Witches
Happy Sugar Life was comfy
Yeah, I need to rewatch soon
Also, this is the MC's transformation and it's one of my favourites honestly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBIqQQGOM9s
It has one of my favourite plot twists ever
<a:BanaNice:501549702383140865>
Watch Revue Starlight though
Na, Revue Starlight's pretty similar to Gear in terms of mostly baiting
Just replace Kakeguri with it honestly
<a:YuzuBlush:409351682821062676>
I love both the anime and manga
<:MomoWhyAreYouLikeThis:642133990081560610>
They named the OVA Operation Victory Arrow
They're too damn cute
God, Lucchini noises just make my heart melt
<:yuzuWave:404672035092955137>
And Yuzu is an amazing character
Overly dramatic step-sister yuri flic where every character is gay and most of them want to fuck one or both of the two MCs
<:yuzuwanheart:656791199809536000>
Yes, I do too
also, wow, this is the rare not school aged CGDCT anime
<:ababa:477838560989544448>
<a:kanbaruAww:567655918691680259>
Less than one minute into Maesetsu, it's already cute AF
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Is it weird that I just got my immersion in the Strike Witches movie completely broken by a boat taking a really weird route to its destination. Like, why are they going past Cape Town in South Africa. It's set in 1945 with no WWII, both the Panama and Suez existed at that point, either route from Japan to Europe would be far faster, with Suez being optimal.
It's so much older than I thought
Also, Slow Start started serialisation in 2013
and most of them are good
same
Pretty decent bet
But like, considering the other manga they publish
<a:02derp:465210481326686208>
I may be wrong on that actually, I think they're the same magazine, not the same author
<@!171395487247630336> I feel like this is worth pointing out. The slide here says Â•Ω„Åç„Å™Áâ©„ÄÅÂ•≥„ÅÆÂ≠ê. Translation, Favourite thing(s), girls. Since this is by the same author as Koisuru Asteroid guess what that means.
It's in the "how did this happen" bad category
<:ChrisSip:660514247935000576>
Also that's the entire anime
May I introduce you to our lord and saviour SkelterxHeaven
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJxJh7zObec
I didn't even give that a shot <:LuL:582156964276994063>
right
oh
what was that Ash?
They're doing something in that manga
Sakura Trick?
yeah, it's a far better season
Yeah, and Fruit Tart seems like a strong CGDCT anime that airs on the exact same day anyway
Kinda considering dropping sleeping princess though
Not counting AoT
so I'll be at 20 I think
Also have to watch the Strike Witches movie and first ep of S3 still
I guess I still have Dogeza but that show's just a giant meme
Gave me big Comic Girl vibes
üá®üá¶
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
It's probably not though
I'm hoping this is like a Madoka spinoff thing where it got confirmed 12 eps but was actually split cour
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Why do anime sometimes do this thing where they have a version of the OP with really obnoxious SFX played way too loud?
like, it still airs on Thursday in JP so...
Last I checked Funi doesn't actually modify how anime looks <:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
I really like the atmosphere Wixoss is setting up, I have no idea what the fuck the card game's meant to be though
Yes, that's because it's only half done
S1 was better because it concluded its arc, S2 can't really be properly compared yet because it hasn't
I think to this point S1 was better, but that's an unfair comparison
<:kirinoS:555274169856688138>
Time to use spin.moe again and not watch whatever it gives me, again
the thing that ruins it for me is the realisation that the sums of money they're betting don't really mean anything to anyone
It's just a far worse Kaiji with cute girls
To me Kakeguri is just ehhh
<a:nyanNyan:470570193911808020> <:ARRYAYA:470759923823804417>
It's pretty nice though, I'd say it's worth finishing at least to the end of S2
I finished the first two seasons
yeah
I can't believe Wixoss actually had more balls in the way it ended than fucking ||Oreimo||
I can't remember anything about Outbreak Company other than not liking it at all
but like, I trust Shaft to at least do something interesting with it
Assault Lily needs to up its gay now
<:YuzuHi:522167808050724887>
<:HaneCute:640613599881986076>
God, I love Adachi to Shimamura way too much
"just friends guys"
Adopt and raise a child together
even if it doesn't end up being good it'll be interesting
<:HomuHorny_MM:728011973995790416>
The yuri action show is Valkyrie Drive
It's gonna be out a day later than originally
No Ash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Io4aHizWvQ
Still need to get around to the rebuild movies
I hope they get more adaptations in the future
That explains the quality
Oh
Science babies <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
God I wish that was me
Tommy Wiseau exists after all
Being objectively awful has worked out well in the past
and that show was hot garbage
I can remember events from Conception
Like, the best critique I can make of Danmachi is that it was so unimpactful that I literally cannot remember one event in the entire series
It's Accelerator but without any interesting characters or backstory
It's aggressively average, it's so frustratingly boring that I can't even bring myself to be particularly offended by it.
I'll slander the hell out of Danmachi
She just looks like a worse version of Shera
<a:KazumaPanty:394173309916413953>
Wasn't expecting a S2 for that one at all
OK then
https://twitter.com/comic_natalie/status/1317344613112320000
Toradora for example
Yes, but there are shounen romances that aren't like this
It's a shame, it seemed interesting
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
Tonikaku Kawaii's doing that thing that can only be described as being "too shounen"
I feel like New Game is probably my number 1
at least Fruit Tart feels pretty Comic Girlsish though
Comic Girls really needs another season
Is that too much to ask for?
God, I want an Assault Lily/Miru Tights crossover
I like all kinds of yuri <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
I prefer it when he just talks about ecchi or wastes money on gacha
Also, I actually hate Gigguk's videos on seasonal anime in general
fade into the sunset
Job's done
Create youtube channel, gain millions of subs, tell them to watch Symphogear
Yeah, literally nothing about art is objective
The only anituber I actually go to if I want a legit opinion is Glass Reflection though, he's actually got some decent ideas and knows how to express himself
If he says not to watch something it's probably worth at least looking at
He's like, the most consistent anituber
I mean, I care about Digibro's opinion because he's almost always wrong
Shinsekai yori has my favourite anti-endorsement of all time though. Digibro called it worse than SAO. That's how you know it's good
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Also, personally really looking forward to Otherside Picnic's anime
I'd recommend Shinsekai yori if you haven't watched it
||"I love the smell of girls"||
Fruit Tart got a lot more gay this week
Kaiki's Soliloquy is possibly my favourite scene ever
If you want to try to understand characters and events cause/effect it's much more complicated
Monogatari's plot is easier to understand but it's a lot deeper than Yuri Kuma
<:KaosSmileFang:444799827805601803>
It's my favourite series and it makes Yuri Kuma look simple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM3_Jskk44
When are you watching Monogatari then Ash?
You're not meant to know what's going on
Yeah, it's not my kind of music though Hana
Top 10 things to not say as the protagonist of a horror anime (Higurashi new)
The animation's fine, the actual song is horrible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QJpqHx3soo&feature=emb_title
The second pair of girls in Adachi are super wholesome too <:YuuYay:611944961746796544>
Hip Hip isn't as big of a genre of music here as it is in the US though. Part of the reason I don't really like Hip Hop/Rap is because I never really heard them growing up. Huge rock/pop/alternative scenes here comparatively which is more of what I listen to. So my favourite OPs tend to be more things like Noragami.
||I saw brown kill orange in the living room||
it just fits so well
God, Higurashi just makes me want to make a string of Among Us memes for some reason
<:MomoWhyAreYouLikeThis:642133990081560610>
Akudama Drive's OP actually hurts me
<:uguu:616501273520373760>
And Kanon 2006 is actually one of my favourite anime ever, so I'll forgive a couple of early missteps
Like every one was considerably better than the last
There was a noticeable increase in quality going from Kanon>Air>Kanon again though
~~I'm so glad Kanon 2006 exists so no-one has to watch that abomination~~

<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Yeah, Valvrave isn't even on my PTW list and I don't even know half of the anime on there at this point
I don't have much interest at Valvrave at this point
I was talking about Kannazuki no Miko, but I'll probably watch Cross Ange at some point too
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
Still haven't got around to watching that one yet
I'm a fan of the darker eps though, not quite sure why
yesn't
I'm really loving Majo no Tabitai though, I'm glad it's not just all fluff
Does this count as a head tilt? (Assault Lily)
<:YuuYay:611944961746796544>

<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
I wasn't expecting Idol Fruit Tart to be one of my favourite anime this season, but it's very fun
It feels a fair bit gayer
<:ChrisYikes:679341065878241292>
Also contains 15 different remixes of Fly me to the Moon
Is a good show
<:KirikaWow:741181236181205013>
Eva has some of my favourite character designs though
At least she's a cute piece of shit
Nerv is an example of an extremely corrupt and abusive organisation that's the only one with the power to do anything. Again, it's a major point of the show though.
Shinji's just meant to be a kid, he just acts like a kid. He's not meant to be some super soldier with no sense of self preservation. One of the points of Eva is that none of the kids are particularly in a good place, probably because they're being made to fight to the death in giant robots.
<:AkaneWaa:506164173617758219>
I will not sell Akane
No
<:YuzuPonder:430875283860750347>
She'd be my second pink haired nendo girl though
yeah
I may actually end up getting this
so that's a thing
There's a nendo of an anime character based on a doll now though
yep
last time I can remember a season this saturated was exactly 2 years ago
This is the season of yuri though
I just wish it felt more Shaft like
Assault Lily really doesn't have much more room left for baiting. If it goes much further it's just straight up yuri
And yes Ash, Sony's pretty bad
and yes, I probably forgot someone, sue me
*for anime anyway
and neither of those services are anywhere as big as CR or Funni
That pretty much makes Sony a near monopoly since they're only competing with Netflix and Hulu
<:fuck:582156674555707402>
https://twitter.com/Kotaku/status/1322151755556204544

Also Monogatari
yes
<:nadeshikocomf:590231274975657986>
It is
I'd say we're doing OK
This season? We have 
Adachi to Shimamura, actual yuri 
Assault Lily, heavy yuri bait or actual yuri
Fruit Tart, moderate yuri bait
Majo no Tabitai, light yuri bait in one ep so far
Strike Witches, moderate yuri bait
"Thigh Review"
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Gigguk's review of Assault Lily
If there's one VA I can instantly recognise it's Hiroshi Kamiya
It's not really one that I've really bothered listening much too, I genuinely don't think SW OPs are very good in general, they're just a little forgettable. So I guess I just didn't even hear that till it was pointed out to me.
Yeah, I think Milhi's right on the SW OP
I feel like calling that a generic shounen OP isn't a reach. I don't think that makes it bad persay, but it certainly makes it not amongst the best of the season, especially when this season has a lot of really unique and high quality OPs. This is literally a critique, you can say "if you don't have anything nice to say" and such, but like, really dude, if you like it that's fine. I just gave my opinion on it and I'm really not a huge fan, mostly because it sounds like about 15 other OPs I've heard in AMQ.
IDK, that's just all I could think when I heard that, sorry
https://animethemes.moe/video/IkebukuroWestGatePark-OP1.webm
I love this holistically though, the animation is fantastic and I actually really like the song
Super generic shounen OP?
Probably The Day I Became God is up there too
OPs
My top three this season are Majo no Tabitai, Assault Lily and Ikebukuro WGP
There's a lot of better OPs this season though
It's OK
Yosuga no Sora
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>

Wow, this is pretty gay
God, this actually looks so nice

Not like that was my only issue with Hero though. I found it to be slow as fuck and generally uninteresting compared to the earlier seasons
I watched the entire season and I still think it looks like crap
And? The anime's artstyle was always better than the novels
Yeah, but it still looked 20x better than Hero
<:Doubt:696037552716775524>
I don't really give a fuck how closely an adaptation follows the source, just its quality. And I actually thought that on pretty much all aspects Born was a much higher quality show than Hero even if it's technically a worse adaptation. The author can be angry about it if he wants, but that doesn't make him right <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Yes, and I don't really care about that honestly
And thought Born was a whole lot better
I didn't like Hero at all
I really disagree
Not fantastic
DxD was uhhhh
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Who are honestly a pretty underrated studio
Yeah, but it's still Passione
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Not even Shaft
<:KoyoTilt:489285273625034753>

It's just a seinen mahou shoujo

It's not a perpetual motion machine, just a way to store more energy than you used to create it that's allowed under physics. You can't do it forever because you eventually run out of water and you can't put the system back in its original state without putting in more energy than you got out.
If you use energy to split water into hydrogen/oxygen then you use the hydrogen for fusion power you get more power out than you had to put in to split the water
There actually is an energy storage medium that's theoretically greater than 100% efficiency.
Also, it's not gay <:heh:496448769185808435>
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>

The Rebelion ending was so much better than them just ending up together though
Class warfare the anime <:LuL:582156964276994063>
God, Yuukoku no Moriarty is so damn edgy
I think they're completely different stories
*cough* Oregairu
Maybe it's just because I watch shows waiting for that kind of shit to happen though and actually get a little disappointed if a show just ends by the numbers in a way that was totally expected
Oh, I like the ending of the show too
||I don't actually think Hina's a god, I think she more likely has some sort of sci-fi type prediction ability. There were people talking about it in ep 2 or 3 a bit. So I don't think she did, she just picked the right responses||
These sorts of character driven heavily emotional shows always tend to be a slow burn though
It feels like something the director would do
It probably is TBH
I like that theory
Oof
<:Doubt:696037552716775524>

<:LuL:582156964276994063>
I think this is more than vaguely yuri
but like
I don't think you're ever going to get an explicit relationship or anything here
I mean, probably?
It's just a white/red grid, I could put that together in 2 min
It feels like it's actually gayer now than it was before <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Fruit Tart
Oh god this hurts to look at
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Saya's assertive as hell
Got like 20+ eps
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
Time to catch up on seasonals
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
i couldn't become a hero so i reluctantly decided to get a job
Yeah, I'd at least check out the first few eps. After ep 3 you'll have a fair idea what's going on.
||What if time travel?||
Interestingly ||this would leave open an ascent to actual godhood as the end of Hina and/or Youta's world||
If you do a little bit of title analysis though, The Day I Became God ||implies "I" (most likely Hina) was at one point not a god. To me a straight faced reading of this makes Hina as Odin unlikely, since Odin never would have "became" god, he always was a god, or if he wasn't he "became" god thousands of years ago. To me there's two things the title can mean, Hina became a god at some time around the start of the show, or someone will become a god before the end of the show. While the later would allow for Hina's story to check out it still seems less likely than not to me.|| JP title is very similar to English too, so there's no mistranslation here.
Thanks, I hate it
Good shit
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
||Miyafuji now has the same power as Issei I guess||

You watched this weeks ep
<:sweat:457717850220658688>
Is it just me or has this season of strike witches been hornier than normal
The only reason I'm not convinced is because it's Jun Maeda and the whole world ending thing seems like something he'd do
<a:WeSmart:773315071493013555>
I'd also advise just watching all 8 eps at once rather than 8 times
Depends on the phone, there's some that are designed to be cameras with a phone function basically
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
one ep there's 4k TVs and the next they're buying a camera for "photographing their life" rather than just using a phone
Man, Tonikaku Kawaii has some confused timeframes
||Big titty|| Lucchini was pretty cursed honestly
Learning to read/write Japanese is horrible though. Kanji break my brain
That's kinda their point
Na, phones like the Google Pixel are famous for being pretty much on-par with high-tier cameras
Try a couple of years
<:heh:496448769185808435>
<:ARRYAYA:470759923823804417>
Wasn't expecting that
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
but since it's not confirmed and it feels very much like it's got more eps to go after it is possible
normally this sort of anime would just be 13 eps
It's hard to say
Yeah, it could still be 2 cour
Is it confirmed one cour yet?
Since the plot was probably pretty bare bones
I'ma guess Shaft still had a lot of room to write what they wanted though
The plot is entirely original
It's based of a figure line
did you not expect some high IQ shit to be going on?
It's a Shaft original series
Kinda interesting that they had it then just didn't really mention it again in the ep
Pretty sure the last ep started with some sort of Eva/Madoka style twist if you go back and watch that
Shitposting furiously

Yeah, Sleepy Princess just didn't work for me. I wanted to like it but it just got old way too fast
Is very good
It is
Strong rec on Baccano based on what you mentioned
Wouldn't be surprised if you've seen one or more of those though
Attack on Titan, Noragami, Princess Principle, Baccano
or like, other anime you've enjoyed?
What do you want to watch?
If you want something good check out Kase-San, it's a bit longer but like, it doesn't suck
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
You could check out Skelter Heaven though, it's pretty terrible.
I know some good 1 hour OVAs but I don't think I've ever seen that good of a 20 min one
<:LuL:582156964276994063>
wait
Someone should have screencapped that one from last time where we all guessed a different Precure and we were all wrong
I was playing Stelaris so I missed it <:ChrisPout:660514247733674021>
Pretty meme heavy show too
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhCKpyVRIjw
Don't know if anyone else watched S1 of this, but it's pretty decent and getting another
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Welp, Majo no Tabitai fucked me up again
<:heh:496448769185808435>
Glitter Force
<:Papika:650665000653946882>
Flip Flappers is fantastic
Been sitting on my PTW for way too long
I'm going to get around to watching Maquia today
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
When an anime perfectly understands who's watching it
Really good stuff
OK, so I actually watched Maquia after over a year procrastinating and I think it's legit my favourite movie I've ever watched
~~I wouldn't be sure of that~~
This is the strangest turn Wixoss could have taken
It looks so well done from the trailers too
God I'm so hyped for the Otherside Picnic anime
I will eventually
<a:modCheck:768599904473186374>
I heard yuri novels
Good anime
Golden Kamuy has actually mastered the art of making flashbacks interesting, possibly even moreso than the main plotline
It's so underrated and actually funny as hell
God I missed this anime
<:ChrisSip:660514247935000576>
Oh hey, the shitpost is airing again
it be true
White bread with no topping Touma
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
getting anime next season too
<:kuroM:469874073028001812>
And anyone who's watched the show can probably guess what's below that spoiler <:LuL:582156964276994063>
Mahouka has an ||incest|| powerup now
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Adachi to Shimamura's so fluffy and I love it so much
<:AkaneWaa:506164173617758219>
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
I really like the new OP though
It just aired late
Because it's part of fall
<a:CryBabyGif:562737712428482571>
||they named her Yuri|| because Shaft is great at subtlety
||They have a daughter now||
Pretty gay
It's fun
<:fuck:582156674555707402>
Every week I find myself relating more and more with Shimamura
||oops, I opened the gay box||
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
So does her sister
God bless Saya (spoiler for this week's Majo no Tabitabi)
Black is even less interesting than regular to me
Ehhhh
~~I study Bio so I couldn't even really learn anything from it~~
Cells at Work was just super meh for me
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
I've still got to watch another season of Log Horizon, two seasons of Wixxos and World Trigger before next season
Friendly reminder that there's an entire 2 season anime that's basically an advert for Street Fighter
also, can't agree with S1 being boring
It's very good
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Clannad next Ash
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I've watched a lot of gay anime but Sakura Trick was the gayest
Antarctica is so good, I've been meaning to rewatch it for a while now
Actually probably my favourite year of anime
Mine drops off super hard before 2006
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
2018 was such a golden year for anime though
I have a pretty similar curve though

https://twitter.com/WEP_anime/status/1339087976291168257
I have no idea what this is but it has my attention
<:02lul:414576440114151424>
Of all anime they could use to advertise that
<:MomoWhyAreYouLikeThis:642133990081560610>
It's not like E8 because things actually change every loop
Yeah, I'm a little late but Re:Zero is very good
<:ChrisSip:660514247935000576>
IDK if it's yuri but it's girls in leotards so I'll watch
I'm down
Oh look, it's another one of these
Holy
The 3rd season of Wixoss is a hot mess
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Characters being happy in a post Madoka mahou shoujo
<:NotLikeYuzu:597176643441786907>
Completely missed this key image, but this is a show I'm very interested in
Pretty much just took the core conceit of Wotakoi and said "what if we remove all the interesting characters and just replace them with cardboard cutouts" <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Think I've had enough of Tonikaku Kawaii for a lifetime
<:MonaBlush:763702128757047306>
Hmmm, Yuyu basically just straight up said ||abuse me onee-sama||

The issues I have with this one run deeper than that
And Charlotte's ending's only real problem was that it needed more runtime
The big problem for me is that Youta just isn't an interesting character. He got away with that early on because the sidecast (and specifically Hina) carried him. When he's on his own he just doesn't work for me. All you're left with is ||a kinda boring kid shouting at a disabled girl and terrifying her,|| which makes him very much not a likeable protag. That can be fine for some shows but it just doesn't work in what Maeda's created. Logically I should be cheering for Youta, but the last couple of eps I've just been thinking "stop and go home, let the lady deal with this".
Maeda just can't stick his endings since Charlotte
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
I'm not loving the end of Kamisama, and it's a shame because it started out really strong

||I just want to feel like I'm contributing to the conversation <:heh:789431887135113241> ||
This is my plan for next season, may well drop a couple still though
Why is every CR original like this?
God I love Hayu
Fruits Tart is one of my favourites this season
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
Why did it feel like nothing happened if they cut 40%
Let's be real
There's like, 8 free spaces
any of his shows probably bingo that
But like
Kamisama ni Natta Hi
Just going to throw it out there, Jun Maeda has bingo'd
Can't say as I get that one
It really can
Yuru Camp is probably top 3 CGDCT anime to me though
Na, I really couldn't get into Non-non at all
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-12-22/slow-loop-fishing-manga-listed-with-tv-anime/.167763

<:yurucomfy:422498798703476737>

Anilist has decimal rating
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I want more
God, Adachi and Shimamura was so cute the whole way through
I've had seasons up in the mid 20s before
The trailer looks good but I have very little faith in what people say is good romance after ToniKawaii
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
https://twitter.com/horimiya_anime/status/1341020599242518529
Let's play a game of do I get burned by popular Shounen romance again or is it actually good this time
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Yeah, they should have reused Database
I just want to see the PS2 anime
New shows, Ura Sekai Picnic, Horimiya, Ex-Arm (for all the wrong reasons), Wonder Egg Priority

Returning, Re: Zero, Yuru Camp, Beastars
not that Hayu is particularly straight, she's just not Ino levels of perma horny
Yep, my favourite is still Hayu though
The only three new anime from this season that I really liked were Majo no Tabitabi, Ochikobore Fruit Tart and Adachi to Shimamura
Nothing special
Moriarty is OK
It's literally a generic isekai with the first 5 minutes removed
Saying "they're not transported to another world" kinda misses the point IMO. For all intents and purposes for the viewer they are. There's no functional difference between VR and another physical world.

I also go a step further and say that actually being transported to another world isn't actually even a requirement for isekai if a show shares enough traits with isekai in other ways. My example would be Danmachi, which is basically a hypergeneric isekai that just doesn't involve another world. In every other way it epitomises the genre.
It's an isekai because it shares various plot structures and narrative devices with other isekai. That's how genres actually work.
Defining a genre by strictly a small portion of the narrative is nonsense, they're both isekai
Yeah, I was going to say S1 was the Symphogear guys
Yes, they reused the OP but redid the animation
But that's not how genres are actually defined
An extreme example is Your Name
It's really not
Danmachi's far more alike something like Smartphone shit than it is alike Made in Abyss for example
No, because not all fantasy anime have all of the tropes of isekai
Living up to the first one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJBHySglLXU&feature=emb_title
Ohhh, this OP's really good

<:Pog:789276360966799370>
SoL brother/sister romance
<:Homucide_MM:366003494513147915>
<:MonaCry:754291948147441694>
But like, I'd like a S2
I know
Yeah
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/kjif0f/twitter_assault_lily_bouquets_story_will_continue/
Hopefully this isn't just talking about the gacha
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
God, they took that the planetfall scene from Yuyuyu and made it like 10x lewder
It's certainly far from my least favourite show this season though, It's fine
But there was a lot of wasted potential
I mean, I like it still
No
There's hints of something really good here
I kinda wish that Assault Lily got two cours
<:CagliostroPout:672861874471174166>
I just want more ute girls doing cute gay things anime
Yeah, I'd certainly like the anime too
Yeah, I want to be able two abbreviate it to WA2:2
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Welp, there goes the spoiler tags
||It's not a sequel, WA is a kinda shitty harem anime. To make it even more confusing WA2 and WAS2 are different things <:LuL:789259461470322728> ||
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
The fact that there's actually sex later in the show is a spoiler
Scum's Wish is very contentious. Some people love it, some hate it.
No, the one under the spoiler
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
It's like a roulette
Very good show, and there's no way to know whether or not I'm spoiling for you
Also, I have to spoiler this because it's more of a major plotpoint there but ||White Album 2||
but less of a dumpsterfire
Same sort of idea
<:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
You seen Scum's Wish
DomKano was actually fun
<:LuL:789259461470322728>

<:tsukihiPeek:567655914270883870>
I actually do too
That was a ride
I was going to say the worst I've seen was Araragi's bathtime with Tsukihi, but I've watched Yosuga no Sora so that's actually not true
I've seen and am a fan of worse <:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
So uhh, I'll take a Miyuki spinoff over more main story honestly
<:PepeHands:358698235923136530>
This is the only reason I even watch Mahouka
That's what I said
Yeah
Oh, so actually SoL brother/sister romance, nice
It just eclipsed everything else this season for me
I like Majo no Tabitabi, but like, I just love Adachi to Shimamura so much
When you start looking at a show like that from like, ep 3 it becomes very easy to focus on its flaws and really pick it apart
In one of the early eps I got the idea into my head that it was just bad Wotakoi and from that point on I was pretty much just dissecting all the reasons I didn't like it.
Which aside from me just hating the direction of it also has the side effect of making the entire cast boring and honestly making all of the interactions between the main MCs dull as dishwater. It gets covered over by fluff, but then I'm just like, I've seen pointless romantic fluff done with actual characters before and it was fantastic. I just don't think Tonikawaii does anything at all anywhere near as good as Wotakoi
I hate the entire concept. It's romance wish fulfilment with a bland self insert male MC and a doormat female MC who only really exists to serve the male's desires rarely wanting to do anything for herself.
else just search my account and filter by 2020, only reason I don't post it here is because my profile pic is lewd trumpets
It's actually pretty big when you zoom in
then click the image again
Click>open in browser
Pet was a show
Yeah
I legit expected nothing going into it
ID was such a standout show honestly
Probably as good of a time as any to post my bad opinions about this year's anime since it's almost all done. Sure no-one will disagree with anything here <:heh:789431887135113241>
Kamisama managed to go a whole episode without ||shouting at disabled children.|| God fucking bless for that.
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
That is the single most tilting opinion I've ever read
God
DitF
In their worst series
In their best series it works
Trigger's problem is that their endings always escalate way too far and become absurd
I'ma say it quite easily beats both of them
OVA series has the teddy blanket too
Don't watch the TV version
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
That's a thing that happened in the OVA version
You don't like the sister dressed in a swimsuit sitting on her brother's face?
He's a kid with some serious issues before the show even starts
If I was told to fight an alien invasion in a giant mech I'd tell whoever was telling me to do that to fuck off
I find Shinji more relatable than most protags
Also, on the symbolism point. Is it more likely that it was trying to pretend to be symbolic and that literally everyone who likes it is bullshitting or that you just didn't fully understand the symbolism. Because it's really not at all empty.
Even Gendo is working towards a goal that he thinks will ultimately make the world in his view better
That's kinda the point, every character in Eva can be awful, they can also not be awful
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
I don't even know what anime you're talking about
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Wait, my first Mahou Shoujo was KlK
Is that hat you meant?
Princess Tutu?
Oh
YuYuYu
<:CoconaDespair:307747519859785739>
I think mine was Flip Flappers
The only time when Trigger managed to temper their bullshit and make an ending that wasn't absurd in every way was Gridman ~~and it's their best work~~
It just ends on what feels like a random episode from the middle of the series
It doesn't even have an ending
That's not true
Actually
I've ever seen
Has the worst ending
ImoSae
A bad ending is far worse than say, a bad ep 7
A bad ending can have a huge impact on a show
Like, I don't think YuYuYu even really understood why Madoka worked, it just copied and did its own thing at points and kinda bluffed into working
Quite a lot of Madoka clones don't understand why Madoka worked
<:kyubeyhowitworks_MM:366003507943178240>
There's always Mahou Shoujo Site
<:Homucide_MM:366003494513147915>

Millh I've seen worse
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Actually, Symphogear's older
~~Symphogear?~~
pretty sure that was the same author as Anohana
Maquia?
Already on the PTW
yep
but it's still good
It's not as good as the anime awards thought it was
Yuri on Ice is good
<:nadeBlank:488874851214295040>
What do you want from me, I only put the first season of anything on my rewatch list
Symphogear S1
row three column three
It's literally on there
<:MonkaS:640338633722822684>
my rewatch list is just insane already

<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
The one thing that would have changed shit is if the author ballsed up and actually just did the incest ending properly
Season one of Oreimo was already fucking huge
I actually don't think that's true
https://tenor.com/view/kirino-oreimo-sway-swaying-dance-gif-7514095
Kirino is best girl

Oreimo's ending is great if you stop watching ~5 minutes before the end of the last ep

If you look up my anilist you'll know my stance on Hibike Eupho and why I'm much less interested in the movie
keep putting it off
I'm dreading watching the sequel film
Inclined to agree with Liz being the best
yeah
<:ShinobuDab:704817333402599494>
Kizumonogatari 3 too
Both of those
Yep
There's still a good few movies that I'd put above both of them though
Unpopular opinion time, Weathering with You>Your Name
It's literally my favourite anime movie
It is, the only thing it's good for is meming about how bad it is
Pretty sure it wasn't nominated the next year either
Humanity man
<:Homucide_MM:366003494513147915>
Remember, Maquia wasn't even nominated for best movie that year and MHA beat Liz
Maquia fucked me up though
<:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
But has less viewers than the Gintama sequels
Is in the top 50
S2
Out of the top 50 on MAL it has the least viewers
Literally the most underwatched anime ever
Or the 7th Yakumo (Rakugo Shinju), fantastic character, ||may or may not have killed his best friend||
Like, probably my all time favourite protagonist is Rei from Sangatsu no Lion and I really don't think he's a character who's written to be looked up to at all
I just like characters who are inherently more human
I actually don't care about that
See, I think this is where I diverge from you a lot
in pretty much every other way
The two series on there which include a lot of blood are exceptionally good
and why I'm not that into AoT compared to most
probably one of the reasons why I tend to rate that sort of show lower
I'm still generally not a huge fan of blood and gore
And Amanchu which slipped in by being the first alphabetical 8.5
All the anime I have at 9/10
but not one of the best
It's still good
so slightly overrated IMO
AoT isn't a 9/10 anime, it's like, an 8/10
AoT is a little overrated but still really good overall
Steins;Gate and Sangatsu are both 9-10 anime
I mean, everything I've watched that's a 9 on MAL has been solid I think
||they killed best girl though <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368> ||
It's solid
and cute waifus
<:MomoWhyAreYouLikeThis:642133990081560610>
fantastic series
I watched 13 eps of Mahouka and I remember maybe two things that happened
I just can't imagine a less interesting protag than Touma
It's so apt
<a:BanaNice:501549702383140865>
It's a hot mess
The "white bread no butter" is my description of Touma
Toaru has this weird split where Railgun's really good and Index is borderline unwatchable
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Fucking white bread no butter
I hate half of the longest running series I've watched
It's the only long running shounen anime that interests me
probably
I'll watch it one day

Literally just Yuru Camp is enough for me
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Not having degenerate idols every week is pain
That's actually just getting mad with Touma one layer removed though, which basically describes the Index anime
You should agree with me more, I'm usually right
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
This character is like, the only good thing about Log Horizon S2
<:MonaCry:754291948147441694>
But none of them are going to have Ino
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Yep, AoT is solid but it has more problems than people care to admit
Probably worth it considering nothing's airing right now though
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
You're telling me Assault Lily was a yuri anime
This is optimal
What are you talking about

Trying to work out how Netflix's sub team managed to translate „É´„Ç§ (Rui) to Rouis. Like, It's pretty obviously meant to be Lewis/Louis, but even if you were going to have a jank translation wouldn't it just be Rui?
~~also, Beastars is next season too~~

I was literally there for Kirino
I cared for almost none of the characters
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
so
I didn't find it enjoyable
No, just the first one the game gives you
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
I played that game to get to the point where I could roll Kirino
Kinda unironically looking forward to more horse idol racing
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Three new anime starting tomorrow for me
I have more issues with the exploitation of children's psychology than the use of female imagery in selling figure, yes. I don't view these as equal problems because I have an understanding of how predatory marketing towards children can actually be. It's less what's being sold that bothers me here and more the way it's sold, with advertisers often exploiting harmful psychological traps that children and those with disabilities are more vulnerable to.
I think they're problematic in different ways. I actually have huge issues with the ethics of marketing to children in general anyways.
Still seems to be going so it can't have done too terribly
Also, there was a show directly trying to compete with Precure earlier this year
It's somewhat niche, but not small in the slightest
I did, but Precure has marketed merchandising to children, normally young girls. It's not exactly a small niche market either.
Selling merchandise gets you more money, it's not just a male fan thing. Look at Precure.
But that's always going to trend towards genres that are inclusive of edge cases
No, I prefer a more community driven approach honestly
The big issue with that for anime is that there's no critics with particularly widely respected opinions within the western anime community to actually carry that conversation, it's much more fan driven than film and TV.
I mean, what's the other option? Either genres are decided by the wider community or? I struggle to even contemplate what that or is because anything else seems like you'd inherently have to be using your own bias as a major factor.
It still would have been because it's very much considered as a magical girl show by the majority of the comunity
Sorry
There's nothing wrong with refocusing on something atypical of a genre, there just has to be a good reason to do so. Madoka worked because the writers understood what they were doing, Madoka with a different ending still would have worked unless the ending was incredibly destructive. The reasons why shows like Site don't work is usually more to do with the fact that they're mass produced garbage capitalising off a more popular show than any theming choice. If handled by better writers they likely could work, it's not like they're Conception level bad ideas.
Like, at this point any genre conventions of scifi for example are pretty much gone
To be fair there are genres so wide as to essentially become settings, it's what tends to happen as genres age and become wider
<:NepSmugp:573775756639862784>
Plot magic
<:nadeYander:567670672835477505>
Can you though
Yeah, the only issue I really had with it was CGI jank
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Not that I mind
Kinda insane to think this is just what the guy who directed Steins;Gate does now
Always good to be reminded just how stupid we can be when it comes to naming horses
I wonder if r/cutelittlefangs is having fun with Urasekai
<:3Head:789258667971182653>
and remember fuck all
Because i watched this like 2+ years ago
I was starting from 0 either way
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
It's about what I expected
The ED was great though
~~watch Tsuki ga Kirei~~
Doesn't look great, interesting enough I don't care
Reminds me of Tsuki ga Kirei
Looking forward to Re:Zero though
<:remShit:444873255824916487>
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I actually just like Calc in general
Integration is fun
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
That's a good description of Quints but not integration
And yeah, they're just using it because it looks like II
Alternatively we could argue that the animators just thought it was very derivative <:heh:789431887135113241>
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
also, technically I think it should be (cx+d)Quints since the double integral is after
Since cx+d is pretty much just variables you can just contact it to c. Since you could just set d to be whatever you want and c to be 0 to get the normal f(x)+c effect. Even if you write it as f(x)+cx+c you can use the transformation c>c/(x+1) to get the equation back to the for f(x)+c anyway.
<:ChrisPout:660514247733674021>
And no-one can stop me
Gonna start referring to Quintuplets S2 as Quints^3/6+c
<:YAMERO:716465855717965835>
‚à´‚à´ This has a mathematical meaning
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
The fact that Quintuplets saw the integral symbol and chose to use it for their season 2 tilts me so bad
It's shorts, so you can probably watch in an afternoon
https://tenor.com/view/yuru-camp-nadeshiko-anime-bump-to-m-irror-gif-12003921

The Beastars OP is so good though
It's so cursed
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Understandable <:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
<:HomuHorny_MM:728011973995790416>
You can recommend it her since everyone's terminally horny
<:KyuContract_MM:406514222717992961>
Believe it or not they got 0 complaints
That's a thing that happened
Yep
<:nadeBlank:488874851214295040>
I don't need this, I'm already planning to watch Ex Arm
I'll be honest, after watching the trailer I'm just not at all interested
Nope, didn't even have my eye on it
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Man, the original anime this season just hasn't been landing for me at all. Other than Ura Sekai it's just been various shades of meh to literal trash and even Ura Sekai's being held back somewhat by its own production
I already knew it was going to happen, it was too obvious
<:KyuContract_MM:406514222717992961>
She's not the sort to lose her head when things get tough
Binge it all <:YEP:727998062039007273>

|| <:MamiHasNoHead2_MM:588882044113780752> ||
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Because I'm curious to see what else anyone who worked on ImoImo could produce
What anime are we actually talking about BTW?

<:wrongHoleOniiChan:527844409358680074>
That's actually ImoImo
Oh fuck
<:sweat:457717850220658688>
Anime with imouto in the title
so you only need to watch the 3rd
There's three movies but the first two are recaps
Yes
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
<:Homura:382191550530060288>
Best girl shows up in ep 1, so yes
<a:MamiClap_MM:623955013986811924>
and those are all fantastic <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Considering she did Araburu, Maquia (literally my favourite movie), Anohana and played a role in some of Aria
Gonna have to hard disagree on that one
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
New Wixoss season felt like it wanted to have a semi-constant ruleset then gave up half way through the ep
Yeah, Shaft's artistic direction is always strong
Yes
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Why is half of this short the VAs talking shit in post credits
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
https://animethemes.moe/video/Horimiya-ED1.webm
I really like the artistic direction on this
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
So that's a win
I got mine for $4 off Aliexpress
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
No mousepad's worth that
So uhhh
Would have got a Chris one, but they're like $300
<:Homura:382191550530060288>
I have a Homura mousepad, so I've invested in best girl
<a:HomuDance_MM:629653836683935744>
This is why I said Homura was best girl
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
<a:ichiCry:789514377781837824>
I actually love tragedy
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I can work with either
Technically Uma Musume is an idol anime I like
<:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
I'll check that one out
So that's probably the best day for me
I think I get Higurashi, Yuru Camp and most likely Beastars since TLs need time to work all on one day
<a:LULOMEGA:394558015166087178>
but then the animation
I mean, the song's actually great
truly amazing
Just the guy giving the unflinching death stare at the start
https://animethemes.moe/video/ExArm-OP1.webm
I don't know where to start with this one
<:monkaMEGA:416557044754153472>
Oh no, Ex Arm's up
I'm so sad about almost all of the new anime from this season though and I think that's the only thing so far that's actually exceeded the expectations I had for it.
Yeah
To tell you who's streaming
I think there's a site for that though
<:ARRYAYA:470759923823804417>
Yeah, it's looking at least decent though
Had a lot of TTGL/KLK vibes
Did anyone else watch Back Arrow? Actually surprisingly decent given what a shitfest new anime this season has been so far.
Chonky boy
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
They probably should have bought a PC to animate on rather than a PS2 as well
It's just inept enough to be enjoyable
Look, this is a fun hot mess
And yeah Ash, CR's originals have been pretty dogshit recently. This one's 1000x more watchable than Gibiate though, it's actually kinda funny.

<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Oh, I enjoyed that anime
I'm actually starting to like Teio a lot

https://twitter.com/WEP_anime/status/1348586703800320001?s=19
I still have no idea what the hell this is, but I'm looking forward to it
Like, there's questions but it doesn't feel confusing to me in the same way as say, ID Invaded did
||My assumption there would be that it has something to do with the murder itch thing. Rika doesn't seem fully aware of it with the whole "trust Reina" thing, something she wouldn't have said had she been fully aware of the situation. The itch also varies across timelines, which suggests to me that it could be a result of another person looping and altering something||
yeah
I mean, I haven't really had a problem understanding it honestly
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Is Higurashi that bad
It looked a lot better honestly
<:YuzuPonder:430875283860750347>
They actually bothered blending the CGI in Urasekai's second ep
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Yeah, MAL already has Ex Arm at the worst rated full series despite it honestly not being that bad compared to some of the shit I've seen
Probably because I watched a hell of a lot of independent film in my teens and they really like to use heavy symbolism. Well, the good ones anyway.
I've never had a problem with the symbolism at all
<:ShirabeMad:688188118087499792>
and I like the symbolism
I like Ikuhara
Which is definitely a good thing
for some reason it kinda has some Ikuhara vibes to me
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Which I'm sure like 3 other people here have seen
The anime it reminded me the most of was Penguin Drum
The ||Lily>yuri one is generally pretty well known. If you see a lot of lilies in an anime with tons of female characters that heavily implies that there's some yuri there. I mean, yuri is actually the Japanese word for lily.||
There's spoilers in that link
<https://formeinfullbloom.wordpress.com/2021/01/12/flower-language-in-wonder-egg-priority/>
Did you catch the ||number of lilies|| in the ep?
That's how everyone feels, DW
It's definitely not something you're meant to fully understand at this point
And their the only new anime I even really care about this season
At the moment it's like Wonder Egg>>>>>Urasekai>Back Arrow>Horimiya
From a personal standpoint I don't consider AOT as it's both a sequel and actually from last season. Couldn't finish Skinfinity, just no interest in skating. Horimiya's OK, but the first ep didn't go anywhere.
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Also, Wonder Egg is very good
Gay girls with heterochromia seems like a surprisingly popular design this season <:LuL:789259461470322728>
That anime is like, the thing I want to watch the least on this world
That's always how we've done it
What do you mean now?
<:egg3:700716577305395200>
<:Thinkness:518151525886066688>
when it's done well
I actually love trash
See, here's the thing
<a:loliDance:447728413722017804>
I watched it all
<a:sagiriJudge:448156131152625676>
I frequently drop anime after one or less eps
If I watched three eps of every shitty anime I started I'd go insane
I'm not going to sit through a torrent of trash just because source readers say it gets better later, every time I've tried that it hasn't.
Besides, I frequently judge anime off of their first eps
Yes, and it's an opinion that most people who watched the episode left it with. That's because a single episode like this can frame an argument like that in certain ways. In this case because the male MC's point of view is so obviously and blatantly wrong it keys the audience to agree with the female's opinion, especially since the ways it's wrong are overall far more subtle.
The problem is that at least the first ep basically poses the female MC's point of view as correct, but I actually find it to be deeply problematic
So yeah, didn't like it at all.
It had a very "how do you do, fellow gamers?" feel. The MC was just a fucking cringefest and I couldn't stand watching him, but the main girl wasn't much better. It's obvious why the MC wasn't right in his views but the female MC also had a very problematic point of view. The "anyone can do things if they try" point of view is honestly just as laughable as the MCs.
and it's probably my most disliked show so far this season
I watched that
Yeah, Bottom Tier Character
Everything else has just been meh as fuck to me
Honestly, there's only really four new shows I'm at all interested in this season so far. Wonder Egg, Horimiya, Urasekai Picnic and Back Arrow
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
That's 6 scores
Early gear is better
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Man, I love when I make an inflammatory statement then have to retroactively change my scoring to support it <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Yeah, 0.1 is the lowest you can score on anilist
There's my 10s
too much Trigger for me
I think I have it at about a 6
OK, Sora Yori that low offends me
Mistakes were made
Yes
Every anime I've rated 3 or under
but like, not great
It was OK
Well
at all
I didn't like it very much
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Wouldn't know because it hasn't even played yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8X5hG51jbA
Apparently this is Re:Zero's OP
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Wait till you get to the season long debate about whether the real thing or a perfect fake holds more value
Kaiki's soliloquy is my favourite scene ever and no-one's changing my mind
<a:DentalHygiene:567655922734989353>
Yeah, standing around and talking is the best part
I'm just going to not get myself into that one
Look, I had a Nadeko PFP before I ever even watched Gear
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
<:yuuAAAA:653314497007845426>
It's just Nino's trash
See, the thing is I actually like tsunderes
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Quints is just making me hate Nino more with every ep
But does it contain heavy machinery?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBIqQQGOM9s
well yes, that's a thing too
Other than that, Revue Starlight and Madoka Records both have some amazing transformations
https://vimeo.com/229823002
May I introduce you to the best transformation sequence in anime, Mawaru Penguindrum
What I'm saying isn't that the series itself is shounen though, I'm saying that the narrator feels like he's ripped directly from a shounen
Shounen isn't a look, it's a target demographic
And the inclusion of the narrator makes the series feel a lot more in-line with other shounen series than it otherwise would
No, but it's something endemic to shounen
It's why I tend not to like shounen generally
I just find that sort of voice/over energetic stuff to be annoying
The narrator actually annoys the hell out of me
Inject it into my veins
||I'm ready for this series to get very, very gay||
but yeah, Wonder Egg is very good
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
Slightly annoyed by the self insert and the doormat in romance but Adachi/Shima get passed up
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I'm pretty sure Glass Reflection called them out on it on the stage too
That was actually a thing
yes
It's CR
They put Ains from Overlord as an antag
I mean
<:PepeHands:358698235923136530>
I wanted some cute girl anime on there, there was actually good ones last year
Not the kind of anime I actually get
Only good surprise on there
Glad to see Minare Koda's VA up for best VA though
He's better than anyone there
Honestly, CR could have shown that they've grown their understanding of what an antagonist is by including Louis from Beastars
Like, Echidna's OK but she's more of a meme than an antagonist
The only antag I even like from that list was Akito
and the second because why is this a catagory?
The first because the villains are paper thin
Honestly, it really shouldn't be nominated in either of them though
Can you like, read what I posted after that?
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Honestly, I think I gave the most votes to Bakarina
The latter of which is laughable
I think it's only up for like, best fight and best antag
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
People get too pissed when it wins
MHA doesn't get nominated anymore
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
https://www.crunchyroll.com/en-gb/anime-news/2021/01/15/anime-awards-voting-is-open-meet-this-years-nominees
Crunchy Roll recognises the same 5 anime in every category again
<:HaneCute:640613599881986076>
She's so damn cute
I love her so much
Vivid however
The movies were OK
maybe taking your niche series and making it even more niche isn't smart
It's a bold move, but no-one really seems to like it
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Who looked at Wixoss and thought "this needs more idols"
Just why though?
I have no idea what the hell the Wixoss team were thinking, but they've found a way to retroactively make Lostorage look better I guess
Holy hell
PAS put way too much time into typesetting this Beastars ep
Theoretically S;G might be up there but I watched it so long ago and haven't rewatched so I'm not quite sure
I think my top 5 are
1. Monogatari series
2. A Place Further than the Universe
3. Toradora
4. Tsuki ga Kieri
5. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu
Oh boy, that's the strangest piece of anime censorship I've ever seen
I'm curious about this
Japan's getting hit hard by Covid right now
<:ChrisYikes:679341065878241292>
My favourite reaction to this was "It's a new anime original about boys transforming into Jojo characters"
Urasekai Picnic
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
This is amazing
<:AYAYA:617604467164184586>
yes
but also
yes
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Yeah, it's not worth getting hyped for yet
Ex Arm ep 2 spoilers, but like, why was this censored exactly?
Touma's also just extremely boring
<:nadeOWO:598369073943937034>
I still have most of the Monogatari series sitting on my hard drive
Also, it's funny, Index 3 was just sad
So in some ways I actually think it's doing better than Index 3
but coherent
It's not good
and also, Ex Arm's plot is like, coherent
The world building's meaningless to me if you don't have a competent plot or characters
Thing is, I don't care how much world building it does
I'm mostly interested in character and plot, and Index really falls flat on both of those. The last season was borderline incoherent and the characters bore me to death. I pretty much consider the show a memewatch on par with Ex Arm at this point <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Index is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a puddle
They very much have opposite approaches and I personally favour the hell out of AdaShima's
<:comf:789441906018222080>
It's good
My favourite shounen is actually Noragami
No, but it wasn't good
The 4th season was a disaster
I don't actually think it's even good anymore
My opinion of MHA has dropped with each season post the second
Everyone who doesn't love it dropped it in the first season
The only people still watching Gintama love it
Gintama's a different case IMO
MAL has a huge shounen bias
It's pretty obvious if you go back and watch something like Strawberry Panic
Traditionally both were made for women
üöÜ
actually
Is pretty solid
Araburu Kisetsu
It's uh, not the best though
It's pretty romance heavy
I guess
We had Yesterday wo Utatte
Like, my three favourite yuris are all between now and 2018
Honestly though, yuri romance has been top tier the last couple of years
Nope, it's just a thing
IDK if that was earlier or later though
Wotakoi?
It's a Picasso reference
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
I'm always down for drama
Saw it earlier and thought it looked interesting
https://anilist.co/anime/128705/Blue-Period/
Does anyone have any idea what this is?
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Yeah, me and some friends who have never watched any Conan decided to get together for the 1000th ep
<a:breathing:436495533977370624>
I know which I'd prefer
In the time it takes to watch One Piece you could watch Citrus 80 times
I don't really do traditional battle shounen
Kanojo Okarishimasu is better than Tomozaki
Right now
Ehhhh
Also Inari Konkon is a pretty good uplifting anime from what I remember
I really liked it
Yeah, it was the Kirara adaptation last season
That was pretty damn heavy on the yuri
Did you watch Fruit Tart though Carol?
I am very hyped for S2
I can recommended Sakura Trick
In that case
<a:miowink:424741626259308556>
I can recommend any number of completely vapid feel-good cute girl anime with yuri undertones if you'd like
https://tenor.com/view/gekkan-shoujo-nozakikun-nozaki-sakura-gif-5467633
Gekkan Shoujo
Probably one of my all time favourites
It is
Seems like something you'd like a lot based off what you're saying
Oh Dude, just checking. You've seen Rakugo Shinjuu right?
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I really don't have many issues with the MC honestly. I would if they didn't build up characterisation for her as the show went on because her base character is very much female stereotypes but she actually does things that break the more passive protag thing as the show continues
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
Doesn't bother me Carol
Hasn't ended yet but it's confirmed it's going to
<:nadeLove:486352799114985484>
Fruits Basket
Oh, also, the best romance anime of recent years
<:comf:789441906018222080>
But I also enjoy dumpsterfires
I'm enjoying the hell out of Ex Arm
Gamers was a clusterfuck
He went from asocial gamer to asocial gamer with a harem for some reason
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
But it is very good
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Honestly, the second season of SNAFU is the only one that I actually rate highly
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Hard disagree on that one, he's like Hachiman but the author missed that Hachiman has depth
<:comf:789441906018222080>
So at least I have one good romance this season
I like Horimiya though
Ehhh, I'd generally rate an anime that makes me feel something above one that bores me to sleep
Even if that something was overwhelming anxiety
I mean, at least Kanokari made me feel something other than just cringe
It's just I think Tomozaki is really, really bad
To be clear, I don't think Kano is good
yeah, I'm always down for that though

https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-01-19/tantei-wa-mo-shindeiru-mystery-romantic-comedy-light-novels-listed-with-tv-anime/.168577
Interested in this one
Personally I think the CGI titans look fine, but the CGI scouts were pretty jank.
nice
Wow, the Azur Lane short series makes me feel like human trash
are abysmal
and direction
It's just the models
I don't think the budget's low. The mo-cap is actually fantastic
You'd think
If they do games they should understand how to use CGI at least a little
honestly, that doesn't make it less confusing
yeah

<:OrigamiWow:622646877044604941>
Origami's invading other anime again
<:KaosSmileFang:444799827805601803>
What a day
Culture chat here, culture chat in shitposting
The jury nomination's shit in places too
But the choices were shit
I think I went Beastars
Last year's r/anime awards were pretty decent
They really fucked up some things this year
Yeah
So I went with Bakarina again
I personally hate Tsukasa/Nasa
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
AdaShima not even an option for best couple
For everything
Vote Bakarina
Yes
A chrome app
The image is actually huge


Here's mine
Yesterday wo Uttate is one of the most botched shows I've ever seen
because like
Personally I would have not voted if that was the case
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Yesterday wo Utatte
Yes
The VA carried that entire show
The best VA performance was actually Minare
Beastar's OPs are both so good
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
It wasn't even good
Appare Ranman in AotY is so random too
It was 3/3
Nope
Look at romance
It's the least interesting because it's a show that's focused entirely on something that isn't interesting. Fight scenes.
I called it the least interesting
I didn't watch it nor call it the worst
GoH has to be the least interesting anime of last year to me
Yes, I find them boring too
Or the one where they're given orders by a talking wall
Like the one from the perspective of a fan
I've mostly just seen weird idol anime
Oshi ga Budoukan next Carlos
<:tsukihiPeek:567655914270883870>
Nor have I
Blursed as hell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XBzeBIWv_Q
<a:DentalHygiene:567655922734989353>
Fruit Tart was a CGDCT anime with an idol skin though
I really like Lapis
The show says there's a problem, I'm questioning the show's point of view
How is that not problematic?
And again, watch the politics of this. We're talking about someone talking about setting up a welfare state and the problem with this is "leaches".
What authority did the round table have to call itself a legitimate government and what had they actually done for the people? It's not like they're an elected body and we saw that poverty and despair were rampant. A governing body like that deserves to be overthrown.
Welfare is literally the act of taking money, as acquired by taxes disproportionately payed by those with the most wealth and distributing it to those without wealth. This is what Eins suggests. The form of tax he suggests is essentially a wealth tax.
This is what we call welfare
What he suggested was basically equivalent to a wealth tax and redistributive welfare. Policy I do not think is a bad thing. When I see a character who believes in that fighting for it they're kinda shaded more as just to me
But that's already starting from the point of view that the round table is default right. If the round table is wrong then that doesn't make accepting a noble title inherently a bad thing. 

The point that I'm making here is that the anime seems to be taking a "welfare is bad" point of view and for me personally that's drawing a bit of a rift since I find that an abhorrent idea. It kinda threatens the fabric of the show for me since it makes Eins' ||betrayal of the round table|| look like a good thing.

Again, this is something that could change, but the way the show's been portraying it makes me think that it won't.
There's also threads of ||Eins is just a foreign puppet and that makes him wrong about everything XD|| going on at the same time
I saw after the ending, but like, ehh
If they flip that around then it could work, but I'm not so sure they will
It's a flaw if they continue to portray the round table as correct and Eins as the villain as they have for the last two eps
or expect it to
and there's still room to fix this, it's just that I don't trust the series to actually do so
Which is why I really find myself agreeing with the antagonist here, he's kinda just right that they need to actually use their power to do something
There is kinda a bad and good to some degree though, policies that plunge a high percentage of the population into abject poverty and despair like the ones that the round table endorse by not acting are just bad
At least from what I assume, I'll see what happens next ep
The issue is that so far I've actually found the antagonist to make more decent points and the protagonists to generally just be headass
My PFP is freaking Nadeko
Like
I don't mind talky anime
Honestly Log Horizon 3 is losing me a bit
<:RemTPosing:588087948788891654>
T pose at the haters
<a:YuzuHype:411782417267949569>
https://anilist.co/anime/128757/TaiAri-deshita-Ojousama-wa-Kakutou-Game-Nante-Shinai/
New Yuri series
You work on the execution
Like, the issue with that is that even if you have a good idea with bad execution you don't just shoot down the idea
because I think the point of view held by the author is very problematic
I do not think there was a problem
I do not think the rejection was valid
Their 3rd anime this season is The Promised Neverland
<a:gurabaaa:755828562992431234>
I saw a review on it
Is so bad
Right here
https://anilist.co/anime/108388/Choujin-Koukouseitachi-wa-Isekai-demo-Yoyuu-de-Ikinuku-you-desu/
This piece of shit
I can recommend some you will hate
<:nadeLove:486352799114985484>
But Bakarina is objectively best
Best isekai you say
<:Thinkness:518151525886066688>
Hmm, I think you have a very different perception of Urasekai than I do
Golden Kamuy comes to mind
I can think of a few series with fantastic flashback eps
It's pretty slow burn
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
I love anime like Chihayafuru and Sangatsu
Slow burn is my thing
I kinda struggle to put it in a more critical way, because it's basically just "yeah, I enjoy the show"
For me Aya I'm very interested in the world they're building. I'm liking that it's not a normal/predictable anime and personally I'm liking both of the characters so far.
Gigguk's a good meme
He's much closer to a traditional film critic to like, Gigguk
He's like, the only decent anituber
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVvmh0Rg9dQ
GR does a good job explaining what some of the problems with the series are.
It also doesn't help when anime like Shield Hero get held up as being actually good
It has less to do with the potential and more to do with the fact that an insane amount of isekai is just mass produced crap
like, even for an isekai
Isekai Cheat Magician is pretty abysmal too
helps to have negative expectations
I don't get disappointed by isekai
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
And that's all I could ever see that character as when I watched
And what stuck out to me is the reviewer describing one of the characters as "chuuni Pete Buttigieg"
In like a worst seasonal anime list
before I watched it
It's also trash though
Very
Yes
What a world
AoT really went from only the Colossal titan being CG to only Colossal being hand drawn.
They did a good job at mocap, and literally nothing else
I guess
At least it's smaller this time
<a:KirikaPlead:802213360334012416>
I just want to see every part animated
Is great at everything it does
Again
Sangatsu no Lion
It is fantastic though
Na, Baccano's just non-linear
<:MonaCry:754291948147441694>
Oof, that Koisuru ranking
Problem solved
Also, this is the ED, and I don't care what you were expecting, it wasn't this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFrwvyHVHe8
https://anilist.co/anime/100762/Tachibanakan-to-Lie-Angle/
The one legit yuri harem anime I've ever seen
Or whatever it was called
Also, they had Tachibanakan Triangle
I'm interested though
Cute girls doing LSD
yep
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
So is Yurikuma
I love the Kase san OVA
Yeah
<:YuzuPonder:430875283860750347>
Looking at this prehaps Maiden's should have been in not CGDCTs
https://tenor.com/view/saido-chesto-machio-kazzter-dumbbels-anime-gif-16026924
<:SagiriBleh:341060865547829248>
fantastic watermark
There we go
I found it
Yeah
Urasekai Picnic is there too
Also yeah
I can't find K-On
I don't recognise half of them
Also Ash, no
It's adjacent, but like, it's notably different
Yeah, I put that firmly in "Not CGDCTs"
Have fun
https://tiermaker.com/create/definitive-cgdct-tier-list-116194
<@!171395487247630336>
Kanon, Clannad and Little Busters work because they have long AF runtimes
His earlier stuff absolutely, but like, The Day I Became God just wasn't good
IDK, Jun Maeda's recent works haven't been very good honestly
There's also one in Kanon, which is part of the reason I love that anime so much
One of the few scenes that can reliably make me cry though
<a:CryBabyGif:562737712428482571>
Mata Ne
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbIKiZfGRgU
This scene though
I'd go with Kou personally
But Dropout?
OK, I get New Game/K-On
I'm very partial to Aria amongst Iyashikei
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
The best CGDCTs anime is still Antarctica though
literally everything's on my PTW list

Which on Millhi, it's probably on PTW
Koisuru is actually more on the dramatic side
Yeah, there's dramatic and comedic SoL
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
You'd hate Manaria Friends
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
na, I'm good
We taking Teio out back?
Horsegirl idol racing
Good staff and 24 ep runtimes
well, yeah, that too
But like, he needs something different
Because I know he can be
I really want Maeda to be good
I think something that's really interesting is comparing the ending of The Day I Became God to ||Makoto's|| arc in Kanon though. Kinda made more sense to me what he was trying to do with that arc when I thought about it that way, it just doesn't work at all because of the difference in the way the MCs act.
I knew they did Kanon
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Toei did a Clannad
KyoAni has a lot of their own writers internal IIRC
Shame it'll never happen
But yeah, I'd love to see Jun Maeda work with KyoAni again
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Little Busters is JC Staff and it still works
<a:KoyoTiltAnim:403747352050925568>
Bath scenes without philosophy just feel wrong
There's just way too much shounen
One of the few original anime I actually enjoy this season
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
It's very good
Instructions unclear

Yeah, I'm enjoying this anime way too much
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
You can't just end on that
Oh no, that Wonder Egg ep
It's good exposition though
Wonder Egg is actually the best thing airing right now

Super sticky stuff, kinda need it because glutton's the thing that holds most flour products together
The main thing that held Assault Lily back was runtime honestly
I'd love a S2
Good
Shaft's thing next season is a lot more interesting
But I enjoyed it
Nothing groundbreaking
It's fun
I'ma bet that the title is more entertaining than the show

Light Novel title coming through
https://tenor.com/view/sam-bri-kkt-kool-kidz-kool-kidz-table-gif-20048899
I think Gekkan Shoujo is my all time favourite comedy
Hinamatsuri is nice
I just find Konosuba pretty average
Personally I'd say Re:Zero, Hamefura and Bookworm
Pretty much everything else is meh as hell
Re:Zero is solid, Bakarina is solid, Bookworm is great
Yeah, I'm not really interested in watching isekai
~~that emote just reminds me too much of Mel~~
<a:ShirabeBonk:801207951645605958>
~~give me my Yaga Kimi S2 already~~
I want more romance too though
Not interested
Ehhh
I ended up dropping it
Yeah, wouldn't be suprised
Is it CGDCTs?
Ash, you watched Kuma Bear right?
Those are genres
The tags are below that
Yeah
https://anilist.co/anime/108268/Honzuki-no-Gekokujou-Shisho-ni-Naru-Tame-ni-wa-Shudan-wo-Erandeiraremasen/
The fact that Bookworm actually has a CGDCTs tag is so cursed
most of the actually decent ones have character goals
Having a goal doesn't make something not CGDCTs
Can I introduce you to the best CGDCTs anime where the entire runtime of the show is spent progressing towards a single goal, A Place Further than the Universe?
It just wouldn't work
Imagine New Game but everyone who isn't Aoba sucked
Good CGDCTs anime have a lot of interesting characters
That's the thing though
CGDCTs thrives off of its cast of characters and interactions. I knew Kuma wasn't worth it from ep 1 because it was framing itself too heavily around the MC, which meant a weaker sidecast compared to a show like New Game or even Average Abilities.
yeah, I tend to watch most seasonal anime socially too
yeah, I struggle to get into manga too
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
but I only ever see praise for
Which I think I hated more than just about any other romance I've ever watched
I had that last season with Tonikaku Kawaii Fenny
Horimiya's nice, but so far it's been nothing really special
I want to catch up on all my anime
I'm going to start that tonight I think
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
And put into a 3DCG scene
The character looks like he was just ripped out of the Tatami Galaxy
I just don't get why they didn't just 3DCGI that guy
Yeah
Why
<:tsukihiPeek:567655914270883870>
Best technically a harem
I posted Gatari for a reason
https://tenor.com/view/araragi-monogatari-series-dancing-anime-gif-15674642
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Like, maybe hire an animator rather than background designers
If they had decent models and animators on staff it actually probably could have ended up looking pretty solid
The absolute most frustrating part about Ex Arm is that the animation's actually a lot less janky than most 3DCGI anime
Reverse harem is better than normal harem
<:BayonetHug:745998190339424337>
Childhood friend is a good civ though
Ono's my second favourite
It's just hard not to be a Chitoge fan when she's a cute AF tsundre and her design is iconic as hell
https://tenor.com/view/nisekoi-chitoge-kirisaki-smug-grim-smirk-gif-16362292
Fight me
Also, Oreimo is a legit good harem anime
https://tenor.com/view/nisekoi-kirisaki-chitoge-blush-frustrated-gif-5559082
I want a Chitoge
<:chitoHat:613142491658715146>
Nisekoi
Do you know what's actually a really good Harem?
Oh
<:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
The old Key harem anime are great if you like the feeling of crushing despair
Personally I love it
Old KyoAni/Key artstyle
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Kanon?
I love Kanon way too much
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
God, I really always just go for the tsundere don't I
<a:sagiriDance:655441921358954537>
Because Sagiri is clearly best girl
I mean, it's OK to be wrong
<:YuunaHappy:458510270826938368>
Want to talk about actual culture? Yuuna and the Haunted Hotsprings
and the third is terrible
The first is meh
The second season of Oregairu is fantastic
Bake/Nise aren't as good as the second/final season content
The thing is, it copied the weakest part of Gatari
<:nadeSmug:488675594184425482>

There's 6 anime I have as a 10 and Toradora's one of them
Toradora's one of my top anime
<a:taigaClap:789514877894524980>
Ehhh, Toradora's generally a pretty well regarded show
Do they?
And it will be glorious
One of these days I'ma sit down and read Dom Kano
~~I'd actually kill for a Dom Kano S2 though~~
I rest my case
https://tenor.com/view/persona-kawakami-dating-teacher-persona5-gif-18849912
Oh right, no-one mentioned the best harem ever
Of which one is memorable
Reminder that someone thought Oreimo was worth reanimating the OP every episode and making almost 30 eds for
<:kirinoPeace:450164782654291979>
Also, watch Oreimo
She's what people claim Taiga to be
I literally cannot watch any more of her
yep
Guess?
Yeah, I'ma go sleep soon too
Who is trash
That's my opinion on a certain Quint

and yeah, fantastic series
Add to that that most of the girls are instantly hateable
I just feel like "what if 5 identical girls" is a huge downgrade to a genre that really didn't need any downgrades to begin with
I don't
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Unless it's Nisekoi, it's been like 6 years and I still see people wanting a S3 for that
It's like everyone just forgot that anime even existed
In no small part because I don't even see fans of the anime really pushing for it
Gonna be honest
I don't think that's likely
ah
BSJ?
Same writer I believe
Also, it's not really unique, it's very similar in a lot of ways to Baccano
<:nadeLove:486352799114985484>
Kyouko

I really don't think BGS has anything that comes close to the brilliance of Nadeko Medusa and Hitagi End though
Like, in my mind Wonder Egg is carrying this season to an insane degree right now and the rest of the shows are really dwarfed by even a weaker season like the last one and that's mostly just because I put a much lower value on sequels than most people seem to.
even if those sequels are good
To me a season that's all sequels is really, really boring
I'm just not as interested in most sequels
Everything else has been 1-2 standout new anime then just super flat
I actually don't think there's been a particularly good season of anime since fall 2018 though
Completely serviceable
They're just fine
Unspectacular as in there's just not much to it. It's not got fantastic characters IMO either
but I consider it to be a fairly unspectacular romance
I guess I should give Horimiya some credit

This season's only notable non-sequels are Urasekai and Wonder Egg, and Urasekai's like, above average
Last season wasn't good, but like

I had more last season
But I don't even think it's that strong of a season
I have 17
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Only 11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qlssPLILJE
Solid dumpsterfire
Ex Arm's pretty high up in terms of enjoyment though
I think for just new anime for me it's
Wonder Egg>Urasekai>Horimiya>Back Arrow>Design Bu>Ex Arm
Who even needs other anime when you have Uma Musume
üê¥
Time for the actual best anime this season
It has the potential to go very similarly to this season though. Lots of interesting/potential shows but very little that I'm sure of.
There's a few potentially interesting things next season
This season's also the first season in my memory without a new seasonal CGDCTs anime, which really hurts it for me.
Thing is, I dropped or just don't care about over half of the shows you just listed. Theres 6 new seasonals that I'm watching this season, which is already a pretty pathetic number, but I don't even think two of them are actually very good. That's why this season feels weak to me. Even last season I think I watched about 10 or so new anime, more good new anime than this season too.
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
XDU anime when
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
<a:miowink:424741626259308556>
Best girl in K-on is Mio though
Now that's a dumpsterfire worth watching
You should watch Domestic Kanojo
<:nadeLove:486352799114985484>
Teio
Spiders are cute
<:awwDuck:463096391452065792>
God, I love Teio's design
Would you download a car?
<:HomuHorny_MM:728011973995790416>
Oh boy, that one shot in the World Witches next ep preview
It's very good
Yes, yes you should
<:monanote:782563953154588702>
Very interesting character
Yeah, I really want to know more about Momoe
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
I wish there was more good time travel anime though
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Wait till you get to Zero
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Because jesus, I have so many old seasonals to finish
Meanwhile I'm just sitting here finishing Maesetsu
I really want to rewatch S;G soon, but I'm admittedly a little worried I won't like it as much as I did the first time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpqjSrRY2sg
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
I really love the facial expressions in this one
I can understand why most people didn't like it though
<:YuzuPonder:430875283860750347>
Maesetsu is a very interesting anime and I'm actually enjoying the second half a lot
I think they'll use it soon honestly
They just haven't used it yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp7l9oolXS0
There's totally an OP for ReZero S2P2 BTW
Indeed it does
Probably got given an episode limit to finish in
But I wasn't expecting it to be this good
I had a feeling it was going to be good from the PV
No
But that doesn't make S4's CGI better
So have I
I know it's an opinion that can get you crucified, but some of the CGI in AoT S4 has been so bad it's just taken me completely out of episodes
I was going to say Wonder Egg is the clear best so far
Yeah
It's not even the best AoT
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Do people actually think AoT S4 is the best anime ever
S3 never CGI the freaking scouts
I hard disagree
S3 did not have worse CGI
Wow, that just makes me hate it more
The difference between WEP and MT is that WEP doesn't try to justify anything
Did you miss the whole teacher subplot <:LuL:789259461470322728>
It's not
No
uhhhh
<:SagiriBleh:341060865547829248>
I don't think I want to know more about MT
I'll check this later

wait

At least the shitposters get more content though
A Wateten movie is pretty damn high up
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/ldxj0f/wataten_an_angel_flew_down_to_me_movie_visual/
List of things I didn't expect
Most of the characters in Manyuu Hikenchou
Finally getting around to Durarara. Seems pretty good so far.
After watching a ton of ecchi I can say that Manyu has the least attractive artstyle of any I've watched honestly
I mean, Fuuko's arc hit me like a ton of bricks too
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
What do you want to groupwatch
<a:YuzuHype:411782417267949569>
Re:Zero OP is a thing
It's so funny though
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
So they just blinked them into position
Oh god, Ex Arm's needed models to move in a way they couldn't
Starlight is fantastic
~~why do I do this to myself~~
Welp, time for more Ex Arm
Is going from idol to space fisherman a promotion or not?
<:ChrisPout:660514247733674021>
All fingers are thumbs, not all thumbs are fingers
It's like a law of the universe
Pretty much every shitty anime has either a fantastic OP or ED
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5yq0g8meq4
The ED is fantastic
There's a cute girl anime for that
https://anilist.co/anime/99639/Sora-to-Umi-no-Aida/

<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Tuna are huge
Yep
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
God, the damn Honda ad looks better than most of the anime next season
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbWU6B0qjMY
I really like this PV for some reason
<:ShirabePlease:724034356192215081>
I do hope the PriPri movie is available early though, I'd really like to watch it
Simulcasts of movies are much rarer than series
yeah, generally it takes a while before bluray releases and fansubs
<:ARRYAYA:470759923823804417>
It'll be on the web eventually
That's the big issue
He wrote the rules
So far as I'm concerned it's beyond an unforgivable action
The issue is that what he did here moves him to the most vile of villain categories for me.
So, my problem with the last arc in general ||is that one side basically wrote the rules of the election in a way that would ensure them victory. They then proceed to push the rules as far as they could be pushed and I'd argue break the spirit of the rules if not the letter. They crack down on 3rd party candidates, even if that candidate was basically a joke candidate they should be allowed to run. What the Round Table did isn't politics, it's corruption. And they're meant to be the heroes? Just, this arc hasn't sat well with me in the slightest and has mostly just made me despise Shiroe.||
I really wasn't at all a fan of it
It just comes later
The reason why Hikari doesn't want Karen to join makes sense in the anime too
I also love Hikari
She's so good
Also Nana is one of my favourite characters
<a:BanaNice:501549702383140865>
I need to sleep soon
I've got like one more thing to say
In what way?
His plan was literally ||to undermine a democratic election||
He wrote the rules to be unfair
<a:BanaNice:501549702383140865>
I told you Nana was the best girl
Next season's actually starting too look pretty interesting
These got announced like an hour ago or something
Yeah
Which if you're going to do an isekai
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neuik8auVmE
Also romance isekai with some bookworm vibes
I'm in
Looks pretty gay
To be fair that clip is literally the only info about the anime that exists
I mean, I think it is
Yep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGDDcFjCLFU
My attention has been gotten
Yeah, I kinda love that Subaru's only real option is to try everything till he gets out of a fight
<:YuzuPonder:430875283860750347>
About to go watch the first 6 eps of Vlad Love
<:RemEhehe:438605981614735361>
ü•ö
<:MonaOfCulture:776613770226171945>
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
What's ERP, I'm dumb
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
It feels a lot better than most Trigger anime to me
I watched the first 3 eps and was enjoying it
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
Dude, I love this sort of trippy shit
Uni chem, I think it was like 8 mol. Could have actually burned me pretty bad if there were more of it/if I didn't go and wash it off instantly.
<a:karenEhh:567668661716910080>
I mean, it's not the most dangerous thing ever, it's on the list of things I've burned myself with
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
It's not funny, just annoying
It'd be a lot better if it had less random slapstick in it though
<:YuzuPonder:430875283860750347>
Finished the first 6 eps of Vlad Love, pretty fun, hope it gets gayer
ü•ö
Egg is good
And it happened every time I worked with chloroform
But the headaches would just wipe me out for a night then I'd wake up still with a headache the next morning
I'd probably agree with you if the burn was worse
the fumes give me the worst headache ever
Is so bad
Genetics labs an chloroform
It's not even the worst thing I've had in a lab though
<:ababa:789441747678920735>
I shouldn't be let near them
good ol' esterification reactions
I only got like two drops on my arm, but it still burned pretty bad
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Avatar feels like an anime and people who like anime will probably like it
Just really good friends
They're just the kind of friends who live together, sleep in the same room and adopt a child
That's why I use the words "strong support", because it makes it very easy to construct an argument in favour and very hard to construct one against
Remember though, in text analysis you can argue quite a lot of things and often things that may be contrary to the actual narrative, because text analysis is weird in some ways.
Yes, being canon would be strong support
https://tenor.com/view/nadeko-sengoku-nadeko-sengoku-monogatari-bakemonogatari-gif-20263353
Popular crackships with next to no text support do exist, but they're generally pretty rare
I'd argue this mostly comes down to support from the text. The ship in Flip Flappers has strong support from its parent text so most people are pretty on board with it. Something like Akane/Rika from Gridman has moderate/weak support, so most are ambivalent towards it on average I'd say. Rei/Asuka has pretty much no support, so not a lot of people would really get on board with it.
Majo no Tabitabi
There was an anime from last year that 100% should have been included and was better than all the choices on that list
So, yeah
Wonder Egg is better than any anime from last year
It's what happens when you take a very generic shounen and slap a racing skin on it
It's actually kinda just a bad show
It's bad
The fact they included Appare Ranman speaks to the quality of last year's anime
I missed it
Nevermind
ah
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Just waiting for best couple now to see if we managed to spam that shit hard enough
Best protag
||Also Fruits Basket got|| Best drama
||BAKARINA WON||
You missed the biggest surprise though
Ye
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Wait, the anime awards actually got something right and didn't just give it to the most popular thing there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dMgps3emY&feature=youtu.be
This exists
In the LN Senju falls down a flight of stairs, Shaft created whatever the hell happened here, Shaft's version is far more iconic
Or like, this scene is the perfect example
Accuracy to the source material doesn't inherently make something good. I don't really care if the newer SNK designs are more accurate to the source, they look worse than the old ones.
<:PapikaPout:380126408418131970>
<:200wave:789443546511835157>
<:shamiBashful:692140408876171284>
Urasekai knows how to do tension the best out of any series I've watched in years
<:ShamiGanbare:633051921560633374>
Also Machikado Mazoku counts
Kill la Kill is a pretty good magical girl anime
Eva is very good
It's not like all they've ever done is cute girl anime
I mean, they made Plastic Memories too, so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Coming from someone who loves pretty much all of the above
And it's actually the best thing they've ever done
Yes, they did this too though
https://anilist.co/anime/20668/Gekkan-Shoujo-Nozakikun/
Funniest anime I've ever seen
You should check Gekkan Shoujo
That show's a trip
You should watch Gal to Kyouryuu too
Best ep yet
Make her watch Monogatari
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
My dad's a Star Trek fan and he's used to people being dicks about the things he likes, so he just lets me and my brother like whatever
Sports anime are fine, when they're not shounen
<:yuzuPeace:401996998527418368>
The first anime I watch (not counting Pokemon and such) was Citrus
I can one-up this
I wish I had childhood memories with anything other than Pokemon/Beyblade/YuGiOh
I didn't get into anime until after I was 20 years old
There's just something a little off about it that I struggle to put my finger on
Yeah, I really don't like Kakeguri at all either
I'm not a huge fan of gore either
Yeah, I feel that chaos
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Just remind her that no-one else actually understands it either
That's fair
yeah
<:karenLove:567655915961188362>
Legit though, some of my favourite authors are female. That's probably because I'm a huge fan of romance and Jossei in general though.
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
and every one of those reasons is wrong
<:KumikoxReina:569311731059523597>
They should follow the source less and make the best ship canon
Watching movies is hard though
I have to watch the Code Geass movie too
I may eventually
ye
I'm too scared to watch the Hibike movie though
Yeah, Liz is fantastic
I need to rewatch Sora Yori again soon though
I'd actually say K-On's the weakest of those three
Definitely Sora Yori for me
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
K-On/Sora Yori/Hibike Eupho
K-On is top 3 CGDCT anime for me
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Why do shounen OPs all sound so generic and similar
~~Bones should kill MHA and just do more Noragami~~
I just didn't like anything about it
S4 was the thing the point the series really started crapping out for me
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Oh god not that arc
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
but most of the OPs are the same damn song
I certainly don't consider MHA to be particularly good. The early seasons are OK, the later seasons are kinda just bad.
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Good Horimiya ep this week
Myuki's the only thing I like about that show though
<:kirinoThink:462470988186124308>
I just assumed it was the normal reason
<:KoyoTilt:489285273625034753>

||I love how the mechanic girl was so worried about having her taken away from her||
yeah

Gridman tripped up at the end?
Gridman's fantastic
I'm super hyped for Dynazenon too
yep
I'm down honestly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2h_--ng8rk
Legit though, what even is this?
<a:oof:509138600571699200>
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Not liking the first 3 is just
I'm just saying I could understand not liking that one
I like it still
but it's the least good
OP 4 is fine
<:mikangry:633117300387741696>
I could understand not liking OP 4, but the first 3 are all fantastic
cause the two Yuki OPs are both amazing
Wait, which OP though?
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>

Good horse girls ep
Beyond anything else you could solve it with a ruler and compass <:LuL:789259461470322728>
It's still not anything near an impossible question though
<:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
You can't have all 4 corners touch the circle
Oh, actually I see what the issue is now
If it's something like that then it's still actually solvable
I mean, it would be if it didn't have a right angle
I missed the side length
in that case then
That's not even spatially possible
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I literally solved it in the 5 seconds it was on screen then went back to check it after
Literally just ||[sqrt(2x^2)]/2||
Wonder Egg ||Anyone else solve the "impossible" maths problem||
That one's getting an anime soon isn't it?
as opposed to Guns n Roses
Guns and Roses
Yeah
You could try Baccano
<a:pepeRain:789438823071088680>
I just love my suffering simulators
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
Shinsekai Yori

Also, does Ash just get pinged when someone mentions Comic Girls

<:KaosPeek:446751166185865232>
Watch Comic Girls
Revue Starlight is very good
<a:KoyoDisco:407300549315133450>

Give me a sec
Pretty sure ID Invaded's OP is about as fucky as Eizoken's
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
ID Invaded has one of the best OSTs I've ever seen though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSDrulGBqK4
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
So are you
<:noU:789441480279982081>
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
ID Invaded is far better
but uhh
At the start of that season I really thought Eizoken was going to be my favourite show
That's the really big issue
Yes, but it essentially reuses the same arc 3 times
and by the end of the show you've seen the same good ideas about 5 times
and again
Then it has them again
It has some good ideas
Personally I have very mixed opinions on Eizoken
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgA7OQCvO8M
<a:OrigamiLurking:669074941810835466>
yes I have
yes
https://tenor.com/view/anime-dumbbell-nan-kilo-moteru-how-heavy-are-the-dumbbells-that-you-lift-muscles-gif-14672596
Just watch Code Geass instead, it's kinda like Gundam but you don't need to spend 3 hours working out what series you were meant to watch first
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
That ep
Oh
and Banana Fish actually
Also, have to get around to watching Given
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Yuri on Ice is actually quite good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSKc6HubBd4
OK, time for one that'll piss someone off
but the show is not good
It's like a straight up Baccano/DRRR/Noragami tier OP
It really is
Also at 0:48
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBbWSxqJSOI
<:heh:789431887135113241>
I'd post MHA in response to that but the OPs aren't even that good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mP5Zjm_jag
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhOSbUIhkbs
Also, this one
Cute girls fishing in space
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5yq0g8meq4
Can I do EDs?
It's just so far below standard for Gatari
Dreamy Date Drive isn't that bad
Actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUv14HK_EUk
Worst Gatari OP
I like Kimi no Sei
Ehhh
are just so generic
Fucking Kokoro Connect OPs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R9VmRtuNwo
the show is meh
That OP is great
Hard disagree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFrwvyHVHe8
Blue Bud Blue is a fantastic OP though
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Look at the capitalised letters
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I kinda like it
Everyone tells me this series is shit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRy1-3X2Rp4
Gonna link the full one for this because the TV one has nudity in it
IKR, what a fall from grace
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrmzXR1sI78
This is probably the king of meh anime with a good OP
Yes
Hensuki's a good series though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6ae9DdLfAE
Kiss x Sis was a ride
and yeah
That's all kinds of cut up
uhh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kxMXRB7czU
Futari no Honey Boy <a:AkariDance:607305712225353728>
It's my kind of trash
I actually want to get around to watching that
<:pain:758429938571018240>
But the series
It's a good OP
my favourite anime movie is Maquia, then probably Tenki no Ko then Liz
Liz is right up there
It's such a unique and interesting song
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jer-_oRfLyg
Golden Time OP 2 just overshadows OP 1 in every way
Actually, my favourite of those movies is probably Tenki no Ko
so hard
But just overshadowed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0qQuMMKGyQ
Not a bad OP
and Pancreas just doesn't really
But like, all of those movies have fantastic OSTs
No, the quality of the movie
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
so yeah, I really like that movie
I put it up with things like Tenki no Ko, Kimi no Na wa and Ko no Katachi
Personally
I consider the movie to be exceptional
It feels super generic for a movie that really deserves better
I'm not a huge fan
Ehhhh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAVskCkYWh8
There's also this I guess
I love the first OP
Just worse than most other OPs from anime I like
It's not bad persay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBbc_xgvZhk
I guess I'm not a huge fan of Nana Iro Symphony
I feel like most of the anime I like actually have pretty good OPs
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
But I like Sk8er boi
<:KanbaW:671732682652254218>
That's my favourite
Uhhhh
probably not in the same way though
I think the most insane anime I've watched is probably Kyousou Giga
A Platypus???
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
The difference is that Fune wo Amu is actually very good
https://anilist.co/anime/21703/Fune-wo-Amu/
Yes
Oh, also, if you ever sat there and thought "I want to watch a show about people writing dictionaries"

Sometimes feels a little Gatari like, just watching one person talk shit for 10 minutes
Oh also, watch Nami yo Kiite, it's kinda a romance/drama type thing (it's very unique) and it's fantastic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RmD365d_-g
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Because who the fuck else would you get to direct this
Yep, directed by the director of Steins;Gate
Surreal yuri romance
https://anilist.co/anime/108487/Fragtime/
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
Check out Frag Time
better than almost any other anime
it just works
but somehow
It's the one anime that when you look at it from pretty much any angle it should be boring, the animation looks like crap and everything just looks like a disaster
I just love it
Tsuki ga Kirei is probably my all time favourite romance
Just because it's so unique
I actually prefer V1 of the OP
but the cost cutting measures are so interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikGR-JVfSf8
Tsuki ga Kirei's OP is pretty whatever musically
If we're including anime sequels then Kizu 3 is pretty up there
~~also, more Twin Turbo please~~
And I really like Rice Shower too actually
I'm a huge Teiou fan honestly
||Even if it's just Teiou suffering simulator||
I'm enjoying this season
üèá
Uma Musume is fun too
I actually think that's one of the show's strong points
Anime like Plastic Memories are honestly best when you do know what's happening and they don't just blindside you with events out of nowhere
That's kinda the point
You didn't guess the ending, it was layed out early in the series
Or like, even 16
Charlotte would have made a great 24 ep show
But that's good to hear
Haven't actually got around to Planetarian yet
The others have been a bit disappointing
Clannad/Kanon/Angel Beats are kinda the good ones
yeah
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Even New Game hit me harder than Eva
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Like, Violet Evergarden, Plastic Memories, Anohana, Clannad/Kanon and YLiA all destroyed me but I think I was actually pretty OK after Eva
Eva actually didn't wreck me the same way some other anime have honestly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvzCmV3_12c
üç°
that show actually does hold up fairly well even today
Aria the Animation
Do you know what was actually the exception to that?
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
God bless Fruits Basket
https://twitter.com/fruitsbasket_en/status/1370298945453314051
Yeah, the twist in PP actually got me without feeling like a complete asspull
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
I hope
https://goodsmileshop.com/en/CATEGORY-ROOT/Nendoroid/Nendoroid-Chris-Yukine/p/GSC_NEN_WD_00366
One day she'll get a rerelease
at least in my experience
Sites like AmiAmi are better than that on shipment too
I did Monogatari in 5 <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Personally the main reason why I enjoyed it at the start is that I just fell in love with Tougou design wise
Then there's Assault Lily
<:comf:789441906018222080>
Also, Release the Spyce
Very good show
Check Princess Principle too
As much as I enjoyed Assault Lily I missed this stuff
https://streamable.com/tsca0t
I'm glad this one actually looks like a Shaft anime
What are you looking for? Because it may be listed under a different title
I feel like the thing next season should be a decent indicator
The actual phrasing they used is "we'll keep adapting as long as Niso keeps writing"
So Off Season will happen eventually
Shaft's confirmed they're going to keep adapting Gatari
Ep 40 is up
God, these subs are so cursed
Yeah, just like Mekakucity Reload
Madoka sequel is confirmed to be in the works IIRC
I guess I should watch Zombie Land soon
My week's biased towards the weekend, but more balanced than this season
OK, I added it
not even on my PTW
<:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
I'm curious
Oh, Ash what cute girl anime were you going to recommend in general earlier
Guess I'll watch
I saw that one
Yeah
Just do it
And Yagate Kimi S2
A lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97TRoHo8Mzk
and the backgrounds on this one remind me of YuYuYu
<a:YuzuHype:411782417267949569>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqE9QwSYJNw
Cute Vampire Cosmonaut
Same energy
|| <:MamiHasNoHead1_MM:588882044319432704> ||
|| <:MamiHasNoHead2_MM:588882044113780752> ||
<:Help:795762965835546664>
Yep, that Wonder Egg ep was something
I really like the backgrounding
I'll give it a shot at least
Were they Russian space vampires?
Not sure on that one Ikxi, haven't even looked
<:AkaneWaa:506164173617758219>
https://anilist.co/anime/131019/Tsuki-to-Laika-to-Nosferatu/
There's some really good non-Kyoani cute girl stuff
Like, New Game, Sora Yori, Hidamari Sketch, Aria, Machikado Mazoku, Yuru Camp
I went to see Weathering with You
I don't actually like going to the cinemas
I still wish they'd be streamed though
There's one theatre near me that shows anime films regularly
It's a movie out in Japan in June
It would seem so
Looks interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDpsTDHN_ac
They should stick to hentai <:LuL:789259461470322728>
But I think that's a good thing
Yeah, it's probably going to have some feels Ash
It's by the person who made YLiA
<a:YuzuHype:411782417267949569>
The ending of Fruits Basket's going to be fantastic
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Mistakes were made
why was girls doing pottery on skip?
I just got so sick of MHA last season
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I'll probably honestly drop MHA5 based off what I've been hearing
There's so much though
This is my current list for next season
Madoka's at 8.5 and Nanoha's like a 7 for me
I'd personally say I think Madoka's quite a lot better
<a:BanaNice:501549702383140865>
That plot twist is one of the best I've ever seen though
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Extra Last Encore is one of the only Fates I'm remotely interested in
I'll be honest though
Probably the most similar would be Hidamari Sketch
Almost every Shaft anime is like that
Yeah, that's the one by Shaft
You should check Kyouso Giga if you like Madoka art. A lot of the backgrounding feels fairly similar to me.
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
Madoka's visuals are very good
<:yuzuFailedSmug:409282356101251074>
Citrus
Gotta get around to catching up on my only manga
Also, is it just me or is this season really rushed?
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
but
I already know what happens
I'll read it eventually
<a:kosaLeaving:562635803956609034>
Watching AoT4 has been painful
To be fair, Shaft had a huge wave of shows around that time with Gatari/Nisekoi/Madoka and they kinda all exploded
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It aired on a kids TV channel here
No wonder I've never heard of it
Kamen Rider
Oh
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Gaim?
Yeah, I really do like the visuals on witches
Welcome to Shaft
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Mine's worse when it has numbers
<:Help:795762965835546664>
my PTW list is painful
regardless of any other factors
Shounen that looks good will pretty much 100% blow up though
It's bad enough to distract from the show itself
The CGI though
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Remember Tsuki ga Kirei is one of the best anime ever and it looks like trash
The Mappa/manga artstyle sucks
that Wit had
I mean, I like the artstyle
at least the first three seasons
But it's fine
It's never been as good as people think it is
It's just about manga sales
It makes sense, it's the entire structure that's fucked
They just wanted it out for the end of the manga
And yeah, the whole arc following random side characters is just meh
but maybe that's an issue with the manga
IDK, the last couple of eps felt like they should have been more
4Kids MHA cut
Point aggressively at someone until they jump out of a window
It's kinda not that much of a kids show
Reminder that the shadow realm is actually just death
Noragami is fantastic though
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Like, my top rated Shounen are the least Shounen Shounen possible
It kinda is
You mean Japan?
wack
Man, my second highest rated Shounen is Symphogear
This is pretty much how I feel about Shounen, about 6 points bellow average and it falls off like a rock after Mob.
Honestly, if I was going to watch one of the big 3 it'd be Bleach
Just a few more decades
<:astroSlain:660947775172902924>
Because apparently we're going to be in a world where they're all airing again
No, the new big 3 is going to be Naruto, Bleach and One Piece
god bless
God, OreImo is one of the very few series where that's a spoiler and not just obvious
<:kirinoPout:499471452073099267>
And the only thing wrong with OreImo is that ||he didn't end up with his sister||
Yuuichi Nakamura is pretty amazing too
So he has to be way up there for me
Kamiya just did so many characters I love though
Aiko's good too
just insane
Imagine coming into a series with Gatari's VA lineup in the second season and stealing the show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-deSKW4_KI8
He just like, stole Monogatari and that series has some other insane VAs
Like, Miki should probably be tagged as in a couple more Monogataris
It doesn't really work the best though
If I go by time, Hana Kana's in everything isn't she?
I had mine ordered by score
Oh
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
very surprising top VA list
I love Anilist stats though
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
realistically it had lost that by S3
but in Levi's case I've always felt like it's mostly an amazing VA carrying the performance
Maybe Levi at a stretch
very weak, I feel like Braun is the only really interesting character
but most
certainly not all
absolutely, most of the characters they kill are pretty pointless side characters if we're honest
The fundamentals of writing are pretty much the same, it's just that the Japanese actually apply them all to animation rather than treating it mostly as a toy for children
Just how I like it
Was it pain and suffering again>
Imagine that OPM, having characters is actually a positive
It's also just really good character writting
yep
When I think about shounen which are better written though it's stuff like Noragami and Mob Psycho which explicitly avoid many of the typical troupes of shounen
<:kirinoLUL:475865268736884737>
*he says after proclaiming his love for Kirino*
AoT is written better than most shounen, but like, you can aim higher
That's why I always write AoT
Me too Mel
Yeah
<:kirinoSmug:823590403898998834>
I lost my Kirinosmug emote
God
Remember who the canon girl is though
Yeah, I'm probably going to do it at some point
~~I'd watch another season of Eromanga though~~
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
Those are strange ways to spell Kirino
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Just pay to have a disk sent from Japan, then pay to have a disk drive sent
I mean, Robotics Notes was watchable
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
Part of me just wants to sit AoT fans down in front of Sangatsu no Lion and just say "this is what characters with actual depth look like" though, NGL
Reiner is actually a pretty well written character
And he's not the one who gets bought up most of the time
There is a legit, complex, interesting character in AoT
The weird thing is
Yeah, Armin and Eren aren't complex characters at all
Or alternatively if you've fundamentally written the whole plot around the twist that will happen Madoka style
Especially since I've loved everything else I've ever watched by Ikuhara
I really should watch Utena
<a:DokiDoki:486358825754951681>
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Same for both
That's not really the issue
Honestly, the anime's views on gender and trans issues have been fairly good
Yeah, the whole ||punch teen suicide away|| thing isn't exactly a great direction
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
but it has a weird thing that keeps me wanting to watch it
It's like, a 6 at best
that's a show
Is anyone else watching Vlad Love?
but the difference is it feels like horsies is punching above its weight while Yuru's punching below
Probably about as good as horsies
It's like, fine
This season of Yuru Camp hasn't been as good as S1 for me for some reason
Ehhh
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
I hated Tonikaku so much, the female protag was literally a doormat who did whatever she was asked and had no real personality and the male protag wasn't that much more interesting
Tonikaku
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Better than the last romance the anime community was convinced was good
It's at least good straight stuff
Horimiya's pretty good
and Horimiya
oh
üèá
Only other thing this season that's really above average is horsies
Urasekai did get better as it went on too
Yeah, that's fair
I still think it's the best anime airing this season, it just doesn't look like it's going to have the best ending possible
Sad
I'm not a huge fan of the direction I think Egg's moving in
like, wouldn't you add school or something?
It just feels weird for the 3rd tag
Yeah
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Don't even have MHA to drop
Time to vote it up
Sigh
The fact that the three tags it has are yuri, magic and ships makes me think it's a meme
I really doubt it is
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Why does Blue Reflection Ray have a ships tag
Gonna finish Urasekai soon
They should just pull a Bakemonogatari start and flash some words and images you won't understand on screen for two minutes
<:Help:795762965835546664>
Behind on everything
I feel that
<:monaderp:794086045465313321>
It comes out on Saturday for him but Sunday for me
Need to think backwards
Fuck timezones
Ohhh, wait Ash would be a day before me
That's probably the JP start day
Hmmm
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
So one of us is wrong
Somehow you have Watashi no Kramer on Sunday, I have it on Monday, but I should always be a day before you
OK, this is confusing
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Ash shouldn't that be offset from mine by a day
Godzilla's going to be fun
Which I guess is good
That's my current plan, but like, everything lands on the weekend
I tend to start a lot then drop aggressively
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Looks like MHA's gonna get dropped
Planning to watch 7 anime on Sunday next season
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I really hope they don't botch the ending
I was very happy with ||the way the show handled the trans character in the second to last ep though, it felt fairly well executed considering they were really a side character||
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Man, I know it won't get one but a second season of Ura Sekai would be great
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-03-24/wit-studio-establishes-stop-motion-studio-with-pui-pui-molcar-director/.171039
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
and it's not even there anymore
<a:ChrisShiftyEyes:744451987831128126>
I had to actually add the ship tag to Kaiji, despite the fact that the entire first arc happens on a ship
<:ChrisPout:660514247733674021>
Would have been better if it was just a yuri romance anime
I'm glad the series pretty much dumped them all
I just got sick of the repetitive jokes that weren't even funny the first time
The first half was just pretty meh
really? I've liked the second half a lot more
not really
ehh
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
Ep 9 of Vlad Love is up there with the strangest things I've ever watched
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
If I was legit going to pick a new MC though it'd probably be Rice Shower
We haven't had Golden Ship as an MC yet
nowhere near
Like, the first season wasn't as good as this one
I'm kinda surprised how good Uma Musume's been though
||ready to spin the wheel of leg injuries||
it's perfect
This season is just 100% pain and suffering
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Why is Uma Musume just pain and suffering
I don't really like reading though
Maybe I'll get around to it by 2030
I'll add it to the list
<a:APetForHibiki:753351066912817183>
Feels like an <@171395487247630336> anime
Interesting
https://mobile.twitter.com/AKEBI_chan/status/1375281358080106498
Kinda the only thing by them I've ever really cared about (although I haven't seen LWA yet).
I think at least
I'm just happy Trigger's doing more Gridman
Oh, new Higurashi is in July apparently
Man, Kadokawa's really not going to show anything new are they?
<:yuzuwanheart:656791199809536000>
Yuzu is a cinnamon roll who deserves love
Yuzu is fantastic
<:yuzustare:400154443833802752>
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
IDK, Citrus is just one of my favourite series and I struggle to explain why
<a:yuzufirstkiss:408210975456493568>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
My friend disliked Citrus
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I didn't like S1 anyways
Probably Pachinko
<:YuzuPonder:430875283860750347>
Penguindrum twitter countdown
I don't think Solo Leveling's likely to happen based on what I know about it
Villainess is at 5th
Poll on what manga/LN a Japanese readership would want to see adapted into anime
<:NotLikeYuzu:412392276568965120>
Finished Beastars, it was going so well, the the last ep hit
<:ShirabeSleep:691497302535176302>
Probably easier to just hibernate
Time to hibernate <:ShirabeSleep:691497302535176302>
It's time for 6 months of no-one shutting up about MHA
Oh no
The only other one I can think of was Boogiepop
that's a very specific number
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Also, the fact that it's 16 eps makes me think this wasn't meant to be a split cour
<a:AkaneParty:516144087921852436>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzZB6Z1YbSs
I'm so hyped for Dynazenon at this point
But S4 is just on another level
Characters start making decisions which really don't make a ton of sense in service of the plot
Yeah, the ending to S2 is honestly where the plot really starts going south
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
it's so bad
but holy hell
I tried to give the "final" season a chance
Asking if Mahou Shoujo is gay seems a bit pointless
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I love that no-one I've talked to has actually been excited for this, it's just all people being like "learn what the fuck the word final means"
The electric boogaloo
by like 5 seconds
You beat me to it
fuck
Apparently AoT doesn't understand what final season means
It's fantastic
Just go watch Flip Flap anyway
I can't, all of them ||have broken legs|| <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Still in that weird "no-one makes anime with this ep count" range
that was 18
oh wait
Ex-Arm may be shit but it's not a lawsuit waiting to happen
https://anilist.co/anime/124060/Baraou-no-Souretsu/
I found out this exists recently and I'm super interested. A shoujo retelling of Shakesphere, and not only that, one of my favourite Shakesphere plays. <a:YuzuHype:411782417267949569>
So they don't actually have a union
I feel like Japan could really use a union movement though. Everything I hear about worker conditions there is just garbage.
The monetization model for movies is significantly less asinine
Strongly advise you watch a few Jim Stirling vids if you think it's remotely better
Video game industry is also shit
God damn, this is one of the worst productions I've ever seen
Yeah, they're the first to try aren't they
On a scale of 1 to Overlord 3?
But they've put themselves in a place where they really need to do that to stick the landing though
I could still see them pulling off some big brain mindfuck ending
<:Help:795762965835546664>
I still want it to be good though
I just want it to be great
<a:Panic:589215632772431893>
Ahhhh, I'm so worried about ep 12 of Wonder Egg though
<:heh:789442010985267240>
200 interns
It is also possible to unionize a freelance workforce, it's just really, really hard. There's talks of creation of an Uber union in the UK IIRC
I'm pretty sure Japan has a pension system, I don't know how high it is though
oh
<:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
What are you guys talking about
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Learning that the author went to jail for tax evasion just made so much sense though
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
This season just hasn't been good
IDK if I'd even watch another season after this one
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
glad I can just be done with Log Horizon now
I just tend not to believe people who say their tax evasion was accidental in general
Literally everyone who tries to evade taxes will say that
There was some anti tax ideology in there if you read between the lines
very inline with what the anime was showing
It's the fact that he evaded taxes that makes sense
(I don't have an issue with it, just reacting to the start)
<:ChrisYikes:679341065878241292>
Like, they're not just doing some throw away trash
The fact they gave it two cours makes me feel like it'll actually be pretty decent
They just can't do anything with action in it to save their lives
JCStaff is actually pretty good at drama/comedy
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
24 eps
is 2 cour
Blue Reflection Ray
hold on
wait
Lots of stuff next season
still need to check Mars Red
Yeah, Princess was interesting
<a:ChrisBaka:670628703734333450>
||Shame they killed Ayahi's character though <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> ||
Well, that was very good
so many mess it up
I see well placed fast cuts and just know it's going to be good, because that shit's kinda hard to do
Mars Red looks like it's going to be really nice
Ever get like 30 seconds into an anime and already know you're going to enjoy it?
<:LuL:789259461470322728>

Damn, imagine being bound by morals
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
Gonna go start Zombieland Saga I think
That would get confusing fast
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Since they just clog up the root
at some point I do need to go through and delete the seasonals for the last year or so though
I thought we all knew that
Funimations servers run off floppy disks
That's impressive
damn
I have a 3TB portable harddrive that I've just been filling with anime for the last year and a half
The OG best dad
No one bought up Gendo
I actually learned about him from the "let me slip into something more comfortable" clip
<:YuzuFailedSmug:827303707230076959>
Considering the amount of bullshit they put up with I nominate Yuzu's mum and Mei's dad.
Critical's pretty funny sometimes
Chihaya?
This one's going to be good, isn't it
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM8T-6OvWpo
Oof, new Back Arrow OP is a huge downgrade
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
The last ep of WEP doesn't come out till june
Sometimes it's very easy to tell you won't enjoy a show from the first couple of minutes
If I'm not feeling something I'll drop after a few minutes
Also yeah, 3 ep rule is BS
I want an LSD fueled adventure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2h_--ng8rk
Actually kinda looking forward to this
Yeah, I'm not sure about 86
Actually, literally every first ep I've seen so far this season has been really good
<:ChrisComf:660514247754907648>
I really liked the first ep though
Not as much my style of music
Godzilla's OP is so damn good
Also, I second üêß ü•Å
It spoils like the first half
Don't watch ep 0 BTW
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Or the Monogatari Series
Try Kyousougiga
Acid trip
Oh
Princess Principle
It's really not
No
He's not horny, he's pure AF
Both
He's uhhh
Don't worry
It's just Shitpostgear
Don't trust that
No, you're right
<:MomoWhyAreYouLikeThis:642133990081560610>
Yeah, pretty much
https://tenor.com/view/hidamari-sketch-miyako-eating-watermelon-chew-gif-17228478
Hidamari Sketch
yep
<:NoU:824762219078221824>
The OP is great
I imagine you'd enjoy that
Oh, probably also worth looking into Utena Stella
<:AetherWave:807328881027317790>
Enjoy Stella
Everything's surreal as hell and kinda hard to follow at times
Just watch it
Oh yeah, Twintail's ED is a jam
It's uhhh, much more surreal than I was expecting when I watched it
Fragtime as well is pretty interesting
It is
yeah
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Why did none of us rec Madoka
It's just that the entire plot is symbolism
but it's plot literal
I mean, it is symbolism
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I just expect that sort of weird crap in my anime at this point honestly
Fair enough
<:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
I feel like Twintails is a lot lewder than Yurikuma
<:amongus:754232447322947614>
Amanchu is very good
Number one is like a 50/50 for me depending on how you define lewd. Either Yosuga no Sora or Shinmao no Testament
It's one of the lewdest shows I've ever watched
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Then put in the girls bathroom
Guy gets turned into a soap
Loris we should watch through Yuuna and the Haunted Hotsprings one day
The rest of the show is actually pretty fine
I just tend to remember OPs from shows that aren't trash better
Yeah, that OP's good too
<a:crybaby_a:563053256922628116>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKjbF2a90Fo
Also this one too actually
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Because I'm in Aus it just shows up first
Oh, that's because it's the Animelab one
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZenmeRytEM
Actual fav OP
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
like, actually in the anime
But like, Average Abilities has Nendos
Hell no
Waho Waha
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA4DTggH9GM
ever
has the best OP
Average Abilities
Uhhh, but like
Average Abilities is just Endro but better though
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Two eps in and I hate both
ye
Every time the character other people say is funny talks I just want him to shut the hell up because he just strikes me as absurdly abusive
super close to dropping
and I'm like
I watched the first two eps
There's also Battle Athletes and Zombieland though
Does Watashi no Kramer count?
Super Cub looks like the best Honda ad ever
I was just saying it's like Flip Flap
Oh, IDK about the SFX
it is
yeah
ahh
What anime Stella?
but something super scuffed is happening
From what I've heard CR has picked it up
IDK, personally I'm super into that sort of anime
It's a lot like Durarararararara only nowhere near as good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6w89a-E6bg
That I actually prefer to Elaina's
That season had a really good OP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBT7o-o8zjA
Best ED is easy
I'm really liking this season so far
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Just for the trainwreck factor
It's worth watching the first ep
People dying in Ex Arm is hilarious
Yeah, I think it's worth it no matter what honestly
Probably why I really didn't like the series
Rider was a total bro
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
The only characters in Fate Zero I liked were Waiver and Rider
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
The best shounen is Noragami though, which I guess is a battle shounen
They are
MHA still has a long way to go to reach that level
Hey, come on
But they underutilise him
Like, Endeavour's a good character
Because the good part of MHA is the part that just ignores the school altogether
Yes I am
Yes
Izuku sucks
and just focused on Endeavour and Hawks ect.
MHA would be so much better if it just didn't have the school
I was talking to friends in another discord about this
The others are meh
I adore the first season
My brain died and wouldn't recall the name
God
Have you seen Yuuki Yuuna?
It's just, kinda dated and not anything special
Nanoha's OK
<:SagiriBleh:341060865547829248>
Flip Flap got slept on way too hard
<:Papika:650665000653946882>
My favourite Mahou Shoujo
The real answer is Flip Flappers
<:rikkaawe:442224335168602122>
Madoka has such a good art style
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/486327581147267085/624365043659702272/tenor18.gif
rather than just making everyone edgy asshats
You can give characters with opposing goals some charm
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Yes, but I still don't want to sit through it
And a small issue with screaching
Black Clover
I mean
Like the least shounen list of shounen I've ever seen
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
What does the fact that my top shounen are Noragami, Gear, Nisekoi, Mob Psycho and Zetsubou Sensei say about me
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
What does friendship achieve for Kyouko
Shows like Madoka and Flip Flap really don't
some mahou shoujo and shonen share a lot
The two are not mutually exclusive
That's the demographic it was targeting
I mean, it also just is a shounen
Also, Gear is actually tagged as a shounen at least on Anilist
GX especially
See, I actually started having issues with Gear as it moved to be more shounen like in later seasons
as guy with a Gatari profile pic
That's my personal issue here
About half of them (including most of the popular ones) suffer from a real lack of depth
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Really limits the exposure anime like Fruits Basket can get
Not really
https://www.youtube.com/c/GlassReflection/videos
Glass Reflection actually tends to have some decent takes/content
He basically made a super ironic video about how much he loved it
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
maybe DomexKano actually
The last time Gigguk had a good take was Eromanga Sensei
Gigguk's takes on most things
The early eps did a lot to not help
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Didn't it have 2 garbage seasons running
and it's a masterpiece
ID: Invaded has some serious animation jank
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Actual hot? take, animation alone can never carry a series and it didn't carry Demon Slayer
<:nadePeace:568014372413112340>
never a soul
<:nadeLove:486352799114985484>
There's some objectively good opinions, for example, Nadeko is a cinnamon roll who'd never hurt anyone
I'd assumed that at least stuff like Shinobu Mail were planned
really
<:Thinkness:518151525886066688>
I really don't know but he's been planning stuff meticulously since at least second season
There's one completed LN season that's not adapted, off season then there's the ongoing monster season
There's three seasons currently adapted into anime, first, second and final
yes
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
I love it
If it didn't take like a week to binge through I'd watch it more often though
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
The two are not mutually exclusive
Trust me here
<:NadekoSociety:640352239843803152>
Loris shit talking Gatari is actually painful
<:Help:795762965835546664>
but that shit takes so long
God, i'm making myself want to watch through Gatari again
<a:hanekawaNya:486414271782060032>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on6v8hpjDr0
You asked for it
<a:nyanNyan:789861623006756874>
Loris, have you considered a website named after the noise a cat makes
https://tenor.com/view/fruitbasket-anime-bike-bicycle-hatsuharusohma-gif-15606179
The 2019 one is so good
<:Forbiddenlove:406545981837017098>
Not sure if this is just someone fucking with tags or not
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Pretty unlikely
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'll go with this
and since odds of a cricket anime any time soon are zero
It's my second favourite sport
I'm enjoying it so far
I lean towards using football on the internet and soccer IRL though
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
So I just call it whatever the person I'm talking to doesn't
I'm English but I live in Australia
And yeah, they do
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I guess I just got caught by the times they said football
Hmm, nevermind they actually are saying soccer a lot
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
They're literally saying football and the disconnect is annoying me
I wonder if anyone's making subs of Watashi no Kramer where the word "soccer" is replaced by "football"
<a:BanaNice:501549702383140865>
https://animethemes.moe/video/Nomad-ED1.webm
Ohhh, I really like this
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
Pretty sure I've seen this before but fantasy instead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvZ7xtjYMSk
Fucking water polo anime
indeed
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I can hope
*Bakemonogatari eps 13-15*
There's also still so many cases where legal options just don't exist

<:ARRYAYA:470759923823804417>
I use Taiga for that
<a:BanaNice:501549702383140865>
100%
Revue Starlight
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
Watashi no Kramer is a shounen
Mars Red was a real standout to me
Yeah, this season has some nice shows
Don't have internet, need stuff on hard drive
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
I love being able to watch anime on the train
Probably home video?
I just use nyaa
yes
It gets gayer <:heh:789431887135113241>
Back Arrow is nice
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
They don't get it Millhi
Everyone who watched Yuru Camp?
Where it's garbage, but it's also just hilarious
DomxKano has that shitty soap opera effect
Absolute glorious dumpsterfire
Domestic Girlfriend was better though
<a:YuzuGayPanic:827361568756858890>
Looks like it could well be yuri too
<@171395487247630336> check this one, I think you'd like it.
<:rikkaAwe:789442821131206657>
<:YEP:789276651010654228>
Everything comes out on one day
<:Thinkness:518151525886066688>
Hmmm, Odd Taxi actually seems fairly good
Science students are something else
My favourite science related anime is probably Science Fell in Love because I actually knew people like that at my uni <:heh:789431887135113241>
<a:YuzuCry:827361237888270344>
That's tomorrow
wait
<a:YuzuHype:827505533345857567>
Dynazenon
<:comf:789441906018222080>
Is good though
<:comf:789441906018222080>
Super Cub seems pretty nice
It's so blursed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AU0mHZFX0fA
Why is this OP just ecchi Initial D
ye
What even is this?
God, I actually have so many anime today
Best OP this season is still Godzilla though, I don't even think it's that close
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Never played the game
but I'm looking forward to this one
So waiting for him
I have a friend who I normally watch with
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
https://streamable.com/04oa32
I like this one
Godzilla is Orange
Pretty sure Dynazenon's Trigger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrz8_uUyxDA
<a:AYAYAJAM:707270154588913736>
Blue Reflection Ray just reminds me so much of Yuuki Yuuna
Nice
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I'm already at 29
Ash stop making me want to add something else to my seasonal list
Yeah, Aoi normally seems to voice younger characters
Either way it was really good and reminiscent of what I expect from Shaft <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Also, I love that the start of the episode is just ||a direct gatari reference||
Yeah, the first ep was absolute quality
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
It's Shaft/Niso too

https://anilist.co/anime/113428/Bishounen-Tanteidan/
Ye, it's shaping up to be a really nice show
Yep, this is everything I wanted <:LuL:789259461470322728>
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
Bishounen Tanteidan is definitely Shaft back to doing Shaft things
Can't say I agree with that one at all. Corps avoiding tax is a huge issue, the fact this one made something you like doesn't make it OK.
<a:KoyoLurk:743640291864608890>
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Next season looks kinda
NGL
I kinda wish some of the stuff from this season was pushed back
but this season is just something else
I usually watch a lot of seasonal anime
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I'm probably going to drop a few
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Actually too much anime this season
Hey, DaL has a lesbian to be fair
<a:OrigamiWan:740163723553013780>
She got told to wear a swimsuit and dress as a dog
Best girl
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I mean, DaL is both magical girl and harem
Symphogear from Tsubasa's perspective?
It was better than this shit
Please?
Can we go back to that time where every anime was a battle harem?
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
The only one I'm watching is Bakarina
Yeah, not even a meme
<:heh:789431887135113241>
7-8 skips and Bakarina
That's probably the main reason why I'm mostly disinterested in it
https://www.livechart.me/anime/10154
This is the most interesting fall anime ATM
Then again, it's also half a year out
but it still feels super lacking in general to me
Fall has a few interesting shows
Like, this season is to me what people were saying about last season <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Really? I think this season's one of the best since I started watching seasonally
<:heh:789431887135113241>
Higurashi
So I'm happy with it
but like, this season has Mars Red and Bishounen
Yeah, OK that's pretty solid too
I'm blind
nevermind
oh
It is next season, but it's not listed as it on livechart
so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
which is the best part
It's focusing more on incest
It's also Mahouka, so 0 hope for it
but like
Mahouka's there
Not that much else
And Bakarina
Oh
Next season for me right now is pretty much just The Detective is already Dead and Maid Dragon
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
The other one's just a Honda ad
ye
<:ShirabePlease:724034356192215081>
Maybe we could get haunted hotsprings S2
IDK why, I just love them
But uhh, at least I have Demon Lord this season
I just want more shitty ecchi
I do wish there was more Yaga Kimi/AdaShima type stuff
honestly
I'll watch that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFrwvyHVHe8
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
agreed
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Tachiban Triangle
<:MikuDrool:642012784074424321>
Also called Miku
second was just whatever
The first ep was really nice
Laughs in Fatima
I'll give that one a pass then
<:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
so anything's possible
I mean, there's a Yosuga no Sora anime
~~same~~
I block bots that DM me and such
OK, that's fair
let's face it
Yeah, and then you just click it anyways
No point, 1 blocked message tilts me more than anything anyone else has ever said on discord to me
<:nadeGun:543013078200090624>
You've made a mistake already
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Oh yeah, I actually kinda want more Tsugumomo too
<:SagiriHappy:460888038525108224>
The anime was a lot of fun
Standouts are Mars Red, Bishounen and Odd Taxi
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Think I've watched ep 1 of almost everything I want to this season
<a:BanaNice:501549702383140865>
Nice design though
I watched like 3 eps and just couldn't stand him
I generally like to see that sort of stuff handled decently, shame I couldn't watch through the manager being ||an abusive dick||
The music in Super Cub is on point
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
Ecchi is here
Does it have an Initial unit <:heh:789431887135113241>
||He's just deadzilla||
He's already there
What are you talking about
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Shera really asserted her dominance at the end of that ep
Oof, that Dynazenon ep felt like a bit of a directorial mess
NGL
I just assumed that was trash when I saw it
||Relationship chart has them listed as "close friend" too and so far as I can tell that's the most positive relationship there so I'm just going to ship this <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> ||
So, Back Arrow latest ep spoilers. ||I think there's been a few moments between Elisha and Atlee in past eps and now they're sleeping in the same bed, I think it's yuri now <:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572> ||
https://anilist.co/staff/120842/Fumiko-Uchimura
Yep, amazing how much like Ayahi she sounds there though
Very good
Bishonen ||Wait, we have crossdressing Hatsune Miku, I guess Shaft just won the season||
<:heh:789431887135113241>
Oh wow, Nagatoro's beating MHA in reddit karma. Doesn't matter at all but I'm still happy to see it
But yeah, Isekai Mao would be top 5 for me probably
It's really well done IMO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbt3ONAfAko
I just love this one so much
At least of the ones I know
From that list the most notable are probably BRR and Isekai Mao
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I'm watching like, almost everything so it's kinda inevitable there's some good ones
What are you watching?
My top 3 OPs this season are easily Bishonen Tanteidan, Blue Reflection Ray and Godzilla SP, I don't really think there's anything else even close to those three
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
Pretty sure I have both
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/mszbz2/pretty_boy_detective_club_op/
IDK why, it's just not really working for me
It's like a 5-6 to me ATM, I'm pretty mixed on it
I'm super on the fence about it
IDK about 86 though
Especially if you've liked more dialog heavy shows in the past it's one of the best this season
It's very good
Don't sleep on Odd Taxi <:monalurk:781462115692314664>
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
I like my reverse harem anime
I'm enjoying Saint's
https://anilist.co/anime/123802/Seijo-no-Maryoku-wa-Bannou-desu/
Only one I'm watching
<:SagiriBleh:341060865547829248>
I mean, it's more like 70% of anime and 95% of isekai
Agreed. It's so damn oversaturated and the vast majority are just shit
Kinda cursed
<:Help:795762965835546664>
Megalobox 2 is pain
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
It's just really well written
Cramer has so much heart, I'm really liking this anime even if it's not the best directed/animated thing ever
<:uguu:616501273520373760>
https://twitter.com/RanobeSugoi/status/1383734377864073219
Cool
<:rikkaBooli:463677636300767232>
I'm sorry that's all I can think of when I see CG
Code Geass?
Mars Red feels like watching a stage play and I love it
<a:BAKOOM:483186326942777344>
This guy has a godlike moustache
Tailred is my spirit animal <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZVe6i7FYGo
This ED is fantastic <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
just significantly less sane
But it has the same otome/reverse harem setup
and not at all in most
To be fair, it's a lot like Saint's in some ways
<:MayoiOK:325758983413563412>
Top tier stuff
Ash you should check out Pretty Boy Detective Club, it has boys dressed as girls and girls dressed as boys
Speaking of EDs, I can't decide if I like this or not
https://animethemes.moe/video/Osamake-ED1.webm
OsaMake is actually surprisingly wholesome <:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
God that makes me so uncomfortable
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
God I love the designs
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
Also, I watch no shortage of SoL
Also, good SoL still normally has at least a serviceable plot
And the ones without are abysmally bad
SoL is more reliant on character writing than any other genre
In what world? Do you really think SoL doesn't have strong characters?
That's the entire reason why Gridman worked
I mean, without a decent plot and compelling characters I personally don't see a point in it at all
I have some huge issues with the writing so far
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Honestly, the majority of this season is better
I've actually dropped shows that I feel are better this season
Amiya, the fact that I haven't dropped it already is me giving it a huge amount of leeway because it's Gridman's sequel
<a:AkaneParty:516144087921852436>
This is Gridman canon and you can't change my mind
Always my thing
Also, avant garde artstyles <:MayoiOK:325758983413563412>
Yeah, it really was
<:Help:795762965835546664>
I have a problem
Help
It was inevitable considering I end up liking pretty much any non-kodomo magical girl anime regardless of its quality but I'm starting to really enjoy Blue Reflection Ray
Nagatoro in a swimsuit was nice though
<:MikuAmogus:827221274022903819>
That's pretty sus of you Millhi
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I mean, CR's leaning into the meme
<:sus:835637046437478441>
Manabu is 100% best boy this season
<:monasadcry:784998835277660180>
I really wish there were more anime like the older Key anime
I really liked the anime
Fragtime has an anime and it's an acid trip
Luckily I live right near one of the two cinemas in Melbourne which grabs pretty much every anime movie
<:GanyuBox:799851032108072960>
There's a cinema 10km from me that normally shows stuff
Yeah, I probably would for Madoka
<:heh:789431887135113241>
that makes 3
There's been some weird tie-ins
You can never tell with Japan
wait, is this actually a thing?
<:MadoHomu_MM:752278876628975719>
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
Pretty sure you literally can't post or something
https://www.reddit.com/r/thingshomuradidwrong/
You should see some of the Odd Taxi theories people are making, they're actually insane
It sounds like it's recorded in an oil tanker
holy
KoiKimo is the first time I've ever seen voice recordings/sound mixing this bad
||At the end of the original series when Madoka did the thing she essentially started collecting the souls of magical girls as they were about to go witch, eventually that takes its toll and causes her to go witch herself and that's Walpurgis. Just add wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff||
I do have a crack theory on this
No not that one the other one
Oh, oof, they missed the cringe in the really shitty agegap show this season
God damn I love this anime
I've lost count of how many times Fruits Basket's made me cry
Sony's going to be in for some trouble <:LuL:789259461470322728>
https://www.livechart.me/spring-2021/tv
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17YXAQoyH2Q
I mean, it is
It's the weakest part of the series, but it's super short so whatever
I think the prequel's worth watching
12 eps original series, 6 eps prequel and 6 eps sequel (that's the standard watch order)
Before accounting for the new series
It's 24 eps total if you also watch the prequel Ash
It's basically just people doing dumb shit that makes no sense to try to hurt people they actually want to be with for no discernible reason at all. Kinda fun trash to watch honestly
It has some Gamers energy honestly, in that if they just talked like humans they'd probably have fewer issues
||Two of the characters both asked each other out and both turned each other down though, so pretty scuffed overall||
Ehhh, not sure yet
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
Oh, I just realised this is Doga Kobo
https://anilist.co/anime/124675/Osananajimi-ga-Zettai-ni-Makenai-Love-Come/
Most scuffed love triangle I've seen in a while
<a:shamiEEEEEE:708734921077686344>
Wait, she said the thing
Of course, everything's better with jesus
The three best shows this season are Bishounen Tanteidan, Mars Red and Odd Taxi though
Yeah, I actually think BRR is quite decent
<:heh:789431887135113241>
I see a 3HZ CGDCT anime and it goes on my PTW
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
Isekai Maou is such glorious trash
<:kirinoSmug:823590403898998834>
Also OreImo
<:taigaCHARGE:468021601951154187>
I think my second favourite is Toradora though
I mean, it happens like every other chapter in Gekkan Shoujo, MC is a parody of dense MCs
Yagate Kimi has the potential to be right up there too ~~if it ever gets a S2~~
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
We've talked about this before
Millhi and I fundamentally agree on the best romance though
Wotakoi is good
Not seen Gekken Shoujo?
I love fireworks too
<a:loliDance:447728413722017804>
OK, Bofuri kinda works IMO because the stats feel more like a shitpost than anything else
Want me to talk about my opinions on Fate too <:heh:789431887135113241>
They work well in games because there needs to be a system that the player can alter the inputs of which is something that doesn't really apply to any other media
I don't personally find they work well in written media either
RPG stats are a game mechanic, when put into a visual medium they just come off as kinda overly expository
Also, this is why the few isekai that are actually good either predate most of the modern wave (Devil is a Part Timer, Re:Zero ect) or just do something completely different (Bookworm, HameFura)
Ignore everything else about them, that's the main problem
I kinda have a very different opinion on this, which is that isekai really aren't net good for a simple reason, and it's one of the reasons you listed as a positive. They're too reliant on random gimmicks rather than actual story writing. Almost every isekai is fundamentally the same story with fundamentally very similar characters just with a random twist. They were stale years ago, it's just moved past absurdity now.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
suffering
Bookworm was actually what I was thinking of
^
if you got rid of all the troupes in the genre
You could totally write an isekai as good as pretty much any other series
I like Isekai Maou because it's trash
100%
To be fair here, level=stats
so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
but then again, I don't think I've ever seen stats used without skills
I feel like skills are much softer and actually allow for more bullshit writing a lot of the time
That
Case in point
Also, god I wish anime studios would tone down the amount of isekai they pump out
Planet of the Apes is an isekai
Yes, because the main character is arguably actually Meteora
It kinda is though
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
That's all I've got
Does ReCreators count?
I mostly love romance and drama <a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
I think that's why something like Isekai Maou that doesn't even bother pretending it's about anything else is honestly better than most
yep
May as well just write Mahouka <:LuL:789259461470322728>
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
mostly because of Gigguk just buying the lewdest shit he could find
I liked their video where they bought anime figs
<:comf:789441906018222080>
It's a mecha show that most people seem to hate but I actually quite like
Also Back Arrow's airing right now
Dynazenon
Let's face it, whatever the next boom is it'll be something dumb again <:LuL:789259461470322728>
True, but the post K-On wave was hugely influential on the art styles that are common in anime today. At least I kinda feel that way
~~K-On won~~
Moe's kinda just an integrated part of anime even outside of the genre though
There was the battle highschool between them
To an extent new authors as a whole are actually victims of the absurd dominance of isekai since it greatly limits the range of stories a new author can actually write and get published
Personally I'm really enjoying the slower pace and like the artstyle quite a lot
Both are subjective

Watch till the end of ep 3, it's a clusterfuck
It's fantastic
Yep
I mean, it just means that there's actually a source

so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>

About half way through Godzilla now, ||no Godzilla yet||
but at least a fun one
It's a dumpster fire
I like it
It's what a harem anime written by a computer would look like
It's fucking amazing <:02lul:414576440114151424>
Like, it's a true statement if you ignore the many exceptions
There's tons more of things that are fairly good too like NHK, Ergo Proxy, Code Geass, Honey and Clover ect
But the thing is, those+Kyoto Animation in general are just the most glaring examples
I think it's far too sweeping of a statement that ignores that some legitimately visually amazing anime like Aria and Mushishi came out in that time frame
<a:crybaby_a:563053256922628116>
And I still tear up when I think about it
Millhi that scene made me cry like a bitch for like an hour
||so of course she fucking dies||
Makoto is probably my favourite character from a Kyoani anime though
This is what perfection looks like and you just don't know it yet
I like that artstyle <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
We can go bigger
Then there was KyoAni just doing KyoAni things

It's really dumb because the actual equation they need is even simpler
<:RikaAaaaahhhhhh:819040805011849297>
Just getting tilted by its use in Vivy ||my body weighs 80kg, so according to e=mc^2. Like, what are you going to do, spontaneously annihilate every atom in your body? Then she just throws herself off a roof, like, yes mass matters in that, but c^2 does not.||
It does not
Yes, but when we're talking about, in this case a falling object
that equation's pretty much only relevant to fusion and fission, stop using it in place of the momentum equation, it has nothing to do with the energy of motion <:LuL:789259461470322728>
<:momoWhyAreYouLikeThis:692154033485643797>
I love it when authors just assume they know what e=mc^2 means and use it randomly
Yeah, Shadows House is a standout for me too

Most of the anime is, but that specific cut isn't
That animation isn't hand drawn
TBH though there's a lot of really good uses of CGI in anime that you probably didn't even realise were CGI. When it's done really well in a 2D anime it integrates seamlessly. The really obvious examples to go to are things like Land of the Lustrous but what a lot of people don't realise is that some simple, common things in anime are almost always done with CGI. A good example being camera rotations, if you ever see a long camera rotation in an anime that doesn't look jank it's probably an example of CGI that's been integrated far better than any in SNK. Some still hand animate this but it's hard and tends to come out looking worse.
There were a few times where it looked out and out worse, notably the CGI scouts
I found it just as jarring in S4 as it was in previous seasons
I'd disagree with that
Any really
but it's pretty noticeable and janky
It's not Golden Kamuy S1 level bad
I'd rate it bottom half
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
SNK is not the anime I think of when I think of good or even passable CG
And yes, Yakumo is Rakugou Shinjuu, he's the old storyteller who's the focal point of S1
https://anilist.co/character/369/Hatsuharu-Souma
Middle one is Fruits Basket
My top 3 male characters in no order would probably be Kaiki Deishuu, Hatsuharu Souma and the 8th Yakumo
<:KaikiDone:774101923698966539>
Kinda annoyed it caps out at 25 though, cause there's a few I'd like to put in but I just can't remove anyone from that list
Of course
Top staff
Yep, my account's mostly a giant meme
Monogatari just has so many good character
They're both in my T25
Yes
If I did it in no order it'd be Nadeko/Karen/Hanekawa/Kanbaru/Chris/Homura/KRISTINA/Akane/Kumiko/Kirino
I know that almost half the list would be gatari though
<:ababa:789441747678920735>
IDK who number one would even be for me
Out of my early anime I think the most memorable was Steins;Gate
Probably going to sleep on it and decide in the morning
<:heh:789431887135113241>
Watch me just watch Seikon no Qwaser instead
Why did I know you were going to show up and suggest either that or Gosick <:LuL:789259461470322728>
<:KaosAbababa:452439689383903233>
and yeah, I wasn't joking about the number
Currently thinking between Bakuman/Banana Fish/Chobits/ef:/Ergo Proxy/Gosick/Honey and Clover/Hyouka/Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou/Kimi ni Todoke/Little Busters/Nagi no Asukara/NHK ni Youkoso!/Nodame Cantabile/Ore Monogatari!!/Sakura Quest/Zetsuen no Tempest
too many
<:ababa:789441747678920735>
Do any of you guys ever just think "I want to watch a decent, slightly longer than average anime" and come out after looking down you're PTW list with a list of like, 15 anime
<:kirinoLewd:450164781283016706>
Yes, they are in fact the best
Australian government says yes
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Also, Tsugumomo would have worked perfectly for Devilman's spot but it actually is an ecchi
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
No MonMus
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>

Bakemonogatari <a:KoyoTiltAnim:403747352050925568>

I love the way Bishounen was start out somewhat normal and by the end of the ep they've just become completely absurd.
Sitting here, watching Mars Red and giggling because ||Chris's VA is performing stage plays and it just feels like Chris||

That's really hard to answer because it's fundamentally a character drama. At the surface level it's about a former child solder writing letters for people.

I would watch it, but I'm always a little apprehensive with Trigger
it is
Yeah
Little Witch Academia?
If you're looking for something that feels good then not that probably
Actually, it's time for more Hidamari Sketch
<:comf:789441906018222080>
But RN I'm in the mood for some comfy cute girl anime
Utena's definitely something I want to watch soon
Bishounen's not surprising, since Niso but Odd Taxi really came out of nowhere
Oh, also Odd Taxi and Bishounen Tanteidan are the best written anime I've seen in god knows how long
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>

I'm sensing a lot of undeserved hostility towards Citrus
Aoi Yuuki for example
There's a few female VAs I never miss
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
yep
I did pick him out in Back Arrow though
But I've also totally missed him before
I've done it a couple of times
There's a few I can recognise
I can normally hear out Shinichirou Miki too, not quite as reliably as Kamiya though who I've heard like 3 times this year, went to look it up and found out it was him
Hiroshi Kamiya is the easiest for me
what the fuck?>

uhhh
No listed VA
https://anilist.co/character/40882/Eren-Yeager
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Na, he's just not on Anilist
He's not showing up in my search for whatever reason
what roles did he play?
IDK if I'd pick it from nothing but I can definitely hear her in there
yeah, fair
Because I don't do Fate
But uhh, I was never going to see that
Maybe it's just that I miss her and never look her up in some rolls
<:heh:789431887135113241>
That'll happen when you put the last three eps of an insanely popular anime as an OVA
||I love when series bring back imagery from early on in the season for the climax though||
Fruits Basket
Same
Man, I'm really watching this in a scuffed order <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Probably going to watch through Brave Witches soon
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I watched World Witches and enjoyed it
<:ABABABABA:789441762074165248>
https://anilist.co/anime/103118/Renmei-Kuugun-Koukuu-Mahou-Ongakutai-Luminous-Witches/
And there's going to be this one
There's so many gag series though
<:ababa:789441747678920735>
Why are there so many random Strike Witches spinoffs
<:KoyoTilt:489285273625034753>
I expect many head tilts
Yes
I was enjoying them in World Witches but that may just be the super flanderised characters
Osamake is such garbage and I hate that I actually like it
I don't really enjoy reading manga very much
<:monanote:782563953154588702>
I'll watch that the next time I want to get fucked up
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Blue Reflection really did end up getting a lot better after the first few eps
There were lilies after the screen panned
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Ah, for a second there I forgot I was watching yuri, thanks for reminding me
There was just something about the show that really didn't click for me
I can understand why people like it
It was OK I guess, but kinda just wasn't working for me after 5 or 6 eps
Yeah, I ended up putting that one on hold
Moriarty is an interesting anime
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
Not many studios can pull of as long of a delay as Kizumonogatari
Shaft is basically one giant production issue
nope
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
goat studio?
The duality of JC Staff
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Yeah, the counterpoint to that though is that they also end up putting out the most good anime per year
When I think of a studio that's actually producing a lot of low quality anime to very few good ones my mind actually goes to Madhouse.
There's a fair few very good anime they've made recently
Hi Score Girl, Machikado Mazoku, Shokugeki no Souma (not their fault the manga ended terribly)
Their good anime to bad anime ratio really isn't that abnormal, they just make a lot more anime than most studios
Yeah, JC Staff cops more shit than they deserve
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
It's better than that

<:kirikaDESS:696166094167343125>

Blue Reflection still has a "ships" tag.
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
The last ep was so nice though
I actually feel pretty much the exact opposite. Gridman had a lot more depth in its characters and generally a more interesting storyline. Dynazenon's characters felt absurdly shallow and it's entire storyline just felt like excuses to show off new toys they wanted to sell.
Yeah, I'm really mixed about Dynazenon, definitely felt a lot weaker than Gridman
Wasn't expecting Back Arrow to sequel bait that hard
The problem for me was that the show was very clearly trying to make me feel some attachment to characters but it was just churning through them so fast I couldn't care.
For me it's a lot lower than that
Kinda mixed on Vivy, it's a well put together and mostly well executed plot but it really feels like it was going for some sort of emotional resonance and it just really didn't land it. I can't even decide if I like the show or not.
<:heh:789431887135113241>

Admittedly the whole series being built on technobabble did really piss me off a few times, but it was still fairly enjoyable overall
<:YAMERO:716465855717965835>
Yeah, hard science generally implies something closer to the Martian though, where everything in the media is checked for scientific plausibility before it's released and the series always opts to stick to known science. Godzilla SP is very notably not like that. It's almost like an extreme version of Startrek where it trends towards using made up sciency sounding words to justify what's happening, that's what I mean by technobabble.
it's more in the relms of technobable
I don't know if I'd call Godzilla hard science
Yeah, ||I was actually expecting Mothra to appear there, kinda weird it didn't||
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>

Do I have a genre for you then
I've got it
Wait
Anyone got that Miku voice clip on hand?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQRW0RM4V0k
There's only one ep left to air now
It is one of the best in its genre at least, so it's probably worth a look
both have both, it's more about where they focus
very different, 2001 leans more into the comedic/slapstick elements of the series and while 2018 still has them it's far more interested in character drama than 2001 was
yes
If it was longer than a couple of years ago that'd be the 2001 series
Fruit's Basket just might actually do it <a:YuzuHype:827505533345857567>
there's more

<:2bGasm:442218406180028426>
God, Mars Red just opening an episode with 5 minutes of classical music
I figured that was going to happen soon
pretty much
Perfect
I guess
At least the designs look good?
I wonder if it can be trash enough to be fun
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1foV8Fh0WRc
This looks so trash
You can, but like, it's much better if you watch Madoka first
<:heh:789431887135113241>
I'm looking forward
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
I really wish they'd have just made Illya's characters older
<a:tsukihiXD:567681705133998085>
<:heh:789431887135113241>
I know
Monogatari?
~~just gonna leave this here~~
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gYi1A1JTz8
<:Papika:650665000653946882>
What about that one episode of Nisekoi where Chitoge is a magical gorilla?
I guess you could grab Nanoha
Cool, I'll download it now
I think your best bet if you want less gory Madoka (although to be fair Madoka isn't that gory anyway) is probably Yuuki Yuuna, specifically the first and sequel season and not the prequel.
<a:shamiPat:744325527812178071>
Machikado Mazoku
<:pat:534067375335800882>
It's not a tragedy or anything, but a few eps had me tearing up
S1 is pretty whatever Carol, but there's a huge quality spike during S2
Na, she's a horse girl
Uma Musume: Pretty Derby
It looks fun
<a:loliDance:447728413722017804>
It's always seemed weird to me that most go the other way
I'm generally inclined to agree that violence really should be treated as worse than sexual content by classification boards though
<:heh:789431887135113241>
Try again
They banned Eromanga Sensei
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
I think our gov banned Illya
But I just can't be bothered
I might actually enjoy Azur Lane if I played
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
wait, just a second
I just reverse image searched it
Na, I mean if she was from German/British/American faction her name would be in Katakana since it's a foreign word
If she wasn't Japanese her name would probably be written in katakana
Her name is Urakaze
DxD is shounen
You have to really search for shounen that don't have heavy fanservice
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I rewatched it a few times
yeah, at least we have a date now though
https://natalie.mu/comic/news/434013
<@!171395487247630336> Spring 2022
She's right you know
And as soon as I type that ||naked Reiko||, what did I expect <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Last ep of Cub is pretty cute
yeah, I love both
It is, but it does some similar stuff with its character/world building to the good season of Log Horizon
Do that too
Ah yeah
It's a slightly weird connection but I think most people who enjoy Log Horizon would probably also enjoy Durararara
I don't think I can give you many suggestions related to battle shounen because it's not my thing but if you want the character driven shounen light shows like Log Horizon there's a few I've enjoyed
Does it matter that much?
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Not my thing but it could be worth a shot
You might like Overlord too then
I guess it depends on why you want to watch it though
There's other shounen you could watch if that makes you uncomfortable that are much lighter on fanservice
kinda straddles the line between the two
Yes, Precure is shojou/kodomo (for younger children)
Yeah, the thing is while they're not as common there are still a fair few romance stories aimed at young males. There tends to be differences in the way characters are portrayed and what aspects of the story get focus.
I believe it is
Toradora is also shounen
Na, it doesn't
basically just media aimed at teenage males
Shounen is a target demographic
Low chance I'll ever actually do it then
damn
<a:Panic:589215632772431893>
How many eps does Gintama have now?
I'm going to spoil/post a theory about this show to see if I can convince anyone (unconfirmed) ||people have been theorising that the animal aesthetic is all in the main character's head due to a mental health issue and the world is actually normal/human to every other character. There's a ton of support behind this theory in the show/surrounding media. That's the type of show this is||
<:shamiPointAndLaugh:695364171524472862>
It's really good
Unironically this show has actually made me think about Durarara a few times
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://anilist.co/anime/128547/Odd-Taxi/
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh Cypher, you should watch Odd Taxi
but very good
Not really a battle shounen persay
Noragami is peak shounen
but Baccano moved much more into seinen space
There's the second half of that page
<:heh:789431887135113241>
And my lowest rated is hentai at 0.1
I like good horror and don't tolerate bad horror
I'm like, on the fence?
actually has a 1:1 ratio
Interesting fact though, Horror has my highest drop to watch ratio despite its highish score
profile>stats
And by genre
<:Help:795762965835546664>
And yuri is number 5
The top 4 make me feel like a pretentious dick. <:heh:789431887135113241>
Don't judge me
It used to be like 66% or something
The hell did I watch to do that?
Oh, my average shounen rating tanked
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Actually, looked like it stopped updating months ago
it gets auto updated though
My MAL is mostly just a backup
You can auto export from MAL to Anilist
~~same~~
yeah
Which like
For me it's Shaft>KyoAni
Exact inverse
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Is Mappa being your lowest rated studio other than the Pokemon guys a hot take
Even my personal bias can't overcome quantity
she's in fucking everything
Yeah, I'm very surprised by this
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Monogatari
just
is legit
also, top rated ecchi
<:OMEGALUL:473565787399913483>
The mobile game has more anime content than the OG series
<:ChrisPout:660514247733674021>
<a:HomuDespair_MM:393858540709871628>
I'm really liking the direction it's moving in
If you like pastel style art and Yuuki Yuuna it's at least worth checking out
I think so but I seem to be in the minority opinion
The thing the chat was talking about, Blue Reflection Ray
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
BRR is pain right now
Why?
Strongly recommend, this is the best Shaft's been since Sangatsu
Bishounen Tanteidan
Shaft's really blown out the art budget on this one
Yes Kat, S2 next season and S3 a bit later
It may have had an anime at some point
No, it's a game
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark_troll
It's not illegal in most places
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
What is this <:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
but do you actually expect them to put that much effort into it?
I mean, sure
ye
IE, to get it looking good you'd need a huge budget and years of time with a top quality CGI studio
In terms of the level of CGI required to work MiA would be up there with something like Avatar
And a lot of terrible CGI
Made in Abyss is going to make one of the worst possible live action adaptations ever
<:MayoiOK:325758983413563412>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_F5459jCtuM
One of my favourite OPs is jazz
<:ChrisPout:660514247733674021>
Jazz and swing are great though
I found it by just using google reverse image search
Sakura no Sei, Onmyoji
Post it
Samus has a taller build too
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
That game doesn't exist
but it's firstly and foremost a nintendo game
Does that count?
I've seen an ep or two of Atom
<:heh:789431887135113241>
Zoomer trash
The vast majority of the anime I've watched is post 2016
I despise that anime
Uhhh, that's not what I thought about Gunbuster <:LuL:789259461470322728>
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
I think the only 80s anime I've actually watched is Gunbuster
<:kirinoDisgust:450670439513980928>
<a:happy:567833922281668620>
Lost in Space
<:DkPepper:436268915707084800>
But FB, OT and MR end tomorrow
Shadows has another week
yes
Shadows House, Odd Taxi, Fruits Basket, Mars Red and Blue Reflection all still airing
at least IMO
Most of the best shows this season are yet to finish
but like, still one of my least favourite this season so far
It's watchable at least
Eh, Nagatoro's OK
~~Nagatoro was a mistake~~
This season's had like, several of the best anime I've seen in years
<:KaosKawaii:447038519823695872>
Anime and cute girls
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
There's so few left now
Probably helps that football's one of the few sports I can stand watching
<:comf:789441906018222080>
I actually ended up enjoying Watashi no Cramer quite a bit
That's what the fi in scifi means
It didn't happen
The entire plot is fiction
It's fiction based off of science
It does
Yes
That's actually what hard scifi generally looks like
Everything in that movie is an engineering challenge, within known science
I mean, the Martin also isn't fictional science
Dr. Stone is such a fucking weird example of Scifi though
I think the hardest scifis I've seen recently are probably Lost in Space and Dr. Stone
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
No amount of scientific accuracy's gonna save that anime
even BS science
There's never really an attempt (at least to this point in the anime) to use science to explain the powers
MHA is fantasy honestly
https://anilist.co/anime/9253/SteinsGate/
Just trust me on this one
OK, real questions now
||Shadows House|| is a mecha (seasonal spoilers)
<:heh:789431887135113241>
HxH is scifi
True
~~Reiki ga Koi is a scifi~~
I feel like Star Wars is much more scifi than DaL
At least throughout 4-6 which are the only ones I can remember there's a lot of elements of scifi
not really?
The vast majority of the rest of the series is pretty firmly scifi and not fantasy
or Sith
Also, the fantasy in Star Wars is almost anything to do with the Jedi
Starwars is scifi, science fantasy is a subgenre of scifi
To Love Ru is a Mahou Shoujo <:heh:789431887135113241>
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
Just mecha for CPUs
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
Is Megalobox a mecha
Probably
~~Azur Lane is also Scifi~~
I mean, there's quite a lot it doesn't embrace or subvert, it does just outright ignore conventions because it's more interested in doing its own thing.
To be fair I think Flip Flappers ignores quite a few MS conventions completely but still is clearly a MS show.
Although <:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
Strike Witches is every genre ever
<a:shamimonmoCuddling:708834165277196360>
I don't think it's the best, but it's pretty up there
?
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php
Fruits Basket is the top anime on MAL now
ye
I'd say I'll miss Fruits Basket, but it's getting a spinoff next year anyway
OK, Odd Taxi's last ep was amazing <a:MariaSparkle:688839288082792462>
Only if you're really bad at writing and can't be arsed bridging the two, but a bridge between anime original and source can be done, most of the time it's not that difficult
Either the end result is good or it isn't, comparing something to its source is pretty pointless IMO
That's not really the point I was making, the point was I don't really care about what a studio does in adaptation
I pretty much had the opposite take away, IDK if it's because of the adaptation or what and I don't really care, but I found 86 completely unwatchable
There's a lot of reasons why you might choose to do so
The vast majority of straight up panel by panel adaptations are utter garbage.
Because you want to adapt a thing that already exists but also understand the limitations of both mediums?
things get cut, moved or added because animation is a different medium to print
I'm sorry, but a show is stand alone
This literally doesn't matter
<a:kosaLeaving:562635803956609034>
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
What? Shadows House has been fantastic
Why is this description so perfect <:LuL:789259461470322728>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Yeah, really hyped for the second one now
Maybe they'll get another season to unfuck this <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
<:ababa:789441747678920735>
Why is it a final ep though
The wonder egg special would have made a great ep 7 or something
Ahhh
Can't recall
Was NGNL the tax evasion one?
Read Monogatari <a:KoyoTiltAnim:403747352050925568>
<:kirinoPeace:450164782654291979>
<:KarenGun:598782339987800074>
I want all the waifu wars
<:chitoPeek:562635411130679310>
Nisekoi please
NGNL is one of those shows that left literally no impact on me
Oh no
About 2 days till BAKARINA
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Aquatrope
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
Just watch Odd Taxi instead
Yes
They often go together but they're not always together
Steins Gate is a thriller but not psychological
Monogatari is psychological but not a thriller

A thriller is a genre where a show relies heavily on suspense. Psychological means that the anime involves introspection/human psychology
<a:Lewd:789514523904049212>
At least the ecchi anime next season looks very lewd too
Loris, that's significantly less than last season
Probably going to drop half this crap, but that's my current list <:comf:789441906018222080>
Those are the most interesting shows to me
Mostly looking forward to Kanojo mo Kanojo, Origami Tobiichi is Already Dead and Aquatope though
<:MayoiOK:325758983413563412>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S52vfbJCxhg&t=1s
Children's TV host who hates kids though
It is
~~I'll probably watch through it in the next couple of months~~
also, it got a new season a couple of years back
Ikki Tousen is one of the anime I've been meaning to watch for a while
Ecchi
<a:YuzuHype:827505533345857567>
Antarctica staff
<:monanote:782563953154588702>
Oh, interesting
Which is a plus
And apparently pretty good
I'll probably do NHK next though, been meaning to for a while and it's like, the hard opposite of To Love Ru
That always is nice
I need the exact opposite right now
No, trust me I really don't
<:heh:789431887135113241>

Not the Fate clone Iski?
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
I want to watch something like Rakugo Shinju but I have a feeling there literally isn't anything
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I'm going to have to watch something actually good after this one
To Love Ru is like, one of the most boring ecchi anime I've ever seen and for some reason it's 26 eps long for the first season
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Better than what I've been subjecting myself to recently
KLK is actually worth watching
~~Ichigo is better than 02 anyway~~
I can't even remember
To be fair though off brand Eva that's just kinda decent isn't a terrible pitch for a series and early Franxx really did have that going for it.
Does anyone even care about spoilers for Franxx <:02lul:414576440114151424>
I'm sorry, did you say ||"pivot to giant ship waifu"||
IDK, if they'd have rewrote the entire second half it could have been pretty good
DitF just cut out the middle and jumped to a really shitty ending
And it really felt like they wanted one
I guess the silver lining for WEP is that it's theoretically salvageable if they somehow get a S2
And the way both of those series turned out hurts me
Feels a lot like Darling in the Franxx
Wonder Egg needed a whole nother cour if it wanted to pull this bullshit
<:karenTaunt:567655914996236288>
<a:DentalHygiene:567655922734989353>
<:sweat:457717850220658688>
The girls from this series generally look super hot
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
I mean, I don't listen to vocaloid so I wouldn't know
It reminds me of a lot of early/mid 2000's alternative stuff where the singers often sung in very heavy accents that clashed with the music, it's not the exact same but it has that feel
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
||The MC asked for a threesome already|| so pretty high quality
It's probably closer to the sort of non-anime music I listen to
I really like it <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
It's like a law or something
https://animethemes.moe/video/KanojoMoKanojo-OP1.webm
Legit question, why do these trashy rom coms always have great OPs
Where do we even go from here though?
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
So, Kano mo Kano, ||my guy just asked for a threesome in ep 1||
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
<@!171395487247630336> that's one you'll probably enjoy when you have internet again
<:comf:789441906018222080>
Ok, Kageki Shoujo had a really nice first ep
Can never tell with ep 1 of series like this though
Bokutachi no Remake has some promise
<:AkaneWaa:506164173617758219>
Eizouken's definitely got a lot more going for it
Both are OK, neither's really my favourite though
Oh wow, this is an old ass manga
Tall enough that it's a plot point <:LuL:789259461470322728>
maybe it's because of the backgrounds
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
I love it personally, it has a pretty strong oldschool shoujo feel
<:MayoiOK:325758983413563412>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Dss-RZ9L-Y
Also, the animation in this OP is on point
It's just a more SoL/shoujo take on what Revue Starlight was doing
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
You saw what you saw
<a:FubukiFukireta:751002423199531060>
https://anilist.co/anime/128712/Tantei-wa-mou-Shindeiru/characters
Perfectly normal character list
Hamefura, Remake and Tantei wa mou, Shindeiru were all pretty whatever from their ep 1s and one of those series has the advantage of being a sequel while the other two did less with a 1hr ep than good pilots do with 25 min.
I added Shinigami Bocchan to Kuro Maid and Kageki Shoujo to my list without knowing anything much about them and they've easily been the two best pilots so far
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Having a weird thing this season where so far the anime I expected to like have been fairly average and the random anime I decided to watch have actually been fantastic
Weird
JCStaff's actually pretty good at making full CGI anime
Tantei was such a weird first ep
~~and Special Week~~
Yeah, trainer became a much better character when he just started to help rather than being a gag character
Konosuba's just pretty meh IMO
Flip Flappers is actually my favourite Mahou Shoujo
<a:HibikiAniThreeSeconds:836580813474103326>
I thought of something else
Or in MHA's case they're significantly worse
18hrs from now
also, obligatory *confused biologist noises*
I really hope that one does get an adaptation
Darkness is just a fairly decent person with a crippling kink
Kinky Kirika
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Darkness is the only person in that series who isn't completely horrible
Is shitting on Konosuba that spicy?
I compare it to Toradora mostly because of the similarity in a lot of the humour
Kinda just feels like worse Toradora though <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
It's not the best romcom ever, but it's fine
yeah, Horimiya was pretty good
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Luchini doing her thing
Panty stealing ep in Konosuba bad, panty stealing ep in Strike Witches good
<a:KazumaPanty:394173309916413953>
Yeah, I get that "I loved this anime when I watched it but every time I think more about it it gets worse" thing
and more Shoujo
more SoL
but like
It has some Revue Starlight feels
Are you watching Kageki Shoujo Antihero?
It's not but people can post nsfw stuff to it I guess
That's why I posted that instead
If it's region locked it's likely blocked on Youtube
There you go
https://streamable.com/549clb
<:shamiEh:692148935959117845>
Anime S2 next year though
https://twitter.com/RanobeSugoi/status/1412781918391730180
This is fantastic news
I assumed the creator was just horny
<a:illyaHuh:789514411617943604>
<a:shamikoangry:748367950876114965>
yeah, that's kinda how I feel too Iski
maybe I'll watch S1 one day
https://twitter.com/MangaMoguraRE/status/1412722284176027650
People here probably care about this
The duality of man

<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
It took me a second to realise you weren't talking about 'So, I Can't Play H'
admittedly it cheats by stealing Monogatari's homework, but <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
but it's just really interesting
It's not the best
I think my favourite romcom is probably Bunny Girl Senpai actually
???
Honzuki is just about a girl who gets reborn in another world and really wants to read books
Honzuki
That's kinda like saying someone's the best doctor at a butcher convention
Isekai's become so gimmicky that the subversion of Konosuba can barely be differentiated from an Isekai played straight
<a:yaywew:443744987759509504>
so uhhh
Apparently it has staff from Maquia, Chihayafuru and Tsuki ga Kirei
Ohh, Aquatope airs soon <a:yaywew:443744987759509504>
<:comf:789441906018222080>
Dragon Maid's still pretty good
<:BayonetHug:745998190339424337>
glad you found a version you can watch though
yeah, it's probably blocked because it can easily be used to avoid state censorship and like reddit it doesn't play ball with governments asking it to block shit in their region
Sorry if I'm wrong, I struggle to remember everyone's location
You're in Indonesia right?
since it doesn't region lock
Or use it to avoid censorship
You didn't really answer anything. The issue with Log Horizon is that it has long, drawn out raid boss snooze fests.
The few times I've thought game mechanics have actually improved something is when they're incredibly abstracted. Bakarinas knowledge or Subaru's save states come to mind.
Ehhhh, that's honestly a lot more credit than Log Horizon deserves I think. The first season works in spite of its game mechanics. The later seasons don't really work and they don't work because of their game mechanics.
Game mechanics in anime are a terrible idea generally too, because they're literally designed for a different medium.
I forced my way through S1 for some reason and it's one of the most boring anime I've ever watched
Slime is shit
Thered only one kind of power fantasy I think ever works, and that's when you take an overpowered protagonist and dump them into a situation where there powers are worse than useless, any attempt to use them will put them further from their goal often without them even realising. (Hint, basically every Shaft anime does this)
You have to be very careful to not have it utterly destroy your characters and narrative
Power fantasy is almost always a negative IMO
Mayne is actually the most frail characters in the series
SnK's "final" season really does jump the shark in a lot of ways
I don't enjoy US propaganda either
That's the problem
No, they're all the same as they were 8 years ago
Do I though?

That's not a high bar
The only good thing about NGNL is the aesthetic
It is, but <:02shrug:443257729646198784>
It doesn't matter if it is or isn't, it's the most influential anime on Isekai as a genre
It has a lot to do with the most influential anime on modern Isekai being SAO
And specifically the shitty power fantasy shounen form of isekai
It's not just a weird call back, it's game mechanics that are so fundimentially built into Isekai as a genre that no-one even thinks of them as that anymore
I'd argue slime does use game mechanics. It's magic system is very reminiscent of a video games system with distinct and defined abilities.
Just saying
Chess is a game
It's abstracted
I do actually believe that Subaru's rewind is based off of video game save states as a root. It feels like it matches too well.

God damn Kyoani knows what they're doing
Yeah, it was super comfy
Even if it is just PA Works flexing
Digging Aquatope so far
They were all boring AF
The issue with dynazenon's characters is that none of them had any, well, character
More natural characters are not inherently better
I thought the character writing and plot in Dynazenon were both drastically inferior to Gridman
I really disagree with that
Gridman's a lot better anyways <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<a:BigYoshi:587256205374914560>
The plot's confusing and hard to follow and it abuses the hell out of technobabble but the show itself is fairly well made and it's enjoyable if you can ignore those two major flaws.
fair enough
It's super comfy and has some really nice art
I mean, even without yuri the first ep's worth a watch

Promo art giving me hope
First ep came out a week ago
yes
They should have just started with the end of ep 1/most of ep 2 honestly
OK, Bakarina got a lot better now that it's not just reintroducing all the characters
Honoka has some gay energy for Miyuki though, but it's just bait based on what happens later <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
~~Miyuki's a good girl who deserves her onii-sama though~~
I feel like this image best describes Mahouka in regards to romance

not 100% sure though
ye, but it feels like it might be more SoL/drama
~~Higurashi too~~
maybe Aquatope or Kageki Shoujo but you have to stretch the definition of cute girl anime

Just be me and watch anime on public transport
Only 17 anime this season <a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Been so used to having anime every day over the past couple of seasons
God, it's so weird that I don't have any seasonals at all tomorrow
<a:DentalHygiene:567655922734989353>
Need to have Gatari DLed for those times when I just feel like watching Nisemonogatari ep 8
This is why I have a 3TB external drive
78 gig
All these plus the folder they're in
So, this counts as 11
That includes sub folders though
This is my anime on my hard drive
<:Papika:650665000653946882>

Still haven't watched the movie and I'm not sure I should
<:heh:789431887135113241>
People say the same about Hibike Eupho and that's literally never stopped anyone
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Or just get stronger yuri goggles
I really like the tall girl
I mean, I was hoping it would be but I'm just enjoying the series
I should probably watch Simoun
https://anilist.co/anime/855/Strawberry-Panic/
2 cour yuri has happened before
Only anime from last season I still haven't finished is Moriarty
yep
Taichi isn't really a side character
same
Harada
The only four series I can think of of the top of my head that have done that are Sangatsu, Monogatari, Chihayafuru and Fruits Basket
There's only a couple of anime ever that have pulled that off
S3 of Chihayafuru was one of the first times I became completely invested in a side character's plotline
I can't say very much about it because it was so far off what I want tonally that I couldn't watch it
<:VanillaPlease:573649151611633685>
Can we get more Chihayafuru though
I think it's part of the reason why Kyoani generally produces very high quality work, because they actually try to use the best plotlines and character arcs they can rather than slavish obedience to the original.
also from my perspective I'd generally prefer a studio to put their own twists into an adaptation rather than just adapt something straight
https://anilist.co/anime/103303/Nijuuseiki-Denki-Mokuroku/
Kinda interested in this one though
~~OVA gave us the best ship from that series though~~
yeah
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
The best part of Chuuni was the OVA
ye, then they tried to railroad it back towards the direction of the LN
They should have just realised that the way they were adapting was basically incompatible with the LN by the end of S2 and did their own thing
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
I wonder if someone's just made a timestamp list of all the scenes with the BF so I can skip them and pretend he doesn't exist
You kinda didn't think that through
and could have definitely done with a little more creativity in the animation
Feels like their normal dialogue heavy shtick
Tantei Shindeiru would have been a great project for Shaft to take up
I could see how you could get from movie to stage play
Yeah, that would kinda explain the weird AF translation too
<:fuck:789441962554032138>
It's pretty promising
https://twitter.com/mobpsycho_anime/status/1414238138944212998
did you see that Tweet Millhi
<:GanyuPray:796941779898597386>
At least it looks likely that we'll be getting Mob Psycho 3
Bishounen Tanteidan and Kubikiri Cycle are worth checking out too
Also, if you enjoy Zetsubou Sensei you probably will enjoy it
It's pretty long but you'd have a fair idea if you like it by the end of Bakemonogatari
<:tsukihiPeek:567655914270883870>
You should check out Monogatari
<:monapoutok:838649256058683433>
I can and that's the best way to watch it
man, I really need my Violet Evergarden movie
Don't agree with your friend anyway, Hibike is fantastic
Liz is far better after Hibike 1/2 for sure
https://anilist.co/anime/6203/Sasameki-Koto/
This is the yuri version of "fun things are fun" I guess
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
I'm finally getting around to Sasameki Koto
<:OMEGALUL:473565787399913483>
Beastars 2 dove off a cliff towards the end
And yeah, it's predicated on Hibike being "ass balls", to which I'd just say Hibike 2 literally has the same rating as Liz
I'm just gonna focus in on 2/2.5 here. The argument people make for Kizu last, which your friend alludes to is that it's meant to build up mystery around the Kizu movies. Your friend argues that Liz first builds up mystery around the events of Hibike. It's literally the same argument.
Which makes the whole argument far more confusing because they then contradict it straight away?
and 2 is literally the argument people make for Gatari last
Fundamentally none of it's true though. Remember that the vast majority of people who have watched Liz watched Hibike first and would not agree with the arguments that are made there.
~~or I could actually finish my PTW list~~
It's a challenge
Yeah, gotta finish in one day
fuck it, may as well
If I got caught in a time loop I'd just play every game I could on steam
Yeah, that sounds about what I'd expect
The vast majority of them deserve it
We're talking about the general anime fandom
my solution is 24x more efficient Mel <:heh:789431887135113241>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1xuvvffLfg
Just watch this instead
Haruhi's too hard
Oh god
That's gonna be committing like, 2 years of your life at least
Best of luck to the idiot who takes on that adaptation
<:KoyoTilt:489285273625034753>
*unless a movie is delayed for 6 years
Feels like the Kizumonogatari argument <:KoyoTilt:489285273625034753>
Fundamentally there's an order that the author of the work wants to reveal information to you in. The work is ordered in a certain way because it's written with the intent of being consumed in this order. Assuming the author isn't a complete fool (and in this case it's KyoAni since it's a loose adaptation) you should probably work on the assumption that the order they laid out makes the most sense.
That's a strange argument that still doesn't make much sense if I'm honest. It's better than "lul Hibike bad", but it still seems to rest on some strange assumptions. Like, it seems to rely on the idea that Hibike is in some way significantly worse than Liz and the Blue Bird, which it's just not. And the last argument is clearly completely reversible. Watching Liz first could have just as large of an impact on your understanding of Hibike as the other way around, probably even more so since it is set after Hibike chronologically, which means it nods to various elements of Hibike and can make them less interesting when you see them in the original or make the nods in Liz not work.
I rest my case
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBrmofOcnrU
Here's my argument on why Hibike is great
If we're going to talk about which is a snoozefest objectively far less actually happens in Liz and it relies far more on SoL rather than a driving plot. That's not to say it's bad but I think it's much more likely you'd get bored watching Liz and the only mitigating factor is its short runtime.
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
<a:JeBaited:849165398900604948>
Man, if Aquatope is bait I'm willing to take it hook line and sinker
It's just been very good <:comf:789441906018222080>
Aquatope has probably been my favourite anime this season so far
the blonde definitely seemed gay, like he was pretty explicit about it
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
It's feeling increasingly gay
Time to see what the hell Sonny Boy even is
<:Help:795762965835546664>
BRR's getting more painful again
Holy fuck <:sweat:457717850220658688>

<:comf:789441906018222080>
Gonna go back to watching my vanilla AF yuri romance I think
~~one of us~~
<a:AkaneParty:516144087921852436>
It was very well done though
<:fuck:789441962554032138>
Wasn't expecting Kageki Shoujo to do that
<:OMEGALUL:473565787399913483>
MHA's filler being better than the main plot again
I actually think she's significantly better
Although, to be fair she's no worse than the main MC
Because Miyuki's popular
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
If they're baiting they're doing a very, very good job of it

<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
High quality trash
Completely shameless ecchi good
Actually, the best first ep may well be Megami-ryou <:LuL:789259461470322728>
again, not the fiercest of competition, but <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
To be fair though, I actually think Kageki is the best anime overall so far this season
There hasn't been an amazing first ep at all this season
I agree
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Pretty much everything this season has just been disappointment
I definitely think the best first ep this season was Aquatope, but its only real competition was Kageki Shoujo
I really don't agree with that
and had some huge issues with some of the directorial choices that were made
I got legit nothing from ep 1
Was it?
I can't
It improves my sanity
I habitually skip isekai
Is a bit weak
There's like, 4 anime total that I'd even recommend. Kageki Shoujo, Maid Dragon, Blue Reflection Ray and Aquatope
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Gonna be honest though, there's not a lot worth watching this season
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
It's actually good
Shoulda just watched the PriPri movie Ash
https://www.crunchyroll.com/en-gb/anime-news/2021/07/20/fena-pirate-princess-hits-crunchyroll-and-adult-swim-on-august-14
some I take my time with
some days I just sit there and watch the whole way through
It really depends for me
2 really lost me towards the end
I'm not sure I'm going to bother with Beastars 3
<:MiaPain:851173875810172928>
Slime is literally the only anime that airs today

there is good stuff from mid 2000's, but like, most of it's just too old
So yeah
And that OP has a jumpscare
One of the anime I'm watching now is Honey and Clover

I love this OP so much
Kase San is a really cute anime
Man, I really respect Kageki Shoujo going to some darker places
Not like Mahouka had anything else going for it
I'm just liking the fanservice
<a:BikiRun:761820843491196969>
I have like 150 anime released over the last 3 years watched
I've probably watched more zoomer anime than most here though <a:shamiQuake:691751384390828092>
My most Boomer anime is Gun Buster
I'm pretty sure there have been ecchi ||and hentai|| mahou shoujo plots before <:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
And to Love Ru is Mahou Shoujo <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Vivy is just a mecha for a computer chip <:heh:789431887135113241>
No-one did any of those things
Also, in Japan Spongebob is anime
It's not enough to just say "this word means this and therefore this is in this genre". Something needs to actually fit the definition that's given
Not a definitive source, but genres have definitions
Initial D is a music anime
Loan words like mech don't always have the same meaning in the language they're loaned to as from.
I disagree with argument one
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
always?
So like
No, but KLK is
Big assumption for AoT
"please help obtain book"
I chose option three
But that
Can't recall if it was the last or second last ep of Shinsekai Yori
Super Driver was amazing
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
If this is bait it's very convincing (Aquatope)
Absolutely insane
Also, for context Bakemonogatari has three OVA exclusive eps that are required to understand future arcs on the blurays, and it outsold that.
She's something else
ye
Still enjoying this stupid series
This girl is actually cute as hell though <:monalurk:781462115692314664>
<:OMEGALUL:473565787399913483>
And the shoujo protag just got even more shoujo
yeah, that's the gayest thing that's happened so far but that's also a pretty high bar
It won't ruin the anime or anything
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Click the spoiler
Holy hell these two are super gay
Not really a spoiler but I'll tag anyway since new ep (BRR)

I mean, the first anime I watched other than Pokemon was this
That's the best part
TBH, the first ep of the second season felt like a huge quality jump
If you enjoy Madoka it's definitely worth watching, just don't expect the first season at least to be as good as the main series
Magia Record is better than most people give it credit for
So, here's the breakdown for Madoka

Main series
OG series (<https://anilist.co/anime/9756/Mahou-Shoujo-MadokaMagica/>)
Rebellion (<https://anilist.co/anime/11981/Mahou-Shoujo-MadokaMagica-Hangyaku-no-Monogatari/>)
Walpurgis (not yet released) (<https://anilist.co/anime/133007/Mahou-Shoujo-MadokaMagica-Walpurgis-no-Kaiten/>)

Spinoff
Magia Record 1, 2, 3 (<https://anilist.co/anime/104051/Magia-Record-Mahou-Shoujo-MadokaMagica-Gaiden/>)
So carry on I guess
https://anilist.co/anime/20918/Tsukimonogatari/
Then again, they've literally done one before anyway
(Shaft is the studio)
IDK, do you call 4 eps a season?
OG series and Rebellion to start
But it's spinoff is the other 2-3 seasons depending on whether you work on normal people timelines of Shaft timelines
The main series of Madoka is the original series, two recap movies, a sequel movie and a second upcoming sequel movie
<:Forbiddenlove:406545981837017098>
Spinoff
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
The difference between Madoka and Tantei wa Mou (I watched both today) shows how important cinematography is in heavy dialogue sequences
<:noContract_MM:586871023949971456>
Jesus Shaft, calm down
<:sweat:457717850220658688>
That chase scene though
ye, at least S3 is confirmed though
Holy head tilts <:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
||Homura!!! <:HomuLove_MM:664115195160821771> ||
<:noContract_MM:586871023949971456>
Time to watch Meduka
Shit's hilarious
If not look it up
Did you guys ever see the Mami USB btw?
Anyway, I enjoyed watching Shaft spend a small countries budget for one ep today <:comf:789441906018222080>
||<:MamiHasNoHead1_MM:588882044319432704> 
<:MamiHasNoHead2_MM:588882044113780752>||
Also, the majority of the first season was build-up for the last two or so eps
<:HomuPeep_MM:856646640584359966>
Homura is the bestest girl and never did anything wrong
so they just kinda let it run
and they never got any
I think the logic was that once they aired ep 1, unless they got a huge amount of negative feedback it didn't make sense to stop
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
They just forgot to actually check it was a kids anime till after the first ep
Remember that almost every kids show here is imported with a few notable exceptions anyway, so it's actually been common practice to import whatever subbed kids anime they can get for a cheap slot filler in Aus
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1mda5g/tonight_the_final_episode_of_madoka_magica_airs/
Just a reminder that this happened
It's actually very easy to see the links between the two
Also Hidamari Sketch
<:TOPLEL:499474844694609920>
I'm as trash as the anime I watch
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
I actually need the incest tones thanks
Honestly, I'd advise it to anyone here just based off the fact this is a gear server
I don't really want to spoil anything so all I'll say is I'd strongly recommend just checking the first ep out
<a:BanaNice:501549702383140865>
Revue Starlight is a top tier anime
Just felt like a hard repeat with 0 added value
Also watching the last arc felt like E8 to me. I'd already pieced together basically everything that happened anyway, it wasn't that hard
OK, but what about all the scenes that are literally shared. Assume your viewers aren't idiots and just cut them.
Endless 8 theory applies, recutting and refilming the same events from a different camera angle is not interesting. That's what the majority of the eps are. The different PoV makes up only a tiny fraction.
Yes, and I'd argue that it's always been bad
Which makes up at least 2/3rds of each ep
By cutting the vast majority of the shit we've already seen
These arcs could easily be condensed into a single ep.
I almost fell asleep during the last ep because I pretty much knew everything that would happen.
But like, this is a ham fisted and IMO outright bad way to do a parallel answers arc, because we're just seeing the exact same shit over and over
Remember I'm an idiot who fell for the "It's a reboot guys" bait
I'm not sure I like the way they're making this season of Higurashi at all
Well, there might be, it depends on how deceptive Echidna was being though
||There is though||
<a:cute_lurkin:625106084641898506>
Kobayashi instead
<:monaderpy:854593417585491988>
Man, I love how in Aquatope they turn a car around by literally skidding across the road rather than just using the fucking turn lane 15 meters up the road
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
This always happens
fuck, I like tsunderes too much
<:monablush:782177196264390716>
Milika is like, the perfect tsundere
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I quite like the Fuka arc
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Watch it and decide yourself
I'm not going to trawl through a ton of random shorts and LNs when I don't even enjoy the formats
I just watched the anime and it's fine <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
You could do the other order and be fine
It doesn't really matter that much though
First season>Washio>Hero Chapter
the first season is by far my favourite
Washio really didn't actually do it for me
<:NotLikeYuzu:827360021062352896>
ahhhh, that Blue Reflection Ray ep
She covers her embarrassment with both anger and an inflated self righteousness <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Tsun's don't need to be violent (although Milika is anyway), they just cover their actual emotions/affection with another. Milika comes off as very aggressive while she's actually not feeling that.
yes
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
You know, this is actually a better answer to that question
It's not though

because everyone always knew ex-arm was going to be shit and there was never any hope for it?
Oh well, still beats whatever the fuck happened with Wonder Egg
Also, it really feels like they're split couring to improve the overall quality, not because the series is an afterthought
It's honestly fine, but it's a slower buildup season
Season two has really upped the general quality, but I feel like a lot of people expected way too much from S1
<:chrisDelete:616150739701596169>
<:KoyoTilt:489285273625034753>
Yep
https://anilist.co/character/179366/Zain
"Is this random side character Araragi?"
it's very emotionally flat though
not really
also, I think even Ex Arm had better awareness of the emotions it was meant to be giving off than this <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Only done animation directing before, which would explain why the direction seems somewhat muddled I guess
Makes sense
The director isn't actually a director
or maybe script writers too
Feels like an anime where everyone else was pretty competent and the directer is actively trying to sabotage it <:LuL:789259461470322728>
god, Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru is an absolute directing disaster
none of it other than the general feel and a few characters are from the game though
kinda
It's a game adaptation
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Actually I guess two so far as I'm concerned since BRR isn't actually adapting
Even this season has a really solid (so far) original, so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
https://anilist.co/anime/99426/Sora-yori-mo-Tooi-Basho/
no it's not
Already done
Was going to mention Sora Yori
He really is the best character by a lot <:LuL:789259461470322728>
I'm just going through the best lines in the show in my head right now and like 80% of them involve or reference Kaiki
but instead of dark comedy you have philosophy and ecchi
very much so
yes
ËÇâËÇâËÇâ„Å†

Here's a spoiler free example of how good the dialogue is though

It's as close as anime's gotten to Shakespeare
Yep
whereas BGS can get pretty heavy handed at points
It's about the characters and the way they and the plot interact with the underlying themes, I just think Monogatari's subtly and ability to get that across without needing to outright say it is fantastic
In both cases the anime isn't actually about what's happening on screen
They do?
which keeps it from running into the E8 problem of just wanting it to be over
Each ep is different, but also has the same overarching storyline
<:heh:789431887135113241>
And BGS is just a worse Monogatari
~~suck it Haruhi~~
The Tatami Galaxy is how to do the Endless 8 right
<a:YuzuHype:827505533345857567>
That's hype as hell though
~~I'm still salty about how much missed potential Irozuku had though~~
at least it's going to look good either way
PA Works always has an amazing attention to detail
Chat's becoming an FBI doc again <:heh:789431887135113241>
<:ChrisSip:660514247935000576>
Eva's exactly my kind of pretentious BS
I thought it was 96
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Wait
<:comf:789441906018222080>
Mid-late 90s gave us Eva so I'm happy with it
I really haven't watched much old anime
Later than I thought then
Oh
It's mid 90s isn't it?
I'm terrible at remembering when old anime aired
When was Cowboy Bebop again?
An unsalvagable wreck is far better than a boring anime <:SadClarkson:760923263039176744>
Just boring?
Ex Arm was fantastic
Admittedly is sometimes find technically terrible anime hilarious
And if you want to watch an anime for sick curiosity Mars of Destruction and SkelterxHeaven exist
<:NotLikeYuzu:827360021062352896>
<a:HomuRun_MM:663774256135667722>
<a:HomuDespair_MM:393858540709871628>
Time for my weekly suffering magical girls
Yeah
<:kokowant:870169015639760936>
~~give me Sangatsu S3 already~~
I want to know everything that every character is thinking
I'm a big fan of slower paced shows generally
<:Kaiki:325760553794666496>
You should give Second Season a shot though. It has probably the best arc I've ever seen in anime. Koimonogatari is some next level stuff.
People sleep on 2018, but like, Sora Yori, Yaga Kimi, After the Rain and most importantly, Citrus
I think my top 3 are 2011, 2015 and 2018
Yeah, I was mostly meming Nise
Fucking January the 8th toi
Was it?
Wait
<a:DentalHygiene:567655922734989353>
For that is the year that gave us
2011 is one of the best years IMO
Low-key one of the best CGDCT anime
Hidamari Sketch though
Man, I need to get around to Utena some time soon actually
I mean, if you want Clannad where the main girl is actually a decent character from the start Kanon does exist
Yeah, can't agree with that one. Nagisa isn't the best girl in early Clannad but she kinda has to be that way because a lot of the series is about her growth as a character. She ends up being far more interesting than the others IMO just due to how much more development she gets as a character.
Ensembles are best when they're heavily biased to actually allow time for a select few characters to be explored in depth, longer than 12/3 eps or both
Actually, credit to Koyomi, because he actually got close to getting me to care about him
It's better to have one, very strong, fleshed out character than 5 walking tropes with no real depth
It had a bad cast <:LuL:789259461470322728>
I cared about one character in Gridman and 0 in Dynazenon
Gridman was a lot more introspective and that's actually the thing I liked about it.
See, I never cared about the animation. I enjoyed Gridman because Akane felt like an interesting character who got a lot of in depth exploration. Dynazenon felt like it was as wide as an ocean and as deep as a puddle. It wanted to give all it's characters so much screen time that by the end none of them really felt fleshed out and to me at least it felt like it was just trying to use action scenes to cover up it's weaknesses with character.
At all
Like
Ehhh, I really didn't like Dynazenon
Sorry about the format (mobile) but ima go with this year
Probably legit not happening
And Golden Time
I mean, Chihiyafuru is good
2013's a pretty nothing year for me if I'm honest.  It has Kyosogigia, Monogatari Second and Beyond the Boundry, but past those plus a couple of other shows it falls off hard
It's actually when the series ditches most of the school aspects and focuses in super hard on Tomoya and Nagisa
It's not right at the start of the season
It starts improving a bit into S2 IIRC
It goes from a pretty meh school romcom to legit peek anime
Clannad does have one of the sharpest quality jumps in the second season of any show I've ever seen though
And uhhh, watch Odd Taxi
It went from OK to actually fairly good
I didn't hater it at the start
It gets better after the 10thish ep
But this year is already looking pretty good
Gonna subject you to my weird zoomer taste now
G>S1>XV>AXZ>The ending of Oreimo>GX
My Little Sister got fucking Robbed
It almost had the best ending any anime's ever had that quickly became the worst ending any anime's ever had
The rest are pretty meh or I haven't seen
<a:YuzuBlush1:827360787260899344>
I love Citrus
<:YuzuNoHope:827525270722183180>
I legit did get one of my friends to watch Oreimo, but also Citrus, Symphogear and Monogatari
I have got people to watch various random anime though
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
I just recommend Oreimo
Really not something I'm at all interested in
Yeah, I almost always gravitate towards slow, character driven dramas and psychological/mystery shows
Fruits Basket, Bishounen and Odd Taxi were the real standouts to me
But I've been going on a weird seasonal anime streak so there's that
I don't think you've actually watched any of the shows I really liked this year
I was there for the tiddy
Eh
<:ayaya:518530944878247936>
Elf is cute
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
I really enjoyed it
Demon Lord was great
Oi
this was dumb af, yeah
Na, I could tell I wasn't going to enjoy that one immediately
Those 7 must have been pretty bad
<:YuzuFailedSmug:827303707230076959>
something
because my PFP is uhhhh
You're gonna have to do the same if you want to see mine
ye
Pretty good
Watched Cider no You
It's still false advertising <:worryjam:702740429669400626>
Dogeza was fun
As long as the site is recognised
Both
<:taigaCHARGE:468021601951154187>
There's a program called Taiga, it's always just checking for videos I open and if it finds a name match it knows I'm watching that anime, then it checks the title for a number and works out the ep based off that.
You might actually be able to do that on MAL now though if their SIP is functional. There was a longass time when you couldn't though
My anilist autoupdates whenever I watch anything so it's honestly beating MAL on that front too
Anilist is a much better designed website
Basically just MAL but with slightly less brigading
<:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>
Fruits Basket is still first on anilist though
~~And the best series of recent times was Fruits Basket~~
Yeah, I'm with Cypher on that, no I'll will towards people who enjoy it but I just don't past those fact that the last season actually managed to be bad-good at some points
The politics are like what an edgy 15 year old thinks they should be like
I thought the last season was total garbage and from what I've heard it just gets worse
I'm just here for the dumpsterfire at this point
Thank God it's almost done
It's not amazing or anything, but seems worth a watch
IDK, I thought it was fine
Yeah
Feels like a Disney film
It's OK
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Aoi really is in every anime
You're saying Keijo!!!!!!!! isn't the 8th season?
Then the movie
K-On!>K-On!!
It's OK
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Why does Uramichi Oniisan actually have a god tier voice cast
<a:2bLurk:638483529637953566>
I'm actually going to finish Honey and Clover today
big same
Nothing amazing, but a good example of how a great cast of VAs can carry an otherwise mediocre show
<:ARRYAYA:470759923823804417>
Thank god pirates don't have to seek rights
~~and also Station mcstationface~~
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
We tried to name our new stations Ogdenville, North Haverbrook and Brockway
<:Sad:586882015392169984>
I read horse racing and had hope for a second
It's not even a parody
Konosuba became retroactively worse too because Isekai is just Konosuba now
Probably the most exciting thing for me next season is Blue Period. Because you give me an anime about art that has a Picasso reference in the title and I'm 100% watching that.
Yeah, gonna agree with Ikxi there. Konosuba was just an annoying anime and I really don't need more of it.
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
yeah, whenever anything's compared to Konosuba it makes me not want to watch
It's actually up there with Kizumonogatari for some of the best animation work they've ever done
Yeah, the spin off that's airing this season has been absolutely insane
Shaft's been going absolutely wild on Madoka
Seems directionless
Been a huge issue for the show post S2
Plot/characters
This feels like one of the worst anime I've ever watched
but like
I've not been a fan of anything post S2
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
I swear this season of MHA just keeps getting worse and worse
and apparently has been yote off the internet
4 years before Kakushigoto got an anime
https://anilist.co/anime/115925/Kakushigoto-PV/
Remember this existed
That stuff's been done for manga/LNs before
Ehhh
Footage of Mappa attempting to animate AoT <:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
<a:YuuNom:649351667329925122>
Aquatope's been nice so far
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
last season with Bishounen, Fruits Basket, Odd Taxi, Cub, Mars Red and Shadows House was actually kinda insane
I'd disagree with that
no, next season as in the next season of anime generally
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Next season looks pretty weak though
I can do both
<a:HibikiEatGood:688429714876006520>
Consuming garbage is great though
So hyped for S2
<a:shamiRoll:713407806497095740>
<:YuzuPeekCIT:520563054367211535>
Not like that comment's ever been made in a yuri manga before
It's not quite explicit in the same way as Citrus or Yaga Kimi, but it's like, the next category down
Aoi Yuuki?
<a:BikiRun:761820843491196969>
Best bedroom scene was in Kase-san
One of gears B sides is absurdly gay too
Maybe I should actually watch this at some point
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
That's out of left field
Gotta admit though, wouldn't have called a Wii Fit boxing anime
<:Kapp:789259331072819241>
Does Wand of Gamalon count?
<:Angry_Jigglypuff:682320019535036467>
but I don't view that as a positive
I guess disgust if it's presented in that way
You don't always feel anything when a characterised character dies, but you'll pretty much never feel anything when an uncharacterised one does
and Serena isn't
It's because Kanade's characterised
and it still hits like a ton of bricks because of how well the show crafts the episode around her and uses the development of the main character in the episode to frame it
Just continuing on from that, There's an example of a character who's built up to die from the minute she's introduced in Violet Evergarden, I think the show even explicitly states she will at the start of the episode
Highlight of Pirate Princess so far is Aoi Yuuki being Aoi Yuuki
God, I really don't remember anything from that movie
<a:kokomibait:877073721666449408>
Looks like a happy and fun time
I should watch that
Oh yeah, they released a trailer didn't they
<a:very_gay:626187304817524746>
<a:crabRave:789513139754237992>
Because the very obvious and logical extension is "it's always been bad"
I mean, if you feel like something's a cop out or a cliche "that's how it's always been" isn't an argument.
Also, the worst IMO is Endeavour from MHA, even though he's actually one of the best characters in that series
If you're going to do a redemption arc you need to hint at the character not being an irredeemable cunt from the start
Yep
but I also don't really like the ultimate evil bad guy that much anyways
Personally I'm not a fan of kicking puppies
because like, it's really good
I'm going to deflect to Noragami S2 again for an example of how to make minor character deaths feel impactful
It can be fine if it's being done to explore the impact it has on a character
*cough* AoT
I'd agree with purposeless deaths not being great either
Yes
Oh, I guess TTGL too, but I just didn't care nearly as much
||Ebisu deserved better||
definitely did hit me pretty hard when it happened though
And hey, look, another anime with revival that doesn't fall into DBZ territory
was trying to think of an anime where this happened and I think the only one I can think of off the top of my head is Noragami S2
To be fair though, I don't know anyone who watched it and didn't like it
yep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IH4DK-h3iQ
It's so good <:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Rakugo Shinjuu is one of the best anime I've ever seen and it really doesn't get the love it deserves
I think one really interesting way to handle it and one of my all time favourites was Rakugo Shinjuu where during the first episode you learn one of the important characters in the story died in the past, but throughout the story there's about three different unreliable narrators who give their accounts of the death and what happened and none of them line up with each other.
any series with revival has trivialised the stakes of death unless it treats it the way Re:Zero does
Especially not when you can go to the god dragon 5 minutes later and wish them back to life
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
I think Fruits Basket is an example of doing this well, death of mother discussed in ep 1, the entire story is warped around it and the more you learn about it the more it breaks you
It can also be big by warping the whole narrative around it
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Unfortunately this also means that almost all the character deaths I think are good are completely riddled with spoilers
This pretty much explains how I feel about this topic
https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/728496-there-is-a-distinct-difference-between-suspense-and-surprise-and
To be fair though, my favourite way to write character death is the opposite of Kanade, rather than surprise/out of nowhere slow, predictable and known to the characters to some extent before it happens.
It's 100% just there for shock value
because the plot is just way to predictable and boring
I was thinking about Tantei Mou Shindeiru specifically when I said that
Understandable
but I can definitely think of a few recent anime that would have benefited from obscuring elements of their plots
Oh yeah, it'd get too much if it was in everything
They're interesting as hell when used right
I really wish more stories would use unreliable narrators though
but I really like it
IDK if that's even really a redemption arc
I've seen it done a couple of times and it can be really interesting to see the evil character that was built up literally unravel as you learn more
I do find the idea of using an unreliable narrator to shit the point of view and make the acts that your redemption character committed actually decrease over the course of the story to be pretty interesting though
and it's absurdly easy to write a rational that feels either contrived or cliche too
yeah, to actually have a redemption the sins need to either not be that bad to begin with (normally most applicable to children's TV) or there needs to be a very good underlying reason for them. What we got with Milliarc is an example of the reasons just not being good enough at all.
I feel like it's generally better not to touch them unless you really know what you're doing with them, because they can suck so bad so easily
Redemption arcs are crazy hard to do right though
To bring up my favourite 'almost an anime' example, Zuko is probably the best written redemption arc I've ever seen
I really do feel like characters you plan to redeem later should be written more as antagonists than villains though
It really is
When's that ever stopped a S2 before?
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
It's very good
I'd second trying bookworm

Oh yeah, ||Mami's still crazy||

yeah
Odd Taxi

Mine's tsundere aparently
is very cute
but Words Bubble up like Soda Pop
Oh, and it's a movie rather than a series
I really liked Bisounen Tanteidan
yes
nice costume too <:monalurk:781462115692314664>
I'll check S1 tomorrow
so it might not actually end up meaning shit if a fansubber picks it up <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Looks like it's two weeks behind Japan though
For the first time in like 3 years
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/pkoaj8/blue_period_will_stream_new_episodes_weekly_on/
Yo, Netflix actually streaming an anime weekly
Totally is
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Is that in the actual ep?
Mother fucker
<:NadekoFries:591296872094892035>
That has a server
it's worth watching
Release the Spyce is fun
Best I can do is Antarctica playing the role of the antagonist
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/plicgd/magical_girl_destroyers_first_visual/

<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
More edgy magical girl trash
Why do I even talk, just watched this weeks ep <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Maybe they'll remove that on bluray, I don't think it'll be fully uncensored or anything but I could see lensflares being removed
yeah
I'm here for the trash
This is optimal
hard disagree
nice
"you feel the same hollowness and emptiness as the characters"
I think you'll enjoy it
Honestly feels like one of the more "back to basics" shows I've seen recently
Does Blue Reflection count as this?
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
why does everything have a gacha
yeah, I think the difference is that I'll recommend anything I found enjoyable, not just the best stuff
Shadows House S2

<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>

~~I'm still partial to the one embarrassed and the one "get the hell out before I stab you" approach though~~
<a:YuuShake:519067953887576064>
It can be nice though
yeah, it's very unusual to not show a character's face on a cover
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
if anything that's increasing the odds of them getting together
Seriously though, when's that ever stopped a single anime or manga character?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwB_nKXCbaQ
This trailer did a good job engaging my monkey brain (flashing lights warning though)
hell yeah
And I'll vouch for Kageki Shoujo being very good
It's Satelite so <:comf:789441906018222080>
You should check out Sakugan too
I really don't care that much about animation and it's never actually been bad enough for me to notice
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I don't even consider Kano mo Kano guilty pleasure, it's lowkey good
Yes, it's been very good so far
Fena's just the easiest thing to type
either is fine

https://anilist.co/anime/129277/Shinigami-Bocchan-to-Kuro-Maid/
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
and yeah, this season has Kageki Shoujo, Kano mo Kano, Aquatope, Magia Record, Koboyashi, Fena and Bocchan, so I don't think I can call it bad personally
It's OK
I wouldn't call next season stacked
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
true, weird thing is most of them actually look quite good though
What the hell happened?
Has anyone else realised that there's 6 mecha anime next season?
<:comf:789441906018222080>
On the topic of seasonal anime I caught up with Shinigami Bocchan again and it really is one of the best shows this season

Irozuku was conceptually great, it had a fantastic premise and fine enough characters, but it just felt wasted on a half baked plot to me
Kinda got rushed into a single cour

If PA Works manage to stick the landing (and they don't always) this will be one of my favourite series
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
It was so good
Personally I'm just more interested in the drama and long form TV series tend to do that better
The good stuff <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
I refuse to accept reality
Not like they have any chemistry in the series either
<:KumikoxReina:660514723938304003>
There's still a chance
wait, this is the first time a spoiler's ever made me want to watch a movie more
Now that would be a twist
Yeah, I was half expecting her to burst out into song in the middle of the rink
That trailer actually looks fairly decent
I'd say Kanon
Nope, your drop list is even more confusing <:LuL:789259461470322728>

I'm just going to say Shinmai Maou because it has the lewdest cast
honestly
most of them are pretty shit

S1's OP is better though

you like SAO
I mean
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I kinda like it
~~Yosuga no Sora~~
because it's pretty lewd
So, I'ma post something Shinmai Maou related but in shitposting
Date a Live but lewder
10cm hurdle cleared <:heh:789431887135113241>
you can be at the bottom without being as disgusting as MT's MC
yeah, no
There's cases where it's OK, but what I've read about MT far oversteps that line
It depends, define disliking the MC
I haven't watched it (and don't plan to) but I'm just stating the logic of how to analyse situations like this
The ultimate reason is because the author wrote the character in a certain way, so if you feel that the character is problematic (which is a lot of the criticism I've seen) then other aspects of the text can't be used to justify it because the author also wrote them.
<:comf:789441906018222080>
This is optimal
Fuck I'll take random highschool anime over isekai any day
What's wrong with all of you <a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
yeah, I totally would
He also ||fucks his sister on Christmas night||, which is really something
<:kirinoSmug:823590403898998834>
Anime is great if you just pretend the last 5 minutes didn't happen
<:kirinoPout:499471452073099267>
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
The point of that ep was that she probably couldn't have stopped it
100%
Slime 300 is also SoL
yes
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
I actually love hard SoL anime like Sangatsu

I'd have to look into the ep with the girl again, but I can definitely remember that, for various reasons helping her is less simple than you might think
Except coriander, those fucking plants have an insatiable will to die
This is how you get a "cane toads in Australia" situation
Is there ever an implication that if the plant's all dead there wouldn't be problems or is that just what you've surmised?
Again, one of the points was that acting with little thought is what causes issues, you can't just burn down the entire field because the smoke from the plant burning is heavily implied to be one of the things that attracts people to the plant.

I want to see Ash react to Monogatari

She hasn't actually done that much acting
https://anilist.co/staff/119900/Rikako-Aida
<:heh:789431887135113241>
Because like, that's most of what I watch
fair warning, the anime I recommended are almost all SoL heavy
It's been a good ride so far though
so you'd end up waiting on weekly releases
I didn't check
ye
It is, but it's up to about ep 12/24 or something
I guess existential would be the correct word
Violet Evergarden can be pretty dark too, but in a slightly more real way than Fate
ye, same
PA Works is probably more hit/miss when it comes to actual quality
I guess literally anything by PA Works or KyoAni is going to look visually impressive though
Anything by Kyoto Animation: Violet Evergarden, Beyond the Boundary, Hibike Euphonium.

Sangatsu no Lion, Maquia, Weathering with You, if you like weird artstyles Kyousogiga, Sora Yori and if you want to jump into something currently airing  Shiroi Suna no Aquatope
can't give you Fate advice but I definitely know some pretty anime
That's normally what happens
There's enough here
If you wait for 5 minutes a Fate fan will appear
I'll let everyone else murder each other on which one you start with though <:heh:789431887135113241>
I think the general starting point is Stay Night or Zero
https://animethemes.moe/video/HeikeMonogatari-ED1.webm

same

*bluray players
I'm surprised enough people still have blurays to support them honestly
Carol and Tuesday is a recent example I can think of
Some anime are made with western/chinese audiences heavily in mind
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
What do I need to do to get S2 of Yaga Kimi though
I enjoyed it <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:heh:789431887135113241>
gotta finish One Room soon
may be for the best
Can't find it
uhh
Oh no
But I'll look it up
No
I find it completely hilarious
I just have a thing for absolute gutter trash anime

God, the Citrus manga is so good and the anime doesn't do it justice
he hasn't seen Yaga Kimi
I think he has
||It has penguins||
Watch it though Ash
AdachiShima is good too
I'd say Kase San/Liz and the Blue Bird
Fuck dude, I want S2 so bad
not quite as good
but all the things below it are uhhhh

MHA has just been dumpster in general
It's honestly been fine
gonna be brutally honest, MHA felt more unfinished to me
I'll take 8 eps of quality over 25 pure shit
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Magi Reco is far better though
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
I will never understand shounen fans
No reason to watch anymore
S5 is rock bottom
S4 was already a low point
S5 was their chance for that
~~there is no S6~~
Like one of the worst anime I've ever watched
Absolute trash tier
not watching this anymore
Thank god
MHA is over
I don't even think it's low effort, it's just a strange direction
yeah, the artstyle seems really weird
<:heh:789431887135113241>
~~in the trash?~~
<a:YuzuHype:827505533345857567>
Cup Mug S2
Shoujo protag was pretty close though
Not explicit
<:comf:789441906018222080>
Nice ending
Finished up BRR
<:OMEGALUL:473565787399913483>
Bokutachi no Remake spoiler/meme
even you don't believe that
Kageki Shoujo was pretty unique
and 10 of them are just copy/pasted isekai that don't need to exist
IDK if I can be bothered
<:OMEGALUL:473565787399913483>
It's still better than any ep from MHA S5
I find the visual medium easier to watch, but I actually don't care that much about animation quality
animation is far, far less so
hell no they're not equally important
and MHA feels like it was written by a 5 year old
Writing quality is a lot more important than visual quality
Na man
<:monaderpy:854593417585491988>
Nice of Funi to not actually sub their anime
He was a bit annoyed he didn't after
I'm from Leicester to explain why
My dad almost did
I think 200 was the largest bet anyone confirmed
basically just don't give odds that absurd <:LuL:789259461470322728>
as well
someone did put 200 on them and win a mil back
because like, why not?
Tons of people just randomly threw 10 pounds on them
English premier league. The team that had just been promoted into the league that year won
They're never making that mistake again
Leicester City was the best betting odds you were probably ever going to get. Betting markets learned their lesson after they lost 15 mil paying out 50k to every stooge who put 10 pounds on Leicester.
<:OMEGALUL:473565787399913483>
5000:1
They gave some jank ass odds to that one
Also betting everything on Leicester City in 2015/6
I'd take back a list of lotto numbers <:heh:789431887135113241>
The philosophical problem here is that if they don't know what else was possible they can't actually decide which life is better. The only person who has that ability is the MC and it's subject to his biases. The viewer is also subject to the MC's biases due to perspective.
<:comf:789441906018222080>
best girl
I'd have just chilled with Shinoaki personally
Girl design was good though
I'm kinda interested in if this just ends up being ||him having children with every girl then going back in time and deleting them||
Making a mistake, see you guys in 10 years when I get out <a:panic:589215632772431893>
Madoka is one of my all time favourites, so it's not just the author, it's the whole frequent callbacks to lore I find utterly disinteresting thing. I don't see why other Fates would be remotely different.
not good
Fate was just
I do like what Urobuchi does though
Like, I don't just dislike 0, I consider it one of the worst anime I've ever watched
Based on what I saw from 0 I wouldn't have liked any of them
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Yeah, I really have no interest in UBW/HF at all
Zero just made me stop caring and zone out, I 100% would have dropped it if I wasn't watching with someone else
<:OMEGALUL:473565787399913483>
I mean, I'm enjoying it more than Zero so far
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Man, I'm just here for garbage
thinks its lore is a lot more interesting than it is
Same problem as every other fate I've seen so far
ye
<a:trashPls:789514891735334944>
I was expecting more, uhhhh
So far I'm bored as hell honestly
No, not in that way
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
So far this is less bad than I expected, which I guess raises the question of what I expected
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Nise is great though
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
I say this only partially as a meme, it gets better after the 3rd season
3 movies in 2 minutes
<:OMEGALUL:473565787399913483>
That was just Kizumonogatari
Oh
yeah, fair, it's dense AF
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Kizu 3 is one of the high points for the series
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
BTW Cypher, the movies that come after Bake have my favourite fightscene ever, one of the few I actually feel improves the material around it
Good shit
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
I still remember that one scene in Nise where Yozuru stops beating up Koyomi, explains to him why she thinks Kaiki is a cunt then goes back to beating him up
actual philosophy
and not anime philosophy
At least in Monogatari they stop fighting to exchange philosophy <:OMEGALUL:473565787399913483>
By the end of the first half I completely stopped caring
I started off disinterested but it actually got worse as the first half progressed
Monogatari's like 90% exposition <:LuL:789259461470322728>
It's just bad exposition
It's not overexposition
Exposition can be done well. Monogatari, Sangatsu no Lion, Fruits Basket and Clannad are all highly dependant on it and I consider them to be some of the best I've ever seen. They just manage to not be absurdly boring when doing it.
<a:HomuDance_MM:629653836683935744>
<:TopNep:230128322468642817>
I've watched Monogatari
Yeah, Monogatari artists having questionable tastes doesn't surprise me
Perhaps he should be <:monkaMega:789259580528918558>
Just ep 7
no
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Illya went from "not that bad" to "go to jail" over the course of one ep
~~it has the best shower scene of any arc~~
Actually, Tsubasa Tiger is an arc I really enjoy personally
Tsubasa Tiger is fine
The standalone
I actually think Neko is a lowpoint for the series
Everyone writes it off as fanservice but it's honestly two well above average arcs with the best ep inbetween them
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
arguably they should have done that in the first place then
Super hyped for YuYuYu though
It was pretty nice
All this starting on one day
<a:AkaneParty:516144087921852436>
There's only two of them but it is better than Ganbare, Douki-chan
Best anime I've seen so far this season
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
not in Australia <a:KEK:740160662721921104>
Could be a recap I guess? But I haven't heard anything so I'd assume new ep
aquatope in ~4h

Oh, and Scums Wish (my beloved)
<:heh:789431887135113241>
there is a trend
Just the ones I could think of
So, trash anime with great OPs, DomexKano, Koi to Uso, Netsuzo TRap, Kano mo Kano, Citrus, Oreimo (both seasons) and Attack on Titan
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
God the ending of that Aquatope ep
not sure how I feel about the new Aquatope OP
Adachi and Shimamura
I think that's the only time I've ever seen the issue taken seriously
The actual answer to this is Wandering Son
<:heh:789431887135113241>
Probably not
<:comf:789441906018222080>
Time for Yuuki Yuuna
She's just Barbara's clone
<:BarbaraLewd:754359107162734600>
Probably Nyaa soon

One of the characters is the "world's greatest politician" but his policy is just crappy liberalism

Speaking of which, I still need to watch chuni Pete Buttigieg getting isekaied and taking over the world with vapid and ineffectual politics
<:AquaHeh:585570589201268760>
Could be a great hatewatch
It's a super mixed bag series for me right now. The robot stuff was fun but the nationalistic propaganda totally has the potential to derail and destroy the series.
Like honestly, if they'd focused on it being a US invasion those lines would be cheesy, but they'd actually work
Feels like it's meant to be a parody of the US
But like, there's a big difference between your invading force being the US/Brits and Oceana which contains a whole lot of island's that Japan occupied
It feels like it looked at Code Geass and went "they did Japan getting invaded decently, why can't we"
Anime has all the yikes takes
"Japan opened up to foreigners and it's economy crashed"
That got me
Yeah
Like, god I actually hate the world building but the mechs are cool
IDK, why is anything in this show the way it is honestly.
While I did enjoy ep 1 of Kyoukai Senki, I do have to say that having Japan be invaded by Oceania is absurdly insensitive and overtly revisionist. Why does Japan always do this shit <:sigh:230149462880813056>
<:monalurk:781462115692314664>

<:monalurk:781462115692314664>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmR88IewfH0
oh, and Violet Evergarden
YLiA, Clannad and Sora Yori are super close though
Probably Fruits Basket for me
God, one of the reasons I'm looking forward to S2 is for the shitposts though
Shamiko is a friendly demon
It kinda is
I'll be honest, I don't even know how to describe it fully. It's like CGDCTs comedy mahou shoujo with a dash of shitpost
The mythical mahou shoujo with no suffering
https://anilist.co/anime/107490/Machikado-Mazoku/
https://tenor.com/view/machikado-mazoku-shamiko-momo-cute-bite-tail-gif-15973010
the ending of S1 got pretty gay so I was hoping it pushed further
fair enough
Ash how gay does the manga get out of interest?
Also Shamiko's wife
and the reaction was something else
I was watching it as it aired
That one's great
technically
Oh, Machikado Mazoku is a mahou shoujo
I think Odd Taxi has it beat though just because people pieced it together
It's probably the best of the more pure asspull plot twists
But uhh, Banana's plot twist is one of my favourites I've seen in anime for the last couple of years
actually pretty hyped for that
I wonder when the movie will be ripped/subbed
for some reason
I adore Banana
~~I probably could have worked that out if I used my 3 brain cells~~
I think Starlight pulls quite a bit from Utena IIRC
<a:BanaNice:501549702383140865>
That one's good
Have you seen Revue Starlight Lily?
Arguably the root is Utena

Kinda, she's not really a villain though
<:astroWeird:661103291333345280>
Yeah, they just started
which I'm OK with
It actually leaned heavier into CGDCTs territory than I was expecting and less into hockey

<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
yep
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
Pride of Orange is actually a lot better than I expected
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
fuck, it's actually Love Live on Ice
It's completely unrelated
Monogatari just means story
The best anime so far this season is Heiki Monogatari <:02lurk:443257729767964672>
<a:YuzuHype:827505533345857567>

what did you expect?

There is actually a notable trend of seinen being significantly less dark than shounen because dark=/=mature
Edgy dark anime are normally shounen

I think for me it's like Sakugan>Heiki>Puraore>Space Vampire>Selection Project>Muv Luv>Kyoukai Senki>Takt
Yeah, Heiki's a show that needs a ton of attention
yep
but that had a weird ass airing time
oh, and Heiki
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
The only two first eps I've watched this season and thought were good are Sakugan and Pride of Orange
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I love this already
Like 1 minute into Sakugan

What if we took Kaos and put her in a mech
Hear me out
Somehow
It worked for YU-NO
Know what we need to save mecha? More CGDCT.
Honestly
I'd actually prefer not
Yes
Maybe it was just ultra low expectations though
Muv Luv was surprisingly watchable too
Sackandgun seems pretty good so far though <:hehe:789442021856116807>
True, but if it were just quality there'd be a ton of other genres that would sink first
But like
The average Isekai is far worse than the average mecha

I can't recall the full name
Mug Cup
||tickling||
Exactly what it looks like
but not bad
The first ep was pretty meh to me honestly
Immensely so
<@!171395487247630336>
<:comf:789441906018222080>
Really nice Mug Cup ep
I actually have very little this season
AoT S4 was the point at which AoT completely fell apart
very, very poorly
Uhhhh
I would
yes
The best they achieve is mediocrity and often they fall well short of that
Hard disagree
And I do like some of the earlier Simpsons
because all I could do was think about it
It failed then
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
this is a PoV that I've held for a very long time
If a show falls apart because you stopped to think about it it was actually never good
Saying "because it's a comedy" doesn't make it better
no thanks
The manager was just straight up abusive and the show wants to play it off as comedy
I literally couldn't watch ZLS
about that one
yeah
Uhhhh
<https://anilist.co/anime/109856/LISTENERS/>
They've done Takt before, it wasn't good then either <:LuL:789259461470322728>
I rate Mappa very low, they tend to pump a lot of trash
Mappa ain't great
The next ep's when they switch studios
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
basically just want to see how much of a clusterfuck the next ep is
Takt is on a very short road to getting dropped for me
they are, but there's still a point there
if you're going to build walls try this
?
typically
if you want war you build up an army
A navy is what you build when you don't want war <a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
1066 is the reason the UK had the largest navy in the world for so long <:LuL:789259461470322728>
and even if he wanted his inefficient solution he could have used both
He found a convoluted and inefficient way to do something that nations in the real world have done far more efficiently?
But he's relying on them when he actually has a far more reliable defence <:LuL:789259461470322728>
That's why I called them WoMD
Yes
in the walls
Just one example
Think about this for a minute. Paradis is an island. Why does it need the flawed strategy implemented by the king again? Real life islands have held off invaders in perpetuity for centuries. There's already walls around an island, it's called the ocean. If an island nation has a large navy they're completely unconquerable. I don't see any way how titans would remotely change this, since they don't seem to be remotely functional at aquatic warfare. His solution requires him to be dumb and not consider at all the landmass that he exists on and results in him taking a worse course of action than if he'd have just done the obvious thing and built a fucking navy. You can also have both a navy and your last resort WoMD titans BS too.
I mean because the solutions they put in place for them (especially Paradise Island) are so stupid and ineffective it's actually hard to imagine someone would ever think them up. The only way I can think of to get there is to work backwards from a preexisting world.
The absolute biggest issue is that for the world to end up in the state it's in by the start of S1 basically every character in the backstory had to act as a stupidity maximiser
It's a problem that a lot of mysteries face, although not normally to this extent
and they're fucking dumb
The end of S3 and S4 are where those answers start coming in
The answers the writer gives to the questions they posed are less interesting than the questions themselves
I can explain why
IDK how much of that was really Mappa's fault though, feels like the writing quality fell off a cliff. I don't think they helped, but I think the writer had already completely ran out of steam.
P1 was already a dysfunctional mess <:LuL:789259461470322728>
No, it's already dead, it's just gonna keep getting worse from here
<:comf:789441906018222080>
Is good
You should take a look into Sakugan Chrono
Especially since it's basically established that killing even a single titan is basically a gargantuan effort, so if like 0.5% didn't run straight for Paradis everyone else would be fucked.
but also, AoT sets a precedent for titans not always behaving consistently, so there'd probably be issues even if there was something always attracting them towards Paradis, which there is.
*there kinda is but like, <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
This is just one point, there's quite a few where AoT really struggles under scrutiny. This is because the characters are meant to represent ideologies but the ideologies they represent aren't just bad, but oftentimes completely incoherent.
<a:ChrisShiftyEyes:744451987831128126>
You don't do much textual analysis do you
Making Paradis an island from a writing perspective was probably a mistake, but also kinda needed for the other nations to not also be overran by titans. I think the real issue is that the "nation under permanent siege" under the conditions the author had already created makes no damn sense once you start to analysis it.
and tried to write motivations based on that
is that the author started with a walled city
the actual answer to this
And like
Why add the additional step? He can surrender directly. Or he can try to build a more sustainable paradise to live in. The problem is that he tries to have it both ways
If he thinks them dying would improve the world (which is a dumbass idea anyway) he should just surrender
Again, contradictory goals
it's often an issue, not always
That's true
Yes
And if it is his goal then preserving it for as long as possible is also a logical goal which means that he should want to build it in a more sustainable way
that's the point
Even if that's his goal there's so many less stupid ways to go about it
*this is very often an issue with characters who explicitly have death as one of their goals, because self preservation is kinda one of the things that actually makes storytelling work.
He seems to have two contradictory goals, death and self preservation
Even better, just have your giant titans stand in the ocean and punch any boat that comes near
Characters should have a form of logic to their actions that makes sense. Having one character act illogically is OK, when a whole society does however.
because that's not a logical course of action for an entire society
Saying "it's a place to die" doesn't make it better
Japan also used economics to avoid invasions
His logic makes no sense "I want to be left alone and I'll threaten you with world destruction but if you don't guess I'll just die lol". Basic, logical protection against invasion goes a whole lot further. That's how you have nations like Japan, the UK and even Madagascar go millennia without invasion.
You'd do better walling off even a portion of the coast
I did it during uni break
It's only an average of 11 hours a day or something
My 5 day Gatari rewatch was simultaneously the most enjoyable and exausting thing I've ever done <:LuL:789259461470322728>
just to name a few
I still haven't started Nana, NHK ni Youkoso, Utena or Ore Monogatari yet
~~what if literally all of them are more interesting than JJK~~
üöÑ
Yeah, an hour's a long ass time when there's 300 anime on your PTW list and you're just going to watch a video on trains instead anyway
If Iski's anything like me then
I mean, I don't think there's much between it and average shounen. It's just the next average show that shonen fans jumped onto and hyped.
I generally don't like shounen
The ending was kinda poor enough to undermine the anime in a lot of ways
I'm in a similar space with doesn't stick the landing but that had a far bigger impact for me
<a:HomuDespair_MM:393858540709871628>
~~that's the best part~~
Yuyuyu's always nice though
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
wasn't expecting that
I'm a fan
New Yuuki Yuuna series is all over the place chronologically <a:NOTED:810618625903951933>
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
sounds like it Ash
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
does anything ever happen with Saya?
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Not as good as Miyafuji's relationship with her broom
She's so cute

<:comf:789441906018222080>
Irina in space is very good
yep
fking garbage anime <:LuL:789259461470322728>
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
There's always Tatsuya too
<a:loliDance:447728413722017804>
Eromanga is its own kind of masterpiece
More like reverse Gleipnir
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
guess I'll watch again next week
I have no idea what I just watched
welp
What the fuck even is this?
Yeah, watching ep 1 now
Fking Mappa
I also found the rhetoric about Japan's economy crashing after opening up to foreigners pretty yikes
The thing is, I honestly had less of an issue with the way Code Geass portrayed the same idea. Maybe because they chose to use the imagery of actual historical colonizers and a nation that's quite well known for its imperialism rather than Japan falling to the historically colonized (Australia isn't the issue here, while it would be absurd still it would at least have been acceptable)
I generally find hypernationalism to be quite problematic regardless of where it crops up.
This would be a white person writing that
So no
Japan was the oppressor
This isn't like a US author writing about slavery either, it's like a US author writing about PoC rising up and enslaving the white population. Maybe that comparison will help you see why this is problematic.
That doesn't make historical revisionism of war crimes OK
There's a thing called historical respect. It's incredibly distasteful to write your people as being oppressed by someone who you oppressed in the past in the way the anime does.
Also I really do take issue with a Japanese author writing themselves as oppressed by Ocieana after what Japan did to several Pacific island populations
Kinda weird to give that exposition in front of a literal wall sized TV in a perfect room though
Like, what is he, a Christian in the US?
It had some weird, creepy oppression fantasy too with the MC sitting in front of a giant TV and talking about how oppressed he was
Man, I really hated ep one's nationalistic BS
<:ARRYAYA:470759923823804417>
the only worthwhile new show they have is Sakugan <a:KEK:740160662721921104>
I meant three
wait did I say two of them rolled over
They normally do well at securing shit but they seem to have dropped the ball hard
yeah, CR only has 4 anime I even care about this season and two of them are just rollovers from last season
Netflix has Komi
<:momoWhyAreYouLikeThis:692154033485643797>
then they randomly decided to add a 2 week delay for literally no reason
They got so close this season
Netflix got some good anime but they still have no idea how to simulcast <:monaderpy:854593417585491988>
in CR's defence, this season kinda sucks
They got some good anime though
Fuck, hockey ED is good too
She just lost it in a drunk accident <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
also the impacts of war on society
It's a pure character study on loss and love
Pain
Didn't see this in the morning but if you still want input, Evergarden
but really well produced
Not the best song ever
Sakugan's OP has a really nice feel to it
basically the same shit
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Meiji Tokyo is 2019
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
anime that's been on my watch list for over 2 years

<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
or Jahy, there's legit 2 cute girl anime that day
There's cute girls there
Catch up on Mug
||letters from dead mum||
<a:crybaby_a:563053256922628116>
VE movie really just dropped that at the start
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
God bless Doga Kobo
no idea how fucky S3's going to make that though <:LuL:789259461470322728>
I really love Yuyuyu, probably going to do a chronological rewatch after this season's done
<a:YuzuGayPanic:827361568756858890>
I've seen everything but that one ep OVA
<:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
gonna be watching with friends tonight
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
This is how you do an end card
Good shit
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
Uhhh, this might actually be my favourite seasonal anime
I just realised one of the pride of orange characters is dessing every sentence <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFN5K-iAyV0
So uhhh, Kaguya S3 is a thing
Mob S3 <a:YuzuHype:827505533345857567>
He's sometimes pretty good
He's a mixed bag
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I tend not to take anything any of Trash Taste says seriously
Mother's Basement's OK sometimes too
There's one anituber I actually really like and that's Glass Reflection
<:ManOfCulture:609373441530920974>
imouto
Gigguk has the same taste in anime as me
<:monaderpy:854593417585491988>
Jane Eyre destroyed reading for pleasure for me
Books do nothing at all for me
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
~~I won't even consider isekai below an 8 on MAL~~
They give you a general direction, but they're also hella biased towards some genres
MAL ratings are great if you have an algorithm to apply to them. For me it's like, -2 on any shounen, -1 on ecchi, +1 on Josei, +1.5 on CGDCT and a couple of others
sorry, my mistake <:LuL:789259461470322728>
So it's another one about a demon lord picking up a slave elf girl then
Oh
Wait, is this Isekai Maou?
Yeah, all taste is subjective <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
~~Monogatari is technically harem~~
<:MonaOfCulture:776613770226171945>
I respect harem that embraces the trash it is
~~critiquing the problematic views of Rowling is more fun than critiquing Harry Potter honestly~~
another way to put it would be that they have the depth of a puddle
yeah
This is essentially what I'm talking about when I say Harry Potter and SAO really lack critical value
because the themes can be summed up in like, three sentences
It's really fucking hard
Try to write an essay on the themes of Harry Potter
There's a lot of difference in the overall critical worth of the works
because the two aren't actually that closely related
and it does carry critical value
It is very popular
OK, LotR is still less popular than a lot of Harry Potter/Avengers/Starwars type films which are critically vapid
Lord of the Rings (LotR)?
Popularity doesn't equate to quality. Pretty much nothing in SAO holds any critical value regardless of its popularity. As a comparison to film, a critic is always going to find more interest in a film like Citizen Kane than say, Harry Potter. The former isn't unpopular for sure, but it's not got the same hyper popularity. It's also just less vapid.
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
When SAO keeps doing the same shit that makes it worth shitting on
but like, he's not Gigguk who's just a barometer for being completely wrong about everything <:LuL:789259461470322728>
but also sometimes pretty bad
I can't think of where they are off the top of my head though
Fuck, there's actually examples of this in Bakemonogatari, doing very similar things with the way scenes are cut together
~~There isn't enough LSD in the world to make me imagine what Shaft draws~~
Extremely derivative works are probably the best example of where low quality stuff actually tends towards popularity
Ehhhh, hard disagree with that. There's no strong correlation between actual quality and popularity either way.
I still remember pissing off my teacher by doing a Marxist reading of that book in a practice test though. I did a fairly good text analysis but apparently ending my work with the paragraph "And the curtains were red!" was not acceptable
~~that book may have ended up in a fire~~ <:worry3:759269416407269436>
More like I never liked it that much anyway and my school made me trudge through 600 pages of shit and I was just done
It's just a self aware generic isekai
~~Konosuba isn't even a parody~~
like, try not making it shit <a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
It's going through a "we know it's shit and we're going to reference it being shit" phase
yeah, I'm just talking about isekai in general
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Shame that being aware what you're doing is derivative doesn't make it interesting
<a:DentalHygiene:567655922734989353>
It's good shit
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
As I said, fking Araragi
Uhh, I found an example of what this looks like in visual media but I'm just gonna CW it to be safe because fucking Araragi. It's at 5:28 ||talks about sexual harassment||
||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnTOO2uFj7U||
Love Ice
IDK, I liked the ep <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
||I have a slightly different point of view on this. It's fairly understandable to be angry about being fired for your life circumstances. People under extreme stress often don't have the most pro-social behaviours and losing your job and your family would certainly constitute that||
So is the chronological order going to be S2>S1>S4 ep 1-4>S3>the rest of S4
Yuuki Yuuna ||I guess we're at the start of the hero chapter now|| and also what the fuck is happening?
<:heh:789431887135113241>
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
I wonder if they're actually going in on the yuri this season
<:momoWhyAreYouLikeThis:692154033485643797>
Which is S4
There's only two times where deviating from release order is a good idea. Kizu second and Hana halfway through Second Season
I think I still have a shortcut to my Koyomimonogatari folder somewhere
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
I've watched in both orders
<:OMEGALUL:473565787399913483>
<@!171395487247630336> Want to try to wrap your head around it in that format
Also I missed a fucking Koyomimonogatari ep somewhere
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
Like what I just posted
Oh
Just a normal timeline.

The chronological order of the anime that's aired so far is
Movies>S8E1>S3>S1=S8E2>S8E3>S2=S8E4>S4P2>S4P1/3=S7P2>S8E5/6>S7P1>S8E7>S4P4>S8E8>S4P5>SE10>S6>S8E11/12>S9>S10>S5
He's talking about Gatari
I always think of them more as separate seasons since they're completely distinct
you knew what it meant, so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
It's easier just to refer to them as 2/3
I'm spoilering this for two reasons, number one the order of seasons in Monogatari is a light spoiler and number two Nekogatari Kuro's PV art
Want to see Monogatari's
What the hell even is that?
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Yes, the main pair is the white haired girl and black/grey haired guy at the front but the first season pretty much did everything short of stating the brown haired girl on the second row is gay
Chihayafuru 3 in 2019
But like, I will forgive all for Sora Yori
Yeah
Madhouse is super mixed bag now
<:02lul:414576440114151424>
I still feel like Madhouse produces more interesting anime than Mappa though
Hi Score Girl S2
DAL is a fucking meme at this point
It's not crazy uncommon for anime to change studios
And JC already work on a fast/cheap turnover rate for sequels anyway
Fuck man I always forget that Madhouse made an Iron Man anime
I was over Sony Boy after two eps
It was the last good anime they did though
I quite like it
Granbelm was interesting
Kinda the end result of capitalism on media <:02shrug:443257729646198784>
I heard the manga also just gave up
In their defence on that one
Railgun
Oh yeah
I think so but JC had a hand in it
They do a decent chunk of good shit amongst the trash
Hi Score Girl, Rail Gun, Aria, Blue Reflection (fight me), Wixxoss before it went to shit, Planet With, Amanchu and Urara
JC is way better than people give them credit for, but at the same time that still just makes them decent
CGDCT is the best type of anime
That was truly their peak
What do you think the odds of JC making an Urara Meirochou sequel are?
<:awwDuck:463096391452065792>
||Drunk|| Irina is super cute
<:KannaBird:305876452979769344>
And Cypher
No, I wanted the show name, thanks Aya
Can I just get a name <:momoWhyAreYouLikeThis:692154033485643797>
I'm interested
Which anime?
Nice costume
not like everyone here doesn't know <:LuL:789259461470322728>
there you go
but like, for most yuri, yes
I think they mostly fled Citrus after ||the wedding|| when it became an impossible stance
<:momoWhyAreYouLikeThis:692154033485643797>
Ikxi there are actually people who legit argue this shit
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
I guess your sister is technically your roommate
Have the ending too
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Just ignore literally every other page of the manga
~~clearly she's super straight~~ <:Kapp:789259331072819241>

She's Yuzu but straight
<:YuzuNoHope:827525270722183180>
actually looks good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ8GyiSJ1KU
This is one of the things I've wanted to see adapted for a while <:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
Budoukan's background work is so damn good
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
Weirdly enough it started with me posting something distinctly not yuri
OK, it took me a second to work out what the hell you were talking about
Tsuredure Children is so comfy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3au1TF-Yk4
Big spoilers for Yaga Kimi, but mine is easily this
it's rare I don't recognise one of these
What series is that
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
I wonder if anyone ever subbed the stage play

just uhhh
That's literally what it's about
girls kissing each other
Just thought about that, you'd probably like
Lily have you ever seen Sakura Trick?
Uhhh, only ecchi <:worry3:759269416407269436>
I haven't actually been watching that long

<:YuzuFailedSmug:827303707230076959>
Hey, Citrus was my introduction to anime
<:OMEGALUL:473565787399913483>
Just that sentence proves how much worse it can get


Age in anime is confusing
Yaga Kimi ||It would even be canon, cmon why not?||
<:zpleased_Yuu:858806331393310781>
I'll take one for Yaga Kimi
WA2 isn't the first thing that came to my head
I was thinking about yuri
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I've even seen that
Oh what?
That'd explain why I had no clue
<:momoWhyAreYouLikeThis:692154033485643797>
actually, when you put it that way it makes more sense
Don't get it
People are weird man. I just binge romance of all sexualities. Getting worked up over any kind is just <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
I just want some yuri sequels
I clearly have too much faith in humanity
Kinda assumed they might avoid linking childrens shows with gambling
there must always be pachinko
No anime this year, just pachinko
Every time I see Wataten I remember the shitposts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyITu13Wr4
JFC
yeah, it's a real ~~gay~~ good fig
Asia is a precious lewd cinnamon roll <:monablush:782177196264390716>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I like Asia too
When I hear RPG bloodsucker this isn't the first thing I think of, but yeah, I guess
but 16 ep blocks are a damn unicorn
They didn't need 20, they needed like 16 I think
The 13 eps they got was a little short
XV needed the Bakemonogatari treatment. 12 eps of aired anime then 3 OVA.
fking "to" introducing too much ambiguity into my sentences
This is still bad writing because it just makes the series less interesting when you write that plot point rather than making a good villain with some depth like they did for the two seasons prior and I'd also argue they did to a lesser extent with NR
And yeah, Garie is the least bad of the autoscorers because they actually gave her somewhat of a personality
Never forget Gary
especially GX
I think for me that's one of the reasons why GX and AXZ really suffer though, because their villains are just really bad
<:ElsaPat:637356110415659063>
Then again, same thing is true for NR, I only really like Elsa
~~I don't care for the others either, I just really like Cag~~

It's probably just Cag
Kinda wonder why AXZ isn't lower though
I agree
Oh look
The other seasons though, S1, G and XV actually bother to have themes that are worth exploring
GX didn't try, AXZ probably shouldn't have
Cloverworks did a nice job on the trailer at least
<:comf:789441906018222080>
It looks super cute
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
That PV was so good
The one I'm most looking forward to is probably Sono Bisque Doll
It really is
but still pretty cute girl
Looks less cute girl than the last one
I don't thing GX was really salvageable without a full rewrite personally, AXZ probably could have worked in the block, just needed better focus
<:Baka:573649152249036810>
It's good
https://anilist.co/anime/113428/Bishounen-Tanteidan/
Watch it
It can be both
This is peak anime dialogue
basically the essence of insanity
Bishounen Tanteidan too
couldn't be bothered to load up ep 2
just didn't interest me at all
IDK about Takt though
it's so unique
like
For me the clear best of the year is Odd Taxi
and it's not even close
The best romance was Fruits Basket
it was trash
no
I will go to the mat for a fucking walrus.
This year's had some amazing anime <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
~~watch Odd Taxi cowards~~
Spring this year was the best
good shit
don't knock Aquatope
~~I have like 10~~
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
I prefer Irony
Ehhh
<a:loliDance:447728413722017804>
It's like a 3 to Eromanga's 10
than Eromanga
far less trash
Oh
It's just trash
no <:LuL:789259461470322728>
and that's something
it exists though
or good
I never claimed it was substantial
yep
It's the only one that exists in anime form so far as I know
100% sure
I actually really like To-Lie-Angle's ED though
really something
but the ED is just
It's the yuri harem anime
name a better pair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFrwvyHVHe8
Shorts and having weird ill fitting theme songs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_ZDVVI2yk
This is lowkey a jam
they do drugs
drugs
<:ChrisHibikiHug:630262562361049121>
Sometimes annoying, always cute
<:kokowant:870169015639760936>
~~she can kidnap me~~
Took me a minute to recognise
Oh, is that Mirika
at all
that doesn't change
yeah
Pretty much every character in the Index anime is abysmal
TBH I don't just think Touma's a bad character
Don't even bother with Index
They're still wrong, just watch Railgun
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
Hey, this is one of the endings of the VN
He should have just ended up with his sister <:Amber_SaveMe:795762965835546664>
<:kirinoComfy:476045251921051648>
Kirino is best imouto
<:kirinoSmug:823590403898998834>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1IhOlzyIWw
Also reminder that this is still one of the best EDs ever
90's anime are only good when they include Fly Me to the Moon
not really zoomer
Mate, I referenced Oreimo just before
https://tenor.com/view/kirino-oreimo-gif-7514105
yep
I'm evaluating it as an anime
I'm not evaluating it as an adaptation
It's not like Index where you're just being bombarded with BS
That doesn't really matter, if nothing's happening the anime is slow
so it's slow
it feels like nothing's happening
I don't actually give a fuck if they're skipping literally everything
see, here's the thing
They could have cut most of the last 3 eps and lost nothing
it's been so slow and boring and nothing's happened
so far I've had the opposite issue with Muv-Luv
How is that even possible?
I can't believe they managed to make magical queen Elizabeth boring
like at all
I literally don't remember any of the girls
I'll be honest
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
why are these so funny

I need OPs and EDs to win AMQ
It's just foreshadowing <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Absolute fucking goldmine
Imoimo
I watched this work of art
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
just catching back up with a ton of stuff RN
Selection Project is pretty comf
it was
I watched ImoImo because I figured it would be hilarious
I've made that known
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
I like shitty imouto anime?
Imouto is in the Japanese title twice
It's absolute garbage
https://anilist.co/anime/100382/Ore-ga-Suki-nano-wa-Imouto-dakedo-Imouto-ja-Nai/
do you really need to ask?
Please
Lily
<:shamiBread:710837871489318943>
Fuck man, just recognised a Japanese word due to shitty Machikado memes
<a:panic:589215632772431893>
Man, I wonder if Mob S3's OP will be as good as the first two or just bomb
mad stylised OP
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI_cLtW3PnA
Look at this quality
I didn't even go in expecting nothing, I just didn't even know what the hell it was
Odd Taxi was the big surprise for me
This season's eps are just going wherever the hell they feel like, aren't they?
<:astroSlain:660947775172902924>
Guess I was wrong about where the next YuYuYu ep was going chronologically
Also, the anime is really good too
I don't really like manga
https://anilist.co/anime/120646/Senpai-ga-Uzai-Kouhai-no-Hanashi/
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXtfzKaKr4I
Can't believe this is actually one of my favourites this season
Ep 4 was fucking hard to get through
Very popular manga
https://twitter.com/SugoiLITE/status/1454394446523482112
I'd be more surprised by no new SAO than a new SAO
I'd argue the last year has been highly mixed for CloverWorks, they also released Horimiya and Shadows House both of which are very good. It's easy to over focus on failure though.
at all
like
I don't see how that relates to the argument that original work is the most important
Anyway, even for studios that are generally agreed to be good adaptations often make up some of their most important works. Talking about KyoAni without mentioning Clannad, Haruhi or K-On or Shaft without Monogatari wouldn't make sense. Being adaptations doesn't make these series any less core to the identity of the studios.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Some studios are fine when they do adaptations and not so good at original works
also some show about a girl in a bunny costume no-one's ever heard of
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
They made one of the most underrated CGDCT anime ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_Q4QD1Qn_c
I don't think Cloverworks are a bad studio really
I don't think it's that people couldn't see issues near the start, more that there was enough good near the start that if they'd have actually built on that rather than doing whatever the hell they did with the ending it would have been a good series with problems rather than and OK series with a trashfire ending.
<:ababa:789441747678920735>
Also obligatory Comic Girls
yeah, CGDCT and romance
it's like, my bread and butter
I could honestly put together a whole list of these though
not my definition of handling it well <:LuL:789259461470322728>
~~I'm super biased towards anything that handles mythology well though~~
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha.
A really good one
Ohhhh
It's getting one
Is super comfy
Tsuki ga Kirei too
<:Pengu:230144952175296512>
Sora Yori is fantastic
Second that one
Might give it a watch when I can be bothered
compared to most of the crap that's getting pumped out RN
If I'm honest HGS is pretty interesting

civ is like, the game I just boot when I have nothing else to do
5 years
I think that's how long civ 6 has been out for
to be fair that's over like 6? years
<:SakutUhhh:510697805640237056>
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
literally just about to start this
Most of them are airing
||https://anilist.co/user/Lankpants/animelist||
not super safe for work
gonna spoiler tag this because of my PFP
It's anilist
<:heh:789431887135113241>

it's really good
I would advise actually watching Hibike at some point
P1 specifically I actually despise
But yeah, personally I had a lot of issues with S1, it was far from the most enjoyable anime I've ever watched
https://tenor.com/view/karen-araragi-monogatari-monogatari-series-dekkosun-fight-gif-14605647
and it kinda cast a shadow over it
Part of this is that I watched Jojo's right around the same time as one of my favourite series ever
Probably will eventually
I've just never got around to it
I actually have it DLed to watch
That's how I felt about it too
ye
It was great until it got bogged down on dumb shit for 8 eps
<a:KanbaHappyAnim:556265280268009482>
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
also, it keeping a record of all the anime on your hard drive so you can just open one without going through your scuffed folder layout
ye
usually not worth it
can be a super huge pain to fix when that happens
although it does sometimes struggle to recognise a file and that sucks
It's super easy to set up though <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
yeah, Taiga's a godsend when you watch 20 seasonals
I've personally been using it for years, I started during that months long period where MAL was 100% dead and never looked back. I just find Anilist far better to use.
all the more reason not to use them
Oh, yikes
just on the site
not by email though
it does
yes
<a:YuzuGayPanic:827361568756858890>
God I hate the way Netflix is still handling their series
Time to catch up with Blue Period again
<:ShirabePlease:724034356192215081>
S3 for global launch
didn't
or like
Was not a fan of the way Tonikawa handled characterisation
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
same
Wait, is this Sakugan ep just a scifi Zelda dungeon <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Don't know if they'd go outside of Japan though
This was Phar Lap's record
Literally won every race then was poisoned so it wouldn't just keep winning
<:heh:789431887135113241>
Phar Lap when?
feels like they're the two most liked characters generally too, might be better just to keep them around in the background
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
or Twin Turbo
~~focus on Golden Ship~~
<:fuck:789441962554032138>
YuYuYu latest ep. I think I've seen this backstory before <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Yeah, alongside a plea to please not lewd the damn horses <:OMEGALUL:473565787399913483>
<:Baka:573649152249036810>
||Wear a swimsuit that just covers the damn scar, they wouldn't even be hard to find||
to this entire problem
I have a solution
OK, so that ep of Selection Project
both really though
Ads
Another anime I should really get around to
Oh
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
good film
I guess that makes sense
and said "cat"?
Who pointed at a seagull
So question
The 3rd/4th season (depends how you count) is airing right now
Actually a really good series
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Fuck, ending of this week's Blue Period was a gut punch
Guess that's going right up the top of my PTW
Nice
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
I expect an XDU colab rerun for this
Plan C
<:YuzuNoHope:827525270722183180>
but just whatever
Not bad by any means
Personally S1 just felt like a kinda whatever CGDCT anime
They are one of the few studios on my fave studios list
both are very good
<:MatsuriGiggle:827303704239669288>

<:Comfyu:906964799785689118>
and that one's nice
The chapter right after is the ring chapter
it starts progressing legit right after the anime ends
The manga does
Needs more drama

<a:nod:864368323672276992>
preferably something gay
We just need something to actually happen with Kukuru now
This ep felt decently important
yeah
<:Comfyu:906964799785689118>
Really good ep though
Many reasons
https://twitter.com/AniTrendz/status/1458633284884185089
Fucking why?
There's been an elbow
I love this trash
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
Oh right, I almost forgot Pride of Orange is an idol anime
no
That's mahou shoujo, not shoujo
Ore Monogatari?
Also, Sakugan's still fun at least
Legit, go look up Listeners, it's actually the same anime by the same studio
~~Listeners~~
I could already see where it was going
That's why I dropped it after ep1
It's very good though
Heike is again, actually from last season
<:YuzuHi:827361636963975209>
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
Aquatope is last season for me
SoL my beloved
I'd probably say Irina, Blue Period and Senpai
Blue Period is super good
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
Ice Hockey Idols
It's a really nice anime
?
https://anilist.co/anime/120646/Senpai-ga-Uzai-Kouhai-no-Hanashi/
not shoujo but
Pretty sure it's seinen
It's not
ahhh, that'd be why I don't like it then
Even if they try to redeem him he's still a dick with some terrible teaching methods
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I just want Kukuru to be happy
<:02lul:414576440114151424>
This one got me going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k1IWguG6w8
It's still a good anime
can't win them all
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
The actual art's been on point though
Communist space vampire
We almost did it but we stumbled and set ourselves on fire at the finish line
I feel like the last one I really loved was Gridman
It's very much not what I'm looking for
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
recently mostly the latter though
Mecha has the highest highs and lowest lows
seriously, they'd be a better studio if they knew how to keep themselves grounded
The second half is one of the better examples of Gainax/Trigger scope overload though
https://anilist.co/anime/2001/Tengen-Toppa-Gurren-Lagann/
That's about the most "dumb fun" mecha show ever
I'm guessing you've seen Gurren Lagann right Lily?
You might enjoy Granbelm I guess
I guess Granbelm was pretty cool
<:Blushyu:899069716356825128>
hell yeah it is
S1 has more characterisation, motivation and intrigue than the last 3 seasons of gear too <:LuL:789259461470322728>
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Takt was obviously going to be a mess from the point where Mappa committed to Listeners again
But it's good and would recommend
I've only watched it subbed
Some of them have some really nice colour pallets that are super interesting
If I'm 100% honest I'd mostly be watching to get to the later seasons
The artstyle on that OP is amazing
Man, I might actually watch Jojo part 3 at some point
honestly, Akane thighs too
Pretty much the exact opposite of Dynazenon which started strong then bombed off a cliff
I found ep 1 to be fairly weak, but the series got stronger
<a:NOTED:810618625903951933>
Ok, so not Bloom
<:PadorYuu:783078743115431936>
Yagate Kimi ni Naru
to me that's fundamentally very similar and still completely disinteresting
meh
Is there really a substantive difference between the three?
Next season is pretty <a:oof:509138600571699200>
Excuse me for making an assumption when I see that damn word
>reborn
Another isekai
<a:SleepyMario:641109780974534677>
Is it gay?
<a:shamiEEEEEE:708734921077686344>
<:BayonetHug:745998190339424337>
Hope you found something Yumi
It feels like such a you anime
I really don't understand how you haven't watched it Ash <:02lul:414576440114151424>
https://tenor.com/view/anime-ochikobore-fruit-tart-gif-20683678
Or Ochikobori Fruit Tart which is like, almost as gay as Sakura Trick but not quite as explicit
Amanchu comes to mind
There's some solid less explicit ones though
It's basically Kase/Sakura Trick/AdaShima
what could go wrong?
If they make one they should just steal from nintendo and have you swing your phone like a golf club

I'm kinda looking forward to this too

but <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
I'll still watch it

oh

Golf
There's actually a fair few CGDCTs anime next season that seem interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2kTPtVWORs
Not the one about a Sailor Uniform?
Might watch that honestly
The goonsquad in Dynazenon lack coherent motivation
yes, but the show eventually talks about her motivations, why she's doing what she's doing
The issue is that the "monster of the week" squad just randomly deciding now's the time to kill is inherently far less interesting than a single antagonist who's acting as they are due to thought out motivations
Those are mutually exclusive
You can't both say they felt like real people and have no reason for half the shit they do
Yeah, but then they do some random garbage that makes no sense because the plot demands it
The antags of Dynazenon were just terrible honestly
I mean, Gridman had a far more interesting antagonist
My PoV is pretty much the exact opposite. Gridman stays more focused on 3-4 characters and develops them a whole lot more while Dynazenon ends up with a whole cast that's completely flat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7m8rALmMJY
I wanted to watch Nana at some point anyway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj81ny_znXE
Oh, this is cool
Yes, I don't like Dyna at all
I actually think the exact opposite
I never said Gridman falls off in the second half
I super appreciate the use of classic songs
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
Jojo's not my favourite series ever, but holy hell, the EDs are so good
I still hate that they went with Syber to make the acronym work
I still really like Lucchini just because she brings chaos
I'm too far gone
My brain just assumed you were talking about Strike Witches when you said Shirly
The ending of Gridman is one of my favourite endings to any anime
in this case
They're not
||Akane wants to wake up and face the world, I want to fall asleep and not, can we just like, trade places||

I remember when me and 5 other people were there for Weathering with You
It's SAO though
No clue
I'm sorry
but it was something
something I wish it wasn't
S3 was something
I really do enjoy the artstyle though
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
I liked P3 a lot more than P2
Definitely enjoyed it a ton more than S1
OK, done the first half of Jojo part 3, that was surprisingly enjoyable

I thought Durarara was better <:02shrug:443257729646198784>
<:MayoiOK:325758983413563412>
Durarara
Ohhh, I remembered the other rec I was going to make
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
don't know why that made me think of that

Kinda surprised that Taiga's as smart as it is sometimes
In Blue Period's case it's named after Picasso's blue period
Last two eps have been very much beat for beat though
I really wish this season of Yuuki Yuuna didn't feel the need to rehash the end of Yuusha no Shou
<a:miowink:424741626259308556>
But it is entertaining
And realistically the last two eps have just been a complete waste
Because they did it in like 3 eps
S3 is kinda all over the place. It's adapted what happened between S1 and hero chapter, a parallal story to hero chapter, NoWaYu and really confusingly just the last couple of was of hero chapter again.
Shaft air dates are more a concept than an actual thing
Want to get back to Blue Spring Ride and start Ancient Magus Bride
Na, not right now
Want to catch up with seasonals and watch a couple of romances first
yeah
Not sure when I'll start Diamond is Unbreakable though, think there's a few other things I'll watch first
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
Finished Stardust Crusaders, fairly enjoyable
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
I still want another season though
Don't think it's AotY though
Kano mo Kano was fun
<a:Aqua_cry:586137218129723393>
Fruits Basket
Oh yeah, sequels can count too
No idea if anyone will vote for it
I mean, AotY is Odd Taxi
It's worth watching
Yes

Oh, that's nice
How is that even possible?
Index is related, but it's completely disinteresting anyway
Honestly, I think you can totally watch railgun without index and be fine
*watching only railgun helps to preserve one's sanity

||Kukoro walks into the shower with Mikoto though||
doesn't actually matter to the reader
or 10 years
because whether those events are in one day
It doesn't matter
Only if you ignore what I literally just typed <:LuL:789259461470322728>
by the way, to avoid confusion event density refers to the number of events in a novel or series, not timeframe
so what's actually the difference?
The only ways you can tell there's a ~2 month time skip are environmental ques or reading when an event happened on a timeline
Not really? Monogatari is written as if every event is both independent and directly after the last regardless of timeframe. There's only a couple of exceptions to this in Hanamono and two of the later books.
It doesn't matter if 1 day or 2 months has passed
because time in media is arbitrary, it is what the author says it is
yes, but a story like Monogatari, which happens over 2 years, or Jojo's, which happens over hundreds actually have approximately the same density
Actual timeframe in media is arbitrary
What matters is event density
It doesn't matter?
6 months in Index~2 years in Monogatari. There's very little functional difference.
Time in media is an arbitrary quantity with very few exceptions
What's that have to do with anything?
A lot of them can be distilled down to just their consequence
If you're going to do those sort of short, 5 or less ep arcs you need to be very, very careful about the way they relate in the overarching story and do things to immediately make your characters interesting. Index seems to do the exact opposite, throwing in arcs which are really random and loosely related to the main plot and having just some of the worst characterisation I've ever seen.
Index felt to me like a string of random events, very few of which were actually interesting packed with characters who were equally uninteresting. Railgun worked far better due to the fact that it spends long enough on each arc to actually flesh it out and has a cast with actual personality
And the rational is that Railgun still works well enough without Index, but it's of significantly higher quality so you don't have to subject yourself to the drag of watching through Index
I know a fair few people who did and still enjoyed Railgun
I think you can quite easily skip and not miss that much
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
<:nadeGun:543013078200090624>
<:NadeCube:774101036586631168>
*I'm also assuming linearized Monogatari here, non-linear shows do weird things to time
That's the basis of this argument
The point is it doesn't really matter if 1 day or 50 years have passed between two eps. Jojo's flows continuously from Phantom Blood to Battle Tendency to Stardust, yes there's time skips but that actually doesn't fundamentally change the anime because time that isn't shown in airing doesn't actually exist from a media point of view.

Jojo's is an extreme example. But when you look at Monogatari or Durarara, as examples, which leave fairly significant time gaps it becomes very obvious how arbitrary time can actually be to media. A time skip of a few days literally doesn't exist unless the author explicitly calls attention to it.
and you argued as if I didn't
several times
I said literally that
I'm really not
<a:BanaNice:501549702383140865>
It actually gets far better
Starlight is very good

Try Tsuki ga Kirei if you haven't
Valk Drive isn't really harem, but it's definitely got the big tits and yuri and big tits down
it's pretty interesting though
Oh yeah, the show's inconsistent AF
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
It has a good ED too, but legit no-one's seen this and I can't find the anime cut

*symphogear is Shounen
kinda disjointed
the rest was OK I guess
yeah, ep 1 was really good
I just, why?
did they really just sequel bait this <:momoWhyAreYouLikeThis:692154033485643797>
what the fuck is this "ending"
How did Sakugan drop quality so much after the first ep <:LuL:789259461470322728>

Wait, doesn't that increase the odds in anime
gonna go do a rewatch and watch the movie soon I think
This looks nice
The police anime was kinda OK in an "I hate my job and want to die" kind of way
so far this season hasn't had anything super worth watching
IDK, Leadale wasn't remotely interesting to me
https://tenor.com/view/jigglypuff-clefairy-fight-slap-pokemon-gif-4979276
I'll watch it in the morning
~~Tybalt was the actual hero of the story~~
Romeo and Juliet is the worst Shakespeare anyways
yes, the Shakespeare play

||Yuri Hamlet|| was not expected, but I'm down for it
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
the CGDCT anime this season seem fairly good so far though
man, Shakespeare in other languages just wouldn't be the same though
~~And not Romeo and Juliet~~
Instant respect for use of Shakespeare
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Because it's a CGDCT anime and they're all pretty much the same
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
Hmmm, not so sure that just introducing a giant cast like this in ep 1 is the best way to do this
I'll take a 24 ep CGDCT anime though
https://twitter.com/cue_anime/status/1479437743168135172
Unexpected
you enjoyed it <:kirinoPout:499471452073099267>
The season needed them to be good, because it's quite weak in a lot of areas.
Yep, really happy with that
We're eatting good on cute girl anime this season
Even if I'm never gonna remember the characters names
I really liked the first ep. Seems like it's going to be fun
Ash did you watch Cue?
It is but the OP is great
I kinda think the ending to Starlight would have been better received if they could have just aired the last two eps together, I remember it not really working that well while airing but it definitely does when they're back to back
Really looking forward to the movie now
or maybe my tastes just shifted to be a lot more favourable to it
Feel pretty comfortable saying Revue Starlight is far better than I remember
God, the giraffe ||breaking the 4th wall in the final ep|| still gives me shivers
<:kokoOGpray:873438598182076438>
Man, I really hope Cloverworks can keep up quality this season
just standard anime stuff honestly
The most detail I've seen put into animated feet since Miru Tights
gonna go out on a limb and say the mangaka had a fetish <:LuL:789259461470322728>
This still was just <:MayoiOK:325758983413563412>
Sono Bisque Doll and Akebi-chan no Sailor Fuku
I kinda hate it, not gonna lie
does anyone disagree with that?
Shakespeare anime wasn't great, still gonna watch it though
Watch it <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
It's kinda amazing
For context ||at the start of one ep in the later half of the anime one of the characters just announces he's god and goes on a 10 minute monologue about creation||
<:heh:789431887135113241>
It's an anime
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
Man, the fact that I actually kinda need to spoil that
||Kyousogiga||
I have no issue with old character designs
not to say there aren't some that I really like, but generally I much prefer more modern styles
Personally though I don't have much of a fondness for older anime in terms of looks
~~the other thing is that Mappa's doing AoT way faster than the series has any right to be~~
I don't think they're particularly representative of modern anime though
on any level
I really don't like what Mappa does in general
never really bothered me
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
I tend to actually like slower pacing, I have no issue with the series spending time on things that aren't core to the plot at all
<:GanyuwuMebriele:801218239862407218>
There was never a Hanabi tag here
<:kokoOGpray:873438598182076438>
and surely
but Key was so good at one point
I'm like, 15 years in the past at this point
also yes Millhi I will watch on account of it being Key
~~and nothing bad ever happened to her~~
<:makotoNom:504247008928858114>
Makoto will always be my favourite ||fox|| girl
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
Kanon 2002 aside, IDK I really like it

<:uguu:616501273520373760>
I think we should go back to anime characters with a 1:2 eye:face ratio honestly
I just tend not to enjoy most older artstyles as a whole
This character give anyone else Gun Saber feels?
https://animethemes.moe/video/KoroshiAi-OP1.webm
Holy hell, really nice OP
yeah, it's just trash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwbHVNLPM4g

at all
I'm not a fan of that OP
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Lost it at "she can make faces like this too"
They played themselves
No, they really didn't
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
"I was reincarnated in another world as a tree" was meant to be a joke about how formulaic isekai is, I swear
I really like Akebi Chan just having really high detail still for scenes that don't really need them because they can (not really a spoiler but just to be safe)
<a:stickbug:743220767415861298>
<:KokoDevil:874960932634243072>

<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Super tilted by Aquatope not even getting a mention
over and over
honestly though, they just picked the same 5 or so anime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbX_pQkrtLM
This is better than any of the OPs they selected
At least Odd Taxi's getting respect
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
are they just self aware about the fact they don't know what a protagonist or antagonist is at this point?
and their best antagonist vote includes Eren Yeager
Wait, Crunchy Roll's best protagonist vote includes Eren Yeager
You should definitely check out Sono Bisque Doll, it's fantastic
Only having 10 anime this season is weird AF
yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy7IpTpicCE
Also S2 of this, which while not a yuri anime is uhhhh

||Nothing happens||
~~time to binge~~
Matsuri exists solely to troll the audience at this point <:LuL:789259461470322728> (Citrus+ spoilers)
Na, it's set before
Also Saburouta is a gigantic troll, been baiting for 65 chapters <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Major Citrus endgame spoilers that literally everyone knows about
Not in the ring chapter, but yes
and it's probably the best of Citrus
It's the chapter straight after the anime
<a:YuzuGayPanic:827361568756858890>
Give me the ring chapter
I want Citrus S2
Very satisfying scene
Watching her just ||casually 6v1|| in the movie was pretty great though
But it was still pretty surprising
There were hints about it and most people thought there was something off about her
Personally though Banana basically stole the whole show with Revue Starlight, like her arc was just wild as hell. I was watching as it aired though so no one quite knew what was going on with her and the twist was just amazing.
The movie gives a much, much nicer ending than the show
<a:BanaNice:501549702383140865>
Now watch the movie
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Akebi Chan's doing the foot thing again
Like, the biggest issue with the jelly doughnuts line is that it's just confusing
The thing is, I didn't know what they were, but I knew they weren't doughnuts. I think it would have been better just to call them what they were honestly
~~it's 3am and I can't sleep help~~
Yep, I think so
<:kokoconfuzz:921059858365693994>

Not in that way <:Baka:573649152249036810>
Because he wants her to eat meat
It is true though, every time I get my hopes up for a modern mecha show it's just mediocre at best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFFeYLmEARw
I feel like this scene best describes what Monogatari is
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Modern mecha shows keep sucking
I don't hate mecha
if I'm honest Bisque Doll is shaping up to be one of the best ecchi series I've seen. It's not going to dethrone the wall of Gatari at the top, but it is good
but like, that's a lot of changes
if it was just under I would
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Sakugan and Muv Luv did some work on Mecha
Oh hey, ecchi isn't my bottom rated anymore
clearly needs to be 0.4 higher
I've seen a few
<:MonaOfCulture:776613770226171945>
Strongly recommend Akebi Chan if you enjoy feet
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I'm watching like 5 this season
<a:kokosips:887033279683899392>

<:Blushyu:899069716356825128>
TIL Anilist has a feet tag
~~I don't think anythings topping Durarara or Noragami any time soon though~~
Sayonara Bystander is one of my favourite OPs just in general
Slow Start

I have entire anime of moeblob incarnate

<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
https://tenor.com/view/oreimo-gif-7397612
Also, Oreimo is peak culture
IDK, I just really enjoyed it
Also is it weird that I like Kanon more than Clannad?
<:kirinoComfy:476045251921051648>

ye, it was very cute
Blushing gyarus are the best <a:YuzuBlush1:827360787260899344>
It doesn't matter who's making a lot of money, as long as someone is it will be done
It's because it makes a lot of money
but yeah, 1:1 adaptations tend not to be a good idea since different media has different requirements, what works well in one won't in another
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
Monogatari turning falling down a flight of stairs into whatever the fuck this is
Can it actually be without Bakarina though?
~~have you hate watched Ex-Arm yet~~
You call it tax evasion, I call it a surprise subsidy
Still pretty funny though
It's not quite the exact same
<:OMEGALUL:789275945885761567>
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Is this the sort of anime that would use "Superior Nippon Steel" unironically?
it's not even bad enough to hate
Danmachi is the most boring and generic thing I've ever seen and I don't understand why it's popular
One day Japanese animation studios will learn to count to 3
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
Or I just really like New Game
Like 100 or so
Plastic Memories is fantastic, but it's so far away from what Doga Kobo does normally
it's crazy good
New Game is one of the kings of CGDCTs honestly
like, Comic Girls and New Game exist
The biggest issue with BlendS is that it's just worse than most other anime in its niche
Yes
Snoopdog is more memorable than BlendS
||Why the hell are you here teacher?||
Is like the hardest meh anime I've ever seen
Danmachi
<:kirinoPout:499471452073099267>
I mean, it's not like genres definitions are set in stone, comedy's definition has changed like 3 times throughout history
Argue that a more correct definition of an inclusive genre rather than an exclusive one should be used as I'm doing now?
yes
The point I'm making isn't that isekai as a subgenre of fantasy is a bad thing, it's that a subgenre should define more of a style than an event. Genres aren't defined by events
it's one that actually makes sense though
Supernatural is a subgenre of fantasy
literally everyone
Everyone does
I just chose the first very clear "fantasy but not remotely close to isekai" anime that came to mind.
Is it though? Danmachi share far more in common with isekai than something like Durarara does
but the other side of that is that Danmachi is also nearly identical to any generic isekai
yes, that's true
That's literally not an important way of defining a genre at all. Imagine if we came up with a genre for anime that involved travel to an airport. You'd get a random mix of crap with no relation to each other that doesn't actually form a coherent genre, which is pretty much the issue with isekai and why it's not a remotely useful genre.
If you want isekai to be a remotely useful label that describes the tropes and feel of the show it's being applied to then you need to include Danmachi. If you don't it's a completely pointless word IMO
Then isekai isn't a useful thing to talk about nor a genre at all if it's defined like that
yes, but it has literally everything else. If world hopping is the only thing that defines isekai then it's actually a setting, not a genre
Genres aren't really defined by one thing happening, they're defined by a set of tropes that are common to the genre as a whole.
to the point I've argued it really may as well be considered part of the genre
It pretty much feels like an isekai though
Next season looks nice
or I guess you've made it revolve so much around one idea that there's not actually any commonality left in the shows it describes and therefore you don't even really have a genre
If you include Kyousogiga as an isekai you've made the genre so wide as to mean nothing <:LuL:789259461470322728>
it just doesn't even care
and it's not even like it's a rejection of isekai tropes
Also, just to highlight why Kyousogiga is problematic for the idea of isekai as a cohesive genre, it's an urban fantasy anime that just so happens to have world hopping. It shares most of its tropes with anime like Monogatari, Durarara and Beyond the Boundary and even the world hopping aspects of the anime end up being submissive to the character meta powers typical of those shows in the end. If any show with world hopping is an isekai then it is by technicality, but it's also very, very clearly not in line with isekai in any other way.
"My mid 2000's battle highschool was transported to another world and now I'm a refrigerator"
The things that I consider fringe are things like Kyousogiga and Zokuowarimonogatari which both only have the "in another world" thing and none of the other tropes of isekai
Bookworm actually meets enough tropes of isekai that I don't even really consider it fringe
It's not even like it's the widest genre, comedy is
which is the difference between it and isekai, which by the common definition is exclusive
Fantasy is a wide genre, but it's inclusive
It is always interesting to look at things at the fringe though. Like Kyosogiga, technically has world hopping but I don't think I can remotely consider it an isekai because it lacks any of the other tropes of the genre
Yeah, that's not remotely what I was arguing. There's a select few anime I consider isekai that I actually like
best girl

I'm just here for Origami at this point
~~it's 3HZ~~
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I love that season 2 of Rikei Koi is r=1-sin(theta)
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
I should get around to S1
also Bakarina
<a:kokosips:887033279683899392>
Monogatari and Bunny Girl Senpai are harems and they're good
It gets really good as it goes on
Little sister is best harem member <:kirinoComfy:476045251921051648>
||He kinda did, I respect regicide though||
That one's easy to rec for
You should check out Shinsekai Yori
I'd recommend something but I have shit taste <:heh:789431887135113241>
<:NadekoFries:591296872094892035>
Fruits Basket
<a:tsukihiXD:567681705133998085>
How else would they get in the bath with their brother?
One of them even does it while dead
Monogatari does have a lot of times where characters narrate an arc as a flashback
which is fucking amazing
it also flashes back to one scene from three different perspectives with three different biases
yeah, it is
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
The first season is a flashback
It's Rakugo Shinjuu
nope
I just remembered that one of my favourite anime literally has an entire season of flashback <:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
Just do that one Simpsons ep where it goes like 5 flashbacks deep
That's one of the worst things about it, the politics are just uber fucked
Yeah
The best way to do a multi ep long battle is not to
Also, to be fair to them I can understand holding up Demon Slayer mostly based on animation more than AoT based on storytelling <:LuL:789259461470322728>
The AoT thing feels more like a legit take and a super common one at that
Maybe because it's so insanely far off base that it doesn't even feel like a real thing to me
IDK, Demonslayer being held up like that is just funny to me
It's just dark and edgy and people confuse that with depth
It's pretty on-par with something like Dr. Stone <:02shrug:443257729646198784>
It's like, above average for a shounen. I don't even think it's the best shounen I've seen though and they have atypically weak story telling
but yeah, if I have to listed to more shounen fans telling me how deep the show is I'm just going to uninstall discord <:SagiriBleh:341060865547829248>
It just seems to lose a lot of sanity during the last arc
Trust me, they had no shortage of that <:heh:789431887135113241>
I'm pretty sure there was just a shortage of... whatever the fuck's in coke in Nazi Germany
I've found Final Season in general to just be not at all interesting, like it's just a complete whiplash season
I actually feel like AoT completely shat the bed a season ago
shame
I kinda lowkey wish Eren won best antag and best protag just to show what a farce the awards are
Oh hey, the Crunchyroll awards are out again
<:Comfyu:906964799785689118>
this season isn't great, but the CGDCTs anime is fantastic
Fuck I'm actually really enjoying Cue now that I'm caught up
Yep, they tend to be completely vapid criticism that amounts to "I don't like the politics of this piece"
I'm concerned about the number of people who call anything with a female lead or LGBT representation in general woke <:kirusigh:913200015793590302>
Exactly what I expected though
The entire awards were a joke <:02shrug:443257729646198784>
~~don't fuck it up~~
Cloverworks is doing well this season
actually good
you know
but
kinda like MHA
Pretty enjoyable so far
3 eps into Tiger and Bunny
Does Shamiko count as Mahoushoujo
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
Blue Reflection Ray was to promote a PC game
"what anime do you like this season"
"Literally just the CGDCTs, all of them, nothing else"
<:eulafeet:852487349921513482>
because Slow Loop is fairly alright, I still don't love it though
actually 4 now I look at it
ahhh
Akebi Chan and Sono Bisque Doll
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
as in it's one of the only 3 I think are any good
Probably a top 3 anime this season for me
I haven't actually had the time to watch yet
~~also we can still make the eyes bigger~~
Probably because I'm used to even more radical art style shifts than this
I get them, it just really doesn't bother me
It works well for me but I'm also hundreds of hours deep into SoL hell, so I may be biased
With hair down
but yeah, she looks better with her hair down
I really like the artstle
they probably don't need to put this level of detail into stills, but they always look great <a:Happy:448102279002718208>
Honestly, the biggest standout to me is just how pretty the show is
We're nearly at Eupho levels of bait here
This week's Akebi Chan was really nice <a:YuzuGayPanic:827361568756858890>
<a:hyperJumpingSpinning:638512050804621331>
Lots of cute Marin this week
Good series though
Girl may have a bit of a complex <:yui_worry:747192978870763692>
<a:karenEhh:567668661716910080>
Carry on then
Oh, I think that's the point
https://twitter.com/AIR_News01/status/1492885470635708417

I have no idea what this is but it sounds like what happens when you half commit to saying hell
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Wow, it's actually crazy how many of Tiger and Bunny's story beats MHA just directly ripped and did worse
Yeah, I adore Hidamari Sketch and it's surreal fever dream stuff
*it is
and I love it
this has to be the most "why" series
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNAaUZq-NmU
At least there's Shaft Witches this year
no
<:NotLikeYuzu:827360021062352896>
also, dear god anyone other than Mappa
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I don't think Monogatari would feel right made by anyone else
anyone <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
~~hurry up and start adapting off season~~
very nice though
Extras <:DansGame:474639366824919041>

<a:OrigamiLurking:669074941810835466>
<:OrigamiDisgust:669074941597057025>
It'd be like watching the Origami date scene for a whole season
But adding Macarthur would require one of the characters always picking the single worst tactical choice they could <a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
(mostly)
No, they're European, not American
just 2022
There's fewer roads to Berlin when Berlin is being occupied by hostile aliens <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~plus, they could always sequel Road to Berlin at any point and people would watch it~~
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
believe me, if all the other trash they've pumped couldn't I doubt this will
I have no idea what that means
No, I think there's significantly more of a point to this than the fertility idol episode
Watch to the end
???
~~To be fair, they kinda are~~
the last season slayed me
Part of me wants to keep watching MHA to see how far it can fall, but I can't anymore
honest question though, what was the last shounen that stuck the landing and actually had a good ending?
also it has a strong tendency to devolve into power fantasy
but after it just plunged
I feel like it was already pretty overrated before then
yep
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
Bisque Doll is like 10x better than AoT though
It's actually amazing how good the super early moe shows were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLMGGpdgN-A
Moe peaked early

Carlos have you seen Chihayafuru?
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
I think I actually understand Karuta
I'm really fucking glad that Sangatsu gave up on trying to teach shogi early and just started letting it happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6rSoGxN8BE
exactly the way that dumpsterfire should have ended
Domestic Girlfriend's ending is just fucking perfect
Not a shounen but
~~Also Yousuga no Sora~~
Bokuben has at least one ending that everyone likes <:heh:789431887135113241>
Shounen just seems to be disproportionate
but like, that doesn't actually end
The best shounen I've ever seen is Noragami
||Doesn't he end up marrying like half the girls in the show||
https://tenor.com/view/blush-rias-gremory-highschool-dxd-anime-cute-gif-17791241
When you said a different kind of shounen I just thought "plot?"
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I've heard what happens in Dr. Stone going forward and it sounds fucking wild and like the whole plot just falls apart
Wow, so the ending improves on the rest of the series then <:Kapp:789259331072819241>
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>

Oh, I found the best CGDCT scene
I've pretty much despised the last two seasons
na, I'm fucking good
Wasn't expecting that
Fuck, Kyoto/Shaft actually got knocked out of my top spot hard
just stats
Card games>tanks
Chihaya is carrying my sports
Time to watch Monogatari <:KoyoTilt:489285273625034753>
for some reason
not a tag
Mecha is a genre
Fuck, Monogatari really hard carrying Ecchi out of last place too
Where'd I even find 93 urban fantasy anime <:OMEGALUL:789275945885761567>
yeah, that's because Anilist>MAL
My score ordering is weird AF though
In Anilist
Nope
The duality of man

Also, Clannad in 5
kinda surprised it isn't in school
I love the way how my top tags are just the same 6 or so anime over and over
That's the best I've got
Jojo's has some pretty satisfying season endings though <:02shrug:443257729646198784>
<:ICANT:863032804631642182>
fuck man, shounen fell out of my top 30 tags
<a:kokosips:887033279683899392>
Your profile>stats
Also, Kayano is that one VA who's actually in fucking everything but you just don't notice
Miki shows the BS Pokemon alone plays on my list
well, her too honestly
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
That's Hana Kana
no
wait
It really is a testament to how much crap Aoi Yuuki is in that she tops my list without being in Pokemon which is like, 4 days alone
Yep, requires 2 days and 12 hours minimum
It's not rating, it's watch time
~~technically Hana Kana too~~
Every other one I just haven't seen enough of to get on the list
Aoi, Nana, Kayano and Yuka
Mine only has 4 of the gear girls on there
Clannad Afterstory
You can't just average a 10 and a 5 like that <a:KEK:740160662721921104>
This seems unfair
~~also 5/6 are Monogatari actors and the other is a gremlin~~
Last one, but damn Maaya Sakamoto is like, only in good anime or something
It's actually watch time though
yep
I keep telling you guys Cloverworks isn't a bad studio <a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
I could watch Shield Hero to drop them right down <a:KEK:740160662721921104>
but uhhh, it makes sense that Kinema Citrus would be so high given that the only things I've seen from them are top tier anime
Kyoani and Shaft have always been my top 2 and they've went back and forth multiple times
<:OMEGALUL:789275945885761567>
I just love the "I only play red heads cuddling small animals" one
She went from helpless child to helpless child <:02shrug:443257729646198784>
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
All of the Pokemon+1 people got typecast in their other role too
He literally plays one character in every anime he's in
Is this cheating?
At some point I should stop watching all the seasonal trash shows and watch something good
<a:miotea:595829418694541342>
Damn
Or both
my release year is just the mountain
at least get the colour right
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
I've had more 10s recently than normal
<:ResidentSleeper:789440632136794113>
falling off
<:Doubt:696037552716775524>
and they also had no hand in Maid Dragon 1 or VE anyway
The only shows that were post fire were Maid Dragon 2 and VE Movie though
not surprised, that'd cause a lot of restructuring in general
I think it's because they missed out on Violet Evergarden, Maid Dragon and Silent Voice
Weirdly enough Do is actually below Kyoani for me
at number 4
they're the only support studio on my list then
Millhi Animation Do is Kyoani support studio right?
It's like, that +Carol and Tuesday+Godzilla
it's just MHA
For a second I was like "why is Bones so low"
dead bottom
Mappa is just
fairly respectable
yeah, but JC actually manages to reach a mid tier slot on my list
Like, I can't consider a studio that did Toradora, Pet Girl, Golden Time, Honey and Clover, Amanchu and High Score Girl (in part) bad
I've said it before but JC is actually very good at SoL
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Railgun S is the next anime
Kinda weird that JC is at the bottom for all you and just mid for me
otherwise it's fair
Feel like DEEN's getting hard done to there
Also while I'm at it bottom studios

I just love Bisque Doll so much
It's pretty good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DspoPnCYh-k
What's the world coming too?
Fuck, super wholesome, feetless Akebi ep
There's some CGI anime that leaned into it and came out looking very good too
Also Golden Kamuy redeemed itself by hand drawing the tiger in S3
It's pretty obvious that DP puts a lot of effort into the series every time
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
I could see them actually bothering to draw them since it's Jojo's
Because animating animals is really hard
Yeah, but at least it's not a recurring issue really
Like the bear attack in Golden Kamuy
Sometimes I can forgive it though
Arifureta is 100% in a similar boat to Overlord
Being better than Gibiate isn't an achievement
Than most anime they did, than other shitfests filled with bad CGI they didn't
Overlords just used CGI to a far greater extent and made less of an effort to cover it
Prove me fucking wrong
Overlords CGI suffers from being rendered on a PS2
The issue with Overlord is that it was consistent and terrible
I'm not even that bothered by something looking slightly bad
It was really jarring
It's in a lot more places if you pay attention. I can remember the chariot scene at the start of S1 used a flat CGI plane with a few objects placed on it to try to cover it up
mine was Citrus <:YuzuFailedSmug:827303707230076959>
I just find them extremely predictable and stale
<a:YuzuBlush1:827360787260899344>
I just saw a gyaru and put it on my PTW
just super chill
Akebi Chan is good
Probably, I just like to joke about Sakura Trick <:LuL:789259461470322728>
But yeah, Penguindrum is probably his most impactful work
Gay Bears is the only thing I think you've seen
I just love Ikuhara and his surrealist stuff though <:Yes:393865045005697034>
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
And the most gay anime ever made is Sakura Trick
It had a ton of influence on the Mahou Shoujo genre
Suprised you don't know that one

Need to watch before S2
Can't believe I've never watched this
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
Right, time to actually start The Ancient Magus Bride
yeah
You can also just work around CGI, Duke of Death and High Score Girl work because they're rom coms that don't need insane animation for example
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
I've actually seen more than a few good ones now
One of us <a:MioWinky:734914446811463761>

Sora Yori is great
yeah
The sequel movie was so good
~~also it has a train in it~~
and I actively seek out weird shit
It's one of the most unique anime I've ever seen
Penguindrum's definitely worth a watch
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
yep
with very few exceptions, the only one that's coming to mind super hard right now is Terminator
Even the best action films leave very little room for actually differentiating yourself as an actor
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/swql95/the_results_of_the_2021_ranime_awards/hxp8cpw/
Enjoy this example of why democracy can't work
Realistically though both have flaws, but holy hell every single award just going to the most popular show is garbage
Shows why jury selections are pretty important in awards
realistically should have been Fruits Basket, but at least it's something decent
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
Already have more respect for Reddit Awards than CR
I've never cared that much for them anyway, but that one just really doesn't do it for me
Mugen Train ED just sounds like generic LiSA to me
But like, no-one actually watched Shadows House so <:02shrug:443257729646198784>
out of all those options Nai Nai was the clear best
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
yep
This is actually the one ED that might have topped Shadows House for me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ql6ouR2NqN0
This ED got robbed not being a choice on CR's thing <:sigh:230149462880813056>
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I'm so over Beastars after the way the second season ended
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
Also we're 5 minutes into a convo on CGI and no one's mentioned LotL
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
it just looks like Pixar though
was about to mention that
<:BarbaraPray:790775956682964992>
Season 2
Probably going to do the dubbed Toradora rewatch at Christmas this year
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
I want a White Album 2 2
That's unexpected and super random
<:awwDuck:463096391452065792>
She's so cute
finally have a date

<a:BanPat:908920308520595496>
I love Kao so much
<:kirinoPout:499471452073099267>
I'm not convinced that this is going to end up being a good thing
I'm actually kinda worried about Sony picking up everything
<:rip:562636773394481163>
The only one I ever used was Anime Lab
I still don't know why half of it was recap
Me and my friend were watching it and just skipped the recap half
It's basically just Funimation's operation in a few European countries
Desu ne?
Gotta get around to that one
||then it just becomes more 'how the hell will they'||
Also, to be fair ||this is an actual romance anime and they actually drop the will they/won't they shit by about so 8 IIRC||
So she plays her favourite game of 'how close to touching him can I get without dying'
Also everything he touches dies
Very much so
<:thumbsup:535558767794978816>
Also, before I go to bed horny CGI
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jXU1OwG7I
nice
wait, him and Zangief get promoted in the sequel
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
rather than BG
Technically I think Guile should actually be listed as a supporting character
<a:kokosips:887033279683899392>
Oh yeah, this is also a Street Fighter anime
Turns out it's easier to make your 3D models look good when they don't have to move as much too
~~as is Bocchan but no-one believes me~~
One of the better romances of the last few years
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
If you like romance High Score Girl is worth a watch
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
My full CGI PTW is Dorohedoro, Kemurikusa and Kemono Friends
I've heard that's good
I gotta get my ass around to watching Dorohedoro though
but the amount of garbage technobabble ruined it for me
It was fine technically
I didn't like it
Ehhhhh
They seem to be the main two studios doing interesting stuff with CGI right now
Two studio Orange, two Shogakukan Music & Digital Entertainment
<:OMEGALUL:789275945885761567>
Their idea of motion blur was to turn of "remove last frame" on the gif maker
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
but not for good reasons
yes
I mean
Land of the Lustrous, the first half of both seasons of Beastars, High Score Girl and Shimagami Bocchan
god, the more I see that "motion blur" the worse it gets
There's some CGI anime I've legit really enjoyed though
https://tenor.com/view/exarm-ex-arm-crunchyroll-tongue-dude-gif-20493146
https://www.livechart.me/anime/10881
This probably counts too
cute girls doing panty puns <:heh:789431887135113241>
There's also this I guess
https://www.livechart.me/anime/11061
I'm not wrong in saying I don't need to read between the lines that hard on this one right? (Akebi)
yep
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
and Shamiko next season
Akebi can get fairly gay at points
Akebi, Cue and Slow Loop are all fantastic and next season's already looking pretty good too
I'm really enjoying the CGDCT so far this year
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
year of CGDCTs
Ash, trailer I linked actually looks good
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgmBeG0Yyl8
<:HomuLewd_MM:366003463777288193>
<:heh:789431887135113241>
Not like I have better things to do with my time
Watch the trailer and tell me this isn't CGDCT
Also speaking of things Shaft is sitting on I'd really like to see more Bishounen Tanteidan or Zaregoto
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Got delayed so long it fell back like 6 seasons of Monogatari
Kizumonogatari
I mean
At least they're working on Madoka
<a:GifNaruAngery:442384355885580308>
Shaft needs to get on to S3
The main reason I don't have it at 10 is because it doesn't end, which somewhat frustrates me
Good shit
Oh, you're up to the best Sangatsu arc too
It really is
What are you doing in my swamp?
<a:HibikiAniDisgust:777603915716755457>
All the more reason to just go on with my life as if 4chan doesn't exist
It looks a lot cleaner in motion generally, at least cleaner than that screencap <:LuL:789259461470322728>
yeah, it's a really bad frame <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Shop names were funny this week
But, there is one they fear, In their tongue he is Dovahkiin: DRAGONBORN!
They had some fun with this one <a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
I think we've moved past feet arc now
na
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
Akebi making me grin like an idiot
Nothing's ever going to top Imosae for not ending
The title card of Healer Girl really reminds me of something <:smugAnimeFace:670147065044795402>
gonna be 90 years old and on my deathbed and still going to be checking every time anime is announced to see if Yaga Kimi's there
but I'll always have that tiny amount left to be crushed
I wish I could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-I82IZatt4
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Every time there's a new anime announcement I check reddit hoping to see S2 of Yaga Kimi
Chef director <:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
Nana's characters epitomise suffering. Image related
Sora Yori is SoL
in no small part because that guy had it pretty good
Also I liked Nagatoro
I think it's good too, but that's just because I like every ecchi show ever
MC-kun in Nagatoro got pretty into it at times too
<a:EulaNuma:917276881831743500>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9FfYyXoVTE
I'll give it that
The show has an artstyle
Look, it's the missing pair of twins, Rim and Rum
Only girl worth watching for is Origami
<a:Nod:915873106323709962>
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
The best anime Geek Toys have ever made was Hensuki
<a:oofneon:471632591410167819>
Going from JC Staff to Geek Toys though
Their well animated shows are the exception
I mean, it's JC Staff?
https://twitter.com/AIR_News01/status/1500774066365419521
<:OrigamiDisgust:669074941597057025>
Honest though it is a trash visual because it lacks Origami
it's expected
Given how last season looked
Spy shows are usually fun
and I kinda love that about it
New Game is just pure fluff
What about the one about eroge VAs Mel <:LuL:789259461470322728>
I watched New Game and now I understand everything about the game industry <:heh:789431887135113241>
It's honestly more a list I go and pull something off of when I want to watch something
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>

kinda just accepted it's never getting done
My list just keeps growing
<:NotLikeYuzu:827360021062352896>
I made this mistake with Kyousogiga and spoiled half the series
they're just 2 cour
ye, the difference between 24 and 26 ep shows is pretty negligible
I don't think I've ever seen an ep of anime I cared less about
This week's AoT almost put me to sleep though
<:HomuDisappointed_MM:366003492080582667>
really weak generally
This is the first season in so long I've had single digit seasonals
same
1 more ep
I'm almost caught up
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
The storylines in Cue are definitely not of equal quality
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
and it's cute girls
still looks fun
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
god I'm so pumped for executioner next season
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Also who the fuck added moeblob to spellcheck
<:KannaBlob:661297438782652417>
~~time to convert more people to the moeblob cult~~
Princess Principle would be a legit good suggestion though
<a:MioNani:763141627576582215>
Time to hit them up with K-ON
The password was password1234
~~actually looks really good though~~
I can respect that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTjq-Xq3VIQ
Mappa just be like "fuck AoT, all our effort's going into the ballet anime"
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
yeah, the VA just nails it perfectly
It's going to be a long AF time before anything like Rakugo Shinjuu's ever made again
<@!331908049822547978> I'll post this here because it's not really gear discussion but this scene will always be one of my favourites because I don't think I've ever seen anything else like it and the voice acting is just so on-point, weirdly enough no spoilers

There you go
NGL
I have no idea about anything from that trailer
<:KanbaGrin:640613570283044894>
This shot reminds me of someone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIyILN4Y5k
This is interesting
one day I'll watch that
It's that one
Ohhh
Got a link to the show?
<a:CryBabyGif:562737712428482571>
You should watch Violet Evergarden Chrono, it's good
If they were going to remake it today I think it would be isekai
can't quite explain why <:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
The drums in the first track feel slightly off to me
Super looking forward to this
<a:shamiRave:692150056484077619>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEe40BIkfGA
<@!171395487247630336> new trailer
since the first couple of eps were good
One of them was just a fairly generic comedy, the other one is a yaoi romance that I'll get back to when I can be bothered
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
The two that I was over 6 eps behind on
Back up to date on seasonal anime ~~by just dropping two of them~~
Big same
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
good anime
Literally just posted that in Live Shitposting
Heh
Sort shounen by lowest score
Probably should have mentioned that
Stein's Gate 0 spoilers
||fucking Okabe spending decades repeating the same 5 minutes over and over to jump 20 years back in time one day per jump||
It's not a unique plot point but its always great when it works
||75 years IIRC||
Endless 8 vibes
It's up there as one of my favourite character arcs alongside Nadeko I think
Yeah, Nanas arc is super strong
I love the Revue of Anhaliation personally. The movie had some pretty amazing revues generally though
~~I'd watch a beyblade ep where the MC hooks their launcher up to a car engine and just shreds the other top though~~
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3BsDF6UjCQ
Let's just use these to launch our tops
just get me a V8 engine
I recon I could spin a top quicker
<:ChrisUgg:671982993195139094>
Man, I love it when subs are turned off by default
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
If you abstract enough an RPG is an isekai since you're inserting yourself into another world metaphorically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K55AALJm2qU
Something about this one induces dejavu
one of the most overlooked CGDCT anime
It's a really nice anime
Also, tramlines have such a great look <:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
Looks like this will be fun
Still Ancient Magus Bride
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
Fuck, I love series that actually bother giving the side cast backstory
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
Ahhh, the old issue of "we made the Nazi faction assuming our fans wouldn't be dumb enough to think they're the good guys"
<:kirinoThink:462470988186124308>
not sure why
People sometimes question if I have any taste at all too
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
Probably would have been more fun if they used the other kind of ERP and went full trash mode
For a second there I thought you were watching hot trash
<:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
Is ERP what I think it is?
<:concern:600157318470172682>
<:AquaThumbsUp:586125125875925033>
and her stomach actually
<:OMEGALUL:789275945885761567>
They forgot to colour her hands in
<@!152896851660505088> I have an absolutely atrocious frame for you
for those here that like it
https://twitter.com/bang_dream_info/status/1505020188785537025
New Bandori thing
Yeah
feels like something Ikuhara would do, unless it's been stated otherwise
Kinda hope it's one of those things where it's half reimagining
<a:YuzuHype:827505533345857567>
https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/183395
Really good though (spoilers, obviously)
what a world
I love how I watch AoT this morning and think "that's the best animation sequence AoT's had in years honestly", then it just gets same day crushed by a fucking CGDCT anime sakuga sequence
<:KokoCries:899166411283390536>
Akebi just hitting the feels hard straight off the bat this week
<:KarenThink:680615326882463776>
I want another Karen arc
Yeah, I really hope it continues
That would be an honest to god improvement
Final Season part 2 part 2
We need to talk about the definition of words and how bullshit this is <:LuL:789259461470322728>
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
People are actually saying the final season part 2 isn't going to be the end
https://tenor.com/view/star-wars-gif-24582703
Rare captured footage of AoT's antagonists attempting a last stand
Are any of them worth finishing?
<:EulaKek:917730928854442006>
From 2019
Imagine having a winter anime still on your watching list
And maybe Meiji Tokyo Renka, which has been on my watching list for almost 3 years now
I want to finish Magus Bride, Sayonara Zetsubou 2 and Ao Haru Ride
I'm finishing up a few things I think
All I ended up caring about
Legit just Bisque Doll/Akebi/Slow Loop/Cue
This season was so weak it ended up being as good break
Unless most of the shows are shit
I'm back on the seasonal churn next season probably
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
I'm watching all of them
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
The rest of their lineup for this year looks solid AF though
that would have been a hilarious way to develop anime in a really shitty way
I preferred thinking they just fished with three anime then cut the weakest link <a:KEK:740160662721921104>
are none of the staff shared with the other projects?
<a:ChrisWhat:669566598247481346>
Tokyo Ward 24 just got thrown to the wolves so Akebi and Bisque could live
then again, they're not doing a 3rd show this season
probably
Guess it worked this season so
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Wait, Cloverworks is releasing two anime on the same day again next season
12
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
You should, ep 11 is just insanely good
A straight remake is the last thing I expect from him
or even just like, the first ten minutes then "lol, not actually the same thing"
That's what I expect kinda
like Slime
There's a really strong trend of anime building an interesting world then just doing nothing with it
Just need more tea breaks
You know directing SoL is actually really hard right? It's super easy to make something just boring
My main problem was the nationalist propaganda <:concern:600157318470172682>
for whatever reason
Getting strong Chihayafuru vibes
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
Kyoukai had such a shitty ep 1
<:heh:789431887135113241>
This is where AoT's budget went
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTjq-Xq3VIQ
Weirdly looking forward to this
but yeah
I'll probably drop a lot of it
I have a fair few things

It's on mine
I don't like gamers
But like
Also yes
All before I ever watched Elfen Lied
I watched Kin-Iro Mosaic, New Game and Comic Girls all fairly early on too
I've pretty much always enjoyed CGDCT though, one of the first 10 anime I watched was Uma Musume
<:ababa:789441747678920735>
Elfen Lied is one of the very few anime where I couldn't even complete one ep
Why is Windows media player so shit?
<:hibikiSad:730391043425566836>
No train anime today
Damn it, don't have VLC on my laptop because I had to factory reset
Actually thinking about it original Mahou Shoujo seem to be quite common for some reason too
let's face it
And literally every isekai is an adaptation
then again, you could just be Wonder Egg and do both while being an original <:LuL:789259461470322728>
true and real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_LOPSpeYvE
El Psy Congroo
<:KokoCries:899166411283390536>
Clearly they do, we still haven't got Yaga Kimi S2 yet
Also what the fuck even is Blue Reflection Ray. It's an adaptationish
Maybe it's just that I don't remember the shitty adaptations as much as like, Flip Flappers, Madoka, Gear ect
https://tenor.com/view/sengoku-nadeko-gif-18401472
I have a bit of a thing for well executed surprise antagonists

I'm only here for that one character everyone hated
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
Hey, he's perfect for RWBY then
yet to be wrong
I put "Shaft doing weird shit on drugs" on my bingo every year
<:AYAYA:791866660603822080>
I'm pretty sure Karin had it too
I normally see it put on foreign characters who are meant to sound slightly off
Kasumi, I just don't know how else to define her speech pattern
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
wait, she can talk normally
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
arimasu, desu yo, arimasu
just bad foreigner Japanese
or, not even
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Man, hearing characters talk in overly formal language is grating
<:KirikaBully:781970709131165747>
I have to, living in a world without hope for Yaga Kimi S2 would just be too crushing
<:YuuPat:497829075243630612><:YuuPat2:497829839500345384>

I can't give up hope, it's all I have

I need only one
Why is this <:LuL:789259461470322728>
https://anilist.co/anime/146608/Title-to-be-Announced/
Outstanding
<:KokoPrayR:873257068621086750>
Just please give me my Idols and Pantsu
weird AF
and it's Shaft?
<a:ChrisWhat:669566598247481346>
What on earth are you talking about
<:heh:789431887135113241>
If I'm going to be watching way too many anime may as well watch one more
I want to watch the second season weekly
Nijigasaki
I'm watching a Love Live
<@!171395487247630336> I'm doing it
<:yuuAAAA:653314497007845426>
It is a good year, but I don't really think it had as many top tier shows as 2011

I have an almost entirely different lineup <:LuL:789259461470322728>
And one day I might even get around to watching these, some of which I know are good
pretty solid year
Like, Steins;Gate, Madoka Magica, Chihayafuru, Penguindrum, Yuru Yuri, Anohana
I want to say 2011 moreso than 2013
also a contender for best year honestly
2018 had 2 10s too
wait, I lied
so it's 100% up there for me
Only time I've ever given two things from 1 year a 10
honestly
I mean, it's more 2019 till now
To be fair, 2021 was actually a good AF year for anime in general
I think the most fun show over the last couple of years was Bishounen Tanteidan. Show's just absolutely insane and over the top
it had the potential to be good but just really wasn't
Back Arrow was pretty frustrating to me
Bishounen Tanteidan, Kageki Shoujo!!, and Akebi-chan no Sailor Fuku get honorable mentions too
Odd Taxi, Fruits Basket and Adachi to Shimamura I think
Which is probably why Ash and I both enjoyed it
From what I remember the SoL elements were actually the best part
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOwCcVDQ9ek
It also had a great ED
IDK, I thought the anime was pretty good, underrated
https://anilist.co/anime/112479/Assault-Lily-BOUQUET/

It's a series
Assault Lily was pretty fun though. I enjoyed it anyway <:EulaShrug:821624927710216232>
For various reasons I think Tonikaku is probably the worst romance anime I've ever watched
yes
Here's the rest of the shows I generally disliked
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
I have one below but I'm not posting on this server

Which is Shigatsu rather than Sangatsu
Piano is Your Lie in April
Japanese chess basically
It's about shogi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6rSoGxN8BE
March
3 gatsu=3rd month
How the hell have you not heard of March Comes in like a Lion
maybe also Maquia I guess
The only one of those shows which is at all obscure is Tsuki ga Kirei
since I tend to like, try not to watch trash most of the time
I do too, but it is positively skewed
at all
I mean, 7.5 isn't bad
Both seasons of Honzuki, both seasons of Kono Oto, BGS movie and Runway
na, the anime you listed
I have an astonishing amount of those at exactly 7.5
Pretty unlikely any of them get bumped
So yeah
every 10 I've given so far
Toradora, Monogatari Second Season and Yori Mori
3 of my 10/10s have been rewatched and so far they've all survived it
Just from memory
I moved down XV and AXZ
I moved a few series of Gatari up, I moved up Starlight and Symphogear S1
others I've moved up
For some I have
I'm pretty sure if I rewatched it I'd rate it quite a bit higher
It's one of those shows that's like Revue Starlight to me
<:KirikaFish:717138469381734471>
such a good show
I think Penguindrum is lowkey making that year feel so much better to me
even if there's a lot less
I think it's just the fact that other than Fate I actually quite like every one of these shows
I probably care more about Oreimo and Kiniro than AoT or Log Horizon honestly
Once it starts dropping to 7.5 I'm not rating them that highly or really factoring them in
~~Gridman's 100% reliant on Akane to function~~
<a:CarolBonk:801541794713829437>
Gurren is Gianax
because they actually managed to ground themselves somewhat
I will always argue that the best Trigger show is Gridman
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
Even this still makes me fucking laugh
The one that landed super hard for me was Gekkan Shoujo
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
Hinamatsuri was fantastic too though
It just felt like it was trying so hard to be dark and edgy and it never landed
But yeah, on what I meant when I say "male fantasy" I honestly consider Marin to be less prototypical of that archetype than moon girl. Marin has her own set of wants and goals that she pursues with or without the main character. She's actually the driving force of the show and if Gojou was a weaker character the show would actually be dragged somewhat in the other direction with her completely controlling the show and Gojou having no agency.
I thought it was hyper overrated from the first ep
Imagine that but I didn't even enjoy the first half <a:KEK:740160662721921104>
IDK why I didn't drop it honestly
Almost put me to sleep
It didn't have to be written that way
"there's reasons for it" doesn't excuse its existence
Fate is that low because I struggled to even watch the anime and would have probably dropped if not for watching it with someone else
So, I really dislike the way how Tonikaku handles the female MC. She's pretty much just the ultimate male fantasy character who never really does anything significant unless it involves the male MC in some way. I've called her a complete doormat before and I stand by it.
Wonder Egg isn't even that bad <:LuL:789259461470322728>
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
I hated Zero, Illya was at least generic Mahou Shoujo
Illya is the best Fate I've ever watched
Also, to be fair here
<:monaderpy:854593417585491988>
Actually
I was thinking of Fate/EXTRA Last Encore
Then again, I still think that F/A looks more interesting than most fate series <:EulaKek2:924067762672918589>
Shaft is super good when they hit, but I'm getting those Fate/Apocrypha vibe from it
That's about all I can think of for positives
I guess it had a cool colour pallet?
same
or more, there's studios that can do both
There's better style over substance studios anyway
but yeah, I don't even rate Trigger super highly
<a:kokoflapgif:935888668122546206>
I'm down
Wait, generic SoL, slightly ecchi rom com?
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
I wonder if Bisque will get a S2
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
That would have been kinda cool if it was
Was this from a different season Ash?
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I love this
yeah

This is so good
She's in an anime next season at least
yes
That's the best way to say it clearly
I'm talking about the day in 5:xx/12:xx days time <:02shrug:443257729646198784>
huh, guess not then
it's not the day with Love Live, it's the day before
so that's probably your Friday
Remember I live in Aus
JFC I just checked and my Saturdays are utterly stacked
I don't want to live in a future with flying cars. People are shit enough at driving regular non-flying cars
True AF though
The point's more that they immediately made an anti-consumer change the second they consolidated market share
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
CR monopolising streaming will be a good thing though, we promise
Ash... that's an underline
There's a week between the first batch and second
Nope

It's Key, so there's a catch

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1uHiosEdk8
<@!171395487247630336> This one feels like it's for you
I honestly think Akebi was one of my favourite CGDCTs anime I've ever seen
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
That last ep was so good
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
"If I take of the glasses no-one will recognise me"
I love that this Love Live season works off Superman logic
I might watch it in the few days between seasons
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
didn't
The first ep was cute but then I just kinda
I need to pick it back up at some point
||This is a confession of love||
Which one?
Idols but broke, horny and living together was fun too
Idol but from the PoV of a fan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3asMnOdv9HE
Still my favourite idol anime though
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
Maybe that's just because I keep randomly watching "Idols but they get bossed around by a wall" or "Idols but they're also witches"
it did feel just a touch generic though
Not my favourite idol show ever, but not bad
Different anime
There's only one Kanon though
The Kyoani one
I respect the attempt
Air is a thing
https://tenor.com/view/kanon-makoto-sawatari-anime-gif-8942899
Anyway, watch Kanon, doesn't have that
<:GanyuSad:786063114558898236>
Still hits like a ton of fucking bricks
Just watch Kanon instead
It goes beyond not sticking the landing, they fucking torched the ground below their own feet and set themselves on fire upon landing
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I still can't believe that they actually had a "yelling at disabled girls" arc
It's still better than modern Key though
Like, I feel like Air is even more interesting
Angel Beats is so much weaker than classic Key though
It's rough at parts, but still really good
I've watched through Air, so like, 0 chance I'd drop Clannad
Clannad good though
üç°
Clannad Afterstory
But if they just killed it at this point I'd feel nothing
I'm still gonna keep going just to see the dumpsterfire, I'm too deep in now
It's gone too far
Legit just giving a 1/10 for the final season part 2 not being the end
I don't care at this point Millhi, I'm too tilted by "Final" Season
My current rule for Isekai is that it either needs to have yuri or be Honzuki, otherwise it gets the skip
Na, gonna do it <:KiriPout:754834668322291723>
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
I should watch Dimention W one day too
Basically Asuka
https://tenor.com/view/rifle-is-beautiful-chidori-rsc-erika-anime-flip-hair-gif-15347216
<:Papika:650665000653946882>
They did the best Mahou Shoujo anime
I liked Rifle is Beautiful too
They've made some good stuff <a:Eulayay:832643711719440434>
I like 3Hz though
What?
Oh, it's 3hz
||Then he turned himself into a crow, funniest thing I've ever seen||
It's just so damn weird
I do think Air has one of the wildest "what the fuck" endings out of anything I've ever watched though
But holy fuck it's long
Maybe I'll watch it one day
Fair enough then
It may have some uhhh other issues though
~~Citrus's ending is low key great for this too~~
Also, as much as your joking there, yuri and yaoi do have above average political takes just because they generally start with the assumption that it's fine to be gay, which is leaps and bounds above of "Japanes imperialism was good, actually" which isn't an uncommon political basis for series
I mean not garbage political basis
By "good" I don't mean in depth
Not in a hurry to either honestly
At all
I haven't seen Gundam though
I don't need to suck any more at them then I already do
I need to watch Eds for AMQ
Every ep normally
There was also that one mecha with the "do something about climate change idiots" theme too
I actually can't think of that many series that are grounded on a bedrock of solid politics. Only one that's really coming to mind is Kaiji. Kinda a shame really
Anime and having shitty politics, name a better pair
I haven't really looked into it though
I'd believe it
That's something that's just best avoided
The issue isn't the idea of both sidesing a conflict, it's doing so specifically while using Nazi imagery
I think I've said it before, but if you're going to use Nazi imagery don't both sides your conflict, for the love of god
I reckon the best way to follow up AoT would be something super cutsy and vapid, fuck it
Umaru-chan went to far by even existing
Plus a lot of the reveals are just fucking dumb
And it just makes the anime have this huge downward slop of interest as more things get revealed
I feel like the issue AoT has always had is that every reveal is just way less interesting than it's built up to be
Umaru-chan
It's mostly just filtering out trash <:omegalul:851650859187568662>
It's more that they even called this the final season
I've heard
~~the one with the eroge VAs~~
Only so much you can do when everyone around you is completely apathetic
She tried <a:crybaby_a:563053256922628116>
Maid Dragon
<:ElmaHappy:555798802695585802>
That happened
But fuck
I was going to say I need cute girls unionising to balance this out
I think in NG's case it's far more likely that they're a product of the frame they chose to use and the desire to generally hold an upbeat tone rather than any malice
The point was that the politics exist and are bad, not that they're important to the show or make the show bad
Yeah, I'm aware
Like, most CGDCTs anime are pretty neutral and vapid. I think of you're looking for politics in Yuru Camp you're in the wrong place for example. New Game is one of the very few that actually plays it's hand in that way and does so quite poorly.
New Game does a lot to normalise and minimise some pretty horrific industry practices like crunch, treating them as a joke a lot of the time and even going so far as to show positive outcomes from them without showing the destructive side of them on employees.
That's a real thing
The manga version of Kapital exists BTW
Amazing
Honestly, New Game is 100% in the kinda crap politics bucket. It's not imperial whitewashing bad but it has huge issues
You could even have one game take up multiple seasons and it wouldn't even be unrealistic
Can cricket get some love?
Or playing cricket
Anyway, since we've established that cute girls will cover literally every topic I expect my cute girls leading a worker revolution anime. Instant 10/10
But to me this is less interesting
You are right though Cypher, in universe politics in anime has a habit of sucking
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Anywhere from 1-35 gb
Kaiji is anticapitalist, Moriarty is pro worker and sympathetic to revolution, Arte is feminist etc
But I'm less talking about internal, in world politics and more the structural politics that the work is based on
Realistic can still be shitty. Excusing genocide while accepting it happens is both. Slightly extreme example, but it gets the point across
Sherlock is just kinda boring <:02lul:414576440114151424>
Personally I find the revolutionaries waging a class war to be the more interesting as characters anyway
I guess technically Moriarty the Patriot had some fairly decent political ideas. Turns out making Moriarty the protag of Sherlock has some interesting consequences
It's super interesting as an idea
We could also point out the metatextual issue of writing your character in that way and trying to elicit sympathy for a pest is pretty weird
Yeah, being a victim yourself does not make committing immoral acts justified
Based on what I've heard he deserves it
Yeah, should be fantastic
Check the date
Technically airs tomorrow but I won't watch at 11pm
*that's in two days for me
https://anilist.co/anime/129193/Shokei-Shoujo-no-Virgin-Road/
ironically with an isekai anime <a:KEK:740160662721921104>
Oh, next season starts tomorrow for me
https://anilist.co/character/70733/Satan-Jacob
He's OK too
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
Wait, is Satan an isekai protag
The only male protag who I at all like is Subaru
I've generally found female isekai protags much more interesting than male, probably because they don't have the completely defined trope archetype
||They killed Kirito||
Executioner seems good so far
Spring has a lot going for it
but they don't constantly pull the entire show apart in the same way Back Arrow's do.
It's not like it didn't have issues itself
Code Geass was a whole lot more cohesive than Back Arrow
It wasn't horrible, but at times it got pretty bad
Ehhhhh, Back Arrow had a ton of issues
Back Arrow
...
Boku NO hero
so
Fall's still lacking, but it's like half a year off
Golden Kamuy and Kyokou Suiri should be fun
The only three anime I really care about next season
I was over it after the first ep
You gave Leadale way more time than I did
There's too many
I doubt all these shows are surviving
I have others from that list too
wait, that's just my spring
Executioner is also surprisingly less jank than I expect from JC Staff at this point <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Everything that's aired so far has been good honestly
Good shit
This season already feels at least as good as the last one though <:LuL:789259461470322728>
I'll watch it in the morning I guess
yeah, it's a fake language
uhhh, it might actually just be a mash up of romance languages <:LuL:789259461470322728>
it might be Italian, but translate's struggling
not 100% sure
The end sounds like French?
well, mostly
yeah
ye
Nice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wykhe7OgZeA
Executioner's OP already has a full version
first ep was pretty cute
https://tenor.com/view/origamitobiichi-gif-14750296
<:OrigamiPog:596130137557172224>
The only thing I care about from DaL is Tobiichi
To be fair, the few CGDCT anime last season were rock solid
Really weak season other than Cloverworks
Last season+a couple of things from today
Also looking forward to abs lady showing up
<:kuroM:804191436601950219>
Getting some Kuroko vibes from her
I really like Momo though

Oh, Irina, do you have to watch Girls and Pantsu if it's idol?
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
I can read, I just don't feel like having to read a novel every time I play a card
I want to rewatch Penguindrum now that I actually know what the anime is about though
*if you understood an anime completely the first time through it wasn't pretentious enough
https://tenor.com/view/revue-starlight-revue-starlight-gekijouban-revue-starlight-movie-daiba-nana-banana-gif-24565020
Nor do I
Seasonal anime is a thing
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>

I watched a couple of eps of that
https://tenor.com/view/hibike-euphonium-kumiko-surprised-gif-7347114
<:EulaCopium:902362128156082266>
I need to watch the movie where Kumiko doesn't exist for two hours and mysteriously comes back at the end
Cease satanspawn
why not at this point honestly?
Shoulda just bundled them all into one and said it was a home movie release
Yep, all 4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrgxHDoe8gA
Since apparently all 4 eps dropped
<:meduka:411309768997732354>
Time for Meduka
which isn't always the case
At least you can almost guarantee that the female character(s) will have, well, a character
Otome anime can be really fun though
It's pretty fun and comfy

It's called High Score Girl
Yes
Other than Mob Isekai which I'm very close to dropping everything I've seen so far this season has been good though
I think Executioner is still my favourite out of the first eps so far, but Healer Girl was up there too
This was my reaction to it with the guys I was watching with <:LuL:789259461470322728>
This one was fairly heavy handed though
IK
It's a bit lewd though
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
It's 100% your kind of anime
Did you watch it Ash?
RPG Fudousan
No

and I'm fine with that
most of what they do is just cute girl stuff
but yeah
Their best anime is still Geken Shoujo
Also god bless Doga Kobo doing literally the exact same thing again <:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
Lots of innuendo
I did have one girl telling another she'd pierce them, take that as you may
First ep barely introduced the second main girl
Not sure
Birdie Wing was absolutely stuffed with innuendo <a:HarumiThumbsUp:827358424177311794>

Heroine Tarumono seems solid, now we have a cute girl managering for male idols anime
Japan is almost a whole day ahead of the US
Iski the 8th is the date it releases in Japan
https://anilist.co/anime/143277/Urusei-Yatsura-2022/
Guess it wasn't an announcement but it's the first I've seen of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P6Inyz40JY
This was a weird announcement I didn't expect to see
Then again, this is diving into the difference between individual Kirara adaptations, which only people who watch way too much cute girl anime can even do <:LuL:789259461470322728>
the comedy, characters, general aesthetic and ecchi all feel pretty alike Meirochou
I wasn't getting gochiuusa from anything but the character designs
Everyone keeps comparing it to Is the Order a Rabbit but to me it feels a lot more like Urara Meirochou
<:Comfyu:906964799785689118>
That's exactly what I want though
Even more to watch tomorrow
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I think I've said it before but Love is War has a huge issue with predictability and staleness, which aren't great things for a comedy to have. For me at least Chika helps with that by just being a character who's written in a way to specifically make that not happen
every other character is utterly predictable
Chika is the only character I've ever found interesting or funny
<:02shrug:443257729646198784>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPqtXiyYx94
Also Chico with Honeyworks <:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
~~Rikei ga Koi is better anyway~~
I like Chika but when she's not on screen the series is a drag
I have mixed feelings about Kaguya
Cue's A plot is so good, IDK why they didn't just use that plotline and ditch the other's honestly
ye, but it's 10pm now and I'm about to sleep, so I'll watch the anime that's like 2 hours away in the morning
Still have a decent amount on that day
Probably tomorrow for you
Na, SpyxFamily is the day after this
Fair
Executioner and Kagyua?
<:WhenDessGetsAtYou:738421651393216534>
Gonna die tomorrow

By far my favourite scene in this anime
<:ARRYAYA:470759923823804417>
like High Score Girl could have been a lot bigger if it had a proper simulcast
Even some shows that don't go completely under the radar have been hurt by it
Remember when they simulcasted Violet Evergarden and it was great?
<:Amber_SaveMe:795762965835546664>
It's an interesting premise but if it goes too hard in that direction I'll probably drop it
I could see that happening
Even DAL <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Literally every other Romcom that aired today being better than Kaguya
<:ARRYAYA:470759923823804417>
Sentai romcom looks pretty good
Bless this series
She did the "Aki-ha-bara" thing and then I just couldn't see her as anything else <:kirinoLUL:475865268736884737>

Mappa put more effort into one ep of this dancing anime than they did in 2 whole seasons of AoT
The girl crushing on her on the other hand
Good shit
The last ep (1 week ago, haven't watched this week yet) actually made me tear up

<:awwDuck:463096391452065792>

<@722121666641133608> did you see D4DJ's getting a second season BTW
I raise you Fujiwara
I did
IDK, I think there's a lot better
I thought the Sentai romance anime was stronger personally.
<a:vvAussieLurking:454378483510935562>
Wait, I thought we were a cult anyway
at least that's what I see from it
I think the goal was to evoke angel imagery?
||I think it's more like painkillers/treating the symptoms than a cure all based on what the show's been showing so far, so calling a hospital afterwards kinda makes sense||
<:Comfyu:906964799785689118>
I'm just enjoying the comfy cute girl stuff
What's wrong with it
I'm really enjoying it so far
<:ChrisSing:660514248211955836>
yeah, Ayahi's singing was very good
More Kase San anime please
I don't really take issue with calling shows that are fairly ambiguous yuri, but it would be nice to have some more romance yuri
<:kurisuSip:853129422403403816>
Steins;Gate good
even in the cute girl space we had Akebi
I don't think I'd go as far as my favourite of the year though
It's a cute girl anime
Cue is quite good

<:LuL:789259461470322728>

<:KirikaBully:781970709131165747>
Also, too many vowels in a row
<:Comfyu:906964799785689118>
Finally getting around to watching Deaimon, getting huge comf vibes from this
She has the same energy
This girl gives me mad Kanade vibes though
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/u43vd8/in_another_world_with_my_smartphone_season_2/
<@171395487247630336> is this your fault?
Kokomi mains really does have an emote for everything

Gacha in a nutshell
I like it too, but the antiending really spoiled a lot of it for me
I can't think of anyone better
Na, if you're going to make a villain it may as well be ||CERN||

I really like this though
She's ewil
Seems good
Think my top three this season are probably Executioner/Heroine Tarumono/Birdie Wing right now
It's definitely in my top three this season
Anyway, I'm really enjoying this series
||They definitely did something there <:MonaBlush:763702128757047306>||
So uhhh, does Virgin Road need to ||change its name after the last ep, just saying <:KokoBlushes:899168324498391040> ||

It's pretty rare for anime to get a full animated OP officially like this right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNDS_UyHzvk
Watch Ex Arm
CR Originals was mostly a branding thing rather than a change in the way they did anything
They did things with the same model both before and after CR Originals
except that author was intent on writing a doormat rather than a dom
Kinda the same shit that ruined Over the Moon for You for me
This is a recurring issue in shounen romance though, which does make sense when you consider the target audience
<:SenjoCute:230208505678790656>
all of the characters just act like an archetype rather than a person
it's not even just her
Shikimori is one of the fakest romances I've ever watched
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Shikimori once again proving that I really don't understand shounen fan's taste in romance
On Ice
Always a safe bet
~~the ultimate fantasy honestly~~
I'm in for every word of that <a:KEK:740160662721921104>
~~Nice~~
I'd be down for that <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Is this the "I want to become a moeblob" show?
Fair
NGL
The PV image isn't giving me a lot of hope
<:ICANT:863032804631642182>
The voice acting is apparently meant to sound foreign, but they got a fluent Japanese VA and just dropped in random English words in a computer generated voice in the middle of his sentences
||Cue||
IDK if it's meant to be but this voice acting is the funniest shit I've seen in a long time
<a:panic:589215632772431893>
Why is this happening
What the fuck am I watching?
||What if she actually did rewind time to make sure the towel dropped <:Kapp:789259331072819241> ||
Thanks for not fucking this one up JC Staff
Series has been way better than I expected so far
I'm excited
Either that or Kirito
Akari is laying on the cute pretty thick though
<a:kokosips:887033279683899392>
It's my story and I'm sticking with it
I'm just going to lean towards "she meant to do that" <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Yo Ash, I'm just gonna point out on this one ||Akari can control time, if she didn't want this to happen she could have rewound it. She was totally OK with naked hug. Also from what I've heard it gets more yuri than this||
<:ShiraBean:736607747834904667>
I still think that's how this will go down
Well kinda
I called the ending of this week's Koi wa Sekai Seifuku on a different discord two weeks ago <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Actually enjoying this series after the first ep, it has that air of trash romcom about it that I just love
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0llzTiAMYY8
Really nice ED
||Time doesn't move at the same speed in both worlds would be my guess||
<a:oofneon:471632591410167819>
Eve and Aoi definitely have a thing going too
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
yes that is actually a line
Just girls talking about piercing each other with their 48 inch shafts
||Why is there a vampire now?||
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
Birdie Wing has some great insane energy
RPG Real Estate 0 context
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Ah yes, seasonal Kirara anime being gay as fuck again
Kukoro's entire character honestly <:kuroM:804191436601950219>
IDK, I'm enjoying Birdie Wing a lot
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
which is like, three venn diagrams that I sit exactly at the middle of
It's just a super horny romcom filled with science and maths jokes
It's not
It's also one of the horniest anime this season
I love random science and maths jokes everywhere <:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
That
Also if you're looking for another really good show that no-one's watching
Does this count <a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMoXh-hmuRg
Is it part of the imouto multiverse too
Heroine Tarumono
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I feel like every season I end up liking random anime that no-one else watches more than most other things
<a:NadekoRaspberryHyper:695404743173865472>
Pure insanity
Bakemonogatari
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Aharen san actually adding a real pokemon strat into the ep
<:ShirabeHeart:738932033635483738>
Sentai romcom is super cute
Erika especially though
Pretty much
Yeah
<:EulaHeadpat:832988078418821120>
Kao
Her name is literally Orwell
I really like the princess
Ye, finished it
I'm glad they played that card early rather than trying to act like it was a surprise <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Executioner ||Orwell was a bad guy <:ChrisShock:620077681484103680> ||
I mean, if a yuri powered golf anime where a girl drives a ball through a moving train with mafia elements and an illegal golfing scene tied in doesn't convince you then you're pretty deep into burnout <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
it's fantastic
Birdie Wing is actually one of my favourites this season
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Why does this feel so much like a shitpost

<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Also, I love that they basically just said ||fuck your generic isekai city||
she deserves better
Damn I felt bad for Momo though
<a:panic:589215632772431893>

Check out Birdie Wing if you haven't though
<:Comfyu:906964799785689118>
That's the best part
~~maybe there's a trend here~~
<:shamiAyaya:692560697716113458>
I'm enjoying this season quite a bit, just don't rank most of those very highly personally. Love After World Dom is fine, the others are a bit weak. More into Birdie Wing, Executioner, RPG Real-estate, Healer Girl and Shamiko
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
But the actual show is just so average
Ye, I can see that
Like, 4th or 5th this season
But 100% not second of all time
Like it's OK
Am I the only one who feels like SpyxFamily is just a whatever seasonal?
Hopefully like 3 hours more
Looking forward to getting home to watch this
<:KokoBlushes:899168324498391040>
Also this
golf anime BTW
No, but there was a ||political assassination via rocket launcher||
<a:kokosips:887033279683899392>
Birdie Wing really does just one up itself every week
I want a whole series of this image
I have a pretty nice Bell curve
I relate to this man sometimes
In Machikado's case it's also a food pun
Shamiko's VA puts in some absolute crazy work
https://tenor.com/view/machikado-mazoku-machikado-mazoku-shamiko-tail-slap-gif-25533672
Machikado is very good too
This is like, three layers of abstraction
<a:panic:589215632772431893>
Oh my god, Japanese language using English in ways that barely makes sense again
<:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
Can't believe Key destroyed me twice with the exact same play
||she does die not that long after||
Makes sense
<:OhISee:789442634825334784>
Ancient show
Does Clannad even need spoilers still?
||~~well they are married~~||
I haven't watched, but Nagisa and Tomoya?
nice
Best anime this season
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
Oh yeah, that's tomorrow
She's barely tolerating Momo
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
This image is just the anime community in a nutshell
<:shamiGay:695956216656035850>
Wow, that Machikado ep
good season for yuri
Oh yeah, Shamiko and RPG too
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
Birdie Wing and Executioner are both pretty up there
I've been surprised by how gay a couple of things this season are
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
I mean, Yaga Kimi was
<:monacopium:840481555030081548>
After Yaga Kimi S2
Also, what's up with yuri anime and German?
I'd be down
as much as that would piss off a lot of manga fans I'm sure
Yuri ecchi is fun anyway
Seems like something you might like Ash
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/upfczg/yuri_is_my_job_teaser_visual/
yo, that's pretty nice
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Already did

<a:YuzuGayPanic:827361568756858890>
aaaaaaaaaaaaa
<:YuzuFailedSmug:827303707230076959>
Also Passione has definitely done some yuri before
The anime is called "Yuri is my Job" Ash, there's going to be some
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
I'm down for this
got posted earlier but yeah
I thought that was seal
<:ShiraBean:736607747834904667>
Haru is super cute though
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Tohru is actually one of my all time faves
I was thinking of this one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCxDJnHiLqs
Citrus S2 when?
I actually prefer the series to Rebelion too
I definitely don't hold the pace against it though, I actually tend to like slightly slower paced anime
I don't think Madoka is the best mahou shoujo, but it's possibly the most interesting to me
This golf anime has the same energy as Symphogear and it's fucking weird
What the fuck is Birdie Wing actually <:LuL:789259461470322728>
same
Actually made a male childhood friend love interest not suck
the fuck?
Heroine Tarumono's ep this week was so good
Who killed Hatsune Miku?
Every few weeks this anime does something super gay and I love it (Rikei ga Koi)
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
Akari being extra horny this week
since it's so heavily based on isolated arcs
The good thing about Gatari is that it has good jumping on/off points pretty much everywhere
It's probably my all time favourite honestly
Want me to give you my 5 day schedule <:Kapp:789259331072819241>

RPG Realestate just keeps getting hornier <a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Birdie Wing gets insane
Na, it's fine
Basically existential horror about how shit the human race is
it's so good
If you have a chance check out Shinsekai yori
it's everywhere
It's most common in isekai
???
a fairly common one at that
That's an archetype
<:Mona_Love:772190941070491678>

because they just have a setting and characters
Trying to explain what most cute girl anime is about is pointless
It's just a SoL anime
<:shamiAmazed:710838508792840242>
very good
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
if you just search Shamiko on most sites it shows up though
Machikado Mazoku
https://tenor.com/view/the-demon-girl-next-door-machikado-mazoku-shamiko-gif-14866097
Shamiko is precious

Yes, but it has a female MC

I'm actually quite enjoying a male idol show this season
<a:crybaby_a:563053256922628116>
Oh no, what did they do to Momo
<:NadekoFries:591296872094892035>
Hana Kana
I really can't be bothered
meh

I'm really appreciating Kunoichi Tsubaki remixing its ED for every ep
Exactly what it says
Man, we get a ||gay gyaru|| and this line in the same episode, show just became Citrus <:MatsuriGiggle:827303704239669288>
amazing <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Ayane Sakura playing two gyaru in the same season
<:Blushyu:899069716356825128> Shamiko
Kase San?
<:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
It's yuri
not really a plot
Also very gay
And it just gets hornier and hornier
Strike Witches is great

That's S2 but it really doesn't spoil much

<@722121666641133608> Posted this in another channel you can't see but I'm fairly sure you'd enjoy this one too when you have time
like, the first leans super hard on comedy vs the second super hard on drama
It's a weird series though, the first season and second season have very different vibes
It's been a bit gay for a while <:LuL:789259461470322728>
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
I wish there was more good urban fantasy anime though

<:NotLikeYuzu:827360021062352896>
I just wish it would die and Bones could go back to Noragami
MHA is very content just to tread the same repetitive ground
It's a case of decaying plot
I literally have S5 scored lower than this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhgiiVddR5c
the longer it ran the more trash it got to the point where S5 is probably one of the worst anime I've ever seen
This is basically how I feel about MHA
IDK why I even finished the last one
I'm just skipping the next season
<:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
I'm so over MHA
I'm always down for anything involving Key
<:Kapp:789259331072819241>

Look, a cute girl anime and nothing else
I guess Prima Doll and Yurei Deco seem the most interesting
Not that much for me

Literally watching that now
and CGDCTs
<:NaruBlob:442755492989894688>
I'm loving all the SoL anime this season
Na, that was comparatively sane
the series goes completely off the rails in the best way possible
Ye, you should
it's so much fun
I think Birdie Wing might actually be my favourite of the season at this point
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/v4dkyv/ayakashi_triangle_will_air_in_2023/
Also <@171395487247630336> one for you

https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/v8xvc5/shaft_establishes_a_new_studio_in_shizuoka_city/
Either way, this show is getting above and beyond levels of effort
at least I assume, maybe it's not and Wit's doing most of the work on SxF <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I'm actually kinda amazed how much work Clover Works is putting into this random ninja CGDCTs show when it's just their side project right now
<:heh:789431887135113241>
it's so good
cmon
Like
I'm already coping for Gems S2
Only anituber I know who has explicitly good politics in his videos <:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
Gotta respect MB for the amount of "fuck actual golf, it ruins the environment" in this vid though
I'd take a S2 for now
Baby steps

I just want a S2
pls no
One of the issues I have with Index really is its tendency to overexplain which gets in the way of the flow of the show
Actually, not explaining something is often just good writing
A plothole is when you contradict something you wrote
Not explaining something is not a plothole
Who cares?
hard agree
<:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
You can watch Railgun without Index and it's fine
Na, Railgun T is just good because it's actually a solid anime with good character and plot writing
And yeah, I don't think railgun fans would even care that much if they just diverged
for everything actually
Just give me a SoL spinoff
<:NadekoFries:591296872094892035>
If you want good nonlinear storytelling just watch Monogatari though
not adapting it
The hard part about nonlinear storytelling is writing it in a way that doesn't suck
That's really not true
honestly
The gap in effort between Railgun and everything else Index related is amazing
Maybe try a genre search?
Wish I could help Ange but I don't know much about Manhua
<:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
would that conclusion really detract from the viewing experience though
Why else would she just disappear without a trace? Pretty sure I could have put two and two together there.
I mean, Frenda being dead is pretty easy to work out from Railgun <a:KEK:740160662721921104>
The point is that leaving out information is completely fine. Even fairly major information. You can just like, allow your viewers to piece things together
~~mental health issues~~
<a:kokosips:887033279683899392>
god bless
Also Monogatari never actually tells the viewer what the show is actually about
it's fucking Frenda
who cares
again
plus like
It actually creates a mystery on its own
It doesn't really matter
and that's a really good example of how leaving the viewer with less information can be better
You know what one of my favourite anime moments is though Cypher? The ||death scene|| in Rakugou Shinjuu. The anime plays the scene three times from three different unreliable narrators and only hints at which one is actually correct. It's actually so much more satisfying than if they'd have just explained which one was the actual correct scene
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
which is even worse
No, it just explains useless factions over and over

<:shamiAyaya:692560697716113458>
Because her family is a line of demons
So many rainbows
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaUvSzJ1pog
Also just this
Still a better reason than dislike of sand
In the last ep one of the characters straight up fell to the dark side because she didn't get to eat the lunch her GF made for her
It's just very good, cute SoL though
Demon girl wants to defeat magical girl ||and maybe other things too ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)|| and also looking for her lost dad and her rival/GFs lost sister
It's super cute
https://tenor.com/view/the-demon-girl-next-door-machikado-mazoku-shamiko-gif-14866097
I think you'd enjoy it
Next time you want to watch a good anime you should check out Machikado
||She did it to herself||
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
It's pretty gay though
Time to go to Brazil
At one point she teleports into the shower with her
<:kuroM:804191436601950219>
So Railgun passes the Ash test
||I just knifed a guy and ran off to cuddle with Rikka to make myself feel better||
Gridman's subtext is pretty strong
I don't see why it should need to be explicit when it doesn't for het romance
<:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
I'm just very open to calling borderline series yuri
yeah, that's fair
<a:AkaneParty:516144087921852436>
yes
Subtext
Like I'd call Gridman yuri
I've seen a ton of yuri too, I'm just more open to what counts as yuri than Ash is
It's a hard show to explain though, because it doesn't really have to be "about" anything. It's just about character interactions mostly
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-9ASSbqAbU
The entire show is a giant memefest too
"don't think you've won"
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
Also while we're on the topic of good yuri
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuG7sUdfkFM
It means a disbelief in all supernatural occurrences/phenomena and only believing in the existence of the material world
I'm a materialist <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
literally
and it is
He exists to be generic shounen isekai protag
Well, there was
Machikado especially over the last few eps
yeah
That one's definitely pretty gay
YagaKimi
https://tenor.com/view/bloom-into-you-yagate-kimi-ni-naru-yuri-kiss-gif-21637575
Have you watched YagaKimi?
which is a pretty big thing
I actually think I prefer it over Yuru Camp for the recent multiseries CGDCTs at this point
It really is, it's one of the better CGDCTs of recent years
but Shammy moves through her sentences quite quickly
It's not quite Tatami Galaxy levels
Just as a warning the anime requires some fast reading
https://tenor.com/view/angry-machikado-mazoku-raiva-yuko-yoshida-shamiko-gif-14580814
Shamiko's VA puts in absolute work
worth watching
It's very good
Wild <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Oh yeah, Fenny did you realise in the last ep ||Shammy really had been to that train station before, in the first season||
<:YuzuFailedSmug:827303707230076959>
Yep, but that's a continuation rather than a remake
Can't wait till we get a reboot of the Eva reboots
Right
Urusai Yatsura
There was another one too
I'd believe that the second one was hentai
Holy hell Shamiko is gay <:shamiBashful:692140408876171284>
||I wonder if she's going to gain the ability to use his power or something||
<:Comfyu:906964799785689118>
Very good
Fuck, this series needs at least another season
<:EulaThumbsUp:822194301849174016>
Always love this sort of imagery
<a:CryBabyGif:562737712428482571>
<a:karenEhh:567668661716910080>
Toei is actually that one amazing studio I usually don't think about
It has one of the best artstyles I've ever seen
Gotta get around to starting Mononoke at some point
Getting some Madoka vibes from that
You can watch it as a sequel to the series as long as you know the changes that were made in the recaps
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
How is Machikado not tagged as yuri
but that also makes it kinda amazing
It's a very ill fitting ED
Just because no one has any idea what the fuck is happening <:LuL:789259461470322728>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFrwvyHVHe8
This is my favourite song that can come up in CGDCTs rounds though
100%
yep
themes
Uzamaid has some uhhhhh
UzaMaid
There's some there that I wouldn't recommend <:ababa:789441747678920735>
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
Look at all those green dots
DW
Oh, I have more than 2-3 of those
sure
OK then
Shadows House is tagged as CGDCTs
I don't watch that much CGDCT <:Kapp:789259331072819241>
<:KaosSmileFang:444799827805601803>
CGDCTs rounds are always good too
<:Kapp:789259331072819241>
Actually let's just do these years
2020 or later
I'd post the family feud speedrun but I think there's some offensive stuff in there <:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
Boomer AMQ, "Is this Dragon Ball"
guess my 20 seasonals <:KokoDevil:874960932634243072>
Need zoomer AMQ
<:KohaneThis:508330108503719938>
https://tenor.com/view/kon-fun-things-are-fun-anime-cute-yui-gif-16787421
Mirai is cute
https://tenor.com/view/kyoukai-no-kanata-gif-21620988
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
and it's a throw away gag
It's actually one of the best animated idol sequences I've ever seen
<a:shamiPeeking:703628147102449684>
It has idols in it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t14NQJWyzLk
<@171395487247630336> You should watch this BTW
yes
Seems like something you would <:LuL:789259461470322728>
<@171395487247630336> were you watching this?
<:YuzuPeekCIT:520563054367211535>
but it seemed like a really poorly handled adaptation
I watched the first couple of eps
Yakunara Mug Cup Mo
Vivy overplayed its hand for me. Kept trying the exact same thing over and over to the point it lost its impact.
https://tenor.com/view/maou-anime-elf-eating-how-not-to-summon-a-demon-lord-gif-16543915
and it kinda just escalates from there
In the first ep the MC drives a golf ball through a moving train, hits a rake and ricochets it into the hole for a hole in one
~~Don't mess with the golf mafia~~
Thank god
It's so good
And Rakugo is in the "just watch it already" tier
Probably the top 5 I'd recommend generally
I think Millhi's seen a few of those but otherwise some are really obscure
OK, let me do a bit of a list
Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu
Kageki Shoujo!!
MARS RED
Heroine Tarumono!
Runway de Waratte
Sasameki Koto
Aoi Hana
Akane Sasu Shoujo
3D Kanojo: Real Girl
Egao no Daika
Maesetsu!
Koroshi Ai
MM!
I totally get the want to just like, ride your bike and not stop and just see how far you can go
<:Comfyu:906964799785689118>
Is good
Like, there's a real chance either way <:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
One I have no idea if other people here have watched is Honey and Clover
~~it gets gayer~~
Big same honestly

<:Blushyu:899069716356825128>
Something happened in the last ep of S1
Birdie Wing is just "what if Symphogear but golf?"
Yep
Committing to the full adaptation before they released the first ep was very nice. Something that's going to be super rare in general though.
I think the best recent adaptation was probably Fruits Basket
It's pretty good though
<:HibikiDab:688190074395164696>

And I'm still waiting for a cute girls playing cricket anime, I recon we could get through a game in a two cour season
~~I think it's also just that I have even less interest in skateboarding than in golfing~~
Nothing to do with the gay, I've enjoyed shows like Given before, it just really didn't work for some reason though <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
IDK, I watched ep 1 of Sklemniscate but it just wasn't doing it for me
Yeah, it makes perfect sense for a machine TL but I think any human would have caught that
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I didn't even catch that
<:Oof:918473238034649088>
The difference between Golden Kamuy and Overlord though is that Kamuy redeemed itself by animating the tiger in S3 perfectly where as Overlord just delved deeper and deeper into the shitfest.
my beloved
https://tenor.com/view/bear-black-bear-grizzly-bear-attack-golden-kamuy-gif-12092569
<:shamiPointAndLaugh:695364171524472862>
but I'll happily point and laugh
I'm not going to watch it because S3 was abysmal
Oh boy
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Pandemonium wasn't even the worst CGI I've seen
1:1 adaptation is almost always a bad idea because you're actively ignoring the differences between mediums. It only tends to work well for things that are basically written as plays already.
Ooooo, Fall has Golden Kamuy 4 and Mob Psycho 3
I have more faith in Luminous Witches to fulfil the minimum requirements of watchability honestly
no
There's more than Keijo!!!!!!!!
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aD5IUcuO4
I managed to find a random CGDCTs of questionable quality too
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
It kinda works
I love how shitty and unsatisfying the ending to WA2 is though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H7ArjiRY0s
And then there's... whatever this thing is
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
I love me some WA2
How sappy can we go?
It looks like the sort of thing I live off
calling something a dark horse means that you think it's going to be better than most people do
The dark horse is a racing term that refers to the horse that actually has winning odds but has been under evaluated
IDK
Is Prima Doll dark horse or does that have too much going for it?
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvu_s7Vp4KE
<@722121666641133608> This might be of interest to you BTW, not sure
~~madoka is better anyways~~
<:KyuContract_MM:406514222717992961>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I think I'd just nope out at the lack of masks
<a:shamiPeeking:703628147102449684>
I just want more
It's so good
such a nice and wholesome show
Shamiko needs another season so bad
<a:GanyuYummy:802333469547692143>
I see a Ganyu
There's a couple of cool historical romances too
but uh, I see Rakugo and I'm watching
The sound mixing on that PV though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um7Si6ZmeVE
Other than this, kinda interested in this
guess there's still time for more
RN the new anime in fall do look pretty weak to me though
pretty interested in that one
I assume Bocchi the Rock is going to be in fall too
oœâo
https://anilist.co/anime/124395/Uzakichan-wa-Asobitai-/
Also the most important one <:Kapp:789259331072819241>
That's some high quality of sequels
Wouldn't mind moving in closer though
It's nice that I'm only a 1hr train trip from the convention centre where all this stuff is held
How far would you have to go Ash?
No, it's Solo Leveling <:Kapp:789259331072819241>
Would have been better
and just use the first 1:10 of the song
Yeah, they just shouldn't have put the cut in the OP
That's the worst cut of this song I've ever heard though
Oh, this was the other song I thought it might be
Teppen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! was pretty fun
<a:shamiPeeking:703628147102449684>
Any link Millhi
Take me Out?

sure, why not?
So, we're getting cute girls doing government sponsored hitman things this season
It's been implied I think?
I did like the first ep though
<:ChrisKek:671983864163467265>
Yep, the manga only has three
Teppen just used 15 explanation marks as a gimmick to maybe get someone to watch
No, New Game! Is S1 and New Game!! Is S2
It's 15 explanation marks
Teppen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Still pretty cool though
Is it weird that Luminous Witches is the first anime I've ever watched that acknowledges the existence of New Zealand?
show should have just done what it wanted to
<:NoU:824762219078221824>
it was still good bait
and aquariums have a history
The first ep felt gayish
first ep was very good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMhJlbYNKas
Check out Lycoris Recoil
<a:kokosips:887033279683899392>
yeah, even after just one Ep I can already tell it's something you'd enjoy though
Also <@161155855524298752> if you haven't seen this this is one for you too
the first ep was very good though
you heard me
Cute girls do counter terrorism <a:KEK:740160662721921104>
<a:kokosips:887033279683899392>
yep
Agreed on Shikimori, disagree on Rikei ga Koi
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I still can't believe they made golf engaging
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
That'd be kinda cool
Is Engage Kiss just going to be an old school battle harem?
Battle leotards
should have just kept the show in the 90's
super fucking cursed
Homer's a millennial now
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
It has no idea what time period it even wants to be in at this point
Seen The Simpsons recently?
HS has been dead for over a year
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I posted screenshots
Check after dark
Vermeil in Gold
IDK how plants factor into that
at least endangered animals
*if you put that in raw numbers most of the endangered species are insects
but yeah, all three contributed
Most of it was underestimating how close many species were to extinction
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Why are there two shows with Illya style mana transfers this season
If you're going to do it just commit
<:heh:789431887135113241>
I like how Weathering With You dealt with this
I don't think the Day I Became God was ever going to work though
I'm more amazed it actually worked for Angel Beats
The big issue with Key is self destructing
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Honestly though, a Key show that manages to just be quite good at the start and doesn't throw itself off a cliff at the end is generally going to be fairly good
<:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
And I'll do it anyway
At this point the two I'd recommend are Call of the Night and Lycoris Recoil, gonna watch Prima Doll in a minute to see if that's worth it
<:shinoDoughnut:552984849145790464>
I'm down for this
yeah
If an anime doesn't have at least 1 jump-cut a second what's even the point?
This is actually just Monogatari <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Liden Films doing Shaft better than Shaft
OK, Call of the Night was barely even on my radar for this season, but this is easily the best first ep so far this year
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
Gamers was entirely caused by a lack of ability to talk to each other though
I kinda low key want someone to make a series with like, 8 characters with convoluted relationships all over the place, kinda like Gamers but not just "this could be sorted if we talked for two minutes"
One of the two guys is fine, and he just gets shafted <:heh:789431887135113241>
He's just a scumbag
I don't think that guy is meant to be a character you like or an insert though
~~there's always Love to Lie Angle~~
so...
then again, I watch any trash
<:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
Yeah, I'd watch that
hit me with all that shit
so like
I enjoyed DomexKano
<:YuzuFailedSmug:827303707230076959>
Yeah, Passione would never animate a yuri anime
so three months I guess
Ahhh, manga has one too
don't know how legit that one is
There's a show next season with a spoiled yuri tag too
I guess
https://anilist.co/anime/149028/Watashi-no-Yuri-wa-Oshigoto-desu/
This eventually
and sure
rework the entire ending
I mean
Too many problems with that one in general
<:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
I was planning to watch this anyway
||https://anilist.co/anime/137341/Uchi-no-Shishou-wa-Shippo-ga-Nai/||

Basically the anime wording anyways
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
As do I
same
yep
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
I've watched way too many anime basically

<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
Also Naisho no Hanashi
<@722121666641133608> I think you need to see this <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Change my mind
Irony is one of the greatest OPs ever
It really is
Hell, they even did the ED for Nisemonogatari
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
Can't take ClariS seriously since they did both Oreimo and Eromanga Sensei though
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
ClariS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxR_BYPG7v4
Also OP is good
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Just searched up what Lycoris actually is and now things make a lot more sense
Yes
that ep didn't air
so uhhh
It's just to do with very poor timing, Fire Force got delayed because of the KyoAni fire. Teppen had a joke about shooting the Prime Minister in it
It's a cute girl anime
No
When you watch an anime it instantly updates it for you
It went through that one Mario Party minigame
No, but like
Yeah, but WTF is America
We know very little about Australia
IDK
The scuffed state of the Strike Witches world has been known for a while
Luminous Witches
Actually it looks like Eastern Europe in general is kinda based off that map
It's based on the WWI map of the region
Hence the state of Poland
But this anime's set in WW2
IK
Also I have literally no idea what's going on around Croatia
ye, it's still weird that it even exists
but that's to be expected
And Eastern Europe is a mess
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
The really weird one is Baltiland
and Romagna is the rest of Italy
for some reason
Venezia is Venice
Oh, cool, we get a map of "almost Europe"
It's a non chronological show
<a:kokoshygif:888068371189493770>
A woman

The Trigger special
https://anilist.co/anime/136934/Mamahaha-no-Tsurego-ga-Moto-Kano-datta/
Ikuno is
Ichigo isn't the gay one unfortunately though
<:ichiSmug:446476345703268363>
https://tenor.com/view/zero-two-licked-ichigo-zero-two-ichigo-darling-in-the-franxx-strelizia-gif-15198567
because like
and Ichigo/02
Ikuno crushes on Ichigo, so that ship gets drawn a lot
yeah
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
A Place Further than the Universe
<a:kokosips:887033279683899392>
Second is where it goes from good to all time great
You left off right before the series has a huge quality jump
Poor Oikara, ||could have had a brother and a good home, instead got 3 years of psychological torture <:KokoPain:887832606278828102> ||

<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T7QV-kwLvY
https://tenor.com/view/hifumi-new-game-surprised-anime-gif-14311715
it's very dialogue and character focused and at least so far hasn't really had any action at all
If you want an honest answer though the anime doesn't really need to make individual scenes stand out that much due to the way how it's being structured. It's not really Symphogear and in a way its plot structure is actually much closer to something like New Game
IDK, just change artstyle or something
It's actually the only good part of NGNL
I've never minded hypersaturation <a:kokosips:887033279683899392>
It's not like dark scenes being lit up in false colour is even an uncommon thing in certain anime anyway. Just off the top of my head I know both Monogatari and Jojos have done so
The entire anime is meant to have a slightly surreal tone to it
Because I've seen plenty of people who follow animation quite closely like it
Are you sure you just don't like it?
I've heard a lot of people praise it though <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
You're honestly the first person I've heard criticise the way it looks
It looks fine
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
<:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
true, but also it's easier to get
Also I just want to point out that the quality of OPs this season is insanely high and this is still the clear best <a:kokosips:887033279683899392> 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rckYQnPW-wk
<:UmU:789443003289698314>
as any good Gatari inspired anime should be
No, but it is insanely horny
https://tenor.com/view/noragami-throws-self-garbage-trash-gif-6042438
Always have been a sucker for well done urban fantasy
but I think I'm enjoying Call of the Night just a little more
For me it's super close between Recoil and Call of the Night
yeah, they really are

I really like this though
That Recoil ep had so many cute moments
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
That clearly happened though
<a:shamiEEEEEE:708734921077686344>
It's great
otherwise the designs would take some getting used to
Sokka is perfect
I have no idea how to even feel about this
Interesting <:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
Also Araragi
Probably not
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
https://twitter.com/AIR_News01/status/1551152745486245894
Ahhhh, much better, thanks Japan
Really? Of all the recent anime, this one?
Really nice writing, it's kinda hard to explain though
Call of the Night is good though
Yep
Na, this one's good
and I love it
Yeah, it's a huge brain anime. It's like, the type of show where every detail was thought out and refined to an absurd degree
<:Yay:571106243360456705>
Also, I do just want to say ||that the Tatami Galaxy manipulating its own episode structure in its plot is one of the most satisfying twists ever||
legit one of the best I've ever seen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJUuiOptb2A
It's an amazing series though
Highest words per minute I've ever seen in an anime
<:heh:789431887135113241>
Want to watch Tatami Galaxy Ash
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
Tatami Galaxy was so good
God, I'm actually super hyped for that
Honestly one of the best scenes in animation
I doubt it
It's worth watching
Someone tell this account that there's other anime than just shounen tho
<:Comfyu:906964799785689118>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc3XkNPJpPg
This looks really nice
look at that character list
I was just getting that <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Damn
https://anilist.co/anime/20574/High-Score-Girl/characters
They were playing it in the ep too
yep
I know
ye
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_qtRmBlMvg
And the ED just goes way too hard
This show's hitting all the right vibes for me. It's a better Gatari like than BGS
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
Fking PS1
I actually think it's far better than just generic anime artstyles that most seasonals have <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
The CGI actually works completely fine
Actually now that I think about it they have a very similar concept in some ways, except the characters in HSG actually behave like humanbeings rather than drama maximisers
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
Also, unlike Gamers it's actually good
Na, legit, HSG has like 80/90 seconds of the OP having SF2 in frame somewhere
Oh, weird AF
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
the entire OP is streetfighter
trust me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw1TGGXRrbM
Nothing tops HSG
it's asa no inbou, not nasa no inbou
That's a mistranslation anyway
It's still a super weird throw away line though <:LuL:789259461470322728>
super weird ED and I love it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAiWiHWBZaY
Also the ED briefly mentions the death of John Lennon for some reason
<:GayImpact:953687266985926696>
It's very good when you do start though
no
it's good
Watch it
ye
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
I guess so
So in private is fine then?
Lycoris Recoil
I will forgive any plothole in exchange for cute bayonet moments <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
But I definitely feel pretty comfortable saying both are quite a bit better than XV now
S1 and G are still absurdly close to me
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
I think I've come around to S1 first
That Luminous Witches ep felt a lot better than all the other ones <a:Happy:448102279002718208>
<:Comfyu:906964799785689118>
There's something super nice about it
I really like DiY's artstyle
One of the few good things to ever come out of either England or the English language
I love Shakespeare though
Good top two
Nice
The Japanese month system really does make so much more sense

but it's also like
Oh yeah, Koyomimonogatari is by far the weakest season
I watched that yesterday
Heh
<a:kokosips:887033279683899392>
Yeah, what you have left is basically the best parts of Gatari IMO
I like Hanamonogatari quite a bit too
https://tenor.com/view/anime-dance-suruga-kanbaru-bakemonogatari-gif-15256869
What are you up to <:kirinohISee:450162656935018496>
and yeah, I like Kizu too but I always tend to prefer the end of well crafted character arcs and Kizu really doesn't hit that
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
And yes, I do really like second season
For me the top arcs are probably Nadeko Medusa, Sodachi Riddle, Sugura Demon, Hitagi End and Tsubasa Tiger
It's very good
You do
Yes
<:ChisatoXD:1018417316880457829>
Why is Fallout girl here
It also has a very explicit gay positive outlook, which is very nice
It's very good
But yeah, I can guarantee you'll enjoy it Lily
We did get a super wholesome gay scene, just not the one I expected

Finally finishing this
<a:kosaLeaving:562635803956609034>
oh, OK
It 100% can
Jumping from an initial weekly episode structure to a more indepth plot driven arc can be great when done right
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
yeah, not sure why they went in that direction
Man, Eva's merch really has gone way too far <:heh:789431887135113241>
https://tenor.com/view/shinobu-monogatari-kizumonogatari-gif-8565923
No, because this exists
<:KoyoTilt:489285273625034753>
All the best anime movies have unreasonably long delays
almost all good art is born of restrictions, that doesn't mean it's what the author would do with unlimited resources
Also, you can have restrictions and still be good
If it was intended there wouldn't be an entire movie that replaces those two eps <:LuL:789259461470322728>
<a:panic:589215632772431893>
Uhhhhh, this was not the finale I expected for a generally lighthearted ecchi romance
a few exceptional eps around that timeframe is exactly what you'd expect
A lack of time/budget management actually means that you put too many resources into some eps and not as many into others
overrated as hell
I mean, SxF is kinda meh

<@171395487247630336> New cute girl anime dropped
https://v.animethemes.moe/ShippoNa-ED1.webm
I really do think this is a death of the author case, but also it's not like his explanation is "wizards shat on the floor or in their pants then just used magic on it" at least, it makes sense you know?
I mean, I guess you can read her as bi if you really want, I don't think it would do any harm really. But in this case their vision was just to portray her as more confused about her sexuality than bi <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
The director addressed this
Who the hell thought this was a good idea?
<a:kokosips:887033279683899392>

<a:kokosips:887033279683899392>

Look how pure this shit is
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
I love this artstyle
DIY is good though
I just don't see this the same way as you. The reason why it felt edgy to me is real simple. It's built entirely on gore and death. I don't really care if something is doing this tongue in cheek, it just comes off as edgy crap to me whenever anything uses this as the main fundamental building block.
I mostly just found it intensely off-putting if I'm honest though
It just felt like Asuka again to me <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
joking about how edgy your being doesn't inherently make you not overly edgy
It felt overly edgy to me honestly
Don't think I'll continue on that
OK, I really didn't like Akiba Maid at all
Also they realise you can make a show for adults without just making it shit right? If that's their actual goal. Like, does Scooby Doo need this?

https://anilist.co/anime/145/Kareshi-Kanojo-no-Jijou/
If you like romance there's this too
It's worth a watch
Gunbuster is interesting, I wasn't super keen on it though
<a:kokosips:887033279683899392>
Wasn't expecting that
Guess I'm watching a Gundam this season then
it's just a really nice series so far too
We're one ep in and they're ||already fucking engaged.|| Where else do you expect it to go exactly?
or that
<a:kokosips:887033279683899392>
and I promise by the end of the ep you'll be onboard
just give ep one a shot
Not even joking
DIY and Gundam
Ash there's two anime you should watch soon, trust me on this
It's super cute and comfy
Just a good season for CGDCT
So was DIY though
This season is actually super good already though
Looked really nice
Ooooh going to watch this when I get back from the shops
but I do remember them being in Slow Loop
Not 100% sure
Oh right, this also happened <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Kinda wholesome <:Comfyu_GM:906964799785689118>
Damn, Bochi the Rock social anxiety is mood <:WhenLifeGetsAtPetra:687535393817624636>
Seriously who asked for this <:momoWhyAreYouLikeThis:692154033485643797>
She really looks like Chris sometimes
I was talking about both and people acting like the two things are the same
||I don't think she was really forced into the second engagement, she kinda threw herself at Suletta with the force of a thousand suns <:LuL:789259461470322728> , she could have just not said any of that and walked away||
But I don't think I've seen anyone outright deny it's yuri yet
I've seen a lot of ||"she's actually bisexual because she was (forcibly) engaged to a man"||
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
<:pat:534067375335800882>
I just love her already
Wait till it's actually just a trash ecchi anime and everyone's reading too deep into it
<:heh:789431887135113241>
It's probably referring to this
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS

I love her so much
Yua is so great
Yeah, I feel this sometimes
I really like Golden Kamuy's as well, but I wonder how much of that is just the series building up and playing off of super strong characters <:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
ye, Gundam's is vgood too
I got so sick of it before the end
<:4House:789439641484656650>
I never finished S1
If you're at all interesting in cute girl anime this season's absolutely fantastic though
not enough naked muscular men
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18q5wBrMYFg
OK, I guess that's how this is going to be from now then <a:Happy:448102279002718208>

<@145705908716961792> <@114081181611458563> Remember how we were talking about best OPs of the season a few days ago? I actually think it might be this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG-YY3zW4LQ
<:ShenheCope:919735205084954715>
and one day they'll actually release Mekakucity Reload
Lycoris sales are wack AF
Doesn't that just mean Ash loses?
no
nice
Shame the entire industry is just one giant dumpster fire
which sounds generic, but that's basically because every modern SoL traces back through K-On in some way
In K-On the band is generally just a vehicle for the club
K-On is barely even a music anime, that's not really the point of it
Also since Anilist is reminding me that Lycoris is CGDCT, yeah that one too
I think it's because I've seen so much though, it's really just a well executed Kirara anime, which makes it very good but like, I've seen so damn much Kirara anime now. I really don't see how it's better than other well executed Kirara anime like New Game or K-On, which it's somehow currently ranked higher than. It honestly just feels remarkably similar to them to me
It is just pure Iyashikei, not for everyone
like Akebi was something way out there compared to most I've seen
IDK, other cute girl anime this year have just felt more original and I think I appreciate that a lot
Maybe it's just also that I feel like I've seen most of the tropes in Bocchi before
To me a lot of what Bocchi has going on is just less interesting than Akebi or DIY <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
I don't think plot driven is a point against CGDCT. I'd point out New Game is very highly plot driven compared to most and is archetypical
Slightly heterodox opinion, but I'm not even sure it's a top three cute girl anime this year. I think DIY is legit better and also this year had a fair few really strong CGDCTs earlier on like Akebi-chan and Birdie Wing. It is good, but IDK, I don't think it's that good <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
Same.
Zard really has no reason to exist in OU
It's PU
Heavy Duty Boots are really nice for Zard, but you'd never use it over Moltres at current still
before megas were nuked
It was
He'd still have his role in Ubers if Gamefreak didn't randomly nuke megas <:sigh:230149462880813056>
Multiscale is insane
yes
And I don't think Lucario is anymore
I don't think Sirknight has ever been OU
Dracovish is ubers
I think it'll be fun either way
<:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
https://twitter.com/AniTrendz/status/1591008077347577857
Hype as hell
Someone wrote a strategy for Zard in OU. The reality is that if you actually want to use it you should probably just use Moltres instead, because you trade 10 speed to just be better at everything else
yeah, but it's PU
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
Yua's so cute
Truly peek CGDCT
yep
<:Comfyu_GM:906964799785689118>
I love it
To me Tsuki ga Kirei is probably the best of these for the final ep effecting the overall score

<:YuzuFailedSmug:827303707230076959>
Mine was Citrus
<:heh:789431887135113241>
Someone needs to make an anime about maths classes called High School D^2
This has been such a wildly good year for cute girl anime <a:Happy:448102279002718208>
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
I just use VLC because I can sync it with friends for group watches
Very cute

<:AkaneWaa:506164173617758219>
I miss Akane though
<:LuL:789259461470322728>
Well, that was an incredibly unnerving episode

This ecchi anime has more spoiler tags than Evangelion <:LuL:789259461470322728>
<:Chrismas:791756864295534613>
which is truly blessed
Also there's going to be more Magus' Bride
Yuri is my Job
and most of it isn't shounen
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
Yo, there's so much romance in spring of next year too
cool
seems like something you'd know
https://www.livechart.me/anime/11368
Is this one good Ash?
Could still be pretty good though, getting some Noragami vibes from it
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
This baited me for a second
<:taigaCHARGE:468021601951154187>
I'll probably do the Toradora Christmas rewatch this year
Actually, speaking of romance
It can (hopefully) start doing some of the really nice second character arcs
I feel like BGS is probably going to get quite a bit better from this point on since it's established its characters now
<:KaedeCute:517557223476690944>
OK, I actually love this keyvis
Which needs to be adapted
If we do get S2 we get the ring arc
<:YuzuFailedSmug:827303707230076959>
Citrus is pure gold
This is probably the best chance we have
I need it
S2 pls <:kokoOGpray:873438598182076438>
God, for a sec there I thought this was S2
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
It's OK to be wrong
<:kuroM:804191436601950219>
That's why Railgun is better
I just like CGDCTs
"dig up stupid"
https://tenor.com/view/kyokou-suiri-kotoko-iwanaga-spray-shut-up-angry-gif-16157045
That's actually pretty nice
Oh yeah, In/Spectre's getting another season
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
She has so much chaotic energy
Also, ||She touched a fucking jellyfish, that's just asking for trouble||
<a:CryBabyGif:562737712428482571>
No jokes though, that ep was great
No-one would misunderstand that right?
Could always just rename it to "Do it with your childhood friend"
<:Comfyu_GM:906964799785689118>
Show is so nice
DIY ||10 eps of buildup, very satisfying, teared up a bit||
Probably my favourite thing this season
<:Comfyu_GM:906964799785689118>
DiY is there
Plus I don't think it's ever really been their fault when their anime sucks, they've just started with some frankly terrible source material. Like, no-one was going to make Koroshi Ai any good short of a full rewrite
Kono Oto Tomare was amazing <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
Platinum Vision's honestly fine
<a:YuzuHype:827505533345857567>
Somehow its soundtrack is just more Sawano than other Sawano tracks <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Whenever I hear Sawano I think of Re:Creators
yep
blessed
<:Baka:573649152249036810>
||and they're teasing the tsun||
yeah
<:Comfyu_GM:906964799785689118>
Time for more cute girls building a treehouse
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
That's wank as fuck
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
These weird dialogue heavy urban fantasy anime are definitely some of my favourites to watch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfzsmLzyAVw
I'm ready for more dialogue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYO-bd6MEIQ
But I don't think that's the most popular opinion
For me, DiY
I've seen these jokes before, I watched Hitoribocchi no Marumaru Seikatsu
also the thing that isn't fine is that the jokes just aren't funny <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I don't see it as a huge issue, but I also don't think it's an example of anxiety handled well
It literally uses her anxiety as setup for simplistic jokes every single ep
I mean, I don't think it really does. It frequently plays it off as a joke.
They're honestly both pretty safe compared to some of the other CGDCT anime this year anyway <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
The unique animation is fine, but I just don't feel like there's that much substance there behind it for Bocchi
plus I just haven't found the actual plot to be that interesting, it's kinda like K-On but it can't stand without the gimmick and predictable jokes <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
and it's using tropes I prefer
I mean, I don't think DiY is crazy original or anything, I just generally prefer the execution overall
I wish I could retire at age 10
<:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
and I think that the slower pacing is a plus
It feels like I've seen pretty much everything there
IDK, just can't say Bocchi really does that much for me
it's super good
Plastic Memories is really worth finishing
DiY plays really heavily on the MC and her childhood friend's relationship in a super cute way
I don't really like Non Non anyways
Yes
<:Comfyu_GM:906964799785689118>
no-one dies and they build a treehouse
Just watch DiY instead
Probably my number two this season is Golden Kamuy though
I've found it fairly solid
Which I'd still prefer to watch over 90% of modern ~~isekai~~ anime
To be clear here I don't even dislike the show. It's just that I think that it gets a lot of praise above and beyond what it's really doing. Which is being a pretty bulk standard, well executed Kirara plot with formulaic comedy and interesting animation.
That's too cute
well, he could age
Without them it may not be #1, but it'd still probably be top 10
It's literally Botting, but who cares?
So like, I view shounen rankings with scepticism and generally assume they're worse than either site thinks they are
You can even work out entire trends where you disagree with these sites. I generally think every shounen is exceptionally overrated on both, but especially MAL
FMAB being #1 or #5 literally doesn't matter. Either way it shows that it's generally a well regarded show
The site is just a quick way to gauge what other people think about a show
It's not really an issue
...no shit?
Which is the site we were talking about
Anilist has it at like 5 I think
It's literally not
Honestly though I can't really see Bocchi as anything more than Gabriel Dropout. I have about as much understanding as to why either of those got as popular as they did <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
4 of the top 10 are from the last 2 years
Too be fair Anilist does have a massive recency bias
I do still find it being rated higher than K-On completely baffeling
And that's because it was Odd Taxi
It's really rare for well rated shows to continue to increase, the only recent example I can think of that did was Odd Taxi
Not really. It's just a statistics thing. As more people watch any show it tends towards the mean somewhat
It's normally only mid and low rated shows that see a post air bump
AoT final as an example is actually 2 points lower than when it finished airing
It's more common for very highly rated shows to drop after they air rather than increase.
~~also give us Yaga Kimi 2 cowards~~
It's a good time <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Apparently we're up to 7 upcoming yuri anime now
Nice
The quality gap between 1 and 10 on any list like this, or even 1 and 100 is probably just going to be personal preference
So it really doesn't matter
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
<@171395487247630336> This might interest you
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
Actually getting some Chihayafuru vibes from the trailer
Sure, why not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSWR6mCAgMc
Cute Girls Doing Judo?
Next season actually looks fairly interesting
I'm down
Josei romance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzyN6jakA3Q
Oh hey
That's a new one
Wow, they combo'd the OP straight into the ED at the end of the ep
yep
Wait, I've seen this one before <:LuL:789259461470322728>
<:Comfyu_GM:906964799785689118>
Guess I'll finish off my favourite cute girl anime of the season
Akiba just did not work for me at all
If we're counting all anime I'd go with Golden Kamuy honestly, otherwise I think it's G-Witch <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
Honestly, same
You sure about that?
It was great until the shouting at disabled girls arc
yeah, that makes sense
Interesting
Huh, they're sticking with Venus Line
I'll probably watch it when it actually airs
I didn't know it had aired tho
I'm planning to watch
It is tagged as yuri
I didn't even get through the first cour
I do think it's the best anime from this year <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
Some states, but it's completely unenforced everywhere other than freeways
There's like, three countries on earth where this is a crime and China isn't one of them <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
He's really good at this <:Comfyu_GM:906964799785689118>
That's a really good move
Oh, they got the VA for Yakumo
They do have a super cute relationship though <:TakinaAwww:1020773964823416913>
I'm enjoying it quite a bit though
https://anilist.co/anime/137341/Uchi-no-Shishou-wa-Shippo-ga-Nai/
but <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
Show has a LBGTQ+ themes tag, which is normally a sign that something actually happens
at least at this point
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
||It's all bait though||
<a:kokosips:887033279683899392>
<@171395487247630336> you watching this?
I need to watch Don Glees
Scores for the things I've actually finished
To me it's just pretty clearly Lycoris and then anime like Witch and Akebi just below
<:HanePleading:672566871119233085>
Monogatari Off Season
It's 10 pin, the name is Turkeyüé≥
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Damn, was about to tag Ash with the bowling anime
RoKs is just one of the most generic shounen OPs I've ever heard
Like, I don't like some of the other OPs but can understand why they're popular
The one I really don't get is Ranking of Kings
I also rank Akebi's OP quite highly
But I don't even think it's there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG-YY3zW4LQ
This is my actual OP of the year
I think out of everything on there I'd probably go for Call of the Night?
That's fair I guess then
Oh, it's OPs
Lyco Reco losing to SpyxFamily is pain
I think G-Witch and Lycoris Recoil are the two biggest yuri anime I've seen since I started watching seasonals
Yuri has been conquering the world for the last 6 months
I mean, that one's fair
It looks kinda good though?
<:heh:789431887135113241>
<:KaosAbababa:452439689383903233>
Other people my age are going places and doing things and I'm just sitting here in this box
It's actually quite impressive
How the hell does Renai Flops actually pull off the harem ecchi romcom to tragic romdrama transition <:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
but IDK, I'd prefer a very good song with slightly weaker visuals
The visuals are far weaker than the song
My list at current
When I'm done with AMQ I'll make one up
Honestly I'd put G-Witch at current up there too
LycoReco
I thought it was just fine
My shit take is that Bocchi is actually a B rank anime
<:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
Everyone has their shit takes
<:Kanba7:309618672895262721>
Actually giving DiY respect
I expected this to be worse
Just need that Yaga Kimi announcement and it'd be perfect <a:KohaneTap:499296526460518401>
If it's quality like Recoil was it could do something similar
MagiRevo definitely seems like a dark horse.
<a:BarbaraJam:964209219349921842>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAC2kBMAhbw
This anime has an insanely good OP and ED though
So far this is enjoyable even if it's literally just Hamefura
But like, I've gotta get around to that
I'd probably enjoy Banana Fish
Which is a good while back
Last Mappa show I got much from was Yuri on Ice
IDK, it's just been a very long time since I've felt like Mappa's put out anything of noteworthy value
~~mappa is what people say JC Staff is, fite me~~
Having said that keeping things away from mappa tends to improve their quality
I remember it was a meme level amount of work
What did mappa even do again?
Although having said that it probably just would have been written differently, so <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
I feel like for Sarazanmai specifically a longer runtime wouldn't have helped it
üêß ü•Å
<@87512939107450880> server watchthrough of Penguindrum?
But also, all of his works are like, 8 at lowest
I do think it's probably the weakest of Ikuhara's works, at least that I've seen
Sarazanmai was still absolutely fantastic though
I'd have to go back and look at the ep, but I'm guessing ep 16 was very well done
Yeah, not surprised
Which I don't mind, way more shows should take influence from Penguindrum
There's a lot of influence from Penguindrum too
Yeah, there's more than a few Ikuhara influences across Starlight, I think this sort of meta analysis of one's own source was a very Ikuhara thing to do
I like trying my hand at readings but I'm not always the best at them <:ababa:789441747678920735>
Am I off base here Millhi?
But for Yuri relationships rather than stage girls
He's kinda like the giraffe from starlight
I should rewatch yurikuma though
I'm going from memory over a year back here, so I may be a little off but the series is in no small part a statement on the idealization of Yuri within the Yuri anime/manga space. I think the judge is representing the audience approving or disapproving of the show based on whether or not the relationship they see appeals to them. Could be wrong here, it's a weird show you can make a lot of readings of
Shabadadoo
Sexy
<:NadekoFries:591296872094892035>
Hana Kana villains are my favourite
My love heptagon anime of choice is Kano mo Kano
At all
Gamers didn't work for me
Yosuga no Sora is art written by a madman
Just because has been on my PTW forever
Just no fucking ghost Banri
Cut the second half of the last ep
Same change I'd have made to Oreimo
Golden Time could have been one of the best romances ever
For me it's like, Tsuki ga Kirei>Toradora>Fruits Basket
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
The best romance anime is Tsuki ga Kirei but it really has nothing on Oreimo in terms of raw enjoyability
Oreimo is peak romance, like it's the best worst romance anime
If you ever rewatch it just keep in mind that it's about the sarin gas attacks and how the country dealt with them, that's basically where all the symbolism goes back to
https://tenor.com/view/kirino-kousaka-oreimo-stare-staring-huh-gif-7514075
https://tenor.com/view/karen-araragi-monogatari-monogatari-series-dekkosun-toothbrush-gif-14605642
Man, imagine stopping there
It's certainly not for everyone
I don't take offence to people not liking something I did
And yes, the OPs are great
Penguindrum is one of my favourite anime
Really should get around to Utena
Just own it honestly <:LuL:789259461470322728>
For me this year AotY is pretty easy. I don't think anything else is really even close to LycoReco
and to explain the seiyuu, depends on how much screen time matters. The best seiyuu for a single scene was Akira Ishida in My Master has no Tail doing his Rakugo BS, but he's not an important character at all. He literally has one standout scene and it's amazing. Otherwise I'd probably default to Inori Minase hard carrying Heroine's Run the Show.
For me
Best OP: Call of the Night: Daten
Best ED: I'm the Villainess: Nomick
Best Sequel: Golden Kamuy 4
Best Boy: Fudou Aikawa: Koi wa Sekai
Best Girl: Chisato Nishikigi: Lycoris Recoil
Best Villain: Toshizou Hijikata: Golden Kamuy 4
Biggest Surprise: Lycoris Recoil
Best Scene: Akebi Chan: Performance scene
Anime of the Year: Lycoris Recoil
I love this OP
https://youtu.be/Jer-_oRfLyg
OP2 is better
And that's why I became the strongest samurai transported to another world and reborn as a squirrel 2.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I think more isekai LN adaptations with paragraph long titles should have forced title drops
BNPA
So far this season's off to a good start. MagiRevo was great and I love Annis's pure chaos energy. Tomo Chan and Koori Zokusei are both super comfy <:comf:789441906018222080>
Tomo Chan is pretty nice too
<:nadeLove:486352799114985484>
MagiRevo, I already love her
10/10
It has trains
I guess I'll give it a shot
It's kinda like if the creator of OreImo came out hard against incest. People would understandably have their doubts <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Fenny's commenting on the disconnect between the statement and the product that ended up being made. Regardless of what the author has stated the product can be read as an endorsement.
If I was Sony I'd want to stay as far away from GS as possible. It has huge potential to explode in their face
I will just stand by the stance of "everything about Goblin Slayer sucks and is Sus as hell"
<:ShenheCope:919735205084954715>
Citrus S2 would be great if real tho, because not only would it be moving into the legit good arcs but it'd mean there's still some hope for Yaga Kimi
<a:YuzuHype:827505533345857567>
<:ShenheCope:919735205084954715>
so maybe they'll actually be willing to do something
To be fair though, yuri anime's been kinda killing it recently
I rate it
which is yuri if you took a hit of acid first
Oh yeah, there's also Fragtime
Yeah, Birdie Wing is actually really gay generally
Which I haven't watched but I'm pretty sure is not trash
There's also the ancient yuri, Onii-sama e
Otherside Picnic was fairly good
There's a few
Also Strawberry Panic, Sweet Blue Flowers, Whispered Words
<:YuzuFailedSmug:827303707230076959>
Citrus
Yaga Kimi
she does tho
https://tenor.com/view/netsuzou-trap-gif-18994584
based on that anime I'm guessing whatever they're saying is not
IDK, I just thought it looked cute

~~but what if you're rooting for best girl to hook up with her sister~~
I love Yuri Kuma but it is super weird
I can't even remember but the whole show is insane
https://tenor.com/view/kanojo-ntr-gif-22774649
Kano mo Kano was better
Rent a GF was one of the worst anime I've ever watched
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Good Artists copy, Great artists steal
-Lankpants
Which is weird because normally I just pick some weird crap
and I don't even think that's super contentious
I have it as the best anime of last year personally
very
yes
and watch Lycoris Recoil already <a:ChisatoBonk:1052302585777897513>
Kase San is just really nice and it's just one hour long
second this
Because I know Lily likes Gear and Revue Starlight and PriPri/Lycoris Recoil are very similar
PriPri good too

I'm down for this one
Yeah
I really like the MC design though
fking unexpected one too
OK, Sugar Apple Fairy Tail won the JC Staff animation roulette
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
Time to see if JC Staff is doing good or bad
A1 just makes every anime ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M68ndaZSKa8
Good to see Nagatoro didn't get any less horny <:LuL:789259461470322728>
I mean, shaft literally only because of 15 gatari series but W/E
My most watched were Shaft and KyoAni last I checked <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
The one they're doing this season is top tier too
Yes
It's like, an actual trend
Every time JC Staff makes a romance anime it's fucking amazing
But yeah, A1 is a super inconsistent studio. But most big studios are. It's not like JC is any more consistent <:LuL:789259461470322728>
<:kirinoSip:450342875142684672>
And if you're very lucky you get OreImo
But I think I'd still recommend like, any language learning resource
One of the better ones from what I've heard though is this weirdly enough
https://anilist.co/anime/99468/Karakai-Jouzu-no-Takagisan/
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7v3T5pDj-M
This is one hell of a unique OP
https://tenor.com/view/lycoris-recoil-takina-chisato-gif-26174117
very enjoyable
Yeah, so far Ippon is the best thing I've seen out of this season
Hopefully it doesn't get bogged down again
The PV had some Chihayafuru vibes
But this was already very on my radar
I'm waiting for my friend who I watch with to be online
Nice
Nier <:Kapp:789259331072819241>
So far I think Mou Ippon, Sugar Apple and MagiRevo have been the most interesting
It's nice that not everything is on one day this season too
Anilist
Been enjoying a lot of stuff this season

Crunch yourself to death <:EmiThumbsUp:610128808061829140>
New Game is a very good CGDCT anime, but there's actually a huge disconnect with the setting that makes the upbeat stuff feel kinda dark
Can't wait for New Game!!!
Yeah, they should have just added !s
It is
He's just Norville
Valkyrie Drive Mermaid
Yunna and the Haunted Hotsprings is great too
<a:kokosips:887033279683899392>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AU0mHZFX0fA
Isekai Maou if you haven't seen it
What kind of trash?
Why did two anime with genderswapping air today?
I mean, it is but he does also have other character traits <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
I just don't really like the art style though
I think they're all OK other than Shaggy
fair
That might actually be the direction you're looking for
Have you seen Mahouka Circles?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckit8sN4VEs
This is everything you need to know
Do not do that
Considering it makes DxD look conservative <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Apparently not Valk Drive
~~Yosuga no Sora~~
It certainly does. It just tends to not be fun

Ooooo, Tsugumomo is good trash
but also better
There's way worse trash than what I'm recommending
I'm kinda going mid trash here
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
Ueno-san wa Bukiyou is a thing
One Room is that deep down the rabbit hole trash
I know what MM! is
This?
Did mention it
which one?
Have you seen Manyuu Hikken Chou though?
<a:shamiQuake:691751384390828092>
Kandegawa Jet Girls
They actually did make a moeblob anime about S&M and I find that amazing
MM!
I love it
It's so bad though
It's pretty fun
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsTERSk_BZo
This one was written by an AI trying to comprehend human emotion
Kano mo Kano good too
Now that's the good shit
Would you even fall in love with a pervert as long as it's a cutie?
Wait, I've got it
https://tenor.com/view/no-senpai-this-is-our-fight-strike-the-blood-gif-24348633
Chisato is my gay queen though. I love her
<:DogChisato:1050796502852845698>
I really need to make that a 2 part
<:chrisDelete:616150739701596169>
Henkei Shoujo is one of the weirdest things Japan has produced
No, it's better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQnOYZ_Glt8
<:nadeLewd:568002320810639370>
I think some of my Nadeko emotes are actually this character <:KEK:1024468566835204137> 
https://anilist.co/character/131858/Kitanaga
It has the second most Monogatari characters out of any anime I've ever seen
<:Sakana:1016650006662496326>
Honestly, I actually kinda prefer the way the anime did this one
Magical Revolution
I'm glad that the series is actually just being open about Anis being gay as hell though

So much stuff this season and I can't be bothered with it
I ended up just dropping Bofuri honestly
Nana being in Nagatoro still gets me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLgfFwAHb3I
Urusai Yatsura really does have a great OST
It's mostly to do with hair
Here's OreGairu
<:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
Still gonna watch it tho
I was staring at this for like 30 seconds wondering what OreGairu had to do with anything
Why do these two just look so like the fucking OreGairu girls?
Like, what the fuck?
I struggle so much to understand why they didn't include Scooby Doo though
And they complained about it every other time too
Right wingers think it's woke because it has an Asian character and a black character.
Oh god who chose this colour?
It just feels super lib humour to me. Like, these are the jokes I expect from late night news comedy hacks.
Shaggy was never exactly peak traditional masculinity
I mean, no, that one's correct
Those comments are the worst thing I've seen today though
https://tenor.com/view/lycoris-recoil-lycoris-recoil-takina-yuri-takina-gif-26227535
It's so bad
they've also done quite a lot on Madoka too
ClariS just always does Shaft anime <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
The other really big noteworthy one would be Nisekoi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yXTWRW6P4c
ClariS did a lot of work on Gatari
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHN2mdIwB8M
yes
<:sigh:230149462880813056>
No-one else knows what it is whenever it comes up in AMQ
big same
<:nobully:535544772660559883>
and Oreimo
<:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
so far it's been fine at least for me
<:KohaneThumbs:502432020354433024>
Honestly the blessed cat made it worth watching rather than just a generic trash ecchi anime I drag myself through
The cat ||cursed the MC to live as a female so he wouldn't have relations with the purple haired girl, which didn't really seem to work||
animation is just whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SilkptdYBAE
Kinda rate this one from a song perspective too
But uhhh, the best OP is OniMai and it's not even close
in which case I'll just drop
It might just fall into the trap of being pure wish fulfilment
I'm not sure on Angel Next Door
<a:sagiriJudge:448156131152625676>
I've seen worse
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
It's kinda wholesome
I've also been enjoying OniMai

MagiRevo is one of my faves this season for sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRXOzT4eN4U
https://anilist.co/anime/126529/Kyokou-Suiri-Season-2/
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
Yuuki Yuki was a good character too. Enjoying this season of In/Spectre a lot so far. It's a lot better when it doesn't spend 8 eps hyperfocusing on one thing
She's really good for the role though. Anime that's just dialogue the whole time <:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
true but I want to think it is <a:kokosips:887033279683899392>
...was this choice of VAs just a pun?
Get in the robot
It appeals to me greatly as a huge fan of slap bass

not even close
no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYaWMsqH8Sg
Man, the bass in this OP slaps
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
Listened to so much Chilli Pepers that I never had that issue
20 seconds in <:LuL:789259461470322728>
Oh
Time to watch
<:KaosSmileFang:444799827805601803>
No-one saw the issue with this?
Attack on Titan the Final Season Part 3 Part 1.
Not the gayest anime this season, but still kinda gay
Still be one of the worst romances I've ever seen <:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
<:YuzuPeace:827525271422107678>
They got together earlier than half way in Citus
oh, and the Lupin III movie
There's a lot of really solid CGI anime
Land of the Lustrous, High Score Girl, Godzilla SP (anime wasn't great, but the CGI was), Beastars, Shinigami Bocchan
could have done a lot more but it never really felt like it wanted to
It's just a comfy average anime
can we get a version of that where the quality gets worse each series, because it really has.
Neither were good though
I got more out of Uzaki than Tonikawa <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
~~im more interested in knowing how much the plugsuits cost~~
~~Kyousogiga~~
<:sagiriComfy:451196601705299980>
"Hey, I know a show about a cute brother and sister relationship"
https://anilist.co/anime/132532/Deaimon/
This too, I watched the first two eps and need to watch the rest so I can't hard confirm what it's like but it seemed pretty wholesome
Tamako Market would be solid
I can't remember tho
I don't think it's that sus
maybe Tamako Market?
similar in a lot of ways but also relies on the father being adult mangaka
<:monaderpy:854593417585491988>
actually maybe not
uh
Kakushigoto
Streaming together as V-tubers is honestly the gayest thing girls can do anyway
Anis has a good understanding of personal space
Couldn't tell you much about Mushoku Tensei tho, I can't imagine a less interesting anime
Apparently
<:ChisatoAh:996051061653639288>
I love it
Yoooo
this shit got way more effort than it really deserved <:LuL:789259461470322728>
<:YuzuPonder:827525271367319572>
Kinda wild that of everything airing this season OniMai arguably looks the best of any anime
Quite impressive
Nier literally threw itself out of the gate and face planted into a river filled with bad CGI crocodiles
It's just an aniplex show, so kinda
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Oh no, I was actually enjoying this one
https://twitter.com/ayakashi_anime/status/1617326251303206914
Promare really didn't do much for me. It was really missing any character or story beats for me to care about. So like, it's a Trigger work <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Also Pine Jam's use of and understanding of music is really, really good
https://twitter.com/kubosan_anime/status/1617809434331283456?s=46&t=sB9Uk_gnCB6heNglko1RBg
Not Aniplex this time, but this one also sucks
The good news is that R&M still functions equally as well without a creative lead.
Which is a good series
There's also Your Lie in April
Not sure
It does that gut punch thing like 4-5 times in 13 EPs and they all hit really fucking hard
End have you seen Violet Evergarden?
<a:Happy:448102279002718208>
Enjoying this a lot
Anis and Euphie are so fucking cute
just because of delays?
That's fair
Actually though the ones this season are way fucking better than normal
They're an important part of my shitty anime junk food diet <:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
just a nice, cute piece of extra fluff and I'll take that
<:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
I'd be more mad about it if not for the explicit yuri we're getting right now
<:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
That's honestly a degree more removed than anime normally goes for
I'm enjoying it. MC is pretty fun and their relationship with the other girl is really cute
<:yurucomfy:422498798703476737>
Mahiro has good taste
easy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh0PT4hcaSw
Also best OP of the season
honestly all three of the genderbend anime this season are better than Fantasy Knockout <:LuL:789259461470322728>
This season has far better options
yeah
MC seems to really enjoy being a girl honestly. Just likes looking cute. I can respect that
<:KaosBless:444565473665875990>
Hidamari Sketch, Yuru Yuri and K-On
God, the more I look at these the more I love Mahiro's taste
then again, I really tend to go in pretty hard on cutesy romance shows
<:KokoShrug:863724218826096650>
I've been enjoying it quite a bit
yep, I kinda like that about it
it's weird
Onimai is actually good though
No, ||10 seconds left in a round||
Insane cliffhanger
God damn where this week's ep of Mau Ippon ended should be illegal
Oh, that's kinda interesting
Damn, Ayakashi Triangle is moving a lot faster than I expected <:Hehe:588813278705221663>

https://tenor.com/view/wallace-grommit-wallace-and-grommit-star-wars-sheev-gif-13920387
Oh, that's actually pretty hype
Wow, OniMai has a lot of Guilty Gear in it this week
She's fine
<a:kokosips:887033279683899392>
I'm just here for Anis being Anis honestly
not making significant cuts is like, the number one trap for shitty adaptations
But uhhh, anime has to cut things out compared to text media
<a:YuzuGayPanic:827361568756858890>
she's incredibly powerful
She's easily my favourite character this season
I'm holding onto hope that the mod in the ChisaTaki server is right
There's the tweet
https://twitter.com/lycoris_recoil/status/1624369212251844608
<a:ChisaTakiPat:1071362979255304202>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1BmA_2Zj-k
And the video
it was 100% the most posted about show of its season here
Honestly LycoReco was just about as popular when it was airing
<@260489748869677067> Time to watch so you can watch whatever this is when it airs <a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
<:ChisatakiPray2:1041721086036955286>

That cover is fire though
I really wouldn't even agree that the protagonists of Dynazenon end up feeling human. They rarely if ever act like humans. Alexis even has more human motivation than they do and they can't even compare to Akane in that regard.
For me Dynazenon just really failed to produce any noteworthy character arcs, it felt like the first few eps of Gridman, which were the weakest of the series stretched out over an entire season.

Gridman is 100% the Akane show, but it works out because that meant that they actually had to create characters with depth overall. The antagonists especially from Dynazenon aren't even really characters, they don't do anything other than oppose and their motivations are literally hand waved away. Dynazenon's character writing wasn't just weak, at points it was completely non-existent.

God I love her
I'm sure if whatever drug that was existed it would be very popular too
Onimai's been pretty fun so far
She's still the goddess of chaos <:LuL:789259461470322728>

I really hope we get more Call of the Night though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKaNsZUXpgI
Based youtube recommendations <a:KanbaHappyAnim:556265280268009482>
it took me almost as long to find G-Witch as everything else on the list
same
<:Hehe:588813278705221663>
Who'd rate an anime that highly because of one ~~vampire~~ girl?
and it's one of my favourite movies
it's just walking
takes like 2 and a half minutes before there's even dialogue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQBMJLLujqc
never did watch that
ahhh
That was last year?
Oh fuck I missed Yuru Camp
so that's probably a point against me <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
I have an ecchi anime listed as good

It's last year
I'll throw mine together
<@453836798796234762> can you link the tier maker?
I'm actually just watching to see how hot the dumpster burns at this point
I feel like the "final" season has just been crap
I really dislike AoT at this point
Not as good as Lycoris/G-Witch/Call of the Night though
Uhhh, it was probably in great tier overall. One of the better shows last year
How did I not have Executioner on mine <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Like 60 or so eps
And yeah, it's long
It's way better than most anime.
Honestly, you actually should. It's like, the best western cartoon hands down.
I mean, she's probably above average within her genre
She is?
I never said there aren't good singers, I said the pop genre, and especially modern pop is insanely saturated by low talent but marketable artists. Is that even contentious? Pop is all about having a brand, not actual music.
I've heard the song, I don't think she's a bad singer, but I actually don't like it
<:nadeJoy:486347839882919956>

Nintendo games always have such good music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjFG4U2dSUE
Actually feels like Chillis used too <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
It's more that so many of them are just songs that I associate more heavily with the band than the album, probably because they're before my time and they were already songs I knew before I listened to more of their stuff
I just forget a whole lot of these songs are on it <:LuL:789259461470322728>
actually, looking back over the song list I probably gave Blood Sugar Sex Magik less credit than it deserves. It's also definitely in the top albums
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjFG4U2dSUE
This is good too though
They did make a couple of legit amazing songs with him, but they never quite managed to find their mark it feels like
I am pretty disappointed that they never really managed to get that one really good album out with Klinghoffer though
I think Otherside is the only one of those that's particularly popular
I like Parallel Universe, Otherside, Get on Top and Quixoticelixer from the B-side, but the rest of it is pretty meh
It does have good songs on it, but a lot of the most popular I feel just aren't that good
To me Californication felt a little over-produced
just personal taste
I'm more a fan of Mother's Milk, By the Way and Stadium Arcadium.
but I really like the layers
Not sure if it'd be everyone's taste
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIABpVRDb-I
<@331908049822547978> you know how I was saying this album is very good. This is like, exactly what I wanted from a new Chilli's album. Probably my favourite since Stadium Arcadium <a:Happy:448102279002718208>
that makes its inclusion on the album make a lot more sense
Oh, I didn't realise They're Red Hot was a Robert Johnson song
Like, Breaking the Girl, Under the Bridge, Give it Away and Suck my Kiss remained relevant for so long that I was still hearing them get randomly played in high school <:LuL:789259461470322728>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b1wt3-zpzQ
This song will always have one of my favourite intros ever
Pretty nice
<@331908049822547978> apparently RHCP are releasing another album this year

yep

God, I forgot this video and just burst out laughing when I saw the start

~~also they have not aged gracefully~~
I kinda like it, has some of the same energy as some of their very early stuff
