Especially since the active crew is like, thirty people
<@284390402210136064> mods just can't deal with all the people that's really the issue
(Seriously, these people gate their community behind an application form)
In fact they might be more strict than we are, heh
I'd honestly say Kamen Rider is a solid bet
Yeah
It might have a bit of baggage that we don't want
Yeah I looked at Twintails at first and I certainly did not think of it as...the most mature show in the world.
Well, except for the Akira cult
I mean the anime community has always had maturity issues
Yeah, it's not exactly like Gear in the fact that while Gear doesn't go out of its way to highlight the lewd stuff, Twintails actually ends up going for it quite hard
Ah found their Discord thing
https://www.reddit.com/r/KamenRider/comments/8s66fi/meta_discord_and_link_flairs/
Yeah, same
I'm really not sure they have a discord  though
They also like PreCure so
Yeah, r/KamenRider really likes us. I got suggested Symphogear by them
(Seriously those guys over there love us)
Partner with Kamen Rider :P
inb4 r/lovelive partnership
ah yes. Terraria.
It might make Shirabe‚Äôs quote engine better
Sample:
On a smaller friend‚Äôs server we have a channel specifically called ‚Äúout of context hell‚Äù where we post quotes, formatted in a very bot-friendly manner
Oh XD
I mean there's GGO Alt. but that's very well recieved so
We should be pretty safe, honestly
Looking at 3HZ's anime...
Granted EVERY community's full of them, but step into the wrong community and we'll be stepping into a pit filled to the brim with them
Anime community's full of them
Edgy kids, drama queens
Basically
We call them squeakers if we're playing video games
You know them
No I mean like
Yes I am looking *right at those eight year olds*
The thing is this place tends to be pretty mature (I say that as Marooned and I were just spamming Gear pics at each other in <#407060923078017026>) and I know that a lot of anime fans tend to not be very mature
Again it's not the worst idea in the world
That's a small issue. Rider is moderately aware of Gear's existence
This could be a good move
Let alone a Discord
I'm not sure the KR community even knows of a Symphogear subreddit's existence, tbh
I think the KR discord is smaller than ours, though, so thankfully if anything it's us eating them
Though it still might happen if we aren't careful enough, it could happen across fandoms
If it's a Rider discord and a Rider discord one has a much higher risk of eating the other
True, that only happens in like discords with duplicate fandoms
You know
Oh, take all their activity
Granted I don't think KR will be the one to eat us
Mortal Engines-style
Straight up
The big issue is if one community gets eaten by another
~~how many euro users though~~
Which *scares me*
Especially since Saki and Latooni are pretty much almost always active
We have a really good mod saturation in this chat

Good work on adapting the ch1 battle scene to a literary medium, by the way. Other than the "battle start" text (which helped me imagine all participants involve get ready decently well, so not even that much of a nitpick) it felt like a proper fight, not like a janky and weird "video game forcefully shoved into words" thing.
I'm realy hoping I can read this without any prior knowledge of Stella Glow...

At first I was like "ehhhh" and then I realized that, well
It's like the same impression I had with Crocodile Sclash Driver form
Though honestly at first when I saw mikugear I was like "it's meh" and then a season later I look at it again and I'm like "why did I think that looked bad? It looks awesome"
It looks so good that for a spiritual spin-off rider for a forum RP I'm doing with a friendo, my character's first berserk form will have a similar clamping visor
Really? I think it looks good
Shenshoujing just looks GREAT as a villain form
Ok I'll admit I'm weak for Mikugear

Where instead of letting the character *be* they made the character do
It felt like a bad fanfiction
I felt like he was forcing it
Like his actor (who is DanTheMan himself in every sense of the form) was forcing the character out instead of letting himself BE DAN KUROTO
In the OOO episodes Dan felt too forced
Kuroto Dan felt more Kuroto in the .5 episodes than in the actual episodes
yeah the .5s are just canon shitposts
stol'n me-em
wait there is
Is there a shitpost channel
They did the Zi-O .5s
Thank you

You're totally right honestly
We can roughly estimate that the first day stretches from the Big Bang to when the earth formed into a ball of hot magma
He must have been going at close to lightspeed
Millions of years were a "day"
If we roughly calculate it out, God was suffering from some massive time dilation
or in some places, friday
Yes but is that day saturday or sunday
Except none of us agree when that day was
"lol I just created a universe? Time to take a break"
Yeah day7 he was just like
God I love wasabi soy sauce
are they just bad at consuming wasabi
but what does it saaaaayyyyyyyy
I can't believe this artist managed to call out Main so well

This spree of Carol bullying is great
<@!231025503643893770> OTS is that one night AR which can self-buff her damage by like 110% right
That was more proof that at the end the rich guy couldn‚Äôt bring himself to give
Somehow stayed perfectly in context in contemporary periods
Yeah but with how we interpret it in modern day it gets better
King: "I just did lol"
Pope said "wait you can't do that"
King of England was sick of the Catholics stepping all over his territory so he just said "screw you, making my own church"
And it was also a power play
Anglican is just the "hey can I copy your homework" meme
And then there was the Anglican Church fiasco
It was just about playing the politics game
Honestly most of catholic history wasn't even really about religion
for about 500 years or so
Well, guess that's what you get when your main teachers of scripture were illiterate as hell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1N5lZw7e78
And Catholics edited the holy book
I think in Revelations there was something about "DONT EDIT THE HOLY BOOK"

By comparison, Yoko Littner (Gurren Lagan) would‚Äôve scored like an 82 or something
<@!102691114762371072> don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs like my ranking for how Maria is my ‚Äúleast liked‚Äù Gear user. She scored the lowest, but in a test where the lowest didn‚Äôt get below like a 95/100 does it even matter

That too yeah
It could honestly be another world with Symphogears
(A man can hope)
Probably gonna end up as the best of them all
And given just the intro theme alone this season‚Äôs music is going to be amazing
God I‚Äôd still watch a spinoff or a Toei-style sequel
Real talk though, do you think it‚Äôs going to be the end of Symphogear as a franchise
God damn that theme is going to be the best one of them all
They‚Äôre just some randos that are gonna get in the way
CDs!
SSJMiku
if it was directed by a certain toei we'd also only get one season of Symphogear that's like 80 episodes long though
If this was directed by a certain Toei that would definitely be a scene
that made me physically groan in pain

Quite the opposite
That‚Äôs not saying animation is dumb or easy
Or CGI
The other 2/5 is all smoke and mirrors
About like 3/5 of it is actual raw art skill
Animation is fun honestly
Hence why the glorious Quality Symphogear‚Ñ¢ exists
They just straight up described the animation industry in a nutshell in that show
<@!263983345669505025> ‚ÄúYou know, as an artist you really wish you could always put out quality. But the deadlines matter more, and sometimes you just have to live with not doing your best.‚Äù - Re:Creators
It sounds like our crew‚Äôs gonna go out and make someone catch some hands
I remember someone saying that Synchrogazer sounded quite heavy for a magical girl show and that comes to mind for Metanoia
It doesn‚Äôt sound all techno and ‚ÄúLETS DO THE THING‚Äù
I like it tbh
It feels really heavy for Symphogear
***OH SHIT***
Oh shit.
The weakness of a god
GodMiku: ***GAY SWEATING***
‚ÄúMikuuuuu I need you to cook for me, I‚Äôm hungry‚Äù
Honestly? I can see her saying that
Oh shit so it‚Äôs probably gonna become a Madoka-Homura situation where Hibiki drags Miku back down to earth or some shit from being a god
Tsubasa wants a sword
this has been an anime theory
Clearly she's taking testosterone
It's just shifted up a few keys
<@155150213445582850> It's actually the very beginning of the song
Hibiki: Death by Miku snu-snu
Miku stop you turbo lesbian
you can write the kanji for "fish" and it'll swim away
It's so raw
Strong Kirika energy
Wait, that‚Äôs not a good thing is it
We can even have depression scenes with them chugging Shirley temples!
Assuming 1 is base, 2 is Chris‚Äôs apartment, 3 is school
<@155150213445582850> that makes Adapter Hangout Spot #4 then
They‚Äôd have at least 1 Ogawa episode
I wish it had the runtime of a Shonen
Its time to mute this channel until I finish AXZ lol
And I can't believe every screenshot they did for the XV PV was from episode motherfucking ONE
Hibiki's underwater mode is absurd too
He could clean up after others but not himself
CUSTODIAN BOI
Also CUSTODIAN CORPSE
All Loves Blazing is so good
Hibiki's first song though
Kinda felt like the wacky Ultraman finish took a little off the Symphogear edge but then the big explosion happened and shut me up
I love it
The entire episode 1 was so good

And then they *ACTUALLY DID IT*
I swear to god I imagined this as a transformation sequence before
WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK
WHAT THE *FUCK*
IT HAS NO REASON TO BE THAT GOOD
WHY
https://youtu.be/8DCSbFd_Ie0?t=165
but the best part
It's a broken relic (that they have)
also wait, what if the Antikythera Gear is Miku's future Gear
Hibiki's still adorable and I love how the teacher was smart enough to dodge the fuck out of the way
And yet it exists.
no right to be so god damn good
the transformation sequence
Yaaaaay
XV maria arc when
Why doesn't she have an attack named Hail Mary
Serenade is such a cool attack and I'm sad they don't just have her HAIL MARY'ing that thing
Here's hoping next episode she gets like 5 action shots of her blasting Serenades at people
Even Elfnein got more action shots
Everyone else got more action shots than she did
Maria, you're trying. I'm sorry
<a:elfneinCheer:536680597888827432>
She's doing it!
Elfnein's helping!
Elfnein: "HEY GUYS LEMME RECONFIGURE YOUR SHIELDS"
<@!99695384296701952> Yeah I loved the whole
The next season of Symphogear is here. Melua, you can‚Äôt stop the crack theories anymore.
Choir teacher is FINE
Also does this mean
It starts off feeling not so Hibiki, and then the beat picks up and it just goes whaaaaaaaaAAAAAA
<@!102691114762371072> it‚Äôs such a great song
Symphogear: Kick reason to the curb and not give a fuck
god
with Symphogear content
mod Grimm Eclipse
I mean
what is english
(RWBY Grimm Eclipse mod for Symphogear when)
wait...
Hey that's just like Symphogear!
sort of like that one touhou game featuring Sakuya on steam
pixel graphics
side scroller
Symphogear Hack 'n Slash
screw you, transformation sequences are bonus cd content.
it ends up being like mikugear
that's her transformation
That's it for her
Kanade just walks out and gets a flash of light and then her super suit is on
<@!246146781832806401> I want a slo-mo sequence where she swings around on her spear and her legs and feets armor get equipped
TOEEEEEEEEIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Once again I point at Toei.
sadly you can only do so many punches and kicks
Really? I feel like Maria ends up with the short end
They probably blew at least a third of their budget making them perfect
Given how sequences seem to all be of the same quality every season, probably not
Yuki Yuna's pretty good too
Symphogear has honestly by far had my favorite transformation sequences
Virgin Final Form Zi-O https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7bJQDYFrPU
Chad Base Form Symphogear https://youtu.be/8DCSbFd_Ie0?t=165
Oh dear
<@!99695384296701952> It's clthulu <a:KappaS:393780906013491200>
I do not want to deal with Chris players spamming Megadeth Party into Billion Maiden into Giga Zeppelin into Queen's Inferno
thank
if Chris's character is basically this I wish for <@431656503490117632>
(better video)
do not want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whMKfGbMstM
please don't make Chris into Peacock from Skullgirls
Can one of you lads/lasses slap the song down as a DL here
They did well with the chorus
God her first song is so good
Technowizaed
You
<@!102691114762371072> how the fuck do you have both
She has the energy weapon
He went straight for Maria in the 1v6
Still a physical weapon
The moment you start pulling wacky pseudomagic out is the moment the man‚Äôs fucked
She was still a physical fighter
Well, keyword base form
<@266379640069685252> he 1v1‚Äôed base form Fine and kicked her ass
His anime figurines were given to him by a custodian
Genjuro ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok because I got extra warm underpants‚Äù Kazanari
So if you have a mean falsetto you can use one too
They just said ‚Äúyoung girls tend to have the vocal ranges needed‚Äù
No
It‚Äôs meant to boost your sync capabilities
THATS RACIST
Wait NO
Unless you‚Äôre the same color as your drug
Also Kanade‚Äôs Linker ran out
Otherwise she‚Äôd have stolen the show
Also Kanade kinda needed to die
It‚Äôs probably the latter reason
I mean it could always end up being used like Little Miracle
It feels a bit like Miku‚Äôs B side in G
Oh man I love Bikki‚Äôs B side
Hey just look at Kamen Rider Ghost-oh wait he dies like three times.
Just like toku and all other anime
But yeah I agree Symphogear started as a passion project
Every anime or toku series inevitably needs money
With Tomosato aka hot drink girl
Both together
Rip ninja bro
And Ogawa
<@189146272865845248> you heard me
Genjuro is Thanos
Chaotic evil
Ver was definitely evil
They had a Nephilim
Lydian is just ‚ÄúBikki gets kicked by an angry lesbian until her friends pick her back up with music‚Äù
For Apple
‚ÄúThen Maria puts on her new super suit‚Äù
It was mostly ‚ÄúBikki steals Maria‚Äôs Gear‚Äù
Which is straightforward and simple
I mean there‚Äôs also the Lydian song
But yeah shit climax
Its meant to be a weird thing out of place
Clearly as no one called him out on it, Adam‚Äôs pp smolÔøº
She google searched the sky and determined where to 1v1 god
WAIT HE LOOKS LIKE CUSTODIAN BRO FROM THE INTRO
The most overpowered man in existence therefore is him
Confirmed, the most overpowered villain we will ever see is a phantom thief
Current list of overpowered weapons in Symphogear:
-hat
-cape
WBX
It‚Äôs Shotaro‚Äôs hat!
<@239893407122718721> while Adam marches behind him dooting a trumpet
Fine nudes <:FuuConcern:589545407726616576>
Chris nudes
Hibiki nudes <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Kanade nudes <:BasaSmug:497598144083787796>
No, she had to be absolutely bonkers
Definitely
Fine makes pp soft
For both
Same
I am big boi
No ara ara for me
I-I‚Äôm not into Fine though
TRIGGER STUDIOS I AM LOOKING RIGHT AT YOU
Unlike most anime where they‚Äôll take an entire minute to ogle over fanservice and titties
Yeah but that‚Äôs hardly pointing out fanservice though
Sword boobs when
She was covered by a blanket though
The most that happened was in Season 1 where Hibiki was like ‚Äúhuh so that happened.‚Äù
The wackiest part of Symphogear is that it‚Äôs so full of fan service yet none of the characters call it out or freak out about characters basically being in spandex that shows everything
Wait lag fuck.
Hidari Memoria
*puts on mask*
I REJECT MY HUMANITY, JOJOOOOOOOOO
*inhale*
Because
They needed to go and eat people
<@239893407122718721> because the Autoscorers have no memories of their own
God if that happens I‚Äôm just going to be in shock
Carol 5 billion IQ
All part of her master plaaaaan
Elfnein is not human
Remember kids
This dumb and I love it
Elfnein just pulls out the Genius Fullbottle
Then Be The One starts playing
Carol goes off to genocide against the custodians
That is the weirdest analogy
If you spend your time squishing every ant you‚Äôll never get to enjoy your hot dog
Picked up Ver as a consolation prize
Because she had to show up to grab the scroll thingy
https://youtu.be/7oisHhf-dH4
‚ÄúTwenty three stab wounds.‚Äù
ITS TIME TO STRANGLE KANEKO AND ASK HIM WHAT THE MEANING OF THIS IS
They don‚Äôt do these things for no reason
On the other hand *but what does it MEAAAAAAN*
On one hand I love Ayahi‚Äôs EDs
I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about this
<:bikkiThink:536679571458621455>
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>
Chris VA
It‚Äôs still Ayahi right
Didn‚Äôt listen closely to the ED sadly
Yeah
Its <:TimeToStop:356564209217044480>
I need to stop
***FISTS IN LESBIAN***
Instead of LETS BE LOUD AS FUUUUUUUUCK YEAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
It‚Äôs more...controlled?
But it‚Äôs also got something else mixed in
It‚Äôs very Hibiki
It is
Inb4 takedowns
Shit man
Dicks, wrong chat
It‚Äôs the tough decision Miku asked Hibiki to decide on
It‚Äôs time for Hibiki to fist Miku
Oh dear
Her sequence changes depending on what she's wielding once she hops out
Oh my god
dog points
150
You owe me um
If that happens
That's my bet
And then her crossbows appear
and then cross them over her chest
then point down with not one but TWO finger guns
feet apart
you know what she's gonna do
<@216181207874928640> nonono
I have such a massive love/hate relationship with this emote
<a:verspin:393584985652592650> <a:verspin:393584985652592650> <a:verspin:393584985652592650> <a:verspin:393584985652592650> <a:verspin:393584985652592650>
<a:verspin:393584985652592650>
Sword.
she's gonna pull a heavy bolter out from hammerspace and kill us all in a single shot
Melua wants to slaughter us all
As we watch everyone pair off and Chris become a solo artist
<@185949743321579520> Finally Symphogear can be the idol show it deserves to be
So I wouldn't say it's "one eyed"
<@185949743321579520> I mean IMO Gear always ends up as a solid B tier anime
What's the current season lineup
I haven't been following
To <#336297387863703552>
It also has a funny backstory actually
FMAB > FMA standard
It is a good trade
<@216181207874928640> why we talkin about a Hawaiian king <a:KappaS:393780906013491200>
Unfortunately I am of the male gender and asian race so therefore my hairstyles are limited to "military man" or "shit tier anime"
If only I could have a tenth of such majesty
The secret to Kanade's power: Her glorious hair
Kanade is a fuckin fireball
Even though Hibiki is best girl and Miku makes the best wife
<@486087033652248576> look, I'm not gonna lie
And her stance changes based on thta
Except she picks and chooses what she wants to use
Sort of
Or Megadeath Quartet
So her sequence changes if she's gonna use Artemis Rebellion or Giga Zeppelin
Symphogear
Symphogear AXZ
Symphogear G
Symphogear GX
Symphogear XV
Probably
gz
10/10
<@!81815015224516608> ITS FINLAND TO ME
fug
o noe :-DDDDDDD
Finland Saga
Change V to F
More like "near-sighted as fuck"
Especially not against the first encounter
despite my best attempts to not be
girls call me cute all the time
idunno man
I don't know why they play this song during SOL
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr0GtCIXPvA
they aren't gonna play fucking Wind Direction in a SOL scene
<@440138597539119114> This isn't Yuki Yuna
BEEF
STROGANOFF
This is Symphogear and action-packed singing is what they do
If this was any other anime, this question would be easy
That is true
Sample: M1918 BAR and M1918 BAR mod
Aoi yuuki is 100% capable
Ah, the ol' Tony Starkaroo
Lodged way too deep for even tiny robot arms to extract
Non-ferrous materials
<:Think:357022192556572672>
Like say
Yeah only the shittily drawn thinks are the mockery ones
it's a gooooooooooooooof
that requires too much setup
so I gave up and accepted the fact
...never mind I'm going to stop spoiling myself
wait what
lived well and prospered
rip XV
They just don't have the time to point out the fact that *yes Chris has big tits* for the 30th time
I think that's a benefit of Gear being 1-cour
No one pointed out the lewdness of the situation
Even when Hibiki in S1 was covered in a *questionable sticky substance* emitted by those pole noise
That's honestly one of the reasons why I like Symphogear
You get facefuls of tits but no one goes "OH MY GOD TITTIES."
They don't go out of the way to point it out
to be fair Symphogear handles its ecchi really well
yeah that's some Magical Girl Site shit
Symphogear is the story of a bunch of girls being superheroes but reality says no
Madoka is like a weird distorted children's show with its pastel and everything
Honestly, the blood and gore does make Symphogear its own thing
As circlejerky as that sounds
just a random person who probably came to the wrong neighborhood
looks like a rando
Episode 2, hole-in-chest
XV: Episode 1, the Gears almost fucking *lose and die*
ITS ONLY EPISODE FUCKING TWO
Jesus christ I clicked on the wrong channel and this is crazier than season 1's jam
SHE'S GONE MANKAI FUCK
YUUNA
its

[image loading]
we YuYuYu now bois
hold on

YUUNA?
waitwaitwaitwait
KIRIKA V-CINEMAS
KIRIKA MAIN CHARACTER
Has Tsubasa's voice gotten deeper?
Or Chris knows Bikki so well that she knows exactly how to strike her to where she won't block
That's what makes it blessed
So much as it's "not agaiiiiiiin"
See, this time it's not so much "I'm sad you rejected me"

blessed image
That's not a bad thing though.
And reusing frames
Animation is 60% raw art talent, 40% smoke and mirrors
Yes, for the fact they can draw but also for the fact they can give the illusion of motion
I respect animators
Honestly
bless Chris's snow queen heart
Shrine's still canon. Lovely.

go away big titty priestess
There's still lots of punching shit but it focuses more on life than fighting
<@!246678192360783872> it's very slice of lifey
TaHiYu sounds great too
HiTaYu
I like the sound of that name actually
<@486087033652248576> does this mean that she has been preparing her anus for the last few hundred years just to use her ultimate form
this has been your daily blursed post
do bigger buttplugs mean more powerful forms
to change forms she inserts different buttplugs
And then you pointed out the buttplugs
<@!99695384296701952> See I liked the fact her suitcase was the weapon
thanks jii
Shirabe: "Act sane for once!" *hops in with Kirika anyways*
homete
g41
catgirl detected
FUCK
Sonic.
Thunder.
<@486087033652248576> Kick.
KIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK!
Rider
That satisfying *VRRRRM*
When Shirabe used Axel Style (the buzzsaw ballerina twirl)
That sound design
Also
Yet another blessed pose
BRAVO
Okay why did we focus on Kirika pole dancing so much when her scythe turned into a jet engine
I DONT GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THE HOLY CORPSE
To be fair her ability is combat buttplug
it's only episode 2 chill out on the maximum gay
Every frame of this is worth screenshotting
We don't know
Truly this is the gayest season
the little details
https://youtu.be/wQKYHsZd_yg?t=346
<@284390402210136064> will a timestamp do
PERFECT!
so it's a variant Gizagizagiri
I'm pretty sure this was Gizagizagiri Full Throttle right?

a *normal attack*
Are they seriously pulling off Gizagizagiri Full Throttle's unison as just
Wait
She sort of kites around until she's got you trapped
Perfectly fits how Shirabe fights
Beta: Massive Circle Slash is also a really awesome skill
Also, trap card.
already by the first like three bars
I like Shirabe's first song more than Kirika's
she fucked up
in this moment, Kiri knew
shirabe for hug not fug
üöì üöì üöì üöì üöì

WHAT THE FUCK
AGEMATSU AND KANEKO
she actually inserts them into her butt to use them
oh my god they're actually combat buttplugs
(shut up Carol, you were groping yourself)
<:carolScared:536680569749372969>
the silly thought of said alchemist anal training
look shitty
Because otherwise the objects 3d with the characters rotoscoped just
They sneak in the 3d CGI when Tsubasa and Maria are super zoomed out
One of the best ways you can do that is to sync the framerate of the 3d with the framerate of the 2d
yeah
Way too much brainpower
Those camera angles are awful to do without rotoscoping guides
I'm not gonna blame them for doing it
Yeah
it's Japan
Rotoscoping makes those so much easier
You can't do those crazy 360deg camera spins with normal frame by frame drawing
Of course, true stretch/squash fluidity is fucking impossible to do
It's a great job, but it's still slightly derp
It feels ever so slightly choppy due to rotoscoping
You can actually see that in Kaguya-Sama's ED
Rotoscoping sort of boxes you in
You need the ability to stretch and squash things
Honestly I don't think they'd want to rotoscope it
*shudder*
It reminds me of the old Zwei Wing outfits.
<@!193408538909868033> Yeah, I'm looking at it...
Despite how batshit they can be
None of the fights feel rotoscoped
That's impressive
That's how you tell it's rotoscoped
No frame blurring, no stretch/squash
I find it interesting that concert scenes are the only times I can actually detect rotoscoping
that's the sword being the dom in the relationship
oh yeah there we go
[Hazard On!]
Hibiki I'm putting on the super suit
<@163409869813186560> Hi, my name is Miku Kohinata
Hang on so when did Maria become the one taking charge over Tsubasa
GIVE IT TO MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
THE ARM THING
WHAT IS
(yeah you all expected me to flip shit didn't you)
This is going to be a good season

yes she does
Also MY GOD WHAT A GREAT SCENE.
I like that ability.
Instead of giving your blood the succ, she gives your rapidly declining mental state the succ
It's her "vampirism"
<@440138597539119114> It fed off of Tsubasa's fear I think
Classic movie serial killer ability
Fear feeding
That's one hell of an ability too
Little girl does not get to be punch girl.
Now Tsubasa's the one losing her cool
They've gotten so good at this
<:OK:500692128058572800>
that one frame of absolute fury from Tsubasa
I already like her
Otherwise I wouldn't have made one of my D&D villains a massive prick like she is
I'm such a fan of showboaty villains
oh god I already love the vampire girl
(Well, recital scene)
wait, she did get one
Hibiki can finally get a concert scene
It's all smoke and mirrors
yeah it does
And then they immediately started rotoscoping again
(they also look like MMD models)
But the framerate for the two changes
Super hard to spot due to how small they are though
That's 3d
yeah see thta
by eating away at Tsubasa's mind
So it's made to induce basically a slow insanity
Oh god dammit, is it a keyword
Ah, so it could also be a spying device
I feel like she had more reason than just "let's ruin some blue girl's day"
Was it because she needed power?
The question is why kill the entire stadium
Satisfying, even
Her villain power is...*good*
I like vampire girl so much more than wolfgirl now
Lasting Song is great
Suffer until you make it, kids!
yes
<@279341087494242304> more suffering
ITS HAPPENINGGGGGG
THE BRACER
GAUNTLET
Shit's fucked.
No one was gifted power
This time, no one got to be Hibiki
Even Genjuro's having his PTSD
and this is good
This is Symphogear
but whatever, this isn't Meta's Backstory Hour
I blame it on the environment I was brought up in
I'm quite a bit colder than *mooost* people would expect
Why isn't Symphogear praised more for its art and animation
every minor detail was just perfect
they've done so well this season already
200 even
take 100 dollars
Please
Where can I donate to the art team
God damn holy shit
But until then, damn those facial expressions are just on point
This is that same feeling
As a dungeon master, I laugh not because I'm beating the shit out of my players, but because I know one day they'll stand up and beat the shit out of my creations
(no, even in S1 I just sat back and was like "this is good.")
But no new heroes are created either
This time, no sacrifices are made
hell yeah
So it's time for some crazyshit‚Ñ¢ to happen
So does Miku
It's time for Micchy to save his ass
Kouta gonna get kidnapped by the Custodians
We can always talk about some spacegod bullshit with the Custodians
Let's cross over Gaim
We each design a villain for them to beat the shit out of
The only OC we use is the enemy and our villains
<@174440042289168384> So we have no OC
one is a guide for Girls Frontline and another is D&D
I've got two writing projects on my plate rn
rider KIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/431914167826382860/599993664537624610/unknown.png
<@486087033652248576> Kirika's catching on
Hey we should write one
ikr
Gimme more Rider Kicks so I can lord it over my Kamen Rider friends that Symphogear is Kamen Rider but more chad in every way
We've already performed a Rider Kick this season and a drill punch
To be fair we are inches away from performing a Rocket Drill Limit Break
<@486087033652248576> Friendship PUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNCH
Seishuu, Switch On!

I like the sound of this
I like the sound of this
I think that's Miku
Miku floating in the cosmos
AS WE ALL KNOW-
Hibiki reaching for a purple light
<@486087033652248576> hype
Her legal dad not biological dad
Like, the stuff Fudou and her dad wears
Tsubasa in the ED is dressed in the Kazanari Family's clothing
Also interestingly
She is the üöì
üöì
They went as far as they could with that
To this point Hibiki remains the best transformation and theme
<@185949743321579520> to be fair
Oh nvm
That‚Äôs like
Other anime also goes out of its way to point out its ecchi fanservice
See the thing is
This time no Hibiki survives
Since when has Chris‚Äôs transformations not been subtly lewd
It‚Äôs also impressive as a stand-alone
<a:verspin:393584985652592650>
Maria for half the transformation is twerking
Kirika: haha poledance
Hibiki: PUUUUUUUUUUNCH
NOT WRONG
<@596125578348724224> honestly
Which I don‚Äôt think was rotoscoped/CGI‚Äôed either
<@!99695384296701952> three frame Miku jiggle
The only time a character felt something was lewd, was when Hibiki accidentally looked at a fucking Playboy magazine
Yeah no one comments on any fanservice at all
Yeah no one in the show comments on the fact anyone‚Äôs in fucking spandex
YEAH VERY FAR AWAY
Just the most awful English
Season 2
Gay shit once every like theee sentences
And ARMOR PURGEEEEER
Fine.
Tsubasa‚Äôs angry naked shower scenes
If you did that you‚Äôve been dealing with Chris titty
<@210253622192111618> she definitely did
~~same~~
kirito and his 5 egirl harem
<a:KappaS:393780906013491200>
Imagine SAO leads to me being a real gamer
I fucking wish
imagine porn leads to sexual violence
(and legal age in Japan)
being happy for people whose costumes are primarily blue is *illegal*
Not allowed to be happy
Thus is the fate of the blue magical girl/rider
out of PTSD
She's going to stab fudou
she's the blue screen of DESS
she's dead
She's blue
Sorry, this is one of those topics that annoy the hell out of me
Or tracing TOR.
Go fight actual pedophilia if you're so concerned about it! Oh wait, that's hard and requires learning how to trace people's IPs on 4chan's /b/ board somehow.
DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATH
Because if you do you realize it's the same argument as "D&D makes people satanists"
You just don't get reason
Honestly most of these kinds of arguments
~~waiting for the day mine wakes up~~
<@!182890099183190018> I think utsuho reiuji smells better than that
OLD SPICE DEODERANT
adam smells like piss and old spice
now I need to shut up and do my warframe weeklies
yes
I'M ROBOVER
"I sorta hate elfnein"
*You've lost karma!*
MORE MIKU SONGS
That's what he is
He's an old-style imperialist
He's basically a pre-WWII nutjob
<@210253622192111618> Not gonna change the fact he's way too power hungry
You underestimate Fudou's power
She's probably gonna become Lady Kazanari if only to burn down Fudou's bullshit
Most people live their lives never reconsidering their own thoughts
go live your life
Hibiki was really good for her plans
It's likely alchemy was created after her time
Heck if you stick a fragment of a Symphogear in a person, that fragment can become a new Gear
yes
Ah
We're not sure
<<< *has been accused of being a pedo just because I prefer my girls on the low end of 5ft*
My gf may be on the, err, petite end of the spectrum but she has adult proportions (and for that matter, acts more mature than I do)
Yeah, I think Fine has literally been nearly chopped in *half* before
Like how Carol lost because she forgot Ver doesn't give a fuck
Every villain in Symphogear fails because some crazy factor comes in
Unfortunately she didn't actually think they'd be able to X-Drive
She hoped (and correctly calculated) that without a miracle, the Gears would lose
<@210253622192111618> She knew she was creating weapons that could stop her
Very few times will you be proactively attacking the villains
you're always reacting to the villain
That's the problem with being a hero
Yeah but Fine pushed her plans far too quickly at the tipping point for them to respond effectively
Chris running missions:
>fails to capture Hibiki once (BasaZesshou)
>fails to cap Durandal (BY THE POWER OF ECKSUCALIBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA)
>fails to cap Hibiki *again* (Hibiki can actually fight now)
Yeah, if she skipped Ryoko she wouldn't get the chance to use Hibiki
Before in the Zwei Wing concert he was thin
You''d be right
Because this isn't Genjuro's story, this is the story of a fluffy hamster who puts on her super suit to punch things
We just never got Genjuro's own training montage
It's implied something happened between then and now
Post-timeskip he's the giant hunk of muscle we know and love
Pre-timeskip he's normal man
The Zwei Wing Timeskip
I mean I guess he has one
Genjuro has no character arcs
Behind every great character is an incredibly flat background character who exists for memes
Genjuro's feats of strength do not include drilling through an entire space battleship
Heck, I think the intro of AXZ shows that when the Gears are actively singing and powering themselves up, they might be stronger than him
I don't think Gen is stronger than even Ignite
Yeah, he could only hold Noise back by punching rocks at them
the man who makes no sense
In typical Genjuro style
"I GOT EXTRA WARM UNDERPANTS"
Hell, the one time it was "cold outside" Genjuro just said
<@468591607332208641> agree
That stupid combat regen ability
They completely forgot about one of Kirito's most OP abilities
Not only that
<@!99695384296701952> I was gonna say Overlord but then I realized Ainz/Momonga could've easily lost against Shalltear
He's Genjuro. He's stupid strong but not absurdly
He's not Kuuga with the power to end the world in a single Rider Kick
Even Genjuro's bullshit has likely limits
and reinforced steel structures
What's he gonna do, throw her through fifty feet of bedrock
He was underground
Still gotten the whip through the gut
He still only has physical damage
Genjuro is stupid strong but he's still just human
And still regenerated
or that happy at least
now lemme go and finish this sortie
In a source of media, not everyone needs development
modern art is straighter than miku
So it was actually her subconscious talking
She was half conscious too
miku probably has one of the gayest yandere songs in the entire cast
<@!137113218173632512> ‚ÄúSento suffers‚Äù
Tsubasa's overworking herself so everyone hops in too
with all the girls
we need another training montage
Though she strikes me more as a "track and field" kind of person
Kirika sometimes too
The bench press room, aka the land specifically reserved for Hibiki, Maria, and Genjuro
Hibiki isn't spotting
<@!193408538909868033> picture's wrong
Didn't have bikes so he just rammed a horse into someone's houes
My god so he's literally just Tsubasa's ancestor with that horse stunt
Gym class with Hibiki was never the same
on that day
<:basa:536679626047619084>
who likely ran horses into people and watched the horse explode
The ancient sword man
#LetBikkiBeTheFitGirlMoe
ancient sword man
TSUBASA BECOMES POSSESSED BY SUSANOO
Hibiki's butt is modern art
zettai ryouki
damn right
<#407060923078017026>
Names literally as "Sculpture in Color"
The name, as all shitty modern art pieces are, is a name so abstract that it sounds pretentious as fuck
She'll immediately start mental collapsing because it's so disgusting
when you can just drop this in front of Tsubasa
who needs to kill a little girl
it looks like a bunch of rotten cheese curds stuck together
<@476058996315389953> "modern art"
still straighter than miku

<@239527945142534145> imagine having a mindset so casual
her back is probably buff as hell too
Those rabbit ears are heavy as fuck
Likely yeah
clearly watching bruce lee > actual ninja training
the most impressive part of that is how she managed to hit the correct afterimage
what if fit loli
fit anime girls give some people life
I wonder if being in SONG fulfills their requirement for athletics school credit
she's the perfect height for headpats
also remember that hibiki is like 5ft tall
where many have that power
and yet here we are with symphogear
it should be illegal for someone to have so much good girl power
we need more shots of Miku being fit
absolute airhead
I have great grades in school and everything
Don't look at the fact that, you know
My gf and I joke that's basically our relationship
the one time Hibiki actually used brain was when she just punched shit into Noise
train stuuunt
Yeah, even Hibiki can
<@476058996315389953> I just went by likely IQ
<@210253622192111618> Chris > Basa > Shirabe >Maria > Kirika(?) > Hibiki
no Red Hot Blaze but close enough
Probably like the smartest Gear in the crew
she's really smart
https://youtu.be/BD-Uc6JaTFc?t=56 thanks Amazons for explaining how suck it is
This isn't partyland anymore
Kicked it right into Sento
Really kicks it into you how tough it is
Yeah that was so good
Seeing as how most of us have never had that sort of training before, you'd have to go for Route B aka "I have some sort of death wish"
We'd all like to entertain ourselves as the hero but in reality, if you can get past even the hurdle of "I might die" I'll be impressed
*Black Hazard! Yabei!*
The fact killing people is a hard thing to stomach
Even then that's a main theme in the darker bits of Rider
Makes it easier on you yeah
You sort of have to get past the "I'll likely kill someone at some point" barrier
Ryuki
fuck, man
idunno
If you're joining something like, say...
And luckily you're the Symphogears -- your job is to fight mindless creatures
Yeah
At the very least, the concept of dying needs to be something you don't care about
You have to be a special kind of person
I think most of us would piss ourselves in the face of Noise
When it comes down to it
<@486087033652248576> We'd all say that but
and Bikki was like "SIGN ME THE FUCK UP"
hourly pay wasn't even on the menu
yeah
This is a career choice money can't simply convince you to take
Yeah I doubt any of them are in it mainly for money
<@486087033652248576> That's what Kiri does probably
<@216181207874928640> Something tells me most of them aren't in it for the money
Which I find slightly too absurd since it's likely Hibiki's saving most of it due to "I don't know what to do"
Hibiki says she spends hers on food
Well, it's said the checks fund Tsubasa's motorcycle-annihilation addiction
Therefore the paychecks exist
Chris bought the shrine...and the shrine exists in canon
It was in an OVA about what the Gears do with their paychecks
<@239527945142534145> They do
He is mister ninja man
the one that detected sounds
like the octopus noise
<@185949743321579520> Pray their vision is based on movement
Little girl knew she was not the chosen one
Hibiki just stood there
Little girl was running and trying to hide
Also there is a slight difference between little girl dying and Hibiki getting the stabber
~~I mean discord is easy to cheese, just have emote servers~~
Komi-san
you will one day have 100 servers in your list
wow get into more servers lol
the melon cult
the squad
Everyone needs a server they share with *the bois* or *the grills*
On the private server I share with *the bois* they just nicked me as Punch Lad
surprisingly this is the only server I frequent where I don't have a silly meme nickname
welcome to colored name
can't bribe the mods with your choices
Saki appreciates dess and boolet equally
and no, neither choice will earn you more favor from the mods
who is #1 best
do you like gun or do you like scythe
I saw a wall of whitenames and I freaked out thinking my internet broke and the roles didn't load
inexplicably funny
why is this
<@431656503490117632> what is the goal of all life
not sure
Kane "I made Unisons as a prank" ko
It's probably gonna be a Tsubasa Unison
Hibiki just tanks by ramming her face into things
It's just funny to me how every Gear in some way can tank
but that's ok since Erk exists and he's this speedster magic god
She is
Every time I played FE7 I just fed everything to Lyn and watched as she roflstomped around
really depends on the formula
screw armor, all he needs is to dodge everything
chad dunban from Xenoblade Chronicles
evasion tanks
<@185949743321579520> she plays the best tank type
literally NEVER DIE
all of them pick tanks
they sit down to play an MMO
confirmed all the symphogears are tank classes
<@486087033652248576> it's a taunt
Or you follow around mister ninja man
You either stand still and hope you recieve Relic powers
So to survive a Noise attack
Ogawa Rating: <:Up:480050157853999117>
just follow around mister ninja man and you'll be safe
...wait so what you're saying is
"Things work because we say so"
Alternatively: Orks
She must be Crazy Diamond
Hibiki therefore is a living philosophical weapon because she punches things and they get repaired
Essentially "my bullshit works because I think it works"
Philosophical weapon
when next episode
Hibiki: *literally punches people out of being snapped*
Fudo: "I am invevitable."
Hibiki: "I AM HIBIKI TACHIBANA"
at least once
<@440138597539119114> enough to fill your closet
"Terrible Audience"
Tsubasa: Achievement Unlocked
the Noise can travel through cyberspace
<@486087033652248576> Season 6: Digi-Noise
Everyone has a fear of something at this point
there's always people uploading the subs to utub
feck
toss me a link?
ew can't find it on YT
currently in China
my VPN is acting up
sweet
wait is ep3 english subs out
momma is unnamed
These two suck at dealing with covert operations
I feel like Millarc just can‚Äôt help but show off and foxgirl doesn‚Äôt have a mind for these sorts of nitty-gritty things
They‚Äôre making mistakes despite knowing what their opponents are capable of
They aren‚Äôt good at what they do
I like that
It‚Äôs showing how messy they are
Yeah
Even so, it's a bad move (which will likely cost them)
(unless if you're trying to pick a fight)
Don't use anything that alerts the enemy to your presence
first mistake the Alchemists are making: Summoning Alca-Noise
oh that's because VPN dropped
meanwhile I've waited like half a minute to claim one quest reward on GFL and it's still not through
Yeah, Youtube runs moderately well
better one (?)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KM9T6-N_Eg
Is because Youtube is likely optimized to work on both VPNs
The only reason why I choose Youtube as my default
That last message took around 10s
Right now I have around like, anywhere from 500ms to 1s lag average between me pushing ENTER and the message showing up for any of you
Every day the internet situation here changes
And my super juiced up complimentary school VPN that has like 5x the reliability of ExpressVPN is having connection issues
ExpressVPN on PC is refusing to connect
Even VPN isn't a constant
Your friend likely takes an entire day to download one episode
Exactly
<@!246146781832806401> four hours ago I was having trouble connecting to discord
<@152896851660505088> what speed does your friend get
special circumstances
but due to China there are um
Well I normally hop on Kissanime
<@!246146781832806401> IM IN CHINA
fuck that shit I'm killing that link
god this audio is butts face
<@152896851660505088> Neither, my VPN won't handle it
W Boiled Extreme starts playing
Episode 13: Elfnein pulls out a W Driver
JOOOOOOKER
CYCLONE
Elfnein‚Äôs hair is greenish
<@486087033652248576> Carol is purple in color
Wrong person fuck
<@185949743321579520> Wait
No other Symphogear villain has been so keen with their plans
And more than that, after Carol keeled over
Point is, Carol is a great villain and definitely suitable as my endgame D&D villain
The Gears tossing their Zesshou down right there and obliterating the place
Or y‚Äôknow
Likely Maria since she was closer
And then take control
Because a Gear may be ballsy enough to inject Ver‚Äôs Nephilim junk into herself
<@185949743321579520> the correct thing to do would be to dispose of Ver and agonize him
Her plan would have worked, had fucking Ver not did his thing
She was also incredibly logical
Yeah
That was basically her only mistake
She overestimated Ver‚Äôs loyalty of zero
Honestly her Grand Fuckup was with Ver
Carol‚Äôs rational nature was way too strong
She thinks this law is holding down the potential of mortals and as a result is definitely going to kill a few gods
<@486087033652248576> villain is Carol with the changed goal of taking down a certain divine law which states that all good actions must be balanced by all evil actions
You really get into the mindset of ‚Äúwow mistakes were made here‚Äù or ‚Äúthey should‚Äôve done this better‚Äù
Complete with an artifact that produces what are essentially Alca-Noise crystals
Welcome to the mindset you get into when your final D&D campaign arc is pretty much all based on Symphogear stuff
that bass
god the sound on that shot too
"a nice pick"
in DA BUSINESS
<@141531216200466432> That's what we call
Yeah pretty much
lol.
"ketchup"
Chris have you been playing Fallout again
it's like a mini nuke launcher
what the fuck
SHE ACTUALLY USES RED HOT BLAZE
OH MY GOD SHE USES IT
Good transformation (still prefer Hibiki's)
I love it
Always sounding like she's arrived to pick a fight
Always so good
God Chris's song
Hope she's into anal fisting
She's gonna get kited to hell by Chris/bruteforced by Hibiki
Wolfgirl's screwed here
Chris time
HypeCat
why are they actually kinda badass with that sword attack
wait what the fuck

me and the boys
WE DEM BOYS
oh my god the segway noise. I love them.
Now the Gears are on the way and someone gonna get smacked
Yeah what did I say. If no Noise were summoned, Gears would have never been alerted
Anyways after my bathroom break
There's still hope though with Fuckboy's message
except instead of snakegirls and stuff it's that vampire girl, the dullahan, and whoever else
like that one monster girl anime
tomato paste
If the alca-noise wasn't dropped, they wouldn't have lost the blood
Yeah, the Segway of Mistakes
If they didn't drop the Alca-Noise, the Gears wouldn't have been alerted
Not only that, they suck at staying stealthy
Can you hear her YAMEROOOOOOOing from the clouds
Still, Saint-Germain would be horrified to learn this was their B-team
<@141531216200466432> A villain's gotta do what a villain's gotta do
Hibiki was healing from her issues already, but Tsubasa's had just begun in AXZ
Tsubasa was the perfect target for Millarc to hit
Honestly
shirabe sad
kirisad
As always, only the villains care about each other
And then Senkin Dur Da Bla begins playing
But when she pops up, she's gonna drop a literal nuclear bomb
<@141531216200466432> It's not gonna be the final battle
Time to drop the details in <#449826367903629313>
Well, guess what the bow means is going to hit them hard
Me: fuck
Players: "So I'm not gonna care"
Players: "I don't get it"
Me: "look at this bow, look at its mystery"
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<@486087033652248576> it's a lot less fun when I end up feeding them most of the details
has no hands on the clock
kirika however
<@!225771411833225216> They're smart twice every day
they still act like brainlets
nah they might be smarter than the average D&D party (no one has an INT of less than like, 14)
man if only my players used that level of a brain
I want all my sniper rifles to have that satisfying *BOOM*
whee VPN nothing loads
Kanade would immediately make it as a twitch personality
but the inside of the thing would be a note saying "just kidding, this is purified spring water. Stay hydrated kids."
Maria would sell bathwater
instead of me cheesing around Pharacamping
Although she's probably actually good at Overwatch
Chris is unintentionally a titty streamer
KIRI 500 IQ
oh my god Kiri did a smart
perfectly cut screams
She has an entire montage of her getting killed while emoting on someone
Kirika: Has the potential to be good at the game but memes around a lot
There's also something silly about watching a guy get shot once and immediately he builds like a skyscraper
At least it's somewhat entertaining to watch provided you edit it well
<a:verspin:393584985652592650>
at least it requries more skill than pubg
I don't know why
is it bad that I just had a mental image of Kirika at prom doing fortnite dances
perfect
now there is only one
If this was last season there would be two fuckboys
<@141531216200466432> that fuckboy

Tsubasa facing the symbol means she's fighting it
Tsubasa with her back towards the Kazanari symbol would mean she's becoming what her grandfather wants
Personal hope: Chris calls Fudou a manchild who wants all the toys in the box at some point
now time to switch off and try to link into ExpressVPN
fuck man
throughout the entire episode
2 VPN disconnections
but my god
It's why the Gears are so close too
Suffering together brings people together
<@256945399338631168> Well, as they say
FUUUUUDOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
As we all called it
It's not like how Carol just threw her minions around like "go do thing, seeya lol"
I do like how the three villains are actually concerned about each other's health
but I find myself loving Shirabe's too
Every season I love Hibiki's themes yeah
I love it
oh wow that intro to Shirabe's theme
there are two characters who are that goofy
The fact this duo interacts this way further reinforces the fact my campaign is just Symphogear
Kiri: "MILLARC'S GONNA ATTACK A HOSPITAL"
Shirabe: "um...probably not?"
*spotlight shows Millarc*
*duo screams*
oh my god that's sucha great scene
we all know what they're doing in heaven now
just one large titty flex
ExpressVPN linked in YEET
Punch/hug the shit out of you until you felt better
<@141531216200466432> that's basically what she'd do honestly
<:LUL:335671226812989440>
Nvm just grabbed VLC and got them from the wiki
i fan
Pls
Me no can tor
Wiki doesn‚Äôt have
Does anyone have the themes as mp3s
I see
Ah
Yeah but Bikki‚Äôs full got somehow leaked
Yeah
Does anyone have Shirabe‚Äôs theme
Press f for sword
Sword is back to being a sword though
Hibiki Tachibana and Yuuki Yuuna: the sisters that don‚Äôt know each other
<@139432096023183360> I made it the day I saw the OP
Hibiki Tachibana is a Hero form
Anyways now we got fucking
*Traditional Japanese shadow puppet play jutsu*
Fudou: ‚ÄúYou are weak baby. WATCH THIS.‚Äù
Oh my god
Ree
They are definitely smart enough
I don‚Äôt want to get caught with TOR
And my college has a supercomputer in its basement
College hates torrent
Don‚Äôt have torrent, don‚Äôt want to deal with torrent
Yeah I always watch it late
SAINT GERMAIN DATTO
WHAT IS EPISODE 4
WHAT THE FUUUUCK
Tsubasa: ‚ÄúYou killed 70,000 people.‚Äù
Millarc: ‚ÄúI had no choice!‚Äù
Tsubasa: ‚ÄúYOU HAD A CHOICE!‚Äù
I like that idea of that drama
Honestly
<@139432096023183360> that‚Äôs my interpretation too
Miku‚Äôs fucked
He stopped the battle when Hibiki went all ‚Äúfriendship? :D‚Äù
It seems like Fudou‚Äôs very much in the interest of cleaning his hands of them though
So now it‚Äôs gonna be the Gears + Noble Red vs Literally The Entire World
And n ow Hibiki‚Äôs fist looks like a buttplug when it spins
Welcome to Symphogear
Just became Ziggo from Battlebots
So buttplug wolfgirl
Wait
Maka‚Äôs scythe is a bit closer to Maria‚Äôs big spooky ghost attack
Saint Germain is her persona
And then just becomes a Yuusha
‚ÄúHibiki decided to put all the points into offense‚Äù
Also I love how the canon explanation for it is basically
I think she‚Äôs going to get pressed into doing it
God the Germain-Hibiki duet of Hanazaku Yuki was amazing though
Also damn that image of divine power wielded by someone who isn‚Äôt worthy
But for the pain adventure, it‚Äôs definitely going to be them going for Miku
But is it a curse that binds to the body or soul
Which may mean she doesn‚Äôt have the Curse by a technicality
Right
Homunculus
Elfnein?
Also known as ‚ÄúRando on the internet wants Tsubasa‚Äôs foot on face‚Äù
Then Miku never had an in-show cutscene
Tsubasa ran at the Giga Noise, transformed without a cutscene
And an outside view in S2
We did get a villain view in S1
It just makes more sense
I always think that magical girls transform in a pocket of dilated time and space
So people go like ‚ÄúOH MY GOD A MURDER‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúOH MY GOD A ROBBERY‚Äù
Then killing a poor chap down the street with the gun and booking it
Well, it‚Äôs more like robbing a gun store
Yeah
Yeah
Honestly
Chris can infinitely summon cruise missiles
An entire fucking satellite can fit inside our hamster
<@486087033652248576> it‚Äôs Symphogear
It's like one of those scenes where we push them into showing off their awesome NEW FORMS
Yeah
Hibiki Tachibana is a Hero
was so good
god that scene
to commit murder ofc
Hibiki‚Äôs two panels are just her derp Chibi
Art requested, Lily
Hibiki: ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
Miku: ‚ÄúOh I wish she‚Äôd eat my pussy the same way!‚Äù
Hibiki: *nom nom nom*
<@486087033652248576> how tho
SAAAAAAME BOAT TIME
Thanos Miku

Thanos Miku
Lily somehow you‚Äôre even later than me <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
Yes
*fail*
"oh yeah let's rely on someone else to use the superpower"
WAS THE SAME MISTAKE THAT CAROL MADE.
which I will remind you
trying to run Rain World *and* Warframe hehe
oh thats why I was lagging
People burning instead of dying normally is just ‚Äúyeah that happens.‚Äù
Either badguys explode or just burst into flame and disintegrate
I watch Kamen Rider, who depending on what you watch
<@!246146781832806401> yeah to be fair
The old camerawork style
The other transformations all use the old camera angles and stuff
You're right
She'd likely end up using all the old names
Honestly I don't know how helpful Saint Germain would be, even in topics she should know like chemistry
Tsubasa will never become what Fudou wants because a sword has to be straight
Conan is a great first anime honestly
And I'd just watch that as a kid and to me watching the stuff was like 500 iq
Parents had this big box set of the Chinese dub
Yeah, didn't even watch Pokemon or YuGiOh before Conan
Yeah that was the first anime I ever watched
(Wait, it's still the same VA right?)
The amazing thing is they sound completely different...and then you look at young Kanade
I checked their lists
Yeah
So my memory of karaoke scenes is that one episode where they straight up state how bad Conan is at singing
I'd like to state that my first anime ever was Detective Conan/Case Closed
not a bad thing at least
also Elfnein singing gives me massive Carol flashbacks
nah she'll probably show up in the OST sadly
DOES THIS MEAN WE GET AN ELFNEIN CD????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
elfnein song
wait
slightly derpy-eyed
I love how Miku's water guns are actually styled after Chris's guns
YE BOI

oh god wtf
very rough job

papa bless
HAHHAHAHAHHAHHA
NOOOOOO
<@!263983345669505025> FOR ~~science~~ ***ALCHEMY!***

can someone crop this I need this as a new elfneinHorror emote
HI IM META AND THIS IS ANIME THEORY
EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE
which is why she has to eat so much
and the hairclips consume her calories
that's the only explanation

the squad
<@!263983345669505025> also why does Hibiki have such a powerful evil face
YEEEEEEES
YES
THE WHOLE SQUAD JIIIIII
HOLY FUCK
soggy hamster is the most adorable
Seriousness of the guy: not very
I feel like the UN inspector's VA was used extensively for ugly bastards before
alright time to finally start watching the fucking episodeeeeee
inspector-guy gonna die next episode as well
MIKU NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
also to end off
Damn, the effects of Millarc's curse are pretty horrifying
PARKOUR MASTAAAAAAHHHHHH
wait Tsubasa can wall jump
can't imagine that household
This one just immediately hits the accelerator and goes
Nah, Zettou Amen No Habakiri takes a while to start up
The way Tsubasa's song immediately kicks off is lovely
Maria is permanently stressed
It's also one of the only episodic shows I can actually sit down and binge
So FX is not the main focus
It's inarguably a classic, but it also aged incredibly well due to it being more mystery than action
yes
man I am just kicking this man while he's down aren't I
We nickname him Pedostache
<@!256802531584376833> Pedostache
***intensify Ugly Bastard tag***
me whenever he was revealed
WHO HAS THE SKILLS
Mortal Kombat Millarc mod when
RANDOM OLD DRUNK MAN NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Expected.png
Noble Red doesn't want to be called monsters, UN calls them monsters, UN gets shived
I don't think it wanted to be a cliffhanger
oh guess my subs just cut it
It might be possible for Carol to take both smallest bust and biggest bust
Wait
Wait, it's Carol/Elfnein (Child Form) < Prelati < Tsubasa
I think Prelati may be the flattest but Tsubasa runs a close second
then it really is possible for Basa to be flatter than Shirabe
damn
CALL ANSI
CALL ISO
WE NEED A COMPARISON TEAM
wait is she flatter than Shirabe
"unless if you're shirabe"
<a:verspin:393584985652592650>
she's still a washboard
sexy or not
NTR logic?
whoever is on the recieving end of that is going to get absolutely fucked
Can I hope that Chris‚Äôs Amalgam is just Gate of Babylon except instead of a bunch of random melee weapons being thrown around it‚Äôs all of her guns
go fuck yourself though, Mr. NTR
Becoming a god in the worst way possible, that's how we do in Symphogear‚Ñ¢
"I'm alive? No...I failed to die."
Big S1 Tsubasa energy
I still love Millarc's design
Time for Millarc's VA to work on K11
Why do I suddenly unironically want Millarc's VA to use her Millarc voice for a gacha game
Wow this seal control thing continues to expand in power
aaaaaaaaaaaaaahahhahah
XV5 is going to suck isn't it
still need to watch XV5 I think
Last one for the road: Yugioh monster.
Training paying off there, Maria
Also, this motherfucker XD
and then the spell card cutin came in and I immediately realized it was a Jojo all along
My immediate thought was World Trigger
SEEEEEEEX PIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIISTOLS!
She'd cause another concert-level incident for Hibiki
Yeah, she probably wouldn't have made that play if she could only do it once per target
Is it once per target, if it fails, you can't be controlled again, or can you be hit by the seal again later
<@141531216200466432> We don't know if we can attempt another Control
If Miku become unable to function, he can (perhaps) Seal Control Hibki and use her to complete the plan
That's a pseudo-viable strategy
Possible backup plan
TITTY MISSILES
WHAT THE FUCK
A blessed face, certainly
Maria training montage, which means she'll stop jobbing for all of two episode
(Inspector guy reminds me of the ugly bastard normally found in NTR)
My theory though is Carol burning her own soul currently, as alchemy like Carol‚Äôs can be fueled by memory or souls
Might be subs being subs
Also Elfnein was referring to herself in like...a very strange manner
It's fucking Wizard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkUUXvOp0R8
Also now rewatching the whole "let's take it out of a sigil" thing
I love this so much
SHE DID THE POSE.
Connect, PLEASE!
Carol could fit for like every single angry shitpost
Carol: *slams the door open* "BITCH IM HERE TO DEMAND WHERE MY FUCKING RENT IS"
Elza: "Ah, look at my buttplug collection-"
<@!225771411833225216> god I can just imagine that
I mean it is Episode 7 which means very likely Elfnein gonna die the death
I want Hibiki to arm wrestle me and practically toss me off the table and then ask if I‚Äôm ok
Kanade femdomming the shit out of anyone in this chat
Forget fuckinnnnnn
And yet she is manly as fuck and I love it
Hibiki is like 5ft tall and I could literally rest my chin on her head
Although yes, yes, it‚Äôs not being lovestruck but more like the feeling of being a little kid again and watching superheroes be kickass awesome on TV
*yes*
I mean this in the most manly way possible but
The dumb shit I say during Symphogear watching time
My bet is at least ten
I wonder how many we‚Äôre ending the season with
And now titty mecha has done one
Tsubasa must have did her Heaven‚Äôs Wrath at least once
I‚Äôm sure Hibiki did at least one
Kirika did one, Shirabe did one
Also currently I think the Rider Kick counter is at 5
It‚Äôs Kamen Rider Den-Ozard
<@486087033652248576> And then at the end Elfnein just does it for her
Elfnein: "Who's cooking mac 'n cheese?"
Carol: "I'm making mac 'n cheese! AND NOBODY CAN STOP ME!"
"She must have a powerful T-Pose"
Every time I look at casual art of Micha I just think
Build was a good season
~~and then Basa dies like croco boi~~
***KAZUMIIIIIIIIIIIIIN***
GREEEEEEAAAAAAAASEEEEEE
Greeaaaaaaase
Could be worse <@486087033652248576>
<@486087033652248576> How to: Maximum Drive Sadness
W-B-X
Carol and Elfnein
Hibiki used her Stand, [ M A N K A I ]
Carol is a Stand again
Gone, reduced to ashes
ohmygod Miku looks so good
WITH TOTALLY NOT MANKAI
AND THEN THE IMMEDIATE ONE-UP
Never mind WHY IS CHRIS BEING IN A JET FIGHTER THE COOLEST
WHAT
HOW DOES HIBIKI PROVE TO BE MORE BADASS THAN AN EPISODE 8 X-DRIVE
WHAT THE FFFFFUUUUUUUCKKKKKK
EPISODE 8 X-DRIVE
W H A T
WHAT
At this point we really will be at 10 when the season ends
Millarc has increased the Rider Kick counter
Especially with the horns as well
She looks so good in Gear
I always love Miku wearing a gear
Don‚Äôt worry though
The Wizard references continue
But damn
I‚Äôm still watching
I like Carol‚Äôs entire character so much my D&D campaign‚Äôs final villain is pretty much a face rip
And when she‚Äôs singing she‚Äôs so...firm about *this is what I‚Äôve chosen to do*
But Carol‚Äôs voice sounds like she‚Äôs constantly thinking and plotting
It sounds fundamentally different from the Gears who wear their personalities on their sleeves with their voices
But it‚Äôs also...so beautifully ferocious
It‚Äôs a loli voice yeah
I love Carol‚Äôs voice so much
Top Ten Characters Who Can Defeat Thanos
And instantly won
She snapped the fingers of her Infinity Harp
<@167422652602908672> probably just gave them O type blood
Give her headpats and ice cream
Carol is a good girl
Carol TKO
Noble Red: We stabbed 70k
Carol: I almost beat Thanos at his game
(Noble Red: No fair, how does she get to have an I WIN button)
Sing durdabla to win
<@!99695384296701952> and if I had to guess, likely burning the bad ones
<@167422652602908672> Notorious BIG
#1: Shem-Ha (User: Miku Kohinata)
Top Ten Stands that can beat Dio Over Heaven
Does that mean Shem-Ha is now Miku‚Äôs Stand
Wait
Wait so Carol and SG can hurt each other
Make a bomb a bomb
You can however
You can‚Äôt re-explode an exploded
She already exploded
Carol-cola
If you shake Carol does she have a fizzy glow
UN Council: ‚Äú...seriously what the fuck.‚Äù
Genjuro: ‚ÄúThink of it as using a nuke to shoot down thirty‚Äù
‚ÄúShe used illegal weapon‚Äù
It‚Äôs probably gonna be something like
‚ÄúOnly get away with house arrest‚Äù
Also nice Genjuro
Also now Noble Red finally done with Fudou‚Äôs shit so now they‚Äôre gonna turn
Welcome to Windy City
Half and half
One mind and body and soul
Miku also finally strips for Hibiki <:MikuLewd:604468649075408896>
And instantly it gets me my solution
And now Shem-Ha drops
...I was designing a thing a while back themed a bit after SSJ but I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get it down well
To me it looks super robotic
God it looks SO GOOD
God I love the eyes of Shem-Ha though
Truly, I am a Hibiki raised by Tsubasa and Chris
<‚Äî electrical fucking engineering student btw
<‚Äî can‚Äôt even follow the solve algorithm
<‚Äî still can‚Äôt solve Rubik‚Äôs cubes
She has to get Miku to solve those for her
The only reason why Hibiki got stuck in Daedalus End is because she isn‚Äôt smart enough to solve the Rubik‚Äôs cube
CUBES LOL.
And Noble Red lookin like
Carol almost destroying the universe and then X-Driving all the Gears except Hibiki at once
The angriest loli
The best loli
Can we make a One Punch Man parody of Carol
She just sits there and boops
No she doesn‚Äôt
D cell sorry
Thanos: *oh no*
Carol: *hehehehe*
Kirika: ‚ÄúMemes are miracles!‚Äù
And then instantly kill the Gauntlet
All Carol needs to do is to create a Philosophical Weapon that destroys memes
And if Thanos is winning
Thanos cannot win
Carol: *GENOCIDE*
Thanos: *snap*
Carol: *block*
Thanos: *punch*
#3: Carol Malus Diendheim
Lordgenome
She is alive as just a head
Vanessa is now Lordgenome from TTGL
*gets eaten immediately, without any ceremony*
"I will live!"
Honestly it's a little like how Roman died in RWBY Season 3
but not like this
I mean, they were gonna die
RIP Noble Red
Though Shem-Ha's awakening was just
"Let's not kill anyone here"
Also Genjuro being the best man
Fudou: *oh no*
Tsubasa: *activates her stand power*
Fudou "You can't win against me with songs" Kazanari
God damn Tsubasa's fight was awesome
RIP DAD
DAD???????????????
WHAT WAS THAT EPISODE
oh my god
They're just in the ground
That doesn't count, he doesn't hold them at all

What about like twenty swords
You could do that too yes
Or if you have superpowers, no arms
Four swords is actually kinda cool since that implies you're somehow managing to hold two swords in one arm
*two swords* REAL SHIT
*one sword* I sleep
The special power is *dual fucking wielding*
What a shitty anime my god
Which looks like the thing Kirito did in episode 1
You could also say Zi-O's first finisher is a SAO reference because it's a sword dash
But that's because Tendou Souji is the smuggest form of Mary Sue and he doesn't like to look at explosions
Except for the roundhouses
Technically you can say that every rider kick from Kabuto could be an inazuma kick
just let me have my fun :c
(sssshhhh let me live my dream)
I can't think of one
fuck.
Clearly they're um
It's gonna be another "not like this" moment
Shem-Ha's gonna go all "fucking arrogant idiot" and just laser him in the face
Fudou's probably fucking dead
Besides she only has one rider kick the entire season
They're showa style
*ssssshhhhhhh*
it doesn't have the pose, or the gesture
I'm not counting Tsubasa's spinball as a rider kick, that's a copout
come on we gotta make it to double digits in rider kicks
So we might not make it to ten by the end of the season
Sadly, no Rider Kicks this episode
*shoots a rocket at the moon*
*enters cyberspace*
Vanessa: "Easy lol"
Genjuro: "Vanessa, can you hack the moon?"
I don't put it past them
honestly
god if they do this
Yeah I think it's from the movie
I made that joke near the start of the season
It's probably gonna be Hibiki oneshotting the moon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY2JzfLU8Ds
it's time for her to do some weird absurd hacking sequence of the moon
It's time for Vanessa to become Lordgenome
Some guy was doing a RabbitTank suit, and as he was making it, the Hazard Trigger episode appeared
But yeah, the story of Shem-Ha, my designs, and I is basically like that one cosplayer during Kamen Rider Build
karma's a real bitch and her name is Shem-Ha
Her friend gets a hole punched in her
Millarc gets introduced by punching a hole in someone
It *is* ironic
Wait oh my god you're right
The moment Shem-Ha appeared I switched the design to resemble Shem-Ha more
It was based off of G's Shenshoujing initially
<@141531216200466432> I had a design for a Symphogear-styled weird superfusion suit going on in an RP elsewhere
Vanessa has a 30% chance
Millarc has a 1% chance of living
I don't think wolfgirl is living
thanks bttv
The real NotLikeThis moment
You want to get up and cheer but you also remember that Symphogear destroys everything you love the minute after
Every episode of Symphogear just leaves you sitting there, mouth agape
*Not the cool dad*
*Dad, no*
It seems awesome, but...
<@209896097026408449> Symphogear Experience‚Ñ¢
Miku looks *amazing*
<@141531216200466432> If there's one thing to be redeemed from it
and Romeo and Juliet
Hey it killed Cleopatra and Marc Antony
This is why sexting is bad kids
Season's over
Mutual understanding achieved
*goes home*
Everyone: *nods*
Enki: "I made the moon because Fine was a bitch"
"the moon's gonna collide with the earth. Let's turn the moon back on"
Then again how relatable is Symphogear like, ever
I guess whatever drove Fine to build the tower was exactly what the Annumaki really didn't like
By saying that name, you reference another name, which references one ugly asshole
I guess in a sense it's like calling Voldemort "He Who Shall Not Be Named"
So you'd think they'd create a name to reference a name which references an entity
If you write it on a piece of paper, you can't just throw it away
Yeah, because god's name is said to be so holy that you don't just say it or whatever
Trying to find this
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shem_HaMephorash
The hidden name is Shema Yisrael right
Mesopotamian gods are *dicks.*
And while our modern gods are very "Hey guys, look at this cool thing I have to show you, it's called heaven, wanna enter?"
Now likely this is going to be the Mesopotamian incarnation of 'god'
Pretty much
You know, the one who likely holds the power of the Big Bang
fight God
you know
Although I don't think you'd want to really...
(He?)
<@!90229127075893248> If that's the case then at the very least there's some chance she can be reasoned with
That guy *immediately* changed suits.
<:basaDead:536679626177511424>
before the art crew made Basa even flatter
She's around S1 basa
Mordred on the other hand is almost Basa flat
Nah I think she's got more than Basa
Best history lesson
Thanks, Fate.
XD
And the very accurate historical figure, Shirou Emiya
Arthur "I HAVE TITTIES" Pendragon
Thomas "I am a furry" Edison
Ah yes
And normally they're super on point with their research
Smite found it too
<@279341087494242304> oh not only that
Fire Emblem aka "We just wanted to sound cool"
Ichaival was created by a group named Nintendo
Hibiki would be the one to cry at like every sad scene
honestly that would be more along the lines of Chris
Hibiki: is this a documentary or something
*Gears watch Symphogear*
But it's actually invented by Japan.
Ichaival is supposed to be nordic
would hibiki watch symphogear
bang
fuckkkckkds
that didn't work

Also true
Pretty much every election yeah
I mean did they not see how angry people got when congress tried that during Obama
<@256945399338631168> yeah to be fair Parliament is also trying to pass A13
Can you believe it, the EU rep for Brexit isn‚Äôt even British
It should yes but for some reason it‚Äôs still cooking in the EU
Should‚Äôve been done and over like a year ago but people LOVE TO DRAG THINGS OUT
God just finish up with Brexit already
Who Rome called ‚Äúbarbarians‚Äù
We *shouldn‚Äôt* since that was what Rome called themselves before they got stepped on by Monguls
Humanity is a tough nut to crack
If we‚Äôre defining it as Congress then you‚Äôd have to consider literally all the lobbyists
I dunno but they miiight have connections to the news and just end up covering fraud up under the rug
<@!154722817412300800> that‚Äôs because of the news actually
Which feeds its own issue in this endless spiral
Which feeds back into complacency
They should
But that‚Äôs because for some reason the states don‚Äôt give holidays for Election Day
I understand why
Actually that‚Äôs a lie I do
<@113071228113162240> I don‚Äôt either, it BAFFLES ME
Next time you want to generalize people as bad, think of the people in your life that are good
And so it became the intro to my calculus 1 textbook.
And then they thought about it
<@!102691114762371072> funny enough when the question was asked everyone laughed at it lol
Meanwhile there is literally a question in mathematics concerning fractals that states ‚Äúhow long is the shoreline of Britain‚Äù
By ‚Äúminor‚Äù I actually mean ‚Äúpretty big‚Äù
We‚Äôve done minor fusion experiments and it just releases lots of energy and goes pof
Yeah but it‚Äôs not actually that big
If it breaks it doesn‚Äôt melt sludge, it just...dissipates
Fusion however is actually perfectly safe
<@!154722817412300800> see fission is dangerous
Screw it all, nuclear fusion is the future.
funny joke haha
IS ‚ÄúGOOD‚Äù
A CONFIRMED TOXIN
YOU WANT TO TELL ME ARSENIC
You want to tell me gallium-arsenic compounds are somehow ‚Äúgood‚Äù
<@256945399338631168> every time someone says solar is green I die inside a little bit
Oh hell no nuclear fusion will be the way
Good meem
I really, really do not like China.
China‚Äôs also gonna be the one to create the Grey Goo in the name of greed
<@256945399338631168> yeah but see
Which is actually an endeavor we should work on...lots of resources in our orbit
Ehh, true. But someone‚Äôs eventually gonna our fully capable military weapons in space with the guise of ‚Äúshooting down space debris‚Äù
Seriously if you‚Äôre gonna spend so much on military at least put it into the space division
That is if they don‚Äôt blow all our tax money on military first
The thing I had to memorize by typing it in too much
Oh ok
And I‚Äôve held two jobs already
I don‚Äôt even know what an NI even is and I‚Äôm a full legal US resident
Be good at game, get free season passes
Not only that they‚Äôre F2P with probably the best model possible
Meanwhile Fortnite has literally a biweekly update always aiming to give something new
They just never did anything because the designers never made any good ideas
I think their dev team was decently sized
And this is why Fortnite is better, because Epic Games *has a direction for it*
Trying to find a good direction for their game
Making their game
Not because of cameltoe, because they‚Äôre doing this instead of like
That‚Äôs honestly why I hate PUBG
<@!188714906143424513> Manchurian, a subgroup of Chinese that comes from like the northeast zone
Misread the verbal cues, sorry
<@!188714906143424513> six foot tall quarter-Manchurian Chinese
<@99695384296701952> I probably do
...is this really serious discussion?
It‚Äôs ok every man has that phase where he wishes he had tits
Woot. I guess?
<@!188714906143424513> I rolled well in the Asian gene table and people say I look Korean so
Think they did
I‚Äôm a pretty tall guy but that man was built like a grizzly bear
I actually went to Scotland as a tourist once and our guide was like the most Scottish man you could ever meet
no asuka sit down
GET IN THE GOD DAMN EVA ALREADY OR REY HAS TO DO IT
***GET IN THE EVA***
<@284390402210136064> RAKHI GET IN THE ROBOT
Oh I hated my public school system lol
I hope I‚Äôm not
<@256945399338631168> good thing we aren‚Äôt robots though, since if that were the case we wouldn‚Äôt have a lot of things
Then again so was the one in the states until people realized they could throw money at people to convince them to do things
Communism was ‚Äúfor the masses‚Äù yeah
I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd want a fully united planet, since one government with the world in its hands is a little too much power
Yeah hopefully in a few years they meet up and rethink the rules
But eh, luckily we don‚Äôt have orbital weapons either
Which is sad as heck because there‚Äôs so many rules surrounding space
If our lives were perfect they wouldn‚Äôt be interesting wouldn‚Äôt they
Hey, what‚Äôs life if you don‚Äôt fall into a few thornbushes now and then
If the sun can get up time and time again and slog across the sky then I could too
Except for me instead of the drill it was the sun
<@256945399338631168> yes
Things turned out for the better.
<@456226577798135808> it was...honestly a necessary phase for me. If I didn‚Äôt drive myself to rock bottom I wouldn‚Äôt know how to dig myself out of any hole
Big yeet, dab, etc etc etc.
I didn‚Äôt get here by overestimating myself, I got here by thinking I sucked lmao
Unless if you‚Äôve got a massive ego
We all see ourselves in a worse light than how we actually are
(Like your gf)
My sister complains about my below average taste in apparel every time I head home over break. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôm used to because I know I suck at it and it‚Äôs one of the few things I‚Äôm not putting effort into because whatever lol
I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs one or two fashionistas here that can help...me not being one of them. God am I bad at fashion lol
Finland so you can assist in the meme export :P
Not to mention the fire already burning across multiple nations
Nah, europe is not a fun area
Wait you‚Äôre europe zone
Move to the other side of the US. There‚Äôs a reason why I didn‚Äôt go to school in my home state
Also get good rolls in the genetic lottery
Still archers nonetheless and badasses
People think they‚Äôre horseback archers, nope. Woodland archers
Ow
GO GET THAT JOB
GO DO THE THING
Which tells me at the very least middle management is competent(ish)
At least it sounds like your job is good at putting people where they belong
ooh embassy
But the certification training is so simple you can basically get it done in an afternoon
Also since it's food you need certs
True
You really don't *need* training
Honestly unless if you're working a job like say, being a doctor or an engineer
*pap*
Yeah so at least management is good
With the whole "even if you mess up catering they'll move you somewhere that suits you better"
There‚Äôs no harm in turning away from something you can‚Äôt do
Nah
Seems like at least you‚Äôll work decent retail
So what you‚Äôre saying is you‚Äôre working retail
Or anywhere that can get you some medical help
Okay no find yourself a clinic first
who the f u c k
Who the hell just throws eggs at people?
Yeah heart problems and strokes do not go well together
damn
But the sucky thing is I basically don't get to have an internship until like junior year or unless I speedrun my courses
Don't get me wrong I love my major, especially since it'll be a respected profession as per the definition of our robotic overlords
This is the best job you've worked so far
BE HYPED
Welcome to how contracts work
Now if you're EXTREMELY lucky you might be able to land a permanent spot if you do well
Also known as "incredibly boring" but whatever
I mean it's an accounting job it seems like
Uh, do it????
Precisely one egg, from the chicken
To grant man great fortune
Thou must drop egg on man's head from 3 stories up
It was an old ritual
I'd call that hella lucky
Then he gets a sweet job offer that pays him 4x as much
Man gets whacked by an egg and gets hella unlucky
*As all things should be...*
The world perfectly balances out
I mean once again
How far is it?
DO IT NOW
Contracts are good
and the world perfectly balances out
oh hey
Just to be safe checklist yourself https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/concussion/symptoms-causes/syc-20355594
Just a stage 1 concussion but still
Ended up concussioned
Just, a flag.
Someone on the color guard in my band once got smacked by a flag during practice
And yeah definitely go to to hospital or something please...
The real measure is how much force
They just have to poke you
I mean sharp objects don't have to be swung hard to cut skin
OOOOKAY GET THAT CHECKED OUT
How high up
How hard was it?
Well it's an egg
right.
(yeah go take a nap)
im sorry he's a goner
he's lost too much blood
NO IM NOT BEING SUGGESTIVE SHUT UP
Problem is the head also really likes its blood
Yeah
Or yes house works
Wait then it can't be me
Man, now I'm really hoping it's not me you're scared about...
Same
Same
oh nic
Now go to a doctor and be healthy boi
Good
oof
oh shit you might actually have a concussion then
wait no
SLEEP
Well, if you consider not being very flexible a defect I guess that's it
My mom was like 40 years old when she had me, and from my sister I think the doctors expected me to have some form of defect or something
Though if I want to say I was blessed by RNG I guess I was as well
I mean that's pretty much the only thing I was handed in life
But eh, I'll try my best
Now the issue comes with how much I *fucking lied to myself* since now I find it hard to hand down my habits as advice
Throughout a few years I feel like I kinda lied to myself by saying "oh yeah I'm talented" as a way to avoid the potential sadness that is the fact I actually had no proper talent, I was just incredibly good at sitting down and picking a thing apart into its components
Thankfully my parents sat down and taught me study skills. In the fourth grade.
I'd be crap at pretty much all my classes if I didn't really sit down and grind my skills
See I used to be an awful student
Just don't look up basically
By looking at things in really small components you can feel like you're actually getting things done
Now that's *actually* a good student tactic, please pick that up
Just like how assignments were listed in CS1 classes
Then listing its components
So instead I broke my homework down by listing it all
But then I realized I was looking at the entire mountain too much
See I also used to suck
So I taught her a few ways that I picked up doing work lol
And the more she stresses the less she can concentrate because she's got big ADHD problems
My own gf has huge focus issues with her work
Yeah I get that
And then I realized "Wait, I could theoretically have more free time, and better quality free time if I just did things this way..."
Oh trust me my work ethic was awful before
And no one can call you out because you've done your work
My philosophy for being lazy is to do everything super early and then kick your feet back and laugh
And no please don't call me a good student, I'm actually awful XD
AP tests woohoo
Yay for post-dream disorientation
That‚Äôs a nightmare and a half. XD
Oh
is this an episode 1?
oh dear
If it‚Äôs a good boss (which I‚Äôm sure your boss is) that boss will let you have a short sit-down
Tell your boss, you need a breather
Oh dear
is just 7 days
‚ù§
Yeah I remember that story
...especially since I was hurt by them before
I don't have the energy to go out and start conspiracy theories
Oh I won't
We just didn't understand it enough
Remember that before people found out that radiation gives you all sorts of bad things, we snorted radioactive salts for "health reasons."
Pretty much. I'd always advise people to err on the side of caution with new fields of science.
Don‚Äôt you...want more people on your side?
I don‚Äôt get the radical exclusionary philosophy
Eh, just dyson swarm
But the sun <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
(Not really ‚Äî I really oppose the singularity)
<@284390402210136064> aha a fellow fan of the Singularity I see
Someone would still manage to find a way to be distinct
That‚Äôs a very strange wish but ok
Wow that‚Äôs how to get Meta to seriously start ranting I guess
We in fact have an entire collective of out of context things said. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúTexts from last night‚Äù
What the guy doesn‚Äôt know was that Jim accidentally filled the form in wrong and now you have to deal with it
And someone‚Äôs like ‚Äúwow you hate Jim you suck‚Äù
And Jim could be a nice fellow
Like you can say ‚ÄúScrew Jim, I hate Jim‚Äù
Once you apply context to things suddenly so much changes
Of course not, because hundreds of years ago:
-We would be farming
-None of us would have phones
-We would still be living in a slave driven society
It just hurts because you‚Äôve cut out so much relevant information that went into the article
But uuuuurgh it just hurts seeing people cite from historical articles without context
That too
And silently tell myself ‚Äúoh dear some idiot who never looked at the context‚Äù
Every time anyone cites Solomon as a justification for some crazy draconian bullshit I just roll my eyes
Good on you for teaching your kid well, he hates you <:GWliliumLaughTae:410086974620303384>
And yet Solomon preached his way of educating children as like the best way or something
His son grew up to be a drunk and absolutely hated his dad
God damn, Solomon was not a nice guy *please understand this people*
Thankfully I learned to take that book with a grain of historical context salt very early in my life
The only reason why it didn‚Äôt was because that change would have been too radical for its time
In fact actual theologists/historians say that if he could, the old Moses slave law would have said ‚ÄúNo slavery allowed‚Äù
And it annoys me so much
And people forget this
Exactly
‚ÄúTreat slaves with any degree of kindness? What?‚Äù
In a historical context those values would have been considered extremely progressive
Which actually about religion hahaaaa
Pretty much
Do people not understand the concept of a sliding scale
WELL ACTUALLY [insert absurd example]
Some sort of weird superiority complex
Wha
Eh
‚ÄúThe world hates us, so we‚Äôre gonna ignore more and more people‚Äù
It is weird
You know you‚Äôre right
True, but somehow I feel like this radicalism has just spiraled down to cutting out more and more people
Democracies and republics work?
Isn‚Äôt that how, you know
And now questions are bad I guess????
People built themselves up to this point off of questions, starting from: ‚ÄúWhat are the interesting properties of fire?‚Äù
I don‚Äôt get why people just think questions are bad
Yep
And the teacher specifically said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt watch the sequels‚Äù
I remember I had to watch it as an assignment for the philosophy unit for English
Not saying it was bad CGI
Now we have Doctor Strange which is just a permanent CGI-hack
It was just mind blowing because these effects were insane
That‚Äôs what also really helped it along
It was a special effects revolution too
Spoon bending.
Might be them
But directors were like ‚Äúno that‚Äôs too hard for people to understand‚Äù
The original Matrix was planned to use humans as computer processing space
Human brains are just the weirdest enigma
Processing power
Aka: *Don‚Äôt let Google do it.*
Just don‚Äôt let any big corporation make it because otherwise we‚Äôd have ads crammed everywhere
I don‚Äôt want firmware patches every week
Although by god do not let Microsoft run it
I much prefer the latter Singularity where people still get to live
How to have squishy robo-human
You get it
Mregh
It‚Äôs ok silicon exists
Though if I‚Äôm like 60 years old I might appreciate it a lot more
Neither of those I‚Äôm a particular fan of
The other is humans become the machines
One is the machines become smarter than humans
There are two possibilities of the singularity
The Singularity is when the machines take over
Right he‚Äôs too busy watching anime and smoking weed <:GWrjkSeemsKappa:390299883984257028>
Elon Musk can probably handle the last one
My gf has big ADHD problems and really had trouble keeping herself sorted whenever she got up and looked at the big picture
Breaking them down so far allows you to at the very least maintain confidence that you're on the right track
Then break those down further to problems you can slug out easily
Start breaking it down into its components. Little algorithms and problems you can handle
Don't just look at the problem as one big problem
Practice those compsci skills. Apply it to your life
Okay so my *actual* advice time:
Yeah, an important year
oh so junior year
help
uh
American high school?
Study well and do your best
Oh you'll be fine
So long as you know this is what you want to do in life, it'll be hard but fun
But it's also fun as heck if you asked to get into it
Seriously, it will be *hard.*
ELECTRICITY AND COMPUTER FRIEND
Oh shit compsci
Eh, I try my hardest
(Oh.)
(You guys are getting that kind of stuff?)
The world is big. It's scary
<@290431224596660224> If it comforts you any...I've gone through that feeling too
So much propaganda
But now it‚Äôs them yelling at America so
Every like other day they seem to have a new TV war drama based on just hating Japan
Like god how much more do you have to hang World War 2 over someone else‚Äôs head
<@!188714906143424513> Real shit about China and Japan: Can China please stop flexing its Japanese hate boner already
It's just that the motivation has to go somewhere so it causes you to do a weird
No you do it normally to
It causes you to write weird and angry forum posts
It's the worst
Have you ever felt the feeling of empty motivation
~~BECAUSE FUCK I DONT~~
DO EVERYTHING YOU'VE ALWAYS TOLD YOURSELF YOU NEED TO DO
DO SOME CHORES OR SOMETHING
<@!188714906143424513> WRITE SOMETHING
YOU HAVE SURVIVED.
Nice
or who knows.
Or DA
Pixiv I think
Not sure
sleep child
It's...comforting to me, somehow
Everything happens for a reason...the reason may be a consequence of the past, or the herald of a destination in the future. But everything happens for a reason.
So I think he did an experiment in self-motivation with me and sure enough I actually managed to autopilot and do just as well if not better than before
Though dad kicked his pride down a few notches when he learned that a lot of them really, really weren't good students and in reality were just being kicked around by their parents
Coming from an asian society hearing that just hurts
Hard parents feelsbad
Got lazy, suddenly english skills sucked and wait what do you mean I'm failing
Happened to me in elementary school <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
(Real talk: Don't tell children they're talented. They bank on it too much and get super lazy and eventually get kicked in the genitals by life. Tell them they're hard and dedicated workers. Then they'll work even harder and keep shooting up)
All you need is the ability to sit down and digest the information to blocks you can understand, a little dash of luck, and a lot of effort put into study skills
They only rode that so far
Here's words coming from an honors student, by the way. Surrounded by people with actual talent all my life
I'm just glad that now that I've broken down the lie that I've gotten here by "talent" (reality is that it was about like 10% me praying to my wonky mental RNG to 'click' and suddenly have a near perfect understanding upon waking up the next day and 90% just breaking problems down, doing the hard work, and actually managing to understand things) I can actually sit down and pick apart all of what really powered me
So I taught her my way of just breaking problems down into smaller and smaller things
[You have lived to see another day.]

very specific
I'm going to bed

Lab-driven courses <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>

Tell me about labs man because I‚Äôll be suffering those next year

I just use tweezers now <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And then having half your equipment be dead because why not
Hardest part is taking your hands and shoving them into the breadboard
You‚Äôd think the circuit map is the hardest part, no
Hardware level is just weird
Because half the time our chips behave really weirdly so we have to make some really janky solutions
We complain about the people who couldn‚Äôt make this simpler
You‚Äôre the one who complains about us
Basically
Yeah
Because THEN WE HAD 2048
CompE 2 we went from Assembly to C and that‚Äôs where things got not-fun
CompE 1 we learned how TTL worked (transistor-transistor Logic aka just gates) and then stepped up to Assembly
So it‚Äôs technically CompE 1 and CompE 2
It‚Äôs technically ‚ÄúIntro to Computer Engineering‚Äù
CS 1 was noobish LC-3
Oh no this is CS 2
I‚Äôve hardwired a navigation AI and it was awful
I‚Äôve written 2048 in C and it also was awful
I‚Äôve written a game (Acquire) and it was awful
See this is why I‚Äôm not in CS
It‚Äôll be fine, heiki hecchara, etc, etc
Just tell em both you‚Äôre the idiot
And no matter how well you can read each other
No matter how much synergy you and your partner have
^
Basically thing I learned
Do not be the one to ask for the breakup *unless* you legitimately want to break
Take it slow
The way to untie a complicated knot is not to immediately go in and tug at every string
You‚Äôll be fine then
Right now is not a good time to panic
First six months of relationship gf and I strangled each other over awful communication
Can confirm
Which makes no sense
Aka, the *actual dumbass*
Yeah that‚Äôs the science denier
I believe science and religion can coexist
<@!246146781832806401> hey that‚Äôs meeeeee
They think the world wasn‚Äôt founded that long ago
No not even that
Science-deniers...
Oh dear
Half of it is just ‚ÄúPaul drops sick roasts‚Äù
New Testament is fun
Lucifer refers to Satan before the fall
Because knees weak
And that was the maximum amount he could see before God was like ‚Äúokay no you‚Äôre literally going to die if you look any further‚Äù
A little part of the shoulder of God
And he only saw like
Even then Abraham nearly went blind
Stated in I think Genesis
I think kicking over the sandcastle of Babel is justified
To be fair when you‚Äôre a god who when people look directly at you they incinerate
He did something dumb I think in his quest to be God and got booted into hell for it
An angel that wanted to be god
Man of men
With a dick of lightning and balls of thunder
I think he fucked at least one tree
The god of not keeping his meat in his pants
I think one of them managed to make money, one lost some, and one just pocketed it and kept it all safe
No it was a master giving three slaves a ton of gold and said ‚Äúdo things with it‚Äù
Oh yeah that one
So God was like ‚Äúokay fine...have this guy.‚Äù
Solomon was only out in place because Israel was like ‚ÄúHEY WE WANT A KING‚Äù
And I can‚Äôt understand why anyone cites him for anything
Solomon was a dick
He also killed a man because he wanted his woman‚Äôs booty
HE IS PROBABLY LIKE THE WORST PARENT IN THE ENTIRE BOOK
NO HES NOT
Legitimately cite the man as a good example of parenting
And people
He was also the guy whose kid grew up to hate him as well as a drunk
HERD IMMUNITYYYY
Same
<@!246146781832806401> oh have I ever talked about how much I hate people who cite King Solomon as a good thing
Fuck I need this year‚Äôs flu vaccine
I uh
Some of them just deny modern medicine too
<@!193408538909868033> actually no
<@189283693557186560> I believe something‚Äôs been watching over us
The loli always carries the biggest gun
XD
We call him Chris Chan
We in fact do have a man like that in modern day
Have good day
I see
Do you scrub in between the toes
rko
Oh ok
Your feet smell
Uh
Yeah there was like a Pope he hated in there too
Imagine that
That at least gives me hope that some day the people of the future might stumble on my AO3 trash and think it‚Äôs some amazing ancient literature
Pretty much
‚ÄúAnd JOSEPH STALIN‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd TIM COOK‚Äù
‚ÄúAh yes, the one on the third layer of hell. BILL GATES‚Äù
Note that Dante‚Äôs Inferno was just full of people Dante hated
Yeah he‚Äôs the first inmate on the block
I don‚Äôt know either
You can underpay them to do work you‚Äôd otherwise have to shell out quite a bit for from professionals
There‚Äôs just tons of illegal immigrants who hang out near the fronts of Home Depots
The USA has a huge problem with that in the Mexico border area
Pretty much
Maybe that‚Äôs why it disturbs me
<@!263983345669505025> yeah pretty much
I can‚Äôt say those words in a very good conscience
Just a me thing then
Yeah but it just sounds so *wrong* you know
I‚Äôm neutral on Brexit but I can‚Äôt let that kind of stuff happen
‚ÄúHey old fucks you don‚Äôt matter‚Äù
Just
That honestly really disturbs me
And welcome to the hard place
Welcome to the rock
So you end up with weird stuff
Their entire philosophy with developing anything new is just ‚Äúthrow it at a wall, and if it sticks it sticks‚Äù
Like I said the snack market in Asia is madness
There is a snack over there that is basically just a solid block of sweet potato
BROCCOLI CHEDDAR CHIPS? YEAH TRY IT OUT SOMEONE WILL BUY IT
THE MORE TYPES YOU CAN MAKE THE BETTER
In Asia?
In the West snacks have mostly evolved to be one or two types that establish a solid brand name
That‚Äôs a cool thing about the evolution of snacks in Asia
TOTALLY NOT WEAPON <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
DENSE LEAD CORE TO ADD MASS
MAGNETIZED SOLID IRON
MEANT TO BLOCK ORBITAL DEBRIS
Easy
Just disguise it as a thing meant to shoot down orbital debris so we can explore space again
But that‚Äôs USA not England
***BE THE ONE, BE THE ONE, ALRIGHT!***
A skywall
It is a really big issue from both an ethics and economics standpoint
Gg, would re just to laugh
How to dumb
It just wasn‚Äôt meant to be
If you‚Äôve done all you can, there‚Äôs no fault in you
Lucky man
For me it‚Äôs my cousin who pretends he knows a lot but really doesn‚Äôt
There always is just that *one guy* in the family
But I think your uncle *might be a sort of bad person y‚Äôknow*
I typically don‚Äôt go and call people ‚Äúbad people‚Äù since I don‚Äôt believe there really are that many bad people in this world...
At least that‚Äôs the justification for pure rationalists
It actually saves time because then you don‚Äôt have to squeeze in with others
Holding open doors, etc
Again in the grand scale of the world‚Äôs time, saves 30 minutes as you stop the other guy from wasting time finding dropped items
In the grand scale of time though it‚Äôll save like 30 minutes
Inefficient for *you* since your wasted time is like 5 seconds
Well
Damn and I thought I could be bad about it at times
<:elfneinScared:536680597993553931>
Amazing
Everything turned out for the better!
<@!188714906143424513> Honestly just a 1:1 ratio of good/bad is pretty nice
Probably worth trying, someone apparently managed to get something similar to the g-spot experience by nudging the prostate
I thought it was the leftover prostate
Apparently a few people even managed to find a g-spot somewhere in there
I do remember reading good stories about this before on a serious note though
It can be true for all it likes but
There's no way for me to respond without laughing
I'm not sure how to respond to that
i
ngl the comment about bodyswap porn made me chuckle
If the entire family's done with it then you're pretty much good to go
He hasn't changed and probably won't change
I wouldn't say it's a bad person thing honestly
And as much as I dislike how all that is bottled up (and still to some extent, is), I don't think if I didn't have that I wouldn't have gotten as far as I am now
And even then you might still go nuclear on some people
You have to learn how to slip in a little bit of anger here and there in casual conversation sometimes, even, just to let some steam out of that pressure cooker once in a while
Sometimes it decides to rise up and boil, and you spend a few minutes calming yourself back down
It's actually not as glamorous as you'd think living and bottling up all that anger <@!302063351767498752>
(I have that emote saved on my own server as BikkiYandere lol)
<:bikkiYandere:536679571714736138>
THE BEAAAAANNNNNSSS, DUNKEK
<:kanadeHolyShit:538483508939849728>
If you try to treat me differently not because of what I've earned but because of just who I am that's the quickest way to make me blow up at you
I hate being *that guy* who expects different treatment because of haha reasons
It's not like I go and publicly advertise it as like a "please don't piss me off uwu I might have issues"
I'd rather not risk its existence
Because of genetics, the males in my dad's side of the family hurt more when they hit someone, so from a young age I was taught to keep my physical violence to a low unless if I really had to throw some hands
There's also a history of liver issues in my family so making sure my anger doesn't slip too far is also useful
Managing my anger and such was also really important because by all means the conditions of my birth should have given me some sort of bodily defect as before then my mom worked as a chemical laboratory aide and was 40 years old. That's basically prime condition to end up with a defect or something, but I came out healthy. I still don't trust that and I'm really hoping I don't have an undiscovered defect but I'm not banking on it
pls i fan
i fan
pls
That's a good wish but also one that relies too much on chance to happen <@103920342916952064>
I'm *that kind of anger*
Nowadays if something pisses me off, I get very quiet
I got time to learn how my specific breed of anger functioned
<@103920342916952064> That's something that actually gave me an advantage compared to most people with anger issues
See, I decided to instead manifest all that anger into making myself better at things I did instead of blindly take it out on others
I also played a pretty aggressive center in basketball
The former thing kind of made me toxic but also *really good at the game* so ehhhh?
I also decided to sharpen the knife and use it in video games and classwork
I did basic level martial arts for a few years, and after that I went into basketball
I at least had a handful of outlets
I think it's actually been mentioned before how currently kids really don't want to show off any talents because if they do, it's only doom for them
And that's why modern kids really don't like trying
And I just reply "I'M ALREADY DONE"
I've had more than one time where my parents barge into my room and go like "STOP PLAYING VIDEO GAMES AND STUDY"
But segue end; effort pays off. It sometimes pays off too well.
Well I stopped trying as hard in senior year and it's starting to catch up to me <:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
So they had to sort of fail their way through and learn everything the hard waay
Then come high school, I knew all the study skills that my peers didn't
So they really doubled down with me during that time to teach me not just the essentials I needed in class but also as many study skills as I could get my hands on
I wasn't very good at school in elementary/primary
See this was also kind of my parents' fault XD
My response was "They're all studying because they take two hours to finish homework when I do it in an hour"
<@183785454447886346> The excuse I was always fed was "because they're all home studying, so you should put in more effort"
There's some degree of balance somewhere in the middle
Parents gave him too much freedom so he just decided to become a dick
One of my middle/high school bullies was on the other end of the spectrum
That too
Thankfully mine wasn't
*It's real*
You know that whole tiger mom stereotype in asian culture?
I've seen worse
Oh definitely
"Go play outside" isn't an excuse
<@279341087494242304> That's the real question every parent who places restrictions like that should be asking really
Unless if homework is *really* that bad
Yeah most kids have more time than that to mess around
But hey, that's a mistake I made instead of a mistake someone else made for me
...although I missed the chance to join choir instead of band which I really wasn't that good at lol
You shouldn't ever go and run your child's life for them
<@!102691114762371072> That too
Once they hit college they don't know how to actually do things and as a result flump and squeak by
*In high school*
All my peers I've seen be rigorously controlled by their parents get pretty good grades
Not just that, your parents are making the wrong decisions in parenting
Why not just require students to comment their code instead
oh dear
Granted, Java's a great learner language since Java just lets you do stupid things like slap an "import EVERYTHING" statement on your code and it'll be like "...alright!"
(C/C++/C# are some of the cleanest languages I've used.)
(Your friend isn't wrong.)
Remember how Discord does spoilertagging for images
Yeah but that's because it's discord
"Get some therapy tho"
She told the dean her reason for flopping and the dean was like "yeah you're not kicked out, come back in"
My gf suffered huge depression for life reasons, and her grades tanked in college
You'd be surprised
Don't be too ashamed
EE/CS is just an exercise in frustration
I'd be concerned if there was <:kanadeHolyShit:538483508939849728>
Here Saki is with her 300 iq
And here I have nothing to show but the fruits of years of sweat and toil
I'm sorry what
It's one of the worst things you can tell a child
No it's not
Yeah just forget about 2008 which made all of our job prospects die
[CRASH TIIIIME]
The most unreliable thing I keep around me on a daily basis is this computer
Hell no
Like, honest to god I'm glad I sucked at first, if only so I learned things I otherwise would never have learned
Honestly I'm glad I sucked in late elementary/early middle school since doing so actually got my parents to re-think how they wanted to grind my courses and extracurriculars
Yeah I had to explain to them last term that the professors deliberately rigged a class to be super hard
I'm awful I know
Though I always keep lowballing my grades and then end of term comes and I'm pleasantly surprised
Not me loooool
And it's even worse when parents try to squeeze talents out of a kid who obviously doesn't have that talent
It's honestly really sad
That's not the worst
You would not believe how much external documentation I need to pass onto my lab partner ON TOP OF comments
Oh that's pretty normal
But once I got used to it, it was really useful once we got to megaprojects
it was awful for me for like, the first week since in HS I just never commented
That's a good habit to get them into
You'd be surprised how people see only things they want to see
Because it‚Äôs still worth a shot
They didn‚Äôt consider bomber jets
They really didn‚Äôt consider beyond muskets and cannons
Yeah
If you actually interpret the 2nd by its meaning at creation that means I should have the right to own a nuclear warhead silo
Either a powerful invasion force, or from the government turning on the people
Actually the reason why it exists is mostly founded in the fact that they wanted the civilian populace to be able to defend itself from a rogue government
Again we just need to cut out our loopholes
Nah the constitution is ok
We should start by trimming our thousand page laws down to five
Yeah
And no, anti-lobbying laws won‚Äôt help because only rich people will be able to run for office at that point
And things kinda get ugly really fast
But if you let them be too free they start forming these corporate states
You want them to be sort of free so they have space to innovate
Companies are a funny thing btw
In fact most societal change takes only 15 years
Aka around the time it takes for the next crop of kids to grow up and get out of school
However with government intervention it only takes around 15 years
Utterly infeasible
Without it yeah MAYBE it would have ended but it would‚Äôve probably taken a good millennium for society to shift
It needed government to say ‚Äúalright move along‚Äù
Good meme there
They have this silly idea that they can all live on their own private islands
They really are
Being labeled as the bourgeoise during a communist revolution sucks
Then again I am vehemently anti-authoritarian and I also tend to scrutinize new regulation because of ahhhhhhh family history things.
Yeah that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt understand the whole ‚Äúlet‚Äôs not join the union‚Äù thing
Or a large majority
Required is not
Encouraged is good
For instance you can‚Äôt teach in some states if you‚Äôre not in the union
Some places are like that
I like unions but not when they force you to join :s
It‚Äôs a solid worry ‚Äî if things get too regulated then at some point it‚Äôs really just the government calling the shots
Or so it goes (I think)
Once the government gets their hands into too many crevices, we start losing freedom
There‚Äôs reason to it
Classical liberalism is a good way of thinking
Either that or some form of ideology has shoved her head so far up here ass that she can‚Äôt see what she‚Äôs doing
That probably means she has a plan she wants to uphold
Honestly I‚Äôm tired of Theresa constantly pulling the deadline longer
It‚Äôs a little like how court cases work ‚Äî even if the verdict is obvious, arguing well enough may cause charges to be dropped or sentences reduced
no
<:bikkiScared:536679571966263345>
*coughs at his Getting Over It run*
I think this might be the point where he starts cleaning up his act a little
Kids like this guy, as much as we may find that fact annoying
I'm betting after this he'll actually watch his words a little more
It's a solid reason
Its ideas will make it to a new civilization, shaping its young roots
Oh hell no, so long as there‚Äôs one patriot still out there for a country, it‚Äôs not dead just yet
Heck even just the recession alone was felt by international stocks
And yet we‚Äôve fallen multiple times
Or BITCOINEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I‚Äôm sure North Korea‚Äôs plan is to invade South Korea and Japan though
Many of them likely pray it never does but they have the contingency ready in the worst-case
I‚Äôm sure every country worth it‚Äôs salt has a book of plans ‚Äî and one of them is ‚Äúwhat if America crashes‚Äù
So if it fails you‚Äôll just be caught with your pants down
That‚Äôs a *huge* ego
As comfy as it is to say ‚Äúwe‚Äôre too powerful to fail‚Äù
The world suffered with America during the depression
As much as we hate it ‚Äî and I do too, it‚Äôs hinging on too much ‚Äî if America flops, so does the world
The last time America‚Äôs economy died, the world died with it
And there's always like two cops patrolling that
In my area there's a road through a wide and empty park that is pretty much just a straight line, a 30deg turn, followed by another straight line
If you ever see like a van or SUV driving at *smack dab speed limit* that's probably me
god I'm scared of even driving +5 over the speed limit and that's something societally accepted
Which is the inherent biggest issue of the US education system IMO
that's how you commit fall off mountain
NO
"assume everyone around you is wholly incompetent"
Pretty much what they told me in driver's ed lol
Honestly if your girl can rock a suit, she's a keeper
God those two students really rock that uniform
Unanswered questions and all that
People are motivated to do these things because they find their own lives lacking
Nah, it's totally true
Not enough people in the world share that sentiment
"Yeah they may disagree with you but they're still people"
<@199306486940172288> Honestly that's what a lot of people just forget
My dad is super capitalist because he was on the business end of the Red Army's revolution and he ate so much shit for it
Molded by their environments
It's fine your standards will drop in college
The Lydian uniforms look so nice
Honestly I'm ok with it
I'm ok with this
So you're gonna have the Lydian uniforms
And stores in the area know to order THAT SPECIFIC THING in bulk, so business casual/formal becomes more affordable
A uniform normally provides people with some form of semi-formal thing to wear
<@199306486940172288> Honestly, you're right
Hey, you judge yourself more than you judge others
Dress uniform looks so good if you're just the right person
wait what is this implying
Then again I'm hellishly biased because I was in band for two years and I really liked staring at myself in a mirror while in full uniform
hate losing money
It takes longer for companies to lower prices instead of raise them, because lowering prices means you lose money and companies really, you know
Prices and such will eventually bounce and catch up or fall back to around minimum wage, but for 6 months to 2 or 3 years, people will temporarily either be quite content with life as they get more disposable income for those years as their wages all get increased, or be discontent as their wages get reduced
If we do we have to lower it like, pennies at a time
Yeah, we can't exactly reduce minwage very easily anymore
If the next generation is not as well equipped as ours, things blow up. Heck, we‚Äôre less well off than our previous generation because of the events during 2008 ‚Äî and we‚Äôre really feeling the drag right now
The reason why we want education reform is because once those kids grow up, they‚Äôll be taking our places. And I‚Äôd rather have a bunch of young snappers walking around strutting in my office and having way too much energy than a pile of lethargic graduates just going like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing this for the money lol‚Äù
And I don‚Äôt want to use ‚ÄúTHINK OF THE CHILDREN‚Äù as a bit of a shield for this ‚Äî that‚Äôs absurd, because that implies we‚Äôre talking about the present children
Welfare and food banks can only do so much to support every child‚Äôs growth, what we need is an education reform
But what we don‚Äôt have over now is exactly that. We have a bunch of communities where the familial atmosphere is nonexistent, and schools are made to be unappealing for children
This requires a better education, more focus on healthy growing of children, etc
Since all the smart people have jobs anyways
The thing about any new technological development is that whenever it happens, the average IQ of the world has to increase or we won‚Äôt have those new jobs
I saw robots
the heck kinda sweatpants you wearing
Also +1 on sweatpants
But no, they refused to change
And if Blockbuster modernized any amount they‚Äôd have beaten Netflix
It took years of Netflix pinning Blockbuster to the ground with their hands wrapped around Blockbuster‚Äôs throat, Blockbuster screaming bloody murder all the way to the grave
But wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if there wasn‚Äôt that ceiling over our sky in the first place
So thankfully all these things are only a matter of time before they collapse
And they ate *shit* for it
This is also contributing to an utter lack of innovation
They don‚Äôt improve, they‚Äôd rather sit tight and fire thermal lasers at every young Icarus trying to rise up with a better idea than them
Currently how they think is that they‚Äôre completely grounded in how they will only ever work like this, things should only be like this
Which also ties into how much I hate the current US corporate mentality
I have a terrible feeling that in the US those ideas are being shot down before they ever make it public
This is a sign of trial and error yes, but it‚Äôs also a sign that people are willing to consider THINGS
Not only that but innovation has stagnated here. I haven‚Äôt seen a ‚Äúrevolutionary new idea‚Äù in a long time in the US, while in our good friend across the ocean they seem to spit a new crazy theory out every week
This ends up with incompetence at the middle management and the competent but connectionless people having to struggle up the corporate ladder
We‚Äôve started to deviate from a meritocracy in work places, where now family connections are more important than actual skill level
The western world is the one underperforming
China is performing on a *normal* level
No you‚Äôre completely wrong. In a nation that has over 1 billion people, imagine the amount of manpower they can output
‚ÄúITS DEVELOPING AT A MONSTROUS RATE COMPARED TO THE REST OF US, THEY‚ÄôRE UNSTOPPABLE‚Äù or whatever
So there‚Äôs a lot of dumbasses in the US saying ‚ÄúCHINA IS THE NEXT BIG THING!!!!!!‚Äù
Banks get interested when you‚Äôre doing like 5~10k
3.4k isn‚Äôt exactly big in the scope of a bank
Brb stabbing Cerberus for its lunch money and UMP skeletons
Maybe when the weakest of the pack get weeded out they‚Äôll be more stable
We can agree though, streaming is a great thing
Yeah
That‚Äôs okay. That‚Äôs progress
They tried to innovate with their originals, they failed
They made an honest mistake trying to do something they shouldn‚Äôt have
Netflix has screwed itself, and that‚Äôs fine
25?
That sort of timeband
Maybe when I‚Äôm 25 and you all are 30ish
The event that causes America to *do cool stuff* always comes a bit later in
Although to be fair we still are in the early end of the 21st century
SO GET DASHLANE TO PROTECT YOUR- *shot*
Which for all we care is being waged in cyberspace
Another space race
We need another event that gets all of our interests collectively
So something just has to get the populace up again
Where we see some actual change for once
I wonder what event will cause a new kick start to the machine
It‚Äôs absolutely evil but it is smart
Pretty much a perfect image of the ‚Äúbuy and bomb‚Äù
-small company does very well
-EA games buys small company
-EA tells them to do some really dumb stuff
-small company fails
Or heck, the good old EA ‚Äúbuy em and bomb em‚Äù thing
Or even cause them to shut down
Typically yes, but sometimes some companies are so big they can afford to really trip up the smaller ones on the way
But they detail pretty well the rigidness of thought American companies have
Yeah
Mostly the attitudes of a nation and its industries
One tired ass rant about really random things
<@!182890099183190018> go back to sleep
There's a reason we have labor laws in modern day
Even so *stop forcing overtime*
Apparently the original source of the news has since retracted the statement, saying that he got some details wrong

North Korea
um
the last time I heard about someone being worked to death was
I'm betting it's mostly wind power though since the UK is not known for sunshine
We'll have to get a team of civil engineers checking the amount of space all the installations took as well as the pricing, but as someone who isn't exactly that much of a fan of solar and wind, this definitely has me interested in re-checking the viability of these options
This isn't some tiny little village off in some corner of the Sahara Desert that got itself a solar panel installation, it's a first world country with a big energy demand
using light energy loads
Since Britain isn't exactly known for, you know
That's actually pretty great
Once again I can't help but think it's probably the fault of marketing
Something we're doing wrong
There is something fundamentally bad about how we work in these corporate entertainment things
Which is completely backwards from every other job, you want to go for the big companies
And honestly working for an indie studio is probably the best job you can hope for as a game dev these days
I really doubt the actual coders and the artists even see that much of the profits, it probably all goes to marketing
Yeah, especially with the state of the AAA game companies
Just by that statement alone
If you declare yourself a perfect Christian you're WRONGGGGGGG
The irony: A perfect Christian would never call themselves perfect
It's a strange form of irony, the core belief. It's not "you can't have your cake and eat it too," it's "you have the cake but absolutely refuse to eat it because that would be indulgence"
I've had enough of people pushing shit on me in my life honestly
I don't care about what what you wanna do, so long as you're not running around pushing it onto me
You live your life, I live mine
stopped caring about
Live and let live is for some reason a philosophy people like
And so they went ballistic and nuked out everyone they didn't like with their cult following
And then SURPRISE, WE'RE CRAZY NUTJOBS
Drew stuff
<@437292788611153931> A few artists walked in
I still have fond memories. I was there when it built itself
it was doing so well
Those crazy radicals killed the Undertale fandom
That's the hard part
Hey you've got your resume written
For instance if you're looking for educated labor send out at least ten
Depending on what level you're trying to find at, send more out
<@!263983345669505025> From my experience with resume bullshit
I'd sleep but dungeon master duties
but it is 12:43 am
No
why the fuck am I so dizzy
They might have great designs
but second
I feel like first all the shotacons would come out of the woodwork
Honestly I want to see a magical boy
Astolfo is just typical Fate series
2016?
yeah but the rise of the animeme didn't actually kick off until like idunno
I swear it started as a slur
It started as a slur but now it's becoming this weird animeme
It's starting to mean that now, yes I think
cough cough literally every Symphogear
<@272035441312530434> It does? I know thugs of every color
Absolutely impossible to find good looking male clothes
It's less of a gripe with video game industries and more of a gripe with the fashion industry though
Female fashion meanwhile is a rainbow of amazing
-Formal and James Bond
-Casual and hoodies/whatever
-Thug
But male fashion is basically three pidgeonholes, four if you count bare-chest naked, muscle hulk
I'm one of the few lucky guys out there who can pull off an *amazing* suit
I don't like most male fashion
Can't blame them honestly
meanwhile, female fashion: ***THE WORLD IS YOUR OYSTER***
or Kirito from SAO
The only good looking males look like fucking Ichigo from Bleach
<@272035441312530434> see with the games I play
I'm still slightly spooked by my sister once joking that I could probably pull off some crossdressing cosplay stuff
I promise I'm very much on the straight male side of things
<a:blobsweat_gif:396483843688759297>
I just play females because their fashion looks better...
I um
<@284390402210136064> I just know it by the Shakespearean insult
"spaghetti" is the least of our worries
Sometimes marketing and management throws us through so many hoops
Oh trust me, sometimes it isn't on us
Their job isn't to go like "maybe that's not good design wise" anymore, their job is to sigh, take the idea, do the math, and say "yeah...guess we can do it."
Engineers just Do The Math
Engineers don't do thta
<@209036464900538371> blame it on designers actually
long pants in a room where the host doesn't understand the concept of air conditioning
Hey at least you don't have to suffer like
r/ShittyDesign
Reasons
You can nail any first impression
If you as a person in general can look good in a suit or other forms of formal wear
Pulling off a decent suit is god tier
Flannel shirts are god tier
I got a bit into male fashion when I started having to show up to job fairs and stuff
Dress up like you're worth a million dollars! Not like you're worth one!
Dammit guys! Demand better clothes!
male/female psychology goes that women just seem to like fashion more, so they sell more women's fashion
I'm sure there could be more if fashion designers try, but well
There's only like four okay male fashions out there, and one of them involves getting ripped as hell and idunno about you but these noodle arms aren't gonna become beefcakes
Still. You get it
Fine, *street.*
durr
oh
fear of private bits
You don't learn about that in the book
The Japanese believed they were some form of superposition
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futanari
That's my best curveball guess
I'm really not sure what the major significance was in it, but I think likely they were seen as higher beings of fertility or something
Ancient Japanese believed in futanari
Google gets the knife two days in a row
And people are already making clickbait content with ouija boards
But now he‚Äôs dead
He‚Äôs done some good things, he‚Äôs done some bad things
Yeah the man‚Äôs dead
Its better to have gridlock than have interest groups run every car off the bridge
It‚Äôs the most backwards way of thinking, using conflict to achieve order, but it‚Äôs this contradiction that our political systems run on
That causes citizen unrest, getting the lobbyists out of office, or hopefully having interest groups tame a little so something can get passed
If too many interest groups start throwing money and pulling strings the system gridlocks
<@!137113218173632512> the thing about democracy and republics is that they‚Äôre meant to run on a fucked up wheel like that
At least, that‚Äôs what the people who wrote our first laws believed
and never have I heard *once* about this conspiracy
I am one of them so who gives a fuck
There's one guy who has browsed like every single 4chan wiki story, there are like three who are just straight up *weird people*
I spend my time faffing around with weirdos
<@!182890099183190018> Okay
You are your own worst enemy
I want to rest but as they say
Even started sleeping less because I want more waking hours
*stays up until 12am faffing around in two different games while listening to YouTube, all at once*
‚ÄúI just wanna be tired and lazy‚Äù
<@!290431224596660224> better than the alternative (me)
I think you‚Äôre supposed to hate it
Or just a strange retelling of the French Revolution
It basically is made to illustrate the paradox of utopias
I think the series creator would be more than ok with that
But he became what he fought
By trying to create a utopia, sure he may have slaughtered the crime rate
<@189146272865845248> I think that‚Äôs the entire point of Death Note actually
*hoists up M14* YOU'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIIIIIIIVE
D:
I-I'm male
Once you understand why someone hurt you, nine times out of ten it's much harder to seek this concept of "justice"
It takes a brave person to stand up and hit their bullies back, it takes a strong person to understand why they hurt people
So don't be the one to continue that
It's just how it works
If you hurt someone, they'll go off and hurt more people
I don't think it's right, therefore, to strike back every time you're struck
Justice can easily turn into wrath
it's not a constant
"justice" is defined by what we percieve as a society at the time
As much as justice is important to us, justice in itself is a changeable concept
<@256945399338631168> You also have a point
But that's probably because I've had nothing but bad experiences with them in my early childhood
I'll be honest, dudebros suck
she's training someone

Daily reminder to eat well, sleep well

<@!246146781832806401> Field trip to Kyoto to pay respects time
I mean...is it *wrong* for a country to be a bit self-serving? A nation's entire dynamic can change based on how people feel while they live in it
Yes, like it or not...anime is modern culture
Not to mention it's a modern cultural center
...okay to be fair KyotoAni probably does wonders to the Japanese GDP, losing them is a terrible thing
<@152896851660505088> wait so the *Japanese Government* is stepping in to try and do their best to help
<@!400844698140409856> cursed name
Yes
It‚Äôs even ‚Äúcuter‚Äù
<@113071228113162240> it‚Äôs cute like Symphogear
God now every time I look at Bondrewd I feel like if I remove his mask I‚Äôll find Doctor VEEEEEEEER screaming at me
Best dad
with bestmom
it's an adorable children's show that talks about the wonders of exploring mysteries
<@122102398108827653> what are you talking about
I'm considering watching Yuuki Yuna is a Hero soon, should I do it
Even better MHA didn't make it on the list
So cool how Violet Evergarden got nominated for Best Anime OTY
Sadly michishirube didn't make it on the Best ED list
And Violet Evergarden's ED is so good
Pretty much
So people won't go towards it because less PAWNCH and EXPLOSION
Sadly it's not a hot-blooded Shonen from what I see, it's a show about something a little more simple
Yeah, the art is absolutely beautiful
I haven't personally watched it but the soundtrack is so nice
I'm glad Violet Evergarden got an art award though
That too
AND THATS WHY I WATCHED SYMPHOGEAR.
hardly as popular as the spam of isekai though
I want my shonens and shojous back
let us move onto something better
please kill the isekai genre of anime already
"this...is gonna mostly be for the slime gag right."
Because I looked at it and I was like
Yeah that's why I just never wanted to watch it
<@256945399338631168> that's just the issue with the modern isekai trend tbh
"ITS OK IM A SLIME"
To be fair no one expected this show to explode
It started off as one man's "hey I'll try this out" and blew up to 4 seasons, 5th in the pipe, a mobile game, and assloads of waifu merch
To be fair Symphogear was kinda like that
You've already got a DecaDriver? BUY ANOTHER
Let's show cool stuff to SELL  MERCH
Kamen Rider and all the toku series are the same
Yeah, with the flood of AXZ merch
visually appealing characters
*ahem*
yeah so we have all these super uhh
*DVDs and Blu-Rays
<@256945399338631168> *Hikarunara gently plays in the background*
Did you mean: Your Lie in April
Slice of Life
I just don‚Äôt know when
I know things will go to hell
Somewhat blind
Watched 2 episodes of Yuki Yuna last night. Conclusion: Despite not being as high-octane as Symphogear, it has its own brand of badass, and more importantly still tries to save time to develop the universe.
yeeaaaahhhhh
wake up burning

They went back to the dumb sounding standby music
I‚Äôm not happy with Zi-O Trinity
I can‚Äôt believe Kamen Rider‚Äôs become Symphogear with the skill cut-ins

Imagine when she gets to high levels and how weird her combos are gonna get
She actually built very rudimentary combos which all chain off of Paralysis
She clearly isn't the regular noob who just goes for big number
She seems really good at macrostrategy (aka keep yourself alive, use what skills when, how to be the most effective you can given a limited set of abilities)
I can however appreciate how Maple plays
Nowadays whenever I open an MMO I try to go the fastest I can and if there's a speed cap I just become sad and instead troll the AI
I love her kind of high speed build, especially if it comes with crits
