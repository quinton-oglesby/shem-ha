Well I just though to ask is all.  All I can do.
Kanade's color is vermillion, #e34234.  It's a darker orange / red / scarlet image.  The current one is #ff5c14, which is more of a deep pumpkin color.  Her name is Winglet.
Greetings.  I'm here to request a custom color me code for my favorite Symphogear character.  I noticed she is not in the listings.  Normally I'd like to have Kanade's color, but she's using it right now. Kanade would normally be the vermillion color and my favorite character to be Kanade's current color, but I can take the vermillion color if it's easier that way. Thank you.
Their official colors are: 
Yumi: Apple Blossom
Ando: Steel Blue
Terashima: Tacha
I mean, she's seen as too unmemorable now.  So I just have to create enough fan art, manga pages, story, etc. for her to become more well known.  It could take a year, but that's fine.
To ask again I mean.
I have fan art that I'll be contributing (some already posted now in the fan content section).  Even if not now, eventually I'll have enough, so that maybe in a later date, when the art circulates around, she'll be more memorable.  Next year though of course.
I might consider doing something, but I'm: 1) too much of a Kiri brain to even know how to join interest groups (that's why you don't see me in any of them), 2) there's be no surprise in guessing who did that artwork since they'd recognize the style and a certain character in the drawing, even if other characters are present, and 3) my schedule is variable and can be limited, so monthly might not be feasible.  It says low-pressure in writing prompts for example, but somehow I still get the idea that I'd have to turn in something monthly.
Do these reference images work?

One possible icon set could be the hair clips, scrunchies, hair detail, or whatever hair / head accessories the various girls uses.
It adds the additional decoration without having double avatar.  They work very small as well since faces would have some issues in quality.
One thing I do request though is adding a Winglet role.  She actually does have a hair accessory of her own.
Are hot dogs that appealing?

Again with another user?
It's a compromised account. Don't touch it.
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Oh no, do I have to redownload those graphics brushes to design those textured, metallic, stylish banners again that you saw in forums where you would win internet points for making people those banners?
Hello
<:ShirabeSleep:691497302535176302>
It was intentional.  I wanted to sneak in early like that so it would feel like a teenager sneaking into the house late at night without anyone waking up.
Thank you all.
<:SerenaWorry:795904245513715712>
Guess everyone is waking up now.
Thanks for the welcome.  Just a non-suspicious little chef wandering in during the late hours when everyone is asleep.  Don't mind me.
So keep up the work on that as well. I'll look forward to seeing what else you do in the next update.
Being able to do expressions is also important. Conveying emotion can make a big difference.
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Well funny reaction images can also be popular, so that's another way to get likes.
<:RoosterletHappy:859557459970097196>
Good job though on the art.
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
It's because I'm far more a NSFW artist than SFW artist, so it's what I would be more critical of since it's easier to get away with lesser detailed clothing, but skin generally has to look nice to avoid looking like a beginner from various people. I can give the thumbs up on the skin shading.
Well yeah, I draw a lot of things I don't really care for since I do it for building connections with others.
<@134296520273952768> 

I seem to be going everywhere today.
Well let's see.
Immediately after looking at your gallery, the NSFW content is what pops up. Now personally I don't have much favor with muscle girls, but don't worry, I'll put my personal tastes aside and review as the art itself.

It is easily the most impressive of the arts. I say this since the skin is well detailed far beyond an intermediate level. It's actually quite important here since there are so many height variations on the skin due to the muscles, that a soft shading style is pretty much how you'd have to go to really cater to that crowd and fully display the details. The alternate lightings and skin pigments are a nice touch as well to give to people as different options as some prefer lighter or darker skin tones. I know as I've made different versions in the past with alternating skin tones.
The next one that jumps to me is the elf with the braid. The level of detail on the hair is actually quite nice. Some people would make the braid detailed while going easy on the rest of the hair, but no, you put detail and various hair layers all throughout.
Just keep working at it. It's nice to see the progression of your art from the 1st one to the current ones.
Yes Ikxi, there is Miku Ignite in XDU.
Now to see what ||Serena will do with Amalgam since she's OP.||
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Thanks a bunch, Tony and Nuker, for thinking of me.  Always nice to revisit those lanlanlap colorings.
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
But yeah, since you all brought this up again, I'll repeat myself. If people keep posting the same type of content that people should know by now that I really react negatively towards that was posted at the beginning of the week in the Symphogear Discussion channel, then it'll just serve to keep me away from there.  As long as that content is avoided, I'll happily return.
Cute, vampire, and deserves the bread stolen from her by that dog.
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
This is a safe vampire.  Only fights similar grade angels.  The kids are safe.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I don't know hence why I said in general.  If they do, then I'll loathe them.  If they don't, then it's fine.  I think I need to show a safe vampire then to show what I mean.
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I don't dislike vampires in general. I abhor child murderers.
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>

Oh alright  Nuker.
<:basathink:823212165494079528>
It's those symphogear screenshots of certain scenes that people kept posting that did me in.  So many screenshots to choose from, yet they keep posting from that particular concert.
The emotions vary between the characters of NR.
Millaarc from Symphogear, Challenger from ID: Invaded, Gabriel Miller from SAO, Champ from Akame Ga Kill!, etc., etc.
These are the types of individuals that make my blood boil.  So much so, it overshadows what the others do.
It's fine, I'll explain if it helps clear some things up.
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
Don't worry Star, I enjoy that Serena artwork. Thanks for the hard work.
She gets the Hermes' Sword.
Yeah unless you find a paste bin or Youtube link, you'll have to wait. I know quick summaries are made when the events air, but people don't always save them. It's where one of the girls in the 5 girl image I showed the other day comes from. Like Maria and Serena, there were another sister pair, Jeanne and Mel, who were taken in my FIS.
It's the event where Maria gets her duo relic.
Uragiri no Cadenza
Argos' Eye relic.
It's not really a good thing to have equip, but to say more is spoilering.
<:RoosterletHappyZoom:859557459970097196>
Thanks again for showing me that. Always nice to look at a picture of my older sister and me.
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
I read the artist's text and am glad he thinks about heaven as well and their happiness.

Also mac, since that new memoria where Kanade talks about her sister, I wouldn't be surprised if we get more art eventually.  I shared Roosterlet art with that artist already and my Winglet art with Hisashi and Urakata already.  I'm just glad that I'm not the only one that cares about these girls' happiness.

A good pairing for AU Basa might be Millaarc (non violent one at least).
Prime Basa upholds duties and orders very highly.  
Au Basa basically said the orders can go F*** themselves.
Even later on hung up on a superior, despite knowing there would be consequences later, because it was interfering with her date with AU Chris.
AU Chris is a proper lady.
AU Basa's personality is very different than Prime Basa's.  
Same with both Chris's. 
Deep down, there are similar fundamentals though.

One very important person to me survived the anime plot.
The anime fixed one critical part that the manga did, so in that sense, at least the anime did one thing to redeem itself in my eyes.
If you can figure out what that is, then you know me really, really well.
Anyway, away I go for now.

Ghost hug is always very nice to see.  Very glad they acknowledge all the different versions of the character, even the dead ones.  Minimum 4 Basas after all.
It's easier to refer to the small one as Kiribot and the large one as Kiridroid.

Prime Bikki's progression is different enough to separate her from Anime Bikki's progression.  
Dan (artist) also distinguishes between the 3 of them as well.
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
He likes to reference old media from decades ago, so it's helpful if you have some prior background knowledge about that.
For example in an earlier comic, terms like "the perfect lifeform" (referencing Ultimate Kars) will be lost on you unless you knew about that knowledge from JoJo beforehand.
Though since Kaneko likes to reference old things as well, that's just all the more to get acquainted with old media in some way.
That's the 3rd version XDU title screen.  There was a later one released with the AXZ alchemists to the right of Kiri.  Unfortunately whoever saved that had the low res settings in the game and unless someone saved the original asset background when they datamined it somewhere, then it'd be lost.  That was a long time ago though since we're now past the 47th XDU title screen.

Maria got sick trying to do too much to prepare for the Christmas party.  The others are obviously worried as Maria is sick in bed.  While in bed, Maria gets her hand out from under the covers to pat her sister's head to let her know that she'll be fine if she rests up.

O and don't mind why Jii is wearing just Ogawa's shirt in the other image.  That's not important.

Thank you for posting the Roosterlet art.
By XV, it was too late.
Yes, a big issue is that I've seen a good number of people who didn't even know there was a global version of XDU when end of service of it was announced.
Many Japanese fans know of and read XDU and even global players experienced Kanade's 1st and 2nd main story events, which built up a lot of her character.
It's not just the memoria.
Had Discotek distributed the anime a lot sooner, maybe there would have been more global players.
<:TsubasaDere:768545990495961129>

I dunno.  They should have just given me a Winglet player icon.  I would have never removed it for the rest of the game's service unless she also got playable units.
I think I saw a pin of Stephan one time for sale.
A shame I have to actually create tangible content of Winglet since I don't even see one for sale.  
Even that pestering officer from XV who took command of the submarine had an XDU player icon added.
I want both Winglet and Roosterlet to be added.
I know, I know.  Don't worry, since I'm in the Kanade mode lately, I know I should make some Amou sisters artwork soon.  It'll give me time to practice more of her hairstyle.
You wouldn't be the only one.  I've seen her compared to Miku several times.  Almost like a Miku type character, like how Winglet is a Basa type character.
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I have my own as well you know.  Though yeah I should make an exclusive Amou sisters only artwork too.
She won a raffle ticket or something like that.  She later on noticed Serena, because she sometimes comes to visit.
Talking begins.  Etc.  Now they are squishing grapes and thus the birth of Serena and Bikki feet custom made wine is born.
Serena then is thankful since she has a gift to give to her big sister now.

If I didn't go after Kaneko personally yet, why would I go after MiHoYo for something less?
Thank you all.
I am managing, Melua, using all my sick days and vacation for now.  Right now it is not at an unreachable level.  As of right now the surgery is still on schedule.  I've yet to see how that will go and what will  happen later on.  If... If I find, I honestly get stuck at a standstill, then yes, I will accept the help at that that time.  
RIght now, I can give her the care she needs for now.  We'll see what happens after the surgery at the beginning of the year.
Thank you, Melua.
Right now I just want to be with my mother, since I'm already dreading the say of the surgery, to see if her body will be able to withstand it or not.  I fight back and forth in my mind.  The only way I'm not breaking down completely is that I was somehow and for some reason there when she fell.  Even if I should have gotten her out of that situation years ago, I was at least there.  It's little comfort, but I'm still full of guilt.

I wrote this message to not only explain to those that might care, but to get some things off my chest as well.

I'll be off now.  It took me many hours to write this and I'm not in the mood to answer much. I'm on a leave of absense and though I hope to eventually get better, I am putting my thoughts and prayers into my mother having the strength to endure these challenging times for  her.  I don't know what will become of my Twitter account, whether I can get it back, but right now, I can't be bothered to put much thought into it.

If reading this helped answer any questions, then I'm glad for that.  I hope everyone has a wonderful holidays and happy new year when it comes.
My mother needs surgery, but they can't operate on her until she gets over Covid first, which will already be a challenge due to all the compounded things she has as well as myself not being the best caretaker, especially being sick myself.  

I don't want to be a worthless $1700/month game spender in front of her and just want to spend the time I have with her for the rest of this year, to at least finish that in some spirits.  It's already a challenge to get better from Covid with her trauma in her body from the fall and broken bones, but the worst is the surgery she'll need on her arm.  Complications are the bane of existences.  I worry so much if she can withstand even more stress right now.  I know time is being bought right now, but at around the same time as her birthday, she'll have to go back to get the surgery done. All my spare money is going to her right now.  I can't think of worthless expenses at this moment.  I may peek at social media every now and then and onto the game to read up on some things, but then I quickly go  back to the important matters at hand.

I know the hospital didn't quite treat her as well as I had wished.  I learned they had given her breakfest, but when she asked for help, they didn't hear her and when it was lunch time and she told them of the circumstances, they just brushed it off and said it was time for lunch and threw the breakfast in the trash.  Unacceptable level of care.  I almost wanted to donut the staff, but then realized I would have become everything I ever hated if I did, thus I stopped myself.  Strangers; family. Fuck these categorizing words.

At this moment, I just won't be around much.  I am not who I am.  I don't know if that person will return.  I, who I was, am on hiatus for now.  I may lurk at most, but that'll be the mainly what I do, for the future.
I fought to regain myself and just started try to breathe normally again.  I put my hand out at them, as if to say I was ok, but didn't look at them.  I could hear nails scratching on wood.  I looked over and saw my mother look at me.  Without saying anything, she looked at me to say it was ok. She couldn't reach over to me due to her injury, so she was just getting my attention in the way she could. I imagine talking much would have hurt her at this point with her own coughing at the time.  It is like fate is always testing me, to force me to love only my mother and disregard everything else.  I'd sooner die than let that happen.  I will not be a weak human.

We all manage to get through it and after they diagnose my mother and find she has Covid, they put her in a wheel chair and I have to leave since Covid patients can't have visitors.  Had to keep ignorning my own condition.  After leaving all my information, I leave the hospital, coughing like crazy as I make my way to the parking lot and then to my car.  I sit down and let things process.  I don't feel well and beat myself up mentally for this mess.

I somehow make it to my mom's place since it's closer and in the same part of the state.  I mentioned that she is a spiritual person.  So I gather pictures of figures important to her, find pictures of her to put them across the figures and leave an overhead lamp to illuminate them over night.  I did not want her to be in that dark that evening, at least in some sense.  I don't sleep all that well that night due to my worry.  Eventually in the afternoon, around 3, I get the call that she is ready to be discharged.  I rush over and have them bring her over in wheel chair, so that I may put her in my car and drive off back to her place.

Then every day since then has been me trying to care for her in my own clumsy way, despite being sick myself.  I'm quite broken inside.  I haven't paid much attention to my social media, games, parasitic gacha, etc.  I put in my retired status on Monday.  Then last night I find someone stole my Winglet Twitter account and all these fun things are happening in the game, but I absolutely can't.
I could have bought myself and my mother our own fully paid for houses in a far, far less expensive place to live had it not been for my wasted money.

As soon as morning came, I took my mother to the emergency room to the hospital.  As I thought, after filling up paper work with her basic work insurance and such, the total wait time ended up being about half a day as I had anticipated.  It is one thing to know in the back of your head; it is another to see it in person. I can see so clearly now why people have died in the waiting room.   For 12 hours, I did what my inexperienced self did to help care for my mother as we waited in the room, with her occassionally going back and forth.  The X-Rays revealed she had fractures on her right humerus and additional testing shows she had Covid as well.  It is one thing for a fool like myself to have it, but it is different for her. Her age, her frailty, her exhaustion from working the usual X-mas rush.  To be tired, to be sick, to have trauma, and to have broken bones.  I could not state my own condition since I wouldn't be allowed to be in the hopsital, but I'd soon let myself get shot by hospital security than leave her with people I didn't trust.

The situation was far worst on my mind than I had imagined.  For many, many hours, I sat between various groups of people.  At one side was a middle age women who was crying and wimpering the whole time with pain as she waited for hours on end like us to get treated.  On the other side, was a little girl that looked like she was having trouble breathing.  I saw my mother's sad, weak face as she looked at me. My own almost about to tear up again.  I had gotten cloth and started wrapping it around my head and mouth.  I covered my mother's as well, gently, while covering where she breathed with my own body.  

I knowingly knew that I was putting others in potential danger by leglecting to mention my own situation.  I still had not confirmed my mother's Covid status, but still covered both of us the same from other people.  A sick test where the so called correct answer is to put my own familia before everyone else.  Not only did my own sickness had to deal with my trauma over my life choices, but now it's dealing with trauma over the current circumstances at the hospital.  I started to hyperventilate.  The little girl and her mother growing a tad concerned, wondering what was going on.
Regret and shame started to fill me.  

I had worked hundreds of hours a week to gain decent money, but it would all just go to trash like gacha and collecibles.  Living in a place with a high cost of living was already stressful enough, but also acting elite also adds onto that.  I don't have connections in life, but the one I still had, was still my mother.  I underestimated my foolishness.  I had no money saved up for true emergencies.  I did not consider myself to be worth building up for emergencies and thought I would just brute force any of my own situations with my anger that had kept me afloat for many decades.  I failed to prepare for the one flaw in my plan: that being my mother is someone worth it and I should have saved for. 

I had no money saved up to pay for the future expenses of calling 911.  Not even saving for myself, of course I had nothing for others.  My mother would then just grab my hand and shake her head no, as in to not call.  She had trouble breathing.  I then, after a course of 10 minutes, slowly picked her up and put her on her bed.  As much as I wanted to take her to the hosipital, I knew the truth of it all.  The wait times in the emergency room where I'm at are reported to be the worst in the nation, despite the US already being notoriously bad in terms of health care.  I knew without money, I'd have to wait in the hospital room for half a day or so along with my mother.  Reluctantly, I had to settle for having her sleep in her room for the night.  Her voice had gotten so weak and with a light wimpering as well.  It reminded me of Yoda's wimpering (from Star Wars) before  he had died.  

It was at this point, with myself on the floor, next to her bed frame, that I start to break down.  I had only ever cried 2 times in my life before. That Monday made it my third.  I regretted the money wasted on figures.  I regretted the money wasted on video games.  I regretted the money wasted on lavish restaurant food.  I regretted the money wasted on hentai.  I regretted the money wasted on gacha.  
I regretted my flaw to being unable to enjoy something unless I strive to be the best at it. I regretted being unable to just buy my mother a house without any dangerous design flaws and lack of safety features, despite with my initial skepticism of that stair design from years back.  I even had thoughts of regretting to watch Symphogear and other anime that just murders children and dares try to justify it, despite myself already knowing it's something that stays with me. I knew how I am. I should have never finished all those anime that had those elements and dropped every single one of them.  I should have just kept with happier things instead of letting these things control my life.
I came over that Sunday morning.  I noticed she was a bit sick, but as I've known her to take a lot in the past, despite my worries, I could only reluctantly just be ok with her going to work. Sunday passed with no incident.  Monday came, before going to work, I noticed a stronger cough to her voice, but again, she insisted on going to work still.  It's not as if I couldn't do the same myself; it's just that at my stage, I have to actually get fully better before doing so.

My mother went to work.  I just stayed in bed all day again.  She had texted me to go and buy some food for her to eat when she gets back late that evening.  She knows I'm still stubborn enough to go pick up food for myself to eat, so she wanted me to pick up some for her.  I haven't actually been eating solids lately, but I could still pick up something for her.

That monday late night soon arrived. I was sleeping, as much as I could anyway.  I heard the keys turn and door open.  Then the worst happened.  A few seconds later, I heard a large slam onto the floor and a large cry of pain coming from my mother.  

I never felt such a sudden rush of cold sweat appearing on my body at once and fear coming at once.  Immediately afterwards, in darkness, I sprung out of bed as fast as I could, falling down face first onto the ground, in my panic, but still pulling myself up and running to the door, not caring about my current condition.  I soon immediately stopped once I heard a soft "wait" from her as well and soon realized I was almost on top of her.  I soon turned on the light and saw her on the ground on her right side.  To say I was panicking was an understatement.  I asked how did this happened, but she wouldn't answer me.  I tried to softly pick her up, but even this caused he great pain.  Still panicking, I looked around and froze when I realized my idiocy at not realizing what had happened.  She lives in a room in a house and when coming in, you had to take a step upwards, which is where the door lays on and then two steps downwards immediately afterwards to come inside the room.  A lost fear I had, had happened, she has finally tripped on those small stairs when centering inside, especially since it's dark when coming inside.  It was late, midnight, after her long day at work.  Normally she'd still be fine, but then I realized the big issue: she was also quite sick as well and still went to work.  I'm reminded of my circumstances of last week where I kept pushing myself to go to work despite being sick and almost paying for it by almost falling down and hitting myself hard on the ground to almost spit out blood.  I could catch myself.  My almost 73 year old mother was another story.
Ok, this is going to be a general message that I'll link people to, to make it easier to explain my circumstances.

I haven't been online much at all since the afternoon of Monday, December 13th.  There is a reason for this.  I have been sick since last week.  I'm actually gettin worst in health progressively.  Regardless if it were Covid, that still wouldn't be enough to actually kill me.  I've survived many things due to my blazing anger at life.

The main issue here comes that my mother learned of my worsening health.  She lives alone and in a little tiny place.  She never wanted much in life and is a very spiritual person.  I pressed at it in the beginning, but couldn't really get her to budge in the end with accepting more, so I just let it be as it is and just gifted a bit every so often.  

It would come to be that I would later come to regret my lack of vision.

Less than 2 weeks remaining until my mother turns 73 (1/1 birthday), other than my own situation, things seems to be going ok.  She invited me to get better at her own place.  I was weary because I didn't want to sicken her with whatever I have.  I tried to sleep with the covers on my head.  She keeps working full time and keeps active.  She's actually quite small and not really all that strong, so keeping active is pretty mandatory for her.
This is going to be a lot.  After this, I'll be away for an unknown amount of time.  Might still lurk, but I'll downgrade in presence significantly for the time being.  I spent hours writing this, so I'll be copying and pasting the passages bit by bit.  Please no interruptions until I say my final bit of wishing everyone a happy holidays and new years at the end.
Thank you Hal.  Your words mean  a lot.
Read all your comments.  Thank you all so very much for your concern.  I do notice something like a panic attack every so often.  I generally have to get on a knee while it passes.  I am doing what I can.  I'll head back now to doing what I have to do for the day and take naps if I can afford to do so.  Thank you all again.
Thanks for your concern, solopy.

Thank you Zephrys.  Your words mean a lot.  I'm happy to receive all of this support from so many people.  I'm glad you and your mother were able to get through it all.  Yes I hope we can all make it through this as well.
Anyway, I'm going back to caring for my mom. I'll answer your other part of your response later, Bern.
I forgave those involved in those conversations, but if I'm ever messed with like this again, I will leave permanently.

I almost left this server because of that event some months and that feeling still exists if people feel they want to press too deeply into this subject. I will choose my immediate family over online friends here if I feel I'm in danger by being here by overly investigative people. I lost a big friend here by him being the middle man in this mess from some time back that eventually led to issues down the road.
Of course, there are many minute parts in these big processes.  I'm not that good of a multi-tasker, I will be doing them bit by bit and one at a time.
I'm surprised myself.  I know some people here in this Discord had investigations going on to try to find out if I was a p---ph--- and potentially have me banned.  All because some other person was found to do the same and they were banned, so somehow I came under investigation because I liked loli and potentially did other things.  I'm not going to say the people involved, even though I know who they are since their anonymity was compromised since I could still see parts of their crossed out names in leaked chats.  I did a overlay match of every single member here to find out exact matches. 

So yes, I should be weary, but... I'm just too tired to put up defenses at this point.  I just want to burn away all this hatred in my heart, not add onto it.  Forgiveness is another thing I have to practice more of, after all.
My mother regrets having raised me in this country.  She says she would have preferred to have done so back in the farm and the peace and quiet of her country.  ...Thinking on it, perhaps that might have been the right decision.  My cousins and such are all much happier people.  Ignorant, but quite happy people.  Maybe I wanted to be ignorant as well.  In this country, all I've ever felt was the suffering that CAPITALISM brought me and my immediate family and felt that if I were to survive that I would have to win over my enemies with brute force.  During the way I must have lost some of my heart in doing so.

It's just another reason, later in life, I learned more to care about my fellow companions in this rat race rather than trying to use and abuse to get to the top.
Bit by bit I was changing, but I was still far from a decent person.  I find myself in the pattern of also hating my past selves as well.

This incident is a real slap to the face and has given me time to think a lot since I'm not at work and am sick at home, with having to take care for another now.

All I can feel now is... exhaustion.  It's like I've been running full blaze speed ahead for so long and now that fatigue is hitting me at full force after so long.  I mean, most of my hair is gray and that's all from stress in my life.
It's almost like I need a break from... technology and this country.  

Well anyway, I've ranted on enough.  I didn't expect to say all of this.  I guess I opened up since you did.
Yes Bern, deep down, in reality, I'm just a broken person.  I'm like the father from the movie Blow (2001), that also mistook the words of "Money not being real" and tried to do what he could to avoid going down the poor path of his parents and all that suffering that came from growing up.  I'm in that downward spiral as well.  I'll be honest, had I not gotten some control earlier in life, I might have ended up like Vegas mass shooters or someone of a similar path.  That's how much anger I have in me.  Slamming myself into chipping myself, I could divert my energy into far less chaotic means and get away from Shinobu Sensui levels of absurdity.  I had to.  I hated the evils of humankind.  Who I was in my late teens / early 20's was far too dangerous a person and I had to quarantine myself for years to calm down by working 15 hour a day / 7 a week shifts to burn off my energy to avoid ending up in jail.  During off times from work, I had learned to appreciate art more and more to get to where I am now.

Thanks for sharing your story.  I don't know where my 10x Akira father is at right now or how many brothers and sisters I must have by now.  No question it's far past 10 by now.  O well.  

Gacha, like many things, just turned into another corrupted reasoning for many things that I do: to bring about change through brute force. Had money been a means of gaining status in Discord, I would have simply bought out this discord and other servers with brute force like I had done many other things, like companies buying out other companies. I didn't even question the thought of single handedly holding 50 server boosts for just one discord server at one point.  Competition in other venues like gacha kept my mind from focusing on that aspect though.  I actually just canceled 5 server boosts in another place that I had just forgotten about for months on end and didn't do anything with it.  I was just too lazy to cancel such a small amount at the time, but now with the situation as it is, I can't afford to throw money like that now.

Instead of just working on building good relationships and finding other means, I used excuses to want to evoke change into something I thought brought harm, even if it means burning my mind and body in the progress.  Some people in other servers were initially scared of me since they figured I'm just an uncontrollable tempest.  I assured I wasn't, that I was controlled by focusing in my art, but perhaps they were right about me.  

I look at Y-san from Chiba who influenced Nisekoi and thought "Well of course if he can do that, then why the hell couldn't I do at least as good at that?  I too can influence an entire fandom."  Even to this day I get message for requests from my past successes in fandoms from years on back.
However, the real answer comes to bite in the end.  I'm not living my life alone.  My destructive way of life will burn not only myself, but others as well.
Thank you Fenny for your words.
Everyone's words.  I may not have said everyone's names, but I do truly appreciate every single response given out.  
I'm not taking these days with my mother for granted and am doing what I can at the moment.
Thanks again everyone.
I concur.  Fuck my country.  This is the only country where I can wake up from a 4 hour nap to read up on more nauseating news that makes me shed tears on a constant basis around the year due to how often certain event occurs.
<:ShirabeChibi:698939825155473499>
I should be playing it safe, but I'm not, so I know I'm a fool for what I'm doing.
Always keep your interest in learning.  Also have goals in mind.
I'd probably be better off, but I just didn't really strive for anything, so I just coast at a lower level than what I should probably be at.  O well, such was my state of mind for so long.
Whatever can help you stay out of the bottom of the ladder.
That's why it's better to learn how to operate complex machinery if you can.  Even in the car part shop, if you can learn to use forklifts like you know who, who just got his license recently, it helps out.
Yeah
<:SerenaWorry:795904245513715712>
<:ShirabeChibi:698939825155473499>
Young people these days just don't want to work.
This was all me.  I didn't have them help.  I wanted them to understand that I wasn't someone that just said without actually getting my own hands dirty.

Well anyway, after I scolded the people in their 20's, I went out and fixed the stack and then made them take pictures of it and said if I keep seeing their incompetence, then I'd have to take higher action.
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Always having to scold these teens and 20 year olds.
I had to call them all over and pretty much say what in the heck they were doing.
See how dumb this is?  This is what people do in warehouse jobs.

Now I said this earlier in general, but I also work in car part warehouses.  Mostly to overview.  The shipping team are quite... bakayaro...?
I know they don't care, but they still have to give the appearance of caring.  
For example, they can't even stack a pallet of boxes properly.
Let me pull up the picture.  Give me a sec.
Yeah, the hell with delivery.  It's not fun.
Though I might from time to time have to go operate the Kolbus machines. Those are German built machines and though I don't primarily have to keep in contact with them, I do from time to time.
I know management don't want to do that, so I just do it for them.
I have to keep in contact with the Israelis (machine was built there).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gQa5g6r9E
Nobody wants to really learn how to do much of the experienced work in various warehouses.  
I like my temperature controlled pressroom.
I usually just hang out running these:
Presswork isn't the worst thing in the world and I get to be mostly left alone as long as my production numbers meet the quota.
I mean I pretty much can do all the work in the warehouse, but I usually want to stay alone in my section.  Though that's not always the case and I have to help other people that don't know what they are doing since they hire a bunch of inexperienced people at times.
24/7 operation and there are only two shifts.  Since I know a lot, I generally have to stay to help out both shifts, with the extra hours depending on what each day brings.
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
12-18 hours a day.  Depends on how the day goes.
It's awful, but gives me job security.
My schedule is Friday - Monday, all day long. I specifically do all the days and hours and responsibilities that no one wants to do.
Ah yeah, those poor Fed Ex express drivers are stuck there while they wait for every single express package.  Sitting there until the very last minute with workers having to get that very last order done and onto the truck before time runs out.
<:ShirabeChibi:698939825155473499>
Warehouses are awful places to work in.  Remember, I have to work on holiday Sundays being the only one in the building, which not only grossly violates OSHA regulations, if anything were to happen to me, that's too bad for me.

As for production, that's why I took those classes that cost tens of thousands of dollars to be fully trained and certified to run high experience machinery like press machines or other complicated equipment and more importantly, how to do maintenance work on them.

You can't very accurately judge how long it will take to fix something, when parts will arrive, and more importantly, management aren't going to know anything about repairs, so it's easy to bullshit them, and as such, it helps make things much easier.

If are you are the bottom line though and can only do something that a machine can do better, then yeah, you more than likely don't want to be there.
Just always have situational awareness.  Many people seem to lack this for some reason and I see them get hurt because of it.
You do look out ahead though, so you are already well off some other people just for that.
Stay safe on the flight.
<:ShirabeSleep:691497302535176302>
Ok good night.  I've taken up a  lot of the serious discussion time, so I'll go for now.
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
The way I see if, I'm generally someone that expects to receive the best of services only because when I was a teenager and in my 20's, I worked my butt off to provide service for customers as well.  I wouldn't ask for something I myself wouldn't give at least for what I'm asking for.  It's why when I ask someone to do something, they know I also did what they did and worst in the past.  That's the issue with a lot of the management; they didn't actually gain the respect of the workers by being in the battlefield with them. 
It's partly why people want me to be management, but I dun wanna.  Haalp, save me.
It helps to have played games like Tetris in the past.
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
No they won't.  I specially crossed the boxes between horizontal and vertical on the x and y axis.  Also overlaying them on multiple boxes to increase stability and maximizing friction.  I jabbed the stack in front of the workers and it didn't budge.
<:SerenaWorry:795904245513715712>
Yes, but the couriers have to be able to use a pallet jack to pick up the pallets and put them in the truck.
I don't think they'd be able to do that in the "before" image.
<:ElfneinBashful:853855675573338152>
I mean I waste the vast majority of my money on gacha.
I mean I remember one week some years ago, I was on crutches when I had to work the presses.  Real annoying having to use crutches to lift yourself up platforms without slipping and falling over.
I know.  It'll take much longer to fully heal.  I might just request to do  the tedious computer work if I can arrange for that.  If.  I may just have to turn into an average employee than what I normally do.  Hopefully they can understand that.
<:ShirabeChibi:698939825155473499>
That's my story for today.
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
Hopefully. Feels like my leg is in an oven.
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
I'll just have to let the injury heal. I'll just rest up for 3 days. I just won't bother with the second job this week is all.
<:serenaworry:796916546202107975>
Nah, no report. I don't have work insurance.
By request
CW: Don't read. There's some blood and injury involved.
|| As per usual at work, people left their trash on the dock. Broken pallets, jagged metal pierces, broken containers, shink wrap, etc. Annoyed as usual, and as someone that is always cleaning up after others, I begin cleaning the mess up. Picking up the broken pallets and walking down the stairs onto ground level to then neatly toss them onto growing piles. I do similar with the metal and other items. Often times there are various greases that people spill, but those are easy to see. It's those dried almost invisble oils and greases that are harder to spot.
On docks, at dock bays, are the platforms that you can extend to connect with the trailer. In between there is a hole, so that it is separated from the main platform. As I was cleaning, I was picking up medal pieces and as I cleared that part, I failed to see the grease on the exposed floor next to the hole, slipped, and had my right leg fall in that hole along with other metal parts that fell in as well. It was hot, so everyone had short sleeves and shorts on. Hmmm, it hurt.
I keep myself on the dock with my left arm supporting myself by pushing myself upwards to attempt to counterbalance. I then push hard enough to lift my body out of that and from falling off the dock.
I keep quiet, but I can definitely feel my face and leg as if they were on fire.
Seconds later, the visiting district manager was just passing by parallel to me, in a hallway inside the warehouse. He waves; I wave back. I stay there, but then eventually look down.
I got flayed.
Various parts with just... no skin. Just red. So... as all such injuries go, my blood gets on the dock. I still refused to make any noise though. When I think of those that suffered much worst injuries, it just keeps me shut.
I just tell myself like that one guy in "A Way Out" said to the guy in the hospital. "I broke my arm once: it didn't hurt. I grew a pair of balls."
So I caution status Resident Evil walk myself to the first aid kit to try to patch myself up, but well, I mean, I am making a mess of the floor as i walk and can't really hide the sweating and red on my face. Boss man sees me and well that conversation happens. After that, I patch myself up with the Resident Evil 2 safe room ost playing  in my head. I then continue my work schedule and end up having to go back to continue cleaning the dock because of course no one volunteered to help out. I finish and then continue the rest of the long work day with said injury. ||
Hope you're ok and make sure to get yourself checked out for any potential internal injuries.
Excellent job.  Keep it up.  You're doing great.  Be sure to stay away from gacha or else you'd end up in the dirt like me.
I can't really say what's the best call for you since only you know what's truly worth it in your life.
I'm someone that wasted away their body to earn many tens and tens of thousands of dollars to then waste it on nonsense and continue to do so.
I could only do it because I had strong drive in my mind for years on end.
I was literally torturing myself for years, but kept gritting my teeth because I had ambitions I couldn't let down.

I hope you can do your life far healthier than I did.
Sometimes it's fine to endure hard for reasons like providing for your child, family, etc. or what is very dear to you.
Not every reason is as noble as that though.

Again, it's something to think about.
To be as polite as possible, if something is so tough that you haven't lasted a week yet, then perhaps you can try to see how you can learn from the situation so you can avoid getting into it in the future.  Though, I won't say such scenarios are to be avoided entirely, since learning to build some sense of a strong mind can be helpful, perhaps it should be done in controllable steps, rather than harshly if possible.  I imagine you didn't quite know what you were getting into with this 7 day work schedule.

Of course, I'm only going based on what I went through.  I didn't really have all the tools and aids that the current times seem to have right now.

At the very least, perhaps you can find something that helps give you energy and motivation each day to help you get through the rest of this week.  
Afterwards, you can meet up with your folks and therapist to then learn from this experience and then better plan out on how to tackle these kinds of scenarios in the future.
It depends on how you feel about the obligation versus your health.
So it just started this past Monday?  
Have you not worked a week yet?
Is there no way you can take a day off with sick hours?
Holiday season I imagine.  Those types of jobs that you describe are not for everyone.  I once had to do 12+ hours, 7 days a week for 6 months straight.
It takes a strong mind and having a purpose to do that.
If you are losing more than you are gaining, then it's not worth it.
After all, doing that for long periods of time will wear down on your body, which can stay with you later on.
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Ah shit.
No one's going to come to work Sunday then.
No.  I likely get disturbed more than you honestly.
I wish I had them.
Way too many workers just stop caring after lunch time, since it's inadequate to get them charged up for the later hours.
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
He should just make Korea like Europe where you can get 2 months vacation or like Spain where you get siestas.
Precious relaxation time.
He's really attacking the 52 hour work week ever since it was reduced to that amount since it used to be more before.
80 hours?  Earlier in the year he wanted people to work 120 hours a week.
I myself only ever did 105 hours a week.
He's certainly smoking the good stuff since even concentration camps weren't that cruel.

You know Matt, if I had continued, it would have gotten too deep, so I won't, to give room for other discussion. I just wanted to give out that thought.
100+ years
I'd pay for a lifetime subscription to see Winglet's happy life from beginning to end.
<:ShirabeSleep:691497302535176302>
I always see them constantly. I just think of it like Tom from MySpace in the friends list and just go about my business as usual.
<:ShiraBean:736607747834904667>
Just here to say that I haven't enjoyed an anime as much as I did in a very long time as I did Akebi-chan.  I can't believe how happy I was watching that.  I was fully engaged with a warm smile on my face.  Without a doubt, this is where I'd like Winglet to go.  The peaceful life I wish for her. The peace of heart that I felt for Komichi and classmates.  The fanfic that a certain someone wrote for me with you know who having the little sister. Many happy scenarios come to mind now.  
I even watched the available episodes multiple times.  It was so much fun watching this.  That uniform and those dresses.  Wow.
O and Kao is absolutely my favorite girl in the series.
<:AkebiSoSoCute:922988804569169982>
Another winning episode of Akebi.  Cute girls doing cute things straight into my veins.
Akebi so wa good.
Maybe I'll buy Xmas gifts for my cousins this year from the stores Akebi and the rest shopped at last episode.
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
>Steins;Gate
Flashbacks to when sub groups used the ED to showcase the difference between 8bit and 10bit.
<:ShirabeSleep:691497302535176302>
Thanks, I'll keep a look out for it.
Also waiting for Kumichou Musume to Sewagakari.
Hope it comes out soon.
<:ShirabeChibi:698939825155473499>
I'd be in awe if she doesn't spill any on her. I'm just going to give the benefit of the doubt that she has magic to stop the food from falling on her via floatation magic.
The cooking one might be alright. I dunno about how safe it is to eat a borgar right over your clothes like that without a wrapper though.
Lots of furry animals. The fairy forest princess one looks interesting.
Hmmm, let me take a look. See if there is anything for me.
<:ShirabeChibi:698939825155473499>
Ippo was too close to the top and Takamura was still too far away from heavyweight. Something had to stall Ippo until Takamura is able to get closer to his goal.  
Besides, at how it was gong, Ippo was never going to get the necessary skills and abilities that he has now without actually seeing boxing from other perspectives.
Also, he actually needed genuine recovery times from all the face blocking that he's been doing.  Not the little rest time frame between matches. Actual months - years level of rest.
<:serenaworry:796916546202107975>
That was such a poor #1 if I ever saw one. Stood no chance against either of his two opponents.
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
In a world with magic and possibilites, yet apparently nothing beats "direct body heat" transfer I guess.
You remember that scene right?
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
That's the nice thing about Wendy, she changes outfits regularly.

Uh, honestly I'd have to watch the movie again. I do have the Blu ray. I just have to look for it in one of my rented storage bins.

I vaguely remember a scene in Alvarez where Natsu is in a dream and he had to pick between seeds. I think it was around when Lucy was... um, warming him up.

Yeah I have to review it again since I can't say with certainty right now.
Yeah it's what she changes into later on in the movie.
I also really like the, what do you call it, those tribal? outfits of hers. Like you can figure out she was raised in the country. Those types of clothing has fascinated me.
Yep, I've always appreciated how Wendy always has different outfits / hairstyle combinations in all the arcs, even multiple ones within the arc. It's always great to see. I wouldn't even mind having to draw all of that.
This one

The one where she and Natsu are trying to sneak into the castle to take uh, shoot, what were they trying to take again? It's near the beginning of the movie where Lucy is dancing for people and Erza is acting as a waitress.
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
747pm here.
I'm in a parking lot about 15 miles away from home.
Lol, I was like she's copying that?
Wendy's kunoichi outfit was great.
Yeah I was going to say
Lol
Ah yeah, Wendy's dragon force transition was clean.
I was actually going to color in various panels like that one with her in outfit with thr sword. I just never got around to it unfortunately.
Yep. I own all the spin off manga.
I'm always curious to see the continued development of Wendy.
Yep. Looking forward to it.
Didn't the 100 year quest anime trailer pop up not too long ago though? It wont be much longer now.
1st edition of course
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Nice. I forgot to share this as well last time. I went looking through my storage rooms and found this. Always nice looking through my buried treasure.
...Well, not Millaarc levels of absolute hatred. I definitely don't like when Ultear and the rest raided Meredy's village and killed the villagers and those kids. I don't like Blue Skull for killing all the villagers including Zera and the rest of the kids.
The killing part is what always bothers me. If it's hurting someone a lot, but the victim stays alive, then an eventual make up can potentially happen, so I can be more understanding of that. The series is also easier for me to accept because we have a confirmed heaven there.
So say, when Future Lucy died, we saw that she could still have her happy ending. 
Even when Sorano killed, it's not like it was an impossibility for the spirits of her victims to one day forgive her, especially since we saw one of them.

It's easier for me when there is a confirmed heaven and afterlife.

It's why  I'm harsh on Symphogear as I am.
<:serenaworry:796916546202107975>
I'll be interested to see her again in 100 year quest. Maybe even more focus on Dimaria and her living in the farm all blissful like, trying to forget what she experienced in the past.
<:ShirabeChibi:698939825155473499>
I remember when Mest had Brandish u  stab the hell out of August.
That sure wasn't the right move.
Alright found the manga panels. Dming now.
<:serenaworry:796916546202107975>
I'd post "that" manga panel of him in Tenrou Island, but I think someone would flag me if I did.
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I remember seeing Mest / Doranbolt all depressed for not saving Wendy.
I'd be depressed too if I failed to save Wendy.
Of course he finds that girl that looks like Wendy except with short hair and older.
Yep, the world is in immanent peril. You know what means. It'sssss side quest time.
There sure were interesting filler arcs. I guess it's easy when your arcs can revolve around random quests you pick up on the bulletin board.
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
Small Aquarius.
Well Yukino probably did want to make up for that loss against Kagura.
Now that I'm thinking about it, I remember some card game in that filler arc.
Those alternate spirits were amusing to see though.

Lol
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I liked the filler where Wendy defeated a tornado in that race.
I'm guessing you didn't like the spirits rebellion arc in Bleach either.
Happy just continuing to be the "Tails" transport for now.
Maybe not to Happy though
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Though yeah, those higher level saint wizards really didn't amount to much.

Yeah I suppose so. He did lose to Sting after all.
Funny things that Mashima added.
<:serenaworry:796916546202107975>
What about Larcade though?
His magic was very... interesting.
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Yeah Meredy learned a lesson that day.
<:AkebiSoSoCute:922988804569169982>
Has Sanji found All Blue yet?
