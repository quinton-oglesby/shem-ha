Wasn't there an XDU event where they're arguing who owns the castle thing Carol used in GX?
I like both Chris and Millaarc, so it's a blessing for me!
It is both hilarious and stupid at the same time.
For the sake of her sanity, canon! Tsubasa could never find out about this universe.
If it wasn't for the large age difference, then I would ship it.
I swear, it was an official manga.
I think I remember that there was a Yugioh Manga where they focused on the Monsters instead of the card game. Can anyone confirm that?
