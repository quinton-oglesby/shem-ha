he was just a wackjob
like ver he was an actual villan
yah Im hoping this season we get actual villans
also Im not about to sympathize with that vampire I don't care how much she needs blood or wants to "save humankind"
Yah I admit Im just saying like whent hey transform they are basically nude without showing parts
I know Im just saying if they stuck with it this long
I mean If people have made it this far in the anime and they complain about the "lewdness" in kiri's animation i don't know what to tell em
it was executed well
ya know I actually really enjoyed the demon transformations 
as it wasn't just a cop out like most other anime's
When hibiki first  transformed man did that just sell me on symphogear
They reallt outdid themselves witht hat single transformation
hibikis transformation is boss af I loved it and its my favorite transformation sequence out of all the magical girl shows I watched so far
I actually liked dr.ver because he was an actual wackjob of a dude
also I am hoping that this time the villans are villans this time.
It would most defnitly take me maybe a 4-5 years considering Id be just on me and not counting what my real job is
So Im actually a pretty decent coder and Im to the point where I think I could make an entire symphogear game
alive
and there dead
and there alive
they were like and there dead
I dont see another spot for it so im assuming here      Can we jsut talk about season 1s ending juke
Like ver she had a twisted sense of what something ment.
I don't know why its jsut wackjobs are good villians to me ok'
carol was a good villian for sure
also remember when adam transformed into that monster
hibiki's been watchign some jojo
then ill buy it
Im super close to being able to move out
Im going to start buying lots of symphogear merch soon
sees someone blasting random mumble rap Me: starts blasting Symphogear songs
I mean don't get me wrong symphogear does to but fire force made that one fight scene so danm smooth
it has some pretty good action tbh
XD
But isnt this like the millionth time an ally is an anemy even for a short time
Also they really need better background checks on there "Allies"
Although for real though werewolf girl looks like a digimon to me
it was good then fusion was a thing
I mis that show
digimon digital monsters
ima be honest I really loved the occasional beast mode she had
who here misses the hibiki beast modes
I just call it beast mode myself
I was talking about beserk
is she liek a year older now?
wait whats hibiki's age in xv?
unless they all died i noise attacks
Im sure they have barbers in symphogear
ah i see
also if thats the final villian h my
I thought they went ahead a year with all the things they showed but I might just be misunderstanding
well i know shes 17 in axv
I can't use her for some reason

actully scratch that all the villians in season 2
Like dr ver shiraba kirka all need a dictionary
Danm The villains in the second season need to be slapped with a dictionary
finished rewatching g
Im actually curious what her transformation would look like
So I Would really like for miku to wield a symphogear again but this time of her own free will.
I know we already got like 1 million symphogear users but miku honestly should have been a symphogear user or become one
I like all the comments on the crunchy roll video 
"ugh get an originial idea this is a copy of bnha"
"me" Symphogear came first
them: uh usdfsa fdsfg sfg sdgdf gsdfgdgf sgd
to be honest somethigns gonna happen with miku in this season"what if it was me causing trouble for someone" Like we know where this is going its heavily telagraphed
they both use there fists
there personality of wanting to help and save people
they both have to make there powers there own
Deku gets poweres from injured person
hibiki gets powers from injuredperson/dead person
honestly if you think about it the starts pretty similar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys099qG3HVY&lc=z22ptnkoeuqog3wccacdp434ooxar3xw5uaeffetyshw03c010c.1564456980014769
crunchy roll made a comparison to one for all during the all for one song

well this comment that roasted him explains it
the dude saw a single scene and said it was mediocre. it was the fight with the coffin.
but yeah vimain is right
ikr

so on an xv comment section that crunchyroll posted ina video
is to hard Im nto a pixel art person
i give up
Im making statues but I have no idea if Im even good enough
it depends if I succeed
wish me luck
well ima attempt to build statues in minecraft of symphogear charchters
nah I need to save the world to be good
Imagine there singing being bad at karaoke XD
Also ~~thanks~~ I mean you didn't see me here
XD
~~why is it so hard to find lesbian doujinshi of symphogear~~
actually speaking of that emote I hope this season swan songs actually mean something again
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I mean theres differences but its just similar
and Actually thigns I desribed where most of it is most anime is the saving others part
danm its actually a lot more similar then I thought it was
Out of the villains this season i like elza the best
<@263983345669505025> kerthank you
I mean I I would love to see a giant miku with a tiny hibiki
but yah somethings gonna happen with miku  this season
So who here thinks miku is gonna become a kaiju? XD
Millarc doesn't need a redemption arc.
I  if you need to steal blood to survive.
But saving the world  ot needing blood tos survive constitutes no reason to become a mass murderer.
or nanjo does
shirabe just has a really good singing voice
ima buy some physical cds at some point as im starting my job today
Thats true
Id bet that
A lesbian hamster
Instantly gave me strength
So im helpung my uncle carry in some furniture then there was this one heavy couch then i thought to myself if a highschool girl can punch a mountain top shorter i can carry this
Yah her songs sound really hard core even when you understand most of the song
Correction multiple
Considering she parried tank round
Surprisingly hibiki's songs are good for the mood of working out
Ima be listening to symphogear while working out
Great now im gonna think of hibiki whenever i work out
|| So we all know milliarc was just told to kill that man.  no offense to symphogears that's just way to predictable.This also may be the foreshadowing of  miku:"what if im the one causing trouble for people?" As well as they just had drama so it fits in perfectly. ||
||ill try it||
I know Im just trying to be considerate
so how do i block otut hings that people may not want to know yet cause they haven't seent he latest episode
Hibiki's transformationw as the best for me
but yah can't wait to see miku as a god
ima so start saying car justsu when I do a swerve or something
Lmao
I can't get over the fact he had car jutsu
I mena i know its an anime but still
like fcking car  jutsu?
I mean yah but still
like wha6t the actual god danm fuck is that shit
like thew actual fuck witht hat car
also the fuck is with ogawa
miku is gonna become a god totally called it
I still can't wait to see miku become a god
youtube use to have a semi-decent mvideo editor
do it
I need a good video editor to use
Im gonna do a everything wrong with X anime series and vice versa
so
also no i don't havea fingernail fetish
hell they drew it even here where its s small they could use the normal anime fingers of not showing finger nails

but like they so quick no one would notice
like yah quick scenes
but theyt actually drew the nailpolish in places where no one would really notice
and skip it
most animators are  like nah no one will notice
they drew int he nailpolish
I gotta give credit tot he animators
so you know when maria does the stardust concert with maria
also called it mikue gonna be a god this season
exscuseme she is the murder of miracles
although it wouldn't work ont he robot probably
they shoudla doen the kiss energy take thing
carol: get off my lawn you youngins
*energy lasts them out
sadly the bodies they had weren't the best
autoscores are tough as ever tho
they need her toa ctivate it
but yah ima go back and look at carols old busty transformation now
lmao
well what if carola nd elfnein have the same memories but the memories are seprate so carol burns her memories and not elfneins
just use alchemy
sure she can
like her original transformation was so much better then this one
I really wish that carol was still busty when she transformed and I also wish she got the same treatment as this seasons transformations
ikr
although I kinda miss the busty transformation carol had
still can't wait for miku to become  a god
ikr
Saved
Sadly i live in oklahoma and there previoua genaration was way to easy conaiderung the zmount of bad drivers when i failed mine for doing something i should have done

Shirabe: I kinda wish we got to go to the moon

So they wen't to thge moon got it
