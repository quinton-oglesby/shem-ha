Her "DESS"
And when that happens
GX concert mostly just had really good choreography and sfx
It was so fucking good
I loved the concert animation
Is there a streamable of concert
<:Think:356844651598184451>
One kid saw it and got interested in watching the whole thing
I was watching XV ep 1
So I'm a part time instructor for some kids at this summer camp
Earlier this week
Er
People actually getting fucking split in half
Red mist was really graphic this time arohnd
When you nutting but a vein pops
STRAWBERRY JAM DISPENSER

But XV concert animation is <a:animblobsweats:446036076088393733>
While the animation itself was just decent
S U C C
Time to spread symphohype amongst everyone

Good shit
Yeah XV is some
It's not at that level yet
And when you compare it to like, studio wit or bones
Good I guess
Prob cuz before XV its animation was merely just
Just one giant monster inside the suitcase
Maybe it's like touko aozaki
Not airing time
Oh wait my concert clip on reddit got taken down since needs to be 24 hours after ep discussion thread
Time to spread symphogear magic
Finally
