So wat determines a unit getting an additional attack? 
I'm using this XD Jii support and none of her Memoria sem to prompt an additional attack. Dunno if I'm blind and not seeing something x.x
I think Giga
Ah ok, sorry just wasn't sure. Thanks!
Haha, no worries and thanks a lot!
And welp x.x you have to fight all the scorers in that raid?
Did you see it up <@!368681228741640193> ?
Just sent out the raid request
Aye, jus got into one so just be a moment
I could use it for the Giga Intel/Rainbow but I just got magic crystals during the last one ;/
<@!368681228741640193> Hey sorry, had to step away for a moment. I can start another raid if you'd like
Set up another P Carol <@!368681228741640193>
Aye seen Zerker but not this Rage one before.
what's that Red smoke and steam status they inflict you with?
Okidoki
Aye, I'll open another P Carol Raid
Ooph thanks
o.o did do a chunk of damage doe
Every bit helps
Thanks a lot!
Aye
Got two up I could use help with


Alright, starting it up
<@!127991170201681920> Think you'd be able to help with another Intel raid? I can get one more open
The other Jii that heals?
Cool, got Giga Melody off the Intel and a Giga Rainbow
Only 25min left in the Intel raid.
Ok just followed!
Appreciate it! I will have to ask for more help in the future haha
Do you have space
<@!127991170201681920> lemme add you real quick
Ack oh
Oooh 3 Giga Intel
I just need intel killed since I won't be able to dent it
Getting it!
Friends/Followers
That's some damage lol
Thanks! Much appreciate.
Oh ok
Haven't come across units needing Magic yet
Oh?
So hunt is when people are active in the raid when it gets killed? What I think I'm understanding
Hm ok, think i'm starting to get it
Which emoji we pressing. Said person sets it up in chat?
Soz, just new information for me
Pause as in, don't continue hitting the raid?
o.o emote counter?
Ah
Is it better if you have others kill it with you instead of just yourself, even after putting raid out?
> Ya'll know the drill for how this works right?
<@!195044406343106560> I do not lol
Hm well not close to LU any XD units so, not really?
Ah
Giga Miracle is which one again?
Most likely
Alright it's up <@!127991170201681920>
Thanks though, hopefully next time
Oh I mean in general. Gotta go out in a bit
Oh no I didn't. Can't partake right now.
Alright. Opening up a Hard Intel
P Carol
For y'all
Hard Carol or just Hard Intel?
What'd be better <@!174272493777977344> <@!195044406343106560>
I'll open up a Intel Hard in just a second
<@!195044406343106560> ^Intel Giga Crystals
Ok.
<@!195044406343106560> got some time to help out with a raid or two?
No prob, take care
Alright, just sent therequest out
Just got into it so just be a sec <@!127991170201681920>
Coolio. Lemme finish this raid and I'll open up a Hard P Carol raid
Only mentioned P since they drop Giga Intel as well
That's fair. Maybe we can do some next time. Thanks for the help though!
Just need 3 more Giga Rainbow so I can get Kanade up to level 70!
Ooph and I thought I made it good with Giga Intel x.x

Oh so that's what blind does
Ah righ
Always curious why the skills do less damage than their regular attacks
All of it helps ðŸ˜„
Gotcha, names Tab
Wanna bonk a few peeps so I can?
<@!676272618839605249>
No room x.x
Dunno haha, lemme add ya know if not
Uhmmm
My best Bold unit is probably Iginite Maria since I got a 2nd copy from the 5star tixs
^
Er, dunno lol
I'm still a bit off on how to do it properly since I couldn't join yesterday
Alright, sent the request out
Need more Intel/Giga now for Intel Jii
Gonna open up an Intel Hard/Hard P Carol if anyone is interested in helping
Oh ok. And once they get in the raid on their own, just continue of your own accord?
Still confused on that concept when Hanabi was explaining it. 
Pause after they start the raid and such
How do you snipe with a team x.x
Halp
> tbh I only learned how to raid properly after I got my two units partly-whaled
<@!174272493777977344> Still trying to learn how to
<@!127991170201681920> Alright, opened the raid
Bullet points help
And hm ok <@!368681228741640193> 
Thanks for the info
<@!127991170201681920> Coolio, thanks. Just be a second. I'll ping ya when it's open.
Got all the stuff to get Intel Jii to level 70 now.
Thanks to whoever helped on that last raid I put up
AYe so I did my own raid x.x
I think I might have done my own raid by mistake thinking it was yours x.x
<@!127991170201681920> Did your raid end?
Oh ok. Aye, I'll hop on that. I'll have an Hard Intel open if anyone else wants to have a crack at it.
<@!127991170201681920> Think we can go for another round on Intel Hard? Just need Giga Rainbow now.
Mhm thanks for the help on that for those who did
Just made room too just incase I was full for y'all
Ok cool. Thanks for the tip
Would the rename just be for this server?
And it's live
In the raid now so be a min
Coolio
Just need 1 Giga Intel and 3 Giga Rainbow to get Jii to Level 70
Anyone around to do another Intel Raid?
I have burnbasa at level 42 I think. Have not been blessed by her
Then ye, I got her to 70 yesterday

Name's Tab, I'll get on that Raid now
Coolio. Added you.
<@!142629493624799232> do you have room to add you?
Haven't started it but just curious beforehand
<@!127991170201681920> When you have a moment, can you help with Hard Tech raid?
Got a nice juicy fullish HP Hard Tech waiting to be swatted
Anyone else? ðŸ˜„
Welp aye, no worries
Anyone here can help with a Hard Tech? Have it up already if we're added
<@!127991170201681920> you around by chance to swat it?
