its been a long while since I had to go into this
but like the other guy said if you really wanna dig deep just google it
US does stand for United States
compromise between state vs population
its soemthing along that line
electoral power of each state is weighted by population or something
that guy votes
ppl vote for a guy in a state
electoral power varies from state to state
what number are you asking about
meanwhile at Nevada
look where we at
polls said biden woul win by a lnndslide
fakechan

he could jsut say he would give one and do whatever with the time slot
2020

trump would use his concession speech to rally up his supporters

such a long time ago since i watched idk why Im thinking of it now
i just remember that the one scene in Fate Zero where Tokiomi and Kirei's dad walking around Kirei in circle was dumb
no real reason for this but

bring back blue shin getter! <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
maybe we'll get anime original ending haha
as long as they arent adapting darkness or Dash, I guess. lol
Hell, they can even readapt from the start of getter robo saga
but the ending is a big cliffhanger for the series that will never be concluded
not that Ark is bad
probably better for them to explore alternate timelines like armageddon or new getter robo instead of Ark
yea thats what im saying
we still need a story to explore on Getter Robo Zan
probably should have gone armageddon or new getter robo route
idk about that cg near the end
ken ishikawa passed away before ark storyline was concluded
are they gonna end the anime in cliffhanger lol
who i think they are <:MichaPoint:738234743115743292>
are those two

I read that as 10 worst anime titties
i remember the chick with the uncanny resemblance to Disgaea's etna
seto no no hanayome is great
and im saying that knowing armageddon op is just footage from the actual anime stitched together
imo this doesnt even come close to those
new getter, armageddon, and shin vs neo were great
first half was meh
not gonna lie, im not impressed
i saw the getter robo ark op
||MC didnt overcome the final boss, the final boss lowered himself to be below MC level to fight him since iirc the fight was right after his surgery to remove his cybernetics||
||the final boss depowered himself to fight MC wasnt very satisfying to me||
i like s1 except the final fight
is it better than the first one?
hows megalobox2?
animu based on western comic series
