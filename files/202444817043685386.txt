Can i even call this ship a classic

Don't think too deep about it
Or mostly nsfw
Something kinky

I know its gagaga
As i like to call her when i watched zexal
The modern magician girl
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>

Weird choice of weapon
Huh
Looking at this pic makes me think samus is just fighting them no problem
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
Didn't notice that one
Ops
Ah yes the penguin
For what it was
The dub is pretty good
Rachel is as well
If slayer is the most powerful one in gg
I know
Depends on what series there from
00
Wait i just get the reference
For some reason i see skullgirls maybe cuz that games artstyle felt more like a western cartoon
i follow the guy
https://twitter.com/ScruffyTurtles
same person that worked on persona 5 alternative universe
there a kat fan themselves
i know the artist
she was truly a queen when it comes to designs of dark signers
well true that
yeah
Ok I'll take that
Would she fall under masochist
Ah her

When basa is sandwiched
Im missing some context here
In arcane
I think the whole cast is different
In game?
But not my best adc
I was always a fan of cait
Arcane really making people fans
A lot of vi art im noticing
And why is biki the lewd one
Srw 30?
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
At least irl
Since in fate extra she does have blonde hair
Well it was a good guess
Extra rin and lancer i assume
Do we count super Mario 3d world
If it works it works
you have been warned
if you still decide to watch it
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
i had to double check to see if im in the right channel

I know the artist for that one
everywhere

I feel like kirikia could cosplay as dark magician girl
I guess kaiba did some modifications
ah gravity rush
cuz kirika could fit but idk
who would be lady anyways
thats oddly fitting
i know that artist
ngl i was thinking that a fan art of a yu gi oh card but realized it was gear characters
*chris breaks the door down*
the scene when he awakened using it is still stuck in my head
man that pic looks damn cool i always liked nero and him just using the yamato
The eyes and the chest are a dead giveaway
https://tenor.com/view/happy-kaguya-kaguya-sama-kaguya-sama-love-is-war-gif-18438938
well the animes didnt do her many favors
and i was just making a izanami palette
lol
Since lambda and nu share the same sprite i planned on making it for lambda and for shirabe idk could have went with mu or nu
sure ill dm you
3_skip
i guess i can share at least 3 more i have work in progress for now
the basepal i get from a guide on steam
i used a software to make this one
3_skip
i made a palette myself just now
ah nice

I would assume its based on one of flash series
Well that's some old school stuff

FBI OPEN UP
Most likely
Or anything like that
Not like there's going to be a riot
She was kinda lewd in older seasons
Ho boi
Now if miku gets her gear
Lel
Chris is getting more chest service
Bayonetta is fan service
Most likely
Miku
I doubt it
Was tsubasas ptsd
Well one thing that get me the most
Yeah it was on the table
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Kirika bring naïve is just fanservice
Engrish kinda jumpped over my head
From what I remember
There wasn't much butts
That's how this guy <@289013001632350208> kinda get me into it and xdu
K I'm done with that
As shit
Every Sao villan was dumb
I'll Goa bit off topic
He dead a hero
In my own vision
I want to be a hero
Ver is just
If that happend
I'm starting to miss ver
But people mostly care for the action
And finds her lewd memories
Dives deep in to mikus mind
Elfnein
But it was watchable
It was slow yeah
Part 1 wasn't that bad
Can someone call Vlad the III
Guess then za wardou is irrelevant
Well part 1 at least
Lel
But jojo was inspired by fist of the North Star
Hands
And I'm expecting drills on all 4
She didn't use them yet in season 5
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Was hibiki just ORA ORA ORA ORA
Last ep of season 4
Warlocks
What's next
Time to sleep
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Welp if you excuse me
Vers made that girl his bitch
Carol aka
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
good day
*ptsd triggered*
before the concert started
she was worried
everyone has there dislikes
so they hide it well
is it known to the public that she is a symphogear user
classic cliches
if theres going to be one
her grandfather can rot in hell
if she knew how gungnir worked
so can <:KanadeSit:535301654464036884>
if miku is getting her gear
im just wait to see
i have a feeling she may have the power to see with other peoples eyes
the vampire girl
lol

<:Ver:336656981144109066>
if i have to take a guess
adult swim
sorry for going off topic
that happend in it
but i do know of that one brutal scene
i never watched blood c
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
XD
i love how chris didnt have a lot of fan service
shirabe was just being shirabe
unless things get really worst for them
lets no go to the yuri part
im wondering where hibiki will live after shes done with school
big funds
cuz plot
people on tumblr expect so goi shit always
NEED IT
I
at this point
cuz shes long dead
big doubt
no
and give the girls a power boost
at the end
im just waiting for them be dead
the ending
even those that did a mass murder
hibiki tries to be friends with everyone
we need more of this faces
if kiri transformation happens again
new toys
she get 2
we just need more maria with glasses
mentally
i feel like the old man is going to break tsubasa in to pieces
i just want miku to get her gear
if that happens
ninjas are spies
~~fist of the north star moves~~
lel
but miku
no one seduces hibiki
that can fight them
we dont have other symphogear users
what if elfnein gets shot in the head and has to wear that thing where she can enter someones brain
lol
never
she needs it
that face should be a emote
and getting there gear back
i can see vanessa having respect for hibiki
care to enlighten me
i havent seen it
if you know what im saying
there thicc
but hibiki has chris and maria
https://twitter.com/chadwickboseman/status/1299530165463199747?s=20 idk where to post this but I'll post it here
So its better to change your passwords
Speaking of twitch the website get leaked
i knew it was going to get a 2nd season
^
https://twitter.com/SagaZombieLand/status/1155034010633981952
i think the manga is long done
https://twitter.com/Spytrue/status/1156900386093056002?s=19

I know the anime has been out for months
I feel like we entered spoiler territory
She never had any to start with
In the manga naofumi want them dead
Made her character weak
I just didn't like what they did to the queen
I enjoyed the ep where naofumi get his honor back
I didn't really feel like keep going
After that
Where he has to clear his name
But I only cared for the first arc of shield hero
Yeah it was different depending on the source
But yeah it's true that heroes are different
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
Who I was thinking it was a LN
WN?
Or adds some new content
Idk if the anime follows the LN
Shield hero manga and anime are different
And didn't feel like watching many anime
Cuz I get lazy
And I haven't watched demon slayer
Cuz this season they really seem to want to end it with a bang
God knows
Well SG may get a spin off
Or the author plans to end it
Isn't manga for demon slayers going to keep going
I think the manga is ending soon
LN gets really really brutal
It gets really brutal
It's just that
I know he grows
It has that one scene that's like well known
Goblin slayer
Was the reason it made it so big
That last part
When politics entered it
That's gone
Ok where is that jojo meme where abaccio serves giorno tea
From just the profile name alone
To me
Kinda shady
That sounds
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
To keep up with the news
Or some game profiles
I only use my twitter to follow artist
Well her excuse was ||her religion||
Be had the whole kingdom under his foot
If he did
He never had that shield
Even tho
She says he had a mind control shield
You know the dumb logic of the bitch
The crimes were also false
Tanks in mmos can be beasts in there own right
Even tho
Of shield not being that useful
Cuz they followed mmo logic
To me other heroes just get blind cuz of the weapons they get
And learned a lot of stuff
Cuz he grinded
But some I just smh
And I say some were not bad
I seen a yt video from hamon beat showing cut stuff in the anime
Maybe when it's done
And idk if I'll read part 8
Just so I can get to part 7
At this point I'm going to read SO
The CVs
Some expect the cast to be changed
7 is the most hyped arc
Cuz the studio is getting close to it
At this point I just araki to finish part 8
Yet
And nothing was said about part 6
Part 5 just finished
Maybe lel
Welp guess no jojo then
Well aren't we entering the era of 24 EPs now
Vinland saga
How many EPs are planned for it
I may give it a watch
Heard of it
The Viking anime
That's airing
SG and danmachi S2 is what im like watching
im having doubts about this season
https://myanimelist.net/news/58377574
but takaheshi is the explosion queen
i find dub for konosuba funny
I don't follow
I have yet to watch the movie myself but I do love the ending theme of it
So that's why it's confusing
The code Geass movie follows the recap movies that changed few things from the original anime
bisceto
i kinda felt like some of the deaths in the 2nd season were pointless
and is the prince
in the ending
one that get crushed
he was the reason behind some of the deaths of the characters
lok was the biggest dumbass in that whole series
IBO was good
tbh
accelerator anime wasnt really need it
lol
i was thinking about doing it
i didnt watch the og gundams yet
in there own timeline
some of shows are there own thing
gundam has its own time line
well idk if i say 00 was the best gundam
also anyone watched 00 here
cuz i really want see what mechs they made in it
im just waiting for that mobile game to come soon
so idk if she have time for a kid
kudelia deals with politics
then she be in problems
if it was kudelia
before the fight
in his own mech
well he did have sex
cuz the mobile game is when mikazuki kid starts piloting a gundam
you mean the sequal
<a:EnterpriseSweats:565637305700712449>
kudelia was just there to spoil mikazuki
until he was killed in the war
iok had plot armor
and i still remember the shit that happend
i havent watched ibo in like a year or 2
he was using him
in s2
who was wearing a mask
remember that purple hair guy
he didnt have much else to do
he was just a mech
well he was a forgetful character tbh
the one that want it revenge after his commander was killed?
who was eins again
s2 was the one that didnt really need most of its deaths
mikazuki changed when he died
his death did change some of the characters
for most of the members
they were many death flags
Oh
Yui horie?
i dont think i watched that one
a old show i used to watch as a kid
yeah i was thinking of something else
oh wait im thinking of something else
the one where they can pass the controller to one another?
when they came out
of those shows
can someone check the dates
the anime was at least
metabots was cool
i didnt watch any of the build series
but seems like its too much time getting into
thats one big wall of text
christ
I stopped watch half way on wings
I haven't watched that one yet
Maybe it's from a gundam I haven't watched yet
Doesn't look familiar to me
At this point I feel like Rias is the most well known role for Yoko hikasa
Cuz it was the song used for the intro for 00 characters selected
And i Can thank gundam Vs gundam for that one
From 00s ops
I liked ash like snow
My fav being raise your flag by man with a mission
Cuz it had a lot of great ops
It's a shame
But if Ibo openings are missing
Idk
Mainly mikazukis VA
I remember some of the voices
She was buying something and get shoot
I forget his name
The one kinda had a thing for the guy who kinda looked like guts
Yoko hikasa was in Ibo so no surprise
I mixed the 2 for some reason
I knew he was going to say that when "that scene happend"
is what ill say
you are in for a ride
oh just you wait
he dies a lot
well he time travels after he is killed
and fixes that
but subaru goes back in time
well she dies
shes way too much of a smartass
and i forget the reason why she died
when rem died
i remember ram want it to kill subaru
god i hate it when they do that with recaps
well rem is in more action
cuz i do remember good amount of the plot
ill not bother
ram is kind of a character that doesnt have much of a role in the early parts of the story
As the years go on the humor in older anime will be outdated
Also mirai Nikki is only memorable cuz of yuno and what crazy shit she does everyone else besides Yuki and the eyepatch girl are kinda forgetful
Louis you are going wild
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
I only see clips of it here and there
And I have yet to watch it
Nichijou was like few years ago
*switches it off*
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
~~points the gun~~
and everyone sleeps
but not 100% sure
i heard the author want it the anime to go anime only
well the 2003 anime followed the manga until they went anime only
i have memories of the original anime
i have yet to watch FMAB
seeds could have been a lot better
you mean different things
i seen a few scenes from that show
and triage x
rail wars is one anime i see clips of a lot
I think some of them will still be scary to me
Even if I spoil myself with all the deaths
But there going to be some that will just make me uncomfortable a lot
I think I'll be able to stand some deaths
Or VN stuff
Anime only stuff
Lot of what?
I know everyone is fucked in the head one way or another
After some fucked up deaths
Idk if I'll be able to keep watching
And that's not the problem
I know the animes are old
Cuz how much the deaths are screwed up
But idk if I'll ever watch it
One series I heard so much about
XD
cuz directors mostly get into shit
i was thinking it was the director
yeah my bad
https://goboiano.com/producer-of-shichisei-no-subaru-anime-arrested-for-kidnapping-teen/
Shichisei no Subaru
the director for it end it up being arrested for child porn or he kidnapped a 10 year old
oh that anime
~~and he is not a pedo i know~~
i know your old one was the one that was interested in the kids
one of the characters from hunter x hunter
cuz what do they have to adapt
well yeah
well hunter hunter is still on going
but i doubt it
i may watch it at some point
i cant say anything about hunter x hunter cuz i didnt watch it
and i know jojo anime isnt that old but the series is pretty old at this point
people say part 1 of jojo is slow but to me it never felt slow
And it gets good at a certain ep after that
Most of the older shows start slow as hell
In some cases it is
after ep 3
so i guess you are opening your door to a anime that will just be like sike you watched the wrong anime
i think madoka magica is a good example of one
cuz there shows that just fuck with you
i never go with that rule tbh
you going by the 3 ep rule?
besides railgun isekai quartet
this season to me isnt really interesting
i remember seeing a shield girl manga cover in a fgo server
Cuz writers like that stuff
cuz idk if ill even bother watching any of the new anime
im just waiting for isekai quartet
isnt that like a old trailer
he doesnt compare to fathers who dont give much of a shit for there children
who get a good ending
hibikis dad is just a bad dad
just daughters
or they dont even have them
most of the good dads dont have many sons
its more common to see bad ones
but problem is that
i know there some good fathers in anime
im sick of it tbh
or dead or just bad fathers
in some anime
at this point i feel like anime companies have a fetish for making fathers pieces of shit
like he really just cares for his job then his own son
i know gons father is the worst father
thats his name
hisoka
She's in most Sao games
Yuuki was a wasted character
To the point of saying pirating anime is a bad thing
He has been shilling for crunchyroll for years now
I haven't watched him in sometime
He did?
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
If you want a raid on your ass them go ahead
And shill for crunchyroll
But do you make videos about it
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
A lot
He loves to shit on Sao
How much he loves to jack off to the hate train
Sometimes when I think of Sao I think of mothers basement
Reki made it cannon
It's cannon I know that
Ordinal I haven't watched yet
I really want more of it
The arc itself and the spin off
Well I was a fan of ggo
After alicezation
But idk about future arcs
I heard reki may come back to it
In that one
He changed kirito
I know he did rewrite the first arc of Sao
When he written sao
Well I blame reki for not thinking of his mistakes well
It's just that reki didn't know da hell was he doing
In that arc
Her being a damsel didn't really ruin her character for me
Like
With how wide those bars were
She could have escaped easy
You know the dumb thing
Well asuna wasn't a bad character
Dess
And said something random
The bot just random showed up
Lol
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
There have to be some bad apples
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Were you disappointed when you found out it was jp only
But didn't watch the series
I know of kamen rider
I don't watch much sentai
They don't sell blurays
What's wrong with aniplex
And not giving much good examples for his video
I seem a clip of the MC owning a zebra
Oh that one
Who doesn't befriend a lone wolf this days dess
the fate route
people still cry for a remake of it
there some good in them
but there not that bad
there shit
it shows subaru has respect
them changing sits
yeah it had fun moments
he may have directed bad adaptions of the 2 fate routes but at least there were a starting place for some fans
rip
cuz im not 100% sure how much there going to give out
maybe
thats where season 2 will do
what about your sleep
but time will come
ill not say why
beatrice will be a lot of help to subaru
Macross went under my readar for a while
Only mech series I heard of most was gundam
Animation ~~well that one is arguably~~ story telling and how long they are
Its going to be hard for some people to get into older anime from the 80s for many reasons
People lose there memories when they die
Through season 1
Until half way
The series at the start didn't really have much politics
I kinda find it how a isekai end it up turning into politics
The series end it up being more about politics
Lol
?
And I had no problems with them
Hell I spoiled myself on a lot of shows
And I don't mind spoilers
So no point in it really
Eva is a really old show
So I can't cry about it
But spoilers are everywhere at this point
I haven't finished eva
For him being like that
I like to blame his father
That will never stop
But people shitting on shinji
I think Rei Vs asuka debate is dead

And they seem to have focused on SAO a lot
A1 decided to drop the series after a filler movie that wasn't going to do well cuz why bother watching a filler movie
And deen made konosuba
Deen was just not ready for seven deadly sins
Cuz sunrise and other studios that did mech were just on a roll with there "anime originals"
Unless you count mech anime
Then going anime only
The early 2000s were the years of like most anime following the manga after some arc
And ultimate followed the manga
After some arc
I know the anime went anime only
Ultimate are the OVAs
In the OVAs
I know hellsing had a rape scene
Maybe that's why
Before it
Maybe I seen some shit
For some reason
I somehow didn't have problems with that rape scene
It was where kirito changed
Alicezation was good
Will the first 2 seasons
Now days I'm just ehh about it
I liked sao
Not going to lie when I was getting back into animr
Cuz how much people hated it
More then log horizon
But I think Sao kicked it off
Some people say log horizon was the rise of the isekai anime
I think it aired when isekai start it going strong
And devil was a part timer
Isekai was like not much common when Ngnl aired
I mean if sjws want to bitch they may as well look at family guy
Cuz lolis are lolis
I know shiro gets a lot of panty shots
I never heard of it
And yet only thing new we get from it was the movie
I find it funny how Ngnl is highly loved in the anime community
I know his born in Brazil
I only see memes of people saying Ngnl isn't getting a 2nd season
Idk
I was thinking he was done with the series
I didn't know the author was in jail
This is news to me
Guess he was a Yoshi as well
Wait what
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
I don't think he read the LNs
I think he just has a problem with him getting girls with just that
Like to be good at something else
And doesn't have anything else about his character traits
Cuz he just plays games and gets girls
Of Accel world
He doesn't like the mc
Do you know who lost pause is
Also speaking of Accel world
I know Accel world was 2009
Then he made Accel world and was able to publish it
But it didn't work out
Didn't he try to publish Sao in 2003
So he want it to keep Accel world going
The man does that a lot
Cuz both share the same special move
Tho I'd not be surprised if he changed his mind on that one
Yeah middle aged
Well not really old
Then kirito while be a old man
Son of a bitch
Is Accel world and Sao connect
Oh it fits Accel world
The creator of the series making a movie a cannon
You know what I find funny
Just there minds
Like there bodies don't get transported to the game world
That people call it a isekai
It always bugged me
~~unless it's seeds~~
He kinda broke the rules of the game
Cuz his ligh saber
Besides kirito getting stares
And yeah kirito was just too op
When she get the sword for kirito
Heated
How should I say
I mean Sinon made things
I don't get how she get hated that fast
Most people hate asuna later on
But hey whatever
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
Well he did go to bed with her later on
They do dirty most characters
Comes into the pic
When kyh
Yeah he just out right ditchs them
I was thinking he was a dumbass at points
And I didn't have much of a problem with him
I didn't read them
We need to force Aya to watch sao
Cyp
She get a lot of character development
But in underworld
She was kinda ehh
Alice wasn't really good in first part of Alicezation
I find it funny how Alice gets a high rank outfits in the dlc
I know there's dlc for Alice and eugio
I heard FB was kinda good
Sao progressive was made to fix characters
But that anime was just meh
It gets thrown in my recommendation
It happens
Lol
What happened
What
Kinda funny how everything works off one another
Same with dxd
One of my guilty pleasure
Oh that one
The MC in rakudai just grows stronger cuz of stella
That anime was just a big meh
That one
Omg
Blade dance
It had cool fight scenes
I mean they became lovers real quick
Rakudai had good animation
Waiting for the rain
And I liked the endings too
I liked both ops
As he keeps breaking limits
Will it's getting weaker
Asterisk war is where they just give the MC the power boost
You need the plot to at least have a good premise
It's one that's has been over used a lot
And I didn't rate it
I watched all of ot
I smell lewdness
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
Are chibi ones
Only ones that I want to buy ever
Cuz there the top girls
Ofc rias and akeno are going to be high price
Lol
Then in the anime
Toma looks better there
It is
More then the anime
I think index was the first series I liked the LN artstyle
But I knew most dengeki characters
And maybe few others
I remember only character from the Crossing void game I didn't know was boggypop
I haven't fully finished that one
And I just hated hestia
I heard danmachi S2 was bad
It's common
And people said that ep was just a middle finger to born
That the studio behind heroes tried there best on the recap ep to explain things better
Born end it up skipping stuff from the LN
And is happy the current studio that worked on heroes
Until I found out the creator for the series end it up having a fall out with the studio that did the first 3 seasons
For dxd
But I find it funny how I used to find the change of artstyle wired
If it's anything lewd
Most be some big fat money
And I found out the MC gets like 7 or 8 wife's
Also I want to the dxd wiki
Idk
Heroes hinted at the end that there's more to come
Cuz it left on a cliffhanger
It needs a another season
Date a live suffered that
To the point of disappointing fans
Some end it up being crap
Rest of the animes they took
Last year
They were ready for index
In terms of animation
The series would get bad
I guess if the anime keeped going
Well
Didn't she retired
If the studio doesn't plan to make more seasons
In main series animes
We may not even get to that point
She does have her own series and is show to not much a tsundere all the time
And I seem clips of the anime
Lol I haven't watched HO
For animators
And money isn't that good
Well Japan likes to over work people
Has limits
But even my bias
Even tho Jeanne is in it
I haven't fully finished the anime
People hated apocrypha
Writing the series
I guess it shows how much the author has come
Index novels are done right?
They could have keeped going
Mad house throw it under the bus
I heard about world trigger
Rest of the parts were ok for me
For me part 3 was kinda slow with battles in JoJo
Idk about Gonzo
Gainax was its own mess
I mean that's how some gaming studios end up forming
That anime was wired
Lol card captor Sakura
What was the 2014 incident
But there going to enter a new one anyways
I mean a studio can get out of a mess
Ln she most likely changes
In the anime at least
Aria I have mix feelings about
And fgo as nobu
And another character from a game I playing
But this days I know her as Kiana from honkai
I only know of 4 tsundere rie played
Lel
Oh
Haru?
Abusing saito for no good reason besides girls being near him
As a character
Louise was a mess
Isn't rie the tsundere queen
Well yeah
Cuz I didn't playing the VN
Fate I can't taking about
Well emiya he had a thing for a different girl depending on the route
But I for some reason want her to stop acting like one
I know she's a child
Shana to me is just too much of a tsundere
Honestly
Like shokugane no Shana
Gate is one of many anime I have yet to fully watch cuz there series I forget where I stopped at
Haven't really get to watching season 2
I only watched season 1
Gate I feel like politics were not much of a big thing
The anime world's own politcs I mean
Ok
If it's in world politics
Another one with politics
Son of a gun
But never bothered to watch it
I remember seeing it along side trinity seven anime
When I used the mobile app
I seen ads of the anime on crunchyroll
I know a friend that read some manga of it
She at least understood what was happening
But not a bitch bitch
Blue one was a bitch
He most likely had a chance with the girl he liked
If Taiga didn't screw up with the love latter
Sometimes
I felt bad for the mc
O boi
Taiga
While we are still on topic about rie
Sounds painful
Lol
The whole soundtrack is good for it
It be worst if it was the same season
If so then SAO just overshadowed the hell out of AW
Wait did both animes came out at the same season
The irony
And by ngnl no less
I never heard of a anime bring overshadowed by a another anime
Idk when the animes came out
But I know it's about 3 kids who have special powers or something like that get summoned by a bunny girl
I forget the name of it cuz it's long
I remember someone said there was a anime that get over shadowed by ngnl
Cuz it most likely the anime wasn't as big
Well it's one series that never really seemed big
And some manga
I find it wired how most novels are still on going
Give I didn't read the novels
Welp I guess I didn't miss much
What I missed
So um
It is a mix of that
Oh yeah
His a good king
But I'm lazy to watch it
It may change my view on him
It's not that I'm not interested
I haven't watch the anime where he was younge
Sinbad was someone I didn't really like much
Ops are good
Morgiana was someone that grow greatly as a character
But still the point still stands on most animes
Well it wasn't
Most bad anime end up having a good sound track
aka the friday that has everyone rushing place to place
black friday
XDDDD
i hear LL is better then idol master
as i get back
big brain time
i used to play the first game a lot
i get reminded of GH games
and idk why
my phone just doesnt register some inputs
cuz of my phone
but i just wasnt into it
i played bandori
then will be in a war zone
of those idol/band games
just wait till theres another one
jii_delete AKeupho's friends
how
huh
well i say both series end up being good in there own way
man thats a debet to be going for a long ass time
but i digress
i say raise your flag sounds better
that MWAM made
database is like a well known theme
i played gundam vs gundam
if i watched gundam
if i was there
oh i most likely guess some ops
*its night time*
but i only know mostly ops and EDs
that be intresting
oh music quiz
im going to sleep too
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
if its not night time for me
bing me when that happens
yeah thats what everyone has been saying about it
or get killed
so you are going to need to throw somebody as a shield
there in a war zone
i mean she did let jackasses die
even if gods exists
i guess it shows how cruel life is
cuz god is trying to kill her
Tho one of the characters says it anyways
felix
HAHAHAHAHA
<@!87512939107450880> nice LNs there
the old school era
if you watched the first season of goblin slayer then watch the movie
It's all over the place
*looks at pirate sites*
Well
Im wondering if there going to drop the license for it
Hell the anime promo made it clear what it was getting into
They know what they were in for
If people read the manga
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
Funi is full of sjws
They wasted money
The main cast are nuts themselves
Run for life
Run
When I saw those manga parts I was like
There still the thirsty as hell girls scene
But we are not at the worst of it yet
Unless I'm mistaking
Cuz 4 is not out yet
Im pretty sure it was 3
And the slime had her hentai time
Ep 3 was girl on girl action
Like crunchyroll
But I wouldn't be surprised if someone else picks up
And that anime is like one of the big ones this season
Since there going to lose some
Maybe some money they could have get
cuz i mostly grow up with power rangers
idk much about sentai shows
lol i see M.A.O
cuz it was just sentai
i had fun with twintail anime
and he has a thing for twintails
the mc turns into a girl
yeah
lol
unless some mad lad decided to watch it that month
well at least it isnt no nut november
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
but what if we need to use the bathroom
mainly shonen anime
most of long running series
i could be wrong on that one
for like 7 or 8 eps
i only know of that one repeat of the same ep over and over again
haruhi i never watched
others are just there own thing
cuz i only had to worry about stay night
with fate i had less of a problem
then you are a god
unless we talking the VN
steins gate anime had to follow one of the routes
monogatari in the corner "hello there"
people say fate is hard to get into
cuz of the order
complicated to get into
like the series is a bit how should i say
i have yet to watch that series
welcome to my world
someone already made that post here
<@!238855496797257729> you are late on that one
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
yup
and IBO
like keijo
i didnt know she voiced few the characters from someone anime i already watched
and the roles she played
The character that made me look up mao
i didnt know of mao until one game i start it playing 2 years ago
i found it funny tbh
not related to the topic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkgJf965bHM
wrong video
wasnt sugita in one of the sentai shows
like kamen rider
like it
but i didnt watch many others
power ranger is sentai
XD
and the memes he makes out of it
tho i like his point of view on some anime
but he is cool
i dont watch all his videos
well the first 3 parts
since part 4 took place in 1999
i think
i find it funny how part 5 takes place in like 2001
since part 8 is still on going
since they dont really want to rush all parts
but that isnt until a year or 2
before part 6 comes
you still have time to finish it
he is great
scottthewoz
but his videos on other anime are good as well
i mostly watch his jojo videos
and even he knows it
but i even i have to admit his cringe sometimes
i enjoy some of his video
i only know of him cuz of lost pause
as they grow up
people develop there own sense of humor
but i did hear some good things about it
i never watched just because
and i dont even watch his videos
i see him on my yt recommend
nux
cuz it doesnt register some button inputs
on mobile
but damn are some of the commends a bit hard to pull off
thanks to the emulator
one of the games i play on my phone
i only played gundam vs gundam
isnt zeta after the og gundam
glass reflections was name of the channel
yeah i watched a yt saying i should watch those
it was expected not to age well
well given the og one did came out a long time ago
or watch the og one
but im unsure if i should watch origin
i want to watch the first one
i have yet to watch the main line gundam animes
princess principle is good
but rambling is something that can easily take you off track
i feel like he loves to do those videos
i stopped watching him
idk
well
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
you?
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
fate just goes full including other historical people from other regions
well most of the time in anime they use japan historical people
but never knew the name of
but after watching i find some old music i heard before
i didnt have much of a interested in music
before i watched jojo
part 4 is where he start it drawing characters more skinny
it was the trend at the time
big muscles and stuff like that
that was going with manga at the time
araki was just doing the trand
theres a mobile game for it
oh i know of yuki yuna
sorry
XDDDD
i was thinking of MHA
oh
im assuming here
and she was kicked out cuz she was crazy?
so togo has a family that works for the government
OUT
OUT
NOT THAT SHIT
NO
NO
OMG
oh sweet
coma
<@!238855496797257729> thats how life is
i didnt know anything about symphogear
but at the time i watched rezero
well i didnt know carol was rem until i did research
o boi
<:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
do that research
I loved both eng themes
Gx and 5ds were the best ones
and that was odd as hell for me
and now it turned into something else
i know FMA was done airing when they start it airing one of the tv channels that used to be just a cartoon channel
i think bleach was still airing around my childhood
bleach
with FMA
say that to my childhood
you say angel beats makes you feel old
memories
ah
since that one dropped
so its been 10 years
when the younger sister has the bigget chest
get scared for life
and watch as people that are new to anime
yeah its real
i think it is

sounds sad
i have some ghibli films on dvd
and i never really get to more arcs
were the 4kids ver of the animes
since the ver airing in my country
i havent fully watched DM GX and 5Ds fully
and it was nice fanservice movie
i only watched bonds of time
i have yet to watch the movie
somehow the card he need it was in his hand
on the tournament arc
kaiba also pulled that bs in the series
since that was when yu gi oh start it going down hill
when zexal can take that spot
idk how GX was the weakest in the series
i know the fate route adaptions are bad
UBW was fine
to a degree here
id like to dissagree
well not everyone uses there heads
like most people would tell to watch zero
and i was one of the people that start it watching it first
for watching the 2006 as your first fate anime
god bless your soul
im just going to say
<:CarolBlush:617039657896509460>
tho the VAs they get for that anime
classic china
sin one
oh
i think i may not watch that mess
and season 3
movie i have yet to watch
i watched only 2 seasons
one of the VAs is being sued
there can many things on why the show just get pulled off
and people can pull a shit toon of examples from there list
but funmation has a lot of fanservice anime under there belt
it could be that
but the other half most likely didnt knew
i think there were people that knew what the show was about
for anime
isnt amazons service dead
Passione outdid themselves with this one
it has more balls then what the manga showed
im hearing tux has something to do with it
but rest is smooth after it
part 1 maybe slow
is not that bad
jojo
it just falls short
but as a adaption
its ok
as a anime
when it comes to mana transfer
cuz thats how the main series is
and i think i get almost everyones endings
and i ulocked sakura and saber alter
only character i havent unlocked was the lancer from fate zero
suck my D
but gil says nope
i want to do all the finishers in that game
that only has parts of the VN in it
unlimted code is just a Fighting game
and some people are like you shouldnt start with zero
i remember reading the comments on one of the videos
then zero
then went to UBW
i watched 2006 ver
rest you can watch however you want
but just stay night
fate is a mess
yeah
then you wouldnt know what is going on
sonys excuse was smartphone gaming
and the switch
on the 3ds
nintendo pretty much relaying on them
like SD cards were fine
idk why they did that
those costed a lot
yeah
and i most have western games
i have a vita
in japan
and im sure the vita had a lot of VNs
if sony cared for it
that could have had a good future
rip that handheld
deen/stay night just ends up spoiling you on other 2 routes
joseph was a fool
tbh i feel like they did jotaro a bit dirty in the anime
and how they looked
with characters
but then again part 1 and 3 were following a trand at the time
happy about that
some people were not really
well he is a bit tall
i think same can apply to mista
but he is like 17
one of the characters looks short
i kind find it funny how in part 5
well as normal you can get in jojo
rest everyone looks normal
with flamboyant looks
part 5 is the only part that does it anyways
flamboyant
thats a better term
yeah
and there the bad guys
there is a gay couple in that part
if you look at them
but they look gay
im not trying to be mean
its common to change colors in anime
and in manga colorings
in games it was blue
the pink suit was anime only
i know part 4 takes place in 1999
or 2003
i think part 5 takes place in 2001
he has a book about manga crafting
even tho the characters look gay as hell
part 5 is where araki just showed his love for italy
and many people question many things in that part
i enjoyed part 4 and 5
part 3
it felt like they were just streching it
dio was a born bad guy
part 1 people would say its slow
cuz it felt slow
tbh i felt part 3 was a bit weak
i never used mal for finding anime to watch
the memes have been going to far
god bless peoples souls
if reviewers is there first anime
and think all anime are just porn
people are going to be in shock
~~despite me not ever playing it but i can say it without a doubt~~
i think the VN does it more justice
as much as i think stay night is a mess in terms of its anime
jojo is just a meme fest anyways
ok
they even called him the weakest one
wammu asidi and kars were more of the main  villians
then a main one
well santana was more of a miner villian
joseph could have killed him no problem
he isnt alive
i think he was killed off screen
when there stone
and hamon users cant do a thing to a pillower man
what more can i tell you
santena was writen off the story
he just brings up the points people seem to think he forget
he doesnt bring those up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AL1jlA4bfY
sun light
and nazis can emulate it
he was a dead man
im for real
since he had no way to escape
well he was just writen off
the dude was hot headed
and that was one of the sad moments
yes
and wasnt ceaser friend with one as well
he was just a friend with one
or anything
he didnt support them
i mean
but he was still a fool
where he shown some respect to his enemies
i didnt like joseph much until the end
araki was still making a name for himself as a mangaka
tbf
in part 2
you mad lad
i was thinking of watching that one
also i see striker witch
while woman who seems to have there best time
aka the school where the mc suffer
prison school
lol
i can see some smoke coming out
i doubt it
wait for real?
thats what yt was for me
wait ange old VA  retired?
so everyone is just not wearing pantsu
i know of dimenion w op
i never watched any of those anime
compare to the older ones
but madoka just happend to be one with more brutal deaths
i mean werent there dark mahou shoujo anime before it
since a friend of mine recommend it to me
now i think about i should get to watching more eps of little busters
to bother to watch something
hey sometimes it takes the right moment when im really really bored
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
it isnt that easy
then i may do it
until i have someone bug me to watch it
idk if ill ever watch madoka
until i see madoka
ill not bother with magia record
magia?
in terms of deaths
i wouldnt expect less from madoka
but with how brutal Fate zero and psycho pass were
and idk when fate zero novels came out
if i remember right
well madoka kinda pre dates psycho pass
well madoka was writen by the same guy how write for psycho pass and fate zero
for doing that
you are a a mad lad
omg
and the guy wasnt always a nut case
i read the wiki
wait are other characters isekaied
shes more so in big anger
while tanya is not crazy
i think thats a role where aoi yuuki can show she can do a crazy character
well a self proclamed god
and i know tanya goes nuts whenever she hears the word god
since i watched isekai qurtet
tho i should really watch tanya the evil
but maybe when i remember
i need to take care of
there still some unfinished anime
while i did pick up some back
or i forget about
cuz i get lazy
i kinda stopped watching some anime
i kinda stopped at 2nd half of season 1
tho i didnt watch a lot of railgun
or some have esper powers
but since misaka doesnt meet a lot of people that use magic
railgun is less about magic
cuz that series is a LN
LN
cuz im lazy
i havent watched it fully yet
yeah that start it in 2020
railgun
oh
it was in mid of 2019
ummm
it took then years for index S3
but it may never get it
that could get a season 2
i sometimes remember a random anime i watch
lets see what happens to them after the anime
wait thats that one anime that may not get a 2nd season
then i remember
cuz im bored
i sometimes feel like reading the wiki
so ill just leave it at that
but im not going to be that guy
and for what reason
and i know the person who give him those powers
well i spoiled myself thanks to the wiki
or having a heart attack
idk if i would be shitting my pants
i mean if i heard that shiit
and how much he is going to suffer
the song call of the witch perfectly describs the case subaru is in
but rezero is the one song that just makes feel the chills
there some anime tacks that creeped me out
i felt like i had chills down my spine
but that music track is scary as hell
since i think that track plays somewhere early on
not really a spoiler
when they had a test
in like one of the newer eps
or something like that
i think ainz said he was grade schooler
in quartet
to refresh my head on the plot
or just watch then in full
i may just skip to those parts anyways
so you watching it with all the extra scenes
i feel like knifes are already in me
that you can laugh at
cuz he has morons in his party
in a way
well kazuma you feel bad for him
since the main focus is her going after the being xs head
kinda expected that
on how she was a cutthroat japanese salaryman
for tanya
tho i havent get to that part yet
and subaru
kazuma
naofumi
i know most of the characters in quartet are at least HS students
in real life
or even lower class studient
isnt ainz a middle schooler
while being aehtiest as hell
fucking up people in the battle field
reincarnaded as a girl
im watching a salaryman
~~tanya would have a blood rush~~
but only one saving me would be being x
i guess shes not the only one
well
*looks at deadman wonderland*
that is just wants to be in battle
to me shes the example of a nut case
*he calls her a devil*
*the one with blue hair*
dont really like tanya
i know some of the higher ups
yeah thats what i call a nut case
since she wants to get back at the person that sent her into this hell hole
she doesnt mind
i guess at this point
like a high ranking officer
so just to be really high ranked
i kinda feel bad for some the characters now
damn
or is tanya the only one
Ainz is lucky he has a army in world his stuck in
Is just head scratching to me
But middle school being expensive
Well damn I didn't notice the year overlord took place in the real world
Or you find it on the wiki
My guess was you had someone who read it
But damn
Now that explains it
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
i guess will be just spinning the chairs all day long
son of a gun
or im just a dumb ass
unless the translations are fucking with me
it doesnt matter
XD
too much wisky
VN
of nine lives
i see a video of the scene
when i looked up the theme song
for nine lives
let me look up the ost
or something else
the ubw
at least rider stays alive longer this time
its where emiya gets his biggest shining moment
no give me 9 lives
that ultimate yeeeet
to see
thats what most people are coming for
with the spoilers on
time to share this around
if pics
<@!87512939107450880> doesnt work like that on mobile
as a spoiler
of the image to post it
you have to edit the name
*hyper mode on*
his going to have his piece of trash moment
when a man suffers death a lot
thats what happens
when it comes
guess i know what music will be playing
in broadcast order
may as well do it
XD
the dude just wants to do his job
he will get out of his piece of shit phase
in a way
deen/stay night also kinda spoils other 2 routes
also
cuz i was a dumb ass
why
then zero
i watched 2006 first then start it watching UBW
cuz zero takes place before it
zero spoils all the routes in a way
in a way
it kinda spoils both
like all 3 routes
its a prequel to stay night
oh boi
god bless your soul
if its 2006 one
them just trying to match them
in anime dubbing
tho thats was a common thing
since there trying to match lip flaps
in dubs
yeah thats what happens most of the times
when i was watching tv a lot
for yugioh i only watched Duel monsters GX and 5Ds
ill still remember those
for both seasons
i remember they used the jp opening
and then i watched the whole first 2 seasons when it start it airing on TV
and DVD
i remember watching digimon on VHS
was angel beats
the first anime i think i watched when i start it getting familer with the term
and beyblade
most of the time it was yu gi oh
that they dubbed
it was mostly some random anime
cuz when i used to watch tv a lot
there some classic anime i didnt watched cuz i never knew about them
one anime i havent watched yet
its ok
but i heard some dub lines
i only watched subs
since they have the license to konosuba
i think that was one of crunchyrolls first dubs
konosuba one was pretty much a well done one tbh
if its a newer anime
i cant bother to watch a dub
i didnt regret it
i watched some animes in eng dubs
have fun hearing kirito as shirou
oh boi
tho HF movies are good
pretty much
well other fate titles are in there own timeline
that those 2 spoil other 2 routes one way or another
but even i can tell you
and didnt play the VN
im a anime only
one way or another
cuz 2006 ver and zero are just going to spoil you on other 2 routes
fate is messy to get into at first
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
cuz he just hits the right spots
in terms of plot
but i heard it was shit
i havent watched ages
with char clone
if that emote keeps being used
having blonde hair
at this point ill get a pic of maria
of some characters
i never bother to remember names
you mean the one from zeta
wear a mask
to make at least one character
i feel like gundam has a urge
in terms of people that try to be like him
i hear people saying no one beats char
but i know diana is a badass
i havent fully watched it
what do you think of turn a gundam voy
g feels like its entering shonen/sentai area
yeah
~~and hear gilgamsh screaming SHINGING FINGER~~
~~or maybe watch G~~
i could just watch all the og ones
besides the ones i didnt finish
at this point idk what to watch for gundam
i still need to watch the 00 movie
and them putting a lot of gundam eps
sunrise
i can check
since i dont bother reading the novels
go ahead
when did toma die like a lot
what?
ummmm
and they just pulled a jojo reference in just one ep
i watched that one
you already said that
anything shonen related always has the best bois
Rider in zero is great
nice
ahh
berserk i always heard about how animes for it are shit
is the magi manga still on going?
well now that i think about it
the series most likely isnt going to be finished
if a mangaka goes on a break
or will decied to do it one day
hunterxhunter is still in a spot of maybe he will never finish it
yeah
if oda ever finishes that series i heard he was going to do a mecha one
~~i mean have a ending he want it~~
at least he did end the series how he want it
well kubo was sick if i remember right
if i remember right they also rush some mangaka
~~like pokemon battles~~
how should i put this
i didnt feel like watching it much cuz it felt like
early part 3 was meh tbh
yeah theres a point where even araki doesnt know what he wants to do with some stands
or something like that
since oda did confirme its like 70% done
tho one piece is most likely going to end at some point
ok im kidding
but the author was just like ~~**SWEET HOME ALABAMA**~~
tbh the arc the anime end it up should have been it for the series
and how the ending was shit as well
with how shit it was
i hear a lot about that arc
But even those
Unless I bring in some slice of life/drama type anime
I can't think of any
You get me there
But I may need to think about it more
Doesn't sound like something that would fall into fantasy
A show about people living normal lives without knowing about magic
Hmmm
In most animes
Isn't sci fi mostly related to space
Even if that wasn't bringed up
One day
For sure
It's going to happem
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
For bunny girl senpai the ending was far better
But she also needs to be protecc
In that anime
The biggest derp
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
the author is brutal
So we know she's a Wilde one
Nice cover art
Oh damn
Since I never watched it
Not sure about beck
Ok I guess k on can count
i have yet to fully watch that one
data squad
frontier was ok
tamers was meh for me
isnt the digimon movie like the end of the first and 2nd season
not this meme again
son of a gun
i still havent watched the directors cut ver of season 1
Of animation
Yeah there were still in that era
Or in early 2000s in Japan
Wasn't metabots made In the 99s
Since I watched metabots
It's been years for me
guess we know whos a berserker
the guy that sells metabots
tony?
and thats about it
i remember some of the characters
cuz i dont remember much of season 2
tho did he ever used that form in battle
in season 2
or something
tho i kinda expect him to turn into a bike
he looks like why am i here
but the anime itself didnt really feel like it was promoting anything
well wasnt medabot a game series
tho a medabot reboot would be nice
the new beyblade is still on going
a lot
didnt beyblade reboot itself
i feel like tamers was the point where they start becoming more darker
boom
would make my head go
starting a topic with fate
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
and im just like
i have friends that talk about football and basket ball
and football too
but i dont follow nba
i do love to play it
im not saying im a big fan of basket ball
for sure
thats a red
ouch
its not following the rules of the sport that well
i feel like you can only enjoy sports anime when you just be like its just anime
how is that a foul
huh?
"thats not right wheres the REF and isnt that iliegal"
you just be like
when you watch them as a fan of the sport
yeah thats what sports anime end up feeling like
after that i just forget about it
i watched few eps
with watching them
i may overload myself
cuz i just feel like
i dont watch a lot of sports anime
but i only watched few eps of kuroko
and slam dunk
and i only know of kuroko no basket
i like to play basketball
i think that also goes from others
in anime
yeah they like to break football rules a lot
lol
where you are coming from
i think i can see
it was on cartoon network
only football anime i watched was inazuma 11
but even i know of it
i never saw captain tsubasa
and the voice acting to me most likely didnt age well
they dubbed it here as well
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
derp
oh
i was asking
???
did she get elected or something
i guess that sounds about right
she somehow gets drunk when eating chocolet and kisses everyone
ah yes the girl with the white hair
where were we
anyways back to yuru yuri
but anyways
so i guess here
dont see anyother place for it
does she have white hair
yeah i heard everyone in that show is pretty wired
and do god know what to them
she would like akarins whole class
if she was a lolicon
*siscon
i hope i didnt spoil anything
well shit
i know her sister is a siscon
akarin the biggest meme ever
and lol
ill be left with finding more stuff
but even then
and finish
besides anime i need to pick up
but idk what to watch anymore
idk about that one
since a friend of mine recommended it to me
i need to watch more of little busters
*heart starts sinking in deep*
but
i didnt watch much
and your lie in april
yuru yuri i seen some memes about it
idk if ill bother with accelarator
and then try to watch railgun
well i really need to watch season 3
and index
or play the VN
steins gate i have yet to watch
assassination classroom i watched
unless i have friends
i dont watch much anime
of what it did
and i know
and i didnt watch it
in a big way
well its a anime that changed the mahou shojo genre
then you know what you get yourself into
and if you saw madoka and psycho pass
yeah zero was written by a different person
just asking
i meant electrocute
ok now what to talk about next
and say it
well i was about to go over there
i think some those that read the manga know whats the author going to do
its about Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai
well now that nisekoi is still on topic

if you ask me
now thats just a bad way to insult someone
what is this
<:GWnoneMeguDed:384871020735102978>
the one trap i hear people talking about a lot
is that the girl from nisekoi
so it will come
i mean time flys fast
if the manga is still on going
but my question is when are they going to stop making more seasons for it
it was going to happen
well given the show is a success
lel
same
like there willing to shoot the man
cuz the girls would kill him
be dense
he has to
about what he wants
well the mc is blunt
i dont remember s2 being one
until S3 get fucked
date a live was ok
with kirito being on top
it sure is
do you kno de wae <@!238855496797257729>
but i somehow had the will to watch it
cuz how mediocre it was
in season 1
i almost give up on to love ru
but it does have its fair share of sad moments
and how it ends
i know the plot
your lie in april i never watched
i finished assassination classroom and to lover ru animes
theres always something cut
since thats how i am with most animes
i was thinking it cut some content
wait for real
most likely a error
lol
And I'm sure the series is something I would drop dead at ep 50
Yeah there limits on what type of dramas I would watch
And idk if I'll ever watch it
But never seen it
I know of it
A old ass series
Legend of the galactic heroes
Ah yes
and it seems like something i may enjoy
since i seen some clips of it
i guess i should give in/spectre a try
i guess i just enjoyed the last seasons a lot more
this year
nothing peaks my interest much
im a bored man
cuz why the hell not
and yes i did watch the 3rd season of SAO
and few other anime are coming as well
that means SAO love is war
oh yeah we are close to april
idk what to watch
but after im done with that one
i really need to watch more little busters
since i feel like i would be entering a hole that i may never exit from
sometimes im thankful i stopped watching some anime half way
but i still dont like her
until it later on
chitoge to me was just a tsundere that really didnt seem to care for mc
*puts on a helmet*
nisekoi to me is just a waifu war zone
tho ritos character wasnt anything special
idk how well that would have end it
i mean if rito did end with a haram route
i heard that too
yeah
i would feel bad for rito
that puts rito in a lot of problems
thing is lalas character was mostly her making new stuff
momo mostly tries to get rito to have a haram
well in darkness i feel like momo just took more of a spotlight
i saw a yt video about it
yeah the author had a hard time
and i also watched the OVAs
It could be
In a way
Talk about a series about break ups
To use
And some of them were busted as hell
Thanks to gundam Vs gundam
From some series
I only know of mechs
Cuz I know there series that don't have that
I said most not all
Gundam Is always about war drama in most of there series
Since both series are in there own timeline
Well I say ibo and 00 are good starting points
At some point
Then I guess I may give it a shoot
If it's like a documentary
Interesting
Hmmm
Or something like that
Well most of them
With characters she plays
Aoi yuki just screams pink
i remember that anime
lol
was there ever a enemy like that in games?
i thought it was long done
wait the manga was never fully translated?
when it comes to undead
so shes going to have the high ground
shes a goddess
when i heard the news
i was thinking about that scene
god damn it
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
Ash like snow will forever be a song that will remind me of 00
Out of the ops
But not something I would look up to hear again
It was good
Ost
I remember mostly the ops from 00
FMA is pretty much FF7 of anime
facts
but i feel like its overrated
eva i havent fully watched
heard about it
you mean the biggest meme
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
As the series goes on
Or close to it
To love ru Is pretty much going full Hentai
I seen some ecchi anime and mayo chiki isn't that ecchi compare to other animes
thats a good one
lel
*dramatic music plays*
lel
and has some sentai in it
in both sub and dub
i think i watched that anime at least 2 times
cuz how much the mc was going nuts over twintails
the anime was funny to me
it was pretty much ahead of its time
yeah
i know the mc had 2 girls that want it to marry him
kinda
like the dude has a yakuza dad on his ass
that anime just makes me feel bad for mc sometimes
i seen some eps of it
I have yet to watch that
and its bad
thats the fate route
isnt toradora a light novel?
its also written by a different writer
when it comes to fate
also can i add another thing about not starting with zero
tho i found it interesting how that was nasu's first novel
Mahoutsukai no Yoru
only thing i find common are the characters from nasu's novel
to me they still feel seprate
even if there part of the same universe
when fate end it up being a big hit
nasu pretty much ignored tsukihime for years
~~wheres tsukihime~~
where a mobile game is cannon
at least its not like KH
fgo still has some characters that i didnt know about
yeah as someone who mostly had stay night animes played a bit of extra and few spin offs
cuz na translatons
im most areas
fgo feels like fan service
that is the dumbest thing i heard
having the best fate experince
FGO
*looks at shonen anime*
i can kinda get whats going on
as someone who doesnt read VNs
like i wouldnt recommend it to anyone thats new to fate
i hate how people in the jojo fandom say skip part 1
part 1 wasnt that bad
durarara isnt like jojo
durara is good
DATABASE
DATABASE
~~unless they want to do another arc~~
his too deep
not going to happen solo
i remember reading on the wiki nasu want it to publish Mahoutsukai no Yoru but he couldnt
i was thinkink of that
not tsukihime
Mahoutsukai no Yoru
he turned it in to a VN
then years later
have a feeling
but then i g
i could watch the anime
heres the thing about steins gate
steins gate i havent watched
renai boukun i also fully watched
mayo chiki i fully watched
since i kind forget where i lost stopped
blacksmith one idk if ill watch it to the end
and i dont give a crap
i know how it ends
2nd half pretty much was a big middle finger
but we didnt know it was anime
as we grow up we did watch anime
i know
and im just like well that was unexpected
but then i found out my older brother is also interested in some anime
while other is more so interested in big shows like naruto dbz yu gi oh
with my one of my bros not being interested in anime a lot
i was thinking i was the biggest anime junky in my family
in dub
my brother did fully watch it
i never fully watched it
i seen few eps of death note
ok i think that fair
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
cuz its still on going
hayate is never going to be done
cypher
and didnt have assistence
cuz he blackout
cuz i remember the author for that series had problems with publishers
isnt keijo done
keijo is a show where i need to turn my brain off
tbh
a meme fest
what about characters that dont have much character dev
but heres the thing
cuz it follows the manga
a lot
to brotherhood
people like to jerk off
FMA
i feel like i would want to see what happens in other routes
im just saying
im not saying its bad
on how they end
to see all those god damn routes
i would be forced to play the VN
i think the dude just loves to shit on it
i dont think crunchyroll would do that
and after he start it shelling for crunchyroll
i kinda stopped watching him after he start shitting on sao
*looks at mothers basemant*
it was ok
i honesty liked alicezation
cuz people will forever jack it to hell and back
cuz of its hate
sao will bring in more money
but problem is that
yeah accel world is better
and there hate bowners never end
cuz people want to shit on SAO
cypher
maybe cuz of you
idk why
for some reason i have accel world on the mind
LMAO
wait really
cuz the author based them on his wife and his wife screwed him over
darkness is where lala and haruna become side characters
tbh
darkness is where it gets good
cuz it feels so slow
to watch
first season is going to be a pain
to love ru
oh dear lord
i didnt fully watch the anime
well im going to get something to eat
few times
it made me feel bad for mc
hibiki anime i havent watch and charlotte too
nichijo i seen clips off
the world only god knows idk if ill fully watch it
bunny senpai i need to finish
as a manga reader
and i was disapointed with that one
the the filler movie
i read the manga when the movie was annoced
i need to do that
of T7
i havent read the newer chapters
wrf
cats
whats the word im looking for
most haram mcs end up being
arata is a total bro
it made me like all the girls in that show
trinity seven was good
for that one
i read the manga
i kind lost interest
2nd arc
the first arc i found interesting cuz everyone was locked up
cuz my brain is on overdrive
went derp there
sorry
now days i think the first season is already
like the 2nd season i really liked
and i was thinking it was good
i watched sao
thing is when i was getting back into anime
cya
86
that looks familer
cuz the show it self is just a random fest
the irony
like same season
didnt they came out at the sametime
that kinda feel like oppisets in feelings
how they both voice characters
i just found it funny
voice in that anime
cuz the bunny girl senpai and the mc
carols have you watched rising of the shield hero
so pretty much he knows how to set dates up
i know the mc in god only knows is a big VN fanatic
she just likes to think about her swords skills
yeah yuki is pretty much the one that doesnt fall in love with him
sao talk
im just like
when it comes to girls
my brain goes off
cuz i went to watch something else
and i stopped
i watched few eps
~~i know there not related by blood~~
~~incest~~
on when to make a come back with sao
to have a good start
it took him sometime
son of a gun
well wasnt SAO like his first LN he writen
the prologue doesnt cut it for me
ggo i have yet to see her in a do some real dmg there
in terms of what he has
well kirito pretty much has the upper hand
of progressive
i read at least 1 mor 2 chapters
for her self
mother rosario was the asuna arc
yeah reki just loves to cock block her
liz would be the first girl to take a shoot at him
yes
*fbi alarm*
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
shizwho?
like fucking with her mentally
i saw few scenes of tatsuya teasing her
everywhere
baits
even tho at that point shes in the safe zone
and she is just thinking about not dying or being exiled
with all the characters in the game
like how bakarina doesnt get she made a haram
and i love it
im watching my next life as a villainess
didnt brave witches came out long before honkai 3 was a thing
the cooking one is purely 2d
wait
is it the cooking one
<@!453836798796234762> honkai has budget cuz weebs
pricing online is a mess
and ends up dying
where a dog suffers
in jojo
it happens a lot
lol
for some people
CGI ends up being one of the drawbacks
there was scene of dogs getting shot
well in some other works araki did
so jojo to me wasnt that bad
i seen enough shit that happens to animals in anime
*kicks down the door*
2010s idk if I would call them dated
I see most of the 2000s anime as dated
Lol
i have a bad feeling about this
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Filer arcs
Why
But Naruto would be a nightmare for me to rewatch
I think his just watching random clips
Or just seeing random clips on yt
My brother is rewatching naruto
I mean it could be worst
That that may or may not be important
Cuz I really don't want to rewatch few eps
On what ep
I get to remember where I stopped last time
And I forget to watch more of it
I tried to rewatch bleach
Or not much interesting stuff in the beginning
I know most of the long running anime kinda end up having a dragged out start
In few weeks
I mean what do I have to lose
When I can
And ill try and find time to watch it
I already get gintama recommend
And I know the manga ended for gintama
When I get to the good stuff
I feel like my brain is going to become fries
I watched few eps of it
Idk how it changed into that
Auto correct
Gintama doesn't come to my mind since I didn't watch it much
God damn it
Is it shana
When I bringed up toradora
I didn't even had aria on the mind
But toradora does seem like a 2010 anime If you ask me
But I guess my brain went full derp
I was thinking toradora came out in 2010
I think toradora came out in 2010s
Familer of zero is a 2000s anime
And has serious arcs
I think that's how I would describe gintama to a degree a anime that has fun making meta jokes
Or anime adaptations
I remember I saw a video of gintama making a joke about the filer arcs
I think Naruto kinda has bad filler arcs
Thing is hibiki mentions sometimes about her not having a boyfriend
Kinda
Well....
Well now that depends on the context
Maybe I should have worded it better
I mean best friends
Cuz many things have lost there meanings over the years
When a certain point is reached
Yuri bait is going to lose its meaning
As they say the mobile market is the one making a lot of bank
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
And if not
And the characters go for someone else
Unless it doesn't go anywhere
So I can't really call some shows that have Yuri as bait
Well to me Yuri bait isn't a term that has entered my system yet
She holds dear to her heart
I like to think of it as hibiki thinking about her as a friend
Yes
Tbh if hibiki and miku turn out to be gay for another it wouldn't be a shock
But she was a male I think the script would have been different
If she was a male I would think they would be a couple
I just feel like I almost been hit by a bullet
I say it's close
In hibikis character
Yeah the dense part does play a role a lot
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
I'm not saying she doesn't I just see them as best friends
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
More like a storm
Jesus what have I started
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
But I'm not really sure if hibiki truly has feelings for her
They do have feelings
If my want my honest opinion
I would say yes
It already happend
I want to go back to talking about pso2
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
~~never does it~~
My mind is always get the fuck out of work
Pretty sure during work hours it's off
The inpure mind is kicking in
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Yeah she's dense
Where one girl is in love with another one while there in a relationship with 2 different guys
I think I seen that one
Wait
NTR?
Route a doesn't follow the manga
AoT pretty much get a lot of banger songs
i kinda didnt care for season 2
yeah
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
~~I stopped somewhere when they discovered what was in the basement~~
After reading the manga I was like idk if I should watch the anime
While season one had me wondering
I watched it wondering what was the hype all about
God bless your soul
If someone picks up a twin tail fetish after finishing that anime
Kaos is pure
Ababababababa
Sometimes
With how badly she want it hiro
But I had a dislike for her
In fairness I didn't really hate her all that much
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Well I never really bother to read lns
Since I'm not a ln reader
Well I never really noticed
That gives the lessens
Its always hentai
I kinda expected her to go that route anyways
Lol
Im laughing
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
What hell did the author do to eran
And I'm like jesus christ
I seen some spoilers
If it was just about the titans
It would have become boring anyways
Tbf
Why do I have a feeling this going somewhere I don't like
Pieck?
That could make someone think it is a hentai
Out of context
All for lolicons
To someone's mother
Sounds like a insult
But not really sure on what it means
I heard that word before
Is that spanish
And this why people go for fansubs
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Or censor words
Most of the time that stuff is going to make things wired
Official subs
https://youtu.be/YTkcwhJAm8M
JESUS WANTS A HUG!
Where Alucard gets to Rio and says
I think of that scene from hellsing ultimate abridged
When ever someone brings up brazil
God damn it
To me armoured titan was kinda obvious
It was kinda obvious
<@274279989506211841> lol
~~looks at her mother~~
and never play it again
at least once
fate/stay night is one VN i would play
well both are bro cons
iliya is still a bro con
it was my first fate anime
i watched it
but we all know how that one turned out
||only time she doesnt die is in deen stay night||
||i hear she dies in every route||
idk if i should be saying this but ill put it in spoiler text
That's what I think at least
Well she would pick up something from her
A tsundere
Would she be like her sister
But I'm just wondering how things would have been if sakura did stay with her family
We all know that shirous haram skills are ss
Would she have the love she had for shirou
Tho I wonder how things would have turned out if sakura did stay with her family
But he done goof
Tokiomi was thinking he was doing the right thing by give one of his children to another mage family
Oh yeah I forget about melody blood
If nasu ever decides to release the remake then there could be hope
But the problem is that not many people are going to bother with the VN
So what really is there for people to know
Well tsukihim is over shadowed by fate
Yeah I kinda have to agree with you on that one
I mean if shiki was willing to kill his own adopted brother
I remember in the anime shiki just killed arcueid the park
They really went there with him
Dear lord
In people
He has eyes that make him see weak points
I shiki is a different case
From his past
Shiro I feel like he suffers
Shiki is a wired dude
He went for the abusive owner
But nope
And he could have been respected more
Like the man could have chosen any other girl
Saito most of the time gets abused for just being with another girl
ZnT?
Like she beats her man more times then how most haram mcs get treated
Oh Louise is worth slapping
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
Rie
Cuz childhood
And there some anime I kinda have a bais for
I grow up in the 2000s
Idk if I can watch some 2000s anime
Since a lot of popular anime have been delayed/postpined
And idk if there going to go for s3
So I can finish s2
I may wait for it to finish airing
I need to watch more kaguya sama
I haven't watched much anime
*forgets*
People still cry for ngnl
Few years later
Only to be picked up again
What isn't going to get shaft
Not sure if she was still going to be related to kire
But they put her in fate
I remember reading that she was going to be a character in a tsukihime sequel
Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't kires kid go there
Atlas academy hmmm
Melody blood
I was thinking it was its own thing
Pfft
So it's a yuri syndrom
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Cuz I imagen that going a lot of ways
My head want full da fuck did the MC do with female variants
Now I really need context
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
That syndrome
Tbh I do feel like there's more behind it
Making the whole anime feel rushed kinda
That get a really bad start
At least it wasn't like that other ln
Well call me impressed
22+
*looks at index*
They have to add one fuck up in there
Well jc staff is not known for keeping there quality high
I just felt ehh about it
I wasn't angry
The spin off felt kinda random to me
<@87512939107450880> in fairness the spin off isn't really anything special
Never get nobu
In tsundere roles
I don't really think there's anyone that can top rie
Cliché
That sounds
My brain is burned
Nope
Let's be thankful she is not willing to kill another girl that he talks to
Since most people know how sakura is treated as
Then anyone from the leaf
She was at least more likable
For naruto
While she was a stalker
Out of all the Naruto girls
Tbf I did like hinata
And that's why I used tsubasa emotes
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Something smells fishy here
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
But the novels can change my view on her
I say her character is ok
To when all the Naruto characters were kids
Tho there was a point where they went back in time
Early eps kinda felt like early Naruto to me
While there things that make it different from Naruto
Of boruto
I only watch few eps
To me early boruto kinda felt like early Naruto if you ask me
Can't really blame the man for trying to get more money
While I have some problems with boruto
And then he start doing boruto
Then we can be thankful to his wife
I'm happy the author at least made the right call with the couples
Just for that to happen
And it took like 500 or more eps
All cuz the author want it have the bro and sis married
And people still being it up
That meme is dead
I swear
That I remember
If talking about the princess and the MC stuff
I may have forget some details
It's been a while since I watched it
From what I remember it wasn't that confusing to me
I only watched the dub
Idk
That means they agreed with the authors terms
So if there making a anime
And voice cast
I hear the author didn't want a new shaman king anime until they get back the old ost
But given this is from the same guy that did FT and that one has its fair share of people who have a hate bone
And I say it's kinda ok
I read a bit about Eden zero
I read a artical saying there going to bring dxd novels to the west
But I think it's mostly the same
If I remember right
Progressive also has a light novel
Now that I think about it what other works does he have other then Sao and AW
To some other works
Since I feel like reki would want to move on
If it both series were in there final arc
I wouldn't be surprised
Hmmm
Also is accel world in a final arc
I wonder what happen
Well damn
As a LN
I was thinking Sao was still on going
Why would they reboot it
And I'm like
Cuz I been seeming videos saying they may reboot sao
Tho I'm wondering what's next after the Alicezetion arc of the anime
To see kiritos fixed character
Of it
I need to read more
<@274279989506211841> kaguya would consider her dead any day of the week
as a anime only
yeah even i can say the anime adaptetion is weak
<@!274279989506211841> cuz she has a love life
And make a story they can keep crafting
Not everyone wants to try
I watched enough harams to know where they are going
When it comes to harams
People love waifu wars
Then the movie
I need to watch season 2 and the OVA
I kinda forget ishigami and chika end up having a bigger part in the story
True
Kaguya mostly focus on a 2 characters
Who's going to start a riot
Cuz there's always that one person
You can never have a everyone happy
That's how my brain is with harems
It's going to start a storm
I don't care who wins
At that point I was like
Cuz the girl that was choose end it up being called trash
But then it turned into waifu fight
It was interesting
Yeah something like that
There many things that are ironic about japan
But they can't do that for all other anime they work on
A1 puts everything into SAO
I also heard he had a thing for guns
The author is the one for kinos journey
That's a ln
Oh
SAO:A?
And here comes the bot
Js06 is that the person that translated all the index vols
I mistaken a LN being a manga
But not the first time
<@152896851660505088> I was thinking the source was the manga not the light novel
I was thinking the slime anime was a manga
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
In terms of sells
Wait is it really that big in Japan
Wasnt it like a year or 2
Kirito Broke almost all arcs
I know
With AWP in csgo
Just reminders me of people that try to be that cool
Sinon being a tryhard sniper
It was when the girls were talking about there strategy
I remember Sinon was mentioned in one ep
Full demowoman
I just like lenns character arc
I would happily watch it again
Too me that's one of my fav spin offs
Like a idiot
I remember I always run p90 in cs
For smg it's p90
For me my fav AR would be the classic m4
Or has
When you could have just made the next arc
I just don't get why make a filler movie arc
As a ok movie
As a manga reader
And that one disappointed me
The last anime movie I had to will to watch was trinity seven the first movie
But he still picks up chicks
I knoe
Or me not just feeling like watching a movie
My laziness
Idk what makes me not watch it
And idk if I ever will
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
And I didn't watch it
Without watching that movie
But alicization can still be watched
I know it's cannon
And before anyone brings up the movie
3rd arc he picks up 3 or 4 AIs
2nd arc he picks up a try hard
Kirito just picks up random chicks
First 2 arcs
And his "childhood friend"
Teacher
He gets his underclassman
But I knew when he get back he was going to rekt shit
I didn't expect kirito to become brain-dead mid arc
Like it's so easy to read what happens next
Time for me to do the shit I was doing in other arcs
Then when he wakes up
For the most of that arc
Alicization just kicks kirito in the balls
In mother Rosario he gets killed
well it has a new anime
fruits basket is old
poor ishigami
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
and man did ep 11 give the feels
so i catched up to kaguya sama
besides playing consoles
who hell uses tv
in the current year
like the west liked to censor stuff that now days seem dumb
that was when tv was still a thing
well we have to remember
yeah changing things can make a show hard to sell in the west
with how much she want it to be in hiros pants
i used to hate her
as soon as ichigo start it making moves on hiro
i kinda expected franxx to go to a shit show
when A1 gets there ass working on it
i was not ready for this
like i just felt sad i almost cried
i hear the reason ichika is dense
like woman you have 3 girls that want to go full lesbo mode on you
but she still thinks they would go for her
that maria could have dated
like she doesnt realize she changed all the characters
you know what kinda bugs me about bakarina
ecchi doesnt really work at this point for the series
she changed everything
when in reality
alive
bakarina just thinks about keeping her ass
then a anime girl who is late for school
yuuki riot trips more times
Then shirogane rolled 6 and saved him
I sometimes wonder when writers write MC with bad luck
Madoka magica is pretty much that
I think I saw a clip of it
But I just think people praise it too much
I haven't fully watched eva
At first made me a bit uncomfortable
KLK
Oh god
I haven't watched that one
I didn't know how to feel
But when some Changes happens
Gurren Lagann was good
When gainax disbanded
Wasn't Gurren Lagann one of there last animes
i never read it
back when there was that one animated video about it
i also knew about god of highschool
the only manhwa i read was solo levler
i didnt hear about tower of gods until last year when it get a anime
it may not be what there selling
careful what you wish for
theres never enough
it was a fun one to watch
i watched that anime in both sub and dub
idk if ill watch it
i havent watched that one
with magical girls
sentai
all i can say about that is
kampfer was just a shit show of a haram to me
cuz the girls are willing to kill him
is cuz he doesnt want to get killed
its all too much ecchi
hot as in has a orgasam when she acts like a evil bitch
in a way
but her and levi are related
to a degree
eran does have a point
in fairness
cypher <:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
they can draining
i watched enough mecha in my life to know one thing
fang doesnt really work well irl
nichijou can be watched in clips
this what i was going for me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSbwStWHtzY
the return of the Y boner
with one of the characters
and it was kinda easy to know what was coming next when i watched it
i out of boredom watched Kawaikereba Hentai demo Suki ni Natte Kuremasu ka?
at this point
i may pick up the manga
and characters
tho the series does give a focus to someone of the other members
kaguya is slowing starting to give less of a crap about her pride at this point
tho i can tell one thing
the anime sells itself as a fight between 2 people that cant confess to one another cuz of there pride
the characters are a selling point to me
and man did it end with a bang
so i watched the last ep of kaguya sama
cuz thats there baby
sunruse would still make more from gundam
but i heard she was a crossdresser
idk where i stopped with ZLS
isnt that just fun
i shoot myself in the foot
well crap
with how much some terms have been thrown around
thats why i said i cant help it sometimes
cant help it sometimes
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
in this case the the boi would die thinking about not having his girlish face anymore
idk
and rest are girls
you mean one trap
waifus
and the match starts now
now the swords are out
lol
we know another seasons is coming
<@!238855496797257729> welcome to hell
like i always see her somewhere
the one voiced by MAO
is the bookworm character
one character i seen and i cant really escape
oppps
i was thinking of watching idol@ster
but shes my 2nd best girl
i kinda have a biss for maki
theres also all star
it doesnt really matter
but at the end of the day
i think i lost my account
same
a friend of mine get im interested in watching it
now good luck escape the hell
welcome to the club
was macross always about singing
~~and soup operas~~
well we know drama does sell
and then all the boys just want him burned
where the mc just drinked a love potion
tho i did that once scene funny
and i awakened someones inner fan boi
idk where i stopped watching that one
<:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
like that anime with sun chan
i guess one anime i could pick back up is SNAFU
its going to be a steamroller
where i lost stopped at
i have some much stuff to remember
or didnt finish
but now days i may as well look back on the shows i skipped
that may get my interest
cuz i was like other anime to watch
never bothered to watch it
no
when i first saw it on kissanime
tho i did think about watch about watch grimgar
glepnir
i was thinking of a different show
LMAO
if the official ones cant do it justice
i guess thats what fansubs are for
i have yet to see or bother to watch it
what you been up to
hi
<:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
i kind went ehh about astolfo
after that scene with jeanne
astolfo
oh god
is far different
cuz seeds in terms of art
or did they help sunrise with it
wasnt seeds done by a different studio
say that to seeds
you really had to suck the main timeline a lot
god damn it sunrise
and whatever comes after it
after that god knows if i can watch zeta and double zeta
i need to watch origin
son of a gun
is that one in the same timeline as the main gundams
tho im not sure about the wired mc part
with all of there series
well gundam just screams all of those
<:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
need a fish
<@!238855496797257729> <:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
cuz this could go the gundam route
where do i bloody start
cuz thats one of those i question
but never get into it
i always heard about macross
with some anime
god damn it i feel so out of the loop
<:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
cuz i feel like macross was trying to be a comaptitor to gundam
of that anime
i stopped somewhere in season 2
oh that one
yes
rest to me was history
i just remembered the ending
2nd one i didnt hear
the first op never get stucked in my head
not the movie
the anime
now that i think about it i dont remember the op that well for AW
i liked the ending theme more then the op
that didnt know what to do with its characters
Seed to me end it up being a shit show
gundam seeds
more so it suffered in the story department
well seeds didnt really suffer with its artstyle
but when is too early
but A1 beat them with SAO
then most gundams i seen
~~im not sure if god of highschool is from korea or japan~~
since it was that one manhwa/manga i hear people talk about
but god of highschool i could check out
idk if ill watch tower of gods
i may watch god of highschool
thats all
for me its rezero and SAO
~~mainly the one i always just get a feeling of coming back to~~
and then me trying to catch up with gacha game i stopped playing
dont have anything interesting to watch besides maybe one or 2 anime next season
cuz im bored
at this point its just watch whatever i want to
i only relay on websites
i have no blue ray
dude
but idk how long it will keep me "interested"
ok ill try and watch sns again
ok i think i passed the filer arc
now that i remember i think i watched the first 12 eps
thanks JC
with some original stuff
so i may or may not have wasted my time
oh son of coucrouch
or original
the first 12 eps of season 2
wait wait wait
"idk if im coming back for another round"
and be like
my brain would go out to the window
i think by the time im done with the series
try to guess what ep i watched
or 2
just so i dont get lost
so one i would need to rewatch all of season 2
my brain doesnt remember the last ep i stopped on
cypher one problem with that
its going to make him feel pain
no matter what he does
Out of curiosity I want it to know if I can recognise any of the voices there
Since I did play my fair share of Korean games
Funny enough I want it to hear the Korean dub for tower of God
Now I'm wondering how God of high school is going to be
It shows the man has a lot of care for the work
If crunchy roll plans for another one
Well I need to wait a year for that
Mother of god
<:GWmythiMonkaT:407618804592541696>
And I can't believe this series is 10 years old
But I also heard the webtoon is on heitase
Having some missing details
Well I can clearly see that in some characters
<@114081181611458563> if you mean read the webtoon from chapter 1 I think I be a dead man at that point
Rak is the best dork
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
And was it was a good time
OK I just finished tower of god
and i just checked god of highschool is a manhwa
tho i found it interesting how crunchyroll decided to take some web manga
idk about that statement
<:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
AoT S2 ending always give me a wired feeling like it fits in a haunted castle
at this point broken eng is japans biggest meme
can you sent me links to hear them
i think i skipped the endings
now im starting to think the song was kind of a letter as the series would get new composers
she seems to love LNs a lot
i didnt realize same person who did index ops was the same one for shana
when i watched in SNS
i think thats the only op stuck in my head
i love that song
thats the first op right
oohhh
gundam seed
wait
>seed album
well looking on the bright side
im still in season 1
i havent finished it
since i did see log horizon
database is also good
oh yeah
~~i know im kinda of a basic bitch~~
like the only songs i really like from them are rise your flag and seven deadly sins
coming from someone that is a fan of MWAM and likes only 2 of there songs currently
about the artist
whenever i learn something new
sometimes i feel outdated
move
then
let me see that video
oh
<:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
then there eng is most likely good
unless there american japanese
Shoot me in the leg
Yes I'm going there
And the bad father
Only thing I would say is common for those 2 are the duality between the 2 best friends
Idk if I would call Code grass like Gundam seed
<:KanadeLewd:690470896174891008>
Then thats entering the fun part
If there single
thats what mangas and LNs are for
the whole og series
<@!676272618839605249> how about gundam
well that want east and west real quick
someone sold me logh as a documentory
and dont really like the quality of it
if you are a animation nut
idk about picking up a old series
sounds sounds like a idiot case
yeah i knew it
eps
isnt the series way longer then 70+
but never watched it
i heard some good things about the anime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDnu0giUS00
real quick
hold on i need to post a joke here
if you ask me
and i like digimon more then pokemon in some areas
cuz i could be pokemon or digimon
i cant remember my first anime
i was watching anime my whole life
but never watched the anime
thats one series i seen a lot on the net and games
and i stopped somewhere around ep 50 i think
i think the only old anime i watched was yu yu hakusho
if the anime is old
at this point spoilers dont matter to me
of the anime
from what i seen on clips
he was a running joke
that one went over my childhood
but never watched it
i heard about it
cuz it cant be escaped
everyone needs some shoujo in there life
when i watched it
i didnt have a problem with AoT
i think it could have been both idk
or the artstyle
with how it was animated
he also said to me he didnt like attack on titan
since i kinda felt lazy
but i havent
my brother watched the og dragon ball
at the time
well in fairness its toriyamas humor
i never seen kai
i think i could go back and watch og dragon ball z
i cant go back to some old anime
But I may
I havent watched season 2 yet
Queen
Yasss
She is always the one with best faces
lol
it get to that point
WOW
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
PFFT
talk about getting away with a rip off
lol
guess some EU regions were just not airing it
i never seen it on TV
OMG
lisa always gets the ops
the underworld is busted to the point of people that played GGO can use there guns
wtf
ok
PFFT
it was funny to say the least
and what she can do with it
and starts talking about the library
and puts glasses on
of her going chibi mode
i saw that one clips
not really a MG guy
full term for MG pls
the op for MG?
sorry i was watching a trailer for something
as a ninja
well i think he played his role too well
god i felt bad for him sometimes
guess his too good at being a ninja
by everyone
and he would get forgetten real quick
i remember one character who was a ninja
i used to watch that one when i get back from school
god
i also noticed he directed keroro
apprently he did only one ep of it
according to mal
and 0080
he was also on storybored for gundam zeta
i know next to nothing about that series
i saw it on twitter
i seen a screenshot of it
i only know of it cuz of memes
i never watched the office
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
i worked in a super market
i cant related to it
new game is kinda like the office
XDDDDD
with some of his orders
levi is just a total nut case
i read that part
LOL
but even then blu rays are kinda a dying media
and blu rays
only thing left is streaming
i dont even look at tv this days
since i dont have channel that has dubbed anime
but idk for sure
where im from i think dubs are still on going
but even i have my limits
i can enjoy a dub
god it feels like im watching a poor ver of the eng dub sometimes
but when you hear it in other languages
as a kid you can let a dub slide since you dont know any better
i cringed
and let me tell you
last time i bothered for something dubbed in my language it was shaman king
let me live with it
yeah i know i screwed up
~~they want a italian dub of part 5~~
~~say that to jojo fans~~
now days
i cant bother with dubs
oh pls
but im not really interested
thanks for the reccomendtion
i cant go without a ad blocker
on pc
unless i want to use it on a phone
been a long time since i used that site
kissanime
and that can fuck with me
sometimes i judging anime by there artsyles
*facepalm*
oh right
~~and gets reminded of symphogear~~
maybe the artstyle had me thinking it was 2009
can someone remind did madoka came out in 2009 or 2011
with that
but i know what im getting myself into
maybe i would watch madoka
MG arent really that interesting
~~when you watched too many shonen and anime that just adverise toys~~
it screams 2000s
most of the time
my brain is just turned off
<:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
but i guess a order is a order
games getting a anime
this is going to be one of those
from watching the anime that was based on it
i kind feel turned off
the more i see someone saying stuff about the LN
~~i cant be bothered to read a LN cuz im a lazy son of a gun~~
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
PFFFT
to change someones color
a common thing in LN anime
that ass
god damn it
HAHAHAHAHA
spoilers do not scare me
in the LNs
is the world that depressing/despair
from anime
i think i was kinda burned out in 2018
you would be kinda disspointed as well
if you were born in dec
meme camp
or as i like to call it
<:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
didnt deen work on all 2 seasons of log horizon
oh pls
3*
i been there many times
oh pls
im not sure about that statment
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
not pain
at this point you are just going to feel shots
death march
yeah we know how that trainwrack went a gone
i never really understood
was just a meme fest
pop team epic
cuz i just loved it so much
anime of that year
but i think SAOA was my fav
bunny girl senpai was nice
never seen anime air on mtv
idk
being on mtv
i mostly remember south park
when did they air anime
mtv?
on the net
i think
i didnt start watching anime until 2013 or 14
happy sugar life
oh god
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
i only watched up to 2
but it just felt like it was dragging for a bit too long
im not saying it was bad
that arc kinda dragged for me
yeah
the irony of madhouse dropping one punch man for overlord
so WN LN and manga are just different vers of overlord
i hear some stuff about tog getting a 2nd season
wait
you mean another isekai
of the anime
and im at the chapter where they shown 5 mins
i just start it reading it
also found the name of the webtoon i read one chapter of its called kubera
i watched tog and i found the anime good
i may pick up tog and god of highschool
cuz i read few chapters of it
does solo leveler count as a webtoon
someone recommend it me to read it
but i forget the name of it
i read one chapter of a webtoon
i get a lot of dbz vibs from it
of adaptations
a new era
but never bothered to play it
i seen ads for that game on few videos
i was thinking it was that one korean anime that never aired
i didnt know it was a webtoon
and thats about it
i saw one animated trailer for it
but i never read the webtoon
i knew about the series before
when it starts airing
are you going to watch god of highschool
aya
dess
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but i had more enjoyment from mob then OPM
maybe i just dont see that much humor in it
i know we are still in the topic about overlord but i just want to say i dont really consider OPM to be funny
Ok
<:GWmythiMonkaT:407618804592541696>
~~don't kill me I'm too lazy to watch grimgar~~
Cypher when I saw your pfp I was thinking of bloodstain
<:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
In a plot if it makes sense
I could sorta buy the altering genetics part
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Says a lot about the author
And she is getting wet
The bed is on heat
I fixed it
She's going to show up in season 2
<:ShemHaWhat:727010581722431499>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
that joke is over used at this point
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
what
and im just like
<@!87512939107450880> ok i think i watched the scene
even if i didnt see the directors cut
ill still watch season 2
2006 Ver kinda spoiles other routes
Also be warned
Hf is 3 movies
2006 dub is kinda ehh
<:GWmythiMonkaT:407618804592541696>
Ubw may as well be a better place to start
No not 2006 fate stay night
Oh god
<@87512939107450880>
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
taiga has nothing to with it
unless you mean kire
when was there a 2nd teacher
what
fate stay night is more of a battle royal
and yeah kaleid falls in that catagory
well when you give it to someone that is known to be brutal in writing there stories
to me zero isnt even my fav
but i feel like i hit the mark on the few spoilers
not sure if i said wtf is this mess
it was my first fate anime
<:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
And up coming
Sounds like the current consoles
I could understand the price of it if it had some extra stuff
The prices on Blu rays are just really questionable
https://youtu.be/eRJyYfAq2tk
but there in there own world
made my jaw drop
that bloody NP
that
dropped
my jaw
in CCC
when i saw the NPs
to get a anime
and at this point i expect noblessing
that is also something that impressed me
read solo leveler
this best is yet to come
<@!238855496797257729>
until i get to the recent arcs of the webtoon
for now
and mira is best girl for me
there all loveable fools
all 3 are my fav
noragami has cool ops
I didn't realize the first ep was already out
I read the webtoon yesterday
Then get on it
god of highschool ep 1 is out
<@!238855496797257729>
To save them
If need be
The dude is willing to kill himself
Unless the other girls that looked down on him have anyhing to say
Subaru at most has 2 girls
dude i watched it
i just wasted my time watching it
like
cuz the first ep starts with that clip
<@!87512939107450880> looks like i didnt even need to watch the last clip from the directors cut after all
lol
That doesn't do much
Emilia ends up being the princess
Since at this point the memes are just shit posts
Jojo I can live with
And somehow it's still funny
At this point
It's beating a dead horse
Like come on man
I swear to god
Aya
People meme rem to death
And I'm kinda sick of it
To most people
At this point the suffering is just a joke
You read them
Idk
Any other series
In rezero
The author still loves to make his own characters suffer
He was in few eps
In there back pocket
The knights they all have some sorta op skill
Starts with a s
What's the word
Subaru is a bloody
Cuz it wasn't written well
Cuz people love to shit on sao
If you ask me
Rem kinda sees that
If you want
<@238855496797257729> I can run down the list of bitchs
And noblessing
But there's also another series someone recommend me to read
I may read tower of god
Since I'm still in first chapter of the story
But I need to get to those seasons
I hear later seasons get confusing
I love all 3 of the mcs
And it gets better
The day before ep1 aired
I read 42 chapters
I need to go back to reading God of high school
Rip
Ohh
Since I watched season 1
Been a while
Who voiced aldebaran again
Lol
OK I can agree with that one
^
At this point I wonder how Subaru is going to deal with the Ws
Here comes the spoiler raid
I'm getting benched aren't I
<:GWmythiMonkaT:407618804592541696>
To subaru
Beatrice is just a annoying mother
But it's going to happen
Not sure when
Since I know there few things about Subaru powers that are going to be revealed
Who knows she may do some work in later arcs
Subaru gets beaten has magic come form all sides just to protect a princess that doesn't do much
I meant it as in she's like a princess that doesn't do much
What spoiler
We over here having a meme war
lol
i just posted it
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
https://youtu.be/WdTagKn0cSM
Tho I have to say sun Chan really takes some things from her mother
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
https://youtu.be/rqJQESnMdN8 <@87512939107450880>
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
since my mind goes to some other videos
but never watched it
i remember gigaks GF made a video about that LN
i almost want it to say wtf
i dont like where this is going
and when its used for someones yt video about how it does a better job then sao
it just seemed like giving a the mc all the op shit
i never bothered to watch bofuri
bakarina
i loved llenn
the spin off was my fav
since when someone says GGO i think of the arc not the spinoff
then say SAOAGGO
and i can agree with cypher on that point
as cypher said only thing that made GGO arc kinda bad was kirito just using a sword
in the LN i think
tho for IS they explaned the reason why his dense
and no one will consider it a punching bag
thats memes
cuz of how bad the start was
i say people still like to use it as a punching bag
lol
also another thing about IS season 2 pretty much went down hill for me
no
i watched it like years ago
that you need to turn your brain off
tbh
kampfer is just a shit show
agreed
^
yet sao is still the biggest punching bag
ok infinite stratos i can kinda agree on
||tentacles sucking||
that shit
rap
LNs title of the year
unless
i expect deen to just bring another op
at this point
we are losing the database
ummm sir
a boring to watch season
was a bit of a ehh
season 2
s3
idk if ill watch danmachi
its fall
jk
or 2
next month
and ill be waiting
next year
just give me kaguya sama
when i went outside
and i was on fire
then tell me if its spring
over here
and feel the heat
come to EU
then idk what to expect from myself next year
if the anime of this year for me isnt god of highschool
looks interesting
hmmm
i was think your backlog must be full or you are short on money
when you said suffering
is your backlog that full
chill
i was joking
XDDDD
i meant the LN
great now pay SAO for 30$
i enjoyed it a bit
first half
tbh
the 2nd half it was boring to watch
ok i need to bring another point about the s2 of danmachi
the fanbase goes nuts on there ass
yeah but i can tell where that is going
and its looking at everyone reading
forget about that one
god damn it
unless the author pulls the haram route card
dumping his haram in the process
to me its clear as day there most likely going to end up with one another
if you ask me
i just think rakudai had better fight scenes
but i still like asterisk
i like rakudai over asterisk war
so we dont turn cyphers brain into lancelot
that there both have there qualities
can we just agree
ok
stella had the guts to confess
well in fairness
its going to be a gun fight
careful
OI
asterisk is still on going
tho i remember if julis won a big tournment she would be the queen of her land
lel
so shes getting ready for the weeding day
with ayatos sister
i was thinking thats what they were going for
if i remember right
yes
that other one
no
wtf
the maid
with this
i think you know where my brain is heading
you know when julis friend get experimented on
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
did you start
XDDDD
no
did you reread it
Asterisk war
<@87512939107450880> <:ShirabeToast:672245704118501376>
at the start of the ep
a miner character
one of the character changes
in ep 2
already noticed a change
lol
<:ShemHaWhat:727010581722431499>
welp guess ill go watch GOH
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<@!238855496797257729>
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
im dissapointed in you
aya
and i dont get pinged for gundam
so it did that part right
the whole point if the anime is to promote the manga
<:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
thats one of the things that bugged me about seeds
thats just sounds like his forcing himself to cry or is getting something ripped from his body
that isnt crying
i swear
its just cooking
it was dead for some reason on my end
and the link is dead
<:Znombu:701464491132453034>
Always the milfs
i played it and finished it
far cry 3
oh dear god
uhh
next weekend
at some point
i need to get to watching idolmaster
But I get used to it
I kinda had that problem with GFL anime
hmmm
i swear i heard that name before
dragons dogma
If it keeped on going with just killing titans
I say it would have been boring
what time is it for you
then there own mother
how many anime have kids bigger
in fairness
milfs be damned
cuz of the shit show that is twitter
i only know of it
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
i know
i know
oppai
smug as hell
thats her selling point
in fairness i dont think uzaki is anything special
there love for one another is too strong
even in death
jesus christ
I think this the part hectan starts shooting everywhere
Here comes the light show
Welp
i see
hard core collector
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
nice
is fbi memes
and i see
i know of that anime
theres going to be some knocking on the door isnt it
uhhh
when i come back from my walk
guess ill be watching gintama later
https://tenor.com/view/gintama-beer-drinking-nervous-startled-gif-9409703
but i never watched or read it
depends on the person
but who knows there could be really dumber reason
is her chest
i think the reason they hate her
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
and also read the webtoon
<@!238855496797257729> you forgetting someone who watched GoH
i think the girl with 2 guns
when i think aria
should we really expect the anime to adapt everything
at this point
Besides 2
<@226789636989517824> to me most girls are equal
LOL
I think the best answer is it's puzzle
LOL
someone get it
i mostly grown up with dubs
as a kid
in jp dub
i watched
were the only anime
i think FMA and bleach
but that was when i was a kid
i was like is he a boy or a girl
by eds voice
i was so wireded out
and this was the jp dub
i remember watching FMA
and i dont care for spoilers
since its old
not a problem
but i havent finished FMA
i have yet to watch FMAB
i heard the author want it the anime to go its own way
at least the first half of it
i say its watchable
2003
i watched FMA
was mostly anime that had to do there own thing
when in reality the early 2000s
and i love how people cry about stuff that was cut from the manga
the fight was creepy
and i saw it like a month ago on yt
back when they were a thing
well 4kids did air pokemon as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qLl145FqQg
they get that ver of the op
and since some countries used 4kids ver of the anime
no eng dub had its own theme
or remake it
i hope for the eng dub they reuse the 4kids intro
with the new cast
its getting redubbed
if shaman king gets a dub in my country
<:ShemHaWhat:727010581722431499>
cuz nothing picks my interest
idk what to look forward to this next few seasons
for anything
well the time will come
for me its jp or eng
but the author want it the old ost and cast back
shaman king could have been remade earlier
well bleach is getting a anime
anything from shonen jump
or dragon ball
I love that moment
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Hahahhaha
Show me pic
ZA WARDO
<:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
lol
carlos
~~and im lazy to read LNs~~
since im a anime only
but idk what that is
and i hear they didnt add some stuff from the LN
but s3 did get a lot of shit for how it was animated
same
thats something dal fans want to burn in ashes
well
but the 3rd season
well i can say first 2 seasons are ok same with the movie
but then he was like i have a girl to S for
she want it to shave all the details into him
lol
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
I sometimes think people expect too much for a adaptation
I kinda felt that in season 2
I kinda get where there coming from since goh did skip some stuff but that doesn't mean the anime is bad
Who ripped on it
Say that to ln readerw
But it was clearly rushed
I didn't hate season 3
i do like the characters
and the movie was also alright
well i did like the first 2 seasons
And it bugs me as a reader
But the anime doesn't cover everything
given what the cast is going to deal with later
i wouldnt say it was out of place
that part wasnt much
yeah
that was in the webtoon
i saw the wedding arc was adapted in the clip
since i did read the webtoon
i need to watch
Best anime
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
he was also writing accel world at the time as well
Yet
I haven't watched the movie
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
FT ost is nice
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
removed some light novels
i see it as a fusion of both
he loves his characters a lot
yeah it shows
since i still like it
i could look passed some of FTs mistakes
idk if ill keep reading
i read few chapters of it
plu or happy is mashimas mascote
While I understand this is a promo for the webtoon
And change of scenes
Just skipping some details ends up bigging me
I can give the anime that
The fights are good
But it still bugs me how much was skipped
Wedding arc was meh for me
And give shit recaps of them
They skipped the first 3 chapters
The anime skipped a lot
Last ep skipped a lot of details
<:GWcorbinTopKek:384871333705678868>
well not like index goes more deep with there powers oh wait
but im lazy to read LNs
and if i read the novels know who knows i may get a different view on it
but i only watched the anime
since i didnt get any ass pull moments
i forget some stuff about S1 and 2
but from misakas point of view
railgun to me felt like i was just watching season 1 and 2
and yet railgun kinda bored me
from killing titans
i feel like people start it thinking AoT went bad after it drifted away
Anyone who was in the pvp field can confirm that
https://youtu.be/Qb8T0Qway5o <@238855496797257729> <:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
Yeah all the antagonists ends up being the bad guy of the week
Idk why
Honesty the "rape" stuff gets forgotten form my mind when I think about sao
we all know its about the dumb stuff that happens in that and oxo
what story
I may read something else
After I get to the latest chapter of that
3 or 4 days ago I was on a reading spree on goh
Too lazy to watch anime currently
<:ShirabeWarm:688187807075926038>
I only saw one gif of it
I haven't seen this
Yeah
Let me look up the pic of the series
Hmmm
And I kinda lost mine
Spoilers always awaken someone's trigger mode
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
When I read goh ~~currently in chapter 443~~ for me I feel like there's still no real antagonist yet
Idk who my fav antagonist is
<:GWmythiMonkaT:407618804592541696>
that sounds kinda ironic
and stuff
but ww2 happend
well japanese were good at eng before
God of high school had a banging song
Tower of god was mostly showing ban suffering
Maybe goh op is bad
I can't remember a op that was worst or bad
I like the op1 for toradora
I forget how hanebado end it
Hanebado did the uno reverse card
Spoilers
Or just a bad mc
Idk if she's the worst
I watched that one
Hanebado
But I think I liked the 2nd op more
For noragami I loved both ops
So I was confused
Cuz I didnt know what the op 1 name translated to
The most common words end up showing a movie or something like that
Google is wired
What op is called overnight appointment
> 10) Overnight appointment- Noragami
Um what
When that series gets bringed up
I just feel bored
When monogatari gets bringed up
I feel turned off now
Cuz there first name always starts with a jo
That enter a hole full of trouble
Since it's always the jostars
Tho for Jojo it makes sense
That's the same case with akame ga kill
Any anime
I can't think of another anime that did that
I think hanebado was one of the first sports anime I watched that did the uno reverse on who is the protagonist and antagonist
The one with long hair
Last I can't talk about since I didn't watch it
I remember season 2 was good
Stiff
But ft changed studios
Yeah
That's not noticeable
With just that one cg
It's funny how people make the show seem like shit
To how much I can
But there's a limit
I can watch 2000s anime
That's kinda late 2000s
How naruto evolved in terms of animation
You know what's wired for me
Tho for my ears it's going to be the first time hearing the jp ost
Shaman king is most likely following the manga
Just to remember wtf happened
An I going to re-watch one piece
But no way in blue hell
I know I'm still in the alabasta arc
And I liked it
I watched just stops retrospective on ft
Orphen remake?
<:GWtoshToshinoSmug:405382560047300608>
I think Cypher is busy with his cameras
But you still can't escape the bars
Aya I think your bar is a bit low
With ft and race master
There was a ova
Lol
Rave master getting remade
People cried for dragon ball
That's series shouldnt exist
Pfft
Boruto
Watch black clover
Pfft
Cuz funmation
He was dead
For most of z
To a degree
Well his a bad dad
Oh
What's full term
Srw?
To me cell saga was a good final arc
For years before battle of gods
They didn't need to remake the movies
For that one
We can blame chi chi
Goten
That he was still cocky
Even tho it was understandable
Vegeta was a bad father during the cell arc
People see vegita as a good father
He just has some bad father traits
I'm just saying goku isn't truly a bad father
If there isn't something to to destroy the world
Since he has time to spent with his kids there
Idk about super
I'm saying there's a degree since he does care for his kids
Dude you didn't hear my points
tho chi chi is kinda at fault
he wasnt
tho i found it funny how bardock was made canon
Pretty sure it was known long before super
Most of the z movies aren't even cannon
still a little light of hope here and there
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Dess always hijacks
cuz no one want it to publish the game
i know 2 is a nintendo exclusive
bayonetta is platinum games
I'm getting benched
God damn it
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
Family connections
Too much how should I say
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
And I think it's for the better
Cuz it's anime
It's always covid
wasnt the manga a one shot
after its finished
all i see is the dumpster fire coming
but i think its better to just wait for the anime to finish
since i been spoiled on the ln
i know one thing for sure
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
God im going to hell aren't it
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
Has a boner eveytime he sees him and kills him <:GWcorbinTopKek:384871333705678868>
Cuz nasu
Ću is always smug
dess dess
You mean life that needs to be refueled
<:GWcorbinTopKek:384871333705678868>
Well anime are japanese cartoons
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
Excuse me
What.
*takes the glasses off*
>this Mob psycho **animation** is really **bad** lol
Nut cases after nut cases
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
But I remember that scene
I havent fully watched it
Lol
Fruits basket is gold
On the inside
Stop killing me
Deen
Being trash
I heard about the umineko anime
I call them the rie tsundere squad
The ries
Cuz higarashi fits right in
Did anyone read the story of that game
And me over here being like
People who saw the sinoalice collab were like well a higarashi collab was unexpected
But idk higarashi just hits high
I seen some shit in my life
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
I don't i have the guts for higarashi
And see it for yourself
Do you want to look it up
Cuz brutality is the that vn/animes middle name
It's infamous with a lot of scenes
Yes
So don't quote me on it
But not sure
I think that anime is based on a VN
Yes
oh the irony
Some people still cry for ngnl season 2
Oh pls
I just had clannad on the mind
Yeah cuz it just shaved in things from other 2 routes for no good reason
The reason I say that is cuz of the routes
I have a opinion where I see a VN anime adaptation to be harder then a manga or ln
<:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
<:ShemHaWhat:727010581722431499>
even tho i didnt watch it i can still see it where its going
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
too bad we all know where this is going
does there really need to be any progress
Let's move this to <#567740255273222175> <@263392442345193472>
Rock one
Global
Tho I like the main 3 a lot
Cuz she's my fav girl in goh
To get c. Mira
I did it on goh
Sign me in
100 free summoms
I mean my pfp doesn't give it away
Yes
That has the webtoon characters in it
Cuz of a gacha game
Only reason I picked it up
Hardcore leveling warrior
Tho I did pick up another webtoon
*oh... I can see the guns being drawn*
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
At least it's not tog
I know the webtoon is on a small break
I think it's out in like 4 or 3 days
To fully catch up
It took me like 2 or 3 days
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
But I also need to wait for a new chapter of the webtoon
I need to catch up with it
I see the hype is rolling in
Kaguya really loves to aim her guns at them
so idk if i spoiled something in the process
i forget to put the spoiler tag
lol found it
But idk if it's still in my laptop
I have this one madoka meme
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Even tho I didn't watch madoka I think of the MC when aoi yuuki is bringed up
Cuz she has a record of voicing them
When ever I think of aoi yuuki I think pink heads
the black swords comes into the play
but then
<@!87512939107450880>
god damn it wheres cypher when you need him
idk
cuz his sao characters op it seems
Lol
I think kaguya is the one getting nerfed
cuz history loves to repeat itself
tsubasa at this point is scared for life
i think ones in madoka need it more
In the game
With how much the rules have changed
Since I think I grow out of the series
Tbh I don't think I'll ever bother with rewatching yu gi oh
But I mean changes
There are
At this point you can pin that on all dubs
Since last yu gi oh I watched was 5ds
But I'm not sure about those changes
I think even arc v and vrains get censored
I knew it
In the west
Didn't konami get the rights
They went bankrupt
Of a yu gi oh
This was there last dub
4kids
Cuz they were mostly aiming young kids when broadcast shows
4kids changed a lot of things
Lol
Movies well some are hit or miss
Tho tmnt seem to have a lot of good cartoons
I remember watching it a lot on tv
That one was good
Yes
> 4kids also made TMNT 03. Which was mostly <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<@262326868366065664> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Cuz sonic x was clearly doing its own thing then shave adventure plots into it
I say loosely
First season was loosely adapting Adventure 1 and 2
At least the 2nd season
Sonic x was kinda weird
We don't know what we are doing anymore
And be like
Like pick up one piece
But they made a lot of wired choices
For them
Tho it's understandable
That's not for kids
But problem end it up being they just censored everything
4kids knows how to bring good VAs
Say hi to your lost brain cells
Welp
Back when jetix was a thing
On tv
Tho only dubs I remember watching were shaman king and sonic x
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Tfs hellsing ultimate on another hand
But early eps aren't really something that can keep me interested
I tried to watch tfs dbz
Gx I also heard bit of the dub
For me at least
And it's ok
I heard the season 1 dub
Since in eu most countries have there own dubs
I didn't grow up with eng dubs for yu gi oh
Thing is
I kinda feel like I may as well be called a boomer
Oh right that
You never know
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
And that is
Last few eps
Hestia pissed me off
In fairness
I'm assuming
You are not entering that rabbit hole again
Yup
Not like I went too deep
Well I guess it's going to be fine
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
To make another season
If the studio cares
Like you never know
But I was wrong
Cuz I feel like s2 wasn't coming
Why
Well I kinda spoiled myself thanks to the wiki
<:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
~~i know later on he gets some magic~~
Besides return by death
He doesn't have any powers
I can't
No
For the first half
I just viewed him as a idiot
I didn't really hate subaru
Looks like it's getting to the good stuff
And I really need to watch more rezero
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But I hear it gets better
The yt ep give me ehh feelings
I need to watch it
Then a prequel
On tmnt
Rise was more so a different spin
A lot of hot spins on things
And it throw me off
Ralph was the leader
Kinda give me bit of a ehh feeling
Tho the ep that was out on yt
Seems like nick has kinda give up on it
Rise end it on its 2nd season
Lel
Just wait when his done with both series
Shoot me in the foot
God damn it
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
But you read the ln
In anyway
I find it funny how reki decided to not make her related to kirito
But differently used
And both share the same move
Her
I mean he still protecc
Well she has a silver crow to keep her safe
You mean his leader/boss
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
For a min there I was thinking I was getting the full fire why
But that movie
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Too many holes
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
Here comes the inner LN reader
Cuz I didn't fully watch the first season
Forget about it
I heard madoka fucks with people that do the 3 ep rule
So question is all up in the air
Well it's been years
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
And still enjoy it
Man I would re-watch it
Even her mom sees the MC as a man of culture
Into darkness
Turning a pure girl
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736> 🗡️
Slip up
The best mom
The mom is like
so stuck in the middle
yes
wait DAL was never officially translated
she was funny
lol
besides the teacher
every girl was 50/50 for me
But I relay on buses and my own 2 feet
Well that would happen if I had one
Cuz at this point whats the worst a spoiler can do
And move on with my life
It's click i know it's a spoiler
For me
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
Cuz it's taiga
so ehh
but tbh i dont watch sports anime much
since it does kill the hype

<@!98541382393688064> i guess i can see where you are coming from with that one
<a:KirikaWhatRun:741321705850535996>
What is this
Mother of god
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
i see acclerator
so what am i missing out on
<:PusheenPopcorn:392663112219623435>
keep going
so it turned into heavy object
cypher is just drooling for that design
<a:ChrisRage:745358256242688102>
FUCK
i mixed it with the jobless one
god damn it
wait it has
is that novel getting a anime
hmmm
i know whats coming when ep 12 and 13 comes
with that anime
i need to catch up
of some girl whos is the leader and screwed his protector/friend
really smashed the rabbit hole
did eren
im just like
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
they did that with mikus hair
i think they just changed the colors
Known to man
They made all gundams
And there also the ones that made gundam
Yeah sunrise is the one that worked on ll
I don't think it's her
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
rest look
only thing bugging me are the eyes
i think this is going to be that one remake where you need to get used to new style
well
I been writing in eng for so long that I feel like i forget how to spell some Serbian words
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
And eng is my 2nd language so I kinda get triggered
That just write words badly
I seen some people that have eng as there first language
you only realize its a spoiler after you watch it
first time watchers arent going to noice
Managed to climb up
trying to get out of bronze 2
played league for like 4 hours
and i feel a bit tired
its 2:41 am
eat the fish
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
i know there going to make that moment for jin epic
<a:KirikaWhatRun:741321705850535996>
after he start it just shitting on sao for a living i just said i think im done with this dude
mothers basement i watched his op videos
that gets tranding
somehow digi always starts something
theres also the man who is in his moms basement
thats beat sao like a dead horse
its not just digi
When they reveal the whole cast
But will wait and see
Would be funny if they get aoi yuuki for some character
Assuming they reprise there roles
That makes it 4
And nana 3
Yui horie voiced 2 characters
For yoh
Tho it is surprising to see they pick yoko
I'm too tired
I was thinking it was someone else
Nvm
In the reboot if they don't get replace
Welp guess we are having 3 symphogear VAs
So there exceptions now
Yos og va
So it's not Satou Yuuko
<:ShemHaWhat:727010581722431499>
asuna is the main focus
and i can tell
i read like 1 chapter of it
And I watched it with my brother
But I can tell the artstyle for the movie was old
i forget the date
the 90s one
i only watched the movie of ghost in the shell
i watched some videos from digi about the netflix ghost in the shell how he sees not much problems with it
No way in blue hell are they wasting that much money on case closed
> It has sinon
<@263392442345193472> best girl squad <:WorryEyes:587033917651943444>
Bloody hell
Too many people
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
Goh kinda was just giving the manga/LN feeling of they cut a lot of shit from the anime
I haven't been interested much
Only anime I kinda sat down and watched was kaguya sama
<a:fightme:553194504832679940>
Come over then
My lazy ass says no
Was goh
Last thing I watched
And I find it wired they choose part 4 for a live action movie
Tho jojo one just adapted start of part 4
FMA jojo gintama
Lets see
Everytime
When it failed
Tho I don't understand why some people think live action anime will work
Never
Answer
When does Hollywood stop
I never watched violet evergarden
*jumps out the window*
Remember this is <#371105434771390465>
Can we stop with that topic
Before the hammers come
OK let's move this to <#337805317276565525>
And play csgo
You want me to dig a bigger hole
To watch anime
I been busy with valorant apex and league
Not going to repeat myself
When a MC gets hit hard
It happens
In most cases
<:KanaSip:661038203188412436>
Brain go spinning
<a:padoru_turbo:651101419742560279>
Before this makes my brain go
I think I should get out
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
*looks at the manga*
<:ShemHaWhat:727010581722431499>
Cgdct?
I can understand
Well coming from someone that was bitching about Goh anime
Everytime Cypher talks about any ln I'm just like *my brains going to become that after reading one ln isn't it*
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
I feel like the anime kinda hinted that
Problem ends up being not giving the build up from the LN/VN
The Emiya Shirou Effect
This is a common problem in most adaptetions
For a month
Im going mia
OK if that day comes
And the author isn't stopping anytime soon
Index is still on going
I know
Would be a pain for someone who watched the anime to start from vol 1 of the LN
Cypher can I ask you something
If I start reading index I'll most likely get brain burned when I get close to ww3 arc
Tho isn't railgun a manga
Here comes the railgun brigade
<a:drink16:620844672545193984>
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
For index
For the LN titles
Look I'm not familiar with all the full terms
I can't help but think js stands for justice system
From seeing all the full terms of all the LNs
Man is my brain going to die
His one of those writers
Oh for fuck bloody sake
Cypher another question does the madman have any plans on ending the series at some point
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
I haven't fully watched index 3
But I know my rights
For being a sinner
And you can shoot me in the head
About spoliers
Cuz I dont care
I do
Yeah but getting someone into it can be a really nut cracker
It had to be
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Someone dig me a grave saying my brain died here
When I read the index novels
Can someone do me a favor
<a:drink16:620844672545193984>
<@676272618839605249> no I take sprite
I just forget
You talked about him Cypher
Js06
I heard that name before
SHIT
Oh wait
Full term
Js06
OK so now that I get those out of the way
Before reading that one
I need to finish the anime
Welp
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
You madman
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
So I'm going to need to do this pirate style
I have no money on me to buy the LN
Well isn't that just bloody nice
How did he lost OT
And I just read them on the way there
For me to start reading LNs when I get a job
You know what be funny
Not 100% sure about that statement
But
I would say I agree on the anituber part
That's what the elite think
Here in some EU regions
Cuz it's 3am currently
God bless you he is asleep
I'm not watching this hell
I'm out
*kicks the door down*
Oh for fuck sakes
Another storm is coming
Looking back at it
To me
Even then ALO was one of the most boring arcs
And for some reason I don't see asunas character as changed
But what do I know about what goes in someones head
Yeah it just felt random
And Sao was written at the time the author wasn't really expirenced
Well thing is accel world was created after sao
They have a damn good artstyle
One thing I like about the lns
Oh we entering that hole now
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Im just like
And when they said you can start with fate zero
Like trying to understand it
Of them talking about fate
I saw a clip
Cuz fgo is sucking you dry
But the story was ehhh there
It looked pretty
I was one of those people that didn't get the hype of demon slayers
And I know you are coming back to that game
I saw You play league before
Go play league
Ruby
And he had good points
I watched just stops video about it
And then hell broke loss when the fan bases attacked
<a:drink16:620844672545193984>
Nux just memes
I'm most case it's true
You can kinda argue that for all adaptations
S1 I all I can remember is bell screaming making friends then watching Freya having a orgasam
Oh boi
First season was nice
I'm calling it
S3 is breaking backs
Dear lord was I like wtf woman
Hestia on another hand
But it was watchable
I kinda felt bored with season 2
But I think LN just suffer a lot more from it
And Mangas and VNs suffer from this too
I know this isn't exclusive to LNs
To the point of someone going rerererere they skipped this rererere and that
Like how much did the anime cut out
That's what my mind goes to
And that being
No
On goh
<a:HR_RooFIRE:645117586475843594>
I'm just like
For LN anime
I think my opinion on some anime are never correct ones
If you place the right people
It can be
Not a VN
Index is LN
So progressive is getting a anime
So I still have a long way to go
Also Ruby I stopped at chapter 114 on HCLW
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
But fgo
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
And I only watched the anime for tog
And goh and tog were the only webtoons I knew
Heroes Cantare really made me interested in that series
And I need to read more of hardcore leveling warrior
Oh that's going to happen 100%
When the series is ending so I can read the last 3 chapters
I'm saving up my free coins
It's really hard to do
||remember mori still has a will to fight despite not having much power||
Too average
Cuz it felt average
<@453836798796234762> I can tell it was crap
<@263392442345193472> ||hell yeah||
By the anime
Bugged
And I was bugged
Yes
To real the source over watching the anime
Oh yeah
All I know about niconico is that it's jp yt
About this
I need to share news
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Before watching it
May need to read the manga
Interesting
Hmmm
But he also has a girl he loves
I know the MC wants a haram
Cuz how the market is currently
Again
Well not like it's going to happen
<:KanaSip:661038203188412436>
From that anime
I think I know that op
When you watch a lot of them you see how it starts and ends
Funny enough it's early 2010s
And MC getting the chills
Remembered that one scene of the girl with the white hair just picturing the MC when she shoot at the target
I watched some eps of that
I hear that's peoples guilty pleasure
Rie playing tsunderes kinda became my default view of her roles
And hearing rie go baka baka
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
Wasn't golden kamuy like 4 or 3 years ago
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
Idk what ep
Secend I stopped somewhere there
I seen like the first season
In some eps
The MC was a perverted mess
But not finishing it
I remember watching sora no otoshimono
For like hours now
My mind has been thinking about shaman king
Cuz that brain is thinking of something else
Depends
<a:drink16:620844672545193984>
*looks at jojo part 5*
A lot of manga suffered from the poor translations
That's what VNs are for
Yeah his just a really chill guy
<@453836798796234762> and Arata from trinity seven kinda out classes him in that area
<:ShemHaWhat:727010581722431499>
<a:drink16:620844672545193984>
<@87512939107450880>
Or something like that
I think
The scarlet bullet
But it will watch you
Now go to shonen hell
<@195044406343106560> welcome to hell
Not into sister who marries her bro
So like at the start
Thank crossing void
I didn't watch it
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
Isn't that the loli haram one
I heard it became more of a battle magical girl series then a haram
With few others
Negima was one haram I enjoyed watching
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Cypher stop lying Sao has the huge budget
Shit
Wasn't asterisk done by the same studio
<a:drink16:620844672545193984>
Asterisk
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Basa would like to have a word on that opinion
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
*XDU players be like*
She voices her as well
Also they didn't include <:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
I know about the sis con
I know the memes and seen some funny moments
Nope
But I know most do the characters
I didn't watch some of the animes from what is shown
<:ShemHaWhat:727010581722431499>
I think I know 17 of those characters she voiced
I need to count
I recognize a lot of them
<a:drink16:620844672545193984>

There's always monologue missing
Maybe I learned something from LN adaptations
<@87512939107450880> I still have no hate for the MC in AW
You know now I wonder with Sao getting the progressive anime and that's going to be the last anime for Sao currently I wonder if accel world will get more animes
<:GWcorbinTopKek:384871333705678868>
Laura the best girl
And I'm over here laughing
Aya is currently entering over drive
The amount of crack I feel here is truly powerful
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
The shogi loli haram
Yes
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Hahaha

https://youtu.be/eUHMO2VMolU
<:LimePopcorn:648706601754034188>
Someone pass me the salt
I'm taking a back sit on this one
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
Aya you are out numbered here
Lol
3
S2
I say season 1 was a 6 or 7
<:KanaSip:661038203188412436>
Aya don't disrespect best girl like that
Oi
Pre pubg
Most i can remember watching was yu gi oh shaman king sonic x beyblade bakugan bleach fma naruto digimon and dbz and Pokémon
<:JinWorry:587544194277441536>
I don't really have a fav comedy anime
So what I missed
Plus I'm always on a empty wallet
Cuz I'm lazy to read one
Well you aren't getting me to play a VN
It was recommended for me by a friend
Cuz I enjoyed it
I need to finish it
Cuz one of the channels airing it dubbed it
I watched like 2
Have any of you watched a Korean anime or did it air for you guys
I have no shame
Just in case my whole team faints
I know I saved a lot in pokemon
Idk if I ever pulled off a savescum
Say hi to someone who just rests the game
<:WorryEyes:587033917651943444>
<@263392442345193472> slowly catching up to goh anime
i feel like i should give subaru a bit more credit then i give him before
and dear blood lord
ok i catched up with rezero
Why does that sound familiar
Here is Cypher on seto no hanayome train
I was always thinking it was the same va
In nep maybe in the games there more
I only noticed 2 gear VAs
Rie Tanaka is purple heart
Wouldn't railgun need idex s4
And accelerators next ticket to jail if the police saw him
That's who I was thinking about
Yeah
That's what I'm asking
Oh
Are we talking about the one that had a fight with accelerator in ww3 arc
Till they cried
Wait misaka bullied a kid
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Have a chest
How long of a time skip
In there comics
Japan and Korea had fun using him
Lol
And Google doesn't care
Cuz the wikis ain't giving a fuck
Oh great
That kinda gives me more question marks
But that
Or the user
I heard of powers turning on the creator
<:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
It does what now
Cuz ww3 anime isn't going to tell me
<@87512939107450880> enlighten me in this hypocrite and bad person spoiler
So he is now the head of the show and Toma is most likely broken
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
Read the novel as they say
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
His in what position
Wait what
Just to show off how powerful espers there are
How many people want his bloody head
I mean cuz of his reputation
I didn't mean as in no one is in jail with him
But he still isn't going to be left alone
Ok fair enough
Cuz the smartass can't keep his own head in check
No one will leave him be
Oh pls
There going to say something about not liking it
Normally when I see that reaction I'm like
<@87512939107450880> <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
And man was it a good watch
I watched it on stream
Cuz cyphers full on index talk is making want to go to something else
Ok can I switch this topic from index to something else
<:ArmeEhh:429638900009533442>
So like she can just make her to her house and then do god knows what
Not the blonde chick
I'm a idiot I was thinking of someone else
Oh wait
Unless it's something that can DMG the misaka network
I don't doubt it
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
||She would destroy everything||
Oh no
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
The author really is a madman
I can hardly watch a series thats 100 eps long
Lol
So you are 7 years older then me
And I remember shaman king and sonic x on it
I had it
Cypher did you ever had jetix on TV
Cuz my childhood is reawakened
At this point I just care about shaman king
<:JinWorry:587544194277441536>
Ask deen
<@199928870810419200> damn it
Before I get databased
Guess I better start doing that
And I still need to finish season 1
Did that happen in AW vs SAO
Cuz reki
The powercreep
Only series I really read now and then is like goh
But ehh
I could find reading manga enjoyable
I think you just have too much LNs on your mind
Lel
The first arc was a Quote able ride
Tho I like what SAO abridged it's currently doing
> Nobody's told him that "lol" doesn't mean "lots of love" yet.
<@504069701911969803>  LMAO
Hey at least you have fun reading them
I think been surround by those people that are like lol x series
<@87512939107450880> lol the HO meme
Cuz it's most likely a filler arc
But I don't think I need to watch the movie
I have yet to watch the last season and the movie
When I was in like middle school or high school
I watched ft
To do so
Even tho I have free time
Lol
<@274279989506211841> I know that spolier
And blown them up
Just fuck everyone
<:JinWorry:587544194277441536>
On that one
I can back Cypher up
For one series or another
Everyone has one
I forget where I stopped reading Edens zero
Not like this is exclusive to FT author
But instead I get 2 soldiers being dumbasses
A tank battle
That's kinda what I expect the series to be from the title
And problem with with summoners is that there just b
Meat bags when placed alone
In fairness Lucy mostly relys on her summons
Lel
A whip can only do some much
At least 4 or 5 times already
I think I heard that take
Cuz si fi
I don't remember that part
<:nanipaimon:737285187154739210>
I may agree or disagree
OK what is that sucks about it
We have someone who didn't have a good time with rezero
Oh boi
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
I get a dump
<@263392442345193472> also I saw that unit you get in HC from the free ticket
In a stat of jesus christ
How should I say
And it left me
I was watching that
And the reason I only watched 1 ep was cuz of rezero
I only read few chapters of Edens zero
Then went <:JinWorry:587544194277441536>
Watched 1 ep
Goh
But spin offs are coming
Well it is over
Some fillers were meh
The one where magic isn't a thing
<:JinWorry:587544194277441536>
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Here we go again
Shit
Yeah toma has no mercy
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
His most active in anime related stuff
And it's always jellal
That guy has 2 profiles
what to watch next
so then i can be like
im just waiting for that last ep
this just leaving hell im seeing
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
did she voice both characters
lel
i dont remember that
So who watched the last ep of rezero
i know that anime
someone needs blood
i was like well damn girl
asuna part tho
We are getting more
Wait a few months
so a upcoming gacha game soon
Thing is erza is loaded with a lot of weapons
In fairness how many authors reused something from there older work
Tho the power lvls wasn't that big a deal for me
If you ask me
Tho the last arc was kinda drugged
Had a OK ending
Liked it
Fairy tail
<@87512939107450880> I watched the last season of ft
<:KanaSip:661038203188412436>
Cuz of the blue bird
All I'm going to say
Twitter
A1 did a good job with s1 for ft
I don't have much Faith in jc staff
Wait till someone starts throwing the FT bs arguments on EZ
Tho better then Lucy if you ask me
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I need to pick back EZ
That would make some knights blush in shame
im sorry what im i seeing here
100%
mai for me
*i hide*
yes
that pic i saw
not the touma comment
so people can gun me for my votes
then voting
i think i would spent my time reading something
cuz it never aired for me
like i dont know much about inuyasha
its just the children of the characters people know from inuyasha
so some of my votes would be biased
you know whats the problem with this i didnt watch some of the shows or movies on this list
To me inuyasha is like something something really big in America regions
so you will have something to keep you busy
and **DATABASE** is close
close
next year is like
for all the flaws it has
and besides i did enjoy ft
as a bug
then i would be dead
worst i could have done is marathoned gintama
took some breaks
in like 2 days
and i marathoned the last season of FT
cuz its a long series
good luck
and EZ
im thinking about reading FT 100 year quest
let me put a hole somewhere
now
gun!
!Gun
<a:HR_PepeGunR:645117585641177098>
f off
you son of a gun
Wrong chat
Ummm
Oh ok
Sw3?
And I feel like I'm going to be one in the crossfire
The death stares are coming
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
I can bearly watch some movies for 2 hours
Who would have spent time watching Eva for 6 hours
I was like the op had to hint something
And here come the movie people
For a moment u was like us that konosuba
It should be its own thing
Like no matter what Ver you watch
Lupin has many vers
With the writing
2nd i felt like it kinda went a big down
First season was good
I watched it
Then noir
Isn't psycho pass more futurist
Baccano
Hmmm
Noir like
Sunshine does reference the first LL
I want to give idol m@ster a shot
Yeah but some sites just take crunchyrolls subs
Since I mostly used pirate sites
I never used any sub group
For some movies
Kissanime took subs form like number of groups
I would assume subs
You can start from there
Yeah
did they get dmca
wait horrible subs is gone
op isnt ending for like 5 years
~~but that already has people over working staff~~
~~i know theres case closed~~
just to make people suffer
can i switch the topic to toei real quick after one piece ends i wonder what other long running series toei is going to pick up
only worth the songs
the movies are just filler
anyways
jc asked for it
dont pay well or treat some of there staff
that some studios
this has been getting known for years
Or they just don't treat there staff that well
Is this related to the animators not getting payed
Netflix helped
For anime
Mappa just get in the questionable area for me
After goh
To keep you in the loop
Well there's gacha
It was confirmed
F off
ZL
To me
Some of the girls were just ewww
somehow i was thinking the room was the ring
i mixed the 2 movies
oh wait
or some other anime that did that thing
was that a reference to the room
omg
thats ummm.....
well then
also how cheap of apartment can you even get
idk
~~mista~~
you know that number is seen as cursed number by some people
cuz db fans in the west are going to take everything
yuri yuri yuri yuri
and you have a whole new series
with rider and sentai you can always just make new cool looking character
depending if the studio want it to
some series can go on forever
cuz im not a hardcore fan
and im not going to bother with super or any of the manga
i watched it
like db i could watch the og series and be like
<:worrydumb:614508434355781683>
cuz im just like
i dont think ill ever watch it
with sailor moon
just overloaded
db at least point is like
ok lets move the staff to case closed
someone at toei is going to be like
and by the time op is over
And then forget to realize there still humans left in the world
To just die
That's what people expect the whole cast
Tho isn't Aot still on going
<a:peepoRedAlarm:762699267097624586>
And I was thinking cardfighter vanguard was something I can easily get addicted to
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
When someone's too much into ll
that anime just show how some of the characters are just sick as all hell
i didnt fully watch it
Welp better contact that hospital
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
What wimps
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>

<@262326868366065664> and how deep is it
But on some high end stuff
Chris
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Isn't 2020 a year of a lot old games graveyards
That died young
And so we're many other mobile games
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Well we all know global died cuz it wasn't even markated
Here
It's kinda sad no theater I know of shows anime movies
That's a fair point
Kaiji God knows if I would be able to watch it
With how many risks are in it
In fairness that anime is quiet a interesting one
I forget
I think 2 or 3 hours
I think it is
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
But that's why I said it would be funny if it was someone's soul
I know
You know what would be a funny thing someone's soul
And besides the author is going to put him in more shit anyways
At this point do I really care about being stuck in high school
So he may as well be like
Well shit always hits the bed for him
Since I didn't know the title
When I first saw the trailer for it
Or that sad boy
Was it the girl
I couldn't understand who was the anime character
And his full of lies and a hypocrite
Since he always has bad luck in every corner
We all know he doesn't care at the end of the day
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
And that's all I'm going to say
All i can say about the character is that his ability is related to spend money
I'm scared of spoiling stuff
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Just enjoy the show
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
I'll just go to the corner
I think I said enough
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
I remember season 2 had a character that would make gacha whales blush
If I remember right abilities kinda get wired
Since dbza I'm not really interested in
Tho I wish I could get into the ygoa series
That's why I can't get into some abridged series
Maybe I just have a different sense of humor
I was laughing my ass off
A friend of mine showed one ep of it
Cuz early seasons jokes feel dated
I think that's also the reason I can't get into yu gi oh abridged
I think they did some work for funmation
No not yet
If I find it funny
I do love abridged stuff
Cuz how the early parts of it just feel a bit dated for me
Is it bad that I can't get into DBZA
I enjoyed the hell out of hellsing abridged
But idk ifs really working out for them
Tfs kinda tries to do there own thing
Since I need to finish the movie then watch season 3
I haven't heard it yet
I think the author really likes her rock solid
Tho it's going to be wired for me to hear jp voices for SK characters
Yeah I heard about the manga ending out of nowhere
I think there going to follow the manga
I never watched brs and idk what's the deal with it
But I took a sec to realize it was kiba
I was think the same
I haven't finished the whole anime
Bleach
Since it was my childhood
Anyways
I'm going to watch shaman king
I feel like I'm one of those people that could enjoy select few shonen anime
But I just stopped after school festival
I tried to watch all of the animes that are available
Cuz it felt like it dragged
Part 3 is where I sorta stopped
If we talking pure bloods
Yeah but not many are left at this point
Well saiyans aren't really human to start with
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
https://youtu.be/3QJpqHx3soo
I think space noir is a fitting word for bebop
Baccano
Cuz of the artstyle
With panty and stocking you can argue the dub is good cuz that whole show feels like a American cartoon
Who says dubs sucks now
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
And I was just laughing
Cuz of a annoying mc
I find it funny how black clover made some people watch a dub
Cuz Asta was bearable there
<@87512939107450880> want to know something funny some people said the dub for black clover was better
And he wasn't the reason I dropped it
A lot of people drop it cuz or asta
Knew it
Asta
Cuz the eng dub is stuck in my head
Since she always wants her kids to have normal lives but they cant
Well you can point fingers at chichi for that one
He was still a dick
In fairness to piccolo
I'm never going to try and make sense of that shit
Power lvls no
Cuz idk if he would be that strong
We talking non cannon broly
In dbz
Was table ever considered cannon
With this
I don't want to keep going
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Oh boi
Buu saga to me was just a flip flop of a mess
Some people argued dbz should have ended at cell saga
Yeah
But he is just hungry for a fight in the cell saga
Vegeta tries
I can't get into super
Only thing I can remember from dragon ball was the op
Who is going to be working on it
My questions on is
It get one
Of that game
Cuz he is most likely dead tired
You sure about that
When nasu gets his ass out of fgo
OK I'm out
Cuz tsukihime is like the underdog
Yeah try next time cypher
<:TriplePeek:689568598938615939>
Idk
Vampires
I want a topic switch
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
And is loaded with everything
A man who clames the world as his own
GIL
On gil
Like how can you just slap rng numbers
As hell
Im just confused
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
But I don't think there that rich
I know her family is rich
*facepalm*
Cuz of there human mothers
You know I think I'll forever feel bad for the half saiyans
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
You are just asking for it to be ruined
And me be like
I can't wait for someone to ask for a stranger fake anime
Cuz fgo already sucks people's wallets
At this point I don't want anymore fate anime
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Shit
I expected a rezero pun
And I know people are going to put me on a pyke
Since I didn't play the VN
I have no reason to ask for the fate route
People want them to bust there asses on the fate route
I know model kits are popular but I don't think there that popular then some of there own animes
I kinda doubt that statment
Idk if it's official
Cuz I read a comic like that
You know what it would be a interesting idea if we had f/sn but the roles are reversed servents are master and the masters are servents
That's exclusive to mash at this point
The king of the lions
Alter
Cuz some servents want him dead one way or another
What's her story going to be kill merlin
Like at this point idk if she can even be a avenger at this point
Of Servent
You mean every class
And wasn't the girl from prototype in the stranger fake novel
But change of plans
Prototype was something that could have happend
If I remember right it has arthur
Tho stranger fake does interest me a bit
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Sounds like Japan if you ask me
Then I wouldn't be surprised
If Gundam can get wired
And the other from a older macross where the MC eats a leaf
The one from delta
From like 2 of the series
I never watched the series I only know the memes
But I would need to go on yt for that stuff
Unless I can find a macross fan that can explain it to me
Guess I'll never know
Robotech
Not helping the case of the dub series
When it comes to what's connected and what is not
Macross is something I'll forever be confused about
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
<@87512939107450880> christ all mighty where you keep finding this crap
And eng if it ever had one
So jp cast is unknown to me
For me I watched yatterman 1977 in the SRB dub
I also watched Yattodetaman
And enjoyed it
I remember seeing the og yatterman on one channel
But not on CN
I think I watched that
Even when frieza was cut in half
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I'm more so surprised that slipped in
Somehow I'm not surprised those exist
>Sex Museum
FFX*
I haven't fully seen it
That is pop team epic in a nutshell
Yeah
Free is wired sometimes
Idk
Idk if they beat the girl from the zombie anime
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Oh
Ummm what
Unless YouTube is just broke
There's a option for that crap to not show up
<:GWcorbinTopKek:384871333705678868>
Me kinda confused on the ova bit
He still tried to give him a chance to live
Gundam is just one of the bigger mecha series
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Females can be hard since they have a lot of different ranges
I can recognise some male VAs
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Man am I in for a ride when I get to s3
Wasn't he wanted by the system
It can happen
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Just weak
I'm not saying it's the worst
Despite being a weak point to me
I felt like season 2 was fine enough
There was a movie
To see if it's weaker
But I need to watch 3
Season 2 to me felt weak
I hear its kind of a soft reboot
I havent watched it yet
Doesn't sentai own the rights to it
welp good thing im not planning on watching it
if they ever make hardcore leveling warrior anime i think im going to be dissapointed
i havent read noblessing yet
for tog it can be argued it was decent
cuz a lot of things were skipped
goh anime is only worth the fights
~~i read the webtoon~~
cuz how much it was skipped
but i was done after the first half
i tried to watch Goh
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
i find if funny how some anitubers think rent a girlfriend was one of the better one this season
yeah i heard about that
cuz all i see is a shit show
Wouldn't be surprised
In gt?
Cuz super exists
Well I don't really care for gt
<:GWossuKannaSip:395627468276367370>
And she will do whatever she can
Cuz she's is chichi
You maybe wondering why I said that
<:GWossuKannaSip:395627468276367370>
Chichi isn't going to let her be a fighter
Oh pls
Cuz it was made by someone who worked for toriyama
For not being canon
And gt is looked down on in the dbz community
Besides ssj 4 and omega shenron
I don't remember much from gt
or just change his whole character
I know who those 2 are
But I think my fav would have to be devil is a part timer cuz I did enjoy how Mao grow as a character
Mondaiji tachi I need to finish and konosuba
Overlord I stopped somewhere in season 2
Tho I need to finish up some isekais
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
You WHAT
Maybe devil is a part timer
But there not many I would consider a fav
I had isekais i watched and enjoyed
I don't have a fav isekai
It goes down hill from there
2nd season
I enjoyed the first season of is
But that's just my opinion anyways
But it was still watchable
Fair enough it does feel slow
But you get used to it
Yeah they look wired
The artstyle just follows the novels
The quality kinda dropped in born
Born was the reason the author had a falling out with the studio
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
And it's consider like ep 0
They wasted only 1 ep
S3 felt really out of place
Yeah
Like they did dxd and interspecies reviewer
Underrated
Yeah KLK doesn't feel like a magical girl show
His a prevert with a good heart
That's how he is
I think it is
Kiss him not me
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
At least
In the manga
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
<:KirikaGlee:698939825927094384>
Lol
||but whos paying childsupport||
so i can wait
im waiting for ggo
and i assume there most likely going to abridge all the current anime arcs
since there still in alfim
but not now
i think there going to do it
asuna is the main focus
its sort of a reboot/remake
but anything ggo related is good stuff
i like the spin off more
but thats only a dream
i want more ggo stuff
it wasnt stated what it was going to be till now
i may watch a old anime from my childhood
and be done with it
i just watch sub
cuz when it comes to new anime of the season
dub i didnt bother with it
keijo i only seen in sub
someone can most likely prove me wrong
well thats just my opinion anyways
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
well i say there isnt really much yuri bait
but people still want the fate route to be adaptated by ufotable
ok back to anime
*walks away*
tho didnt she end it up with kevin
they are
yes
that last one
wait a min
I feel like his somewhere in the middle
I did enjoy season 2 but I kinda had a problem with being stuck in one area for like a whole 1 cour
> What she proposed || can be on the same level of an eternal marriage ||
True
But everything just keeps going back to the same place
They had something going for subaru
i didnt
But not like I can escape it when it's in everything
Math didn't interest me a lot
Most people did
i have the full song on my phone
a lot of favors
and the system did her favors
that part wasnt explained that well
if they just keep baiting people
thats going to kill the series
it felt lacking
then i was like yeah this isnt really better then the first
i enjoyed the first season and i saw season 2
i was done with pp after the movie
in the whole 2nd season she is really unlikeable
cuz she is
Lol
Block blockade battlefront op and Ed's will forever a banger
Too many tags
Sounds like a rush
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
Where is gundam
Like is sunrise really pushing more code geass
didnt they have plans for 00
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
It's kinda sad I only really enjoyed 2 songs from seed
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
*runs for the window*
I think I watched digimon and Pokémon alone
Tho naruto I never bothered to watch fully
Me and my older brother just watch what was on TV at the time like FMA Bleach and naruto
I remember only anime I get to watch with my brothers was dbz and yu gi oh
Tho my brothers still watch some anime
Sometimes I forget
Or just my brothers
That used to be my family with ghibli movies
I would have a confused face
If that was one of my brothers
Lol
You don't purge the archer purges you with one arrow
But man I forget the series goes into political stuff
I haven't finished familer of zero i stopped somewhere around season 3 or 4 can't remember which one
Geez
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~someone from reddit~~
no it doesnt
here they come
well its digimon but using cards to evolve them and use there powers
i remember dinosaur king
i remember there was a anime about that
like capsule monsters
<@!274279989506211841>
Setsuna
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Dropped it after the first ep
The 4th
3rd one was ok
I didnt enjoy it
Well season 2 is bad tbh
i dont remember the last ep i was at
i dont think the long running shonens are going to end
tbh with how some people are willing to watch the one piece anime
cuz at the time i was stil in the phase of watching anime in dub
both in dub
when i found out what anime really is the first ones i watched were angel beats and AoT
this also applies to bleach
cuz they aired it like that here for some reason
i watched the jp dub of it
tho i remember as a kid it was wired for me to hear ed and al sound like girls
tho i seen a video from glass reflection talking about why starting with brotherhood can be a problem
yeah i heard about that
cuz it didnt cover the beginning well
cuz i havent fully seen it
first need to rewatch 2003 one
but i plan to
i havent seen FMB
but later on it went anime only
yeah 2003 had a good start
here comes the mind fucks
nero is more moods
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
all im going to see is a shit show
god bless her
welp
is she going to play the kid
classic 4kids
pfft
XD
unless its a old series i watched i can watch the dub
now days i only watch the new series in sub
<@!87512939107450880>
i know few people here
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
...
But then i start it getting the reason why and i had to agree with them
When i heard about the stuff people were saying about kira i went into seeds with giving kira some benefit of a doubt
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
But the characters
Ill never deny seed has cool looking mechas
how his character goes from there
idk about the LNs
Kinda sad how its story went
Seeds
Whenever i get to the point of watching the first gundam then see if i can watch all ths other gundams that are part of UC
So it wasn't that big a deal
But then again i had jetix
Sometimes i wished i watched toonami
The shonen gundam
But is the main girl just pushing my buttons
Wing on another hand i like some characters
Turn a to me just feels like a experiment/different take on gundam
I want to keep watching wing and turn a
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Cuz its always a different gundam to talk about
Well not here
Theres 90% chance 00 is going to be talked about
When i hear something gundam related
I kinda consider 00 overrated to some extent
~~watched unicorn cuz someone bugged me to didnt finish it cuz i had something else to watch~~
And im still lazy to get into UC
So some of my bias is speaking
Maybe cuz it was my first gundam
But i still enjoyed it
I kinda have to agree with that
*looks at IBO*
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
And the jesus part is something i can agree with
I watched all of seed
the manga has its own horrors
but at the sametime
the artstyle is diff better
at where season 3 was at
i think i read the manga
i dont think i finished season 3 yet
no i havent seen it
you catched me at a wrong time
or just how they start eps were handled
cuz of asta
many people dropped black clover
lol
Most of the male VAs i end up remembering only end up having one type of voice
Isn't hidive for older titles
Cuz i remember sentai dubbing the series
Wait isnt umaru licensed by sentai film works
Theres also made in abyss
To say the least
Well that's odd
Really?
But i remember they took the DanMachi spin off scums wish and (season 2 of blue exorcist?)
To know what they even took
I had to relay on yt
And i heard the player was bad
That would interest me
They only had a few shows
Isn't amazon's service died
There aren't many options for legit sites cuz its netflix or sony at  this point
Most people ain't moving from the pirate sites
Yup
But its more sony then funi
The news
Well it was already posted
what souls
yup
i should have expected it when they cant bother to let eu people see anything
and i still cant real the news gg funmation
since sony owns both companies now
welp people are going to bitch harder now
cuz people love it in live action
oh we playing that game now
*takes my glasses off*
*looks at dbz*
And there physical release are kinda crap
I watch a video from just stop talking about funis problems
Tho I'll never understand some American complaints with region locking
To this day for being region locked to America and few other select regions
People still give funi shit
Then what cr had
And amzon had more money to make a decent enough site for anime
It died cuz amazon didnt care enough
I remember someone making a video celebrating anime strikes death
👀
If they own the rights to the first season
in part 2
i like part 4s op
funny enough the endings for all jojo songs are from western artist
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Lol
Ok fair enough
and i remember it was brutal
i watched elfen lied
to me that wasnt that brutal
cuz i seen some scenes that could be a brutal for me
idk if ill ever be able to watch higurashi
pretty much
if i remember he may have said it few times during part 1 and 3
true
tho i think dio is the only anime vampire i heard scream wryyy a lot
in japan
i know wry is kinda related to vampires
or more ovas
chances are part 6 may be annoced there
cuz theres a jojo event in april next year
when they annouce it
it was a good ride
while i dont consider part 3 anime the best
it clicked for me at part 1 and 2
after you finish all 4 parts
she only shows up in 2 parts
seeds in terms of gundam i watched is mid at best
for some characters it had
i like seeds
Even in seeds i still see the point of the jesus meme
it always sucks and stings
~~yes it can~~
looks ugly as hell
2nd one
god that looks ugly
When kirito comes back it can be a turn off
Im most likely going to finish the 3rd part of alicization
Here he comes
Oh boi
You are just asking for people to rage
I say it was a interesting thing to do but to do that after 3 years
But man i would most likely be pissed or done with the series after that arc
And btw i didnt watch haruhi but i do know about the series
After watching this im surprised how much kyoani managed to troll people this hard
So
https://youtu.be/lJxXhTBbJ5Y
but i think it still holds up well
its been a while since i seen IBO
the madman has time for everything
im not surprised the shenanigans get to index
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it didnt hook me like index
tbh
i kinda drop railgun
idk about index
👀
That noblessing went downhill for him
Thats what i heard from a friend
Tho i may need to read tog at some point and noblesssing cuz GoH and HCLW wait for a new chapter is making me forget they exist sometimes
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Well I hope he recovers
Did a new chapter even come out
To make the arc a bit bearable
One of the eng VAs had the right idea
Tbh in not surprised the VAs couldn't put up with that arc
its called dying like a solder
<:TomosatoSalute:688199574749446203>
*puts on a helmet*
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
ummmm
yup
theres one word that comes out of cyphers month
when touma is bringed up
oh god
so is it over
i guess we are done with that little role play
XD
this
and i meant not you talking about index
i think solo will have that honor
welp thats being taken out of context
uuuuhhhhh
since funi tends to change the scripts
depending on the writer
dragon maid was a different case
prison school
thats 4kids
honestly 2003 is kinda stuck in my head with the sub
with changes to the script it ends up being a mess when reading subs
So while you guys are on the topic of SRW
*Laughs in eu*
that will give people nightmares
a historic pic
now thats
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
Is this sport yuri
Hmmm interesting
Is the manga still on hold
unless you mean that guy who made everything worst in season 2
brown one?
the one with blue hair?
idk about that
but man did i get pissed
until her last breath
i was thinking she was annoying
they really just dumped her character
true
i honestly thinked the ending did its job
the ending is what people had a problem with
https://tenor.com/view/anime-thumbs-up-approve-alright-okay-gif-9340442
depending on what the studio wants
it can go many ways
im surprised spirited away sold that big in japan
since the movie did make a crap tone of money
but there most likely going to work on it
i havent heard anything about getting a season 2
cuz he want it to flex his power
<@!87512939107450880>
https://tenor.com/view/puffybear-puffy-cute-lol-happy-gif-12628636
The more i see this the more i feel sad for <#377148557796442134>
*grabs a helmet and popcorn*
so from me calling someone a little shit we enter a full out gun fight
https://tenor.com/view/rwby-listen-you-little-shit-gif-7332562
im just confused
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
it really does look like a classified document
vol 1 and 2 fights are the best
||i think we need some drinks here||
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
Make me
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
*didn't watch it*
Man the more i see stuff about the shaman king remake the more it feels wired
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
.... What
I heard people shit on frontier and i consider it to be good with what it did
I feel like im the only person that doesn't understand what makes tamers great
the old digimon movies
i dont think ill ever bother with the movies
i could watch more tri
my history with digimon was on tv saw the first 2 seasons then years later i decided to watch tamers and froniter on yt saw few eps of data squad and on tv i saw few ep of fusion few eps of the tri and thats about it
i was not a fan of tamers
the word is out
too late
*grabs popcorn*
sometimes i question how directors just drop inner monologues sometimes
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
I only know few animes from that collection
<:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714>
On VHS
As a kid
I remember watching mononoke
Honestly ghibli is kinda overrated
But unless there were series i watched that had a movie as a tie in or a spin off i didnt watch it
Cuz i grow up with some them
Most anime movies i can remember are ghibli
I heard about garden of words
Cuz that anime was my childhood
Shaman king im most likely going to watch
I didnt watch a lot of anime
I remember people making covers for one of the songs
Yup
Oh didnt see it
To see if i watched it
I need to look it up
We are entering war
Oh god
People are kind split on it
With how the manga ended
In a lot of areas
In fairness demon slayer to me felt flat
<:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
It took me like a month to bother with demon slayers
I was about to say
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
But never get around to watch it
Your name is one movie i hear a lot about when the hype was big
~~cuz we know there fates~~
~~not the magical girl~~
I felt bad for one of the characters tho
At that ep
I remember laughing
Lol
And god he can make banger tracks
Like i heard his ost for gundam unicorn
Do you know the guy who did the ost for re creators
The ending i was thinking it was ok
Also re creators was good
Ok i think will have a stop here
Game of thrones was a mess cuz the last season was just writers not knowing wtf they were doing
And man was it a shit show
I did
For me
I wouldn't say the ending was bad it was mediocre at best
But gridman on another hand was a different case and darling in the franxx
Yeah kill la kill
With some of its endings
Trigger always has this problem
In some parts
I forget how brutal mononoke get
Next year most likely
We legit had someone talking about LL
I watched re zero
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592> <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592> <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Shes best girl
Meteora is the short girl wizard
Hiroyuki sawano can just make music and people can nut to it
I STARTED WATCHING ANIME MID 2010S OK
Im lazy
While i could
I never watched madoka
Cuz of the movie
Also code geass had recap films that had some different scenes from the anime
Cuz i need to know what waifus people are going to take
<@297554276539170826> also i need to ask you this c2 or kallen who do you like
Good excuse to watch it in sub
There recap films
The acting was good
Watched it in dub
Same
And it was a good ride
And i decided to watch it
I always heard about CG
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
<@199928870810419200>
I just hear news here
Yes
Didn't he get out of jail
It was confirmed months ago
Yes
No database tho
Tho jan is full of season 2 and some new stuff
So im not saying this year till jan 1
*about to become 20 soon*
One piece just read the manga
Cuz i didnt watch all of it
Bleach idk if i could re-watch it
But i respect it if you grow up with it
Cuz im just ehh not interested
I dont think ill watch sailor moon
Yeah
No matter what series you watched
Power rangers was everywhere
B damon yu gi oh bakuga beyblade
I watched a lot of anime that were made to sell toys
Early 2010s were me playing league of legends
When jetix was a thing
I watched some
That was a warzone
The manga ending uhhh boi
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
*takes someones cookies*
<:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Since i feel younger in most cases
Or older
Im kinda used to talking to people that are in there 20s
And in 6 or 5 days im going be 20
Im 19 currently
and how long the contract lasts
depends on the company
but a good number of them are
some of them arent bangers to me
<@!238855496797257729> <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
for there whole run
dude have you seen yu yu hakusho and hxh reusing its ops
well deen most likely couldnt get the rights to database
why quit anime over database
unless bell was bringed from another world
and its still a isekai to people
sao you can go to many games
like i see a isekai as someone who is trapped in one world
thats what i just said
when in reality it isnt
people consider .hack a isekai
ill never consider entering a game a isekai
until the staff moved to jc staff
and had a good anime
and yet they did konosuba
deen worked on both seasons
Cypher nutting
<:ShiraBean:736607747834904667>
danmachi is a game to gods
I only forget names or few girls
as much they can
they love shaving in gundam
Its high chances it's the gacha
i was laughing
and ngl
i remember gigguk needing to explain domestic girlfriend while eating a ghost pepper
we bringing in that
oh boi
and im just like holy shit what am i reading
oh god i read the manga
scums wish
that anime was a shit show for me
honestly
thats not domestic girlfriend
i watched that anime cuz it was one of the  anime i decided to watch cuz it seemed interesting
I felt satisfied as hell when ||he died||
On this one
Ill def cypher
No
As someone said no one can be at chars lvl
I enjoyed season 2
Its being done by the same studio that did school days and dxd
Cuz the studio needs money
And i read it cuz a friend on mine considers it a guilty pleasure
Dropped it after couple of chapters
I read the manga
Is more like twitter having a meltdown
People on twitter dont want the show to air
Its already giving twitter a hissy fit
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I just love his gundam
Also duo (i think his name was something like) is my fav character in wing
But idk when
I need to watch more of wing
From the start
Destiny just keeps screaming ugh
I would take season 2 of ibo over seeds destiny
Gjhallahorn was so meh
I felt nothing
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
Kaguya is jelly
I knew from day one it get annocued redo of the healer was going to make people melt
At least naofumi had some respect
Nah i wouldnt put that guy on the same lvl as naofumi
He became a dick with how he was treated
Honestly the manga chapters I read were more then enough
do it
sora no otoshimoto was alright
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
cypher
but its a weak one
its not the worst haram i watched
till i rewatched it
cuz i didnt see all its flaws
i finished it
cuz i was naive
i did the same thing
in fairness
other girls kinda on a back burner
she becomes kind of a main focus in 2
s1 was watchable
then anything else
season 2 was a joke to me
yeah i think we need to have a talk
*looks at fsns way of mana transfer*
im not sure
ummm
cuz i only see trash
yeah she doesnt count
you mean the bitch that played him
kira already has a girl
that poor basterd
oh kira
ok get it
sun chan
hanayome
yeah
i enjoyed vanadis
and he took a whole army down
just one shot
XD
omg
vanadis
while i think in the novels it was explained the reason he is like that
he is dense as a rock
cuz it was legit boring
that was the case
i can kinda tell
novels thats a different ball game
the anime at least
seirei tsukai no blade dance felt kinda empty if you ask me
asterisk would be 2nd place for me
well
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
dess
the girl that gets memeded to death
till the annocument came the author was going to do all the routes
well when it was just one ending
and im just like well the author was going to give someone the finger
bokuben was a dumpster fire to some people
to love ru
tho i hear people werent happy with how the manga end it
most of them are highschoolers
and then was like ok im going to speedrun this
i dropped it at one point
season 1 felt so god damn dragged out
yeah
but to love ru kinda has girls that can be winners
but chances are she could be
zappers are watching
watch how you say flat
Shes a good bug zapper
When the tsundere mikoto becomes a Chad
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
^
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Not sure about that
<@87512939107450880> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Before the abridged
I watched hellsing
Thats me with hellsing
oi
Was the kids arc in the novels
Of the series
Isn't that season 2
When you are a young writer things ain't going to work well
Arc after aincrad is just boring
But I'm a big fan of ggo
Alicization kinda changed my mind on sao and i liked
But i think i was more of a fan of m4 and aug
I remember using p90 on CS
It was great cuz it was writen by someone who loves guns
Thats a spin off
You can watch up to season 2 to get to alicization
since that aired
its been years
lol
interesting choices
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
4kids is dead
Cuz we know how yt is
Tfs i think they would need to deal with copyright
Just hope he doesn't do other series
I think there high chances his going to finish it
But dbza that seems to have ended at the cell saga
Tfs finished hellsing abridged
Its going to take them years to abridged the whole series unless they do the movies as well
I think
Its a LN
Till the end
I think i turned my brain off
I forget about that
When you watch enough anime to the point you can tell something feels off
I can tell this stuff wasnt adapted well
It had a meh ending
Wait i watched that one
I heard of it
we going back to gundam
so
destiny likes to have a word with you
but his soul is too pure for that
<:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
ill go take a piss
do it
since i can only remember few people
aya i dont remember adding you on my friends list
<:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
and besides builders never interested me
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
but were we friends
*doesnt care about builders*
i consider some of the old shows i watched dated while they still have there qualities unless its comedy then i think it could still be good
idk if carvibal phantasm aged that well
age can do many things
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
and yes destiny is a problematic entry
jesus bloody christ
wait directors wife loved kira
so people arent going to give it a lot of crap
it was liked
while wing had its bs moments
i have a bias for IBO
when it comes to gundam
seed is avrage at best
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
me everytime someone goes into full on spoiler spree
Well i still think the old style is nice for female characters but i cant blame the studio for going with the LNs style
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
s3 was the reason the author of the series didnt want to bother with the studio anymore
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080> 🔪
so full on idol mode
when i saw asuna and miyuki cross move was like oh
crossing void has some odd cross moves
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
||will he kill of everyone||
Welp its the moment of truth

<@274279989506211841> well i just heard the aot manga is ending in april
so i walked in the holy index discussion
<:TriplePeek:689568598938615939>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
here comes the gun shoots
👀
*grabs a bat*
More like a tired boar
medabots?
you already entered the crossfire
and its kinda too late
isnt beyblade more of a toy
i dont any other figure line
well besides gundam
it is true
well
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
before regret kicks in
just do it now
that series start it from games
i hear most of the roles she played
when i hear aoi yuuki i dont hear hibiki
and it was interesting one to watch
cuz we lost a tournament
so i watched Juni Taisen: Zodiac War
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Now just bad cgi
First webtoons get kinda butchered in terms of adaptation
Like who even approved this
But man this is just sad
If its a part of crunchyroll original then yes
Crunchyroll threw the money
Well not much can be done now
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I think crunchyroll funded this
Ikr
Someones school project
This is what a lot of money was thrown on
This
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
ok now thats just ragdoll stuff
<:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
crunchyroll is a joke
HELLO????
umm
and cgi on the right
a 2d drawing on the left
wtf am i looking at
ummm
that summs up the anime
pfft
but i have yet to watch it
i was interested in that one
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Ok moving on
I felt like the plot wasnt going to go far but with what happened in vol 3 and onward i just drop the series after vol 5 or 4
During the first 2 vols
Rwby was mostly about fighting
do it
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
shes a nice girl
so adding more salt to the wounds aint going to hurt
well she is a tsundere
with how the series sells itself
yeah but it isnt that demographic
but the series isnt really shounen
fair enough
tho he has a big brain
well some characters dont seem to be that rich
narrator is the best part
yeah kaguya is still a child on the inside
the best scene
ah yes
i never trusted MAL scores
oh yeah i need to check out sk8 at some point
*leaves a note saying ring my bell when shaman king and kaguya sama start airing*
i feel bad for the author of the series
now im just surprised this was green lighted
this is going to be a shit show
the first eps already told me well enough
it happened
yup
.......................
yup
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
eu timezones can be a bitch
ok fair point
if we talking og
for me at least
since it was interesting
i loved the s2 for MHA
and i think the reason i didnt finish it cuz i just want it to focus on games more
but i do consider it good
i havent finished beastars
and i think that shows some bias
and its never been knocked down from it
MAL sees FMAB as a number one anime on there list
doesnt conan get a lot of movies
with how long it has been running
even reading one piece can be a pain
just to see what it did when it went in its anime only route
but i do plan on rewatching it
i never finished the og fma
maybe later
i may check that out
lol
if the studio itself cant do animation that well
tho i myself still cant believe how someone green lighted that anime
men kinda is full of mysterious stuff
https://discord.com/channels/336297387863703552/371105434771390465/801011995737718795
ill tell you that much
its a long scroll
we went over this already
and i think i did myself a favor
i saw a few spoilers for rent a girlfriend i was like ok im going to avoid this like the plage
but it was funny to me at some points
honestly gamers was just a shit show
<:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
HAHAHAHAHA
PFFT
i watched like 1 ep of snafu
<@!87512939107450880> hype
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@468591607332208641>
It seems like mostly spirits get new voices
Nice
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Well nothing can be done
vtubers at least get people that know what there doing
PFFT
with ps2 graphics
but someone the direction for this shit is still a bloody flash animation
in one of the recent chapters
and i almost cryed
i read the webtoon
also only thing that i think carried goh was the fight scenes
so there up for grabs now
you will feel more dess
eat this fish
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
<:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
remember kids always watch the og series first before abridged
the series does get more wild as it goes on
but i didnt bother reading it yet
i seen tower of god
with how much it was cut out
well as a reader i was dissapointed after couple of eps
oh...
let aya see it all
carl
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
just
i know i know
uhhhh
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
and maria
due to basa
well it does fit idol to some degree
context
oi
i may get to a point where i may see IM@S
i seen it all
*sees bandori and other idol anime*
*seen LL*
cuz copyright time for making the scripts and voice acting right
for them to even make 1 ep
thing is it takes a year
ok i will wait for sinion
and be like
im just waiting on when there going to do ggo
theres still time for more stuff to be done
no ~~yes~~
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
you get sao jail
carl you dont get horny jail
<:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
PFFT
wtf
did it truely end
but the fire in peoples eyes
like i knew this was a haram and one girl was going to be choose
Everything revolves around that fucker
Honestly
if it did i think the wiki would have get better screenshots of some of the scenes
i dont think its on blu ray
since the wiki says its get released march 20 2020
i think the movie came out
2 characters that share some personality traits
when i first saw this i was like this is interesting
g and x need to make plans for
i have yet to finish wing
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~has it on psp~~
https://tenor.com/view/congratulations-tagged-dont-care-i-almost-gave-a-fuck-clapping-gif-16524662
i want to see mikazuki and setsuna in the same place
i wonder when are they going to confirm gundam beyond crossovers
then try to tackle the whole UC and AU
i would let myself watch gintama all day
you think im a mad man
saga
you want me to watch the whole UC
dude
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
a 7/10 if you ask me
and i thought that anime was alright
but i watched that cuz of a friend cuz we lost a tournoment
last anime i watched fully was zodiac wars
and some of them i have yet to finish
i tried to watch a lot of shows
but then again
i guess i was a sucker for anything my friends recommended to me
fair enough
sometimes it surprises me how some people manage to dodge LL like a bullet
No database
In season 2 it's fucking annoying sometimes
Not everything can have the brotherhood treatment
I assume never
For author to decide
That is all up in the air
Now when is komi going to get a anime
And this completes the trio of the teasers
It has its fair share of memes
Welp
talk about a turn of events
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
asterisk war left me wanting more
rakudai made me happy by the end of it
*puts a helmet on*
its war
welp
ok ok ok lets not go over there now
oh boi
<:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
so using a new song would have happened one way or another
remember contracts and stuff can get complicated
and im like dude how the fuck did we get to a human that has this much of a monkey brain
cuz music to him is mostly noise
the one where he start losing shit at cdawgva  for his money brain
you know what moment i enjoyed from gigguk
on trash taste
i enjoy gigguk
back at again people
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Well with memes who needs context
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Shaman king news time
missing cuz season 2s take over almost every anime ranking list
That hair is the most light green i seen
i think armada was the only transformers series that ever made me care for starscream
just seeing cybertron and armada theme songs videos
god my childhood memories are resparking again
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
And i can only imagine how the LNs are
People were making a big deal out of the first ep
ex arms was handled by a some random company does just does background for games
rwby was alright for its first 2 vols
what
im sorry
*music stops*
im going to make you eat carrots
you little shit
aya
we are at a point of where CGI became the norm for some anime
*watched few AU gundams*
they need other cash cows
they been going ham on gundam years ago
well shes at this point is not ready for the shit thats  happening in the manga currently
she was frozen for that long
yup
yup
i mean for the whole series to finish
i think at this point i may wait for it to be over
when the author had too much change
I heard the series picked in its first arc
~~im assuming the author~~
yup
I just take a peak in that chat once in a blue moon
It's in XDU
God have mercy
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
In symphogear
I forget AU is a thing sometimes
FUUUUUUUUKKKK
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
Au maria exists
Oh wait
But i could be proven wrong
her voice to me sounds she could only go as far as teenager voice
Idk if she can voice a loli
And maybe some other role im most likely forgetting
Tho i only knew her as rias
~~played a bit of bang dream~~
You can't really not notice her voice there
Diana cavendish <:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>

I asked cuz of this comment
Isn't mio voiced by maria
I enjoyed new game
Isnt that 2nd girl from a show about eating or something like that
Whats the reason that one get axed
The first chapter already told me enough
Lol
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Gura stans
we all have a way to watch anime
at least the harddrives have some peace
it was a bit rushed
it did end
yes
For its own good
Aot was over hyped
Oh no
To a degree
Digimon is a isekai
Or sao is a isekai
At this point we are going to awaken cypher again
I be willing to try them
Tho i never played the games
Some people would consider it one
.Hack
Im ready to see a dumpster fire
I cant wait for nux to make a video
Tho if Aot s4 does surprise fmab on mal
And let the steam clear
Ok i think ill just back off now
<:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
Cuz someone posted one of the ln art
I think i seen the ending
Honestly that anime is fun to watch
Im still waiting for someone to pick up interest in devil is a timer
That one is my fav
Ash like snow
Season 1 ops are good

https://youtu.be/7M79uz1BmxI
Back log is going to cover the basement
Since i played one of the gundam games and seen what some mechs looks like it sparked my interest
I still need to get into UC animes
~~i start it with ibo but i would recommend 00~~
It is one of the good gate ways to gundam
Where the second season end it it up not being on the same lvl as the first
Had the same feeling as psycho pass
While 00 s2 was good
Then maybe try to watch origin
I still need to watch the movie
Cuz i dont want this to be another fate zero case
<@87512939107450880> i remember you saying to me to watch origin if i want it to get into the UC but what if i start it with recap movies and watch origin when i watched most of the UC
Someone is pulling the guns out on this
Its gundam
I feel like a war is about to start
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
Im not sure about that one chief
Guns and a pack of grenades
Oi
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
cuz i dont want to rewatch season 1 again
but i need to remember at what point did i stop
i still need to watch more SnS
but i think it isnt on the same lvl as baccano
i enjoyed it
*starts feeling sad*
.....
fuko
why is death knocking on someones door
*hears the music playing*
play the VN
the anime that some people would call a dumpster fire
clannad
oh god
https://tenor.com/bpn2j.gif
faster then people that can grind out FGO events
cuz they just keep putting more and more ship girls
all see of AL is fanservice
pfft
holy mother of sea i didnt know that
but horny part
i knew this years ago
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
yeah they make sure they have big tits and thicc legs
https://tenor.com/view/reference-captain-america-avengers-understood-gif-7991943
i like to think beyblade just has a different universe
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
they get another gear va in SK
huh

tho it was madhouse that did the animation for season 1
the animation kinda switched between season 1 and 2
i cant deny that
eat the fish
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
we been over this like 100 times
i was never aware of them being trans
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
but never really liked the guy
watched few of his videos
i was never a fan of digi
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
honestly even from the thumbnail i can tell
people will still debit on the point of avatar being a anime
~~and riot has yet to release there animated series~~
but if netflix considers it one i guess its whatever
not sure if i would consider it a anime

i think i heard hear voice so many times that shes easy to notice now
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
maybe the ears need it some cleaning
well she is well known
well its all a matter of time
*sits in the background*
since the games are more then enough for me
i cant be bothered to pick up the animes
*sees persona 3* i see you are a person of culture
classics
since both batmans are different people
i would give it a pass
destiny on the other hand
but still nowhere near on the same lvl as other gundams
seed isnt that bad
well that was unexpected
<:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
akame ga kill can be put in the back log
watch eden of the east
but its sad the manga get a short end of the stick
more then anything
i mostly remember the wired powers they used
hmm
keijo
More then the there own
Even japan liked the dub
It sold poorly
Oh i think people that grow up with the 4kids dub would still like it or hold a place in there hearts
And it was good for me
I watched AC dubbed
Well nothing he can do about it
For some reason
I was confused about rukias gender
Tho for bleach
But fma and bleach were the only anime i watched in sub
Cuz as a kid hearing ed and al being voiced by women was super wired
In sub
Tho i think fma will always been wired for me
Yeah
Cuz hearing lilith from borderlands can be kind odd
Well i perfer jp
Erza
I liked natsu in the dub
Yeah thats one of the reasons i cant watch the newer dubs
Even tho i still love some of there eng ops
But then again 4kids really did a number on some anime
As a kid
I would be confused
Cuz with how online works its easier ro find sources
I think when you grow up with some western changes japan names could be seen as wired
Well the series was based on games
But i cant remember that too well
I think it stopped mid way as well for me
It get fixed
Its still a thing
I remember finishing shaman king
Or i never seen them
Cuz for some reason last eps didnt air
Tho as a kid i think i finished like few shows
I forget about b daman
Oh yes
The 2000s was the year of toy based anime
To watch some old anime in sub
I cant bother
Metal i think i was close to finishing
Beyblade i never finished
Shadow realm
4kids just censored stuff to the point of being a meme
Oh yeah
Cuz kojima does
But the again people care for eng voice acting in mgs more
Idk if she voiced someone in mgs but I think she did one of the songs for one of the games
It may even been more jarring
Just wait till you get to her video game roles
Sugita also does this but most of his roles he fits in well
Tho he isn't the only one guilty of it
Cuz dear lord i can hear the same ton from a mile away
Is the one that voiced kirito
I think only time i finding someones voice jarring
Miyuki sawashiro is another good example
Then males
Females just end up having more range
Oh god here comes the memes
Im like
Japan and eng
Whenever i hear kiritos voice
Lol
Marias VA i dont find wired
Or fitting
Hearing him in other roles can be wired
With how well his va did the job
Oh yeah
Yeah
Tho this can apply to every voice acting
I also forget to add they only do roles they worked on before
And the ones that once voiced in anime bearly do it or just do games
Well there aren't many eng vas for anime compare to japan
with how rushed it was
arifureta get bombed
GuP is nothing out of woods
i mean if KC and AL exist
i cant say that cuz i didnt watch it
if both are equally bad
and idk which ver is worst at this point
with how it ended
people give akame ga kill manga shit was well
idk about the manga
in the anime at least
yes
cuz copyright
sometimes
on dailymotion you can find some useful stuff
cuz that long ass name was just a joke
but not what carlos is thinking about
i think he had a name
i swear that song is tough twister
ohhh.....
we going there now
~~tho a jet set radio anime would be interesting~~
Or something rollerskating related
I want a anime thats kinda like jet set radio
Well i can see what its selling point is
Free
I never seen free and banana fish i heard good things about banana fish
I need to to watch that at some point
When it makes them bank
And bones killing mha
But then again i really dont care
I heard the 2nd one is cannon
I say that arc was alright
I seen at the end of the school festival
I didnt see the movies
im not really familiar with star trek
idk
yeah this looks generic as it can get
<:MikuPanic:640289659452129310>
*me who lives in a small country*
doesnt eu have its own distributors
i saw it
i watch gridman and i can tell its a taokusatsu show
and  thats april fools day
but i mean its coming out april 1st
i know
this has to be a joke
shaman king is coming april first
wait
but never watched it
i know about the series
Tho is it just me or does it look like they kinda animated some parts from the first season in that preview
If there any confirmations
Is this being done by the same studio and staff?
Also they seem to be going with with LN artstyle
Now they have enough source material to adapt i hope it gets good as the first season was
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Isn't the LN close to ending
And the wait better be worth it
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
YES!!!
It's a good one
Classroom of the elite i can understand cuz people have been saying it wasn't adapted well
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I read one comment talking about how this Devil is getting a season 2 but no game no life and classroom of the elite doesn't
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
I guess i was talking out of my ass
Yeah everything is new
I mean people waiting few years for aot
gundam doesnt have many female MCs that pilot a gundam as far as i know
idk if i would count builder series
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
tho now that i think about medabot getting a reboot doesnt sound like a bad idea
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
i guess only things left to reboot are yu gi oh bdamon medabot and beyblade
guess 2020 era of anime could be the come back era
it seems
a lot of old shows are coming back
LN spoilers flying left and right
cuz when it airs
well enjoy it while you can
cuz i think its better to adapt the LN then having a anime original ending that can be worst then the LN ending
is it really worth it
and i need to ask this question
so i forget to mention this but i seen some people asking for a anime original ending for devil is a part timer cuz of the LN ending
but i still think is one of the gundams you can start watching
i hold some bais for it
well it was my first gundam
well honestly s2 of IBO had its ups and downs and im one of the people that accapted the ending for what it was
i say the second season kinda went more into normal gundam stuff
OH COME THE HELL ON
i still need to watch the movie
i forget when that event happened
or 3
its been confirmed like last year or 2 ago
the i do like the first ending of destiny
and im like yeah this is a trainwreck
told me everything
thing is the intro to destiny
still seeds has its problems
but me hearing how bad it was enough for me to give it a look
i wish i avoided seed
cuz i heard there working on a 3rd season for it
i was thinking 00 and few new gundams
dont see it happening
with other projects sunrise has
the west on another hand doesnt have many VAs for anime
since japan gives care to voice acting
not really
i heard the last one didnt do some well
i dont think so
i do wish sunrise take a crack at it
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
hell yeah brother
problem ends up being people that end up having good ideas for mechas dont have a good cast
lol i dont thinks going to happen anytime soon
just dont feel like watching many right now
i have a lot of anime on my bucket list
no else can prove me wrong
gundam is overrated
till shaman king comes
my current interest is in black clover
idk if ill watch that
*slowly moves to the window*
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
oh
do we have any news of the author
if its been 3 years
and you good
well dont start the season 2 meme
<:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
you update on asterisk war
tho i have to ask
my brain doesnt allow me to
i cant be bothered to read the novels
<:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>
.....
https://youtu.be/cvZ9thKolOA
and it looks good
i saw the trailer for the way of the househusband
will be just going in circles
can we move on from is
for the user itself
if the suit itself has some that makes light
but right now black clover is taking my interest
i still need to pick that up again
i heard the Ln explains the reason why ichika acts like that
i doubt it
seasons 2 kinda dumbed her down
ok lay it on me
and my brain questions wtf it has seen
i seen ||drakengard endings||
cuz all i see is a series memed to death
well i at this point lost all interest in ngnl
i question how the author gets away with writing that stuff
what site is that
||oh yes x2||
and seeing a lot of other things
seeing girls work out
good thing i didnt fall into that trap
that get tricked into watching it
i will feel bad for people
and redo of the healer is going to become the next boku no pico
https://tenor.com/view/gintama-drunk-gintoki-sakata-drinking-drink-gif-16080265
its still something
we going there
oh damn
<:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
cuz its a hentai
manga give me enough reason not to
im asking myself many questions right now
she must be protcc
https://tenor.com/view/sao-ggo-alternative-anime-blink-gif-11733216
more of that pls
i think there mind set wasnt gunslinger girls
*only in dreams*
reality is often cruel in many ways
thats not in there moral code
never
ok let me see here
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
that is a relic of time
could be a old one
*jumps out the window* (fuck this im out)
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
akiba is everywhere
problem ends up being no subs
both are in netflix jail
same case with shaman king
fuck
its airing in april
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
*goes back to watching black clover*
it goes into this
<@!87512939107450880> this what happens when you bring rance up
and ~~i know he has hentais~~
but i know who he is
i forget his name
from one VN
lol
its going to be worth it
no matter who you pull for
well stitch did have a anime
they put stitch in a lot of wired places
whats going to happen to the series that were dub by them
tho with 4kids out of the pic at this point
besides pokemon
that could be sad for all of 4kids anime they took
i find it funny how 5ds is the only anime to not have the mc go berserk or switch to the dark side
5ds just didnt give a fuck
freedom
irony at its finest
since tmnt cartoon 4kids did was relicensed by nickelodeon
true
welp god know how the anime is going to turn out
is the game even out
I assume its ahead
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
There's always the manga
question is who is it going to be
yugi did it
the stuff of nightmares
I think the last movie i seen in theaters was the sonic movie with a friend
But its kinda sad i get into watching movies in theaters in 2019
When its a movie im interested in
I like it
Cuz as far as i know in my country they dont show anime in theaters
Well not like ill ever see a anime movie in my area
I forget movies exist sometimes for some anime cuz it takes forever to come out
Or the anime is close to it
i kinda a doubt one person can work for that many publishers
well talk about bad luck
<:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
when a LN gets published by them
well i guess now people are going to feel pain
if the publisher is not willing to add it back
well theres nothing it can be done
seven seas also publishes Mushoku Tensei
classroom of the elite?
that i think people who work for the publishers can explain
so i cant really speak much about this
i didnt read it
yeah
this part
||The reference is cultural as there are specific comedic stereotypes that are intentionally played up by gay entertainers on Japanese television programs. Members of Japan's LGBTQ+ community have been critical of these portrayals and how they may perpetuate homophobia. ||
in some cases
its the subject that matters
but if its part of the character development i can see how this can be a problem for readers that had to relay on fan translations
i can understand the problematic part
well that sucks
but at least when they plan on making a season 2 at least will have something
yeah its going to be a long wait
just to see how things were there
after that i may reread the manga
have yet to reach last arc
im still in the filler arcs
i consider black clover more fun then MHA
funny enough
till the season starts
and i still have enough eps left to watch black clover
out of all the anime coming out
ill watch shaman king and edens zero
At best shes fine for me
I didnt like her
and i know few book stores i can buy manga
tho i can read jojo on it if ever feel like it lol
to at least show my support for the series
still willing to pay for the manga
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
but there also the leaks
i did
*me who want it to read black clover on it*
to say the least
at least we know there not down forever
question is how long is it going to take
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
again the music industry isnt a kinda one
true
~~i know theres germany and there laws are really questionable at best~~
funny how us censors itself more then most other regions would
tho funny enough in jp dub they do say the stand names correctly cuz they cant edit that
~~even tho it would be cool to find out what stand references the song but nooo thats just not right~~
cuz the music industry isnt really a fan of there music being used or referenced
i understand why
while it sucks
when being translated legally
this has been the case in the anime and manga
the names reference songs
in some eu countries
seems like copyright law is different
as the japan ones
by censored i mean stand name are still the same
and i heard jojo isnt censored there
out of all the eu regions it seems
tho amazon seems to have options
last time i check some black clover vol were 10$
well theres amazon
thats what im going to do when i get a job
^
well what other way do you want to show support
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
yeah that can happen
i heard they also had a databreach
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so
cuz i dont feel like it
and now i cant even bother to finish it
whats also funny is that aot was one of the first series i watched when i found out what anime was
cuz i can tell its a shit show
idk if ill ever finish that one
and nisekoi
as long as im not spoiled too much on the story
and i have no problems with spoilers
i been hearing from trash taste there been people on a spoiler spree on twitter
at least it wasnt aot lvls of bad tbh
true
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I had to do it
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
https://twitter.com/Crunchyroll/status/869648840512610305
cuz i really enjoyed it
i regret being a idiot
and now that i watched
when i look at black clover i used to shit on it with how slow the first few eps were
theres always one shonen thats going to become big
maybe ufotable
idk why
demon slayer i heard the shit show that happened
its mainly how it was drawn and colored i think
my brother had issues with aot
then it switched
*me slowly closing the door and waiting for the next ep of black clover*
its been a juggernaut since the first season aired
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
and people hype mappa
honestly i wonder how much 4kids would ruin anime if they were still active
but they screwed over the deaths
they kinda keeped the same plotline in 5ds
to meme on
that was 4kids
shonen jump did publish it
yi gi oh pfft
thats what i can say
symphogear has shonen elements
still you can get something good out of it
battle shounens while milked to death
but i cant say that myself
bleach i hear how shit it is
naruto ended on alright note
but what ends up killing it for anime onlys is filler
naruto has some good
then god knows
unless its devil is a part timer case where people want a anime only ending
cuz i have not fully seen the series
i need to rewatch it
one piece its going to take few more years for it to end
yeah but bleach is over the manga at least and naruto just keeps going cuz of boruto
does the big 3 need to exist at this point
like i question at this point
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
im not finishing that shit
dear lord
oreimo
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
lets move this before this place becomes a kr forum post
i was about to say
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
but i think ill need to find a entry point
i been meaning to watch KR
but the dub has its place
has a good voice cast
i say jp one is alright
DN its agreed on both sub and dub are good
but isnt 4kids a different company now
wasnt it konami
https://tenor.com/view/smug-anime-girl-kawaii-look-gif-16033329
or happy
want to feel dissapointed
still a dumpster fire
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
just so he can have another shot at it
and made eromanga sensei
the author did everyone dirty
and yet people still want it reanimated
The guy grow into a good character
The poor guy
Lol
Need check again to make sure
And last time i checked vanessa is voiced by <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Yami he has a great one
I know some VAs
In jp well
Its mostly new faces for me last i checked
Well twitter speaks for itself
As a person
As a actor his good
I don't really like the guy much
And all might
Voices vegeta
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Since at this point hearing screams in Japanese is just normal at this point
I can't bother with the dub
And i wonder how people can hear after hearing aqua scream
Him screaming becomes less of a annoying thing
And anime
On the manga
Im fully cought up
And yami shines
I argue in the current arc there some great fights
I can tell the anime end it on a cliffhanger
Cypher you just awaken my sad side
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Things are getting really interesting
Cuz hoo boy 💦
Tho ill not speak too much about the manga unless someone is talking about it in <#377148557796442134>
Tho it does give manga the time for content
Or a movie
But chances are new seasons is coming soon
I hear there going to make a announcement
And the anime is going to end on a cliffhanger
Currently that arc is still on going
Ah so close to the spade arc
Devil believer or captains fighting
Cuz the anime is ending next week
At what point is the dub at
I say she my 2nd fav captain
Mereleona oh boy in the manga she just keeps showing why shes a beast and a strong captain
He is still wheels
But still
I can only imagine the pain
Youtube i kinda felt like it forget about her
There getting some long running anime
And worst part is
And I don't want to wait a month or 2 for a show to be watchable
Since its clear how there airing there shows
Tho im getting more worried by netflix at this point
I forget hulu is a thing sometimes
Where there posting classic anime
Oh yeah theres that one channel
If sony doesn't get crunchyroll then there going to need to do something else
At this point everything is the air
Funi is in select regions
Tho for the most part crunchyroll and neflix have a high ground in most areas
~~i stopped caring about the anitube community for the most part~~
No other youtuber promotes them from what i seen
But that one from what i seen has been promoted by tfs
Owned by sentai filmworks
Hi dive
They do own funmation
Yes
And crunchyroll is one of the big ones
If we talking legally
There like few platforms for anime
so crunchy roll isnt sony yet
Cypher is going to lose it
pfft
<:ShirabeSleep:691497302535176302>
most jp VAs are in there early 20s
But the manga still outshines it in a lot of areas
I consider black clover anime alright in terms of its artstyle
Well it each there own as some people say
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
But with april around the corner i think ill be busy with few shows
I could try rewatch some anime i dropped or didn't both to watch
Tho i think i burned out on anime at that point
*X  doubt*
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
That gal made me feel cringe
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I remember the main girl being annoying
Citrus i forget about that anime
cuz i dont want to spoil anything
but im not sure if we are at the mid point in the manga or close to the end
yeah
the arc isnt finished yet
currently where the manga is at
im not sure if black clover movie is going to continue where the anime left off or is it going to be filler
yeah
i keep up with the manga
man i start feeling bad about black clover ending next week
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
well what else is there being ruined by the anime
anime didnt keep me hooked for long
but meh
the plot was interesting
i hear the manga gets bad later on
So at best 2 or 3 seasons
Depending how much was adapted

https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-03-28/black-clover-anime-gets-film/.171224
I just check profiles to see if its a nickname or the actual name
and it will tell you
see some clips of it
since there streaming the series
yes
chances are crunchyroll could get it
sad
yeah its going to follow the manga most likely
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But i may need to reread the manga
So ill have something to keep up with
Im reading the manga
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
Regret is kicking in from ep 1 im assuming
Its called trash for a reason
if i decide
i play it
well say have to mob
if crunchyroll picks it up
depending on the publisher
Or different studios that are part of them
Doesn't a1 have devisions
This how japan works
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
But a bit less painful in some cases
It's not better
Depending on the region
There are some differences
Cuz thats how the industry is
The production is always a nightmare
Not really easy in Japan
I knew there pay wasn't good but this
Jesus christ
and talk about a shonen that just gets right to the point
so i decided to watch jujutsu kaisen
currently watching the last seasons anime
im waiting for shaman king to show up
From what i heard
The manga ended out of nowhere
But i forget the series was canceled
I was thinking it was going to be longer
I think
63?
I was thinking it was going to be 100 eps or some where close to that
https://tenor.com/view/anime-cute-shocked-zoom-surprised-gif-14778758
52 eps
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Maki is best girl for me
First and second years are really good characters
Since i really enjoyed the cast
But im going to give manga a shot
<:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714>
Movie is coming as well
And it hooked me in for more
So i finished jujutsu kaisen
<:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
Its been years
||Cuz ubw just killed her off||
Tho HF give me a different view on medusa
But dont feel like it
I can watch it
Since i do remember that happening in 2
Yes
so what i missed
Xqc is a trouble maker
But i nerver realize how long the first arc was in the og anime
Yeah i enjoyed it
And there just speeding things up it seems
So i watched the first ep of shmam king
This is just funny to me
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
and me being a scrub who never seen godzilla and knows what a godzilla is
i think people that watched a lot of movies
when i think godzilla
<:ShiraBean:736607747834904667>
but i need to ask this is this anime for fans of the movies
so im interested in godzila singular point
it sounds like mech to me
And i also know the author loves guns
Cuz the author worked on that one
Only reason i know of kino is cuz of SAOAGGO
I didnt even realize it was her voicing kino
of who can recommend a good anime or a troll pick
i swear to god this just a fiesta
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
PFFT
with mechs
https://tenor.com/view/anime-reaction-headsmack-ugh-frustrated-gif-5015289
if you want a shonen watch jujustu kaisen
*cough cough*
but
yeah it is idol and bands
twintails is funny
yeah
and i cant help but compare it to those
but it has sentai elements
if you ask me
more like sentai
twintails isnt mech
seen it
hit me with your best shots
any shonen recommends
so im going to ask this just to make this more fun
and only things i watched were shonen anime
cuz i just get back into anime last month
since i dont have much on my mind
i cant recommened anime
https://tenor.com/view/doubt-gif-13250124
but i just sleep on it
i heard about it
lol
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Till the reboot
Shaman king i never heard the sub cuz the dub was all i had
Cuz it really confused me if the character was a male or a female
As a kid i found it wired
And funny enough eds jp va is the shaman king
That's how i was when i watched FMA
Part 1 and 2 i think had the game cast return
So it was going to happen to rest of the parts
I know in part 4 the cast changed for some characters
At this point im not surprised
With there own goals
Cuz almost everyone in fate zero is just feels like a damn animal
But ill expect it to be a good time
I need to watch the movie
And kinda pathetic
Ok now that's just sad
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
In fate zero they give me reasons to hate him
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
||a trash bag||
There grand father clearly knew what shinji was
No what matter what reason he has
Shinji is a piece of shit to the core
Im saying is that its trying to be like dc/marvel comics
Want better wording
I just feel like is going more dc/marvel comics
Doesn't mean its isnt going to stay a shonen
I said something more then a shonen
Ummm
Then a shonen
But with how much it tries to be something more
Its not the school thats the problem for me
And this is completely different compare to black clover and jjk
Already get boring to me
Demon slayer
Mha just fails to grab my attention
Heres the thing for me
*me in the cornor waits for more shonen to show up*
Since i never heard of it till last 2 years ago
Nanoha is the only magical girl series i kinda didnt care for much
I like my shonen
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I think i been sleeping on madoka for far too long now
^
In fsn they didn't feel like that
In fate zero almost everyone felt like a animal
We'll agree to disagree
Ufotable carries the show
I kinda felt bored with it
Demon slayer
That made it worth a watch
But i still it has good qualities to it
As well
Jjk has pacing issues
Black clover i can say it has fun with being a shonen
We talking dbz yu yu yu hakusho
Since i like how the characters are  written in it
But if i had to pick a fav shonen it would be black clover
But i do like it
Ft isnt my fav shonen
For it
I give ft a pass
But it can be over looked
In some anime it is bs
It could be one of the popular ones
That cant be turned off
Well madoka kinda flipped a switch in magical girl shows
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I heard of fruits basket
And are doing different content
I think most anitubers moved on
For anime
At this point you are your own critic
And readable
Well that was a dumpster fire that was watchable
And domestic girlfriend
Everyone agreed eromanga was bad
Cuz black clover was just hitting me in the right spot
I stopped watching
I regretted it
And give it a fair shot
But when a friend ask me to watch it
With how it was adapted
I was one of the people that hated it
I say it did
Can I ask did the hate for black clover help it in the long run
But it didn't explode like demon slayer
I can see why you would disagree
Yeah
Depsite its problems
It get during its airing
Jjk was worth the hype
Ill say one thing
God eater idk what happened there
For anime
Ufotable is what i would call a carry studio
That one i could read
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Unless it's a VN
Im lazy to read a novel
I sometimes ask myself how much time does the author take to think of stuff that happens in monogatari
So more time for the author to mind blow people
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
I need to ask this but are the monogatari LNs still on going
Jojo part 6 anime
First thing every anime fan wakes up is this
<:KirikaScared:672584678993297431>
To let you know
Already been posted
<:KirikaWarm:688187760095658246>
*me waiting for a new bc chapter*
But i would throw money for a manga
Idk if i would buy blurays
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
No
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Tongue twister in coming
But it can change as the series goes on
I can call shaman king 2001 a meh adaptation now
Im in my 20s
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
A era i was born in
2000s anime
And its alright
I watched it dub
Then the sub
And its the one series i see clips of the dub more
But i never finished it
And watched few eps
i wasnt even sure if it had one
It took few years for each part to come out at that point
but still it felt weak
i thought season 1 was alright
well im not denying that
and i heard manga readers dissapointmet
i seen the anime
for rosario + vampire
i saw some chapters in a book store
I forget how many eps is edens zero going to have
||yeah||
And i read the manga to that point
And i completely forget about what happens to happy in this series
The story is going full si fi
I need to read the manga
It was good
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I watched the preaired eps
*me who seen ep 1 and 2 on gogoanime*
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
And the 2nd ep is where i dropped the manga
So i watched edens zero last night
<@87512939107450880> <:ShirabeToast:672245704118501376>
Kissanime was alright
Netflix
*looks at funimation*
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
I just made mine today
Super what now
At best
So 7.5
Since im sure i was close to the end
I still need to finish it
But it didn't really hook me
Grindman was alright
Tokyo revengers kinda interests me
Rest dont pick my interests much
Shaman king and edens zero
There only 2 im interested in
Now I think about it
It was printed at shonen jump before
Shaman king is a shonen
Shaman king
<:HibikiMonch:688190074646691843>
Well im stuck with shonens
Im watching some spring anime and winter ones im interested in
But winter is fine
I meant spring
<:HibikiMonch:688190074646691843>
<@87512939107450880> what have you watched this season so far
But problem was the site had its short comings
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
||so when its getting blown up||
*me who knows how gundam can go*
No wonder the manga readers give it so much praise
And wow
So 2 eps in horimiya
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
And nova if it was LL you would excuse me
https://tenor.com/view/mha-bnha-gif-19566545
If you excuse me
Well ill go see horimiya
No life punches me in the face all the time
Life isn't always free
<:HibikiMonch:688190074646691843>
So why the rush
We have many options for girls
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
in a way
since it is a history piece
not like its going to be forgotten to time
its sad will never get a dub like it ever again
with how random it was
you had a laugh
let me guess
so is the egg fresh
~~tho he is more of a samurai then a ninja in that one~~
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
years later
batman gets his own ninja movie
and funny enough
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
umm
*currently busy with horimiya*
and thats about it
all i know about is that the girl besides him is a robot
well i can kinda tell
maybe cuz of the artstyle
big o seems like a 70s or 80s anime to me
i seen a yt video where the big o mc was doing one of his special moves
With the writing on a questionable lvl
Boruto just feels like naruto all over again
Cuz really no real point in watching it
Boruto i give up on
The ball seemed to just bounce off her face
Shes always innocent
https://tenor.com/view/love-live-sunshine-gif-10887704
yeah you just entered a dumpster fire
||too late you cant cancel now||
I still need to watch og vanguard
Sometimes i question what venguard turns into each anime they air
unless i want to see that dumpster fire on display
and i have no reason to watch it
i seen clips
Since im close to the end
Well i can finish horimiya
Looks like things are really slow this season
Yup
But more speed up
It felt like the start of naruto all over again to me
I never watched it
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Since waiting is a bitch
Need to finish horimiya
Well right now watching some winter stuff from last season
*2 days later*
<:TriplePeek:689568598938615939>
Well as a character chika didn't felt bland
the west just doesnt see it the same way japan does
https://tenor.com/view/kermit-shoot-lol-gun-frog-gif-16181496
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
And they used nico
It says girls and panzer there
Oh i realized
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
*me who isnt a fan of nico*
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Im kinda ehh about tokyo revengers
Maybe i was just burned out at that point
I can't remember the reason why i didn't finish zombieland saga
The manager was best part of zombieland saga for me
Not many changes it seems
Shanan king reboot ep 3
Maybe im being too judgemental on it
But idk
And it seems good
I watched ep 0
I feel like i can tell where is heading
The pain is always there
All up in the air at this point
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
A gundam movie that is a god sent
What's going to out match Eva and Demon slayer
Lol
Its been used for memes
I know that one
Lol
Lol
They need the money
No
🚔
And we know oversaturated stuff dies easy or it stays for a long time
Well isekai isn't dying
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
But the differences are clear in the reboot
Im watching it for nostalgia reasons
But mha is a skip for me
And mha
Besides shaman king
Not like there many this year
Ft took things from rave master
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
*watching all the ships sail*
Erza always gets a upgrade
Just different from what the manga was
I wouldnt say bad
Yes
More then s1s
I liked s2 artstyle
Tho funny enough
And it was meant to chill things out
Yeah that one was made cuz the anime was getting close to the manga
Most of them were trash for me
I mean you are not wrong
Yes
The one about the clock
One of the fillers is cannon
Cypher
Shonen writers seem just add another world or continent
For edens zero
Its still early
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Cuz her tsundere roles are all taken
Rie will play any small cute creatures
Lets not go back to that childish debate again
Ok now
I bloody knew it
I feel like im going to be disappointed
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Shes the childhood friend that lost to the worst girl
Its just that
No
Oh lisanna
Pfft
Still i find his past sad
You going to do him dirty like that
*looks at gray*
Lol
I always think she has both working eyes
I keep forgetting she has one
I forget that part
Oh yeah
But we can see both her eyes all the time
She sometimes does
That's a plus
But if he is a chad
Well i watched a few eps i only see him as a guy that loved nobu a lot
Guess he earned the title of demon and fool
Well then
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
I do know nobu often gets potrayed as evil
What's next sengoku basara
I watched a few eps of that anime
Unless i look at the song creator
I can't spot a composer that easy
For ft
Yeah he made banger tracks
Ohh
Yasuharu?
He is a piece of wood
No argument there
What did natsu do wrong
https://tenor.com/view/shots-drinks-drink-pour-gif-8561333
Welp
Since only thing i have on my mind is bc
Ok so what else we can talk about
Ok fair enough
Monoeyes?
Unless there's actual focus on it
With eyes you don't think much about
There's more
Poor manga dex
Nice
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Holy mother of yu gi oh what is this
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
well i do know the artist draw hentai
<:MichaLaugh:816901827349184513>
cuz internet
all i see from nagatoro are memes
she does dominate gil with force
If i remember right in the spin off manga the other world natsu and lucy get a kid
I saw it
Wtf is this
<@87512939107450880>
In some isekai
I kinda forget about the stats
cuz one can always be used in a good way
you cant really get rid of tropes
my bad
since that had stats and skills
i keep thinking of rising of the shield hero
cuz some characters feel like a peace of wood anyways
in sao the stats to me just dont exist
yeah cant aruge with that
i like romance and drama anime
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
im more of a shonen trash boy
but i really dont care about them that much
i can rewatch some i like
tbh
im kinda burned out of it
depending on the writing
I think you get my point
And by macross i mean delta
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Tho you know what would be funny if ll went macross route
Well that's how it is
Here comes the ll squad
Sunrise always has a mecha anime in their pocket
Then its a all out war
And when they get to food tiers
I just watch it cuz i find it fuuny how 3 people just talk random stuff
I remember someone from trash taste saying it was like a car cash that landed perfectly
Season 2 was a mess
But looking back
To me it was good
Isn't that the one the director of code geass is working on
Cuz how much its used in most stories in animes
Haram isnt really something i would consider to be the next boom
And what ever trigger brings out
Only thing mecha i can think right now is gundam
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Im just waiting for a new genre to come out for anime and people to jump on the bandwagon
Oh we just going start cutting heads now
Time travel
<@!87512939107450880> so i watched ep 3 and 4 of edens zero and now i just feel like ok mashima different timeline stuff now
oh the original anime
no man needs his pudding
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
dont over do it
careful now
Normally i would expect shit to hit the fan by ep 4 or 5
well call me impressed
the anime only covered 7 chapters currently
interesting
huh
Thanks
I just need to find a site
Of the story
I just want more
I need to read the manga
madhouse can still milk it for all its worth
its not really hard for me to tell them apart
is that the childhood friend wins anime
the meme is dead
from gx
ah the best girl
and i need to pick up trinity seven again
i think you know who i mean
the reminds me of that one fgo servent
i need to read more
||the sister|| made me laugh
pfft
one time i was surprised
tbh
her arc was great
since homura isnt in the anime yet
arent we entering spoilers
rebecca managed to get herself out of sticky situations
shiki well he is shiki
i like how the characters grow
mashima did improve in his writing
and i can safely say
<@!87512939107450880> i read a lot of edens zero 2 days ago
besides for castlevenia
who remembers the turbo grafx 16
in fairness
And the ending just made me scream wtf
Since the anime felt a bit off
I say read the manga
But tbh
It had ovas
Like few years ago
It was alright
I seen the anime
UQholders
I heard the author want it to do a mecha series or something like that but they want it him to do another haram
Yeah they have the same author
Never watched or read it
Wasn't the author the same one that did love hina
But turns out its known in the manga and anime community
I was thinking it was nish
Tho i havent heard many people talk about negima
We all degenrates here to some extent
And tbf
But she was a low tier student
Asuna grow on me a bit
And i liked the characters
Look this one of those anime i found randomly on yt
What question
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>

The store i brought it from also had 2 and 3 of this big boys
<:ShiraBean:736607747834904667>
I see you are a man of culture
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
She did
Yes
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
And i want it black clover but it was sold
I liked the anime
I can explain

So i just brought my first manga and i feel kinda embarrassed
But that one felt like it entered anime only stuff real quick
Also i forget to mention i watched both the original anime and (the remake?) liked the remake more
I was surprised how ||justice had a relationship with elsie||
In the last arc
As far as i can remember she hasn't shown up a lot
In the current arc she has some relevants
And a badass
But mashima clearly loves making her op
Shes is alright
Well
Hmmm
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It shows he has grown a little
Im enjoying it surprisingly
Currently the manga is a 7/10
I read all of edens zero
Cypher
and i just start it buying negima manga
UQ holder is ending
talk about timing
lol
ok moving on
when someone opens this place
its always out of context
One more to go
<:HibikiMonch:688190074646691843>

Shiki is one of those anime i heard of but never watched
Unless i really loved it and can come back to it
Cuz to me it watching it once is enough
Tho im lazy to rewatch anime sometimes
Tho i have yet to watch the movie
And problems
I think you would find holes you never noticed
Cant deny
S2 is where i just felt like shit just happened
S1 i didnt have a lot of problems with
Tho i think i can name some endings cuz i skip them most of the time
Just keep going
https://tenor.com/view/stress-confused-lost-help-sos-gif-6372986
With watching so many anime it becomes hard
There a lot of good ops but i never have a fav unless we are talking about a series
Its high tier for me
I just wasn't interested in them
Nothing against the other ops for the series
Flow and there ops are always bangers
Or a different timeline
And im like is this its own thing
I watched the first movie
And whatever was boukoku no akito
Yeah code geass has a lot of recap movies
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
If its a series that exist fanfics exist as well
Well i think some people just set themselves up for a happy ending
https://youtu.be/LcoLlB411So
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
But i have to go with C.C
I like them both
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Unless someone really want it to watch the movie that badly
Well cant say if its a bad thing
With new scenes i tried to watch them
I know there were recap films
That's why i want it to watch them before the movie
Honkai i barely remember anyones VA
I was thinking code geass
Its the reason the series is remembered well
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
Now I'm confused
Oh wait
Kallen isn't voiced by nana last time i checked
when i think honkai i think mei
when i hear raiden
i think metal gear
*looks at the outfits*
it is
but not all of them
i know there in other regions
i never used funi since they seem to care for america for the most part
well hi pirate sites
but if sony really wants crunchyroll
i kinda doubt thats going to go thourgh
but its kinda scary how much sony owns of the anime industry in the west
ok ill go jump off a cliff<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
sony seems to own almost everything
for sometime
aniplex and funi have been partners
sony more so
last time i checked
isnt durarara aniplex
i think this can go many ways
the reboot is still at that part
since the anime seems to be speed running the first arc
i need to read it at some point
i havent read or seen the animes for berserk
I was thinking he would at least be close to finishing berserk
I wake up and first thing i see is the author for berserk passed away
Well this is a sad day
What
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
That scene depending on the point of view could be laughable
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Sounds like gunpale models
<:ElsaSick:689395768754569359>
Sometimes i wished gundam versus was on pc
Sometimes i forget the mc is voiced by gil

Tho i know how some of the mechs in g gundam look thanks to gundam vs gundam
All i know about g gundam is that the eng va for the mc and the antagonist voiced megaman x and sigma
Welp here it comes
~~im still willing to buy the manga~~
Tho currently im on a reading spree of negima
At some point ill get a urge to watch g gundam
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Tho gundam now days seems to give rival characters a fucked up face and have a mask
I...... Have no words for this one.
Patricks plot armor was that big
Well tbf i never really cared
Cuz i havent thinked about them since 2018 or 19
Sure is wired how it feels like they have been forgotten
I say vtubers took over
Since i consider my taste in music meh at best
Im not into vocaloids
I haven't seen miku for some time
<:ElsaSick:689395768754569359>
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
So i guess it is what it is
tho thx to some LN titles anything with a long name could be a LN to me
i was thinking the manga would have been the source
a LN
huh

Last time i checked
No I think its still in pre register phase
Wasn't that mobile game a sequel to the anime
<:ElsaSick:689395768754569359>
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
wait the ova was 2017
since it did get ovas before the anime
unless you are thinking about the ovas
and honestly i felt a bit lost with the anime
i think that anime was in 2016 if i remember right
And since the manga is going to finish soon
So its better to hold off on reading it for a while
Thing is i feel like i may enter burn out
I guess ill read uq holders at some point
And damn it the last chapters hit me right in the feels
I read all of negima
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
if they screen anime movies often here
i would go to the cinema more
i would only go to see a movie once
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
its kinda scary looking at the money the demon slayer movie made
<:TriplePeek:689568598938615939>
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064> <:Ver:704169051391524875>
I sometimes can't spot her
Kugimiya has range
His easy to spot for me
Sugita to me doesn't sound like he changes his voice much
Kawasumi Ayako
Mel do you know who also suffers from being known for only one character
His voice is fitting for a bad guy
I forget destiny exists
I know takehito was in at least 3 gundam series
You can kinda blame jojo for it
His easy to spot
And nero from dmc
Yeah
Since they did some cast replaces with im assuming most of the old cast for the anime returning
Tho that may become the default voice for yo whenever i think of jp dub for shaman king
When she doesn't sound like a kid
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~ll~~
There was a topic
Yes
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
~~anyways lets not get off rails too much or the hammer is falling down~~
I think he just fits iron man too well
Despite him being in other films
He kinda end it up being remembered for only one role
I can't keep up with any va
Lets not enter that debate
Ok
Ok
A bomb is about to go off
*walks out the room*
Cyphers brain is full of index
I may need to find more manga to read at this point
But i realize trying to read long running manga could make me burn out
I start it enjoying reading manga now days
I think people know him more for one punch man this days
Since they used to play American football
Maybe i should recommend eyeshield to my brothers
Still man has godlike artstyle
senran kagura anime seem to like crossing lines with fan service
Seems like a good way to thank the reader
Wait d gray man author is going through the same thing
Am almost read all for it
Yeah it sucks
Idk if i have a guilty pleasure anime well manga i have to start looking for more to see if i can find anything
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
since redo of the healer is a thing
sometimes i question whats borderline in japan with anime
i cant say much on the topic but depending how much was shown it could borderline H
ill most likely never bother with the animes for SRK
even that splatoon one
i know most of the games are on steam
if you ask me
i would play the main line games then the gacha
i played that during the fate collab and then stopped after it
the mobile game?
i know of the series
tho i never played the games
We don't speak of the live action one
What is there for fma at this point
New project
It hit me right where it hurts
Uq holders god damn it
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
They could have given simon a character but oh well
Cuz if i remember my castlevania lore right richter wouldn't be born for many years when theres still simon
For a min there i was asking what
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
And i feel like a war is about to start
I see one piece at top 1
This is just shit show
🤣
Welp looks like ikxis brain is down for the count
Lol
Lol
So i read all of uq holders and all can say right now is holy shit im thankful its ending in 9 chapters cuz i felt burned out during the last arc of negima and im getting the same feeling with uq as well
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
But i never understand why it was made part of the bleach universe
It felt like a stand alone series
<@87512939107450880>
Oh ok
<@99695384296701952> out of curiosity do you keep up with uq holders
Sail the seas
or as one of my friends would say localized dub
i watched it in serbian dub
i cant remember the last ep i stopped on
i havent seen it in years
they used to do that for some anime
it seems like they keeped the jp ost
nope
*goes to yt*
or they did they keep the jp ost
did the dub have a eng op and ending
i still remember the ending song
yes
that was that anime
ohh the childhood
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-06-17/yui-horie-performs-new-shaman-king-anime-2nd-ending-theme-song/.174092
since im more willing to do it now days
i may read the manga
Ok
Oh
A/z?
<@87512939107450880> accel world
Let me get cypher in here
Aldnoah zero i never watched but darling in the franxx hoo boy that mess
Space battleship yamato doesn't strike me as a fanservice show
Most characters were dumpster fires
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Better then seeds
Ibo was my entry into the series
I never get into that
I know
I need to watch more of turn a gundam
and thats why people keep memeing tanya
i only seen one
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
yeah the story just kinda all over the place
so cant speak on that subject
but i dont have a opinion on it
i heard someone calling AGE one of the worst gundams they watched
But still i was fine with how it ended
I know it was a dumpster fire
I think im speaking from bais here but s2 of ibo i was fine with
So this is idol hell
<:TriplePeek:689568598938615939>
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
<:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>
shes a good girl
if i remember right chiho is the co worker
I could rewatch it
Have a great time
Devil is a part timer im assuming is the anime
That's how it goes
when virtual idols look too anime
thats a vtuber
idk who that is i dont play azur lane much
they always have every ship girl in all shaps and sizes
azur lane
besides spiders cgi
so whats currently the hot topic with anime this days
its joke
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:HibikiShock:726645026725167114>
in most cases
wikis are your best bets
yeah
i havent seen season 2 yet
op and the ending are good
sister iris is her name
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
but i didnt skip it
when i first saw that i had to ask someone wtf did i just watched
and some i say are ok or meh
there a lot of fanservice anime i watched
the mc in fire force mainly uses fire feet
nah
i wouldnt say its dxd lvls
i know the girl that always ends up being butt of fanservice jokes is voiced by ai yuuki
tho i havent fully watched it
well fire force seems to throw fanservice at fights
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Im sorry what
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
i was thinking yt
oh
copyright now days is a bit messy
there arent a anime studio
so nothing new
huh
when i read kako i think of kakao
and i i really enjoy it
but i watched baccano first
durarara is a great time
mb mel
database seven deadly sins and RAISE YOUR FLAG
i love 3 songs from mwam
DATABASE DATABASE DATABASE
also i plan on reading chainsaw man
i cant wait for more eps
i need to watch it
*as a fellow manga reader*
and i agree with cypher
to follow
so it maybe a little hard
gintama has a lot of movies and anime
*looks at my empty wallet*
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
play the games
sengoku basara
<:KirikaGlee:698939825927094384>
HELL YES
<:TriplePeek:689568598938615939>
good day
but i need to watch the sinbad anime before then
i may need to read it
i remember she was a bit of a cry baby
i was thinking of her
yeah
or am i mixing people now
||was she the girl that was going to marry alibaba but alibaba didnt want to do that||
its been so long i forget some characters
🥴
if it even happened
talk about a time skip
dang
of those 2
sorry but i just remember that scene in the anime
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
PFFT
i dont mind few spoilers
nah
~~cuz she is best waifus~~
not going to argue about that
i have yet to watch simbad
i love the anime
but i didnt want to start collecting it cuz i want to start with vol 1 to the last vol
i saw magi on shelfs in a book store
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
madoka is a magical anime
yup
i dont follow vtubers that much
that idk
the one you sent
amelia is the name of the vtuber
that is a different one
no
thats a vtuber
i really need to read more of this
now i remember
OOOOHHHH
need a refresher
I think its on yt
There was that chibi gfl anime
In japan its called dolls frontline
https://youtu.be/Bx5y9iwblpA <@297554276539170826> <@161155855524298752>
Well it was hyped
Yup
Chainsaw man looking good
Nice Nice
Cypher
Need to get pics
Samus is mostly in her suit
You can't escape it
Ok maybe I should have said a grown woman
Other is a high schooler
One is a adult
How
And smash bros
I know samus has a voice in other m
I didn't hear about a metroid anime
I heard about that
<:HibikiMonch:688190074646691843>
i agree with this one
i think we should put a full stop on this
ok
medic
the more i see this debits the more i start laughing harder
like a child argument
cuz this is just going back and foward
Oof
God bless the author
16 years
Funny enough they also did it for spiderman and golden kamuy
Im starting to wonder if the author is alright
The limbo
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
But still no season 2
Its funny how ngnl overshadowed another series
Lol
Its a spin off
I watched that one
Oh i can hear the tears from here
You siscon
Stb keeps getting ovas
Cuz i dont want more waifu wars
No nisekoi could stay how it is
Tho i guess at this point I wouldnt be surprised if we get season 2s for anime that have been kinda forgetten
Tbh
Mondaiji just had a better cast
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
At what vol did the anime stop at for ngnl
I myself can't tell the difference
Since i like cypher talking
Im interested
Well people ain't payed enough for this stuff
And so i can watch season 3 and be done with it
I need to watch season 2 again
Its in people's blood
Can't
Really?
Ill bring up Shakugan no shana
Ok
It just feels faster to me
And so far im not noticing too many changes
Since i havent read it
Idk how accurate it is to the manga
Least time i checked
Shaman king is going to have 53 or 54 eps
And i was thinking reading 3 manga vols was a bit messy
Since i feel like i dont have enough anime in my head i could talk about
Tho im not sure what else to talk about
Well fair enough
Wtf was that
Ok
God damn it
Cuz i havent seen season 3 yet
Is it spoilers
Since i felt that way about goh
I can understand
Oof
Yup
Incest
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Ikki tousen
i like gridmans op a lot
when finish gridman ill watch dynazenon
i remember stopping close to the end
i still need to finish gridman
The last fight was good
Well i forget somethings about gridman but i say the ending was alright
Somehow i forget i was at the last ep
And i watched first ep of dynazenon
So i only had one ep of gridman left and finished it
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
When ll still sells
Since i doubt they would go full on reboot
I would assume no
*can't get out the assassins creed memes out of my head*
And a loli ver
tho anime is going to run for 53 or 54 eps
in the anime so far
even tho she was only shown once
Only time i did it when a friend get me a free crunchyroll sub
Doesn't stop them from being added
Still
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Doesn't stop the gachas tho
Watched the kaguya ova and i love this
Konosuba to me was alright
And spicy<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
And it was good
I haven't seem flip flappers but i watched princess principal
lol when i think cristina vee i think noel and few other anime girls she voiced
Darkness was great
I had the blazblue anime on my mind for a while so ill check it out
When there other romcoms
Idk if i would compare it to toradora
Tho i tried to watch some anime i havent finished and i was only able to watch one ep of horimiya before i went <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
On it
The fandom memed a little too hard
Yeah
chad lvls beyond 9000
XD
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
i could watch the H anime
the middle one im ok with
dont remind me the last one exists
god damn it cypher
didnt watch that
refresh my mind
forget
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
now you are in the deep shit
yeah
Lol
Short answer:no
thats most LNs right now
dont do it to the poor guy
solo no
but the anime wasnt doing it any favors
idk about the manga
as expected shit hits the fan real quick when it comes to the girls
doesnt the mahouka side story have 2 eps right now
lol
it cant even be argued
cuz people find part 1 boring
huh
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
hey there tsubaki
by far my fav part of jojo
and end it up loving it
but i keep watching
part 4 i also kinda stopped watching
thats why i stopped watching it for a while
part 3 the anime at least felt like it was dragging on
but i say it ageded in terms of how it was writen
3 i can understand
since i watched up to part 5
i need to read it
i was wondering when it was going to end
👀
ft most filler arcs didnt really feel underwhelming
kinda hard when you dont know whats filler
ah
hell i even see it in book stores where they sell manga
and i heard it from some people the manga is good
world trigger is something ignored
idk what turned me off by that show
and i dropped it
i remember watched like few eps of it
ah
im kinda confused on what horizon are we talking about
when part 7 drops thats where the heat will really rise
*exits the room*
or have put on hold
idk how many i dropped
in anime
that happens a lot
since i do have the one collection on steam on my wishlist
.hack well idk if ill watch the anime
i havent seen season 3 yet
cuz of what i been hearing about what happened in the manga
i didnt even watch the last season
lol
one anime where my mind remembers being shit and leaving a bad taste was the 2005 negima anime
tho was there a anime where a filler or a anime only ending left a bad taste in your mouth
spirit arc was sleep
oh man we talking soul eater now
pfft
relax
so i see index talk while i was just destroy people in league
at least she is a adult
lol
lol shes hot
i like the one scene where they just scream fuck
ah heavy object that one seems funny
i heard the author is quitting after he finishes fire force
cypher im a bit dissapointed
ok
ok
had a good op and ending
but i just cant keep going
i tried to watch vrains
dubs really questionable
banger ops
ahh the 4kids era
i only liked the first op of gx
<@!175076569868402688> the dub or the sweet sub
with every new anime the rules just become a mess
zexal was one of the weaker animes
im interested in vanguard
idk anyone who plays magic vanguard or force of will here
a game where konami just milks people for every new deck that comes out
you asking for balance in yugioh
well guess we are turning into a music debit now
pfft
first i ever heard of that
urobuchi?
XD
i guess i could give it a shot
huh this the 2nd time i heard of tatami galaxy
slime i been kinda on and off about it
XD
well not like thats a bad thing
coming from someone whos brain is loaded with index novels
ill never tell
maybe or maybe not
XD
classic cypher
XD
The show just doesn't peak my interest
I still wouldn't watch it tbh
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
https://youtu.be/YXQ7tsUb1Qs
i do knows fmp has meches
forget fmp exists sometimes
i was thinking fma
XD
fmp
XD
cuz it is a good harem anime
i really need to watch more
and seto no hanayome
and be done with it
but i should really finish it
season 2 is where im stuck on
and man do i feel like some of them show there age clearly
i tried to get watch some 2000s anime
i expect as much
well consider the anime was like 2000s or 2010s
since i saw vols of it in bookstores
but im still unsure about
thats one series i want to watch or read
dude
i think my brain has been stuck in the shonen realm
ptsd do be hitting hard
lol i used to watch that
i just noticed keroro gunsou
she is a force to be reckon with
||is she evolving||
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
to see where its heading
but i may check out the manga
but i never seen those so i cant speak much
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
i also know the studio that worked on the anime also made some nsfw stuff
and how the ending just ended on a weird note
and i mostly remember how brutal it was
i did watch it
also about elfen lied
fuck the endless eight or whatever is it called
if im going to watch it
i wouldnt be surprised
tho would you believe i never watched haruhi
but i do know some of those names
thats a lot
someone always finds a way
cypher would you find if funny if someone mistook fmp for muv luv
i wouldnt be surprised if FMP was a VN
funny enough
its copyrighted in my country
great
given my bias for some anime
tho in fairness i would prob be worst
with some anime
seems like you are too much generous
lots of 8s and 9s
is that what anime you scored
a program that keeps track of what you watched
no
oh right forget about nobu
how the times have changed
so only when she reprises her roles is where we get to hear it
tho now im wondering has rie even get a new tsundere roles
of tsunderes
i still need to watch more of it
i that one
omg
then maybe i didnt watch the movie
oh
i did watch this but i forget what season i stopped on
i still need to watch it
trigun
lol
the manga or the anime
and i remember the main girl reminded me of taiga
i watched this
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
after how many years then watching anything is not that hard
if people can still watch eva
i knew eye shield was coming
that op is a banger
but not really interested in that one
vampire knight i also heard about
witchblade i heard about
That's what i just said
Is where the girls kiss one another
I only know this one from one scene
https://youtu.be/Xnx_ec6UKlM
bad anime
my fav manga
https://youtu.be/lm0P_i1sQfE
im getting seeds flashbacks
heroic age when i look at the artsyle
So kek
Its based on the games
Yes classic
what
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
but im not really interested in reading it
i see the manga for it in some book stores here
i need to watch stand alone complex at some point since only thing i seen from ghost in the shell was the first movie
But mononoke will always be stuck in my head
Later on i did watch other ghibli films
For me only anime film i remember watching mostly was princess mononoke
When we watched the movie
This was i think 2 or 3 years ago
And i had a bit of a hard time keeping up with the subtitles
I watched the movie with my brother
that counter is going up
<:KirikaFish:717138469381734471>
make me
so sleep
i only watched up to sunshine
when it comes to LL
*me who still needs to get into idolmaster*
idol talk
so what have i opened this door to
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<@!87512939107450880> i forget to mention this yesterday but my brother has been watching gate

make me
im already stuck in league hell

yes
with enough focus on something else
not coming back
i already been in that idol hole
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
keijo was a fun watch
thats a name i forget about till now
hand shakers
pfft

<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Ill read index
If i enjoy it
~~dxd~~
Ahm
Cypher so i decided to read a LN
Kek
I seen more boring isekai
Trust me
I watched that one
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
~~tho i only use twitter for art~~
cant even deny it
we going there
oh
other just chills
well one of them
and the 2 dudes just suffering
where the friend group is mostly simps
(yes)
still we get SAOA out of it
thats why its my fav arc
golden indeed

well when it comes to smgs
p90 is one of my fav guns in CS
you
YES
i loved  LLENN
i really wished there was another season for that one

cuz thats another LN i want it to read
cypher have you read SAOAGGO
M.i.a
Unless translation hit a wall
Still worth reading the novels
And then maybe pick up the novel
Nobuna i need to finish
unless its the poor bastards in the first ep
so there a lot of legal ways and loopholes
well it is WW2
i was expecting a room full of blood
when she was taking that pic and she looked like she was about to snap
i watched 1 or 2 eps of that
havent fully watched it
yet
i dont see the military propaganda part
||tbf modern weapons do hit hard||
and i was surprised
my brother watched that one
lol
🤔
who loves guns
thing is ggo alt was done by a different writer
cypher you really out here calling that piece of wheels best
KEK
you get those
oh right
if i remember right accel world asterisk war and few others
im pretty sure you did
not sure about that one chief
*looks at the novels*
tbf
or maybe later on
i think i learned what isekai was when i watched sao
but.....
cuz its still remembered well
it does fit isekai
fair enough
ZnT?
you me poor VAs that voiced him
old school i see
they fear her
*goes back to reading*
and it looked interesting
i just saw it in a book store
wait really?
the art looks good

funny enough theres a ultraman manga i could buy
gridman give me a lot of ultraman vibes when i watched it
ep1 set things nicely

and make me
shot me with gundams
i only watched ep 1 of dynazenon
that is the dude from gridman
yes
next movie is just a reboot
and i didnt miss out on a lot
i just watched Alicization without seeing the movie
i havent seen it
oof
thanks reki
that was a movie that became cannon
unless its sao abridged
ALO to me is kinda forgetful arc
cuz i liked it
i binged sao
i see a lot of classics
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
gg
LL to nova is the force
i remember that one
the girls do have different hair color
kinda makes sense
all i remember is the mc always was able to steal some girls underwear
i only seen clips of that anime
imho
still better then IS
<:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>

cypher
yup
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
cuz it baits you real hard to play the gacha
i still think is a good harem anime
cypher loves that one
<:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246>
classic
till the end
i can see why some people dont like the 2nd half since i had mixed feelings about it
i havent seen the movies
but its been years since i last watched it
i still think its good
I saw that clip
To me it was ok at best
Oh boy fusion

Well there's also fusion
But i think ill forever have a bias for wargraymon
That does look cool
The concept of punching a digimon to digivolve was kinda weird to me
Data squad i havent watched much of
I heard that one
The one ver of butterfly i would play anytime
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
And i love it to this day
They keeped the jp ost
I have a soft spot adventures
I enjoyed frontier more then tamers
I thought tamers was one of the weaker series
Nah
At this point idk what direction there going with digimon anymore
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Tho there isn't much thats coming out that interests me
So anyways on to the next anime topic
Lol
I want to play those 2 games
Fair point
I loved the idea
Frontier was really good
That idk much about
Her hair changes a lot
Maybe i think that cuz of mimi
Doesn't tri kinda disregard the ending
I dont see the problem with it
The ending was alright
I though 2nd season of adventure was good
Wait really
Tho thinking about it frontier had a lot of cool digimon designs
And it was pretty nice to seem all again
So i guess theres something im interested in
Jujutsu kaisen is also getting a movie this year
I haven't seen it yet
Ufotable just needs to adapt everything they can at this point
The manga is finished
Yes
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
*me reading manga and LNs*
To me i feel like the series peeked at 2
Since season 2
I just don't have much care for it
Idk if ill pick up mha again
*me sees the flag*
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Funmation really hates the eu
At this point
There will most likely be another movie
Unless the manga is nearing its end
There is but by the time the new season comes there will be more
And the more we don't get some info on the more i think its going to cover the mangas current arc
And theres also the pain of waiting for the news about the black clover movie
At least the ones before the hiatus the author took
Even tho i read the manga to the latest chapters
But i just kinda forget about
Vigilante is one series i could read
yup
and the ova
i seen this one

just read all the VNs
But i wasn't too sure about it
I want it to say macross
So who is ready for hell
https://youtu.be/qeBlL3GrAkY
But i would need to watch the series and the movie before doing that
I feel tempted to click on it
Tho that video pops up on my feed for some reason
That was by someone else i think
Just alright to me
It wasn't bad
I seen few eps
I heard the manga for ex arm is cancelled
I was thinking of g gundam
Lol
So idk how chunky the mechs were
Its been sometime since i seen seed
Maybe cuz the mobile suits are 
good
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Before sony bought them
Tho i remember funi had a partnership or something with aniplex
Since funi is just funi
Its more so sony that you need to worry about
More sites like it will pop up
And lost
Funi tried
Compare to crunchyroll
I do hear funis website is crap
Well i been on pirate site for years so idk what legal site is there
Did someone take the copyright for funmation in the eu or something
Still cocking eu
Classic funi
https://tenor.com/view/friday-drink-anime-drunk-girls-und-panzer-gif-11846752
Welp
Welp im not talking about that shit
At this point legends is a dream
Loris pls
And i think the anime covered up to bnw 6 i think
I say sorta cuz i havent played all the battle network games
For a anime i can sorta agree
Tho star force were more short eps
Battle network and star force get there own animes
Cypher said this but i would love a megaman zero anime
Mash is not holding back with giving lancelot a ticket to heaven
Mayo chiki
Yeah
I never noticed that reference
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
>hand holding
>censorship
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
If they keep going then the work could be ruined
I been reading manga more now days
I haven't watched much anime
I heard the manga was better
And i liked some parts of it just the whole 2 seasons of it felt slow at points
But just decided let me try again
I dropped jojo after part 3 cuz of how slow it felt
I did with few
Oreimo idk if ill even pick back up
Cuz the mc just annoyed me
I dropped it
That's the trigger word
Citrus
just wait till he starts another one
I may need to update my anilist
God damn it
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Now theres a valid reason to remove fmab off first place ranking on mal
since only thing i remember from it is the op
i forget about knights & magic
but the ending i found to be good
i think it counts as mecha
Fair enough
about pirating
people been saying that for years
i know
funi i cant even speak on
or something like that
isnt it a flash player
but idk if ill watch it
it looks cool
And we all know how that's going to end
So im hearing the gintama movie just took fmab spot on mals rankings
The derp brain
Lol
So more power point
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
but i know what they were talking about
it took me a sec
jesus christ
the song costs that much
And then mal had to shut itself down for a bit
All thanks to one youtuber
Yes
They were out
As soon as it hit rank 1
need to pick up the LN again
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
yes culture time
i think in the anime theres a parady of konosuba in it
from what i heard
its one of his early works
when the memes burned people out
of just watching anime and not reading the manga
but back then i was still in the anime phase
tho i even get bored in the manga
since it peaked at s2 for me
same
I found out yesterday online the bookstore has been selling manga get a lot of new ones
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<:ShiraBean:736607747834904667>
5 more to go

people point fingers at netflix
people have been hyping up chainsaw man
since a lot of hyped up anime are somewhere around that time
or 2022 could take the spot
i was losing my shit in league
dying in league and apex
fruits basket and odd taxi may watch at some point
its just that not a lot of it interested me
not saying there werent many good series
could be mistaking
i think on CR twitter said a-1
for me its kinda been weak for the past year or so
mb
i was thinking we were still on the konosuba topic
ahh
hoo boy
and since a1 is doing the next season
the quality will shift a lot
with different studios working on the anime
Oh it will
Could be worst
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
And already entering hentai territory again
World ends harem pv is out
Sooo
Whats so shit about love hina anyways
I never even watched or read love hina
Only manga i ever read that i consider niche would be negima
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Dont see too much of a problem here
And i may need to use that at some point
That i watched
And on his birthday i kinda tortured him with the star wars visions trailer
Since i have a friend who doesn't like anime
Can i still use corpse party for betting or you have some other ones I could use
Fair enough
But if i really want to torture myself I think higarashi is on my list
I think someone forcing me to watch redo of the healer would be torture enough
It was just a mess for me
Not to say it was bad
I never finished happy sugar life
With how the LN for devil is a part timer end it well people are asking for a anime only ending
Devil is a part timer is getting a s2 after many years
Well controversy get it that far
Shield hero was alright
<:KirikaMunch:672599382670966785>
Happy birthday
And it did start getting good
A friend made me watch bc again
And love it
Im up to date on both
Welp after sao is done I wonder if there's a chances accel world may get another anime
So anime is not coming out for a long time
And what's the progress on the LN
After that ending
But dang i want it to see more
Yup
Its going to be interesting
And wait for progressive to come out
Now i need to watch ordinal scale
It was interesting
But the fights were good
Yeah
Just me
I kinda felt bored by it
I liked alicization and wotu to me wasn't hitting the same notes
Tho the only shonens i been keeping up with were black clover and edens zero
By the time they are at alabasta most of the gang is together
With the anime i get as far as the alabasta arc
Maybe if its close to the end
Idk if would be able read one piece with how long it has been on going
God bless your soul
<@87512939107450880> i finished sao alicization war of the underworld and i say it was alright
The anime changes artstyles every season
Rebecca already looks different from lucy in some areas
Early manga chapters do screem one piece
Yeah
I could read it
I think so
Tho theres still 100 year quest
But it didn't need to go on longer
The ending was alright
Are the characters from the arc mentioned in the manga
Cuz mashima said so
Key arc is canon
Unless its the anitube community
And forget rave master exists
But people love to shit on it
Had its problems
Ft wasn't all bad
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
Best character
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Jc staff
Sadge
But the second season could turn you off from it
I say ibo can be a starting point
Berserker girls
Yeah but shield hero wasn't in controversy cuz of those themes
Ok for tv
Interspecies reviewer wasn't that bad
I think there some cases that happened
Since its a dead topic now days
Tho i think we shouldn't get into that
Yeah
hf
lol
this why we cant have nice things
i just feel like zero connects more with HF
tho funny enough watching fate zero before HF feels sorta right
same order as me
since i think thats the one LN where some of the scrapped ideas for FSN VN went to
im interested in reading stranger fake
where okita is the servent of the MC
type redline is the nobu one right?
since theres also stranger fake
fair enough
ahhh
wait fate apocrypha never finished?
but even she couldnt make watch all of that
i love jeanne
only fate series i havent really finished or dropped was fate apocrypha
but i think i just didnt care enough
i was going do the same thing
i think i was close to watching it
that one i managed to avoid
no
i didnt watch fate zero till UBW
i start with 2006 fsn
was it ||the lolis||
for more manga to come at the i go to bookstore
i had to wait 3 or 4 months
rest is manga
but didnt remember there names
i think there were 2 more
only LNs i saw at a bookstore was how to not summon a demon lord and the smartphone isekai
since i do want to see the early works of type moon
i would read the og VN anyways out of curiosity
i cant pin point anyother spoiler
yes
||more so what happens to sakura||
really zero spoils HF and maybe UBW
this fits too well
https://tenor.com/view/kekw-kek-bttv-twitch-emote-gif-15123134
PFFT
but nasu needs that big tv
~~well i know the remake can be emulated~~
out of curiosity
is the original VN of tsukihime still worth a read
i can see that happening tbh
KEK
i just wonder if nasu has anything else he can think of for a VN
cypher i knew you would say that
XD
just wait till tsukihime
yeah but fgo goes maximum overdrive
waifus
and to add another bit
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
I stand by this
From it
I mostly remember fan service
The VN
Was the game the one for the vita
Tho for me im limited in my LN choices for what i can buy from the bookstore here
Well you do own vols of the LN
Both have there qualities
Im not arguing over that
Oi
Cuz it aired at the same time as rezero
When it isekai boom started
Tho i think asterisk war s2 was the last battle haram
Ending is a banger too
Tho i kinda miss the 2000s era of anime
Already been done
I remember liking his war for cybertron ver a lot
Tho in more recent cartoons his mute
Tho is it weird among the decepticon i liked soundwave the most
Since in war he was nowhere to be seen
Not too sure on that
Tho i think he was a multi-player character in the games
War or fall of cybertron
I think he was in one of the games
At least the ones i watched
Yeah i forget he exists cuz he wasn't in many cartoons
Ahhh
I think soundwave for some reason
I forget who shockwave is
Tho idk when they dropped gun transformations
I think the laser pistol is Megatron
Well transformers was made in japan if i remember right
We really going there now
And somehow the news was avoided
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
It was confirmed one piece was getting a live action
It is
Thats what a lot of people were thinking
Badass anime screams may i add
The man of screams
Add rin and may turn into foursome
Cuz how many times are they going to change studios or staff
I need to take a shot
https://youtu.be/ecNcN5CFYBU
I was thinking she was a better berserker
Hmmm
https://youtu.be/u1Q50htZ3l0
And tsukihime was pretty much done dirty
But again i never played the VNs only seen the animes for both
I see it now
Fair enough
And maybe thats still stuck in my head
I only watched the animes
I never thought of ciel as a saber face
Saber face finding its way into tsukihime
Not what people call her
But that's her normal or alter ver
Yeah she has almost every class under hear belt
There she's a Servent but a caster
Well if you don't count fgo
That's cuz illya isn't a servent
You can thank merlin for that one
Hold the phone
https://youtu.be/TXHTsjrIHdo <@238855496797257729>
Let me see if i can find a video of the nps
Have you seen NPs and costumes
CCC never had a chance in hell to be released without it being censored to hell
I was thinking last encore was going to just be a fate extra adaption but it clearly wasn't going there with the first ep
I didn't fully watch it
Hell if i know
Most likely never
Right after writing fgo and tsukihime remake
Good luck taking that away from Deens hands
That man wants a remake of the fate route
Well HF didn't come out by the time I watch fate
But i said fuck it ill watch zero last since im enjoying ubw
Funny how i didn't look up if theres any watch order after i watched fsn 2006 and s1 of ubw
Before i get into fate
I never was spoiled on who the servents were
and i know the anime
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
HAHAHAHAHA
cuz my head was in a wtf stat for a good few mins
also the ending kinda confused
||i did notice near the ending shirou was slowing losing his memory||
that i would need to read the whole vn
but there had to some cuts
oh i noticed illya did play a big role in it
i was asking myself how much cut content was removed from this piece of work
and it was pretty good
so i just watched the last heavens feel movie
i havent watched or read it so cant say
i have no counter point for that one
i bet he is
maybe i should give it a watch
besides some clips
never really seen the anime
i know of the series
as soon as i saw the elf i knew it was one of the tenchi muyo anime
and correct me if im wrong but doesnt idolmaster predate love live by few years
i cant really compare umi to tsubasa
tho i cant help but see basa in her
sounds like a normal life
<:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
are your windows active
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
Nice
May i say i consider it better then LL
And lets just say i was having fun watching few eps
I been watching idolmaster for 2 days already
*goes back to watching anime*
Tho there are a good option if you want to keep them in cases the pirate sites go down
I on the other had have been using pirate sites never bothered with torrents
Since he makes 3d models
Tho idk what he has then just anime and manga
That's what i tell my brother when i look at his hdds
That has always been a issue
how rich
he needs that ego boost
not wrong
bloody hell
among the gundams i watched
yeah seed is a laser show
besides bulider cuz that is its own series
all gundam anime in a nutshell
Well whos the funny person now
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
yeah im using it right now
mainly depends who is selling the best
throw me back to battle school era
we are already over run by them
we all are
i argue they happened more often during the mid 2010s
i havent seen both of those series so i cant comment
<:HibikiMonch:688190074646691843>
mind if i take some popcorn
millhi
people consider it a isekai
well lets not forget about .hack
wouldnt that kinda apply to sao as well
on what is isekai and and what is just games
here we go with the arguments over it
Who's ff is that
🤔
Sony doesn't bother checking that stuff its there own problem
Right
Question is will there players get any better
Now i want to watch slime again
no u
But i remember watching shaman king sonic x and few other anime that were on it
I didn't have jetix on tv when we moved out
It was my childhood
Ikxi you also watched jetix?
Tho ill miss it
Tho im not surprised it happened since it could have happened sooner or later
I know the artstyle change was weird
R34 where you at
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
This can go wrong in so many ways
Ummm
Well we are getting a movie so i guess we aren't seeing sao for a while
Progressive is still on going?
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
And i already know its coming to hentai sites another one for there collection
And i had many questions
I saw the manga in a bookstore
Yup
I know theres the eng dub for it fully on yt
I think here it was fully dubbed
I do know people who worked on code lyoko worked on space dandy
Tho French does love its anime
Tho now that i think about it had a lot of anime moments
Same
Get to give it credit it had a good run
I remember the show getting weird at points
I only watched the series never touched the games
But never saw his model
I think he did
It was great
Another classic i remember well
It is a classic
https://youtu.be/MRkXCxaz1b8
Ah theres also ATOM
How many years have passed its hard to believe
Man im getting nostalgia
Classic
It was dumb as hell
I remember yin yang yo
And operation overdrive
Mystic force i think it was called
Along with power rangers
Yeah i remember it aired a lot when i had jetix again on tv
I may have watched that one i forget
I remember non anime on jetix a lot more
YES
I don't remember eureka seven being there
I remember xana spawned there own monsters irl
Since i was losing interest in tv
But didn't watch much of it
I think in evolution he had a roll in it
On the kids side
Only 3 characters were taken over
He was a bad guy for a lot of seasons
And was willing to do anything to get out
Xana want it out
Who needs words when you can be a ai and weird black cloud
And get himself into shit
Yeah he was annoying
Odd
In serbia i think it was dubbed
Since it was a French cartoon
Yes
Tho i think code lyoko was CN
We went from jetix to code lyoko
Yumi
Or just in a love triangle
And also Ulrich was kinda of a harem protagonist
But idk if it happens some other time
I remember it was in class
And sent to principals office
Jeremy get a kiss
I remember when xana controlled her irl
She did recover some of her memories
That was stuck in that world for years
Hey she is a real person
To even program a bunch of weapons
He would need to be away from school for a good amount of time
Coding takes time
And was acting like a dog
I remember he tried to put his pants down
I somehow do
I remember the ep where odd was fused with his dog
She was cute
Also on the topic of BNW i liked woodmans users
I did as well
Where lann was voiced by a older va
But i mostly get later seasons
I watched that one on yt
God its hard to believe how long has it been since i seen any of this shows
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
G.I. Joe sigma six tmnt 2003 (?) shaman king sonic x yu gi oh and tokyo mew mew
I can remember few anime and cartoons that 4kids worked on
Wasn't that one dubbed by 4kids as well
No i havent seen it
KEK
Where finding old shows makes you feel old
Welcome to my world
And how jetix was Disney's tonami
Tho it was interesting to find out what tonami was
Both 4kids anime
Since on jetix i saw shaman king and sonic x
I never watched it
Yeah best girl
The one with white hair?
First season fully
I watched that one
Cuz it was replacing one of the Disney channels
In America it seem to have been hated
Since jetix was big in eu and few other western regions
Unless it aired on jetix somewhere else
The rage of a awakened demon
Ahhh
Vivid strike is the one where the main girl just made a blood mess out her bullies
Lol
And its nice having manga on stand by and read it if you get into a argument about the series
I just want to collect series i enjoy
My current place for manga

We are talking about maybe a onetime read then its on the shelf for rest of its life as a collection
But a manga vol or omnibus costs less then most figures
Im already collecting manga
Tho for me its going to depend on the waifu
I want to get into collecting figures or status
nana mizuki overdrive
i think the stand start it few months back
Sure
Since i want to see that collection
<@238855496797257729> what manga do you have
*director at the his char laughing*
still need more of that drama
stromtroppers
or else jesus wouldnt live
kira had to stay the same
my head doesnt go to the ost right a way when i watch a anime
ost is so and soo
but damn does the dumb over shadow it in some cases
yeah it has some good aspects
ah yes those dumbasses
still has a lot of stuff to adapt
Almost cryed when it ended
Angel beats was a fun watch
I never knew tamako market existed
That series was pretty big for kyoani
No Haruhi?
Cuz it was all over the net
But i couldn't escape the ending
I haven't fully seen it
I think it could have been clannad
Idk what was my first kyoani
But it is a good show
I haven't fully watched it
Fair enough
Idk if its underrated if it had more seasons and a movie
I remember seeing rikka on yt a lot and few other places on the net
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Anything can happen in gundam
Then underrated
I feel like is kinda forgotten
The what now
And then the other eva movies
I still need to fully watch Eva tv then the end of eva
Nailed it
I assume the 2nd one is the shogi one
I know all 3
And always have guns ready to point at angel
I always remember them getting into dumb situations
Not really news to me
I was thinking angel beats was a anime original or a LN
Angel beats?
Along with aot
Angel beat was one of my first animes when i discovered what it was
https://tenor.com/view/gundam-mobile-suit-gundam-gif-5044348
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Csgo
Cypher throwing italian hands here
Nice one cypher
Lol you give black clover a 8
*puts on a helmet*
Here comes the war axes
My mind wants to read more chainsaw man
I could but
I haven't watched the movie
Nice
She was hot
Sato
I was about to say amagi brilliant park could be one of there known series but then i realized i barely hear anyone talk about it
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Here's my mess
https://anilist.co/user/FireZero2000/animelist
Also cypher
Cypher chill
Oh shit
At best
Sao s1 is a 7 or 8
My anilist is a waste land and need to update it
A 6 or a 5
So no need for me to take a piss again
Cuz i remember it still
Tho im skipping the filler arc
I still need to rewatch season 2 of sns
I meant as in i miss her tsundere voice
Not what i meant
Whenever i hear anyone character rie voiced i feel a bit sad
No
God damn it aya
I suffer every day aya
Since i ain't that easy to go and watch a old school anime
You are going to need force me to watch it
Since goh get fucked by crunchyroll
Nah i sleep on manhwa anime
It was fun
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
I also seen comic girls but never finished it
Dude i see you love your hentai a lot
Pfft
I expect old school
I haven't updated my mal in a while
Shaman king has her
If cypher beat me in bb i would have to watch a anime
You know what would be funny
https://tenor.com/view/kazuma-sato-konosuba-smile-smirk-anime-gif-16686762
japan holds no bars
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
that are good at making sexy noises
ask most jp VAs
sounds like you had a great time
i watched it and i loved the demon lord
i remember that one
https://tenor.com/view/culture-man-of-culture-cultured-gif-10903367
you son of a gun
only in hentai
only in hentai
I think more people would screw stella
Lol
but when it ended it just felt like it was kinda done
yeah shield hero pretty had a strong start
and the lightbolt broke
i need to get back on track with that anime
so this what i see accel world
and see if i find good translations
welp i think ill search for AW online
since im willing to give LNs a shot now days
about AW
tho tbf we would be talking in circles
now idk what topic we are on
so i missed accel world talk
well shiro would say other wise
not is
funny enough
it was beaten by ngnl
we know the execution is coming
cypher is going to kill me with this index memes i swear
XD
shes a mech
what about misaka
unlesss you dont have them on the go
so no really point
you own AW
and then die of index overload
i would like to be sucked into the world of LNs
sure go ahead
and thats when the turn off happens
i was thinking the LN was the main source
or whatever the source is
if it follows the manga
since the trend is if a anime is big enough give it a movie after 1 season
i think s3 could happen after the movie
She was one of kuros victims
I forget one of the girls in illya says that
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
~~say that to hentais~~
Since it ended
That's what i been hearing
since shiki ryougi does have those eyes
i think it is
both are busy fighting over shirou its kinda funny
x to doubt
they will be forever
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
we rob the whole building
i can hear opm fans going *great he can do more chapters now*
i can catch up
ahh it only has 24 eps for now
i need to catch up with shaman king
and psycho pass
well with how it turned out its no surprise
well talk about timing
unless its Apocrypha
i was kinda confused on what was happening in ep 1
ahhh
well you need to make some cuts for a movie
A new nep anime
is it the one with the toothbrush scene
here comes the trail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=759cgq6Hz04
the world is full of surprises
you mean the ones during a war
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
depends where you look
doujins exist for a reason
spoliers for reasons
||the girl he likes wants him to be a girl||
even watched the dub of it
i had a good time with it
thats as far as i can say since i dont want to spoil a lot of the anime
the mc transforms into a girl
best way i would describe it is sentai magical girl anime
Something is inside the tea and blood is coming
Let me guess
*fires a railgun*
i always see clips of blood lad
sadly the manga artist for the series passed away
flexs
tho it would be funny if kirito tried to cook haru
not kirito and haru
i meant as in cooking
*grabs 2 swords and a pig*
here comes the arguments
dengeki bunko ruling over LNs
and i havent fully watched of dengekis animes
oh the wonders of anime
XD
da what now
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
every girl would be wet
he would own the place
pfft
the poor guy
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
well she rocks them
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
a man of culture i see
since it was around ep 10 or 11
so i could pick it back up
i think i remember where i stopped with the accel world anime
cant get it out of my head not helping i hear bbcfs op everytime i do a astral
yup
i forget the op i only remember the ending
chase the world is accel world right?
but i could look for jp cover of the songs
well in eng
consider i heard covers of it
to me it wouldnt be weird
its just weird thats all
i dont dislike it
since they seem to be allover the place
idk if i like the colors that much
and the meme can now die
if its no longer on hiatus it can happen
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
so season 2 can happen now
It does look like one
From the looks of it
didnt the series end
they can still find a replacement
to accel world
from train wreck that was early sao
oh how long has reki come along with his writing
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
since the queen already has him
well not like she has a chance
i assume childhood friend
not surpised
if i remember right haru is a 2nd year
kek
well when did that stop writers from doing spicy stuff
Unless there adapting a popular mecha ip
Yeah
I say its watchable but the manga is just better
But i rewatched it and its aged
Yes
I loved 2006 ver
2005 to be more specific
Tho i said this many times already but i still hate negimas anime ending
Most of 2000s anime had anime only endings
Axz is kinda blank in my mind sometimes
I was confused on genders for some characters
Tho i to this day still remember how weird for me it was hearing the jp dub
But i don't remember the number so that's why i would rewatch it
I remember where the last ep i watched ended at
Never finished it i need to rewatch the whole series then get into FMAB
And i did like the original content for what it was
I often hear how people bash og fma
For me it depends on the anime
Im not surprised kaguya sama is reaching the final arc since there was going to be a end point sooner or later
and rules are made to be broken
kaiba has money
despite what changes it had to go through
tho people would still consider 5ds good
the timing could not be anymore perfect
well carly was character assassinated
i remember 2 girls being after his love
wait harem?
lol
yusei give up on his bike dream at the end
but akiza does duel on a motorcycle
tho i know them for few more anime now days
ok close enough
Pandora Hearts
let me check the name of the anime again
and maybe pandoras heart
i only know them as the studio that did to love ru
werent they bought out
i was about to say
sao idolmaster and many many more
and i know a1 pictures as the one with many anime under its belt
i know sunrise as the mecha studio
Gundam is what there mostly known for
Sunrise seems to run mecha series a lot
Other then that didn't see there other works
Or ultraman
A full on sentai anime
Gridman was good
When it comes to what trigger made
I say kill la kill was a good watch
he has good roles
his not that bad
After madoka every magical girl anime took something from it
Despite the fact they took one piece and messed it up
There whole point was to bring shows for child audiences
Cuz 4kids
Lol
https://tenor.com/view/im-out-gif-12505379
But the other 2
Idk about parallel paradise
<:CarolWhat:688191203040034831>
i think those can of worms can stay closed
Im now considered
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Yeah nut cases do be showing up
So irl stuff
Im not in the imas fandom and i still need to watch more eps of the anime
Wait what
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Well he is steve handjobs
That it wasn't a devours
Sounds like its right up her alley
Pls don't
*x to doubt*
Most likely adapting the anime
need to watch it
lol
oh
like miru thights
isnt that just a ova series
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
mb
forget to turn the ping off
oops
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
fighting games
too much FGs
dont have the drive
the more i see fena the more i want to watch it
my brain doesnt
~~even if reki said he made it canon and i question why do it~~
but alicization for the most part doesnt feel like you need to watch ordinal scale
didnt watch the movie yet
and i managed to finish it all in the end
2nd is where i felt a bit bored
with alicization the first half i enjoyed
at least the first half
s2 wasnt that bad
the one shot
if i remember right wasnt sao written in 2002
fair enough
i think the man knows well enough not to make the same mistakes he did with early sao
if that works out for him
he can still make a new series
i dont think he will give up on writing
so i wouldnt be surpised if he was set for life
well sao is one of the best selling LNs in japan
from just trying to fix the first arc to becoming a full on series
oh right progressive is still on going
after his bigger sellers are all finished
my question is what else can he write
or getting there
and i forget accel world is also near its final arc
sao is in its final arc
but for spoiler sakes ill keep my mouth shut
and i know what happened to him
well i spoiled myself a bit
turns into a sword then that was not enough to beat the boss
then just eugeo dies a pointless death
i think she was dying or took a blow
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
do i need to spoile people
honestly yuuki dying was just a waste
we can all dream of somethign
they are staying game only
nah
phillia was in the first sao game
or fatal bullet
ggo
and i knew people were going to use it as a excuse to shit on sao even more
i havent seen bofuri
everyone is different
in alicization
technology showed up early on
but they get trapped
wasnt log premise like .hacks
well bother start with being trapped in a game
i cant see him retire yet
and heres the LN master
Pfft
everyone is horny
it was black rock shooter
out all animes they picked
https://myanimelist.net/anime/5636/Restol__Teugsu_Gujo_Dae?q=Restol&cat=anime
https://myanimelist.net/anime/9106/Nogsaegjeoncha_Hamos?q=Green%20ch&cat=anime
And both were mecha anime
At least 2 of them
Tho i remember watching some korean anime
I never watched pizza cats it never aired for me
Well this is a surprise
wait really
i could rewatch rakudai
oh nononon
Cuz its where authors grow up there
A fair enough debate
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Well a dnd nerd can tell a good story
when you are spinning the same topic
with harem there isnt much you can talk about
we talking harem rage now
pfft
i dont have problems with most eng dubs
i think the channel that aired those dubs shutdown
yu gi oh had up to zexal
oh there were depending on what was airing
but now i can barely watch one
i loved them when i was a kid
well in fairness i kinda cringe at serbian dubs of some anime
they been doing this for 2 or more years
Mob?
or were not interested
JC staff picked up anime from studios that shut down
I can't take mothers basements opinions seriously
That is food debates and other topics that could spark a argument
I only watch trash taste for the shit shows
And only cuz of the dark elfs
I only seen the first ep
They were close to going neck at neck
Tho his content is alright
He is pretty much the tourist guide for people outside of Japan
And akidearst
misty chronexia
As far as i know
Gigguk and connor didn't know the guy
Some drama happened and that's about it
That was friends with joey
Another anituber
You mean the hentai man
I love some of those edits
Since Joey did already live in japan
Wouldn't that apply mostly to garnt and connor
There manager works for them so its no problem they be sponsored
Every book walker ad
Aren't LNs longer to release
I ping you for the sao topic
That's there only relation
Both are series based on books
Yes
Want to say to LoR fans
<@87512939107450880> *fires a lazer*
Let me get him here
I think cypher can say something on it
I can't say for sure
And yet its one of popular LNs in japan
I get it its a dumpster fire for you
Where i stopped taking him seriously is where he just keeped shitting on sao
But he seem to have dropped it
I liked whats in a op series
Welp fan subs it is
let people have there moment
Ikr
The manga currently ended in a battle
It does give the manga time for more stuff to add
So now i wonder if will need to wait a year for more
The director passed away
Its the same person who worked on death not
How is eden zeros ost
All hail the ft ost
i dont think its a japanese anime studio
whats the studio thats working on the anime
for the girls
GFL had a lot of artist
but the animation clearly isnt the best
they look alright
and depression
a lot of girls
yup
kancolle was years ago
only in dreams
looks like gachas are getting animes no problem
different staff
so trigger will have a hand
wait yostar themselves are doing the show
is going for 12 eps
if we are going by how AL was adapted
i dont expect it to be that good
who knows
i feel like 1 or 2 years have passed since it came out
could be wrong
at this point
tho isnt azur lane one year old
or shut down
there were other gachas that get a anime but most of them are unknown to me
was about to say
the anime came out before game
they like the manga
maybe i am a madman
<:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
cuz blades are coming
well you better start training soon
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
how is that training going
also
do i see some classics
oi cypher
when i hear the name
i turn my brain off
it can happen
blue exorsist took how many years for season 2
drifters i mean
where is that manga at
but im not getting my hopes up that much
so it could be
LNs are being worked on again
And that's about it
Next year in hyped for kaguya
Then try to watch it all
I think i just become a person that just waits for good stuff to finish airing
Some are getting a season 2 some will never get it most likely
I read few mangas that had a anime
Hell there sao mangas here
Then LNs
I see more mangas in my area
So half of where the LN is at
And the anime was based on the LN
Isn't that a manga panel
Well you can blame sao for being one of the kick starts
since jojo references a lot more
but mainly focused on metal and rock
pretty much the jojo of video games
god i can feel the music reference in that one
https://tenor.com/view/ky-kiske-guilty-gear-sol-badguy-gif-22069735
~~*half circle forward heavy slash*~~
or when times passes by fast
i guess it happens when you dont rewatch a anime
but some details are missing
i know the plot of each season
i kinda forget a lot of stuff in symphogear when i think about it
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
Here comes the flames of hell
Pretty much the point of thw reboot
Adapting the manga
I liked her
<@87512939107450880>
She can switch it up
Cyphers favorite
But i know her role as miyuki shiba
Now days she's know for being ayaka from genshin
Say that to hayami saori
They know how to change there tons
That's female VAs for you
Sunshine had some vas from the last season?
Last i checked songs stay Japanese
No
But its close
Titans aren't really zombies
I forget what chapter i stopped on
I don't think ill finish it
Cuz idk what was going on anymore
And well i stopped
I read the manga for scums wish
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
And its ntr yuri
It has a anime
Wait a min i know that one
Damn auto correct sometimes
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
interesting
huh
i guess its something i should read
interesting
hmmm
but idk whats even about
i see a lot about spy x family
will just have to wait and see who they get
For anime
Sounds like then dragging 90% of free lancers
nobuna throw that out the window
and battery doesnt seem to be dying anytime soon
has signal and internet
true
and being meh at best
i remember watching it
its that shit again
oh yes
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
so this shit i see
ahh
*opens the door*
that can update anlist for you when you watch anime on legal sites you can setup a pirate sites as well
a program
its shit
if fmab isnt on the top
how is training going
also cypher
*goes to grab some popcorn*
You know that can sorta be true
Why do i feel like shes a assassin
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
2 more to go
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>

well you going to be waiting a long time till a publisher is confirmed
first i hear the words
infamous
Isn't it just the poster stuff
didnt the live action movie come out
Well this sounds alright
But glad to hear matt mercer still playing jotaro
But only time i watched the dub was Part 1 and 2
Seeing this reactions is funny consider it was confirmed its getting s2 and s3
Well it was delayed
nux is going to have a good time
then again the 80s and 90s were a weird time
well that looks like a different take on f zero we know today
every nintendo ip has some sorta manga
ill say that much
nintendo manga based on there games really are something
well there not related
but then decided lets make a rap
its interesting how they planed for a dubbed ver of we are in eng in the 4kids dub
and we are had a dubbed ver
we are long pass the 4kids era
yeah i mean the other comment
cuz idk who you are talking about
do you mean the author?
It drags
The main issue with it
the whole place may break
everything
it was nice
i watched that havent finished it
the movie was not meant for the original anime
someone correct me if im wrong
since it is the adaptation of the manga fully i think
ultimate is going to be long
but watchable
not great
i say it was alright at best
since the original anime isnt held in high regard much
and it make me love tfs ver even more
i watched both the original anime and ultimate
tho i hope you ready for older stuff down the line
and jojo as a manga is older
well hellsing came out before those 2 even get a anime
and the wiki
i dont think mals list does it justice
he has a long ass list
trust me when i say this
ill admit that
kallen was a strong character
besides kallen and cc
i sorta forget about some characters
well back to code geass
but found out the reason why she was blind was interesting
i didnt find nunally that interesting
so it wouldnt clash with the animes ending
it was meant for the recap movies that changed stuff
Didn't funmation dub the series
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Last i checked the mc gets girls
Nah
Well accel world isnt something i would consider cute
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
it would be funny if they just rebooted accel world
or index
sao or accel world awakens him
and here is cypher
x to doubt
i would feel sad
if reki rewrites ggo
but i cant say for sure
i read bit of the manga
i think the movie added a anime only character that being asunas friend
of the first arc
its a reboot
im asking myself who made that call
but decide to just go to vol 22
the movie adapted somewhere the anime wasnt
i may watch it
oh sweet
but i still consider it good
there somethings in durarara i just remember not liking
but i liked baccano more
i found both good
since both durarara and baccano are written by the same author
i would recommend baccano
but i think tri kinda screwed with the s2 ending
sure we in season 2 we had returning cast members
digimon wasnt afraid to change its cast
Yeah
Ehh idk could be rights stuff
Yokai watch isn't even that big in the west
And the game digimon surviver is coming soon
I say digimon still has a decent enough following
Or special
And the gen2 protags having there own movie
Tho wasn't gen2 ash and friends
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
The games and the card game are different
loved the first season and the ova
oh im watching it for sure
Idk how well its going to do as a trilogy
Well unless its garden of sinner lvls of getting movies
You need more movies for it to work
Answer you dont
yes
And garden of sinners chilling
With type moon its always tsukihime or fate
Idk
The VN still hasn't be translated last i heard
Aka melty bloods top gal
Well i guess when it comes out ill forget about it
Now that's a old school anime
After alicization
But god knows whats going on in the next arc
I feel like his forget till alicization
Well jujitsu kaisen i stopped reading black clover and eden zero im still up to date
I think i was just busy with edens zero black clover and jujitsu kaisen
When the mc uses his power but other then that don't have much motivation to read it
I like the art
I still need to catch up with the manga
Chainsaw man
After getting underpayed
So is the series out of Netflix jail
Heard he may do a mecha series
Tbh idk if oda can even top himself after one piece
Idk when
Oda said he will finish one piece at some point
And the anime just didn't do it favours for the start
But i follow black clover
I think thats a something most mangas wish they could do
Tho one piece could change my mind
And im kinda thankful i feel of the popular shonen trail
My brother watches boruto
I don't think even if he stayed it would be better
Boruto was by a different person
Was about to say
The ending made me want more
I liked it
I watched the anime
Its hard to separate the work and the creator
I just dont know if i can watch it
And most likely wouldn't watch it
I never saw rurouni kenshin
Since if it was a filler arc wouldn't have waited this long
The movie is most likely the continuing where the anime left off
Yes it did
The manga is still on going
It did
Tho to quickly get back the black clover movie topic i think the studio was following the Trand or they planned for it since the anime had to have stopped at some point
To be made
But i was asking myself how much was cut from it
Hf was great
Demon slayer kinda get carried by its own studio
Idk
Well there ceo is under arrest
Cuz ufotable had to
Demon slayer just shat on everyone
It's reaching the end soon
Bc movie is most likely going to adapt the current manga arc
Don't remind me
I noticed bc is taking breaks when it can
If its enough for a season or 2
Now its just adapt as much as you can
I think that one still is on going
Doraemon
I can hear the old school mecha anime theme songs playing while he works
But i say good luck doing that after one piece
Since i did enjoy the anime
Well rip the series
So they are a dead company
Oof
What's the issue
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-12-23/chivalry-of-a-failed-knight-light-novel-series-to-end-next-year/.180942
https://youtu.be/bW6pGHjPCUk
also cypher
harem is in everything
isekai gets remember for being the same thing
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
to each there own
just 2 girls getting it on
<:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
cuz i grow up with battle school anime
could be my bais speaking
if you ask me
i would take battle school animes over isekais now days
if you just watched railgun
so somethings are going to feel empty
railgun is just one half of the index series
most of dengekis works are high in sales
i should get around to watch world trigger
well it is what it is
*fgo incoming*
its his fate
cypher just cant escape LNs
a mad man
still
at the same time
who wrote 2 novels
you mean a mad man
here comes the right arm
and railgun was just said content
i guess i found index more interesting
i cant even bother to fully watch railgun
cuz railgun is part of it
yeah thats why i wouldnt even skip index
And i want to hug her
Now im exited for the anime
Im at chapter 15
And i already like the main trio
So i decided to give spy x family a read
<:KirikaWarm:688187760095658246>
Who knows i just know who the main girl is and that's it
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
unless its a spin off
no tm series can escape takeuchi art
wait its legit over
Both the sub and dub do hold up well
Yes
he rises
my mind went p4 adachi
and it will keep going
need to milk those waifus with different outfits
different maid outfits
lol
That explains it
Whats that series about
I have questions
Unless there's a LN or manga that already has that concept
Or more
You will need to wait 10 years
Pfft
Motorbike battleships sounds like a interesting idea
<:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
looks pretty good
but i do remember the main characters mostly
walkfu i saw some eps at random
i think ill need a pic of the character your thinking of
i know some the actors in it
never watched that one
at least till that one ep
i dont remember code lyoko being that weird
the french do be weird sometimes
for honkai
trailers are already pretty good
Same author as magi
i could keep going
i know its going to be a riot in the streets
that depends
could be better or worst
tbh i feel like the creator may step in and change the ending of the anime
i think will see a shit show
unless the ending is original
with Aot
they really going the long route
i think Aot crushed crunchyroll before
this is nothing new
Even if i read the manga
But i still need to watch it
I know jjk movie came out
Everything gets over shadowed once aot demon slayer and jjk enter the pic
Man mb video about pirating anime makes me laugh
https://tenor.com/view/black-clover-emoticon-asta-lets-go-gif-21016541
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Or a harem protagonist
More of a LN protagonist
But naoto isn't edgy anti-hero
Just sadly no finished translations
Well bloodedge experience is another universe
I count naoto and Raquel
I seen it 3 times
Cuz hajime just duel wilds guns like its a Saturday and has it better then ragna
I never saw the 2 like that
I just know the author fired people
Didn't read it
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Well idk
Thats what i heard
I think one who season would be enough for it
So with that being a big prologue
Or was it 7
i heard the prologue is 12 vols
So people may not know what hell the mc went though
The anime skipped a lot from the start
i feel like thats what they were going for
thats the point
but im just waiting for the ggo arc to start
idk if people binge it cuz they love saoa or cuz its a tradition at this point
saw the ending on stream
ill watch it later
and i just said nope im not watching it
saw some spoilers
i heard it was a dumpster fire
i know funimation tends to reuse VAs a lot
cuz most dubs i watched girls did sound different from one another
depends
2022
while also shit talking noel
jin giving nightmares
bb  abridged
need to check the name
blazblue alter of memory
another abridged series
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/928773578827128842/929551447387955230/ShamelessForthrightIsabellinewheatear-max-1mb.gif
we talking hellsing here
hellsing
wasnt heinkel german
still a good series to watch
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
but oh well
how anderson said it sounded like michael to me
I didn't look at it
Could be How it was said
I swear remember Hearing michael
Father Anderson?
Context Michael
JESUS WANTS A HUG!!!
or im thinking of hellsing abrigeded
i cant remember if thats his first role in a anime
for saoa
tho i do hope the next ep is at least half way done
thats why i kinda died on the inside on stream
true
i know the channel on tv that had it was dubbed
early 2010s
i didnt watch that till the late 2000s
it used cg well enough
but i still think the cartoon models aged well
in live action
i do remember the models being a lot better
or being dubbed over
cuz you only way you can watch live action is with subs
and well it was dubbed over
but i did watch the live action show
not connected to cartoon
but i consider its own thing
i heard mixed opinions on it
the live action show
i think i need to do it as well
but it was also a digital ghost that can control people
it was skynet
william was it
and prime example of big foreheads
he was a dumbass
they did there homework on that one
interesting
as a last name
i always found della robbia weird
was it him
odd
well we can blame jeremy from booting up the super computer
was season 4 that long
damn
when it comes to the cartoon
thats as far as i know
other time when he was controlled
once when yumi messed up the process
i do remember 2 times
but in the comics he looked pixelated
and in the comic
i hear he logged in the novels
cuz s4 was where they were going places
i think xana get out by s3
cuz aelita would shut down as well
i know by the end of the 2nd season they couldnt shut it down
nearly ending a world then finding a girlfriend along the way
a girlfriend
well you know what he get out of it
the 2000s was the era of good cartoons
i kinda forget
was it some type of recording
i think that was around 3 or 4
tho i remember some eps where there virtual world vers would be in 2d animation
love
a update robs characters of many powers
makes sense
wasnt s2 when they changed what they even wear
i know about that
yes
or something coming
i knew he had a something to sense people
i forget he had that
i say the SRB dub was decent
never saw it on CN
but i do hope there at least decent
idk what other works she made
last thing she did was the novels
and from what i remember the original writer for code lyoko doesnt even work on the series
never fully saw evolution
i heard it ended on a cliffhanger
that i remember
she is in the real world
the live action code lyoko
tbh im surprised i remember the cartoons that well
oof
Joseph had do it for 2 seasons
Odd has been doing it for 4 seasons
classic
yup
heres the reddit post i saw
https://www.reddit.com/r/CodeLyoko/comments/93d2og/how_would_jeremy_look_like_in_lyoko/
idk then
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
well idk then
tower of god,god of highschool,hardcore leveling warrior
and 2 of them get a anime
i only read 3 series on webtoons
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
whats it called
Yeah the anime adapted the LN
Isn't that series more so a LN
Curiosity kills the cat
get to give it to them for say that
just to be the employee of the month
and he really works hard
he pretty much works in mcdonalds
but yeah
well its called differently in the show
and a mcdonalds
And i only remember the Serbian dub cuz that was what i watched as a kid
I haven't watched Pokémon in years
I know of 4kids since the script used for the Serbian dubs were just 4kids scripts translated into Serbian
And they took one piece licence without knowing anything about one piece
4kids target audience was kids
Unless someone that has been there told me so
Even i wouldn't have known
No
And 4 kids was known for its script changes
It was a line change
Yu gi oh
Has summoned
The dengeki LN master
And kaguya sama manga is in its last arc
But the anime is promising
I need to read more of spy x family
Kaguya sama and spy x family
Since animes i do care about are airing then
Im more so waiting for april
I hardly know what's new this days
Maybe a gacha could get her
Then even getting new ones
Last i checked she more so reprises her roles
Maybe shes voices in games
She more so ends up reprising her older roles when need be
Kugimiya is one va i rarely see in newer anime
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
Interesting
And index
I still have that link you sent for translated LN
I need to get to reading accel world
Nice

Is it still on going
But yeah from what i can remember they are a nice duo
I think i was close to the end of the anime
They are wholesome
Here they come
The madman is doing research
Its always a surprise to find out some real world facts in someones work
It comes back to Italy
Or watches
Everywhere cypher reads
Lol
this was one big trand in 2010s
then i guess its real
if a trailer drops
but god knows
im doubting it is
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
see them in book stores often
there also automata novels called short story
i know
could be wrong on that
but i think automata is the first of yoko taro games to even get a anime
i have not play the game myself
but nier is more then just that
im a ass guy
this sounds wrong

https://twitter.com/Spanku_u/status/1489508483166871553?t=FYlNOVm9nWRf1rFoabVu4A&s=19
the otaku
the one that voiced the guy Hsotd
it was the drip anime
its the only op i remember when i watched bleach
asterisk to me is the bleach op
if you count shonen anime
not the longest season i seen
disguised toast was already kinda big with heartstone
saw him playing among us with a group of streamers
he is musical artist
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>
youtube was a place where people posted whatever they want it
Best way i can discribes it im taking this from trash taste is every hentai tag put into one series
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
That's anime i was talking about
I almost want it to read the manga
But domestic girlfriend was a interesting dumpster fire at least
Like domestic girlfriend
But even then it was a dumpster fire
I guess eromanga sensei was shorter for me
Tbh idk myself
Knowing how it ends
So im kinda discouraged from watching it
But the ending was pretty much spoiled to me
And i only watched some eps of it
Yes
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
That's when some good anime come out
Since there isn't anything that interests me till April
At this point only anime im even consider giving a watch is baki the grappler
https://tenor.com/view/the-door-is-open-you-may-leave-gif-15357849
I would bleach my eyes
No
New game that was big but it was just there
Comic girls i forget about
Idk if i ever watched it
I couldn't escape that for sometime
But it was a good comedy anime
Blend s people would remember for the meme
A romcom anime about gamers
I was think season was good
Deposit being meh
Still get popular
Mainly form arcsys
Gamers i remember for how many fighting games it had in it
Correct me if im wrong here
I think its the teacher
Also hikasa yoko voices one of sisters
More so a bunch of tags
Not every
You can't convince me other wise on danmachi being a isekai when it clearly isn't one
This and baccano
Doesn't matter what it is
Its fantasy at the end of the day
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
^
And a reverse one at that
Devil as a part timer was a isekai ahead of its time
At this point i can feel the debt of what's isekai and what's not speaking up again but in danmachis cases isn't really one
It's fantasy
Yeah
Unless he goes to heaven
Cuz the mc doesn't go to a different world
You can't really consider it
That can keep the story going
Still there something
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
Ovas exist
The 3d anime that lived on though memes
A copy and paste of one another
That's what most of them are
Im done with the topic
Im just leaving it at what i said above
But its fun to start the party early
A vtuber
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
The studio just hires people
It all depends on the staff
bastard
but i do remember the brother ep
i remember catching some eps of futurama series
tbh im surpised it wasnt done sooner
Aho girl
I know that one
And it had a lot of fighting games from arc system works surprisingly
I seen the gamers anime
But tbh i wouldn't bother with crunchyroll on any gaming system
Tho didn't people found a way to use yt on switch before the app was a thing
Cuz pirate sites just have all my needs
I can't give money to any stream service period
But to me i see more value in a manga then a bluray
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
I kinda view the manga the same way
That's the thing collector's items
Then packs
Well the prices are more of a issue
Well they put dvds and blu-rays in the same package
Also funi from what i heard has some bad practices with blurays
But issue is that there really not doing themselves any favors currently
I enjoyed some funi dubs
This old news
When there is a main character
Focusing on whole class can be hard
If they ignore what the anime set up it will get confusing
I remember trunks having a cool outfit that's about it
And gt but i think i blocked those memories out of my head
Since i was one of those kids that really only watched z
But i would need to watch the original db at some point
But meh i would watch the original series then kai if i want it to refresh my memory
i hear kai isn't even that good or liked
Given dbz and its dubbing history
So whatever
Its the internet
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Even if i didn't watch dbza myself tried to but couldn't get into
People would still argue tfs is better
Well its more so small changes but still
But super ends up retailing movies but in different context i think the broly movie is the only one that didn't super eps since it came out after super
I tried to get into super
Original z and gt were enough for me
I think it was but i didn't watch it
Cuz dbz was still big even in the 2000s
Well if it wasn't dbz it was naruto
But this reminds i need to watch shaman King again
Long been confirmed
But it depends on the director
I don't think its going work like that
To quote yoko taro:money
<@279341087494242304>
Yeah its true now
his deck is rng but default
and a idol
seeing how shes in high school
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
but still a cool character
and shes a madlass
that she went online and posted it
she pretty much is obsessed with the MCs butt
looks like a new chapter
But will not get it anytime soon
Theres a chance
If shaman King and tokyo mew mew are anything to go by
Idk if that will happen
Holo is seeing a light of day again
And now a anime out of nowhere
Didn't Kizuna ai died off then people decided to turn her into nfts
Better hope the series doesn't go to shit fast
I guess the author need it more money
It was a hyped up romcom
isnt hidive sentai filmworks
I wouldn't be surprised if they decided to fuse the companies into one
It was coming
After both get bought by sony
https://myanimelist.net/anime/4154/Time_Bokan_Series__Yattodetaman
https://myanimelist.net/anime/4439/Kurenai_Sanshirou
i know there were 2 more series i watched but forget the names
i watched it cuz there wasnt really much on other channels on tv
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmgNKEZFzws
let me find it
but i think they used a different ver cuz the opening didnt sound japanese
it was dubbed in SRB
cuz i watched the original series
only series i remembered from tatsunokos side were yatterman
he was a playable character in that one
thats the name of the game
tatsunoko vs capcom
i kid i kid
ah tekkaman blade that one character from a capcom fighting game crossover
but never bothered to take a look
i know about the series
the main point of the series was selling songs
and the guy always going places with his bike and the kid following him with his dog
but kurenai sanshirou i remember it having blood
but i remember it airing somewhere at night
i just remember the show being episodic
this 2
All i know about that show is the maiden is horny for the duke
I guess that was a reference i should have expected
Lol
Pfft
Tho its been years since i watched vol 1 and 2
For rwby i say the jank wasn't that bad in first 2 vols
~~my hentai alarms are ringing~~
cypher on edens zero high
4kids kinda ruined some people
so it get that bad
so there having fun closed doors
i cant wait for p4au
<:MariaBliss:688836867390439585> well i do simp for mitsuru
and idk why
even tho i cant get used to voices in jp dub of p3
but p3 to p5 yeah i can say there good
i cant speak for p1 and p2
persona dubs has been agreed to be considered good
so i know its good
i played the game
interesting how the p4 anime get saved by the dub on your list
It was posted in nsfw
I should watch some more baki
that was a one time thing from what i can remember
wasnt that the intro and him training
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
well its a show after all
i was joking
XD
another person gets his bad luck
how many wilders are there
did you just say not toumas
i think at this point IB to be is something that can break universes in half
So after catching up to spy x family manga im left wanting more
<:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
When there's ||clone killing arms getting cut off ect||
Index i wouldn't hardly discribes as happy
God re-watching bleach made me remember why i don't like don kanonji sometimes
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Well i think azur Lane kinda beats it in porn
And many other gachas
The series that spawned azur lane
I could give this a shot if its just vol 1 and 2 but it goes into its original story
Looks like alternative take on vol1 and 2
And im kinda nostalgic for it
Im watching it since i get back into brave souls gacha
Im watching bleach again
Right now im not focusing on jojo
When SO is done I'll consider
I haven't read it
Well anyways part 7 is going to happen at some point and I don't think they can hold out on it for far too long
I could understand 3
Bruh
What's popular part in Japan
That's the reason its been called Netflix jail
Netflix doesn't work weekly
I was about to say bs but fair enough
Then part 7 would take years
Im too busy re-watching bleach so ill wait for part 6 to be full done
Ill be damned
April is going to be swatted with romcoms
Since i really enjoy the characters so far i just want to see more of them
So i hope they will have enough for 12 eps if its how much there making
As of right now it has 61 chapters
https://tenor.com/view/anyaspy-gif-21283433
Can't wait for the anime
I read all of spy x family
Good to know its ending soon
So im pretty much on done with my hero
Since i just didn't care anymore
I tried to watch up to 4 I think i didn't fully finished it
I guess season 2 was peak for me
My hero ill say just fell off for me
Considering animes can catch up to mangas fast
I get why they exist
Considering how much people hate naruto filler arcs
I think this is a war zone of a take
Honestly i think i would just get to main arcs
Cuz a friend told me to skip it cuz it will turn me off from watching bleach any further
I skipped don and the one after soul society
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Skipped a filer arc just now
I have bleach to take care of
Could be a good refresher
Since i did drop it when i read the manga
And the anime i need to watch again
Since i don't have many people to talk with about the manga
Im limiting myself on edens zero talk
It is getting interesting
Im fully up to date with the manga
Tho get to give it to mashima he did get all 3 of his work to get a anime adaptation
And it is a improvement
I read edens zero
Ending may have dragged but still a good enough ending
And it wasn't that bad
I finished the whole series
Since theres cd left
I think we are not going full on bringing modren characters to movie world yet
That was consistent
It was mostly 4kids
Sticks
Its one of the most memed series
You talking about the eng VA?
But the manga is still on going
I know
Since it is common for manga from shonen jump to be short
Aren't 40 pages half a vol at that point
Huh looks like the next chapter for spy x family is next week
Since i want to see more of them in action
Im just waiting for the new chapter to come out
And i love the family in general
But i did read spy x family
I haven't read it
Idk
So its ending soon
Its in its last arc
I wasn't really big on chika
Kaguya hooked me from the first ep
Since LNs tend to be in works for a long time
But you will be waiting a long time for new chapters
And manga is just a adaption
Well most isekai tend to be LNs
Cuz that one was pretty good
Somehow im surprised to hear kaguya didn't hook you
Idk what was the reason
I think cd was the only game to change the tracks
I think that was the point since it was meant for eggman
But even then the movies are there own thing
And time travel
Considering it was just save little planet
Want cds plot basic as hell
Big the cat is a thing
So i can't say for sure
But I only saw clips of it
Some would say persona 4 animation
I never watched those but i was close to doing so
We talking adaptions with VNs or different anime
Well someone has to start somewhere
Cuz i was in a phase of watching clips or top 10s on yt
I know how as ends
I heard of that one
Ah
Yeah i need context
But it was good
Almost cried
And i thought that was good
I watched angel beats
Since I think i stopped when i finished fukas arc
I didn't watch all of clannad
And speak of the devil
When i think anime adaptations of games VNs come to mind Cuz of how many are there
Unless the author decides to change the ending
Cuz its the cool thing to do now
And they are going to end it on movie
Aot at this point is being milked for all its worth
And its interesting how all adaptions have a different outcome from the source
And stopped when the revenge part was done
I read the manga for shield hero
I heard the op for it never watched it
Alicezation being a close 2nd
To me ggo both vers were my favs
Lets go
Staff most likely moved to 3hz
Fuck yeah
Since i was watching bleach i never skipped the first ending
It depends on if i like it or not
Any anime can
Well if gundam can do it for years
The man can still improve
On what people expect
The bar is already set too high for him
And his next work is ok at best
When the anime is done
At least the author can move on and make something else now
Well aot is going to be a anime that's making history
Still i can tell change was coming
And they were in jail
Somewhere when they found out what's in the basement
Im kinda thankful i stopped with the series when i did
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
Forget sunrise likes making other nations op as hell in gundam
God damn it
While true i never thought it can happen in real life cuz unless Japan advanced to the point of building meches like gundam i can only see it happening with futuristic weapons
If i had to pick some examples mainly Naruto and last arcs of yu gi oh season 1 and gx 5ds i never fully finished
I think that was the only time a network decided to just keep show going cuz i remember some shows stopping at certain points here and never fully finished the some series
And just used jp eps to continue the dub
Cuz it keeped going even after where 4kids dub ended
God now im reminded of srb dub of tokyo mew mew
Laura Bailey is in it interesting
Even if there had to be changes
A show for children entertainment
Well 4kids always stayed true to what they were promoting
I always assume most eng dubs come from America
And there some changes to it
But its named differently
Yeah
The one that just did changes to make it more kid friendly i assume
The high seas are really my only place when it comes watching stuff like anime and shows that used to be on tv and stuff
🏴‍☠️
Or sail the high seas
A page of 40 cards
You are reading a page
Or get overloaded with effect text
But some people can't read
Yes
Cuz rest just don't peak my interest
I think that's the only animes I planned on watching this season
Only ones for me are kaguya sama and spy x family
If its from Japan
Since I couldn't connect to it
Idk if you need a vpn to make it work
Need dmm store to download it
It has a app
It has a mobile ver
I still see doujins of it to this day
It was the og shipgirls game
Japan does
It was
Ash finds every chance to recommend comic girls
Since chainsaw man is still in the works
Or how many other projects they are working on
Not like they are catching a break with aot
Mappa is overworking people
Cuz doing the last season in parts is just infuriating
I just feel like there milking it or are planning to do something
Yeah there going to milk it slowly
At this point
I don't really do that since i feel like some shows need more time to have a good build up
It sounds like a anime that would make people with the 3 ep rule give up
I remember dropping that one tho may give it a watch again if i ever consider it
It's not out yet i assume shield hero s2
Rewatch
Since i really don't feel like watching it cuz of bleach right now
It really depends on my mood
And haven't seen brotherhood
Hard for me to comment since i hardly remember 03 fma
Time for those charge inputs
And the singer also did fmab first op and i love that song
Im more of a fan of the 5th op
But still the 2nd op isn't that bad
Im more of a fan of there blue exorcist ops
2nd op i know the band
Only thing i remember mostly was the 1st op and ending after that i can't remember much after it i think i was somewhere when ichigo was fighting byakuya but it's too fuzzy for me to remember
At least last ep i watched cuz i never fully finished bleach
Everyone was good
Bleach i had no issues with the subbed ver
I could give it another chance but ill most likely stick to dub for fma
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Cuz romi park in some cases sounds like a older woman to me then a young boy
And idk if i can watch fma in sub again
Im watching bleach dubbed since im fan of JYB and his performance
Same with fma 03
I watched bleach before on tv subbed
In that world yeah
It do be like that
And i feel that can get boring sometimes
Chika is always the one that makes things chaotic
Oh the irony
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Or better site protection
By safe you mean better quality content
I used gogo or 9anime since i don't torrent
I know some people here use it

Driving the smugness home
I may watch dal s4 now if i feel like it
You get it when its fully done
With Netflix you don't get weekly
Cuz i need to draw attention
https://tenor.com/view/hurkisq-haruyuki-accel-accel-world-gif-19208326
First time i heard someone say iruma is a isekai
Looking for a job
https://tenor.com/view/huh-gif-23918002
Isekai?
2 was 10 eps
Sounds like a stretch if you ask me
Given jc staff was just taking projects like it was nothing
Welp time to wait next week
https://tenor.com/view/shirakami-fubuki-hololive-yabe-vtuber-gif-19227770
My cultured dengeki bro
Nothing beats adventure
Frontier was higher for me
Tamers was alright
And i was planning on watching it again
It was funny
First ep of kaguya sama season 3
9anime.me is the one for legit domains
Hahaha
So its getting fun
Already at ep 14
<@87512939107450880> found the ep where i last watch of accel world i watched it was 13
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~manga reader here~~
When yor and 2 other characters show up
Its going to get more messy and fun
<:KirikaGlee:698939825927094384> god i love the first ep already
im still watching it but so far its like the manga
Hey cypher
And i hope they don't rush the adaptation since we are still early in the story
And shes a really fun character i can't wait for her school segments to be animated to see some meme worthy faces
If i had to discribe her expressions
Anya is pretty much has a lot of faces
https://tenor.com/view/anya-anya-forger-gif-25202990
I read the manga and i can say it gets more fun with more characters join in
Well spy x family is 2 studios
and the ending is a good time
both studios putting in the work
I had accel world on the mind lately so i just want it finish it and read the novels
I forget haru uses his legs for fighting
I just need to download the vols on my phone
Alright fair enough
Dont watch it?
Since i may as well read them if the movie is a bunch of vols ahead
And when im done with the anime I'll Pick up the novels
Lol
The wife in spy x family
Thats going to make things even more fun
I just can't wait for yor to show up
At least the anime
Finished accel world
I was meaning to ask cypher do you have any links for aw vols i want to download them
Ah right forgot that exists
Gets denied by a even bigger card effect
And speaking of kyhime her vacation arc was fun
Since the vr helmet was in it when haru was doing research
And now im even more convinced sao and accel world are connected
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Or hime spoiling haru
We talking a wild ride spice
Need to read novels
One of the basic bad guys ao far
Yeah
It was alright
The ending i liked for the animation alone for the dust taker arc
The song was good
<@87512939107450880> https://youtu.be/w0a3_xWiQcg found my fav op for aceel world
Oof
Now go watch victory gundam
Next door
New testament
So a refresh on ot would be good enough
And its been years since i seen index
Cuz i may miss something
I think ill start from scratch
Im in for a long ride
And i think im one of the few anime watchers that doesn't outright hate him
The Italian hand
It could make understand the "bad guy thing better"
I guess it would make the most sense
Ah
I guess ill start at 13 then
I just want to see how the accelerator fight goes there
Since i haven't fully finished it
I don't means rereading the start of season 3
<@87512939107450880> need some pointers here
Im assuming the animes are still in ot
After this i may read a bit of index
Np
Im going to download them all the current vols on nyaa
It works
<:KirikaGlee:698939825927094384>

Could try that
And it has its own book app
Well my phone is Huawei
Ill give it a look
Since i normally read Manga on my phone
Idk if there's a app for phones that can read the files
I only really know devil is a part timer
I think it is
Klaus is a chad
I love that anime
https://tenor.com/view/anime-dancing-dance-move-gif-16112547
Lns already sworming
Too late
You get more trash then interesting stories
This what happens when you ask for more isekai
Sunrise whipping those animators
Shes going for that revange
Welp im most likely going to be there when vol 60 comes out
Since in the manga we are still early in its story
And next year season 2
I thought it was going to be 12 eps
Ah
So i expect them slowly to adapt the series
The chapters are pretty long
And they only adapted 2 chapters so far
And it was great
If 9anime and gogo are taking there sweet as time
I guess ill download it off nyaa then
Still waiting for ep 2
https://tenor.com/view/spy-x-family-anya-sparkling-eyes-anime-gif-25175073
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Great time to shoot my brains out
More index
But as a manga reader i just love yors character
I haven't seen that one yet
~~i have a bais~~
I thought yor was best girl
I would drink a beer over that
No i refuse
After that i just stopped
Then i was just disappointed with god of high school
They had something with tower of god
May as well since i doubt crunchyroll is doing originals this days
Maybe i should watch that at some point
And i find it interesting how it was written
I seen clips of over the moon for you
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Maybe later
And i wasn't really interested to to watch it
Well i have life stuff to worry about
But even i know when things get boring
I consider myself a sucker for romance and harem anime
But reality is often disappointing
She seems cool
I think i get that vibe off the trailer
Im just having fun with spy x family and kaguya sama
Im just saying
And i hear shes best girl
Shikimori i haven't even seen
https://youtu.be/WZYwMqX_Tt4
There was a heavy object meme what people expected and what they get
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Heavy object
Life saver
Tho ill need to hunt more GT vols
Yeah its just there
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>

Theres still NT
Yes
More index talk
Not girl on girl action
||his a siscon that can be a cool uncle||
Yor is best girl and yuri is cool
Yup
||yor beats her without even trying||
<:KirikaGlee:698939825927094384>
That woman give zero fucks about what the guys were seeing what she was doing
If we are talking about heavy object the boss was something
The madness of the man
This looks like its based on another SK manga
Yeah the timing is odd as hell
any longer then that arc
and i cant really see the story moving forward
dude spade arc dragged on long enough
made me want to play the game
i did like r6s collab
https://tenor.com/view/arknights-surtr-gif-20942897
so hoo boy
i heard there collabing with capcom
but im not getting my hopes up
i need to see the first trailer
The ending was really great for spy family
but she is a good pick as well
i need to disagree with that statment
So who is fucking with time
I just watched it
I don't think we are at that point yet
And never bothered watching his stuff i know he has been in dramas with cartoon community
I saw one video from mrenter
but idk who most of those people are
i think i read brians name for ryan
well have enough for second cour but idk when season 2 will happen
assuming there going chapter by chapter
This means war
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
So its read the manga endings
Had to use Google
I Havent read rave master

This also goes for fts early manga chapters
Since mashimas early works lookes like one piece sometimes
More so a shift in artstyle
Well don't see it as a poor transition
Cuz animes to me don't really count
Have seen the manga panels of rave master
Well at least he improved in writing
All 3 get a anime
His did make 3 series
Well true
Naruto could have just end it and it wouldn't matter
Ft pretty much get spin offs as well
Just to see how big the flame gets
I guess i just like dumpster fires like sao
The plot is just her breaking the game
Kinda why i didn't watch it
But i just give up on it cuz i had other things i want to watch
Neverland was kinda interesting for me
Recommended the manga
Neverland was butchered
Shonen still runs into this issue often
I known the 2000s is where a lot of anime just didn't have a ending or had to go original
Well not all of them
np
on cf
currently in tourney
Manga readers knew she was going to be loaded with memes
the body count is pretty high if you ask me
Me when i wish accel world had another shot at a anime
Then i saw avatars
I was about to ask wth
It was clearly gacha horses
Aya wth
Let's go
First movie idk if there was the one that made me cry
I think for me it was princess monoke
I haven't seen accel anime tbh
Well fair enough mangas are easier then novels
Well i didn't find railgun as interesting as index tbh
I never knew railgun was that popular tbh
https://youtu.be/qNNd-G9F4lw <@87512939107450880> need your opinion on this
I have to agree with you there
Also how are sao light novel going so far
I forget it worked like that but oh well
Oh shit
Everything goes faster when they go into brain burst
Ah right
Time stop
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Reading LNs would be my last worry
Im already deep in the dengeki hole
I need to find time to read the novels but since i have a job now its going to be hard
Mb
Ok ill move it there
Ah
Ah nice
Is dal ln done or still has few vols left
Found it in a gaming store and it was the last one so worth it

Also i bought my first anime figure
Back to square one of Finding a job
Unemployment
Also how have you been
Its all in secs in accel world
https://tenor.com/view/panic-anime-dont-know-what-to-do-running-in-circles-gif-14026454
Nice
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
Yeah
But i mostly know him for his role in blazblue as naoto kurogane
He did a lot of anime roles
I don't think that was his best role
Nah
Mainly naofumi josuke and naoto kurogane
Ferdinand isnt the role i know him for the most
And when he said he had cancer i could only pray to God when i heard he had it
Yeah
Last i remember
I think Tokyo mew mew artist died
May his soul rest
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>

P-90 looks different in gfl
To be more correct
Sao alternative gun gale online
<@87512939107450880>
https://tenor.com/view/llenn-gun-sword-art-online-alternative-gun-gale-online-gif-11803115
Close to what rising is
Well he sounded differently in mgs4
How bad people thought cgi was
Kemono friends was memed to death
Sidonia?
Well as long as its not remake I guess it's fine
Besides what i already watched the first seasons of
I haven't been keeping up with what's coming out
And even then last thing i watched was re zero season 2 part 2
Ill just expect the hype to die down for solo leveling
Everyone is shitting on that trigun trailer
Isn't it a gacha
I even saw novels for it
Fair enough
Unless it was Korean only
I don't think solo leveling is on webtoons last i checked
Tower of god had potential
I had faith in god of high school that get shit on
And solo leveling has been hyped for years i tried to read it but dropped it cuz i forget about it
Never read it but seem to be everywhere i go
I seen this one a lot on Manga sites
I sometimes forget fmp exists thought about checking it out but never came to for wising
I say it was nice
Oh i seen that one
Ah
To what?
<@87512939107450880>
Ayy
Wanting to just be with aceel

Railgun isn't that fun to watch for me tbh
Nah
Well there not fully blood related
I have to agree with cypher on that one
Im buying it
If i ever see a Sinon or asuna figure somewhere
https://tenor.com/view/sao-alicization-kirito-kirigaya-kazuto-asca-gif-24650815
Fuck yeah
Well she never had issue giving him shit
Tho kirito pretty much let them to believe they still had a chance with him
The girls still want him
And evolved
Goes to show how long the artists has done
Alternative seem to be having a slow release it seems last i checked it was labeled still on going
It pretty much end it at the start of 2nd squad jam
I know theres alternative manga as well that finished in 4 vols
So lns it is
Fuck
Its no longer being published
Let me guess
Also the store i buy my manga and lns has Manga adaptations of progressives and regular sao
May get them tomorrow
Have 2 more to get for now
<@87512939107450880>
And going to book store to get Manga or ln
But im fine with being old school
Ill most likely use amazon at some point
And im fucking jealous of America
Serbia
For me shopping online means getting fucked by fees
I have to go to city to buy it
Its a bookstore that has a lot of different books and has a section for comics and manga
But yeah cypher if there's ever a chance of sao accel world or index coming out here in LN form ill try to get it
She was created pretty late into the series
She did want it to confess
Well i can see quality not being that great
Thing is we have serbian translations for manga  only but only few series are translated so lns are eng for me
Well fair enough
Cuz i haven't heard of any new series she made
If she even makes any Manga at this point
So he would see her at work
Togashi married the author of sailor moon
I guess when you don't have assistants it could happen
Hunter x hunter is coming back but the price was the author having problems sitting
It really is sad

<@87512939107450880>

tbf it is dragging on in its last arc
god of highschool
since i read goh
i had other things i want it to read
i dropped the series early on cuz i just forget about it
expected it
yeah i been collecting manga and lns as well
i have few other games
blazblue centralfiction
dont have it installed
hello
since i know its getting anime
and how it went
Depends on if the stocks for the ps5 are still crap by then
tho i still cant believe he was able to get into politics
yeah i heard about it yesterday
Sounds funny
Also cypher
Sss.dynazenon
time to go balling with haro
oh damn
https://tenor.com/view/arknights-cute-adorable-gif-16126445
my man
Nice
Must be pretty meh
But don't hear anything about it
I seen this one in a bookstore often
since he was on a quest to lose weight
last i remember of dashi was he lost some weight
for a min there i thought it was spreeding its legs
3rd op was good but i have op 1 and 5 stuck in my head mostly

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
this sounds like a battle of who is more in sync with their gundam tbh
code taker looks cool but i dont play links much so i cant give my opinion fully
i always liked the first 2 cards
Its a monopoly at this point
So a anime for kaiju no 8
and rave master
there pulling a noblessing
i heard there changing the mcs nationality
i heard the story wasnt that good for it
so most likely the same case is going to happen with the anime
i hear solo leveling get carried by its artstyle
that idk
tower of god is a korean manga
not sure if cr said anything about it
i think some people said that
now god only knows how it will turn out
great
i thought the author said no to season 2
wait its going to happen?
thing is isekai tend to be LNs often
Yeah its the start is werid but at the same time the guy had no other option
she do be taking some aspects
it seems like the series cant get animated
im hoping its animated
Hope they recover
Well this unfortunate
<:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
~~tsubaki especially~~
they love bully people
and i know thing about some hazama players
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/97879289461997568/946845735868071976/le_funny.gif
just depends on when
i think it could happen
but given mahoyo is getting a movie
if a new tsukhime anime ever gets announced
its been run to the ground for years
that joke at this point is annoying to me tbh
<:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
No problem my dengeki bro
I have yet to watch it
https://tenor.com/view/neco-arc-nodding-nod-gif-23704746
Sure when im available
And i still can't do a combo right
I only played aacc and tl
Yeah i do play melty but im a scrub
Somehow i don't understand how people find index boring when railgun is boring to me
But ill wait and see what reki will do with it but i don't expect a lot of interesting stuff
Ill be honest it looks generic as hell to me
That's what made me interested in where it was going
When his arm get cut off
Idk i saw some potential in anime touma
Cuz lns are 90% text
Issue ends up being adapting lns tends to be harder then adapting a manga or a vn
And index at the same time
Madman wrote heavy object
And thats just index from mikoto pov
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
Go play god eater 3
Aya please
Along with sao
Well it is one of dengekis popular lns
Unless jc staff is that desperate for another adaptation
I doubt there will be another index anime
Tho i would understand if someone thought index was
Yeah mikoto never felt like a protagonist
No there yet and i mean abridged
So i watched ep 16 of saoa and i was dying of laughter of how things went with the role play in it
But i tbh im watching code geass with few new scenes added in
Yeah i tried to watch those
Well this will be a shit show
Replace genshin with hoyoverse
Should have played VN
Still haven't read the novels
My paycheck is on the 10th
<@87512939107450880> you know what time it is
Rest are mangas and i often avoid ln manga adaptations
There few lns in store from what i can remember phone isekai the overpowered cautious hero and one other i keep forgetting
I just found out there selling them
Im missing vol 6 to 10
I didn't buy it i just found out in a book store there selling more vols
Not yet
<@87512939107450880> at the book store again and found something interesting today
And then wait god knows how long for vol 11 to come here
4 more to go
https://tenor.com/view/addition-to-mycollection-more-collection-gif-14095863

God damn it tfs
*my head going to hellsing abridged*
Well at least im happy the series ended
It is
<:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
Hahaha
Trust me you haven't seen worst of it yet

<@87512939107450880>
When it was not total drama series or some eps of inazuma eleven
Brave and the bold was one few shows on cn i watched on tv
Hamills performance just fits too perfectly as the joker and its hard to even anyone else to try and emulate his joker voice
Isn't that more of a crossover ep
I remember watching batman brave and bold a lot and the voice actor for batman was pretty good
He pretty much is the definitive voice of batman given how many years he voiced the character and how much he loved it
They come out of the wood works when something old shows up
Never underestimate early 2000s shonen fans
It was teased before
Pfft
Pfft
https://tenor.com/view/i-want-it-sword-art-online-sword-art-online-alternate-gun-gale-online-sao-gif-15118869
2 more to go
<@87512939107450880>
Before reading since i know once i read it all im waiting a year or more for the next vol
Also i would read alternative just want to get all the vols i can
Index i would need months of reading
I still haven't read sao alternative
Isn't this spoilers for nt
And i seen That image of the ln
I seen the video pop up
Same tbh
Magic makes things more spicy
Well i guess i found my answer to why i like index more then railgun
The man pushes himself
*starts writing another series*
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>

I even get something for free
<@87512939107450880> my fav vol cover so far for alternative
And i think its the start of the 5th squad jam tournament
Vol 11 get translated not too long ago
I have yet to read alternative until i get all the vols i can buy currently but it seems like those pistols are staying with her
I have yet to read thw novels since i want it to get them all so i can read them since i loved the anime
<@87512939107450880> last one for my collection for now
And a pretty interesting idea for iron man at the time not a rich adult but a teen who lost his rich life and father
I love this soo much a childhood fav of mine
I think they would still be doing crimes
If the author doesn't underestimate there work and are able to make a good conclusion to series i think its possible for it to end in a year
But its too late now
Well if Sony didn't lose the rights to Disney maybe we would have get a 3rd season
If they do get all the original vas are back its going to be a fun time
Some people just use Japanese abbreviation or name for some unexplained reason
It's punching session time
Sounds like him
World at it again
And it pretty much stopped mid way through the first arc
I personally think it didn't do the game justice
I would disagree on the god eater take
https://tenor.com/view/anya-anya-forger-anya-spy-x-family-anime-anya-spy-x-family-spy-x-family-gif-25682632

Jyb voices then both in the games and anime
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
Blood for the blood god
Tho i consider it a classic since it was a early isekai story before isekai get over saturated
Ah yes one anime i was one season away from finishing
https://tenor.com/view/yu-narukami-dancing-persona4-specialist-video-game-gif-17873794
And i love his performance for both
He does a good job on doing both characters well
And it was exactly that first picture
I seen vol 1 in a book store
After gamers put rev2 and persona 4 arena ultimax im not surprised
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
This is me making a cast in pso2

Im not complaining tbh
