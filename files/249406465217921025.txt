more hair = exponential decrease in floof
It's a lesser known fact but her floofy short hair actually contributes 15% additional power to her punches
long hair bikkie just feels wrong :/
oh my god, why is she so perfect as a rapper/dj
that too
thanks anyway, it's the thought that counts <:love:514443048533622820>
Doing ~~god's~~ Shem-Ha's work. Much appreciated  üíô

one of these days i'll wake up to pages of Goth Miku fanart
the og Shem-Ha design is cool too
and that's still Miku
You can drive the car but it's the car that is getting you from A to B
Shem-Ha aint bestgirl, goth-miku is
welp no doubts on the latent ara ara energy of bestgirl at least
Maria is a perfect older sister type ara ara imo
The real question is who has more ara ara power. Kanade or Maria?
Her demise also takes place at a super early establishing point of the show so of course they had no clear vision of scaling at the time.
lol sorry if I offended ya,
blame it on my Australian nature
ofc '3 noise' is an exaggeration
nah but was just dicking around
quelle shock
the guy with "Kanade" in their name is defending her
<:Raphtalia_Smug:572403619123691530>
yes
correlation?
``That's a lie
Look at Kanade
She has a lot of hair and a LOT of floof``
And she became Kanadead to like 3 noise <@!102691114762371072>
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Was real glad to see Blake's hair becoming more like her mothers
Kali Belladonna hottest character
