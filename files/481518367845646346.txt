Oh no she's (spoiler warning) || Shemiafied!||
Okay
idk how to do that
Mobile
How do you "shadow " a picture?
I thought you just had do to one "|"
Oh so its double
|| testing ||
I also got a question. Does the shadow thing work in this server? Because I'm trying to cover a slight spoiler with it but its not working.
Okay
If we don't already, could we make these into stickers?
<:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>
<:ElsaChef:689035502673985622>
<:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>
Which one? xd
<:MillaarcPlead:663522911067570176>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
You wonder what?
I want it
<:OgawaRead:688429716507721770>
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Hehe
Like I've said in other chats.
I'm hopeless üòÖ
Oohh I see it now, thank you!
I'm I'm mobile...
And I have no clue how to view pins whitout scrolling all the way back to when they were typed
Thank you
Maybe add a question section? Because I have absolutely no idea what the <#384870333620027403>  chat is for üòÖ
<:TomosatoSalute:688199574749446203>
You can just do what I do. Have a bunch of anime reactions in your gallery and then use them when the time comes
Oh
> :ShirabeSob::KirikaSob:
<@203444794737950720> 
Why? Was it a emote before?
Eh I tried ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I also got this beauty ( possible emote wink wink nudge nudge)
I'm always prepared ‚Ä¢ÃÄ.Ã´‚Ä¢ÃÅ‚úß

Why do I see that happening üòÇ
I already know about the maria x Tsubasa and Tsubasa x Chris debate. But that one seemed pretty peaceful
What shipping wars are even in the Symphogear fandom?
Yep...
I'm pretty sure its just a random number and then that random number stays at that ship percentage
You could also do random words
You do "--ship" and then enter two words/names and see how well they go together
I don't really care that much if this gets declined. But could we possibly add the Yggdrassil bot?
Ohhh
What's the shinais?
And I like yours better
I swear their was something else of Garie I had but I can't find it
Oh, I thought it was gonna be one of these.
What is it?
and hey at least you can use your possible emotes in the <#384870333620027403>  chat.
Wait, what was the second one?
Yes!
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
oooooo
1 question. I don't know if this is a emote nor do I care that much if it isn't but. Is this a emote?
Only in this situation though. I don't really see the emote any where else really.
Its perfect right now in this situation XD

It was that Hibki one I believe?
Idk
<:ElsaChef:689035502673985622>
<:MillaarcV:673239269036392526>
Probably doesn't downscale well. Right?

but what about the other two?
Yeah.. It belongs more in the liveshitposting

> Tsubasa's hair is in the way
<@189146272865845248>
Hibki does that face for 3 seconds straight xd
Eehhhh??
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
yehaaaaa....
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
Like that
I mean... If they don't really work as emotes you could just use them as "reactions" like what I do in the introductions channel
I think it looks good. I just don't know what context you would use it in
Which ones?
I know the last one can't become an emote but I just think its funny.
Yes I know two of these aren't Symphogear related
Possible emote??
Yay she's back
<:CarolShock:730816714345938956>

<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Or like" Oh s"it here we go again "

<@237964037898502144> 
Disappointed
My editing skills on my phone SUCK

We'll... It IS night during the episode
Eh? This MIGHT work, but idk.
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
<:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>
Yes! we need some Micha love!!
My opinion on the Serena ones. I think this one might better because we don't really have any emotes that show this specific emotion.
I personally think if we're going for a "rage" emote then Maria or MAYBe Hibkim because idk if its just me but the Andou one looks like she's going crazy and going bersker at the same time. Could just be me though.
I'll still read/look at it.
I know its a XDU story but I accedently skipped that part. Plus it was in JP
Why did Hibki suddenly get lighting powers with Bersker mode anyway?
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
This noise needs a friend
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
<:KirikaFish:717138469381734471>
I want the sanit Germain to be a thing please!
We need this!
<:KirikaGlee:698939825927094384>
<:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
Ehh?
:Chrissumg:
<:KirikaGlee:698939825927094384>
Both are good in my book
Its just more... Centered I guess
I personally like the 2nd one better
<:KirikaGlee:698939825927094384>
Yep. Figured
What about that? Or is it two big into a emote?
<:ShirabeToast:672245704118501376>
B
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
I personally think its kindve meh. But I'm wondering what everyone else thinks how it works as a possible emote/gif.
Eh?
<:ShirabeJoy:672105345316814878><:KirikaJoy:672105345342111785>
<:KirikaWhat:671948299179130885>
Just like in the game xd
What about some TsuChris emote(s) we don't really have any of those.
more Hibku
We need more though!
<:HibiMikuPeek:661660014288568361> <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968> <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Yes!
That's a lot
<:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
How many animated slots are their anyway?
Yeha..
Yeha. Some of duo ones are pretty good
> unless you mean we should add more (which we totally should!)
Agreed, but like no one uses them that's the thing. Maybe with like a bot or something.
Yeah...
Yeah?
I know most of the Maria ones aren't used often or at all. And then I almost never see anyone use the song stone emote
What emotes would we get rid of anyway? (If we could)
Im just saying its a way we could add more
I know that,  I don't have nitro.
<:FudouEyes:672846284725682195>
loop holes are my speciality
wait, do gifs count as emojis? Because if no. Their might be a way to bypass the system
I can't verify for the Gobal channel though, because I never check there.
Nope, its never used in the XDU JP channel
Its more of proud carol I think
<:Bike:690470896892379136>
Keep the 2nd one  and maybe the Elfnein one
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864> <:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
Like I like the first one. But I don't see the second one being used that often
What about those two?
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864> <:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Oh..
Ohhh like a tier list/poll? To see which one(s) the discord think should/could go?
*thanos snap*
shiny
oooo
how would you animate the song stone emote though? Or would it just be a still image?
Yeha!
> and to the point brought up awhile ago, I think we can do without the <:SongStone:688213224012644370> emote
Agreed
Isn't their a mem that shows Chris with Tsubasa and Maria? What if we use something like that? So it resembles all 3 of the ships
"at this time"
Maybe the second one should go. For the Hibki ones
I also like hype <:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
Are the beans  ever used often though?
I use the Kirka often
<:MikuHype:688429715676987428> <:KirikaGlee:698939825927094384>
I use 2/3 of those
üòÖ
Oh
The only beer emote I knew of was the Shirabe one
<:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377> <:Zababies:672238628398956594>
The song stone might be turned into a moving emote because its unique
I don't even think Ruby uses <:KirikaChant:663568587310628892>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>  what about this kiri?? Like I don't see it much. Plus she already has some smiling ones.
that ones also gone
oo and the kirir chant emote
> So what are we getting rid of some for?
Were shifting the song stone emote to a animated one I believe and..... That's all i remember üòÖ
its only one out of those 3 that I would be okay with going
Yeah. That's why I said consider
I like the middle one.
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592> <:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149> <:TsubasaDere:689195981841236109>
The only Tsubasa emotes I would consider maybe getting rid of is one of these
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
If it helps with the whole. Those two characters don't have a lot of stuff to work with thing. In a scene in AXZ episode 2 when their going down a clip where <:FujitakaSalute:688199574917087256>  has a pretty funny moment.
oh
<:TomosatoPixel:691727930371342447> <:KanadePixel:691727930069483691> 
Wait,what's the thrid pixel?
yeah. Its a pain because I believe lilly and Medula had to ask permission from the artists. But no one uses them.
I personally don't care that much if it stays or leaves. Because I don't use it a lot
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447> 
What about the Vanessa smug one?
I did find this though while looking for it
Its just how it is I guess
I went back and found it. Its not that much different though resolution wise.
But is it used often though?
<:MikuSigh:688429722799308883> what about thks Miku then? If it has to come to it
we keeping it
Thank you Mac Chan
I know its from GX, but is it episode 8? Or 10?
I could find it real quick and see if I can get a higher resoulation one
its episode 8 right?
<:CarolShock:730816714345938956>
I personally see and like this one more
> We *do* have animated coin emote tho
But at the same time. It alowws us fellow non nirtos to use it.
> <:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720> <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>  what about one or both of these?
Soooo back to the Kirkas?
miku stays
Their good I just don't see the kiri ones  used
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720> <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>  what about one or both of these?
<:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
For once I don't know a meme. My name is a lie!
I see it sometimes.. But like.. Idk
Eh
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
> I never noticed before how blurry <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760> is
Me neither
it is more clear. I admit. But I see <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>  more
Because.... Its Hibki :D
I personally think <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>  replaces <:HibikiAwe:688397678572339230>
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937> <:HibikiAwe:688397678572339230> 
?
Yeah
Maybe keep the middle one be cause I see that fairly often
watch it be spammed bellow this
yeah
Maria's emotes for me are like Shirabes.Where their sightly simailr yet unique in their own ways and I don't want to get rid of them but at the same time I kindve want to.
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658> 
What about this Maria one?
Yeah, like the song stone
idk if its just me though
<:HibikiMonch:688190074646691843>  but this one gives a different feel though
I'm like 50 50 with the pardou
on the other other other hand it does just sit there
but on the other hand. We don't really have any holiday ones though
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
what's in the bag goblin slayer?
<:PadoruHibiki:516438720082346004>
because it could just be a annual emote. I'm fine with that personally
I haven't been here that long. But is it used around Christmas?
?
<:PadoruHibiki:516438720082346004>
Same energy. just less emotionally out there I guess.
<@468591607332208641> 
> Maria's emotes for me are like Shirabes.Where their sightly simailr yet unique in their own ways and I don't want to get rid of them but at the same time I kindve want to.
<@481518367845646346>
wait. Whaaatt???
Its adorable but again. Never used
what about.... <:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>  she's a ify because she has VERY few
> I know <:KanadeLewd:690470896174891008> and <:KanadeWink:690470895608791040> are used by two people.
Plus, the first one is giving me the thirsty vibe (if you know what I mean.) And the other one is her smiling
<:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884> <:KanadeSinging:421432676789256202> <:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392> <:KanadePixel:691727930069483691>  are thoese the ones your on the fence about?
<:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392>
sooooo what about this Kanade one? Its a case of. Its good but not used
then we will all spam it when it comes back <:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
And then we would cry
Well.. That's ironic
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
So this one is a maybe/save for later right?
please someone animate that into a gif/animated emote!
Perfect!
<:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
But I'm fine with it gone
I like <:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
Minus the animated emote because no nitro
Elfnein set
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585> <:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377> <:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246> <:ElfneinShock:688429716956381285> <:ElfneinPresents:691733046633955439> <:ElfneinPalm:672430572961923092> <:ElfneinMunch:688190074285850728> <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952> <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241> <:ElfneinAAA:672437636362665984>
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505> <:ElsaGrowl:672841416229126164> 
What about one of these two?
Yet again, the first one pretty new
I've seen people use the second one from time to time
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
or the you dead stare
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
And the answer to that question is no
I think everyone agreed that <:CarolShock:730816714345938956>  was gonna be reserved so we could make it better
Perfect for any fighting situation!
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/194203258485473280/736861721326518312/video0.mp4
<:ShirabeWhisper:620073899001905153> 
*slap*
when would you use <:BikkiFu:688190074738704394>  anyway? When you want to start a fight?
I've only seen<:BikkiFu:688190074738704394>  used like once
Hype miku stays!
okay. Miku is good then
maybe we could do something with one of these??
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864> <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
its like a, to be fixed/ used later emote
idk if that emote is giving me the middle finger or what <:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
their both good in their own way
Maybe the second one????
But I do admit half of them aren't used
I like all of hers
Oh Yeha. We haven't touched Chris yet
But the duo Shirabe and Kirka can (hopefully) stat
That's my opinion on Shirabes

Do I need nitro for the server? Because theirs nothing.
Its funny <:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
I want the first one to be a emote!
I know we just got rid of a ton of emotes but what about that miku frog I saw someone use the other day? üòÖ
idk
I'm my own bot!

genocide?
Is it like...
I want to see it
Picture?
<:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
As one whole command. Yes!
Orrrr !ReadyGo
Oh
what does the 6 parter look like?
If you made it into a bot commands would be better
That's low key ridiculous tbh
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
That's why we have this
We like adding them just as much as deleting them I guess
And wow that's a lot
Okay
<:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
ohhhhh
Where?
Its in the same case of. Good, but never used
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
What about this?
Bat girl can stay
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
Rarely to never used??? Idk
Plus it funny how the only emote of him is him suffering <:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
Yeah
or is he there just for the sake if being thereM
<:AdamScream:688241618356404224> 
?
Its the second to last one on the website
You have to scroll by about 10+ comics to find it
Phantas,
https://symphogear.blogspot.com/2017/01/symphogear-gxu-unlimi-blog-4-koma.html?m=1
Yes!
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>

Could you possibly edit the background out of this one?
<:ShirabeJoy:672105345316814878><:KirikaJoy:672105345342111785>
that Kirka is a good one
?
Like that?
Evil Hibki stan
Yes!
Oooo yes we need a edgy Hibki emote!
? Their is more emote potential in this one comic then I thought
oh
Really?

Miku peek? Or do we already have to many peeks?
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
Its hella blurry though <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
I found this Jojo Hibki a while ago
Or that
Or :Mikugod:
Because the protagonist of Tower of god always has the star eyes
:Mikuanime:
Because she's doing the anime eyes
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I personally like the first one better
<:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
Chris is low key cuter
And plus
But its also really good as a emote
We have the Chris one as a bot command
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
Its really the only "clear"/HD one, out of the ones we suggested.
What about this Miku BlackRaiden mentioned?
what about the noise and the "worst dad" one?
Theirs two Michas...
Okay
we have suggested like 10+ emotes üòÖ
How did you make it down to emote size?
Should.... Should we @ Lilly or Meulna  to see if they approve of the emotes?
Comic
? She shows up every know in then in the comics
???
better


She's the only one who doesn't have a emote



her hair is a little to big unfortunately

Dangit speech bubbles!!
Their are like 3-4 decent emote possiblitys here
I saw a decent Micha emote possibility earlier
I like how we just spent 2+ hours getting rid of like 10ish emotes and now were filling them back up right away <:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
Possible emote? If not the full thing. Then maybe just the noise?
Yeah...
I kindve agree with making a venting channel because their have been some stuff that I wanted to talk about in <#336297840529899522>  but I never did because someone was venting and I didn't want to mess with that or their was still some conversation about a previous serious discussion that I didn't want to ruin.
Some appreciation from me as well.
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968> <@106866895076003840> <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
And your art is really good!
Tbh. The new kissing emotes are perfect for anyone and anything <:Ver:704169051391524875>
I was kindve suggesting to just put it in the rules or MAYBe make an announcement about it.
Something like that? Or just say it in the rules.  I'm not really the best with handling this stuff.
Maybe you can do a warning or something in the rules/channel to let people know to try and not  get overheated. So at least people might keep that in the back of their heads.
Plus we got edgy Hibki
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
<:ChrisEmbarrassed:738167509869527060>
And so was this
Yes

<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>

<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Ohh
what dies padorus and  alogogous mean??
sooooo about the possibility of having a #kirifishcult channel??
<:KirikaFish:717138469381734471>
This is more of a joke request then anything but. Could you add a Kiri fish cult section? So us kiri fish cult members could worship our lord and savor Kiri fish.
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I just closed out of the app completely and then the rules showed
Its showing for me now

Smug??? I don't really know what expression it  does express tbh xd
So, what do you think of it?
Was that a question?
Soooooo what about carol Elfnein? I agree that its kindve meh though
I feel like that one is more of begging then happy Kiri
Vanessa crack remains supreme!
Yeahaa
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Possible emote? Vanessa crazy?/wack?
You know downscaled and all
That is currently winning by 1
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
Its a tie
the first one gives a whaaaaattt???/omg vibe but the second one, at least to me gives me a weird mixture between angry and something else.
The second one maybe?
<:KirikaGlee:698939825927094384>
<:ShemHaTilt:729980149529051156>
She looks completely Innocent *for once*
<:ElfneinPresents:691733046633955439>
Present/Shema smile???
Please make this a emote <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
That's the downside
By just making a different server that's just solely for emotes like the <a:aworryParryLR:469522907417018368> server
Theirs a way of getting around that though
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
What's the max amount of emotes a discord can possibly have?
<a:5625_remspin:545384263659552769>
I'm on mobile so idk how that would work
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Teach me oh wise radyiko <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Idk how to do that
Or the Tomosato one. (Which does not have Mikus hair in the way)
What ever Fujitaka is trying to express.
<:emoji_47:733414313620144138>
Mikus hair is still in the way....
thank you!
I also found this other one which is kindve meh. And Mikus hair and the credits are in the way! <:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>

Wait, I just realized this. But why is the role for Prelati Pink?
Yum swan song is more curse without a doubt
<:worryserenajam:703456839995490345>
That's the point <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
It's giving me the same nightmare fuel as the og
Yup
So its perfect!
That one is creepying me out a bit
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
It may just be because idk what this would even be used in. But how hasn't this nightmare fuel became a emote yet?
I draw a beta ish version of where I want it to cut and the app slightly alters it
Its like a semi auto function
Because that's what it did when I did cut into shape
<:emoji_20:645177180929916938>
Where????
Where?
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
it keeps cutting out the pink on the top left!
I'm also in the works of this
Ooo I like that one
Middle one or right one
This is more of a joke than anything. Carols XDU face in this just <:MikuHype:688429715676987428> it cracks me up. I know this should belong in <#407060923078017026> but its also a potential suggestion ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

<:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>

How do I watch the OVAs anyway? I know theirs some on the Symphogear official channel. But I feel like theirs more.
That's just what most of these Symphogear clips are subbed as. Its either Spanish or I *think* Korean.
Expect you know, a little shorter.

No, I was gonna ask if we could just have one role with all 3 of mechverse colors so we could just put it into one role or something<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Awww<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
~~if yes, you can probably tell what I'm going to ask next.~~

<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
We can talk about mechverse in <#336310266654490624>  or something like that if you would like<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>

In xdu, they these things called mechverse, which was basically the symphogear equivalent in that au. They even had their own form of ignite
This is kindve a joke request, but what if we add the mechverse rolls? Either based on their anime colors, or their xdu counter parts<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>

Not essentially, but it helps with trying to put in your Kirika emote<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>

Fair <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

No one uses any of the pixal emotes really, but we got permission from a artists that did them or something so that's what's keeping people from getting rid of them<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>

<a:KirikaTwirl:752996271702147162>
Yes, but this Yumi is for anime<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

Something along the lines of this Yumi face maybe??
This is kindve a joke submission, but we have three possible faces to chose from the Cag hydra<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>

Let me rewatch the video so I can take more<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

It could be because I have no sense of time anymore, but its feels like you've been here since the beginning <:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
I'm pretty sure a similar conversation to this happened around October<:Biki:718826874654031872>
I just want a bonk emote for me!! <:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
Can you make one of me? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:aukirikascared:800820536384421898>
What's your idea?
<:aumariasmug:800818205848895492>
I haven't gotten that far into making emotes yet
Or the comics?
From xdu?
<:aumariapout:800541287685685278>
*examples* <:ElfneinPresents:691733046633955439>

https://twitter.com/symphogear_XD/status/1349552064431595520?s=19
From the xdu comics, lete find the link real quick....
I don't even know if I CAN make moving emotes on my phone<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Can you invite me to the sever where you have that emote?
<:auShirabeanger:800102289406296074>
Other than the 2 emotes we already have, Vanessa doesn't really make any other good emotes faces
I have this thing that's kindve too simailr to <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829> tho. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Sounds good to me <:KirikaGlee:698939825927094384>
Agreed, ~~We can finally talk about the Disney shows we watched as kids~~<:emoji_12:645169206371024906>
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089> <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>

And personally I don't really care which one gets deleted/replaced <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Subtract 1 from the total of the first two emotes since I had to react with the two different sparkle emotes in order for people to react <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Vote which one to delete by selecting the reaction...
<:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714> <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
~~we could always sacrifice one of these two~~
Rady wants to throw a log in between you're legs <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Or a MikuLaugh since idk what she's hyped about, because when I think of hyped, I think of *this emote* <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Agreed! Two votes so far for replacing *this* <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939> with the other megane! <:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
I think I already suggested that idea fenny<:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
Alright.. Let me get the clip and post it in <#407060923078017026> <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
That's not how it works! <:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
Me too, like I know we have that emote but I forgot the name <:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
Does it even have a name? <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Yes Fenny, THAT thing! Now what's the name of it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I was half joking <:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
Kiriflex or Kiri(what ever the name of that glow up glasses meme is)
Unless if this gets moved to <#336300750248476693> or *a certain someone* @s everyone or @ here
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
I reacted with <:MikuHype:688429715676987428> to make it a poll fyi, I would like the changed name tho<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I thought that was you <:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
Mikulaugh Mikufunny Miku... What are other synonyms for laugh? <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
I blame auto correct <:MariaBully:689614085452464318>

Wow <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
What about the sparkle one?
Hmmmm ü§î
Yeha...
Here's a rough of what the cropped version looks like without the background btw.
I kindve like the background better since it makes you feel like theirs more people their supporting your birthday, but I'm also fine with the cropped ver
Not THAT kind of wink!! <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I was over thinking things <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Oh. Well that's easier. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Whos birthday would the bot react too? For the staff and other well know people in the sever? Because I would assume setting up a role or something for every individual persons birthday in the entire sever would be a hassle of it self
I was finishing my sentence right before you sent it! <:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
If squee is anything like squel then I know what it means. I have absolutely no clue what glomp means tho. Is it a biteing sound affect for something?
If she wasn't wearing the happy birthday sign, then *maybe* but eh <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
What on earth does glomp mean? <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
You would probably have to go over it with Mel. But the emote sever still has 10 more open emote slots I think.
And that
Someone would have to find good fin√® emotes first..
Isn't it suppose to be majority vote? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>

You don't have to make this an emote on the severs.. ~~I'm just gonna add it to my personal collection, don't mind me.~~

Not that I'm aware of, but if your trying to watch the rest of Symphogear. I can reccomend you this one pirate site I know.
Since I'm assuming you came her because of the game. You should check out <#336298054724485131> . They're are some nice people there that will help you out with stuff
<:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
Oh. And welcome to the discord! <:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
<:KirikaGlee:698939825927094384>
In that case I reccomend staying far away from <#336310266654490624> until you finish one season at least. Or @ one of the mods to give you a role that will help with not getting spoiled as easily
Because. Privatecy<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Its my discord account for my laptop. I need it to make putting in commands for this Pokemon thing easier to do since I'm on mobile <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<#336297387863703552> ,  <#567740255273222175> etc. Just avoid the chats that have "Symphogear" and "xdu" in they're names<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>

So cool!!! <:Mikuexcited:755559591760363552>
Is that a pun I seed? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
If I start having a Gundum addiction now, I blame you and that horse knight gundum I saw Xd
And their were also some like REALLY big ones I saw as well (I didnt get due to space) but they were like almost a foot tall or something, which is so cool! <:Mikuexcited:755559591760363552>
I can't wait to get home and start building it <:Mikuexcited:755559591760363552>

Welp good news for me, I found a store about 16miles away that has some <:Mikuexcited:755559591760363552>
Then that's probably what I'm gonna go with
And what's the difference between High Grade and Master Grade? Because idk a single thing about gundam <:Biki:718826874654031872>
The horse one looks really cool, so I kindve want to make/build one now <:Mikuexcited:755559591760363552>
One question, where do you get these Gundams? And how much are they usually?<:emoji_20:645177180929916938>
Awww, so cute! <:lobe:752227617934934158>

Was just about to send that!

Maybe because of G? Or because someone got inspired by that memoria card.
That's how cartoons and anime sbe NGL. Where if you wanna give off the impression that their married, make them look like siblings.

Should I call her "weaker than Serena" instead?
Isn't that how its spelled <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Now off to kill Fudo and Shema
Thank you.

That's a insult to pigs
Time to make some *beef*

I will kill Fudo one thousand times  after and killed a certain somehow and for what he did to Noble Red!

I never really got bored of Yokai watch though  since I always wanted to do me and didn't treat me like a 5 year old that had to be walked through the game and story

Ohhh so a "trap" refers to someone who looks like another gender but is actually another right? I can see why that's offensive now.
What does trap even mean anyway? I just thought trap meant like a innocent looking girl and turns out their 1,000 years old or something.
Their also banning the word "trick" I think
If you have medical experience and feel comfortable giving it. Then tell them. But if you don't and if its something kind of serious. Then tell that person to ask their doctor

Me! <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
Like I said I *think* the school is changing it up a bit now either due to more parents complaining about it, or the state got word of it I guess
And the school said the originally ( I'm only saying that because I think the school is changing) that if they weren't going to wear a mask by 2 days, or it was either 2 weeks( I can't remember) that they were just gonna basically force my brothers to do online learning
One of them really only have asthma they just refuse to wear a mask. Its not like we can really tell them to start doing a new routine aka wearing a mask because their autistic and are nonverbal, so its hard to communicate with them
> At this point if schools aren't being held remotely, that's negligence.
See there are two things happening. The only reason I know about these because my brothers go to a different school.
In MY school if you have a IEP you can go to school 4 days a week, and if you don't. You can only go to school for 2 days a week.BUT my brothers can't wear masks nor face shields due to them having asmatha and because they just don't due to them being autistic I guess, who btw each are supose to have 1 to 1 aids. And the school *was* neglecting them their education. So were kindve going through some shit with the school ATM. But I guess more parents in the county are complaining about it or something because their school is doing something about it now.
What about school? <:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>

I've heard Canada is nice with the whole cheaper collage and all
I kindve wonder why there is conflicting info though,
Because your either crazy, or something else actually happened if you shot someone 7 times for "reaching for a knife" (in my opinion)
I think shooting someone 7 times is *a bit* unnecessary, so many something else actually happened and that's why there's conflicting info???
Wait, so Rusten shot Blake SEVENE TIMES!?? just for "reaching for a knife"?
Fair point <:Biki:718826874654031872>

secondary school?? <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
How much you know, and how well you did your homework I think? I don't really know much about it other than it stands for "grade  point average"
What type of horror stories? Because every town and state has their own laws and stuff (with some schools doing illegal stuff) because I'm thankfully in a pretty good town. But I know their are some schools out there that are either, extremely poor and don't have the luxuries or other schools, or the staff do borderline  criminal shit.
Maybe I'm bugged by the fact that your encouraged to only use the word  because once or twice in the beginning and almost never used again?  And not the actual word?
Oh,
In what forms of media or books have you seen the word because?
Also the aid programs, or programs that help people who need help with certain things while learning or taking tests are good. And even programs that help special need kids are good, but that's also all I got.
Please, enlighten me <:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Now where do I start.... The constant forcing homework for student to do almost every day is not only just stressful, but  most of the information we learn is pretty much meaningless unless if you go into a certain job or filed. But yet they force you to take multiple classes at once. Which don't get me wrong. Learning the basics and improveing them like English, Global History, Science, Math, etc isn't a bad thing. It's a bad thing when you have to get a certain grades to move on. Or your deemed as a failure and have to retake the course(es). Also, this one class I have a certain thing with is ELA/English. Its where your suppose to learn how to write stuff right? Like essays and stuff (which you font usually write in real life that often) but. From the multiple articles and other things I've read online. You DONT USE THE WORD BECAUSE!! which is like one of the musy to words to use while writing an essay.
I could point out how the US education system needs change if you would like??

I mean in the server emote order. Not my most frequently used order
Are the emotes in reverse order for anyone else? I thought it was the weird discord update. But after downloading the apk they are still in reverse. For example the yumi stare emote is usually at the top for me but now its at the bottom.

theirs also a dub if you prefer dub

well if your into the fgo game and you want to follow the anime that follows the game then do what the second paragraph says
Its complicated. But I hope this will help

What's the name of this anime? I think its a dark magical girl show but I forgot the name.
Idk this anime!!
Explain
And what do you mean by " mannerisms"?
He's 19 then
He looks like he's in his 20s but idk if that's a school uniform or not sooooo
what did you expect? ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
We have 1,000+ year old waifus that look like 5
Its anime.
Why do I want to see that now
<:FineShocked:672430513025187840>
*wat*
Surprisingly. Yes
That's the actual name of it?

Becuase I'm with you
Nope

<:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
<:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
I watched like either 4-13 episodes on YouTube because I didn't know about priating sites.
> Do you want to look it up
Yes and no
I know I'll probably regret this. But how can a nail scene be so bad?
Higarashi is the anime with infamous nail scene right?
Visual Novel?
VN?
Isn't this that murder anime?
https://youtu.be/D2ESrHb6utY
I mean... I already know about 3 "twist" about the show
|| pink hair girl aka the mc gets turned into a god or something at the end. The strong back hair girl realizes she's been a witch all along annnd the yellow one dies|| that's really all I know.
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
Time to watch madoka magical girl for the first time.
I just finished episode 9. So should I just watch the rest of Magia Record? Or stop and watch the og?
Or any major  deaths
That's why I haven't seen that black haired girl with glasses yet
<:emoji_50:718826874654031872>
No
<a:KirikaSob:725756440463147048>
I'm watching episode 9 of madoka magical girl. And these two are just so sad
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Its really Hibki huh<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I saw that <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
> Can't be, she's homophobic.
I see what you mean now
Miku?!!???
Did they not dub Madoka S1? Because when I looked on this one other pirating site. It only has the dub for Madoka Reco
Really??? I thought madoka was in 2015. Or maybe that's  just when it got  really popular
> That's Aoi Yuuki first major role.
What about Symphogear
Hold up. I hear Hibki in this one
> Because it's good.
Fair enough
> Watch order : Madoka S1 => Madoka S1 a second time => Rebelion movie => Madoka S1 + Rebelion again!
Why do I have to watch it so mnag times?
> Magia Record is a spin off.
That's the one that I watched (almost finsied) first.
There's only 12 episodes<:emoji_50:718826874654031872>
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
Which one do I watch first?
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Hibki is fine because she will just become edgy biki. Edgy Biki at least seems mentally stable, just anti social. Tsubasa on the other hand....
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Madoka needs her own Miku emotional support
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
And they both experience a lot of trauma
I only just started watching OreGairu. But what is Ryuos work about??
I have never heard of Ryuos Work
Should I delete the other image as well?
Ohhhh nevermind
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
The TV version you sent seems to be it. Thank you! <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Looking through the comments on sound cloud. It looks like 
A. They copy righted the song
B. They did a revamp as well
Like a slight pitch difference or something.
It just sounds different though <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
This I think
https://soundcloud.com/kurokuu/magia-arrange-ver-puella-magi?ref=clipboard
No, the song they play through the episodes at the ending.
Because when I try to find it up on SoundCloud. It either sounds a bit different or the song is sped up for some reason.
What's the name of the song that plays during the end of Madoka magica that goes eeee eee!!!
Because its amazing
Yay! <:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
Okay. Just skimmed through the first two movies, they are both literally just recaps but the 3rd seems too have some new stuff (I hope)
The first one seems like a recap
> Watch order : Madoka S1 => Madoka S1 a second time => Rebelion movie => Madoka S1 + Rebelion again!
<@114081181611458563> 
Which one would that be?
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
I just finished puella Magi S1
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Like is it magic?? Is it anime logic?? What is it <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Is their going to be a 4th Magica movie??? It just left off in a cliff hanger<:KirikaMad:688188152891834417>
I completely skipped the recap movies once I realized they were recaps üòÖ
?
Its fascinating
In the anime, how did they draw the witch's and stuff anyway? It looks like a completely different style
Thank you! <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>

Dangit
And I really wanted to see a movie of where they left off at the end of the season where ||Homaru has a bow now for some reaso and with the new enemy's,|| but this will do.
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Its something to do with the nightmares, isn't it
<@278860841485598720>  did they just not animate the other faces in the 3rd movie or something?

Oh wow, that opening is a lot different from the dubbed version scene/vocals I remember<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Its first season was good (and maybe the 2nd season but i dont remeber the seasons right) but then I started watching the season where Sprizen was evil or something a bit less. And then when they introduced that red guy with Achilles or something, I stopped watching it because I started to grow out of it<:Biki:718826874654031872>
I don't remember the names of the Beyblade serie's at all. Minus Beyblade Burst because they said its name "BeyBlade Burst" in a cool/ catchy way in the theme song<:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
Wait, did you watch that season after Beyblade that had Benki and Ginga in it when they were older, with new characters and stuff?<:emoji_20:645177180929916938>
Because I always thought he was a guy but the voice kept throwing me off a bit<:MikuHype:688429715676987428>

Mhm
The goat? <:MikuHype:688429715676987428>

Agreed
The LBX one (at least for me) sounded good, their just wasn't a whole lot of emotion<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I think I saw, Tenkai Knights, then Pokemon, then LBX, then unvoa Pokemon season
> 2013
Wait really?<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Because I honestly feel/think that Tenkai Knights was my first anime ever<:Biki:718826874654031872>
When did Tenkai Knights come out anyway? 2010-2012?<:emoji_20:645177180929916938>
The dub for Tenkai Knights was surprisingly really good.

Why would people go psycho mode?
And then they decided to STILL hold onto the licence for it even though they weren't using it?
Wasn't their also that one time where Funi only dubbed 3 episodes of this one anime called "inter species reviewers" I think. Where they stopped the dub due to "the anime does not fit our guildlines" even though they have worse stuff on the site, AND there was a censored version. And then funimation decided to copy strike clips and episodes of it on YouTube, and even on ||Corn Hub||??

<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I guess? <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Its a american Cartoon. <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
And I recommended Avatar the Last Bender even tho its not an anime <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Okay.. Since they wanted to watch something I already watched. I reccomended fate stay night, and LBX since that was one of the first anime I watched. So LBX just came to mind
Trust me. I asked <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
And thoes are the only ones they told me. Their up to watch pretty much anything tho since there new too anime
Harry Potter and Star wars
Also. My friend is asking me for anime recommendation, and they haven't watched a whole lot of anime. Any suggestions for beginners?
What's the name of this anime?
  https://youtu.be/JRmgL564x8E
I thought this was Fujimaru and Hassan in his cloak. But its actually Fujimaru and Mash apparently<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
I would guess <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Whats the name of that anime? It looks interesting
Yep. Their biologically a boy, but in order to have twin tail powers and crap (idk its been awhile). They turn into a girl I think?
The only type of "boob missle" I know of is Vanessa from Symphogear
I don't remember that at all <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Twintails is a fun short anime to watch, I reccomend it if you just wanna have a fun quick watch
Look, when I was young (and before I knew about piracy)  I only watch what was on the TV/ at the time, and YouTube. Okay <:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
If at all.to be fair I watched the dub on YouTube so maybe that's why
I don't even remember it having that much of a ending<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Shirabe is a magical girl with twintails. She's practically made for the show <:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
Imagine if Shirabe was in the Twin Tail verse. <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Has the author of Twin written any funny anime like Twin Tails that got an anime?
He really does have a thing for twin Tails tho, that is kindve concerning how much he's into them <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>

Welp<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
What anime is that from?<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
Although. I'm pretty sure the koala bear is a available to get in the game. Not sure about the whale thing
This didn't happen in the YW3 anime, nor game. So its kind of its own thing
Its made by Level 5 itself so<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
