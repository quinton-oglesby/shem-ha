We don't, leave Hibiki's hidamari out of this.
OVA miku <:yummy:235243310086750208>
It'd have to be a major arc and with 13 episodes they can only focus on so much
It'd definitely require some good writing and a good reasoning behind her actions. But the whole mind control thing feels more like a cop out. More tension is always good.
No sarcasm, it'd work!
Sure, a scenario where you don't quite know why Miku turned evil as opposed to; Yeah, she's being controlled by the bad guy again.
Though it'd be quite the twist
Miku too pure and loving to suddenly turn evil
