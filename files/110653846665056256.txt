I swap frequently it depends on what my most recent watched is
No the first pic was kirika and shirabe with Terriermon and Tailmon
Shirabe with Tailmon is super cute too,,
Oh damn Cherubimon doesnt get much play these days
Not complaining! It was also this weird neat thing that a childhood love crosses over with a current one

It may not seem like a lot but you being very friendly and helpful the other day when I was asking about XDU stuff helped me feel very welcome to actually interact with the server.
You would be missed, the little things help
Awesome!!
Those are the important goods
But glad youre about to be in a safe place
Admittedly its a tedious part of packing
Thats a fair cop
Thats my cautionary tale
But yes that was long winded but check your name meaning before you submit official papers
It was going to be just Carver but then I saw another woman named Lauren Reeves and went "what if both"
https://s3.amazonaws.com/AMDProductImages/73-50.jpg
A Reeves-Carver
Nope
Nope
lord no haha
I wonder if anyone can guess it
Pfft
Like 5 months after my name change had been approved my dad goes
 "You know thats dentist tool"
Dont be me and pick two neat sounding last names, hyphenate them, and end up with A FCUKING DENTISTRY TOOL
They will certainly try to contact you in future but its a breather for now
Hopefully this means they will let up on harassing you for the time being
Took about 48 hours till it stuck
Its gonna be a rough first few months, if you want I can list some other stuff to look out for here or in DMs
Oh you should go for them just remember you might not fit them in a few months time. The replacement of the wardrobe + going through 5 sizes in a year is the worst bit but you usually stabilise about 14 months in and can start picking a certian size from there
Also I would really, really, REALLY recommend getting more baggy and going for comfort over style with your first few picks becauyse your body shape will be changing a lot within the first 6-14 months and its better to grab stuff thats not as form fitting
Clothing sizes will be different for every single company and I HATE IT

If the site has a size chat then work out your bust and the length of the top first because alot of cis women have short torsos so even though some stuff will fit, it will show your belly button as soon as you move your arms from your sides.
Also I second the wearing feminine clothes in private, helps you work out whats comfortable for you and as time goes on the HRT will really work in your favor. You'd be surprised how much slimming and softening happens. It really strips down masculine features to fill out your hips, butt and breasts.
Your gonna want at least a wireless fabric one because nipples get really sensitive really fast

This is funny because its a legitimate coping mechanism
Yeah It all just sort of clicks into place and you feel content
Its all a shifting scale honestly so just go with makes you feel best
<@99695384296701952> Gender-fluid is a term that could fit
Thats amazing
Omg was it an entire super hero team

My doctor has that on the wall of her office and i crack a smile every time i see it, the poster is like 2meters tall

I wonder if Condoman exists in heroaca as a sex ed hero
Umi's a good bluenette
Its really familiar but Im struggling to put a name to it
Actually it looks like Heroine Chronicle came out after G finished airing
nvm 2 years after lol
Super Heroine came out a few months after S1 iirc
Ive been waiting for that doujin game for like 2 years now im so excited its done
Too many QoL improvements
Ngl Ive yet to go back to 4/Gen after playing MHW so im worried I wont enjoy them at all
Wait im thinking about Gen
I should probably boot it back up since I plan on getting a switch later this year
I do but I have not touched it in over a year
Ive preordered MHW on PC, even tho i have 220 hours on PS4 im excited to get in again
It only took like 10 years but I think BBTag is whats finally gonna get me to learn fight games
Prays for your pulls
Also I should mention the only things I touch in the Bnet launcher are WoW, D3 and Destiny2
NA/EU split is for every game sadly
The NA/Eu split still makes no sense
Caelstraz-Oceanic but its grouped with NA and since you can inv anyone on your region it doesnt matter much these days
Also if anyone wants to add on Bnet im Ephillia#1905
I mean I already was but now Im REALLY pumped
Im so pumped for BOFA now
FOR THE ALLIANCE
The new WoW pre-patch content is ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ‘Œ

Also Blizzard just stealth confirmed theyre working on "Multiple Diablo Projects" with "more shown off later this year" ....
Diablo 4 at blizzcon???

Big Yikes
Wasnt it mostly melee players being shits at EVO this year
SSBU for Evo2k19
Im laughing at every single QoL, UI and game mechanic change being designed specifically to kill Melee

IT IS TIME
Ive read Before the Storm but been lazy about Good War and Elegy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Em642GO80
Also I forgot but Nobble made a cliffnotes video
Oh also the two novellas that come with the physical CE are up on the blizz site
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/story/short-story/a-good-war
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/story/short-story/elegy
the Old Soldier one is really nice since its one of the pixar-quality cinematics we usually only get as expansion intros
He got really fucked up so hes gonna be in a hospital bed for a few months
Oh he survived
Sure fuckin is
Sargeras is the Dark Titan and leader of the Legion
Argus is the planet the Draenai came from originally
But yes thats all we have atm and BfA launches next tuesday
HMMMM
But hes kind of chill about it since he fucking hates Sylvanas as Warchief
Oh yeah also Saurfang tries to take all the Alliance on by himself and gets taken as a prisoner of war
(horde one happens before the alliance ver)
Jaina shows up and saves us all, we push into the city and take down a few commanders and then it comes to a head in the Throne Room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M-kjkJajtA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVlZzJngUKE
So Alliance is charging the Undercity and then Sylvanas goes "Hmm we seem to be losing, how about I PULL A PUTRESS" and dumps the Undead Plague on everyone including Horde soldiers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7O2d0FO3_M
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW_h0qf9vpA
Required Watching:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo7XPvwRgG8
So this week the Alliance attacked The Undercity because FUCK THE HORDE basically even tho its really Sylvanas
Basically the plan was always kill Malfurion and kill the hope of the Night Elves/Alliance.
Sylvanas has a fuck you moment and decides to burn down a world tree and kill hundreds of thousands of civilians.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVp7yLfnmrE
The invasion of Ashenvale and then Dark Shore is a bloody one reminicent of Garrosh's push into Ashenvale during the Cataclysim. Civilians are casualties unless Varok Saurfang (daddy) is leading the charge. Saurfang is constantly uneasy about the whole thing. The whole point of this invasion is that Sylvanas doesnt believe that peace will last more than a year and wants to strike now.
Eventualy its comes to  a head with a Mak'gora between Saurfang and Malfurion. Malfurion has the upper hand but Sylvanas shows up and shoots him with one of her bullshit undeath arrows. 
Saurfang says this isnt honorable. Sylvanas says she doesnt give two shits and goes back to the army telling Saurfang to finish the job.
Tyrande shows up and tells Saurfang to back the fuck off, he does and they hearth out.
And then this shit happens.
https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/wowpedia/thumb/0/0a/Teldrassil_Burning.jpg/1200px-Teldrassil_Burning.jpg
After this the tensions over Azerite (Azeroths blood) as a resource heat up. Sylvanas sends a decoy force to Silithis where the Sword got plunged into, Alliance thinks they need to stop Sylvanas from getting a strangle hold on the resource. Turns out Sylvanas is really going to attack and Capture Teldrasil.
The meeting gets the go ahead from Sylvanas, but she suspects something is up. The familys meet, theres alot of hugging and crying and I missed yous, its all very sweet. Calia is there with Fowl as a intermediary from the Priest Order Hall (all order halls are faction neutral). One of the Forsaken that was in the Lordaeron Royal Guard recognizes her and approaches her "We are ready to serve you my Queen"  and a bunch start heading to the Alliance camp.
Sylvanas cracks her shit "How dare they defect" and sets her Dark Rangers on them, only killing Forsaken and not harming a single Alliance person.
Calia also gets killed. But she later gets raised as a light aspected undead by a Na'ru so shes fiiiiiiine.
Then youve got the pre-expansion story:
In the book Before the Storm, Anduin gets the idea to set up a meeting between Lordaeron citizens that are still living and any Forsaken family members they still have.
This idea is put forward to the Forsaken by Alonsus Fowl, the dude who created the Paladins of the Silver Hand but died to the scourge, who is now the leader of the Priest Order Hall.
Also with him when he talks to Anduin is Calia Menethil, Arthas's big sister, the hier to the throne of Lordaeron.
Now with a big fucking sword in her Azeroth isnt feeling too peachy and is screaming bloody murder. We dump all the power from the Artifacts we built up over the expansion into the wound and heal it up so its not evil energy pouring into her anymore.
What also happens is that the pure lifeblood of Azeroth herself starts bubbling to the surface and crystallising. When you hold a piece of it you feel like youre at 300%. Weariness goes away, your mind becomes clear youre above peak condition.
Anduin, now king goes "We can basically cure cancer with this, this is amazing"
Sylvanas, now Warchief goes "We can make the Atom bomb and kill the Alliance, this is amazing"
After we beat Argus this plays out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhfvc2kxX1g
All the while this is happening if you look to the sky theres this evil ass looking cloud coming off of Argus and starting to send red lighning down onto Azeroth. Khadgar calls Illidan a dipshit because he basically put Azeroth RIGHT next to Sargeras to attack. At the Seat of the Pantheon the Titans sit in thier chairs and we summon the World Soul of Argus, hes a screamy boy since he spend the last few centuries having his planet torn apart by Fel magic. We do this because Sargeras was planning to use Argus as a new body and then convert Azeroth into a Dark Titan before she hatched.
Thanks to a Holy Infused Dreadlord from the Paladin and Priest class quests we know that Turaleon and Alleria are still alive and have been fighting with the Army of the Light for the past 3000 years since Twisting Neather fucks with time like that.
Velen makes a new Draenai spaceship and we all go to Argus. After some ground skirmishes we discover that the titan Eonar is still alive and needs our help. So we raid the Legion HQ on Argus and take down a bunch of high ranking generals and captians. Eonar then reveals that none of the Titans died, they just released thier souls from thier bodies and Sargeras has spend the last few millenia torturing said souls to make them evil dark Titans like himself. Only Aggramar has submitted so far. We kill the high ranking Shivara torturing the Titan souls and free them, then we beat up Aggramar till he see sense and then we all port to the Seat of the Pantheon.
Theres some individual Zone questlines but they all end in get a Pillar of Creation which is a Titan relic and we need all 5 to seal off the Tomb of Sargeras. Pillar #5 is at the top of the Nightborne city, theyre in bed with the Legion now so we storm the city and take it over/liberate it from the Legion. Gul'dan is at the top and is trying to use Illidan's corpse-in-a-crystal as a vessel for Sargeras. We kill him off and interrupt the ritual, Illidan is back in his body (the boy is back). We then make a new staging point on the Broken Shore to attack the Tomb with more success this time. Storm through the tomb, kill the Fel-Infused leftovers of the old Sargeras Avatar and chase a just arrived Kil'jaeden back onto his spaceship, and fucking murder him while Argus is in the distance. Velen has a touching last moment with his brother. Illidan uses a portal crystal McGuffin from the Demon Hunter class quest to rip open a spacetime fissure so that Azeroth and Argus are in each other orbit. Khadgar then portals us back to Azeroth and Argus is now in the sky.
Okay so Gul'dan from Alt Draenor came to our main timeline, opened up the portal  in the Tomb of Sargeras (from WC1 and 3) massive legion invasion kicks off.
Alli and Horde assault the Broken Shore which is the stretch of land the Tomb is on. Tirion Fordring gets murdered in front of everyone by a massive demon. Alliance opt to charge the Tomb from the front while the Horde takes the ridge above for air support and to come around on the flank.
Horde gets blindsided by legion portals that start cleaning them up. Vol'jin takes a mortal blow and goes down, he tells Sylvanas to "Do not let the Horde die dis dae" so she calls a retreat. Although up on the ridge they are getting DECIMATED, back on the ground Alliance see it as the Horde abandoning them and they also call a retreat. As people are boarding an airship to escape an Fel Reaver (the giant mechs from outland) crashes down and grabs on, Varian does the hero thing and jumps off, shadow of the collussus's it and ends up dying from being swarmed by demons.
Khadgar says Horde and Alli need to work together and petitions the Kirin Tor to let the Horde back into Dalaran so they can use the city as a orbital platform/base/thing. Jaina says fuck this and peaces out after the coucil votes to let the Horde back in.

Cygames has legalised bloodshed for a new age of Waifu Wars
Also Jacqueline that OW post is really bad holy shit.
There are too many pc elitist shitbags
What the acutal fuck is that gameplay mechanic
Just wanna chime in and say MHW PC running on an SSD single handedly killed any desire to go back to the PS4 version.
Load times are basically under a second and quests are ready to depart instantly
Switchaxe was alot of fun But I Cannot Dodge
I used to CB alot but then I worked out guard tech and learnt to hop properly
I usually main Lance but GL is really strong in the early game
Hence the Gunlance
Pukei stuff is very cute but im a tanky lass
BTW Rathian layered armor
I adore the giant plate mail skirt
My goal for Day 1 of MHW PC has been achived
