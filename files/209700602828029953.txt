I lowkey want to live in some micronation
that's because all countries want to keep their right to print currency with no limit whatsoever
like USDT
If y'all understand ‰∏≠Êñá that page outlines the advantages of digital renminbi
https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%97%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%91%E5%B8%81
I've read on reddit that mastercard and visa payments are sustainable (if you use NFC over plastic) and will soon reach a zero carbon footprint since they are powered by sustainable energy.
What FIAT currency do you hold ? Just to put that in perspective
Yea but ppl will want out of that system when they see their savings lose value by means of the money printer
take Tuvalu as an example
you're screwed
words are more powerful than GUNS
The main value apple products provide is not physical, not even their software quality or security. Their core purpose is to make the user feel primus inter pares since they're holding a luxury item
the back up plan for this is just go back to hunting-gathering
https://www.newscientist.com/article/2289763-why-has-el-salvador-officially-adopted-bitcoin-as-its-currency/
you can use it tho
Yes !
I guess it's designed to fail, but could work
but if I have to be honest, I dunno what would happen if you've got a critical mass of taxpayers coalescing around a particular change.org proposition
Lowkey, yes
You can achieve the same with enough exposure, using tools like change.org
I'm not against it tho
The system that ensures the taxpayer's decision power is as rigged as wrestling
no way you're gonna convince enough taxpayers for that, or make it profitable
who's paying for that grid resilience overhaul ?
<:ElfneinMunch:688190074285850728>
like this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AquAdvantage_salmon
we should invest our time into developing genetically engineered livestock, prepared in advance for that
yeah
there is no backup for industrial society, some way or another we shall return to gathering
There's really no alternative to being with. All mediterranean countries depend on the EU and have invested so much to transform their economies following EU demands. Same with Poland, Hungary, etc.
<:HibikiShock:726645026725167114>
I know
I find very unusual that a pro-independence party like Lega Nord managed to hold government.
But the roles have reversed in many places
Theoretically
I keep going back over this. Don't know no one that would be willing to fund an independent union
the odds aren't good
That may be just nostalgia
BUT
Such a cult has formed around the Iron lady
this is it I think
Unions just become branch offices of said party
In most examples, it evolves into the latter
The problem then is just how to mantain the unstable system that stems from unions mantaining their power over a party, without it developing into a massive weak point or the party just controling the unions under the table
It's more of a tradition for them
France just defaults to civil disobedience periodically
Nah
I mean give it a couple years and you won't be talking about fat north korean but fit north korean
he's getting fit
he ain't dying anytime soon
They kinda dropped this idea after that, right ?
Noone is justifying Israel's actions but themselves
But that's to be expected of any yihadist group
The barbarians at the start of your CIV campaign
It's like some wild force of nature
Yea
Didn't knew they wanted in
sike
Well, Greece did some funny math in order to get in
That can be arranged for them
They sure wanna be a member
that's more realistic
Turkey could be sooner than Isreal
If they fail to prove their point, that's gonna keep us tightly knit
yeah
not having euro also means some commodities will be way harder to import
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
etc
buy their products, don't step into their turf
but in order to get that joozy $$$ you need to do what they think it's best for you
alimoney
haha
The frontier isn't gonna protect you
The funny thing is that if some central explodes in Lyon, you're in for the blast
They want us to buy
France wants to sell, they don't want others producing nuclear energy
That's why nuclear energy is not much developed outside of France, and some countries like Spain seek to stop and disarm all nuclear centrals by 2030
That's the norm, yes
That's nonsense
The investment is not where it needs to be
I mean it doesn't actively seek to secure resources that are vital for future energy development
I don't think it has so much potential
He's getting serious now
y I knew about these two scripts
yes
they've had nothing like the Mediterranean for developing their own culture
ye and that's it
barbarians doesn't spawn near your capital ?
this is the consensus as far as i know
well you get out of stone age when you develop your own writing system and most of them didn't have any
Africa was nearly in the neolithic period at the beginning of the eighteenth century
There are some countries that need that efficient and despotic leadership because there's really no alternative in the modern world available to them
but helping nonetheless
not ¬´helping¬ª as in charitable help üÜò
which is something the west would never allow them to do
they're helping Africa build an industry of their own
lol
mostly the UK
they had their own problems
China is better for Africa than the west has ever been
all excuses sound like that
there's always a destabilizing dictator or some massive weapons to dispose of
true dat
that's Occam's razor for you
same with jp economy
china won't reveal their true power
it's like when everybody says that US military is vastly superior to china
well maybe that economy value has ben engineered
what is that
even intranational spread cannot be avoided in most countries
is that a logistical or political problem ? IMHO it's more of the former than the latter
that's what I was trying to say earlier
the effects of industrial society were highly perilous for the aboriginal population
i just learned of mesopotamia s own system when I discovered duodecimal system
didn't knew
yeah time is measured like that
there are cultures like mesopotamia which count units of space in base 60 but we can't measure anything in such a system, we use the metrical system
I know, but we're bounded to use western development as the general rule
you've still got people like joisan,  nambikwara, etc which live in some sort of Paleolithic era
that's worse
when the Berlin's conference was celebrated in 1855 the most part of subsaharian Africa didn't knew any writing system
i was just thinking about subsaharian Africa
my mistake
Africa wasn't underdeveloped until recent times
you're right
they weren't*
Africa is a continent yet you only have these two scripts and they're not extensively adopted
the possibilities with blockchain are endless
https://www.ledgerinsights.com/china-explores-using-blockchain-for-digital-yuan-cbdc-issuance/
think ~5,10 years in advance
or paypal
most modern blockchain can be as eco as SEPA transfer
this eco aspect only affects certain types of blockchain networks (mainly the the first gen)
classic forms of entertaiment are still pure and untainted, tho
and why there's only three classes and no heal/support ?
where'd you put the limit from mid to high class ?
where I live, there is an infinitesimal amount of them who do not benefit from rent because they are required by law to keep the same rent price they agreed in 1970, but that's just some paperwork screw-up and not the norm, most landlords are baby boomers who get a huge revenue from it
that keep popping out of nowhere in most major cities
like those capsule hotels
yeah
those definitions are too vague nowadays
in the modern world there's people who don't have to plan the money but have a lesser net worth than many workers
let me fetch smth real quick
if we can find some common ground upon which define what is middle class
you know what would be cool ?
ÂÅöÂæóÂ•ΩÔºÅ
comments like this ain't gonna help you get social credits
in fact, mining is a hell of a deal for tax authorities since it's more heavily taxed than the regular x5 in any altcoin
gamers are the most oppressed by crypto oligarchs' hoarding of GPU
then 10 more
but wait 5 more years
most people who are into crypto just want their lambo and haven't read any whitepaper
I get your point but that's just biased
your best bet is to evade through paperwork and financial engineering
you won't evade by getting into crypto
for State-Level actors it's relatively easy to trace everything that's not monero
and the best reason to focus criticism on crypto is that is almost as bad as the other things we don't mind most of the time because they were here when we were born
people there ain't rich by any standard
take El Salvador as an example
crypto is maybe even more within they reach
yes but any investment is kinda out of reach for the vast majority of people living on poverty levels
https://micky.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/B_2uSuYVAAEF8iR.jpg
and they're both bad for you
because regular soda existed before
it's like criticism on sugar-free soda
if it's as evil as the current system, why so much criticism on some underdeveloped ¬´new evil¬ª like crypto, then ?
<:CarolBlush:617039657896509460>
and we're funding it
but green energy isn't either
not in its current state, no
I always thought that some tech like blockchain could be used for electronic voting, making the process fail-proof and easy to verify
cold wallets maybe
how to keep your funds SAFU in case of solar flare ?
how'd you survive a solar flare and keep your digital currency
No technology is inherently good or evil
EU chose not to pay any attention to those numbers
well they forged their numbers to get into it
too
Greece
yay
you have monero tho
the multi-speed europe approach is not exactly homogeneus, and that's what the founders envisioned
they just assume is bad and dangerous but let's keep buying it
ah, where I'm from, nuclear energy is never discussed by left parties
making nuclear plants is seen as right-wing in most southern EU countries innit ?
but that fear of Chernobyl 2.0 is spread and empowered by the ones who want to keep you buying their power
same as Spain
why must nuclear energy be produced solely in France ?
we could produce other things
nice backup in case of solar flare
well belgium does many things
they're the EU higher ups tho
I agree that greece has been saved many times during recent history by EU powers, for being the cradle of knowledge and all the historical value it has, but EU has not been their salvation
all it takes is a corona to crash that system
well japan is earthquake headquarters so they may get some leverage
>carbon
what's that ?
because if someone else produces it then it's cool
also when I'm too lazy to cook dinner I just microwave a potato
afterwards, they take way less time in the frying pan / oven / whatever
mainly mushrooms
I use microwave to pre-heat some foods
But maybe that's just me and my hate for catch-all terms like "hate".
I think the ¬´hate¬ª in hate speech laws is misleading and vague. It looks like one of those disclaimers written in obscure legalese that can be interpreted any way it suits your interests. You already have sex & race discrimination laws, you don't need to englobe all that in one big law.
when they're problematic
live artists pose more of a problem
that doesn't prevent me from enjoying the books
but since he's long dead
I just discovered he wrote some racist ass poems when he was a teen
or Lovecraft
ah
they don't even know the original actor's voice
most people worldwide only see dubbed movies
imagine not knowing the personal life of each and every actor
it should be dead simple to calculate, not a holy mess
exactly
tax evasion rates have never been higher
taxation here isn't too high, the problem is that you're treading on thin ice and that there is a lotta people who isn't filling their vat as they should
that documents all practices inside the tax office
and btw there's a documentary made by independent journalists
they're done that way on purpose
the vat filling manuals are full of verbiage and ambiguous advice
fully flat?
in my country
this has happened
and you can get stabbed in the back +4 years later because they decided to retroactively change vat policies
but yes, VAT can be a nightmare in here without deep knowledge
at least here
afaik VAT returns are filled at no cost for people under 30k‚Ç¨ a year
almost any executive over X age thinks no one is supervising their work phone/tablet
lol
you have some investment or retirement fund or something like that
how's that ?
let's make those numbers look good
yeah
people outside of their community do not count as unemployed either, etc..
so each year you have 174000 people sitting a test for some position like civil servant janitor service, only 1500 are selected but the rest do not count as unemployed
in here, uni students and people studying to secure a place as a civil servant do not count for unemployment stats
every country knows how to diminish unemployment
at least the employment rate is adequate in Pl
that's awful
it means the average Joe is tremendously lost in the political or economical reality he's living in
but that stubbornness usually is bundled with a lotta other red flags forming a well known ensemble
only learning through trial & error
there's not redemption for that stubbornness
it's like measuring people in millimeters
when the cheapest item you can find in a store (i.e. bubblegum) costs 20,000 (notice the 0000) then that's pure nonsense
it looks bad to me
even the name suggests it's not good
how do people get hooked on inflation ?
how can they believe that inflation is good ?
I tend to misplace noun-adjective order
sorry
AI
our hands are bound until the robots come here to sort it all out
that is, until IA can narrow them down more efficiently, paying attention to past jobs, experience, adequateness...
yes, uni degrees are made to narrow applications when there's a ton of them
they won't risk to lose those popularity points on a plan to curb inflation
even when they know they're wrong
govmints tend to be conservative in this regard
that's too much complicated
should be annual
that shouldn't go into everyday commodities
it's never been this high
if you look at the VAT in common goods
yes
IQ and psychoanalysis, are biased and flawed (from the beginning) theories that hold some amount of truth
> The German psychologist William Stern (1871-1938) introduced the idea of intelligence quotient, or IQ
I don't think many ethnicities were applying for top schools in germany in that age
but it's done its job
biased towards western civilization aight
is the best horseshit available
there are different metrics
?
just plain IQ
what type of intelligence
you can't be seriously denying all this
eyesight worsens with age, hearing worsens with age
in this case it does imply causation
no
you get big enough groups of the same age and you measure what you want to compare
the process of measure is the same
hearing loss vs age
the variable is age there
but it is to age
you can argue that the interpretation is biased

they are done statistically
https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/high-frequency-hearing-loss
just by observing general frecuency audition vs age
but you get a pretty significant metric
all human stats are muddied, audition too (people who go to concerts with loud music vs people who don't)
it does
in the end, individual samples don't matter
> the central limit theorem (CLT) establishes that, in many situations, when independent random variables are summed up, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution
yes but we are considering all people
they are kind of done
or max kHz of audition/age
like joint elasticity/age
you only need to observe the general population's performance
none
both are kind of needed really
the know-how and book-smarts is crystalized INT

it does
it's a good point to start making your own decissions

25-ish
mainly because the human body stops developing at that point
18 is a milestone for many things, not just voting
once you hit 18 your rights and responsibilities get a major update
for example
but your interests change
it doesn't automagically sharpen some intelligence areas and dulls others
age is not a determinant factor
but you may have other age-associated problems that alter your performance
yes
but there's got to be some method which is more than appropriate to explain the differences between the brain of a child, an adult or an elderly person
ideally you can't
just guess the next triangle shape
but it's the same dog with a different collar
it's not iq testing
funnily enough, they use it in some real testing here (police) to remove participants
agreed
then ?
how do you measure intelligence differences between children and adults
it's been abandoned ?
that doesn't disprove that loss of eyesight can be measured with it
yes
for an english speaking optometrist, using this eyesight test would be ridiculous
this eyesight test is culturally oriented too, it's latin alphabet yes, but take it at 8yo and then at 80yo and you can see you get a different score
doesn't disprove that
or it's not perfect
ot was used for racist purposes
the fact that is culturally centered
my original point was that it helps in observing a difference between fluid and crystallized intelligence when taken at different stages by the same individuals
you wouldn't find the same exact testing in europe and asia or africa
but that's just expected behaviour, non western countries (even non english speaking countries) are mostly non-involved in developing these type of IQ tests bc they use different measures
and I don't think that's the case nowadays
at some point, all intial validity dropped to the ground when that testing was hijacked and used to sterilize indigenous population
but that wasn't the purpose it was comissioned or developed for
That's the history of the IQ test, at a later stage it was weaponized
they had all the validation they wanted through other fallacies
but the test wasn't invented to offer some validity to that
ofc they considered themselves better.
or any relevance at all
that somehow has something to do with this discussion
these people (the ones who invented the test) wouldn't even consider examining non-whites
and most americans were self-centered and had little to no regard towards black population
I don't think they had that intention in mind, the world wasn't globalized yet and most cultures were self-centered by that time, there was not a struggle between white and "non-white" culture but between *orthodoxy* and everything else
> Binet would never have accepted that the test he designed as a practical guide to identifying slow learners who needed special help would soon be used as a numerical measure of inherited intelligence.
sometimes they do by peer presure or if their boss calls out the operation
but at the end, you depend on just one physician who is given your case and they can back down any time
there are a few steps, like psych eval & your case being reviewed by a guarantee commission
if there's no doctor that wants to perform the injection, they could be could just limit themselves to monitoring the operation, and have it carried out by another health practitioner
and literally unable to live
even if you're in excruciating pain
if they refuse, you have to go back to the starting point (this has been on the news many times and usually the patient has to rent a hotel room and commit suicide there to avoid their family all the legal trouble they could face, like suspicion of helping them carry out their suicide, etc...)
at my country, the whole assisted dying thing is a huge shitshow because you have months and months of procedures and evaluations, you have to schedule a ¬´killing session¬ª with your doctor weeks in advance and he can refuse at the last minute with no reason
I don't see the need for fully educated doctors with 8+ years of training to just inject you with something that hopefully ends your suffering
Looks cool and sounds way cooler than just "taking a really fast train"
Also, people really like techwank
Yeah the problem has been solved before but the not-invented-here syndrome is a thing
this is the now public domain winnie
> This only applies to the original works, and not to the subsequent adaptations and merchandise, which allows for Disney's incarnation of Winnie the Pooh to still be held under trademark by Disney.
not only is it cute but it's also a soviet cartoon, that makes it an order of magnitude better than the mainline Winnie the Pooh
the same way latin branched into a hundred dialects, they will be reabsorbed into a few remaining ones
romance languages have a ton of spin offs that do not really add something new or unique to the table
this is to be expected
but some of them can essentially die by being relegated to official bureaucracy/newspaper, while the vast majority of the population just uses another language
yeah, the chances of some language disappearing are virtually none
I'm not talking about rare Hindi/Sanskrit dialects not officially recognized in India, etc., I'm talking world languages
what languages do you think are gonna disappear in the next 50y ?
this
in some cases lockdowns favoured clandestine gatherings in ppl homes, much more insecure and difficult to control than any pub you can imagine
with some safety measures followed by everyone, lockdowns could've been avoided perfectly
there's no easy way out of this, just waiting until the virus mutates into some common cold, after serious lockdowns ppl have learnt nothing and still refuse to let go of unhealthy habits like coughing on their hands, not washing hands, etc.
*libre* as in GNU/Linux or GNU plus Linux

: (
they're genetically programmed to be subservient
well, look at the dog eugenics
That sounds a lot like narcissistic parenting
It's just when they do it pathologically when it's a bad thing
I think parents wanting to control you to some extent is just parents being parents. They also rebelled at some point against their parents.
totally agree
I don't think selecting your child's genes is the same as planning out their lives. When they select genes they don't want you to attend med school, they just want for you to have higher chances of being healthy, like discarding specific genes that are critical to malignancy
but they have some risk associated with it
really ?
I don't see any debate there
also, if your parents CAN‚Äîi.e. have the capacity‚Äîto carefully select your genetic strains, then the outcome is already a selection
1. choose some or all genes
2. choose not to select any genes and randomize (aka just have sex)
wonder where they all went
they dissapeared like ~4 years ago
no
does that forum still exist ?
I mean it would be a miracle if that doesn't happen
"civil war discord" meets all requirements necessary for cringe
https://xkcd.com/936
he also has some Q&A regarding the information entropy of a completely random passphrase vs the usual number/letter/symbol password approach
staple horse whatever
yeah I would make it mandatory to read that xkcd vignette
I don't want to log in to my mail @ just to log in to some web service
having yubikey, 2FAuth, etc... having one time passwd delivered by email seems like a hassle
passwordless auth is just auth with your pass being managed by third parties
at least in most of western europe
but in reality they're legally liable, too
most of the time they offer to repair those faulty devices "out of good luck", since a firmware update screwed them
hidden or latent faults in some types of products can in fact extend the guarantee period, some goods like cars, fridges, phones, etc., can have that
what is an AMAB ?
they can't refuel effectively
I'd expect russia to rely on these cryptos to circumvent a possible swift ban
unlike russia, ukraine is not going to be barred from swift, they can transfer money easily from/to SEPA countries

you guys think this is legit ?
but destroying that aircraft is evil for the sake of it
neutral evil? sure he's KGB alright
yeah but Putin didn't strike me as a chaotic evil kinda guy
I mean who could destroy the only one centipede plane
it might be disinfo
how can I short this ?
I like to think that they had it all sorted out since before finishing their movies
Unlike more modern examples like Elliott
I remember reading that they didn't like media attention and after those movies there's almost nothing about their transition, they kept it to themselves
You find off-putting that they weren't transitioned during the original trilogy ?
the west disregards that lit?
how's that ?
Since day one of this mess, there's gotta be a lot of people waiting for the ruble to hit rock bottom and then get rich
