an NSFW fan content channel would be useful
i’m actually not done
it's called Strider form because of the way he moves while on water
Faiz Strider Form

it allows for easy operation and better mobility on in and under water along with granting additional movement and attack options both on land and in water it comes with three new weapons and four pieces of additional armor that attach to the arms (mostly wrist forearm and hand) and legs (lower legs and feet) it also adds additional internal piece to the helmet allows for a supply of oxygen along with an additional vision mode for underwater navigation and searching for things is included most of which is programmed into a new mission memory but some of it is physical equipment that can either be manifested on-site or carried as nothing more than a pair of elbow high metallic gloves and knee high metallic boots the weapons are disguised as a wrist mounted scale/level combo that actually fires special two mode bolas an oddly shaped wrist mounted electronic ruler which acts as a combination harpoon grappling hook and a leg mounted heavily modified version of the Faiz sounder which is disguised as small pair of those portable expandable speakers that you can plug into your phone it acts as a thruster (or a pair if split in two) for water propulsion and allows for an extremely deadly spinning Rider Kick
ok so this is going to be a long post
are you interested in knowing what it is
so <@384495616065273856> did i ever mention that i created a new form for Kamen Rider Faiz
I remember all those jokes￼
<a:DESSSSSSS:642227618472656906>
oh yes it’s very fun when you’re swarmed by bots￼
I’m actually a moderator for one of them
semi-anonymous￼
in a kamen rider group
Kik
I actually don’t know who made this￼
not mine but i figured <@384495616065273856> would enjoy this
technically Agito would also work i mean he did kill the equivalent of || God ||
alternatively throw Build in for a huge curveball of screw religion science is the answer
he works for an organization that is part of a religious sect
IXA
this form was originally designed to bridge the power gap between Accel and Blaster along with dealing with the fact that there’s a lot of water battles in the crossover this will show up in
the speed at which it moves to run across water is comparable to that of the Wolf Spider or any Dolomedes type Spider https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolomedes
i’m posting it here because someone else made it
not mine

i've got a ton of fate themed bait memes
for me it's not really that old considering i was basically around during the birth of internet memes
i was born in 94 mate
for those not aware there's no such thing as enough DAKKA
so i saw the archived channel <#581494826793566236> and was extremely disappointed that someone said there was enough swords at one point because i thought everyone knew this rule
Tsukasa is amazing
<:Based:654292395604574265>
Yusuke fuckmothering Godai
the original
not the Kuuga from Decade
also Kuuga is fucking amazing
as for Decade that's a show you watch for Decade the character
oh man i love Faiz and Build
ok what else
oh you poor bastard
oh
please tell me you didn't watch Zi-O or Ghost
ok good glad you got that reference
> Stag Beetle, Caucasus and Rhinoceros Beetle
<@!457268466429329429>  all i heard was things related to Kamen Rider Kabuto
that feature alone is worth the price
i own 3 for XB1 and i'm seriously considering re-purchasing it for switch
and man is it a fucking pain
the other versions of 3 don't have this
also if you can get the version of 3 for the switch since it's got style switching on the fly like how 4 and 5 do
as for the others make you choice
take my advice do that one and 3 on easy
just be careful some of the older ones didn't age well especially the final boss of the first
ah here's the last meme i was looking for
can't really zoom in that much on the first version on my phone
so you lost my attention at prepare your anus but you got it back with the Kamen Riders
<@!263534352422404096> i was talking about the meme not the bot
oh also these i call the first one Cosmic Carol the second is obvious and i can't find the third
seriously it works so well
this however is one of my favorite sympho-memes

also Kamen Rider memes
maybe deviantart
i forget where i got all these actually


i do it's on my phone
that OOO and Carol picture is just a mood of pure destruction

in other news over the last 48 hours a bunch of shit has gone down my mother was in direct contact with someone who is Covid positive I have gotten no sleep making me wonder if I’m about to get very sick and of course the election has me on edge considering i’m directly effected by this because i’m in one of the groups trumps been targeting
<@!186660127825330177> you say that but the same is true for Obama￼‘s second term

i was in a kik group for || anime feet || and some sick bastard joined and started posting || Child Porn || ￼i want to claw my eyes out and just forget everything i saw before i hit report and block i’m currently on the phone reporting it to the FBI
i feel fucking sick
what i’m saying is there’s a limit
yeah but you can only do so much with them
true but if anyone would have that much taxable income it’d be Bezos
after that the IRS could nail you with tax evasion

so thoughts on The Misfit of Demon King Academy
<:jaygun:757355347491946527>
good luck with that
<:smugsaka:628613233577689109>
there isn’t actually anything their discord is just adding on for some reason￼
some weird glitch
this is the type of world building you get if you read the manga meanwhile the anime is just off crying in the corner￼
One example of this was when he had the first version of the familiar that Saito is I can’t be bothered to look up the names right now commit genocide on the elves she was completely conscious when she was doing it she saw everything she did but she had no control over her own body ￼
these effects did luckily lessen with time￼
The worst thing he did has to do with the four sets of familiar runes that appear on the familiars of void mages￼ originally those runes basically caused the equivalent of a sort of subconscious forced mind control￼
and surprise surprise it’s not even the worst thing he did￼
people tend to not like you after you do shit like that
it was the genocide
literally the only good thing about elves is that generally they tend to keep to themselves because they don’t like humans￼ after what a certain original void mage ￼did
I don’t even have an accurate comparison for the vast difference so think of it like the difference between the explosive force ￼one of those party poppers ￼and the strongest bomb ever created￼
with any other magic it’s the same as the system every other mage uses so they can counter it but not with elves￼￼
The reason they’re such a threat is because they use a completely different type of magic￼
A typical recommendation given to anyone even the strongest of mages when facing down an elf is to run and pray
this is a pretty big fucking deal￼
she’s the only one to have ever beaten an elf in single combat￼ until the event of one of the seasons of FoZ
and of course it would work well for Louise’s mother because she is regarded as one of the most powerful mages in the world of FoZ￼
this particular style involved keeping control of one’s emotions￼￼
here’s a hint her mother tried it a teaching style that worked very well for her but didn’t exactly work well for anyone else￼
I mean in the manga Louise actually has character and we learn why she’s the way she is
so it essentially fell to the people who were making the last season to create an ending what they did was fine but I can’t help it feel like the original creator would’ve done it better￼￼
The manga is leagues better than the anime unfortunately it never officially finished because the creator died before he could finish it
So this kind of thing is completely in character for that guy
in case anyone hasn’t picked up on this by now Brimir was a huge fucking jerk￼ who forced one of his familiars to commit genocide on her own species￼
so || Saito is now a living battery for Louise’s void magic and it draws from his life force that’s the fourth familiar so if she casts too much with him around and she does certain things afterwards it’ll kill him and no one tells anyone about this until season 4 ||￼
you never saw what it cost did you
oh
not as big as the one blurb at the beginning of Haruhi Suzumiya but pretty fucking big￼￼
and here’s the thing as the season goes on it gets heavier into political intrigue and drama along with everything else so there are some pretty big info dumps sometimes￼
I did I watched the first season dubbed JC staff in their infinite fucking wisdom decided hey you know the other three seasons fuck that lets not dub them￼
Who here has ever watched the familiar of zero
i’ve had a grudge against JC staff for a long time
considering what JC staff did to season two this is a fact
Oh my God I remember that
I don’t know maybe angsty bitch boys are popular
i’m not sure what I would say my favorite scene is but throwing a castle was up there just for how everyone else reacted￼
I know I expected the same thing and then we got this instead it was ridiculously good it was one of those cases of this has no right to be as good as it is things￼
I know right
oh boy
wait wasn’t that the one with the inter-species romance
G Gundam is my favorite
that still counts technically
aren’t most web novels treated like drafts
they will especially do this with stuff that is already finished where they could have given a proper ending or they’ll leave bait for a season two that will never come￼
I realize that anime is used more as a promotional vehicle for manga and LN’s right now but Kadokawa is guilty of doing it too much for example they take something that has more than enough material for two seasons and just make one because fuck you￼
God I have a serious gripe with them￼
since it’s a show done by Kadokawa
probably through book walker
are you saying you can’t or you won’t
just imagine the voice is Aoi Yuki￼
well you know what they say about that show
you managed to convince me
so i’ve done something <@!384495616065273856>
I honestly would believe he did￼
from what I’ve heard he actually did￼
not so much that as it is a || sort of dream or separate world ||￼
again Shinzo Abe asked for this so what the hell did you expect￼
The one that’s a Tanuki yes
and Gridman well it’s trick to explain without spoiling plot stuff
BNA is either lesbian or Bi
ok so KLK and LWA are lesbian as fuck
I mean it certainly was hateful enough towards people at that weren’t straight at least in the subtext
you know i think the japanese government might have actually had a hand in that too￼
I mean look at it and then look at the other shows they made it is very different ￼
I ask this because I know that the anime and the manga leave out important story bits￼
but more importantly I just watched episode 10 of spider isekai and i have a question || is there some sort of time dilation thing going on between the labyrinth and what’s outside because that’s the only exclamation I can think of for some of the shit that’s going on ||￼￼
honestly my only gripe was || Hanzo copping out ||
i enjoyed it
ah that also explains || the teacher saying she’s dead ||
he was literally given medication’s and transfusions || so he could continue providing for Sunako but he still turned￼ ||
look at || Seshin ||
depending on who you’re thinking of because they were multiple people that were like this they may have either turned later or died later￼
The official media isn’t exactly clear on whether it was Sunako or Takumi who told them this but given the nature of the two characters i’m betting it was￼￼ the latter
they were basically told that changing victims wasn’t a thing they could do and that the people would die anyway but if you took from them three times there was a chance they could rise￼￼
oh I know what you mean
it was because it was basically a kind random chance￼ some people would rise some people wouldn’t however it is slightly implied but never stated that you are more likely to rise if A you are being completely of your own free well || like Seshin || or B you have some form of regret or unfinished business
True the kids didn’t although it is implied that some of them might have actually lived￼ there were some changes between the novels the manga and the anime￼
yes
I will stand by this next statement till the day I die most of the villagers deserved what was coming￼￼ just look at how they treated Megumi || when she was human || the only times they actually gave a fuck about her were ￼|| when she went missing and when she died || and don’t get me started on fucking Natsuno￼
i remember showing a friend Shiki and when we got to || the slaughter || his response was “suddenly i understand why you hate humanity”
it’s a glitch that only happens when posting with mobile
well if you know what was changed you would know that the Monger and novels and honor slightly and I mean very slightly better note || instead of somewhat implying it they outright show that Seshin and Sunako survived ||￼
like those last couple of episodes are just a perfect example of the reason why I don’t have faith in humanity anymore because people would do this in real life except they would do it for things that were nowhere near as important just look at McCarthyism I mean it wasn’t || Genocide || but it was pretty much as close to murder as you could get if you got blackballed during that era your life was effectively over￼￼
Yes fuck the doctor but fuck || the old man || even more
yes the one that is basically just about how terrible people are￼
so who here has seen Shiki
my writing is kind of bad and I’m currently focused on writing something else￼￼ Symphogear related
then again I’m the guy that watches really niche stuff￼
I have discovered exceptions to this rule somehow￼
I mean I have no problem with that kind of ship but people please variety is the spice of life￼ and can we for once give || Megumi || a happy ending there are so many fix that start about that and just never end and almost all of them are terrible￼
and don’t even get me started on the doujins￼
because for some reason everyone seems to think Natsuno and his friend are gay for each other￼￼
yes and almost all of them are bad and/or extremely gay￼
and then there’s that one thing the old man says to her || about the possibility of being accepted had she not broken the villages rules ￼|| I was like bull fucking shit at that point || you were just murdering people because you didn’t like them when they were still alive there is no way you would’ve excepted such a person so don’t lie through your goddamn teeth and act self-righteous￼ when you turned the rest of the villagers into nothing short of genocidal monsters ||￼ the doctor was one thing but even he seemed to know when things were getting out of hand you could tell from things like the look on his face￼ the old man on the other hand || he couldn’t give a flying fuck￼ ||
we’re talking about the little girl just wanted a place to be accepted who literally asks the question || do you think if when they try to stake  me it will go through my chest in one hit because she’s so horrified at what’s happening ||
like the first thought that goes through my head is were we watching the same show￼
one thing I don’t care for is when people write fanfiction and characterize Sunako as nothing but a monster ￼
because he had that fucking coming since the moment he showed up on screen￼
I fucking cheered￼
One of my favorite scenes was when Megumi outright demolishes him verbally and physically after she’s just had it with his shit || both in life and beyond that ||￼
agreed fuck him he can go to hell || he deserves to die￼ ||
they laughed at her made fun of her and generally mocked her behind her back and even pretty much to her face like they would speak just slightly under their breath while she was in earshot ￼everything from how she dressed to how she acted or things that they would gossip about and mock and depending on which source of media your drawing from there may have been comments about her possibly being “loose”￼￼
especially || how she died ||
whenever I look at her I see a character that deserved much better than what she got￼
although if I could change that one person ended up it would be || Megumi￼ || for several reasons one once you’ve turned into a shiki certain things happen in the brain that cause and then increase psychotic tendencies￼ so you could make a fair argument that ||￼ she wouldn’t have gone as far as she did if that wasn’t in play ||￼￼ two the entire village save for a couple of people treated her like shit and one of the people that didn’t || just refused to take the obvious hints that she did not want to be friends with them￼ || I mean look at the reason she fell in love with Natsuno it was literally because he doesn’t treat me like total shit the way the rest of the village does instead he treats me one tier above that it’s pretty much the equivalent of well every guy around me beats me but this one guy only insults me verbally so I think I’ll fall in love with him￼ and three yes after she || turned into a Shiki she did some really bad shit arguably she was evil arguably she did terrible things || but it’s very much a case of treat a person like a monster and you’ll make a monster ￼
nobody in that show save for a couple of people got “happy” endings￼
because part of what they don’t tell you at least directly in the anime from what I remember￼ is that || the entire fucking village burned to the ground there was nothing but ash left￼ || and really that just goes to show that you reap what you sow￼
honestly I think the issue most people had with it boils down to the whole || pretty much everyone you got to know dies || thing￼￼ but that’s because people have forgotten that a good ending doesn’t necessarily mean a happy one
I watched this show really recently￼ and I own the Blu-ray DVD combo pack￼
The outright tell the person who drinks it that it’s just enough to tide them over until their first kill￼
Now I know what you’re thinking what about that scene with || the wine glass of blood ||￼
there’s an answer for that too the new vampires were also told that part of what they required was the kill itself￼
same as || Takumi and Natsuno ||
yup into a || Jinrou ||
too late I already saw it
well he did have assistants trained in case this happened
_has begun mourning through song _
i did a thing
apparently her voice is like nails on a chalkboard to him so whenever she does that he wants to kill her￼
you know how she’s always shouting Hibiki￼
and there was other things
yeah he absolutely despises Miku granted I don’t like her but I don’t hate her like he does￼
so I was not very tolerant of that
two seasons mind you during one of the most depressing times in my life ￼
so if you think my comparison was bad imagine sitting through two seasons of that trying to hold yourself back￼
i’m pretty sure my friend is rubbing off on me negatively this is exactly what he did with Symphogear until season 3 came around
I found that amusing yet weird￼
you all have permission to kill me now￼
because I just fucking realized this is exactly what he would say￼
I have to stop hanging around my friend from Canada￼
I think my other issue is the method she joined like literally taking a goddamn stage dive from a drop that would definitely kill her￼
and I will not hesitate to criticize Shirou￼
to be fair I got into Fate with unlimited blade works￼
yes yes I know￼
maybe I’ll be impressed when shit actually goes down￼
as i understand it yes
maybe I’m being a bit harsher on this because I knew there were jokes that just wouldn’t translate so I took the time to watch the sub￼
that’s the joke￼
I was considering it honestly you can pick almost any of Urobuchi’s works￼
and that’s the part I’m talking about specifically
The difference there is she didn’t have much of a choice￼
i’m sorry the moment an actual deadly weapon passed your fucking head you should’ve thought twice￼
look I have an issue with that particular trope I hate people who rush in knowing absolutely fuck all about what they’re getting into￼
a main character who jumps in knowing absolutely fucking nothing about what she’s getting into￼
people fighting it out for some prize that everyone wants
i’m going to keep going because it will probably get better but right now that’s the impression it gives me￼
and so far I have been disappointed￼
again I apologize for the statement but when people hype me up by saying something along the lines of this is Symphogear except instead of band geeks it’s theater ￼￼geeks you set a level of expectation￼
and so far the impression i’m getting is yeah this is really gay and that’s adorable but the plot screams || discount Kamen Rider Gaim not Kamen Rider Ryuki Kamen Rider Gaim ||
i’m watching Revue Starlight
especially to you <@!384495616065273856>
i apologize for what i’m about to say
so I’m about to commit heresy￼
oh that explains it then
OK I have to ask are there any jokes or things that just didn’t translate right because as much as I appreciate some thing subtitled as much as I appreciate everything I don’t know why but this particular show is fucking killing me I don’t hate it it’s just kind of dragging I guess and I’m on episode three I don’t know maybe it’s because I can think of a bunch of other things I could do right now or maybe I just need to take a break and come back to it later￼
why the fuck are they using deadly weapons where they could accidentally kill each other when the goal is just to knock the coat off￼
ok so i’m still wondering something
well back to watching the show and hoping it gets better￼
and over half of them are still untranslated￼
and for those of you that don’t consider in a poor version of lore management especially when it’s only in one language on a site most people won’t know exist￼￼s
I’d talk about how I absolutely hate the keywords but you all know how I feel￼
that said once we discovered the keywords￼ and OVA’s he started to enjoy it more because things started to make more sense
clumsy and absolutely dangerously overworked but adorable
she’s adorable ￼
I straight up told him that she was the last person I expected him to like
oh yeah I thought it was fucking weird too￼
then you know exactly what I’m talking about
well before you guys judge him I should mention that like me he is on the autism spectrum and if you know anything about the autism spectrum you know that for us we have certain things that we have issues with some people its texture some people it’s volume some people it’s pitch it can be any number of things and I think for him it’s the pitch and tone of a voice￼
but he found it fucking adorable￼
yeah I figured he would absolutely hate all of her verbal tics and everything￼
hilariously his favorite gear is Kirika the person I thought he would hate the most￼
yeah that’s the reason Symphogear is so near and dear to my heart it pulled me out of that depression
considering he was doing it for me when I was very depressed because it was the first anniversary of my father‘s passing you really shouldn’t be saying that
I explained that 50 fucking times over I explained that she needed something to keep her grounded and he just kept saying that that was fucking stupid that she should just fully embrace everything else￼
it’s this tonal thing
but he has this issue with Japanese voices
yes
I have so many questions and there are so many issues￼
has anyone here ever seen Planzet because I just finished watching it and I’m still trying to make sense of what I watched￼
depends on if it’s Macross or not
and that’s it
so far i’m looking at our teachers are dating
so i need manga recommendations specifically yuri manga like  Superwomen in Love Honey Trap & Rapid Rabbit
that is all
Gundam 00 is based
why is it the worst well it’s simple really piloting one is literally a death sentence in the words of a popular Gundam YouTuber there are better ways to kill yourself
the Genoace
oh fuck no not this shit again
it’s like leaving half the show untranslated
because no one is going to put up with subtitles of that quality
I figured there had to be
_refuses to support half assed subtitling _
i guess wait for the BD’s or find a fan sub group is my answer for this one
oh so it’s unwatchable got it
and honestly if that’s how Netflix is going to treat what’s given to them it should be taken away
https://twitter.com/CG_Orange_eng/status/1468238864124895233
oh boy
honestly I think having him pilot a version of the Exia is very good in a symbolic way because that’s how he started except he was on the other end of the conflict
well at that point they just call it the Gram Gundam
OK but what about G Gundam
I love that sound effect
unfortunately
and yes this was an actual take by an actual person
or someone who said unless you’re Japanese you shouldn’t be eating sushi and all cultural food should be kept inside their country of origin
Dumb shit like that
I only use the term SJW for something very specific and it’s generally the type of person who makes issues out of things that are not issues like looking at a dress designed by a Japanese person with obvious Japanese influences and saying that because of these things no one who is anything other than Japanese is allowed to wear this or it’s cultural appropriation meanwhile not only was the stress produced for those other people but the people of the aforementioned culture including the creator say that this “issue” that these people are raising is not only not a problem but is also nonexistent
i missed that
oh someone already posted about it
i actually did some research and apparently the main problem with the CGI was the fact that they were trying to do two different styles at the same time they tried to blend 2-D and 3-D because they couldn’t decide which they wanted to do if they had chosen one and stuck with it we probably would’ve gotten something better
now that is honestly fair
God now I expect whoever that was to pilot one of those gasoline powered mobile suits and destroy a bunch of GN-X units
That checks out yeah
how literally how how the actual fuck
oh my god that man is insane seriously it’s like if he went out there in a fucking ball
because nobody told him it wasn’t
also let it be known that when he piloted that flag he operated it under the impression that it was a GN powered suit
Man those poor GN-X III’s they did not know what they were getting into
kind of like how Setsuna pilots a Flag at one point
stupid bloody overhyped things
God Diggity Damnit
same
yeah I liked that fight too
That makes sense otherwise he would be pretty fucked up because we’ve seen in the past what being an actual cyber new type does to people
One second I know someone who would be able to answer this question better than I I’m going to go ask them
from the first time he got in the unicorn he was able to activate NTD mode and it’s long been established the drawbacks of becoming a cyber new type
no he’s a true new type from what I remember
Yeah but don’t those kind of fuck with new type shit
yeah I only know this because of a YouTube video that was ranking some of the most powerful weapons in Gundam
no no that would still be a step down in firepower remember the beam magnum can punch right through a mobile armor and a simple grazing shot is enough to shred an MS
I honestly find it kind of funny how Banagher just refused to relinquish that goddamn beam magnum to the point where he said you know what I am gonna pilot an MS with a bunch of arms attached to the back because there’s no way I’m giving up this gun
what you need to know is that the beam magnum was designed expressly for use with the unicorn gundams any MS that tries to use it without being designed for it will basically destroy the arm upon firing it
don’t watch narrative from what I have heard it basically ruins the entirety of the message of Unicorn
remember how it just had a bunch of fucking arms on the back because every time he fired the damn beam Magnum the arm just broken
remember the silver bullet suppressor
or limited arms
God I love the beam Magnum
oh God I remember SD Gundam Force I also remember hating it no to be fair my only exposure to Gundam at that point other than that was G Gundam so that was my standard I somehow managed to dodge SEED which in retrospect i’m thankful for it wasn’t until Gundam Unicorn aired on Toonami that I actually properly got back into Gundam
