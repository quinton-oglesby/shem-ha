I feel like this would be fun




Eh, I can see why. I think everyone shits on it way too much. I personally liked it, solid B-tier.
I'm curious now, why?
I simply prefer Trigger via bias
Don't get me wrong, Bikki vs Yuna is very cool
In a hypothetical fight between the two



That would be cool
hm...that gives me an idea
Also ty
While this isn't my preferred opponent for Bikki to face this is cool

You think so?
