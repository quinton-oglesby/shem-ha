thanks good sir
<@!123147794658754560> did you draw this or was it found somewhere online?
this makes such a great art for trading card sleeves
Maybe not killing her off but I feel like the climax of the season might be a bigger conflict between Miku and Hibiki.
I just remembered the last scene of AXZ and the ferry wheel from the new season, it feels kinda they want to hint something with this.
I am the only one that thinks they might kill off Miku for good at the end of the season? ðŸ‘€
I am curios about why he has a chance apparently
He does not seem like that type of character that would go blindly in without a chance tho...
I feel kinda retarded but what is going on with Gen that he event wanted to slap that enemy in the first EP of the new season?
And I think it would not be that unlikely to kill a Char from the main cast off at the end of the final season. Since the show more or less started with the death of one person more or less.
its just like 40 sec
I bet they did cut something from Chris transformation as they did with Kirika

like she is thirsty for dicks
I like the V sign that the batgirl makes all the time
it feels like he purposly set up the attack on the concert just to yell at her
so many deathflags in one EP
but wow, what is up with the grandfather?

more like for the nation japan
I doubt he wants the power for himself
for some random reason
its already clear that miku will be used to wear the relict from the god
Thanks tho
Oh snap
For me it looks like she is wearing the coffin thingy
Did someone already mention this
