Hi

Yee
So not XX/XY is an exception?
So biology basically needs to be rewritten as a subject
Well fuck what I learnt in school?
Simple
<@285555416056856576> gender identity. I'm saying your sex is either XX or XY and your gender is defined by yourself
Both are important
AND your own sexual identity
There's XX and XY
My two cents about ^^^
She just straight left
School said it was "due to illness"
My biology teacher straight ditched us middle of GCSE year
I'm kinda surprised I didn't fail biology
We acknowledge these exceptions
Simple
Boom
As there always has been
There are exceptions in nature
F
RIP Wiggo
Sort of like how we've gone deeper into stuff and we know more compared to back then
We did half cover that
So from what I'm getting:
Newton was wrong in a small amount of places? But the fuck ups are large?
First lie I found out was that there are more than 3 states of matter
I learnt about Einstein being wrong but not Newton
Well fuck my A-level physics then?
TIL
Newton was wrong in places?
1+1=2
Too small = most likely bias
Too big = company
Exactly
Or am I going to have to stick to upday on my phone?
Is there any good news source that isn't a business?
It's why I get a screenshot so no one visits daily cancer
That's the worst feeling in the world
Where's real news
Why do we accept this
My issue is with this stuff standing out there
Cancer I know
There
I hate vali
Fucking vali
BBC had an article a few days ago
"How to build a real time machine"
On a serious note, fuck most news "articles"
So should I have a wide face or nah
I am lost

I also got an MP5 (With invincibility ability)
*smug 7 days of playing*

Want to add each other?
Nice
Oh shit wrong server
In the 7 days I've been playing I've got 4 416s and 2 WA2000
I'm cursed
I have an issue with Girls' Frontline
Okay
Should I dump images of new skins here?
Blame AUS for censorship in the game
Also
Five-SeveN gets a new skin but it's defo gonna be censored in EN
Mixed the non damaged and damaged
Oof

~~Kirika~~ NTW got a new skin
I have all images of the upcoming skins ~~stolen from a friend~~


```Dear Commanders,
We are now showing you Springfield’s “Stirring Mermaid” and WA2000’s “Op. Manta Ray”! WA2000’s swimsuit package will be available for purchase in the Shop while Springfield’s costume will show up in the Re-supply Gacha. The three elements of the beach are parasols, lounge chairs and sunglasses…Sunscreen and pretty girls too!```
Kar98k chibi a cutie
Help

RIP dude
So it's all a waste
416 is inferior to sopmod
56-1 is a shitty 416
Crafts plz
4 416s

You know why?
I don't even use her
5 56-1s
5

One thing that I dislike about Girls Frontline is that I'm a complete luckshitter
^^ muted channels
Only ones I ain't interested in
Where have they gone?
I'm talking bout general swearing and insults in games
That's fine and all
Every game is becoming so sensitive and shit
<@102691114762371072> Dude provided pics

I missed out one successful heist but meh
And that was the worst payday day I had
So it started at 10 AM, going for a classic 30 bag DW Cook off
Crash at 21 bags
OD Hotline Miami 
>full team has combat medic aced
>I kick them because they refuse to change it out because it ruins beserker + DMR (it will make enemies be at 3 health)
>new people join
>down me with Commando
>swears in foreign
OD Heat Street
>ICTV Anarchist 
>Flak Jacket Anarchist
>Armour bag
>Down to Bronco cops
>I make it to the hill
>1 fucking sniper 
>aAAAAAAAAAaAAaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I remember the worst day of payday I once had
He created the auto shottie/lmg downward spiral we are stuck in
It's Jules
Almir ain't in charge of balancing no more
Do you know why payday balance has gone shit?
I miss DMR meta
Pubs are trash
Yeah
After a few months of playing I had a 1GB crashlog
It's deemed normal
Like crashing
It's so shit
Fuck payday man
We all solo'd one down goat sim
Most of them don't play payday no more cos it's gone trash but we were kings of the game
A lot of them play siege
It's about payday
That server isn't even about R6S
I don't even play it

R6S is so stupid right now
I didn't get to expand on the HM2 thing
Less fun
Aww
People suck yada yada either ignore or focus em yada yada chink in the light
Anyway
Shirabe that's twice now
People suck when it comes to games
I agree with ya
I don't get why we are arguing if that's what's happening
Look
It's 10 birthday was last year
2007
If you wanna report people play blackwonder/skial servers
Literally focus them
You can shut a cunt up by killing that bitch a cuppa dozen times
Not in TF2
Or you fuck em over sideways
You either ignore em
And when I do
I don't see a lot
I don't emulate being an asshole
People fucking suck
I'm agreeing with ya here
https://youtu.be/_eiZMWZF8kA
Those payday lines are said by the cloaker
Perfect solution
There
No one but the game should insult the player
Leave the insults to the game
Less fun
Oh
Take a lot at Hotline Miami 2
It's more fun
I'm saying game characters should insult players
Actual voice line
The safeword is police brutality
Or
Payday 2
Now go to the forums and cry like the little bitch you are
Okay then
WILLIAM WALLACE
Yeee
And that makes the game so much better
That's fucking amazing ^
TF2
"You are not a Scotsman you are an Englishman with a dress"
Example
If your looking for SMG/SG go 6464
Heavy production shotgun
Don't claim 800 point till week 3 (tomorrow) so you can grab a fuck ton of points
*DO NOT CLAIM THE 800 POINT REWARD UNTIL WEEK 3 *
You'll complete the "Collect 100" and "Collect 200 Batteries" missions immediately when you turn it in on Week 3
Leaving you with only 100 more to collect for the third tier of the missions
PSA
Oh yeah
Save about 30k rations for week 3
Only do it occasionally
Yeah
But don't go resource dry on her
1k×4 seems to get the most
First best doesn't come to EN servers for 2 years
2nd best AR in game
Try rolling for a G11

The only reason #2 is there is so you can have 6 turns and 5 fights in one round
#2 is a single handgun
#1 is your squad

For GF 5-4 is a great grinding map
Why is a legendary so common
I have 5 416s
Plz
PPS is top top
Holy shit

I haven't rolled a shotgun yet
She thinks evasion is still a good idea
Just remember super shorty is shitty
Nice
Press the eye thing to get the background by itself

^ PKP stuff


Yeah
730/630/130/430 iirc
