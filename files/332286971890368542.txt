Don't worry if you're confused by that sentence, I'm dead-tired
I'm only watching Symphogear because I "Sold" my time and effort into watching a full anime series for a charity auction and the winner chose that I needed to watch Symphogear
Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

But you could also write about how the average citizen of this different world can't even begin to comprehend why Otherworld Visitor X functions or how they operates, presenting a Lovecraftian view on the characters that were already established
Obv. that would be the fate of a few of those dozen
And then once that narrative arc is established, the writer can jump from tons of different perspectives and cover how these dozen people are wrecking shit up
Once those dozen people are trapped, shit goes real bad almost immediately and towns / countries start going to ruin because said people don't follow the rules of whatever world / universe they're trespassing in
My head cannon for a deconstructive isekai is that it's a dozen or so people who actively isekai themselves willingly (as part of slum tourism or whatever) and they end up getting trapped with no way out and no plans to make a living for themselves.
That's not a bad idea.
I've been joking with some IRL friends that I need to write a deconstructive isekai story to kick the genre out of style, and with each passing week the pressure to actually do that is increasing
Maybe I'm too hyped up on coffee, but that would be a truly apocalyptic scenario for me
There's part of me that believes there's a 50/50 chance that isekai shows/manga/light novels won't ever go out of style, partially because I can't see any evolution in the genre or audiences getting tired of it.
That's not to say they're bad, but it's a stagnant genre that isn't evolving.
I'm willing to bet that 99.99% of all isekai is just twists on that basic story premise.
