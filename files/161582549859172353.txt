for those who take pity on me and wish to help in my quest to unlock bikki:
eventually the game will give me giga magic, right <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I'm gonna put up another hard magic in a few minutes. I cannot rest until ignite bikki is fully armed and operational
btw if that follower comment was directed at me, I just made some space

>get another 5 giga miracle drop
y-yay...
I can't find it so it might be dead
lul
grats
yeah ignite bikki and XD jii alone can absolutely trash her
normal Carol isn't too hard if you've got a good P team
I'll ditch my 70s then
that's what "Hunt" is
getting last hit basically just gets you another roll on the loot table
that all right or do you want me to tone down my team?
I might accidently kill normal Carol even on 1 cp >.>
<@!457268466429329429> she's at 65k
<@!457268466429329429> It's open, but one of the adds is still up. Gonna do another go and finish her off real quick
alright, will let you know when it's open
try now
which one?
or if you haven't used your 3 yet I can delet her for you
<@!457268466429329429> you want me to start you a hard miracle carol? i can clear a few spots on my follow list and make a friends only raid
nothing but rainbows <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
you get the hunt as long as it dies on your screen
