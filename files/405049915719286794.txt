hi yes Das modded in the discord partnered Wonder Egg server for somewhere over a year. In regards to anger issues he fortunately never took anything out on any members, including those in trouble. ~~rather it was other mods who kinda had to worry a bit~~
Kasumi's also very good tho
one look at his pfp and he's biased
it's a very fantastic time, strongly recommend, Setsuna's the absolute best
which has Setsuna in it!
Nijigasaki
that's all I can do, shill for Love Live
wonder at what point he'll watch Love Live
that we do
I did just give you all the relevant information to look her up so
~~really just here for emotes tho~~
Setsuna Yuki from Love Live
it's getting late after all
do I follow or do I stand by my original duty of have emotes and never speak
3rd probs
like
nice talking to y'all tho <:SetsuHappy:715459030314647555>
I really am gonna dip actually because uh, yeah
got dragged into <#371105434771390465> kicking and screaming
I'm here for emotes lol
love her
hai
anyway Love Live reviews + why you should watch them:
**School Idol Project** - 10/10, peak fiction, not even kidding, literally just a super upbeat and inspiring anime that's so sincerely optimistic and wants you to enjoy the ride
**Sunshine** - how do I rate this actually when s1 is pretty great but s2 is quite weak, anyway Riko is in Sunshine and she's the best written character in the franchise so
**Nijigasaki** - probably the highest technical quality in the franchise as of yet, best girls on average as well, has Setsuna, good 9/10
**Superstar** - this one isn't out yet but I'm excited as hell anyway
hey if it means my pngs have bigger numbers beside their name I'm all for it
I even blow my wallet on the gacha games
kind of just my favourite thing tbh
Love Live is like
all
