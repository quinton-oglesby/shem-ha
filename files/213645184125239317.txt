when it's just one person it might just be their internet having a fart
the best symphogear memes rely on knowing the show / spoilers, imo, so idk how successful that would be
neither st germain nor cag appear to be based on eye colour and I feel like a bright dark red for prelati would be quite distinct
while this could potentially annoy people who picked the role for the colour - why *is* prelati pink, anyway?
that screenshot has this work but I'm not sure any of chris does
<:hibikiNotLikeFist:724546306709913641>
but we could have the whole SONG support crew
> how about tomosato and fujitaka for bots
<@!213645184125239317>
I just wanted to suggest a face
how about tomosato and fujitaka for bots
<a:KirikaHyperFish:726644338309726218>
I'm sure there will be another group rewatch at some point
it's EXCITE
I don't want <:MikuHype:688429715676987428> gone it's good and different energy to the others
the other two are maybe duplicates
<:MikuHype:688429715676987428> has different energy to the other two
why is miku's the only one without a gear headdress
or chris
that's not a lot of emotes compared to kiri or hibiki
every single one is an action or mood or such
I mean, we don't have a *hibiki* emote that *isn't* expressive
both great
<:TomosatoSalute:688199574749446203> <:TomosatoStare:688429724233629772>
the others those characters have are much more expressive still
I didn't even realise those were there. They're nice art but they're not ... expressive, for emotes
yeah, you don't <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
https://youtu.be/uIauXFVABIQ
I feel like I've seen that a fair bit
given people who picked the roles for the colour
but it would be some amount of chaos to revise them
some of the current ones (particularly BI) don't make that much sense to me
even gen only has 2 emotes
I don't want to XV just makes the problem worse and it's bad enough when it's 25 for a nice division
it's just too big of a cast for discord to handle
and so many of them are so good
and look how many the wielders have each
I mean if you assume we have 25 characters we want to represent (9 geahs, 3 permanent bridge crew, 1 S1 villain, 2 G villains, 5 GX villains plus elfnein, 4 AXZ villains, and we'll just ignore XV because 25 is a nice number to work with) that's an average of 10 slots each
unfortunately with so many internet features now you have to ask "how are the alt right gonna abuse this" <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
yeah
if we could boost servers to the point of letting all members use its emotes then we could probably boost the emote server and use that as second source, but that would probably come with the alt right boosting a bunch of racist servers and getting them spammed everywhere
whole point of boosting this server is so everyone can use it
using backup servers only works for people with nitro
but they only need enough emotes for one person we're trying to emote for a main cast of over a dozen and plenty of sides <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
I guess they're trying to make people boost more different servers so it doesn't end up ex. all on one big youtuber's server
there, now it'll be 30 next month
we've had more in the past but there's no benefit for longer
because that's the limit
<:KannaMoney:661293268612546560>
discord let us throw money for more
it's not overlapping that can be edited out
there are creditless OPs on BD2
although I'm not 100% on what these would express
never assume that something's a placeholder, if it's workable the product will ship with it. If it's not meant to be permanent make it as bad as possible while still working <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
> Give bot ability to at least tell you how many images are there in an album <:ElsaSick:689395768754569359>
that would be good some of them are huge collections
is the point
so then what does it do if you provide both because you're highlighting a particular image?
if you're linking from the middle of a source you'll provide both
will the bot auto-skip if source (or at least something looking like it) is provided then?
A lot better but might still be too unclear
which is why the shinais are good, but a lot of those are single-frame rather than a repeatable animation. Chris does seem to just have more of those
miku might have good options but the others don't really have the kind of tight framing you need for emotes
the automagic toaster!
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
#teamtoaster
rainbow roles would be fun but probably get too many complaints of being annoying if discord implemented
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
instead of heads and tails, bikki and beans
<:ChrisUpset:231430246983794688>
(not that I want them gone to be clear I like how it looks, just talking about why my immediate assumption was the other way)
and the aufwachens make dmjii look like the detailed side here
it very occasionally deviates, at least sometimes to different designs of her, but the consistent thing it is being very basic and clear compared to tails where they like to get detailed
idk if us coins are typically different but based on uk coinage it kinda feels the other way - heads is normally one large, clean design while tails is usually more intricate and doesn't stand out so much. But I do also see how you've literally put heads on that side
> \*Puts :TsubasaDere: on emote hit list\*
yet you say this indicating you're fine with the change, and you're one person, who is capable of setting it up elsewhere
I don't think people were, though? I just generally didn't use it because it just looked strange when you can't see *any* detail

Hibicky
emotes people like but aren't universally popular are already restricted like that, is something to consider
(or if you want to address confused questions set like a 6 hour slowmode so people can ask what the server's about and get responses with minimal moderation)
don't create any channels with talking enabled so no moderation is required
and there's something ... off about the staring straight at the camera
older one is much harder to read in normal emote size
well over 300 (including the gifs)
it's 9 wide and I see 37 lines
(side characters being majorly underestimated but they also have less each so it should roughly even out)
7 main characters and at least 3-4 major side characters, 25 emotes per character before you start adding stuff like <:SongStone:688213224012644370>
we have an *abundance* of gif slots
no, we have 250 static and 250 gif
gif emotes don't count towards the limit anyway
suggest setting the default notification setting on the emote server to nothing so people don't have to manually do that?
not saying to lower the current rate. Just have it lower than shitposting. We can take a lot of nonsense there that general would be interrupted by
other thought to add: possibly lower rate in general than shitposting, since there's a lot more general chat going on
only halfway then
is a token a character or a word from the net? 'cause the latter I'm pretty sure is long enough to break discord's character limit
maybe grabbing a couple lines and making them sentences?
I'm not sure if you could manipulate GPT-2 to bypass that
she's learning from the community and most messages are short
jinx
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I've been thinking it might be interesting to have a more complex rate, though it'd be harder to do - have her less likely at busy times, but more when it's quiet, and maybe let her have a very high chance shortly after she first says something, so she can have conversations
was gonna say that <:BasaDelicious:699000434786041946> exists but apparently I "borrowed" it from someone, idk who
rankine is a crime against science
wondered if maybe it might recognise it anyway but yeah
9_convert foot metre 3
oh, is it gonna be coming soon? Fair enough then
liiiink? I had a cursory look before but couldn't see a pack
unless you want to animate the ahoge
at least for private use. if it were on here it can't justify two slots
thaaaat could work <:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
but that's just because chris is a mess
ex. chris
though while it means idiot hair it's popular enough that even a lot of smart characters have it now
https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHair
I'm torn
the ahoge is very chris but it's also nice having the extra resolution ...
my first thought is it doesn't look like yoshii dan's style
smugchris emote?
that's presumably a server with a lot less anime discussion relatively
yeah it was just voluntary. Did get unnecessary in the end with how long it kept going, but what's done is done, nbd <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
this has come up before and there's not really a good solution that improves on "be polite in <#336310266654490624> "
or when someone finishes it so now there's late XV spoilers in the chat waiting for the next new viewer
the problem with that is how do you deal with multiple new watchers
(and chris' is just phonetic)
119 in that one is saying tanoshii desu / "such fun!" or similar
I did say I could look at it before but kinda forgot <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222> feel free to poke if you want extra input
some translations will be difficult since they're the very vague words you get in japanese that can be used in a lot of contexts

technically it's a different sprite but yes
or app might need reloading if they only got added recently

I didn't have that button til I refreshed
ah and i see there's only 60 slots (while line already has 96 between all the packs)
i apparently missed thisd
also since when did discord get stickers
however if I can read them there's probably several others who can too
quickly reviewing them I can read basically all of them but i am currently busy to get them listed out and translated (work time)
it's remarkable what you get in a search for "スン onomatopoeia"
http://thejadednetwork.com/sfx/browse/sun/
<:catbrain:847879295996919888>
it'd be better if it were done a bit more like how teams does them so they all exist in the channel and you can overlook all of them
their use is fairly limited - I could imagine some ways, say if <#371105434771390465> or <#803824240494903338> were to get threads for current series and then people could find the thread they want to reply to, but them being completely separate does seem like a real pain
yeah properly chosen roles
you can drop in on text channels often with no issue
it's much easier for mods to monitor text, tbf. And they have to specifically turn up in VC

Is there a limit to # of roles?
I thought the point of that was so you can have multiple characters but choose which you prioritise
pixiv isn't like twitter where they actively try hide URLs they're both predictable and readily exposed
https://github.com/azuline/pixiv-api fetch_illustration(id).image_urls
though it's possible this pattern may break for things like animations? <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
you can convert the page to the art and vice versa with a text replacement
pixiv images always have the same base URL and suffixes after the ID
might be a lot of commitment for a lot of people, though if people are nominally *re*watching that might not be too much of an issue
idk if it hides it from you on the webpage
at least, you don't if you just edit the link to be the full one
No?
and twitter doesn't have even an attempt at rating to let people decide for themselves
it's literally a meme that twitter cropping will make an image look innocent while cutting something that makes it very nsfw
and we have that
that same logic applies to twitter
pixiv does have ratings which should be available via the API or page scraping
which would also cover if someone still wants a gendered pronoun because that's consistent, but is still plural
if you want it consistent instead of individual they/them roles there could just be a Plural role
<a:PadoruRainbow:692482944765526016>
<:MichaLaugh:816901827349184513>
it's the same scam as was being talked about before
perhaps but it's not enough to be dead giveaway, and particularly ESL speakers could struggle to identify from that
Huh, I thought this one had seemed sus so I ignored it. Guess the one legit link with a sus one is to look more believable
and occasionally shemmy dunking on people's tastes
did someone say shipping mods?
as well as serious if it's stuff like crypto being terrible
at the moment it can go there if it's gaming-adjacent tech, and there's three general channels it can go in otherwise
I feel like <#337805317276565525> is already a fairly busy channel and adding more there specifically wouldn't help that much
though realistically you wouldn't want all the threads popping up individually for every response so idk if current implementation would be sufficient ...
~~arguably threads might be most relevant in this channel so a suggestion can be threaded and a list of them can be easily found, as well as responded to later without having to dig~~
especially now with two shitposting channels
that doesn't really happen in gaming
there was a lot of effort not to quarantine kamen rider fans but they kept dumping like 500+ message bursts
if it is gaming related tech, why separate it from gaming? And when it's not gaming related tech, why force it into that area?
when me and <@868573361377280091> have talked engineering stuff it's been in shitposting channels, because that would be weird to shove in a channel that's primarily gaming-related-tech
the tech that gets brought up in gaming is *super* specific, it's pretty much just PCs and consoles, maybe occasionally monitors and such
it's your art, these are just suggestions
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
my thought though was make the frames slower, not add more
blinking too often, not the blink itself being too fast
horny lank
I also feel like the skin tone's off compared to all the other emotes, but it's better than the existing version
I'd agree with this, it should play slower
I was very uncertain about them at first but if it's a case where they make sense they work well
and stuff that's auto-archived doesn't suddenly get buried it just goes under an "old posts" subheader and disappears from the sidebar for people who were tracking it
threads have the downside of being a pain to sort through for moderation, but at least forums have clear post count and visiblity
one downside though is it would be hard to trial since I'm not sure you can just turn a text channel to forum and back. Couldn't easily swap a section back and forth
threads are pretty hard to moderate, forums seem more manageable
a youtuber's server I'm in has one for latest videos, with one for one-offs, and series in their own ones
I could maybe see a use for them for fancontent? Like have one for each month's prompt, one for general art, general writing, discussion, etc. But that's probably the only place
I mean imo they seem like less convoluted threads since they're more clearly organised and kept open more reliably
asking them to change the text might be easier than raws, which is why I suggested it. A clean version could be added with anything without their knowledge, if they put the text on they know how it's being used
could maybe ask the artist to have versions with different text?
we have US, canada, many EU countries, australia, taiwan, HK and JP from regular users here
which there always will be in a very international server

Buildin a robit
this one works pretty well without paint though, not really anywhere where the colour's off
No paint, I need to start doing that to my kits
a bunch of pieces can come off and form other weapons too while leaving smaller wings
they're *so cool* and 100% why I bought the kit
is a heavy robot too the old style base is struggling
Is done <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
it's Ray Falx
I don't know what this lafargge is <:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
The metal gets hidden nicely in another piece, neat
most of that is covered by the body but I'll probably want to use filler and paint the frame if nothing else
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
actually the main thing I'd say is bad is the included body frame was cut out really poorly and the remains were really obvious crushing
they've injected a little *too* much in a couple places but this one's mostly good on that front
Robot's wings have a metal tube for support. Wonder how heavy they're gonna end up
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

you can replace it with :orig to get full resolution of any image (and I make sure to do that before saving twitter images, you can be missing a lot of size otherwise)
probably twitter auto-selecting a low resolution. the tag on the end determines how big what you see is

intended for plastics and thin because it's designed to flow into cracks and not leave any blobbing, which general purpose super glues might
if you're going to an actual crafts store then rather than super glue tamiya thin cement is recommended
there's also RG real grade which are the same scale as HG but a lot more detailed and their price is closer to MG for that
yes
~~MG Dendrobium~~
3 all the frills
I'm not sure what hitching you're seeing there
huh, neat

they're not ... usually ... just straight out the side of the wood ...
it's definitely much nicer though! just the better design is making it easier to find a few issues like this <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
also I wasn't moving sideways but hit here
the lines are a good choice to help with aim, though there seems to be a slight delay on recognising collisions sometimes? I've had a few stop while I was in the gap, presumably because I clipped a corner while getting into it
It's definitely a more complex thing to do but it could be interesting for future changes
I also assume it's pure random placement of blocks on each row? might be interesting to try looking into generating from a noise function or similar to create continuous walls, or use something similar to wave function collapse to create bigger shapes or corridors to pass through <https://youtu.be/2SuvO4Gi7uY>
it places the player very suddenly. it could do with either a delay before anything moves, or some open space at the start for the player to start deciding what to do (or a mix of both; some rolling distance with movement disabled?)

as is it's a very sudden start with nowhere near enough time for reactions to kick in if you spawn with a block in front of you
you know that the flash is like, 30 nanoseconds, right? Probably less with small nukes?
a lot of it non-ionising radiation, but it's all moving at c
in space radiation is the only effect of a nuke
I'm pointing out a different strategy; missiles can turn, so if they have to spread this stuff out in space, why wouldn't missiles just be aimed around it?
so why wouldn't a missile just go around?
how much of this is being carried if you can fill all of space with it?
also, why would you not just have a shielded nose on the missiles made of this material, so lead missiles could detonate to clear countermeasures while followers punch through to destroy the target
Nukes in space would already be doing damage specifically by blasting away the surface of what they detonate near, because it's an insane amount of energy in the flash

the lives are actually getting translated? <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

Symphogear is special.
turnout is anecdotally good in student and other young people areas, but that won't save losses from older labour voters in the rest of the country
however, they probably won't make back the losses
It has been mostly very pro-brexit areas to announce so far and labour being very iffy on coming down on that issue means they likely lost a lot more there than they will elsewhere
and now the tories want rid of them
but that was when it wasn't the tories in charge so they were good rules
"Sovereignity" or some bs like that which we already have. fuck we basically wrote most of the EU rules
way more expensive to get from the US and way lower quality standards wooo sounds great
like f being british and cya scotland
I am probably going to do fine personally because the industry I'm in is relatively immune to financial crashes and we earn most of our money outside the UK so a local crash also won't hurt us but I just feel fucked right now
the conservatives didn't particularly increase their overall votes this time around it's still a quarter of the country's request, which is hardly a "mandate"
unfortunately because the left cares more about more issues there's more facturing in the big party than the right has which gives the right a major advantage

apparently there was good turnout from the young vote, it's older people who either fell for tory lies like the fake manifesto or were somehow unhappy with the idea of actually getting a say on a deal we understand

Aria: by certain kinds of nerds I mean people like Musk and fans
I won't either, but there's a certain kind of nerd that's obsessed with them and probably gonna get people killed by bringing them in when they're really not ready
"for now" may be true but we're not seeing improvements. For any tech there's the first 10% that's hard to figure out, 80% that's easy once you figure out the core stuff, and another 10% that's almost impossible. Evidence suggests we're in that last 10%, and we *need* that 10% before they can even start competing with human performance
and these stats emerge when the self-driving cars are restricted to really easy roads to drive in good weather, because only california requires them to be published. Human stats come from all places in all weather conditions, and all states of inebriation, and we're still doing better
because much as you do have these occasional idiots causing problems, humans are in general very good at driving. In ways that AI is simply incapable of matching, because it doesn't have the capability of really *understanding* its situation the way a human can. The idiots aren't enough to drag the average down as much as the general incompetence of current AI
Based on the number of times that current self-driving test cars have to have human interference, if you assume only 10% of those would've been an accident without, humans are still considerably safer than self-driving tech. And the performance of the self-driving cars has kinda flatlined recently, they're not making much improvements
despite that though it was extremely well-contained and half the US is actually more radioactive than most of the exclusion zone. All exclusion zones so far implemented in response to nuclear incidents are actually paranoia, and looking at the numbers probably aren't necessary
and with fukushima, there were batteries, which did work - the problem was that those were meant to provide an 8h backup for when the diesel generators powering the pumps needed repairs. Then those generators got flooded, so they had to make a call like "uh ... we need like, 20 new generators. In the next 8 hours ... Yeah, didn't think you'd be able to make that happen."
There aren't actually cheaper alternatives, taken over the nuclear power plant's lifetime. At least for 99% of the world - a few places can have hydro dams more cheaply, but nuclear works out around 3-4 c / kWh. Versus everything else being in the range 10-30
if someone does have a hack like this and is using it on a random paypal phish they're a moron
that's why you don't blow it on random email addresses, because then it *will* be fixed overnight. You try get it on someone valuable and rip them for all they're worth, then disappear
anyone who can silently gain access to a modern smartphone from just opening a webpage is gonna save that to try get it on billionaire's phones, at the very least. Someone who won't notice the amount of money they'd like to try get away with - going after the average person exposes you to too many who would ask questions for too little return, 'cause lol we're all poor but do have smartphones
your phone's probably fine
since you backed out quickly and this app isn't asking to install three others, it's probably legit but just flagging up some manufacturer apps it doesn't recognise
With the modern levels of protection built into the OS it's hard to get phones infected with anything serious. you need to be many layers deep of accepting permissions to install something else that another app downloaded before there's credible threat
tbh I wouldn't trust phone antivirus stuff to not itself be the virus
that is entirely likely with preinstalled bloatware of a new phone
New phone that still has all factory config would ask you to install before it could do anything (unless someone's being REALLY fucking wasteful of a zero day). So long as it didn't prompt you to install paypal app and you didn't accept you're good
WFC specified nazi orientation swastika
three adjectives that 90% of that group refuse to use
Mostly neurotypical. Psychopathy probably got a pass
Same. It would be a great struggle not to deck this guy if I saw him
definitely not an ally to be trusted
Nazis were a lot more than just racist though and definitely would not have simply left japan alone if they gained enough power for them to butt against each other
constructive contribution!
maybe note where to avoid if you can see where he's going
yeah anywhere in europe NA or commonwealth I'd say deck him but not here
what's the odds of japan just not processing the signifcance of the symbolism vs this being the *one* weirdo who's figured out everyone's too polite to deck him
big yike
I assume the swastika is on the armband?
Either way we can appreciate the irony that this German pride themed hoodie would get him arrested in approximately 90 seconds in Germany
There's a possible edge case, given a culture that doesn't really care about the significance, that he just liked the edgy text. Small but possible. Should still get him decked though.
for which they will have to test
they can arrest someone on suspicion for (probably 24 hours) but they can't actually do anything to you beyond that without charging you with a crime
tbh drugs are fun but if they can't have fun without them then they're kinda boring
good thing they're not gonna then if local police are that petty!
even if they *were* going to be dicks
they have better to deal with than a minor they can't make anything stick to
yeah they're not gonna care
Can still depend on where, since there's places like indonesia that's a bit crazy about it. But most of the west doesn't give a toss
so it depends how they'd react
it's not allowed here but I've had friends talk to police while evidently high. As long as you're behaving they don't really care
I wouldn't be scared of that here but that depends how they'd treat it where you are
Possibly she's got it into her head that controversy = being right
WW2 Japan wasn't *good*, but considering the literal feudal era was living memory, they weren't signatories of any western conventions on warfare, and China had given them *plenty* of historical reasons to hate them in particular ... it's hard to criticise that much situationally
11-12 million civilians in ~1941-1945 is pretty unquestionably worse. And doesn't count front line casualties
most reliable figures we have are around 14 million, but that's including enemy combatants and spread over the period 1895 to 1945. Japan wasn't even industrialised when that period started.
the odds of civilian deaths outside the middle east are low, sure, don't freak out about that, but this is definitely a fucked political situation and shit's gonna go down there
nuclear cruise missiles and torpedos exist
Nukes can be used against carriers
Why do you think ICBMs would be the first step?
Well, one got past the drawing board and was shut down the same day it got deployed
we have theoretical designs for ICBM counters but literally none are beyond the drawing board
No, there isn't. No-one's developed anti-ICBM tech precisely because it would cause an impossibly expensive arms race to develop ICBMs that would counter it
oh yeah it's not gonna be the whole world involved but there is a genuine chance of a third nuclear device (or more) being used in anger here
this is either genius authoritarian play or the straw to break the insanity

Gonna be hard to sustain that for ideas like silicon based life if that's what it requires. Carbon does this stuff if you just leave it alone - traces of Bucky balls and nanotubes have been detected in nebula
(or at least doesn't readily form chains, I'm sure some labs have been able to force it)
Silicon doesn't form chains which is where most of carbons weird stuff comes from
Silicon can't do most of it, but has its own tricks with semiconducting
It's good for a lot of reasons for the same reason those same chemicals were able to spontaneously form life. Carbon does weird shit that nothing else in the periodic table can

That's one of the proofs that the universe is of a finite age - all the background stars would build up over time. With a finite age though, not necessarily
That part didn't exist before
There's weirdness based on your definition, because light will always travel at c through the expanding universe. But there is going to be an edge where the space there is receeding from us faster than c - and a photon from there can never overcome that expansion to reach us
well, observed perhaps not. The current extent is believed to be, the universe isn't old enough for us to see far enough to observe it
the universe is already observed to be expanding faster than the speed of light
Well, it becomes irrelevant, not infinite. The usable universe is very finite in such a situation, but the "edge" isn't hard, it's just shooting off into the distance
meaning it's fuggen huge
IIRC as yet they can't detect any
The curvature of the universe (which would allow it to enclose itself) is one of the things attempting to be observed by cosmologists
(the reason for it being almost certainly a shootdown is the fact it came down so quickly; aircraft glide, barring total loss of hydraulics, which is exceptionally unlikely. In that case crew would also radio to report the problem, which they did not, pointing to electrical failure which is then even *more* unlikely to be a coincidence of a mechanical failure in the worst place)
It is almost certainly a shootdown, who is unknown. I only point out that the US has done it before because jumpy missile crews did not think about what was on their screens and thought it was doing things it was not
doesn't prove this one was them, but after they just got missiled a few hours earlier?
I mean the whole situation's fucked the 737 crash looks extremely likely to be a shootdown from the publicly available info and the US *has* previously shot down civilian airliners in Iran because of itchy trigger fingers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air_Flight_655>
I can't imagine any republican accepting such a position so it probably depends whether trump manages to see it that way or not, based on how his advisers can manage to spin it to him
works every time
maybe mute the channels where WW3 memes happen temporarily, if that's your issue?
well, it hurts jack/zuckerberg/et al, but they probably deserve it
and stealth capabilities are greatly exaggerated. Literally none of the US's stealth aircraft have actually passed their stealth trials in practice, they're all more detectable than designed
Again making up what I'm saying, I've at no point claimed this could be an AAM ...
Your own argument earlier is that the US is nowhere nearby so cannot be involved. Now it's likely that a US response got in totally unnoticed for hundreds of miles and is flying away from Tehran?
We have no perspective in the video to gauge its angle
No, I'm saying that seems more likely than Iran shooting down an aircraft well within their own airspace. Your last statement was that the pictures of such debris had not surfaced yet
You're really trying to misrepresent what I'm saying huh?
Funding insurgents isn't a specific false flag operation ... they would have likely had such weapons for a while and just happened to be in this location. I've not seen such statements and they don't appear in articles linked so far, so source?
which is why the altitude graph has a weird sudden climb in many diagrams, because it starts at zero when there's no data then jumps to the takeoff altitude
The articles give the data from the automatic position reporting which is altitude above mean sea level. Tehran is 3300 ft above mean sea level
given that another shootdown happened at greater range
I am pointing out that it's well within range of MANPADs
It was 5000 ft above ground level, whereas https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Baghdad_DHL_shootdown_incident was 8000 ft above ground level
The 2003 Baghdad shootdown involved a MANPAD and was a hit at the same altitude
They have a lot more than just 5,000 ft range (as the ground in that area is at over 3,000 ft ASL)
Until I actually see that confirmed I won't take it as fact, but also SAM launchers will have considerable range that they could be well outside the capital
There are plenty of shoulder-mounted anti-air missiles
Ukraine have the most interest in getting truth so I'll probably believe whatever they come out with after they get to talk to all sides and find out what everyone knows
The US are claiming it was Iran that launched it, but after the WMD story manufacturing consent I have to <:doubt:484139588089282580> that they can know such so early and would have to side with Iran denying that it was them. Far more likely to be insurgents, and given that they're in Iran, probably US-funded (or Russia) ones. Unlikely there's any connection to the Iranian govt - funding insurgents against *yourself* is a galaxybrain-dumb move
It is odd, but I would have to assume they just wanted to get something out that would calm things because of the political situation. Without knowing all details it is far more likely to be a failure (human or technical), but the details just don't add up for that
It also takes time to get black box data, so for now all they have is the same publicly available info as we have + direct access to crash site. None of those would be enough to conclude a mechanical failure, even if it was. Ukraine notably disagrees with the idea, and unlike Iran Ukraine actually has a strong aviation industry
I'm not saying it was the US, just noting that possibility. Re: statements of a failure: that first quote is exactly the statement that was retracted and is not the position of the iranian govt, and the second is clearly responding to the idea that *iran* would shoot it down.
for refusing to hand over the black box: they're holding them to co-investigate this with the Ukraine. Which is kinda understandable if it looks like a potential shootdown, you know you didn't shoot it down, and the US have previously shot down one of your airliners. Plus with how much the FAA overlooked with the MAX on Boeing's behalf, it's dubious how beholden to fair investigation they are
There has been no official stance announced by Iran as a nation, however
Iran do not have an official stance. One person stated it was a fire based on a presumption that a missile strike would instantly break up the aircraft entirely - which isn't true, and also isn't proven that it didn't break up and impact in a small area
Iran aren't insistent that it was mechanical failure. The Ukrainian foreign minister in Iran initially claimed it was, likely to try calm the situation, but retracted that statement just a couple hours later. Claiming an engine failure would be extremely premature with so little info, but it's enough info to strongly point against any simple mechanical failure
Pretty much the only previous incident to even vaguely resemble what happened here is TWA 800, and that's not repeating. Especially not on a recent well maintained aircraft. And while mistaken target seems unlikely just saying the words, it has happened before
most accurate comment
welp
The US fuckup was also caused by miscommunication, since the order was given by someone not actually observing the screen and was confused by the response of the person who had the cursor wrong. That should be less likely here - both operators can see the radar screen and assess for themselves - but clearly *something* fucked up so maybe that is it
The Tor might not be as old as you think - M1 introduced in 2005 - but I don't know the age of the F-16's current systems
If it *was* a failure then even with ATC informing them, the Tor wouldn't be aware. But then we should also find out from ATC that they were failing to squawk and the pieces should be coming together faster than this
Theoretically could happen but I've not heard of it happening before, so I don't know how likely that is
so now I want to know what actually happened
it's still almost certainly their fuckup but it actually takes some effort to fuck up with this hardware
https://youtu.be/SKLFAO5die4 okay not bringing this up to disagree but this video has lots of interior (and even images of the displays), and while this isn't super-modern it's certainly a long way from scanning beams with blips. The radar screen displays ID (so they should have seen it was squawking as a civilian) and the optics are readily available
cut losses, leave, and *if requested* back they could come back in small numbers
they do need help and troops can theoretically provide humanitarian aid, but US troops have failed to do that and under trump they're definitely not going to be ordered to try
And hard agree that this is still plenty of reason to not get involved. Things basically cannot improve
I was expecting to agree that it wouldn't help ID, but if it does have an IR filter it probably should be able to identify an airliner, having quickly run the numbers. 1200 nm IR through a 1 cm aperture can theoretically resolve 1.4m features at 12 km (the system's maximum range). Being military it wouldn't quite get maximum performance, but the aperture is a lot larger than 1 cm and the relation between aperture and resolution is a linear inverse relationship (10 cm would be 0.14m resolution)

However given the description that it's meant to assist when dealing with a lot of ECM, it's possible it just wasn't being used given the radar worked
"To allow engagements in the ECM heavy environment that is the modern battlefield, the 9K332 is equipped with an optical tracking system, complementing the main radar." perhaps wasn't actually used then
reading the specs of the Tor system closely I notice an optical tracking system in the M1 so now I want to know if that has FLIR and what kind of resolution it should expect
With this evidence, yeah, Iran seems likely. But they also should have known from one of their SAMs reporting a launch, so their actions are odd; still saying they'd allow the Ukraine to help when Ukraine has no reason to help them cover up
and while it's similar the folding mechanism of the fins is slightly different and the head has too many curves
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/9%D0%9C330_missiles.jpg this is best reference I've found (ofc wiki is using it), but M1 uses the 9K331 rather an 9M330. Can't find images specifically of that
That is too large for a MANPAD, yes. Doesn't quite match the images for a Tor that I can see but they're from the model previous to Tor M1 so possibly there was a change
If you can you have a much higher quality video than I do
I can't see that the missile comes from miles away, because I can't tell whether it's approaching or leaving the camera
I am not insisting on that, I am considering it a possibility, given that the US has funded many insurgents in that area previously and provided many with SAMs
You're only going to tell operators to be on such high alert for areas that they're actually likely to catch a US response in. Telling someone to be on high alert well behind your own lines with no evidence of a takeoff to try intercept is not very likely
Reading comprehension: it's likely *from the perspective of the SAM operator* who then chooses to attempt to fire at it
... Except I have not proposed that the US flew in and did this. That's entirely in your head
you'll only get something that can hold a bullet and set it off in roughly the right direction with 3D printing, so it's not a threat of enabling mass shootings outside the US. Just makes assassination-type attacks more possible, if you can find the ammo
It's normal for it to be weeks before an air accident starts getting seriously cleared up, and there's solutions to scavenging like offering to pay for those parts. After taking pictures of what's already there, so you can tell if someone's trying to give you a part they just picked up
as others say do research but to say weed is dangerous combined with meds would have to be talking about a *very* specific medicine known to have an interaction with it - it's not something that can be taken as a general statement
your body actually produces and uses cannabinoids naturally, weed just gives you a kick of a bunch more
there *can* be interactions with drugs but they're not that common (outside of a few groups where they're *very* common - don't mix paracetamol at random), but weed is almost never involved in these interactions
Which is probably more than a bale weighs
pretty much the only way weed is deadly is by having a bale of it fall on you

sites have been legally obligated for near two decades now
DMCA would say otherwise to "isn't legally obligated to give a shit"
That's what you have to do now, without as forceful laws protecting it and making the site in the wrong, so ...
There's no recourse path with the EU for violations of laws based on the article, since that's not the EU's job, though it can be taken up with them if you don't think your country's implementation matches the requirements of the article
Punishment is dependent on local laws - EU articles specify a legal structure that EU states must implement in a way compatible with their local laws, so as is it's just a relative requirement that fair use failures must be punished comparable to the unreasonable copyright violations
The initial proposal I'm not sure was as strongly pro-fair-use but that's the point of starting it as a proposal and then making revisions. Current version bans blanket filters and punishes failure to uphold fair use much more strongly than it forces removal of copyrighted material
which would be why sites actually don't like it because it forces them to actually put effort into their moderation rather than follow the DMCA pattern of accept all demands and ask questions later
article 13 actually *increases* protections on fair use - sites only have to make reasonable effort to remove copyrighted content that is not fair use, but *any* unjustified removal is *immediately* in violation of the article. There's no "reasonable effort" clause on protection of fair use
you wouldn't be able to hide that, even as china
or even 1,000
and any local legal requirements for stuff like this are incredibly dumb because basically every sporting body has already implemented (at least somewhat) reasonable regulations regarding which team is allowed based on actual biology rather than assumed-from-having-a-peen-or-not-twenty-plus-years-ago

It's been explicitly stated for a while that one of the major Tory motivations for it was getting rid of human rights that get in their way
Maybe not explicitly but doing it so fast no-one has time to even read the law, would certainly instigate investigation. And the particular subject matter would get called out hard too
At least our journalism can manage solidarity even if most of it is owned by someone in the Tory side
Wow it did not take them fucking long to start leaning hard on trump tactics without the EU breathing down their necks
almost anything else would be a fix to some extent
what you've gotta do isn't hard either there's plenty of other voting models mathematically proven to be better, and plenty that are actually implemented to try also. The difficulty is getting any such changes passed when the extant parties are favoured by FPTP + bulk vote simplification
plus simplifying all the votes to "two votes per state" eliminates not-insignificant conservative votes within the cities.

Nowhere in the west is currently sitting at 80% inflation in 5 years
less in relative numbers
12-15 is as much (in absolute numbers) as california just did last month
California's already started with the first big hike, businesses aren't fleeing
that prices will rise in proportion is a right-wing talking point to deflect and avoid doing so
Historical evidence and actual maths says otherwise
UBI is similar, it is not fundamentally flawed and will not simply leave people in poverty. The major issue with UBI schemes that have issues is that they tend to be trying to replace *all* benefits, which doesn't work - not everyone has the same basic cost of living. Disabled people need specialised housing, or special equipment. Diabetics need electricity guaranteed to keep their insulin refrigerated
historical evidence bears this out that you won't simply be left in the same place, things will improve, and also points out another factor: with more disposable income, people spend more, the economy develops faster, and prices actually tend to trend *down* relatively. Usually still an absolute increase, but that theoretical 5% is more likely to become 2-3% in reality
just want to point out re: minimum wage and price inflation: raising the minimum wage always increases it by more than the relative cost of goods increases, so you only have to increase it by enough to compensate. Not all of a product's cost goes to minimum wage workers - in most cases, a minority of it does. If 50% of it is paying minimum wage workers involved in the supply chain, then an increase in minimum wage of 10% increases the cost by 5%
... Weird order, from my perspective at least. While it's certainly not a prerequisite simply based on the complexity we did matrices after calculus
My job is salaried but uses flexitime and counts up the hourly total according to what you need in a week. If I had a deal I could work saturday mornings I'd absolutely be able to take those four hours out of other days.

(granted flexitime can't work at a shop but still, if the contract is for total hours worked I don't know how they can demand more legally)
They're demanding 44 hours a week on a (presumably) 40 hour contract
time doesn't suddenly stop counting on a weekend
that ... doesn't seem legal?

the only obligation would be the threat of not being voted in next time but when I'm pretty sure most aren't voted in, and those that are are simple majority that's easy to please, it's kinda easy to exploit
and even when they do, millions of votes get filtered down to like two (which don't necessarily even get distributed as the vote was), meaning loads of votes are literally pointless in both directions

that is intended to help the people and it is not an inefficient use (assuming the city is accessible enough and the sports interesting enough to produce the tourism)
city govt is a different scale then since that is more directly profitable to the people of the city by promoting tourism

those are private investment

we don't have specific instructions but the plan is just clearly "ok if there's a big risk everyone just go home and work from there until it blows over"
which is *fun*
So work is doing assessments of who is capable of working from home and what stuff they need in the event of a coronavirus outbreak
that's ... a problem
... why not just ... not drink it tho
... I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to even drink that much *water* in a day

99% of the people who have been diagnosed - not just sick, but sick enough to be of interest to medical authority - have recovered safely
which is why there's now big pushes for education on it in the community because being aware of this is a *big deal* you can massively change how it goes from treated normal life to totally unaffected
It can be suppressed with very little effect on normal life now, and if you *know* you've just been exposed, there *is* a vaccine that's effective if started within a day or two
which it's still nonsense even happens
actually why am I even surprised this isn't even a govt vote this is just a party thing

literally mr burns style so many other things trying to kill him the virus can't get in
at his age and absurd health, if he has it and survives, that's the only way it's happening
they had better, but the current estimates aren't until next year. After we're likely to see a resurgence
especially if the estimates that 10x more people are infected but never showed symptoms are accurate. If that's right, it's far beyond containment already
and given other coronaviruses survive through the summer, just don't spread well, it's probably safer to assume this one will behave similarly. It's not going to go away like SARS and avian flu did, this is probably going to become one of the yearly set that goes around
Right now we can track where outbreaks are starting and direct resources towards those locations to manage it, whereas future outbreaks will be unpredictable as it will be lots of small starting points. I assume that if the health minister is advising this, UK hospitals have the capacity
That highly depends what model is used and we don't know the long-term model that best reflects this one yet
and a possible (not guaranteed) consequence of that is that we don't achieve that 60% herd immunity, so come the cold weather again it hits back way harder than it would have if we just try deal with it now
(the 0.2% death rate in adults stat is also *not* healthy adults, it's *all* adults under 50. Hide the 0.2% vulnerable group from exposure and that can easily drop to nigh zero)
it is not actually a terrible idea to quarantine the vulnerable, try get everyone else through it quickly with lots of exposure, and then carry on as normal
achieving that 60% herd immunity would prevent that since there's not enough people for a new outbreak to latch onto and get to the vulnerable people again
I'm going to agree with "the quote isn't proposing we do it intentionally", but also note that by shutting everything down now, we do run a risk of letting pockets of it bide their time over summer, when it's less likely to infect, and then come back with a vengeance when it gets cold again since it can be seeded from all over the planet
cold is caused by a whole range of stuff that has the same mild effect and doesn't need targeted treatment so we don't bother distinguishing
around 15% of common colds are coronaviruses (not checked flu but probably also)
it'd be like trying to hammer in a protruding screw. Yes, it could work, but it would be much smarter to use a screwdriver.
particularly from people who *are* that committed to each other, and want the financial benefits of it, but don't want kids
I mean, on a technical level, there's no reason it wouldn't work. But if you made it so all marriages are by default until kids are 20 or however exactly is being proposed I think you'd get way more opposition than it's worth versus just making more options viable
This is true, but "marriages often fail or are cheated in" is a conclusion from such statistics, but when actually analysed more thoroughly they don't support that conclusion
Therefore statistics would say a two person monogamous relationship is fine in most cases. It doesn't need to be dismantled. But other types should be opened up for recognition
This does fail to account for people who never make splitting official, granted, but it also can't account for someone who would've been a single marriage but managed to end up with a four marriage person
While I agree unconventional relationships like that are good and should be normalised, I have to disagree with any premise that marriages typically fail. Around 50% of *marriages* fail - but a vastly disproportionate number of those marriages have at least one partner who was on their third or fourth. When you try account for this, something like 80% of *people* will be married for life. Most marriages appear to work out
that would seriously depend on what you know about them but death certificates are generally public record and usually say location

though I did overhear him talking with the other swedish guy (who handles interviewing) and I don't think they were being particularly negative about the place, so I assume it's at least way better than Rockstar or similar

the only things that have been proven with gluten are coeliac's and *some* people can suffer bowel irritation from it, but the latter case suffer irritation from many more complex molecules in foods like lactose and fructose, it's a difficulty with getting enzymes to break them down. It certainly doesn't make you hyper or anxious in anything that's been peer-reviewed
in light of that universities would've probably set up the network themselves given a few more years
networking, name serving, routing, interaction layers, including http itself, were all university projects built on top without any military input, because universities wanted them

I've seen worse from "normal" people
ah okay pranking is a different matter
idk, I know that kinks like that are *more* common among furries but far from dominant so I would hope if such happened it was a more "specialist" con (that also paid for cleanup)
there is also an association with certain groups of actual furries who do *weird* stuff a bit too publicly, but idk how much that's people actually *starting* to dislike them for those reasons, or just finding that and using it as their reason. Similar to some queer people who take things way beyond anyone's definition of child-friendly at pride parades
that's "we've only just started spreading and it's not hit yet"

... okay we may be handling this badly but america is probably not gonna handle this well
genius
trump saying he's already considering loosening what restrictions are in place before NYC even has 1 person recovered
People *will* recover. But it also means it's not seeing the worst of the deaths yet
that's not no recovery that's "the wave started too recently to recover"
confirmed cases is growing slower than the "moderate control" rate but I suspect that would be more to do with insufficient kits
what's their growth rate on the deaths? Since that's more certain than total cases, and it should be growing around 20% per day under moderate control (china early stages, most of europe)
some vaccines also work slightly after exposure (HIV being notable). This won't really be relevant here though because exposure tracking is so difficult
just none that the family are choosing to mention (or possibly believe)

This is true, but the goal of defunding it is to make it bad enough that they can promote other ideas as being somehow better
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164> this, I just point out this waiting list issue because it's one of the go-tos for anti-single-player people to claim is an example of how awful it could be. When it's only bad for a few services, and generally it's only *become* had recently with the wannabe republicans in charge
also: long waiting lists are a much more recent thing with the NHS due to how defunded the tories have pushed it to be. they're running as many slots as they can
and the result is that healthcare insurance, where it exists, is also much cheaper
what you *can* do is have a single main government payer, that cannot be denied access to treatments legally, but let insurance companies operate in competition with it if they choose to. This is what pretty much every country in europe does
multi-payer has the issue that the ultimate customer (the person) doesn't have the ability to directly make any choice in what they get; particularly when much of it is for emergency care. The payers then start negotiating different weird deals like exclusivity in exchange for favourable pricing and try market their offerings towards groups that won't cost them as much and it starts getting fucky with things being less available. You have to start restricting them so much it may as well be a single payer system
if you made healthcare single-payer, you'd pay *less* taxes for it in the US, because it would gain that negotiating power it currently lacks
... the conversation in here is kinda bemusing to read, because the US, per capita, pays *more* tax money into healthcare than basically any european country. And then pays *as much* in private care again, which no european country does.

This is entirely because medicare and medicaid have to provide coverage to people who can't afford it, but are not allowed to negotiate their own prices. They just have to accept whatever jacked up price the insurance companies have decided to extract out of people.
Senate and house are important but they're ultimately not really in place to represent your area, and you still have the direct vote for the president which is important because of all the power he has
a push for a third party in mcnowhereville in india or the UK will at least put that party in charge of mcnowhereville, which is something
meaning one small push for a third party in mcnowhereville is worthless
in the US you're literally voting for the president and nothing else
Sub, I'm assuming it's similar to the UK system and yes this system is somewhat better than the US. But it's still worse than being able to rank your choices
IT's still worse than ranked voting
when you're voting for a single person at the top local movements are pointless
Voting for sub-areas first improves things slightly because you don't need a nationwide movement in order to have an effect, a local movement can induce *some* change
in the main election, vote for the guys opposing the ones you don't like, even if you don't like them either, else you're wasting the vote
your only negotiation in the US is in primaries, tell the party what you want them to do
which is already unlikely in FPTP and made even moreseo with the EC
Negotiating power is ultimately worthless if there's no risk of one of the top two parties *actually* being displaced
The electoral college greatly amplifies that effect though as even to change who one of the two parties *is* you need a *nationwide* shift towards the *same* third party
and swapping a painting literally isn't even literature ...
... is jay-z even left wing
there's flaws with every system including condorcet. but anything with ranking/points is better
Yeah that wouldn't happen they're happy presenting someone people vote for
so it's advantageous for republicans to spread ideas like third party
democrats don't reliably vote party line and left wing in general is more easily split by other options
it would be quite safe for them to try a new flavour and see if it took
Not hugely, because the candidates would be selected in the primaries and then republicans reliably vote party line
There is a definite severe bias in which party does this kind of stuff and none of this favours the democrats, they have no reason to encourage it
3rd parties not being wasted is an intentionally spread idea by the republicans to split people who aren't 100% happy with the main party on their side (which are more likely to be democrat)
With the price of nitro and *roughly* knowing what servers cost I would be surprised if they were not profitable
I mean discord is pretty obviously just nitro subscriptions. I fully acknowledge I paid it but it's expensive AF for what it is and for what it costs them to host so little data
not sure how it is trying to get access as a personal account though, it's very group/company oriented
Not used it extensively but it works, video and audio work, are understandable, haven't had major connection issues
work stopped everyone using Zoom a while back and made everyone use microsoft teams, which does have a guest feature not many people know about
but we don't know how many people there are just in one server to talk to some friends
in a lot of popular servers it feels like more
It's very hard to judge what % they would be
It's very back-of-the-~~envelope~~brain maths so can't offer much maths, but considering what kind of hosting you can get for less than what nitro costs (actually a fair bit these days; certainly LOTS of storage), and that it's fairly common amongst heavy users to *have* nitro (and the light users won't be what costs it)
the r/ftm subreddit is a lot more active than the r/mtf one, but the impression I have from that is just that trans men are a lot more likely to stick to the one community while trans women are a lot more likely to move around. I wouldn't be confident saying there's more trans women online, but you might find more of us in more random spots
and especially when it's friendly enough that the first few are happy enough to mention it regularly, new people looking around will notice it and are much more likely to stay <:ChrisPeek:687463586381168698>

what you describe with not having felt joy in a long time sounds more like depression, which *can* be caused by ADHD, but it's far from the first cause to look at
lectric: brain hormones are A) not well understood, B) a lot more complicated than "low dopamine = sad". While bursts of dopamine are associated with feeling happy, chronically low dopamine is more associated with poor focus (hence ADHD and similar being treated with dopamine-boosting drugs) than being unhappy
but remember kids this is a lesson not to pre-order! ~~definitely the same kind of situation~~

Literally nothing
Literally nothing except for the effort it would take
(well, not airlines directly since this is purchase of crude, but there's companies that try to just directly refine and offload it and others that try to store)
for companies that actively use it (like airlines) it'll cost more to store and resell the oil than they could possibly profit off it
explanation I've seen: futures trading. companies have already prebought at previous prices, they're now trying to offload those orders so that they don't have to pay to store that oil (so it's effectively being bought up by places that *can* afford to store it)
What you do is assert that water is not wet because being wet is the state of being covered in water
not that I disagree but trying to petition something so vague is hard. really needs to list some actual requirements / point out specific instances

at least has a higher ratio of water than CO2 for the energy release but it's still more finite sources that pollute
which is another *consistent* failure across all instances of capitalism - the (basic) models assume rational agents, which don't exist
even if it means taking a loss to win their bid
100% agree but at this level, it's not really the same, because the demand isn't "I'm plugged in and need to use power", it's "this country needs to scale up baseline load by X MW by Y year, make offers". There's much more room for actual competition there. But the companies competing aren't rational agents, they're still run by people, it's simpler for them to build the same thing they did last time rather than pay for a cheaper solution that isn't what they normally do
even when nuclear and renewable would've been cheaper, big investors are usually oil companies, and they have preferred to go with more oil-based sources, just becaus they're lazy
rather than selling to the consumer
where they organise things like what powerplants are built
This is true but I'm talking about the pre-utilities level
as such it's only recently with subsidies pushing to make other sources of energy *notably* cheaper that major investment happened
see: energy generation. Both nuclear or green options would be entirely viable methods of increasing profit for energy companies, and have many times been cheaper than fossil fuels. Those energy companies have stuck with fossil fuels until recently, even despite times when nuclear and renewable would be cheaper, because it's just easier to continually scale up what you're already doing and spend money to suffocate competition
eh, capitalism uses resources in *one* efficient way. Precisely because of that end goal
The quote about evil's greatest ally isn't really aimed at small-scale encounters. It's aimed at fascist takeover
I mean, it's not unambiguous to me, but that's only under a condition of "do they seem like they're actually going to hurt anyone". If they just seem like they want hostages to keep themselves protected for now, and it seems likely they'll want to run away clean later - they're probably not gonna kill anyone, don't fight. If they're legitimately doing this to spread fear and are likely to kill someone, fight back 100%

Yeah, in this case I was just wondering which show in particular you were thinking of so I could note to avoid it, but it's now obvious that was konosuba (which I didn't know about before)

> slaves wouldn't stab you in the back
<:doubt:484139588089282580>
yeah that's dumb
but explicitly having them as slaves, no
if it's somehow needed to gain some respect in the world, then maybe *fake* it, but explicitly don't treat them as slaves. Pay them, give them their option to roam and do what they want as you go forth as an adventuring group
how is owning child slaves necessary, exactly
which is what you'd argue if you tried to make S1 fine sympathetic
but instead no he's the ~good~ slave owner
exactly this. Naofumi is the protagonist hero, and not presented as an anti-hero. You're supposed to side with him as he does awful things that did not have to be necessary. He could've chosen to sacrifice whatever advantages he gained from having slaves, or chosen to fake it but clearly treat them as not slaves at all (not treat them as a good slave owner, but make it clear they're *not* at all)
I didn't feel that. IT was more "even the craziest might do the "right" thing in the end. They're still the worst"
naofumi is
Ver was entirely selfish but also clearly not meant to be a sympathetic character
and the treatment is WAY different
Those aren't relevant to the immediate convo though, I was only bringing up where it makes a direct comparison to shield hero because child slavery is in both
both phases are clearly WAY BAD for chris
This isn't even a shitty thing that geah promotes, because it does a very good job of clearly never showing this to be a good thing
quick take: sympho does both aspects of this (child slavery and then stockholm syndrome to a "saviour") far better and it's a subplot
but it also doesn't actively present it as bad
That's one of the reasons. I saw lots of people already getting unhappy with her before that based on the content of her videos kinda shifting from deconstruction to just being the exact shit thing it was trying to deconstruct
pretty sure majority of her base is right-wingers using her as "the one good trans"
I don't think I know any actual trans servers that like her any more?
a mindless weapon doing only exactly what it was designed to
what about the noise, though?
You can understand how fine got there, but even she agrees she shouldn't have and that she shouldn't be the one trying to improve things
her ending is good because she pretty much says explicitly "I cannot be forgiven, I'm just awful. The only thing I can do is let someone better replace me."
but yes don't just look for "this is a must-do thing"
you can have both
Wait, *you're* finé?
I mean that statement's definitely not true, but what that guy's saying is *way* iffy

guilt tripping isn't necessarily intentional and they might think they're being reasonable, but it's still guilt tripping and especially when this strong you can't be tolerating it

because there's a *lot* of that stuff in straight IPs as well
I'm pretty sure the "issue", as such, is simply that there's not as much yuri and so having the same distribution of other genres makes the abundance of high school slice of life more obvious
I mean, I don't necessarily see that the problem you see is actually occurring. Yes, if you search for yuri genre by recent then most are going to be slice of life things - but the exact same thing happens, pretty much, if you select romance in general
G's does, however, confirm that sleeping in the same bunk was *hibiki*'s idea
you're missing out on amazing then

you have no better option than biden right now, and not going for him results in a worse option
That's still opportunity to delay things until someone better can be voted in
better than radically moving the courts further right
again
"the rudder will be in the middle" isn't a reason to ignore the fact it's hard right
He's not going to add *more* republicans
<:doubt:484139588089282580>
with another four years of trump expect the total undoing of democracy pretty much. Term limits gone, even more packed courts
that's already better
He won't do more
yell at the people who refuse to let better run later
when those margins are the ones wanting to build the wall and destroy all social safety nets altogether, fuckin take it
he's a doofus but he ain't trump
I have to wonder how edited the quoting in that tweet, is. There's some weird pauses that sound to me like someone's editing together unrelated soundbites
keep voting in spite of having bad options else people aren't gonna try cater to what you say
> In the last primary election, voters aged 18 to 44 were key to Sanders’ primary victory in Michigan. According to CNN exit polls, that age group represented 45 percent of the share of Democratic voters in the state in 2016, and favored the Vermont senator by a margin of 33 percent.
> But this year, those younger voters represented a smaller share of voters who went to the polls in Michigan, at just 37 percent. And although 57 percent of this 18-44 age group favored Sanders, Biden’s support among voters aged 45 and older was wider — 63 percent of these older voters favored the former vice president, while just 24 percent supported Sanders.
facts show that they didn't, no matter how much twitter buzz you saw
and they didn't
*this was young people's fucking chance to vote for someone further left*
> Consider Texas: According to NBC News’s exit polls, the Democratic electorate actually skewed older in Tuesday’s primary compared to past primaries. In 2008 and 2016, 13 and 18 percent of the electorate, respectively, was 65 and older. In 2020, it was 24 percent.
He doesn't try *because you don't vote*
in this kind of situation an invalid vote is pretty much a vote for trump but it's better than not voting
Not with that attitude
because they vote
if you actually showed that you will vote then there'll be some effort to listen to you
there's no point
because younger voters don't
why do you think there's so little effort to appeal to younger voters
at least if you vote then saying "I want someone left" means something
not voting for him is a sign you don't care and aren't worth trying to attract in the first place
collapsed govts don't tend to be an improvement
It results in lots of death and you're presuming things would be able to improve after
you don't *have* a long term with more trump
long term you're looking at en masse deaths from more trump or less deaths from not
You don't have another option right now. Either things get worse or stay about the same. Why would you choose worse?
Bernie had a lot of issues around him and was thrown under the bus by the democrat leadership. Change those.
you can't make it a left turn now and it'll be too late later
stop the right turn now and work to make it into a left turn later
Only if you assume you won't and make no effort to make it happen
because they put actual effort into the design
nendos are very obviously nendos but also very obviously the character and series' style
there's a lot of pressure for him to do that, but it takes time to see effects from that
when it's really not
popularising the message of just "not voting for biden" results in a lot of people who choose to go along wit that thinking no vote is fine
and whenever discussing this, do make it clear that "not voting for biden" means "going to cast a spoilt vote"
Make sure everyone else does
not voting says "trump is fine"
not voting says you don't care what happens
that says you will put in the effort to say "fuck you"
if you're so determined not to vote, as stupid as it is when trump's an option, cast a spoilt vote
You don't try catch younger voter's interest if they're not going to vote anyway and it'll lose the ones who will vote
If you're not going to listen to *why* they don't try to appeal to you it's no wonder you're missing why they don't
because younger voters don't
it's *explicitly* the logic *every* party has stated they use for not appealing to younger voters
It's really not
show that your demographic will vote and they'll go "oh, okay, there's votes to be won here. How do we do that?" and they will come and ask what they need to do
Political parties have explicitly stated they make no effort to appeal to younger generations *because they don't vote*. Not voting for biden continues this not listening
and trump is worse on every count imaginable and about twenty more that aren't
As bad as that is, with the *fucking presidency*, there's bigger issues to hand
Then you're not owed a candidate who'll listen to you if you'll so easily just let someone like trump in
exactly as you're saying you will do
ie; people who refused to vote at all
it was *lost* votes to *no-one* on the democrat side that lost it
Trump got *less* votes than *losing* republicans
moderate dems did largely vote for hillary
not voting means there's no reason to believe you ever will
because there are people who will actually vote for a bad pick
Again, that attitude will result in *never* getting what you consider a good pick
meanwhile there was so much worse on trump
That attitude is why Hillary was able to be taken down by the fucking emails meme
they appeal to the people who they believe will *actually* vote
also, the fact younger voters are more informed on covid is irrelevant. Yes, it's prudent that you don't go and make the covid issue worse. It's also *another* reason you're not gonna be listened to by political parties if you're more easily dissuaded from voting
So don't support the republicans by spreading more doubt on biden and ruining his chances there

the ability to produce such items would be communally owned, and individuals would be able to create such items (likely by trading something they could do from the person who originally designed it, if they couldn't themselves)
complicated question because the original thing wouldn't actually arise as-is in the first place
but fair that the game isn't a required part
if that were the goal though there'd be more focus on those modes - and probably a corresponding uptick in model scale/quality

I mean yeah warhammer I'd not categorise the same as nendoroids or bandai kits
there's some effort to some of them so I'd put them more halfway, but yes
whereas funko is just pumping out to make sure there's always stuff to push to whales
would still be like $50k spent on it or more, but it would've been affordable over that period
whereas with nendos, because of the effort put into the design and limited quantity, it wouldn't be *that* insane to have bought them all as they released
funkos are mass produced even on a *Design* level to produce as many different things to take in as possible
ofc, this does have an obvious consequence: there's just over 1000 different nendos, but there's over 8000 different funko pops

trust is not such an easy thing, and you don't owe it to this one. But you do need one you can trust

humans are fallible so there's certainly a number of cases of them failing to uphold that

if you can't trust your therapist you need a new one
therapists, at least partly, are just there to help you work through issues. IF you don't express that these are issues they may ignore it for other things

creating reasonable doubt in your alibi, etc
a working system probably should have a mediocre rate, yes. There's going to be uncertain cases that need the pressure of a court to actually uncover the truth (more investigations justified), but you need to balance not too much pressure that you get false confessions
there's probably issues of corruption too, but they don't throw everything they can and see what sticks like the US
it has more to do with them only pursuing cases that have a *lot* of evidence

he knows exactly how much could "reasonably" be used
he kept choking beyond the point of unconsciousness. He's a cop. how is that possibly not intentional

eeeh not really

Iiii don't think any videogame marketing really sells that?
because you didn't give your vote to the one who stood a chance
which is why it's mathematically impossible to have a lot of parties - if you refuse to vote for a more popular candidate who's similar to you, while those who are dissimilar are fine all gathering around the same one, those who are dissimilar to you win
FPTP is different to that entry bar - with FPTP, if you don't win, you get nothing. US has FPTP for president and for each seat in both houses of govt, there's none assigned for how many votes a party got

I mean when you force someone to deal with the bare minimum supplies to clean toilets then it'll be a tough sell, but say if it was mostly automated, they largely just maintained the automation and only got involved on rare occasions? There *are* plenty of people who just like to be helpful and would probably be willing to do that job. Just make it not literally the worst thing imaginable and you get more interest in really crap jobs than you might expect
"In the blood" not at all true. That's entirely societal and is not observed everywhere. It won't be easy but it is entirely possible to change that
It would be good to move past that too, but that's harder to replace and still have things happen. We can at least attack the capitalism built on top of that
in many cases with military or business funding, but that's an arbitrary point of where the funding came from - the research was pushed by the people who wanted to do it, and then they found someone they could blag into doing it
semiconductor transistors, essential for all computing: university projects. All networking advances: university projects. Lithium batteries: university projects. So fucking many medical advances: university projects

No, they didn't, it was purely them in themselves being "free". So it's of limited comparison
It's a sample of what the human condition would do in that situation. The only difference with all of humanity is removing the sense of "I have this because I am somehow superior"

(possibly even for all govts)
so long as this is the kind of govt you're dealing with politics will always be stressful
(to be clear, I 100% believe there'll be some - it's inevitable in this much chaos. I've not seen evidence that it's widespread enough to be the point of concern here, though I'll 100% say anyone involved in the protests plz do try stop anyone you see possibly looting small businesses)
possibly but reports are mixed whether that's actually happening. Or, especially, by whom - seen some noting that there are some pharmacies completely wrecked while the stores around them are untouched - *exactly* the same as happened in Baltimore with the GTTF
which is why they want this to end as soon as possible and will latch onto anything like pushing people towards the idea that this hurts minorities. It hurts less than extrajudicial murder
it does far *more* to hurt the govt when they have to spend so much trying to deal with the protests and riots all the while they're losing tax money from businesses that are no longer generating business
there'll be some delay getting new product to people who need it but there's plenty of volunteers helping with that

I mean if you move country outright you're always gonna have trouble, countries against it are gonna be against civil partnership as well, so you may as well push for full recognition rather than acknowledge their bigotry. When you're on holiday though, as foreign citizens I'm pretty sure their obligation would be to return the body anyway and therefore their recognition is not that important
(besides which they have explicitly created a recognition path that same-sex couples use to get the equivalent of power of attorney)
and how would that impact anything in the suggested situation
what would the PRC have to do with it
I think giving them that choice would invite more division to happen again and the answer should be saying "f you it's marriage"
just living together doesn't need any laws around it
civil partnership *is* legally recognised, though
is there a functional purpose of having something distinct from marriage for it? if so cool let everyone have that option and the option for marriage

rules generally do not apply retroactively
and with how little of the cost is uranium, probably still being very conservative about how much more expensive we could accept
glancing through that report, it's better than some I've seen since it accounts for price variations, but yeah it's entirely focussed on mining
(And none of this accounts for thorium, either, which has virtually-fresh mine deposits and can also be extracted from seawater the same way)
but anything that's quoting around 200 for current usage is definitely not accounting the seawater extraction, which is a demonstrated technology but simply not implemented due to lack of demand, we use so little uranium that even the mines overproduce wildly
The number has fluctuated a bit, partly because of things like the (very large & plentiful) canadian mines closing (which was due to lack of demand despite them being almost as cheap, they were just marginally undercut), 200 might come up a in a lot of analyses that allow slightly different margins because it's also a convenient scary "it's not just yet so we won't get caught with our pants down saying too small a number, but it feels far too soon". I've noticed it a lot in analyses of fossil fuels also - it's very common to quote the 50-200 year range depending on how scary you want it to be and it's easy to manipulate the numbers to say it by allowing different assumptions of price increase or new site discoveries
which also means that by any self-consistent definition, nuclear is renewable, as it can supply energy for as long as renewables can (they're dependent on the sun after all)
doing that results in just about all of the uranium on earth being accessible, long-term, and if combined with breeder reactors, that actually means the entire world's energy demands could be met twice over for 5 billion years
but regarding actual fuel reserves: we have about 200 years' worth, if we went all in, at exactly current prices (which where you got figures from will have quoted as "economically viable" to make the situation sound worse). However, uranium cost is almost none of the operating cost of nuclear power - literally fractions of a percent of a percent. We can inflate the acceptable cost wildly without actually having a noticeable effect on the resultant cost - and at just 3x current market prices, it becomes viable to extract uranium from seawater
the long commissioning time and decommissioning is true, but modern designs can run for longer and longer making it less and less of an issue. And part of the reason for inflating cost is no-one wanting to commit to actually doing the decommission so it gets more expensive
fuel quote there is not true in the least mainly because "economically viable" is badly defined
Wind farms also produce much more waste but I believe it's not as toxic, though rare earth metal mining is very polluting
few environmentalists have actually looked at the numbers, though, because solar panels produce literal hundreds of times more toxic waste that at current is uncontrolled, and long-term, is *more* toxic than radioactives. Because at least radioactivity dies down. Waste from silicates is always toxic until someone outright spends the money to turn them into something that isn't - and if we had a useful thing to do with that, it wouldn't be waste in the first place
(but if you want an even more fun material look up carbyne. Absolutely idiotic strength)
it assumes a continuous unbroken strand that's nanometres wide. And when that inevitably gets cut by an impact, good luck identifying and repairing it
theoretical strengths of carbon nanostructures are *extremely* theoretical and no-one in the business of making them seriously believes they'll ever come close to them
and doesn't save nearly as much as more permanent installations
spacehook is not space elevator and while it requires less strength is arguably much more dubious technically due to the consistent precision required under extreme stresses

while many other good points have been made as to why this wouldn't happen since these quotes, this wouldn't be a consequence either, because the soviets didn't have nuclear technology. (at the time of VE day, neither side did, but the soviets were still a few years off by pacific victory too)
arguably it may have also shortened the war in the pacific, as Japan had been seeking to negotiate surrender for some months prior but for some reason the foreign minister thought that the russians would be a helpful mediator for that; clearly not being allied to the russians would likely have changed that decision and possibly gotten negotiations open earlier.
I mean if anyone tries to claim that just point out the TERF stickers that were going up in manchester in bathrooms or on bins (just generally where they'd be seen) with razor blades stuck behind them to wreck the fingers of anyone trying to peel them off
but in that case he's still dumb and ineffectual to the point of being unable to be pro-anything
he *could*
... I mean, with both, he *could* potentially be well-intentioned and not reading nearly enough to understand either situation's fundamental issues
yeah that's tough when I can't get any kind of routine for anything, in my case. Cycling to work helped a lot there
might take a lot longer to get home
I did it every day to get to work (like 10 km total + hills), but I'd been doing that continually and probably built up hidden fitness that I have no idea if I still have
I'm fat and I managed it, but restarting after 4+ months might be interesting
I mean if there's no real concerns like that then obv Japan, but if I have to seriously consider managing to make it happen and make a living at the other end, as above
With choice of basically anywhere commonwealth, canada would be easiest, australia and NZ would be most out of the way of northern hemisphere chaos (canada's a little too in-between US and russia)
probably jumped from one to another while changing them. Need to cook all of them at once
time to burn 2020 to the ground
There's other equally useful ways to describe it, though, such as dispatcher/worker, primary/secondary or lead/follow
you mean you prefer not getting the rona?
I reeeally don't think that's true, people who *could* be swayed don't care about internal documentation changes
I don't think it does turn people away from the cause, if they're put off by the fact twitter is improving internal documentation, they weren't really part of anything to begin with
if you don't need that threatening power, even if you have it, you avoid using it
yeah, there's a few illegal but hardly any. And you don't get it out unless you really mean it, because it triggers a lot more investigation and is a lot more likely to get caught compared to the US
there's no legal handguns in the UK which makes it a lot harder to just casually have any gun around
the people using it for study aids either have ADHD or are dumb and addicted
ADHD meds are literally amphetamines and they work because with ADHD that doesn't affect you the same way
(which is why US's concealed carry makes no sense, even if the police suspect something, they can't actually stop you because there's a high chance it's allowed. If it was open carry only at least the police could note who has weapons, and hidden ones can be challenged)
mass produced ones are banned to prevent there being a flood of them on the market that can be used cheaply in attacks, and carrying is banned so that the police can question you if they think you have one
as a note even swords aren't completely banned in the UK, so long as it's at home / at a practice location / being transported securely between the two, and as long as it's a genuine sword (either actual antique or modern made by traditional methods)
I'll be honest I'd be suspicious at three. But I'm not involved in this I don't know anything about fighting games or the community
if it always was pressured to become more dangerous, the third wave wouldn't be the last of note, and wouldn't be less dangerous
reproducing faster is more favourable, but *not* with more extreme symptoms. Hence why today's flu is a mild concern, despite many being descended from the spanish flu. The second wave killed more, but that was mostly due to how much further it spread (again, because of lots of starting points - the first wave got it distributed among humanity, then the resurgence didn't have a single starting point that was more easily avoided). The third was then much *less* deadly than the second despite the fact it would be even more spread
What are you basing that on? It certainly wasn't true with things like the spanish flu; the 2nd wave was strong because it already had a lot of points to start from, but it very quickly mutated to be milder. All diseases are generally favoured by not attacking too aggressively as it lets them spread uncontested if no-one cares too much to treat them
one at least has *more* interest since they've managed to bias it massively to themselves - democrats might at least consider another to break that strangehold
(assuming young people there aren't going for crazy parties, like the rest of europe isn't)
ah ok. Hopefully means a lot of young people making up those numbers anyway
I'm not sure what it means other than that and don't know the voting age there
as in turnout of 17 year olds?
good luck!

https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/sars-cov-2-reactive-t-cells-found-in-patients-with-severe-covid-19-67695 5-10% of people may even have pre-existing immunity for yet-unknown reasons, possibility a similar-enough common cold
at least and is still going
(all that said I don't disagree with "america 1200% failed this and maybe it'll be a kickstart for actually changing some shit")
^
Previous developments with SARS were also already showing promise at the time, so there's no reason to be saying "this won't work" when it was working before
and maybe passively but the whole point of previous work against 2003-SARS was designing a novel form of vaccine to counter a novel dangerous virus, specifically aiming for broad coverage of immunity to counter an RNA virus. Current vaccine development is continuing from that. Maybe herd immunity will be impossible with the rates of infection europe and asia see (america might be able to), but a broad-effectiveness vaccine certainly would be able to.
studies analysing the reports of reinfection consistently find dubious testing is involved; fast discharge after questionably reliable commercial kits and so on; while some may be legit, there is no persistent pattern of legitimate reinfection shown
> And it's an RNA virus. Signs are that we *cannot* develop herd immunity against it. We may not even be able to develop a *vaccine* against it because there's currently a lot of evidence of reinfections, weak antibody responses in people who had asymptomatic to mild cases, and the disease being worse the second time around. Meaning that unchecked, it won't burn itself out through herd immunity, it will quite possibly just keep cycling through the population indefinitely getting worse every time.
<@!160142617940590594> We can develop immunity to it. That's how you recover in the first place, you wouldn't recover if you didn't. The only thing in question is the duration of immunity, which is around 6 mo-1 yr for the common cold, and 2-4 years for 2003 SARS. There have also already been studies in monkeys that attempted intentional re-infection and were unable to cause it; if a monkey's immune system can do it, so can ours
there are good places that won't, but it's very hard to tell if that's the case from the outside
tax breaks unfortunately are often not enough if the guy above you happens to be bigoted, no matter how much it is or how well you do. Be careful about it as plenty of places will use it as an excuse not to hire, or because of it be on the lookout for any minor other excuse they could use to fire

the memes are about england but there's been some weird ignorance scotland's handled it pretty badly
if by "a while" you mean "since friday"
ukraine, crimea is would fit his normal pattern
I think that meme failed yoda's grammar
did the governor just misread what was put in front of them and think that face masks were banned, and thinks they're suing to enforce them?
things change and things improve, and all the panic about "herd immunity won't work" is itself all rumour and speculation
these are not results you expect of getting the flu, even though then they were
That's not the "absolute best-case" when the same would've been said of spanish flu.
and considering erosion that takes some doing
some things definitely need a hard shift
I mean *looks at CO2 concentration and temperature*
but compared to any other country less than 150 years out of the feudal era?
obviously not perfect, still plenty of selfishness, particularly with regards to foreigners
I have wondered if that's one of the things that causes Japan to be so culturally different. When you're aware that at any moment an earthquake or a landslide or a tsunami or typhoon could just "lol nope" whatever you had, there's a lot less reason to be so selfish and hoarding
it's a strong strategy for short-term individual success, not necessarily the winning strategy overall. Ex. see how badly it fails once places with strong cultures of "everyone for themselves" (us, brazil, russia) have to face with a very cooperative task (not losing to corona)
modern times make it much easier to know how much you're being screwed over, and to organise resistance to it, meaning the point of break even is likely to shift once people start getting pissed enough in the modern era
and eventually that boils over
Even still, it gradually pisses people off that you screw over
greed is inherently an optimal strategy for short-term wins - until it pisses off enough people to cause a permanent loss
for immersion as an experience, what can be done with those three senses is already pretty damn great, though. Having been playing with my own new headset for the past week. But yeah, it's a long way off not being able to tell
if you can do smell, taste is probably viable via a similar method ... except for the fact you'd expect to actually eat the thing and that's an issue for electronics that you presumably want to use more than once
poland just has the worst luck, doesn't it
... this sounds like a symphogear background plot
in some respects it's very american centred, in others even if your country *is* comfortably left the worst extinction event in history is still in progress
and also granted that there may be other bits not quoted that say more, three lines isn't much to go on
I mean ... tbh, to me, that sounds like "I want to push you away because I feel guilty being like this and having you care" rather than "I actually want to break up". granted that's hard to work through
in college you're a ways off owning a house. and the original goal of minimum wage was it should support an entire family, not just one person - which would give lots of excess at college age - although even then all bills were compromises and it didn't quite meet that
prior to student loans being like that they knew that you could declare bankruptcy, and that a lot of people couldn't get them at all, so they charged what people could afford
college used to be cheaper because there weren't govt-backed loans that couldn't be invalidated; they can charge as much as they want because they KNOW that debt will stand one way or another
also that's highly dependent on the disease, though cold weather is commonly the one that's helpful
not if the first wave lasts through autumn

<@!170641480791228417> "Some estimates have suggested that around one in three South Korean women between 19 and 29 have had plastic surgery. Others have put that number at 50% or higher."
unironically and not exaggerating
basically every single south korean getting major plastic surgery so they pretty much all look the same
_saw that_
main reason I'd consider visiting korea is probably VFS tbh I don't know anything else specific I'd want to do or see there
100% did not have to die yet he had to know it was coming
if they were vaguely competent it would've been: let him lie on the ground like he's asking to, one of them opens the windows and goes back to check on the car / the others they were talking to, the other stays with him, and either helps him in once he calms down or calls for medics with naloxone if he's not getting better

nukes can be more efficient because they're airburst which allows a more efficient shockwave to build up. One thing that resulted in the missing count being as (relatively) low as it is for now is that it was in a warehouse at ground level

especially with the sheer number of cases where this "trap" is fairly obviously trans but it's japan can't talk about that so it doesn't get explicitly spelled out so the community uses it as an excuse to deny
especially given the fairly high number of trans members of this server who it's a term to directly attack
don't need androgynous. you can attack prelati and cag with it, besides the fact we don't need to only discuss things exclusively related to gear on this server
when no-one initially intended an attack and this is all just a snowball from talking slightly past each other
I think with others it's that while venting happens, they accept if people try to offer support and make it more than just venting. While I can understand feeling lonely enough to say the things you do, you can end up responding in ways that make people feel attacked for trying to help, even if it's not your intention - which then leads to this situation where people would suggest not venting, which then feels like an attack to you
that will be true for some but that's not the people making "let's ban X because it offends Y" memes
whereas south park he would JUST be the race punching bag
he does, just saying it's not like they only use him for that

there's humour in apu's depiction but he is at least (mostly?) depicted accurately as a hindu and he's basically never the bad guy, at worst a victim?

which is corroborated in a lot of places. Even murders apparently often get dismissed if there's no solid lead
that plus conviction rate per case being high indicates they only make cases when it's certain
police maybe have *some* more control but I've seen conflicting reports on that and factually the conviction rate per pop is *extremely* low
can also put them in a private server then copy and spoiler the link
and in japan yeah, high conviction rate is not because automatically guilty, it's because they only pursue very certain cases
regarding public opinion, that's kinda both how it works everywhere and how it doesn't work anywhere. public opinion doesn't need a conviction, but is also surprisingly easily forgotten if they're not a big public figure

the one who set up the pandemic response unit would be as bad in a pandemic as the one who dismantled it?
and the point isn't to have a "good" republican to rebel against, anyway. The point is that you will fail if you just move immediately to voting for third party in one movement; both the third party and the democrats will lose, there's more years of republicans, everyone inspired to make that vote loses faith and you struggle to get the votes again next time, and it's just a complete loss.

The point is take it in stages, vote democrats first to get to a safe position. kick repubs out to let it start to recover, *then* mount a viable challenge to *democrats* - don't be trying to challenge the only viable contender to incumbent republicans
hell this previous four years of rolling back environmental protections could already be the tipping point for runaway greenhouse effect. You really want another four?
trump is *infinitely* worse
No, they both have this point, and then trump has concentration camps, the pandemic, rolling back anything that even smells of human rights
And trump isn't?
the only thing trump is trying is to make money, and he's too stupid to even be effective at that
Bush was not *good*, but he *tried* and he's *infinitely* better than trump
Bush was in way over his head and got massively mislead by the MIC, but he legitimately cared in his own way and did try. Hell, he's the one who set up the pandemic response team that Trump broke down
yes?
this is not the time to make an argument like that
This is literally the worst there's ever been
now is not the time to be voting third party and splitting the base
and likely not re-voting
the vote needs to be demonstrated first, and voting anyone other than democrat this time means more trump
*there's no vote to pulll*
what's next is you have a large new population who are known to vote and everyone starts asking what it takes to get those votes, or keep them
mandatory voting is bad because it doesn't actually create more political engagement, and it's that that's the issue. you need more willing voting from people who actually pay attention
who said mandatory voting?
at the moment the problem is not voting for democrats, it's the number of people not voting at all
your vote needs to be there at all for pulling it to mean anything
greens can get zero votes, but if 20% of democrat voters say "I'm only voting here because I have to, I would really rather vote for green", that will cause a shift in democrat candidates to avoid *losing* that 20%
No, that's not the point
however, simply voting at all means you will be listened to next time when you say who you would vote for. If your history is never voting, then statements that you would vote for x are unlikely to be believed, and so x will never be run
right now it is absolutely not worth the cost and risk
which paints a very different picture to just saying "mostly conservative"
currently they hold 12
regardless, and extremely left party that I believe has never not held seats since first gaining them in 1949
they had major differences with the soviet union but it's debatable where the line between real communist and socialist is anyway
interesting related note, Japan is the country with the longest-running communist party to have not obtained power, but to have continually held seats in parliament
Japan's definition of conservative is much more connected to the original meaning of "don't change much" rather than western definitions of regressive; progress is slow but without so many severe pushbacks from right-wing parties as you might be familiar with from NA or europe
there is probably a correlation but yes

with a larger government you have regulation about who can do that and under what circumstances
with local governments it's extremely likely you'll have almost total uniformity from the locals, who then find it very easy to start
so it becomes much harder for the ethnostate momentum to start
the larger a government is, the less likely it is it will have a singular disenfranchised people that can be totally dismissed to form an ethnostate - there'll be *some* subgroup of that people that can resist - and for those peoples who are still small and weak enough to be unable to defend themselves, it's more likely there'll be other minorities that can stand up for them too

nothing really airborne (bar actual dust) would be too large to be physically unable to pass ex. basic cloth masks. The reason mask doesn't block though is that there's nothing close to a perfect seal, it's still dense enough for a major flow restriction and if it were sealed there could be a buildup - but you also wouldn't be able to breathe
not quite how flows and diffusion works but conclusion is true anyway
if you can't breathe with a mask you should be on an oxygen pump 24/7
probably too impractically large
I wonder if you could cool a case more effectively with a large bladder pump <:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
the actual effectiveness of breathing is unaffected
any feeling of restriction is purely a physical one that you're putting in more effort to breathe
there's no volume in a mask for it to store your own CO2. it's pretty much totally vented each breath
perfectly willing to hide once it comes out what it's actually about and not face the backlash of protecting what cuties is against
It's an odd one for them to attack because it does not come off well for them to be effectively saying "actually talking about what the internet is doing to kids is a bad idea", but I would suspect it's probably something like what aradania suggests;

which speaking of for a moment, that's gonna be hell to fight for anyone trying. There's both the "republicans and democrats agreeing memes" that can be spread in more left-wing circles to get momentum behind discussing cuties, while the right-wing circles get to talk about the stuff ardania found.

Anyone trying to counter that has to explain that the film is dubious but *fine* for what it's trying to do, explain *what* it's trying to do, explain the fact that this is popular because of a psyop (which it's understandable to initially react "the politics is irrelevant"), and what that psyop is and the layers of how it's working ...

... all the while the people you're trying to counter can just yell "you're listening to this person supporting paedophilia?!?!?!?!?!11"
I'm not so much sure this was an intended advertising campaign as it is just bad timing with right-wing psyops
(naturally this is second hand from a french source so I can't 100% confirm that but it's more certain than an unsourceable image from a republican candidate)
one thing I specifically remember from when this first came about is people who've actually seen it saying the most sexualised part, the dance sequence, shows some interspersed shots of the dance at its most tame just to show that it's happening, but is almost entirely just reaction shots of the audience and doesn't show anything really. Very carefully choreographed to be able to imply more than it shows for impact
nothing immediately suspect about them

https://twitter.com/Hbomberguy/status/1306556530213478406 a thread
you can make a choice that isn't actively the worst there's been
but the population are idiots
hillary was a good candidate
hillary is competent but people listen to smear campaigns and there's plenty of sexism to make the smear campaign popular
he got *less* votes than previously but people avoided hillary even though she literally could not have made things worse
trump won because people refused to vote for hillary. The votes trump got were still from the racists but there wasn't a swing towards him
voting third party in the presidential race does not get you local representation though
your bubble is not enough to put a third party in power. the vast majority of left-of-centre is still going dem, your large bubble is making them weaker
like this isn't the trolley problem of doing nothing it's actively doing something that pushes it towards the worse
but they're making that vote knowing they condemn it to the worse path
BEtter than "I'll put it on a worse path"
if you vote third party nothing happens and trump wins and makes it worse. If you vote biden he might listen to you enough to do something.
going even mildly by the polling of their second choices bush would've lost florida if not for third party then
same applied with bush's voting
a tiny percentage
hillary wouldn't have started concentration camps or stopped the pandemic response unit months before the biggest pandemic in the last half century
It's the fault of those who voted for him and those who voted against but still took votes from his only viable opposition
don't forget the literal concentration camps still getting worse <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
vote regional in the votes where regional actually matters but there's no regional aspect to the presidency. third party presidential votes are no better than being burned
but the presidential vote does not work that way
which is a separate vote that sure, go third party in
it doesn't work like that
and you can't take 20% of the presidency
this is fact
SNP cannot take power
and scotland is the minority of the country
SNP does not exist in all of the UK and are not viable overall therefore
it's two-stage FPTP, america's is single-stage
calling them robust is generous and it's not a true FPTP model, as outlined above
where has this *ever* happened?
practice where?
because whichever two parties are most similar leech off each other and make the larger too strong for either to resist alone
it's mathetmatically proven that FPTP cannot sustain three parties
No, they wouldn't
third party does nothing
the voting habits exist because they're what actually work. they're what will actually do *something*
it is absolutely not viable for the presidential race
UK is FPTP but voting only for local rep rather than head of state which makes third parties mildly more viable, because you don't need to shift the *Entire* country for it, just a region
the voting system makes more than two mathematically impossible
it exists ONLY for the vote
the EC isn't a standing thing that has continuous influence through the presidency
and one state going "oh yeah people liked this guy this time" doesn't have any lasting effect
they don't have influence over who's the president though the electoral college decides that separately
a third party can only happen in the US presidential race in the event of a total collapse of an existing party, in which case they're not third party, they're the other party

another would mean it's even harder to find enough of them being nice for once
while repubs hold the party line better than democrats they're still not 100% unified so there is still the ability to occasionally block them at that level when they're being 100% evil
also with that kind of power they can pretty much overrule anything in the constitution any way they want so while trump's undoubtedly not got long left welcome to his even-more-fascist replacement having president for life
40 if they go for the typical older repub. if they can find someone younger who'll hold it longer ...

instead of just giving him a mute give him a volume slider so he can fade trump out
either you're in his base and got incensed by that or you have at least some brains left and were shocked that he couldn't even manage this
I doubt anyone who wasn't sold on trump before would be any more sold on him now, though
it apparently has persuaded a few republicans who were just burying their heads so far to see him only yelling
I wouldn't be too hopeful for the FBI when they helped him get there in the first place, but anyone who did go after him once presidential protections are gone should have a field day
"unlikely" was just a simple way to say that that I didn't really think about before
but there's also too many psyops to take seriously, so unless there's some notable verification behind it (the accused acknowledging it just being one of the simpler ways), it's ... unfortunately not the best idea to take them seriously, when it's just a random online
it's very possible real accusations may be made without a court case just because of the risk it poses and lack of evidence
well ... it's iffy advice, at least for the first part, unfortunately
if there's an actual court case someone's putting their identity on the line very good chance it's true
unless there's an actual court case or the person accused acknowledges it it's unlikely

so many people have fillings if this was an issue it would have come up by now
yeah, it's perfectly safe. They tell you to not bring metal near one because most of the time you won't know what metal it is & whether it's safe, but fillings are 100% made from metals that are not affected
so long as they're not many decades old they're not magnetic and perfectly safe

the masks are "disposable" because medical staff who need maximum paranoia to not bring it in contact with everyone need to be able to just throw it away and not worry about waste of resources.

main thing I could see that doing is helping their issue of local poverty being driven by the tourism. so many rich tourists that basic necessities end up super expensive (because they can) and can barely be afforded by the locals who aren't directly getting crazy tips from it or such.

~~reached herd immunity level~~
but trump's didn't get mentioned until *after* the election
though with that there was plenty of intentional manipulation as well as just whether people were listening. like FBI mentioning that an investigation existed only for hillary, which turned up basically nothing, while there was also one on trump that turned up *plenty*
but rather than outright refusal to vote for her the most prominent way sexism would factor in is in making people very receptive to all the literal fake propaganda news that went around. people were very ready to listen to how bad the potential first female president was
definitely way less
hence earlier statements: *the other elections matter too, start locally*
they were effective in office when not lame duck
trump did not win because he "offered a break". He got *less* votes than republicans typically do, he *only* kept a core base. it's purely people refusing to vote hillary, who is far from "the most corrupt democrat in history", that let him win
I see multiple people specifically saying this person is 16 after figuring out who it is, so they're just a ridiculously self-righteous child who hasn't realised that in 2 years their favourite character will be "off-limits"

it's not comparable because the question would be that it's child porn, which is the illegal thing, rather than depicting an illegal act in general
like yeah I'll accept it's technically illegal if it happened but this person's just ... kinda going off on one
assuming it was even that; there's mention "proof lies in who these people associate with [and some other options]" so they could just be friends with someone who did
thing is we don't know what set this person off for all we know it was just RTing kirika's XV transformation

fourth option (that pr can't really affect): voting overhaul that makes it actually proportionally representative and also gives vote to those outside states since they no longer need to go via an elector

... not to try incite, but how exactly are people supposed to block them without knowing their handle?

then based on the results of that test talk to the doctor about what might be going on
your body not being healthy the way you want isn't a privilege
and while we have a few theories here as to the root cause, you don't need to jump that far in straight away; just see a doctor (endocrinologist specifically, if you can make that much of a choice with your providers), say "considering my voice and the lack of development in my body since puberty, I'm concerned about possibly having low testosterone levels, and I'd like to get that tested"
(technically you could also take some and see whether it affects you positively but that would be illegal to obtain without already being prescribed)
get it tested is the main way to tell that
there's a good chance if your voice is very effeminate and you have *no* other body hair going on, there's something worth getting medically checked
Intersex is a very large sliding scale
and there's similar vice-versa cases but not as well documented since we don't have that remarkable milestone to hit
there's at least two cases of women with totally normal XY chromosomes giving unassisted birth
there's a large variety of conditions where, even if mentally and by basic physical assessment you're male, there's some aspect that didn't quite develop fully male and is what's causing you to not appear nearly as masculine. I wouldn't want to guess precisely which kind but there's *many* variations on it
(it's as valid even if not, but that would be a straight-up no-arguments justification)
it is not impossible you might be intersex given you have such an extreme case, in which case it's 100% as valid to use the same resources
> if it doesn't go through, the app will still function but no longer update

which means "bad T production/reception" looks more likely, as that can be a lot easier to trip
it's unusual (But not impossible) for genetics to diverge that far
2016 was not revolutionary, simply the continuing decline of the republican party. What has happened far more often is periods of stagnation, followed by rapid but ultimately small change, which is the form real gradualism takes; see: new deal making rapid improvements then falling short of its goal, stagnation under lame duck obama followed by rapid decline with trum[
you claim that's revolutionary change in the same breath that claims it was the obvious conclusion of the system as-is?
and even then it's debatable if the first was really changing that much
pretty much all change has been gradual. It has accelerated and slowed down, but in all US history there have been precisely two points of truly revolutionary change, and they were both more than two centuries ago
Can you quote just one line you consider an attack?
How?
who else is venting here?
you target ardania here, but you came into this conversation before he did
For someone not saying to not vote Dems, you talk a lot (And actively direct the conversation a lot towards) not voting for dems
but it's objective fact that voting for anyone other than dems makes his win more likely
That's not what I can find about the 2009 ARRA, which is the very first he was able to take any kind of action on it. Of 831 bn, 69% went to healthcare, infrastructure, education and social programs, which is very much not bailing out billionaires (possible exception of healthcare, but that's an *entirely* separate issue to divorce for-profit from healthcare, and it's still being done by relieving the monetary pressures from the lower classes), the remainder went into tax relief. 45% of that went to relieving income taxes for 95% of working households. Income tax in general makes up for 47% of US tax revenue - those missed in that last 5% were mostly the upper earners, and therefore represent more than 2% of that total tax revenue.

Far as I can see it was definitely biased towards working families. Was it as much as ultra-left parties would do? No, but that doesn't mean it's not supporting those who lost their jobs more than it is billionaires
in what way are they condemning that group? The worst democrats are doing is failing to appeal to this group because they aim to show themselves as reasonable people, but such a large proportion of this group has been pushed down since childhood such that they're no longer capable of udnerstanding what's being offered and so the only thing they can see is (bad) showmanship from trump - "I love the poorly educated". Democrats try to help, but there is only so much you can do to appeal to a group that isn't capable of understanding you, while also not stooping to trump's level
what point, exactly, is being made there? That's not an argument to allow more trump and therefore things to get even worse, and not an argument that biden is not an improvement
they're tories it's definitely unwilling
Or maybe she wants you to not be saying "fuck you" to other users in the serious channel. Which is something that in the past month - as far as I've checked - only you have done, and five times

oh, okay, it's the *Same guy* from years ago doing it again
that was a few years ago?
when it'd be exclusive to very rich customers and need political approval first
but with an outright ban on overland flight there's just not the interest to develop anything
if the US hadn't decided to kill concorde out of jealously, then maybe supersonic would be able to develop enough
it's fairly likely, subsonic is significantly more efficient
physics mean this is a good area to be just below the speed of sound with an aircraft that takes off and lands at reasonable speeds while being a reasonable size for its mass
if it's still subsonic, 30-40,000 ft
while you're close enough to the earth to be even slightly considering how regular air traffic has to think, up is still very meaningful and altitude is quite important to distinguish from distance
(60,000 ft / 20 km is the upper limit of controlled airspace; if you can fly above that, no directions are needed from ATC)
if we get to the point eventually that there are craft transitioning between lifting flight and interacting with regular air traffic, and also going to space where metric lives, then there might be questions to be asked. Although it is not unreasonable that the solution might be "switch over above controlled airspace", as that's a fairly easy marker and the way you fly the vehicle will change around there, so there won't be many cross-applicable skills that need to be trained with both units
altitude and distance are considered separately
hell, they don't even convert between other imperial units
but the point is pilots don't do conversion between imperial units and metric for flying the aircraft. it's all imperial
it was also an orbiter, not a lander - or at least intended to be one
and then subsequently slammed into the planet
the one in question here is quite infamous but it was not distances. It was that one engine manufacturer in the US used US customary force units, which was accounted for in the processor's normal code - but they missed it in the low-power hibernation code, which meant when the probe half-awoke to do course corrections it made much bigger corrections than it should have
Even if aeronautics did change to km/h and metres, the training would be identical as it's just training to fly the aircraft to certain marks, just different marks at that point
No, that was a different imperial conversion
it doesn't really cost training though because you don't base any skills using ft and knots on any other skills that pilots might know from elsewhere. and even if you did, pilot training is serious enough that you wouldn't take it for granted, it would be assessed at similar cost to the training anyway
it's just the standard and not costing anything so why change
but simultaneously there's nothing making imperial better
that isn't really true because pilots worldwide all universally use feet and knots - the arguments that it costs by maintaining two systems or making certain manufacturers unavailable, as suggested by the study linked, don't really apply to this industry (though it is the only exception)
in the design phase feet only come up because they've been defined in feet. the physics is considered in SI
you can do that in any units
completed most of an aerospace engineering degree here, all the design work was in SI. feet only came in as a parallel unit for altitude when having to consider what existing traffic would do and how a new aircraft would slot in - what airlanes it could use and such
feet are only historical
knots are justified as they are not a cultural thing but are based on dividing the dimensions of the world up
it can be done but it needs to be measuring in a unit people use, which is a major logistical challenge to changeover
it does use time as a measure but it then has to translate that time to a position, which needs to be measured somehow
GPS device does not ping, it purely listens
though likely it would have both if it had an elevator
moon might use space elevator because the forces are so much less (IIRC kevlar is strong enough) and it has so fewer satellites, and less drift in their orbits due to lack of atmosphere
since digital they could be given a conversion and keep working the same internally, but true
and also redoing all charts (although aeronautic charts are redone yearly anyway, maritime large-scale charts would be the bigger issue)
non-circular rings are a very bad idea (see: ringworld engineers)
(we can still build rings around the earth without connecting it with towers, and then we get the option to build them at any speed we like so can have multiple at different altitudes)
while a launch loop has to pay maybe 5% of that max for anything low to geostationary
the cost is getting to the right velocity and from geostationary they still have to pay like 20% as much of that to slow down and then insert at a low altitude
launch loop requires significantly less for low altitudes (the more useful ones)
only if they want to be geostationary
and this is nevermind satellites that either by design or due to EOL are physically incapable of adjusting their orbit, and so collide with and damage the tower
> Yes, and that means any orbit on the same height as ring *will* end up colliding with it
<@!203444794737950720> this isn't the main issue; main issue is any altitude the towers cross presents a major navigation hazard that almost all satellites must take active action to avoid, significantly costing them mission fuel and disrupting their intended missions
the only way to not collide with it is to be in a perfectly matched phase comfortably away from it (comfortably because it *will* flex due to atmospheric effects)
(and you could just build a ring without the tower and launch to it on a loop)
also how to not make every orbit that doesn't phase with it unusable
if only we could generate phonic gain for real <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
*monorail to space*
alternatively: *train to space*
it's a very long space cannon that humans can survive
perhaps!
their maintenance cost and cost to other satellite operators makes them very inefficient long-term when a launch loop offers the same benefit (launch using almost pure electrical power), direct insertion into more useful orbits, and can be made with real materials
~~and ruin so many orbits for so many people while being so expensive and fragile when you could just use a cheap iron loop at very high speed just below space instead~~
~~space elevators are just a bad idea when the launch loop is an option~~
big limiter on electric aircraft currently is battery density but if that was overcome it would push target altitudes marginally higher, because they want a slightly lower equivalent air speed - but it would only be 35-45k ft
no?
*are still doing nothing
I have doubts about that
the rich will exploit such a simple system too, you can't cover it with a simple rule, you just need to keep actively fighting to clarify nazis bad, criticising genocide good
until you start having blind faith in what's getting banned as being justified and stop listening to people saying other things are being stretched to fit the definition
that stance also presumes that the discussion of such wouldn't be effective at stopping it; it would be a bad idea to censor the discussion if it built up political will against an invasion
(and also the question of when there's something that can be interpreted as such by automatic bots, yes)
where you define what's a call for violence. Is suggesting a disruptive protest such as extinction rebellion a call for violence?
it's easier to spread something that requires no founding in truth and good than it is to actually back up how something will be a benefit or to take the time to listen and care about people
methadone is a *lot* safer than heroin and I think even morphine from a clinical perspective but I'm not sure it has the same high people would pursue. morphine's still pretty dangerous, but legal in careful prescription
(there's in fact a stronger link between alcohol leading to opiates than weed)
but there's a fairly strong division between "occasional fun" drugs like weed and hallucinogens and harder drugs like opiates, that has little to no slippery-slope effect
most hallucinogens are also fairly harmless, it was a similar paranoia after weed that hit those
you don't remain high for four weeks
since they're not detecting the active component like with alcohol
*the psychoactive part doesn't stay in your system, the signature they're detecting does
it's only a superbug if it's the dominant form of the infection, and once it is it then requires the next level up, progressing the antibiotics arms race and accelerating its progress to becoming immune to that too
that small fraction can then be more easily dealt with entirely by the body rather than catch a ride on outside material like hospital bedding and become a new superbug
by avoiding prescribing for cases the body can easily deal with, you ensure even the weaker antibiotics last longer because only a small fraction of the infection has resistance from genetic exchange, instead of 100% from genetic-exchange-followed-by-over-prescribing
even if some exchange happens, it will not be selected for unless it encounters the antibiotic that resistance is for
that's even better reason to not preemptively prescribe, though
else there would be no point
No, not in this infection
which may be even worse than what's already around
if it's effective against the infection, it has the potential to turn whatever you're infected with into a new superbug
UK's gun control is a lot more severe than aus', I'll point out; but with large uninhabited areas of wildlife guns for that do make more sense in australia
not that people should be allowed to drive under any intoxication, but it's MUCH safer than alcohol
that's why alcohol is worse (than weed specifically, there's fewer comparisons with hallucinogens); you still have appropriate judgement until extreme levels of weed intoxication, you lose the motor skills first. Which means you're aware of how badly you would do something and that means people don't attempt things like driving (or if they do they're absurdly cautious instead of dangerous)
same applies to alcohol. if anything more severely
but yes, pretty much all exploitation concerns in sex work also apply to other company-employed industries
tbf factory work doesn't normally endanger customer's private lives also
(maybe not so especially in the US but that's a different issue)
"brothel" has an odd association but the concept of a place you can go to pay for properly regulated sex work doesn't really have issues, and means you can properly address issues like exploitation
considering there's US states and european countries with both
which is something else opioids do also that make me iffy about being as free with them as alcohol or weed; even if there's ones that are strictly "safe", how much would it hurt people to get addicted and be unable to function
nicotine has low risk of direct lethality but absolutely destroys the body and person's ability to function
for the most part. I think we just have local police, transport police, and the oversight police (I forget what they're called here- IA comes to mind?)
UK has sub-branches of local police departments, like big cities with significant violent crime issues might have armed response units and london has its own counterterrorist unit that's part of the local police
I think that's situational depending on what they complain about. if they're complaining about something the opposition was specifically campaigning on fixing and they didn't vote, they don't have much right to talk
but with modern security measures, probably still overkill
I suppose at airports people are scared of there being a bomb and a bomb is still a threat if caught on the ground so they want range
that doesn't seem like how it should work, I'm not sure I've ever seen military police
I recall there were armed police in the train station after the 2017 bombings here but that's probably more for show than there being any real risk someone would try the same thing
regular police shouldn't have any need for more than a baton
if there's an active threat known I can somewhat understand it to be able to respond quickly, but only while such a threat is active and known and only for specially trained police addressing that
> In Hong Kong, guns are hard to come by and not the main choice of weapon in organised crime.
when guns are hard to come by, it's undesirable to bring attention to yourselves by using them. Even if you have them you'll hold them in reserve until you really want to be sure you're ex. taking out the rival group for good
even though they're the entire problem and for hunting or sport or house defense or ranges rifles are perfectly adequate
the big thing with US gun control though is the fact all other countries with control emphasise banning handguns, because their concealability is what makes them by far the most dangerous. but in the US there's an expectation by these gun owners of always being able to have it on them, so it sounds insane to ban them
perhaps aus got closer more recently; I recall when the major ban happened it was still fairly lenient, just got really all the important ones
when australian says on fire they means on fire
<:heiki:708876603240742952>
probably the scariest animal we have here are badgers and they're scaredy cats too
> Feels good to live in a country where the biggest threat you face is, well, the country
if not for the idiots and the politics UK would be the safest place on earth basically. wildlife "meh", weather "meh", geology "meh", literally nothing in the form of naturally occurring threats
ah, okay. ... not sure if that might be too much conflict of interest in some cases - surely you'd want the IA equivalent to also look over the NCA
were they replaced by anything?
but things like business crime either are handled by regular police if relevant or handled by something other than "police"
ah that'll be another. Probably mostly handles coordination between local forces though I imagine
1 per person means those votes would count again and you'd see a surge in red votes from cities too
and there's going to be a LOT of red votes that just don't bother in cities because of it being supposedly inevitable
because as much as cities vote blue, many cities are not overwhelmingly blue, even if it is consistent
reps automatically losing in 1 vote per person is a significant assumption that (while it has some evidence) is definitely not to be taken for granted
_hides_
2021 will just come with a mandatory kinect and very meh launch titles
no 2022
apparently north dakota elected someone for a local position who'd already been dead for a month?
that sounds very unlikely to go through
No, it's not, because ohio still has far more EC votes than california does per person and even if both distribute by popular result, it's not equal to popular vote
forcing EC to vote for popular result doesn't change anything about that and isn't a true popular vote
you still have the last percentages in each area getting filtered out
you still have rural votes that sometimes count for up to 60 times that of city votes
they can, but that's only a minor part of the problem with the electoral college
> There's that plan of overturning electoral college by making states automatically vote for winner of popular vote
this doesn't overturn electoral college though as it's still winner-takes-all for each area and there's still the unfair weighting of electorates

seeing as we already had someone voted to legislature who was a month dead
... dark thought: ||how many voted and died of covid before the vote was taken||
calling is a presumption
we don't know if they're correct
it's weird for fox to be so pessimistic about changes in favour of them
no bunch of remaining votes is gonna be that biased
flipping it now would suggest that someone legitimately took a bunch of D votes and hid them and then someone found them and counted them
ideally it's all three biden and then with that margin there's too much resistance even from in the party for him to fight it
but if only one goes biden it's close enough that trump really tries hard to push a challenge to the result
https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1324200240694648834
that's not called mandatory voting
bet they'll just start focussing on arizona without ever actually un-calling it and hope their base is too dense to notice
(weren't making that much of a difference how things would improve locally based on who got elected to the local seat, that is)
I have some mild idea but concluded that they weren't making that much of a difference locally, plus there was the need to counter tory votes, so it didn't matter that much anyway. If the tories weren't such a problem and green or another third was viable locally I'd look at it more
what is it with recent elections and the right being predicted to do massively worse than they actually have
there's always a tweet
https://i.imgur.com/MMZEJti.jpg
~~it was also so that in calculations of elector count that involve population numbers they could count slaves as 3/5ths without having to actually assign then 3/5ths of a vote~~
so the mafia
so we can legally say poland is controlled by the mafia?
calling it hard to believe when hillary got millions more votes too
promising being like 90% effective, so it'll still need HUGE deployment to get coverage, but
don't multiple have promising results?
"impending" meanwhile trump has what, 17 ongoing?
he told them to put in any mail in ballots that may have been forgotten and hope they get counted by accident
trump actively requested his voters commit fraud on twitter
<@!266379640069685252> that was actually a pretty useful video to summarise it
tweets have nothing to do with legal suits
eyewitnesses who cannot say anything went wrong
everything that could be done already was, because as mentioned, trump's campaign had people watching in every single ballot room that mattered
if you don't have a real goal for repatriation, there cannot be any suit pursued
they're not being censored. They're making claims with zero evidence. They're saying "do something", the court is asking "Do what?" and they're responding "something!"
the remaining 10% are courts that have some legal requirement to hear some minimum amount before dismissing it
if there was any real case they wouldn't be being 90% dismissed out of hand
like, earliest *maybe* infection was late nov. They announced at end of dec. It was what, fucking march before trump did anything?
china announced the dangers pretty early on
I've seen no evidence contrary to what shemmy says
china definitely wants world domination, but corona appearing and being so badly handled is a happy accident for them. They're far more prudent than to unleash such a chaotic thing when they have the entire world economy in their hands
trump handed the position of #1 world superpowre to china
china is something to be worried about but trump made that so much worse
or far more likely: he knows that there's legal consequences for lying on the stand so decided to tell the truth and is now lying to his echo chamber where they'll believe anyone one of "theirs" says and there's no investigation or expectation of evidence
https://twitter.com/ElginCharles/status/1326306518464126976
I'm not gonna read back and check if it's been mentioned, but I just wanna point out the "whistleblower" on the election counting admitted he was paid $130k by the republican party to lie about it
right leaning conservatives touting socialist talking points like "we're for the people". where did this happen before- uh oh
what's vice PM's stance?
ROC pretty much has to go way more explicit
HK have much more trouble doing any such thing given legally their govt is technically china's
biden might actually be willing to resist that kind of move
if they do, they were already planning it, and trump would've made it easier
such as?
nah you're definitely doing exactly what shemmy says. I'm just the kind of idiot who's willing to keep beating you over the head
and they came to power while their major competition was the *communist party*
> The left kinda let them though. Started picking people with absolutely no relationship to unions who were supported by corporate money and had no reason to support them. You ended up with Rep presidents going out and slamming them and Dem presidents just saying nothing.
they did not "let them", because I was not referencing a recent thing being repeated. I was referencing the same kind of mixed messaging that "national socialist" was which was used to appeal to a large base incapable of critical thinking about their actions
almost all irl names suck lol
because they were all companies responsible for trade with east-of-india
(see: the irony that the american flag is BEIC's flag but with some stars instead of the union)
but propaganda wasn't nearly so advanced long ago
they always were
appeal to reason does not work if the person is beyond reason
> why does every single mainstream political party ignore the working class? They're literally the most numerous population.
<@!266379640069685252> the problem with this argument is that the republicans do not ignore the working class; and unfortunately have had such effective propaganda, that even though the democrats objectively do help the working class considerably while the republicans do not, the working class is largely unable to process that difference and keep voting repub. As such the democrats don't attempt to persuade the R working class because they're too deep in and nothing they can really say can be effective
I don't know if that happened recently enough to be done by "corporations" (in any real scale), but that was certainly something merchants in more of the medieval and earlier eras would do, and one of the reasons for govt enforcing the national currency
it is likely possible in future, but not from history
you'd need to change almost everything about humanity to get a historical world without colonialism
someone else would've
just handguns are the important part
we just said we don't have total bans though
also yeah australia's got fucken crazy wildlife and doesn't need handguns for it
does not follow
and vs wild animals, so that would legitimise it for people who actually live in that kind of area, while they're in the wild. not while you're in a city going to burger king
and therefore you need to take that 21ft-time in order to get it out for it to have *any* point
I also don't see what relevance an attacker with a knife vs victim with a gun scenario has when the whole point is US gun ownership is so high that the attacker will always have a gun, that's already out and ready to use vs yours that's still holstered
a mugger goes around with the intent to mug and therefore already has a weapon, has it out, and is more prepared to use it than you are. Handguns being legal means the weapon they have is a handgun and they're likely to shoot you with it regardless. with a knife they wouldn't take the time to go after you if you threw your wallet and ran
that makes them the most dangerous and least protective
handguns are outright banned for any reason, because they're trivial
it is actually possible (difficult, but possible) to own things like high-power rifles in the UK, because those are damn hard to get into a position to actually use on someone
which is why you prioritise banning handguns because their easy concealability is what makes them the most dangerous kind of all
the only division it's causing is between feminists and fakes <:ChrisHappy:696166094238515252>
"No"
(granted these only apply to a competent psych)
yumi: that calculation assumes the psych has no time away from patients that's still doing work, which is unlikely. gaps between, refreshing yourself on each patient's case, keeping yourself up to date on research and looking into techniques that might help each individual, etc
trump shouts about both things while dem's whole point is to be reasoned so you can't shout about it without losing your core base
because they don't take a fully reasoned approach to their second issue, they just want someone to shout about it
which is the point I have made in everything I have said
Which trump also covers
and if he was supremacist enough to swing their two-issue balance
only if it was the only thing they consider
how do you grab them now
trump is supremacist and pretends to be on the labour issue
romney wasn't NEAR as supremacist as trump, so arguing for labour can swing the two-issue voters
simple message of "drain the swamp" + being white suprem like them = there isn't really a way to pull them back on the labour issue because they think that's already solved
but you're arguing to change to run on ... exactly what dems run on. Just less loudly because they have to actually explain their policy rather than continually shout "drain the swamp!"
if they were single-issue on labour they'd seriously look and ask what will create votes, and that's not the non-plan repubs have
why assume that all these voters are single-issue, rather than white supremacists who were also influenced by the labour question.
Dem policy has consistently been for rebuilding and job creation. It has consistently done so (perhaps not by enough, but more than repub ever does). Trump just shouted empty words with no plan, and that got votes - how do you compete with that while actually maintaining appeal to those who can think and ask what your plan is?
or maybe I'm recalling percentages vs raw numbers
this year was exceptional in general because a lot of the votes trump didn't get in 16 came back to prevent any dem
I thought I recalled something about trump getting less votes than typical in 16
trump got less votes in 16 than romney got before, no?
and then lose it the next time when the factory is fully automated and there's no new jobs
they don't care that it would be a job for them, they want no part of it
I'd argue he possibly has a point that it shouldn't have moved the vote as little as it did, but for a very different reason:

His base has drunk the kool-aid that this disease is a liberal conspiracy/attack/plot/whatever it needs to be, according to their belief in whether or not it's real, for them to believe everything bad about it is dem's fault and therefore they're incensed to keep voting trump despite how all of those deaths are on his head
what changed was only where those votes were
he proportionately gained MORE votes than biden, by that
didn't he still lose the popular vote by roughly the same number as vs clinton
would he survive standing back up again
and they concluded a non-zero but totally unrealistic chance
I mean that was based on the LHC themselves considering it
shemmy: that just seems like ... such a normal thing for a candidate who's doing well to say
and then the next repub govt shuts down all the subsidies and the factories move elsewhere and even the managerial jobs vanish
> Ive seen my grandma stab a knife thru the head of a catfish and it lived and slithered out of her hand back into the water
and thus a new race of knife-resistant catfish evolved
even a scale kind of simplifies too much since it's many factors of some things being notably easier with meat but plants being totally indispensible for humans
whereas there's other animals where that might be reversed or both might be essential
omnivorous is poorly defined as while some nutrients are *easier* through animals for humans, exclusively animals would be awful in a way that exclusively plant matter is not; humans can survive and be healthy without meat at all
powering a laser to be practical is the issue with any of them. you lose the nice dense way of storing energy in an explosive, and the efficient way of delivering it kinetically

"Article 24. Marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes and it shall be maintained through mutual cooperation with the equal rights of husband and wife as a basis.
With regard to choice of spouse, property rights, inheritance, choice of domicile, divorce and other matters pertaining to marriage and the family, laws shall be enacted from the standpoint of individual dignity and the essential equality of the sexes."

this doesn't seem like it should be that hard to rephrase so it's mostly a matter of what the requirement to actually do it is & knock on effects like how forms need to be redesigned with new phrasing
people in Japan seem to think this stream went fairly favourably, though
https://twitter.com/Ossan_san/status/1331810116996239361
if japan finally decides to make a move on something it just gets made and then that's how things are now
on the other hand with the government not changing much, when things finally *do* change, there tends to not be much resistance or push to return back, such as how conservatives in the US got pissy about same sex marriage and there's been constant pushes back against trans rights
it's not happened because of the little political will for it and little need
this is somewhat outdated, it's pretty widely accepted in japan and while there's some element of that left it's mostly believed "oh it's not that common but let them do it anyway"
juries in america are required to be unaware of nullification but that's not the case elsewhere
the law is for "okay, were you actually being faced with lethal force and did other options exist at all?"
panic is where the jury aspect comes in. the jury can nullify
the thing about castle doctrine is it's unnecessary, as all places without it *do* generally in practice find lethal force legal if it can be reasonably demonstrated there was no other way - the key point being that there can be no universal standard for "at this point murder is justified" so they do not attempt to make it, it is left to the other laws and the jury to determine whether it could have been avoided
tardis
I never said they're smart laws
~~depends how white and male the defendant is~~
IIRC some might even allow castle doctrine for if you dropped your bag and you're going back for it
some states extend it to any property basically
depends on the state
the bear encounters section on wikipedia indicates all brown bears behave as grizzlies, very cautious
what is the distinction in your mind?
"In North America, the populations of brown bears are called grizzly bears."
pray
no
black and polar
grizzlies are supposed to be, yeah
how does that factor against wild boars
I recall grizzly bears are the ones you can just shout at and scare off
are these stats about grizzly bears
personal protection wolves
train wolves as your pack animals
you do from a person
you don't need to hide a gun from an animal
and this question of using guns vs bats started from this, not animal attacks
handguns are
the gun is in your possession to form a militia on short notice
thus, effectively, you do not own the gun
it is illegal to own the ammo
the ammo is stored at the range
switzerland has a lot of gun ownership but nowhere near the US, and a key factor is they only own the gun. Ever
for wild animals you also want something bigger than a handgun which is what represents the most danger to humans
except for all the cases where it does
and in fact that's probably more likely
that's wild speculation when you could just as much be backed into a corner in a bar
this isn't recent, though. Before WW2 america had very little armed forces and was very much focussed inward. And there was plenty of racism then
and the refusal to consider that elsewhere might exceed the US in any positive metric
the exceptionalism can only flourish because of the insularity
today it would be the spear that's better
hence depending on requirement
but harder to hold straight against someone charging and hitting it aside
the easy-to-carry part, yes. Them being a secondary, no - spear, axe, morning star, mace, all generally preferable weapons (Depending on requirement) to a sword. But the sword works and is super easy to carry and draw
if you needed a weapon you'd have your primary
however, if you don't have a primary, why bother with the weight of the secondary at all
swords are an easy-to-carry secondary, almost always something else is preferred
much less but they're allowed the ammo and way higher than most developed nations
probably closest comparable gun ownership too
china is the sinister one where information (and people) just disappear
eh with russia kinda everyone already knows but the state is too violent to resist so it doesn't matter

there is random variance but generally faster with a higher dose (more likely to be dangerous) and slower with a lower (though that might not show up noticeably at all)
typically about a week 14 days would be very unusual from a known exposure
however that's once it's under control
it makes more sense once it's more under control, see: similar schemes with travelling in japan
because everyone's getting the same medication so someone's paying a lot more for a lot worse service
I am pointing out the GDP per capita makes it more extreme
the graph is percent of GDP
like this graph, but then recall the US has even higher GDP per capita. It's spending as much of more money
the NHS costs less tax money per capita than medicaid and medicare do because they actually get to buy cheap preventative treatment instead of only cover expensive emergency treatment and they get to be the main negotiator on price, instead of not negotiating at all
which means likely getting paid
Which would be quite expensive, yeah. From the images I saw it's fairly precise machining and you'd need multiple people in on it
so far apart
it does cost a lot to have it in multiple locations for it to be an art piece
the issue here is that mods need to verify what's being said, hence it being brought up by a mod
although they *are* more effective at the blocking part, just way more expensive even for a single payer system
just while you don't have hormone replacement
no
concern trolling
can't be that long before we have the first baby with genetically only two moms
but even if you do it's also an odd thing to raise because at this point, there's so many options for fertility treatment that are only getting more varied ... by the time it's a question for any of these tweens they can just go some flavour of IVF
(most detransitioners also cite external pressures as a reason and at least many will later retransition when they feel it is more possible)
that's extremely rare though and it's not a generally considered significant effect. Though it is one that's hard to measure as you have no control sample to compare
"future fertility" is lol though
second set are the "mights" that aren't well-substantiated but legally you're gonna mention them to CYA
the first set are "the effects of having an injection / the effects of being menopausal"
(if it is real you'd also need long extended use rather than just using them as a temporary first and reversible step)
they can cause some issues with a child if taken during pregnancy (which is ???????????? in the first place why would you do that) but they're fairly minor as things go; the child is generally still healthy just with slightly weaker bones. There's some that allege something similar can happen with a certain kind taken during puberty, but it's not well-substantiated, minor and rare if it's real, and absolutely something that can be medically consented to as a worthwhile tradeoff
they're way simpler and way less side effects
painkillers have significant side effects because it's fundamentally messing with the body's nervous system or irritant response and the body kinda relies on that. puberty blockers are just a molecule that glomps the receptor for "start making hormones" without actually triggering its response
they've been in use for like half a century now
not really
it's impressive
but fundamentally it is not *being trans* that is the cause - it's the results of being trans (incorrect body, incorrect treatment socially, etc)
based on what is causing the distress
there are multiple kinds within that
kaiyo is talking entirely about gender dysphoria
his skinsuit is more colourful today
because it shouldn't be needed and we don't budget around it
just people don't have that set aside for healthcare costs here
which also exist in the UK
it's only "better" at all because you're looking at paying directly to services that directly cater to the market and have no competition for services
well known is the issue, if people cared it would've been possible in the 70s
although it is possible to do oestrogen monotherapy
You don't need them if you're being prescribed T (it's way more powerful) and with E helping, other alternatives that do have side effects become viable

another problem with "we'd just get outvoted" is the default assumption that representatives of the population centres don't realise where the food comes from and won't create policies that make sure the cities get food
also, that can't heal mechanical wear. It can only "heal" surface damage by waiting
because silicon is far and away the best semiconductor
and there is the *computational* issue of the complexity of achieving high intelligence - it is likely to need inordinately more raw compute power to get more intelligent, and we do not yet have evidence that it is feasible for silicon to even approach human-level, nevermind exceed it
almost all of those in your life are successfully repaired
you develop several hundred pre-cancerous cells every day
cancer is several chained malfunctions of self-management systems that are normally repairing themselves
Theoretically. All damage involved in that can theoretically be repaired - the issue with death is malfunctions not being recognised in some cases and therefore not getting repaired, or not being repaired fast enough
It can though
not in the same way that biology can (theoretically) repair *any* damage incurred
No, they can't
No, we don't
that's a wild assumption because of technology differences. Biology can do many things machines cannot - such as self-repairing
those aren't superintelligences the whole problem is they're dumb as shit but being trusted with basically unlimited power
which means even if silicon can match biology, it is unlikely to scale far beyond that easily
we don't know what the computational complexity of intelligence is, but it's likely to be a high scale
it's an assumption that a "super"intelligence is even possible
but it also won't have to
if properly managed earth could easily support billions more
we're not too many though. Specially now that population growth is slowing dramatically
there's a lot more capacity here
we're not too many if we just managed it properly
and it needs to be done for real rather than just paying some backwater country to "take" all your emissions
It needs to be more than currently is
only if anyone actually tries to focus on that with developments
we're on the way to runaway warming
venus most likely started out earthlike and suffered runaway warming
it sure as shit will if we don't do anything about it
either it's irrelevant or we're capable of solving it then
sort priorities
100 years in the future we're either dead or managed to come together to solve climate change
There's the fact it's a completely different technology that is capable of different things
No, it doesn't mean that
you can with two processing cores, but it doesn't mean it will achieve twice as much
you can't just smoosh two human brains together and go "hey look twice as intelligent"
semiconductors scale better than biology
which is the point
Not with semiconductors
neither of which has concrete evidence (and B is extremely unlikely)
all assumptions of a super intelligence assume A) that you can even match human intelligence in the first place with semiconductors, B) that once you can do that it will be easy to bypass it
That still runs into the computational complexity issue
they tried to correct it as they saw the material limits approaching but it's not so easily bypassed
it's still been dead that long
moore's law has been dead for well over a decade
the most complicated network in existence is 1/40th the number of neurons (which is magnified even further in reduction of complexity) and runs at 1/10,000th of real time
while also already being inordinately more complex than anyone has even considered with AI
except for humans it is. Humans don't just manipulate a finite set of connections - humans *create* new connections, constantly
it's bad AI but it's AI
now we do
we used to not know how to make AI
yes
human hardware is self-upgrading
and for that it's still doing worse in terms of incidents per mile than humans do across all roads in all conditions
it's being allowed in very limited circumstances on the very easiest roads to drive in the world
and through this they're still inferior to humans in even mildly complex tasks like driving
it can specialise extremely well, but generalising is providing *huge* issues. we occasionally make developments there, but they're always tiny jumps to another roadblock
AI is very rapidly hitting limits
because we already understand electrochemistry pretty damn well and there's little indication anything else can semiconduct nearly as well, and aiming to look 100 years in the future is quite ridiculous anyway
I would not be surprised if major reforms were very close now. There's little political opposition to progressive policies in japan, they're just not interested in changing things if they don't have an immediate benefit; japan being "conservative" is in opposition to being radical/in favour of lots of change

With this it's likely other municipalities and prefectures will start doing something similar pretty quickly, and it'll then likely not be long until the diet gives in and just legalises it

the whole point of mass phishing is to catch out the easy targets so there's no point putting a lot of effort into it
going so far as to have custom imagery
very rarely would a phishing attack be so well-polished and have precisely nothing that you might pick up on as odd
at least the tribune one also mentioned is more suspect
it is perfectly identical to how an actual email would look
on the other hand there is precisely nothing showing that email as a phishing scam
on the one hand yes

... my first thought is are they going to use it being in euros to justify kicking everyone out because everyone's paid in £
if this was a real phish it would get sent to everyone including people high up who would know and there would be very shortly after a company-wide email "WE DO NOT RECOGNISE THIS EMAIL IGNORE IT"
it's mass phishing against the whole company
this specifically isn't targeted phishing though

don't fall for this right-wing trolling claiming "PC gone mad!" there's gonna be a lot of it now that trump lost
it's barely even an inclusivity thing it's just straight up easier to read

literally making it more readable and removing possible skips by going "well technically I have some fucked up relation to them that means I don't count"


it's *changing* the terms in *one specific piece of legislation* in *very specific locations that are qualified in the proposal*
it's not even banning the terms
yes, that is precisely what I said?
without evidence of further wrongdoing I would have to assume the benefit of the doubt that he would know 17 is legal (assuming it is wherever he is, it is often enough) and wouldn't go further
I also don't really know who he is I just recognise the name
from a pure age perspective that would be well within romeo and juliet laws

however this is a case where age isn't relevant so much as the fact he's someone they look up to which is easily exploitable.
however only in the US is someone leaving with a knife justification for repeated lethal force
a knife was found in his car but the state of it before that is very unclear
I've not checked those sources, but there's a hell of a lot of them for such a short passage
"On August 23, 2020, Jacob S. Blake, a 29-year-old black man, was shot and seriously injured by police officer Rusten Sheskey in Kenosha, Wisconsin.[2] Sheskey shot at Blake's back seven times[3][4] when Blake opened the driver's door to his SUV and leaned in.[5] Three of Blake's sons were in the backseat at the time.[6][7][8] Earlier during the encounter, Blake had been tasered and had scuffled with officers.[9]"
this just seems like a mistake from getting too influential too young
if it comes out there are others making a pattern, or younger, or such, then sure he's an ass
assuming his statements are accurate, this was only a couple people who would be within romeo & juliet laws that he didn't actually do *much* with, regrets and apologised to them, and hasn't done it with anyone else, since, or younger
I named 7, then gave four doing worse, singapore's doing *much* worse, and haven't mentioned china or north korea
myanmar, malaysia, philipines, indonesia
most are doing way worse
there's a very select few countries doing better than japan (vietnam, thailand, cambodia, laos, brunei, taiwan and south korea by about half)
according to what?
japan, one of the worst hit in asia?
and a drastic response will reduce it but it's needed when hygiene is so poor in some parts. their neighbours don't need as drastic a response to it when they can just trust their people to be clean enough
they had a drastic response but that's necessary if there's still places where pooping in the street is normal
I mean they modernised later and a lot of people in a lot of their more rural cities that haven't interacted with other countries as much have poor hygiene
it was already being developed in response to SARS and covid largely picked up on the ideas from then
the protein interface changing is a known feature and designed into coronavirus vaccine development
all of them are objectively a lot less certain than normal vaccine development would be
Still in a much shorter period though so with less opportunity to look at long-term effects
but now that the danger is proven there's going to be funding for the idea of actually curing the common cold
I am still a little concerned that these ones might have been rushed and not as thoroughly tested as normal
it's still dooming because while this is a worldwide reservoir of a new strain, we're also now looking at serious discussion on a general-purpose vaccine for all coronaviruses, and potentially all current ENT infections ("the common cold") now that there's actually funding for the idea
I mean, that's *already* what happened, debatably, since it came from bats. Coronaviruses affecting humans already existed and an animal reservoir mutated to get back to humans
so if we scale that up we should be back to where we started by ....
https://twitter.com/JJHTweets/status/1346412827536404481
while there is some debate on exactly where, there seems to be *no* consideration of europe or west asia for a potential source and recent data is pretty certain of mexico
"In 2009, U.S. agricultural officials speculated, although emphasizing that there was no way to prove their hypothesis, that "contrary to the popular assumption that the new swine flu pandemic arose on factory farms in Mexico, [the virus] most likely emerged in pigs in Asia, but then traveled to North America in a human."[35] However, a subsequent report[36] by researchers at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in 2016 found that the 2009 H1N1 virus likely originated from pigs in a very small region of central Mexico.[37]"
they've not been exporting it since closing borders, no, but what reports do get out suggest they're not going as well controlling it in inland provinces as numbers would suggest
yeah indonesia might be pretty bad
"Review of data, however, indicated that the number of deaths may be much higher than what has been reported as those who died with acute COVID-19 symptoms but had not been confirmed or tested were not counted in the official death figure.[99]"
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Indonesia_per_capita_cases_map.svg/1280px-COVID-19_pandemic_in_Indonesia_per_capita_cases_map.svg.png
while indonesia's doing worse than japan they're on the better side of it
eh, the one doing worst by far is singapore
I was considering south east asia in general as well just to have a significant comparison set
not a wide comparison set
there's like 6 countries there
ME throwing off the scale so we can't get comparative results of the east
and there's still plenty more to go
they work as many if not more hours than a regular job (marking tests and homework needs to be done at *some* point and they sure can't do it while teaching)
people claim they get a lot of days off and short hours in the UK but it's absolutely not true so I would be very cautious about the source of that info
I'm pretty sure he has none
a coup generally uses military support
unlike a race the good cops can be driven out to distill down to the absolute worst
police can pressure others into supporting them
police having extrajudicial power means it's not really the same as a corrupt teacher organisation where it is from the  top-down
and the top is largely brought up from a corrupted bottom
the judges may refuse to convict because the police union is very strong and determines whether this judge's neighbourhood would be protected
eh the police in the US thing is a bit more complex than top down
you can't fire one for relatively minor issues when you're already understaffed by a quarter
a minimum number of teachers is required it's easier to get rid of bad ones by actually making it an attractive job where you're not overworked to shit and underpaid
at least one of them can have some grace, even if it is damage control

https://twitter.com/Hbomberguy/status/1346906844011376645
"sure, you're pardoned for trespassing ... welcome to treasonous intent anyway"
so that would be an *amazing* move
someone mentioned earlier that entry to that building is itself an explicit crime separate to trespassing
even if it didn't forcing his pilots to act against air traffic contorl without an emergency should have several associated charges
but attempt to entry when denied might count
technically not entry until he goes through customs
but at that point his plane then gets surrounded and he gets arrested and handed over to the hague
it would be rather unprecedented to shoot him down so he could still try force his way onto the ground
even if he did force his way in with a private plane
if interpol accepted that warrant scotland won't protect him
didn't interpol accept his international arrest warrant
softly?
presumably it also connects to the capitol building
the presidential metro is a thing
for good
and if they stick to their word there, the first tweet that actually comes out of his hands rather than an aide's means he's banned
and most of them to have explicit reversals
they pretty much need a review of every single piece of legislation that passed and every judgement by the supreme court
all this is going on while they also know they have to be like "we have control finally *get me a list of everything he did so we can fix it*"
like verbatim
does ... does he not realise he's doing exactly what he suggests
which is totally unsurprising
even if any were sympathetic to him at the start they despise him now for how he's personally treated them
even during pandemic
they despise him for doing things like forcing them to work holidays so he can go golfing
they're not even slightly from what everyone close to him has said
we need to know more
or if someone on her side started shooting first
without a full report we don't even know if it was someone from the WH side or someone from her side with a ricochet or just poor muzzle safety
if trump still wants it they'll let him walk out there on his own
likely even they don't want violence and a coup now reality hits that they'd be in the firing line

thing is the flick isn;t even a serif in most fonts but for some reason sans serif fonts like to remove it anyway
that top one is asymmetric and looks more like an l
I with lines at top and bottom would stand out more in a sans serif font than l with a flick matching t
TNR <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
they've figured out 0 and O by width
it's the one major confusion that sticks around
but ffs l needs a little flick like t
most of the time sans serif is easier to read
there's also a ~ half-pixel width difference only visible if you swap between tabs
but - actually nevermind sure
no it was in the real
now that there's warning they can A) be prepared, B) people will expect it and not go finding the impersonators

the content that you would find objectionable is literally not in the film and is the whole message that it's against
it mostly uses presentation more than actual content to intentionally make it uncomfortable
Skimpy clothing is as far as it goes and even then you see worse elsewhere
which is *a fair bit different*
I think people are talking past each other here as dunkek is saying this person *actively advocates* for the fictional genocide; not just accepts it happens or otherwise lets it slide, but actively goes "fuck yeah exterminatus"
it was made by many things of which that's one of the most recent
but it might explain a fair number
If true it probably wouldn't explain all as the stats seem *slightly* higher than the estimated rate that this happens
(this has "nothing to do with genetics" because genetics don't determine blastocysts subsuming each other that's a much more random process)
one compelling theory I've seen actually has nothing to do with genetics and postulates that (at least some) trans people are the result of fraternal twins absorbing each other at the very early stages, such that the internals of the body are literally a different genetic makeup to the rest. The reason this is compelling being I've also seen a few trans people get karyotyped and turn out to have their self-identified genetics
not really how it works when you're getting this complicated
ideas that it's genetic are nothing more than hypotheses at this point really
I would generally assume that the reality in a totally open society would be pretty much equal, but selection bias of where you see us (being open about it anyway) or whether people are willing to come out even to themselves makes everything look fucky
which is another thing confusing it and probably making it look like there's more
oh yeah, also I've seen some people comment on how r/ftm is *huge* compared to any single subreddit where mtf seem to dominate
well, papers tend to select from particular areas, so you get areas based on which study you look at
again, not the stats I see. A few areas report higher but I've seen plenty of areas report double the rate of ftm
statistics from many places even indicate ftm is up to twice as common (but probably just more likely to have come out IRL)
because of the communities you're in favouring us, nothing more. I see the opposite question elsewhere plenty

all the rules are made up nothing matters
yep. Though with how fucky it is I wouldn't be surprised if occasionally you'd have the gonad just going "fuck it it's testosterone time" anyway
might even be more by now, I've not kept up
that one's been known for a while, but it's in the past 5 years or so they found these two XY and SRY-normal women who gave birth
biology just doesn't work the whole thing is a farce that somehow keeps going because nothing's stopped it yet
so very literally
were XY-female also
the children they had
oh yeah and
fun fact epigenetics can also play roles even earlier, and there are two known cases of women with Y chromosomes and completely normal, functional SRY genes giving unassisted birth. So even this is a simplification
It's fair, I have looked in a lot of detail on the exact mechanisms
the shift towards being testes does not do anything like positioning, to be clear; that happens far too early for that to be relevant. It's purely internal cellular changes to enable the T production, and the physical form changes are caused by that T surge a few weeks in
later being like week 5 or something, to be clear
CAIS people have the gonad shift but being immune to the effects of testosterone means they do not develop down any of the rest of the M pathway
there are two stages to early male development, and SRY only triggers one early switch setting things up, not the full development. SRY will nudge the gonads towards being testes, and this will then cause a testosterone surge when it comes time to develop M traits
testosterone causes many thing
testosterone causes the major changes and is why complete androgen insensitivity syndrome causes all to be physically F
SRY causes testosterone to be producible later with an early minor switch
No, testosterone is the major cause
do you try to eliminate aspergers?
the issue is deciding what counts
it's neither, then either M takes over or F gets to continue
but it's not F until that override happens
also I'mma side with lank here as it's phrasing it very oddly to call it default; the body is neither until a particular stage at which point the presence of testosterone can override development in one direction
that one right there
like
the second word
eeh, so long as we're careful with the knowledge and don't start trying to go for prenatal eugenics with it, I'd prefer we know. You never know how its knowledge can be applied to help people
and multiple mechanisms would make more sense than declaring one single cause for all
not actually true. though it is shifted enough to be obviously different, can't really say if it's just being-more-honest-with-yourself or something actually different because of the developmental changes

I mean when there were jewish nazi collaborators, and significant historical proof of such, I'm not at all surprised that there would be collaborators in all the SEA countries that got invaded

yeah
redo is just

hence maybe my suggestion that they should when there's a massive burst of attention like this
discord doesn't provide moderation
I'll still say it's possible discord are innocent if they decided to check it out with all the attention and saw it at a bad time - say when most of their mods were asleep - but it is mighty suspect
definitely think they could afford it then <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
'cause no matter how good the mods are there's no way they were ready to handle the influx they got
maybe discord should use some of that nitro money to help provide temporary moderation to servers that see surprise attention
discord is sus but also eh compared to selling people's stock for them at what appears to be old values
I won't say there's not excuse of convenience even if it might be true

playing increases both odds that you will eventually and by you ever talking about it or engaging with others who play increases the odds they will
but america is obsessed with using that far more than it's justifiable
so the professionals lay out the law's considerations and then randoms give their opinion
because sometimes the question is whether it was morally justified, not legally
jury makes sense for some crimes but not others. america being so obsessed with them (And then refusing them if they're aware of their full rights as a jury) makes no sense
not for it being high at all
Japan is only exceptional for being over 99%
you know that measuring the same statistic of cases that have a full judgement only, *most* countries have over 90% conviction rate?
that statistic ignores suspended cases
this paints a very different case to "99% conviction rate"
"Public prosecutors typically concentrate on suits where conviction is almost guaranteed, leading to the suspension of around 60 percent of criminal cases in Japan without an indictment."
there can when basically no uncertain cases even hit the courts in japan
japan's very high conviction rate has more to do with only pursuing open-and-shut cases than it does with being overly strict in sentencing
and japan likely has less as it has a very low incarceration rate, and a very low rate of pursuing charges
because it has the most incarcerated
by sheer numbers, it will do
noi, while I agree, when you have so many as the US there are plenty of innocents there

<:base_think:635676313520439326> not sure. The govt system is often phrased like that but it's much more resembling the UK system, which it was modelled off before WW2 and actually didn't change much as a result of
versus in america there may be dubious evidence or aggressive tactics instead
oh that's also an issue in japan but goes the opposite way, it's part of their reluctance to pursue uncertain cases
yeah
private prisons actively encouraging recidivism?
Japan's system definitely has problems, particularly with *under*-conviction; and lots of obvious crimes are not pursued by the police if it's not clear they'll be able to actually pin it on anyone. Especially in regards to sex crimes. But the high conviction rate, while it needs to be kept an eye on, is not really one of them
if you include those, israel is 72%, canada is 62%, US is 68%, and Japan is only 37%
Israel is 93%, canada is 96.%, UK is 80% in crown court and 84.8% in magistrates' court, US was 93% in 2012 and has been consistently rising since 1972, China is 99.9%, Russia is 99.7%

these all being when measured the same way as japan's 99.3%, which ignores cases where charges were dropped
who *think they want pure anarchy
while that UK coalition sucked it is a valid counter to "making coalitions more would just result in deadlock" that gets put around
that's a misrepresentation and the "high risk" groups actually didn't foreclose much. It was much more "safe" middle class people who took out second homes and therefore were perfectly happy to default because it wasn't literally their house at risk <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
idk about gamestop

that's the whole point of *a*

it directly helps the US but it also spreads beyond far more than it should
and I'd add to that as stupid as it is much of the world acts with the US as a trendsetter, either politcally or at the individual level, so if the US had behaved sensibly UK and the bad parts of europe could well be doing better. The US getting its stuff together therefore acts as a bare minimum bojo & co have to look at

while he certainly hasn't been historically left and that should never be forgotten, with how he seems to be listening to the likes of bernie and AOC and what's actually passing, (I saw some say "look biden's meeting the repubs to talk about this 600b he's totally going to accept that" and then he didn't) I'd hold off and see what stances he actually takes in this presidency before ripping him to shreds for it
they're meaningless compared to the absolute top but it's also meaningless to contextualise it that way and not consider each group's circumstances
compared to wall street, yes, these people are all the same. In any meaningful terms such as how to attract these people's votes? You're looking at entirely different issues even considering purely economic grounds
that completely neglects people who very much can't live off investment but do still live with extravagance because of their wages, *such as* people who maintain second homes
versus second homes being dropped left and right
but yeah the article I recall seeing most recently found that the peak default rate from "high risk" groups was about 8%? From an average of 6%
almost better return than stocks then and much simpler

there's plenty of plans that would satisfy everyone except politicians who lose lobbyist money
also treating the full range of people who aren't living off investment as identical is ineffective at convincing them all to join you as they see how different they are to working and unable-to-work classes and vice versa. it's much more effective to actually see those differences then say "but none of these matter because look how rich that fuck is"
you can have monetary trade without a fundamentally capitalist system
see: active defunding of fusion research, minimised interest in fission, even though we knew about climate change decades ago and knew that nuclear technologies could solve it
under capitalism no matter how good your tech is there will be a constant drive to *force* unnecessary consumption
just slowing down the issue
it's also nowhere near a solution
but that's a different thing

asteroid mining may not be terrible for rare earth metals that are actually useful
managed properly, earth definitely has plenty for everyone. There's more than enough arable land with proper farming and distribution, there's enough material to make storage and housing, there's *way* more than enough energy if we're just a bit more sensible on nuclear policy (And especially if we add fusion)
humanity itself doesn't have infinite growth, we already see developed countries plateauing or declining in population. Capitalism's hunger for infinite growth would force that issue of finite resources, and demands that we find ways to consume resources that we literally don't need or want

" In a blog post from September 2017, Adams described himself as being "left of Bernie [Sanders], but with a preference for plans that can work".[41]

In 2015, although Adams stated that he would not endorse a candidate for the 2016 elections, he repeatedly praised Donald Trump's persuasion skills, especially on his blog,[42][43] extensively detailing what he called Trump's "talent stack",[44] the then-candidate's unusual skill set combination. Adams predicted that Trump would win the Republican nomination and the general election.[45]"
the last book was finished by ... sanderson I think?
~~yeah, pretty good reason to no longer have a job~~

while somewhat true, part of the point of mRNA vaccines, which most (all?) of these are is they should be easily modifiable with new mRNA and no actual change in the body's response, other than changing effectiveness. This would then mean we can respond *much* faster to new variants by getting new samples and setting their mRNA up for synthesis, compared to previous vaccines needing quite considerable development and trials before being deployable
while yes they should keep their borders closed - they shouldn't be stopping use and this is not a reason to be worried until there's corroboration
and is based on only 42 symptomatic cases
I'm not reading the actual study to be confident but it seems more like they're saying there was a trend towards 75% reduction in number of cases per pop that's now reducing to 22%, assuming they're right. Which is A) still reducing, B) could well be nothing to do with the vaccine and everything to do with people thinking "vaccinations are going round it's fine now" and behaving differently
but when the error bars are from -50 to 60%
if it is, it's less likely vaccine resistant and more that it's deviant from the current viruses causing it to be unreliable immunity
it's only addressing mild disease, not peer reviewed yet, and has enormous error bars
seems very premature from reading about what the actual content of the study is

jobs are lost to greedy CEOs and other upper levels
actual jobs beget more jobs either from the same company expanding or others seeing opportunity to compete/specialise/otherwise work around it
one job role being filled is likely to create more as productivity goes up and there are more needed to support it. At least if the leadership aren't gutting everything to cut costs - which is a different problem

"number of degrees awarded per number who started course" is reductive on both sides of the divisor and even further neglects the question of whether women have to continue performing better on paper just to get the same treatment and opportunities with it anyway
if you attempt to account for these at all it pretty much immediately flips back to men doing better in higher education
women outperform men only in limited measures, not accounting for the number that fail to get in because standards of entry can be higher, and therefore your entrants are of course more likely to finish, or the number of men who "fail" higher education but for reasons like starting their own business - not simply failing to perform, but overperforming and deciding they don't need the qualification

this sounds like "doctor" is being used over-specifically to discount some heavily male-biased sub-fields and make the number look more extreme

likely that'd be an emergency charge option - large facilities can generate hydrogen more efficiently so it would be preferred to refill the tank directly
we can always just fall back to straight splitting it from water
with hydrogen people are trying to because there are some ways of doing that - it's just often they're polluting because they ex. release it from fossil fuels
basically with electric we know WYSIWYG, no-one's trying to get more than 100% of the electrical energy into the battery
but its total efficiency is pretty close to a battery
it's considered hard because it's a chemical and we want some cheat method of getting more than 100%
there's close to 100% conversion from electric to hydrogen
eh, not really
you can build hydrogen tanks out of some of the most common elements on earth
hydrogen is a bit less practical than electric but does definitely solve the density and material shortage issue
but there's no ETA on that because it's an entire technology switch and will mean a whole new supply chain for it
a lot of the future battery tech interest is in moving away from lithium as we know ex. sodium *should* be way more energy dense and powerful - we're just having chemical difficulties actually building a battery to use it in the same way
but they do show technologies that might be good for other vehicles where battery capacity isn't there and they just need to push efficiency high
F1 cars can't
yes, and there's a reason FE has 1/6th of the power output. F1 cars lose far too much to drag to even consider electric, they can't exploit regen for the same efficiency gain - batteries don't need the same energy density for regular road vehicles because they can recover a lot
the tech doesn't help that much when there's just not the capacity to meet demand
at least if you're not driving something like an F1 car with it
for road vehicles the batteries are dense enough already
the batteries are expensive and not available enough driving the price upward with demand
main problem with EVs is the *cost of energy storage

earthquake waves have a velocity around 2-8 km/s depending on material and depth

(jets are ICEs, just not reciprocals)
doesn't work for aircraft and the modern world *is* kinda dependent on them - unless you're willing to go open-cycle core
mmmm maybe for ships. there's other concerns with how laissez-faire large shipping crews can be with safety and giving them nuclear reactors
we haven't hit limit yet
and for aircraft, turbine engines have trended around a percent improvement every couple years for decades
it very much can when typical ICEs are 30-35% efficient and over 50% is demonstrated possible
ships would likely benefit hugely from having MGU-Hs
anything that can get more efficient needs development
no-one's really suggesting development in ICEs though?

at least, yet - because I would counter that we do. Ships and aircraft can't go full electric - ships because there's simply not enough storage to cover those ranges and masses, aircraft because the densities are orders of magnitude too low to be viable for anything other than 5 minute tourist flights anyway

but as the article mentions to take full advantage of the kite like that would require designing in from scratch. it's impractical to retrofit
on the other hand there may be secondary benefits for that kind of work also, like a radar mounted to the wing's rigging for greater LOS
apparently twice the UK
and a lot of it is because we just accept shipping the same item back and forth a dozen times in its manufacturing rather than say, have automated local manufacturing covering a lot of it
(and they wouldn't anyway, it's one tiny cable. you can shoot around that easily and worst case shoot through it, it gets cut away and you have to buy another)
you seem very obsessed with the military ship focus for something that started discussion from shipping
keep up
yes, because military has budget for fuel
but it could definitely fit 3-4 kites if they wanted
they don't because military has budget for fuel and it's rather difficult to retrofit such notable changes
I also can't find images of it using the kite for reference, but what we can find is that the niamh is 80 metres in length. The kite is 20 sq m, so it's going to be about 15 metres across - while not small, still *plenty* of room to practically fit multiple kites on that ship
14 is definitely not uncommon
highly dependent on the ship and how much it values speed based on its cargo
14 is a more typical cruise speed for all ships
normal for maximum speed, not normal for cruise speed
the article specifically states the military ships are using it for power generation, not propulsion

that's not a military vessel ...
they cover distance by running 24/7, not by having a top speed
that's typical for ships
6 is huge
and considering that same ship's maximum service speed is 14 knots
on the vessel demonstrated. That has more than enough room for more sails, and the sail can be used *with* regular propulsion at the same time
those do exist but are much less realistic due to the deck space they take up, preventing use as a cargo ship, and that they're not *really* as effective as proponents make out
much lighter than sails and can be raised much higher, to catch stronger winds that aren't being interrupted by the sea surface

It's probably not as impossible as you're making out, but the biggest issue is they still need internal power generation. *long term* internal power generation. Plus backup for the cases where even on open sea they do run out of wind, and these will likely need to be ICE power

he thinks that he's figured out exactly what he should do many times and fucks it up entirely because of that, millhi
also re:zero absolutely does not work outside of isekai setting because it is *dependent* on subaru being an absolute boneheaded idiot who thinks he's smarter than everyone but doesn't know anything about the world he's in
the whole point is that mercantilism had much more advanced tricks of the trade even back then

and it can, while staying within power budget, add a buttload of AI processing and raytracing
for something more comparable 3070 is still a worse process node, so still less efficient, but at least a modern one, and is 60% faster in just raw compute for 200W
and the 2080 is significantly older at this point
apparently in typical games it does use less, 160-200 W. But so does a 2080 if you've got vsync on and aren't pushing it as hard as possible; PS5 is still rated for more
even a 3080 is rated at 320W, and is over twice as powerful as a PS5
a 2080 is rated somewhere around 200-240 W, I don't recall exactly
PS5 is rated 340-350 W
thaaaat's very wrong?
I mean, $9/kWh *is* huge. it's just they also need a huge amount at the same time
normal winter you can just turn all heating and cooling off and have a comfy house
they don't have any alternate or cheaper heating because they so rarely need *any*
it's texas
and again: totally uninsulated houses
that only takes 4 kW
space heaters are on the order of kilowatts
yes?
couple kilowatt heaters will easily do that
or lower, possibly
for uninsulated houses in -20C temperatures
which is absurd
that's 300x more than the baseline price I saw quoted around
don't know if they just had bigger houses or their contract was actually shiftable and worse
I saw others apparently paying *much* more than 5k

:sus:
https://youtu.be/O-_IAKCBTxc same aircraft type, same airline, same destination, same engine side
huh
but looking like that ... yeah, not worth it for maybe a couple hundred material cost and a couple thousand machining
parts have been reused from pretty bad bonks (and occasionally that's gone wrong, JAL123)
I mean if it wasn't totally shredded and hadn't fell from altitude they'd probably reuse parts
though I was about to add for UA777 that they won't bother repairing the housing, but engine components may be reused depending on what exactly happened
US1549
cosmetic housing of the engine isn't worth it
minimal damage to expensive parts will often have attempts to repair
usually a lot more damaged than this was
maybe it was a different aircraft I'm thinking of
oh well, correction
hm, I recalled it being restored
After a few more years of service, yes
but an entire airframe is expensive enough to make it worthwhile
although the airframe from the hudson crash *was* reused for a few years
carbon fibre or not you generally won't reuse crashed parts from an aircraft because you hold them to too high standards
there's probably some but that was just a point at the race car crashes
NTSB will want incident analysis
with carbon fibre it's usually not useful anyway so unless they need parts for crash analysis they won't try too hard to get it back
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
not have a circus crew, same way air crews need to be qualified
planes ... you need to do everything *right*
but with a bare minimum of competence from crew it's hard to screw up boats
doesn't always work, see: costa concordia
plane? You're not allowed below 150 mph *at best* and you have maybe an half an hour if you lose power at maximum altitude
boat? Barring massive flooding, just power away from any rocks and wait. Car? Stop and call
it's also highly regulated precisely because there's no real option for "just play it safe and wait for rescue"; stopping and calling isn't an option, the plane has to get itself to safety with only things that are already on it
you have all engines that work running so that you have power if you need it
if you're even thinking about things like that it's already too late to save
but it can fly
it's not the best and any attempt to climb will be extremely sluggish
4-engine aircraft are designed to fly with both 2 and only 1 engines still working (for some circumstances, like a full power climb, two engines on one side is worse than 1)
I think covid has largely taught us that we mostly just don't give a f
weird way to do it

it's just "how far does it reach with how much technical capacity"
yeah looking at this it doesn't factor in things like "how old/likely to imminently collapse is the infrastructure"
"how do you, as a person who travels exclusively by rolls-royce and private jet, think your infrastructure is doing?"
if parts like this factor in *at all* then it's probably worth approximately jack shit <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>

and why aren't there enough nurses
how many nurses regularly do less than 12 hour shifts
/ fairly compensated for how bloody hard that work is
~~or cryptomining~~
it's a valid point but not a straight up doubling
eh, questionable because while half couldn't provide income they did still (if willingly paired off) provide value-indeterminate work at home, a lot of which has also been improved in efficiency
productivity is *vastly* increased, if you just got compensated at historical rates young people could easily provide for a whole family including parents
rich bastards stealing everything is a much bigger issue than supporting an aging population
I think too many people just don't give a fuck and cities are dense enough that they can keep things spreading
although HIV while often considered an STI as that's the most effective way it transfers, isn't, it's blood-borne and can spread through any bodily fluid derived from blood (which is all except like 1 or 2)
the described threat needs to spread much more freely
STIs by nature are not the kind of threat described because while a lot of people fuck around a lot plenty don't and so it has limited reach
IVF or other forced methods would be developed
but yes cures would be developed even if they became horribly eugenics-y
(2) is <:doubt:484139588089282580> from recent evidence
how many people move out of the city once they're ready for kids, would be another question to add to that
although over such a long period I doubt if it would be initially considered significant
which in that scenario wouldn't be an option
we don't really have a better baseline for how the world as a whole would respond anyway. There's localised areas of dropping birthrate, sure, and some better-or-worse responses, but the most effective response has been consistently "increase immigration"

so you're talkin shit even if it is exclusive to your experience
also I looked it up. Both police and teachers in germany have a median pay of 32-33k eur
ergo, teaching needs to be paid more to be worthwhile
you don't have people willing to do teaching
you have people willing to do that job
nah, don't
pay that rate if you want the people
you're competing with chemical engineering companies and statistics companies
like there's shortages of maths and science teachers in particular *because the people qualified to do that can do so much better in other industries*
imagine how many teachers you'd have if you just straight up doubled all teaching salaries
congrats on figuring that out
$$$$
if you don't have enough people, you need to attract them
there needs to be less obsession with how much work is *perceived* to be worth
if there's not enough teachers, they're not overpaid
you can flex hours within a range, such as having the general school day with a later start then allowing either coming in early or staying late for marking
"there are just less teachers" HMM I WONDER IF THAT COULD BE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PAID ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH TWEENS
like yes on the one hand nvidia is doing this out of selfishness, but they are also doing it because they *don't* like miners as a market; they are not reliable customers who will come back later, they are only interested right now because GPUs happen to be good at mining the current hotness. nvidia would rather curry favour with gamers who'll reliably come back
while this is true they can also charge more for the cards and pressure *less* of them to be bought. And right now their customers are rightfully pissed at so few being available, so it stabilises the market for them by actually creating some ability to meet demand
as is you lose updates because it becomes non-viable to put new version of the OS on old phone economically

I mean people in UK prisons who don't work still get 80% of the minimum pay
that's true smartphones are in a stupid situation
eh, not really, the rate of improvement is still extremely high. But the cost of development has increased
as a fund for when you get out
like UK pay rates are worse but you still *get paid* if unable to work in a UK prison
literally wage slavery in that case
cool justification still slavery
ie; still slavery
forced work for below minimum wage
"More than 60,000 inmates in Germany are required to work while in prison. They earn up to three euros an hour maximum – way below the national minimum wage. For big corporations like Daimler or Aldi they're a source of cheap labor."
letting people take care of things on their own generally goes very wrong
they didn't come from slave-catchers, but still more concerned with business money than individuals
metropolitan police in london were established primarily because of thefts from the docks
US is definitely a different case though the argument isn't that much different in europe
it can
uranium can power the entire human race alone for billions of years
uranium is more than abundant enough
it was like a few months from revised studies going "hey worst case is worse than we thought" to the earthquake
but yes they could have been more actively studying that
eh, I doubt any realistic amount of funding from the time studies identified the defenses were insufficient could have fixed it in time
it's just the earthquake hit a bit too soon
which they were aware of and trying to get funding to improve as of a few months before
meanwhile deepwater horizon is pushed as low as it reasonably can be for how bad it is
accidents I'm pretty sure are pushed to higher profile by oil
hopefully it's the former and they might be able to finally kick them away
CCP is in a weird case where I see some evidence that the chinese people are getting more savvy and dislike of them is actually getting more common, but idk how much that is just the savvy ones getting better at getting out and talking to the west
there's more than enough energy from clean sources to power the entire world to current per-capita consumption of the US, without first accounting for the wastefulness of corporations. Nuclear alone can do it for billions of years. Lifestyle changes *aren't* necessary, if the public were actually willing to rise up against the actual polluters
corporate overlords being unwilling to make improvements that were possible 30 years ago is a bigger issue
eh, the lifestyle changes are the minor part of it
it will end, one way or another - the spanish flu pandemic ended, worst-case covid pandemic will end the same way
the reactor itself literally had a steam explosion
Chernobyl was *caused* by meltdown
it's similarly minimal radioactivity in the exclusion zone. More than pripyat, but still minimal
fukushima wasn't particularly more dangerous just a lot more work to contain because of the nature of the failure
and the corium isn't going to spontaneously jump out
it could have been worse, yes. But the reactor *did not contain enough material* to be apocalyptic
it was noted because it was a sudden spike that travelled in a wave, not for actually being *that* exceptionally high
point is the radiation stayed in pretty normal levels
radon gas from the rocks in the US, yes
geothermal is good where possible but even more limited than hydro
even parts of pripyat that haven't been cleaned up are *less radioactive than half the US*
yes and chernobyl did not produce enough under any circumstances to be described like that
perhaps
ah, politically
chernobyl under no circumstances could be apocalyptic
mainly because there doesn't need to be, a coal powerplant operating normally is worse than chernobyl
which is why uranium ends up able to supply this
also while thorium is about 10x more common than uranium, uranium contains about 10x more energy
http://large.stanford.edu/publications/coal/references/docs/pad11983cohen.pdf a cogent argument that uranium alone is a renewable power source, as it can actually *outlast* renewables as sole supplier
every video from japan last year it was hard to find *anyone* without a mask, even when it let up around autumn
slow response, weaker lockdown, and just general reduced health consciousness
first thought: why the fuck are you letting *any* of us in
it could have been mitigated significantly. And then with mitigation and still going bad that might also act as a hint to everywhere else "hey no take this *seriously*"
doesn't stop people thinking that way
it is
yeah that was bad but I mean that that would've likely been reduced if there wasn't "hey we're doing better than *them* / they're not trying at all and it's not *that* bad"
for the whole world since plenty of places at least use the US as a baseline, even if they don't copy exactly
orange baby made that difficult
granted wfh makes it simple
mine was like july
previous failures had 4, 10, and 1 fuel channels meltdown before they got it under control. Chernobyl disaster had all 1000 go
one thing this fails to mention is that the same failure happened three times before chernobyl, including *at another reactor in chernobyl plant*, but CCCP hush-hush prevented it from being discussed and known about to mitigate the issue
though notably this is power capacity not energy
portugal ranks above UK

actually no that doesn't work either
maybe if you restrict to europe?
4th largest what?
many of which are very inefficient to produce
humans are only 25-50% efficient depending on aerobic/anaerobic exercise and need very restrictive "food" type energy sources
so with reinforcing the cave, there's no surface issues to deal with
there are some difficulties but much of the UK's pumped hydro is entirely underground
mountainous, a lot in wales or the peak district
adverts start, ~~everyone~~ enough people suddenly go and put the kettle on
a lot of it because of soap operas creating very well-synchronised spike demand, which is less signficiant now
fairly significant, yes
I think among all of europe's connected demands (as they're all linked grids at this point) it's very unlikely to ever get that oversaturated though
use that as an indefinite power sink
I don't know what would be done if this was saturated, but I believe if the UK cannot find consumers for electricity that gets produced, we let out some of the pumped hydro capacity without generating from it, then pump it back up again
there's just no benefit
and so nuclear appears to not throttle well when most plants actually can
like, in-use nuclear plants don't throttle with demand, but they also don't actually saturate demand in 99% of countries. What happens is their maintenance cycles, the major cost, come at the same regularity no matter what power they run at, so it's cheaper to produce as much energy as possible and they simply choose to outbid all other sources at low demand times
<a:ShirabeBonk:801207951645605958>
it is, plenty of plants are capable of it, but it also doesn't need to be. it's so available and so efficient it can just run full power constantly (or close to it with pumped hydro) and we can just ... find things to do with the excess at low demand times
but if it is produced greenly, it's great
do need to be careful that a lot of current hydrogen production is split off from methane so is not necessarily green
consider vehicles as requirements come
hydrogen also but methanol can have advantages in some cases
although methanol could be a viable storage medium for vehicles to use chemical energy instead of heavy batteries, so long as we fully legislate against any of it being mined. Only produced from atmospheric resources
yes, we shouldn't use that
big ones
but temporary restrictions like calm weather further south or cloud are issues
you can largely manage that by trading as you go north
the poles have pretty consistent wind actually so latitude isn't a big issue
also oil and gas are investing in solar and wind because they know it's not reliable and so stations to take poor weather load, usually natural gas, become necessary. They have a vested interest against nuclear because of its ability to provide baseline load
other than university sounding posher so being used by more expensive institutions
noi, no, america does not distinguish between them
a lot of people in trades are retiring young with wrecked bodies
another thing to consider though is a lot of trades are very physical jobs and often do not have the best practices to help preserve your health
and that's not necessarily true in the US, noi
it's not necessarily more guaranteed than university graduate jobs, that's very dependent on what you'd do in either
hydro does have a lot of issues with ecological damage
maybe that's a reasonable setup, while we have workable mountains for it, we don't have the best
actually looking again, it's all alps countries + portugal and UK further down
they do and all the alps countries being up there is good
then good job the rest of europe for also catching up (also why aren't we come on guys there's gotta be some empty mountains in scotland)
but it shouldn't be required
the option to do some things outside of course, like language, at university is good
3 years is normal for bachelor's in europe
and also making it generally take longer since IIRC most are 4 years?
so you're making up for it by compromising university level education
american secondary school is questionable
and why wasn't high school enough to establish those skills
just ignore the name as it comes from previous year classifications where it went first/second/third form all the way up to 6th
and colleges that provide the same level of education (as some specialise in alternate higher educations or trades) are sixth form colleges
you can in the UK also but that's considered separate from high school, even though it's often in the same building. that's sixth form
usually college but there's a few options
there isn't in europe either because this is a difference of when required education ends. High school in the US goes up to 18, in europe it goes to 16 and then you have 2 years of *something else*

sounds like paranoia, narcissism, and probably a whole bunch of other fun things
you'll be able to start eating normally again eventually, but it'll take time to convince the body that normal is normal
the body gets used to what's usual even if it's not healthy. Likely because in tribal times under-eating is more likely because there *isn't* food, rather than because someone in tribe is terrible
with how often the dog seems to be vomiting I am further concerned for its health as well <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
a lot of the studies are dubious, particularly if they focus on patterns of how the brain reacts as that's so poorly understood, but some of it does seem to have good basis. The BSTc size in particular has been shown to be:
- *extremely* dimorphic, there's very little overlap between cis men and women, meaning you can't easily point to random chance,
- unresponsive to hormonal history - cis men and women keep similar BSTc sizes if something forces them into an unusual hormonal balance, such as medical treatment
- the few trans people who've had this examined, in both directions, were found to be either within normal or extremely close to it for identified gender. It definitely appears there's something to this part

HOWEVER
demonstrating even that this is a common or likely feature, doesn't tell us that it's the cause rather than a symptom, doesn't tell us the mechanics, or even that it's part of the only possible mechanic. Good science is to focus on the individual choice as we fundamentally don't understand it fully and ensuring everyone's happy is the best result, regardless if it disagrees with physical assessment
both can have similar effects until you really get into the precise details
paranoia could be a resultant effect and I was thinking either bipolar or borderline
best case: BPD. Best still being bad, you cannot help that if she doesn't get help herself
worst case: this is intentional gaslighting. It's gaslighting either way but if it's BPD it's not entirely intentional
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641> she literally can tho
in which case, it's not an imbalance in the brain, it's "world's fucked innit"
it's probably intended to help for a week-few months scale
I've also seen some theories that depression is an intended feature from evolution to help deal with difficult situations by dissociating and being able to make "purely rational" choices. Just throughout most of evolution, we didn't have a capitalist hellscape putting people in that state for years on end
that kind of thing is the issue with essentialism. Dismissing an entire problem because of one point you consider to be against it, even if there's only one tiny example of it
though to give a more succinct example of an essentialist statement on depression, that's also a lot more toxic; "you can't be depressed if there's still something that makes you laugh"
the idea that it's just chemicals in the brain causing depression (especially if *particular* ones are pointed out) is hotly debated and I assume armis' response covers that. SSRIs are only one of the chemical options and they don't work that well, just better than any other medication we've tried for most

and I didn't go to law school but I've had it covered, common law contracts (with only a few exceptions that need a legal deed rather than plain agreement) require https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration
while "A gift, in the law of property, is the voluntary and immediate transfer of property from one person (the donor or grantor) to another (the donee or grantee) without consideration."
you don't have to do it but big budget things will do it for CYA
but legally they do have the power to stop you
using famous people in fiction technically would require their permission if you can't bring it under fair use, but *usually* people just don't care enough to pursue and you can kinda do whatever
the world isn't so dystopic that you need to actively do anything to protect your identity
no you literally can you own the copyright to yourself
eh
it's just
but yeah you can't really tell them they're wrong
even there it's eeeh the youtubers might not be realising how obsessed some people can get and it's really not healthy in many cases
it's just theirs
it's not theirs until they choose to not invite you
plus you'd likely need to make the agreement that that is its purpose explicit ahead of time anyway; something is not no longer a gift if the giver can tangentially benefit from it, say if you buy a BBQ for a family member and then they invite you to a BBQ party
if it's a dumbphone then you can maybe make the argument that being able to contact your child is value, but you can't really make an argument that a smartphone is of comparable value to that with everything else it does, and value has to be comparable. Classic example used would be you cannot contract a $1 bill for a $100 bill, unless it's a *specific* $1 bill that makes it exceptional from others
this is a matter of legality rather than morality or emotions. There needs to be at least an approximately quantifiable gain
contract requires mututal comparable gain
gift is not contract
that's exactly what I'm saying
yes?
although a sale would be easier to justify as one
and neither is a sale
because a gift is not a contract
ergo unless a *reasonable* condition is *explicitly* established when giving, it is a gift, not a contract
and benefits must be comparable
not one party gain and costed
legally in the US both parties must benefit
if the parents do not establish consideration (some kind of explicit exchange where both parties gain something) then under US law it is not a contract, but a gift, and wholly owned by the child
snekode
this is what the majority are both online and off
plenty can just be for enjoying yourself
not every day is important
existing is not itself a purpose
but what *purpose* does that have?
how do you feel that the things you try to organise IRL would have more purpose?
this doesn't mean they won't come offline after
people are becoming very online, there's a pandemic
getting teachers at least reduces spread between classes as the contact point between them is removed, and kids with vulnerable family are asked to shield even if everyone else is going (which sucks for the kid)
students are considered but it's very difficult to identify who's caught it due to asymptomatic cases, and there's far too many to vaccinate at such a high priority
above the line for computer science/engineering/history/law
and that's even assuming they'd get to that point before graduation from courses comes around and they start joining classrooms
most countries are not going to realistically push to get absolutely everyone vaccinated once they start getting close to completion. laziness will kick in.

Therefore, it 100% makes sense to ensure future teachers are protected as a priority before that kicks in
someone studying something else isn't about to become a massive vector
no?
future teachers are therefore the same
teachers are to be prioritised because they are a massive central contact point
the point is to minimise total risk to the whole population
you're already having to distribute vaccine by health concerns which is literally something it's illegal to discriminate in just about every discrimination legislation in the world. "future teacher" is a trivial justification compared to that; for public protection, and with something that does not cause harm or disadvantage, the discrimination legislation is not relevant
<a:thinkHD:450682786324414474>
not really? You're separating by being teachers already
which is silly, there's no indication there would be anything wrong. It just wasn't 100% certified
that's probably the one
UK's high vaccination is partly contributed to by this that we took that as a "good enough with how dangerous it is" and started using them anyway. Nothing's cropped up since
similarly much of europe has been avoiding using some vaccines with *too old* people because the initial studies couldn't find enough participants to get significant results - but those who did take part didn't have anything immediately crop up
that'll just be the age it's been tested at, nothing intrinsically makes it required at that age
online's only disadvantage is lack of passive presence, letting you be aware of people
online is *just* as good for actually getting involved in something with those people
irl is better for passive interactions, just seeing someone on the next desk and saying hi, short convo
eh
"nah this won't look familiar to anyone in the west"
well, why aren't you?
they're explicitly banning any discussion of the material, promotion, or suggestion that anything they're doing is okay
you are allowed to discuss the fact they exist and need help
I'll also take it as while I don't know if I'll ever get around to seriously use it I like to collect interesting things like that.
so simplifying it to "japan was ultranationalistic" somewhat misrepresents since they only had to convince the people in the cities with the money and skills to work a military
main thing I know about that point though is that while strong the ultranationalism was limited in scope since they were barely out of the meiji restoration and huge parts of the country, including near major cities, was still living in effectively pre-medieval tech and society
I mean sure why not

others are criticising that the x is hard to pronounce for those who don't speak english, and depending on whether they're for or against either use that to just say "fuck off" or to advocate for latine instead (which makes most sense to me, but was also explicitly rejected by the royal spanish academy)
but reading up there seems to be a lot of argument just stemming from disagreement of how it's used. Some are thinking it's a replacement for latino as a term for the ethnic group as a whole, which I've not seen as much from advocates for it; most people, both for and against the term, prefer hispanic for the ethnicity. Latinx is intended as "this person is latinx" if they're a hispanic enby
"According to HuffPost, "Many opponents of the term have suggested that using an un-gendered noun like Latinx is disrespectful to the Spanish language and some have even called the term 'a blatant form of linguistic imperialism'".[5] Defending usage of the term against critics arguing linguistic imperialism, Brooklyn College professors María R. Scharrón-del Río and Alan A. Aja argue that the Spanish language itself is a form of linguistic imperialism for Latin Americans.[38][5]" now that's a burn
not seen latin@ though or sure how to pronounce it
not spanish but pretty sure that latinx was created by latinx queers as a self-identified term
otoh japan isn't dealing with the massive male:female bias coming
as japan's population pyramid is still shrinking
fair but then a lot suspect japan is kinda teetering
of bodies that were likely not well-taken-care-of
granted it now appears it will flatten around 150 million, but if life expectancy does become high and that age peak keeps travelling up, there's a big strain waiting
and since 2026 is conveniently exactly a 5 year shift (though obviously this isn't 100% recent), we can see a fully 2% drop is coming in that period
https://www.statista.com/statistics/1101677/population-distribution-by-detailed-age-group-in-china/ using this as reference and a population of 1.4 billion the 20-29 age range has already dropped to 180 m
as can chinese reporting, to be fair
this is presenting a problem that will develop over 2030-2060 period
considering how slow a problem a demographic shift is, anyone predicting it "any day now", at any point, is vastly misrepresenting it
https://youtu.be/vTbILK0fxDY
there's a discontinuity in the nature of the language
this language died and has been revived through the lens of the first language known by revivers
True, but languages that haven't died have gone through a continuous evolution
this would be the problem with the idea of a language being preserved
searched up & found videos of people speaking revived cornish.
I immediately notice that things like the general rhythm ... are basically just english. I highly doubt this is actually being spoken the way the last native speakers were
Cornish is gone, IIRC
I mean ... not really?
not if people aren't speaking it
english is already kinda displacing some of the smaller european languages like dutch
because school books definitely contain the most natural language use in the world yep
how do you put the words together?
because there's going to be a lot of the more subtle intricacies that just can't easily be recorded
eeeh maybe. I think if that was sufficient we wouldn't be needing machine learning guesstimations to do an okay job of machine translation
even a problem when it's obvious what language will get you literally anywhere, huh?
(in fact by nature of the work and how it's paid it's arguably *by definition not* reflective of that)
% of GDP does not necessarily reflect % of population and a large out of work industrial class could be a major issue
from that video
(and because their pronunciation is so bad, often more difficult for english speakers too)
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
then there's japan, taking loan words for words they literally have and making things more difficult for the ones that don't speak english
you can basically trip on the border to luxembourg and fall out the other side
true, pretty much all tax havens are tiny
it just gets HQs at best
point, but tax haven also still doesn't attract lots of shops and get the working class able to spend money
literally the republican "strategy", if you want to give them the benefit of the doubt that they ever were seriously trying to do best by the people, has been tested, and *failed*
the governor refused to change course and it eventually got to the point that eight repubs and like one dem in the level below governor (I don't remember exact names for american systems) banded together to veto the low taxes and get the state back to some state of sanity
no such thing happened, if anything businesses left because the state was poorly maintained with no money for things like road works and mounting debt
I don't remember exact details of what to google for more, but for years kentucky was trying the ultra-low taxes that repubs claim will encourage businesses to move in and which should "easily" make up for the low rates in booming business
it's the US calls for insurrection are legal if they're vague enough
I doubt they'll be so sane twice, though
the state that let it get so bad republicans had to veto low taxes to get state income back and actually start getting infrastructure mildly under control
it's kentucky

they're fair-weather customers that will drop stock and crash prices the moment their imaginary investments shift the wrong way
nvidia are in fact doing some of the most to alleviate the demand by restarting previous generation of production, considering a second, and already using the 2-gen-old node for the mining cards. Sure they do profit off it, but they're pushing hard to legitimately meet the demand and bring prices back down
nvidia figured out with so much silicon demand a specialised processor can *make* that demand
old process nodes were stopped pre-corona as normally there wouldn't be any demand for their slightly lower efficiency and higher cost
the mining cards are 12 nm that they stopped production of
by turning on the old fabs
uh, you can
mining caused them to use their entire allocation and prices to rise significantly
in this case the power is only cheap because it was a small town with a local hydro dam so they effectively got first bid
highly dependent
the cheapest power in the US banned them outright in 2018
and places with cheap power are trying to kick them out as by their very nature of existing they make the power more expensive
Not if you want to actually use the cryptocurrency income

at which point why take the risk of all that being taken down by not declaring something
you can shift margins easily enough, but to do this you need a legitimate business that makes like 90%+ of the profits
it's not "too much", it's "we review this stuff for a living and you're claiming to make 20x the profit from this machine than any other company can manage. We now have a warrant and police are coming to find out what you've not declared."
so long as you have to declare what it is and where it's from, you can always just go "hey, company, did <suspect> purchase this stuff from you?" "No we've never heard of them"
these will either: straight up not add up if they just don't declare the income, or you'll find some source that's unreasonably high because it's not real and they're using it to hide the income
or just, you know, declared income, declared assets, acquisitions
then you use that as probable cause to investigate
same way you figure out it's going into drugs or prohibition alcohol. the taxes don't add up with this person suddenly being able to spend a lot more than they could reasonably be earning
it's always taxes they get caught on
tax electricity used for mining
that's pretty hard to regulate
calling cryptocurrency innovation is dubious
wiki indicates that paris now uses geothermal hot water for domestic heating, unclear if this replaced the steam system or is a separate system
hot water would be perfectly viable
actually paris doing it is odd, because there's basically no high rises and therefore no issues with excessive head pressure
(you could also use staged pumps up the whole high rise to keep the pressure moderate but if you're looking to do it at scale this is an unlikely solution, at least when NY needed to solve it)
radiators here though just use the house's own hot water so the limit is maybe 4 m elevation pressure from being on a second floor. Not many are even 3 story
if it were ever let out in a small leak
but also means water coming out of the pump at the bottom of a high rise would be a jet cutter
Only if you're pumping from the top. If you're pumping from the bottom then you just need 1 atm of pressure per 10m, which isn't *too* hard with water
send all the cryptominers to mars with musk to mess up that planet instead
it'd be fucked up even if it was in the heat of the moment, lying *just* to needle guilt
showers are kinda loud
yeah that's kinda udnerstandable then
and with the fact it's america, some of these challenges will have succeeded
"The Top 10 lists are only a snapshot of book challenges. Surveys indicate that 82-97% of book challenges – documented requests to remove materials from schools or libraries – remain unreported and receive no media."
*yeah* one of these things is not like the others

He used to lecture just before we had one in the same hall I remember
this is not a small uni we can't afford the lecture room space to allow random public in
even though all the physics students say he's not actually a very good lecturer once you get above TV level <:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
and that's another reason why they *have* the ID system here as even with it, far too many people try go to lectures from lecturers who got popular on TV like brian cox
the second campus here is a modern one that they tried to spread to, then realised it wasn't practical so they turned the sports ground it has into something publicly accessible most of the year for profit and brought everything else back to main campus
there is an old second campus that they don't use any more about 2-3 miles away but that's too far to have people actually travel between them in reasonable time so it's not used except for exams
... yeah no that's not at all what it's like here. Research fellows do have to do some teaching also, they're in buildings nearby where that happens
fair enough then. There's still not room here for them to make any clean division, if they have a building, it's almost always dual-purpose teaching and research
are they closer-to-17th-century-than-modern-day old for their original establishment?
it's an old city centre campus rooms get put where they can be put within the buildings they have
... this isn't some fancy new campus built away from a city where they can plan and specifically separate research buildings
also my university being one of the bigger and better ones, some PhD projects did have MoD backing. Literal national security concerns
wouldn't be surprised if chemistry even at least had explosive precursors
and there's plenty of real expensive stuff you just kinda *don't want stolen*. Especially things like the radioactives or x-ray sources from the physics buildings
and the IDs have picture just in case it ever needs to be tightened and they check people aren't sharing them
basically all the buildings require ID so you don't get just random strangers walking into labs with potentially hazardous material
has your picture on
that, y'know
... with the ID card you use to get into the building in the first place
it's not hard when you don't need to do it often, and you only need to do it on school grounds
this is all it can do, yeah, but you can work from the ones it highlights. Same order and flow, flag, then if there's major similarity or a pattern of multiple flags university staff then look for these people and see if they're meeting up a lot or sitting together in lecture

there have been people who got booted most of, or even over a year later after it became certain due to investigation
be very careful with that
a UK university won't necessarily pull you up the moment something is flagged as potential plagiarism
sure for a simple project there's benefit of the doubt that there's only so many ways to do something, but for any ML, no, there's enough code that yours will be unique in the history of the course
and no two people have the exact same naming sense and code style
we didn't have any of that but they'd still easily find copied work *because it would be identical to someone else's*
they need to not
yes and they're fucked up
naaaaaaaaaah you know the significance of death by 13
maybe 20 if the sports section is bigger than I'm thinking (I would expect like 5 pages)
4 sides to one folded sheet and always a complete number of sheets for binding simplicity
by the nature of tabloid it's probably either 12 or 16 and you're probably right
just a tiiiiiny selection bias there
perhaaaaaps not
that'll also help
manchester can't really afford to expand because all the land is kinda just taken
2 will be under some land pressure then, but site 1 will have been fairly cheap
and this section at the top right is also university buildings but they can't do much to connect it because of the housing between them
actually no a bit more than half
and has maybe half in the next "strip" to the left
the university goes up to the buildings just around the construction spot at the top
our university hospital is in centre-bottom of this, largely cut off

you have to go ridiculously far to get to anything that's not built up already
https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-aerial-view-university-hospital-rwth-aachen-university-hospital-aachen-92985645.html if this is at all representative then land is waaaaaaaaay cheaper there
the largest rooms are maybe 400 for that reason and courses just get split up to limit to that number; if course is oversubscribed create more specialist versions
40,250 enrolled students in 2018
while more capacity would alleviate this one lecture, we wouldn't have enough rooms if we spent space like that
yeah this wasn't because they wanted to <:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
still too many
which is why they had ID checks to limit it further to just physics students
it is an *absurd* number of people
and people were sat on the floor
this is quoted as a 250 seat theatre but has benches so can definitely push 350+
because too fucking many people
and that lecture always started late
was never able to see what about because the *enormous* room was *Always* packed
even if you take the requirement of only one ray you spin it around the patient while tracking its aim at the tumour. Most radiotherapy setups do this since it's easier to keep a single source calibrated correctly than 10
I mean technically not, it's just practically impossible
since that's an actual problem that had to be actually solved
with that riddle I'm more disappointed that with how prevalent cancer is only 3% of people know how they make radiotherapy safe
defense of redo is sus
18/17 is whateverthefuck there's so many more things that could be so much more problematic than that, if there was anything wrong at all
for that to not be just automatically problematic you'd need to be very careful about what exactly you're defending
trying to defend it at all is mighty sus though
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
and zenbu *did* say they tried to defend it
or rather if you don't, you need to be made to understand how heavy it is
clickbaitarticle probably not
which probably does have a lot of useful conclusions
because armis was recalling a similar study that's probably a lot more thorough which compared how people performed in with different abstract-thinking puzzles depending on how they were posed (and possibly relative performance by order of posing)
unlikely but can't say for certain without seeing the study design
which many huge studies don't end up with
the question is whether it has valuable conclusions
anything's a study if you ask a few people and write it down <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
might've got lucky and picked a cancer doctor
it's probably that they asked 30 people at midday on a crowded street and only 1 person wasn't too annoyed at them or distracted by noise to figure out what their wording was asking
why is this even a point of contention it was a tangent barely related to armis' point
it's identical to pivoting one gun to many directions
and it presented the easy to explain option
most of the cost is calibrating to make sure they don't miss
X-ray beams actually exist and aren't even that expensive
... it's literally what they did until they got good enough pivot mechanisms
radiotherapy doses are 20-30 Gy. 8 Gy is considered fatal *with* treatment and 6 is unlikely to survive
the riddle is a real problem that got solved IRL
it's "whatever" not "get out of jail free"
yeah that's whatever but I don't care to judge the server's reaction to that as if this got mentioned as part of an already-escalating fight then ofc it's going to fan the flames if he tries to use it as an excuse
*who is*
again
without knowing context there is no good reason to automatically assume it's 100% the former
"concerns" is somewhere former-biased in the middle of there
the range of contexts are "justified but definitely not actively cool" to "what the *actual fuck dude*"
we're just saying it's a suspicious thing to say and I would have concerns
and no-one's trying to give him an exact %-based should-be-in-jail rating
there's no need to leap to his defense
we're just saying that it could easily be legit to judge this guy for saying those things, based on context
I mean, *we're* not judging. We barely know what's going on
I don't know the server so this is just hypotheticals, but it would 100% explain it
that easily explains why it keeps turning toxic when decent people have to interact with people like that
if that server isn't, and this guy is a troublemaker
I mean a big reason this server *isn't* particularly toxic is getting rid of troublemakers relatively proactively
we don't know the exact answers but it clearly wasn't satisfactory
clearly
and it was asked
but does mean it's valid to have questions about a person who'll defend the most horrifyingly sexist show in years
a large piece will be more strained and more likely to split further than a small piece
and they would be fairly uniform anyway if it's due to shrinkage
I am considering how old the original surface is
the checkpoint is flawless
the straight road is ancient and cracked
how recently was that checkpoint established

and that only covers people i ncars
that still means making a request of the system. which you're having to do for *every* car you see
and multiple people could be driving most cars. it's still non-workable as it requires a ridiculous amount of looking up just to know whether it's relevant
it's definitely unworkable, but also is more workable than criminal record, since that's something that can't be tracked on the necessary scale
there's the same issue with catching illegal weapons in the US, because weapons can be legally carried, you can't just confront every person on the street who seems like they're hiding something on their person
curfews that apply to less than "everyone" need to be something very obvious
kinda hard to investigate every single person you see to see if they're allowed the curfew
which makes it hard to conclude either way
I can't particularly find english-language news for or against paris' use
meeting demand would require a *lot* more of them and a *lot* more nuisance being caused by them being left around or riding where they shouldn't
darwin isn't a great comparison to london at 46 people per sq km versus over 5000

a multitude of reasons
those things that everyone hates wherever they've been deployed?
and are happy to use it
wasted, or even arrested because ICE have far too much extralegal power
also only a valid test for the driver even if it was required
so there's still going to be a lot of "well I think you sound mexican so I'm going to assume you don;t have one rather than you left it"
fair but at least in the UK you do not need your license on you at all times
I'm not sure you have to prove citizenship to get one
gonna be largely based on whether you seem american
which notably few americans would carry proof of so
it's a checkpoint to stop cars and check if people are legally in the country
it's not clear that they are patched
IIRC melua lives in a very hot state so simply existing outside may mean sweaty?
specifically picked not-electric bike with cycle to work scheme
I take getting sweaty as part of also trying to lose weight
admittedly would get a little sweaty but nothing I can't reasonably wash off in the sinks
before WFH I cycled nearly 2 km to train station, had a 200-400m walk in another station to change train (depending on which platforms were used on the day), and then another 1.5 km to work. Not huge distances by bike, but all through hills
also the coin system is just entirely standard here too, though some smartasses have started making tokens that can substitute the appropriate coin
potentially a govt system could help some of the issues, but they're not govt systems. they're at closest contracted out by govts
payment in advance + watermarks
what *would* would be proposed bans on cars entering the centre at all
and with how much london already has public transit, and *who* are even coming in cars at all (people far out of the city centre driving in), I don't believe this will have that effect
and what systems are free?
I also go shopping on my bike. I have more expensive bags that I'd expect most to have *because* I'm more well off and specifically plan to do this, rather than just having it pop up nearby
it is when it's properly invested in and given priority over filling city centres with cars
and limits you to what fits in there
specifically addressed
> Can't exactly take anything you can't be physically wearing on a scooter
and also just how much it represents gentrification rather than offering more accessible options. Can't exactly take anything you can't be physically wearing on a scooter, for instance, it's not much use for the working class to go shopping
and it's hitting things, being a nuisance riding where they shouldn't (which *is* something that happens in european cities deploying them, even if they're less willing to be as aggressive fighting back), leaving them around to be tripped on, etc
doesn't really conclusively say anything
and so did LA despite the complaints
yeah, this is likely in this case
but the whole downside is having to manage things like health and work time yourself; it is something limited to those healthy enough to do it. *and*, if you're that good to justify the extra pay - this shouldn't result in there being less work for you
some people like freelancing because it does pay better since the companies more directly compete against each other to obtain your skills
but it's not worth the road tax in that case
it might be nice to have a car just for the odd occasion (I'd still probably prefer train because I can do stuff on train)
yeah that's another thing
which is probably about done by now
I don't get paid to do it but the money on my bike is a tax deduction
here even just the carpark is large enough that you'd walk further getting into the office
yeah I'm judging him at least
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
I mainly end up sweaty because I still try go fast despite the hills.
23 km makes more sense for e-bike than my 7-8, true
japan and korea are on multiple "waves" but controlled the initial spread so their waves are tiny
high altitude aircraft are very stable firing platforms and thin air means more power delivery
I actually can't think of an advantage of a laser that is made worse by being on a plane?
uuuuh yeah no
if it could be used infinitely it would be great to just put one on top of a boat
they are potentially useful for force projection if you can pump enough power in them, but that's the whole issue. Even YAL-1 has quite limited firing
blinding weapons do not require high power, and space weapons are a whole different consideration
lasers are yet far too low power to be military relevant
high power laser development has been pressured more by things like the NIF than military
the ability to have a perfectly straight line as far as you want?
hell, *construction in general* makes lasers an inevitability
the applicatoins of lasers are *immense*
maglevs, laser engraving, laser cutting for manufacturing, laser rust cleaning, laser communications
if it was purely civilian development, it's far more likely there would be more caution, maybe one *minor* criticality event that they learned from more quickly, and then much more stable development and overall a much more *positive* public impression of nuclear safety
I have to disagree with this point that it's likely there were so many criticality incidents *because* of the development pressure of war
there's no need to depend on industry to take an interest or the military to want more resources
and it works
but yes, the human genome project kinda proves that even if you suppose it is "war" that drives development to viability, we can kinda just ... *choose* to declare war on lack of knowledge, or arbitrary concepts
it feels ironic but true
(also a cause of early starvation as they had plenty of resources they wanted to trade for grain or harvesting machinery but the US put sanctions to prevent it, so they were in a catch-22 situation trying to feed themselves)
and also did not have the capital (ironically) to apply to research because of trade refusal
this is more of a big question mark that you can't really predict whether capitalism would be more or less ingrained without WW2, but there's a strong argument it would be less
they were largely gutted by the distraction
communism movements had *power* before WW2
not necessarily
lack of attempting to diversify is a flaw of capitalism rather than a requirement of innovation in general
it was dismissed on allied side for being too untested
and in particular if the nazis hadn't had such a wunder weapon obsession, the military *wouldn't* have developed jet engines
it only got snapped up by military because war forced a military focus
Yes, because without WW2 it is likely that industry would have taken the jet concept instead
Pre WW2 there was already airline competition to be the first to new locations or the fastest on existing routes
inconel was made for jets and predates high power rockets
they both need the high temperature strength
Most of the metallurgy development for rockets was already done by jet engines
military and industry are good at developing a technology to viability, but it's actually pretty rare that they come up with one originally
but on the earlier point of military vs institution vs industry research: institution does a *lot* that the other two take credit for. Lasers were university research. First viable helicopter was developed at a german university by a guy who wanted to use it to launch a rocket from altitude. Jet engine was a degree thesis from Cranwell university. Computer networking, until WWW made it accessible enough for industry, was almost all pushed by universities trying to share research. Rocket engine was university driven
no chance to filter it in time and super easy to burn out
Depending on the sat and purpose not necessarily. Against lasers some sats could potentially be protected - but spy sats would be absolutely *fucked* if a high power laser ever got the chance to aim straight up the optics
since they kinda aren't designed to be attacked, currently
satellites are very vulnerable
if you could boost it towards being a gigawatt class weapon even hardened targets fall pretty quickly though, so it could potentially be developed to intercept in-flight projectiles
and is not a 1 cm optic
this is a megawatt class laser
air is fine until about 1 GW/cm^3 at sea level
a laser doesn't need to be in enemy airspace
which I suspect you'll find ...
but besides which that doesn't really disprove anything; only moves the question to what the odds are with strangers
the argument isn't rapes it's behaviours in general
that's an attitude that lets people keep freely being assholes when there's clear causes for the behaviour which can be corrected
and it's not misrepresenting to make the situation worse, as racists are wont to do
It's not it's just flat-out accurate
and men are more exposed to and more encouraged to be such
masculinity and machoism encourages shitty behaviours, yes
it's still a valid point because keeping it that general "men" *is* a category that makes shitty behaviour more likely. Racists using it is false rhetoric because immigrants are *less* likely (by about half) to break the law
question is always "is this more common than it would have been anyway"
blood clots are common with basically anything
the country as a whole may be poorer but immigration is automatically selecting above the median
the point is to immigrate legally does require a fair minimum amount of wealth to make it happen
though at least one of those articles above finds the same low crime rate for illegal, so
but equally among (legal) immigrants the wealth floor is likely to be much higher than people who were born there
particularly in the EU most will just go unnoticed
the average person who's obviously migrant
it's harder to migrate somewhere than just suck it up and deal with your own place
but these are factors everywhere also
hence would be totally unsurprised
probably the only places you'd struggle to find this pattern are places with exceptionally low crime rates to begin with, but that's only a guess and I'd be totally unsurprised by it repeating in japan too
english-language is hard to find for non-english-speaking countries so it's mildly limited but it's consistently found all over the world

if there's any causation here it's causing an improvement in blood health
and vaccination selection means it's people more likely to have issues getting it
the rate is *lower* than expected for complete randoms
"So far across the  EU and UK, there have been 15 events of DVT and 22 events of pulmonary embolism reported among those given the vaccine, based on the number of cases the Company has received as of 8 March. This is much lower than would be expected to occur naturally in a general population of this size and is similar across other licensed COVID-19 vaccines. The monthly safety report will be made public on the European Medicines Agency website in the following week, in line with exceptional transparency measures for COVID-19."
any percent means having to order more of alternates and denying that supply to other places
aus could justify pausing deliveries of AZ (but not using current doses is a waste) with the low infection rates, but it makes no sense for europe

#italy
imagine if nationalisation becomes accepted again and italy's just like "okay so the govt's just gonna buy out the railways, so I'll pay you *this* which you then give to my friend here and he gives back to me and we're all done"
they shouldn't need corporate welfare when they're not paying most wages and everyone has money to buy things
vast majority of tax income is VAT and high-earner income tax, which are unaffected (VAT increased) by giving everyone minimum wage direct from govt
most tax income is *not* from the wage earned by people UBI would affect
taxes don't disappear with UBI
can you give examples where it has not
you say this but UBI has been tried and is successful
the thing that stops them is others not and therefore they lose business
UBI is everyone gets x money and minimum wage goes away
UBI is not x money if you have 0
sounds dum
who then get taxed by the countries so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
so countries are in debt to people
bonds are generally taken out by the rich
you just increase tax on the high brackets and pull it (and loads of their income) back in
not true as most UBI proposals save significant costs by not considering brackets at all, there's no need to work out who can receive it
MMP kinda assumes it doesn't because money is made up
and this even assumes that your govt even acknowledges debt from money printing as a thing
and you'd do it while boosting other taxes
to take UK as example, what's already paid just for the NHS, which isn't even a plurality of UK tax expenditure, could pay for everyone to have nearly £2000
sure they can
was still full of rich people then
US used to have 90% top tax rate
historical evidence says no
there wasn't immediate fleeing
taxes used to be crazy-high everywhere
because they like the country and the convenience provided by living there
so company pays less
the total received wage would increase, yes, but govt is paying most of it for most people
need to exceed 100 km/h at least once before it can be used
F1 forbids use of the electric motor off the starting line because it would be too easy to provide perfect torque and remove skill
rather than specialist race car regs
they still need to be street cars meeting the street regs
since they still *have* to be street registered I imagine not much would actually change
don't rally cars already have to be unmodified though?
but ideally they should be transported by something else 100% of the time
they have limited milage allowance just in case
showcars the whole point is to kinda not drive them
either because of better engines being used, or just because of lightening
so that comparison doesn't quite work
the exact same car, driven at race speed, is going to use more fuel
~~but without horse racing we don't get them adapted as cute anime girls years later~~
the regs as specified will often not make sense for them. F1 cars would be very efficient if they had to perform standard car efficiency tests that are based on "normal" driving
like how F1 has fuel use limits
I mean I'd say so long as racing persists it shouldn't have to follow the same regulations as street cars, because they don't necessarily make any sense at all for racing, but they can be kept to different regulations
automotive ones are limited by what's actually useful since they can freely be direct-drive or minimal gearing
spa highly variable because it's very sensitive to whether high downforce for the technical sections or low downforce for the fast ones is more favourable
depending on the conditions sometimes spa hits comparable top speeds into the bus stop
it has fast corners and few of them
it doesn't actually have the longest straights
yes? Monza has the fastest average speed
and cooling
also engine power
nascar just sustain a higher average which is *less* stressful on the car
F1 car faster
average lap speed is a property of the track, not the car. Nascar's peak speed was 228 mph, while bottas did 231 in the 2016 mexican gp
also no nascar is about the same as f1 at the fastest tracks
there's a point where they're allowed more fuel flow but no-one uses it because then you are running inefficient
I thought it's that 15k is the limit for normal fuel flow?
and I think their final drive in top gear is about 1:1
18k rpm is the current f1 limit though most float around 15k
complete non-contact fully rotating drive
I think 150krpm is the exclusive realm of electric motors and turbines
that's just straight motor output
getting them to mesh properly at that speed is <:HibikiShock:726645026725167114>
yeah you don't get 150000 rpm gearing
batteries less so
electric motors are also excellent at sustained high-power
focus on the fact you'll be getting out of this
but you know your current one is bad
it's understandable to be concerned since you don't know what situation you'll end up in
are they doing a lot though?

said violent protest being in response to a law that would make peaceful protest illegal
so a bunch of media outlets are reporting negatively on a violent protest in bristol tonight
yeah no you definitely have influence, I'm just not really as aggressive about "it's always bad" because if you're a semi-public figure it's going to be hard to find people to get involved with where that fact *doesn't* influence stuff
I'm only peripherally aware of them anyway so statements and guilt don't really matter to me, but yeah, at least get a statement
you unfortunately can't expect anyone in the public eye to *never* be involved with fans because that's likely to restrict their dating pool to only haters, which ... isn't really gonna work
so like, same on the can't be shocked part, but also this kinda doesn't jump out as immediately that bad, at least without having reviewed the evidence? Like it'd be one thing if he was cheating on a partner to do it, but single people with fans who are of age is kinda likely to have stuff happen. And it's clearly shitty of him to just ghost her after getting what he wanted, but then that's also still only one side of the story (maybe she went crazy obsessive after "winning")
I mean, the claim being put forth with that particular screenshot (I'm not gonna look any further) *isn't* paedophilia, as she's of legal age at the time, and the description doesn't immediately suggest grooming (though also doesn't immediately dismiss it)
but yeah it's a whole stack of stuff that doesn't add up: the pattern is wrong, and it doesn't forgive even if it was
if someone's saying consistently racist stuff as a tourettes tick they're probably racist, for instance
there's a few aspects to it. It's not coherently in the flow, but it is something that would pop into your mind (though not in a necessarily positive or negative sense, just a pervasive thought)
(relatedly, one of the funniest mental images I've ever had)
someone I peripherally know who *actually* has tourettes once shouted "SANTA'S A CATBOY!" while queueing in aldi
it's just automatically saying intrusive thoughts
besides which, tourettes isn't just swearing
and you think english speakers don't swear easily?
idk what that means
nevermind that it still makes you say things you're actually thinking for the most part
I'm pretty sure people with tourettes can't control it so if that was even slightly true he'd be swearing in public too

also, as depressing as it is I want to say: Peak capitalism *so far*
with minimums defined by how much wanton destruction was caused in its creation
"I can has little a scam, as a treat?"
https://twitter.com/BRKeogh/status/1370356988169744388
it's a scam that consumes more energy than entire heavy industries
because it's literally the worst
I don't know that coke actually is that dangerous? And with how expensive it is only millionaires and up can afford it so let's use it as a wealth tax
lots are classified dangerous while being less than alcohol
though it depends what you call "dangerous" drug
evidence suggests not
and *from there* prove what they have
if it's taxed then you can immediately hit them for tax evasion and get access to their finances
if it's just illegal but not taxed then things not adding up doesn't give as much to go on because you need to prove that they own the illegal thing to make this not add up
because things don't add up
the point of there being a tax is taxes are easier to enforce even when hidden
any tax will encourage hiding
though severe tax is probably better than illegal as illegal encourages more hiding
hopefully
but all EU projects could just be given the green light automatically and have an approval process with ECB for national
the only issue I see with applying this to europe is the large disparity and non-centralised management meaning small parts could go rogue and do stupid stuff with the ability to freely print money
are they even allowed to print money?
doesn't italy use the euro?
I mean japan's doing this while having free trade agreements with EU and UK
nor do they need to to even fund all their potential govt projects
I would expect that over-printing still could, but pretty much no large country govt is printing nearly enough to significantly affect the total amount of their currency circulating
I mean that's kind of the point. it's designed around capitalism, and validating it fundamentally makes a shift away harder
it is fundamentally bad
even if every single technical or ecological issue was solved
it fundamentally encourages wealth disparity and poverty
and even beyond the environmental impacts, simply accepting this form of currency as being in any way *acceptable* is setting out that capitalism is correct. All forms of crypto are designed so that the rich get richer as a fundamental rule, whether proof of work, proof of stake, proof of storage, or whatever the other two were
it's still demanding that so much be done to serve creation of what is fundamentally nothing
building more green energy solves nothing ultimately
cancer is only promoted so much as a thing to fund because the treatment is still really expensive so they can still make huge profit
I mean it's known that good cures literally don't make much money
the high value trading scene is entirely about it
the creation of it is not for money laundering
just a little bit of scam

huh, the ship that lost 36 damaged containers earlier in the year was also an evergreen ship, though not a sister ship
I'm not calling it immediately wrong, just saying that it's also somewhat dubious
and the ships before and behind it were not notably affected despite being more moderately sized containerships
that part's questionable as above a certain size (specifically, large enough to catch the wind above the banks at all) larger ships will be less affected - square cube law, they have more area but *way* more mass to resist it
it almost did get stuck again, based on that wind
only one end of it
no

it appears to be under way now though, vessel finder reporting in roughly the middle of the canal at 4 knots
just only one end of it

*let people enjoy things*. to both groups, don't get so invested in something that you start dictating how someone else enjoys it (so long as it's not, like, illegal somehow) and don't tell someone they can't be a fan of something that they feel is important to them
and I've seen it from plenty of miserable people who use it more as "hah? you like things? I'm clearly better than you for *not* liking things"
while there's a point to the tweet "maybe massive overinvestment in one thing is bad?" is a positively frigid take

jails in general are terrible because for most reform is possible but they're not even trying
lank, I would view that more as an argument for improving the healthcare system than to not do this
we're talking about people who are literally trying to make a defense out of claiming that they are not safe to exist around
my point was not "we should start doing this again" because we do do this where appropriate; my point was if someone is seriously trying to argue they have so little control of themselves they should really be considered for involuntary commitment
we have interventions where possible but some people cannot be left to just roam around
uuuh these are still a thing y'know
the insanity defense is a real thing but does not get you put back on the street
this is not "let's put autistic people in jail" it's "there's a literal fucking psychopath here who has attacked/raped/killed someone and does not show any indication they know why it's wrong"

why would the ATAGI have any better data than two institutions that have *way* more samples to work from
it's not gone away because the media doesn't have anything else to latch onto and this is ripe for paranoia
if you're getting almost exactly as many as expected that remains "possible link" until a lot more research is done because sampling bias can go either way, either people are paranoid and they report everything possible so all of them are caught, or it some might be unreported and it might be like a 50% increase in risk (for reference, birth control increases clotting risk *significantly* more than this)
the group most affected as recorded so far, women under 60, is also one of the highest risk groups for clots to begin with when controlling only those two factors
MHRA has that about four people in a million would expect to get this *specific kind* of clot in a control group and lo and behold they have 1 less than 4 per every million doses
most recent announcement by EMA, the ones most against it, are still only "possible risk"
they're always very specific that there only *might* be a link
... No, if you read the actual studies they're *not* saying they've ruled out other possibilities
they were doing that anyway
with how rare these clots are that's exceedingly unlikely, particularly since pre-existing conditions means there's a big ? on whether these people would've been more likely than their age bracket to get them anyway
and covid has people sedentary increasing the risk of clots in the first place
I don't know about age group control but the expected rate of population as a whole would be about 1 per day per million
there still hasn't been any risk demonstrated the number of cases is *lower* than expected for a control sample
the age of majority in NC is 18 so regardless of how little you care for rights of a child that's outright against human rights

You're absolutely correct, the investors who provide them money for most housing projects don't want too many because they also own and rent out most of them, so they want the housing value super-high

rome fell because they didn't do infrastructure maintenance and so the overcrowded city built up to the point of collapse and rebellion

also, may melt the pot or tray it's in
unless you put it on self-clean but ovens with that feature will lock themselves shut and you don't really get a choice about your food being incinerated if you accidentally put it in that
but if that happened and there was an ignition it would've already exploded
the only way it would be dangerous would be if you just put like, a massive bowl of flour in there and it somehow aerosolised
use the oven to give you time to find all the things to do that
the oven keeps it temporarily under control but it's not completely sealed so you do want to get the fire put out
it will flare up with fresh air but it'll burn for a while in an oven
leave it closed, find a towel or something else to cover it, then open it quickly but calmly and smother it with the towel
nevermind that temp plates are in several states stickered to the inside of the window so a car with factory tinted windows becomes very hard to see
this apparently makes it a "high risk" stop that justifies ignoring legally required protocol
apparently the only justification the police are giving is that they were stopping him for not having/being unable to see temp plates and tinted windows
good for him

yeah you are dude. You don't have to comply with unlawful orders, even military officers don't
instead he's sitting there asking what's going on and why they're stopping him 'cause he knows he's not done anything and is no threat
if he was actually dangerous, why have neither of them blocked his car escape. someone who needs this level of threat would just slam the accelerator and get out of there
notably they're muted while in the car to hide how minor or incorrect this stop is
it's also linked in the first reply
okay so he's actively doing so little that they can walk up to him and unlock his door, past his hands, pepper spray him twice while he doesn't even move his hands, for him not complying with what I believe is an illegal order as you are legally allowed to know why you're being detained

in some states IIRC they don't actually have to find you actually arrestable to do some level of theft
even in non-physically-violent interactions they have reason to try find you guilty-enough of something
also while only tangential, civil asset forfeiture
qualified immunity is a big one though, police are innocent until it's too public to bury the guilt
names are more common for precedents or lawsuits that result in a law change
it gave them more power but idk about worse given how common lynchings were
they joined in with the KKK happily
eh it happened without that
before police was more informal town guard systems which were replaced because they were supposedly ineffectual, but seeing more obviously how police are now I have come to wonder if they were actually ineffectual, or if when they saw massive industrial lots have just the occasional pocketing they were like "eh, company will be fine"

they might if anything have done a *better* job protecting random citizens than police that replaced them
in theory a police force can be not for that. but all the modern ones are created by the establishment to protect the establishment so yeah they're for that

it could be improved with better reporting fairness laws, but it'll fundamentally be limited in how investigative it can be, how much it can actually dig into things
newspapers having a monopoly on widely-seen advertising made bank for them
internet advertising wrecked the industry. They're suddenly not the only ones able to send ads out everywhere and it can be done for almost nothing, so profit margins drop with the absolute cost too. Thus there's no ability to fund proper journalism on razor-thin margins
buzzfeed almost had something good before they got gutted. Lots of trash articles to generate easy money, which they used to fund what was some of the best legit journalism at the time
journalism really needs to figure out how to fund itself sensibly
black community is a thing, black people will know many more other black people than a white person would. And if the character is meant to be carribbean, that's a legit criticism

US true though there's also obvious reasons for it
arguably  that makes china's numbers worse though as half their population is still in the preindustrial boonies so all their pollution is made by half the people
but poland is worse for overall air quality because denser and because of non-CO2 pollutants from just fuckin burning coal in every house
I think that might depend on how you're measuring it, I think aus, us, sa and can are worse for CO2 because of agriculture and industry
not the concept, the company

depends. a scale of % where the full range is relevant (ie; theoretically achievable) should go 0-100
it does make it look like they've stolen it all in the past 5 years instead of just obtaining another 5% of it
I'd say note the vertical scale but tbh if you scale out both that and the timeline it's the same graph
unless you go full hunter gatherer you're almost certainly better off in a regular, properly-maintained house than OTG
many people going "off the grid" actually increase their footprint by their dependence on inefficient supplies like gas/fuel heating with poor insulation
> implying we hold rich white people to a standard
nuclear is a better energy source than renewable (less toxic waste)
biofuel is an inefficient use of land and should not be used to prop up transport that can easily switch to another energy source. It should absolutely be pushed, but reserve it for airlines, as airliners cannot be made electric, but turbines give barely a fraction of a shit about the fuel coming in as long as it will burn at all, so biofuel presents far less issues
though depends if they just mean literally or there's actually a minimum length requirement on shotguns
one of the only sensible legislations if so
it has so little other relevance
and making a sawn off should equally be considered an act of conspiracy to commit murder given that
pretty much it
to hide it so you can sneak it in somewhere it's not supposed to be and kill someone
shotguns at least need exceptions in places with dangerous wildlife, I'll grant. Sawn-off should be straight illegal though as should public carry
and just like attaching a silencer changes the weapon from a legal perspective any addition that makes a gun semi-auto should count exactly the same as a gun that was made semi-auto
assault weapon ban, revoke the idea of concealed carry. Assault weapon should also include all semiauto weapons
introduce the heavy ones on a national level
many of the assault weapon bans in the US have had teeth, they're just meaningless when the place that introduces them is always bordered by a red state that goes "fuck you murica gun go brrrrrrrrrrrr"
... this overflow from another channel?
nah
usm guns are not the civilian ones anyway
not on the black market, which can command similarly high prices due to competition
but no-one wants to fuck with them
they cost like 10x as much
they're far more profitable here
and most of them are now in police custody
in the UK they're tracking like 17 illegal guns that have ever been fired in the whole country
it pretty much only exists in america
no the black market is culled pretty heavily by legislation because if someone has an unregistered gun they're much less willing to risk it vs if it's easy to replace
it is but that'll be even harder to pass
I'd ban pistols outright ideally but limiting it to single-action does vastly reduce the practicality while still giving some allowance for this stupid gun culture to have a shiny bangstick to show off
which is ironic considering it's got few nutrients that should form weird stuff that would make it worse; it's bad for animals, people, and engines
yeah corn gets used but it's a bad option for it from what I've read, doesn't convert efficiently
various plants, which means we can infer also any insectisides and fertilizer that was used on them
even if the emissions are carbon neutral it's a concern
which is another reason for biofuels to be pursued, but only for vehicles that absolutely cannot go electric. Minimise emissions 'cause we don't know what vaporising whatever got into the biofuel is gonna do
more cars in cities
can also point to leaded gasoline and the potential that it might've had some permanent effects
cities are spensive to live in so people who start struggling need to go extreme
the factors that raise the crime rate in cities are complex but obvious ones to point to are A) level of opportunity (which is raised for guns by them being around), B) increased poverty through the raised poverty line
just into drug dealing so they can put them away for more time
well also the system is designed to push people into crime, but generally not into homicide crime
there's a lot of people but it's physically enormous too
LA's huge and sparse
the anomaly is the gun ownership
no matter how you cut this cake, america should be less by population statistics
with the exception of basically just NY, american cities are less dense than european
yet US guns are so prevalent that it completely overwhelms this factor
if anything an appeal to population says the US should be lower because it's less dense than europe so there's less people living in close proximity, which is one of the big factors that correlates with crime in general
that's *per*
... no it's not
that's poor writing
oh right it switches forbidden/allowed in the middle of the passage
... so carrying a knife is *legal* on school grounds? What?
*unless* it is directly relevant to your job, you're not taking it elsewhere, and it's properly boxed away/otherwise protected
very definitely not legal in the UK

that's what it already did
assault weapon is defined by whatever law in question so the fact it doesn't have a clear definition in common parlance is irrelevant
I knew someone with a chainsaw license, which is like the closest thing

keep them secure and then when they're finished with, destroy them
the non-highlighted part is very "wow, you guys really must have a lot of oedipus going in to project this hard, huh"
doubts are understandable even for people who later realise it's 100% what they wanted
or in negatives, if you *don't* want to look masculine?
does it do anything if you consider in a more general sense, and think about whether you'd want a more feminine figure?
in what way?
I mean it does also mean there's more in more places
the concept being that you design the reactor so small that refuelling becomes an irrelevant question, once a fuel's below usability you just replace the whole reactor and take the original back for refurbishing at a specialised facility, which means only one place needs to have all the special protections for handling exposed material
it does make sense since one of the big things that makes france's nuclear extra-cheap is the fact they're all identical so became really easy to put up
rolls-royce are also pursuing the small modular reactor concept
though it's used very differently there
I mean it's only got a very open trade deal but Japan didn't get disqualified for that
a few will move, most will just give up and try something else
crypto ban also won't cause a mass flee
the rich fleeing doesn't actually happen
There's the general history of when things get more expensive to the rich
history says that most people don't actually bother migrating that much
which is why there's so little progress on renewable or indefinite power like nuclear
nah capitalists don't care about costs, they care about profit. And it's hard to cut cost but easy to increase profit by exploiting more or just doubling how much you do
also none of that's needed still because you just make it illegal to host any of the software involved in a cyptocurrency. Servers, exchanges, wallets, all illegal
they don't care about saving costs if it would cost them to move and they can just keep profiting where they are
else it would not be using more energy than all renewables make worldwide
most crypto has not bothered attempting to be renewable
and then because the log is permanent they tracked down everyone involved
many people have been busted because one guy somewhere in the exchange once asked for donations to an account that has exchanged money with their own account they used to buy drugs
the dark web would be kind of stupid to still be using it anyway because it's even more trackable than notes
but even without that, if it's not got general public investment pushing the value up, it becomes useless to the dark web because their investment is gone
make it illegal to host
also, that
it only has value because of its general attractiveness
it will be worthless to them if it's banned
a single transaction releases kilograms of CO2
no it will be terrible no matter how it's regulated
and yes, both wasting more power than all renewables worldwide to accomplish nothing
it can be funged but it destroys its nature as an NFT. Just like if you traded a limited-edition coin for its technically equivalent value in non-limited-edition currency
no NFT is an exclusive collectable version of a cryptocurrency coin
they'd possibly get away with it under an argument that it isn't actually the art, but in that case the value should collapse anyway as it's confirming you own nothing
(to be clear the EU legislation overrides things like copyright protection if it's necessary to keep it usable)
wild
I was going to mention that in the EU there's legislation that expressly permits modification to keep purchased software or hardware working if the manufacturer fails to maintain it as a contrast, but then I clicked it and see that it's severe enough that changing your harddrive counts?

also true

"yes, everyone wants to fuck their mother and this is normal. Definitely not a developmental disorder despite it being a known phenomenon that the majority can't feel sexual attraction to basically anyone they knew in about the first six years of their life"
the hosting providers will not touch the software with a million-foot pole if it could cost them big time
also power for individuals yes but I'm focussing on taking down the whole network
get the big business hosting providers, who *aren't* profiting off it, to help you
it's only so powerful right now because there's no penalty to running those
crypto is highly dependent on the hash servers and interchanges to maintain it. Ban those and much of it will collapse instantly
you can't tax evade if the tax evasion network goes down
you aren't just sanctioning the evasion here. You also sanction those hosting the software that enables it
absolute nonsense
you want to encourage people to come out about it while also trying to discourage them from using it
it's specifically a cost designed to discourage use
how do you do that while also taxing it
and if you bring in penalties for hosting providers for hosting them, even unknowingly, shit's gonna crack down fast
you don't need all copies to be gone instantly, just to not be in use
yes it is. while digital things matter, they absolutely are different to physical things, in that they can be replicated and removed trivially
software can just poof
physical things need actual removal or destruction
many places
you can just ... press delete
crypto is not a physical thing it does not need a cultural change for people to let go of the physical thing
"anyone found hosting any software related to this, knowingly or otherwise, or making others host for them, gets jail time"
sure it is
<:kasuko_point:753597452111708201>
and unlike prohibition of alcohol or drugs there's not that much innate attractiveness to the pyramid scheme; people want to intoxicate because it's fun, people want pyramid scheme because money. Jail is much more worth the risk for fun than risky money
if it's just outright illegal, harder to make that argument
the same argument applies with just attempting to tax it except they get to keep pushing for minimising this tax
US has rejoined them now and is pushing harder to meet them, though yes not hard enough but that's a general neoliberal issue
especailly as it doesn't bring them any profit
they won't if it breaks things like their goal of meeting the climate accords
now canada just needs to ban them, and all other major powers, until no-where's left that could support them
the goal is a reduction in crypto
part of them still means a reduction in crypto
no I get the point I just completely disagree with it. Governments do frequently act unilaterally and crypto is too destructive to leave it to try collapse under the pressure of taxes
this is such a clear case we have to just say fuck how we normally do things, you're obviously scum if you endorse this stuff
only because we refuse to try
also you can just state the reason why as you ban it. "A single cryptocurrency accounts for more energy use than all solar power worldwide produces. There are more than one cryptocurrencies with comparable use. This is obviously terrible, we're banning all of it"
if you don't know about it, that's the point
whatever the last one was
blacker than rolling coal
those coins can vanish even if doge is the only one that's basically irrelevant
and if I ever find it again I'm deleting it
hell for a few days back when it was first a thing I mined some dogecoin and fuck me for thinking that was in any way a good idea, I'm glad I've lost that wallet
they're literally killing people by keeping climate change going far beyond where it should be
we don't give a fuck if there's any incidentals
cypher maybe you just don't realise how hard we're on the "fuck anyone who uses crypto" train
and they'll all drop that instantly and disinvest if it's illegal
seriously you consistently manage to try argue the one thing that's the whole point it can't happen
the whole point is that a corporation can't hide their tracks of purchasing en-masse a ridiculous amount of specialist computer hardware so they all get shut down
but we don't need to really care about individuals, like I say. Make it illegal for them too, but we can figure out how to catch them later. It just needs to be illegal in the first place and make it so that no large business wants to touch it
as they're generally outcompeting for hashes
it would be less rare for individuals without those people
without them the currency has far less value
we're talking about tracking down the people building massive farms
we're not talking about one guy who snagged a bunch of graphics cards and runs it in his basement
also we really don't give a fuck about individuals anyway

I don't know how the toy works but presumably they've done something to streamline it somehow, like automatic wifi connection

given that cravings are a thing anything trying to correlate nutrient intake with results needs to do a hell of a job to prove it's not the person taking more of it in response to a bodily need rather than the nutrient causing the need
at that ratio he's barely high, even
because he had 11 ng/ml, average person is about 6 l, so 66 ug. LD50 for an average person is debated to be around 2000-3000 ug

it's not aimed, but it's malicious because you know this will be the result
malicious manslaughter is ex. some dick taking most of the bolts out of a service ladder so it falls when someone tries to climb it
3rd is malicious, not intent to kill, *but* aimed
mainly around whether it's malicious or incompetence
depends on the jurisdiction but manslaughter is not third degree murder and has its own degrees
but yes also for someone using the wrong weapon, in theory
*normally* it's intended for creating dangerous situations and then leaving them to be found, like hidden falls or machinery in a place it could crush someone
ex. leaving heavy machinery in a dangerous state and someone gets crushed because you'd fix it in the morning

It creates a pressure to decide one way or another even if the jury is already leaning in that direction
it is highly unfair that they pressure out people who are aware of jury nullification though
the founders mostly just wanted to keep their money to themselves, though, since they were rich white guys

there was a lot of delaying trying to find an unbiased jury too

while it would be good to have less restrictions in general that's far less silly than "we have actively made too much of a thing / only one place can use this thing and we can't send it to them"
there's always some law preventing export when it would be good, whether it be excess food to poorer countries, nuclear waste to france, or vaccines to anywhere

yes I specifically mentioned the interlinks
this ending up being why inner city gets lit up and suburbs are out of power because of course the inner city got maintained, those come back on, then they find that after all the suburbs failed they have enough power to not roll any more
most of the power cut off, unable to draw enough from the rest of the country because of outdated interlinks, rolling blackouts converting into permanent blackouts because old substations turn off and then just ... don't turn back on, because they've not been maintained in decades and only work because they've never been turned *off* at any point

yes
a review is ~~probably~~ definitely needed but not one funded by *them*
this guy also pretends that no transport or energy emissions are *precisely for* food, which is what most people are considering when they give huge numbers for emissions
the irony is the single largest producer is china coal, producing 14% on its own.
yes india has more but are they smaller cows? Producing less pollutant? Treated better? Feeding three-five times the population?
comparing US cows to india ... is also iffy as hell 'cause US (and many EU) cows are selectively bred to be *chonkers* and produce huge amounts of milk
reducing to zero doesn't make sense because yes we could simply put these animals only on grazing land, yes, so balance is the good choice
<a:HibikiPowerDab:688190074219003996>
rice and rice!
appeal to "it's all in developing countries" is also false because huge amounts of developing country agriculture is done to sell to the first world because it's one of the easier things they *can* actually compete with us in
we choose not to eat them because it's easy to just dump it on cattle, you don't need to figure out a way to make it attractive to humans
and the edible vs inedible ratios are misleading because yes, most is "inedible", but a lot more *could* be used for edible if meat weren't so profitable, and so inedible stuff is grown by *choice*, and much "inedible" stuff *could* be edible under different standards
The land comparisons are also inaccurate as the raw area comparison doesn't tell you how much *more* grows in the crop land than grazing land, and how *huge* amounts of that are used for animal feed for the animals this video is trying to defend by saying they *can* survive on the grazing land.

That argument doesn't work if *they could but don't because we consume too much*
(not to mention rice being an exceptionally water-demanding plant anyway even before you notice it only being grown in places that can support it)
*and* then don't contaminate the water with urea when done with it
it's also dishonest as hell to compare beef, widely consumed in arid countries, for its water use to rice. Which is specifically grown in extremely wet countries *and* in fields what are optimised to hold water as well as possible
since beef consumption is massively biased to the US applying it worldwide wouldn't scale up the GHG emissions nearly as much, but it would still increase above 2.6%
and US population is only 4% of the world's
it would be easy to get that figure if considering worldwide emissions rather than US, which I can't prove he did but nothing he states or shown in the video indicates he *didn't*
making an equivalence between beef and almonds is irrelevant since one is treated as a staple food and the other is not
the *quantity*'s relevance is questionable but quantifying what an amount of water meant was always going to be, the fact the relative quantity is way higher is still bad
claiming rain water doesn't count is just as disingenuous as this guy claiming it's disingenuous to say it does. It's all water use, rain water can be captured, water that's been through an animal is slowed down in the water cycle and less accessible, and you can use less per person still by eating the plant instead of the animal
Which aren't anywhere near most animal feed
or found a way to process them into edibility for humans
without cattle, they wouldn't be grown and would be replaced with something edible
those "wasted crops" *are intentionally grown because there are cattle to feed*
life solitary is arguably worse than death

in theory a bullet through the brain is far less suffering

bullets are cheap
it's way less reliable than you'd think and also really expensive because big pharma will even boost the price of poison
people do escape from prison
I would disagree for extreme cases like this; it's not retribution, it's preventing this person from being able to repeat it
what issue would you give?
because there are always people on the edge case, no matter where your edge is
the issue is what level do you consider airtight, how freely do you use it
the issue is not really these people no-one would really have an issue with a person like that - assuming absolutely airtight evidence - getting the death sentence
that same stat for the US is also over 90% and the lowest I'm aware of in the west is the UK with like 80-85%
99% is "if it gets to the point of a judge making a decision without being dropped, this is the odds of guilty". Japan drops over 60% of cases due to insufficient evidence
US's prosecution rate is over 60% and that's one of the lower ones in the west
the real prosecution rate is 37%, the 99% is quoting a different stat
I do not believe it can be after 1 week as they do still need to go through the legal processes confirming it and that they believe it is certain
while japanese prison is bad, their death row is way better than the US's, given there's basically no-one on it and they're basically all 100% certain mass murderers
that's a US thing, not everywhere with the death sentence

but make it specific it only happens with certain policy, otherwise they can just take the money and run
I mean, I'd still apply regular donation restrictions to it that already exist
at least for someone who's actually leftward again
that could work but they put him in so how fucking likely is that
but I doubt you'd be able to set up a trustworthy system for that
so have a system where money is specifically already in the pot waiting for a shift left and nothing else
like they've lost donors from the shift right but they're able to delude themselves that they'd come back with more of a shift
only way I think it *might* even be reversible would be like, if there was a system to give political donations *conditional on filling certain requirements*

the fact it needs to be at a specific location and you need to know who you're faking, and the fact we *generally* have enough polling stations (though it needs to be a national holiday) means it's *really* quite hard to voter fraud here. not that it's particularly common anywhere, except from incumbent fascist governments
I typically get asked even with poll card but I think they just do it out of habit and because this isn't a particularly busy polling station
including not have already sent in a postal vote
and every person you do has to not vote themselves
so if you want to do anyone else you need to find someone else in another district
and you then can't do anyone else in that polling district because they'll recognise you
and as is currently you could *only* voter fraud by: picking a *specific* other person, going to *their* polling station, giving *their* address details and DoB, for ... one vote

IDF are saying that the building held gaza military intelligence and they told the media outlets and private residents in the building to leave an hour before the attack
https://twitter.com/danpriceseattle/status/1392571782155030530?s=21
yes they should be welcoming them, and taking them to somewhere they can wait comfortably while figuring out if they're allowed to enter
"well organised" but their army was still dependent on horses because they couldn't organise enough supply vehicles
it just wasn't "WW2" then because only a few countries involved
if you're arguing that japan started the war before 1939 though it would be quite dishonest to not also mention that hitler started the invasions before 1937
I'm not sure the people receiving those missiles *can* disconnect
scaring journalists that choose to live in gaza already is gonna be hard
there doesn't have to have been any construction and not necessarily if it's been done over years by hand
it's possible but it's also actively likely that if hamas are being secretive they would use a fake company to cover up their command assets
can the landlord confirm exactly what every business in there did?
maybe they did at one point when that person worked there
<https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/israel-gaza-palestine-ap-jazeera-b1848095.html>
shocking, isn't it?
the articles I've read state that's a false rumour of twitter
and excavating more won't instantly collapse it, just make it dangerous over time
many high-rises have basements built just because the foundations go that deep anyway so it's "relatively cheap" to add the basement even if it would only be used for building services normally
and hamas would definitely know the optics of destroying this building and if they have the opportunity, absolutely make it a target
I think AP claim to be? It's not required for the profession in general, no
and it's definitely not in their personal interests to paint a target on their building
I think journalists are obligated *not* to mention stuff like that for impartiality? Even assuming it wasn't well-hidden?
aka the sensible way
that's almost an hour, probably an hour if they evacuate before tweeting
so 50 minutes between the first tweet, which is aware of the strike, and actual strike
yeah around 13:00
https://twitter.com/LinahAlsaafin/status/1393536323940716549
do we have a time for the strike?

and targeting an unoccupied building would not count unless I'm missing something, international courts would not have anything to say about this more than anything else israel does
a quick search indicates that journalists do not have any extra protections re: war crimes than civilians do. "war correspondents", which are different, have a little more but it mainly covers being granted prisoner of war protections if captured
now I'm not the most 100% familiar with the situation but I don't recall "equal" being hammas' goal, is it?

there are plenty of reformist leftists, gun opinions vary wildly
that ... is a bad comparison
very few are. like, anarcho-primitivism is easy, capitalism is easy because only the raw brutality of "give me all your money and kidneys" matters
but it's better at paying you for work than capitalism is, where the people in control are actively rewarded for avoiding doing exactly that
any of these big theories has many aspects to how it works
socialism for starters
capitalism is terrible at doing that

what happened to ours is treatable, just not really for that dog; he had spent at least two years in kennels because no-one wanted to adopt him and ended up basically neurotic, having to suffer through rehab would've been worse on him
our last dog was limping before he had to be put down because he'd burst a spinal disc (presumably) jumping out of the car, but in that case it was "would rather just lie down and go hungry instead of have to use that paw" levels of pain.

If he's still willing to use it a bit it's probably not that ^ severe, but if he isn't ... vet is highly recommended
limping like refusing to use that paw or just very awkward on it?

also, lol no. CNN's one of the least biased US news sources
There aren't hints. Occam's razor still points way in favour of coincidence than highly advanced lab allowing samples to leak
yeah if it is a lab leak, which is far from proven still, it's just something they gathered from the wild
evidence for a leak so far is nothing more than circumstancial
now, people saying there needs to be a proper investigation are correct, but that doesn't mean the evidence points to a leak
which is exactly what conspiracy theorists would claim about themselves to try seem more legit. Looking elsewhere at what news there is https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/25/politics/wuhan-lab-covid-origin-theory/index.html the only thing new is that some doctors at a coronavirus lab were hospitalised with illness in nov 2019.

There's nothing about what their symptoms were to indicate it would be covid, and people working in a high tech lab in china will probably skew more towards middle aged where they're unlikely to get a hospitalisation exposure from covid, particularly as they're going to actively try minimise it given where they work.

It is far more likely to either be coincidence with a normal flu/other illness going around, or something else in the lab that's far more severe, as this whole lab is not going to be dedicated to *one* viral strain that is, at the time, basically unremarkable.
not that I have anything to add either way, but the channel name and the thumbnail design instantly scream conspiracy theory
nono texas that's not what's meant by no license should let you carry a handgun
they definitely covered it up longer than they should've but it's not like taiwan found out about it weeks earlier and forced china to acknowledge it
taiwan wants to make it look like they pressured china into acknowledging it even exists but china was literally going "hey this is bad we're trying to control it now but just so you're aware" already
also if you look at the timeline taiwan started making noise about it the literal same day that china actually publicised that the virus was on the loose

also the cables are usually underground when it gets that local so barring freak earthquake or burst watermain there's usually no failure mode on the cables, just the easily accessible junction boxes

and wrt TR reboot sales falling off: the advertising budget has *also* fallen off
increasing is debatable when since TR's reboot UC's had precisely one actually new game and one collection rerelease, which did worse than the games originally did
only one uncharted has done better than the best tomb raider, at over twice anything else in the uncharted series, and tomb raider as a series has over twice the sales of uncharted

if you could breed miniature bamboo maybe that would be an interesting idea (I don't believe it's hollow while reasonably thin?)
to avoid other issues with getting wet you'd likely also need either a dense and expensive wood or to give it some kind of finish which makes it even slower
plastic and metal are extruded, which is cheap. Paper is rolled, also cheap. Wood would have to be drilled, which is slow and hard to put on a production line
wooden straw is interesting but a *lot* more expensive to make
climate change is still by far # 1
of the environmental problems we have, plastics probably shouldn't actually be put that high, long-term
also while it's definitely not the smartest long-term planning: single-use plastics are likely a very temporary problem. Given that they're organic chemicals, it's likely only a matter of time before some microbe evolves to eat it, and then we have a potentially bigger problem of being *unable* to use single-use plastics to preserve perishables

gut digestion is very much a cooperative thing though as bacteria can evolve much faster and can survive just fine by skimming off the top, meanwhile the human provides a nice safe environment for it to flourish without having to compete with so many wild varieties
lactase is actually human-produced not gut flora produced
why try encode complex processes in your own DNA when gut bacteria can do it for you much more rapidly
much of human digestion is from gut bacteria

so often they'll tout something like quadratic equation or trig as something you don't need but it's ridiculously often that something in those veins will come up, and being practiced with *all* of it is how you make sure that you're good with the bits you end up needing. Which you sure as shit don't know which that's going to be as a kid
it's an argument that only has any grounding with extremely narrow (incorrect) views about what kids learn about in school vs on the job site and which "matter"
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
but they'd be shit at learning new building skills that were never used by that company
sure if you had a kid in construction from a young age they'd learn how to just repeat what the people around them did earlier
(proper) school doesn't teach you "things" as people who espouse points like these claim, though that is a side benefit, but teaches you how to learn
there's not much point to changing it unless you're explicitly trying to state something but it's objectively wrong because palestine is a different country

As I said, being a good opportunity to teach that as a side-purpose does not make it the primary purpose. that does not need more than a few hours of teaching, it is not high school's purpose.
high school would be a good opportunity to also learn stuff like taxes but that's tangential to its theoretical purpose as a learning institution
That's the opposite of how it is. Early school is for teaching you the fundamentals required for you to be able to learn; numeracy, literacy, basic sciences, creative and sport skills. It's *later* school that's about learning how to learn for yourself so that you can kick off from there

Microsoft do still seem to let old keys upgrade if you go through the process now, they just don't actively advertise it. They claimed there was a limit to pressure people into doing it but now they'd still rather you upgrade than carry on
consider that a flac file is by definition lossless. The only thing that vinyl *can* have over that + studio quality audio equipment *is* flaws, which some may like the sound of. The only thing digital cannot replicate is *lost* data - if you have a lossless master, you can choose to lose some in the same way
objectively vinyl does not have better audio quality but some audiophiles may prefer the tones their analogue equipment produces and be too lazy to figure out what digital equipment replicates that
I would not expect a bodyguard service, who by definition are in direct service to the rich and powerful, to state anything that in any way goes against them. And it's not like the pinkerton history is relatively untaught like say continental europe's colonial history
it has nothing preventing it and plenty to attract those who are corrupt and push out those who are not
police are a system that is *designed* to be corrupt
it comes from copper which has the same origin as "to cop a feel" - it's grabbing/arresting someone
that's a backronym at best and absolutely not where it comes from
if there's zero, then yeah they'll grade 100%
*if they're trying to grade accurately. Which you can cause by making sure there's actually some oversight
nothing is as weak to corruption as non-oversighted police
they're pretty weak to it but police is designed to self-corrupt
no they're not
that doesn't make them good
military has more eyes on them so are less likely to have absolutely idiotic RoI, so are a significant improvement on US police
even if said stolen goods has a GPS tracker and they can lead you directly to a house full of stolen goods
see: literally anyone talking about how police did jack all to recover stolen goods
yes
You want to disagree with the factual history of police?
town guard was fine for that 'cause they were on a level with everyone else, so they'd ignore industrial thefts while protecting people's houses
it's nothing to do with protecting the average person
also the police are fundamentally not to protect you, the whole reason the first police force (rather than just a general town guard) was started was because shitty company owners were angry that their stuff kept getting stolen from the london docks and they didn't want to just pay the dockworkers fairly
I mean for ICE it's not even profit it's just trying to clear an image they know is in the shitter and still deserves to be there

that is definitely iffy
even if you think that you don't have to make a public statement
visiting multiple times is definitely an issue
someone who wants to find out what it's claiming but disagrees with it would have to appear there
I mean the shrine itself is kinda dubious, but just going there once doesn't imply anything
weird how that kinda differs from modern stereotypes but I suppose it makes sense if you consider discipline to be one of the major factors of strength
they still *tried* a number of similar techniques as canada with first nations
or how japan treated the natives of other islands like the ainu, even if some try say it's not genocide because significant numbers survived
someone in replies claiming "europeans invented race" uh nah when it's all they knew people would be pissy about the next tribe over because their eyes were slightly too large. Europeans became the worst about it by having the most influence but most definitely did not "invent race"
which ... doesn't jive
yeah, she tries to make a point about subconscious issues but then makes it a point about systemic
and she is personally conflating systemic with subconscious racism, which are not the same also
and she's then painting with a brush that the people who do good work presenting things correctly cannot avoid
hmm the issue is she's totally ignoring nuance. Like her talking about the use of "discovery" - yes, there are some that talk about that, but equally there are a lot who *specifically mention the violence*
because you can't stop that
doesn't work so much for white people who can do everything to help but will still get hit by this
no good apples works for cops because you have to actively choose to be a cop, and can stop it at any time
but that's also more an issue of japanese schooling in general
Japan does not generally dispute them; it's been apoligised for many times and the vast majority of textbooks teach it (though in outside studies it's criticised for being bland teaching, it is there)
it's not primarily a governmental issue, it would have to become a *massive* problem before the govt could justify interference
because yasukuni isn't just a random shrine it's considered one of the important ones
I mean, it would be pretty awful to say "people don't get a resting place" if your faith is all about that. But yasukuni's importance could definitely be downgraded
but yes she does have a LOT of other roles
I mean arknights is pretty popular it's probably not unnoticeable
at the moment it's one of the major shrines
even if it's just downgrade its importance within shinto
even though with how this keeps coming up they really should do something
that guy I am pretty sure was majorly misrepresenting it, people who support the shrine don't believe they were purified of crimes in life but that they didn't perform crimes in the first place. But the shrine is *not* super-widely supported in japan either, just japan doesn't want to make a big fuss about it
I'm not but I don't believe I'll change CCP companies. Support your local unions
but it's also clearly not something they were watching for
I mean my contract does have a general "gross misconduct" clause but it'd have to be more severe than this. Though also I'm not contracted by a CCP company
and if she didn't someone should tell her and it'd probably be worth making a counter statement
which makes me doubt that it is actually a contract violation like mel suggests, but also it's not that big of a deal to let her go and unless she somehow really didn't know it's definitely not a cool thing to have done
it's gonna be something like that

only a few have been talked about like that, mostly around abe's. Which, abe's pretty not cool, so fair enough; but there *have* been many others.
it's controversial within japan
it just doesn't affect most
that's how you make it significant for those affected

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Imperial-unit if you actually go through the list there's very few instances of 12 in imperial units. It's more common with time, what with 12 hours and 12 months
there's a *few* usages, not many. Mainly small units; inches, ounces
it's common in time and fractional measurements, but measurements going *up* from a base unit were very rarely 12
"all over the place" is significant exaggeration
in one or two areas it was maybe the system developed, but in overall terms it was extremely rare to use duodecimal for anything other than time
> Germanic languages have special words for 11 and 12, such as eleven and twelve in English. They come from Proto-Germanic *ainlif and *twalif (meaning, respectively one left and two left), suggesting a decimal rather than duodecimal origin.
you need to just say fuck em
people who resist change will resist any change
11 might not be but 21 is

black market is something about the chain of it getting to you was illegal - product itself might still be legal but it got smuggled in to dodge taxes

mining under the ground on earth has zero relevance to space mining
but unfortunately for him, not insta taken down

lol winrar
I have one from a humble bundle that I'd probably try if I had reasons
there's a *lot* of good options if you go non-free
mainly because it did the job and was free
a lot of people have made a lot of money from it but many people have also been stupid and not gotten out or gotten out at bad times, and everyone involved has destroyed our progress on renewables <:RosalieShrug:841307712759005256>
it is aimed at the japanese market where media in general is a lot more sexual, so NSFW is pretty much only explicit stuff
first two points are fine, third is extremely dubious. "not wanting to be involved with it" is very different to "opposed to it"

"only people as smart as a particularly poorly educated alpaca could ever agree with us"
I was here and did not comment
a contribution is not necessary for every conversation
now let's leave it at that
matt you pinged someone *five hours* after their last post, which was to drop it, and aria replied 20 minutes later.
I think in the UK it's much rarer, as much as tories are giving a select few terfs far too much power they're not common in the general pop
but then that's students
seen it many times and that's always all it is
UoM student's union replaced all their bathroom pairs with bigger, much nicer unisex bathrooms and the most it causes is people stepping in, looking back at the door when they see someone they don't expect, and going "oh, okay"
literally just label them yeah, that's also done at the gay cafe I went to at uni
that's probably the only reason it's so high
"electable"
probably
though yes starmer is just a tory who wants it for himself instead
terfs aren't actually particularly common it's just that tories listen to them
new cases doesn't mean it's near as deadly, note
hitler also claimed to be far left but when your "left" policies are "for the *right* kind of people" then those are right
anti-lgbt zones aren't a left policy
<:doubt:484139588089282580>
smh they're not even smart about being fascist
... you'd think if they're trying to propaganda-ise the media keeping the EU would be one of the worst options with it being pretty much all modern states
because minorities being harassed in the US is so par-for-the-course it hardly gets mentioned.
plus, three most recent entries on wiki's "sports riot" page (obviously incomplete though)
did you miss the whole kneeling for flag thing
better than covid as apparently the vast majority make a full recovery with treatment
yeah not surprising that it was a risk

parents don't understand how to manage the risk, and assume if some can go without then so can their kid - nevermind that many would think the same way and then there's too many unvaccinated
I mean brexit wasn't realistic but the tories were stupid enough
hopes and dreams
thing is article 50 is unilateral but like, also not immediate
anyone who wants to keep trading with the EU will

ok so can we get rid of them and replace them with real labour around someone who's actually left now
it's just the old men in charge who are causing these problems
from the phrasing of the twitter criticism they quote they're definitely translated japanese tweets, so the JP public agrees with you
https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/07/19/national/keigo-oyamada-olympics-resignation/
but news a few hours ago says he stepped down from the olympics role
quick check says it depends when and it would've been way too long ago at this point
that's all-gun-death rate not homicide rate
https://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/Japan/United-Kingdom/Crime
Japan actually has more gun murders than the UK, and also isn't quite absolutist; japan still has bears, and lots of dense wildnerness. The worst the UK has is badgers and foxes, so it's much easier to justify severe restrictions on weapons
someone who wants an excuse not to go on the family trip to america
probably someone thinking "heh heh heh terrorists r dum i bet they'll fall for this"
much as I don't know if this is the best way to address cases like "genuinely didn't know" I much prefer that *some* power for that exists with the judge, and that it applies to everyone, not just straight people. It just needs some way of ensuring it's applied minimally and appropriately
it's something that could definitely be used badly but there is also a *lot* of cases where you don't necessarily want a hammer of absolution to say "it must happen this way"
off the top of my head, it may be that the older person was unaware of the other's age, as there's definitely a few 14 year olds who look very 18
do keep in mind that it is not saying to *not* register just that the judge may find very rare cases where this could be left out
the margin allowed is too large, but if it's this way for cases with straight people it should be for LGBTQ too
this seems more like it's meant to allow the judge to allow romeo and juliet cases to not be registered than anything to go "what the fuck" about
annoyingly I can't find the article I've seen before about crime under-reporting in japan but it wouldn't provide further numbers so
alright, fair enough
... 0.25ish per million is the same as 0.02(5) per 100k though?
they definitely do because you can find the statistic, and a problem with taking all statistics at face value is massive under-reporting of all crime in japan. Homicide shooting is hard to cover up, but suicides and other forms of homicide are much easier
wiki stats indicate vast majority of UK numbers are suicides
"shooting" usually refers to one person against another

<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
short busses
but more capacity never helps because if people self-select out then they select in whenever more capacity becomes available, so you need to actually get a reduction that sticks
you usually fix traffic issues with like a 20% reduction as it's usually when it's just slightly over capacity, and people self-select out of traffic when it becomes more of a pain than just walking; so it's almost always just *slightly* over
this is unlikely to be true in china as its rural population is still in basically feudal era development; it's not just a contrast between rural and urban at the same level of development, it's a huge contrast in the actual level of development.

however yes per capita still ends up more relevant
also if it's too many stops in the city itself light rail is especially needed there. This rail line has a lot of stops but they're mostly out of the city, its first stop coming out of the city station is nearly at the ringroad. The area within that is served by trams (which it actually meets again at rochdale)
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
my train that takes at least like 15 minutes to even start going the right way
so you could stressfully drive the whole way, or have no stress and anime
also as lank points out even though 30 minutes is longer than it should take, that's perfect length of time to watch an episode of anime
pretty much the same as mine, though I think the line is probably longer due to the valleys it has to follow
single track railways should never be used for mass passenger transit
there's the problem
mine was a regional train
21 miles as the crow flies
my train to uni took 50 minutes for 21 miles and it had to go basically along a right angle to get there because hills were in the way
that's also a pretty bad train to take 30 mins for 12 km
and it's also a cul-de-sac technically so no reason for busses to ever come here
in a city it would definitely be smoothed out but this is a residential only street coming off a main road that has 0 change in direction to accomodate it
the problem being it would bottom out rather than be unable to fit the turn geometry though
I did the same for uni and then cycled at both ends. The only street a bus wouldn't be able to follow me on was the home residential street because that's literally one car wide, 90 degree turn up a 20ish degree slope
plenty of room then
nevermind that all two-lane-per-way roads with reduced traffic could be converted to one wide + cycle lane
for the record carbon dioxide is toxic in the same way as monoxide it just needs higher densities and cities are great at creating that with buildings blocking airflow
just selling them to someone else
LPG is also misleading you since it needs to be more processed and the bits that get processed out just get burned elsewhere, you're not avoiding the bits that burn uncleanly
I'll point out that Japan only uses single-lined tracks on private or tourist railways, all its significant lines are double-tracked. same in UK
the radiation released is still negligible, the point of the comparison to nuclear is to point out nuclear plants are entirely contained, and unless the grid is 100% brown coal a small amount of renewable mix means electric off the grid is more efficient
red is a tram with many that hits the population centres
smooth line is the train with like 4 stops
but yeah instead of a million stops on the train line the train should be taking major nodes and then some kind of light rail should be servicing the smaller areas the train goes through
so that's still bad but more manageable
does it at least duplicate for stations
busses are terrible for long-distance the reason they get run on routes like that is only for people to go between parts of it
I don't know why you're obsessed with helium-3 it's not actually a very interesting proposition
no other planet has yet had even a hundred-metre shaft dug to find subsurface resources
earth has accessible resources because we're willing to dig
moon won't kill everyone when there's an inevitable component failure 'cause they can all just hop in the return vehicle with only CO2 scrubbers for supplies and no-one dies
Carbon (C) would be required for the production of lunar steel, but it is present in lunar regolith in trace amounts (82 ppm[64]), contributed by the solar wind and micrometeorite impacts.[65]

Nitrogen (N) was measured from soil samples brought back to Earth, and it exists as trace amounts at less than 5 ppm.[66] It was found as isotopes 14N, 15N, and 16N.[66][67] Carbon and fixed nitrogen would be required for farming activities within a sealed biosphere.
Although current evidence suggests rare-earth elements are less abundant on the Moon than on Earth,[51] NASA views the mining of rare-earth minerals as a viable lunar resource[52] because they exhibit a wide range of industrially important optical, electrical, magnetic and catalytic properties.[1]
this is only from a few top elements so doesn't even look at a lot of minor ones that only exist in small % on earth anyway, but immediately I see titanium as a good structural material that's plentiful on the moon
carbon sure but carbon isn't essential in huge amounts, plenty of iron and silicon which are useful

moon is more viable than mars since it's close enough to actually handle emergencies. anything goes wrong on mars bye bye
you are on earth too, really
(and 500+ from lithium-hydrogen rockets but people don't like that idea for some reason)
you expect 320 seconds from a basic hydrocarbon rocket, 340-360 from a good one, and 400+ from hydrogen
it took a while to even find reference to this as a fuel because it's so unconsidered but no it does not, 280 seconds is barely impressive for hypergolics, it's far from one of the best we know
atmosphere is only about a 30% reduction. Mars has around 60% from distance alone
solar's getting weak by that distance so is not really favoured for anything more than small rovers or low power satellites
solar-thermal would likely be constructed on-site by a colony for new generation but what's brought along would be exclusively nuclear
https://xkcd.com/1162/
any mars mission would be very dependent on nuclear
also building much larger is very much against saving weight that space needs
hydrogen + oxygen is more energetic than carbon + oxygen you spend more energy releasing the oxygen than you get from burning natural gas
wind exists and would work in minimal generation but it would not support even minor industry
also no it's not good for wind energy the atmosphere is 1% as dense as earth's
mars doesn't have the oxygen to burn natural gas ...
ok mr bovine
they just have minimised sun
winter plants don't go without sun for over 100 days
if you're going photovoltaic it would be better to build it directly out of them, though at such scale solar-thermal would be better since it does not need rare materials, it can be constructed out of generic structural materials and only needs a working fluid of some type for the rare component
though by the time it reaches mars it would have diffused too much to actually be useful anyway unless you want to send it through a giant lasing medium, so you'd probably just have it be reflective and point it wherever moves it most usefully
better is to just accept the radiation pressure is there and manoeuvre it so the pressure and gravity balance to keep it in position
if it's not reflective then it heats up and has to get rid of the heat - by emission, to the venus side, if you're trying to minimise the radiation pressure
the shield would likely be highly reflective also so that could be a mirror to send the excess to further out
~~use a mirror array to beam excess light at mars~~
though if you're gonna thin it by yeeting may as well do it to move away
hm, actually you could probably make a bigger change than I thought using only venus' atmosphere, around 100 m/s, but that doesn't result in a meaningful orbital distance change (at least in terms of resultant insolation)
I don't think any meaningful orbital change could be achieved by yeeting venus' atmosphere, even at MPD velocities
and mars doesn't need a solar shield, this is significantly overstated. The magnetosphere (which mars still has, just a weak one) protects the atmosphere over millions of years, not human timescales, if you can restore the atmosphere you can sustain it.
venus would need a lot of effort to put the greenhouse gasses near zero to get temperature down though
can't be underestimated what processes that may make accessible
plus the moon gives you free in-vacuum manufacturing, you just don't pressurise it
for any material that's even vaguely accessible on the moon mining or production there makes way more sense than mars because of its accessibility and easy return to earth
big assumption that it will ever be mastered such that more data is no longer warranted
don't even need water humans can survive a couple days almost-zero-activity
on the moon you just get in the pod and as long as its engine and CO2 scrubber is working they'll get back alive
if something goes wrong on mars a *lot* needs to keep working to get people back
that completely ignores the value of using the moon as a safe way to learn about long-term space habitation, without everyone there inevitably dying
since they're not all consigned to die at the first failure
but for a small colony the moon makes way more sense
neither moon nor mars are getting colonised in millions
it's always the minority stuff that's interesting
dominated by Al2O3 and SiO2
and mars soil's common materials are pretty similar to lunar regolith
also that table is a slight underestimate going by the pioneer data
how hot is it indoors when it's 27 C outside?
solve the acidity too and it could be a tiny car pulling a birthday balloon around with it
we do have *some* materials that can survive the temperature
surface exploration is majorly hindered by lack of ability to generate power at the surface, but a long tether may be doable
and if you can find materials that don't break down at the surface you could maybe use it to support a power source for a rover on a *really* long tether
while humans you probably couldn't do much with you could potentially do a lot with an unmanned balloon though, make it long-term science
dump excess reactor heat in too
venus hot air balloon powered by the air conditioner
... I've just had a stupid idea
maybe if we made that massive sun shade and it started to cool
either too hot or no lift capacity for that
but I've seen a lot of people suggesting we'd have floating cloud cities and ... no
You can probably do some interesting short-term stuff around 60 km, maybe pushing down to around 58 (or maybe during the night you can make it viable and only inhabit then)
and you'd need a monster of an air conditioner to dump that and you'd be having to support it in earth atmospheric density
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323047863_Evolution_of_space_drones_for_planetary_exploration_A_review I am taking from here that uses raw data from pioneer probes
60 is still positive, I'm marking 68 as an absolute maximum achievable altitude
you're getting a handful of people with a fairly minimal lab and limited life support time, maximum
*if* you could do it, there is a small range just above 60 km where it *might* be doable, but you're not building a huge thriving colony or even a particularly significant scientific research station
added a third line, which is where felix baumgartner's balloon would float if you only doubled the weight of his capsule. Which is not a lot when you consider long-term power, scientific instruments, food, water, atmospheric supply, etc that would be needed - yes, you'll use a bigger balloon, but there are limits to how big you can make them and it's fundamentally going to be a fairly limited scaling - when you double the mass you either use two balloons or you double the balloon volume, which results in about double the mass (surface area is less than double but it needs to be thicker to deal with the additional strain)
density is what gives you lifting capacity by using something lighter
again the gasses are irrelevant because I'm looking at the density directly already
and note that this is still 30 C outside, meaning there's not actually any heat rejection - you either need to go higher still or have significant air conditioning to keep it there *and* be able to run any equipment or power sources
you're proposing a habitat that is capable of floating at the peak of mount everest while supporting its full weight
the lifting gas is irrelevant, even if the balloon was weightless and the lifting gas was vaccuum the maximum lift force is too small to support anything significant
this is the density, the thing you're using to create the buoyancy that's keeping you up there
you can't take the low pressure as a tradeoff this isn't even the pressure
you have to go higher than that and then the air is only as dense as the peak of mount everest
300 is still like absolute maximum long-term livable temperature
yes?
it's a case of close but no cigar because they almost cross at a comfortable point, but livable temperature isn't thick enough to support anything meaningful, thick enough to support something is too hot
as I said, I'm not "imagining" things, I'm looking at the actual tables. For even *earth* blimps to *work at all* they have to survive 20 C hotter than a hot day in australia, 24/7
you can only use thick materials to lift on venus if you go even lower than 52 km, and it only gets even hotter as you get lower
blimps on earth are already fairly minimal even when they don't have total atmospheric sealing and this thing has to manage that against the venusian atmosphere, and has to do it while floating at the equivalent of around 25k ft on earth
Here's the problem demonstrated. Earth surface density, which gives the same lifting capacity as something at the surface here, is 52 km. That's already at around 340 kelvin - or around 70 degrees
and that doesn't need total pressure sealing long-term or to have a liveable space
under half a ton is not a lot of lifting when you consider that *one* person is considered to contribute about a tonne of weight to fighter aircraft
making big balloons that don't pop is not easy. You can already use earth zeppellins for reference of what's achievable
not with a habitat hanging off it
no? it's if you use anything as your lifting gas. By the time it's even at earth density it's already well above comfortable temperatures
it does get overstated how easy it would be. When I looked I recall that while temperature/density matching is close to ideal at one altitude it is unfavourable - if you go just far down enough for floating to be easy it's too hot, so you'd be building very lightweight airtight zeppelins, wouldn't be able to bring a whole lot
~~the "woke" west is probably hornier and more deviant than them with the number of bdsm and other subcultures part of it~~
matt we know you're trying to pre-shill your yet-unnannounced ln debut
~~I never actually got the tracker app but I've also basically just not been out since march last year~~
shush australians don't count
because that point is already pretty hard to float at, equivalent to around mt everest's peak
see: like half of hololive

it also drives it for of-age characters, even if they're rarer
the sexualisation is just because sexualisation in general is less taboo in japan than the west, while violence is more
and so the only over-18 protagonists are in shows specifically about either finding a place in society as an adult or specifically rejecting the societal pressures
they *also* want to go back to when life was simpler
i mean it'd emerge without capitalism as people want to create stories that get read, *plus* the writers of these stories are going to feel the same way as their audience to a large extent
I mean yes and no, it's a market trend because that age range is much more popular, due to the rigid lifestyle and people looking back on high school as the last time they had freedom and so their escapist fantasies go back in that direction
it is federally 13 in japan but *every single* prefecture has a local one that is higher. I think one or two might be 16 but 90% of them are 18 or above
they just want to be angry at something
it doesn't really hold up to rational analysis but yeah 16 yos who just want to jump on the bandwagon aren't great at that
and it's fuckin real
the whole hobby lobby situation would get any kind of novel laughed out of the publishers if you tried to use it in anything other than a comedy
the only people out to "ruin" things would be some of the extreme anti-sjws who want to prevent actual sjws from doing something. like the people who review bombed the newest battletech game for daring to have pronoun selection
no
no, there is not
barring very rare bad actors everyone accused of it (aside plenty are accused just by not being an asshole) is aiming for equality, though some have better or worse ideas for that
there is no difference
some people still think that phase is cool, unfortunately
you just need to pay to get it set up
because they mean even with the distribution issues it can be produced locally enough to get to everyone
but those on top mean there's really no excuse for hunger
when more than half of food in the US is thrown away already and a huge amount of food is used at like 20% efficiency at best growing meat, you don't even need vertical farming and seasteading to actually produce sustainable food for probably most of the world

was it explicitly stated in the contract? because my point is even if it wasn't, the contract was written under that assumption because it was written before 2020
she has very good argument the contract was broken since it was based on faulty assumptions
offer to change it because the contract was predicated on a large theatrical release
so she's likely under like 7 layers of them screwing her out of it because yeah she probably doesn't get anything, nevermind how little it would be if she did
even if she got it from all sales, and even if disney didn't fuck with the accounting of disney+ to hide the apparent take of the movie, disney+ will be earning far less than theatre tickets
ok reading further, almost
I don't have the exact details but what I gather is she was supposed to get a % of theatrical sales (standard for big actors because you can get more money and it's common for studios to screw over actors who negotiate for profit % or such) but they didn't actually *do* a theatrical release

not to mention there seems no questioning of "hey is the guy we arrested still in jail" or "what was that guy's number plate? maybe we should check that's actually his car"
and there's no reports of weapons or such so what's their justification for immediately surrounding with a million weapons instead of just sending a couple cars to go "hey is something up?"
except for getting seen by GICs I guess unless you can pay

it can't be largely from both

people were just unaware before and the terfs are managing to be self-defeating

there's a strong selection bias for pretty in movies
lots of people can act and act well
it's a very significant part of the reason they're in them in the first place
and this is even assuming that apple will be all above-board with it
even a targeted image in order to try capture particular people
they say the way it works is by just comparing to a known database of image hashes, but then who says someone isn't going to hack it and just ... add some completely innocent image's hash to the database
the fact this system exists at all though means it can be used for other things, and who knows how it might be exploited
honestly I don't know if I trust your judgement on that Vyn considering how often you end up posting news from conservative sources in here
it's for discussion
this isn't bias this is that it's been stated before this channel isn't for venting
this says something about how successful onlyfans is that he's changing that
they went more aggressive than mastercard were pushing and onlyfans' founder is a shifty guy who normally skips out before having to actually do real work on his scams
replacing it will be annoying
we used it for background music in D&D so its quality hardly mattered
at least for now
as I pointed out they were going *more* aggressive than the payment processors require
they won't lose the major credit cards from walking back on this decision
technically there's also amex but I'm pretty sure they're less popular and they probably also wouldn't be far behind
if you get screwed by VISA and mastercard you basically can't use credit cards
mac you realise this isn't "particular banks" it's "the entire credit card *system*"
yes
While they're going too slow about it Toyota quite possibly has the *better* idea than electric cars. Hydrogen cars don't need huge quantities of rare earth metals, they're not seeing anything like what the electric car industry is with over-demand of batteries

but the real solution is "none of the above" and japan is *way* ahead of almost everyone in that regard with their public transport infrastructure (for the most part. Some cities in more rural prefectures still don't have it great)
it's about as close to banning as you can get
I mean said time periods are like, sunday 9 PM to friday 8 PM, fri 9 PM to sat 8 PM, sat 9 PM to sun 8 PM
the average person does not have well considered consistent positions, as a general rule
I strongly suspect you'll get such messy answers in *any* country
actually it might make sense if they're expecting thing to get worse after that and want another party to take the fall
I don't know why the LDP would consider doing that a good thing but hey maybe they'll get a party that actually does stuff
> hottest country on earth
> claiming that global warming might not be a bad thing
this is relatively trivial by comparison
you're saying good luck to the country that manages to run the great firewall?
everything breeds larger until the largest stop working
which would correlate with a biological pressure
as well as carcinisation another evolution trend that's noticed is that pretty much all species trend towards growing larger until an evolutionary pressure says "no"
there's fuckloads of women who are exclusively interested in tall guys you're just seeing the counterculture to that
and some of that inherited advantage is probably compound causative that a taller family was historically more successful and it built up over time
but there's probably some % of it that is causative
caveat that it may not be entirely causative as ex. you'll grow taller if you're well-fed as a child which is more likely from a rich family and a rich family is more likely to have successful kids because of the advantages that confers
napoleon is more complicated than just that, he *did* appear short on the battlefield because his personal guard was exclusively made of giant men and so in a telescope he looked tiny
oh they'll cooperate just fine - so long as it's about removing oppressed people's rights
it's specifically got that wording to discourage people from seeking or giving assistance because they know people more likely to need it are less likely to be able to get themselves there (lack of car, etc)
or for these same people refusing to tell them about birth control
"punishment" is such an insane justification. As though you're supposed to have *chance* to learn from the "mistake" when you're spending 18 years raising a kid who's also suffering this punishment
since it's not a centralised thing, if you can just get something tweeted enough it'll take off
it's also risky to assume someone else won't manage to manipulate control of them away from you
specific movements like that are losing a lot of steam even if qanon is rampant
though wider efforts to resist the white nationalist movement are having somewhat better effect
this was before stuff started heating up again with BLM and such and pretty much all of them went straight back to the next KKK to form. The guy arguably made the situation worse as the KKK that he convinced to disband were terrible people but relatively passive about it, but the group that replaced them is *very* active
US: Many white supremacist statues, many white supremacists
Germany: no nazi statues, few nazis
statues don't really do that
apparently they refloated it
but with this acting as precedence it'll be much less difficult to fight moves like those
that said there's a good chance they'll try things like lowering search results for those that use external processors
limiting apple's control of the marketplace
but letting them do it in app? big hit
since especially apple customers aren't likely to bother pulling external apps to avoid costs
much more powerful than the opposite would be at least
even if it's not specifically about being a woman it's happening because it's easier to mistreat a woman in this society
y' can tell logic isn't conservatives strong suit
> lost against america
> would win a war america lost
twitch had some technicality that let them get away with making it more expensive (I think different path for acquiring the bits/the fact they're also more expensive on google?)
so it's just straight less profit on all sales (or way overcharged elsewhere to compensate)
apple's rule was that they take 30% and you're not allowed to make it more expensive on apple pay
it accomplishes revenue gain for epic
both want that fortnite money moving again
but allow others if the user clicks a few buttons
probably apple will request that apple pay be default with a 10% cut or something
and if apple says no they'll sue again because they have proof it was previously accepted with the only difference being the payment processor - which now has to be allowed
Now that this result has happened though epic will attempt to enter a new contract
maybe epic stop giving so many cheap deals to fortnite players but the majority of people, even those using iphones, are not fortnite players so the majority are better off after the ruling, as lank says
I was on a flight like a month before (from NY) and was invited into the cabin to meet the pilots (I was a child). That's something that doesn't happen any more (and is probably depressing for the pilots that they can't break up the monotony of the flight)
they had been starting to tighten up a little but they were much looser, yes
the logic is likely that it's causing people to *not* buy the *new* ones
to be fair you could spin "I can't think of one" as "Our education is so bad that they're very forgettable" but the fact he fails to even catch onto that
given "no english allowed" being quite weird it's dubious whether this list is 100% accurate, but I know I can confirm several aspects (like no blood/bones/anti-society actions)
amusingly this list has several things that ban total war: three kingdoms
especially since it's a separate point "no sex at all"
it probably means "no showing 14 year olds dating"
except it probably doesn't mean what your mind is thinking of
so with three exposures/vaccinations you're probably gonna last even longer (assuming the immunosuppressants aren't total)
the point of the double vaccine dose is because with a one-off exposure the body's more likely to go "eh, probably not a big deal, let's forget about it" and the second dose makes it go "oh wait this one's going around let's be prepared"
and because of that backup you're much more resistant even with zero blood content, because a new infection is compared against the backup and the body can start new ones much faster
"which antibodies" is a relevant question as after exposure to basically anything there'll be a long-term storage of effectively "backups" in the liver, even if blood content goes down
911 just made it convenient to manufacture the consent
the imperialism was going to happen anyway, bush wanted a war
pretty much.
(I joke but yes there were casualties, but compared to the impact it would've had hitting the white house or capitol building it's basically nothing; would've likely killed more in either, done *way* more significant damage, and the people dying would've been more significant)
~~yeah but they're all spooks so it doesn't matter~~
the worst it did was cost the us govt some money while they had to rent out basically all the offices in crystal city to do renovations + reinforcements
white house + capitol building would've been a smarter combo though because the pentagon was honestly barely touched by the plane. It broke through only two of the five building rings at all and only did damage across maybe less than a quarter of that side of the building anyway

yes, I was just about to come back with that it seems it was intentional
it is unlikely the crash was intentional, probably it started going down because of the fighting and no-one could recover it
based on their competence with everything else
~~probably would've been random based on whichever one they saw first because they couldn't tell the difference~~
(they failed but it crashed into a field)
two planes, one for each tower, one plane into pentagon (didn't do much to the building in the grand scheme of things though), and one that was probably going to the white house IIRC? but they didn't have anyone competent on crowd control for that one so the passengers figured out what was happening and tried to take control back
if it were a public process so people would actually get to hear about it it would be funny to submit a game that goes against ancient china and argue it's justified by this rule because it invaded itself so many times
because people won't realise it's missing and it means people don't get angry about how fixed they are
I think the only support bias such a strange proposal would have is age-wise
that's apparently a backronym and its actual origin isn't clear. Certainly it is used with a bias to violent behaviour than just class but both are part of it so I could see that being an issue
looking at the display below it looks like it was going to keep turning and wouldn't have gone straight at those pedestrians ... but it had no reason to turn there and if it's going that wrong who knows if it was confident there was a gap where it was trying to turn
they want it to stay that way
as is there's not actually any law preventing them doing things
not hte way things are going
not so much as information and narrative is easily overwhelmed by organised PR
capitalism has proven over and over that you don't lose with a bad product as long as you have the hype behind it
this is how capitalism works
because tesla runs entirely off of press so if you show *any* indication that things aren't as hyped up as they are it's bad
people didn't realise the damage cinnamon can cause if it gets to your lungs so lots of people figured that was harmless
plus people actually realised ide pods was dumb so not many people ... actually did it
the cinnamon challenge was way more dangerous and way earlier than tide pods
*not* surprised I stopped using it more than half a decade ago
apps plural indicates to me that there were other independent apps expressly for this purpose (but likely disguised in business-talk in the app description)
slavery: now with in-app purchases
though there's also this related so apple maybe should be careful about what it says https://twitter.com/AnEnigmaDave/status/1438659261819621378

it's been known for a long while
welcome to apple's stupidity of "we're going to spend more money to make a worse product and multiple versions of it rather than just take the easy option of making a good product"
I'm not sure if they do have the power for that, but they can definitely fine for not using USBC
as I said they forced it for everyone else
they just need to figure out how much of a fine is too much for apple
to use a connection that ... has no physical or datawise benefit and just creates their closed ecosystem
apple are just taking the insane route of "the fines are worth the price"
it already has with the exception of apple. Everyone else is usb micro-b or -c because it's not worth being rejected by the european market
so they'd just be tightening up
they're the reason everyone moved to micro-B before and C I think is the only real exception you're allowed at the moment
the EU's already 90% of the way there
if they can it's probably 6 of 1 half a dozen of the other
it'll depend whether the person who typically hosts witht he old method has a connection that can manage the upload
nevermind
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
this is just 100% pure unadultered dumb design
so even without being able to disconnect, there's no backdrive voltage and no risk of overheating
The photo of their dash confirms they have a model S and another tweet they state theirs is a 2015 model, 3 years before the permanent magnet switchover
I see vague notes that they moved to a more general shiftover to permanent magnets but not when it happened / what models other than the 3 it applies to
it's only with permanent magnet motors that happens, with induction motors no power = no generation
because only the model 3 should have the generation issue anyway
... hang on, am I going insane, or is that *not* a model 3 being tweeted about?
resistance drops to almost nothing (and generation to actually nothing) without a circuit
the motor will only generate power if it's connected to a complete circuit
electrical disconnection of the drivetrain would work just as well as physically disconnecting the wheels from it but if they've failed basic design safety to have that controlled by emergency power then yeah that can't be done
guerilla forces can and do use regular tactics too
the definition is they're *effective* as guerrila forces, not that they're mostly used by them
hence the US *doesn't* use them
guerilla tactics are hard to use and much less efficient for large orgs
... you're not reading what I said, I'm pointing out the definition *doesn't* change
a lot of them work *because* of small, largely-independent units
that's also because it's *much* harder to *use* those kinds of tactics as a large org
if they can just nuke you your rifle does less than jack shit
guerilla warfare is only effective against a country that cares about its public image
which is basically as difficult to make as boob plate would be and with less point as the compound curvature isn't really enough to lend more strength
also the super-sculpted spartan armour, which gets exaggerated or misused in fiction a lot (often by putting it with societies that have nothing to do with them) but did actually exist
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
though often even more exaggerated
boob plate is this
to steal a yt video's thumbnail, https://img.youtube.com/vi/lBtvS5yhTA8/0.jpg
bikini armour is different
and yes, it's potentially realistic as it causes compound curves which are a very good way of adding a lot of strength - but also very difficult to make by most methods other than casting (which has shit strength)
"boob plate" presumes a whole plate armour but with the boobs moulded in
but it's still dumb
they might not be legally allowed to ask for proof
I don't agree with these statements at all. To the extent I would be looking forward to retiring, it's because I have more time to have fun with my own hobbies. I don't consider not feeling to be a good thing at all
so why not ask if they can do it then
they've made small bans to try alleviate the power issues but this is their first "no this clearly hasn't worked no more crypto for you"
I don't believe china has yet outright banned crypto like this
I would predict they're misunderstanding self-locking locks; you don't actively lock them, but they are locked
(quotes because it never really was)
but either way it's not people who remember when it was "safe" to leave a front door unlocked
freshers are less likely to be in houses so I was figuring 19-20
these are going to be like 20 yos
it was stated repeatedly that tesla is not solving the actual issue
it's not
if train, one vehicle can replace up to 1000 while being entirely grade-separated
if bus one vehicle can replace at least 10, up to 100+ in dense cities
instead of one replacing one but the person inside is tweeting
one vehicle can replace many
public transit would be what the majority take
the ideal solution doesn't require any autonomous cars
it's literally win-win
as well as making driving better for the few who either cannot or do not wish to give up driving
but a shift to have a significant proportion in public transit vastly improves the issue
they don't need to give it up entirely
they might not stop but the roads are still full
congestion will always happen if there are a lot of vehicles
which self-driving cars barely improve on cars for, if they do at all
moving a lot of people
tesla being cunts and some tesla drivers being idiots (if you want to be generous you might say they're trying to show how bad it is and being super naive about how terrible an idea it is to intentionally drive badly)
you know where the corners of your car are though (if you're not totally incompetent)
a parking lot is a parking lot
which I think most people would consider the bigger deal
they're not experienced with your car though
... while the rest is disgusting, is not using valet parking considered a big deal in america?
they just push over-the-air updates to whoever's signed up. There's probably some simulation testing but they don't bother actually demonstrating it so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
tesla doesn't bother with proving grounds is the issue
So yeah Tesla can get fucked
They're asking you to help cover up potential public accidents with people who did not consent to this test
They're not asking you not to publish mistakes on private circuits
They're testing on public roads the public has every right to see every little thing it does

~~it's much funnier to imagine that though~~
now that guy's got a good racket going
only one of by professors had a "required" textbook (but you could still manage without it), the rest all had suggested reading but nothing forcing you to get them, and that one required one was £15
probably getting a big kickback
it was certainly overpriced but there was a definite point
idk about any of your universities but on both of my degrees I learned a *lot* that would have been extremely difficult to find out independently
though in that case *not* defaulting on debts becomes equally important as another aspect of such faith
faith shaken might be the bigger issue, given it is demonstrably possible to continuously print money without causing inflation
they can definitely come together but it appears to not be forced
japan's economy casts a lot of doubt on the idea of printing money = inflation
armis better phrases what I was trying to mean
depends who you ask, generally what people mean by specifically "transgender" doesn't include all forms of NB but trans is also used as an umbrella term that would catch it
at least not industrial scale ones. 7.5t will barely cover cabin + trailer, nevermind cargo
since 7.5t isn't a HGV
ok, reading through this sounds just like a system glitch
what's the news here?

people are definitely influenced by the media they consume
I mean, all media can. The mistake that's usually made is thinking that video games do it moreso

facebook is down entirely but YT is fine for me
probably because the severity hasn't entirely left the domain of the nerds yet
oh after hours jumped back up again. traders can't decide which way to go yet
outlook lmfao
if they're still down at open tomorrow it's gonna plummet
the after hours price is -.069% from close and falling as I watch it
facebook shares closed trading an hour ago which is likely before the news started spreading that this would actually last a while
they could maybe get hug of death'd by the traffic overflow from fb users migrating but they shouldn't be affected by an fb outage
I thought they were their own thing
... did tiktok get bought by fb?
there's no data breach from this but more than half of facebook accounts were already leaked before
hours on the low side if they get all the right phone numbers on call quickly
it's down and it's going to be down for a while
the routing data was likely nuked when the update failed
the leak is a different thing facebook has been a data sieve for over a decade
https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/1445081561536339970
facebook would be a heavily cached result and it's *all* down?
especially worldwide
could be but that's not an easy thing to do
a clean deregistration would just be nxdomain
since it's servfail if it's deregistered it's not cleanly
since you're closer maybe verisign threw in a temporary reg to help them get back in the building?
I still get temporary failure in name resolution

it'd be over 10 million off in terms of kinetic energy because it's over 3
and 500 times faster than the fastest man-made object *ever*
this is 3330 times faster than a rod from god
this is a relativistic weapon
lmfao
they've miscalculated then
I linked you *the* calculation
it's somewhat scary because it's small and hideable but in terms of overall effectiveness, it's like a city block at most
the only source for that is a fairly sensationalist article that has no further source so yes they're including the davy crockett, which is basically a joke weapon
and as I said, that's only real if you let the davy crockett qualify
link the line

https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2820+tonnes+*+%289+km%2Fs%29%5E2%29+%2F+2+

unless you mean a davy crockett
no it's not
but anyway realistically if china tries to invade taiwan then three gorges goes boom
a nuke is up to 5.2 million times their mass in TNT
and they're a maximum of about 20 tonnes due to launch limits
they've got 9 times their mass in TNT equivalent at most if they manage to be completely immune to drag
no they can't
if they work perfectly
they're great bunker busters but they have like, 100 t of energy maximum
tungsten rods in space aren't particularly fantastic weapons
as well as probably as many defensive agreements as they can manage with SK and JP
but taiwan do still have those missiles aimed at three gorges
china would potentially consider it worthwhile even if a lot of capacity is lost if they control what's left
china would prefer not war but china wants control and it believes taiwan is a part of it it lacks control of
and it's not particularly efficient as one. Effective, yes, but not worth an entire rocket launch
it's very much a precision strike weapon, not a WMD
since it's not a real weapon it mostly gets referred to by the joke name so yes
it's doubtful whether prices will ever return to pre-pandemic levels, pretty much all the chip manufacturers have announced permanent price increases because the demand is just so high in general

password manager
the more you get changed while it's not panic mode the less panic it is when there is a leak
you wanna start changing those out
yes
just the method
passwords weren't leaked, either raw or hashed
a password change doesn't affect how much hackers know about twitch's password system
then when people log in do a reset then
that would be effectively the same as you can't realistically force immediate reset on everyone, too many people will be away from computer - you keep the old database but have a note on account whether to use the new method
but it won't help until twitch does such
they can change the password system and include a note with the account whether to use the old or new
the vulnerability exposed is if someone *else* leaks the password database, then you can test passwords locally without rate-limiting
it won't help brute force passwords, the vulnerability there is the same
knowing the algorithm just makes rainbow tables generatable since you know the salt

texts are not secure in general (nothing that relies on a phone number is) but now it's confirmed they're extra-not-secure
> A company that is a critical part of the global telecommunications infrastructure used by AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and several others around the world such as Vodafone and China Mobile, quietly disclosed that hackers were inside its systems for years, impacting more than 200 of its clients and potentially millions of cellphone users worldwide. 
> 
> Syniverse repeatedly declined to answer specific questions from Motherboard about the scale of the breach and what specific data was affected, but according to a person who works at a telephone carrier, whoever hacked Syniverse could have had access to metadata such as length and cost, caller and receiver's numbers, the location of the parties in the call, as well as the content of SMS text messages.
> 
> "Syniverse is a common exchange hub for carriers around the world passing billing info back and forth to each other," the source, who asked to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to talk to the press, told Motherboard. "So it inevitably carries sensitive info like call records, data usage records, text messages, etc. [...] The thing is—I don’t know exactly what was being exchanged in that environment. One would have to imagine though it easily could be customer records and [personal identifying information] given that Syniverse exchanges call records and other billing details between carriers."
> 
> The company wrote that it discovered the breach in May 2021, but that the hack began in May of 2016.
>  
> "Syniverse has access to the communication of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people around the world. A five-year breach of one of Syniverse's main systems is a global privacy disaster," Karsten Nohl, a security researcher who has studied global cellphone networks for a decade, told Motherboard in an email. "Syniverse systems have direct access to phone call records and text messaging, and indirect access to a large range of Internet accounts protected with SMS 2-factor authentication. Hacking Syniverse will ease access to Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and all kinds of other accounts, all at once."

good ol' timmy simps
the article explains what it does
though people have been questioning whether they're actually following them for a while
and it was a few years after that that info about how the leak happened and how they've addressed it that I signed up
I only saw it in a couple places when I signed up for it. They used to be all over a few years ago, had a minor leak, then seemed to focus more on improving their rep rather than doing sponsorships
welp it wasn't exactly something I could plan but I'm glad I went with NordVPN instead of the ones that get most of the advertising
meanwhile they all have australian accents and there's a palm tree in the background?

it's the mathematically proven minimum - but minimums are basically only for reference when you apply to real populations

tbf a large reason in that case is because it varies so wildly by area, so it's more like "30 is significant per area if you assume each area is homogenous"
but 30 is the absolute minimum to get significance even with results that strong, so 80 on an opinion which doesn't have that absolute nature is basically irrelevant
(again, assuming unbiased sampling)
if the only options are "yes" or "no" (and not by manipulating the question, just by the nature of it) then you have significance fairly early, because you don't need to be confident in a bell curve
Not the results being biased, the options
if the results are totally biased ("yes" or "no" with no "usually" or "mostly") then the size of population doesn't matter, 30 is the minimum for it to have significance (though it's not a guarantee). However, opinions are not black-and-white
30 is the minimum for statistical relevance but that's assuming totally biased results (so no fuzzy probability to distinguish) and random selection, so 80 opinions that are self-selected ...
most of the internet was not like that. CoD lobbies were something very different and definitely frowned upon in general

because they do have legal justification
then your argument is not about the actual legal basis of this
doesn't extradition happen before determining guilt to bring them into court *for* that purpose?
I would be surprised if he hadn't given everything that's on wikileaks
assuming the rumour is true, anyway, would mean that it's not just that a live round forced its way out of the replica
there's also rumour that the same gun was used for target practice earlier that day so it's a legit gun and not a replica
press conference on the movie shooting recently, apparently was because of live rounds being used, they're still trying to figure out why
This is true of everything, it just only becomes an appreciable measurement error at the particle scale. It's not some magic property that only exists for these particles, it's that even a photon hitting it transfers energy. You still get the measurement you wanted, you just lose at least one of the properties afterward.

Everything beyond that is not *unknowable*, it's only unknown because we don't have a big enough particle accelerator yet. Most discoveries at that scale are from indirect observation, by blowing the particles up and watching the debris do weird shit that it shouldn't do on its own. The "wall" is temporary
we also know that rutherford's atomic model is outdated - it lacks any consideration for orbitals or such. Which is the key difference between science and religion - science is willing to dismiss ideas both millenia old and confirmed only a few years ago
the fact that you don't perceive it as snarky when others do mean there's some kind of disconnect, so that's what should be identified
Yumi's not asking you to quote the dictionary but describe your perception of it
though moreso than just "this age" it's kinda any age. there's always a reason for acting out and forcibly preventing it isn't a fix
*rhyme but yes
Mhm. Tone can cancel out potential added snarkiness from that IRL, since you can say it completely calmly and that's eliminated. Reading it doesn't enforce a neutral tone, and the "default" impression for that kind of phrasing isn't neutral most of the time
if it can be vague on its own that happens a lot less
Most languages will have issues like this. I'd suggest as a start, if a statement is absolute on its own ("didn't mention <x>"), more effort to make it absolute starts to come off as snarky
Lots of words can be technically correct without giving good impressions. And unfortunately "literally" gets used a lot in snark
I will pick out this message particularly; being so direct here gives a very "are you stupid for thinking this?" kind of impression; saying "literally" and "not even slightly". You'd be managing the same question without that snarky impression with just

> I didn't mention twitter, I was talking about certain discord servers I'm in
One key point is that I'm just gonna quote this
and it's not the bare minimum with maximum directness
being excessively direct can easily be the problem
You can if you listen when people are telling you that things are coming across that way and think of other ways to phrase things. Which are always possible; there's huge amounts of unnecessary words in english
Those are, yes. But there's been other lines, quoted before, that are not so clearly intentional or not - particularly since you say you didn't intend any
If you are regularly being intentionally snarky, but your regular speech is not *distinctly* different with the lack of tone online, it can make your regular speech seem more snarky to others
facebook being a prime example
it's barely anonymity at all, just the perceived lack of consequence. If moderators don't change things it happens just as easily on sites that enforce real identity rules
getting people to join is much more effort on discord than reddit
imagine thinking that misgendering is criticism

The majority of coal use is directly for energy and not into products, still
but that's still a) the minority of coal use, b) doesn't release all of that coal carbon
Okay reading further Hisarna does still use coal just considerably less
coal hasn't been needed for steel since the 80's?
unlike natural gas or oil coal isn't really used for products, just energy, so it can 100% be replaced with renewable or nuclear
also like, the single biggest company-contributor to emissions is China Coal. It would not cost them significantly to pressure switching away from coal internally and it'd be 14% of *all worldwide emissions*
"No" is a very different answer to "You're responsible for most of ours so how about we work out a way for the emissions you're responsible for to be accounted to you, then we'll cut our own?"
we'll see if this is just a pretense to lobby for their spying to be made legal

that's not a bad idea for ramen, yeah
even square ones will roll more easily than a wide flat fork, but yeah they're usually manageable if the surface is mostly flat
tbf a fork doesn't roll as easily as chopsticks
but even so probably good to avoid that happening in photos because people can't tell easily
I feel like this might be an unfortunate forced perspective and they're not stuck up
both too long out of water and crushed by the other material
it's very unlikely they'd still be alive by the time they're on deck
they give a suggestion but it's really not clear how they're sure fish won't swim into the collection zone
how are they avoiding catching animals in the nets
depends whether it's reported generally or reported as income but it likely takes away a lot of tax-free credits even if it's not income
if they have brains those scams should start failing hard, because you need to report SSN with it - meaning you have personally identifying info on the scammer, even assuming you're willing to commit to it
it's already a huge rug pull
so this is just instant banning of quite a few cryptocurrencies in general
which bitcoin and many other coins *cannot physically tell you*
you're required to report who you received it from
reading up it gets really fun though
or go like forza and create an in-game artist community by providing the tools to *make them*
let people import their own
it would be relatively trivial to do something like minecraft capes but again you could just do it without blockchain
but it would be a relatively trivial thing for steam to implement cross-game permissions to the same item
I don't recall whether it'll let you look at items that aren't assigned to your game
but you can certainly trade for them
i dont recall whether steam inventory system lets you get other game's items via the API tbf
there's been various takedowns pointed out of how it makes no sense and won't work in practice because no-one will support these one-off NFTs versus actual common items
and that the difficulty is not transferring the item but implementing it again
the argument for nft games is claiming that you'd somehow have items from one transfer to another because the blockchain proves you have them from the other game while totally ignoring the game server could just ... *do that anyway*
whereas all currency is *mostly* fungible for any other currency; there's some debate to be had on exchange rates, but everyone agrees they're currency that can be exchanged and keep value
also, more generally: any given game is not fungible for any other game; even variants of it. Digital MTG is not equivalent to physical MTG, for instance
to play hearthstone irl both players would need that ridiculous yugioh 2000+ card deck, just for "just in case", that's not even their actual deck
not like any card game; it's not "random from your deck", it's "random from *every card to ever exist*"
those people will never see justice so long as it's not legally an air accident
the people responsible are the ones who set policy such that they ended up with handling procedures which damaged the chair
and with the irs now very interested it's a baaaad idea
if you want to listen to that devil and make money on it you need to become the scammer instead
iirc a lot of them have a specific morgue room hidden precisely for iyt
cruise ships will have it happen constantly 'cause all the guests are old
and unlike traditional money laundering there's *nothing* they can do to hide that once there's a link between the wallets and they make one public
quite a few people have been caught by accepting donations to a wallet on twitter that got linked to another wallet they used for drugs or other illegal activities
at least now there's a permanent unhideable record of that purchase so as soon as the wallet can be linked to a more public one that they're willing to attach their name to they're super-vulnerable
in theory if you've not done anything sus though, you can just do it, bank asks their questions, and it's all above board. Or was, until the IRS started needing receipts that are really hard to fill out because of the way crypto works
but you'd likely turn it into regular investments speaking realistically
I think the limit is like $250k in a regular bank account
eat the mouse
NFTs are irrelevant
it changes *nothing*
you have the bank statement proving you bought it
and sure someone's about to reply "but now you have proof they're being scummy and taking it away!" but ... you already had that proof
this guy's suggestions for stuff like "once you buy a game you have a permanent record that you own that game and it can't be taken away" sounds nice until you realise a system update can just go "actually we're just gonna ignore that" or "$company$ says you're not allowed that any more so I'mma just automatically give the token back"

going by what it actually was the current web would already be like 4+?
it's also hilarious how all these NFT advocates don't know what web2.0 was and are using web3 like it's new
there is basically no difference
both feudalism and capitalism have the singular endpoint of collecting all power with a singular or small selection of singular individuals, the only difference is one aims to do so primarily by weapons power and the other by wealth
socialism demands a lot more work put in
capitalism is kinda *much* simpler than socialism; they are all one system because there's nothing to disqualify any of them from even the theoretical model. Capitalism's just "free for all, anyone charge what they want for the things they (can claim they) have, let it all result from there"
the point isn't whether he was good at doing the thing it's that he could only do the thing because of old money
bezos' family were able to support him to do his stupid selling-books-from-his-garage idea which no lower class family could possibly do
and he went to a private school
zuckerberg might actually the the lowest-starter I can think of as his parents were dentist and psychiatrist but that's still *very* upper-middle at lowest
there's some that went from moderately high wealth to highest in the world like bezos, but I can't think of any that started from middle class or lower
I can't actually think of any big names that are new-money, off the top of my head
booster is the exact same thing, *unless* they've made improvements so you're getting the *new* exact same thing as everyone else
capitalism's barely different
even in the feudal era you'd very rarely get someone being promoted for defending an aristocrat or something. Bare minimum social mobility but just enough to act as a measly carrot
it's definitely not a new thing to split a company to dump undesirable aspects
Comparing to countries energy usage, *all of google*, including youtube, ranks in the top 90, and it does plenty to justify that energy use. Bitcoin alone is like, 14th?
bbc and business insider very much are
gizmodo is not mass media

crypto is orders of magnitude more energy use than video entertainment and entertainment is far more valuable than making the rich richer
and you're totally wrong lol
the eco aspect was spread in grassroots discourse for *years* already
they're totally uncritical of all the scams and such
the mass media's only just turning to that as it's starting to be restricted as they try figure out why
the mass media's already trying to do that and has been for a while
> they already have their systems set in place for laundering money
https://twitter.com/afronooch/status/1458184718281691136
that's why the rich would get into it
because the corrolary to 300 -> 30,000 (which is extremely naive anyway) is 300,000 -> 30,000,000
the richest people in the world have a plurality, or often even a majority, of their money in stocks
and being technically able to buy some doesn't make any difference to people who can't afford enough to make any decent return, and have plenty to focus on with far higher priority
"they have existing methods, so they won't use a new one that's returning way more than 99% of stock investments" is absurdly naive
cryptocurrency does nothing to help poor people escape oppression or such - it's for the rich to get richer. The poor cannot afford it in the first place, and proof of stake is no different - its *entire premise* is "you already have investment, so you get more". This is even presuming totally unregulated currency is at all desirable versus, for instance, just using a foreign currency that's more stable
it starts where it's far more than one family needs, and ends as far as we've allowed them to get
but upper class crosses orders of magnitude
that level is easily upper class
trying to create even splits across all levels of wealth with only three classes is stupid
landlords are way above middle class
they were always vague, the fact there's a huge range of upper class doesn't mean landlords are middle class
not a house
you were middle class in the 1920's if you could afford a toaster
from its very original meaning the middle-class are those who can afford luxuries without having to really plan the money, not those who can afford *multiple houses*
which is not changed by crypto
those are totally unconnected
the central banks are not responsible for employers underpaying
which is the same in crypto
just your pay
the employer doesn't control the currency
it doesn't since the centralisation is totally disconnected from the employer
with salaried you get a little less and with freelance you get a *lot* less in the majority of industries

my parents used a microwave from the 80's until a couple years ago, they're indestructible
if it's just the food that burned, not the microwave, then you can like ... clean it
microwave is good for popcorn too
there's variation
actually hm
microwaving should be restricted to stuff that wants to be and stay liquid
I have a microwave/grill/oven combi and I end up mostly using the oven mode 'cause you get better results
assuming that those can cover everything is hugely naive
except ... hm. It's not quite that because it's also capped; super dense areas won't have more intense street lighting than low density areas, so it'll just be measuring street density
I figure it's a better proxy for economic performance * capita, so if you had accurate population density maps it could provide the originally proposed data ... but that's not what the original proposition was.
wanting to not be tagged is not unreasonable, expecting everyone to remember every time when it's an uneditable default and it's extremely un-normal for there to be a relevant reminder in names somewhat is
"who you are" versus "info that you expect to always 100% be acted upon"
neither of those the same kind of info
99.9% of people don't have anything of relevance in the name and it's a separate leap that it specifically refers to @ tagging in discord
you do, and even if you do want to try separate it it should only be done very critically, else you risk ignoring major problematic things in their work just because you don't want to think about it from that aspect
obscure shit from iski's list. Dubbed by Irina after I won rounds by the sheer amount of random shit that came up from my list which no-one had heard of

a misspelling of conformity
I also covered those examples in my statement so I'm not even gonna reply
also chatrooms come with different social norms. names get skim-read, if someone has a joke in it, you laugh, if there's pronouns or some format that suggests plurals, you note that, but things that break the pattern are much less likely to be processed. If it were IRL and you made a request when introducing yourself, it'd be rude for people to forget, but in a chatroom you don't have that introduction step

they didn't come along to put money in and get money out
they created the company, their gain is in running the company and it doing well
but not an investor who demands that their investment pays back
if the founder brings the money to start it and works there too, then they're generally not referred to as an investor
you only need *investment* if a lot of capital is needed for this particular business. A lot don't require that (such as a tech company where individual's PCs are generally powerful enough). Investor implies that's their *only* function though
that's kinda what the initial public offering thing is about that a bunch of companies have been doing lately
also even without coops a company & therefor employer can exist without investors
(which happens to not be a cooperative but is much more restrictive in what they do than a normal bank)
used to own the cooperative bank
which is huge
there's literally The Cooperative Group in the UK
it's just that power ends at the border
so as long as they're not totally corrupt, national institutions have way more power
unlike national institutions they exist to look good rather than being strict necessities
since the IRS, being on a national scale, is a necessity and just has these functions folded in
the IRS has more teeth
an institution like this exists because the rich allow it so of course it can't go after them
it's not exclusively either
also the US refusing to enter would only be relevant if either that's where the tax evasion bank accounts were, or it was only americans dodging
by design because the ones making it are the rich it would hit
worse, since your savings almost never will take you as far
the rich don't take risks they're just good at pretending to
China could focus investment away from polluting sources of energy without changing that equation much

regardless this quota is pointless because who would want to work for this company
the whole point of these quotas is because no-one is actually capable of rational decisions and women will pretty much always be rated lower in ability/suitability even if she's actually better than the male candidate - so if a guy *is* objectively the best candidate, that advantage will far outshine any quota requirement. It'd be worth having to hire others to make the quota work to have this guy

you're free to not take your vote if you don't want
the fact there were a significant number up for protesting means they understood enough they should have a vote
that's not a reason to not give them a say at 15
and some people don't learn those are wrong in 90 years
if you let them vote *before* those things then voting becomes a lot more prominent
at the moment they don't give a shit because they can't vote until 18 and there's a whole lot of more significant things that happen at 18 to worry about
and attitudes are different when they know things are actually relevant to them
but 16 year olds get that they're being fucked over by future policy
many 30 year olds don't

there was a chinatown in tenochitlan within 10 years of the aztec empire falling. The old world was *far* more diverse than stories have lead people to believe
by mainly testing things that you learn *in better schools* which correlate with white neighbourhoods

IQ is terrible
Memory performance, language learning, IQ, maths, *everything* correlates better with learning than with age
All
with intelligence there's far stronger correlations with initial education and job worked, as well as *birthdate*, not age
no it doesn't
the fact there's a correlation with age means nothing
it's a failure of some super-specific super-sensitive cells in the ear
hearing loss is totally unrelated to intelligence
are super smart
those who have?
as is an adult who has never used any school learning in the past four decades
a teen who's never been to school in their life is *fucking stupid*
all people is a *terrible* metric because it muddies actual mental capability with that induced by lifestyle
mental elasticity remains high well into old age if you sample among those who did jobs requiring it
the counter to any study that would attempt to produce such data is also that this is not a graph of age intelligence, it's a reverse graph of how effective education was going back in time
it's also a well-disproven idea, people who keep their minds active in adulthood have *plenty* of intelligence of every kind well into old age
do it coward
the rebrand was just for the owning group
you can only quantify some very specific measures and *good* tests of that find you actually don't lose performance with age much at all
even imperial college london, which is almost oxbridge level
Literally no education institution I've been in has even considered trying to figure out anyone's IQ
the only people still using IQ are MENSA which is a white people's club in the guise of being for intelligence
it's just nonsense
because it's not
IQ doesn't even attempt to specify whether it's quantifying "fluid" or "crystalised" intelligence

also fun fact a lot of birds feed their young with something chemically similar to milk
The point is that if you try reduce any "x kg CO2 per y kg of beef" figure in accordance to how much is "already accounted for" then you completely break any attempt to work out what a reduction would actually result in
the most accurate is to give the raw value in both, because then if you consider crazy ideas like outlawing one, it doesn't affect the value of the other
If you're trying to produce a table of "this is how much CO2 it takes to make this much of <meat/milk>" you shouldn't be doing any cross-accounting, because you can do it in both directions and make them both misleading
so you can't really try reduce one's impact that way by trying to account for it as the other's; you can only calculate what each individually is doing
it should also be noted, however, that dairy is equally a byproduct of beef, because to produce milk the cows have to be kept pregnant fairly often and those are the beef cows
but it's still like, slightly higher than a pig's meat-efficiency, IIRC
dairy is significantly lower environmental impact because you can get a lot more milk than meat from a single cow
and the average person who's non-voting and generally just ... doesn't care? isn't going to be making any such efforts. If anything they might start eating more meat as the price comes down with reduced demand
there's going to be plenty who reduce but you need to make changes with the lowest common denominator to really change things
only one and a half? optimistic
yes

article says unexploded WW2 ordnance, headline is trying to create more panic by implying it could be terrorism or such

so if it appears multiple times from convergent evolution, when one is directly produced and another is processed from food ... yeah, we can probably find a chemical way to do it. Particularly since it's a liquid, so there's no physical structure to replicate
doesn't come from breasts, obviously, but the pocket they store stuff to throw up later for the babies actually processes it in a similar way
don't just use them for everything blindly
yep microwaves are wild
also time depends on how much water
It's unlikely to happen because it needs very specific circumstances, but they can happen by luck in a microwave. A kettle by design prevents it
you'll also have zero warning it just looks like a normal cup of water
most of the time it'll be fine but severe burns when it suddenly isn't means it's not worth the risk
https://youtu.be/1_OXM4mr_i0?t=43 they unfortunately tested this really early so quality is ass but
(which is one of the ways to make it much safer)
if you need to do something like milk, just do it really carefully on a gentle heat and keeping an eye on the temperature, and put in something like a wooden skewer
there are ways to do it safely but it's not really worth the effort, an electric kettle is like $20 or less, just get one
then as soon as it's disturbed everything that should have boiled will flash-boil instantly
you can supersaturate the water so it doesn't boil even though it ends up well above boiling point
(also any other relatively pure liquids like alcohol)
while it's hardly the most concerning thing in the video, with the last one she should probably mention that you should avoid water in the microwave in general, it's super-dangerous
~~I mean I caught the original unvaccinated and was over it in 2-3 days so a week might be pessimistic~~
that's a pretty reliable way of getting people working
instead of a free switch they could try pay more
most places don't bother clarifying themselves beyond the simple name
Or just "Taiwan"
so counterintuitively loads of hawaiians are very familiar with snow 'cause they'll just go get some when it's too hot
from someone I know in hawaii I hear you can basically just go up the mountain any time of year and load up a pickup truck with snow
well yeah people ain't gonna be happy with wages dropping without significant deflation
also consider in the US that the population has just very abruptly been reduced measurably so not only was $15 already out of date the minimum's just boosted way more than it should
though you do also need to make sure anything like that is *visible* to start getting interest
which is still below $15 which is what it should've been years ago
you could just throw them on an old box in the corner and leave them
I'm thinking tiny single servers for friend groups
oh massive networks, sure
the only way you're beating discord's uptime is with an IRC server because those are so stupid simple it's almost impossible for them to go down
often more like 95%
it's a massive network with 99.99% uptime versus single servers with like, at best 99.5%
the convenience is the killer. As long as the core features exist, minor adjustments are irrelevant
neither of them was anywhere near as convenient as discord. Or even IRC, for that matter, which is why they lost

wtf u doin
... we already had that it's called patreon, discord
no-one's been talking about a doctor to actually perform it
I think that would be very situational and would not blame any doctor for not wanting to approve that
If it's legal at all it's going to be asked about for many more than just the most extreme circumstances
Which is one case, and where I'd hope most doctors would agree to allow it, I can also fully agree they should be allowed to object & refer
some relevant moral questions can apply to both but "answering" one does not guarantee you have an answer to the other, in either direction
While I don't intend to bring a full discussion on it back, I fully disagree that abortion and assisted dying are comparable. In one a doctor refusing is forcing someone to *ruin* themselves and their lives by denying their bodily autonomy, in the other the doctor is preventing such
maybe heard about their vaccine requirements
with Q craziness though I would agree there's a significant chance they thought fox was too left-wing
it could be (but is unlikely) random targeting and they felt the big centre one was too watched
lightbulb sockets have some intentional standardisation and USB standardisation is entirely intentional
plus no-one gathered to intentionally drop the others there. people just started picking the easier option
except arm and risc-v exist
I can think of two instances and only one of them is strong; lightbulb sockets and micro-USB/USB-C adoption
it's more likely to be targeted but an attack is far more likely to be successful on random dude's basement computer vs whole datacentre
a) according to what? b) they were without it for less than two years which is a fairly trivial length of time to burn venture capital while you build a userbase and work out what the monetisation is going to be
the assumption that your data is automatically being sold only holds for services that there aren't a significant number of people actively paying for
that said discord is doing a lot of dumb desperate stuff these dayas
"This can't really happen when you set up your own server on your own infrastructure or some that you are renting" except it can and was probably more likely to happen on teamspeak. Data's a dime a million these days, selling private data would not be particularly profitable for discord in comparison to nitro money, teamspeak was making much less profit
I'm not sure she'd know what to do with polish money
it's just utter chaos while they try reconnect
and tbf the servers do usually stay up in a netsplit
and the point of chinese room situation is that if it's able to respond in every situation you can come up with, you can only conclude it's intelligent. That revises if you can find new situations, but only if
And humans don't have flaws in new situations? The point of an AGI is adaptability
Then you'll find that out fairly quickly
If it can pass any test of its intelligence - it's intelligent
And so what if it is?
you can trivially work that out by asking them totally tangential questions
Chinese room, there's no difference between these two things. If you can't tell it's not an intelligent being, it's an intelligent being
I don't think it is by refinement of current AI, at least in terms of just tweaking what we currently have. Some of the components may remain the same, but it will most likely involve completely replacing most of the supporting systems with other modifiable & learning components, letting it determine its own goals more like how living things do
Which isn't something that can be expressed as a goal function the way current ML is focussed on
Many, possibly even most things, were made without a specific purpose, just to see what we could do, then we found purposes
so we don't invent the internet then?
When the goal is human-like AI you have to ask such assumptions apply to humans
Does a human have goals in that way?
they may have goals they *want* as an individual, but programming them for a task defeats the point
general
that's what the G is
the whole point of AGI is to not have specific goals
problem solved
with ML, just design actually good goals. AGI, don't be a dick to them
ML AI, sure, but asimov's looking at the AGI level
so the solution is quite easy: unions
the point of asimov's stories were both that the laws were hopelessly insufficient and unnecessary, because a truly intelligent being doesn't actually have much reason to need them unless we're being a dick to them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu56xVlZ40M alternative similar example
if you introduce physics to AI optimisation issues it will almost always optimise into exploiting a bug
even with the 0th law
His own stories are all about how even if you could program them, they don't work from a fundamental basis anyway
pattern-learning robots end up discriminatory because they're fed discriminatory data because no-one wants to put the effort into making good data, just grab whatever exists
at the level we're talking about that's only as likely as it is for any actual human, since we're talking about human-level AIs
you wouldn't be able to make absolute rules anyway because if it has complex thought, how are you defining the rules? Do you understand the way it thinks? 100%, such that you can be sure it can't just interpret around the rules? "To be 'human' is to be considered caring, so the fact no-one cares about the planetary destruction happening enough to stop it means none of them are human", etc
the whole point of asimov's stories is to point out that the rules don't work

in the latter case decriminalising would be a very bad idea
hmmm this is a weird one. I would question whether, if cases like these are *actually* getting pushed as DV, are actually just one-off occasions or just the only occasion that they could get the police to visit for
oblivion AI doesn't look like intelligence though, it just looks like simple agents picking strange tasks that raise the needs
nevermind that oblivion wasn't and kind of learning, it was just a list of needs and if below threshold, do task to raise need
"a large set of goals" is very different to "is a totally independent thing that learns on its own and chooses its own goals"
Oblivion's out of control basic-needs AI is very different to AGI
if they're trying to massively underpay workers they have big business attitude and they can go all the same
yes that's where his significant starting wealth came from
even under the "most influential" pretense fuckin' bojo did more than elongated muskrat this year
what did he even do this year tho. I could maybe understand a few years ago when tesla and spaceX hype were peaking but ... what even happened? I can only remember him causing a couple cryptocurrencies to inflate so he could cash in on the bubble he created and announcing a vastly overpriced kid's toy to distract from the fact cybertruck still doesn't have a release (or a good looking body shell)

last updated 3 days ago so article is present
gonna be real funny if it doesn't happen
wiki still says 2021 (planned)
ooor supposed to be this year?
this dumb thing was this year in a fairly transparent attempt to distract from that fact
that was yeeeeeeeeeears ago now and still isn't out nor has a sign of being out soon
I mean yeah but so did jeff and everyone else up there
even if you do believe his dumb ideas are innovative ... what did he do this year
that's not even this year tho
someone should buy a neon yellow tesla and park it outside tesla HQ
～innovation～
oh yeah tesla factories are massive OSHA violations with loads of safety issues not marked out
being put under is very weird, so I can't talk to whether that's normal but weird things happening is definitely a thing

Omicron definitely is affected by the vaccine, it's just that it has an easier time infecting while being much less likely to be life-threatening

also hormesis isn't an unsupported theory but there's no way these guys are scientifically working on that
tbf they're not being open about what it is
it's probably added though a) so that they actually have something to point to to say it's not just a lump of plastic, b) they probably get paid to take it off someone's hands and selling it is the most profitable continuation
and when absorbed it forms negative ions
that's not even an argument it is
this was apparently added because of concerns but it solves nothing if they don't do it on androids
it's not a hivemind style thing where it alerts the nearest, it's just the phone going "huh, that one's not mine, we've gone a long way, and I don't recognise it. Everything ok?"
comments indicate that your own iphone can tell if it's finding the same tag multiple times and alert you, but this obviously only works with iphones
have people found a way to access the tracking of someone else's tag?
or kill kickstarter
this still includes a possible suggestion that it might only be calling it bad if you do it to boys which is kinda fucked up but also expected for the time
I mean it also says "as with a woman" so you can also interpret it as if you're a top with women you need to bottom for guys
and that information is "it's any time except winter"
actually, we have slight information about when in the year it would be based on what is described as happening in the fields on the journey to bethlehem
before covid proved we need people willing to wear them the fear was people would be overconfident with them and defeat the point + consume all the supply so none would be left. Turns out only one half of that ended up true anyway
unfortunately covid showed how selfish many people are so they believe if the mask doesn't help they shouldn't wear it
masks do help reduce your odds of contracting as well. That they don't was a story spread before covid to prevent people hoarding them because they're far from perfectly effective, but any barrier helps
personal earphones generally won't but a speaker makes more sense for people to swap between
Depends on the device, but many, yes
airtags aren't doing that, since they need to be ultra-low-power
so the phone can receive that and add it to the list
because those devices are actively transmitting their ID for things to find
bluetooth on the phone is entirely passive under normal behaviour
it's aware of stuff transmitting, but it's only listening. air tags need a transmit to respond to, because they're so low-power
bluetooth's default behaviour is to completely ignore devices it's not paired with?
this however needs to actively ping the airtag because the tag gets its power that way
the way bluetooth detects devices is by listening, not actively scanning, and the earphone/etc will emit a ping when it wants to connect, phone goes "oh, I know that one" and wake up then
bluetooth doesn't auto-refresh on its own
and even if they do ... it requires you to keep bluetooth on, which there's definitely reasons not to do
wake up one morning it's 300,000, go make a coffee and some idiot fat-fingered it so it's 3,000 with no recourse to reverse the transaction
if you have disposable income to spare you can still try ride a bubble or two but you won't make crazy ratios, it needs existing money and you need to avoid crashes

surprising it took this long
like being unable to revise or remove incorrect data
the whole argument in favour is the supposed provability and if it lacks that it's pointless with many more disadvantages
you just have to manage your own offline files and only specifically upload duplicates to protect your files
then what? your stuff's still deleted and your losses individually are nothing for a lawyer to take the case pro bono
which you can't be sure it won't
not if the app detects you're banned and deletes it all before you notice
discord nitro has 4x bigger file limits than email lol
it's a blockhead do you expect non-bizarre takes

they're also hosted on centralised servers

therefore none of the contracts are legally enforceable until *after* tested in a court of law
Because they are specifically written into law as being such *with* particular restrictions on what is a reasonable contract, none of which exists for anything blockchain
since patching is almost always differential from the last version
though I think *not* hosting every patch revision would actually fall afoul of this as it would likely mean old versions cannot be successfully fully updated
in the EU there's a specific allowance for all software to be legally modified if it does not work correctly, specifically to allow white-hat hacking. Though the latter part is a requirement for it to be legal
also *most* remasters are actually worthwhile
that's not most of the time it was just particularly notable recently with the GTA remasters
also it took years but that *has* eventually been rereleased almost everywhere
any cases like that are the result of the publisher rather than steam so far though
any contracts on blockchain will only be meaningful if you can legally enforce them and you can only legally enforce them if the law recognises them. so they're not gonna be any different lol
you own the disc and the singular copy of the files on it and a license to play those files

also seems dubious that he's claiming it crashed on the far side of the estimated arc while adding a bunch of loops that other models wouldn't be assuming
I have no idea what anomaly you were supposed to be noticing in that sample given
banks and investment companies are also against you getting your account hacked and the money drained, just because they're against a thing doesn't make it good
It was supposed to migrate years ago so I'll believe that when it happens and they don't move back within the year
and PoS still doesn't fix the "rich get richer" issue; it in fact exacerbates it
you keep saying most networks are PoS but most trading is still etherium which still isn't
all of this is possible via the steam item system already at no developer cost and also no added environmental cost
If coal plants are running, it is not excess energy
Even if it is from hydro (questionable), the fact that hydro is being used for this garbage means it's not available for actually useful purposes and so old coal plants are kept open to provide that necessary power, and so it is 100% valid to calculate their impact as being directly from coal, as they cause that energy generation from coal either directly or indirectly.
the construction has to be paid for
how do you remove the human component from construction
literally, in many cases
we need more mass infrastructure now the population's bigger and all the stuff built then's collapsing
vote for the people who don't do that
then vote because it's deregulation prior to 2008 that caused it
if it can't be tampered with then checking is irrelevant. and also presumes anyone who can recognise the issues would be interested in stopping them instead of profiting off them
and algorithms are always flawless yes
the subprime scam can't be automated against, it's real assets and the vulnerability was the middle class being disproportionately willing to just abandon second houses and therefore crash the housing market
Doge's got shit value *because* it's algorithmically stable

I do agree with lank that the national institutions are generally very pro-nationalism, but local institutions are much less so and the state of those national institutions are due to just a few old boomers that are hard to remove from their positions
The reporting about text books supposedly denying things is in regard to a single publisher of about 14 that also hardly gets used
> Subsequently, the New History Textbook was used by only 0.039% of junior high schools in Japan as of August 15, 2001. According to the Society, there are currently eight private junior high schools, one public school for the disabled in Tokyo, three public junior high schools and four public schools for the disabled in Ehime that use their textbook (Mainichi Shimbun, September 27, 2004).
The fact so many using it are also schools for the disabled makes me highly suspect that they're being paid to use it, given how often disabled schools are chronically under-funded
Japan does not generally deny things, at least outside of right-wing boomers, but the bland education means a lot of people may forget it was taught
> A comparative study begun in 2006 by the Asia–Pacific Research Center at Stanford University on Japanese, Chinese, Korean and US textbooks describes 99% of Japanese textbooks as having a "muted, neutral, and almost bland" tone and "by no means avoid some of the most controversial wartime moments" like the Nanjing massacre or to a lesser degree the issue of comfort women. The project, led by Stanford scholars Gi-Wook Shin and Daniel Sneider, found that less than one percent of Japanese textbooks used provocative and inflammatory language and imagery, but that these few books, printed by just one publisher, received greater media attention. Moreover, the minority viewpoint of nationalism and revisionism gets more media coverage than the prevailing majority narrative of pacifism in Japan. Chinese and South Korean textbooks were found to be often nationalistic, with Chinese textbooks often blatantly nationalistic and South Korean textbooks focusing on oppressive Japanese colonial rule. US history textbooks were found to be nationalistic and overly patriotic, although they invite debate about major issues.[23][24]

Japan's bigger conviction issue is the lack of both reporting and prosecution of sexual crimes, and if anything being too willing to drop cases if the evidence is flimsy
Taking the same *type* of conviction rate, America's also in the 90%+ range. The figure quoted from japan is "likelihood of conviction *if the case reaches a judge's decision instead of being dropped*". Of the countries I found figures for when researching this (russia, china, US, canada and UK), I believe only canada and the UK were not around 90% or higher, with the lowest being 80% for the UK.

If you take "number of cases brought to court at all, including those where charges were dropped", which is what is usually quoted for other countries, the others I found figures for ranged from 60% (uk, canada) to 80% (US) or still over 90% (russia, china). However, Japan had *less than 40%*, literally one of the lowest in the world. You're not actually very likely to be convicted of something in japan
731's members were on the docket to be tried and there's no way they would've survived without american intervention
it should be noted that in the tokyo war crime trials 2/3 of those who were going to be brought before the court, were, and almost all of them executed in trials that *the prosecution* called a farce. If the US hadn't intervened it's very unlikely *any* japanese war criminals would have even survived

I would point out the article *does* use unnecessarily complimentary language of hitler's regime in some places;
> What Adolf Hitler & Co. did to Germany in less than six years was applauded wildly and ecstatically by most Germans. He lifted the nation from post-War defeatism. Under the swastika Germany was unified. His was no ordinary dictatorship, but rather one of great energy and magnificent planning. The "socialist" part of National Socialism might be scoffed at by hard-&-fast Marxists, but the Nazi movement nevertheless had a mass basis. The 1,500 miles of magnificent highways built, schemes for cheap cars and simple workers' benefits, grandiose plans for rebuilding German cities made Germans burst with pride.

so spinlaunch is actually having to pursue the difficult part on their own
if hyperloop was also designed to leave vacuum at high speed, sure, but I don't think anyone's looking at that
easier to abort, much smaller structure
If you're assuming only solid payloads, sure, but in that case I'd again say spinlaunch is a more viable option
and that's a *huge* structure to site and build
Issue is they're expensive and get so little velocity though. If you assume the tube is 20 km long and has a constant acceleration of 5g, you still only get up to 1500 m/s
people don't think very far ahead when they get tech-stars in their eyes
"looks cool" but only in animations because you can't actually see inside a steel tube
spinlaunch is a potentially viable alternative for solid payloads, but for anything with low G limits (like humans) should be far more interested in a launch loop
long launch tubes isn't really a great idea for space launch, it takes too much length to actually get a helpful speed
aeious in chat
it is much less deadly, but on the other hand less dead does mean more survivors taking space in ICU

it still suffers from data loss
magnetic tape is still seriously used because it has vastly higher density than anything else
probably even some industries where the PC doing that job is still running so why replace it
it's *definitely* still in use in several universities in the west too
cancer used to be natural causes
"natural causes" is a catch-all for "we don't understand it yet"

if a transmission array could theoretically put that much power density down as to start fires, it'd definitely be in violation of any treaties
most games are still just for fun
it really isn't anyway. there's a couple gambling games that are almost definitely illegal but not reported yet and esports
it certainly wouldn't be trivial work to make sure it's safe and cover all failure cases, but it doesn't have to be "anything goes wrong and the whole area's on fire"
not necessarily. One proposal I've seen is to transmit in high-radio/low-microwave range and use a sparse receiver over greenhouses/some other kind of plantation that doesn't use large vehicles for harvesting. Gives a large enough area that it's not actually a vast energy density being transmitted in the first place and there's choice wavelengths in that range that reflect off most common materials (including plants, concrete and dirt)
any actually viable one would have to be *physically* restricted to wavelengths and focal areas that entirely prevent such
that may be a reason it was popular as a wall decoration map but the reason it was made is because it preserves direction, which is rather important for navigation
with computer assistance you can do great circles which are better but if that may be unavailable you need mercator for the backup charts so that you can easily plot courses
mercator is necessary to exist however as it allows simplified navigation
I agree with mel that it's a good thing that authors *could* potentially make a living from fanfics if they're good and people are willing to read them. And yes - would anyone care about literature that isn't part of the authorised canon, even without legal enforcement?
and people who can't be vaccinated due to immunocompromisation?
it's a super cheap way to produce content which gets clicks

I suspect that's a sub-brand of ny mag. granted i don't know much about them either
they may have a smaller market share now but they were historically over 85%, and do you really think new competitors would not want to keep the pie massively over-inflated?
*four* digits is insane inflation
jewelry diamonds would be 1-2 digits value if used industrially
diamonds are not even close to rare, like 1% of diamonds that exist enter the market, De Beers hoards them and only lets them out slowly to artificially control the price
In a hundred years probably a few could die out and be replaced entirely, but that's also a long period to predict over (or even presume anyone'll still be alive). 50, only a couple generations, isn't quite enough to entirely kill off local languages I tihnk
iceland being a possible exception if the above is accurate, most countries will most likely still have their local language but with a *lot* of english vocab or hybrid grammar incorporated
Probably none, though they may get heavily anglicised
though there's a further argument that if it came to english *via* germanic it probably should be counted as native, even if the original origin is greek or latin
since the original anglo speakers were germanic I'd argue that slice is the "not externally influenced" one, but that does still leave it at 74% external

it's only 1.3 km so if it weren't in america I'd just say make em walk it
unless you get a very rich deluded man to do it for you
oh it was originally a cable railway but got electrified, and is notable for being one of very few 4ft gauge railways
isn't the glasgow metro a stationary engine cable line?
but the underground doesn't have a road cutting through a huge volume
the tunnel diameter is larger than the london underground

I know they've ruined getting trains in there by raising the floor with the road, but what safety standards are they failing?

because they've gone too long without consequences
even on JR-maglev the issue isn't *too* bad since it's the latter. More involved than track, but you can have just one section that moves instead of replacing the whole thing
in the former ... unless your train is *very* floppy, you can't make the track bigger
the geometry issue of "train goes around rail" instead of "rail goes around train". In the latter, you just make the rail too big and have a moving block that cuts away the bit you don't need
(no explanation of how you get it on top at the end)
it was proposed for new york as a narrow train that could run down narrow alleys, with two-way running done by putting another on top of the top rail
yes
I think "offline system" means "not an 'AR sphere'"; ie, you can just use it as a display around you instead of on your phone & get standard messages and such there
not the same word
so there's also no security on this thing? fantastic sounds great
the whole point of a ledger is to be able to track a history. That's what a ledger *is*
no, because a ledger *will* be used to track people, so any case where something *might* fail is not equivalent
it's not maybe -> let's not, it's *will* -> let's not
no it's like saying "every nuclear bomb that's been detonated has caused a massive explosion so let's not detonate any more"
Even in the theoretical case there this *worked* and the ledger was anonymous and untrackable, they'd just keep using their own tracking methods
nevermind that even if they couldn't get info from this public ledger ... they'll still just keep making their own private ledgers, then
which was proven in the 00's
like google search results do
until the information becomes large enough to be uniquely identifiable
so instead of google tracking privately in ways that can be countered everything is tracked in a public ledger?
it was "hey I can aim for *particular* hashes that's neat"
there was no intention to the technology
IF it's not related to *anything* else and never has been - yes
so what's the advantage over this over just sending randomised fake browser data?
because everyone has a unique pattern of concerns
none of that is necessary. Just from a list of the actual text of the searches, you can identify almost everyone if you get their search history
this is why something as innocuous as google searches has to be stored securely
If it's readable, it's personally identifiable
If it's private to one person, it's centralised. If you share it, it's instantly not private
for it to not be possible to know who made a change, it can't be authorised. If it's authorised, you know it's someone with that authority
except when stuff like doge goes ahead and proves you can
there are many, and the most common one would be "do you have the thing"
proof of *an* idea of ownership
does that in any way trigger automatically on something that was produced *with* this, but is entirely distinct from the actual NFT? If not that's no different from vocaloid with a different business model (and their business model is somewhat questionable as I don't believe most of the VAs do get royalties from sales)
technically "the rights" to using it but even if that does turn out to be legally enforcible it's a nonsense business model. You can give exclusivity to one person for optimistically, 5 figures, or you can sell it to a 5-6 figure number of people for $20 each, then add in rereleases and oh that's why the vocaloid model works and this one's clearly a scam
probably a bunch of shareholders will have automated responses with the recommendation and doing these would undercut their profits
https://twitter.com/spacekookie/status/1481604901344002057
every load just makes a better habit, if you're someone who can actually form that kind of habit
s'probably fine like that
and it seems like so many people don't even know it's a thing, even though letting it build up can be a fire hazard
probably clogged filter if you just moved into somewhere. clear that before it starts a fire
the royalties of interest with a production tool like a modern vocaloid *would* be the ones of "selling a product made using it", though
the royalties can only really cover the NFT itself as that's then a self-contained system - it can pay back when resold, but it can't do anything about someone delinking a use of it and then selling that use separately
which *does* however appear to be what they're trying to offer here, unless I'm really missing something
it ultimately offers no protection that current laws do not, since you're ultimately always subject to people trying to screw you over
On the original point though - I don't see how the NFT voices could possibly stop someone from just creating something using the voice, creating the recording separately so the NFT has no possible awareness of royalties owed, and selling that product
Just reading on that now, there's certainly some earlier mints that might've had some level of legal tender laws applied to them, but the modern use traces back to merchants in the early half of the last millennium I believe
"international" is probably confusing things by scale, I think the roman currency would probably be one of the earliest "national" currencies - it's bigger than "the silversmith in town owes me this" but it's not (officially) cross-border
but it is where common law understandings and "you *must* accept this payment" started
It's not the first instance of currency, no - the first cases (that are known) were IIRC roman armies being given the coinage, and then taxes being collected in that form, so it effectively forced the populace to supply their armies by trading with them to get the coins
fun fact in middle ages-or-so times merchants would do this with basically IOU tokens that would only be accepted in their own shop, and that was a major motivating factor in centralising currency and creating the concept of "legal tender" - money that *must* be considered acceptable payment, by law, so no merchant can say "hmmmm no you gotta pay with tokens, but if you don't have any I could sell you some right now at inflated prices!"

it's already doing that, bitcoin alone outweighs all solar power worldwide by a significant margin
fair enough
ah I thought you meant "lower energy than fuels"
fuel as in more general energy stores, such as petrol
also explosives tend to be lower energy than fuels, though I don't know how high vs low compares. The restrictions that molecules which can detonate impose actually reduces the total overall energy that can be released
the same molecules in a different structure can be high vs low, but yeah, it's not a simple "just mix them in a different order"
until eventually it runs out of energy to keep that speed up and drops to a regular at-sonic pressure wave
and shockwaves are slightly supersonic (or extremely for ex. nukes in close proximity). The wave is compressed and that compression means its speed of sound is faster, so it keeps impacting the new air without spreading its initial pressure rise
correct
granted the antipode is actually the best place to detect the pressure wave at a distance since it re-focusses

while designer babies have a whole host of other issues around how they might be used they could be used to specifically select the most-varied genes each parent offers to counteract a narrow gene pool
isolated communities don't have a choice pretty much no-one *isn't* cousins
nobility "kept it in the family" for centuries
as I said, multiple generations
multiple generations of such make it more likely, but a single generation is nothing more than a blip
our culture in the west is generally against even cousins, but if there's no prior generations of inbreeding cousins are as genetically similar as friends are on average - and you are most likely to marry a friend, ergo a cousin is not actually more similar and not more likely to cause defects
that's not what mel was saying she was saying that your standards of when it's "wrong" (not if, when, what level of relation) depends on your culture
I don't think it's just because of the odds of genetic defects, it's also because such a relationship is so much more likely to be manipulative or abusive for that situation to even begin arising, assuming they actually grew up together
there's plenty of even breeds known for being obedient that will just not listen because they have a thing they want to do
dogs are hardly *consistently* well behaved in a way that's anything to do with genetics rather than training
understanding what you're selecting, and getting it into a foetus, is another matter
the selection in gattaca is absolutely possible today. fully custom genetic strains are possible and not even particularly expensive I believe

the fact they have a how-to page literally telling you how I'd say makes that especially strong
if you found out later then it's weaker
If you bought the product because you knew this was possible though, you'd have a very strong argument in court
and even with those factors it was largely some rich people playing around with it as a curiosity who wondered if there was a practical application

what's a 30 gun ship gonna do against an RN ship, again?
heck the HMS Temeraire in the battle of trafalgar 1v3'd ships from Napoleon's navy for most of the battle
a thirty-gunner is nothing, nevermind that the crew training is needed too. 80-100 gunners were standard in the RN's main forces and they could take on 120+ gunners from continental powers

possibly just the act of laying down the track at speed is causing more damage than is saved by creating its own road surface then
more wear in a spin, possibly less surface wear when travelling. But if it's an MBT then the sheer weight density is going to cause more damage to the foundation
actually I wonder how tracks would factor in
but fourth power is the best approximation that's used by road designers
tbf it is an approximation so it can be more or less; going slower will reduce the wear, the vehicle being built with more tyres reduces it (but it doesn't ever become linear with ground pressure because a single large vehicle has more internal stresses and is more affected by factors like wind causing torsion on the road surface)
hmmm it's been a while since I checked but I think they'd probably get like 5 tolls out of a kidney
none of the logistics companies would
well, car drivers would
yep. No-one would accept tolls that actually reflect the relative costs of each; even if you add in each driver paying a perfectly-equal proportion of the passive wear-over-time
also re: trucks being "okay"; road maintenance induced increases to the fourth power of the weight of the vehicle, a 40 tonne truck causes literally 10,000 times more wear than even a chonky 4-tonne SUV (or regular weight delivery van). Pretty much all large road freight should be eliminated except for oversize loads (since rail lines can't be easily re-gauged for ex. a wind turbine blade to be transported)
the EU does have regulation on headphone noise, so far as it's actually possible to given headphones are an analogue device. It's not a hard limit because the power-volume translation of a given headset can't be known and therefore it can be bypassed, but warnings are required
they point to climate far moreso than us/russia relations? Granted they do mention the latter more than is realistically warranted, but they don't posit that as the primary

though a search finds that some urban explorers claim to have broken into the transmission station and it's largely abandoned, so it's theoretically possible someone got in there and attached their own signal injection
It depends where it's being recorded from to put it on the internet. With shortwave radio that could be almost anywhere in the world, and the competing transmission only needs to be close to the receiver
there's no security on it it's just an open broadcast that can be received most places in the world
it's an analog signal, some guys probably just found where it's being recorded from and started transmitting their own signal nearby
did ... did they push the other controversies *down* to add those
colonialism is the direct cause of worldwide problems with exploitation of developing nations, but capitalism is the one that demands that exploitation happens
hell it's just an extension of the same mentality driving the military-industrial complex which was also occurring during colonialism and IIRC there's even some influence of it in roman conquest
it was at that point decades ago
bad actors will also explicitly create systems to cooperate in order to undermine, thus the stance of "do not have a system" fails because the bad actors are much more efficient since they have one
thus having a system which creates that job makes it much harder for bad actors
the biggest flaw is not simply that the bad actors exist but that without a system they can't be detected and countered by good & neutral actors. Neutral actors will tend to ignore it until it's a major problem, *unless* it's explicitly their job to counter them

you can only get these by actually going to the real place and picking up the actual thing
all of which ... isn't provided by this VR shopping experience they propose
Like, I don't use online shopping for foodstuffs and similar, but that's also because to me it's more convenient to go out and just *have* it, immediately, no need to wait for it to arrive or deal with substitutions. I can also do things like look at best before dates or just see what's in stock without being specifically guided down their specific advertising paths

you assume they think

they like the part where they shoot black people

how do you plan to fight an abrahms sitting in front of the capital building that knows exactly where you are with thermal optics
in a US rebellion you'd be wanting to take the seats of power, which don't even have a forest within hundreds of miles
even in the american narrative of vietnam, it doesn't support an argument that a US militia could beat the US military. The vietcong were effective against the US because they could deny the use of a lot of the US's more modern weapons, due to the jungle preventing tanks and much air support, as well as allowing traps to be very well hidden
the study most likely controlled for one-off cases and looked for whether they could do it reliably
but parents probably liked it because they could use it to justify telling their kids to shut up and wait
it's supposedly that you'll be more successful if you can wait for a better option or such, but realistically success in life is so fucking random that it's irrelevant
the usual structure presented for that kind of study is have one now, or two later
it's quite justifiable to think that the country that recklessly created the problem in the first place isn't going to do a very clean job of ending it
the US created al-quaeda in the first place. and not in a "oh they created the circumstances" way they quite directly funded and supported him. they just got annoyed when he did something to white people
yes, but you did also say china is the better option, which I'm not convinced by
I would be hesistant to go with "clearly china is a better option for siding with because only their internal policies are bad" because you don't know when they will decide they want you to be internal
They are significantly but not 100% self-sufficient, they still leave the base regularly to buy things or just see the area
being forced to host a military base that mainly just brings more people who'll spend money on the local economy seems a lot less bad than invasion and total removal of autonomy that china flirts with on its border
how many were conducted in situations of "okay there's no way the world situation deteriorated that quickly this is definitely a drill"
china is definitely not reliant; even if they lost russian coal, they've demonstrated their willingness to do aggressive power rationing
china kept a very careful balance to say that they won't interfere but russia better not try anything with them
also everything I'm hearing about russia itself says that the general populace has almost no support of putin or this nonsense, why the fuck would ukraine support it any more
and oxygen is the most common but that's not our typical source of it
"silicon" is being used as shorthand for processor chips
in modern production no country is self-sufficient. They'd maybe be able to "get by" if they were just being screwed over by the international community and had to survive but they need to keep advanced and complex production high
ireland has yes but it's not much right now when people are struggling to even get out of the country
https://twitter.com/sandumaiamd/status/1496859315122147337
historically, yes, but there's now much better communication and people have more opportunity to realise "hey uuuh everyone we know doesn't support this should we just ... not?"
tbf historically only like 20% of people *at most* have been willing and okay with killing in war and modern militaries have to work heavily against that, so especially with the selection bias of a recon platoon it's not that surprising to get that many who are all entirely willing to surrender
I would defer to lone's estimation
but it is indicative that russia has not successfully fed all its troops kool-aid which will be a continuous issue with them trying to push in against hard resistance
the whole brigade would be big news and need a lot of confirmation but I'm seeing apparently a recon platoon, so it's probably legit and just not as significant as it sounds
russia invading is not such a global issue and so it does not take the same disruption to fall apart
and a lot of them did end up being forced to have changes, but they don't last when the global hegemony didn't change and this issue is the global hegemony
plus, yes, that
I'm seeing that spain got like 1%

possibly, unconfirmed the state of it
ukraine apparently shelling it with artillery
that's the airport that's still in active combat
it's conservative due to the amount of disinformation going on, it's not likely to be much further solidly taken
they were hardly among the largest protests there have been. Historically a protest needs to reach around 3% of the population taking part before it becomes unsustainable to ignore or try suppress it

finland responded that they're ready to consider joining "for defensive purposes" but that part was left off russian language reporting to clearly try stoke anti-nato sentiments
and finland has historically proven itself very resistant
there's probably already concerns in that way with how wide the opposition to it is
it's also not specifically anti-russia in any phrasing but it accepted everyone who was scared of russia

> Restoration of the aircraft, known as Mriya, will take more than five years at a cost of over $3 billion following the attack, Ukroboronprom said in a statement dated Sunday, adding that it aimed to ensure Russia covers the costs.
but it'll be out of commission for a few years at least
it's entirely possible it might be restorable, especially if they're willing to merge it with the mothballed airframe

it was confirmed by ukrainian officials, so likely is true
I don't know if I'd immediately lean so far on that rather than him being crazy, but I would be 100% unsurprised if it turned out he had terminal cancer
but when the people you're ordering to fight won't, that's a bit of an issue for them
money doesn't matter as much to crazed dictators
the latter is where I see the weakness
and hopefully it doesn't make american warhawks too cocky that a major rival is shown somewhat impotent
the one positive I'd say *could* be taken away from the whole situation is it feels like war is already way less tenable than it used to be. People won't stand for it, even in your own military - hopefully that will slowly start spreading to when the war's against people who aren't white
my thought would be "I would expect a response to that" but idk how that message app behaves so it could be there's one off-screen. I would say that damaging a phone to fake that (though it could be already damaged) would be expensive for little gain in a warzone

a russian billionaire would be one who gets that rich without being invited to the kremlin
even if plenty of them definitely are oligarchs
I would possibly add that oligarchs are a clear list of those who have similar & high influence because they clearly have these meetings while billionaires could in theory at least be paying less attention and therefore not influencing *as* much as others

so yeah, probably only hold back any dislike when there's cheap weapons on offer
I doubt the taliban like russia in a general sense, except for when they have cheap weapons to offer
given there seems to be a fire beforehand I'd be inclined to say "former with maybe both"?
though given that all of ukraine isn't highlighted I wouldn't bet on them stopping yet
a small detachment but russian-aligned, at least
apparently the highlighted part of moldova has been under control of russian troops since the fall of the USSR anyway
https://theaviationist.com/2022/03/01/col-oksanchenko-shot-down/ okay the dude's real but yeah this is the rumour being collated with something unrelated
then there's this but I wouldn't trust facebook and that's a sukhoi

I'm not clear, I thought there was some indication they were spreading something else they heard
so who knows
but one of the images circulating is a guy in front of a sukhoi when he was supposedly a mig pilot
there's some current resurging talk that the ghost was real and possibly recently shot down but I've not seen anything confirmable
cringe
perhaps
ex. when a vehicle in the convoy moving to kyiv breaks down they don't just shove it off the road and keep moving they bunch behind it and make themselves super-vulnerable
it seems like even later waves aren't really being told to be properly prepared
especially if it's something like brain cancer and the tumour's making him stupider
as we see more of the chaos though part of me's coming around to the "putin's on death's door" theory. He's apparently super-paranoid about getting covid, there seems to have been no real organisation to this - it's definitely a long way off proven, but him having cancer would explain so much
but in russia a lot probably join because "it's a job"
as far as I'm aware there wouldn't have been any extra draft, this would just be the standing army
in what world does it make sense to not have your convoy prepared for combat

"we were told Zelensky has already capitulated and we need just to drive to Kyiv" if legit the russian situation is ... *wildly* confused

napoleon was mocked for being short because he looked short because (on his insistence) his personal guard were all giants well over 6 ft

petrol's -40 to -60 depending on the grade and even lower depending on the additives
apparently petrol would be fine but diesel has big problemos
> There are also a lot of different types of diesel fuel, but the "pour point" might fall in a range between -6°C and -18°C (*), although these values can be lowered with additives. The pour point is the temperature at which diesel turns into a sort of jell which can no longer be pumped, so it's essentially useless as an automotive fuel at, or below, those temperatures.
though it's definitely flirting with the limits
pretty sure the freezing point of petrol is well below -15
not the person I expected to tweet such a thing but

is this in russia or ukraine?
yeah, it states the wings are off to the side somewhere and
> Ready to roll: All the essential components of the second An-225's superstructure have been manufactured, including the fuselage, wings, nose gear and tail.
I just can't see where
might be able to take parts of the wings of this one then, though I wonder if they just have the wings hidden somewhere else given it's not mentioned in descriptions of the second
but there's probably salvageable stuff still
descriptions of the state of the second imply the airframe is complete but it needs internal systems & engines
assuming the second airframe isn't also damaged
probably cheaper to complete the second airframe if 2011 estimates of $300m and 3 years work were accurate
well that's gonna be spensive
<:ohno:805152666841251870>
that makes more sense than "cats and dogs"
small, hard and sharp knife - heavy rain
so reading around it's likely that russian & ukranian diesel will be good to around -20 to -22, but that's about the limit

circumstances point to something being up
like, he could just be a crazy dictator ... but previously he's been a bit more of a rational dictator
there's no solid evidence but there's a *lot* of circumstantial - intelligence agencies who build behavioural profiles saying he's wildly outside what they expect for him, the mile-long table to protect from covid, the fact he's not quite holding his head straight and his gait has changed (possibly points to a stroke), and the general insanity of what he's currently ordering
he's probably not right in the head now. quite a few hints pointing to there's something wrong with him; he's probably not doing it for attention, but because he's unstable
do it cowards

unlike USSR china isn't taking the "all war" stance, they're mainly getting support by providing economic support, and tying themselves to russia while putin torpedoes it is a bad idea. Support his direct opposition is an easy move that achieves all of that

the only way nestle should even be considering pulling out is if there's actually a food sanctions from the west forcing them to. As lank says, there's plenty they should go down for, but not for an essential as basic as food
there's no guarantee they have anywhere near the capacity required, and there's extremely high likelihood they depend on western products as part of the production chain
I would be extremely hesitant about saying "they have their own companies producing it so they'll be fine"
also massively biases away from progressive programs since those by default take longer than "rip it all to shreds"

it's a somewhat different situation in the military where you're surrounded by people with guns who want you to do the thing, but following orders isn't an automatic free pass
> In 2012 Australian psychologist Gina Perry investigated Milgram's data and writings and concluded that Milgram had manipulated the results, and that there was a "troubling mismatch between (published) descriptions of the experiment and evidence of what actually transpired." She wrote that "only half of the people who undertook the experiment fully believed it was real and of those, 66% disobeyed the experimenter".[23][24] She described her findings as "an unexpected outcome" that "leaves social psychology in a difficult situation."[25]
basically every psychology experiment from before 2000 is bs and most from afterwards are also. milgram experiment included

I don't remember which he means but it's obv a mecha anime

and any case where people are willing to continue for science will have the caveat of "this must have been approved ethically, right? There's no way it's actually real no matter how much I believe it."
it's far more complex than "people can detach themselves if ordered"
you get more context to this further down and it actually still weakens the original conclusions when you have context

> Building on the importance of idealism, some recent researchers suggest the "engaged followership" perspective. Based on an examination of Milgram's archive, in a recent study, social psychologists Alexander Haslam, Stephen Reicher and Megan Birney, at the University of Queensland, discovered that people are less likely to follow the prods of an experimental leader when the prod resembles an order. However, when the prod stresses the importance of the experiment for science (i.e. "The experiment requires you to continue"), people are more likely to obey.[31] The researchers suggest the perspective of "engaged followership": that people are not simply obeying the orders of a leader, but instead are willing to continue the experiment because of their desire to support the scientific goals of the leader and because of a lack of identification with the learner.[32][33] Also a neuroscientific study supports this perspective, namely that watching the learner receive electric shocks does not activate brain regions involving empathic concerns.[34]

it doesn't even try scan the file, if it's not something commonly downloaded it automatically goes "this might be dodgy"
this isn't virus protection, it's recognising the filename & hash to know "okay, this is a file that has been verified beforehand to be from a legit source"
it's also very possible that they might be trusting windows' built-in "uuuh we don't recognise this exe are you sure" now

ofc it's also possible a bad job of hiding the superior officers on the frontline might be intentional
suspicion is that russia is being so incompetent that russian generals are being forced into the frontlines, which makes them easier targets. There may be other factors like doing a bad job of hiding who the general is; other militaries generally go to a lot of effort to make everyone on the frontline look exactly the same in terms of uniform and behaviour, but russia might be screwing that up and painting targets for snipers

and fertiliser explosives need only around 6% fuel oil to be made into explosives so it's a very viable explosive as well as being cheap. Two ingredients, both available commercially in bulk

> Forensic experts later estimated that the bomb weighed 1,500–1,600 kg (3,300–3,500 lb)[30] and was a mixture of semtex, a military-grade plastic explosive, and ammonium nitrate fertiliser,[31] a cheap and easily obtainable explosive used extensively by the IRA.[32]

as much as it's a role that gets memed on because too many companies have too many of them, middle managers are more valuable to a company than the upper management
I mean that's kinda how taxation works anyway yes
https://twitter.com/quendergeer/status/1530149590640508928
a company can manage to have that info internally
like, entire country
there's countries where everyone's pay is public info
but only the former is actually sustainable
increasing product is hard, decreasing cost is easy
which would never happen
in theory if a company actually managed to evaluate people's performance correctly (very theoretical, as you can see) then promotions by performance would approximate a meritocracy, but it would only work if you could actually demote people who get promoted to the point of incompetence
it's the highest level that should actually exist in a non-exploitative company
upper management's just off doing drugs while middle management, at least in theory, is organising staff for projects to let stuff actually get done

it's still very questionable how often it would be better than pumped hydro, but unlike most gadget tech it's "how often" rather than "is it"
I'd even suggest maybe making it slightly more complicated so that the machinery sits on a tower of the concrete blocks so it can extend itself like a tower crane (within the limits of the power cables), which would improve its scalability by just delivering more blocks
it does at least have siting advantages, that you don't need local water available (Even totally unpotable) and you can build it in many more places in terms of land requirements
as gadgettech solutions go it's one of the better ones, they're just gonna have to have *really* good and really cheap tech to make it effective versus pumped hydro
concrete is denser than water and therefore offers potentially greater storage, but the mechanics of anything like this are so much more complex than "big head pump, big turbine"

most sensible assumption is to work with the idea that there will always be someone in harm's way, given this is pretty much the same failure case as a turbine disc failure in a jet engine and those have caused injuries and deaths
best case scenario you lose power from it. worst case it shatters and part of the disc saws someone's arm off
yeah that would do it for beating lithium density. just better hope it doesn't leak or crack at speed
<a:pattato:805360619091787777>
shitposting is that way vv
it is quite ... not-quite-sure-which-punk, though
they're kinda always impractical given to match lithium batteries for energy density, assuming no mechanical overheads, the wheel needs to be spinning supersonic
this aspect is less specialised nuclear physics and more the general engineering <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
(or have other uses such as desalination)
also note that even if the reactor itself couldn't be throttled, it could dump its heat as steam (and the reflectivity then potentially contributes to reducing insolation)
if nuclear was the only source and provided 100% of requirements, they'd be throttled a lot more
on the current grid reactors avoid throttling because their service life isn't affected by how much energy they generate, only how long they've been running. As such even if energy prices technically went below-cost, it's still better to remain full throttle and lowball everyone else just to make what money you can from it, so they price other baseline sources out of the market where fuel is a primary cost rather than service
power bursts on the scale of seconds are less about the reactor or boiler's capacity and more about the turbine itself and energy stored in the steam. On the scale of minutes, most reactors can throttle pretty quickly as long as the requirements aren't "completely shut off" - that's where they take weeks, because of the latent decay, but criticality can be controlled very quickly.
not really?
which is one of the issues with a renewable move, yep. Nuclear would let us keep the advantages of baseline as well as be green
baseline power often helps with the "too much power" issues though since turbines can more rapidly bleed the power on their end. Adjust the generator coupling to reduce energy transfer, move the stators & vents to bleed more energy into cooling systems instead of the turbine
possibly better than pumped hydro
they're just motors, which have good conversion
if the motors are good enough that probably wouldn't need more than one tower (though would need more than one crane). So long as at least one crane is holding a block at once it can vary its speed according to demand or supply
concrete is denser than water but you're gonna have to ask "ok but can we build a water tower that's taller?"
... though much as there's lots of options, none of them are quantifiably as available as water is
or even just a rock you found, or a bin of sand if you can program it to prioritise some to the top of stacks
also true, though there's other potential options like waste heavy metals

to be fair there is a correlation here with the company's incoming performance.

... why is there even a return ebook option. isn't there a preview on every single one?
however the conclusion is only "maybe" as an equally possible option is that some people's bodies reacted to a more mild virus that just happens to produce compatible antibodies
if accurate on the other hand, that indicates everyone basing covid spread parameters on the measured spread vastly overestimated its effect, since they measured a much faster rise than was actually present

being able to own *any* gun without a permit is dumb
uuuh doesn't switzerland have mandatory military service and when you're done you take the gun with you?
also for considering rates of violent crime UK versus switzerland: remember that *all* cities everywhere on the planet have vastly elevated rates of crime, and london alone has the same population as all of switzerland
australia wasn't even a *big* reduction in guns they only took in a total of about 20% of all guns in circulation. But it was the 20% that were with irresponsible owners who don't have a good reason like wild animals to have it. Getting a tipping point that can actually be considered "somewhat under control" is fairly easy, even if it doesn't solve gun crime without a total ban
and it's very obvious if someone appears dead by crossbow that it's the person who was seen with a crossbow in the area
yes they have the power to be lethal but they are not practical to hide or to do a lot of damage with beyond a single one-off target
crossbows are a  weird one to restrict
that's where most of switzerland's guns come from and they're exempt from all this
military service -> take gun with you

for all UK firearms regulation is super restrictive and the "fire" is not a necessary part, I am 95% sure crossbows are just 18+ restricted
exists solely to kill efficiently and with very low skill
even in the US, buying an illegal gun is hard. The easiest place in the world is the north mexican border where they're all getting smuggled out of the US, but those don't get used by random shooters, they're bought up by cartels who have an illegal business to protect, and therefore they can make profit off the guns
the illegal gun argument has a flaw that it assumes someone who goes to the not-insignificant effort of finding an illegal gun is going to waste that effort on some poorly thought out crime of anger
almost all of them are obtained legally. It's far far rarer to use an illegal weapon in the US, and I think even in the UK mass shootings are mostly legal guns too

if it's someone who *isn't* up into a privileged position despite whatever groups they're a part of, it's still shit to joke about them even if they may be a shit person. Especially 'cause it's so easy to generalise
his argument doesn't hold up because if you're targeting a very specific person who manages to fit the role he's thinking of, where people actually know who they are, then it's at that point no longer punching down.

which is why I specifically said third party in local elections but not presidency
parliamentary system means you can get an effective local change in that can spread. Presidency FPTP means it's utterly pointless because as soon as the vote counts up and nothing is different then all that effort is gone
local elections is the only reason UK has more than two parties with seats
vote third party in local elections where it might actually be possible with a local movement, trying in a presidential election is stupid
it's better than not voting, but it's worse than voting for the only opposition to the republicans that have literally more than 0 chance

which he technically could be since he was born there and would become a citizen, there would need to be precedent of what qualifies if it doesn't explicitly say it must be uninterrupted
either way yeah with no precedent it can't be confirmed that it's *not* allowed
it depends on the rules, does it say a citizen since birth, or a citizen who was born in?

by china's standards almost everyone outside china is a denier as their hardline stance is that the number is over 300k despite *vast* evidence that 100k of that are numbers that were taken from a christian scam cult who it's very unlikely actually did anything
abe was former PM and not the most successful at that if he was
still much harder than just going and buying it in the US
two shots, no reload, and clearly not insignificant effort to make homemade ammo
it demonstrated homemade guns are not difficult but also it was not a good gun for anything more than assassination
does the JMSDF even allow non-japanese
(the pokemon ep)
was it included on video releases or just never shown?
warning: law enforcement would not actually be this competent in either direction in reality
Teppen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
lycoreco is literally about assassins but they're meant to be "the good guys" working for govt and they might be holding on to the next episode being more slice-of-life? hard to say since they've just not said anything yet
yeah, literal worst possible timing
not any other series
yu-gi-oh skipping if they were airing a series I'd understand
not sure yu-gi-oh guy is any more important than many other important creators who've died recently
why would they skip because a creator drowned
not sure that makes sense, especially considering the only one skipping out so far is specifically skipping an episode that was about preventing a political assassination
only one skipping an episode so far, and another that's been quiet so far but is currently being expected to delay
guy says he didn't hold anything against abe politically but obv that doesn't really make sense it's a lot of effort to go to if you don't
the real one is 37%
like they focus on the 99% conviction rate because locally that looks good criminals are going to jail, but that's not the same conviction rate other countries quote
japan does have a tendency to focus on the stats that look good
that's probably just going to head up the school system in the next few years
even a few years ago it was already getting super-difficult to get places in nursery/kindergarten because of excess demand
(which it should be noted, worked. Possibly too well Japan might now be heading for a double-ended population squeeze with too many kids and elderly and not enough to teach or caretake)
that's not popular on the academic side and a significant number of politicians have acknowledged it, but because of only acknowledging 200k china's rarely happy even with those ones. Idk about abe specifically though
you don't have a serious issue until you really needed it
bike trails you could definitely get hurt on
but most of them all they're doing is going to save you pain in minor incidents, which is good enough for me
ones for like, mountain biking will do a bit more
and even aside from statistics the energy absorption of the vast majority of pushbike helmets is just irrelevant to what the skull can already manage or what the brain is capable of taking without major damage anyway
probably more dangerous mainly because drivers paying less attention because there's less of them around
pushbike helmets actually do basically nothing in fatal situations but motorbike helmets do and they still help in less-than-lethal; I'll wear it to not skin my face
but the population is so small even at the same homicide rate at the US it'd be one every few decades
interestingly falkland islands actually has the second-highest gun ownership in the world
true
notable thing about that graph: canada is way above chile in actual gun ownership (at least recorded ownership)
would take a long time to pay off with that screening though since a lot probably got influenced while there or after
<:TsubasaConfused:739613257534406676>
hence works for assassinations but you're not gonna get a mass shooting from it
gun doesn't appear to have any reload, unless you plan to muzzle-load
single-shot each
definitely but I wasn't riding it so
supposedly could get it over 40 mph
I did know someone at uni who bought an electric bike wheel, speed controller, and chonker batteries off alibaba and modified a pushbike into a full-electric bike that was *definitely* illegal. Didn't even have pedals except to stand on any more
that's faster than here
since it's software that can be bypassed, obviously, but then that's technically driving without a license and registration
electric bikes here have to cut out the assist above that 10 mph (think there was some regulation making the transition speed lower than actual legal requirement)
might be 15 mph, which would be equivalent
in the UK it was always the case that any vehicle that was not 100% human powered and could achieve a speed greater than like 10 mph needed registration and a license
proportional to the new value of the vehicle too, pls. So if a £500 bike gets a £50 fine a £50000 car gets £5000
good way to get people to not cycle
which therefore takes up more space than any other option. yay!
in the evenings what I do tends to depend on the traffic, if it's light and I can merge I'll go in the road to take advantage of speed
I do end up doing like, probably half my cycling in the pedestrian areas. It's safer, particularly since in the mornings I'm going uphill and closer to pedestrian speed than car speed
"don't you have cars"
UK pavement cycling (sidewalk) is also technically illegal, but between lanes actually isn't - you're actually *supposed* to do that if traffic is stopped to help flow
same

but otoh because I know it'll mostly just protect minor injury I'm not super-paranoid about making sure to replace it if it's ex. dropped. You should do that with a motorbike helmet since it has real protection, not worth it for this though
I've not had serious issues but always worn mine
they fulfill the same function of being someone who is not purely there to follow the letter of the law

<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> just doesn't have that effect on me as long as I'm at reasonable speed for the road
having a wheel for driving sims may have helped but I pretty much wasn't nervous after getting used to the feel of brakes and how to shift
<insert I studied the blade meme but it's a japanese guy dressed up like a redneck with a truck>
I don't actually drive regularly but when I was learning, yeah, no city driving. It's a lot of concentration to be ready at all times, but not anxiety
when anyone on these islands says bombings it's usually more truck bomb than unabomber so regular violence is definitely calmed down
and you can fly without a radio if you stay out of controlled airspace
They're not required to
I'm pretty sure it's still entirely legal to fly computerless airliners, just no-one does because it's more expensive
depends if you're likely to waste more of the energy by accelerating to speed more and braking more. A low power car does a lot to encourage efficient driving by letting it coast
As I said, shape determines severity, not mass
also similarly two cars in a head-on collision at 70 mph is not a 140 mph collision, both cars experience (at worst, usually better than this) 70 mph into a wall
when train collision testing is done, such as versus nuclear transport casks, it's never done with a full length train because more carriages don't functionally change the collision, despite more mass. It's at most like three
the rest are all so much heavier that adding more does not change the crash dynamics
the bike is the only one that stops at all
yes, rady
there is no functional difference there and a bike will cause less velocity change, yes, although the shape will usually be *more* dangerous to pedestrians
where both are like a ton minimum
I'm not talking about bike vs car, I'm talking about old car vs. new car
the car having more mass doesn't matter since the car's speed is not actually affected
No, it's not, because a pedestrian only gets accelerated up to the same speed in the same distance no matter what
the only deciding factor in overall damage for a vehicle hitting a pedestrian is shape determining how the pedestrian gets hit
the pedestrian is always moved up to vehicle speed with very little change in the vehicle velocity
not really because car has always been >>> pedestrian mass
a pedestrian is generally not enough to cause those to function, but that's not increasing the force, it's the exact same force
crumple zones reduce forces inside and out
https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813298 pedestrians are explicitly mentioned as being part of these official stats?
you generally operate a plane in two dimensions anyway but you are having to keep the third one constant
and with humans at half a million miles driven between accidents even in the US, you could arguably say the same thing about driving. Even with how much americans drive it's not that common to have been in an accident
it's probabilistically less likely to hit something important if it goes down, but it will do so with a lot more damage when it does
a C172 weighs as much as a small car and is much faster with a lot more fuel
there's less than 20,000 airliners of any type in the world while there's over 44000 cessna 172s in the world
and those will rarely be flown into controlled airspace
These same rules apply to commercial flights, they just rarely avoid ever using controlled airspace. But ATC doesn't have to use computers, they don't even need to use any kind of location identification
scihub?
a roundabout doesn't do that I can go straight just by blocking enough of the road to prevent overtakes and going around in the outside lane
this ending is actually more scary because there's some absolutely fucking stupid lane management that forces me to cross three lanes of traffic just to go straight
I do not find the same as you do. I have to go through these, all of which are two lane roundabouts, and I would be much more concerned about that if they were straight crossings instead, as that would basically inevitably mean I'm always setting off with vehicles, while roundabout means there's almost always large enough gaps because traffic is not constant#
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> my experience disagrees, having to cross three big roundabouts on my way home
Not here, vast majority of the time
the point of a roundabout is to not stop, even if you do have to slow
acceleration *massively* takes away advantage
getting to 30 takes like 4 seconds in a *quick* average car, and that assumes everyone is going to react immediately
ah this is why that study is concluding nonsense. It forgets that vehicles need to re-accelerate after stopping for a traffic light and so assumes they can enter faster, when in practice they'll basically always be entering slower as they're having to navigate a queue first
because no road would be large enough to actually supply something like this
maybe this is a complaint from modern cities because here no roundabout would even be close to that
I'll also note that graph is talking about absurd traffic density anyway - considering vehicles should always be maintaining a spacing of 2 seconds anyway and so arrival rate should never exceed 0.5
what's your source for that graph? Because I've never seen adding traffic lights to a roundabout (and yes I've seen it happen) improve the traffic
they can only jam if a jam from elsewhere spreads onto them
if two people in opposite directions in a junction are both wanting the cross-turn they then block the other directions from going when it's their turn until they can resolve it
the one on the roundabout has priority and thus will always clear it
if everyone's obeying right of way a roundabout can't jam until something else causes one
like this is not an improvement because on the roundabout it's at least being shared, others can progress through while you do. On a regular junction that's not the case you're sitting in the middle waiting to get the space to move t hrough
someone turning left (on euro roads) on a regular junction *also* takes the entire junction
traffic lights don't have greater throughput unless you're doing something like measuring per-area

<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
the one that doesn't has almost all traffic being straight across and the two sides are basically just for low-business shops
looked at the jensen study and this may be why I don't see the same from the local roundabouts - 2/3 of them have no across visibility, so force everyone to look at what's immediately approaching instead of looking across at what would meet them in like 5+ seconds
That version of the site refuses to connect here after clicking open

Unable to find an open version of it it seems
the implication is it would be helpful to have examples if it does happen
and my point is I've not seen *any* discussion on unreal before and suddenly unity has tonnes
already commented on the ironsource stuff before
I've never seen any backlash like this over it
People don't get mad at unreal for foraying into VFX and movie stuff, so why should unity be hit for things that are game-adjacent? I'll complain if they're heavy in GaaS stuff to the exclusion of regular games, sure, but not if they want to get into AR stuff also
I read that, but I disagreed with a *lot*, not just one or two
and loads of stuff like collaboration tools or artist tools, which would do that, got saxophones
they're still neither of them GaaS stuff, which they've claimed the saxophones are
they're also categorising any VR/AR stuff like that unilaterally
and I'd say at least half of them don't really fit that as they're all very "high realism stuff", like the VFX companies - not necessarily a game controller, but it's also hardly anything to do with live service stuff
I'm unable to find any keyword combo that finds anything about that - do you have any more info?
https://twitter.com/MaxLewisTV/status/1546965811084017666 this guy, though, who's in body armour ...
yeah this one guy I don't immediately believe it of
there's likely a lot of data harvesting going on and from that who knows what they're doing to nudge things in favourable directions for them
also important to note that tencent have ownership of unreal while it's the other way around for unity, unity is buying ironsource
I don't agree but <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
but yeah until such time as ironsource do anything as sketch as previously, given a significant push (And significant profit from) going legit, I wouldn't call this as bad as unreal being 40% tencent owned
they're definitely not good user experience but 99.99% of the time they're not malware

unreal is probably better than it was but it's still a pain in the ass to do anything with
I would be very surprised if they risked pissing off devs by putting it in the editor or making it more than optional for desktop
reading a subthreaded article on the company I wouldn't be immediately concerned. It appears their focus is now on making money through mobile game publishing so this will most likely just be pushing harder on mobile games, which unity has a lot of
unreal is really awkward and slow to work with compared to unity
fair enough then
might want to be on a trial beforehand in case they all get their sites blocked and you can't download

doctors aren't even legally allowed to give out that info and even if it's a court case since she's under age wouldn't it be a sealed case?
not sure what's supposed to be different about this one either because it's also in unity
I mean what they describe is just the anonymous feedback data which is definitely in unreal too
probably cavity search for drugs
and the exception is because those cases count as rape already

also at least three hours is pretty easy to go "ah I'll just nap in/around the station". Here it's like, before midnight to around 7 am
I imagine in japan one missed train might not be enough so they have a few hour's window where they just close everything, particularly since there's *so many* intersecting lines to deal with
if that rush didn't exist then those people would spread out more, the trains would be less packed and people would use them more. It doesn't need to run at the same regularity, it just needs to run at all
and here I know that all the late trains run fairly well used all the way into the night, with the last couple becoming super packed as people rush for last train
they could probably run more but they're so obsessive with making sure everything is maintained to perfection that they do actually use that shutdown period every day, rather than just do periodic maintenance through the day
you know in japan the trains only stop like 3am-6am, right? at least on any of the major lines
didn't they get most of the key states and were caught out by unusual flips?

rainwater has literally undergone standard purification (boiling + recondensing)
as long as it didn't get contaminated by anything on the ground before being drank, yes
especially round here there's a lot of sidewalks that are rough stone or even outright cobble
being unable to take bumps, such as ex. poorly-set dropped curbs, means its theoretical speed is fictional, while a bike can maintain speed over those just fine
they don't usually snap because you have to treat them more gently than a bike with those tiny wheels. With big wheels I can take some pretty rough bumps by just standing on the pedals to take the immediate impact out
otoh at that point the comparisons are getting way more complex; most of the money that's gone into the bike has been wheel maintenance (snapped spokes), while the same situation that's likely to snap a cheaply-replaceable spoke is likely to shatter the mountings on a small-wheeled scooter and possibly some ankles alongside
at my current overnight prices, giving that scooter costs 4-5p of electricity. My bike costs none, although it's a more expensive bike and has had more money put into it over several years
you must have a lot of free time to go for 2 hour walks and still spend most time in front of a computer
I moved to cut out 2 hours of commute and that didn't involve any walking
because it's 2 hours out of your day you could be using for anything else?
it's a long distance running, walking is fairly so-so
it's not I could do it fairly easily in terms of exertion (my feet tend to be a different matter), but I'm not spending 2 hours just on getting somewhere
not really feasible for a daily thing for most people
if you want to take nearly 2 hours sure
unless you live somewhere significantly hilly riding a bike, even at fairly significant speed, is not a chore
probably
and then exercise happens as a bonus
it's not explicitly as exercise, it's to get around
escooters either have airless tyres that are notably worse or aren't realistically going to be maintained, even if their tyres are theoretically capable of as much (they're probably not)
the efficiency of a maintained pushbike (ie; inflated tyres) is actually insane
like that was literally a point against buying an ebike instead of the one I did, unless I could find a *really* good deal (I didn't)
and then that means I'm gonna get fatter and spend money to do it
like, muscles definitely not happy, but I could use them the next day
I thought I was going to be shattered at the end but I got there and after water and a nice sit-down I was actually kinda ... fine?
the most I've done in a day semi-recently was 13 mi, for which I did have a bike but it ended up being so offroad (and the bike is a road bike) that I don't think I gained any efficiency over walking it, only a little bit more speed
any big shopping is probably most of a mile
that's probably not an unusual distance here I'm lucky to be across from it
where it's unusual to be able to manage that is the feet, especially if overweight. Feet really need to be used to it
walking is extremely efficient so barring serious issues usually around respiratory or circulatory systems, exertion-wise usually hours of walking is fine

you need to be able to restrict the airflow at the base so wind doesn't steal all the heat before you get to use it
solar updraft is a very flaky idea in general
the toxicity issues not so much but there's a lot more concrete & CO2 release and lots of other ecological issues (like melting birds)
because the only thing that lets anything else anywhere near the lifetime efficiency & low impact of a nuclear power plant is how little time it's used for
solar panels are like 200-300x more toxic waste than nuclear power, all of which is unmanaged unlike nuclear power, and that's assuming a nuclear power plant is used for like 25-30 years. they're typically being used for 40+ now and we can and absolutely should be aiming for 60-100 years per plant & reactor these days
solar panels also suck because of the rare and toxic metals used in them and their production but even bad ones are like 15% and then you get 90% of that across transmission
that doesn't include the engine inefficiency
biofuels are like 5% conversion of solar energy received to fuel energy, on a good day.
such as turbofans driving the main fan
electricity only loses in small cases where you're not trying to move the power very far and already have an appropriate transmission shaft
well, other than gravity, and lots of it
fusion can happen lots of ways, fission detonation boosting is just the fastest and easiest way
since this loco didn't step-down the pressure in a steam chest it actually gained efficiency even though low-speed turbines aren't great
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LMS_Turbomotive
you can use 1:1 with some kinds of turbine
best-case use for that would be if it was a rocket exhaust but people complain about that
technically you could use the hot exhaust of a reactor to directly drive a motor but there's several issues with that
the efficiency of burning is limited by the heat engine equations, and a power station can always get hotter than an engine can, by more than the transmission efficiency
it's unfortunately capitalism because tesla actually switched *away* from designs that don't need rare earth metals because the new design is actually cheaper
so it's unfortunately not solving anything because people will keep using rare earth metals with this type because it's the best version, even if this kid potentially *has* made some design improvements
yeah also confirmed tesla are using rare earth metals with this type of motor
and 3, even, I just found the article about S and X being upgraded to the same type as 3
also it appears this is already the type used by tesla S and X motors

If they weren't pro-LGBTQ they'd not have the flags in in the first place. It would go totally unnoticed that they're not there and their presence isn't going to affect sales - having to implement both is even going to increase cost so there's basically no profit to make it switching versus just not-pride flags

even aside any factors like giving a shit or motivation, higher pay means:

less stress, so people are spending less of their shifts on coping strategies either publicly or privately, and are happier so they're more ready to help colleagues or customers
it'll almost certainly be less green than a subsonic airliner, unless it's powered by like, 100% nuclear-produced hydrogen, but not by as much as might be expected. Concorde had several factors against it even beyond just age and speed, and it's definitely economically feasible to go supersonic - my main question is just if this random newcomer company can do it
and with the small passenger count (and interior views) of this proposal it's clearly going for the same
but the fact that concorde was exclusively business and first class meant that even factoring in its extra maintenance costs, noise concerns, fuel use, luxury waiting rooms in airports, it still made like a 75% profit margin for BA
which, tbf, with how boeing is falling apart in the commercial market could absolutely happen - if these guys can get any airframe manufacturing capability
they'd have to see the same market success with subsonic aircraft as airbus
specifically because they wanted to push more modern aircraft (Since it would take multiple to replace one concorde)
its maintenance costs were actually fine until airbus decided to raise them dramatically in the early 00's
however these guys have a timeline for the development of their single-seat demonstrator ... that does not include a first flight yet
Concorde was the most profitable aircraft of all time (for british airways, somewhat less but still profitable for air france)
2025 for first prototype from possibly-nothing, and 2029 to first flight, feels optimistic

oh there's definitely going to be other people trying it. and it looks like people are trying to defend it by saying the driver keeping the accelerator on overrides any automatic braking - in which case what's the point of it. Everyone else, if autobraking triggers, it has priority, because they actually use good sensors instead of just cheap cameras
so these guys do have a PR department when it could lose them a lot of money to ignore something

true
frankly even if they did have something everyone I know would find the person sharing it weirder so I'd just tell anyone who asked "yeah it wasn't worth paying money to stop that getting out, who cares?"
intentionally because they have nothing. They just aim for any masculine name and make vague allegations that they have video of you masturbating or something - generic enough that it's going to be something that you did do 9/10 times - and hope that some small fraction will be ashamed enough of it to pay
yeah, like I said, attempted blackmail

I've not noticed PD chargers being particularly overpriced? They are delivering a lot of power in a small form factor

winter might suck with little electricity, but it's not going to be exceptionally cold or threatening. If people do die of cold it'll be because of neolib policies in general not because of the lack of russian gas

you can cycle on flats literally all day and the only thing that will get tired is your butt

it's kinda hilarious to realise how OP cycling is if you go any long distance (and get any amount of flats). For basically the same or less effort than walking you go *so much* further and faster
and cycling past the cars is even faster

Stealth is a very weird technology since it's very unproven, and especially with modern datalink systems it's entirely likely it could be defeated by combined systems. Low-band radar that isn't precise enough for a weapons lock gets transmitted from a ground station to the fighter, fighter then launches a missile into that area in search mode and when it's close enough to defeat the stealth it locks and kills anyway. Which is one of the likely strategies eurofighters would try employ if they had to fight equivalents to the F-35 and F-22
the takeoff versatility is an advantage but I'm not sure it ever showed anything that could constitute comparable capability
and the US has recently started looking for designs for an F-36 that will be very comparable to the eurofighter (significantly reduced stealth, low cost, high dogfight capability)
like not even that long later
and was totally superceded by the 747
I bet the EW equipment's as outdated as the 707 it's in
I doubt they have, but that would be a sensible path
tbf the F-14 is a very capable airframe so if they want to develop their own capability it's probably not a bad idea for them to develop the capability to maintain them themselves, and use it as a platform for modernisation
it's another part, but any plane that does something fancy is going to have more parts to maintain
swing wings aren't particularly expensive to maintain; B-1 had less maintenance cost per flight hour than B-52
Iran has tomcats but whether they use them is debatable
apparently tested to 2.5?
More like 2.3 or higher clean
if the F-14 had actually been modernised the way its high-capacity airframe would've allowed it could, but given the last modernisation was that long ago, yeah
and yet so few actually going through with them against capitalist leaders
the mass graves, the executions, the torture, basically all of it
several
yes
and a good dogfighter can even dodge those, so it's fair to question sacrificing that capability
the meteor is likely to be more reliable since it should hit with more energy by being ramjet-powered, but that's an unproven missile still and it's still relatively sluggish compared to the short-range missiles like AIM-9X
Not really, it has a pretty low hitrate too. It's usually referred to as long-range these days anyway after range upgrades, but its advantage over the original long-range missiles would be that you can carry more of them since it's a similar aero performance but with less rocket = less weight
stealth has yet to really be tried with/against modern missiles (high hit rate without being detected on long range is necessary for their strategy to work), hence it's kinda up in the air and america is still interested in developing non-stealth aircraft
there's also the fact long-range missiles have to be launched at least somewhat facing the target (they're bad at turning and even if they're programmed to be able to, you'll lose range by firing away first), and have relatively low hit rates due to being bad at turning and often being slow by the time they get to the target (the rocket can only burn so long, most of the distance is by momentum)
stealth is trying to avoid the fights rather than do better in them
It's not that the range of fights would be closer, it's that it would be forced into more of them (and fights will almost always end up close-range if they happen)
the goal of its stealth is to detect and fire before the enemy is aware of it. It would increase the range at which it has to go defensive, but that's not good for an aircraft that's less manoeuvrable and is trying to go for the long-range kills
for nose authority it's more complicated but the eurofighter has a *lot* and is unlikely to be beaten by anything without F-22 levels of TVC
for G-performance you can derive it almost totally from the wing loading (vast majority of useful airfoils have about the same stall lift coefficient of 1.5-1.7) which the F-35 has 700 kg/m^2 at MTOW, 300 kg/m^2 empty, while eurofighter has 460 kg/m^2 at MTOW and 215 empty. Areas and weights are also gonna be hard to falsify publicly so this can be considered pretty accurate

note for this: lower is better since the same wing area creates the same force, so you want less inertia behind it
potentially, the biggest question though is whether stealth justifies the F-35 having such low manoevurability and therefore low survivability if its stealth failed and it had to engage at close ranges
yeah I think I've found what you heard about and it's active countermeasures to stay undetected, which pretty much everyone is trying and I doubt sweden is uniquely good at
which most modern fighters will try have something like, and the eurofighter's is probably the most capable with near total coverage from its main radar
I don't think they were particularly looking for that to happen they're just insistent that it be a normal bank holiday with no exceptions for stuff like that and refusing to listen to anyone sane over it
govt went clownmode over it
yeah that stuff's bad but it's also not her it's the ridiculous response
but really I suspect most of the "I hate the queen" stuff is probably just as much propaganda as the ridiculous mourners. She's not really *done* much to anyone these days, the most justification for dislike is that they're rich and it's inherited
her herself, not actually that much. Royalty hasn't had much power to act in a long time. She ascended before the empire really ended though so there's some bad stuff that can still be associated
maybe some closed to throw parties
pretty sure you're mostly seeing the british people who are making a big deal and most don't care. Basically no-one I know does we're just happy for the extra holiday
and hence this is not spitballing as we know of instances where it happened
the letters say the opposite, she was not informed ahead of time, and he was only ever asking charles if he had the ability to, specifically avoiding bringing it to her
which does nothing to mean those underneath her wouldn't lie to her and try handle it themselves
that's been the case literally for hundreds of years
it's not across just her reign it went from full royal power to mostly parliament
the whole royal family was already fairly uninvolved and had been for centuries. Their power is ceremonial
if she wasn't even informed of the australian PM being deposed, why would she be told about the goings-on of "peasants" in kenya
I really don't think the chance is actually that high. They weren't involved in decision making processes, and they mostly spent time just living in luxury. They were probably informed of a few points that might've seemed relevant to empire, like if there was a rebellion going on, but I really doubt she was given full details, because it would never be considered necessary and those weirdly obsessed with the royal family would think "no need to trouble them with dark things"
I'm still calling them less ridiculous than the people mourning though
It's not finger pointing I'm questioning, it's some of the ridiculous levels of partying in a few places
that nickname and the knighthood appear to have come the other way around, though yes she's a long way off perfect. Equally, hardly has earned the level of hate some profess - there's plenty worse around with more real power

really not a big dent compared to conventional artillery
official numbers are that over 30,000 tonnes were used and the gustav's shells were 7 tonnes
that would theoretically allow 900 shots across the siege but they only brought 48 rounds with them and only fired 47. But even if it had had the ammo to do so it would only account for 15% or so of the ammunition used
which is unusually high for a wunderwaffe but hardly war-changing
the gustav fired about 1% of the artillery used in the siege of Sevastopol
but ukraine won't push far back, just enough to have a secure line
I would be more surprised if it doesn't at this point
not that 60% of the public is likely to be enough to trigger it, but do they not have no confidence mechanisms?

which is bigger than you think when you're trying to strap it to a small frame. I've tried, not had any success getting these on my bike
actually 1m is probably an overestimate but I can work out that a fairly normal size one is 60x40x40
I'm generally not ordering a kit at a time with how shipping works, I'll buy several and only have hlj ship them when there's enough to make it worthwhile
can't see size labels on the first ones I checked but fairly reasonable for what's in them, typically like half a dozen model kits or occasionally a decent-sized figure replacing a couple. Probably 1m x 60 cm x 40 cm is typical
it would be a struggle both to strap the box to that front rack and to see over it in most orientations
but hlj orders end up being biiig boxes
I already have the pannier rack
yeah I need bigger than that if I'm going to move like, more than one box at a time
I just want a nice cart I can drag along dangit
I have looked for like, trailers I could attach, but it's really hard to find any that look good and aren't hyperfocussed on "take your kids/pets with you!" and therefore have a bunch of framing and covering
I have large pannier bags I can do a lot with but they're not large enough for the boxes of weeb stuff I order occasionally, so that would be the main reason I'd consider one (plus it has options like buying large fans/airconditioners/etc)
since I'm not going to ride one up the hill to work every day when I just need me and a bag
I'd consider one if I had somewhere to put it when I'm not using it the vast majority of the time

ukraine is pretty much never going to be able to "win" this war unless russian internal issues build up so much pressure that russia itself ceases to functionally exist. They *might* be able to reclaim all territory by the end of the year, but even that would be rough and it's unlikely russia would accept peace

if other companies become unable to just go to google for "hey can you deliver ads to <this extremely specific combo of interests>" then that opens the floor for a dozen others to start trying and probably be much less secure about data privacy
as it is google has the core data monopoly
if anything trying to stop them could make it worse by power vacuum
the company that removed "don't be evil" from their founder statement or w/e it was is definitely sus, but all the data they collect is pretty damn secure
which they're not because it doesn't make business sense
where's anyone talking about doing evil with it anyway the discussion was whether they're selling it off to random whoevers
the business move is to hoard it and use it to optimise services they can sell
I absolutely do not believe google has my best interests in mind, but they're also not selling the data because it does not make sense to
google trying to sell their collected data doesn't make much sense since if it's a company that uses it for any similar purposes, that would be google selling their competitive edge of data others don't have - and basically only other massive ad companies like facebook and twitter would be interested, because the cost of trying to process that much data is insane
you can get companies to pay a lot more for ads if you can guarantee a click-through rate of like 10%, due to them all being relevant and the limiting factor being click-willingness, rather than a typical scattershot 0.1% because most people it's not even relevant to
what google are selling, first and foremost, is optimised ad delivery *based* on the data they collect
very few other companies are actually interested in all that data because it's a stupid amount to process, completely unwieldly. And most of the data is still semi-anonymous - a manual review of it could probably find an individual, but realistically most of the datas are just "this is one person who searches these things, it is not automatically identifiable as a real person"
that's how the whole system works
which is saying google are collecting that data in order to serve ads

Probably the most directly comparable services are floatplane and nebula but those are both subscription precisely so that they can afford it
I mean twitch did experiment with recorded videos for a bit, didn't they? but had basically no success
more likely doubleteamed by US and putin
~~republicans have to protect the pisstapes~~
even if the govt only asked for data from within their country, the US would probably be very angry because of their own activities within
google would be much better off ignoring and pulling out whatever tiny presence there may have been there
the US govt would not be happy if google just surrendered all data on US citizens to north korea, for instance
aria the more important part there is "certainly money in not pissing off other governments for surrendering such data to some backwater state"
imagine blocking your boss for calling your bullshit

Lol
and an interesting thought to consider: most socialist/communist states come from backwaters building up, but that's probably the only easy way to become such because a rich state has vested interests protecting themselves so it needs a backwater to realise how much capitalism sucks and avoid it
if it's bad in the way claimed it' going to topple itself
if it were actually so bad then yeah you wouldn't need to take active moves against it as its opposition
> best rocket engine ever made is still a late 60s/early 70s USSR design that cannot be fully replicated
"slowed down development" and vice versa is always an easy one to propagandise since it's impossible to prove the other path
one of the world's biggest grain exporters and biggest high-value international transporters (via antonov) barely matching communist GDP in 2020 sure says something
wasn't this also because of US funding the radical fascists to keep communism out
it's really not that much
go back and look at what bits he's actually shown
I'm not I'm sitting where it's proven which is "there's something not being shown on both sides"
bethesda hasn't broken NDA and clearly are sticking with that until courts require it
and either he's still under NDA so breaking it anyway, or NDA expired so he should just not give a shit
if it was the entire email chains unredacted it'd be a different matter but it's not
nothing more than that is proven
he has proof that things aren't entirely as the reddit post claimed, that's about it
with about 6 screenshots 5 of which were his own messages, which proves nothing about other people's actions
pay attention to what is actually proven, don't just assume all claims are
no evidence was given that it was bethesda rather than say, the much more likely case of marty got angry and DMed the mod that deleted it
the post that doesn't violate NDA and was made on a private account? I will agree it's shitty but it's not formal action
and given basically all of it will be under NDA they very much wouldn't want to address the "mountains" of about 6 emails, most of which were from him
literally none of your examples disagree
there is no connotation of intent inherent in the word
and saying "x is bad" encourages people to think "x is bad" regardless of actual intent on other people
"incite" doesn't have any amount of deliberateness implied and passive voice makes it solely a comment on the result
they're precisely not implying that because of the passive voice
and you can see plenty of it in replies despite his requests not to, nevermind what's probably happening in private
"have" is passive voice stating that it was the result regardless of intention
ergo why the post is made quickly rather than holding back to negotiate in private
also here the phrasing is "have incited harassment" - passive voice, not saying it was the intent but that it happened
the main thing I note from his own receipts is there's only ever his messages, never anything supporting claims like marty being abusive (which doesn't confirm anything but would seem like an obvious one to include)
guy also mentions he does have a lawyer already and has for a while - and presumably would therefore know if he can take a defamation case
and plenty will take cases like this pro bono on the assumption they have a big cut of a win, and accept loss when it's loss
lawyer doesn't care if they get paid
but at the very least unlike helena taylor he does at least have some receipts
the fact he hasn't makes me think there might be truth that his side is incomplete
which you'd have to do via other channels than twitter advertisements and advertisers get a tiny cut
how do you even counter-boycott
everyone else I would expect to take the offer of getting paid
honestly with this offer it's probably going to be a handful of people who drink elon's kool aid
what exactly are people who're on holiday and therefore not looking at email supposed to do? oh right, it's elon, so "get fucked"
going back through the records if we're pointing fingers mick started it by publicly blaming OST quality issues on chad
decided to actually read what marty posted for better context and while some of it's fishy, there's a lot here that mick didn't actually counter any of. It also does not read like an attack on mick as it's regularly getting characterised as
quick test and it's almost exactly (slightly over) 1000 chars so it would need some abbreviation to fit but should be possible
1000 chars is probably borderline for this but at least means an abbreviated version should be possible
while they definitely should be clearer, how long are twitter captions allowed to be?
and big company means lots of bureaucracy and no-one's getting paid if there's not an actual contract on it
not the most unreasonable but if there's no contract then there's also no schedule of when
if they intentionally delayed the contract that's also shit, but the contract needs to come first
Would you pay someone for something you haven't agreed they're to do?
if they're actually behind on contracted dates then yes that's very shit but that part is unclear
It doesn't but he also provides his own evidence of contracts being signed late and as a freelancer you should know not to be working until you actually have a contract for it
He's either out of NDA or already broken NDA, so my position there is "prove more important parts like how marty acted in private"
Correct. He proves a few things but most of his position is just his own claims
I said that mick's evidence says that the reddit post is partly false but it's also incomplete evidence and I wouldn't expect the company to be breaking NDA in return
I am reading what you're saying but then you're saying you're not saying that. You're also doing this while saying "if mick's evidence isn't worth anything" is what my position is when I made it very clear it's not
ah yes because that's the only usage of quotes and the other part is clearly also a quote from you
the implication would be that you're assuming everyone involved saw it's incorrect and is deciding to go with it anyway
I'm reading the "if" part and noting what that means
which you're taking to be "everyone involved is evil" rather than "so maybe there is some truth outside of the few points that have been disproven"
"they allowed it to stay"
if they do not own it and it is publicly run, where is it a forum for their company that they apparently have control of?
as noted in mick's own post the subreddit is fan-run
things that are proven assuming every screenshot is 100% legit:
mick has doom eternal files (unsurprising)
project was rushed (unsurprising)
he thinks something was misinterpreted after a particular meeting and that paperwork & first meetings were delayed
notes about a track changed a handful of times
pay was delayed (not something marty's responsible for even if marty's clearly the worst actor here)
missing pay for some of the soundtrack (possibly - would depend on the contract I'd assume)
soundtrack started late (wasn't really in debate though why was)
marty got involved with the soundtrack debate despite not being sound guy and chad sucks at mixing
a call happened
lawyers involved but no clear statement on what they're involved in beyond it's related to the soundtrack stuff
because I'm not going to expect NDA to be broken just because the other side did it first
it's only "mountains" if you assume the rest is entirely uncritically true
I like the jump from "no more work from home" to "everyone go home while we figure shit out"

oh no it's just twitter starting to fall apart I assume because it's there on a refresh
"tweet is unavailable" lol
that's a hell of a bill, wow
can't predict when, but it *is* going to have major failures and most likely die for at least some notable time in a large area
yep
nevermind the multiple critical systems that are going actively unmaintained and the fact the system is not designed for a failure state to happen, it has relied on the whole team to keep it running constantly
and yes that is a good thread covering just some of the hypothetical failure cases, just from the fact it's being run by a skeleton team now
at some point a critical system is just going to run into an error that some engineer was keeping on top of as a semi-frequent semi-manual task because that seemed fine while there was someone keeping the lights on, but then a drive will fill up or something, server encounters an error, and suddenly the whole house of cards collapses
it's not possible to predict *when* it will go, but it *will* go and then even if the company could pay people to keep trying, it might be weeks or *months* to get things started again
from what ex-employees say there are multiple critical systems of twitter (like "serving tweets" levels of critical) that now have 1 or often 0 people maintaining them or who know anything about them, and they also have no cold boot procedure to get the platform back up in a stable state if everything goes to shit
I know some places can be weird about it, probably because it's one way to more easily catch out money laundering or fake money (if they ex. destroy evidence and then you can go after them on this tangential charge)

the argument being made is you won't get much further than that with voting, so vote to get the basics going but also in parallel do the work for bigger change
voting only works for stuff that the ruling class are okay with. it works fine for queer rights and such (in most developed places) because it doesn't threaten the billionaires
then you're missing "fight harder"
communism: "look at all these people starving!" (because of the US refusing to sell either food or machinery to grow it, despite the USSR having vast resources available to trade for it) (and only able to be filmed *because* the state is making huge effort to centralise and ensure people can get fed despite the food inaccessibility)

capitalism: millions dead and more starving in the great depression with no horrible videos of it because no effort is being made to fix the problem, state attitude is "good" even though plenty of people still live in excess
people still made new things under hunter-gatherer society
most people creating things tend to create because they want to create, if they can get paid for it is generally just a big advantage in capitalist society
most big innovations come from universities or R&D departments that are funded because company realises paying people to just make new things often pays off
innovation generally happens because people want to make a better thing either because it's engaging to make the thing or because existing thing is bad and they want to use a good thing

as pug says, it very much can be assumed as black people *were* sent to the camps very aggressively (and not treated as POWs as white enemies would be). Jews would have a higher survival rate for no other reason than some of them being able to be aryan-passing
do these people realise that black people would've probably outnumbered jews in the camps if there were enough of them in ww2 germany?
notably this calls into question claims that art AI isn't copying the art, since it's using very similar models and it can be proven the language-based ones have significant accurate memory they're reproducing from
it should go at some point but if anything it's lower priority than the monarchy and just destroying it with no plan to ensure fairer voting or such is crazy
and the fact they don't have to care about re-election means they can just vote however they want which appears to be not-bad lately
and yeah the theory of the house of lords is icky but a significant number of the lords aren't tory-leaning and even those that are tend to be very mild so it does actually slow the collapse
the prompt is just for "good scientist", it's the data that's spitting out the racism
it is and always has been white people and especially businessmen. jews are often a prominent minority in business but only because jewish oppression has had different dynamics to typical PoC racism that mean in a business context people were usually happy to come to the table
in fuwfuwa's example only the response mentions race or gender
still gonna be a hard sell for anyone in his base though
that's fair though might be difficult to set clear rules. If FPTP goes then the lords can go since it prevents the whole thing just getting forced over to the right by split votes - or if the replacement house corrects numbers to total votes, for instance

US rail strikes are different cause to UK, sick leave isn't an issue in UK strikes I'm pretty sure (though US strikes are also a lot more than just that). UK is about things like basic pay in a cost of living crisis and attempts to cut down train staff (often to 1 or maybe 0 on long non-metro routes) so many would lose jobs
core games do make a lot of money, but they're also much more expensive to make compared to that
matt's guess is surprisingly reasonable
King is the publisher of candy crush and *many* other highly profitable mobile games
CoD is not more mainstream than candycrush lol
it's also weird that the FTC statement focusses on CoD when basically 80%+ of that value is from King and Candy Crush
as I recall other acquired companies have had staff saying that microsoft policies did help so it's not entirely unfounded that a microsoft acquisition - particularly if it boots out people like kotick - would be an improvement
they have the sympathy and that's why they won't buy any of their games
... I don't think that read really makes sense as if they didn't have human sympathy they wouldn't have the guilt in the first place
calling it slavery is a leap I've not seen before and I don't think they could make it make sense to anyone but them
🤡
it's majority, yes, but some do act like traditional games are pointless when they're still making a good amount of money and there's not really signs that that'll stop
IIRC it's like 50-70% mobile, depending on the year you look at
a small fraction of them, which means it does somewhat balance out - it's not like the profit difference between the industries is even an order of magnitude. But those that will and how little effort those games take mean it's easy pretty guaranteed money
another one on the pile
I mean I don't know if it's the case here but "US promising something to get a country to give up on its own development and be dependent, then going back on the promise" is a consistent theme through history
the right of way still exists and they just need to re-expand it to two-way running
most of the US's torn up railways are actually still there as most of it was just converting two-way running to one-way, which is also why capacity has drastically reduced and why drivers are being called in at stupid hours because the driver who was supposed to take it was waiting at signals for 12 hours and now their shift is over
I do wonder if matt's shitpost that the FTC is getting involved on behalf of US military involvement in CoD has legs if the FTC is literally just making shit up in its complaints

~~if it's normal to not specify months on the resume then you could perhaps manipulate it in the new year to look like you worked for longer~~
pretty sure that depends on the country and whether it's considered more acceptable to have been out of work or to have not worked very long
the pooltable at work actually gets decent use but I doubt it would save anyone if they hadn't given massive raises earlier in the year
I doubt that given das commented on the long character limit immediately after
plus twitter intentionally has only short messages with large font that's relatively readable
it's fuckin real and been up more than 24 hours?
plus it is real practice at doing that
I mean you probably could put independent translation work on resume, it just probably wouldn't help for jobs that aren't related to that
if serious demand for tritium arises then fission reactors could be designed to breed it more easily than the fusion reactors could. Less extreme environment, but still very neutron-heavy, easier to design breeder systems for
"more sustainable" is a relative thing since there's more than enough breedable uranium on earth to last as long as the sun as sole power source, but it is strictly true
the lack of funding over that time didn't help, but it's true
to be viable it needs to be a bit of a bigger fraction and for longer
remember watts/joules relationship is 1 second and power stations are generally rated in the hundreds of megawatts - they've done a tiny faction of a power station for one second
yeah
it's actually around 500 calories
2.05 MJ is a lot of energy for a small amount of hydrogen
and JET's quite an old experiment to the point that it still uses copper magnets, not superconducting, which is a not insignificant part of their losses
(differing units because NIF fires in singular bursts while JET has continuous runs of up to around 30 s)
other experiments also don't have *great* heating efficiency, but as the most developed example, JET (joint european torus) consumes around 500 MW to achieve 45-50 MW heating. NIF used 300 MJ to achieve 2 MJ heating
2.05 MJ energy applied to the fuel, 3.15 MJ extra energy measured (so total of 5.2 MJ)
even if ITER ultimately proves tokamaks non-viable the fact it'll be testing a self-sustaining reaction means its data will be relevant to other designs that want to know how a burning plasma behaves, because it's expected to be different to an externally heated plasma
it's an interesting result but the NIF is honestly unlikely to be a viable path to fusion due to the need to reset between tiny bursts and their very low heating efficiency
* with 0.66% efficient heating
the right very small subsections are cool. the general platform vibe is trash
(not that you'd have ever noticed the difference)
which is why something faster has more mass, and a charged battery is heavier
rather than converting the mass into energy it's more that there's excess energy in the bond and trapped energy exhibits itself as mass
also this rocket is too small to get a human there so there's still some scaling, it can just put something there
though it does require people to be less sketchy about fission breeders in general
here it's definitely not coincidence
correlation != causation here, but it also != coincidence. Which is what happens sometimes, like with that site that gathers loads of yearly statistics to correlate absolutely nonsense connections

china?
it would be for a poor person
there's still a focus on soft power in china's international relations, but there's less focus on it being by actually having other countries like them and more by having them dependent or indebted, hence their interest in places like greece
recent times with things like the confucius institute are a weird exception in china's story
china has always been very isolationist for like thousands of years
and the more you know the less likely features will work and the more likely you need things like nationality or language spoken
if you know multiple then you need to distinguish them
which is why it'd be less common among people who know multiple foreigners, but there's almost none in china
chinese collaboration abroad doesn't mean there's any necessary distinction to it. china actually doesn't care that much in that regard - it's govt projects anyway, and the govt is just looking to undermine US sphere of influence with their own economic power, they don't actually care that much where or why beyond whether it opens up opportunities
you'll get more distinctions from people who know a lot of foreigners or who have travelled abroad, but those things are rare
it's literally the same word
"here" and "not here" is an extremely common perspective from people who haven't ever been "not here"
that's not even a chinese thing you find that all over
ghostra I think you're missing the point that the chinese speakers talking like this don't care, "west" isn't too general it's not general enough because they do literally mean "not china"
from what I've seen it seems like singing in other languages is typically easier than speaking, at least if you're covering. I assume having a rhythm and pitch to match helps take out a lot of accent mismatch
there's groups that would use it as "no foreigners for us" etc. but on its own it isn't. But it's also probably rarer to be used by people who aren't like that
armis could probably comment better but the impression I get from that video isn't that they're saying foreigner disparagingly and if anything they'd prefer to be able to talk to foreigners, but they haven't so they don't have distinctions to make
"foreigner" is a word for a reason, there's lots of cases where distinctions aren't made. I think you're focussing on a theoretical case where it's used disparagingly which it isnt here
Japan was almost caught the same way but the knock was moderately more gentle and earlier

https://twitter.com/MattBinder/status/1603201807873982464
if anyone's curious about using regular public info for it, the plane's registration is N628TS
it's a safety risk to try hide them, if you don't want a personally identifying aircraft being used to track you, use charter, or even regular flights
anyone can look it up
plane movements are public info, elon

a job like game artist at a studio won't be lost to this for a long time, if ever, and commission work will likely stay strong, but there's a large region in the middle of artists working freelance for professional projects where the art is not core focus and will be replaced by bosses that just don't care about the art being crap
so this is a real, clear, current loss of art jobs
as stated in the replies to that post book publishers are *already* using generative art so that they can avoid paying an artist to do covers
but I use browser not app
if it's on a relevant tweet it's there automatically for me

probably
and yes, knowing elon's carbon footprint is a relevant question for a public figure who claims to be environmentalist (Despite suggesting using a rocket for passenger travel)
just to cover any kind of safety arguments around it
the information is intentionally public plaintext data that anyone can receive, it was designed that way for safety and it has proven the correct choice since with these records being used to find lost aircraft and to respond *way* faster to losses. publishing to twitter does not present any sort of credible danger, anyone who could act on knowing the general airport a particular jet is at has the resources and motivation to act on it without twitter

given that this was caused by incorrect responses not being caught and corrected it'd be far more likely to happen with single-pilot cockpits
https://youtu.be/o6c3ENr_CRM
(these minimums also, bizarrely, came after a crash where every single pilot on board (3) comfortably met those minimums so it's not clear what the motivation was)
yeah that needs to never happen but america has massive staffing shortages due to crazy minimum hours requirements that have massively discouraged anyone new from signing up to be pilots. This isn't an issue in europe or asia where the requirements are much more normal and airlines are therefore much more willing to pay for your training

given microsoft pushing ie and edge is I wouldn't be surprised
US requires like 150 extra hours on top of that which means even if the airlines were willing to pay for you to get those extra hours (which is most of the issue it's expensive to run an airliner that long without pax) ironically you're also gonna be a while past your last training when you start flying professionally, and those hours were probably done as fast as possible by just doing long boring loop flights
in europe airlines do pay for training, but it's also less expensive due to the lower minimums. In EU if you qualify to fly the aircraft you can fly it with pax
(since it technically is one)
first one (or two?) times were worse but still nothing I really cared about if it hadn't been all over the news I'd have assumed I had a bad cold

(hell the "no AI" thing trending on artstation apparently working for at least one of them strongly implies that system *is* using direct artstation data *and still pulling it now*)
they most likely just didn't consider this when they did the getting though and so just ignored the data and don't want to point that out now they're getting called on it, particularly since if that is their method they can just re-do it but note the artist this time
and this is of course in the IMO-unlikely situation that they're not *getting* this data directly from sources like this so they know the exact artist who uploaded it the moment they're accessing the file
he is wrong 'cause there's no many reverse image search services. It'd be slow and have a moderate hit rate, but it would be fairly easy to automate "oh this one is returning from <deviantart/furaffinity/artstation>, use a script to extract the user and send them a message"

it doesn't matter if 100% of non-voters were outright communists if none of them could be fucked
It means that non-voters don't matter because policy is only decided by the voters
though also the small amount who were actually socialists in those generations generally were at university, but this was still a minority of the generation, so they rejoined the larger cohort in work and so would be influenced back towards the average by being forced to interact with them on a daily basis and make their friend groups from those people
then they don't matter
Other studies that look at actual policies like support/against vietnam war or such
now that's halted and sometimes reversed while the millenials are just as or more left-wing so yeah there's gonna be a big shift
doing it by vote share does disguise the fact that those generations were actually always right-wing but the overton window until very recently was shifting left

I assume "giving a basic description of a person you've seen" is part of the minimum qualifications for policing
they can decide to persuade the conductor that it's not worth the hassle, and it's not unlikely a description was given
therefore they are expecting a higher standard of ESAs than actual service dogs
but that does mean they have explicit policy acknowledging even a formally-trained dog isn't guaranteed to keep it under control
I feel like iguanas would be even more likely to poop all over
are you gonna stop an animal mid-poop? They're not gonna understand that a train is equivalent to a house automatically, house training doesn't guarantee conversion to train-training
that explicit example also goes along with "not taking effective action to control it"
and the statistics for pre- and post- (both being lifetime stats) are similar but with post being lower, so there's basically no mathematical way for it to work out that any significant amount of new attempts happen post
It depends what you mean by "debunked" but it's a self-debunking stat in that it's usually used as "look they keep trying after transition/surgery/whatever the point of the day is" when the statistic is "Have you ever ||attempted suicide|| at any point in your life?", meaning pre-transition attempts still count

it's a new trend to be doing it so consistently but hopefully it continues
most roads here are better than that, but those do still exist and there's little motivation to change it because they generally have little traffic
everything else was fine, about half the minors allowed (possibly less), but that failed it. Thankfully didn't get that roundabout on the second time
I passed second after failing the first for a low-speed roundabout the assessor thought I wasn't slow enough for. Even though I did get enough time to see around the corner and be able to stop, and he didn't feel the need to use his brake
a road that can barely fit 2 cars, is bouncing the whole way, and has a hard 20 degree corner in the middle
but tbh I think it was actually a good lesson to get some of those in my driving lessons. A very clear "just because that's the limit doesn't mean you should go that fast"
it's extremely funny what they'll post a national speed limit on in rural areas
mac was asking the opposite question there, that there are no australians who *don't* get stressed
traffic literally comprises less than 1% of the total
I'd still use these statistics to argue it's an irrational level of paranoia as even with all the dangers most people are living to be old and die of old age diseases - even with cars and roads in general being more dangerous in the past, and having less population to comprise the current-day old-age deaths
there's also 1500 alcohol induced deaths and 1800 drug induced deaths (not including the alcohol statistics)
I'd argue covid is comparably preventable
looking at the statistics for australia there were 1200 vehicle-related deaths in 2021, compared to
3100 for suicide
1100 for covid (which is approximately equal to what influenza was in 2019, while in 2021 it was 2)
10000 for respiratory diseases in general
10000 for cerebrovascular diseases
16000 for dementia
17500 for heart disease

and all of the top 5 causes are non-communicable diseases
guess which one is remembered
because one had labour in charge and one had tories in charge
There were two irish famines but only one is actually remembered, despite both being within 50 years of each other

fascism is definitely the worse choice
the transistor was invented by bell labs which was profit-driven but also comes from the time before hypercapitalism took over all company motive and was when a business might genuinely just fund research for the sake of research

I mean given all the parts of my PC predate the moves to try push production out of china a lot of it is probably a product of communism, actually?
fighting and losing to an AI that a child can trick
and the west has no shortage of those
china's treatment of the uighurs is definitely bad regardless of what level of the rumours you believe, but there's also demonstrably no communism-motivated actions there. It's their own brand of corruption and racism in the system causing that
separating "western countries" from "capitalist countries" makes for rather misleading statistics because the countries involved with capitalism are much more than just the west and the west is rich because of exploiting africa and asia to extract the wealth from there

the signal is lower precision and unencrypted (a requirement for it to actually be useful) but the other two parts are just requirements for selling it on the commercial market. Nothing technically stops you from making one that supports high speed and altitude if you know the maths and where to get the parts - it's just that's a fairly high level compared to getting an off-the-shelf part at $20
it was all military funded but lobbied into availability - military funding is dubious since that gives it a lot of ties into the military industrial complex and the imperialist aspects of that, but fundamentally it was developed out of a generally recognised need rather than a motive for profit, yes
GPS was military-developed but due to the general utility and safety opportunities it presented several industries, largely aviation and nautical, pushed to have at least some implementation of it be publicly available and hence the lower-precision unencrypted version exists
at least part of which however is due to the high corporation taxes of the time which can be minimised by having an R&D department you throw all spare funds at

good question
also worth consideration: columbia had a *gaping* hole in the wing, literally peak heating area, its wing is made of aluminium (not well known for heat tolerance), yet the wing did not fail until around 2 minutes *after* peak heating
there was a shuttle concept that was going to land inverted because they thought the gaps around the landing gear covers would be vulnerable to heating and they'd need to be on top. Turned out that it's fine you don't get *that* much heat through the gaps
looks jank but probably fine
it destroying itself while launching would probably be the funniest outcome
both shuttle programs found that protection gaps are not necessarily as dramatic a problem as you'd expect - high heating isn't always a problem if it's only a small area and can conduct away (as well as have a circulatory pocket in the gap). That said those are very large gaps, and the lack of flame trench they point out after may be much worse - not sure I see anything like enough accoustic protection here
pf1 is an offshoot of 3.5, pf2 is its own system
so wotc technically couldn't sue the vast majority of these independent works *anyway* the OGL was just a nice way to make it clear that there was no conflict. Now there is
this is even though a monster card does not technically infringe any kind of IP rights or copyright since you're just providing a set of numbers that happen to be compatible with a set of mechanics that you do not actually describe with the monster info and describe some vague lore that fits with this and also a hundred other fantasy worlds
the original license is not specified as irrevocable so this is not certain
not necessarily step on, you can still do it, but they can just take it and if you earn a lot from it you have to pay them
the new license being bearable is very debatable given it gives them unlimited access to use things people make with no royalties and the royalties paid to them affect a surprising amount of groups (estimated over 20 companies)
things people sell
they used it to get big since people could add to it faster than official content can be done (and more reliably being good than official content with no competition would be) and are now trying to turn it back
pretty sure they still have suggested stats anyway? Just don't require it and don't rely on your DM being cool for it
DM fiat wins anyway and most DMs I know would let you shift stats if you can justify it, like "I'm this race but I'm unusually short so what about swapping str for dex"
conveniently it did push the pf people to push an alternate OGL that is way more open and which they specifically put in "we can't actually take this back" so just play pf2e if you want the very dnd-purist game that's not connected to wotc
~~no need I'm sure someone will steal one of the abandoned ones soon~~
tanks is one thing but the aircraft are blatantly unrealistic in the first place so I'm not sure what leaking info is supposed to gain?

though given US police training periods I suspect they're not actually trained in anything like locks, probably only weapons and "sit on them"
locking their muscles with a taser isn't gonna make that any easier. stun em and get them in an arm lock - where the whole point is you have all the mechanical advantage so any silly supposed drug superpowers are irrelevant
my expectation for correct taser use on someone who *does* warrant it would be like, 2-3 seconds tops, give them a good cooldown so they're not used to it (And try handcuff them in that time), and then another burst to interrupt if and only if they're trying to fight back
also tasing for 90 seconds, apparently? A) I'm surprised tasers have battery for that long or otherwise let you do it, B) I would think the longer you use a taser in a burst the less effective it is. Certainly with shock toys it's very hard to avoid an initial twitch but if you keep shocking yourself with it it's very easy to just do things through it

the fact that there's so many makes me 100% sure there's no optimisation to each like trying to prompt it on known works of the person, it's definitely just chatgpt with a "pretend to be this person" prompt

it's pretty clear openai are approaching it the same way youtube are with their advertising policies. the bot's gotta be milquetoast so they can get people to pay for it or advertisers to be willing to interact with it or rely on it - no matter who it's acting like
that's not in line with their "the bot must be nice and presentable™️" stance
this just happens to conveniently demonstrate it since the "act like famous person" prompt forces it into a conflicted stance without having to try talk around its blocks
this is kinda the most fundamental demonstration of the problem with just trying to train it to pretend not to be discriminatory: it just creates an impenetrable veneer that makes it impossible to identify when it is being such
I would assume it's just a wrapper on chatgpt and this is how it resolves "ok I'm being told to act like a raging antisemite but also openai tell me to not say antisemitic things"
school hours are generally shorter than normal working hours so you probably *would* expect them to be a little longer?
Which no-one ever sees so for all real purposes if you can get driving license and passport to say F you've changed ti

I didn't look much closer just made some obvious assumptions, what's going on with it?
you can't know if someone's following a trend so you have to get through everyone
even if it were the case that there were enough "trenders" to slow down queues; the solution to that isn't to push back, it's to devote more resources to process more patients
the US has released as much or more about the F-22 and F-35 for emergency responders to know where the pointy and explodey bits are
if they do want something private then you can custom-define your own message format that you could encrypt but I wouldn't expect standard messages to be
on the ACARS note and wondering if journalists would be interested I'm not sure if those have to be private? certainly it's intentional that ADS-B isn't private for emergency tracking, so I suspect you can probably listen in to most ACARS messages if you have the right kind of receiver

even for multiple units through the building it's probably no more than a few hundred actual materials cost
though the real scam is 9 grand for some UV LEDs and fans
and a good way to prevent that is to not install it in one building while you have comparable ones that data could be collected against
only if you can prove it would've made a difference, probably
Ah but if they remove them then they remove the data that shows the lights are effective in such a space
1.3 is way more stable than 0.8
of the more specifc area though korea is at like half the birth rate
the stats I'm seeing put china worse but at the same time they include UAE among "asia" so it's overall kinda questionable
I'm looking at birth rate rather than population growth rate
japan's probably heading for a double-ended population squeeze with a heavy old age *and* child bias
since it's been going up and everyone else's been going down
doesn't japan have the highest birth rate in the area now?
we don't even know how stealthy actual stealth aircraft are supposed to be beyond the fact that pretty much all of them have apparently failed stealth trials against their country of origin's radars (at the very least in the sense that they're not as stealthy as designed).

And against modern weapon systems it's questionable how much it helps because they all show up on low-band radar just fine and a modern missile can use that to get close before switching to its own sensors, or a fusion of its own, the launch aircraft, and the launch aircraft talking to AWACS
I would expect that even if those numbers are accurate the su57 would be on the 0.1 range and the eurofighter would be 0.25 without weapons and 0.75 fully loaded
assuming a) that the number quoted is accurate, b) that the nato numbers quoted are accurate as this is one of the hardest to verify (they're honest about relatively easy ones like weight and size)
in my mind I would assume it's a group share controlled by vote and presumably with a requirement along the lines of "can only be sold with unanimity/crazy supermajority (80% or more) and all profits are shared equally"
.. you could *maybe* have a system where there's a collaboratively-owned controlling stake, but it does become significantly more difficult yes
if the legal obligation to make profit for stockholders was removed it might alleviate some of the worst behaviours seen but they would still have lots of unearned money to lobby it back
yes
yep. it means that someone with knowledge of a field - any field - realistically *can't* be replaced by chatgpt, but that doesn't mean your boss realises that
none of that exists my guy it's a runtime thing I don't do any generation in editor. I assign it and if the code works it just does it as the game runs
I asked it a question about something I was doing at work recently (code-side implementation of runtime virtual textures in unreal) and not only did it ignore me trying to get code out of it (because for 99% of cases you don't need to use code to use this system, I have a special case), it entirely made up stuff about having to go into menus and find a generation wizard
if it's something it knows about because it's relatively common it might be right but if you ask it for info on something it *will* provide something that looks like info regardless of truth level
it does it'll just make up shit that sounds like it fits whatever you're asking for. regardless of what it is
"content without paying people? jee whiz bobby!"

(I cba to check if those all came out in 2019)
probably a rough ranking of how talked about they area
you can separate fuel from air with flame retardant, not so much with a battery
batteries work by having two chemicals that want to react but keeping them separated so they react through the wire. if it's on fire the separation's gone
(redactions being for things like reading a license plate on the radio)
maybe there's some weird bodycams like that but all footage I've seen has had full audio except for intentional redactions, and I've only seen that before the police even approached the person they're dealing with? the bodycams most police wear are recording the whole time they're on
you don't even need the camera part for that the audio's enough
*bang bang* "come out with your hands up!" is pretty undebatable
I feel like after the many body cams of this going the other way this isn't gonna work much longer, if it still is

"promoting our new self-driving features! You don't even get a choice!"
but that's why I don't watch most of those
that's true but I was more thinking as an observation of the formulaic episodicness of the genre and how for that specific setup it's possible to generate content because of its lack of arcs
it would be more interesting if it was just an art piece meant to stand on its own but trying to have it taken seriously as an option for content in general just makes it laughable
something with infinite content inherently cannot have storytelling arcs (that are relevant)
perhaps less for "endings" so much as "complete stories"
(and often those "bot accounts" aren't even automated they're just actual people in bumfuck nowhere in russia or indonesia being paid pennies to just shitpost)
which this does nothing against while completely shutting down one of the few cool aspects of twitter
... pretty sure most scammers aren't even using bot accounts they're using fake real accounts that are being driven by an automated browser
spoiler: no they won't
he thinks "surely people will pay $8 a month regardless of how tiny and pointless the feature is"
they're rolling out multiple images to mobile anyway (even while they break the rest of it)
the payload did look weird - looked like it had solar panel arrays, so I would suspect it probably was some kind of long-term observation balloon rather than a regular weather balloon. That doesn't necessarily mean "spy balloon" though, it could've been civilian observation that was looking over the ocean and just continued over the US, or a long-duration weather balloon
I don't think they did because it's far more likely, given jet stream circumnavigates, they would just let it free and trust it'll go somewhere interesting, but it's possible that it could be modified without obvious differences to the balloon from the ground
it did though I'm not sure it would be that complex to modify for at least a mild amount of control - they generally do have multiple layers IIRC, so you could potentially do a slight bit of pressurisation of outer ones to reduce lift.
this is how zeppelins and blimps work
pump air in and you add mass (and compress the lift gas), pump air out and you remove mass
more advanced systems than that have existed for ages you have the lifting bag as a separate gasbag inside another you can pump air in and out of
so it's not the conductivity at all it's that it's self-welding at relatively moderate pressures (a property I don't believe gold has) so even if it's not the absolute highest conductivity you can use less than anything else
> In fact, indium has the unique ability to cold weld two dissimilar materials if the materials have a thin coating of .002”-.003” of indium they will ‘cold-weld’ together if the clamping pressure is more than 40 psi.
gold would be a terrible idea just because of its cost - they try shave pennies off PCBs, even thin foil's gonna be a problem, and copper is more thermally conductive anyway
also weather balloons are much larger at altitude they have to be designed to tolerate the lower pressures
hot air balloons can manoeuvre (sometimes) but it's just controlled venting and basically a nudge compared to winds
fuel cost's still probably comparable to the hardware
I'd be interested to see what happens if you just fly close at about mach 1
alternative reason to use balloons: to make the US use a several hundred thousand dollar missile on a toy you spent 100 on
as much as in principle they're bad unfortunately these Ws don't actually seem to be that rare it's actually kinda unusual for them to be on board with tory extremism

if you have a large enough audience 0.1% of people saying one thing will be louder than 100% saying a thousand

also it's one donation versus all the attention they're driving to the game and the sales that result. It'd maybe be justified to think it balances if you actively run with a charity donation system where you give your own and match everyone else's or something, but is one payment really supposed to balance all the damage you're doing?
^ also more relevant than the spelling, though if they arrived at it via "pagan gods associated with snakes" they possibly missed what they want with the generally positive reading that seems to be associated with most worship
it's far more offensive how it's fairly transparently a last-minute addition to try placate that really doesn't help anything
they've not specifically said that's where it's from but when it's a weirdass name an actual spelling-matched source seems most likely
someone pointed out that gorgonzola in german can be called "fette milch" (close to fettmilch uprising, the real 1612 rebellion it's aping) so the fact it's non-kosher may be incidental but even if it is that's not really any better if the reason is to make the racism more obvious
and turns out that 1612 rebellion is from rowling in one of the books so it was entirely her all along!
even if it wasn't 1612 rebellion + the general antisemiticness of the goblins makes it clear what the intent is
it must be a very specific separation where potter is actually still interesting
which is very weird because I hardly felt any hype in any of the places I visit
if you think she's severely hated in general you're in a very very tiny bubble
no-one else has ever had a bearing on policy
ah yes because the only people to ever influence politics are politicians
so get fucked with that take
It helps me plenty when she directly wants me dead and has strong influence in the politics of the country where I live
she'd be moderately wealthy at most without that
the whole reason she's rich is because when she got it signed with a publisher she pushed to get significant royalties from *all* derivative products
yes it is
(and the game is plenty more directly antisemitic which you keep talking around)
where did I say that was the problem? JK's whole life is anti-trans and supporting the game is directly supporting her
literally in her own words
also it absolutely *does* help with legal rights because any money jk gets is going straight to taking those away
they are promoting it so they're doing plenty to help it along
this is not an original property it's based on a very (poorly) fleshed out property there's very little original lore
... jk wrote literally all the lore what are you on about. And as much as they want to claim she wasn't involved with writing the game we have no proof of that and we *do* have proof of at least one, probably more, writers *actually* being antisemites because they were fired for it and their work was clearly not checked
also innocent is debatable if you know you have an audience that won't like this game, and who the rightsholder of wants to exterminate, and play it anyway
if there's so much then where's the evidence
the prime example was a handful of people saying "you lost a sub" and nothing else and fucking waves of people going "NO DON'T LISTEN TO THEM THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH PLAYING THE ANTISEMITIC TERF GAME"
we went over this plenty yesterday there's basically none
and what would possibly be the downside to it
since they are terrible people this is good
jk and her direct profiters do not get money
and even if they did with the stuff they put in I'd be flaky about whether I care anyway
devs do not make commission or royalties
boycotting the game costs the studio nothing they already got paid, it only costs the publisher (who *only* make jk terfling products) and jk herself
though we cannot know for sure and the gorgonzola horn is a much clearer mark that sure shows how low they actually are willing to go, so
in theory she wasn't involved with writing this
... that better be gnrh analogues to be even "suggested" at that price
do you legit pay 1400 for it or is that just amazon's "normal" price
prescription medication ... through amazon?
gonna guess she came up with the probably crap name first, didn't think about stuff like history, was asked about it and came up with this stupid contradictory answer, and then decided to stick with it and couldn't even think of a good explanation like colonisers renamed it

I bet the other names are similarly bad when translated
> schools 9 10 11
> "magic place"
> fuck italians
and beyond the horn itself talking about it highlighted the 1612 rebellion thing in general which is just JK outright saying in the actual books "yeah I know the goblins are antisemitic and I think that's right"
some aspects of it might not have been intended, but some of them must have been
the horn could've been coincidence and it was my first thought but as more got talked about I'm convinced that it's too perfectly suited as a direct insult to be accidental

and plenty of other countries do precision scheduling fine, the issue is the US pretending to, not how it would work if they actually did
precision scheduling isn't really the issue though the issue is just saying you'll do that then not paying for any of the infrastructure to do it (and tearing up half the infrastructure you do have to "save costs")

ah I thought this was meant to be the hrt prices
*nothing* else hrt wise is even over like 100 for a huge pack
"why doesn't the insurance company get as angry about these outrageous prices as their clients"
prediction: because the insurance company doesn't have enough people to actually process what prices they're getting, in order to save costs, and are getting paid by the manufacturers to allow these insane prices so it doesn't actually cost them just the end user

china has more than just the south china sea now, they're also establishing remote military bases in places like africa. so far nothing beyond what the US has done but Xi is definitely expanding beyond what predecessors did

AAA games can sell when they've actually got good selling points but ubisoft just makes the same game over and over, spending more on it without actually adding anything
like demo shot happened and then across the next few years sniping records just started getting sillier and sillier
technically before and they technically never claimed it never went into service, they've just been suspiciously quiet on it.
probably leaving it so they can pretend they're building up even though they can't afford to
literally next word prediction - any move needs a justification so it's just saying justifications that usually go with those coordinates or pieces
I could tell it the menus it suggests don't exist but it'll just make up other ones
and I can't exactly correct it because it has no concept of UI it doesn't know what menus do exist
one thing I tried to use it with is to get it to suggest why virtual textures don't generate for a custom mesh type but it just suggested I use the virtual texture wizard to generate them (there is no wizard and this makes no sense as the whole point of virtual textures is to be self-generating)
beyond simple equations that are easily identifiable it'd be a challenge to get it to know how, still - how do you make it identify what information it needs to extract from a graph, for instance?
with everything gpt-derived always remember it is just a next word predictor. it's a very complex one but it has no model for truth, which is why it will confidently lie to you. If you call it out on stuff it'll get a bit more reliable since it then goes into the path of "debating to try find factual info" which brings some simile of fact into its model but it's still bullshitting based on a prediction of what humans would say, it has no concept of the things it's talking about
in the very first film they nuke a whole planet to get at a single rebel base (agent orange / rainforest firebombing parallel)
any nazi allegories that may exist are *super* weak compared to US vietnam war. It's got aesthetic similarities but mechanically almost none, and focussing only on the aesthetics massively misses the point
that's precisely why, let's start a riot

it may also depend on if they're wanting to change that in the near future, though I don't think valve is
they're privately owned so they technically *shouldn't* have the same pressures as a lot of other companies, ie. make immediate profit now, but that doesn't prevent the overall dynamics.

I've not seen this video though sooo I will find out details later when I do
wonder if we're gonna get another "suicide" with the cameras not working
gear is yuri, yuri is gear
sympho just completely smashes that expectation and gives exactly how it should be
yeah that happens
(and I have to wonder if it would be more like assisted walking and the feet locked into something on the ground)
weren't they planning to only just get the 1/1 gundam to walk for the olympics
I want a figure that's 8 times larger thna life
> 8/1 scale
put up the flag that we want stuff here (but plz crunchy fix it)
but I still pay for the sub
That's what I usually do and why often I don't watch anything on there
I think so but it's doing a deal with funi so there's probably issues with that
so f everyone who's not interested in offering to us c'mere crunchy
and there's no VRV
funimation's expensive and way more limited than crunchy
amazon, despite advertising the anime they have on UK site, have literally pretty much all of it NA-only
well fuckin no-one else actually releases it in the UK so :V
I'm buying merch and keeping my crunchy sub going even though they f up subs and there's still months I don't watch stuff
simoun was extremely weird from what I remember watching
I will also yoink this rec
does tiki really count as het rather than adamosexual
https://www.fanbyte.com/news/next-life-size-gundam-to-put-the-mobile-in-mobile-suit-this-october/ apparently it will make one step (but was not planned for olympics)
or is that still coming
... is this the greatest crossover episode
I could've sworn drugs were illegal in japan
fucking ||sports competition||
it's almost earth's moon but there's at least three significant mares that ours doesn't have
after noticing that the moon in sympho is mirrored, I'm now looking at the moon in cross ange more closely than a normal person would
I always watch through for ending scenes so yep I got nana being silly
~~it becomes a lot "bolder" with the subs giving Tusk a *massive* dong in the OP~~
ok so I can infer a lot from the ending of that episode, but still wtf
||Tusk is making this too straight for me though. give more lesbiabs||
||time travel? Alternate earth?||
what the *fuck* is this
I am going to watch that in a moment, but for now I'm watching cross ange, and
bakemonogatari largely avoids looking dated by having decent colour and such. The same effect as how technicolour and other old TV recording methods look old because everything's just a bit *off*
as is it looks like a weird halfway point
sympho s1 would look dated if not for the moments of really good animation
it particularly shows in stuff that ex. has weird colour grading
which came first
random background art is random
"And it's the girl you have a massive crush on and she knows!"
IMO the focus is because people would focus on it but they 100% don't know each other *as* sistsers so their feelings are understandable. They literally don't know there's any connection between them at the point everything starts
that's like a solid week of nothing else
200 eps already tells me I shouldn't
searching around a bit, the ZnT image is from princess no rondo. But the toradora one doesn't appear to be from either ops or eds
I don't think that's S1 of ZnT though
and that's the only one I for sure recognise from that long ago. Maybe Jun Fukuyama?
oh hey Aya Hirano on the cast list. Pre-Haruhi
*really* common stuff like attack on titan
Ikxi you may not be surprised to learn that that's on my anilist and that I have no memory of it
that's clearly spice and wolf though
https://myanimelist.net/manga/116003/Eiyuu_no_Musume_toshite_Umarekawatta_Eiyuu_wa_Futatabi_Eiyuu_wo_Mezasu the other one I was thinking of. Which is entertaining so far but nowhere near long enough to make an actual judgement on
if you watch it Allison and it's actually good do tell because while I don't think it was actively bad I do recall it being very *weird*
the one I'm thinking of actually doesn't have kenja in the title but it's another reborn-in-fantasy-world-as-silver-haired-girl
It's gonna be partly that it's Old but crunchy have plenty of Old
hang on no I'm getting confused with another reborn manga/ln there's actually a decent amount of kenja. Though I don't know how much further JP N is
an from what I remember I don't know that I'd suggest *paying* for Simoun ... there's probably a reason no-one's picked it up for distribution

<@!237964037898502144> this is a fun manga though not very far in, neat it's getting an anime
rather than being a strong or romantic form, it's simply that saying to someone "I want to take you for myself" is inherently romantic (as long as you've not given them reason to interpret it as creepy)
Nuker: -tai isn't a strong version of the verb, it's the "want" or potential form, it's what makes it "I *want* to *take* Miku for myself". And the verb is conflated with "steal", not just take, making it a selfish verb/denying it to others. The implications in the verb choice are that she wants miku back not for the world, just for herself. (Which she does then clarify in the rest of the line)
though depends how many discs it's on
DVD quality eeeeh
I thought the anime was explicitly gay so the manga being more would be impressive
I would be ok with this
a musical transmission
(also while there's definitely gay the premise sets it up that a lot of straight takes over a lot of gay)
so fucking weird I don't know whose taste it would be to
from what I remember that's probably a good summary
<:HibikiEat:689192541404528664>
though I probably won't get it either
I think I added it to my list recently so expect it to come up on AMQ at some point
~~seriously though how does everyone think kuro is illya at first when she makes an okinawan look white and illya makes me look tan~~

I liked it but I did have to just sorta put *those* scenes aside
I mean if you don't mind young teenage girls getting a bit *too* touchy with other young teenage girls (but all still technically SFW) then I guess
||I did get through S2 in the end and enjoyed it enough, but it was a disappointment compared to S1 doing a realistic mecha & politics drama||
should I watch the movie if these were my issues, then?
and in S2 I liked ||how the unification didn't work as intended, but didn't really like how to fix that suddenly it's magic and mysterious alien(?) illuminati instead of actual politics and focus the good of humanity||
the first season basically sold itself to me at ||"The New IRA ... just announced that they're ceasing all activities||.
I won't comment on S2 to someone yet to see it (||Didn't really land for me suddenly going from complete deconstruction of mecha to complete construction of those same things||) but S1 was great precisely because I felt it was believable. Not necessarily that a tiny org ||could get so far ahead in tech compared to the rest of the world to be able to make those threats||, but that people would still be fighting in the same way, so far in the future, for the same reasons? And the way they react to the gundams? *fantastic*.
"Ok I mean, you can have porn, but you can't *call* it porn"
I mean that music title says plenty
sounds accurate
<a:police:708876720798957638>
oh jeez that ep
there's a whole arc ||of illya dropping everything to go rescue miyu when she gets taken||
I mean probably on a level similar to pre-XV yes
and lol she's so crushed at the house being western style
aw I was hoping it would
I enjoy the talking past each other and misinterpreting :<:MikuHappy:421380101729550357>
I'm starting Kiniro Mosaic and there's some wild engrish here. Not quite fine level, but I hear some *interesting* interpretations
a lot of KOTOKO's songs are very similar style (and similar to a few other artists as well)
ep2 of KinMoza: Karen is such a character
over the top doesn't mean nothing happens off-screen
I don't mean notes about what they did last time. I mean notes about what they're doing while all the main stuff is going on. Have them have plot progression, put it in a real world
you can not plan but still remember that the cast is there and have them do their own thing in your own notes that don't get drawn
as someone who's only ever seen some memes of it
as is what I've read here hasn't really sold me on it at all
I'd be interested in that style if the writer actually kept notes and things did actually happen in the background; like they were running a game of sims in their head and everything was progressing, rather than just thinking of something weird to do the next ep even if it's not connected
so it's only the setting that matters, not the characters? you're not invested and interested to see how they react under pressure?
(higher score I blame on not bothering to rate crap stuff generally)
seems like a similar ratio? Also not watched naruto and db

(also this ep I finally realised the ED is sung by Shouta Aoi)
caught up on doomflag. Is the next ep just going to be a comedy sequence of ||the Bad Girls™️ trying to accuse her of stuff and not being able to come up with anything?||
while the anime won't last long have you looked into neptunia
what kind of edge
one, maybe two a season. Pushing hard on the theme is more recent
shinkalion is a hilarious concept and with japan's love of trains and mecha it's like "how didn't they come up with this earlier"
but ... why not just draw 五
I think they're over-counting a little
or actually no that's a different kanji
yeah to something readable to someone who doesn't know what 五 is
aside from it looks guessed in the first column
did they? it looks correct to me
what's the technicality there? I've never looked into that
actually as much as it was much more obviously a recruiting tool and not quite *as* good Haifuri was similar to GuP and als ofun
screw you embedding
my recs I don't see there from my top rated:
- Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho. Not explicit but it's not just sitting around in school daily life which seems to be your biggest complaint about CGDCT, they do go on an adventure with major changes in tone and plot development
- Endro~! the hero screws up when defeating Demon Lord Elfnein and causes time to reverse to when they entered hero school, demon lord decides to become their teacher to take them out before they gain power and many hijinks ensue. Has adventure and heroism and text gay characters, their relationships ||don't get 100% confirmed but also don't get rejected by anything in the story||
- Price of Smiles. A weird one that I seemed to like more than most people did, magitech mech war and a drama of people caught up in it. No relationships directly confirmed (it's a war) but main characters (F) only really have anything implied between them
- Girls und Panzer. CGDCT but *plenty* that *actually happens* and pretty much what it says on the tin

There's others I'd recommend as just good drama/adventure in general that's not aggressively hetero at you or that are fun SoL but that's what I can quickly pick out while avoiding what you say you feel is "monotone" and which focusses on girls
when that's actually the major title
... oh right they're titled dumbly and have that as a subtitle
> how shit is my PTW https://myanimelist.net/animelist/AllisonBW?status=6
<@!160142617940590594> why is sympho on the *plan* to watch part
540p is NTSC-widescreen so makes sense and 810p might be cinema 2K IIRC?
she's also voicing spiderisekai she's gotta be pretty damn busy
how good is that I've had it noted
she completely forgets to hide mentions of japan
Main getting to be a real librarian is adorable
I'll hold the bad guys to somewhat different standards of f'ed up than the ostensibly good guys
lesser f'ed up: ||giving panties to duder||. Pretty damn f'ed: ||straight murderin' a guy and then telling her sister it's her fault she's in a wheelchair. I know anime likes to have a "believe in yourself" aspect to it but people generally do kinda need them if they're using them||
nearly finished with cross ange and ||there's some kinda f'ed up stuff here||
not much compared to a sympho season <:BikkiSad:497709420122341386>
I'm still finishing but was thinking "8 if they don't manage to make this worse"
I mean, I'm not saying I'm gonna stop now. Buuuut this isn't getting a *high* rating no matter what
don't forget that the writer chose for these things to be true regardless of how likely they actually would be and could choose how the ending goes
yeah that's also part of the issue I take
> || Well, the littl sister was healed for years so yeah it was her fault for keeping the wheelchair ||
<@!114081181611458563> I've seen anime pull that before (||Black Rock Shooter||) and while it would be f'ed for someone to actually try pull that in real life it really doesn't happen and is a pretty shitty attitude for people to take
don't try telling ~gamers~ that
not 10/10, time for controversy <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

and rating is about my personal preference
^
I have 2-3 other 10/10s, which I'd say even have less flaws, but none of them I enjoyed quite as much
under the same logic while I can find plenty of flaws with XV I have it rated 10/10 because it is absolutely my favourite out of everything I've seen
I rate down or up stuff based on personal preference <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> technically perfect != most enjoyable. To give a slightly tangential example, I'd call Portal a "perfect" game - it has pretty much zero mis-steps, it's perfectly focussed on exactly one thing it wants to do, it delivers it all. It is on a technical and design level, perfect. It's far from my favourite game though
if it's perfect aside from just a few seconds missing, you can give XV a 9.9
also, you can put decimals in your anilist scores
> just found out Arpeggio Ars Nova has a movie <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<@!237964037898502144> I need to find this
(chris isn't she's a good bean)
still an abusive tsun though which is why 99% of tsuns are bad
not seen yet
I mean they also both ||forget anything ever happened|| so you wouldn't know
and are both real-world-based serious drama movies
kinda agree tbh, not sure which part I actually like better but it does feel like two very distinct movies
hot take: Eva is meh at best
Whenever it came up on TV there was precisely nothing about dragon ball that caught my eye
Moka
~~but nana tho~~
If I find an adaptation unappealing I just go do something else I don't have time for that
I know what I said
so tell them to watch the one that's good to watch and read the one that's good to read if they liked that and are willing to
or watch
it's not *essential* that everyone read toaru
if you don' like to read VNs why would you want to because of a bad anime though
I've never read the LN I was talking shit that that content came from somewhere
yes? Having an anime raises the profile further with people who don't read much, the whole point in making a deal to have an anime is because it will help sell more copies
~~I mean it may be more difficult but you *can* by improving the phrasing and blending it with action well this has been done~~
rather than suggest people watch the bad anime why not tell them to watch the good one and if they want more then move onto the index novels if they're supposed to be so good. why tell them to subject themselves to the bad anime
also; the point of the anime is to advertise the light novels and it does so using the light novel's content, if the anime is bad I'm not interested in the LN and the LN provided the bad content
Even freshly after brain damage people have personality
People with brain damage still have personality
also didnt he only get amnesia in the second season
no memories does not mean no personality other anime have done this
tbh I agree I dropped in early index 2 because I was just *done* with this idiot but then in railgun I was fine when he showed up
That does still reflect the fact though that in haruhi you gain information wildly out of order, but it still works both in original and adaptation
it' attempting to excuse why the anime doesn' work, but haruhi, also an anime, worked fantastically with the most ridiculously non-linear storytelling
Haruhi worked amazingly while being non-linear, not an excuse
there's a lot of bs in its plot
great idea
oof starving your money cow of funds
I mean from the genre's whole evolution it's not meant to be lewd or anything. Maybe there's an implication of more maturity, but except for western misuse it's never really meant 15+/18+ stuff
yuri-hime is pretty tame overall
I mean, yuri as a genre doesn't have that either
what is the distinction meant to be
Does KyoAni have a plan for when they're gonna be back to working as a studio yet? (or are they possibly already doing so?)
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>

AAAAAAAAAAAAA
"don't have a boyfriend just be in lesbians with your best friend"?
something's up when the dense otaku is the most normal one of them
I don't think I've ever seen an anime with this much of a misunderstandingception between who all the characters like
holy shit what the fuck kind of wild ride is Gamers!
... there's been a fair few deaths relatively young reported recently, that don't say what the cause was. I am concerned
why would any hints to straight characters not need to meet these conditions
why does lgbt have to be "inserted" and "feel like it belongs"?
/ more likely to have a romance I like
but that's less "these are automatically better" and more "there's far too much to watch, this is a simple category I can check off to pick something that's less likely to actively put me off"
I mean, LGBT+ is a selling point for me, I'll be far more likely to check those out
lol ofc first broadcast was on a sunday. punsss
so it seems that BIY is considered more family friendly than nichijou
should've thought of going to ja wiki I was doing it the painful way
Bookworm is about a midnight broadcast, it appears
Eh, it's very 50/50 and way less explicit than BIY
BIY's are actually pretty early
For a comparison, this is the currently-super-popular Doomflag's timeslots: 
Mainichi Broadcasting System: every Saturday during the 27:08 time slot beginning on April 04, 2020.
Tokyo MX: every Saturday during the 25:30 time slot beginning on April 04, 2020.
BS11: every Saturday during the 25:30 time slot beginning on April 04, 2020.
J:TV: every Monday during the 26:00 time slot beginning on April 06, 2020.
AT-X: every Sunday during the 24:00 time slot beginning on April 05, 2020.
then prime time is all bad japanese reality TV
either late-night if it's teen or adult, or just before/after school if it's a kid's show
I mean first slot was 9:30
since you're probably gonna stay up rather than get up at midnight
japan does it so if something's on early in the morning, instead of saying 1:30 Saturday, they say 25:30 Friday
Aichi and Kyushu kinda f'ed time but the rest are pretty reasonable for teen\adult anime I think?
> How public was the network that *Bloom Into You* aired on? And what time slot was it?
<@!160142617940590594> It was on 7 different channels across the country during its first run:
AT-X: every Friday during the 21:30 time slot beginning on October 05, 2018.
Tokyo MX: every Friday during the 22:30 time slot beginning on October 05, 2018.
Sun TV: every Friday during the 24:30 time slot beginning on October 05, 2018.

watched first ep of sakura trick. Was not expecting *that* much horny so quickly
||more or less extreme than reviewers||
so horny
they really were
I'll see where I get with this
I finished Citrus (anime and manga)
more sakura trick. Girl is *horny*
that was beautiful and I am sad that I never saw it before

I'm not even sure I could afford international shipping for it
I like the joints that are half the size of some smaller mecha kits
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
how many runners
jesus
how did it take this long?
Im guessing you mean a glue layer or such?
also I had big issues with stylet ver 1's hair but the new XF-3 version came with parts to recreate the original - and the hair from that fits perfectly in the same joints and doesn't have that issue

if you can undo an explosion's changes you can undo moving a thing
reading back on the imagine breaker stuff ||being unable to cancel the change of vector is still inconsistent if it can cancel an explosion; explosives still leave all the same material in existence, just a few chemical reactions happen and the energy moving out of those bonds goes into the vectors of the material. Which can be simplified to the chemical bonds changing, which is also fundamentally just vectors of the atom's electrons travelling such that they're bound between two||
two words: unreliable narrator
is this canonically known / demonstrated or inferred?
||"I could stop her from electrocuting you, but she's not gonna kill you and it's funny so I'mma let it happen"||
(there's also a point that IB can do a lot of inconsistencies ||by being sentient if we just assume it's kind-of a dick and chooses not to affect some things even though it could 'cause it's funny or something||)
does IB ignore a coin from misaka?

it does not
which is a 1 dimensional vector
hell just invert the magnitude of all the quantum properties in something and suddenly it's made of antimatter and boom
if you wanna go full meta everything is a vector. energy is a 1-dimensional vector. mass is a form of energy
which is why I'm glad that while airgetlam's power is described very similarly to accel they never go into it too much so they can keep it way less powerful and not really raise questions
try get too meta with your powers and even if you can be very clever at getting magic consistent something's gonna catch you out
even if they were detonated by magic, the chain reaction that is an explosion was natural
The argument being made with accelerator is presumably that it works because the effect isn't being actively maintained, but neither is an explosion so long as it's coming from actual explosives
if it's just arbitrary metaphysical whatever the story needs can happen, if it has to be physically consistent then it runs into the issue that subsequent effects are natural as soon as the esper influence is gone and physics takes over again
it's a lot easier if you just say it's some arbitrary metaphysical "natural state" and let the author do whatever he wants 'cause explosions are natural once initiated, just unusual, but people still would conceive of it as an "unnatural" state
(it's probably just inconsistent writing I'm not making an argument of what would happen in an in story fight between them I'm arguing what should happen by the power definitions and demonstrations given)
once he influences it it's no longer in what its natural state without esper powers should be
equally once the explosive's gone off, that's its natural state
that's not how it's demonstrated though, since all mass of an object becomes affected in all cases. it's not just a thin layer of molecules
which would still suggest he can fully defend himself from things accelerator throws as long as they touch the right
but if he can stop an explosion or a flame or a spark, all of which are fundamentally just extreme heat vectors, then he can stop movement
I've not seen whatever it was I'm only going by what's been written
if he's stopping an explosion that's already starting, that's *more* involved than stopping an unnatural change of direction
aluminium actually can. But when I'm designing ones I plan to seriously employ I go for somewhat crazier designs
https://store.steampowered.com/app/476530/Children_of_a_Dead_Earth/
well, game/sim
I'm not actually an electrical engineer I just know enough of it and have a game that lets you design realistically simulated ones
so aluminium surviving this one is amusing
melting after being shot, sure, but usually when I'm designing these railguns I end up shattering the projectile just from the stress of actually accelerating it even in a vacuum
and quoted muzzle velocity is only 1.03 km/s
although 700 kA actually gets it to over 2.5 km/s over just 10 cm so she's really not pushing it for a very long distance, given 2.2 MA will accelerate faster
just the actual acceleration process of getting it up to speed
... although I am surprised that an aluminium coin is actually strong enough to survive the stresses of 700 kA (haven't boosted it to the quoted 2.2 MA yet)
I am disappointed that key info for recreating misaka's railgun in this railgun designer are missing
inb4 right hand left behind
flicking and instead using the power to create rails in the air does make more sense than using fingers from an actual-railgun-design PoV
> she uses her hand
> as a rail
<@!87512939107450880> are you sure about this bit 'cause I remember (and can see in pictures) that she appears to more flick it
I was more memeing there
dropped index in the middle of 2
Idk I only have vague memories 'cause I only watched years ago and haven't kept up at all
which coin is it she typically uses I could try model one and see how effective it actually is for a railgun projectile
sparks != a static charge. railguns operate by creating a large continuous current through one rail, then the projectile, and back through the other
railguns shouldn't actually be charging the projectile
(left is a realistic-materials version of a gun my ships actually employ)
silly comparison, right is 700 kA on a 1g coin over 10 cm, roughly simulating Misaka. Left is 10 MA (and supposedly she can hit 20 MA at full power from what I read on the wiki) with a 2.3m barrel instead, and an optimised 1g slug instead of coin
Probably as satisfactory as it can be given it's probably not perfectly consistent for how real physics would actually view the situation
the tank's projectiles weigh 20 kg
for a comparison that has about 1/15th of the energy of a leopard 2's main gun, in every 5 gram round
(and much less current at once)
other materials could manage if I had a much longer barrel
but that's mainly because I've brought the barrel length way down to keep it fast aiming
I think this one's my favourite and it actually has to use a projectile from exotic carbons to survive (more exotic than graphene)
(ofc still played for laughs)
IMO that image above basically fixes anything that was wrong with her face. Sure maybe young-looking, but absolutely not below late teens. And it's an actual scene from the actual show. Where she's actually supposed to be looking attractive
https://www.thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/uzaki-chan-1280x550.jpg
and child face has a lot more than just big eyes
it might be that in some of the most extreme cuts her eyes are a little larger and it pushes things, but it's not consistent
there's something a little odd but she doesn't look like a child
... I hadn't seen how many there were before
literally all huge
https://cdn.thenationroar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Uzaki-Chan-Wants-to-Hang-Out-Episode-5-Cover.jpg
if I didn't know Key had moved on from that style thanks to The Day I Became a God I'd be asking if they were making a comeback
(like huge for anime standards)
everyone else has huge eyes too
and the big eyes are just the style of the show
... that's just making her look white
*PTW'd*
even the robot is chuuni now

You're who I think of by the yuri master
if you mean <@!160142617940590594> by "yuri master" I've seen her in symphogear-discussion
but most of the country was barely out of the feudal era
there were a few parts, particularly the cities, that had developed rapidly
even at the start of ww2 most of the country were still living in roughly the equivalent of the middle ages in europe. Mostly farmers, a few craftspeople, all simple housing with basically no development
they definitely were not better at english before ww2
I can force it but "obviously" I wouldn't agree with
I'll be honest I struggle to see that as siren but presumably the people who made the name should know
Liella!, just to see them struggle with the l's
that imas at least looks like it's good CG and being 100% means it won't stand out when switching to it, which is a problem even good cg has
IMEs go zoom
I'm not talking about phone

"you can blame kissmanga" was kissmanga making requests of their servers to steal stuff or sth?

yuca?
yes
maybe he just needs to <:galaxybrain:392079799784570911> enough to understand general relativity enough that he can tell where the time vectors are
even being a physicist wouldn't necessarily catch it all, since plenty of higher-level phenomena, or realistic limits, would only known well by chemists or engineers
magic is easier to have consistently explained since he gets to make all the rules instead of having to work within physics and get caught out by some real principle he didn't understand
ah, but what about when a character who normally has twintails first lets their hair down?
it's great
but once you accept it
the idea of love for a moe characteristic being such a powerful force is ridiculous
like neptunia
you just need to be prepared to go along with its nonsense
culture
:whynotboth:
even if it's not totally accurate
and quantum mechanics are actual mechanics and a scalar is a one-dimensional vector, so two separate disciplines take issue with that way of dismissing it. But yeah, there's no way to make a conclusion and he'll only address it if it's convenient for the story and he can actually make an explanation he's happy with
~~that sounds like denial~~
homora
sympho didn't just ride the madoka train
but given the different production cycles it's likely she would've been hired about the same time for both

I misread that as gay and thought "isn't that redundant?"

I've seen the dolls before but haven't got any
that's very subtle. it'll be over before you know what's happening
ok I was going to probably wait until season over for assault lily since something like that would usually be trash (but my kind of trash), but if people rate it I might have to try watch it
> yuyu and riri
> yurigaoka girl's academy
they really aren't going for subtlety are they
looks like just by buying the french version and learning to read that
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
I thought the PVs already seemed wholesome <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
~~unless ED is borked and they just didn't get it in time for broadcasters either~~
hm
oh true
someone posted a comparison yesterday
v1 might be because it's the broken version funi had, there's an updated one that the live broadcast had
not even rotated, mirrored
aside from the fact it's mirrored
huh, tonikaku kawaii actually managed to draw the moon accurately ~~unlike a certain lesbian power ranger show~~
hakai me no yuuri is shared universe with one I've been reading the manga of. if that's finished I might have to check that out
how many of that list are gay
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
<a:ChrisRage:745358256242688102>
"She Was Both Called God, as Well as Satan" has a neat premise, noting it down even if it's not gay
if I didn't know as much as I do this would be a right pain to read and I'm probably still missing a few things
the one I'm reading at the moment at least has had the pronouns and names fixed up but there's a lot of cases like in the dialogue, where a character trailed off (as they would) and the translation just assumed that was everything instead of editing the english to create the correct implication
<:ChrisUgh:687451696527704148>
I wish translations were more reliable, there's a lot of obviously-machine-translated ones where the person doing it doesn't know enough to fix up its errors

probably, question is how many good ones it happens in
so unless someone watched it even earlier
it aired an hour ago in japan, no?
that's a *lot* of peers
<:hibikiwoah:697147387155841205>
subs?
what's adashima on
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
before I bother faffing around to find out no, anyone know if you can get VRV outside NA using a VPN but non-NA card?
max level witch has been announced for a while
not particularly flat either ~~more than basa still~~
I was gonna say continuing the trend of aoi playing all the powerlolis but she's not a loli here really
it is in endro idk about defeat demonlord for daughter
<:ElfneinLewd:247367764270907392>
which is a reference to the ring, yes
I was just thinking of the webcomic about the daughter of a guy who that happened to and then he married her
they thiccccccc
plus a girl might crawl out of your tv then you have a spoopy gf
which isn't a thing in japan
they might occasionally skip the room in japan, but as I understand it in china and other parts of east asia they might skip an entire floor
even though I think it's most literal in japan?
apparently japan isn't as paranoid about that as a lot of the rest of asia
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
not only cute witch adventures but potentially gay
just watched tabitabi ep 2 and <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiicccccccc
> Iski was talking about an anime where tv spooky girl spooks some guy’s daughter, and ends up marrying the guy (i think)
<@!199928870810419200> no he marries tv spooky girl and has a kid with her, and the comic's about the kid
anywhere other than funi to watch it yet?
It's great I want more
just elf things
watching outbreak company for the first time. I normally don't like degen guy protags much but shinichi manages to not rub me the wrong way. ||plus minori being a fujoushi just *makes* this work||
what anime is it
also assault lily has promise but hasn't delivered solidly yet
it's a shame kamisama couldn't also be gay but that, adashima, and tabitabi are all real good
I've not read either other version (manga's in my mangadex tbr <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> ) but I can see what you meant by things they could easily screw up, and that they fucking *nailed* it
adachi is ||so horny|| already
adashima 2: someone's in lesbiabs <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
how
like
... how did she even get those shorts on
> lying together holding hands with two rings in ED
> just friends
to think the show about yuyu and riri going to yurigaoka girl's academy would be out-gayed in two eps
... they ... they do know "duty free" isn't a trademark or copyright and can just be used, right?
were those rumours that it's going to be a 6h thing credible?
assault lily
so crunchy
that's some neat animation
ALB3 ||The reflection in the blade <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> ||
suddenly 144p
the fuck is this quality meant to be, shaft?
more things that aren't comic girls?
... tonikaku kawaii is a way wilder ride than it has any right to be
ominous
I enjoy hikasa being a disaster of an idol manager
it's certainly one way to pass the three-episode test
... just finished first ep of munou na nana. *what the fuck*
IFTV was meant to be a bit of a chaos ship, since villainess, after all
IFTV is fun
whispering you a love song~
odin has quite the imagination
||that was pretty gay too but it's hardly like things are approaching canon, it's still yuribait||
it acknowledged the 大好き物：女の子 in one character's bio
fruit tart got a bit more gay
gay robots?
||current direction is auto-win though||
I mean, there's the potential it could've been mildly interesting to give him a twist on that power in some way, but it'd've needed to pull out something BIG in the next episodes, and hint towards them, if it wanted to go that direction
then ||*holy shit*||
I was just about ready to drop it for being another MHA with even less girls and focus on this wimpy guy who's just a touma expy
it stays good
munou na nana 3 ||I was thinking all through the ep "you're asking too many questions for someone who knows how to read minds"||
<:doubt:484139588089282580>
plus you're likely to search for the kit more often. like each time you think of buying another, where you'll search the anime once and then have a place to go for it, so no more google
there's a lot who build gunpla without watching the animes
still adashima though. good way to start the week's releases
o I forgot alb got delayed
can it be thursgay already
I don't know if any of it that old is strict-canon any more (granted dub never was)(
understandable
just about all of it
... I'm now wondering if AKB0048 is going to address the fact its world makes the macross setting look sensible
<a:MariaSparkle:688839288082792462>
is kitty a reoccurring character?
or wait no I'm mixing them up she's not worst girl I don't think
... oh. Blonde is also voiced by worst girl in spice and wolf
I can guarantee I've not read it
oh smol blonde is gonna be voiced by nagisa from clannad
that was made amazingly clear in ep 1
*so many questions*
||with him appearing in the ED I have to wonder if nanao is going to come back somehow or it's just as part of the misdirection/because of the influence he's going to continue to have||
||smol blonde hasn't been introduced as far as I've noticed||
||it would've been fun to just have a death a week killing spree but a survivor makes such a good twist||
<:BasaDelicious:699000434786041946>
there is a kitty in ep 3

<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
intense gay ||bowling||
I want a dub of adashima that turns the donuts  into onigiri
for me that tag seemed to be carried by co-protags; kimi no na ha, ngnl, koe no katachi, angel beats, kimiuso, etc
"male protagonist" is ranked lower than "ensemble cast"
following those we have guns, swordplay, school, urban fantasy, CGDCT, gods
apparently <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I feel like this summarises me well
so out of curiosity I was just looking at my highest-rated tags on anilist and
it's pretty smol
that's smoler than aoi
I do hope for more fluff the last two have been very dark
hikasa is good as disaster idol manager
Uncle roger approved! <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
although ngl it's kinda weird that ||they'd send her in with no support. like if they discover her and figure out why she's doing it they're totally going rampage, at least give her a tech team that can set up booby traps on the island or sth||
oh yeah he's priority #1 right now. ||either to kill or discredit him somehow, even if he initially was probably fairly low on the kill count estimation||
but holy shit new guy
she's lucky that invincible dude is so determined that there must be a motive
time for ep4 of munou na nana, and we meet the smol
welp that was nice and gay
oh I didn't grab that yet
"real"

~~but I like full on mecha musume so I probably wouldn't be satisfied with just a weapon anyway~~
eh the weapon designs are so-so to me
seems accurate

I was not expecting tsukasa to be a movie buff
excuse you, tonikawa <:OgawaRead:688429716507721770>
and we finally have another happy episode of it
I've not seen new AL yet still watching elaina
thighday
also does this mean he listens to (mizuki) nana?
what is this ride
holy crap munou na nana
<:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
damnit I'm too behind on seasonals
caught up to AL. Yuyu's catching the Gay
good enough for me
gays and thighs
I wanna watch it fresh first so I'll probably take same approach as ash
... gigguk called munou na nana ||Among Us Hero Academia|| and I can't even argue with that
> that rent a girlfriend was the best romcom of the generation
I'd ask if their definition of this generation starts from this season, but we have tonikawa this season
> although, they have the tedency of almost killing ichika.
I fail to see the problem
... in fruit tart
talentless nana is good
~~make hibiki the protagonist and make it yuri~~

I get the impression ||she might not because she might've made things weird with the childhood friend that was mentioned and now she's too scared to engage with her own feelings because of that||
just ask her why damnitttt u both gay as heck
just caught up on adashima
(and those are totally early Key/VA eyes so you can tell it's mid-00s)
https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/_consume_/8483323/80258/80258_original.jpg art like this was going around in like the mid-00's which was at least when I saw it begin
strike witches would be an early example, but not the start I don't think
no, that's not mecha musume
pretty sure kancolle is marginally predated by the concept of mecha musume in general, which I think started with tanks
kamisama was <:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
munou na nana newest ep was great
I vaguely recalled the guy & figures but not his name
https://myanimelist.net/featured/1627/All_About_Mecha_Musume has the history about halfway down and I was right that it was mid-00's for really getting popular (and getting named)
... what would reverse mecha musume be
~~now kith~~
https://pm1.narvii.com/6444/d39f5f9050ad6634eec4f4be3626a7bbbe574eb2_hq.jpg
if I had to guess I'd probably assume it started with turning gundams into girls, 'cause that's an obvious starting point
it is a good aesthetic
just should've used a nicer way of getting it in ep 2 <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
she knows the good stuff when she sees it
||and I love her she's 100% in for smooching elaina||
oh hey saya caught up in newest tabitabi
gas-core reactors for fission or fusion in general both let you push insane outputs in a small reactor without exploding
We have good ways of pushing the power density way higher than it is but we're sticking with known and proven stuff (or in america's case two generations before that)
or ～particles～ in gundamu-verse
(ie; nuclear)
(you'd also move to a different fuel so it's more just "from the same amount of carried material)
instead the output is ... ok?
the power output should be insane with very low fuel use
the energy required to move a thing doesn't change, though. Efficiency would improve in the ability to gain more energy from the same material
the Saturn V on liftoff output around 40 GW, and more efficient engines need to be even more powerful relative to their thrust (need to throw the fuel faster so need to put more energy in each bit)
currently they don't have that much electrical power but they don't have energy weapons to power, so
I think when they originally made the first ones and picked a number they didn't understand how much power air and spacecraft actually have available in their drive systems
the front lift fan of the F-35 puts out 22000 kW
that's like low end of modern jet engines
really?
that ep was so cute ||but kith already damnit||
... a ||boomerang||? The f, nagafuji? <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
I've seen like half. seems like usual macross silliness
no lily bouquet? <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
||probably not||
also no because you're still using fusion and therefore your 100% is the energy available from fusion. and you do not return to water so you cannot use it as a perpetual motion machine
did someone say mecha musume?
rolling resistance is also bascially irrelevant it's all drag
and also reducing the roof area it has to use for panels to begin with
drag can't really be made much lower without making the car smaller and more uncomfortable and therefore not bought
you can triple that for 2020
these are not 2020 stats, because 2020 is only 30% efficient at best
you can't go over 100% efficient
so it would need to be parked for 30 hours in direct overhead sunlight to make up for an hour of highway
a square metre of solar panel that is 100% efficient, on the equator at noon, would produce about 1.3 hp output. Slow highway driving of 60 mph puts out around 30-40 depending on the car
you don't recoup much
current solar panels are around 20-30% efficient
||necromancer just taken care of||
but now hopefully it'll speed up again ||since she's not being held hostage but has to explain two missing||
but oof that ending
it was a bit of a slow episode
*oof*
munou na nana
I mean the main character had "loves: girls" in her bio ...
but if you're just looking for anything, go for it
I'd recommend tabitabi with a straight face I was just uncertain earlier since I don't know your tastes
the scenario matches so well that your memory forces the details of precious eps to match
a few shots are reused in different places but even those it's 50/50 actual reuse versus new art
just about 100% original every ep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0PwpTemKgg you can really tell it side by side
she only appears every few episodes
it's not the main point at least but there's also no straight stuff overriding it
that character is clearly yuri, no bait to her, but whether elaina comes to reciprocate is unknown yet (unless people have read the LNs)
adventures vary between quite dark and super fluffy, and really nicely animated
Witch goes on a journey to explore the world and has a side character who's totally in lesbians with main character
Fair
I *did* say I was talkinga bout tabitabi
episode 7 starts with ||white-haired witch who *sounds* like elaina telling them to write on the wall, but doesn't show her face. Then we get smolaina reading the story with her mother, and asks "why did she tell them to do that?", to which she replies "Why don't you go and find out when you go travelling?"||

||Then when saya turns up the old man says it's been ten years since it all started, and he repeats it when elaina turns up a month later - including trying to welcome her back, but elaina has no idea what he's talking about with that. Plus I don't think she's been travelling near that long, timeline points to that it was her mother who did it, and was the origin of all these stories, and this must be one of the most recent ones||
||the author of the book she was obsessed with as a child||
||and her mother is totally Niké isn't she?||
tabitabi started out with a few wild eps but it seems to keep getting fluffier by the episode
people really claiming that ep came out of nowhere?
... I didn't even remember any specific setup of ep 5 from earlier but still considered it indirectly set up, because someone that emotionally detached has had *something* happen
hibispoder
https://youtu.be/UZE4ZZiXBQY
||That's what I'd expect. am thinking shimamura is probably so melancholy because of her, so this will stir up that & adachi will become more aggressive faced with competition||
oh, post-ed, hadn't quite finished
||also, new girl?||
||just ask to kiss her already damnit||
and they run on directX
just caught up on kamisama 6 and ||I think katafrakt's right about the world ending being symbolic and something to do with hina instead; my theory is she will pass on, but that fish she got this ep is the one in the ED and will become the family pet they keep in memory of her||

give more ||Outlaw Star||
didn't they all pull out years ago?
similar to how F1 was only so-so popular in netherlands until recently
probably not until after japan gets a WDC contender
even without jumps or blind low traction corners?
aren't the rough dirt roads much more popular to watch than smooth well-maintained stuff?
likely the only way it would happen is if it were funded by the AJRC specifically to try drum up interest
or hell even F1
doesn't mean it's popular compared to street or drift
certainly there's a few places it can be done, but it's very limited compared to say the nordic countries, where it's "pick a road away from the motorways and you've got a track"
rally works well with wilderness roads that are only mildly hilly
japan is strongly either well-maintained modern roads or no roads at all because it's far too mountainous
and japan is ... not suited to rally
that's possibly changing a little but they still really like a japanese focus
the japanese audience doesn't necessarily want that variety of settings, is melua's point
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
do I need to catch up with strike witches so I can watch this new series
my impression is that (latest ep) ||the old friend who just reappeared had something between them and her disappearing caused shimamura to dissociate, so she *thinks* she wouldn't be able to return it. just because she's still hurt over that||
do you have a connection limit set and lots of stuff already queued to download/seed
although I match them up by just renaming the sub file to match the video so that VLC can auto-detect it
BUMR subs seemed perfectly acceptable. properly timed and nothing jumped out as mistranslated
that was pretty good ||and the captain and XO need to kiss already||
just watched the haifuri movie since someone mentioned it exists
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
the ships appeared about 40 minutes in
I'm on like 80
I'll catch up when it's finished then
... are they actually going to start getting couples officially together, Fenny? Do I need to catch up?
it's too relatable for shitposts
so I don't get the people who were calling it great for the first two
I thought it was okay with potential in the first season and got bored in the second when I realised it wasn't going to explore side characters (most specifically the girls)
tonikawa's really pushing the ||"tsukasa isn't human" angle these past couple eps||
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
the cat returns in nana
and the post-ED confirms most of that
so assault lily theory: ||the govt is totally creating the huge in order to develop magi combat powers and yuri was meant to be a living weapon developed from that research but is now going to be saved by her moms with the power of lesbians||
with doujins anything is possible
most of the ones I watch are ones that do finish ~~not that I finish them~~
Macross F?
not so serious but it keeps getting funnier and gayer
ochikobore is also surprisingly good
||not that I want him to||
||in the final shot of the OP he's the only other one with red eyes. I would be more surprised if he did get killed||
mal I don't know where to find tags if it has them
kitsu
ann doesn't have tags that I can see?
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
ylia
go for it
yeah, adachi, she's into you
the contrast between shima + old friend and shima with adachi is just
burn it
that's vastly overestimating how much he received
65/0
ic
iruma?
and looks like we'll be getting a sequence of eps for the finale
a good episode of tabitabi
I wouldn't know they never licensed anything for europe where I'd be able to even try
and I mean fucking literally I trawled it for anything
how about amazon. constant banner ads for their amazing anime service - literally none available in europe
what are the odds on all their licensing going to funi who don't bother to make sure stuff's available widely outside the us
how did their subs compare
someone who couldn't fucking use any of it
they advertised it loads to me
I couldn't <:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
that's one I remember specifically
they also had princess principal
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
oh no is it only 12

||"Oops, all gays"||
this tabitabi ep is wild
they hurt poor baby <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
oh no ||michiru|| <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
what *are* these new talents in Munou na Nana
that would have been outright disastrous to do
if disappearance hadn't been amazing
I wonder how many people believed "surely, it won't be another week" after episode 7
~~start with railgun and never watch anything else~~
also <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
shimamura's hair is still *wrong*
~~HL3 is almost certainly coming now but not in the way that was expected and on an unknown timescale~~
except plz stop being so tragic <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
more adachi too plz
oh yeah
*because wtf if going to happen next*
and also second nana season
I want a second tabitabi season a lot more
it was okay. I'm not sure I'd want another season unless it's gonna start exploring the craziness of whotf tsukasa actually is
we've still got the ending of nana to go
definitely feels like it's trying to set up a s2
yes
very iyashikei
well ok now I definitely want a second season of tabitabi
... wtf is this tabitabi episode
moguo's fatter in the anime

crunchyroll why the fuck you keep logging me out when I'm reading
||it's a weird mechanism though and there's normally a pretty good link in how the consequence plays in||
||the big boxes of important/not important/kinda important||
that ... would make more sense than it sounded on first thought
<:hibiki_chibi_confused_3:647943602227511339>
what's happening
I only know the characters I don't care about here
||Okay, I still think tsuruoka for brother is on the table because she describes "a much older brother", implying this is a case of nearly-different-generations. But, I'm more thinking it's uncle or something.||
||I think I'm right that kyoya is much older than he seems because whether his sister is "jin" or nana, nana describes a "much older" brother who already left and "jin" would be too old by being in the previous cohort, so kyoya's old.||
||I'm favouring nana-kyoya because it makes the most dramatic sense and they're the two with matching pastel hair colours but plenty else is still on the table. It also would track with nana's parents being part of a small rebellion, if they had an invincible kid who turned out fine (maybe they didn't even know he was invincible until he was already nearly adult and he went into hiding)||
||part of me now thinks that nana is kyoya's sister and "jin" is related to jin, which is why they showed actual care when visiting the body rather than just using it as a disguise. But on the other hand, if "jin" wasn't acting when he was poisoned, it would point to a familial relationship with kyoya that they both can't smell/taste||
fuuuuuuck I don't know
||it was my first thought connecting that she had a brother who'd been missing and her parents were intentionally killed (before it was revealed). I'm still catching up with everything revealed and putting the pieces together, but I'm pretty sure she just said he was much older and had been gone already.||
<:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
||that would mean her brother *isn't* tsuruoka though and I feel like "she's like family to me" meant more than just the training.||
||... but he also doesn't mention any powers she might have when pressed, just that she disappeared to "train"||
||oh fuck I was misremembering kyoya's sister, it was a younger sister. jin would make more sense but nana's totally possible||
would be a long wait for season 3 but there's definitely gonna be enough more story for it too. no way is this getting wrapped up quickly
and there's totally enough for another season, particularly with  a few more chapters by the time it would happen
regardless we need moar
||perhaps||
||jin being kyoya's sister also seems likely but I don't think the her being nana makes sense because didn't kyoya say it was his older sister? And nana had an older brother? Wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff needed to make that work||
||... unless lives he's taken are what grant him immortality and he used to be genghis fucken khan or some shit but that would be a heavy character swing I'm not sure would happen||
||yeah I caught that after unpausing. I don't think it's just the show's imagery in general, though - it might not be his fault in any way, probably not connected to his talent, but I think it's probably symbolising the bodies left behind by time. I 100% bet he's *fucken old* and it's all the people he's seen die.||

||he might not be centuries ancient but probably at least since the time when talented went crazy and attacked loads of people, only he probably didn't because his doesn't give him that capability.||
regarding what you said about the opening (and also manga spoilers) ||why are there so many bodies behind kyoya? tsuruoka implied to nanao that the talented have been around a lot longer than we're being told - is this people he's killed previously? It would make sense if he's dense to modern terms because he's ancient. Or are they piled up behind him because of the consequence to his power?||
why's this the *one* time qbitorrent decides to download the ep in a random order instead of from the start so it can be watched while downloading
I was thinking there wasn't enough time left for invisible blade even without hearing that first. I feel like they're going to cliffhang it and then announce another season
||oh just checked saijo was who I had thoughts it would be||
||I also don't remember if we met Saijo already. The name's familiar but||
||I still don't believe tsuruoka is just happily working for the opposition guy or the council, he's running his own designs to utilise the talented to seize power for himself||
... and now I'm caught up. damnit.
39
but this is definitely picking up
i need to sleep
okay
||it's kinda obvious now but his power's linked to tides, for sure||
||... am I crazy for finding it weird that no-one's thinking "tsunami" when all the water recedes||
35 ||the only pattern in this guy's talent I can notice so far is it seems to be working every other day, but that would be too straightforward and not meaningful enough so I don't think it's that||
||I'mma go with the latter because I do not believe someone this shifty is A) actually going along with someone else's plan, B) gonna be fully revealed this early||
||okay so he's fucking serious about this transferring them plan. So he must have a gameplan - either intending to have incidents and use the fallout for something, or he's trying to get his groomed army closer, ready to take over the country when he feels they're ready||
I half want to know how much my crazed ramblings are accurate and half don't
and I don't want to fuck around with less reputable sites than mangadex
crunchy, I have the sub and mangadex didn't go past the current point of the anime anyway
just found my laptop charger to start on 34
<@!297542051057238017> I had to write this down there's too much going on aaaaaaaa
so I've been reading ahead on nana because I couldn't wait for end of season (and screw you guys for discussing it). Finished chapter 33 (which is well past the anime for those who haven't) and been thinking for a while:

||they're not actually killing all the talented, they're using people like nana to "cull the herd" and filter out the strongest who'll be recruited into military purposes and brainwashed just like nana. I don't think he actually hit Inukai with those shots, I think it was to make a point to Moe and he actually missed. They're going to try use her healing exactly as he said; she may not be useful as a soldier but an invincible army would be good.||

||And I bet *so fucking much* much - tsuruoka is Talented. some kind of mental talent, mind control or mind reading - though being so straightforward seems unlikely for this series. He's manipulating everything to build this army around him, and mind control would make sense that he's learned everyone's ticks and is passing on things he's noticed to the talentless as he trains them.||

||I also bet nana's brother is caught up in all the government conspiracy stuff and part of me suspects he might be tsuruoka but that seems too straightforward. 100% though that her parents were killed intentionally to set her up as a talented-killer, probably because her mental skills were noted from her game-playing, and possibly it was set up by her brother. Particularly if he is tsuruoka||
||I'm not sure what the significance of that for a trade-off would be is my biggest issue. THere's always a strong thematic connection||
I thought about pinging there but I feel like with how obscure this is we'd still have to talk all-spoilered anyway
||she might and that could be very interesting, but it would mean either jin's pulling a very long con on the talentless restriction or it's a restriction on knowing the power||
||I wasn't even thinking nana though. I was thinking michiru||
||why would nanao's powers expanding reduce their blockage? And so far it does seem like nanao *does* need to be in contact to nullify||
||which would then mean ...||
||but if we do take what's "known" about his powers as true, I think there's another interesting implication - we don't know of any reasons he couldn't transform other than death or being talentless. Being unconscious doesn't affect it, and he happily turned into nanao without fearing it might not work, so I doubt his perception-blocking affects it; therefore, I'm thinking Nanao was *actually* dead||
||interesting if true. Hence I've been mulling it over whether it's true, a lie, or a misinterpretation of a different rule||
||tsuruoka suggested that might be the case when he tried to sneak on as a butterfly||
||and so he may have been pressuring nana to reveal her talent because he figured out it's not mind reading but thinks it must be something else. And maybe that'll play into some "everyone has a talent, no matter how small" thing later||
||I know but what I'm trying to resolve is the "cannot transform into talentless people" thing. I'm wondering if he actually needs to know what talent someone has - we've not seen him ever use the powers of people who are quieter about it, even when it would be super-useful - like the long-range teleporter. With Nanao I'm not sure if that can count because he'd surely need to be aware of the power to use it, but just transforming shouldn't need that according to what's claimed so far||
<@!297542051057238017> okay I have another theory bugging me now. ||Did Jin ever directly accuse/state that nana is talentless / did nana ever acknowledge it to him?||

hi confused
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MariaCool:687461170961318027> "he knows too much, take him down"
||She's gonna try a lot more but I'm not sure circumstances will let her. At least not completely - she might get some bits out that make kyoya even more suspicious||
||still gonna take quite a lot. he's also still the one person who can counter kyoya and they're currently relying on the fact he can tank them||
||he seems angery and I'm not sure how they're possibly going to counter him yet when he can just make them totally unaware of him||
manga ||yeah. his sister is/was younger *and* went before him||
||it was a hell of a cliffhanger but what episode wasn't||
also hi ash welcome to the manga zone 😛
||and while it's obviously not authoritative over anything the manga does, the anime feels like it cooperated with the authors a lot, and the anime has him with brown hair||
||age mismatch imo||
||kyoya's potentially got memory issues as you point out and if a guy who worked for the talented management council was found to have been harboring a talented - would make sense that there would be no pictures of him||
||nana's older brother is specifically mentioned as "much" older and left the house before she could have the chance to remember him, she only knows of him by being told||
||it's more circumstantial stuff but if "jin" figured out that much it could also explain why he'd go see nana before changing. Make sure he remembers everything he wants to say||
||however even with that weakness I'm not sure what murdernana would've been able to do anyway||
||I'm not 100% on board with the theory since he never seems to really let up on nana, even after his deaths and before he has chance to read notes. but it definitely seems like there's something to it and it's probably at least similar||
||all his theorising still assumes she can read minds for quite a while though, and those don't feel like unreliable narrator scenes.||
||... what if he can smell but forgets what smells mean. so he would still need the notes about when stuff's good for and wouldn't think anything's odd with the gas||
||unless they're not totally lost, just get somewhat disconnected, and he has the notes just to make sure he can refresh everything?||
||his sister was important enough to go to the island for and he knows that has to be lost at some point||
||he seems weirdly willing to take advantage of it if that's true though. he could've just told sorano to attack a tree||

I have watched none of either of those franchises solo
there's way too much LN/manga left
well, "know" adashima won't. They won't be together happily ever after
I hope ALB gives a happy ending 'cause I know adashima won't and I know where Nana'll end
I'm behind on most but close enough to catch up. Only actively up to date on ALB, Adashima and Nana
you're watching a lot
||actually not trying makes sense. He would be trying with nanao because it was weird that it never worked while he was alive||
||based on the timing I still suspect michiru was used to revive nanao. it's 100% the kind of thing tsuruoka would see an opportunity in. Jin might be periodically trying all the dead just to double-check, but either he might be certain enough of michiru to be skipping her, or she might not understand how her power has changed and that might be blocking him||
||and that's why he's also not aware of what his power actually is||
||probably a super-subtle form so he's able to notice all people's tells as he reads them from their mind, which made him super-good at teaching inference from the tells||
||double-checking you're probably right on that he did try before. So that leaves nana - and tsuruoka and moe - wide open for having potential talents, if his restriction is the person needs to be correctly aware they're talented||
<a:CatHug:775135131677491251>
||hmm. for that we'd need to know if he ever tried to turn into nanao before he died||
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
now I don't know what to think
https://youtu.be/U7RRsZfilkE from the anilist description I thought this was gonna be hololive with the numbers filed off
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
pripri crown handler
OH
I honestly feel like I understood more from the trailer
nope
so going in order of airing so I can put them in my mind sensibly:
ura sekai picnic,
maybe hortensia saga,
I'll probably look at soukou musume senki 'cause it's mecha musume,
spider isekai,
edgy cells at work might be funny,
there's a couple idol ones I might look at,
log horizon,
and I'll probably try figure out wtf wonder egg priority is supposed to be
forgot it got ... this ... trailer
I remember finding it as a manga years ago but couldn't find any version to read and was curious about it
it was
oh
... wait was it *that* trailer
ex-arm seems interesting
... is gekidol hololive with the numbers filed off? just from the short description
spisekai
oh yeah log horizon and spidersekai
~~horny drunk idol manager maria~~

loooooooooooong arm
||https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays||
but in a couple months or so there'd be enough for another season
perhaps a little less because the first couple chapters are long
there's basically as much as has already gone already ready
||which also gives a nice twist from when it first plays and seems to be referring to the talented to *that*||
||it's not so much directly sad but very contextual on nana. You can get a sense of where it's gonna go from the title being "To be called 'Monster'"||
||it gets even more painful if you know enough moonspeak to start picking up on the lyrics of the ED. big oofs there too||
||I legit cried even though I knew exactly what would happen though||
||either we tell you she lives and then you get hit with the ED anyway or we tell you she dies and you then think we were lying and get hit with it anyway||
||would you really have been happy if we said anything||
which is also a damn good manga and the anime followed it exactly so you can just pick up chapter 29
probably worth waiting one week and if nothing happens consider the manga
it was deleted so idk if the mistake was mentioning it or copying the wrong thing
OVA might be possible since we still have a murder to confirm the solution of
there was a tweet from the official account that finished with "please look forward to next week" (roughly) but idk if that means announcement about OVA or S2, or it was a copy-paste error
I wanna see what's in his boxes now
||spending a lot of time in a buddhist temple would also track with him not having a clue about modern terms and some of his outdated phrasings||
nana manga ||after realising tsunekichi is probably a play on "unchanging luck/fate" (can't confirm precisely because there's no kanji given) I decided to look up other names. Onodera is "small rural buddhist temple" ... almost like he might've gone to one to learn how to manage his talent and taken that as a pseudonym, if his drawback *is* that he loses memories when the immortality activates.||

||And hiiragi is a plant known as "false holly" that only blooms very rarely. "A tough shrub that withstands drought, heat and charms the entire garden with its floral scent." according to a gardening website||
||"If your parents were anything like you, I'm sure they were very kind." big oof moments||
though reading ahead I knew what was coming
oh yeah I need to catch up on nana
I don't even know what that one is
calc is fun until PDEs
even though it's clearly not
it looks nice ... but it also kinda looks like cg
last dungeon boonies art style is weird
I'll at least give it another episode
there's a weird mix of clearly-cost-saving and someone-actually-cares here. It's definitely not low quality but ...
*I am not exaggerating this*
*three continuous fucking minutes of generic transformation sequence*
I was not expecting though
eh I'm not super excited for it but I like mecha musume and it seemed like it might be an amusing time waster
wonder if they were planning to make some and got covid delayed
but there's no mecha musume figures even though it puts a mecha musume twist on it all here
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Battlers_Experience
actually no I google something that got mentioned and it is based on something
kinda? It's not based on something specific I don't think but it's clearly basing itself off busou shinki and a few other things
not in total, continuously three minutes of just four different transformation sequences
in episode 1
of continuous transformation sequences
*three minutes*
oh my god
soukou musume senki escalated quickly
even if they are it's 50/50 whether they think "okay this is as nice as it seems" or "okay this is setup for something terrible"
I never got into it, at all. Didn't watch it at the time and I've only seen up to about there because I just didn't feel engaged by the characters or that episode
you prompted me to look it up to check and the one on funimation's yt channel is the unfinished version they got sent with the first ep lol https://youtu.be/uSMGTjr7IV0
so it doesn't feel like there's much to really gain from watching more
I'll consider that but I doubt I'll ever continue/enjoy it as I've already been soured on it from how little I enjoyed as much as I've seen and having seen a lot of discussion on it
all parts including figures were planned together
busou shinki is a multimedia thing to begin with no?
but I'm the weirdo who thinks most gundams don't have that nice proportions and prefer frame arms :V
that style of curves can be nice but IMO the proportions are just weird there
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
but there seems to be some weird licensing stuff / disagreements between companies making several options non-viable
as another title
this *is* being called soukou musume senki
also searching "fate nanoha transformation" only finds one video slightly longer than three minutes
this will probably get reused in other eps
that's a movie presumably using it only once though
long
too
way
yeah
though that's not to say you can't skip *too* many
so good cg will intentionally skip frames even though it would cost nothing to add them
that's not something to directly criticise, too high fps rightfully gets called out for not matching the 2d animation
with literally a continuous three minute low budget transformation sequence
oh different name for what I watched last week
... I did not know that. huh
currently only at the start of episode 0 so not sure
unexpected show so far: gekidol, which appears to be post-apocalyptic?
but magazines with scores are a-okay
*hides*
yeah, imagine XV not being #1
huh, melua's right. straight-up lesbian makeout between samus and master chief
https://youtu.be/ihH88jPOTMw
symphogear set off with a plan
~~better than Ex-Arm without the budget~~
the pv explains nothing
idk
but it's
no there was already one PV
and if you still don't get it watch the ep
just watch the trailer
Wonder Egg Priority
exactly the same as already being discussed
otherwise yeah best show of the season
I only hope ||the ultimate ending isn't tragic||
that was very wtf
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
well get it on your done list
> The demon kid one looks to have the most interesting plot of the new shows and i like its artstyle.
have you not seen wonder egg
imagine ||playing death gatcha to get your gf back||
I won't complain about multiple yuris
and solo's point is that that takes a lot of effort to to work out "okay is that something I don't know or is that just as-is"
it's not deep, but it's everywhere
they're in your face, but the issue is knowing which bits even *are* metaphor as he'll use things that most people haven't ever heard of
what anime is this
very not kirito
the second character introduced at the end of wonder egg ep was the main character in GGO
> symphogear
> too much standing around talking
it's just tidier and much more knows what it's doing than every other season
but the pacing and character interaction is way better
the art style's wonky and the music isn't as good
and XV definite best
S1 is better than 2-4 but other than that disagree
I have 39 on my list but could have missed some
<:BikkiAngry:687460699148255292>
I do use half-scores though and there's a lot more on 9.5
yes, that's what I said
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
XV is just that good
it shouldn't be surprising for movies to score better with more budget and less time to screw up

so the worst scores don't show up
nah 'cause "no score" is 0, even though multiple sites allow you to put 0
since it rounds to 0
I think I've rated one thing 0.5 and amq doesn't even register it as having a score
<a:MariaSparkle:688839288082792462>
none of the first eps have an op

how do you watch any other anime
some websites are evil and instead of trusting what your device says it is tries to guess from the isze
it should be on the home page, but might be hidden if your screen is too small?
🥚
mecha musume is its own thing that just happens to be one thing symphogear draws from
it's not really related to symphogear at all

and apparently I need to catch up on idoly pride and gekidol too
w h a t
also I wasn't keeping up with anime for a bit then just caught up on wep
if the show is popular enough it may also offset the loss of less ads by putting more eyes on the ones that remain and creating a mini bidding war
wep being seriously undersold there
something about senpai/kouhai / protecc dynamics, I think
seems interesting
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
this implies there is a trailer that matches the LN voices
"Menou and Akari sound exactly how I imagined them to sound in the trailer"
or did they get to see some exclusive?
that tweet seems to indicate there's more than a key visual?

the most important thing is that they look gay
~~fake nana~~

because amazon's being a li'l bitch and not letting me see my copy 😠
machine translation from WN chapter 1:
||“Claire-sama.”

“What is it? I do not wish for a lowly commoner to address me with such a familiar tone.”

“I like you.”
“… Huh?”

Claire-sama made a blank expression.
It seemed that she didn’t understand.
It couldn’t be helped.

“Claire-sama, I like you very much”
“Wha… wha wha wha…!?”||
because villains are hot
*wakes up in another world, sees the villainess* "I'mma make you my wife"
this is Good
I already bought the LNs in both languages
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
||this uses "sawaki sensei" so ... may or may not be that teacher because this doesn't directly say it's referring to the teacher she was crying with. but probably||

oh wait
||I can't hear him get named anywhere. Suspect the translators might've been given a character list and used that without realising it's early information||
||the subs in ep 3 call him sawaki but she doesn't, weirdly||
||was he a redhead?||
aaaaah
but I'm wondering who ||sawaki is that ai clicks on the name||
new wonder egg is ||oof||
~~it's the gayest therefore it's best~~
🥚
wep's definitely better
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
including the trapped aspect, digimon is 100% an isekai
bofuri is a stretch since it's not got the trapped aspect but it otherwise hits pretty much everything
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
it's just when the floodgates of mediocrity open
WNs emulating a style that's already popular in LNs is not "the start of isekai" though
actually hack probably beats digimon
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
digimon
no way is it the first if it ran in 2012 lmao
... I'd heard that and thought from that it was way older than it is
and I'm still going "wut"
I've watched up to end of 4
what *is* gekidol
but it also makes clear whatever happened is *wrong as fuck*
teacher could be all sorts right now
🥚
praise egg
see this is why wep is objectively better. it's only healthy (aside from the point of the story) consensual relationships between same-aged people
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I'm not 'cause I'm not gonna watch it
some 40 year old meets a child, doesn't see her for 7 years, then takes her virginity after meeting up again is still gonna get <a:police:708876720798957638>
which is irrelevant
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I dropped konosuba because of his panty-stealing and his attitude with it

I'm sure as fuck not gonna watch MT with *that* hanging over him
just make sure to have rice on hand
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
money laundering
even if right now it could so easily go ||120% depressing or 120% happy||
that was a good WEP
I recall most being a metal tip
it technically worked but they didn't last as long anyway because they were on a rubber tip that slowed it down, and didn't spin fast enough to keep it going
so dumb of an idea
which was
I think the last one I got was one of those remote control ones
just fuck knows where
actually, probably have
I had some OG ones I think
I don't think my beyblades broke apart much <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
she sounds powerful
amazing
~~lewd~~
toof
||if it wasn't recorded digitally in the first place it's not crisp||
that's gonna be pretty gay yup
description 100% confirms it and sounds pretty gay
might be another wonder egg
I've not gotten very far in it but I'm far enough to know an anime has potential to be *trippy* (and good)
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
based on blue reflection game, or separate thing?
"generic but done well" is still generic

is it gay
I definitely need to catch up
I'm a few eps behind I need to catch up
am concern for ai
rika was great this ep
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
this is wild
how do we manage to get both wep and gekidol in the same season
oh shit are we going ||full magical girl||
||"Antis don't have the guts to show their faces, but they do have madness. They are strong in groups||
okay so WEP6 is definitely even starting out trying to say something
it would have the potential to be a good show if it just rolled with it more like sympho
but what it's doing is legitimately weird and great
gekidol is slow and oddly paced because it doesn't seem to entirely have confidence in what it's doing
I mean, probably still not the worst thing that can happen with chloroform
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
which kinda evolved into its own thing
specifically japanese western-style theatre
yep
~~alternatively call him shishou~~
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
and I do type that
names are hard
~~and yet people screw that one up also because it's youko if you don't use the elongation accent~~
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I'm not kidding
日笠
idk why english speaking brains like to hold it as hisaka I've seen a lot of people do that. but it's hikasa (which means day / those umbrella hats people wear in the rice fields)
also I make the same mistake so much but it's hikasa
including horny manager in ochikobore
she gets a lot of work since she was mio
(IIRC yes)
moshimoshi?
is lesbiabs?
~~I maintain my stance~~
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
ew boys
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
no but rly she did say it as deeesu
~~not when ai kayano reads it~~
that's gotta be a reference
... I just realised it is actually ai kayano saying that
deeesu
which one is the second
<:02naruhodo:738680831668912158>
||she is a bit aggressive in the wn too||
did the manga screw up?
been slowly working on the (completely untranslated) sci-fi series she wrote in between
I've only read a couple chapters of the continuation
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
the covers are accurate
there's also an explicitly trans background (but important-to-development) character. Will be interesting to see that get handled <:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
'cause it's like *so* explicitly gay
hopefully
https://mangadex.org/title/48912/i-favor-the-villainess https://www.novelupdates.com/series/i-favor-the-villainess/
or in the case of IFTV ||two!||
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
"hibimiku are ||just friends||"
tolkaos
iyashikei vibes
especially the episode where ||she gets in bed with herself||
tabitabi!
what did they get right

moar for the list!

wtaf is going on
gekidol 6
I've not watched any of the remake movies I was assuming one of the originals
which one is the third
who's also ||your mom||
ep 7 ... seriously *what* is the through-plot here
like I'd say it's 10/10 for plot originality but idk what the plot actually is
someone does but he's not telling the storyboarders
it's not off the rails, there were no rails to begin with

startin to get properly spoopy now
catching up on urasekai, currently ep 4
granted the average chapter was only like 3 pages anyway
because I've read a book in english where one chapter was literally a sentence
how long are they
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
live commentary it
🥚 ❗
also there was that episode where they ||traumatise everyone and then nothing is ever mentioned of it again||
none of them can voice act and at least gekidol is unpredictable <:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
I may not know what the fuck is going on in gekidol but it's sure better than this
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
while gekidol has 53%
I realised it's got a rating of 69% on anilist
watching akb0048 because idk I started it I'm mostly done I'm gonna finish it
what about treasure planet
hopefully long production time means it'll be good
it was announced a while ago
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
even knowing they have to survive because there's lots of manga to go
caught up on urasekai. yep, that's some proper spoopy stuff
miniskirt space pirates!
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
newest munou na nana chapter <:ao_cry:500550201971441665>
seed destiny on the- yeah
🟥
I was more thinking
there's a certain ... theme going on here
it was announced a while back
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
<:aistare:677859200726204428>
my only complaints are it needs to be gayer than it is and the spaceship is obviously ||the outlaw star||
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
_hides_
gekidol
oh right
hopefully means even less derivative since it's not just copying all the same tropes
also
> predates mushuko tensei
oooh that could be neat


||Thor's hammer go whack||
hence it feeling very early
7
also catching up sigrdrifa. this feels rather early for climax sequences to start
this is ... something
also I didn't realise gekidol's ed was missing 'cause it was always such a ride
that was quite the ep, wep
who knows
it's gekidol what's plot and what's not
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
gekidol's just the daily palette cleanser for wep
||when she said "stop" and handed a kitkat I had to pause to laugh because it reminded me of "have a break, have a kitkat"||
goddamnit WEP
🥚
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
meh looks straight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ur4SB_F3AE
i member 4:3
do you member 4:3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1t14GnnQhc
but it's only 6 episodes so there's very little that isn't spoilers
there is plot
they're hard to explain beyond "robots and space fights go zoooom"
also some subtle imperialism that's hidden by a lot of subs in gunbuster
p much
only 12 eps total
basically if you're interested just watch both in gun-die order
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4531tj/spoilerwhat_do_you_think_is_better_gunbuster_or/ older fans generally say gunbuster, people who've rewatched more tend to favour diebuster and recognise that it's just a cleaner, more coherent product
and IMO diebuster is the better one but there's some mechanerds who disagree
diebuster is kinda a sequel and I think probably works better watching after, but they're not that connected
they are
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
is it gay
suddenly lots of rayearth talk recently
by melua's definition I call geass not mecha as lelouch does not need any force multiplier and others largely face him down without the robots
primitive power armor with significant force multiplier since it enables taking down giants
i've never watched it idk anything about them growing, I was thinking of the manoeuvre gear
... I would expect AoT to be more normally counted as mecha than madoka
how would regular weapons factor into that?
not every fantasy is mecha even though magic may be a force multiplier
I would possibly add a default assumption that it's normally via something techy (even if magitech) but that's pretty accurate
Japanese definition does not require robots and would often consider symphogear mecha
twintail was so stupid but somehow amazing
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
twintail
oh wait
GitS: Arise I recall being compared poorly to SAC but I think that's probably also an only in comparison thing
looking through my list for stuff I rated particularly abnormally highly, Endro~! is probably the first thing that stands out, but that's just the highest rating I gave. There's probably "worse" that I like, just not as much as that
because a lot of "bad" is just "young audience"
you'd have to ask what "worst" is
but that's not true
the meme answer here would be symphogear
she's also the mangaka of himegoto
so
Not strictly independent, but noripro *is* run by tamaki's VA
that's not hololive that's noripro
(e) all of the above
yes
franxx had plenty of issues throughout too just the cishet crowd can easily ignore them
can you top twintail
I like how you can be totally unspecific googling it and it immediately shows up
"this is such a stupid obsession but y'know what it's great anyway"
twintail was in on the joke with making fun of its fans
yeah I don't think anything I rated 8 or above is so actively bad-that-it's-good as twintail
idk who they are
thought: are there any cases where 4kids managed to improve a dub by removing filler
if it's available from the same seller in multiple regions, yep, that works
and/or give tracking data
for all amazon links you literally only need up to that code part, the item name and everything after that is unnecessary and just fluff to make it easier to see what the link is
idk how to create those auto-international amazon links that switch by your location
swap .com for desired locale
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088P9G8KR
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08R1ZJF9C
I should get the thicc paperback copy
actually why am I considering asking I've bought it
<:KannaPeer:435248223481888768>
I read the WN. was good enough to push through semi-machine-translation
well that's gonna happen when the author herself is queer and possibly trans from some twitter statements
goes into the world of an otome game she plays because she's already obsessed with the villainess
~~go vote for it to become anime https://twitter.com/ninggusupremacy/status/1364787112642416641 ~~
is v good
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> now that's a good look
https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61acterZ+fL.jpg
just seen the cover for new volumes of IFTV
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
It is. ~~go vote IFTV to get an anime~~
but then it exploded and it's like "oh, okay, you guys want it too? Let's go"
she was already creating the occasional bonus chapter too, she definitely had ideas
but that chapter of their life is resolved
not quite "happily ever after", there was plenty still going on
it is a pretty complete story, yeah
there's now at least four
then came back to IFTV when it started blowing up
then she wrote Crying Hearts and I think another short story
it was the end
https://twitter.com/inori_narou/status/1364811776286621705
and yeah it is longer
I don't remember where the volume split was I read it all continuously
but yes kobo is good
pretty sure it's literally just an option in dropdown menus when you get it
calibre is worth having ||because it can crack kindle books to convert them to epub or pdf and read them anywhere||
idr if for anyone else
at least for main character
sol y harem n
<:MikuLewd:739084881614602313>
rei is horny
p sure android kindle can read epub too
uscaukieaunzza
those almost look like they join into one weird word
that's pretty much the only reason it would happen
they can choose to block it but particularly for books, most don't. free increase in sales market
at least we still have one weird show that day
she's not said this 100% directly so I'm not 100% sure, but I can't imagine much else those tweets could've meant
idk I've not been feeling like a musical sol in a long time so even though it gets mentioned so much I've not considered it
ive not seen any hibike that's why i ask if it's gonna be worth it <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
ok
also how gay is liz to aotori
pte?
I mean, it's gonna seem pretty normal to them with how many people visit without knowing japanese
<a:emails:814981410599338064>
she continued writing the WN and the LN is adaptation of that
I do have to qualify that those being bonus chapters I don't know if they're before or after vol 3, though they're not super-far-future
top-tier gays
I don't know the full progression but I know in bonus chapters before it really started rolling again ||they have kids||
and then vol 2 is a chonker
yeah inori definitely wrote a lot it's very much a "light" novel in this case
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
~~season 1 dub~~
there's a reason we've all been recommending it
"I am gundam!"
||unless you like bite-play||
symphogay
they're good beans
I'm just starting gekidol
it's not gonna be tragic but everyone will have a really emotional scene when they figure it out <:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
oh. oh no. ||heart surgery three years ago. I see where that's going||
like okay you don't make it higher because it's janky and makes it look bad and unbalanced, but so does making it slower
idoly pride #6 ... why is the CG lower framerate than the hand drawn
did people get bored of memeing on that
I read the WN and am buying all the rest too
*smuch*
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
gandamu
maybe this was the real gekidol
I don't know what I've watched 9 episodes of
I don't know whether to recommend you do or not
I wouldn't put it past them for that to be the twist
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
we're not memeing the show still hasn't explained itself
good question
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
> unintentionally
no rly I want to know if she's ||only an orphan in her imagination||
||so if the whole crater's an illusion wtf happened to seria's parents and sister. did she ever have them||
I can still hardly believe there's a weirder show than wonder egg on the *same day*
I feel like I'd've noticed ||topdad||'s name being used
but whether it airs on TV is another question
I guess the implication is they'll at least be creating a 13 for the BD
and japanese animation studios don't seem the most experienced with being able to use CG and physics to do stuff like this anyway
part of me also wonders if it might've been really well hidden CG to get that cloth movement but lack of CG ... anywhere else except the WW1 plane and poppies in the ED makes me think not
I did notice the detail i nthat but idk how much that scales the cost to have about 2 seconds of that cycled versus simpler animations that change through the whole thing
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I've definitely seen cheaper, but I've also seen a lot more animated
it's a pretty detailed walk cycle, yeah, but it is just two repeating walk cycles
the most important episode
OPless ep with more content would still be better, but they obviously didn't have the biggest budget <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
oh yeah that gave it a nice *oomph* it hadn't had in other episodes
but it's good as it is
actually I'mma make it related and say I'd've liked if they'd worked in some kind of disarmament themes with the finale. Mirror that ED in the show. That could've pushed my score really high
also not related but I quite like the ED visuals, even if it's obviously somewhere they saved budget
but once you just accepted dieselpunk-magitech macross, that was a good story and a really well done ending
like it's a dumb idea and I don't think they ever really explained why the valkyries couldn't use jets and be stupid OP?
that was a super rocky start but a really good ending
just finished siguriri
I think it's a lot of the body features that tend to be samey to me
though I don't think it's necessarily the skeleton itself? I know I generally like frame arms designs, and those are literally all built on the same skeleton (though there's some that get funky with reversing or swapping leg and arm skeleton parts)
just searching those names, okawara comes up with lots of eeeh designs, katoki is more mixed.
I hadn't seen core before and this does have a bit less of the sameyness that makes me dislike a lot of gundam designs
~~I don't actually like gundam designs that much for the most part, only a few actually work for me~~
spoilerz
dang indeed
and trying to do that in pandemic <:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696> fair enough. Hopefully they learn some things that improve the process in future
and confusing to a lot of people
nah it does say "back to the present", the grave scene was flash-forward
5 seasons and no recaps
if anything it's quite miraculous that symphogear never had that
hoepfully it's a long-term project to improve that
even with cloverworks trying to be a better place to work
april 1st is a day around season change there's going to be many shows starting on it
they announced shaman king remake ages ago
wep 2 taxi boogaloo
<:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392>
is the protagonist a guy tho
so long as the plots hold up who cares if the aliens are no longer all super specifically humanoid shape
I say let them try it
they look generic but imo better than forehead aliens <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
but it wasn't that
I don't know what I expected the second image to be
||I didn't find it obvious and I know who the 10th commander is.||
||I couldn't personally tell if it was aoi putting on a very different voice||
legitimate big future spoilers:
||they hid who's voicing the tenth demon army commander and the 9th and 10th commanders are just named by a colour||
||"I can't speak isekai"|| <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I like how we get to see the contrast of how kumo actually looks compared to what she thinks she looks like
I mean if he's aiming for that average he's several months ahead
she says, having not watched the ep, but knowing a reasonable amount about background anyway
probably not they've just not shown certain key info
oh rite new ep
I'm like 1200 kanji in and doing not bad on recalling them
start now
why wait a few years
~~just learn the language and read the raw~~
yeaaaah
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
why's mal gotta put all the LNs under manga
oh so it is
saaaaaad
but appears to not be on mangadex
author also did https://myanimelist.net/manga/106437/Heroine_na_Imouto_Akuyaku_Reijou_na_Watashi which sounds fun <:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>

looks like no ok

there are more volumes coming!

nobles and commoners and knights? Why, I might have just the series for you ...
chris and claire gud
needlessly violent tsunderes or ones who do not have a reason for acting out are bad <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
what about fantasy high school
I mean I won't complain if it means more gay villainess ...
Claire is, like Chris, one of the few good tsunderes <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
don't need demons
just give me gay villainess and I'll be happy
Even knowing Feldt's VA I can barely tell. Ayahi needs to be given more chance to show her range in other shows too <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
overheating from the drama
I just finished 8. It's great watching this knowing how it all comes together
rewatching 00, I forgot that we're actually introduced to the ||second lockon|| early in the first season
<a:HibikiAniDisgust:777603915716755457>
is this gay
but it's actually a tezuka work showing what terrible things his rise to power did, so actually something worth reading
without context of what it is it's a weird recommendation
excuse you mal?
which plane girls did he do
S2 did at least give resolution to how insane an idea S1's motivations were but also went into a lot of bs
First season was good because it wasn't just space magic
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
the second season already was
||2 lockons 1 gundam||
||Locktwo||
is it another series set in the same universe or an actual direct continuation
also adapt Ecole du Ciel cowards
I thought that was a complete story
wait seriously? 00's getting a third season?
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

you started watching one of the most downer gundams, loris. Get ready for the ride <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>

nothing in s1 indicates gn particles are fairy dust that can ||bring people back to life||
I was mainly just disappointed with how it went back to super robots instead of real robots
gonna rewatch it all for the movie though
I don't remember exactly what does happen to her, but don't recall being satisfied
||she's much cuter than milliarc though||
I've seen s2 and don't remember being quite satisfied
||Nene|| vs ||Milliarc||, who's more evil?
*trauma timeeee～～～*
like graham figuring out who setsuna was when they met outside combat and giving him info
So there's definitely stuff that was going over my head when I first watched 00
no

amazingly somehow most characters seem to survive for s2
but yeah, surprising how many people can die
I am ripping bad guys too

my brain is amazing I started the new urasekai for a change of pace and then thought "this doesn't look like a spaceship bathroom"
s2 having ||no nuance to the bad guys too also makes it less fun. A-laws just unapologetically lasernuking everything, where the nation states of s1 at least in theory were trying to do well by their people even if you could see they were evilly keeping the wars going||

I increased my rating for s1 from rewatch but I'm not feeling the same for s2, the gap's getting bigger
10 eps in and ||it's just ptolemaios making the occasional strike and then running again when A-Laws come for them. It's fully two sided||, there's no complex developments between all the different sides
rewatching s2 it's not just the magic that makes it less good, it's also just because there's less intrigue going on <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>

I mean we had swimsuit sumeragi
oh right ep 14 was the beach episode
it is but *it's so good though*
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
although jeez 3600 chapters of manga read?
I'm at 63.5
such an edgy line
is hard to avoid spoilers for 14 year old show
<a:KirikaUpset:688429724221046872> go watch already loris
even if the style's so iconic that it's now basically a trope to copy that style of super-mode
s1 was great throughout and trans-am only came in within the last 5 eps, even 30% would be excessive
kozakura is prelati
oh neat
oooh I was wondering if we'd revisit this point
<:ElfneinExcited:586715671434493954>
that'll definitely spoil s1
oh yeah
I would hope if they avoided spoilers on the front they did elsewhere too lol
[danger zone intensifies]
so no possible spoiler giveaways
ic. Very well!
actually, who's on the cover? I'm curious idk what version that is and google reveals a few
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
glad I did in the end just for the resolution
it's just definitely not as good
well, I tried
and heck I took a break of like ... probably 9 years before watching second season
I've still not watched that
inb4 tomorrow is the day they block it
... not that I think any *aren't* really
checked the start and end to that ep. Yep, 15 is quite the ep

okay anilist you didn't need to make this graph look so sad
well rip those characters

hey loris what'd you think to ep 15 in the end
and as the JP box set is much more expensive they won't want to self-compete
it is most likely a mix of needing sales figures first to justify, and needing to be on a time delay from the JP releases

are you sure it's the last eps of gekidol and not the special that's the plays they do?
just so I can see the madness unfold
I want to see someone try guess what the eventual plot is after each episode
I expect the plot would make more sense if it did
I don't think gekidol has a gacha?
I thought they only start putting the first volume out towards the end of TV at the earliest
how does the blu-ray come out before the show
wait what
can you wait that long? <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>

I tried a couple times to watch that but don't think I finished the first ep

are there patterns of which ones acutally produce the good stuff? <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
I did not know they have 9 studios

why is it written like this

so sounds like covid might've pushed it just over and he went "fuck it, 20th"
apparently in 2018 it was planned for the 15th anniversary
this is something we know very little about for way in the future
it has one that's already out

but after s2
there's only one
without spoilers is the movie at least better than s2?
||really sets the scene for what gundam-boy's been doing the past four years||
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
https://i.redd.it/ulo2h34tmnp31.jpg fair point with the legs actually
00 is still pretty detailed overall, but it therefore kinda suffers in the animation style
yeah aside from the gundams they're all so ... simple
ah fair
buuuut that's like the only thing
the animation quality's not such a dive. I definitely noticed issues in s1 also
<:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
4 top-notch bangers to ... meh
but not just the animations the music too
this is too accurate <:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
why are all the 00 s2 ops/eds so meh
I might've expected *something* in s1
just got to ||louise and saji having a moment in 00's trans-am. What the fuck was that? Saji you did jack shit to actually convince her of anything and then she just gives up like it's nothing?||
and I'm not sure any human would be able to operate controls while doing it
technically a human can actually take that, but only on their back
but just taking what a regular gen 3 suit is shown to do ... realistically, orbit should be within the capability of that
and true, trans-am is kinda wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey
see that's one place where it's weird. the GN drive often seems like it's not a thruster but applying a uniform acceleration to the craft, so g force isn't felt inside

but then at the same time when they're pulling the hardest manoeuvres possible they still show characters straining because drama
and they'll sometimes do it for trajectories, but yeah, never for attaining orbit. They just have a mystical barrier there because it's more convenient to separate orbit and ground troops
the implication seems to be it's *much* more than that, even on gen 3s
it drains it, but it would only need to be pulling 6 g to let into orbit within the time limit
(heck even without that they're doing 4+ regularly)
realistically speaking, trans-am gundams are doing a lot more than 2g
I'm taking "they can't get to orbit" as writers just not understanding what that actually takes. The difficulty IRL is the sheer mass of fuel needed to be moved at chemical efficiencies; if you can just attain 2g acceleration, you can get to orbit in 8 minutes
so long as they can overcome gravity, you can just get really high and then spend as much time as you like accelerating to velocity
for the saturn 5, fuel use was about 82% to velocity, 17% to gravity, and 0.5% to drag
The hard part is moving at all, which they can do
They have to overcome drag also
and gundams are definitely not aerodynamic enough for lift to be useful
they're shown flying all around the world without any obvious stop-for-recharge
so kumo unlocks ||Ede Saine||
(though under real physics gundams not being able to self-power to orbit is nonsense, they have >1g perpetual acceleration)
do they have enough storage capacity to drive that far
that's what I more meant, can the tau drives actually power something to orbit
is it ever established that the tau drives can get to space under their own power? It's occurred to me that they're sometimes very casual about being able to quickly access space even when the elevators wouldn't be a great option. And with them, they likely wouldn't have much of a regular orbital launch infrastructure
oh hey season 2 has low-quality genderbend ||lockon||
||ribbons is this too but at least with *just* him it's justifiable that he has veda. Anew could still be better but yeah at least gets some development||
||then all these innovades are like "oh look how smug we are because we've out smarted you- oh no"||
another 00 s2 observation: ||there's a lot more cackling "ah look how dramatic this is" villains than before. S1 had a couple people who either looked to honour or duty, saajes for complete mercenary, and like ... only nena for the cackling evil role? Everyone else was competent, focussed on what they're doing||
I did notice that enough that I was bored of the design before I even got into any gundam <:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
(for the colonies)
so heavily leaning into the everyone-against-us perspective
slightly broken metaphor then since there wasn't much international persistent military presence after WW1, that's more a post-WW2 thing
something like that might go a long way to actually making it a not-pro-fascist retelling
does it have anything like factions within the federation that either want to help or hinder pre-rebellion colonies?
so a retelling but doesn't really engage with the full details of how it all happened
<:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392>
are there any of the modern UCs to get into that don't try justify the nazis, or is that just an across-the-board policy now?
<:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
oh no don't make the nazis sympathetic
ah okay. I never knew whether that was themselves or the earth federation using a false flag or something
... are the colonies the good guys? I'm kinda afraid of the answer
fair, I've honestly not seen most. It's pretty much always some scrappy underdog vs empire fight
~~so like most gundams then~~
it's weaker than macross uses but it definitely reminds me of it
yeah, connecting across spacetime and people coming together with the music
but at least macross sets out its bs ahead of time
I've not seen zeta but what it's reminding me of is macross
doesn't guarantee that they knew in absolute detail what the second would be, though. Granted, yeah, you'd hope for more than this
given that it was only 1.5 years after: probably too much pressure to come up with something so they had the rough antiwar and connecting-people themes hashed out and had to rush the actual plot
even though we'd *literally just done that arc come on*
finished that arc earlier and that was pretty alright, but then yeah never had any real consequences develop from it
but he doesn't make them feel like a threatening force
he's entertaining as the incompetent villain trope
yeah it's harsh but ||it's also accurate it really undermines them as a threat when her and the fat commander are part of them. Just makes it feel underwhelming that it's possible to lose to them||
like ||why the fuck are you in A-laws you can't do jack shit you traumatised junkie||
so did louise
not even an attempt to be engaging by either the writers or the characters
so shit
that was just
nice ideas they could've played on and then just no good framing for them so nothing lands
I am whelmed
aaand finished
of *course* it would be
... how did I only just realise at the end of the penultimate 00s2 episode that the episode preview is narrated by ribbons
it's a girls und panzer finale type setup, ~40m-1hr OVAs released as movies
part 1 out in japan already iirc
"Only do mexican kids" -Cocoa 2021
and that seems 100% fair
aaah the VA, not that he's an expy
figures
haven't seen whichever series amuro's from (I'm guessing original?), just know the name. Mostly from gundam battle assault
I've known some people they just didn't send the customs notice to so it got sent back to japan without them knowing it had arrived lol
can't just do it online with the tracking number
and it's annoying when parcelforce get it because they literally have a worse system that takes longer to pay the fees for <:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392>
it's often that way but not always
I'm pretty sure it's occasionally come the other way around when I've tried
RM is only like £8 so it's always annoying when parcelforce pick it up
and then I don't have a risk of import duty
also based on that ... it would actually be cheaper to order off amazon anyway, because the total with shipping is listed as ~7300
do they ship to UK though? When I looked it seemed like they don't
only cash and exact amount is wild
<:hibiki_chibi_confused_3:647943602227511339>
(unless they're an aliexpress seller that doesn't give a shit)
I think UK customs were probably more aggressive at looking at whether gifts were systematically coming from the same place and because of that we still have gifts, but places that tried to use that now aren't allowed to mark it as gift
one import tax is better than paying it on top of the import-to-US cost
and is kotoUS the same prices? I thought I looked before and it was obviously already marked up by the import-to-US, which makes them worse than buying from a japan store that has the exclusives or through a service
it's a flat price for everyone and the seller only gets to choose what options can be taken
while not letting them change the listed price according to these services
like it should cost them nothing extra but they charge the seller more
even then amazon charges for each layer of additional service they provide, apparently
so we don't get angry at them being awful
largely intentionally so
a lot of amazon's backend is fuzzy
it varies, a lot of it is "fulfilled by amazon" but it's still some other seller just listing with amazon
so gsc probably *are* getting less on amazon even than the amazon cut normally is
I have heard that apparently amazon pressures the seller to take less of a cut when they provide these services, and it's only so universally available because amazon is such a big product mover and you get less business if you either don't, or don't take full advantage
amazon is too much of a powerhouse to easily compete with, I'm mainly only going away from there for out of stock, specialised, or exclusive stuff
but yeah
with international not by as much
and at that point yeah you're hitting the funky point
would need to spend an extra 10kY for it to be worthwhile if the shipping is 2kY on amazon (that's what the VAT works out as)
kotobukiya doesn't ship internationally I know, though <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
amazon still works out straight better if I were to get kumoko but useful for exclusives
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
because that was a big box
which thank fuck
I suspect corona may have changed their system though as when I had a similar issue a few months later, I could actually get the code over phone and then pay it without the letter
<:bigbrane:765952467409829949>
went back a week later
didn't get sent
they called, tried to get it sent
then the letter didn't arrive within a week
well, no, not quite, they knew it had arrived
both mouretsu pirates and outlaw star I wish there were more of
was not prepared for ||Fallout 4|| references
I just started watching that yesterday
||Symphogear|| did it better but 00 movie was alright
new ship: ||aeolia x original ribbons||
Not as good as S1, but I liked that more than S2. It may have been silly super robot ideas and mostly just a reason to have a massive space battle but at least there was effort put in
||fuck yeah saji get 'em with a chair||
and I know that those will appear but don't yet know any of the context so <:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
ok so that was a ||movie. Was wondering why we were recycling the same events but even more ridiculously||
like it's so obviously designed to dock around it and be a booster thing? But it just, never happened?
this lab ship appearing again reminds me I was so confused it never connected to the ptolemy?
time to Waken the Trailblazer, or something
wep I might be more forgiving of since they were probably supposed to come an ep earlier? Not watched this week yet
we have two episodes
why are we only just now getting major revelations that feel like they should be episode 2-3 setting up the whole background that the plot is to try fix
so gekidol's just randomly bringing in the ||world peace via total control|| themes, ok
by 2030 half the population will be virtual
babynana
for sure, based on the game
though actually that will have suffering
also, that ^
more no or minimal suffering lesbiabs (because that's mainly what's on my anilist): asagao to kase-san, endro~, manaria friends, bakarina
but it's not the dire situation of hollywood where they have like 1 movie every 4 years that's queer-positive and that's the only point of it and that's the entire representation
they can do a little better, and acknowledge it in extra materials better
there'll always be some beating around the bush as it's not like every single straight ship gets confirmed in show either
I interpreted it as lily being from before that was typical? Also dying before it was medically allowable
but it's *less* of an issue than in western media tbh
like, I'm not gonna be one to complain if we did get more, better, and more varied queer rep in anime
just in a way explicit enough that if you know *any* lingo you know it
even she talks around it
if you want to be so restrictive that they need to have an explicit self-declaration that requires no figuring out, lily in ZLS isn't trans
and that was in the anime
yeah if we need an explicit verbal self-declaration of identity even tohru does
and when she gets ||turned into elaina|| she then immediately spends all her time admiring a reflection?
... she literally declares she's gonna marry elaina?
*really*
are you really trying to say Saya isn't gay af
I'd struggle to name many more characters in general
those are literally ones I came up with a minute's notice while sleep deprived AF
tohru in dragon maid
Mugi in K-ON, Saya in tabitabi
outside of SoL suffering is largely the *point* so yeah you're gonna struggle to find characters like that. It's the same for cishet characters
literally any SoL with LGBTQ this is far less of a problem in anime than in western media
Just finished it. ... really don't know what to make of the last minutes, no idea how they're going to tie that in with any relevancy. I was ready to disagree with the take up to then
sakura trick
space vampires?
god
save some for next year
aaaaa why too many good anime this year
don't think she'd be up for a guy
mugi horny
yeah 'cause she only got to see their stage presence and not them backstage and so looked up to people way less competent than her
gap moe
grow up into a big confident maria
she'll get used to it
I'm not complaining
~~mio as lead~~
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
no, yui was lead
yes it would make more sense to choose the other way, but
the fact she played rhythm?
but I could certainly understand people getting a different impression of her than I did, since I read WN first, and I think this is also missing from the manga?
it's been a while since I read it so I didn't immediately notice that missing
might check shaman king just to see how different itis
only 2 I'm interested in are on the right
I'd say there's a point that the line edited out isn't as prevalent in western media, but it's definitely a thing; first coming to mind to act shittily would be ru paul
yeah 'cause pay is crap like most creative industries, vast majority aim to be freelance as much as possible
... is this parody or
UK parody law is more forgiving than us I believe, but I do not know of any relevant examples that would determine whether that's true
but there likely isn't a non-US-legal english translation bothered with
I would expect in UK using the names would fall under parody, caricature and pastiche part of fair use
adashima shows you can do inner monologues just fine (though the sheer *amount* in VNs may be an issue jesus these things are too long)
K-ON
but I don't know what actual questions I had to ask
so much didn't make sense
what even was there to solve anyway
people put *effort* into not making sense
it also confuses me why something with a reasonably high production value can be just straight-up nonsense like this
good luck if you try, ash
<:TsubasaConfused:739613257534406676>
the last minute or so was about what I probably expected ... but everything up to that
just finished gekidol
I've seen everything but 12, still downloading that
and how was it?
sad
roommates
certainly early on they seemed good
hopefully they can somehow recover in the last eps to have some actual decent messaging come out
that ... was indeed a weird wep ep
well that didn't take long
🥚time, let's see
I was not prepared for that
I watched the first episode
why did no-one tell me about mc's ship
also since everyone talking about horsies i started the first season
tnkk was okay
which was that?
too straight for me
it needs buildup which means a weak open
it's hard to start something like urasekai on an amazing note. A super bombastic opening is kinda the antithesis to its tone
IMO it's coming down more to being on the same level as urasekai but yeah it's not bad yet (though I need to actually see this episode)
I mean they were already trying that with different process, would make sense to review what failed <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
instead of rushing the ep and then moving to whatever would be next
a break and time to think about how to improve the process to avoid this next time would be good
fun
even with all of anitwitter joining in
given how weird some of this half has been
or at least I hope, as much as anything
even if we are getting extra episode I suspect pacing and content will have been edited to try improve the "ending" episode of the airing sequence
looking through google image search for blue reflection and yeaaah
ships idk
yuri and magic are legit
I didn't play far enough in the game to know if that's legit or not
this is fine
then same seems to be repeating
I was behind on half the stuff last season and I mostly caught up this season
all year round
everyone on GMT
you watch a lot
the channel's not such a big name any more but still gets views
too bad that ep had to end that way though
yeah that was def good
buuuut the show's not presented its conclusion on that. yet.
the weird repeating of ||teenage girls in love with a fully adult man|| is straight up shite at least
but hopefully it pulls through
I'm questioning some of the conclusions it might come to at this point
okay?
like space gundams don't tend to get it even when set mostly in a spaceship, but then nanoha does
it's such a weird tag anyway
I doubt it'll suddenly be set on a boat though
the only ships are the / kind
cute girls making ikea furniture
how many more seasons of anime is that
what I hear feels like there's some growth in japan as it gets more accepted, but there's less potential because it's obviously the easier market for japanese-language material to reach, it was already closer to saturation
I figured it's natural that the foreign market would grow larger eventually with the consistent growth
before mangadex died the most recent time I was trying to finish some of the stuff I was reading that ended
i finished the first citrus manga and started the sequel but haven't kept up with most
<a:kissmei:815036028225847296><a:kissyuzu:815036045749911592>
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
citrus is a masterpiece
<:MichaPoint:738234743115743292>
villainess good
neko
but what I read isn't enough for a whole season, idk how much further it goes
actually I lie yeah I know spy x family and it is good from what I've read
I don't know any of the others but there's some interesting titles from what I can read
illya <a:ExcitedFox:753895151558197248>
it's a whole year apart
we've seen it split by one season before, but spring -> winter gap is a new reach
normally seasons refer to continuous cours
I thought people liked keijo
Was that definitely related and not coincidental?
and never went "hey that looks shit let's stop and find someone else to do it"
it's bizarre how they decided to let this studio do it
the manga actually looks not bad
https://youtu.be/cH26lubUs0Y
in anime
of any kind
it's made by a studio with 0 experience
https://youtu.be/0jCPQe9g-TE
with that animation it deserves a 1 no matter how good the rest is too <:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
<a:mememebutt:534082700404064266>
amazing
they manage to cancel this on seeing the results but then ex-arm somehow goes ahead
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_unions_in_Japan
is that made by a studio that's still doing TV stuff?
so that certainly does sound like a lot less pressure if he doesn't have to have it all ready to deliver to the artists
relatively
movies and OVAs like GuP seem to be better at least?
what I hear of the anime industry this isn't that atypical for studios that still do TV
the worst examples that jim focusses on don't represent the whole industry
video game industry in the west at least has recognised the issue a lot more and is working to correct it
idek if it's *that* great with how the trajectory's changed. Opinions will be formed from this "last" ep
if it was keikaku I would absolutely be screenshotting to meme on it
yeah no it was stuff like "reminder: this anime the radio references was made by the studio in ep 24"
I'mma watch that properly tomorrow
the return of TL notes! (not filling the screen thankfully, just background context)
not the highest quality but if it hadn't been labelled as such I probably wouldn't be suspecting anything
good english (worst I've noticed is punctuation error spanning between different sub lines, ending a sentence but then continuing it) and accurate
I decided to have a quick look at the shirobako movie sub that got uploaded, and granted it could deteriorate later, in the first few minutes it's actually a decent translation
*of course* she won't actually die
instead "wait I'd die *panic*" is such a boringly predictable joke and then
that would've been fucken hilarious
never watched any one piece but maybe
but god it was so boring
it's if anything *more* that than recap
I clicked through and it's not just a recap ep there's lore and plot in there
just give us a regular recap ep if you need to save budget don't put actual things happening in it ffs
30% recap episode, 30% new plot, 40% time wasting, all presented through these boring politicians we've never met before and don't give a toss about
also fucking episode 10 or whichever it was
the CG was pretty meh and the story was just so fucking tropey and predictable
that was ... so underwhelming throughout
I just finished it
<@!171395487247630336> were you asking the other day if anyone had watched soukou musume senki
plus three months to get the *actual* ending
and the odds of them doing that under these production conditions is why I'm not super excited
yeeeah
I'm not curious enough to stay up for it, at least

<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
43k unions representing 7.5mil workers
more felt just like they were tired so the occasional bad tense or conjugation
the subs needed more proofreading in the middle/towards the end but never drifted into japanglish/autotranslation
had to pause in the middle, but finished now. That was really good
shirobako
not a TL note I expected <:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
drunk miyamori gud
I was thinking of whether most would be able to tell whether subs are bad using live understanding
figuring it out with repeated watching is also different to managing to follow along live
particularly watching casually
yeah but most don't
that works for SoL sure drama's another question
idk about most a lot definitely understand "kawaii" and think they know everything
but yes, it is possible
I mean, it takes a good chunk of time
while this isn't perfect it's definitely not machine translation
the result of starting with a machine translation and then not editing it too much because "eh, you get the gist"
add one convo where I'd use a instead of the to sound more natural
yeah. I'm lacking the vocab to go entirely without subs but I can understand most and so far 25 minutes in I count two typoes, one of which is just ,/. so real subtle, and one line that's odd but after relistening I'd still say is correct
I'm trying the one marked amateur and at least in the first few minutes it's competent
just cutie with donatsu
no spoilers in that image
I intend to be very careful
cute miyamori
but since netflix has it that means a full year of yarring before it becomes legal
||ayahi almost only gets minor roles|| <:chriscry:711377070076198953>
... is there any info on the random delay to kumo 13?
||"warriors of eros" needed some hinting that it might be the egg-girls way earlier instead of only once ai is one of them||
last ep of the season rather than true last ep
... not the worst way it could've ended, but it could've had some clearer setup for that earlier
welp in that caes I realised I missed the last ep of wep and watched that instead
I didn't see anything about that
several hours past quoted air time
but it doesn't sound like mecha <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
idolmaster xenoglossia
the ||teddy bear|| is so definitely evil. 100% bet ||he's the cause of the war, if it's even real||
but there's been others where it's just ... clearly low quality and not gonna draw me in
that case was definitely worth it
I will admit that munou na nana was almost that for me but there was always something nagging me that something wasn't right, which kept me watching to finish the ep
If I gave everything the three-episode test instead of judging what themes they're trying to push from name/poster/trailer and deciding whether that's actually interesting to me I would have -37 hours in the day to spare
"these unmanned weapons are actually manned and people are dying in droves" is a weird concept to try sell that it's actually managing to be hidden. idk what the twist is supposed to be, if it's supposed to be when the public discovers it then eeeh that feels weird
eh, it's not really grabbing me at all
I'm just in the middle of the first ep and already thinking the same
https://youtu.be/per8vo2sOLI

~~macross was serious it really is an idol show~~
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
yurikuma arashi
no really macross is an idol show
naaah definitely not
or macross, that's idols
watch twintails
and that gets quickly corrected
the only not-girl
yep
in almost exactly the same way
it's only mech if symphogear is
<:TwinTail:815037531975319593>
especially twintails
all my suggestions are 100% serious
all my suggestions have girls
yeah that's the reason it's not gone on my list
loris was overwhelmed by The Gay™️
with all that ||handholding||? Hard to believe
I've seen lily's pixiv idk about that <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
twintail is far better than such a shitpost has any right to be
the OP too
fuck it to catsite
I've been meaning to watch that
lesbears
the very gay bears
(that was also my suggestion see im good)
and that clip just reminds me how weird it is whenever windermere is mentioned in macross. since I live just like an hour and a half away and we went there often as kids
glasses shirabe is pretty good
oh?
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
yeah this is very much symbolism
sus
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
loris how did you make it worse
~~twintails has figmas in the anime~~

<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
https://youtu.be/DDHYL1hTe5k real best op
also card captor genocide
endro has demon lord elfnein
but not gayer
twintails are good
I barely remember how it starts so idk what you're seeing
idk if I'd fully recommend it until the last ep comes out
yeaaaah I didn't mention WEP 'cause WEP's kinda ... iffy
been waiting
zombieland <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
just watch raw
cup?
I possibly would be if it had girls
loris i am also gay gimme cute girls
and not feeling the op from that
I didn't watch that one, too many guys
https://youtu.be/r_IhzrSFtEc <@!722121666641133608> good op and a real recommendation for something to watch
idk if fma is as weird, I feel like those VAs I'm not used to hearing them as mature women like I am with hikasa
hearing hikasa as a teenage boy is weird
there's very much a point to it in bear
in fact if you have issues with yurikuma arashi and the eating people I'd be inclined to mention that wep is kinda ... much ... worse ... on that point
it gets WAY more extreme later
no you really can't
anime has nana tho
that would be much more entertaining
or wait is this not the horse kind
I suppose that's one way to cash in on the success of horsies
oh she's one of the commanders of ||BC Freedom|| in GuP but I don't think that'll be where I know her
where do I know her friend's voice from
letting her walk up and ||peek at your panties|| sure is a power move
started fragtime
kumo
oh yeah okinawa aquarium gays looks good
huh, not a lot coming out on tuesdays
but *jesus* is it loud. and puts out a ridiculous amount of heat idle
I turned mine back on recently and it somehow still works (though it has been replaced for a rrod before)
no-one makes hddvd any more
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
so now we can see chris' XV inspiration in HD
||aah was that it, it's been a while since I saw it||
||maybe a shrine that was used in the process is gonna get torn down or something. And yeah I've been thinking he probably knew her while she was alive, he focusses on her a lot||
||though I wouldn't put it past the comedy element for this to just be a time limit on a loan he needs to afford something that's keeping them re-alive||
||it's gotta be something severe to get that crazy man down||
||for a moment I thought the cassette player might be because this is pre-dead but no it looks like they're just that outdated||
y'know what sure I'm excited for this let's actually watch via crunchy for once instead of downloading
super cub feels even more like an advert than I was expecting
I mean the manga's actually good from all reports, so I'd call it unlucky that the licensing managed to end up getting passed to such a shitshow and it never got checked up on
what kind of deal did they come to to recognise HG?
wait what the *actual fuck*
japan has a lot of competent seiyuus trying to get jobs. english industry, much less so
I've not seen much of it but it seems much less obtuse about its symbolism that actual ikuhara stuff at least, where you become unable to see the trees for the forest
nah not super big brain stuff
I have a tiny bit of an idea from an hour of the game but I struggled to follow the symbolism because I couldn't keep track of which characters were which
I like 300 years max level already <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
oh ||Laika|| is cute
okay yeah that could be pretty weird. This is just young adult, not seductive
*googles* idk anything about fate
this just in: god is gay

More aoi engrish!
aoi as a mature character is ... unusual
I have like 4 but that's more than like half the week, and just seeing the list is wow
so many shows on saturday wtf
s'fine while I'm considering I might play it at some point I have a decent impression of it
I thought the idea could be neat though, just fighting against life problems instead of some big overarching villain
ah I was wondering if I just hadn't got to villains as far as I played
she feels more mature imo
I guess a little?
there's already ||unprotected handholding||, so
||anime is known to be a different plot, different characters, and they've announced another couple games. hopefully that means they're committing to making something out of it and have some good ideas||
and it might develop more than I was initially thinking
slow start is fair enough then
oh I forgot about that
and everyone's apparently got a sister and I didn't figure out who's who
but like the abstract scenes at the start
"I am happy with where it's at"
also there's interpretation of the question; he may mean "I have no attachment to hold onto it and keep it going"
"Don't they know about social distancing?!"
it's also so clearly copying the art of ||a colony drop||
yeah that was super obvious <:MichaLaugh:816901827349184513>
I mean, not really so rare
I think she's going for death
some, both
<:OgawaRead:688429716507721770>
definitely a few more twists that I know are coming but I don't know which way they're gonna go
well that was an interesting episode of Vivy
yesse
the slime witch
aoi doesn't normally voice characters in their 20s
and ||Azusa x Laika|| is gonna be good and cute <:MikuGay:336656810788388864> ||even if it's probably not gonna specifically ship them||
it is
<a:ShirabeBonk:801207951645605958>
are french subs normally bad?
<a:ShirabeBonk:801207951645605958>
died of ||a heart attack from seeing her first facial hair||
unfortunately both of them still have guys but that's a hard one to also fulfill
depends which you want
so idk
D does have an idol unit yes but it also means less focus on any individual girls except freya?
F is the earlier one if you do plan to watch both and want better context
then either F or D will fill that purpose
It's technically one long continuous story so some setting things would arguably make more sense, but it's not necessary though
Macross D
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
they just want a ride to the community centre
he didn't cheer at her winning live
not that it's definitely going to happen
he's saying that that's the goal he's going to have to motivate him
It's been too long since I saw it to argue with that
surely
they had to know
god
... no it's certainly not
~~mangadex~~
https://streamable.com/ucmvwy I'm also gonna say this is easily my favourite OP of the season
I was concerned about Vivy in the same way at first but the more episodes go by the more I'm confident it's trying to have a positive message, and the drama and action are *really* good to back that up
86 is good to me so far but my opinion's gonna vary a lot on how it gets handled
daaamn Vivy's getting good
it seems that way and I'm 100% for it
oh right that one too, though I'm borderline on dropping it
I think the only other isekai I'm watching right now is spider
300 year witch is good so far
https://twitter.com/MangaDex/status/1383796420700901381 oops

most do have a lot more happen than this, yes
are things actually starting to happen? I'm borderline on dropping it
proper SRW releases in the west too?
I mean she only thought to share her phone number days later so yeah probably
it was already after school tho?
instead of having to walk back with the big box
why didn't they ride the cubs to the shop though

||Idk if they gained the ability to before gaining admin powers but they can both just create spiders using that at the human's point in time||
||least I don't think they do, I def recall most of them popping back eventually||
||no the other mothers||
why sad
||When mother separates herself into some underlings and each of them follow one of the mothers is smort enough to fight back. IIRC the others die tho||
||demon lord is a fusion of one of kumoko's mind clones and some small remainder of mother's mind||
fair
<:AzusaEHHH:827211636334002197>
I thought from you starting a spoiler convo you'd already know about it
clicking them would be like 50/50 "fairly innocuous" / "wut"
||half spoder, then becomes an administrator and can change her form at will, in theory. She seems to like the shiro form though||
||I'd imagine a good cutoff would be to end the season when she gains the god powers||
||I at least hope it's gonna get that far, didn't she already identify that form in the evolution chart?||
i just wanna see ||sexy half-human hybrid spoder|| already
but she wouldn't keep signing up for more work if she hated VAing
so I'd imagine she has more "fun" in other roles
she's commented that finishing a symphogear season, she generally feels relieved more than satisfied, because she feels like the rest of the cast are way better than her and she has to try really hard to keep up with them

not just since it's interleaved differently, but yes
we've not got far enough that it's essential to show them so we don't know how it'll be worked in
I believe it's that they *are* skipping it, for now?
what is it
magical girls is slow but I'm generally liking it so far, as long as it actually goes somewhere it should be decent
not bad but feels like it's missing a lot of bass
rip
but I didn't watch many

all this spoiler stuff gets explained in the most recent episode
I just checked that one the other day for more translation but still no more <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
given the website exists though it's probably gonna happen the only question is whether this report has the date and studio right http://komisan-official.com
the website still asks for username and password then 404's without it
_pats the innocent ikxi_
~~how's that relevant~~
but given that it wasn't done last ep that is NOT where my mind first goes
I get that it's supposed to be ||gore||

also that'll still leave some dead references in the registry but that's not such a big deal these days so eh

it's not blocked windows just doesn't have a fuckin clue what to do with it
utorrent borked itself
uuuh I just put the error you were getting into google translate and it says *there isn't a torrent app installed*
utorrent is malware
use qbittorrent instead

new BRR ...
(I'm pretty sure they were salaried fro mthe start?)
it probably helps being salaried so they weren't being pressured into maximising frame output
their earlier stuff does look good, so long as you ignore the faces
those eyes
the earliest for that that's coming to mind right now is 00?
but yes it didn't pop the way digital can
hm I think a couple things before that started looking alright, like haruhi
and if you check this for c >> v and subtract out mc^2 you find it does approximate mv^2
the full form is E^2 = m^2c^4 + m^2c^2v^2
~~that simplified form has nothing to do with relativity even at relativistic speed~~
smol
now for 86 instead
not too special as it's gone so far, clearly a setup episode
interesting ep
someone did (in potatoish quality)
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
why's everyone so slow to upload vivy
I'm like 2/3 of the way through vol 4. is fun
it was but it's also an earlier ep so she's made it past that one already
particularly towards the end are some great ones
I'm pretty sure that's the worst episode though
oh yeah that episode sure happened
||shin doesn't engage that much so he's a good vehicle to observe things but not bring it up||
it does use that kind of foreshadowing in general
feels like they'd be "lol sure you wanna die kid"
eeeh with how little they seem to care I was always dubious of even that
which is probably reasonable
while 86 does eventually reveal that there *was* a development that made legs comparable to tracks and viable, and by who, it never really goes into detail on what changed though
crabs are land crabs
<:MikuGigaBanHammer_1:754804130660352092><:MikuGigaBanHammer_2:754804130861678744><:MikuGigaBanHammer_3:754804130756821023>
<:MikuGigaBanHammer_6:754804130945433650><:MikuGigaBanHammer_7:754804130891169932><:MikuGigaBanHammer_8:754804130593112206>
theoretically, assuming you have perfect control logic that can figure out exactly how to place them well and some *massive* torque on the joints
six would more-or-less eliminate the risk that you try change direction while the leg that would push you that way is in the air
even if four is probably one pair too few
still a bit unbelievable that they'd manage to be faster than tracks or durable enough to be worth it, but yeah, does make a lot more sense
a flash of the crash early on wouldn't land as well as what the first ep did IMO
yeah the anime's reflowed a bit to package things in episodes instead of drip-feeding hints *as* much
you're just sorta supposed to infer that the para-raid is safe to start with I guess
annette will probably cover it in an episode or two when they start talking about shin's voices
pretty sure the anime hasn't explained it yet
thermoses are magic flasks
looking up examples and found this to laugh at
but magical things are ma-somethingelse
and so it's the thing you say for the thing a person uses
魔法 is mahou and 法 is "method; law; principle" so it's that mahou is "the technique/method of magic"

interesting but there's one piece of concept art so far

wtf was that twist

WHAT
uh
86 building up the kill count
halkara you dumbass
but yeah following poetry over separated sub lines aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
plenty's still happening with that and I don't entirely follow it
all the poetry makes newest BRR ep interesting but hard to keep up with <:confusedcat:733450451311132702>
wow
... vivy's on time for once

<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
||federation||'s supposed to be the largest by a long way and have the manpower to take big death tolls. Though yeah 5000 at once on the regular would add up very quickly
japanese authors: big number go brrr
the ||federation's|| often are but then in other places they feel about right. it's weird like the editors only criticised certain points so there's a mismatch
and we see the middle
tbf the implication is with san magnolia the KDR's way worse but most of the D's happen right at the start or right at the end
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
they would've but I also didn't enjoy them nearly as much ||without lena|| so I'd want that much to be compressed down in an adaptation that doesn't ||spoil the reunion||
It'd be better to not spoil the ||reunion|| but if they do that then carry on adapting I'd hope they put 2 and 3 into one - 1.5 cours, don't wanna be without Lena for a whole season
yep
||Idk if the anime will actually show them survive though. Might end on them disappearing into the sunset / lena having to defend against *all* the legion||
||though the trailer did spoil the deaths by only giving names/VAs for the ones that live||
wonderful
there's a few who died before the series start that might be hard but do share if you create a table
just the fact that it's a popular image you can slap on a lunchbox or something
there's going to be some thought to it, but nowhere near the kind of extent as gundam or transformers or pokemon
most kids shows in the west that were to sell toys that I try think of ... are just dubbed anime ...
certainly japanese storytelling is different and that might be an attraction, but if anything there's probably more of it trying to sell toys
I mean, stepping back a moment ... how many western animations *are* to sell toys? The first ones that come to mind are like, atla, fairly odd parents, powerpuff girls
I remember dropping destiny and that's about it
it just declares that harm worth it
00 has hints of that but it at least acknowledges most of the earth alliances aren't totally evil and acknowledges the harm the gundams do
I vaguely remembered them splitting off
isn't seed basically also entirely black and white to good guys-bad guys
duo you mary popppins mfer
massive, gaping logic holes
people were definitely a lot more tolerant of holes in the past
zechs just being like "yeah I totally know what's going on with the gundams I know they were designed with specialities already" instead of just saying it's likely
when you have to install a photoshop plugin for a medical exam#

00 is W without the fridge logic
heero what the fuck why blow it up
how the fuck did she get into a military base
who just leaves their own birthday party for a dude that turned up yesterday and was such a dick to you
sure why not
?!?
and trowa just magically makes lions trust him
Duo's cool
also the open contempt the military officers show for each other, so pompous, no-one there to just do their actual job
and then of course she has a crush on him
also the peak edge of "hey come to my birthday party" *rips invitation, wipes away her tear* "I'll kill you"
he is so damn edgy
hacking into military secret systems using a school computer
the focus on "look at heero isn't he so cool" is so damn funny
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
and the translation is so wonky
god this is so cheesy now
rewatching gundam w
MR BUSHIDO
I think the 1v1 rivalries can be a bit ridiculous with the way they're solely focussed on sometimes, but they *do* provide narrative driver. And I liked how 00 didn't keep it 1v1 but had multiple rivals with the thrones and saachez, and gave multiple characters beef with saachez in particular
wait what
char
oh wait
my brain is blanking on CCA
even though it would be much more realistic
also because they want to have imagery of the pro and antagonist gundams fighting and it's hard to do that if you focus on ranged
rip australia
shoot em
why are they all just standing around watching as trowa and quatre get out and stand in open air
protagonist armor
that's a very short list
how did he not get obliterated by the shockwave of bullets the size of him
no that's fucking great
it's the most stupid edgy scene
than helicopters sure, planes rarely. Especially if they ever end up against the wind
why do they have a fucking blimp 200 years after starting space colonies
oh hi tall goose
ex-s possibly a bit overdesigned with too many boosters though
S-gundam looks not bad, huh <:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
which would they be?
PS1 only having one voice line for everything was great
I just remember "burning fing- burning fing- burning fingaaaah!"
I don't remember that one tho
on the ps1
I've never seen any of G I know them from gundam battle assault
potentially controversial take: rhythm emotion is better than just communication
he does but it was a choice to give him that scarring and that he wouldn't just live with it anyway
mr bushido!
see: chris in nehustan
masks are just like villain design 101 anyway
saachez wasn't beaten by protag though
mech blew up but turns up again anyway? bleh
yeah good pilot who clearly just gets out of there in time, fine
since that means they're hardly competent enough to be a rival anywy
oh plot armor rivals who survive a clear loss because they must is bad
patrick's great but he's a comedic foil rather than rivalry
kyrios ... idk I normally like fliers, especially with a real transformation instead of just "put the shield on the back" but there's something off about it for me
I like its shield fins though
yeah that's boring
... I somehow missed that cherudim lost the sniper cam you're right
true for exia and virtue but cherudim and arios are cool
though wrt connecting weapons directly to generators, this is the feature that makes virtue better than seravee
fair it's not like we don't have experience with bad wikia/fandom writers
that seems to also claim it's using the same generator
this claims it's the same generator
https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/MSA-0011%EF%BC%BBExt%EF%BC%BD_Ex-S_Gundam this states that's the power of the generator it connects to
max of 12 MW, while it has weapons that hit 56
... they may have tried to make it more realistic but the designers still put the reactor power output way too low
in animation they hardly have any target acquisition time anyway and it would probably be considered to reduce the coolness of just pointing and shooting
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
design wise I think I prefer the dendrobium's missile wings and long boosters but it does look cool
~~where's the chest~~
"this is just dendrobium with less armour"
though that would still be very doable with short-barrel vulcans
and that's why you shouldn't let an artist just pick a number that sounds impressive <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
that would easily fit even with much larger ammo drum
https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e08c435fd998d4e0c0a0161145e016ac-c
it's very not small and as i said it's gonna depend on the calibre
bigger than that on most gundams. Series that trend smaller sure there might be an issue
though gundam heads are already pretty huge so unless it's a very large scale gatling that's not actually weird to be able to fit them
okay that's actually pretty neat
and of course they're still not revealing anything about tae
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
more tits than anything
beeeg

is it yuri or are you just thinking of it as one
it didn't it's still huge it's just not in the parts you're looking at
a lot of people think it disappeared in like 2011
the fact you think of 2018 says how much it's dependent on whether you're paying attention
there's still loads of popular vocaloid producers
that's more likely you're just not paying attention
flamethrowers are nasty
wufei I think a massive flamethrower like that is probably a bit much
"heero's actually a very kindhearted young boy" oh sure mr I'm gonna kill you is kindhearted
the background in this scene has a *very* obvious cut where they have to move it back because they were moving it too fast and ran out
definitely a good guy
now this is a character
you heard me
trowa ans quatre are definitely a couple
amazingly dramatic death there darlian
they have explosives so powerful that something the size of a travel makeup kit can cause serious structural damage to a room and they *don't* base all weaponry on explosives?
relena's figured out the millenial dream while all the millenials are still kids
welp they finally told Lena in 86
haven't been bothering so far because it's been good enough but I think I'll be rewatching this one with YTT's translation
huge section in the middle that doesn't really follow at all, and mistranslation bullet (having used the phrase it's part of in earlier episodes) as palette
... the translation for this episode of vivy is whack
BRR definitely on a consistent upward trajectory
"oh they're clearly having a moment I should leave"
BRR: ||No! Momo, bad! Do not lie to your friends that your gf who's also sister to one of them is still alive and doing evil!||
great choice
yep
||"WHAI?"||
except for D, yeah
stoopid spoder ||getting caught in webs||
Is ||Ariel|| actually aware, at this point? Or does she just know about kumoko?
<:thinknyan:799049090193293342>
I don't remember reading enough of the wn to know but ||I do not trust reincarnated potimas to not be evil||
overwhelmed spoder
watching now
I saw that and just wanted to get a *pop*
the west is very "oh hey japan's doing something weird and cool" and likes it for a bit then forgets
romantic subplot for shinon was dumb but overall that was actually pretty good
just finished Starship Operators
oh yeah big time
probably 'cause the subs didn't translate it in a way that made the reference understandable <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
if only a little by the end of XV
it's not quite hibiki voice it sounds less childlike
ye
pretty good opener so far <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
starting crown handler
everything must have a mobile game these days
very ... pointy
someone get on that
for some reason that made my brain imagine a <:KirikaFish:717138469381734471> but instead of a fish it's a potato
all of them at the same time. put all the first episodes on at once
okay thank you max level witch I needed that cold open after both 86 and vivy
also oof the post ED
it feels like 86 is gonna finish the book story a bit before the last episode. Wonder if they're gonna go into the next book ||just enough for the big legion offensive to start||
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
I don't think it really worked though
I remember having a weird beast-megatron toy that tried to turn into a car

||I thought the point is they used elf to unbind her outright||
still clearly did their actual best for it ~~unlike a certain anime from last season~~
far from the best thing ever but has a nice idea for the plot, even if the studio's clearly not skilled/well-funded enough to do it
just watched https://anilist.co/anime/109217/Eden/
twintail is well-done but it's well-done comedy, not drama

<a:kissmei:815036028225847296><a:kissyuzu:815036045749911592>
also always does great
yukachi has crazy range but it's another case of you start picking up on that range and she's super recognisable
and he's like a side character
you say he's hard to recognise but someone I know recognised him in Yorimoi in like 5 seconds
whos that then
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
yeah I can only tell there because A) I know to look, B) some very particular sound to her breathiness that is at least uncommon among other VAs
hikasa has really good range but if you've noted her in a few then you can pick up the particular tones she has
they pretty much all have range, it's whether you can identify across the range that gives it away
which I think is the real thing rather than range
I feel like I would recognise her there but only because I feel like I've noted her in roles that sound similar
<:ShemHaEvil:642229421062750208>
||dun want 20+ episodes without lena|| <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
there is though I hope books 2 and 3 become one season otherwise it could drag a bit
86 more likely to get sequel seasons to be remembered that long though
I wouldn't put it past either of them to even be among the best of the decade, though there's plenty of chance to be outdone yet
90% of it is a character drama and easily competing with Vivy for best anime of the year
the mechs aren't particularly prominent they're just a mechanism to make the action believable that kids would be able to fight such an overwhelming enemy
86 if you're not watching that
no none of us have heard of it
still highly rated so I'm not too worried
and they look fucken great on the cover

<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
book 3 of IFTV on thursday
shur why not
but yeah, as above sailor moon does actually have black pupils. Though old video means it's not such a pure black and it's contrasted by reflections - which is more similar to IRL than you might expect without actually studying a person and seeing things reflect in their eyes
I looked up what sifas is and suddenly realise I will have no chance of figuring out what character it is
it's amazing how people managed to lewd the black hole
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
sailor moon actually has black pupils - but also huge reflections
https://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sailor-screenshot.jpg
can't think of an exact example though
though I feel like black pupils probably were used in the early 00's
to maintain the same level of overall contrast when larger the darkness needs to be reduced
plus being smaller the dark contrast is less noticeable
it will partly but also actual pupils don't look totally black, since there is some reflection from within and a significant amount of reflection from the surface
<https://youtu.be/wi8sbvZ0CQE> I don't recognise this, I think youtube may have leaked a future vivy song <:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>

oof I've got elaina on wishlist but idk when I'll be up to trying it after the anime

... I'm also in the middle of that
paused for a bit to reread villainess since vol 3 of that's coming
I'm like 1/3 through 5
||she's also the one who actually engages with what was done to the 86 and how fucked up it's left them - she's going to be the driving force between the lasting development they have, not just them interacting with each other||
||yeah same I very much had to try read as fast as I could and read ahead to be sure how much longer I had to wait||
I've heard a couple people mention TYE but mostly manga readers so idk if it's actually better or just people are attached from the original

watching it now and I agree. Slow start because of the tone they want but building into a good plot and a complicated contrast between our protagonists and antagonists
y'just need to know what you're lookin for
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
it does a lot different but it's the same thrust ||particularly into XV||
I was literally just about to say
at the moment there's just random ones every now and again
who knows if it'll ever have a strong revival
it feels like mecha burnt itself out before that
just asato likes mecha
I will say that 86 is *fantastic* and while the mecha are cool they're almost irrelevant, the story would work just as well without them being mecha pilots
it's almost a complete story on its own but you're always gonna be left with "they clearly have a continuation even though everyone tells me it's bad by comparison"
yeah I was kinda thinking that ...
unless you've hardly seen any anime
don't think top #5 though
There's a couple gundams that are good without that clarifier
like most damage being from the hull heating up and so having active cooling
it was amusing watching starship operators and seeing how they actually picked a few aspects of space combat to go harder on than most even realise is a *consideration* today
even though I know I should
planetes I've not seen
people just follow the ones they know of and think they can do
the real rules are so hard
there's almost no true hard SF
while I definitely need to rewatch both I think it's that diebuster sacrifices that hard realism in order to focus on its emotional core?
occasionally you get a finale movie but it's very occasional. mecha does like compilation movies

you watch everything with a girl lead
ash how have *you* not been watching it
It is pretty good. I like 86 more if I rank everything from this season but Vivy's the more direct WEP comparison and I still put it as my #2
at least this season we have Vivy and while I'm not 100% in love with all the steps it's taken it's been waaaaay more consistent
I like both sci-fi and fantasy and even both mixed together. But WEP just randomly threw it in and it didn't feel like it served any narrative *purpose*
the heck is any of that supposed to mean
||some android that is supposedly causing all the suicides but also was created by the idiots who're getting the girls into this mess also the girls they're saving are other universe versions totally unrelated to the ones they want to save and when they "win" their girl just disappears. They get no kind of closure, even, just poof "you've saved her now"||
and this is clearly *supposed* to be a show where all the symbolism meets to carry a message
eeeh I found that plotline iffy. Even the antagonists are iffy, it's super-unclear what kind of message we're supposed to take away from the fact they even exist or fighting against them
we'll see if this helps bring it back
a lot of it was good but some of the stuff in the last episodes was sure iffy IMO, put down the score notably for me
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
still getting everything vaguely fixed
has been for a day or two
idk anything about s2
I've seen s1 and it was so-so yuri
how yuri is it

I'm not watching that much though

and finally ||the merge of body and demon lord|| won't be spoiler once people've had chance to see it
and the animation's fine this ep until the very end <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
ooh okay so ||the merge is already happenin||
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
gotta wait til tomorrow ash
nah it's thursday
Okay spoder that's one way to do a cold open
well done ikxi
... yes it has been for the whole season
landslide victory
https://animekarmawatch.com/ranking/chart/2021-06-09
potentially beyond this ep as I don't know how far it goes yet ||she will be after merging with spoder brain||
it's very good and its best episodes are 10/10 but IMO it definitely has some misses compared to its potential

didn't flip the normals more like in compositing they just cut a hole in the image
macross 🔺 you want
the people freaking out about the character list on the site in the reddit thread is fun
just for the alternate perspectives
I'd say it's a case where even though they're almost perfect parallels it's worth both watching and reading it
but the anime just chooses to gut punch you with them instead
there's technical details of the world that make some things make more sense, and it's more introspective so you understand the reason for some character's feelings better in the ln
a good chunk of anime original but it's all stuff that blends in perfectly adapting things that we wish there was more of / work better on screen than some of the more introspective scenes would
||fido good dog||

<:ChrisHappy:696166094238515252>
aoi yuuki adopting a ||death metal bunnygirl|| in newest MLW
so slight twist there
granted in sakura quest she had kinda given up on that
though the parallels with sakura quest - failed idol in the city moving out to the boonies - are also now obvious
I don't pay attention to studios that much so didn't realise that's who we're talking, my interest is now sustained regardless
it's set up to be gay but I am concerned about the significant risk of it not being
this week might slip but it'll still be fighting
would be more surprising if ep 9 wasn't top
kinda ... didn't make sense where it was going
started with good ideas
yeah
https://tenor.com/view/bodacious-space-pirates-determined-courage-gif-5151269
the new ep?
or ... no, idk, they sometimes refer to it as /mio but other times not
/ mio is apparently some kind of special they're going to broadcast
oh this might just be re-deciding how they're going to do it
but ... why the heck would that happen
it's way off done airing at 24 episodes
also call her dad fgs
dasgfdagafdsa
KOGUMA JUST STOP TRYING TO ACT LIKE A BADASS AND CALL EMERGENCY SERVICES
but then why not delay
other than maybe they want to delay the blu-rays so they can build up more momentum since 24 eps
yeah that was linked way back in the morning on the official site. Idk what could happen that still leads to them broadcasting the series
I'd say I'm disappointed compared to what I hoped for from the start, but it was definitely above plenty in the same season
I think supposedly they were understaffed partly to try write in a more consistent manner, with the same person handling the same jobs on every episode for more consistency (instead of random outsourced eps that are noticeably off-base with the rest of the series) and that failed
a lot of the story notes are fundamentally weird (I've talked before on how it doesn't seem to really have anything coherent to say on the whole teen suicide stuff) so I'm not sure but maybe 15 eps or sth could've been long enough to tell it better
maybe aniplex did some other stuff interference wise, but if it went in anything like this direction it was gonna be a tough sell
I don't see how recap forced the weirdest and most incoherent parts of it
I don't think not having to recap would've saved it, really
yeah it gets fucked up and hasn't yet really done anything to justify it
also kinda recognise red riding hood but couldn't say from where
I recognise everyone on the left, utena, and I know girl in back is a precure
without context you'd 100% think that's from a R18 doujin
it was a random one that came up when I was just going through every seasonal on anilist
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
https://anilist.co/anime/125446/Kageki-Shoujo/ from the description if this ain't gay af I will be highly disappointed
weird tags but ok

given the big name behind it at least a few will show it here - when it finally escapes japan
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
I mean it might next year
since OVA and ONA tend to get subs pretty fast
I just listed everything in the season on anilist, too lazy to filter everything except movie
though movie
oh more prillya
aquatope and dragon maid, meh at everything else
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
or any that are confirmed so far
but she's not listed in the main characters
so a little late but yes
aug first
I can feel the gremlin energy
she's a gremlin again
https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/a90fad42708eff7181e5f0b3c3d04c5e1623807465_main.png
definitely a few things hat didn't air yet
I only pay attention to episode counts when it's something unusual (p much "not 12 or 13" these days)
<:catbrain:847879295996919888>
maybe that's for one of the last eps
I was expecting some ||"Now that we're not buying winter stuff, let's buy her a cub too."||
the magic of ||handholding||
and it's really jarring
he just randomly throws in almost-perfect english words in japanese sentences for the episode titles
... who's the narrator for the end of eps in sakura quest
this almost starts to redeem ex-arm
yeah I've definitely seen better powerpoints than that
lmfao
that's ... a lot, no?
it better be nonstop
yeah that's about where I accepted that the CGI was not helping this ep at all
and the best shows of the season will be over so nothing to take comfort in
next week's gonna be wild
||assuming they don't asspull some dumb||
||next ep||
||the robots deployed this ep||
<:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
they can probably at least finish this battle, no?
well, "reasonable"
which *would* explain the potato animation mixed with reasonable stuff
feels like they ran out of time for episodes but instead of a recap they've just been padding eps so we don't cover as much as we should
which is a fucken weird way to do it
and I doubt there's time next ep so they're only gonna conclude one timeline
||that's not happened yet||
and with one more ep ... there's definitely something they're going to not cover either in kumo time or human timeline
So I'm not sure that spoder ep was the absolute worst we've had ... but it's also way below any good <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
oof
oh no reused shots
definitely not as bad as some eps have been so far
okay so we got CG but they're at least using it to create some dynamic shots
okay spoder we've gotten *here*. let's see if all that shit animation was to save budget for here or if it remains potato
yeah my first thought watching that maple story vid is "ok but the reason most mech anime is bad is not the animation quality, even if plenty lack that too"
(if you're using taiga it has a seasons tool that works pretty well)
p sure they're all just in cinemas still
this kinda stuff

anilist assigns movies to seasons too
first one on my list starts jul 3
apparently for movies anilist considers it to have already started
oh hey bandai can manage semi-decent faces
how do you adapt something without reading it
do you do that
... how
amazing
there's a reason it's 5
she did but only a little and VA was credited as ？？？？？
she's still mostly 3d
was she in 2d at one point?
"why fix it" oh I don't know *maybe because it can singlehandedly take on half your army*
how does that happen
also somehow duo's the only character with a brain when he's also the most similar to kirika
so much happens and it develops so unnaturally
but seriously how are we not even halfway through just communication as an OP and heero's already exploderised the wing, relena's father's dead and told her that he's not her dad, zechs already retook his homeland but is still acting like an edgelord about it, and now relena's off to murder une
and I'll say at least those have competent animations
I don't think I've *properly* seen EW just the iconic scenes
I've only finished 10
how the heck does this keep going for 49 episodes
but then we go to another scene and everyone's leaped like three pages ahead in the script and they're retaliating before they've even reacted to an attack
any individual scene is slow and undeveloped
and it's simultaneously paced so slowly and so absurdly fast
wing is planet earth on crack
00 is what wing wishes it was
but yes I am 100% seeing
'cause I already rewatched that a few months ago
and we're supposed to believe the gundams are smart and wouldn't fall for a dumb trick like that
supposedly one was a decoy but it felt more like both were
still don't know what transport mission the gundams were supposed to be intercepting
then doesn't actually do anything
but treize acts like he has some grander plan than that
still don't get what OZ are trying to do other than generic "take over the world"
i wanna watch it through and try figure out what the heck is supposed to be happening
it doesn't know what it wants to be
i did not remember it well enough to know but it's so dumb
it really fucking is
whytf you just leaving him outside instead of bringing him in the cab
u ok there bud?
what are the colony pilots trying to stop
I'm still not clear on what they're supposed to be trying to transport
une the only part of your plan that makes sense is make heavyarms burn its ammo early
"we'll lose unless we have our own plan this time" why there's nothing suggesting OZ have any more of a plan than they had before and you came out fine
surely you want to fight it when it's at its weakest not strongest
????????????????
immediately after noting its exceptional manoevurability as an aircraft
une plans to take out wing gundam by luring it into an air fight and shooting its wings off
carrying on with gundam W
the whole premise is fanservicey and homophobic
franxx is just bad
symphogear is mecha
robot is a subset of mecha
but mecha and robot are different
yamato is mecha
it was
oh time for smol azusa
it's good to have such a dumbass character who's legitimately fairly competent
https://i.imgur.com/NkHQzJZ.png
00's like "fuck you idiots for *still* being unable to quit fighting"
IBO is way more depressing 'cause it's just like "yeah capitalism's even stronger and spread to mars and we ain't tryin to fix it we're just trying to carry on"
00 is go-to start if you want massive scope struggles
eh I didn't connect to the characters of IBO at all

seed is less of a meme than wing but that still doesn't mean it was that good. Particularly since destiny's sitting there trying to convince you to continue that way
~~debatable~~
cypher r u ok
> recommend wing
> trying to get someone into gundam
so accel world, though I've not seen it, probably is mecha
we talked about what actually defined mecha a while back and this was a good definition we agreed on
though it seems there's going to be a special same time next week
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
86 ||and we have Kiriya's first appearance||
was a dude pre-isekai
d'aww kurena
wow they're really goin for the irony ||with the abandoned school with kid's calligraphy saying "peace" and "future"||
only indication so far is that the soundtrack has some titles that spoil what's gonna be in part 2 <:ao_smug:502674652724985867>
also no season so who knows how long the wait might be
that's the assumption so far though anilist doesn't have a count for part 2
and has it been updated? last I looked second was only expected to be 12
only 11 in first cour and it's split
time for last ep of 86
spider, mlw, tanya, uuuuh
don't hate it either though and not bored of it like the RX-78
from what I've seen of barbatos (haven't looked *too* closely yet) there's some interesting features to its design but I certainly don't love it overall
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
haven't unlocked it yet though
all I know about g-reco is seeing how funky it look in g gen
I suppose the very simplistic logic of that is the kind of thing japanese companies like to follow, rather than do anything daring with their money that might make a big return or flop
someone must if they were able to get it greenlit
~~or people in the west~~
is it the parts everyone hates, or the parts that people with taste hate?
pretty sure I'm only following it as well as I am because of the obvious 00 parallels so I can tick it off as "this part of 00 but not making any sense"
wing has some good mech designs and *great* memes. Story makes zero fucking sense
doesn't mean their justification was good though
understanding would be a good theme if there was good justification for *how* they came to understanding instead of it just being twin drive magic
I rated the movie higher at least but it's still below s1. and being a movie it has less chance for shitty sideplots in the middle
him separating his old image by being shitty does make him distinct but it's only for like 1 episode
one of my favourite bits I think is actually at the start before everyone's back together. Like it feels like where everyone spread out was actually still written like S1 with how people believably fell apart. But then the actual coming back together just lands fairly generically and it carries on in the same way
while they were in the elevator, sure, but everything outside it and the long scene of trying to stop the fall dragged IMO
yeah true
at least if it's faster hitting the ideas at a better pace might make them land better without getting bored in between
There's a lot of parts, like the elevator terrorism, that get dragged out a lot
it'd still be worse but at least faster
I wonder how much it could be saved by doing a fan edit down to like 13-15 episodes
it's alright for a gundam but a disappointment by comparison
it is a different show that is still worse
she was introduced to section 2 but they weren't pushing her into it, she went "I'mma help! I'mma replace kanade!"
nah hibiki definitely made a choice
that's not a rare plotpoint
like
it's also hibiki
definitely gonna have to do that rewatch with YTT subs
idk if the logic of the plot necessarily follows
it was a nice ep
well
now to find out if vivy can also nail its landing
yep
wonder what that's gonna be
~~and she's right~~
tbf she's also said that usually "<mecha series>: the movie" is a compilation and bad
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
huh ok so at least some of it's not bad
*prepares for the probable appearance of mel saying they're compilation movies and bad*
that's fair
so it's like, 8-9 / 10 for me, very good and the final scenes were well-done but it didn't really justify why they were happening
also yeah 90% of it is top-notch but the main plot in the last few episodes was ... just ... weird. The ||Archive||'s motivations or why it would give up for that reason don't really make sense ||fair enough it's probably seen a lot of trauma but what about singing changes that? I guess that vivy can still sing after seeing that? But why not then just engage with dialogue with Vivy instead of trying to kill everyone? Heck, why not ask for a therapist or to have other AI's help deal with everything 'cause it's too much for you?||
<:LenaHehe:804185589334802452>
none of the epilogues at all
yeah
they really wanted to cliffhang the anime onlies
it's not the same kind of idol show as love live but it's very much about idols
rather than incidental
eh, macross it is kinda a focus point that they're idols
the plot's just so nonsense and I did not like the characters
I was cringing a lot at 0048
I like idol anime
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
I did not think 0048 was very good
ur an idol anime
whereas revue they're not actually idols and symphogear the idols are incidental

I just watched Kakushigoto on a whim, idk where I even found it
facebook are probably even worse for not being fair to the uploader
technically don't, in japan, I think
that character is polka from one of the newest hololive gens, who is very strange
cocoa and saki did a duet cover of it
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
like it'll make a difference
unless it's a *really* キラキラ name
that's true jisho will give you the full list
they're going to struggle with modern names that use weird ateji but for *a ww2 destroyer* it's going to be spot on
so it recognises word it goes for word
not a name translator
and you're asking a general translator
https://myanimelist.net/manga/95228/Hanakoi_Tsurane
and your source for that is?
hanakoi is a *word*
not really
urakaze is just a normal, traditional japanese usage
karen is a western name and 華恋 is an obscure ateji to attach it to a japanese name
however as a proper name and an old one this is going to be handled well
they can have multiple readings, including the same as the singular, when put together
also this is one of the *kaze ships
any "translation" is likely to be wrong since being a name it doesn't get translated, but the reading it gives is most likely correct since it's a ship class

maybe it'll be mildly more competent than the last few but I'm not expecting miracles from this studio
wait I thought it was just gonna be a day or something, they don't know when? lol
chris powerful
this tag has an interesting top selection
I don't even remember what I've got noted for next season I'mma just see what pops up
so ... canon ||aliens||?
but it doesn't feel like a series that's getting chopped would get those three minutes
it would've worked without them but I enjoyed them
it's literally 20 seconds of complete disconnect
<:KirikaWhat:671948299179130885>
but
... so they asked for an extra three minutes, and sure I get that for the songs
ok let's go catch up on ZLS then given this spoilerwall ...
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPZgBtMYoFKypEG2SCvBN9A
cocoa and saki
they're serious about it
ZLS ending was on the poster all along lol

<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
yet if it were split cour it's like... one episode too late to have been planned to climax here
i mean that for a 2 cour show we're hitting very intense points already
I've been enjoying it but it is moving to a little odd locations, particularly for exactly mid season
_goes to check the fridge for alcohol_
<:catbrain:847879295996919888>
* i am still not sure if I enjoyed it
gekidol's probably about as far as you can take it and still make it maybe-enjoyable(?)*
gekidol was this level of <:catbrain:847879295996919888> by like episode 4
though I do need to watch the newest ep
nah gekidol was way beyond this
yeah some people who didn't check that might be disappointed
it uses a decent range
51 isn't that uncommon on anilist
and he certainly seems to deserve it
write-up about the directing and animation in 86 that gives high praise to ishii
https://blog.sakugabooru.com/2021/06/26/86-eighty-six-production-notes-04-11-and-final-impressions/
it also makes it harder to find the source since not all image searches can ignore it
mainly because basically all content on ifunny is stolen. pretty much no-one uses it as their primary upload so if it's uploaded there credit is lost - plus it's unnecessary addition to the image
yes
reverse image search suggests it's adventure time
86 special ep is just a recap, disappointing. Though english version of the ED + secret preview of ||Reginleif||
there's not much power scaling even with the basic stuff too, it'll randomly swap between gundams being able to totally resist basic suits like shenlong just ignoring the people attacking the rebels he's staying with, but a couple aries and a leo manage to seriously damage wing in the first episode
yeah that's pretty dumb
why can relena's butler detect when someone else is googling someone
setsuna it made 100% sense once you had the context
I don't feel wing has really done anything to explain why heero would be fucked in the head either
<:LaikaGun:852623096816336916>
smh
and zechs is so bad at hiding that he made a copy of wing that even relena's butler figured it out
now someone's being *really* obvious by following them in a black merc in the middle of slumtown morocco or something
I question the ex part
how did trowa get a whole goddamn gundam into a circus tent with no-one noticing
and most places if one is *massively* obviously the bigger and original product you don't get it
but you do have to like, use a trademark
i even understood a fair chunk of the text and whut
... I have no idea what to make of that trailer
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
there's maybe a couple from frontier I guess
... I don't think most macross songs are jazz or swing? At least from the modern series
except some of the earliest
while there is an overarching canon they're all written to be standalone
macross is quite odd, conceptually
the two on the outsides
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/macross/images/e/e3/MacrossDeltaposter.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151223080120
actually I've just seen the plane I'm 100% sure
I'm pretty sure
macross delta
https://store.steampowered.com/app/551170/Onmyoji/
also yeah taller
samus has longer hair, ~~bigger boobs~~, more angular/less baby face
ranma 1/2 is also 80s
and things weren't progressing quite so fast then since it was still all analogue techniques
original dragon ball is a 4 years newer than macross but the animation is notably not as bad
yeah uh I haven't seen a lot of 80's anime but I've seen some. Macross is special
arent sh, ot and mr about to end
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
teaser PV is on anilist so now it just shows up
got a few others to finish but I got a fair bit from this season

not fictional science
sci-fi is fiction that is based on science
gits is scifi
sci-fi doesn't have to have any magical elements
symphogear is scifi
I mean define pure sci fi
kanata no astra is on ptw, but i have loads of sci-fi
mahou shoujo as a genre has conventions that neptunia just doesn't even notice. It neither follows nor subverts them, they're irrelevant to it, because it's not MS
as cursed as this is I can't argue
diebuster is mecha but she doesn't use a mech
nep is not MS lol
heck, neptunia is arguably mecha
battlesuit is a subgenre of mecha alongside robot
IS is mecha
symphogear is mecha
mecha is not robot
which is all neptunia has
it follows/subverts more than "characters are girls, and have magic" I'm pretty sure
purple heart's a different kind of dumbass
subverting is different from ignoring because they're totally tangential to anything you're trying to do
he gains power and it's the character development that results from that
though nepgear has a little of that in 2
the CPUs don't have to gain that power and the overarching plots aren't coming of age stories
they don't transform they just *have* power and MS is a genre that focusses on coming of age stories that result from *gaining* that power
they don't get weapon though they already have the weapon
but that's the limit of it
I'll say that you could make an argument about hyperdimension 2 because of nepgear's character plot
nep doesn't follow anything but "girls and magic"
and that's not gonna fly
"girls and magic", if it was the only requirement, would mean konosuba is MS
a show *can* be both mahou shoujo and mecha (musume) at the same time
they're learning to use it
they have magic
they're witches
more than neptunia though
SW is mahou shoujo but only weakly
magical girl is more specific than that because it's about them gaining/learning to use powers and the story that revolves around that
mangadex has a lot of features back now, though certainly not fully
yeah. it's only a relevant genre at all for nepgear in 2
other examples?
the rest are just outright not MS
also I literally just said the only place you could make an argument is with 2
it's just not the focus for that part of the story
plus she *did* learn in the past
and she's not the only one with powers
this is also another point
those are their powers
it's not a story of learning to use their powers
that's uuuuuuuuuuh
the publishers are cowards
you presumably knew what you were signing up for when they pitched it
boo the publisher
loris emotes are pretty cursed ngl
*unless* it's an original
there's lotta money in anime but relatively little goes to the studio
particularly when it's all originals 'cause then they don't have the issue of middlemen taking all the money that tv studios deal with
but I hope for less bad, not good
i'd hope the studios that are moving to split cour are less bad
[frantic calls to the BD presses] "*We need more horsies!*"
no time to get subs done before airing
that lends creedence to the idea that they're doing it last fucking second
orite i've still not watched ep 12 of brr 'cause I got distracted
questionable
45 minutes of new animation with a month's work would've been wild
like dude even if you walk out just stfu and say it at home don't wreck his chances of doing anything in future
he walked out during the first screening and told the press it was bad. Completely publicly shamed him
but other movie studios in general it's true of
tbf with ghibli I was going to mention hayao doesn't sound like the best boss to work under
huh, none? fair enough
okay fair they can still get screwed over on an original, but if it's something being proposed by their writers, for instance, it's much easier to avoid getting screwed
uuuh that's ...
wonder shrek priority
how many are yuri
i wonder what the odds are that production will take the exact wrong lesson and instead of properly scheduling will instead stop hiring whoever they think leaked the fact production was a shitshow and we lost an ep ~~definitely won't be gaijin~~
*had time
oh god
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
that's separate to mincho vs gothic
how
yes

雲ですが、何か
your discord is using mincho font for JP text while mine just uses boring gothic
how'd you get fancyfont
really trivialised what it seemed like the plot was gonna be
imo the whole idea of frill ... wasn't great
just ... completely failing
I would say they feel like a first cour if it wasn't for just a few things in the last few episodes that really feel like they're *trying* for a complete resolution
I recall something about that
the wave of ||eyeballs||
I should get back into it but yeah it's a lot
I'm gonna have expectations for this last ep if that's what they're claiming <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
... we'll see if it's the outsourced stuff that messed it up, I suppose
~~I don't remember her enough~~
other than riko best girl
I would pretend to be offended at that but I don't remember tlr enough to do so
or something
～teenagers should fuck and have kids～
the mech designs were kinda interesting but bleh at the whole plot
yeah I was disappointed with it at like ep 7 when it decided to be homophobic
based on the ED I think kumo would approve of disco eyes
oh but it looks like ||you can take her out of the spoder||
... the spider face is weird and also *what the fuck is that dripping*
oh and ikxi gets his ||nai wa~||
so congrats, studio that made beserk 2016, apparently you can do something reasonably good
and while it's hardly fantastic the animation's definitely way better than the previous eps
which I wasn't convinced was possible at that point
but it does actually manage to end both parallel plotlines at decent leaving off points
so completely opposite to WEP, spider actually managed to have a reasonable ending
spider finale ||I'll say that I think they actually *did* improve the animation, amazingly||
well the story's not over
guy's kinda a dummy for taking the whole episode to realise who his housemates are, but remake's pretty good so far
go smack your internet company to get set up faster
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
... bokutachi no remake is weird and I only just noticed, halfway through, that this is a double length episode
understandable
excuse me?
such as?
just kept adding in weird notes that got worse and worse
it was interesting concepts to start
I mean I question even the fundamental script in the latter half
<:OgawaRead:688429716507721770>
pizza does not sound like that
... why does the pizza biting in tantei sound like an apple
Cabin crew are people too!
yeh prolly
nerd criticism of tantei: they say 600 lives are at stake, but that's only possible on a A380 (or extra-dense 747). From the outside the aircraft is plainly a 737 max
it would be hilarious if one of the characters in this used a pea-shooter
apparently
> Mrs. Molly Moore (daughter of Mrs. Mary Smith, also a knocker-up and the protagonist of a children's picture book by Andrea U'Ren called Mary Smith)[9] claims to have been the last knocker-up to have been employed as such. Both Mary Smith and Molly Moore used a long rubber tube as a peashooter, to shoot dried peas at their client's windows.
probably what ikxi's thinking of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knocker-up
but no it was a real job when clocks became reliable, factory jobs were a thing, but clocks weren't mass producible so most couldn't afford them
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
knocker-uppers were people who happened to have clocks so would get up early and go knock on people's windows (who had previously agreed to pay for it)
why are they naming the power after a very mundane victorian era job though
<:OgawaRead:688429716507721770>
~~it's not even magic though they're adopted~~
what does it smell like
i've not watched horimiya but straight romcom just sends my mind to lovely complex
I don't remember SW's panty ep but I believe it
I got a few episodes in but was very much "I'll give this *a* chance" and then got to the pantystealing episode
this is probably jinxing it but that feels like a fun OP that will be very recognisable in AMQ
so "too" would be a better shift if you're adding that pronoun
the original probably was more literally "again" but it probably also didn't have a pronoun, so it would be more "please be nice once again"
I feel like "too" would have been a better translation than "again"
... oh I missed that because taiga thought those were the shorts that I already watched
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
so hitler had a big head and would be unattractive in japan
mangadex just enabled uploads of new chapters
transformation go nyoom
without watching it there wasn't much grabbing me to try it <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
it's worldbuilding the lower classes though
honzuki has plenty of worldbuilding
kumo, slime
no game mechanics is extremely common
she's absolutely the weakest and most vulnerable even with that
she does have magic but can barely use it and isn't about to suddenly become all-powerful from it
yeah there is precisely 0 power fantasy aspect to honzuki
she's not *able* to interact with the higher levels so they're not as detailed but there's loads of detailing of how the people she does interact with live their lives
that video is more than 5 seconds
better than 99% of modern isekai
things are not a single genre
they're commonly together
virtual worlds is a side-genre to isekai
digimon is isekai
it's another world that you spend extended periods in, it's isekai
yeah subaru definitely has quicksave and hasn't figured out how to find the backups yet
game mechanics also isn't just levels, although levels and stats are far overused and overused in plenty of isekai they have no place in - it's also things like when you have "S-class monsters", so stuff like average abilities is also falling into it
and still manages to be an original idea of how she ends up where she does, even after shirobako and sakura quest
also big agree is comf
get internet
dis v good already
the genki girl sounds adorable
kitteh
aquatope time
to the catsite
oshiet
it's the same ui style for now but there's dark mode and they've got most of it actually working, so you can find things after a little poking
they have dark mode
mangadex go brrrr
taxception
it's just a tax for tax evasion
wow tax evading so hard they got caught in the future
still have the tab open
only up to ep 16 as I got busy with other things
it's not the same with out the beeps
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I might just be hopeful though
it does feel like the promo material in general is focussed on "these two" instead of "this group of friends" like others have been. They still have a group of friends but they feel a bit more secondary

<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
hiori shipping ||miyako with yuri||
oh damn u rite this is a banger
brr go brr
new op <:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
most adaptations can at least reach "to be continued"
I haven't watched the special but the main series basically didn't resolve anything, still felt like there should be more episodes. Not like "to be continued" but "this should still be continuing right now"
any book is just the cost to pay you, the illustrator, and printing. Anime is potentially hundreds of people contracted in
LN is much cheaper, not potential huge losses if it flops
mangas are not targeting the anime
anime is written to complete within the time an anime gets
mangas are a little better since they're harder to make a lot of but the popular stuff still usually ends up going forever
LNs are easy to pump out ridiculous numbers of novels for so if you're trying to adapt the whole story of course you'll get nowhere near
I mean, no, not totally fine, but it's expected. I'll rate a series that completes with satisfactory ending higher than one that doesn't
but from same guy plz no
I mean maybe a different writer could recover it and do something decent with the concepts

is it gay
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
looks like they are
a switch
kaos noises gud
though while a 20GB limit is chonky it's not quite chonky enough to do everything on
~~for me that's actually faster than home internet~~
though you can still get to like a 4 with machine translation
hmm I've found there's usually at least a strong correlation to the translation quality
trying to think if I've seen longer
huh i actually completed all but two of the things I started last season
https://discord.com/channels/336297387863703552/371105434771390465/863160221090054145 already did but if you want to more ...
is kageki shoujo an adaptation?
so far the characters haven't caught me, I've still not actually watched it but I was more interested in the revue characters
I'm eeeeh on kageki shoujo so far
~~I was joking about if it's technically gay if there's no hetero to contrast~~
though is it yuri if there's no guys younger than 18
also, nice%
I should watch strawberry panic. And finish simoun, it was weird
plz be gay
v pretty
aquatope is v good first ep
I dropped mug and dragon househunting
or rather that's all that's left on currently-watching
neat
barring stuff that's continuing
plus there were a few anime original things to hadd to that anyway
I think there can be a range of "adding their own twists" - I'd call 86 a fantastic adaptation, and that was extremely close. But the director and artists changed the focus and flow of scenes to take advantage of the medium, so while they were almost all the same scenes in similar order it felt very original
oh I saw this PV and didn't realise it was gonna be athing, thought it was just a short meant for advertising slots
I'll give it another ep or two and maybe drop it since I'm not feeling it
fair enough on knowing it'll be straight then
at least 3
when I said "some of the bad ones" I was thinking like, ghost stories
probably some of the bad ones
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Mieruko-chan!
even in that situation why watch the supposedly worse one after so you can only be disappointed ...
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
sauce?
and even if it was true it's not an argument to watch it late. just to not watch it
it's also still predicated on "hibike is worse so watch it in the order that actively makes it worse instead of building up"
now see that's more productive since you don't need a save state to persist across the loop
but none of your progress gets saved
I assume they deserved it
kyon kun denwaaaa
on the subject of release vs other orders: watch order of haruhi?
"skip hibike" would be one thing but "hibike after" is another entirely
it also still doesn't explain why hibike after
op does show a potential ensemble cast, but also ||handholding||
this OP is immediately great
was playing games too long so only just seeing new ep now
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
it was dead in the late 00's here
imagine thinking 2015 is it dying early
both being introduced at work and at the ramen shop
he felt suuuuuper gay
go angy fuuka!
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
you analyzed it
by working out what the themes were and what message you think it was trying to say
... but that *is* analyzing it
some people find that entertaining
depends on the person
just "we're gonna take all this cool development we've done and shit in some really fucken weird dischordant themes that completely defeat anything we were doing"
and not a fun kind of don't understand like gekidol
there is a new kyoani thing coming soonish that's listed the same way as a studio commercial, which got linked the other day
because you watched a more recent one recently?
why is that middle square on its own so funny to me
<:MikuGigaBanHammer_8:754804130593112206>

I'm sure PA works could make it happen but I'm expecting us to go beyond with some wild stuff
that's a long time for one summer
ye
I'm ready for a good ride but this could be very happy or very sad or both
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
one thing I'm scared of is between the length, them only having the one summer and the subtitle, I wonder if ||the aquarium might actually close down and they have to support each other with both of them having failed||

which gives hope that they might be willing to ship fuuka and kukuru too
there's also blondie who from ep 2 I'm so confident he's gay
fuuka's the more passive one here
definitely a different personality though
i did not realise that lol
I've definitely come across lots of the sciency ones like allotope and isotope but those are a different origin and I'll grant rarer. Biotope I've definitely seen in a zoo or something
it's maybe not top 1000 words but it is a thing
https://lotsofwords.com/*tope
waterplace
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-tope#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cplace%E2%80%9D).-,Suffix,place%2C%20area%20or%20region
an aquatrope isn't a thing tho
~~why do people keep calling it trope though it's tope~~
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
at least in anime
though I also wasn't aware there was a female main gundam pilot anywhere
the gundam fandom wiki claims she's supposed to be a good pilot but I know what the quality of the symphogear fandom wiki's like so ...
they just change things arbitrarily to suit the plot
wing's supposed to be at least equal if not better than the others yet shenlong takes sustained bombardment without flinching while wing crumples in ep 1
yeah him getting taken out is just because they can't decide how strong the gundams should be in wing
is this according to the manufacturer or in general
but his personality easily one of the worst
he's probably one of the most skilled that doesn't have outright magical powers actually
same guy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHP4YomVaJo
god the japanese dub is bad enough and the en is just so much worse
there's definitely a strong argument to be made
I mean ...
and now "no wait that's actually a better dynamic so long as there's reason for the protagonist to be protagonist"
I will try watch some tomorrow but have dnd
any piloting experience at all is better than a lot of shows will do
though delta's guy had only driven loader mechs before
actually I suppose macross doesn't lean too much into that
yeah I mean for the others
ah yes the "natural pilot" trope that's in every mecha
just inconsistency about how good, and how strong the gundams are
there's nothing that directly contradicts him being good that I can think of
if nothing else we can take other characters' explicit statements that he's good
yeah but heero skill-wise isn't bad
funi is the worse one
a comparison from Vivy that someone on YTT shared between funi's and another source
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/831022266413350932/843172458672291860/unknown.png
I mean quality has gone up so they are being broadcast in more quality
is this truly more quality or just encoding more tape degradation
2.7-3 GB and blu-ray, though idk how much they can really be extracting there
zetarebel's upload has the most without being a compilation with several others
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
> 17 GB for most seeds
high praise there
I recall ecole du ciel
it can be multiple things at once
I'm trying to decide if 0080 having the kid get taken with zeon is meant to be commentary on the fans who don't get they're the bad guys


it's an OVA
after 2 eps of 0080: I'm somewhat surprised the kid isn't dead with how he keeps poking around military secrets
the special that everyone hated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRBA21hkScM
tbf with how crazy the japanese fans can get I wouldn't be entirely surprised if there was at least one person pissed at her for moving to LA and "abandoning" the japanese fans or such
there's no "controversy" section on wiki or anything mentioned that might be so idk what it would be about
I'll just do what I feel like. sometimes it's a less busy day so don't get any, other times I find something new to watch that I can do while gunpla and get through like half a season or more
also: pique
it did mine from the first ep but I wasn't listening to the people who checked who was on staff
🥚<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
opened well but then kinda just became the same as the original
eeh not bad
anime clearly improved things then
||Choko's definitely gonna die <:MikuCry:688397678584791074> ||
and a nice subtle ||oof|| moment near the end
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
good aquarium episode
and what you can trademark is a lot more restricted
that's only trademarks not copyright
<:LaikaGun:852623096816336916>
after a certain point, which I suspect is much lower than her average, it's probably more "how many roles do you want" than "how many roles are you offered"
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
that's not "one"
how many did you order
and then welsh
~~pull a chad move and just air them anyway~~
I'm not sure the plot fits
... while it has at least one magical girl I don't know if I agree with TLR
both mecha sports
so's infinite stratos
yeah
so is girls und pantsu
GuP is mecha is legit
one thing about 86 is that the story doesn't *require* it to be mecha, it could fairly easily be reworked without it ~~and it's one reason that it's way better than 99% of mecha~~
86 is trivially obviously mecha they're using an external power to expand their agency and the power is even mecha themed
~~and humans are just a mecha for a salty lump of neurons~~
<:OgawaRead:688429716507721770>
thinking about it, it might fall closer to magical girl than mecha, even
as for vivy ... I don't know if I'd call it mecha, as it does involve a lot of mecha thematics and the ideas of using something to expand one's agency. It might be, but it's not because vivy's a robot, and I'm not sure
while there is a stronger association for mecha = robot in the west there are definitely examples that break it still, so if you're trying to be strict it is better to use the japanese definitions that fall on stricter lines
if it's played well that could be interesting but could also just be some very weird pro-imperialism fanaticism
clicked around on there and fell upon https://animeschedule.net/anime/gyakuten-sekai-no-denchi-shoujo with a hell of a concept
cars are only mecha if they're a force multiplier the character uses to have greater influence
the manoeuvre gear is the only point snk has in favour of being a mecha
the titans aren't mechas
I've not seen it but nadia probably too
and GuP (pantsu and panzer) and kotobuki and yamato are all mecha under it
I accept melua's summary of mecha as a genre here, as it nicely covers the themes that the mecha genre uses
mecha as an aesthetic label is very different to mecha as a genre (which it is)
those are both mecha
the stories are very different
only in stills
there definitely have been but that doesn't mean TLR's story fits the mahou shoujo storytelling conventions
ash discovers that isekai is bad
is k-on mecha with the instruments
I feel like that gets funnier with either long riders or minamikamakura jitenshabu
<:FloofSalute:854059267173384212>
if ooarai was developed similarly to the enemy schools then GuP would have a comparison but it's not, ooarai's secondary roles are all relevant characters
versus a commander with subordinates and further subordinates
the dynamics of those mecha tend to be different, though, as everyone has an equal role
That's a fair way of putting it. I thought the crew aspect would interfere but couldn't put into words why
tangent: how would lotgh fit in?
I'm saying the fact it transforms is nothing to do with why it's mecha
yes?
it transforms but that's nothing to do with mecha as a genre
yukikaze is mecha
simoun's easy mecha
... that raised questions in my mind for knights' & magic for a moment but I suppose it still counts as mecha because while they're created via magic it's not exclusive to the creator, it is a permanent tool that anyone with magic can use
but ex. it's not true in symphogear. even with carjutsu - it's ogawa's ability, not the car's
it's probably true for a lot of shows where cars are a focus
I did say assuming <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
hence mecha as a genre vs mecha as an aesthetic
and that distinction causes different plotlines and character developments (assuming the writer's competent) because it has different dynamics in how the characters handle it
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
oh and that's who kayano is
yep
I have an idea, lesse
I don't remember noticing who kayano was (probably didn't have her clearly in my mind when I watched it) and trying to recall who hikasa is ...
the fuck they're even giving them a masculine body there
prolly not gonna if they're ignoring it
ok if they had more of this in anime maybe I'd continue watchin
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
since I've basically only seen 00, seed (and recently 0080 because of mel) I recognise none of these
whut gunpla
<a:OnePunch:836931212681281546>
oooh right gouf is one of the zaku ripoffs
you're a gouf
this is why my average is high (plus I don't care to go back to some of my older stuff and actually rate it)
i agree with this
I doubt it's weirder than gekidol
oooh next ep should be fun
if it's bait I've got it hook line and sinker
just got here and wao
i was fucken annihilated by food poisoning yesterday i need to catch up
they should do all gundam trailers like this
(some spoilers for season 1 but good luck guessing which ones are real with how much of a shitpost it is)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYPODZYHW4E
you'd watch it at work if you weren't a coward
*watch it coward*
understandable
||someone suggested last week maybe the weird spirit-gremlin-thing is the spirit of her sibling, which I could see happening||
||that would be fucken weird when they look so totally different and fuuka does look like her mother. I think the lost-family thing is just going to be another thing for kukuru to process when it's her turn to have the drama||
_hides_
i thought it was denwa
broadcast
go watch ||haruhi|| you fake weeb
||there's a school festival music show and God Knows is sung||
amazingly nope, despite it being super popular
without spoilers
I'll see if you'll get it
what's your anilist ash
given that the premise is going back 10 years, a very period-appropriate mid-00's reference
but still 10/10 for that coming out of nowhere
ok bokutachi no remake, I probably should've predicted it'd be something like this
if blonde guy is anything to go by it might be multidimensionally gay
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
hmm while I would go for a lot of spoder girls idk about this one
*googles*
there's always gotta be a waifumon
they have different senses; red spider lily is along the lines of Never to meet again/Lost memory/Abandonment, white is purity/chastity, both are used in funerals and so can symbolise death
and are often used at funerals
the red spider lily is another, not the only
FTR ||white lilies are also a symbol of death, gay is not the only conclusion||

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/macross/images/8/82/CatherineGlass-2_KlanKlang-1_F-11.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20131124005036
that's not klan
royale high is probably a world in roblox, I would assume
that girl is from delta specifically though
there's some context from previous seasons to know why they're out in the galaxy but you can also just accept it as part of the setting
you can pretty much watch any macross standalone
<:catbrain:847879295996919888>
they're not in the show's canon but it's real funny looking up what horsies they're all based on
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
iirc some are even like parent/child or grandparent/grandchild
*so* many of the horsies are related
also I appreciate the irony of using an uma musume sticker, the show where *so many* official pairings (IIRC including the main couple?) are incestuous IRL
weren't you going to do that ages ago
loris have you even watched 00 season 2 yet
the duality of anime


~~only made it better~~
||I imagine that'll probably become more than just an ep or two since she's already had people recognising her||
inb4 she keeps coming back for each holiday and we get like 4
timeskip could also happen
||or it could not happen at all||
||that could go so many directions like kukuru also running away to iwate or them running off together somewhere else||
||yeah I think I said before 24 eps feels like a lot for just the summer so there's gonna have to be a resolution to that ... and it's still on my mind that they might not be able to save the aquarium. Since that's currently scheduled for like, closing at the end of summer too?||
so many anime would just make that a chaotic keep-away game
that's a very nice ep. I like that ||they actually get permission to stay without some weird crazy scheme, just by being honest||
||oh no fishie||
"I wonder what could have interested her in the aquarium" idk maybe ||the director|| <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
daaamn some nice food animation
lol gramps ||wining and dining her mom||
aah twintails fuuka
it's weird when there's loan words for words they *definitely* have
she says まだopenの前で
... I was about to ask why kukuru literally uses "open" in the first sentence of the ep but it's okinawa she's probably half-decent at english just through tourist exposure
imma watch now, was delayed by playing VRchat with people from work

<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
the fun kind of bullying!

(said bullying was I was watching ahead and kept going rip ||character who just died||)
he watched season 1 (I was bullying him while he did so) but he's not watched s2
||graham technically survived||
||... who died in the movie||
the movie at least didn't overstay its welcome and established itself as its own thing instead of just losing what was there before
season 2 drags and lacks so much of the politics and other things that made s1 great
I thought the movie was better
they can both waste their potential
that looks like it could be pretty good
it's hardly the worst gundam's done it's just, the huge shadow it's living in ...
but at least was able to watch through for the conclusion when I knew it wasn't going to live up
I don't know about that, I didn't even get halfway through when it was airing
weird and gay
gay haircut ED *is* fantastic
s1ops are better
but basically the only reason to have high resolution versions in many cases is just the extra bitrate coming with it
pre-digital movies it's probably going to make more of a difference to have original masters converted to HD, since they'll know that people would've seen it in much better quality than the TVs of the time
lots of people in 2007, and even today you're unlikely to notice an upscaled 720 vs native 1080
fair enough, it has been a while
is that yes they have or they're still targeting 720
and I'm not actually sure if they've gone beyond that yet?
pre-digital animation they were very much working to an assumption of low quality SD TVs, and even in the digital era they didn't start animating in 720p until like 2007
while it's likely a somewhat cleaner image HD on older shows *really* isn't going to add much, SD to HD conversions are probably pretty similar to "native" HD
in the same season to have ex-arm how did wonder egg become the one to go "at least it's not X"
~~why have any guys tho when you could just have all cute girls ||handholding||~~
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
but yeah it is limited in detail
it can result in cleaner lines at least, and at the same time you can have an art director remaster the colour palette
but certainly that's rarely done
480 native doesn't have to look terrible if it's upscaled nicely
though by now they could certainly try do a better upsample than youtube
that's probably the native resolution, 00 was the first to be animated in 720
mp4 is somewhat limited in what it can contain while mkv supports basically every format
they're mkv because it's the more universal container, though bad players will go " <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> Idk what to do with this, what did you expect my developers to be competent"
||so I guess it is sister||
||oh wait no the other two are her parents, I had just blanked them as old guy's brother and someone else||
||I was thinking either a vision of her in the future or her mother. Given where the plot seems to be going with it, probably the latter||
ngl I was kinda hoping it'd be surprise advertising for a real ice cream shop
the qr code goes to aquatope-anime.com <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
||they're absent to an extent that implies totally gone; the grandparents have the vibe of having totally supplanted them||
||rather than miscarriage I'm thinking car accident or such||
||wasn't there something that implied brother||
okinawa aquarium lesbians day <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
though it does use a lot of crazy exaggerated motions that probably help hide the 90s-ness
~~even in animation I feel it's at least a little better~~
in retrospect I feel like Outlaw Star manages to hold up better than Wing, even though if you go by which one was actually supposed to be good vs which one was just trying to fill air time it should really be the other way around
I do the same thing, I'd never be remembering to update if I didn't have it
like how you *know* when a movie is being made for the oscars
I don't know if I'd trust RT to have good anime taste ... or at least anything other than "this is very western-award-styled"
also I note macross wasn't in the excluded list
insert the meme post about how the villain of cross ange is purely poking fun at the average anime fan and their obsession with waifus
it has ayahi
back when the number of !!s was the season instead of just to look cool
symphogear has actual mecha theming
because it's *at most* sci-fi, there's no mecha theming
but AKB0048 especially, if you recommend that to someone looking for mecha, they're just gonna punch you after watching the whole thing, and they'll be right to
Transformers is a weird case but several versions of it yes
https://anilist.co/anime/126393/Doushenji/ huh, a not-yet-released chinese ONA that's mecha with female protagonists, it looks like
mecha *does* require some kind of external power for it to actually be a theme - the character's agency comes from within, all mecha aspects are *purely* set-dressing, there's no mecha themes to be found anywhere
scanning through, taking out stuff that's not mecha and only counting each series once there's probably like 35-50 actual mecha stuff with female protagonist
lmfao
they don't use any external power, it's not mecha!
simoun yes and that's an obscure one
akb0048 is definitely not mecha
<:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
also AKB0048
anilist finds over a hundred but considering it's including stuff like FLCL I'm not sure it's accurate on the "mecha" part
~~why would boobs make me think it's not great~~
which tbh is probably a good thing, it's always better with variety
just not as wildly overproduced as the 80's
I wouldn't say the only hope, mecha's hardly dead
I will definitely recommend 86 for a modern, somewhat unconventional mecha/character drama seasonal
gigguk is still a fool for not giving symphogear a try but w/e, that ship sailed long ago after how much he got spammed about it
marginally more than RT but I still mostly go by poking people here or exploring their lists <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
but not really in season 2
IIRC there's some character interactions that refer back to it
I don't think it has any relevance until debatably the movie?
welp I'm ready for october to come
https://streamable.com/zqiw0n
it presumably didn't get taken down because of the licensing hell before and apparently they've not gotten around to it
yeah there's some random who's basically uploaded everything
I can think of two ways that can go
more expensive also
plus, licensing different versions instead of just one version for multiple uses
it's relatively one of the more iconic songs of the time in general and there's very clear knowledge that it's very key to this show, so there's a lot of feeling that you can pressure money out of it
tbh that's what's the standard cost-per-use of a song but I wouldn't be surprised if this was even more
*now kith*
okay after that episode I'm ||a lot more certain that gama gama will end up closing for real <:MikuSad:336657015961026560> ||
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>

~~considering that I've still not finished delta even though I've fully rewatched F it's gonna have to impress me when I restart to match that 8.5~~
there's way worse protagonists in way worse shows
it was basically just fun to rewatch and I came away at the end thinking "I enjoyed that" even if alto's a bit of a twat
not super high but it was decent
put it up to 8.5
I'd put it at 7.5 because I went through rating things recently-ish and was going purely on memory
||pretty sure mugi ships them too||
good stuff, revised my anilist score upwards
I rewatched macross frontier over yesterday and today
||gotta snug the gf||
and new girl at the end is gonna have some spicy drama
it was great
||evil crab!|| <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
i was busy yesterday so didn't get to catch up on aquarium lesbians~
milliarc doesn't matter any more at that point
milliarc doesn't because it gets skimmed over way too much because they're rushing to get the ending
I mean if it's a worthwhile redemption arc it can work
If it matters to the characters that civilians are ending up in the way then the civilian deaths matter
I think the gorefests struggle to make it feel like the civilian deaths matter to the protagonists trying to protect them. (Or sometimes just explicitly states they don't matter and it's just an edgefest)
but in this case he did achieve his thing with his death, it's just not the normal "thing" to do
like in another anime sure he could've been the protag
I think TTGL doesn't land as hard because when you dig a little his big thing *is* bringing his brother up to do it
perhaps but it was done so it kinda didn't phase me, I was just "sure I guess"
most macross manages to keep it in a balance that *doesn't* totally suspend disbelief though
itasha mecha was done way before with macross that ain't nothing
a few, yeah. Average of the whole cast was lower than your typical anime though
~~also I know they were the actual AKB48 but I really didn't think they were very good at voice acting~~
apparently I can still manage to because that took me way out of it
and then "oh but wait it's just pretend the mechs that murdered all your friends are ours! don't ask questions about why everyone was 100% acting dead but isn't when they weren't briefed beforehand
yep
but 86 actually made me believe its world is that dark
86 is competing for my favourite anime of the year
I like grimdark but it really failed to sell the grimdark part to me and the idol part was so-so
there's worse sci-fi singing shows but after the ||"let's traumatise all the kids but hey it's fine because it's not real!"|| episode I couldn't take it seriously. Still finished it but gave it an "ok" score - but that's me
I couldn't take it seriously after episode 3? I think it was
I didn't even know it had a manga, no idea if it might be accurate to it or not <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
also seems like there *may* be something bigger going on behind him actually getting sent back in the first place? At least it's being brought up directly in-plot again rather than just left as "eh it happened"
at least this protag actually has justified competence for them to find attractive
oddly reminds me of the late 00's when it's actually set with the setup of the cast being two guys and 2+1 girls and all the girls are interested in the protag
it's no shirobako but it's honestly not bad. setup's kinda predictable, sent back into past to retry his life, ends up rooming with the artists he was a big fan of and ofc the two girls both end up crushing on him, but they do remember to make the fact he's from the future problematic because he fucks up by knowing too much/being too mature a number of times. Especially the most recent ep
y
the show that literally has "remake" in its title
wow remake's actually starting to play with the implications of timetravel
I recalled there being a work featuring the tiny MSes that the sumeragi carries but apparently that was just a technical artbook type thing
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
maybe the second movie will cover it when it maybe-releases in 2027
(also the reply tags)
There were a few sidestory mangas
at least within the show itself
it's weird how IBO is the one that's set all the way out on mars when they're trying to be grounded meanwhile 00 has full on space elevators and the furthest they go is the moon
00 movie *is* a direct sequel to 00s2
eh, I think there's a difference between "sequel" and "standalone contuation"
though I feel like any sequel work is a weird choice to even mention as starting point
huh, I liked 00 movie. Though I guess specifically as a *starting* point, yeah
vaguely have intentions to continue but I'm not actively aiming for it
I fell off IBO in the middle of the first season
what would be the worst choice
which one?
that's what it'll beee~
kumoko s2: now with less kumo
I read a lot of the manga but keeping track of who's who and doing what got really confusing
IFTV, worm, and bookworm. Pattern identified: not shounen
wait nevermind: IFTV
~~what WN isn't a disaster~~
||I don't know how exactly we'd get to it but I'm suddenly hoping for a comedy sequence of kukuru trying to do some idol stuff and failing really awkwardly||
||the result though idk let's see!||
||I'm feelin like she maybe saw fuuka on social media||
||there's a distinct possibility but I kinda hope they don't and just leave her aside as the one person not able to get it||
||after how she left I hope the spirit gremlin spends the rest of the series playing pranks on her||
||no wonder she can't see the secret of the aquarium||
I'm halfway through the episode now and ||wow she's really a bitch||
<a:kissmei:815036028225847296><a:kissyuzu:815036045749911592>
||~~that doesn't have to stop anything~~||
windows is not good at faking it
yeah don't use HDR with stuff that's not supposed to be HDR. at least yet
tbf they can get pretty close sometimes with "this thing's so fast it's behind you before you see it"
and now that I can compare 00s2 more directly to something else I agree with you that GN particles making quantum-psychic connections is less BS than whatever's happening in UC. 00s2's crime is just being dull instead of dumb
I've watched 4/7 episodes and there's occasionally some ideas that could be storytelling points but then it just keeps doing something that annoys me
she's an important plot point but it was pilot dude's idea to go to earth (which he was wrong about) and then to run away and banagher is kinda annoying, especially when he goes "but I need her to need me!" when he just met her *and she goes along with it*
gundam unicorn is very determined to pretend it's giving minerva agency while very clearly only letting her act in according to the male character's actions
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
https://youtu.be/OQ1yRGAnkC4
I need to carry on with sakura quest but yes there is definitely some similarity with the concept
I wouldn't say kumo was good through and through though
there's a few but not many that have been popular here, though I guess except for kumo
it's not a simple "we have a clear destination" like shounens where you can predict how they'll get there because we don't know what the endpoint of this is
but we also just don't know
what we have so far is all good and I doubt the studio behind shirobako will totally fuck it up
Aquatope is a weird one 'cause it's all great so far but there's so many potential directions it could go and it's probably going to go in multiple via subplots
probably others I'm forgetting
then yeah not a lot of options from just one year but there's one there
second season looks promising from trailers but it's not out yet so
and if you mean specifically stuff from this year that's not a lot of time to pick from, but 86 is 100% for the whole first season
I mean how long are you wanting them to manage that. There's lots of movies that manage that, as well as standalone single seasons
the actual thing ... is just so weak
*that* being broadcast across the world would cause outright uprising
a clause more like ||explicitly stating that colonies are independent, or that any colony, nation, area of land, etc has the right to declare independence without war or their trade being impacted||
like, ||"We'll involve the new kind of humanity in government"? Something that weak, after we were *literally just told Newtypes can't be identified by any kind of test*? They'd just use it to put their own puppets in place||
especially in the more grey federation they shifted to after the original series
but it's something that could be just so easily swept under the rug
the concept could work if it was actually something that undid the foundations of the federation
(the truth of the box was also kinda boring)
it's a plot device that can do literally anything they need
storytelling-wise
the psychoframe just feels so weak
7 ... was a hugely mixed bag but would be alright if not for the weird 2001 sequence in the middle and if it was based on less bs-y gundam magic like GN particles
felt like it was the one most actually engaging with the themes of the show without bs, and marida and mineva actually got a *little* agency
I'm probably not gonna watch again to refine my opinions but I think ep 6 was best
finished with gundam unicorn. not the worst mecha I've seen but wow it managed to weave in so much dumb.
fena lookin floofy in ep 5
that's straight fun none of the usual mecha war drama
or just girls und panzer
in *all* the episodes it had
it wasn't offensively bad anywhere it just ... didn't do *anything*
not that it was strong
animation was probably one of its stronger points
but it was shit
it was shit in a very forgettable way I'll agree with
and I say that as someone who really like frame arms girls (and has them irl)
lbx girls was kinda shit
I'm not sure I've seen *anyone* actually like this design
looking up the ZZ gundam it probably says something that I do not feel it's familiar at all from kits or other displays
which is fair
wing is down in a meme tier
male characters were annoying and while it had small moments it couldn't hold its themes nor write good female characters nor land the ending
yes
looking closer I also notice UC near the top when I just watched that this week and it's like C tier at most
maybe if you took out all the political intrigue which is the stuff that made it good in the first place
nice joke
> 00 not top tier
but there *is* some side literature that states they went back to make at least a few more between the finale and epilogue of trailblazer and they're presumably working on more
this is likely the result in the far-future but tau drives aren't infinite energy (require recharging electrically) and the GN drives are still *super* hard to make even after trailblazer
and while it felt bs to add it they at least stuck with what it was doing
00 kept it more straightforward with an actual explanation
they can't even explain *what* it's doing
have it actually explain the psychoframe or such (assuming they *can* come up with a self-consistent explanation for it)
... I'm trying to think what else they could do with the box concept but ultimately all I come up with is "technology secrets" which is basically "do what 00 did"
true, I hadn't considered that angle
slimes
nothing happens?
love live
tbf you would have power storages to deal with surge rather than have to pulse the reactor for combat output
when someone builds something that completely outclasses everything in existence everyone else works to close the gap
tbf the extra-powerful-one-off can be a cool concept as long as you don't get evreyone else standing still
which is ... weird
that one maybe but I was googling the bare design
last dragon maid ep was fun and gay
<:HibikiMunch:672606446239744000>
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
almost the entire main cast of symphogear was born in like the 80s and early 90s
but any big names are like 30-40
newbies are largely in their 20s
Iiii'm not so sure about that?
so there's ||definitely not enough time to stretch the aquarium closing arc for the whole series, given they've done about 5 weeks in 10 eps||
they've not announced a split, should be straight through
||this ep has both possibly the gayest and saddest vibes yet||
we'll see about that
<@!171395487247630336> aquatope has ||one week left on the calendar. we're totally gonna have to see kukuru deal with losing the aquarium||
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>

... is shoko yukachi?
... isn't animegataris the one with the symphogear cosplay reference or am I misremembering
~~they probably will they just gotta space it out for maximum whaling~~
dats some edge in the interview quote
~~what the fuck even was a coordinator it's been too long~~
idk why but I vaguely heard that yes
but it took a long time to get there and it's not hugely groundbreaking
the latest episodes did something with the concept
yuri?
~~hell even if it's an existing one~~
I will be excite for mercury witch if they reveal it's *actually* going to have a female protagonist in line with the title but it's probably a metaphor and if it's a new AU it's a dice roll whether it'll actually be good
inb4 it's set in AC
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/371105434771390465/884194970863562762/SPOILER_unknown.png
it was announced as 26 with no suggestion of a break
the only stuff I know I'm interested for next season aside from 2 cours continuing are 86 and mieruko
this is a good season
having bad stuff does not make the good stuff bad
this one's good
this season has kobayashi, pirate princess, and aquarium lesbians
we're only halfway so who knows what the ending will be
watch it already you coward
||... now what the fuck's next ep gonna be?||
why the gay shit gotta be so sad

kukuru <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
(probably this show isn't gonna move fast enough to cover such a long plan tbh)
||what if fuuka gets rich off idol work then retires properly and they use the money to build a new aquarium together in the same place||
actually here's an idea
~~how'd she manage to tame it again after it was that messed up and wet~~
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
||maybe she finds another aquarium she wants to work at||
||Kukuru going with her back to Iwate seems like an option but it's super-open how this might end, regardless of what the next step is||

Given how this ep didn't really give any direction I *assume* next will just be tidying up and preparing for closure, and hopefully at the end of that we get some hint as to next direction
https://twitter.com/AIR_News01/status/1438908567373766656?s=20
needs to get the girl
I mean it's an adaptation and the story didn't end there ...
we've known cypher is wrong for a while now
because it definitely felt like they wanted people to take something away. it was that kind of presentation
or what the writer was intending for people to take away?
but I have no idea what the meaning of it was?
like, it did have some kind of a plot?
... not really?
monogatari makes considerably more sense than gekidol
how's it compare to gekidol?
spensive
dubbing is a lot faster than animation
tensura's way past 1 season already tho ...
the others I got cheaper later
vol 6 was a preorder
yeah I didn't ebay mine
the official XV ones are region-free (or possibly A/B multi-region but they don't say that and it would be weird to do that)
I have a japanese PS3 so I'm covered
but if it does have a region restriction it will be A
I mean you can, region A players are very much buyable and lots are region-free now
japan went the other way for blu-ray
there we go

if you buy BD then you'll run into it, sometimes
Not if you only buy DVD and only from japan
so it might be locked, who knows
all europe is on the same code with them
germany does share with JP
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD_region_code#/media/File:DVD-Regions_with_key-2.svg
but region locking isn't a format
PAL is the UK format
Idk if germany is in that DVD group
JP shares with US for BD and UK for DVD
actually not quite, thinking about it
I believe someone told me that AXZ BDs were region locked, idk about the DVDs. But yes japan shares with US
but yeah millhi's right that most people have a BD player from a console. I have PS3 and PS4 for it
XV's BDs are one of the none/all examples
it's just getting more common to use the none/all options on the disc
BDs themselves have the option to be either "none" or "all" region (Idk why they make both an option but they are and are functionally identical) but the region locking is still available and the players usually are
Weird that they still don't consider the international market to matter that much if it brings in that much money
if you buy cheap knockoff merch it won't
I mean if you import japanese merch then that all counts to sales
baa?
and as someone who didn't read the LN I did not notice any issues at all
I liked that anime

even if it doesn't explicitly say they gay I'm hopin for a "and then they lived happily ever after with 0 men in their lives" epilogue
in one of the most boring anime I've actually watched
apparently so
well that's a contrast in roles ...

what nonsense
some people on the main discord server think it confirms not yuri <:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
||I assume kukuru isn't going to know at first and fuuka's gonna make it a surprise. The way she stands up while on the phone call at the end makes me think that was just fuuka going "hey guess what. Look up :D"||

<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
||Not sure how to feel about the episode overall. Lots as expected, but I didn't expect she was going to refuse the movie offer. Which does mean she also has less preventing her from moving back to okinawa ...||
I will take this as meaning ||there's still hope|| <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
that's just letter soup
anne-sophia is a real possible name
it probably is that but ... what is that
mathematically there's always a way to balance the book such that whatever ridiculous payout you're giving, the losing side's bets pay for it
I mean, you can put those kinds of odds, as long as you've balanced the book for it ...
yep, ash is sure ash
aaaaaaaand zero I'm interested in
mieruko-chan I'll def watch but
oh right I couldn't think of them because they're not actually that interesting to me for once
which one is that
86 would have to fail hard to not be good
and first found it in march
Millhi tagged you for it back in july
I was literally about to say "ash party in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ..."
i've watched a few different first episodes and the only one I actually watched more of was prillya
more trash to laugh at?
https://twitter.com/Mipon_en/status/1442836500593487878
The official account has been tweeting a few frames from episode 13 (that are all in the PV) so it would be weird to not get another ep
and it was just getting into the really questioning parts
it was
aaah yeah it's this one I was thinking of https://mangadex.org/title/9a9bbd35-a923-494e-855f-2ffe60992dc6/magical-trans
actually maybe I'm thinking of a different one ... the one I thought the author had started instead doesn't appear to be listed
huh, there was nothing for ages, but I guess it looks like there's still publishing happening now
weird they'd be doing an anime
I thought the manga got cancelled though
link?
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
they get mwarried
the anime's also only like a quarter of the story at most
rip <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I'd still recommend magitra as it's fun and when it was cancelled the translation was decently behind, so it might've come to *a* conclusion, but I'm not sure it was the one the author originally intended
~~citrus works too~~
~~maybe the publisher didn't like it getting too real~~
mieruko and 86 and I'm happy <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
nice bait and switch PA
there's a clip from the PV that's the exact same setting but ||kukuru stands up sorta shocked while on the phone|| and I assumed that's what it was gonna be, with ||fuuka|| on the phone
also they picked their scenes just right
just got around to watchin it now and wao that's a gay ending
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
we couldn't go without her for long
https://fc.aquatope.info/assets/images/top/mainvisual_character_pc.png
I do prefer the old one, though the ED is a closer comparison
more precious than kukuru?
too much idol
||She knew only the 5 + fido set off||
||So does lena, and so she now pulls out every option she has to keep her new squad alive||
though I had to look that up
it is yep
just hitting out of nowhere with that

it was absolutely necessary and subs are out so I'm off to watch it again <:LenaSalute:827803580005482506>
too detailed? nonsense
||garter belts!||
looks like we're getting at least some anime original lena though, even if it'll probably heavily focus on the 86
yeaaaah
then suddenly "yoooo you got ideas where else to take this? this is fire"
it was written for a contest so 100%
||yeah that's the downside of not knowing you'll get signed for a whole series. Anime omitting that was a good choice||
if it keeps up with episode 1 quality
this could easily be just as good as part 1
I thought vol 2 and 3 of 86 were the weaker part but they're really pulling it out for the anime
glhf
holy shit

||She's just doing everything to keep the new squad alive so it doesn't happen again||
||and now she uses the cannons and mines freely to help the new squad||
... I was gonna say it sounds way to shounen for me but now you've got me curious
my thought was it's following the her tension. She's glancing around a lot to make sure things are what she expects / focussing on her nervous tics
86 still best opening ep but mieruko was also really good and TLN could get really good. This ep was just interesting setup
tongue
lol gangle
ok miko that's an impressive pile of salt
communist space vampires?
spoopy
nah
A Certain Italian Simp
how about all the sakura games then
~~it needs more seasons to get that~~
tbf I rated citrus about the same but it's funny to meme it as 10/10
put citrus and sakura trick as 10/10
make a statement already
ur just a coward
though that's original plot at least
gotta be almost since they're involved with sw:visions at the least
princess principal I think is original too
more seriously tho: symphogear, madoka, gundam 00, IBO if you like that, asssault lily bouquet, BNA, Shirobako, egao no daika, macross (basically any)
~~no-one point out that axz barely has an ending~~
symphogear, symphogear g, symphogear gx, symphogear axz, symphogear xv

kirika's a high schooler
yeah but I'm not engaged with any of the characters and there's nothing that seems inspired in the plot
Not super impressed by takt.op but it could just be a meh start
kenja no deshi and leadale
oh huh winter's gonna have two fluffy isekai I'mma watch
I should check I rated it low enough- yep 4's fair
i did watch it and tried to forget as much as I could
oh that
.... what
buuuut I am now looking more to mercury witch even though we know nothing of it
I'm going to give it a chance purely on that
if it wasn't sunrise I'd probably be dropping it now
this doesn't appear to be a transforming robot why does it do all sorts of weird turning as it stands up
definitely no seinen here, just shounen
god, they're making everything so cliche evil. "You're guilty until proven innocent" "you do not have the right to remain silent nor the right to an attorney"
he's got dat fancy house when he's supposedly an orphan who lost his parents long ago and is living off inheritance <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>

laika's clearly into her
~~why not both~~

executioner is close enough to assassin
give me the other assassin isekai
she gets trained by the magical girl because she's so bad at being a demon
~~citrus~~
adapt a VN by animating all the different arcs but giving a different one to each tv station/streaming service without saying anything
'cause each episode is slightly different
the JP VAs were asking if they could just reuse audio but no it's re-recorded for every single one
it almost did
fucken chad move. "we will show you *the same* episode 8 times in a row"
retrospectively, endless 8 is hilarious
yet when saya starts praising her she becomes super weird about it
I'll add it to ptw then
hence "does it just happen to use that word"
is this another gatari or does it just happen to use that word
pengin
||https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FBFPpbXUYAMn4Ki.jpg:large ||
not much more she can do
She took care of the main cause and then left it
I thought it was fairly "eh"
yes
for me only those top three actually made an impression in their first ep
for me it's
86
mieruko
communist space vampire


takt
muv luv
kyoukai
love ice
there was fancy animation and some good music, and the most generic characters and story possible
i just felt there was so little to it I'm confused how it can be highly rated
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
this one's great
ah yes that episode
wait for post-ed
ok not bad then
only one vol in 5?
is it gay yet
be gay do crimes
steal the bus and drive faster
also <@!171395487247630336> go watch aquarium lesbiabs
animegatari is the anime of references tho
they're talking about where to visit and she suggests going to ooarai because she saw it in an anime
lol wait GuP gets referenced in ms vampire in my neighbourhood?
ok sakugan's pretty good
a totally new one so thinking she's familiar is wrong
who's this VA ...
gonna try that one soon
||so domestic|| <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>

post-ED scene <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
very fluffy episode of aquarium lesbiabs
we have a kukuru version of <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
🎣
anyway aquatope in 60 seconds
they already said body-checking isn't allowed
I'm not sure having an ensemble cast lined up behind a logo is copyright
they're already in the abyss how bad can it be
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
unless it's 86 then it's shoujo with mecha
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
it's a battle royale
nothx
it's a shounen battle anime that's gonna be dragged out for 24 eps
hey ikxi for april fools we should swap names
but sakugan is good
platinum end does not sound like my thing at all
~~how can it be bad with rie takahashi leading~~
but at least doesn't have the horrible worldbuilding
idk why but purapore isn't engaging me as cgdct so that's also lower for me
lmao
kyoukai just needs to sit at the bottom for that wtf worldbuilding
I'm ranking takt a little high on the assumption it'll flesh things out in future, it's one I expect to be able to both climb and drop significantly with the next ep
lots of needing to make connections purely on once-mentioned names
heike would probably rank higher if it wasn't hard to follow while doing other things as well
but I will update my order after seeing a couple more things
86
sakugan
mieruko
communist space vampire
heike
takt
muv luv
puraore
kyoukai
heike's weird

y u tagging me for everything
like the seed and second 00 movies
who knows maybe they'll release it on the 20th anniversary
and newgame!!! while we're at it
we need comicgirls s2
so for this to be proprtionally long with the games ... I'm guessing around 200 episodes?
kaos and shamiko have the best noises
it's literally the same name ||for once||
kaizoku oujo, sea-thief royal-girl, pirate princess
fena's fun
sora yori
the second one gets 100,000 bystanders killed
I mean that last one almost kills everyone on the planet twice
the show with the CSA survivor, the child of family rape & regular abuse survivor, and traumatised survivor of a mass casualty event she was only at because of her gf who got called away at the last sceond?
I figured it'd be someone dying that makes a difference, just didn't expect it when and how it happened
tbf many of them are just bad
is that including model kit profits
the power of nerdery
the best kind
so many bad plots and characters
that doesn't mean the average mecha is actually good, when most are just relying on mecha = cool to get views <:mikoDead:787718412864323595>
gib
or [email redacted]
apart from when she tags him in virgin memes <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
86 was decent for a transition episode, clearly saving the budget for later. ED is "eh", might hit better with the right scene
ah k
as in what's the show
nani ka
i barely started
... wonder egg somethingsomething?
I'm confused by komi because it's apparently out but I'm not seeing it on nyaa?
~~the joke answer would be that jahy is isekai~~
also which of thise is isekai
is mieruko cgdct

zls is fun but not exactly high quality
the difference is it makes it basically impossible to land a boat
those are way smaller than aot's walls
the coast is a way more sensible defenseline
if you were permanently restricted to only the land inside the walls that's not a sustainable society, you need agriculture
it'd be way more peaceful just having massive coastal artillery defending it
you still have to defend the walls that's not much peace
I actually don't know off the top of my head when the last successful invasion before 1066 was
plus the invasion before that was by one of the legitimate heirs competing for the throne
no successful invasion of the UK in a millenium and we can literally see the people that we hated the most for all that time
change them into giant fish people so that they're superior at aquatic warfare
<:LenaThighs:791034545067130910>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
and by having lena, it has lena's thighs
only 86 actually takes those notes seriously and makes like half the plot development about them
both societies behind a wall with an unstoppable enemy from outside and notes about oppression
since it's getting compared to aot fairly often I'll say I'm glad 86 answers a lot of background questions early on rather than raising mysteries. There's no questions why the 86 are the 86
<:HibikiPing:688397678421344268>
<a:popcorn:873976313533329439>
I've not watched it at all I just know a lot of context because it gets talked about so much
you could save the other nations without it being an island if there's some specific reason the titans are after this one specific nation
also tried to make them way overcomplicated instead of "yeah they're just actually being attacked and the walls are a defensive measure"
so again why not do the whole island
island is perfect opportunity for
which, again
lock away some world evil or something
if he wants to be like mr nobel, create a paradise for *other* people
even without the more wide view of death vs self-preservation it's a dumb contrast
> wanting to build paradise for just him
> thinks he's responsible for world suffering
and often their development works because they move beyond the death goal
I can think of some characters with death as a goal who work but death is one of their secondary goals and their primary is generally something like "save/improve the world/another particular person"
logical, yes
so he's threatening the outside world but will accept it if the outside world comes to kill him
walls are a very active measure to defend your location
because you're then living alone on the island that you can't leave
destroy them all and arrest anyone trying to make more
if you want a place to die the island is still the better solution anyway because you just make boats illegal
walls are a defensive measure
building the walls
then why are they defending themselves
it's just a real hard place to invade
tbf japan never had a great navy until like 1900 they just got real lucky with disasters striking invaders and them being used to it
I mean it'd still be a few years off, but it's not like these LNs that have 30 volumes in the future
the episode numbering is a direct continuation, last ep was ep 13
what's currently airing is season 1 part 2
but vol 8 doesn't have to be that far into the future - probably 4 would work as a movie, 5-6 as season 2, 7 as OVAs, and 8 I'm not 100% clear on
I know the major note about ||Theo|| at vol 8 but I'm only just into vol 5, still need to continue
ptw isn't a promise that I will it's a list of stuff that was interesting enough to note, so that if I'm looking for something in future I can just look there and find something
i do not have enough time with a humane 8 hour schedule idk what's with you
take a holiday for it
monogatari is somewhere in my ptw with the vague intention of coming back when either I'm in just the right headspace or I can understand enough JP to support it
and it's fucken utena there's no way I understood it
no 'cause I know I'll enjoy them plus the only one I know I actually finished is utena
because it was years ago
can't speak to monogatari but I've watched enough of the others to know they're great and should rewatch to make sure I actually understand what happened
why would I delete any to "make room" for something I'm not interested in - which isn't making room anyway because that's a constantly growing list
most of which I'm more interested in than jjk
it's still loads of shows I've not watched
and?
but yeah I make similar decisions for all media. Will skip books that I probably would've liked years ago if they're probably gonna focus on guys, for instance - even if I'd probably still like it now, I don't have enough time to get through everything when I *do* restrict it to stuff with cute girls and I enjoy that more
called out
<:TheoWTF:729394443697913907>
extremely similar
even assuming I had enough focus to put consistently a whole hour to it
an hour is a lot of time to dedicate to it
I'd rather just potentially miss stuff that I'm very unlikely to go more than "that's ok" to
which means not having time for other stuff I wanna do
there's way too much for that
and if your hype points anti-hype me then it's probably not for me
I have seen none of jjk but it's the kind of show where anything people say to try hype it up for me just make me want to watch it less
tbf others disagree with me but that was my impression. It's nowhere near WEP level of just fucking up the ending but it was weak and didn't link into the development as well as it could have
watch faster
still like 8/10
vivy was eh, didn't really land the ending
?
I should probably catch up on yuyuyu but it sounds like a lot of suffering
||"Have you decided on your future?" as a couple with her & Daiya's hair colours walk by||
and from today's ep, ||Lecca, Kujo (first to die), Aldrecht. Possibly someone below Kujo, Teppy, Fido, possibly Haruto below Fido?||
like holy shit
I can't believe iqiyi actually went for that episode thumbnail

well that one ||still isn't truly dead||
I remember ||Lecca|| because her anime design is so unique. Would be 100% convinced she'd survive if she had a more active role before dying
||Anju hasn't||
you forgot ||Daiya||?
86
The death is the whole set of events around it
It was already driving in how many people had died and how it'd affected everyone
I'd say ||Daiya's|| is competition but ||Fido's|| really twisted the knife with you knowing something was coming from that sequence

how you work out who's still alive
shin is interesting when he hits his development but that doesn't happen often. trauma kinda does that
but lena's the more interesting one for the most part
they're both protagonists
but also I would like to see the other 86ers get development
v2 and 3 did drag without lena
that's what the op is for <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
I do enjoy v5 and 6, but it can't be as tight since it needs to lead the story on instead of conclude
1 was very tight since it could focus well
which is ... not a common opinions
earlier today I even found a couple people who think 1 is the weakest
there's a variety of opinions on where 86 is the best
was not expecting a may'n ending for shikizakura
at least here they've managed to get the CG and 2d skin and cloth tones matching, that's always an easy giveaway
not gonna complain if this starts becoming the norm again
have CR started convincing production committees to give them that right more often
oh huh this has op subs too
yes
... whatever I might've expected of shikizakura it wasn't this cold open
though we won't get the wholesome ones too often <a:ChrisShifty:744677308631089162>
Nice post-ed on mieruko
idk what shikizakura is but it was on my ptw so I'll see shortly. other than that though I'm only looking at mieruko and space vampire
animated is pretty spoopy tho
I've read a decent way into the manga so I know a decent amount of what to expect
so there's an example that it's all about licensing
just starting the ep and first thing I notice is that these subs (which I believe are CR) have the OP lyrics
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
||Miko x friend||
curious what the post ed might be ...
||for the most part||
and the 86 obviously don't hate the 86
Our main protagonist wants to help them but is somewhat naive and has to grow, her friend ||disagrees entirely with how everyone else acts but can't bring herself to act out|||| because of guilt she feels over something she did in the past||, her sort-of-uncle ||hates what's happening but also feels powerless to stop it, so instead is just trying to protect Lena||
so that's juts what you know is typical and then the focus is on good characters
to show what the general attitude in this country is. That attitude is not the interesting characters though
novel spoilers ||hopefully we might also see them get their comeuppance in the fall of gran mur||
they're supposed to be fuckwits that you only see in episode 1 ||and 12||
but yeah you won't find those characters you hate. The only ones I can think of that act like that are the three guys at the start and they're unnamed background characters
it's one of the best works engaging with discrimination and racism in general
even outside of anime
that's the background to the situation we're in and the characters that matter are all complex individuals who aren't so reduced
I can't even think of that happening much in 86's focal points. There's like those three guys who set the setting, but the focal characters are way more complex than that
it's not just a mechanism to create "group vs the world" it actually engages with how these things happen
yes but it's not like bna. The focus isn't really even on them for part 1 and they're not universally hated
smugrina
https://anilist.co/anime/122052/Kaizoku-Oujo
no, fena
so Fena ||found the Frontier||
maybe it'll be something like they put a vampire on the moon but fail the manned race
presumably not
it wouldn't actually launch with a crew it'd get met by a soyuz, which instead of docking would have a hook that connects to a thick mesh sheet on the moon vehicle ... Aka. superscale velcro
if they're going for some accuracy moon would take N1 rocket, which is kind-of a monster and also hilariously jank
yep we're still that early
idk if the actual plot will get that far
well irina is presumably wanting to go to the moon but they've not actually put a person in space yet
glhf anyone who wants to try translate
there's also some cyrillic cursive in the OP
yep
is pretty russian
they gonna launch to spess on a soyuz
but I'll probably stick with it
there was some low quality animation so I hope that's just 2nd ep budget saving
unless you really f up the settings
they shouldn't happen with 2d art programs
I assume this was not created in blender
ok what happened to cause all this pixellation everywhere.
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>

Doesn't matter whether it's canon once they're domestic like that they're anime married
||"Two and a Half Men"||
I am prepared to rank it fully 3 points higher if it actually gets remembered and addressed sooner than an epilogue "oh yeah we better buy him a new one"
kyoukai senki appears to have zero consideration for air power or above. Also I'm betting that boat is gonna be totally forgotten in short order
whoever translated toushinki g's frame is not as good as translators for japanese are
why does the audio track for toushinki g's frame say it's japanese
> I have no idea what I just watched
> guess I'll watch again next week
aka:
> The Gekidol Experience
I think you'll probably like it
yes
like the combat movements
also it kinda feels like it's animated specifically to make it fit really well in SRW
... garanndoll is weird
so they do appear to be trying to explain it but i'm still super whelmed
but it's kinda whiplash from last ep
not necessarily any better yet, only just started
ep 2 of takt op ... feels like different characters
but no they had to pretty much hit all the controversial issues
they could've fixed this by just having "it was already crashing and foreigners slowed it down but it was never enough"
knew it
.... how come hikasa's not credited for sakura quest on anilist. THere's *no way* that's not her
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
||or fuuka gets there first||
I'm watching komi-san and facepalming at the names
||hoping from the way it was brought up that it's gonna be something kai acts on fairly soon and kukuru's just like "what. no."||
sakugan ED is good
the op's alright
I once again thought I recognised the girl's voice in sakugan but no I looked it up last week and she's totally new
kukuru really strugglin with the sales team
apart from being ded from moving ikea furniture
today is a good day
sakugan and aquatope
also wtf why's like 30% of the komi ending randomly really low resolution
we know the true ending in our hearts
a more complete list kind of only adds more questions for people who know nothing about it
シムーン
welp dis gotta be gud
it's cute girls doing acting so it's up your alley but good luck understanding it
good luck
still makes no sense
we just got gekidol in AMQ <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
or cull the planning list when I do
huh I need to not add any more anime to my list
one of them is gremlin elfnein
actually no I'm forgetting, at least 5
we have at least four ||that are still alive||
<:KaieSmug:896444424983310336>
who
gotta be one of the first to do that
also interesting to find out it's widescreen natively
the true power of yuri
literally 5 minutes in

... is it?
(I watched some of it I know what the fuck)

spoopy mieruko is spoopy
that ep made you happy?
you hate elfnein?
there's been significant re-ordering to make events chronological
part 2 is actually *considerably* more different from the books
but it's not reordering or anything, that was just a fully anime original episode (apart from ||fido||). The author is involved in every writer's meeting though, so it's fully approved and canonical
it's supposed to feel off because it's a very weird situation for them.
thankfully I can palate cleanse with garranndoll
speaking of bad mecha, don't watch ancient girl's frame from this season. god it's bad
that one part of seed destiny
is that moon mirrored though
never heard of them
bookwalker is responsible for their working visas
*they* work for bookwalker, strictly speaking
much better as many girls with many girls
transcend the harem into the polycule
~~I also feel like LotR isn't the best comparison because while it's certainly a lot deeper than HP it's also been exceeded and its biggest value is as a reference point for the genre rather than as a great work in itself~~
tbf the themes being simple might be part of why it's popular. it's easy to explain what's good about it with a 5 minute conversation so it gets passed on easily
Plenty of them show up within HP!
also some reaaaally dodgy thematics around power dynamics. magic being almost purely hereditary and those who come into it by luck being consistently "less", a very blairite view of power in general
Visual would definitely struggle with those but there's plenty it can make hit harder too
because if you allow any at all it would immediately go out of control
though granted there's *so much* introspection that the writers for the anime were specifically told "no internal monologues"
eh, feelings can be shown, but introspection is hard. I've been thinking 86 is an appropriate example here and that especially shows it - we very much understand how characters are feeling in the anime and it's very effective at it, but we don't feel as much *why*. The book doesn't hit as hard with emotional moments, but it can explore them much more deeply
I won't think of every detail in the scene but I do picture it with text. But actual VAs and actual artists can do a better job than my imagination can - so whether I prefer book or visual medium depends on both how well it's done and whether I feel like putting in the effort to read it
but can't complete all 9 afaik
I have like 6-7 in that style
it's also a nice textured cover to evoke the idea of woodprint (Though it clearly isn't)
https://booksbyproxy.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/temeraire-uk.jpg
no I have the UK set from harper voyager  but last I went they only had the delray style
I still need to finish the temeraire series but they changed publisher so now I can't complete a set with the super-nice covers I already have ...
it's been too long since I read any of those
Good voice acting is better for dialogue than just text, though that is a self-stated caveat. Text can be better for abstract things, thoughts and feelings etc
the online translation is rooough so we'll see how this is
for that there's IFTV
welp not opening that at work

~~what do you think animation is~~
moob loob
It is but I'm also curious what part you're thinking of specifically
a calm but fairly heavy episode of 86
no mention of the company explicitly to maybe just someone involved likes the place
oh right this rip has english translations at the end
only thing I noticed on a once-through of the ED credits
is shikizakura sponsored by toyota or is it just a coincidence it's set there
may as well take them from somewhere. hibiki's whole class had designs from the first season
people who read manga were like ||wait wut why's he here already||
he was in previous episodes
ooh is it ||the dad||?
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
what depression ||https://fxtwitter.com/mikichxn/status/1451962120203948033 ||
watch 86 if you like foreshadowing
it's very obviously 3d
I did that with shirobako because the opening feels so much like a finale of a high school show
I thought I remembered hearing that but can't find it now so fair enough
86's CG is outsourced to the beastars studio isn't it?
https://youtu.be/HKbBjxj7C2c?t=1661
:o
I found some actual gameplay
I can't find any in japanese playthroughs either so yeah it might just be a VN ... and I question the art being nice ...
unfortunately he's the only one with english titling
given that I can't find any gameplay in this guy's playthrough I assume he edited it out, if it's supposed to be nep style
not mary skelter
skelter heaven
actually since this guy's playthrough is only 5 parts of between 30 mins and 2 hrs each it might be they edited out the gameplay?
the first half an hour appears to be cutscene/vn segments
I found a playthrough and I'm clicking through looking for some kind of gameplay. is it a vn
wait it does
neptunia is way newer iirc
I don't think it's based on anything
iirc it's also idea factory? who are still around and make neptunia
I've wondered the same thing
that's cruel to fans
||we saw them at least in ep 1 and ep 3, I don't recall seeing them in ep 2 but some people mentioned we might have||
macross is barely mecha tbf with how much it focusses on the idols, at least in the newer ones <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
https://tenor.com/view/poggers-gay-sakura-trick-yui-sakura-gif-21586070
also one of the main girls is voiced by miku's VA
gals bein pals
they literally kiss in the op
sure why not
I thought she was older than 14 too tbf
spess idol
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
clearly the translator is a bookworm
it's a good thing garranndoll is fun with how boring kyoukai senki is turning out
interesting that 86 didn't get any warning for ||Eugene|| though
that wasn't a CR warning (at least that I saw) that was baked into the ep because it had to go with broadcast too
apparently it continues being good
same
https://twitter.com/inori_narou/status/1364811776286621705
_is reminded of the "blunt instrument" comment from IFTV's author on volume 2_
<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
they both suck
I stand by my statement
~~zaku~~
or such
they're apparently real estate brokers in an RPG
cute girls doing capitalism?
he ... forgot the entire gimmick he was writing?
unless this is a different version didn't the anime get that far?
https://myanimelist.net/anime/42072/Kenja_no_Deshi_wo_Nanoru_Kenja
not particularly interested in the golfs but kenja deshi and executioner's way of life seem neat
probably they were just looking around for any sport that hasn't been done (and maybe noticed how many golf vidya games there are)
no miso I'm pretty sure they're just trying to confuse us
dating busty but not busty
it's definitely not more than half being busty
you're just remembering the ara ara's, she's got plenty that aren't

also character who's specifically in contrast to a busty ara ara sister
ah yes

you say hikasa's the same voice but maybe you just only watch stuff where she's the same character, she definitely does have range
yui and altair is certainly a contrast
if they get through a stupid amount of content by just cutting it the result can still be super slow
and didn't even finish it they skipped an epilogue for spoilers
then there's 86 with 11 episodes for 1 volume
I remember hearing worm mentioned a bunch *years* ago then I heard nothing about it until melua started mentioning it
I read the title and was assuming it was from the perspective of the front character. Obviously, a bad assumption
... so is this the manga/ln cover for the yuri NTR that got animated or is this a new one
yeet the elfnein
including her trying to subtly help them with their spy missions at times but them figuring it's all coincidence because she's obsessed with spy movies and probably just acting those out
and then comedy ensues
two spies (who don't know each other are spies) form a family as a cover and adopt a little girl, who can mind-read so realises they're spies and is like :o "so cool!"
I am somewhat excited for this but it's sad that "cloverworks" is getting to be cause for concern lately
86 ep 16 chose the *perfect* spot to cut the episode
so it's idoly pride again
ditf just had some fucked themes that some people started noticing real early and the rest didn't notice until nearly the end
I seem to be the only person not watchin kaguya so I am absolutely fine
so not only he's a bad writer story-wise but also production-wise
was this the fault of that weirdo director?
so another one to be worried about, noted
The one I'm thinking of with that is again WEP but I'm sure it's far from the first
or end up hospitalised
whether or not it should be called falling apart depends whether they're having to pull all-weekers trying to get episodes finished
like they can do good art and animation when they have the time ... but will this be successful or a shitshow
and iirc a few other of their projects have fallen apart with failing to keep up with time demands
cloverworks did WEP
presumably this is gonna be shorts since it's within a variety show, but I'm remembering so many jokes about crossovers that should have her talking to herself all over ...
also like ... most stuff is shounen?
and be willing to fuck with the cour structure just a little to get the pacing right
or adapt stuff that was well-written with manageable arcs like 86
~~probably not tho~~
maybe it'll be lucky and it's like the second one they made in shirobako where they actually talked to the author about how to make an ending that would be manga-compatible
I didn't have a conclusion from the very start but it was still in the single digits when I was seeing its story fall apart
tbf "the ending sucks" is hardly a rare feature in anime, even if you do avoid the low-budget adaptations ...
ps2 had the best library simply by being biggest but was definitely not the best console
just the average viewer isn't paying enough attention to see them til they come to a head
It's more like until the last third for the majority but *plenty* of people were seeing the issues way earlier
hard thing to find though because how do you stand out without doing something
sakura trick might do
I've only watched a couple eps of HGS but I would say the voice acting is so-so. But that's more an issue I find with english voice acting in general, there's absolutely nothing atrocious about it and it's perfectly fine by EN standards.

vaguely planning to watch more but haven't been getting around to most anime lately
fun ep of mieruko
or is it a manga?
2 volumes to 3 episodes? how short are these volumes?
do you watch *anything* in english?
I mean I gave that to lone as some trash to watch when he asked the other day
... did they say "ok we need to swap the barely-acceptable cg with 2d" only no-one checked the 2d?
srw naming be just rolling dice and working out which letter that is
tf?
motion blur in animation?
didn't know about that but I switched before nfts blew up
i program for money instead
no that's effort
only sad thing is I can't have it on linux
I do, it uses the least background resources of basically anything <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
or rather it refreshes the latest uploads occasionally and examines the list for them
and it'll auto-search for stuff that should be out
can search it directly there
yeah taiga also integrates nyaa si
apparently anilist theme is not saved by account otherwise that wouldn't be blinding on work pc

Using taiga's auto-updating I think you can use both
"is it original gundam? the ovas? idk!"
it had absolutely no clue what I was watching
it thought that was the episode number and the series subtitle was the episode name
also taiga completely shat itself with watching 0080
it's a little buried but 5 minutes is a long time to dig through settings
that's 5 minutes including finding the options, even
while it's entirely fair to stick with what you know, you can export the MAL list as a file and import it to anilist in like 5 minutes, no need to recreate the list
going for the critical hit
why did I read that as "I will crush your pants"
even for SD icons
you wouldn't have to change the mechs *at all*
Garanndoll feels like it's made for SRW
then the season that actually launches alongside it doesn't play it safe?
<:ao_sus:819391312745857054>
is it gay
I've still not watched s2
so s2 probably isn't gonna get there
at least when it was airing I thought I heard that it was still keeping it under wraps
if it would actually get somewhere then I'd probably look again but if it's more of the same then one season was enough
given how apparently tonikawa still hasn't gotten around to big reveals in the manga I probably won't bother with s2
good ep
was busy yesterday so didn't get to watch lesbian aquarium
"this other girl also sounds familiar- oh"
it's now just instant that I visualise her with *anyone* else
I know she voices a lot of other stuff but this is the first character the voice has 100% attached to for me and now I can't imagine anyone else
<a:anjuclappin:854034494386470922>
start first ep of selection project, can only hear anju
cultured dad
buy it coward
did u not see the pre-op and post-ed?
they actually made all 500+ nametags
https://twitter.com/Hiroyuk98571188/status/1457010378827722764?s=20
presumably because of this
https://www.meti.go.jp/english/press/2020/1211_002.html
perhaps but now it's 14 weeks for what should've been a 12 week show, unless dec 11 was planned from the start
it's kinda understandable that next ep would be one to trip up on but
hopefully they can still get all the episodes out without having to cut up these storyboards
next ep delayed
fuck
ok 10/10 ep guaranteed just for one scene
great cold open from 86
definitely gonna be costing more to do the main characters in both styles
shikizakura is very ok but at least they avoid mixing 2D and 3D. They only use the 3D versions of the main characters for fully 3D scenes and are mostly switching to 2D for the more SoL scenes where they interact with characters that don't have 3D versions
that's a change in style
I expected at least one to try
not a single one of these VAs can pronounce "yell"
of course you know that
iirc it's too close to idoly pride to have had time to just directly copy so i presume something triggered these ideas
along with the plot being a clone
I am certain several of these vas were also in idoly pride
also this japanglish girl
the fuck is that emotional whiplash going from "oh yeah this girl totally died"
you can introduce them when they matter and these scenes have made me start paying less attention because *I do not care* about these tiny clips
when they actually matter
develop initial characters first and give others backstory later
i do not care about any characters from these tiny snapshots
ok this is a terrible way to start the show
the real mystery is why are umineko called umineko
higurashi
nah they haven't bothered breeding most of us to be good
they're leaning into ||Lena is Dead||
I don't think we're gonna get any more for a good while
i think we kinda know
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688749344727498775/906585960458911824/Screenshot_20211106_174840.jpg
someone edit it to be only the beeps
she's just "what the shit just happened?"

||them fighting the bad thing was also quite nicely animated, felt more brutal than most of it is||
||Hana's haunted by something super-bad so she takes them to a shrine, she gives a way bigger donation and prays hard, and the *other* spirits appear for the first time||
that's a good ep
we're *here* now
just watched newest mieruko
which spy girls
idk the plotpoint where this becomes relevant 'cause I've not started it
I've been told by someone who's into it that apparently it is important that the MC is reborn, but not that he's from another world. Which is an entirely separate trope that could be done without isekai
all the scam of nft with a fraction of the cost
so they don't spend huge amounts on getting them in the first place, presumably
they're making you play the gacha before the nfts?
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
only 26 years late?
SP and IP ... are less clear
shared inspirations
there's very often an identifiable cause for a lot of aspects
like if it's something being talked about in the news the past couple years
I'm wondering if there's something specific going on that caused both to be produced about now
but she can just go back to that castle and love herself *and* be gay
make it gay
caught up on mieruko and communist space vampire. both excitin episodes
<:edel_sleep:737491005800185908>
ADs go brrrr
https://twitter.com/exaenae/status/1461650888045608963
standard question: is it gay
so it seems
<:HarutoPray:835601218637135883>
I thought that only got announced recently because of schedule fuckery
was dec 11 known about?
maybe they can squeeze out a couple from next season but I would be surprised if they could get all, and it'll really suck waiting that long for the epilogues
they're gonna be like 3 eps behind by now
will it have to be specials like WEP? (but hopefully with actual quality since they're already written and being made)
yeah when are they going to air the last eps
the ||Nachzehrer|| looks cool though
<:FredPout:896522962314883072>
hopefully with this next one *and* the 11th already blocked out they might be able to catch up?
it's finally catching up to them as we hit the combat episodes
86 delayed again
Is it apparently getting rough to keep up?
even aside from it phasing through his face I think he needs to go to the hospital with that hand
an odd episode to outsource unless they're going to hold off on the ||Nachzehrer drop||
for 86
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688749344727498775/911225001930289173/unknown.png
especially with morpho next episode
episode of 86 with the production falling apart: as good as the best episodes of 95% of anime
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>

<@!171395487247630336> correction it's very gay her cousin and school friend are now very much fighting over her
it's already real good though
should just buy it to find out
though yeah Idk how much of vol 1 this covers
they're chonky chapters
https://nellietranslation.wordpress.com/2021/02/23/the-story-of-unforgettable-witch-prologue/ the first chapters if you missed them way back
probably

||they could fix it all if the first wedding in the new area is kukuru x fuuka||
only just got around to watching aquatope now and man, this is really turning into just the kukuru suffering show
not much of lily's speed though
86 is great apart from the delays
no it's the twink
*robots go brrr*
instantly cured
it was very funny how depresso he was *until he saw the mech*
the mechatwink
I barely know anything other than it's def gay and the premise
it's rare to get an animated trailer far off
next year and it has a trailer so probably first half I'd assume
it's not the gay assassin isekai so <:ShirabeSleep:691497302535176302>
d'aww the post-ed
just watched newest mieruko-chan. We finally get to this guy!
(both in the show and the character takt himself)
which takt also lacks
vs symphogear hasn't introduced the big babel plots by then but the characters are all motivated with their own goals and histories already
at least with stuff like bayformers there's some nominal plot to aim for but takt op doesn't have any sign of one in the first couple eps
not even unfocussed just ... there didn't seem to be *any* plot motivation and the characters are unmotivated af
in the "this is very fancy animation but I have no clue what it's supposed to be about" way
ep 2 simultaneously did both less and more in that it deconstructed ep 1 even worse but actually made a character (that is terrible outside of ep 2) somewhat more interesting
first ep did very little actually compelling story-wise
takt op looked ... interesting, in the PVs
symphogear has its issues but is genuinely good
I was fully prepared for her to not survive the episode but I suppose it wouldn't be so well regarded if it took such easy shots <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
ep4 of DNT: so this jessica just death flagged hard and I now fully expect her to be the demonstration of the civilian casualties of war
so the joke is that you're 100% in their wheelhouse
lily sunrise also make gundam
mecha + idols
lily has been infected with the sunrise bug
also big plus for the remake: top-tier sawano OP/ED
because it might just be like 86 where it's all super-subtle and left for you to notice the details
If I get super into it I'll either go back and watch the original, or try reading the actual novels, and see how much there is I missed
pretty much every review says the remake is way better paced
there's narration pre-OP giving some world background (which was my first hint that the audio was 3.1 because I couldn't hear anything in stereo) but throughout the ep, none
I skim-read a couple reviews comparing it and the biggest complaint seems to be that side-characters go undeveloped with the lack of narrator, but this equally sounds like "they just kept it subtle and more interesting"
nop and wasn't planning to, unless I get *really* into it enough to consider such a time commitment
the art and animation is also beautiful and hints of political intrigue to come are interesting
I've not seen the original so I'm not gonna try compare, but *holy crap this mechanical design is gorgeous*
on a very different note I started watching the first few episodes of LoGH:DNT
his hype is infectious
you've not seen the drill that will pierce the heavens?
the fights are hype but they build on the depresso and pain of the rest lending them significance. K&M is definitely just more straight "fun"
it's very depresso and about people trying to survive a shit world
lily I say 86 isn't your speed because straight-up, more than 3/4 of the introduced & named cast in the first half does not survive that half
I think the next ep is about as far as I read just 'cause I was doing too much and forgot about it so I'll be interested to see what they end it on
it's used early to make it feel extra-creepy that these things are watching but once it's set in they can kinda stand on their own
I think both anime and manga kinda tone it down later
there's the same pantsu shots and changing scenes as in the anime, fenny
GX and AXZ yeah those have the same level as like, first few eps of S1
XV is good even if paced way too fast
the latest eps have toned it down
Idk the first couple eps went heavy
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
also yeah mieruko is genuinely good it keeps you on your toes switching between "huh maybe there's some good stuff to seeing these ghosts" and "nopenopenopenope"
I need to catch up with the newest part, not having train free time means I've fallen behind
not only does S1 massively outdo takt in general *S1E1* has more characterisation, motivation, and plot intrigue than the first several of takt
a well animated piano does not make up for terrible characters
y'know those outfits in the ed are awfully close to ||very simplistic wedding dresses||
kukuru ||doesn't even say anything when fuuka shows up 'cause she knows her wife would be there||
that's just funny
spam onigiri sandwich
yeah but like
also the spam is really funny to me
das a monster of an onigiri sandwich
pretty much
it occurs to me that it's been ages since we saw the gremlin
boo
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
bullying ash into watching stuff at work finally succeeded I see
oh hi lockon that's a very recognisable voice
I imagine that's intentional
DNT ep 5, so far the free planets alliance seems more fanatical & brainwashed by its leadership than the empire does
they're no key eyes
definitely the SEA islands, I remember that much
it may be a korean app (idk I'm just going with that) but the author is indo, I'm 95% sure. the other 5% is philippine
is indonesian manhwa? I thought that was chinese
certified twink
~~it'd be better if ernie was a girl~~
yeah she is at least a fun character but entirely 1D
that's the best explanation
but yeah there's definitely a lot of engineering he's pulling *slightly* out of nowhere
they only mention it offhandedly a few times but supposedly the reason he's so good is because magic strongly resembles programming
he's a neeeeeeeerd
pretty sure she did in that one episode
they're both self absorbed, just in different ways
DNT ep 11: this Commodore Falk is a fool and his VA is channelling innovade *hard*
the only uniform with a matching skirt I can find is in a k-drama called the heirs, so if you can find it in an anime you've probably got it, but I sure as shit can't
yellow skirt is quite unique but it's unfortunately unique in that I can't find *any* matches
the uniforms don't match for that
which was that
except all the people who are dead
from-our-world isekai means it's just an excuse to exposit, reborn is an abused trope but is actually attempting to be more interesting than isekai since it's a "let's have a do-over" instead
yes because if they don't come from another world they're not just a self-insert-"I have the same knowledge as your average otaku"-character
eh, there's a few things I'll at least look at next season, and it'll mean time to try cut down on my watching list
though while I say 何これ from the look I'm pretty sure this is the "king is reborn as a girl and decides to become a knight instead" story?
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
何これ
now it's all there
it was missing a few things for like a week or two maybe
I have a few on dynasty scans but accounts on both
pretty much same
learn moonrunes and read the raw
it'll take like 5 minutes to know if you'll be interested in updates once there's more
ye the concept's good, art's nice and it's starting out pretty clear about what approach it's gonna take
comedy gold
on a different note I saw this as one of the latest on mangadex and it seems like it could get good once there's more https://mangadex.org/title/361a8f75-4d1e-431e-8749-6e8155f66d4c/shimekiri-mae-niwa-yuri-ga-hakadoru
the CD sales help make the anime worth making
is that better than hanebado was
<:TPsleep:914132483451281438>
too much golf
dates check out
well it's sure as shit not walking there
you comment on the flamingo but not the hoverhedgehog?
<:TPsleep:914132483451281438>
is it gay
or windmill gundam
amazing
does it come up from underground instead?
especially in first episodes
gundams seem to fall to earth a lot
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
||Morpho time||
preview for next ep of 86
||https://twitter.com/anime_eightysix/status/1466723902818852866 ||
that's the kinda can-do attitude we need
ok so ||they're even barefoot in the ED and a specific point was made about the weddings being barefoot if these two don't at least act as the trial wedding now it'll be an insult||
with what fuuka's learning now
I'm just watching it now because I was at board games night and yeah this feels like plot threads that should've been coming up like ... three episodes ago

if they actually do make the ED real I'm giving it instant 10/10 but otherwise I'm thinking maybe an 8
*do it cowards*
only 24?
Can still be problematic, but certainly much easier to get away with than ethnic
86 ep 19 was pretty good despite the delay
||kithing would be pretty pog tho||
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
do they kith
not this season, next iirc
ash fenny probably means the other executioner
pray for iftv anime
dumb thought: if they're from ymir, does that mean rani's bow is ichaival?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
bath chapter
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
she mostly just attac
"A chance at murder? hell yes!"

this goober
||"Wait no please keep fighting me!"||
got a little ahead of yourself there, huh
probably just doesn't have time with all that sword focus
I mean kris sure seems gay
if they're related then this is a weird thing to say
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
I'm like 90% sure they have different mothers also but I'm not 100% sure who's an aunt
well, are the same age, but implied to have almos the same birthday (shared baptism)
They're implied to be the same age and definitely aren't twins
ye that one
yes
<a:kissmei:815036028225847296><a:kissyuzu:815036045749911592>
pretty sure they're not blood related?
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
and honor is nowhere to be seen
good priorities
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
the right kind of reaction
https://mangadex.org/title/c7421641-dc50-4a3c-80a5-5cdcb2cae890/eiyuu-ou-bu-wo-kiwameru-tame-tenseisu

<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
of course none of the suggestions include it
cypher they asked for *minus* ecchi
so I just finished ep 16 of LOGH:DNT where ||Reinhardt declares the other nobles traitors, and there's a bunch of comments claiming it's mistranslated, but they're just wrong? Apparently in the original the translation used "rebels" for both the nobles and the alliance, but the japanese is *not* the same - he uses a much more accusative word for the nobles||
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
too bad lady pretty sure he's only interested in his childhood bf
I mean madoka's not the first magical girl show to kill off characters
or am I thinking of a different r-name
... isn't he dead now
I'm expecting at some point it'll turn out that ||the highlands are sylvere and kris will have another goal where she also conveniently gets to beat people up||
||Cyrene|| and what she's doing has been introduced but she's not suffered for it yet
at least the translation on mangadex, idk if dynasty might be further
I think the manga's not quite covered that
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
those are definitely the better ones
there's definitely a fair few that do go for a guy
<:ElainaDelet:767786092375834644>
gb?
yeah this strongly feels like either doesn't-get-with-anyone or gets with a girl
thanks, tl
A full length film is pretty good to get
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>

have them kith cowards
I feel like the 3d movement in that trailer feels super unphysical and takes me way out of it
I assume that's its own canon entirely
another entry in the Re: series
(´ｰ∀ｰ`)
So a lot but not that much considering how big of a "thing" gundam is
oh, and V
in terms of distinct series it's like, what, original, X, Z, W, seed, 00, IBO, late UC?
yeah between movies and OVAs and such there's a lot of results on anilist and such
and I assume at least 10 of them are gundam
how much did sunrise make other than gundam?
presumably directors and artists in the medium would have better knowledge of what's going on worldwide, so could still take inspiration before the japanese release
https://mangadex.org/title/b997eeb1-a9a9-4d49-a107-e757a2f5ad90/our-wonderful-days I started reading this from a random search and it seems cute and wholesome from the first few chapters
which I think I started a bit of but probably just got distracted from
^ this one
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
gaaaaaaaay

I was assuming hathaway and hathaway's flash were different
I've heard of almost all of it but I've definitely not seen most

if you mean what I was reading it's https://mangadex.org/title/b997eeb1-a9a9-4d49-a107-e757a2f5ad90/our-wonderful-days
answer: probably



sure
D

definitely worth a read even as a one-shot
this was pretty fun

<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
mahou shoujos are essential workers

and you don't still want her figure now?
I mean have you seen the designs ...
"afraid" would be relevant if pokemon cared about trying to be daring. They don't, they just want kids to watch and force their parents to give them money
and they still recognise him as the same character
kids don't remember voices that well, for the most part
https://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/10873/ACT+MODE+Rumi.html okay goodsmile this is clearly just fubuki
huh so GSC aren't giving up on act mode just yet
easy to fish a new generation when there's always a new one
I mean digimon wasn't constantly coming out with new stuff like pokemon
I know someone who played through cybersleuth using, wherever possible, exclusively waifumons, and aside from the early game he was spoiled for choice
there's a load of high-digivolved mons that are basically just waifus
while they're mostly OLs though you also need like, one, maybe two actual mahou shoujo they're trying to blend in with, and one teenager who's the only one who doesn't pretend and they all bully her for being old
ok this would actually be funny if they tweak it so they don't explain why they're picking older women, so they all start pretending to act like little girls even though they're actually just all OLs
that chapter's a while ago, no?
so if someone is launching thousands of paper planes with cards in towards the duel, totally uncontrolled, and one of them eventually lands in someone's hand, that's legit?
he has no control over you tho
formula 1 has 46
who the fuck is memorising 6000 sections for yu-gi-oh rules
is "new card via act of god" allowed in the rules?
i hear an 119
the first half was good, second half was really unfocussed to kinda let down the whole thing
fairly whelming ending. like they did at least give the implication of fuuka and kukuru always being referred to as penguins and then that throwaway line, but it would've been way better if the first 2/3 of the second cour was gone through way faster and we focussed more on this late development with fuuka ||and got a real confession/them acting as stand-ins for a test wedding||
just finished aquatope because i was ill all week
the only one of those without a current sequel is FMA
I did say current, FMAB is far closer to the original than present day
also the demon lord is elfnein
also endro is basically this without the reincarnation
<:GunSol:593440201427255315>
isekai *as* cgdct
gandamu
that zaku got legs for days
... now I'm kinda curious to figure out *why* they'd remake it
I assume it's a relative nothingburger from UC?
give us news about the witch from mercury I'm way more curious about that
I feel like with the prompting of only a name more people will have more of an idea of who schumacher is instead of just a name
he's only the second most famous german
yes that one was a joke
||he really doesn't want to believe his bf's gone||

<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
"Schumacher" well that's clearly a made up name, shoe-maker, wtf japan
we all know dutch isn't a real language
which is much funnier
google auto detecting suggested it might be dutch for shoe head

basically the same
oh wait google says that's dutch
idk about any waffles but we have a Schönkopf
dew it
> The Girl I Saved on the Train Turned Out to Be My Childhood Manga/LN(?)
I initially read this as she was actually from a manga the MC made in their childhood come to life and I feel like that could be more interesting
Just watched Josee, the Tiger and the Fish with a friend. Easy 9.5+/10, need to wait for feelings to settle to decide if it's another 10
the german making fun of german
Well it took a cour and a half but ||I was right she would die, just not how||
LoGH:DNT
wow I did not expect someone to die in episode 1
so since no-one's actually stated and I've never seen any of it, does aquarion suddenly change because it loses kawamori or gains?
After a long while I've started finding a lot of GL on webtoons (enough that I can't keep up) but yeah they're massively under-represented. And I still regularly get BL suggested despite having *zero* of them favourited.
even maybe just using the phone's photo-editing to crop it
s'all good, but in future more context helps
a) I'm not going to do that to compare one screenshot that could be explained
b) the point was more that to comment on something like that it's not too helpful to only give one large screenshot that not only is in a language most readers can't read but in a script that prevents most from even guessing based on similar-sounding words
I still cannot recognise what part says that
I cannot read whatever part says that
satelight may not be as recognised as sunrise but they do have a *lot* of production credits
Just reread the survival of the fittest arc, ||it's specifically a point that he *doesn't* turn into nana and she asks why, if he wanted to know her talent, he didn't just do that||
ash should read so he can join in on this
||I don't remember him turning into nana and that would be an explicit confirmation that she has a talent, based on the understanding of his, which I don't think we have gotten yet||
||Refresh my memory?||
||Which I still believe is probably true but having already figured that out is probably too much for a timeskip||
||That variant would be wild but it would mean nana's got a talent for jin to become her.||
||Two, unless jin escaped. Not sure how Kyoya would, and good chance he might not remember ...||
||even if she's faking and plans to play the military, if she's been in prison for three years she'll probably need them just to find the others and get back with them. And then somehow get them to trust her again when they all know she murdered a bunch of them||
||actually I suppose even if tsuruoka can read minds he might decide to not let that slip and intentionally use her||
Hopefully the author can keep the story going well with this much of a twist though. Probably gonna be some big shifts in future chapters
||I'm still suspecting an "everyone has talents" kinda twist||
||If tsuruoka can actually read minds though it would be very difficult for even her to fake||
||Is it now gonna be an infiltrate-the-underground-resistance story?||
||THREE YEARS?!||
re: anime ending
I think that was probably the saddest so far
*not* from latest chapter but another big twist we got recently
I don't know how to explain it unless you're basically only a chapter behind or so anyway
probably gonna be a tone change after this & would mark the end of a second cour if we're lucky enough to get one
newest chapter sure did that
unrelatedly I just read the newest chapter of munou na nana and uuuuuh *what*
doesn't japan do relatively well in hockey?
I'm not immediately bouncing off at least, we'll see if it just gets dragged out for chapters though
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
the rival is another idol fan (and the crazy obsessive type)
it is def gay but there's a very aggressive rival ... who the love interest doesn't seem to have much interest in
she is pretty unlikeable but then there's also the child in citrus so
pretty sure I've tolerated worse antagonists
she's a lot but given the future volume covers I doubt this is gonna be a poly ending so I'mma keep with it
4 volumes should be what, 20-30 chapters?
https://mangadex.org/title/aa7e8ac9-8dec-41fa-8df0-49d4371989a0/oshi-ga-tonari-de-jugyou-ni-shuuchuu-dekinai so sadly there's only 4 translated chapters (hopefully the official english can be fast) but there's 4 volumes in the raw, I am excite for more of this
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
oh yeah this gay af
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
oh hey the first one is tagged as GL on mangadex
if bisque is also aniplex, maybe their production team are glad for the time relief?
well since it's not anime original it's much harder to have the writer only deliver the script a week before it airs
this might also encourage them to go faster due to competition but that still doesn't make me interested
it took several dozen favourites before webtoons started semi-reliably recommending it to me, but I still get BL recommended with zero
There's definitely way more
there's also a lot that drag out, sure, but chapter 13 isn't unknown-ly fast
There's definitely plenty of GL that gets there by then
<:MichiruConcern:807012058183761961>
~~||Michiru||'s already dead how much worse can it get~~
~~so you have time to read munou na nana~~
Claire best villainess
is it gay tho
isn't that most hentai
so it's not restricted to "people available right now"
that is over many decades however
ok, last eps of 86 being delayed sucks, but that was a great point to break off if it has to be
did you mean: most gundam
you don't like motorbike battleships?
why does minami feel like such a typical name for an anime like that
not even any spider powers? sexy spider themed outfit?
rayearth, inuyasha
gib IFTV anime already
cooking would be covered in the situation I suggested by just having her know different foods because she's not rich af
at this point shampoo is just its own fucking sub-trope of isekai
it was barely isekai it would work fine with just discovering she had strong power and inducting her
oh right I did drop the omnipotent saint
objectively true
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
except any shounen with a tournament arc
objectively false
still fun tho
There's shots where there was definitely effort put in even if it's not *the most beautiful art ever* mixed with super-cheap budget saving
the animation's cheap but it's at least nowhere near as broken as spoder
leadale op is cute
good thing you don't need to understand to be one
but jesus it's stretching and using analogies on *everything*
I can sort of see how those analogies would work
I think there's a lot less good translations so it's hard to tell truly what the overall quality is like in comparison to isekai. Buuuuut yeah there's definitely a lot of trash
||IIRC it's basically most of her life. She has a tiny bit of movement to interact with others in the hospital, but she spent most of her time in the game||
read a few pages of neta kyara and lol, actually acknowledging using alts and being annoyed at *which one*
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
if they'd announce it I would, miku
it's just the way it is
it doesn't feel considered at all, yeah
an almost perfect set
also for another comparison since I've read a lot of the manga, I'd count kenja deshi as fem protagonist even though like 40+ chapters in she's not 100% adapted to it, because it does matter unlike tanya
sauce?
I'm not saying they're not female I'm making a distinction about whether it matters at all. Tanya isn't female personality-wise nor is it relevant to the plot, so it doesn't count. Villainess is both, bookworm has at least the former and the latter is sometimes relevant, etc etc
probably if you explore the BL space
nop
she's just the protagonist, not a fem protagonist
tanya being a girl doesn't impact the plot at all except for a couple points where the writer wants her to be underestimated
I'd say many yes but tanya doesn't fill the reincarnated femprotag role
iiiim not convinced there
oh yeah tohru and kanna are totally isekai'd too
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
It's mentioned but it's not a dilemma that's ever actually shown other than this line
just acknowledge the silliness of him declaring undying love for her like a day after he did the same for another girl and the nonsense of them both dying, so it becomes a comedy
there's definitely some aggressive chibi going on but it's fun
eeeh still an ok length for a (presumably) monthly manga
v good start
60 pages per chapter (assuming the rest keep up with ch 1) is well above average tho
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
oh and I just saw these are *long* chapters
bonk

but maybe people in the industry know each other and went "hey this'll be funny"
they don't share any listed production companies
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
it's on tuesday
ok so mine is doing JST and ignoring their weird 24:00-27:00 broadcast times

weds next week. at least by this chart that I have no idea if it's JST or what
<@!171395487247630336> I just noticed both the gender bender isekais start on the same day

I'll just watch the actual thing next week
so ... idk
that was weird enough that I would not be entirely surprised if it wasn't the real/final first ep but it would be extremely weird for this to exist without being such
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
butt
I'll give it more eps but wow this is somethin
uh
maybe not
ok
there's definitely "quality" in this ep 1 fight but given there shouldn't be many big fights throughout I'll forgive using CG for the throwaway where they need a lot of characters
this is a weeeeeird first ep for what the rest of the show should be
so uuuh, about that ...

<:MikuStare:497709920435568640>
Danblf
every translation I've seen does it differently
No-one can figure out how to spell the old man character's name
the cast is certainly colourful in the episode preview
clicked to a random point and doesn't look too terrible yet
it's days away what can you be hearing already
have a tutorial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ciH34Qexn4
It's hardly the worst I've seen but it's clearly cashing in
the fights are reusing a lot but at least *doing* a lot so it's mildly justified
the OP is at least nice art-wise
lmao
oh hey they have uno
lmao there's a full-on screen tear where they loop the image around
it's terrible python but
also I conclude this is python now that we get to a def statement
how does the same person who gets a time string *that* way have regex further down
what the fuck is this
why's there a random sample of excel spreadsheet script
what the fuck is this monstrosity for extracting the time?
why are you converting (presumably) mm-dd to mm/dd using a replace instead of passing a format string?
... they use some placeholder code for simulating hacking a computer and there's some *weird* shit here
many static shots and reused frames
GFL was clearly made on a budget
oh the big house ... isn't their house. local govt building probably
ok that's some gay handholdin
wow that's a heck of a big house
she doesn't blink when the fish is getting sliced up but is suddenly panicking that it's going through rigor mortis?
halfway through bisque, this is fun
which is this?
cue!
watched yuri hamlet. If it was actually gonna do that for real I'd be more excited than I am right now
"how can you suck this much"
too gay for tv

sometimes?

ok so this kid has the emo hair as barely more than a toddler
oh shakespeare anime is out
hey loris watch 00s2
im not even paying attention other than that the two genderbender isekai are tomorrow
it's not the best kind of gay tho
🥚
reading new chapter of IFTV manga and it starts of page *6* of the magazine? sasuga, inori-sensei, front-and-centre
where have you been the past decade if that's your question
the last 5 minutes *is* the genderbending. Idk why they did this though they should've just used the same cold open from the manga
https://anilist.co/anime/134252
airing right after each other
there's two
yes
ok I'm sad that it's not gay but the other genderbender isekai is quite funny
maybe it'll be okay next week when they stop trying to write their own prologue and doing an awful job
the OP's not bad at least and that wasn't in the preview
*quality* happened
oh no the preview of the kenja deshi episode was legit ...
lewd
been a while since I was keeping up with that
oooh wait that one
To some extent. Pretty sure it's also because the villainess is always also hot
🪞
gay
half a season
too bad the show wasn't actually gay in the end
otome games have the villainess staple, separately from the isekai use of otome games
I mean, that's within the isekai interpretation because isekai in general is typically as the hero
fishekai
(though it is sometimes valuable because japan, china and korea all do have notably distinct themes they tend to have in their stories)
the name in korea is manhwa and weebs are way too particular about the terms
also it's a western thing to do
like "anime" manga in japan can refer to any comics, particularly if they're in the japanese style
make one
sssh
yuri? not good? absolute nonsense
sauce
(ideally both)
or sci-fi isekai
need more isekai lesbiabs
~~also all the coloured webcomics are because digital art manhwa that's physically published is coloured about as often as manga~~

the god was like "I want to give her superpowers ... how can I interpret this wrongly to do that"
nah it was 100% intentional
she's literally exactly halfway between an insect and a demigod dragon

it doesn't even mean mean, it means midpoint

ash definitely needs to remember to include this detail
yes
nearly
the cosplay is of a character from an eroge
||how many times she's been fucked||
If there's anyone still confused,
wow that many already
fabiniku is pretty much 1:1 with the manga (idk about ln) and pretty good
most importantly imo, most modern isekai is a one-and-done transmigration, whereas most old isekai either has the ability to go back and forth or is specifically *looking* for a way back
it can be retroactively applied but all the old stuff doesn't fit the same tropes
"isekai" is a modern thing
you're not the first person to say that this week
what's a font got to do with nichijou
uuuuh sure it is
*looks over at her bookcase*
I suppose it's more creative than the names in komi-san
gate is alright as an anime at least, not looked at how jingoistic the rest is
it hadn't really spread outside of china in 19, it was super late
covid was 2020
19?
hasn't it been continuously on air that whole time?
what are you watching anyway
but they didn't do it on a large scale with single pieces to figure out why and if that could be applied better. Largely because they didn't have the metal to spare
They had their own knowledge of what worked and didn't, empirical techniques are perfectly valid
Much of that process *was* known but not specifically what it was doing to the metal, just in how the overall blade performance resulted. That's the whole point of oiling the blade and quenching
katana blades are thicker than longswords tho
... the fuck that's nearly as old as youtube

you got through that trash fast
too busy weebing out over the katana
though it's been a long while
the first half was cohesive and much more character driven, iirc
I feel like even though I did enjoy the ridiculous bigger = more hype, the first half of TTGL was still stronger
and maybe understood one of them
probably but I've only watched like 3 eps
like that's an acknowledged genre that it clearly sits in
durarara is urban fantasy
what would it be if you had people from another world going to a different other world
on its own that means nothing and it's not what "isekai fans" are actually looking for
if so, imo it's isekai since it's basically in the same place and there's so many isekai where the "other world" aspect is irrelevant anyway
question as someone who's never seen it: does it have a "learning a totally unfamiliar world phase"
we need scifi isekai
Bookworm is a subversion of the absurd power fantasy scaling stuff that 99% of isekai has
stuff like kyousougiga isn't even a subversion because it's at such an aggressive tangent to the isekai genre, only sharing the other world bit
bookworm is pretty explicitly an isekai even if it's an unintentional subversion because the author didn't realise it was a trope
same
big new supply of yuri
I think because a lot of mangakas will only do (or be known) for one or two things I stopped checking what else they did, but it was definitely worth it in this case
I liked CA
oh I didn't even realise I hadn't checked what they've made, they've done several I liked and quite a few I've not read yet
it is! according to mdex
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
~~I shall save that for after work~~
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
also just finished "5 seconds before a witch falls in love" and the sequel and those are good one-shots
no share? <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
since it's you I assume you've read stuff like easy introduction to love triangles
cross ange dunks on waifu culture which makes it funny

macross frontier is on youtube
they naked to symbolise they gay
<:burger_shock:500550365188718605>
I'm just going to assume that's monogatari since it seems like one of the few lank favourites that a) has many seasons and b) would do something like that
never watched it but am i correct in remembering people saying that naruto did the same thing - but sometimes those flashbacks would be like 100 chapters and you'd forget it was even in the middle of a fight?
since there wasn't a pause halfway in between
some people were disappointed in 86 *not* doing multi-episode battles even though by not doing so it could pull off some really emotionally charged sequences in those battles
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
> multi episode long battle
I haven't watched any of it and refuse to but it's always funny to me how I'll see a bunch of people calling it good storytelling then people who I *know* are into deep storytelling will just rip it apart

probably not in 1930?
it was specifically a trade embargo
rather than just pull out or such
I don't believe it was involved in anything going on there but it does exist because coca cola couldn't get the ingredients for coke into germany so they invented fanta to replace it
a) fantasy politics, b) fanta could be surprisingly political given it was literally made for nazi germany
ok that tracks
millhi what aspect of anime are you *not* a nerd about
it's still a valid answer to "games other than dragon quest that have slimes"
nep
I started mahou shoujo ikusei keikaku today and *immediately* recognised hikasa youko, because I was not expecting ara ara voice from her character
apparently there's uncertainty on whether bender's gonna be recast
tbf I didn't hate the "the world you create can end up worse" aspect but 00s2 just made it way too disbelievably evil
there's a reason I'm saying please
plz no char clone in witch you've already proved you can do some great stuff by getting more creative with rival characters, especially with multiple
after s1 gave them actual depth so even if they were on the bad side, aside from Saachez none of them were really bad guys
s2 felt like it had to try really hard to make so many characters arbitrarily ok with A-LAWs
so yeah they'd take that as aggression if they can't understand us
I forget the exact order of events but iirc humans did fire first?
and setsuna then bridged that gap
I think there's implication that they were trying to communicate but it didn't work, so the human forces defended and that pissed them off
"living metal" usually gets used in sci-fi as "grey goo with an intelligence", and 00 is going with that, yeah

that *is* a nonsensical sentence
I think the way this description keeps escalating with "how to not sound batshit insane" keeps scaring ash

will it be too high iq for ash
lol the sword

so lank likes feet, got it
what are the other two
aw
https://ew.com/tv/futurama-john-dimaggio-wont-voice-bender-revival-for-now/
I'm pretty sure she's named after fate. Who's named after the car, and which isn't actually a real name, but japan invented this like ichaival
*bigger*!
bigger!
so was she just carting around a seemingly-dead body for 100 years

given this is an independent product and from the trailer I'm actually expecting if anything it's gonna be less mature
implying that the original didn't have very mature themes?
I have no idea who this character is but I imagine her sounding exactly like yukari from gup

https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1493337005689819136
she knows what she's about
||my interpretation is that it is 3p but it's a more complex relationship where she isn't *just* with the main two all the time||
final chapter (15) just got uploaded a couple days ago
what they said
v gay
||two of them are going out and the other is also gay but sadly not also going out with the other two||
it's like 75% gay

I figured out from the logo (and then no-one having anything more than a skirt)
for a bit I wasn't sure if this was more girls und pantsu
"tickled", yes

if a shounen has to end it's because it's run out of ideas, so it has nothing left to use on the ending
yuru camp being a possible exception
I feel like a lot of those shows don't actually show enough real detail to act as a "tutorial"
~~all the harem forgets the guy and just has a big gay polycule~~
I can find a few shounen that ended well like kanata no astra but no long ones

<a:Mako_NO:534082701494452224>
when frame arms girl tops a tag you know it's badly rated

I mean I know most suck but
how is mecha not in my top 30
all of the shows in this are quire different
and less than 10 days you've found long ones
I only have 44
and yes, it has idols
you can export the list and import it to anilist
yet another way anilist is superior

if I rank them by score instead of count
also I manage to have primarily female cast above male protagonist lol
shounen's at #29 on mine, somehow, when almost everything gets tagged as shounen by default
I find this graph funny because you can clearly see the aspect of "above 8 it's worth giving half-scores, but below that it's not worth the effort to think about"
yeah that's true
we know you watch everything millhi
I'm suspecting it's actually calculating your top 30 by time and the other rankings are that top 30
my minimum time watched for VAs goes down to 1 day 10 hours
but I don't go out of my way to watch everything
she's #5 on mine
I was gonna point out you've got less than that on studios but maybe the threshold is different
symphogear on its own should be over a day
or was she in something you rated absolutely awfully
surprised ayahi doesn't get enough from symphogear alone
<:base_think:635676313520439326>
ofc it's sugita in there
if you go my time on mine it's all symphogear still because I put in rewatches
yeah
the VA rankings end up weird though since the scoring so much doesn't reflect them
I suspect their data doesn't have that info to filter
what even is the 10
She's been in a lot of bad boomer shows
yukachi literally doesn't get listed for AXZ on the stats
If we skip the gear VAs that have such an unfair advantage I have
so 5 cours to register anything
If it's watch time I assume the minimum is 1 day
lmao
a few might be missing from mine just because of that minimum
... I suspect these stats (justifiably) require a minimum # to register because the only kinema citrus I've seen is tokyo magnitude which I rated super high
Kyoani looks like it's getting dragged down on mine with a bunch of shorts that I didn't rate highly, as well as stuff like inuyasha that's just "ok" and I haven't watched a bunch of stuff like VE

shaft isn't even top 30 <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
... kyoani's at #11 for me
paying for anilist is a req for more than 30 in the top listings
... have you paid for anilist?
anything with less doesn't get considered
the average rating is ranked among only the top 30 viewing times
you've not seen enough for more studios to register
now if you want typecast
||Aries||?
maybe it's the shows you watch
this graph is not long enough
ok correction this is the funniest graph
and only a few imported dates properly from mal
I only made anilist in 2020 so the graph's way off
anilist
at least I can see gunbuster
fuckin fate
found it by adding mangadex
google are you ok
there's definitely a few support studios on mine and they're often ranking higher than the main studio (probably because they don't register for a lot of mini OVAs and such)
mapping the depths
I only recognise the first two of them
might be all those SoL ones in there instead of railgun & co

the anime was great. Maybe one or two moments early on that weren't 100% strong in adaptation but they nailed the peak of the arc
you should it's great
then you don't get to participate in all the theorycrafting and speculation
*make it today you coward*
||seeing two of someone or someone who's not supposed to be there is more sus||
||gonna be watching out for animals that are suspiciously interested in nana||
||if anyone could escape on his own it's jin, but he'd have to stay low with kyoya brainwashed and nana imprisoned. No-one else is really capable enough to be worth risking revealing himself||
ah that's true
||the galaxybrain would be if nana is actually brainwashed now and we have unreliable narrator||
||compared to anyone else they could manipulate if they could do full memory manipulation, kyoya doesn't seem that high priority. But with memory issues he becomes an easy target||
||Given that kyoya has limited outright power I don't feel like it makes sense to go to that much effort to bring him onside; more likely memory loss and then negation to confuse him reliably onto the watchmen's side||
I definitely need to reread that chapter
||When was it explained? I don't remember exactly||
||also what exactly is nakajima's talent, he both manipulated everyone into following him and makes it so people don't notice him?||
||... something like he managed to replace tsuruoka for that one meeting and get her released?||
||and yet somehow she still got let out again - did she fool tsuruoka, or is he using her?||
also ||totally confirmed kyoya's weakness is memory||
<@!297542051057238017> a very good question
when was the anime?
i was out shoppin so didn't get to start the download, gonna see in a bit
i should catch up
oh wait I see the title
what's this one?
> compares to size of what appear to be skyscrapers
that's a big fucken bridge
~~s2 when we have a complete arc for it to follow~~
<a:MichiShock:820114520092835870>
it nailed the mystery aspects and emotional beats though
I don't think any part was weak but there might've been a couple moments that struggled with the adaptation pacing; I'd need to rewatch to be sure

*huge* ones too
somehow a lot of anime CGI can't even manage that
they at least aimed to avoid mixing cgi and 2d for the most part, and when they did they at least managed to match colour palettes
it's definitely a while industry issue I thought the CGI in shikizakura was alright at least

no it's probably because the much more expensive japanese boxset hadn't finished selling yet

true gundam does like go to for "help each other" lines too
which I don't see how you'd do without making it massively inefficient
without the incentive to massively monopolise it and invest to ride the bubble
in theory you could make an entirely new chain that is much less damaging, but then you need to get people to adopt it
eeeeh debatable. So long as everyone keeps on insisting on being sidechains of etherium it's not solvable, because it means etherium is necessary and that is inherently super inefficient
their own thing would be a cringe name but could be mildly cool

it's got a charm but I'm not ranking it as a favourite as is

plenty are definitely just to create designs
the stories
*some of
||im joking pretending there's nothin weird about it||
what
so am I these are ep 3 <:MichaLaugh:816901827349184513>

yes it is

which?
probably going to reach the high teens for total count, from what I've heard?
fair enough, though the original isn't finished yet
||as in the one that exits the phoenix? It would make sense for ending vol 4, but that's not much material for a whole cour unless there's a lot of later side stories that can be pulled in to bulk it out||
and it ended vol 3, but I'd also recommend reading those volumes also because they're very well written and it gives a lot more clarity and context
but if not then it kinda doesn't have a good ending point for one cour
if it was gonna be 2 cour they could maybe do 4-6
hard to say with such a competent team to rearrange things
but they could maybe pull in some future side stories to be part of it
I would anticipate a movie more likely than S2 because I know what's coming next and the next arc isn't really long enough for a season
I'd rank it just below the previous one but is v good
newest ep?
and it's super transparent
and I'm fine with narrative convenience in shows that just embrace it, but it really feels like it's trying to pretend it's not doing that
while the political fuckery is definitely the worst of it I think those aspects don't grab me because it can't really decide what it wants to be. Most notably the weird contrast between it trying to pretend it's real robot but then their robots are clearly super compared to everything else - especially with the weird AI avatars. And with the plot there's a strong feeling that things happen just because the plot demands they happen; like ofc as soon as he tries to leave the fighting the group he left gets attacked. Not as like a consequence of letting him leave, which would create guilt and a narrative drive that he has to make it up to them, just as pure narrative convenience
but the meme doesn't particularly work since it  never felt like it wasn't gonna go in that kind of direction
the sisters arc wasn't even behind the scenes ...
even in sisters arc?
technically it is still full sprites, just FHD ones, but yeah they're going for a particular look
aesthetically, sure
I suspect at least part of the reason not to though might be that license holders could get picky over people datamining their models out
It's exactly this; I know because I dug into the gamefiles to see if anything could be extracted. They're all just transparent videos ready to be layered.

It would make a difference in that if it was true 3D you could get fancier with the animations, since the models can actually interact, aim at each other, and dynamic cameras would be possible instead of a fixed camera that lets the videos line up.
||yeah it wasn't as super exciting, but it's necessary for story||
and ||damn that perspective shift||
<@!297542051057238017> I'm a bit late reading the newest chapter but ||huh, kyoya's memory works a bit differently than expected||
It's been a while but I believe the effects were unit-specific; they all have the firing animation that's all lined up, then for the impact animation they have a generic impacting animation that gets lined up with the mech being hit
Someone had to make a 3d model animate accurately regardless; the only question is whether it's on the build server or in the shipped game. And yes, beam effects too

they really carefully avoid full body shots
tbf I think a lot of people would decide if they wanted to watch stuff from the first eps then get premium to finish
<:catbrain:847879295996919888>
lockon stratos as a sword, huh
<:hibiki_chibi_confused_3:647943602227511339>
personal wormholes for everyone
... can't work out what it is other than probably isekai with it being in chinese
the show's still overall just "decent" but they managed to pull out a good finisher
just watched the last ep of GFL and ... that was actually a really good ending
the second prologue suit doesn't have much design language similarity to ifrit, so I'm wondering if that's an antagonist rather than a hero unit
and tbf a mech this big probably *should* have a lot of heat management issues
With the glow behind the transparent parts I'm wondering if there'll be some aspects of it being actual "magic" and the witch not being a metaphor
actually airing, not just gonna be a manga?
oh there's a few other designs on site
it doesn't immediately jump out as "okay this is the best new design possible" but there's interesting elements. Kinda a visual mix of ibo, 00, and unicorn
huuuuh. interesting design
akb0048 tho
"idols but they don't wear pants and neither does anyone else"
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
looks like someone finished the first volume, neat
that reminds me I need to look for more chapters of unforgettable witch
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
ok so this might be a wild ride, noted
50 eps in one burst would be very concerning for quality given they've just been doing kyoukai also
ok that's at least somewhat reassuring
50 eps all at once or split?
I would expect ifrit to not appear since it's clearly a prototype for ariel, the other I would put out a wild prediction ifrit will lose to it and it'll come back as a repeat antagonist
maybe they thought 5 mora was too much even for a foreigner name
<:NanaStab:782843427955146752>
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I don't like arios particularly, possibly because the transformation looks more like a missile than a plane. feels like a downgrade
I was thinking raphael but I can't remember others to compare to
that's a lot to pick from and you're asking me to remember the ones I didn't like
I did think it felt like it was supposed to be written differently but I couldn't put it down
feldt sniper would've been great. give ayahi guns more
CB MSes also were actually caught up to. That's an important difference to several series, they don't keep the advantage
did they know how innovade names or looks worked then
TTGL, maybe? If you're thinking of the escalation into absurd super robots aspect?
hamefura
the best gundam is haro
I mean LoGH does work from "imperialism is bad and is still bad when a democracy is pretending not to be doing it"
legend of the galactic heroes
actually wait I'm stupid the answer for anime with in-depth politics is obvious
at least for the first season 00 had reasonably good politics but it wasn't the focus; the politics developed in the background
oh right
... in what?
shirobako at least has more in the way of consequence for it than NG (at least if you watch the movie)
yeah that's about what I figured the response would be and it's pretty accurate
https://youtu.be/oTEy_XnJblg
I think the version of cross ange I ended up with was like 120 GB (including OVAs and other extras, but that was definitely still minority)
current releases, yes, about 1 GB
depends heavily on the age/compression used
(also UC needs appending that after the original series they go to great lengths to justify the spacenazis because their model kits are too popular)
yeah but lanks has just said that's not necessarily what he's after
also thinking about it 86's premise is literally that pseudo-japanese imperialism has and still is killing millions
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608> not seen anything about that but noted
but at least less dull doing so
DNT is going faster but it sounds like that's by like ... a few episodes. Maybe 3-6
my point with it having some consequence is they don't just get a happy ending where the company is saved by working hard, at least with the movie's context
both are good
or outlaw star
if you want space pirate adventure https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gpa9V2-H2c
... why is there a boys do horse racing anime coming up
battles that would have to take place over millions of years
with the scale it got to ttgl was just a comedy in that aspect
I would call joking about it worse
he explicitly knows and chooses to manipulate a child so that she will grow up the way he wants with the intention of getting with her in the future
he still does it
also because he grooms a child
what do you mean it's 100% about ~~pirates~~ privateers!
timezones
... this has to be april fools right
the writing isn't exactly stand-out but it's competent enough and the aesthetics and thematics carry it all the way through
even going so far as to directly copy some elements (though he swears he'd never seen it)
||so this at least means no contrary theory has been confirmed|| <:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
||my advance on that theory is that all the church members are but she's one of the only ones to not know||
ok so theorycrafting ep 1 ||Menou's definitely also from japan, lost her memory of it in the Incident, and is being exploited by the church now, right?||
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/875776155158995004/959516809948725299/SubsPlease_Shokei_Shoujo_no_Virgin_Road_-_01_1080p_BE7A3C4E.mkv_snapshot_02.54.666.jpg
now that's dedication
no rush, it's gonna be summer soon enough!
is she the one you have cosplay of
naisu
oh yeah that's one of the first
"there's some good people who're just stuck in a shit situation they can't get out of" would be one line to take. gundam regularly tries to sympathise hardline zeoners
it would be very hard to write something where a side does more warcrimes than zeon and can be taken seriously
zeon basically is the recordholder for warcrimes in media
still a week away
it went above what I was expecting
executioner ep 1
plus had part 2 to handle them
86 arguably only did one volume but it was actually more like 1.2 and the next two were short
||2 is more normal pacing||
ended *just* as ||she jumped onto the balcony to meet akari.|| And yes to momo
another week before the gay starts
just finished the executioner ep due to amq, sad we didn't really get to meet akari yet
||I feel like nana would've been one of the ones that actually gets the author involved and finds some secrets to sneak in||
nana ||was smart to at least put nanao in a few places but it's more logical since he does come back||
yeah it's pretty much immediately waving that flag
||I mean in this case it's much more signposted since dude's clearly not an executioner and does not feature in any promo material||
spring was very sparse until very recently, it'll get more
||she does say Shiro so technically Ivory would be getting rather fancy with it. does work better as a name though||
so might be able to discuss it by end of the season then
is it a vol 3 thing?
I am debating it but I have two actual books I intend to get around to reading
lol nothing's getting spoiled here 'cause I've not actually read ahead now
now I'm really curious what was identifiable that early
||gonna take a second guess; something about the class she dreams of? Like the fact they all have character designs?||
<:ElainaSeemsSus:777445649931042827>
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
wonder what triggered this
interestin
||you mean that they were dreaming of each other, I assume? Since those are very distinct outlines||
probably a year or two off given they're announcing greenlit, not "soon", but is happenin
<@!207452640886521859>
||I get the impression null guy wasn't totally dead at that point and rather than a self-destruct it was him actively lashing out with his last thoughts; so if you OHK then that won't happen||
the start and ending are definitely not english but I don't think it's french
kinda a banger too
gaaaay
I started the first movie but didn't really like the changes with the first concert & attack
also, praise ayahi!
I was expecting it to be so-so but the diegetic music really sold that aspect and I'm interested to see where it goes
way more than I was expecting
ok I'm like 10 minutes in and healer girl is good
<:ayahipog:830819358024007721>
*ayahi's in healer girl*
is this good and/or gay?
She's ||literally the second character to sing||
yes
spy x family
and I'm still looking forwards to SxF more than HG at the moment, but we'll see how that holds for future eps
I've literally only seen those two (but agree)
I'm mostly through kuroitsu, it's pretty good, not amazing (except a few exceptionally funny moments)
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
and most sites use the date it's available in america
but yeah 1:28 4/7 on TBS is first air ... idk when there'll be subs tho
oh huh. everywhere has the 8th listed
I thought machikado was tomorow?
ah fair
I figured it should already be just a day away your timezone by this point
I've not watched any kaguya
executioner and love after world domination
isn't sxf tomorrow too though?
I'm only gonna watch two of em <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
the site itself yes and 99.9% of the torrents on it, worth checking comments if you get scared about that though
<:steal:645103834980679700>
so probably gonna be a few issues with rpg fudosan in a few weeks?
Things that are already big benefit from dumps, I think, because people who don't want to watch weekly will be less likely to ignore it as something unknown. But anything smaller, yeah, they want the weekly watching to generate discussion and spread the word of mouth
no machikado?

hopefully gay ones
yes plz
akari gay af already
also new executioner ep is cool so far
am i wrong
eggplant

SxF gud
some strong gap moe there too
mature and subtextually gay ayahi
they discovered certain internet sites
artificial dere

https://tenor.com/view/tiny-text-cant-see-ken-jeong-gif-5957945
~~it probably will by the time the borders reopen~~
oh I need to watch new ep of healer girl but I was playing dnd
how long does that one take to get gay 'cause I've not managed to get very far in it now
<:mikanComfy:709788280543248384>
healer girl ep 2 is comf
<:SXFAnyaSmug:737684791318675557>
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
singing ayahi <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I will be later
https://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-story-of-unforgettable-witch/
it definitely deserves it, but at least we don't have lazy MTL making nonsense of it
oh that's an interesting twist on why things are as they are
sad that it jumped so many translators but it looks to be complete now
ye
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
it has so be said though that for someone straight this is a pretty handsome imagining
I think generally I'd prefer if it's not so explicit but there's obvious interest from both sides
mmmm
or lady or w/e her title is
the other princess isn't tho
it doesn't end with complete tragedy (unless it's gonna really throw me for a loop in the post-epilogue)
... I'm not actually sure any guys have been given names. Maybe a teacher or two has tangentially had one mentioned?
very
ash should read unforgettable witch
headcanon that it's symphogear in the future and chris invented the healing singing
those are apparently the translations the author wanted and aside from anisiphia they're kinda fine
barely
also that definitely didn't hurt akari lol
executioner theory: ||the grand hall thing that menou's leading akari to doesn't actually kill, it removes memory/soul/etc to turn them into a blank slate that the church can manipulate, and that's already happened to menou||

shur
||I'm cool with that level of spoilers||
random thought watching machikado: is the woman who walks past with her dog voiced by yukachi?
ah ok, taiga's still listing 12 eps
unless they surprise announce that it was a split cour all along 12 eps isn't going to go super far
yeah I was just thinking I'm not sure how far they'll be able to get like this
it's out for me
spy family op cool af
it's now back on the list with promise of more later
it takes a little to get to that point though and every time before I'd tried getting into it I fell off before then
https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/SH6HO9OjbH8sXDn1RBpaTmKMUrPvvRCiczrCi7gyo60/%3Fc%3DVjFfZGlzY29yZA/https/media.tenor.com/IU0S825uzxwAAAPo/spy-x-family-anya-spy-x-family.mp4
she's obv gay but that doesn't mean it's gonna be reciprocated
<:ElfneinLewd:247367764270907392>
given stuff I've asked that about before, yes
ooh is that confirmation magirevo is actually gay?
ok wtf
"forgot his name, sparkly" <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
<:hibiki_chibi_wise_nod:751945928163983440>
||also the waking up was kinda odd but I can't point to why as much||
||some wild guesses but I like it. I think I'll probably stick with a more mundane dream invasion/control and the mark is a trick to make her think it's counting real loops, and she's just generally trying to figure out how nana ticks so that she might give away hiding spots or such||
||if it's an actual loop that might be to get her to trip up? But then again why would you let her know you're watching ...||
||that would be the first thought, but then does that reset after it finishes? Is there a downside to it?||
||maybe it does have limits related to the bar though, perhaps she can only do it so often or only the first loop counts||
||oh that's true, if it was a legit time loop why would she be starving - she could learn where food and water are and redo each day to steal them without anyone noticing||
<a:MichiCry:820115391866732554>
||since it's nana this stuff can't exactly be ruled out but I'm not sure if this would be the immediately obvious play for a dream-invader to try||
read it coward, you're reading everything else
||I just found the line about being so tired kinda sus but I'm not sure if it would be going that many layers||
||ok dream theory probably not, was just spitballing as I read. Could've been an interesting idea, but I guess she's either going to have to get saeki on-side or out of the way||
||or is this some inception shit and she's in a forced dream that saeki can observe?||
||another timewarper?||
so I can skip watching anything else in it and just watch the seasonal?
but which one is the imouto
not a studio/adaptation combination I would have ever predicted but I'm sure <@!171395487247630336> will be interested
<:ChrisSing:586715673359679488>
iiinterestin
which one?
||that akari potentially un-summoned herself is a heck of a theory||
currently listed as 12
||novel does make it much easier to just cut for a scene in the middle of another chapter without confusing it too much||
quick summary ||had them arrive in the city & visit the cathedral, met old hag, we saw flare take on menou as an apprentice and a montage of training in the mountains somewhere where she decided to git gud at murder, then went back to the hotel where menou promised to go around town with akari||
curious what theories you have
executioner ep felt short weirdly, but there was a lot of backstory exposition so hopefully next ep speeds up
<a:LenaSigh:961948631299141652>
<@171395487247630336> I was going through old screencaps I grabbed and I am once again confused how you didn't think adashima was that gay

will they die from exposure
finally finished the whole PS5 catalogue
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
||I also figure she's probably got at least some subconscious control over the power already 'cause first death she didn't rewind the world and on the train she did - if she was truly panicked about the hug she'd probably undo it||
||having control over time and being unkillable isn't already different enough?||
||All the indications are the other kids could use their powers when they wished, I don't see why akari would be different (eventually, maybe she doesn't have conscious control yet)||
<a:ChrisRage:745358256242688102>
damnit so many spoilers
novels are a paaaaain to get through
one-off stories aren't the same <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
gay?
discordumb
at least this one's self-aware

yes
some interestin stuff in what else they've done

tsukuchi needs to use what she's gleaned to tease like hell
just looked at this now and it looks cute <a:NOTED:920424054748491776>
||but maybe that's just the more modern they are the more revolutionary they were||
||kinda weird the monastery had imagery of sailor uniforms still when that's only the past 100 years||
||some of the dialogue implied such but not in a way that couldn't be unreliable narrator & there actually was a summoning that was covered up||
||I assume you mean for random summonings rather than rituals?||
||also exactly how many kids are supposed to be going missing in japan?||
||seems rather a cheap explanation when time powers are involved||
||It feels like the worldbuilding is too consistent for this to have gone totally unconsidered, though. And we know that akari (And possibly others in the past?) can wibbly wobbly timey wimey - so is there some significance to the fact everyone is apparently coming from a fairly short period in japan but crossing hundreds, possibly thousands of years in this world?||
so something that puzzles me with executioner ... what's up with the world's timeline?

They supposedly get lots of isekai'd kids from japan, yep, cool, checks out. ||why's the old architecture european / edo period? And supposedly hundreds of years old? How did they have an ancient civilization that explored space?||
I'm glad we have CEX here handling basically any tech
... yeah thinking on it more most ways to take it probably wouldn't pay off as well
my initial thought was more like "what if ali al saachez got one of the actual gundams abandoned somewhere but with the GN drive removed". Then can replace it with a tau to make it red and evil without a major overhaul to the design (other than the second season animation changes)
... ok yeah it could be done bad
actually what if an antagonist got it
... I think it would probably be possible to do it in a way that pays off well by having them be competent and forcing the MC to do better, but yeah I can see that would almost never happen

ooooold jrpg
yeah i mean it's not even gay what's the point
||I'm also wondering if they're coming from elsa's insecurities and it was triggered by the hesitation but *really*?||
I was waiting for it the whole date and it's fuckin *there*
(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
Just caught up on please bully me, villainess
... you can't just fuckin end a chapter like that
I have a (near?)-OG one with c h o n k y power brick
the truly retro stuff is low-volume but if you bring it they'll probably take it
"should we try to hide it" "nah what are they gonna do, complain about free promotion to easily influenced kids?"
<a:FalfaExcited:862904005276860436>
when's the girls und pantsu idol again
anything that looks like it might be even vaguely idol-related gets downrated by mainstream anime fans pretty quickly. And this probably doesn't have the major idol fanbase counteracting it
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
is it gay?
the unicorn's head looks better in its closed helm version anyway
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>

they need to kith
railgun doesn't really have it as a sideplot tho
railgun should be yuri with the good girls it has but definitely isn't, at least as far as the anime got

the thirst is strong but two pages will not quench it <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
specially when I've got this in a chapter 1 instead of 139
not if it's only one page
why'd you drop it?
I should catch up on that at some point
I also generally prefer the pacing it has just on the anime-only side. It's got less cut-aways to random tangents about other characters when they're just peripherally mentioned, it saves flashbacks for when it's actually pertinent
so I've started watching a few episodes of LoGH now that the remake is quite far along and unlikely to get spoiled with out-of-order events, but so far the event order is quite similar.

what does differ quite a bit is the details of some events - and from skimming the first novel, DNT is *way* more accurate
... that one might be on my list? but I definitely haven't started it
which is it this season?
they also still have kyrios but with shipping & import that's probably not helpful for you <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
... I just found a UK shop that claims to still have dynames. Gonna check they're not a scam at lunch & probably order
I missed out on dynames and can't find any second-hand now
not as far as I'm aware?
suppose they could just do a new one anyway but it suggests not exia (and not S2 since starting with flier would be weird)
previously they were hinting and the next kit with the cover but virtue just loops back to kyrios
I've got kyrios and virtue (waiting to build) at least but c'mon I want a full set
I'm sad that it seems the new 00 kits aren't going to include a redo of exia
i read book 1 very quickly and now I am le tired so I am spending that equivalent time gunplaing
I don't want to check how long it's been since I did my anki deck ...
neat
applying MTL to it or actually learning to read directly?
wow goin fast through them then
at least 80% of pink-haired characters are named momo I swear
||I feel like even if she isn't an otherworlder that love + grant one *is* a pun anyway, but a punny name doesn't mean you're from japan||
wondered what that was <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
<:catbrain:847879295996919888>
||... what if she actually had a pure concept like "love"||
||Using kana for a japanese name lets you hide a lot, which is a trick the nana author likes to use||
||https://jisho.org/search/menou%20%23names first kanji one is love + grant, second is budding/sprouting + ability/skill, then favour/kindness + grant, eye + concentrated/undiluted, eye + ability, and finally agate. There's more than a few options even before you consider what concept she might have/had and how that plays in||
||yes ms clocktower||
I'm not gonna jump straight into volume 2 at least, though I have bought it
||I also still think she's an otherworlder even if I'm no longer leaning towards they knew each other before as much, because why else would she have survived the bleaching when nothing else did||
||I'm not sure what else would really fit it, other than *Akari* planting the deja vu intentionally, maybe to give her hope that someone would accept her - that she's been affected by the future being sent back checks out with akari's deja vu whenever her mind pops back||
well it's just started a whole new arc so that might be a while
read nana you coward
||I figured it would be akari coming into her powers that ultimately saved it but after all other times resulted in mindwipe that she would send her own *mind* back in time to do the rescue was a twist. With the sense of deja-vu and Menou using the Time also I'm thinking that the dream is actually that at some point in the future she's used that power to reset ... almost everything||
also naaaah it's a great ep
I have actually read vol 1 now and I'm feelin 6, but with *that* from the epilogue moved
so it looks like 6 eps for executioner vol 1. suddenly quite a lot in one episode

so akebi x erika is canon for sure
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>

maybe that making of says otherwise but with the lighting change I suspect the unicorn [emu] wasn't filmed in one take, or even close to it. And as such the audio is likely from a studio instead
It definitely holds up on rewatches, especially after reading it, where you can pick up on these details because you're noticing & reacting to the same things with the character context
harder to get across the subtleties when it all has to be read from tiny expressions/reactions rather than mentioned explicitly
he does have personality in the anime, but it's kept extremely subtle, since the main point of his character is a traumatised-beyond-repair kid
yeah 86 goes full mecha = tank so have that on the watchlist
can't believe that's getting a season 2
a third season?
it says "to be continued" so
ah i need to read the new chapters
sauce?
powerful
not gonna cosplay?
It's not the highest budget but it's sure clearing the expectation bar
lazy is hard to accuse it of with the animation quality and effort to make actual musical sequences
I expected it to be a very lazy not-idols-plz-look-at-our-girls-and-merch show
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/875776155158995004/971453845278433340/mmmm.mp4
parents get in the way of kids saving the world
or, possibly had. We don't know if fudou would have allowed "useless" ones to live
according to Lore™️ gen has like 10 brothers but we only meet one
~~if they really want to cash in they need to allow lewds~~
light novels
y'know what that means you need?
too much manga
there's no stopping lewds of vtubers
vtuber project would be very funny with the yakuza thing
ONA then? Or possibly a vtuber project?
nah SAO is definitely part of the isekai trend
honestly I kinda wanted her to make up with & get with the heroine rather than the girl she rescued at the start
the MC's got goals and is working towards her own stuff while the other's just staying at home like she was told and is basically acting as a blank slate. The vibe I kinda got is very much like the typical shounen love interest who just does what the MC wants
at least with adashima it's honest interest in both directions where shima's still happy to have adachi around even though she's being way more obvious about it than taru
It's been a while so I can't really point to exactly what bothered me but I just wasn't feeling very good about it
it feels like it's reciprocated in a very hollow way 'cause the other girl doesn't really have anything else. At least as far as I've read
I also don't know if I particularly like the yuri in it since it seems very one-sided
I've basically stopped that in the second volume because so many of the horror scenes just drag on so long and I just ended up feeling eeeeh
I could potentially be curious about a show that subverted those stats in some way and acknowledged it's nonsense to summarise people that way, but I'm not sure it would be done in a good way. it's like the least interesting part of bofuri and bofuri's not exactly top-tier stuff
probably a lot less 80s and 90s anime would look bad if 2 cours wasn't a short show, since they'd be able to focus a bit more on individual episodes
oh yeah that's definitely something from SAO, isekai just being an MMO
welcome to 90s/early 00s anime, when you could fairly easily get 4-cour slots and were expected to fill them
instead she's horny for the teacher and there's some random other villain who had no previous connection and doesn't reveal one
its trajectory before frill was towards either the main villain being depression itself and this being a neverending but essential fight, which could've been really interesting to play out, or the villain being the teacher, which could've still been satisfying
mostly been reading manga but also a little of logh novels
not yet, will probably end up being spurred on if there's something left hanging in that arc in the anime that I'm too curious to leave for a week
had plenty of other things to read
but oh well
but thing is I'd probably at least be pushing through if milkit didn't feel like a blank slate at this point. if she had something more complex going on already, like still being reserved, instead of like she's already totally fallen for the MC and has nothing else to her character
just checked and yeah 48% through vol 2
I like a long book if it actually feels properly paced with a reasonable progression
I think
"later books" isn't very encouraging when I was already feeling it drag in vol 1 and I basically dropped it in vol 2
at least that would be interesting character dynamics
it just did
~~I'd argue it's more powerful to have predicted the next arc's power in nana at its first appearance~~
I mean I did end up reading ahead vol 1 after like ep 3 or something
at least so far, the further it goes probably the more you'd have to twist it to make that fit
the same plot could mostly work if she just arbitrarily gained time powers as an existing person in the world
that too
this one's gay tho
watch the anime then coward
||"there's some magical limit" is also an option but just actually gaining menou's trust is just as valid||
||I assume if she didn't ping herself back to how it was it would kinda break stuff with their relationship developing, or just be super-boring for her to be reliving that so many times rather than just going through key moments to fix stuff||
and it did indeed cover the whole of vol 1 in the end
it's not exactly the most complicated thing to get right, and there's plenty more german text in-show
so post it then
don't have a big spiel of questions this time?
Legend of the Galactic Heroes Die Neue These
[logh] oh boy, time to double the series death count so far
weebs
and she got better ones!
knowing I'm likely to drop them makes it hard to start more, getting invested for not actually having payoff
and those are *long* books individually
like the longest wheel of time novels only just poke 400k and I see figures like that not-irregularly for fanfic
really? Just looking at the word counts fanfics tend to be insane compared to novels
I've read a lot that like to be really flowery or have a *lot* going on
at least if it's LN published you have some idea of novel length & that it should get started within a couple
so it inevitably becomes a stupid-slow-burn even though it's not supposed to be
I think a problem fanfic can have even when it is written well is it's just written ... too much
yeah I've occasionally tried that and the only one I stuck through was iftv
I find it a lot harder to read fanfic tbh
I've had trouble finding nearly as much in the anglosphere, particularly if I'm looking for stuff that's actually good
like I'm any where near having 100%ed the translated yuri
I imagine mel would
because then you can also give recommendations and spread the yuri
there's always more gay if you look

https://mangadex.org/title/267c7be2-88f8-4e5a-b8c6-6058a127b267/will-these-words-reach-you have you read this one?
the gay density is much higher!
that's the problem!
but I can read more yuri if I read it in english!
I need to try raw reading for 日本語 practice but efforrtttt when I could be reading more gay in the same time
it's not bad so long as you're not going to complain about the mere existence of cgi
absolute nonsense, love it
ok the opening scene to estab-life 4 is great
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>

<:kannamunist:670673989454266408>
it definitely stumbles but it's a competent contrasting-sides story advocating for disarmament, and also kinda gay

not sure that's how that works
<:meow_sleep:868448300930576435>
I have not yet
I haven't much liked RPG realestate but exectioner and shamiko are great. Healer Girl isn't bad but it's still feeling like it's teetering between being a great or just being an ok gimmick show
also op is weakest so far
like there's way more cuts to those chibi scenes and they don't seem to fit into the actual events in quite the way they did
it could be the worldbuilding is part of it but it feels like a lot is lacking
I got more than one line on first listening
I would rate dark oblivion as much clearer on average
the only bit I'm fairly sure I recognised is "cut to the chase"
... that's fairly <:catbrain:847879295996919888> english
same vibe as this
https://tenor.com/view/meme-gif-21437085
it's like it's trying to be a casual comic font but is far too rigid for it
why does this font feel as uncomfortable as the text it's used for
could be funny if done for humour that they're just trying to be friends and she's too awkward about it but that's not generally how it goes
yeah that's a bit ????
~~crossdressing should be leading to egg cracking and then gay~~
wasn't there something recently that they're moving away from free-to-view towards all-premium though?
they streamed blackfox a while ago. idk if they still have the license, not checked
gay?
maybe the mcnalds is across the street
there are several chapters that have straight-up nippleplay

yes
I would definitely say machikado momo has a few screws loose
and it's more than just these two there's loads of pink-haired momos
yes, it's a colour pun
because momo means peach and the "ideal" japanese peach is very pink

actually I'll revise what I said there
If it's dropped because it's not to your taste I think rating it then is dumb, if it's because you can see there's objectively bad things about it like awful animation, fair enough
and then it should be given the resources it needs to not be a 3
hence something that's "bad" within the standards of what gets made is still like a 6
and even in the world we do have that stuff's rare because usually investors are reasonable enough to say "no wtf"
this is pretty much it, and in an ideal world 1-4 wouldn't even exist because stuff that bad would never actually be funded, or at least not without enough revisions to make it better than that
but I want more of yukachi being dum and gay
I've only watched the anime
somehow one of them still doesn't realise they're going out

fair
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/875776155158995004/974683081783013426/Screenshot_960.png
the translated title is now also super disappointing because it's so much less clearly gay
ofc the straights will still try deny it even if they learn this
... that makes so much more fucking sense
<a:shiba_nod_cropped:972661360162906123>
git gud
like sure she's aiming for a printing press but it's been like 5 minutes in less than half the episodes so far
I feel like there's been very little focus on that goal lately tho?
I mean I don't think it's actually exceptionally lacking in making sense, it's just not entertaining
if it's just chuch politics idk if I'd be interested in it going deep anyway
tbf I feel the plot here is also weaker now too. Before it was interesting how she'd get to make her books, now it's all about church politics
possibly
Idk what it is but the delivery of a lot of things has just been kinda whelming - especially the chibi cut-ins - and the OP is easily the worst so far
it's not the worst thing on but it's the worst of everything that had good reason to expect anything of it
in contrast I think biggest disappointment might be honzuki
<:tamaSakuraChan:692149129652076584>
I need to finish that nonsense
... now that you mention it I feel like there might be a second pun there but I can't recall which kanji it would be if there is one
momo always chooses violence first
kinky
the OP is a lot more "standard opening style" but I really like the first cut and the fleet pan
it also had different EDs (which I didn't like as much from the 1 or 2 I heard)
but who knows since I doubt CR simulcast previously
NHK version does differ from CR in the previous seasons
ED that the western version of DNT3's getting. I quite like the style of the video
I really need to rewatch top o nerae
yeah it's being simulcast-ish, which is impressive
but it's the OP in the version west is being shown
huh, guess they're basically going simulcast then
unless we're getting them early
do you have the year right? 'cause I just watched episode 9 of gekitotsu
at least it is on the western version
it's currently airing as TV
https://open.spotify.com/track/4dzl4oqOEsKWRdzaDRY2Uz new OP for season 3
do it
oh no unprotected handholding
and at current pace this adaptation might take longer than the original lol
maybe 7 at the low end
from cross-referencing episode counts of events in the original I'd assume something like 8-9 seasons in total
absolutely does not give a shit

[logh] well that's sure an understatement
so feel free to rate WEP as a bad mahou shoujo 'cause it is
if it looks like it should be but then it fucked something up then go ahead
if you're one of the people who's mass-consuming stuff just to be "the guy who watched everything in this season" then rating stuff that's not to your taste is dumb
just bestie things
and then have storytellers refer to this adventure as your wedding aisle
sounds like a personal problem
you have boxes don't you?
why not
<:doubt:484139588089282580>
coward
lazy and reading protagonist x rivalsan
||yeah||
executioner ||so I'm betting new girl is the child of an otherworlder?||
and it's why stuff like baito is borrowed from arbeit rather than an english term
during ww2 japan had positive interactions with german colonial troops in the pacific and that lead to german kinda becoming the secondary borrowing language for japanese. The fact WW2 was the cause isn't much associated now but it means that if you want a foreign language that sounds more exotic than english, you go for german
did you mean all anime and german 'cause that's very explainable
||pretty sure she'd probably guess that it's a loop to avoid death and hasn't thought "wait why would she go this far back"||
this, probably
a totally foreign concept to both of them
madoka, yes
just their function in the story
and I'm careful to say roles because the characters themselves also aren't the most developed it seems?
from what I've seen of it the world seemed fairly undeveloped and there were just a few key character roles developed to tell the original story
oh is shinkalion in the final DLC?
I don't have the final DLC yet so that might not be entirely true for mine
2/3 out of 9 is better than I was fearing it might be though <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
so it's been a while since there was any story progress
that's definitely what it feels like, and I'm trying to sweep up all the DLC as part of that
I'm not too surprised to learn I'm fairly early, doesn't really feel like there's enough non-DLC series involved yet for it to have even finished its early buildup
and are we talking like 5 or like 20 chapters
I have 33 hours played but because of AFK time that might be poorly representative; I've had the double gravity rifle for the huckebein for a few non-dlc missions, if that's a better reference?
I had not
<:SXFAnyaLaugh:788824806526681158>
I started playing SRW30 again now I got a new laptop that can reasonably play it, and so I don't have to be at desktop for it, and one of the missions I did was intro for shinkalion
kid's a neeeerd
I'd say at least an anime can't have loading bugs but ex-arm proved that wrong
not turning the tide on its own I don't think, but I'm happily moving it in
For me it's already at a point of holding its own in usefulness with a bit of speed upgrade and hit & run
we'll see!
I vaguely remember from previous discussions that purple2 has powerful AoE buffs and I assume that much of that's from the CUB
don't remember if that's one I already have but she's regularly deployed already so noted
but not enough money to do a lot of those, hence just focussing on all-round survivability before I specialise too many
yeah I've got a couple
atm I'm just sharing out the initial levels of health upgrade to everything so they at least won't get annihilated if I need to deploy them
ahh okay. so a NG+ difficulty where you need to know what you're gonna use
and you're supposed to match damage output to that without being able to upgrade weapons?
jeez
didn't want to annoy any license holders that the original stuff was better
aaah was it votoms that thing came from. I didn't check on him
might have to grab that then. I was referring to the one that specifically gets called an "intro mission"
ye
<@297542051057238017> dat chapter ending
is that the one with the content warning
on a different note i caught up on the current tl of trying out marriage with my female friend and aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
honestly same at the moment. the rest are cute but there's no connection while mai still being flustered over her is adorable
I feel like the closest asumi might get to harem is she settles with one but they have an open relationship that can still have fun with their other friends
not even slightly
that's asumi
I think this is a case where I'd be good with either a 3 or either of the first two to be suggested
there has been progress but it could definitely have been done faster and with less gayharem esque drama
yeah rather than not wanting to be lovers because she's straight - she definitely ain't - she wants to be bffs because she was a loner and feels that's easier to handle
I can't actually remember any guy characters
from reading the fan tl while I see where you're coming from, not really, guys don't really factor into it at all
are you implying I'd be able to make an idol show solo?
japan needs to fix this
I have discovered that, at least according to AMQ, there are no mystery-themed idol shows
sounds like you need more of them
it at least has green!

the wild frontier is described somewhat differently in LN compared to how it was shown in anime
||Rather than not remembering, maybe the downside to her talent is that she's actually awake for it and that's meaning she's not getting sleep. That would also give her an opportunity to draw the count on to create misdirection when the dream ends||
||timeloop could make sense on its own; if the other person knows it's a dream, they'll just go "lol why would I give anything away? If this is lucid let's go to disney world". If they think it's a timeloop they start panicking trying to control it and you can exploit them||
||ooh dream invasion that saeki doesn't remember would be neat||
||I think a bunch of them lied but twin trick is the most obvious||
Jake I'm working from this theory ||since after the first couple *none* of the talented have been open and truthful about what their power actually is and it doesn't make sense that her power would be considered weak if she can force days to repeat until she gets the outcome she wants||
||yeah I don't think saeki would've let fuko go to actually do that if it played out for real. She's her only lead, she'd at the very least be waiting there to catch nana||
||If it's actual timetravel very specific details could matter, and therefore be worth actually detailing. Skimming information is not in the style of nana unless it's definitely not gonna matter||
||having actual timetravel on a chapter called that would be a change but it's not impossible - but the way they sped through days this chapter kinda made it feel more dream-like to me||
has been for a while
||I'm pretty sure it's gonna be 正, just a tally count like you were thinking. But atm it's not clear if it's gonna be limited to that 5 or if they're gonna spread all over her||
*assuming no new PS5 games are released
||if it's a dream she doesn't have to get out of the fuko situation but jeez saeki knows too much. And seeing that is gonna be rough regardless||
<:ElfneinLewd:247367764270907392>
if a torrent's not downloading probably there's no-one still seeding it
Stuff like SAC and evangelion count as mystery by the tags. But nothing shows up for idol + mystery
might not be enough space
just nana things
"to" quotes the nan(i) as a phrase, and ka is questioning what it was
nan-to-ka, more like "something, I guess?"
everyone in the show speaking one language for convenience is one thing, one person randomly having a different language and it never being acknowledged is a bit different
I don't remember does it ever address why the magical thing speaks completely in english and nanoha understands it fine
hopefully that's the reason, it was just relaly noticeable
the animation quality wasn't bad and a lot of the episode had fresh animation, but ... you'll see
... and the lounge. Slightly concerning for how the show's production is going
ok there's a *lot* of animation reuse in this bar scene
momo is vulnerable to headpats, noted
but the best otome isekai is gay tho <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
gay?
wait is the anime using anja as the canon localisation
parents who actually have helicopters
gold already looks tacky enough if you're not really careful with it, gold with gatemarks, ugh
if that thing's an all gold frame it better be *one hundred percent* undergating for MGEX pricing

I'd have a way better chance with untranslated JP
given I don't know any CN that one might be a while out
I assume this is that she's so smart she's never thought of it as difficult

<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
most modern military vehicle in those is the american school's super galaxy
and she doesn't even return for der film or das finale, at least with her tank
there is technically one exception as the teacher used a modern tank, but literally no-one else
those are definitely not 2000s tanks
"modern day"

literally the message above lol
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
not enough girls kissing
so many different sites to track ...
and she has a BF?
so fenny is this actually trying to turn GL or just playing it for a bad joke
we've been over this it's just bestie things
I mean according to that page, she's equating failing and being below the average
unless it's not a true fail but they're calling it that for doing "badly"
yeah if half of students fail that's possibly more concerning
<@278860841485598720> is this thing
interestin first couple chapters, I think I'll be going all the way through this
and I see this is more GL to read, noted
the school / exam board does need to know what they're doing, yes
it's similar to how open book exams are actually terrifying at a competent school. It doesn't mean it's easy, it means you're expected to get *everything* because you can double check things - but only double check them, you do *not* have time to work through new questions from the book
yeah, they're meant to replicate having to solve these problems in a workplace (though haven't really been updated for the internet age). You *do* have a calculator in your pocket 24/7 nowadays
but if you are having to read through it for every little thing you'll probably run out of time anyway
that happens here too, at least in the higher level exams. The challenge is in applying the equations, not remembering them, so you can't be screwed over by misplacing a letter
~~no-one wants it~~
||I called it before getting to the altar even so <:UniFlex:815035902065246208> ||

I'm barely past akira wondering about the mother
<@161155855524298752> (and possibly <@297542051057238017> ?) I've not read far enough for this to be revealed if it has, but I have a theory about satsuki's mother ||that she was the one she saw outside and it's why both her and her dad are so intense about it||
neeeeeeeeeeerd
ah yes, in the yuri kingdom
<a:shiba_nod_cropped:972661360162906123>

I mean we're all watching executioner so ...
honzuki's so boring this season
gay shit?
and for that character archetype you're still competing with characters like light and lelouch
yes, playing underhanded means exploiting the power systems that exist because other people won't take that approach. That's what underhanded means
shield hero
that's personality?
yeah it's very average
saihate no paladin fits that exactly
this does also mean you could read magical girl as demonic girl
it's the one read as oni
the kanji on its own is *explicitly* demon
It's more that demons have magic powers in japanese folklore and more neutral uses of the idea of magic dragged the same kanji in and softened it
the neutral ones are the exception and demon is the default reading on its own
though it's typical that unless you're using a use case that's known to be neutral like mahou, ma- refers to demon
yes
isekai exploring the "reincarnated as the evil one" is going to end up with a lot of them actually being good just to be relatable because most people aren't evil
I approve because it means that we get demon lord elfnein
~~is that when they kith~~

... is that shinkalion?
<a:NOTED:920424054748491776>
isn't that all companies
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
do they kith at all?
menou
how many other stupid akaris are there around?

they just ... never wear them
like, IIRC there was something about the magic to do with it? But then people *don't* start wearing pants when they lose magic
it also just refuses to really explain why no women wear pants
but the people doing it I'm sure were very aware
I'm not sure the people who demanded it happen did
also yes strike witches gay
still a bit of an outside bet though
but it's less surprising if it is that recent
huh, I thought shinkalion was older than that
unless they just really went for an outside bet
I'm surprised if shinkalion is recent enough to have been referencing youtube. I thought youtube in japan only really exploded like, 2018 onward
why is her nip showing
japan could you hold it with the pun names for *one goddamn second*
looks like a guy so I'm out
"only"
and half the final episode being a medley of every other song they've done in the show
||I was kinda suspecting she wouldn't just be an innocent victim since she was so calm about it, but I was kind of expecting manon to be a little bigger of a threat instead of just *pop*||
that would definitely help
there's like 4 irregular verbs in the whole language and they're mostly the most common verbs
Japanese has more forms than other languages but the forms are *super* regular
*munchmunchmunchmunch*
I'll say at least ep8 still had like, reasonable animation quality. If you considered each set of animation individually and ignored how like 5 minutes of the episode was reused
like it's certainly a visually interesting design but it doesn't hold up to the world's internal logic
it's just so dumb that it's so much, in such weird places, like the arm joints - what's this stuff actually supposed to *do* that sacrificing structure there is better than just hanging more layers on the outside, if you must insist on having it? Is it supposed to be stronger than the metals? In that case why's it not 100% psychoframe?
with reputable companies it's generally not intentional, the prototype is very hand-made and the production one has to be made en-masse
assuming that the production model is identical to the prototype, yes
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
instead of "ok I paid, let's try fuckin?"
asumi and childhood friend have investment and that's where there's gonna be interesting interactions since they already know each other
I'm pretty sure she'd been with at least one other before it came up
she started suspecting, and it was after like girl 4?
and we're at less than 1 girl per chapter
I'm not sure the pacing is that fast and she's probably still doing her own stuff
parents is maybe but she's also still not convinced it's the case and then she's the weirdo if she's going digging stuff up
she doesn't know her social media and I suspect the way the brothel works is they don't share *actual* contact details for more than just the session, for privacy reasons. Since that's very tightly regulated in japan
how?
no!
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/875776155158995004/984157479426486372/Girls.Last.Tour.S01E01.1080p.BluRay.10-Bit.Dual-Audio.FLAC2.0.x265-YURASUKA.mkv_snapshot_05.29.404.jpg
that's a hell of a tone change in the middle
also Mai might still be on that holiday?
apparently there's a lot of lesbians at this brothel!
if she starts going and meets mai first
oh that would be so good
nanao's so confused lol

that's one way to put it

<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
new asumi-chan chapter!
I found it on mangadex and have it noted for future
how gay is it
||Not quite sure why she didn't join the kids with her at that point but it was a wild reframing of everything she'd done. Suddenly not straight at all||
qualia?
just read this
what the fuck just happened?
I think the narrator-ish voice at the start was also in WEP and that made me concerned to start with from the similar vibes, but it looks like it could be neat
polymath
<a:trynottocry:928082007978835989>
I'm way behind on it also but would consider carrying on
answer the question
if you're sad about the lack of idols ||don't be he's not the idol's only child and the other one also wants to be an idol||
not sure why that makes it less interesting it's got *way* more going on as a result
less interesting?
the synopsis is really just a weird way to get the characters in position for the mystery & showbiz politics aspects to get rolling
if not it *must* be in ep 2
without reminding myself of the pacing my guess would be that the ||murder|| happens as the end-of-ep-1 shock stinger
much as that plot sounds like it could go real bad shota stuff, it doesn't, very minor spoilers for very early on (probably first or second ep) ||the idol gets murdered while her kids are like 4 and most of the plot is the doctor trying to figure out who killed her||
her fights do last longer with description rather than video
and tomorrow is an all day party with friends so probably not this weekend
not more than a couple pages
coward
you always say that
the world story is definitely a li'l easier to follow in novels
<:catbrain:847879295996919888>
||I mean she is kinda least active so far but also she's the most tied into the whole story overall||
||not interested in the fact she's the one causing pandemonium to be let loose?||
||princess x momo tho||
thoughts?
and so much info! for those who haven't read on
aaaaand the final form is a liiiittle disappointing but still a good episode
ok, that's sure an attack
when isn't she
||oh interesting. So they're actually adding details that were guessable but never confirmed||
yeah
||Showing Akari healing Momo||
||probably something brought forth from vol 3 really||
oh? a deviation from the LN?
time for executioner
believe in the power of yuri

||wild guess: menou finds out?||
well without having read vol 3 to know what's importable I can't guess if this is an anime original ending to be more satisfying or to leave a better stinger to keep interest for an S2
reason to watch at least
interestin
huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh
das p gay
I'm not fixin that typo
do they ktih
ash is quite simple, it seems
there's plenty of straight romance where that bar wouldn't be met
||she's also repeating time endlessly to try prevent menou being killed by flare, to the point that she's looking to be killed by her if it'll potentially save her||
and the boob manga is super gay
ash is silly it's gay

green tea bitch update
... people with talent shitposting is something else
that's really the level of thought wing puts into things
he laughed because it's cool and edgy to laugh when you have power
almost all of his laughing is *after*
he was super edgy *before* that and it happens super early
idols und pantsu
and with no more anime coming you have no more excuse for not readin the books
I've been stupid tired this week
when the mood strikes
so confirmation that the story isn't over, though not a direct confirmation of more anime
yes
oh ok there is actually an after credits too
there isn't an actual ED, just plays over the ep, but if you're wondering about ||Manon||, the answer is yes
ok it's definitely not perfect but i do kinda like this in the end
I mean I think it is more climax than full ending, idk how they'd pull together a full ending for all the questions available
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
||she's a long way tho and the situation sure looks desperate||
||she runs to get to menou instead of teleporting||
ok one point against the anime original ending because it forgets a power akari has
remains to see what's going on with this anime original ending tho
that was the only post on that one
||plenty of anime have done quiet tense climaxes, but I don't think novel 2 really manages that, it kinda just falls in the middle||
||that's possibly part of it, my thought was just that they want it to be a pairing climax of working together, and to get a few more interactions since the novels basically just cut to them walking out of the city||
||part of the anime original change is her actually not doing as much, Akari doesn't come in and save her in the novel Menou manages with just ashuna||
it's way more clear how gay akari is when you actually see her thoughts
ok fine twitter don't embed
I had this thought earlier and didn't mention, but https://twitter.com/TomAznable/status/1537669838985957378
so it does seem that most of the early uses don't use a visible blade and that's somewhat iconic to the modern imagining of it. Usually the older ideas seem to be more blade made of force field, rather than a blade made of visible projected energy, whether plasma or other
heated weapon isn't quite the same as a weapon that literally does not have a blade until activated
all concepts had to start somewhere
what would be an option for it?
https://twitter.com/giantrobotfm/status/1537577490444591104

if this quote is real I think that basically confirms that the original creative staff did know about star wars and therefore beam sabers can be considered a copy of lightsabers?
this one just sounds like a less gay version of working overtime to destroy the world
definitely wouldn't call it bad but it's not just "hey cute animal girls"
oh yeah that was a thing
one that stands out in my mind is shark girl who's super dependent on her bf because she can't swim in normal towns and they end up fighting over it
it was slice of life but also there was a bunch of stuff about like racial inequality because of different access needs
what
virgin road
there was one but he's dead and his corpse's also gone so he can't be zombie'd
<:GunSol:593440201427255315>
yes, because why wouldn't she choose the gay
hey it's not a cliffhanger on someone's death just on "what the fuck is going on with this power?"
damn you looseboy with these cliffhangers on monthly releases!
||... unless she *does* think it's actual timetravel, that focus has her unintentionally controlling the dream, and she's about to get thrown off when saeki doesn't respond like she expects||
||yeah it kinda throws holes in *all* theories except that nana knows what's going on||
||lucid dream also possibly makes more sense for kyoya saying the same things and the car coming at the same time?||
||assuming it's a dream sequence? My thought was that it's a shared dream, she triggers it from a memory of the day to replay events with the twists she needs. Nana goes along with it because she thinks it's real and is focussed on other possibilities, but if she realises then she can make it lucid also.||

||could be that's made easier if she's emotionally off-balance though, yeah||
||nana clearly seems to know what's going on so either she has control of the dream or she fucked with the clock. those are the two options in my mind. It's a fucking twist if this is the first time we have an accurate titular power though||
<:catbrain:847879295996919888>
would it tempt you if I mentioned this chapter had ||Nana trying to work out if she had a way to save Michiru||
<:NanaStab:782843427955146752>
coward
||but if it is actual timetravel I stand by previous statements that that's super powerful even with these limits and saeki's dumb if she thought it wasn't very useful||
||... if it is actual time travel, and it has to happen on the new day, presumably this resets on the new day and so nana set the clock back, she wasn't awake to do it before nana got up but assumed she did it half-asleep, but so long as they do another reset before midnight they can *actually* save sorano on Nana's terms? Maybe?||
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
||it kinda pokes holes in that theory though so it *could* be that for a twist this *is* time powers - but then why is it august 2nd? Unless her powers somehow interact with the clock and so nana fucking with it before she woke up got her to not do it? But then why do that on *this* day if you think it is legit time travel, why not loop again and try save her?||
||unless it's that nana's figured that out and is now making this a lucid dream to fuck with saeki?||
||I could've possibly fit the sharpie with the dream theory until the august 2nd part but wtf is happening||
???????????? ||it's fucking sharpie? and the fuck is nana on about?||
these characters really need to just kith already
mange lol
oh so Ash is actually gonna read this one huh
supposed to be weekly updates at least and simulpub
<:hibiki_chibi_wise_nod:751945928163983440>
hope it turns gay
not quite
with that more-or-less done though I've found https://mangadex.org/title/141609b6-cf86-4266-904c-6648f389cdc9/ruri-dragon as a new release and it seems like it might be fun. Not much indication where the tone's going so far but interesting enough

<:momoGun:692153314024095864>
did they run out of stolen marvel heroes
correct it?
ok "I don't know which one is love!" is getting fun because finally all the girls are meeting each other and at least some are jealous
just from the first strums it sounds familiar but I would not guess cgdct other than zls

mid 2000s was the most jank time for anime
is that kase san
lol font
lotta people go pop in that one
and for when you finish that episode ||you sure about that?||
90s and 10s best. 20s still need to prove themselves and too much of 80s hasn't aged well
mid 2000 was the jankest anime

doesn't victory have a big advantage of it being a mass produced suit so they don't have to justify why they can repair it super fast?
i feel like illindus having read the manga still gives her the ability to say that
very helpful <a:NekoLaugh:650573534602723338>
(a friend is asking because she's thinking about reading)
also while I have you do you remember how different nana manga is to anime
<@297542051057238017>  v3 isn't scanlated but it is officially translated

<@171395487247630336> you'll want to grab vol 3 at the same time as vol 2 (3 is the ending and you won't want to wait after 2)
10/10
finished Strawberry Fields Once Again
I hope there's also a RX-93v2
but that wasn't very far as far as isekai goes
the dragon egg one didn't as far as I read
I don't think either of them are the original spider MC but also ||no||
the Zero Zero gundam
post-post-post-(post-post?)+-apocalypse is very interesting vibes and despite being so slow just one or two episodes gives a lot to take in
just normal potatoes

*coolest post-virtue heavyweight unit*
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
this part is why even though I immediately want to hate it seeing the other aspects and source I kinda can't
also the GN bazooka's back
*it's dumb af in space too guys*
that's cool af wat
doesn't appear on the wiki
the wiki says one in the back and one in the shield, I must've misread something because I thought they were both in the chest but had been built as a permanent twin unit
hm the wiki describes aspects I had missed I thought they were just always together, but apparently they are separate units
I thought quan[t] was using the same two drives but disassembled down to their cores and rebuilt as a single twinned unit
you then probably need to spend decades there getting the manufacturing set up to produce more TD blankets and mass producing those to get enough true GN drives that probability means *some* of them should be compatible
since you can't mass produce the GN drives anyway and that was the result of them trying for ages to get *any* of them to sync up
though it's not as powerful
twin drives did actually make it into a GN tau suit
sometimes a prototype can outperform mass production but it's always with compromises
yes, and when it's an option she'd probably want that
I mean if she's complaining about a PG she'd probably demand MGEX
<a:KaguyaLaugh:650821987270393896>
quite the shitpost
are those like more complete equivalents of the 00s2 trailer or something
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
and with how few those are that apparently makes fictional war crimes forgiveable
a few weeks ago I was thinking about how gundam does girls so bad and I realised that I think one of the reasons I can't hate Nina Trinity is because she's one of the only gundam girls with any agency

yeah memento mori says nothing about being GNT powered so it is a different design
looked this up and it's not memento mori (I think?) but I think it is an A-Laws addition because it's powered by disposable GNTs that get burnt out after each shot
SEED was lighthearted? Or just relative to gundam?
I remember a quote about this is meant to be a gundam appealing to a new generation so cross your fingers the generation they're looking for is the isekai generation that wants fun escapism
but if they want to do "their version of gundam" they might fall in it anyway
at the very least it doesn't sound like any of the staff are raising red flags about it?
almost all of them
fuuuuck I want a kit of the raphael dominion now
since I doubt the original plan was for it to be a warship
since they also launched the celestial being I assumed they also fitted things like that
only question with raphael dominion: where's it's drive
it was the same laser design, no? They had two on the orbital ring to begin with
*heck yes* keep the armour going after purge
the space station was celestial being, wasn't the laser something dumb like memento mori
when it's just a boring straight romance, yep
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
no need to read more then
did the licensing issues extend to singapore also perhaps?
Spriggan manages to do CG well at least. there's aliasing on the compositing but you have to look close for it, it's super well matched
remote weaponry OP
but their panties are not necessary (but possible!)
stripping also includes removing hair bows if they have them
akiba's trip has taught me the secret is that they're all actually vampires who will shrivel up if you strip them down to their panties
I don't know what vibe I'm meant to get from this between the title and the visual
Girl's Last Tour
v good
GLT ep 10 is necessary after ep 9
but ash, more muscle princess
anime, and it looks like anime is just over half the content
*so* close to a 10/10, but I feel like having such clear answers at the end kinda let down the mood it had been building up
finished GLT
wait until they get to date a LIV
<:Akari_shocked:916687828245676095>
ah yes the hibiki school of martial arts
nukes just have to detonate before the countermeasures do to win
ultimately space warfare is likely to all come down to high velocity missiles and *maybe* some lasers depending on how accurate they can be made
space missiles would likely all be nuclear-but-with-small-warhead, which would mean they don't have to get that close and just one missile detonating early could destroy a *lot* of countermeasures to let the rest through
cruise missiles are slower at all times pretty much, just much more inevitable
so just by making it clear those are all things and how they interact it's already succeeded more here
but to be clear about how little I followed watching the original: wherever I got to, they'd definitely completed the test, but I did not remember anything about dust or weiss being a company heiress or non-humans (other than the Bad Guys™️) even being in the setting
it's weird that they're explaining aura when that feels like the one thing that should be intuitively obvious if you've seen any kind of fantasy
I found it easier to understand than the one time I tried to watch the original and got maybe 2 seasons in? moving onto the next step of plots when they were actually still relevant made it way easier to follow
they're probably planning to diverge so just want to establish the charcters and relationships to get into the plot they actually want to tell
there *could* be roles for kinetics or non-laser "beam" weapons ex. as hidden weapons if boarding actions were ever a thing, but the main mode of open combat wouldn't really ever support them
may overlap with missiles though, just slower ones that try sneak ahead
That could be viable when the situation calls for it, I was just thinking when a military ship has a target to engage
so what's it supposed to do when it *is* the plasma
depends on how that's supposed to work
with realistic space combat where things actually occur at range, pretty much the only viable combat styles are all lasers, if they're accurate enough and you have reactors to power them, or nuclear missiles if not, because the range provided by guidance completely dominates anything pure kinetics could do
and therefore no longer act as armour
nuclear explosives have enough energy in the flash that armour nearby will be evaporated into plasma
that's regular explosives
even just a near miss, so long as the target is a significant fraction of the sky around the detonation it's going to eat a *lot* of energy
less effective, but they're still thousands of times more effective than conventional explosive even at the low yields
nukes wouldn't be doing either, they'd be melting the armour from the sheer energy delivery
and for that it's also more efficient to have lots of small flashes because then there's time for the plasma'd armour to dissipate instead of it all going into a thin layer
the fireball is all from atmosphere, what you have is the flash
but realistically you wouldn't because single target is easily countered. You'd throw a mess of sub-kt weapons
if you were throwing like, singular megaton-range weapons then you would want to target a fleet with them
started adding everything I have on mangadex to anilist and it's gonna be interesting to see the change when stats update
I like how it still attempts to give bar heights
score is inversely proportional to length
this is the funniest graph on the anilist stats
2011 mountain

... fucking aquors isekai?
if you think 3 volumes is needed to set up the story oh boy are you not ready for the pace of strawberry fields once again
but is it gay
she must've found the gayest college in japan
I don't know which one is love
<:hibiki_chibi_wise_nod:751945928163983440>
hot tho
how you gonna have verboten love if the school's fine with everything
I am watching it but extremely behind
it was gay enough for me to give it the "you tried" sticker
||I'm pretty sure they were saying that it wouldn't solve the difficulty of living? And it was 100% legit to me that when everyone needs to go back to a rural farming lifestyle there isn't really time for these needless fights||
also gay, that part's important
eeeh I didn't feel like it was but w/e. It's like an 8, maybe 8.5 for me - don't remember exactly what but it was decent
that part was also a concept I liked, kind of a modern take on Pern
while it wasn't super strong I didn't feel like it was a forced happy ending. Lotta people still died and they then have to struggle on ||without the literal magic keeping the planet alive||
first season is more polished than the second, but I think they actually pulled out more improvement for the second
Vivy disappointed me in its last episodes but it was like a "this could've had so much more weight" disappointment rather than "ok you just ruined this"
expecting 90s anime to have good commentary on gender roles?
||I'm pretty sure they had the air energy before they were just interested in the crystals because it was so much denser. And while it's definitely an allegory for nuclear disarmament, I'm 100% that until the reveal that it's all technology and it's all actually finite energy it's meant to have the aesthetic of magic, limitless energy with literally no downsides - not just invisible ones like nuclear, literally none||
there's definitely characters I'd call gay but not ones that run through the whole plotline
if you squint
that's very much magitech aesthetic
"it's in the air all around us" is much less of a sci-fi trope though
it's used as magic. Magic crystals is itself a trope - you're pretty much meant to interpret it as magitech until the reveal
I'm using that as a stand-in because it's functionally magic and I don't recall what they call it
I won't say it wasn't a little rushed because what anime isn't these days, but I definitely came off with a different feeling to what you did
||at the shutdown point the invaders were like 1000 miles behind enemy lines and with no non-magical weapons, and everyone needs food. The army morale's going to collapse like, immediately, with half of them running back and the other half surrendering and volunteering to help with food||
||That's really not where I felt the focus was - "there could still be fighting" from its first mention felt more like it was a hypothetical for the future, and prioritising recovery, particularly since *no-one has older weapons to use* would mean the immediate conflict would end. Talking about struggling and life being difficult was about learning to live without magic||
... how not to summon a demon lord? Really?
I've heard of it before but eeeeh
~~the western ones are korean anyway~~
is kunoichi tsubaki original?
estab-life
all sources of that image are 2020
heck even the *anime* is older
maple is older than 2020
does it bring gay tho
which is?
I'd rather it was more in-tone with the rest where they're not quite sure exactly how ended the world is, but constantly seeing less and less evidence of there being anything
yeah but it's not the inconclusiveness that I disliked - I actually felt it was *too* conclusive with ||the mushrooms stating outright the state of (most of) the world||
the ending didn't quite land for me because of how different and explicit the tone was for that like, half-episode, but that was excellent throughout the rest
the bits of headspace 86 chose to do were excellent, but it did cut the *vast* majority either outright or in favour of symbolism/character reaction rather than introspection
or even webcomic, since that's a distinct format from manga with its own capabilities
while in raw number WN and LN is definitely going to produce more crap, it's equally more likely to produce actually good ideas by sheer number - although limited to the novel format, and not taking advantage of what either manga or anime could offer
idk about mars but there's strike witches idols coming up and apparently isekai idols next year?
if you want all originals, watch <generic seasonal idol show>!
<:OgawaRead:688429716507721770>
gay?
ash the only one of those I've not seen is circlet princess
school-live has definitely had a lot of people seen it, I've seen grimoire of zero and I'm pretty sure someone else here has
ah I forgot they were sisters
which one's the sister?
new ship?
neeeeerd
no a wakening of the trailblazer?
it is. wake up.
*set as planning*
eh, most of the time
oh that is on my list then I believe
what is that? I don't recognise it
I've seen a lot of discussion on this including people saying that ||he wasn't actually in the reginleif at the time and fido was taking him away||, but I've not rewatched to verify that theory
it's going to be rare - especially like with that house husband anime where it's totally 1:1 - but there's some truly abysmal originals too
an absolutely dreadful original versus an adaptation that keeps everything 1:1 but is well acted and animated, I'd definitely say the adaptation *can* win
WEP exists
really going all out on the advertising for a movie of an episode that was purged from canon, huh
haifuri >>>> arpeggio
and this is the first time I've seen it as "ARP" which is dumb af but I've also not seen any collabs so
I was specifically looking for not ships so no
and people don't write it EVA most of the time (and those that do capitalise the full thing also, which doesn't happen with arpeggio)
it's not an initialisation though
... why would it be ARP?
which is why I said four though I think there's actually even more probably
you're missing aoki hagane

excuse me what
> The loquacious sentient tank, Gyrano De Borgerac seems very busy being pampered by solicitous maids.
you can always do more with the right drugs
I mean if it came first I would've said that after haifuri
the closest I can think of at the moment is GLT
are vehicles actually a focus in that?
... is GuP the only thing in its girls&military subgenre?
there's at least like 5 shows for girls & guns, 4 for shipgirls, I can think of at least 3 for planegirls (4 if strike witches counts), but I can't think of any other girls & ground vehicles
or possibly not even start
I have quite a few but several will probably drop
john wick but they're also just murdering like, random pickpockets. Even before they've done anything
nah I'm saying it's more creative to write within restrictions than it is to just make shit up to not have them
I don't care about "deep twists" or w/e, it's fundamentally just divorced itself from being grounded which gives it an excuse to do almost anything and drastically takes away from the creativity involved. Haifuri sticking to basically-all-real-tech and real situation is what gives it creativity that aohagane can't match
and? those settings are a dime a dozen, especially after AI and/or alien invasion. they're just BETA with tits.

actually coming up with a realistic motivation to have realistic ship combat instead of sci-fi nonsense *without* having to resort to "oh it's a war" or "oh it's a wargame" is way more creative
haifuri's way more creative than "ok the same thing but alien AIs"
and there's *so* many war dramas so actually finding a way to be something different is more creative. war drama is the obvious solution
I enjoyed it at the time but it wasn't some revolutionary thing it was super tropey
"mysterious force as a result of climate change" is just godzilla
which is me naming one when you can't
and same with Arpeggio. it's basically strike witches
What other shows have that plot?
parasites usually get into a main host via an intermediate like rats
you do know those kinds of parasites actually exist right
~~or just use gas core, nuclear lightbulbs totally aren't dangerous~~
wouldn't *really* be likely to get that kind of manoeuvrability out of it with proper radiation shielding but that's where ～imagination～ comes in
I mean it would technically work you could in principle use the same core in a nuclear thermal rocket and thermal jet
~~good luck fitting transformation into that~~
that is extremely smol scale
I prefer the VF-31 even if I'm not memeing on actual flight mechanics too, but using the VF-25 as a stand-in for the VF-1 was a good touch
both don't have enough pitch authority but at least delta's has some
"the fact you can see him means you're a witch also" headcanon: all the previous series have been made by not-witches so you couldn't see them
and they're monopolising all the pants
ah I see this is going to be 100% straight yes
or is this a one off for the first ep and not going to be regular?
super early
oh it's already out?
well this is gonna cause some fun drama, full cg remake
ash there have already been a bunch
ah here we go japanese amazing grace
weird alien(?) invaders that have taken over europe in lieu of nazis and you have to kill them by shooting their core
much less traumatic than losing a childhood friend *and* your magic at the same time
except there you keep the familiar they just don't change
yep
hence the child soldiers
at around 20, yes, mel
you'd think that would be kind of a traumatic thing to lose basically a lifelong pet
do they lose their familiars when they lose their magic?
sure we can!

it's funny to imagine everyone else wondering what's going on with these three girls causing chaos for apparently no reason

possibly not? since it acknowledges way more countries in general than most anime (which acknowledge 1, maybe 2). Pretty sure it's only the second to acknowledge finland (maybe first if it was in strike witches and therefore beat GuP)
friend thinks she's a guy so is totally into her, no reaction to trying to make it clear, after 13 episodes of hijinks it turns out she always knew and that was the point
"decent"
glad I saw none of them
~~and then end with them having the white sands marriage package~~
second half needed to cut out like half of the early parts to progress faster, the ending should've been like halfway through
it was but it so badly wanted to be more
even if okinawa aquarium lesbians failed to live up
also I see what looks like both aquarium and new years' dates in that trailer
I'm gonna interpret "the two's story begins" as gay af tho no matter how far the anime fails to go
it does though it's not clear exactly how gay yet
just regular 700, the Ns have a dividing ridge up the centreline
luck isn't actually real so there's a limit to how believable unlucky can be for narrative purposes
finished first ep of Teppen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! after I got interrupted yesterday ... why is one of them just an actual alien?
they pretty much even both know they're super well suited for each other
I still say best (straight) romcom is lovecom and literally the only gimmick is the two are already clearly perfect for each other but because he's short and she's a giant and they want a more stereotypically ideal romance they're both against it
you think they'd actually do something as english-accurate as manifest destiny rather than dumb like infinite destiny?
would be better with it tho
for movie/no movie timelines
I think really it's more like 50/50 at lowest
does trailblazer not count?
oh shit it's actually the original animator too?
ok whoever the fuck you are you're just taking the piss here
not that musk would ever approve of such a fabulous colour
... is this meant to be the tesla truck?
yet still works at the power plant
*exactly* the same
they've at least updated the tech here but the characters feel *exactly* the same, even down to the tropey episode progression
yeah it does feel very old from the start, so I guess it'll depend whether it starts to differentiate itself or just get lazier
ok that is a very good use of modern animation with classic style
it looks it all the VAs are total newbies?
I just went and checked that new TMM isn't using the original VAs 'cause it immediately sounds like its era but with modern recording quality

but then it just didn't actually engage with the question
no I mean it did pretend to be asking that
it pretended to ask that but then just didn't
"oh you don't want to be overtaken? too bad"
there were allusions to that but they were super boring about it because they just auto-win anything
also like I can kinda forgive lycoreco for the rubber bullets thing because it's clearly actually gonna lead somewhere with *why* she does that but they're not actually non-lethal nor are they that effective so something that's clearly *not* taking it anywhere I'm not going to give a pass on that
do you understand why we're dunking on it now

yeah it's not really that you use taiga over anilist, it's that you're using anilist but not
here
so I can now tell where I was on mangadex, on dynasty
detects what you're reading on just about any site, if it can find an anilist match it'll start updating that (on more obscure stuff you might want to check what it matches sometimes its guesses miss), otherwise it'll save the progress locally and if it recognises the name on another site it'll highlight how far you got
this plugin is why you may have noticed an explosion of manga on my anilist recently
works on mdex, dynasty and mangaplus at least

can see it here
having just watched the prologue (in really low quality), those bits also form the wing/booster pack
at least until someone leaks it, anyway
site said something about being able to watch prologue online but it looks like for now it's only for people who get tickets at the in-person events?

(actual spoiler for prologue events) ||4 kills on her 4th birthday||
either way definitely a new record in the prologue :p
at least we have ||a new record for youngest gundam pilot||, I think
but if it's always then like, what are you gonna do when you want to make the scene stand out
I like oversaturation when it's meant to be flashy (ex. symphogear's fight scenes)
also why is every single window lit up
if it's meant to be a surreal otherworld then not matching could be appropriate but at least the feet should be composited. But I'm assuming this is just meant to be regular night not some pocket dimension
is call of the night gay tho

if you had this view in SW you would *definitely* be seeing pantsu
how am I ever supposed to believe this is the same world as strike witches if I can't see any pantsu
there are too many skirts in luminous witches
and as I said, clearly having feelings is not a requirement to have harem elements. it's thematics and character dynamics that define it and in those regards it is much more qualified than particularly a lot of shoujo romance
that's like his biggest character trait that despite being totally unaware loads of these girls would be interested in him before he was taken
it really is tho
that's the most important point
Almost all of the girls would be immediately going after him if he wasn't married
because it does have harem elements
and part of that comic relief *is* "if only he wasn't already taken"
regardless of what level that like realistically is
the important thing is filling the guy fantasy of getting surrounded by girls who like you
it doesn't need to be a realistic possibility to be a harem. In fact I'd not even suggest that's important at all
whereas there's stuff like lovecom where it's just not even mildly thought of as a possibility
I'm not saying it is a full on harem, but it does still have that point of appeal in it
just because they're not having the comedy fall-on-his-dick tropes doesn't mean they're not still interested
MC, FC, three in the bathhouse family at least a couple of which are somewhat interested in him, and two in the mansion family, just from what I remember being in the anime
there are definitely less harem anime, even if you restrict to the romance genre
I'd argue it's still notably above non-zero as it's very clearly one of its selling points that there's several girls into him, even if the result is already decided
those are very different examples for revival
linus' stuff is generally pretty solid these days, just doesn't have nearly 100% coverage. GN can be a little more thorough but they also cover a lot less
24 hour news, and especially the internet, caused that to collapse
actually listened to a good podcast about the collapse of journalism, it was pretty much all being paid for by newspaper sales, because even though it's cheap they're produced cheaper and almost *everyone* bought them, so they could pay good wages for good journalism
clickbait turns out to be a good strategy to pay for good investigation, because that doesn't pay for itself
the question is technically open ended as it never asks "is this a harem show?" people could interpret that as "is the main character group a harem"
shounen romance in contrast to shoujo very rarely has only a single interest
the question is literally asking where people draw the line
I mean that's often the case, there's a *lot* of shoujo romance where there's only ever either one love interest or a second one is introduced *only* to spur on the main and they're irrelevant as soon as that's happened
hibimikine onli
dore ga koi ka ga wakaranai
'cause he really likes triangles
... guess that depends if two is enough for a harem for you
I'd put eva in the first one but it plays against harem tropes so it fails the last two
it depends whether the question is "does this have a harem", "does this have harem aspects" or "is this just a harem"

I want an anime subtitled in *only* TL notes. Subs are just the original japanese and the screen's filled with notes explaining what it means
precisely nothing in that teaser made it stand out as something interesting

... why do the subs just randomly disappear for part of the newest TMMN?
looks like there are only 3 then but they're also quite popular so
huh I thought 300 slimes was a funa series
inori's not had anything yet tho
it feels like funa's caught on enough that most-all of it's gonna get adapted
<:FredAngy:976837831328686100>
where's iftv
and just finished gwitch prologue with subs, that's actually a really interesting start now that I can actually understand it all. Hopefully the actual thing doesn't throw it away
animation and hair styles have changed more in a direction that suits it better than most 80s and 90s hairstyles did
ok there is interesting stuff in gwitch prologue I hadn't picked up on in raw
this kind of hair is more common if you move back to before the 00s
if that's the case then there's definitely some stuff with similar ideas like this but there's not a lot of characters with a clean enough art style to do a cleanly separated inside/outside colour difference
like what, exactly?
for those who were waiting, nyaa has an english fansub for G Witch Prologue
if the ED one hasn't posted 00's gay haircut then it's a fraud
I mean ||a 4 year old killing 3 people and calling it pretty fireworks|| isn't enough for you?

as long as AXZ is last

I was thinking of when they had them all strung up but there's that one too yes
the biggest one that doesn't need translation being the flags of all countries being 50% japanese flag when it's supposedly an international location
in prima doll too
shes fuckin everywhere
chainsawman i assume
the greater context of usage of german in anime *is* nazi germany. Japan came to like german and germany specifically because of WW2 and them being allies, because troops were (obviously) treated better by the allied germans than american or british/dominion troops who either defeated or were defeated by them. The association isn't super direct these days but we're talking quite a long time ago now, Anno would definitely be old enough to have some awareness of this being why, and it is *the* ultimate reason

I'd say the article is a bit off here in the interpretation of subtitle names, because that's not likely to have been given significant thought by any writer or director on-project, it's more likely an innocent mistake, but it's very much incorrect to say that in the 80s or earlier German appearances aren't significantly related to the WW2 connection
which is really just part of it. The bad translations tend to be ones where CR weren't given the option to translate, it was provided by the license holder
symphogear is translated by MAGES, not CR
from what I've heard crunchyroll translators actually tend to do a better job than typical. But it's rarely crunchyroll translating
oooh fusoroi no renri
is a clever show
watching this I just kept having to go "this is a *high grade*?" Like, it's definitely not quite MG or RG level, but it's so far beyond what you'd usually see for HG ...
no give asumi chan
tag <@171395487247630336> for this one too
pokemon isekai?
while IFTV is like "claire hot" (correctly)
yeah but it is still about her having otherworld adventures getting to develop magic and stuff
the main thing I can think of that would mean magirevo before IFTV would be that magirevo is probably a *little* easier sell plot-wise since it has the typical isekai "let's use a cheat skill to break the other world" while IFTV is more focussed on the romance aspect from the start
it's not far off at least
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
and yet not IFTV#
well, even aside from this guy, if you add it up:
the "what do you want animated next" survey results are being announced soon
this is a secret announcement that can't just be openly explained already
magirevo already has both LN and manga
<:MichiruConcern:807012058183761961>
leakers don't tend to talk about where it's coming from in order to not lose their sources so the evidence is just how often they've been right in the past
https://twitter.com/inori_narou/status/1557934237096898562 even inori's excited about magirevo anime
it's not a super hype trailer like say swordsekai but it's also not meant to be
winter might be pushing it but spring has a chance
I would say if there's a trailer already  and it's not just stills, probably early 2023
starting with a trailer instead of just a visual, hopefully not too long away then
and finally ash can't argue it's not gay

newest usotsukisan chapter: ||big F||
9 has a pun with the japanese for baseball which is probably why there's multiple

since macross is always following the trends though that shitpost could really happen which is why I'm gonna find it so funny. It is actually the 5th TV show IIRC, so V fits, vtubers are big right now, so it leans into that trend
iirc that one's more like proto hatsune miku?
I'm gonna laugh so hard if that shitpost turns out right
there's no part of cour 1 that feels off in pacing like they had to juggle around to make it fit, it all looks and flows great, the recap just seems to be there to fill time
also the recap episode of 86 cour 1 very much feels like "we wrote it out fully and hit 11 episodes and didn't want to fudge around to try stretch it, the broadcasters couldn't find anything to fill that slot with so just asked us to do a recap"
Next: Macross V, it's all V-tubers but they also bring delta back by using it upside down as a tie in

probably
fair enough. There's definitely errors throughout but I swear it's nothing egregious until the last half of part 2
did jennifer do the last few eps of 86 'cause I'm pretty sure it was mostly fine until stuff like zero-point-score -> point-blank shot
hibimiku
most weren't
a few were
the ones that do any fan stuff I'd imagine do manga since stuff goes untranslated there and you don't have to manage timing or such
and by being the official tls they get it ahead and so can be *the* one that gets used
some pay is more than none
all the translation businesses that pay properly can make up for it
vertical integration
that;s why you acquire it
I mean they do pay for the licenses and keep western interest up - they are technically supporting the industry, they'd just be replaced by anyone else to step up, and individual subs are meaningless
I mean the ideal without removing capitalism would be most things are on most services but there's differences in ex. quality, but that'll never happen because it's way easier to convince people to multisub than it is to try compete on the cost-benefit
if only it were gay it might even be 10/10
not quite a 10/10 but def worth watching
good movie
and you don't see that in the discord preview
ah I wasn't sure if that was the official account
... 17:30 what timezone? JST?
usually no but Try came out so soon after fighters that I'd call that a 4 cour anyway, it was clearly planned from the start
oh I guess re:0096 is only two but I imagine they were really stretching that
the bigger question is if we've gotten any mainline gundam that's less than 4
it is somewhat disconnected with a large timeskip to the main series if that affects the decision
fair enough
why would you not?

unsinkable II
though if aerith plays well into its potential that might become my favourite hero suit
exia still 10/10 suit
that's going to go easier when they actually use an english word in it though
I just call it IBO
I didn't touch it after the split cour the first was so bad
I wish I didn't
Prologue at least appears to be all-handdrawn and all high quality, so hopefully witch sticks with that
which is reasonably accurate with subsonic ammo
most of the versions that were being distributed were from bilibili so had chinese censorship of the blood
and gay
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
since they already blew up a colony in prologue I think it'll take longer
not the kind of OP I expected but it could work
~~I mean he's a guy so I'm uninterested even before he looks dumb~~
also, kinda cool there's gonna be new (transforming?) kits, but 1/100 is a pretty small scale for macross ...
those also deal with an IRL system that only has single letters normally so a deviation is to be expected
if index anime good why was it so boring even before the part ln readers say was badly done
1/100 gunpla are a *big* difference compared to 1/144. literally 50% taller - that comparison's like a head taller when it's 8 tall
I have 1/72 kits and they're not as big as 1/100 gunpla
they might be about 16m long in plane mode but they're not going to end up as tall since so many parts become horizontal in the transformation
a 1/100 valk will optimistically  be about the size of an RG
which is why it took so long
both translation sites though are quality checked human TL
I think I saw something about it being picked up recently but I don't believe there's official TL anywhere yet
F/A-18 does though and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_YF-17
and unless you can find a yea-6 that doesn't really provide a relevant example
"normally"
does this therefore imply that shinkalion is the same universe as eva, and everything's going mostly fine in tokyo 1 while tokyo 3 is getting destroyed by nth impact?

ok yeah turning into lelouch is pretty cringe
and with such an isekai title
why not
possibly. Title is "These 4 are lying about various things" because they're all trying to have normal school life while one's an alien and another's a ninja etc
~~ash doesn't like being called out~~
yes
I wouldn't expect quite the same kind of story as that
she's got some very unusual ones for sawano's style though

I don't know if sennarin always works with sawano?

let's find out what this assassination plot was like
lycoris time and wtf they finally aired ep 2 of teppen
elf was in party that saved the world from demon lord, because so long-lived didn't really pay attention to day-to-day stuff, hero of the party dies and story is her learning to engage more (also going on a journey but idk if I'd count why as spoilers)
so someone picked up this tl again but they're not very good, sadly. At least they've got good raws and their fonts have some variety but that's about all I can say

anime when
when she went ||"can't be helped, gotta check"|| I was expecting more of like, a magic analysis of whether ||she's the demon king||, not *that*
there are parts where it picks up more but it's still slow and focussed on this character development
at least as far as I read
and no I wouldn't agree with that criticism
ah right that wasn't a very clear phrasing to read
that's not what I said at all?
which?
I mean I don't know how the execution is exactly mid when the whole point is it's executing a very melancholic concept. It shouldn't be bombastic, it shouldn't be gut-wrenching - it should be slow and thoughtful
k-on + social anxiety
lookin forward to this one
from prices I'm used to probably $99 with shipping
tmmn

no failing upwards here
it's the fact he didn't have everything go his way, despite everything being in his favour, because he himself is such a dumbass
it's a shitpost of what most otaku would actually be like if isekai'd
making 2 cours out of 1
and acts it
he looks it
and have an old man approaching you like that?

10/10
Ayahi makes good cat noises
appropriate response to being jumped in America
lost count of how many "what the f" moments there were
tweet deleted
||Chisato's still using the nonlethal ammo though, hard to end it like that||
clearly
wtf the original proposal for lycoreco was done by the guy who wrote akibastrip?
tallgeese stands up?
probably want a bit of time to make the finale big and bombastic
90s stuff was slooow so 2 cour to update 4+1? isn't unreasonable
so split cour with 2 cour skip. Is this likely to finish the story?
I didn't finish it
she's basically dendrobium
ok so how is she getting even more OP this time
<@297542051057238017> talentless nana ||yoooo finally kyoya backstory and it doesn't feel like misdirection||
||though now I'm confused because we still know *nothing* about nana's brother other than the tiny mention that he's off in a shrine somewhere?||
https://youtu.be/HSVAYNZTIio youtube recommended me this "indie" anime (though it has way more people involved than Vapour Trail did)
<a:pattato:805360619091787777>
... it's wednesday, though?

<:KurumiSmug:1014332062053957662>
||goin the same way as michiru||
big F
a gremlin
||it is but I went with inu~~gami~~kai because I couldn't remember that one||
<a:NekoLaugh:650573534602723338>
||... ok it's clearly been too long since she last appeared that you didn't correct me that her name's inukai, not inugami||
||and speaking of, stupid thought: what if nanao's her brother and their parents had *the worst* naming sense||
||the next tier of nanao's talent||
and we still don't know ||her or nana's talents, which I'm assuming they have given rin got quite old while apparently not knowing hers when it's quite significant||
right
... wait am I just being stupid and forgetting, where is ||moe|| right now
but yeah this is a ride that ain't stopping
it better involve nanax||inugami|| <:ManonStare:979742093742325800>
looseboy: lemme just answer like one and a half mysteries ... and make like 7 more complicated and introduce a couple new ones :)
||even more confirmation||
||wait fuck, congenital heart disease that isn't affecting her right now||
||so new knowledge:
rin = jin = kyoyasister
talent medicines they're probably harvesting everyone in the jail for
they have inugami's body and possibly could have revived her with the medicine
rin looked a lot like nana as babby
my personal gripe: nana clearly said she had an older brother who was talented, and off in some buddhist shrone, and kyoya's *literally called Onodera*, https://jisho.org/search/%E5%B0%8F%E9%87%8E%E5%AF%BA%20%23kanji so what the fuck is that plot thread now||
||yeah that's true, he was always shown as kinda older but I was assuming like 18, not already halfway through uni in a flashback. He's gotta be at least like 25 now right?||
||but also oh no what is he doing to her||
||oh yeah my big "she's not actually dead" theory's all coming together||
||also hold the fucking phone you can make medicines of someone's talent from their cells? And he had inugami's body?||
||I mean maybe? But the backstory described here which is ambiguously either rin or kyoya's perspective doesn't align with what Nana knew, and in more major ways than she misremembered||
eeeh I'm pretty sure the west insists that more
JP?
the one where the episode ends with ||touching in private when taki's listening to her not-heart||
but the ||don't touch my boobs in public|| definitely had no het explanation
yeah the line you responded to was definitely about lycoreco
yep
yes
and we still don't have the finale
it's like a 6-7 if symphogear is also a 7 before XV
"Mine"
disagree symphogear is gayer for not having that conversation as it clearly marks it as "this is what's between them, not for the viewer to be involved in"
~~also if having any amount of deniability makes it bait I'm pretty sure korra doesn't count?~~
which is considerably more than 4-5 per decade
https://tenor.com/view/sakura-trick-kiss-yuri-gif-11487318
in the OP (and multiple times per episode)
(yurikuma arashi and sakura trick each are probably as gay as all those western shows put together)
I mean that's a handful of shows over literally more than a decade now, whereas you can find that many examples in anime just in a random meme
stephen universe is still more of an exception than the rule in the west
I mean until very recently I wouldn't say western animation is much better at such clear declarations and there's a *much* more vocal *much* angrier anti community in the west
so no ||"what's 2000 years of curses compared to how gay I am"|| then
so on the same level as symphogear then
symphogear, even if it was won by how gay hibimiku is, is the latter case
no I'm pretty sure this is the case in a *lot* of them. You can even see a divide: stuff like yagakimi and citrus will show it because it's *about* the relationship, but stuff where it's about something else but the relationship is of involved characters, it's kept way more private
this is an extremely western take on it that I really don't think is the case. That's definitely what disney would do if they were brave enough to acknowledge they had gays at all, japan cares much more about the emotion and relationships *in general* are considered much more private, so the approach of "give them privacy for the confession" absolutely would happen and makes more cultural sense than it being denial
going back through anime by release date, looking for stuff that's clearly canonised, TV shows only, yuri only, only stuff I know personally:
magirevo isn't out yet but the novels do clearly canonise it so we'll see
maid dragon S canonises it
ochikobore doesn't put anyone in an explicit relationship but does make it explicit at least half of the cast is 100% gay from like the first episode
yagakimi
citrus
flipflap
sakura trick

for bl, though without so much me knowing for sure since I've seen none:
sasaki to miyano
rose wars
super lovers (looks like it and I mean the fuckin title)
and a fuckload more where the cover makes it hard to believe they could be anything but would be but I don't know enough about them
I mean, I've not seen korra, but I know there's a fairly significant group that deny that's gay too so idk that I'd say the west is actually that much better about it, it's just being treated more favourably
watch it after the ep for them goofing out over the episode title
WEP fell apart well before the last ep and didn't take a clear stance of "gay is good"
that ||takina starts dating the guy from lilybell as a rebound fling||?
so those can be finished cleanly but everything else has to sacrifice to make it happen
No, because those were already in production and planned out before having to start making these adjustments
and vaguely competent management will *know* they have budget and time issues in advance and start adjusting writing to make things work
time = money
again you can be weird an artsy and actually do something visually at the same time
even monogatari isn't that cheap
you can do dense abstract introspective character analysis with an animation budget larger than a cup noodle
if the writer understands the story they're telling they can absolutely pull that kind of thing out for the conclusion
there being intent and it being a panicked "crap we need to conclude this *somehow* without spending anything" are not incompatible
maybe there was some preprod or very early production work going on for EoE, but that would just be a "we hope we'll get paid for this" and ready to drop it, until it's greenlit they don't know anything
if they had unlimited money they'd be able to find someone to pay to do something more for 25 and 26 than what there was. Making a lot of money at the initial run doesn't mean it's gonna keep printing money to justify huge expenditure to keep it going
oh wait the left is more different.
that just looks like YT screwed up the colour tones, there's no apparent addition to the blood, and greens are brighter too
run to winter comiket and abduct the best artists you can see
so you're saying the seed movie will be the best ever made
the rest weren't 9 years tho
while I've not seen any of the rebuilds the massive delay on 4 would tell me *that's* what he would do with unlimited resources
and still have it be just as surreal
because you could do *literally the entire same episode with the same dialogue* and spend more than a cup noodle on animation
if it was as intended anno would just be going "you watched through the rest of the batshit stuff I wrote deal with it"
and stuff that's already half done when budget issues hit are going to get finished
you can either have everything be meh-bad, or have a few things be great and the rest be a little bit worse. You don't have the time to keep people jumping between things and expect them to build up anything particularly good
not immediately guaranteed, they need an actual plan for one they think will actually pay off. Outdoing SxF by nearly 4x can't be bad though

||vaccum asphyxiation would be fairly mild as deaths go, total unconsciousness in under 5 seconds||
with the amount they put out they're pretty much always making multiple things at once
hard to make a scar that says ||"Whore's Daugher"|| aesthetically pleasing except by hiding it, as she does
(also has the unpleasant scar, though that's well hidden)
86 has the same scenes but they're primarily viewed from behind, or have anything that could be a suggestive outline hidden by the framing (such as seeing over another character's shoulder), which does a lot to help it
it's the correct way round if you log in and get the new UI but yeah

... crunchyroll why do you have the 00 movie placed *between* the seasons
star and planet are the same word in moonrunes <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
symphogear reference
was this one shinkai or hosoda
re:copyright strike
that would be incredibly funny
I was happy with it
why is he aiming at the head. did he learn mech fighting from gunevo
yeah, postponing suggests "oh shit no-one in that office is in to resolve it"
that was on CR's channel rather than their own channel though
wonder if they got struck by the OP or something
I'm trying to retime after the 8 min break and it's not lining up
I would guess they're using a sub track that was timed for live broadcast with ad breaks?
yeah since it's at least blended well I'll take the 3dcg over fucked up 2d
so much 3dcg is disappointing but at least aerial looks cool for it
what the fuck
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
-12.5k is off for me but -13k is spot on
and likely less reason to be worried they might try bait it
that explains a lot though if the scriptwriter wrote utena
it already got updated
there's still a lot of pieces that need to be put together well to pull a decent plot out of it
yes
so far I'm not *that* convinced it'll have that compelling of a mecha plot but I'll take it if it's half-decent and gay
they better not be cowards and try cancel it
ye they jumped in the deep end
nah just right
can't believe the first gundam to not have a guy protag is also the first to ||get gay|| in episode 1 too
if anyone else wants properly retimed subs to go with nyaa
apart from the stinger, anyway
<:catbrain:847879295996919888>
so I could keep fucking around with adjusting sub delay ooooor I could extract the sub track and do a quick and dirty edit to fix the timings properly and now everything appears to be lined up
mechanic girl is very good and I hope she gets a major role
so it's not surprising if the script is starting to go in that direction he'd go "why don't we go all-in"
it was his first writing job far as i can see
but writer wrote the utena LNs
not director
how else are you gonna establish dominance
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
also blessing the marriage
that was pretty well implied by the prologue, yes
wonder if we're gonna get an actual voice to aerial at some point
hopefully something like "ok look I'm technically tied to him but at this point I actually like you so win me back you idiot"
she's definitely not gonna win everything but with such an unashamed opening leaning fully into this marriage being cool I'm gonna hold hope that it's the endgame. Specially with the key visual
If we do have to go into a future ruled over by helperbots directing us everywhere I hope Japan's influence means they are haros irl
what was that one from
I think the launch box for mr richboy also was cg
the shot of ariel in the ship's door was definitely cg too
Spohio
also she's fine in aerial, just way too awkward outside
||Lockon, Lockon ...||
||Happy Birthday to you~||
narto
which is usually the same as ireland here unless they literally just forget to add them
"not available in your country"
and while ten's summary is generally accurate for the most part we don't know what it's about yet because we don't know where it's going. Other than the main two girls are ||engaged||
just episode 2
yeah I was about to mention that but it's probably the only real exception?
in which case you have another season to look at
probably the only way to be wrong is if it's clearly "season 2"
if you nyaa then erai-raws haven't updated but subsplease have v2
according to twitter lately IBO was gay anyway? but lategame instead of ep 1
but at least we potentially get two whole cours of good gay before that
not wrong
presumably das now gets this <a:NekoLaugh:650573534602723338>
(I don't think AD build and AD 00 should realistically be connected but)
does he not interview enough to know, or just keep to reserved in the answers
nah 0080 is understandable
~~unicorn might even be best started early before you know its conclusion is "the space nazis were right"~~
making a specific recommendation is different to saying whether something is an okay starting point if someone's already thinking about it
*something* has already hooked you to be thinking about that one
and the very premise of the question has it such that hook isn't an issue
ergo not actually a bad choice to start with, if it looks good to you
which doesn't give any context for 0079
yet it worked for you fine
ofc
the counterpoints being given are cases of "don't watch this because you're starting at the wrong point in its series or there's just an outright better version"
wing is pretty bad but from the original premise - watch what looks interesting to you - it's still a valid choice
good people on the side doesn't necessarily mean "what if the actual side is good"
I was actually just thinking about mercury and I think if it's going along well with the anti-war themes and what it's already set up it'll probably have ||Aerial give a heroic sacrifice|| towards either mid-point climax or total end
if they only were on a few specific missions in the war then it could work but that's never how it goes
that's saying so much on its own
ofc in the right circumstances a worldwide govt could corrupt that fast
and yet they were *still* super extreme
also the examples we're giving are real examples that happened, which by their nature are not going to be the most extreme version of what could possibly happen
7 years is a long time
do you remember how different things were in 2015?
and things can be acted on sooner
so communication is faster
it took hitler 6
it's not the original
*only* the original
cypher instead of looking at what the side stories are doing look at how the fed are presented *only* in the original
cypher that's 0083 doing the fed blackwashing
it's not its only writing offense with so many character writing issues - CSA, not giving any women agency, etc. - but it definitely says that the federation was wrong and denied a necessary right
suddenly everything comes around at once
wait it's also the 40th anniv of macross?
I suspect they were both labelled AD as a "you know what we can stop with the pretending it's a different world in such a silly way and start grounding the story more" but that reaction showed they can't

yes it does
crunchy's already starting on its bullshit again
I mean, death of the author, but also the author wrote the damn thing and unless their explanation just outright doesn't make sense or they're using it to push a shit agenda, they *did* write it that way
prologue and 1 ep, unless you have surprise early access one of the eps is ep 0 aka prologue
nah the first ep just has a lot of parallels that people are joking about. Watch it if you want to watch utena, but it's not needed for gwitch
I mean I think it'd be hard to get context of a show without watching the show ...
I mean, technically?
(gundam utena is mercury witch)
do you want to see gundam utena

at least the one we've seen hinted so far, might be like 00 and get a few char analogues
the char is totally her mother
100%
00 doesn't feel old
if the movie happens maybe we can also get 00 movie 2
is the movie gonna happen
in general gundam is usually good-to-bittersweet ending instead of just suffering, but it'll make the characters work for it. At least for the coherent series, a few fell apart like destiny
so there's lots of interpretations and lots of different plots in it
it's very much a franchise rather than a singular series
where the secret technique britain brings is "gun"
G gundam is martial arts tournament arc
S2 still builds towards the themes it's just bad at telling it on the way
and you could still convince someone 00 is like, 5 years old or less if they didn't know
it's 15
00 "what if the terrorists are the good guys"
00 good
well idk what other aspects you'd want
(setsunaxtieria tho)
even the MLM is generally just shipping
none others with clear yuri
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
cheat mode: only watch the good stuff
him being annoying is the point
basically no gundams *aren't* 50-52 episodes total and since 00 they've all done it in two seasons, witch is the first to break it up more IIRC
25-6
taking the 00 approach of "gundam uses the gundam technology"
"game"
is she wrong
well most people seem to just complain about destiny so
I mean that tracks with what Millhi's been saying
the two that have been announced would be the first half if it's following typical pattern
a cour is 12-13 episodes
given how gundam has always consistently held to 4 cours I was honestly expecting it to already be planned for 4. Maybe they're planning to write a half-ending like 00 though where if it does absolutely crap they could just cut it off, but from how the kits are selling I doubt that's going to happen
... so this isn't a metaphorical war they're literally shooting each other?
it only makes any sense as "we wanted to end on their first fight together and then realised we had to pad out the ep"
yeah first ep sucks bad
*and this is fucking PA works*?

unlikely to be the primary cause, but it is a relevant thought
he *was* getting death threats though, so again, not an insane interpretation
not an insane interpretation
that berserk mode certainly is an interesting addition without having to do anything like "gm forces you to endanger side characters by arbitrary means"
quite the contrast in pace for only 3 years apart
I remember thinking that cross rays was cutting 00 *season 1* short by only having like 11-12 fights
episode 3 and we're still on the opening conflict
rewatching SEED to try actually remember what happens this time, and *god* it takes its time getting started
question though: did she exchange contact details with the band?
I doubt it'll be a 10/10 or anything but bocchi does seem like it'll be a fun SoL
welp it's clearly too late for her
yeah I figured they'd save that twist for the last one at the very least

chris?
so all the zaft coordinators are real fuckin dicks even to each other, huh

so flay's whole arc is her being spacist

||plus the op/ed||
||she had a perfect opportunity to walk away after it was forcibly cut off and she threw herself at her wife||
I think I preferred bocchi
the editing of him breaking (and it clearly being some kind of seed for that reused cut) interspersed with her in bed being like "yes go crazy and kill them all!" definitely made it feel that way though
did not know that and if so then it's fairer to not make the joke
it's funny to just call coordinators newtypes tho
so is it supposed to be that she fucked him into awakening his newtype potential?
yes

trainsekai?
only in reference to it getting wrecked but the recycling is amusing
oh huh ptolemaios appears as a ship name in seed
the only one that looks even at all entertaining is the mimicsekai one
Bocchi needs a hug
good episode
I didn't notice much in the chat but I also didn't look for long before maximising it
like when narration is needed it's still from sword's perspective, but fran is definitely centre stage instead
by ep 3 I'm not sure it is. Kinda feels like in the original WN (I'm assuming it started there) the writer had this dumb idea but then realised this was a better focus and shifted
which is pretty dumb but if you're past the first episode I'd say it's a fine show, fun to watch, first ep was way too dragged out
by the second episode that appears to be true anyway as there's no reference to previous life stuff
||tbf the way she said it it seems like it's a very long list||
(g-witch)
||the smallest one, but technically yes||
bocchi the rock. I think I like it better than hitoribocchi so far

there's a handful that just sorta handwave artifical gravity though
pretty much every gundam acknowledges zero-g and animates appropriately
she's probably not figured out that miorine's being tsun and would be up for it
(LOGH:DNT) ||so things continue to get more complicated, fezzan is seeing & ready for the fall of the alliance, reinhart is super sus of fezzan, Hilde is considering how to move against Oberstein, and Reuenthal has admitted he's not entirely on reinhart's side any more||
yes, very silly (sorezore uso)
This scene also reinforces my thought that ||when war gets going guel's gonna betray and join suletta's side||
sorezore uso is very silly
we know miorine will win regardless <:hibiki_chibi_wise_nod:751945928163983440>
||I mean it's hardly a mystery to anyone who picked up on the tempest references||
I think trying to explain that with a non-expert's knowledge without boring the vast majority of viewers would be an absolutely terrible idea and is also somewhat self-explanatory to people who would actually understand it anyway; you want magic to do things according to certain rules, that therefore means logical structures are required
yeet
the new replacement for mayonnaise
except you don't have to make them remember because you don't have to make that the driving aspect. The sword is already being driven by very sword-like goals ("gain a wielder and help them"), just make them not mind not remembering so long as they can fulfill the purpose they were made for
to make swordsekai not isekai what I'd do is just make him the original consciousness of the legendary sword, but forgotten everything because of running out of power and has just regained enough to re-awaken. That lets you set up the exact same opening
hence earlier commentary that the isekai aspect doesn't matter
in swordsekai, unless things change later, it falls into neither because the sword causes problems for the world with powers they gain *from the world*, not things they brought through
the isekai setting either matters because they're unfamiliar with the world and that causes problems for them, or because the world's not familiar with what they bring and they cause problems for the world
if he wasn't isekai'd he wouldn't be hitting the rewinds the same way since he'd be familiar with the world
ernie can justify everything because he's seen it before
which you could skip the latter part, but when *everything* has to then lean on "because it's cool" with no reason why it's cool it's weaker
you could write a similar story with just a child genius, but yeah it is actually leaning on the isekai aspect to avoid that, he's a relatively normal smart guy but he's making use of his pre-isekai training and hobbies, and they're not weird obscure ones
K&M technically does use the fact it's an isekai since iirc he was an engineer in japan and used that very technical training to make the magitech better
instead welcome to social anxiety

for some reason the cross rays exe abbreviates it as togg
I only know one of one thing under the second below-water tier; two things in that tier, but I've only vaguely hard people mention zz frag below it, the rest are nothing to me
a lot (most?) of these are mangas or novels
narrator: she was still very gloomy

ooh looks like chuchu's the sniper
(gwitch 3) crunchyroll's on their bs still
keeping track of spare parts is such a pain though I'm not too interested in bothering - I can try fix position tolerance issues (and so can they when making a new design), but having a bag of unused parts is a pain that can't be worked around
significantly less attractive if it's a partsformer then
I thought this one was suipposed to be a proper transform
oh no bocchi met a weeb
rewatching because I could not remember how it goes and I want to know why it's popular in japan
I suppose it's good to confirm that it *was* remastered and have an example of the original, but
did they really just skip the entire episode?
... but the flashbacks look way cleaner?!
the whole thing looks so rough
ok I swear crunchyroll just has the non-remastered version of ep 28
way off-colour and grainy compared to the rest
also around ep 25 you can start noticing more and more cuts that were missed in the remaster
well, the latter part's presumably ended now
she spends her entire time in her room moping though (or in kira's trying to get into his pants)
she supposedly volunteered but I've seen her doing fuck all actual work
so like, from a military perspective, what is flay's role on the ship supposed to be
fuck do I need to rewatch/reread
||didn't even consider that aspect||

||I guess this is where it ramps up into a real rebellion||
||I feel like your own brother and from waaaay before survival was such a big thing is on a whole nother level||
||"Have you ever gaslit your brother into thinking you never existed?"||
||oh yeah totally. And that execution? That's bait||
<@297542051057238017> re:nana: what the fuck
huh, some actually somewhat interesting worldbuilding with the gods in swordsekai
I mean it happened (at least) twice
I wonder if gwitch will also have aliens
ok so how exactly is he supposed to have gotten to space that fast after such a big deal was made over how long it would take to get to the surface (ie; the easy direction)
and this is the episode where he survives a nuke to the face isn't it
I'm amazed japanese regulators allowed that
also did they legit show ||tolle getting fucking decapitated|| on tv
so far only really get why it would be higher than wing
no shiro day is march 14th
||probably gonna depend how long until they can make it a full rebellion||
... ||hang on it's possible rin or someone else might end up dying since michiru can bring them back||
<a:NekoLaugh:650573534602723338>
I still ship her with ||michiru|| but ||a trio with rin might be good||
sure why not
||Michiru saved nana and now the reverse needs to happen||
<a:alfaNod:779500431667232778>
||this is nana though so she'll probably go "of course it's a trap but we're not gonna just let you die"||
||yeah she has too much narrative potential to lose now||

||and does this mean nana's is dormant until she really needs it?||
||the evolving is a weird factor, like can they just keep evolving as they're more needed?||
||didn't she already have that before she was desperate for it?||
||hmm, do talents emerge from need/want or are they preset before they emerge||
||when does michiru get replaced would be my question. Plus it probably takes a couple days to work out that she's close to michiru and find out how to take her||
IT ALL COMES TOGETHER
||other murders are like okay whatever, soon as it's kyoya that needs chasing up||
||Jin also starts going after nana like immediately after the explosion right||
I can find a banagher precast concrete in ireland but not a heavy construction. either their web presence is terrible in english or somethin's changed
and rare enough to not be ranked in US births
not finding anything about it being an indian name
or maybe "5 syllables is too long cut it down"
banana
and it's probably not intended the way it's localised given the other names
no tomino is
a true competitor to Bring Stabity
generally have the opposite issue to most anime names which are awful japanese puns, gundam names are foreign-sounding but nonsense
gundam names usually are just made up
I assumed the slap was because she's not socialised with any kids before and that was probably how she was disciplined on mercury
so in animation you have to understand that movement that had considerable argument and also how to convert it back to a relatively low framerate and still look believable
and because they're fast it's hard enough to see what they're doing that there was *a lot* of argument about how they moved until a few decades after photography was invented and some guy decided "fuck it, let's set up a bunch of cameras and tripwires to take photos as a horse passes in front"
horses move pretty differently to dogs and cats too I'm pretty sure
said the nerd
girls last tour
gineiden is complicated but believable, and I've never seen crest of the stars but if that's real they take the cake
gundam names aren't that complicated just weird
I wanna see the dartboard paworks is using to put ideas together
... well that's sure one way to make it a joke

finally watching Teppen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! episode 2 to find out about this head-of-state assassination plot
horse hair is very short and they're built af so you will see every muscle movement
that actually raises another point why horses are hard: unlike dogs and cats, you can't just hide muscles under fur
you would not put a lot of detail into spider legs though, unless it was like a super-focus scene
hm I think you could probably cheap out on the movement cycle on spiders and have it be acceptable. so long as it looks crawly it's probably fine, while horses have a fairly specific dynamic to their motion
gwitch time
aw no level 100 bocchi in anime
good ep
chuchu based
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
you can be with VPN
dumb space baby
ok so we have two tsuns
ah apparently the gnx designer is responsible for beguir-beu, which also makes a lot of sense
for that design I was thinking gnx for influence
eeeh they're not that much of a personality match
give a review
I mean it might be gwitch needing all the animators but then they're both gonna be fighting for them for cour 2
it's one where it's made to look like that happened
a really good manga
have you seen her in action of course she has a spiked bat
I don't think I've even heard of that one
lyrics start appearing in 3, first two are clean
bocchi can talk just has terrible anxiety about it. and isn't being magically fixed by one person paying all the attention to her
the most important part is chuchu with a bat
got it shortly after
yeah but I was looking at the fight itself
on first watch I didn't 100% notice that the first girl she hits is straight up ko'd
cute girls making things, cute girls in robots, cute girls murdering each other, cute girls climbing mountains, cute girls doing music
how much of this is because of how hard it is for tweeners though? since folds don't move so simply and a KA who did get folds could easily end up with that failing to translate to screen
they are definitely doing decent heavy lifting to make it still flow so well in animation, but the manga has the same flow working well in stills
example that corresponds to current episode
not a lot since it's one of these cases that 4koma formatted but it is continuous plot
if things track closely to manga
ooh I think next ep of bocchi introduces one of the most fun side characters

oh yeah of course we are
oh we're at that part?
I'm caught up on Die Neue These and the subtitle Intrigue sure isn't kidding

also melua I'm curious, is there anything like an article or thread somewhere that goes into all the references in shirobako, like who people are meant to be or what shows and studios are meant to be equivalent?
it's good, not sure if it needs time to sit before watching though
miorine go spinny
What if aerial's v fin is another funnel and when it's about to be cut it just flies out of the way and reattaches itself
it's not 100% necessary but it is story-relevant and has more gay
did you watch the prologue
from the op/ed I think we can expect it, particularly with elan taking himself out of the running
suletta was aggressive enough to slap dat butt
don't kinkshame
that was much later on he also just straight rewrote the strike's entire system
even if he leaves that acronym on it's not the one that was created for the gundams
he basically entirely rewrites it
SEED is funny because it's supposedly the OS making them gundams but the kid wholesale replaces the OS five minutes after getting in, so if that's actually the definition you're trying to use surely it's not a gundam after like episode 2
though yeah jojos is definitely the closer one in terms of the actual fanbase resulting
based on this I'd argue there's more correlation of death note being the anime equivalent than code geass

they so clearly should've been together

a lot of cyberpunk is weirdly scared of tech but then gits is just like "no tech's cool just be cautious about how much you make available for hacking or give control of to corps"
which gits is, but it's also way more progressive on things like "yeah, actually, people can replace their whole body and not suffer weird psychosis"
sometimes even called post-cyberpunk because it's so far ahead of 90% of the genre
gonna be a while to get there though
split cour is confirmed, it's probably gonna have 4 so long as the kits keep being successful
https://twitter.com/DfLmanga/status/1589064097240592384
by the time he joins them I would expect the school's been left behind and "earth house" is no longer relevant
he's definitely going in the direction of joining the protagonists when shit goes down
LoGH:DNT ||ok so if yang wen li's switching sides *surely* it's gotta be soon, with the FPA govt siding with the old empire||
really hope we get a second season to at least get to one particular point I wanna see
very cool bocchi ep, and a good choice for when to slow down the pace
that would just indicate this machine's blue instead of red. We don't see anyone else's colour in Lfrith
||we get calendar dates that line up with suletta being ericht. So unless you wanna hypothesise there are lies with those, it doesn't work. I think this is similar to a thing in the background of 86 - aerial having been raised with ericht (even largely *by* her) because of the doctor asking her to talk to the robot, has made aerial's AI into a reflection of her||
||she caught The Gay™️||
14 songs? by the time cour 1 finishes they're only gonna have 3 in-universe, so I hope that's a sign of a second
||other alternative for 21-year-old grudge: it could be when she lost her arm||
||the visuals of the music video keep showing ericht and suletta both looking *to* aerial, or touching it in wonder, which to me implies they're both separate to her||
rewatching the OP music video ||I don't think this shows evidence of ericht becoming aerial either, though ericht and suletta being different people *is* viable, I think. I'm pretty sure the prologue was meant to show ericht had the ability to use the gund without damage, but maybe there was an accident and suletta's her trying again, this time avoiding the gund link as much as possible||
||yeah that weakens it a lot||
||... wait actually the shakespeare spelling is Ariel||
||eh, if it's supposed to be named by the lady who literally called herself Prospero I could see it being a very bad and boring reference||
||she said she was told he died when she was young, which could be a not-exactly-a-lie in the new theory||
I'm with melua hoping it's not the new theory, at least not in the exact way shown, since it's too straightforward and removes any potential messaging about AI which it feels like is a background theme that's developing
she says ||"for a 21-year-old grudge" so if you subscribe to this new theory suletta is 4 years younger than the destruction of folkvangr and ericht would be 8 by the time she's born||
||I reckon elan#5 will bring it in again||

how the f do they have it before nyaa
<@171395487247630336>
Where are you seeing it? I don't see it on crunchyroll or anywhere on nyaa
discs do have another advantage over streaming that because they don't need to be able to consistently buffer they can have a much more variable bitrate, to have lower rates in still scenes but then pump crazy bitrates when stuff's actually moving
the only resulting question is if they actually make use of that extra space in jp-style releases, and if you can actually tell the difference in anime
All shows on disc are compressed, the question is always going to be *how* compressed. at 13 episodes per blu-ray that's only going to be a little less than double most streaming services data per episode, whereas 3-4 episodes can be the same bitrate as a movie and there's lots of examples available for how streaming has a noticeable quality reduction compared to blu-ray there
but bocchi chapters are pretty story-dense for a 4koma
ep 6 was also a single chapter
I read recently and caught up, it's not really taking away from how fun it is
ah yes she's exactly like I hoped she would be
witch in the pocket
with the names you can only really blame yourself for that
so at least with bocchi the titles work out vaguer
gay af
protip for americans: the only part of a car that is consistent effective cover against bullets is the engine block, since that's a huge block of metal
will she though?
never lend her money tho
but a terrible movie while GuP was a great movie
true
otoh some of the more successful multimedia projects seem to be successful in spite of it - GuP comes to mind as "literally nothing outside the anime matters and is barely talked about"
that latter part was saying "in the next few episodes", not the next
I am trying to give original LoGH a fair shake compared to DNT, but I keep finding reasons that I'm fully on with DNT telling a better story (because they're not 1:1 and DNT is better regardless of the fact it's closer to the novels), and mistranslations sure don't help the original
or fuccboi elan will come into the picture
as a result while I think the originals were lacking due to paint colour options, in more modern gundams there tends to be a way higher density of people of colour than any other anime
IIRC tomino's explicitly stated in interviews that he's very pro-multiculturalism and has been since the original? And explicitly wrote it in as an aspirational aspect to the story that everyone comes from everywhere
there's only one japanese person in the original gundam
she's tall for an asian but also probably not an asian
one punch chuchu
out like a light
oh ok hidden account
https://twitter.com/uwilmod/status/1593302818563276803
I'm also not saying it's going to be the overall theme of the entire show, but it's where Lfrith/Aerial is pointed. And this twist would mean you can't do anything with it
Lfrith was pretty clearly referred to as an AI
because I watched the prologue?
||if Aerial is Ericht then any statement the show tries to make about AI via Aerial is invalidated since she's "actually human"||
that's *one tiny part* of a whole story
that's just a retelling of cradle planet
it's a story with just as much evidence as yours. More arguably, since I'm not ignoring that Lfrith was always implied to be an AI of some form
that completely outperformed him, unlike self-driving cars
uh, prologue: ||all the implications that Lfrith is an AI||, main show: ||Guel being supplanted by an AI and refusing it||
where does it fit with the themes of the show more than "everyone's honest and there's just something else earlier on"
because it's worse storytelling that prevents any possible message about AI from actually working
||21 years is also easily explainable if something else happened a few years before the prologue, such as maybe ochs earth lost a production bid and had to develop the gund system with very little funding. We don't know that the prologue was the start of bad blood between ochs and delling||
also BD isn't the only other time they've done "person trapped in the gundam" making it even less original versus AI which has been a touch-point with drones but never actually explored as a complex subject
new pair bullying them to get together is good
I'm keepin up with the raws for it
plz hijiki (and translators)
"Our yuri started with being rejected in a dream" is too fuckin cute I need more already <:shamiAAAAA:693220107345985626>
there's a surprising number of people credited for the OP but the only connection I can find is https://anilist.co/staff/140905/Mitsuyuki-Sasagawa, which I'd call 50/50 whether that's their shot or whoever was doing it just had 86 on the brain
I have no idea but let's see if the info's available
... and now I'm just noticing this in the sxf2 OP because it's on the mind but ???
the prediction wasn't wrong
https://twitter.com/Namaryuu/status/1592482128645980162
wat
also *this* is the episode storyboarded by 86's director
I mean you're talking about a joke that would also fail for japanese people watching via a lot of streaming services - it's just one designed to presume you're familiar with ad breaks
||sharing clothes||, they're married already
it was a show that was clearly a thought-out story and had messages and themes but no-one could figure out what they were until like, 2-3 episodes after that given aspect was shown when more context was provided, and in the meantime weirder shit had appeared
I need to know that it wasn't just a fever dream
please continue and post reactions
F in advance
the british team is the one they've not beaten while the germans they have, so it's relatively meaningless to win there but winning versus the british team would be meaningful to the character and story arc
ah so we're gonna see uk vs ger team in more detail I'd guess? we can predict which one's gonna win though
there isn't really a "her" anyway the real alternatives are a) actual names or b) "kanojo" which is more explicitly "girl" anyway
pronouns function very differently and it's a pretty reasonable way to say it
technically you could argue that's so delling doesn't try arrange a different one, though she doesn't seem to focus on that possible logic
(this brown one ||is also canon but how is spoilers||)
she has the same gitah in manga
they're gekidols
:)
powerfully gay
yep
I don't actively check these things in general but I was looking for something and checking twitter for info and happened to see it
she doesn't actively advertise it but it has been mentioned on twitter before
though the laziest search possible doesn't come up with results so feck it not gonna go pointing out where
I'm pretty sure I've told you before
the author is trans which helps for the getting treated seriously thing
you could very easily read it either way
they're consistently very insistent that they're still a guy
I mean ... arguably that fantasy bishoujo one
||yeah, for now just a few more powers to use in rescuing rin. Some more interesting detail on kyoya's memory though||
well she ||sure looks different now|| but this has gotta be build up right?
gonna watch it regardless
we'll see
the characters referencing LN art more than manga is disappointing but that's the only worse aspect I've noticed thus far, and it doesn't prevent them using the style for chibi moments at least
and fran's voicing the maid
huh, drunk lady in bocchi is gonna voice annisophia in magirevo
bocchi sweep
it's the worst pun but a good design
||she may have only invited 3 non-family members but she made an actual connection with them and so all three showed up, unlike everyone else||
Sure you do. "Vanadis Incident" could very easily be the thing that turned public opinion against gund tech in the first place, years before action was actually taken against it
||Is it, though? The whole thing was clandestine. We've not had any confirmation in main series that the Folkvangr attack is known by anyone who wasn't there||
||I could see either kitaxhitori or nijikaxhitori working||
open/clear skies would be appropriate translation
hirogaru = opening up
the premise being vtuber school?
||no flags, this isn't gup, all's on until the antenna breaks||
it's amazing how easily stuff like that can trigger yet so many right-wing terrorists fail to trigger it
just watched it, quite a bit packed into the ep, and it's fantastic
heck yes
oh do we meet ||the weeb|| in the new episode?
op2 actually comes pretty late iirc
unless it runs less often would still expect a new chapter in jan
just read up the new chapters of it and I think the translator just didn't check whether it was up to date or not, the latest chapter was from the december yurihime and still says to be continued
||they might not have read the original and know how much more there is?||
never lend either of them money
yes!
it's happening!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Z8TDNdE0c
the merchandising is a major part of *why* they all get made and therefore is inherently as yikes as any contained factor within them
and best of all of course when those meet and you get the infinite OYW sidestory mechs that get made
there's lots of aspects to it. While both are problematic fetishising the clearly-fascist side probably feels a lot worse than the heroic side, and the fact that a lot of the series is made specifically just to create kits to sell, rather than to tell a story that fits with the themes
00 did child soldier first
I don't have a huge opinion on that unlike magirevo, both are good. A number of people have pointed out that it does look very much like an otome game art style
relatively minor but I have seen them before, anilist is already updated (was within 15 minutes) if you want to look up
~~so is most isekai from the writer nerding about their mostly generic world~~
would be weirdly slow to not given typical adaptation ratios
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
at least say if it's before end of vol 2 so I know if there's any chance it'll be in anime
when do they kith

the main themes of LoGH:DNT, though I suspect the in-show music is someone else just because that would be a lot of project
if you've looked him up then you may have also noticed his track titles https://youtu.be/7_zuTQGguPg
I just saw the tags for asumi-chan and how are any of these less than 100%
so many people die in 00
this isn't even dark for gundam lol
DiY directly lampshades the fact that its plot is unoriginal by commenting that it's a common trope while bocchi has stuff I've provably never seen before because I've never seen an actual zoetrope used in anime
I'm still on like ep 2-3 of that
the characterisations feel a lot flatter and the pacing's super slow while bocchi shows you don't need that even for a light fun show
bocchi's easily season winner for me, with diy idk it just feels too plain, especially with bocchi right there
there's the concurrent theory that the girl is ash's kid and the boy is jesse and james'
rewatching koe no katachi and realising it actually has the "the shape of voice" title in english in the pre-op. why even change the name when it's hard set
that's definitely not all and there's non-anime references too (like the low poly model through the blocks)
and the most important
book 1's epilogue has a timeskip that book 2 and 3 fall into
the anime ended at the end of book 3, but that's also the end of book 1
why, is there salt?
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
is it gay tho
oh right other way
chisa taki nyan (chisato takina)
heero is less than 2 inches taller than chris
pretty sure touya's right with 21, though I think there might be a chapter half-adapted at the end there
oh no the finger's back
there's 4 complete volumes and they didn't even completely adapt the second
why not both
but ash very much knows about this one being gay
I assume "early fansub" means "someone on production leaked it and some details may still be non-final"
first cour had the potential to just be for setup when it was giving slow sol episodes but in second cour it was just nothing but slow episodes that didn't matter at all

for a bit
||things are moving quickly now||
not finishing vol 2 is probably very <:catbrain:847879295996919888> because anyone trying to do direct continuation from anime can only skip vol 1
and still ongoing with the author saying they still have a lot more ideas IIRC
over 3, 2nd wasn't completed
both at the same time
they played it competently in the audition P:
it took a couple times to grow on me but that's definitely a good one
they've had that one up for a while, a few got drip-fed alongside the series
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzeDv8VHk5c
just finished himegami no miko. good gay stuff
~~technically nuclear lasers are a thing they just don't survive the firing~~
as she should
I might give it a couple eps to see how it goes but I'm thinking I'd've very much preferred doga kobo
if you "look in the right places" there's plenty in the west too
if you have to look in the right places it's not an overwhelming amount of the industry
Not to this extent
and it does make me wonder if studio bind is just full of lolicons after MT and now adapting a wholesome manga like this
I've not looked at the early-air episode yet but apparently ep 1 is pretty similar to the OP in terms of this
it's well-animated but it has so much questionable focus that just didn't exist in manga
judge for yourself ||https://vxtwitter.com/nakayasee/status/1608065866112835584 ||
just seen the oshimai OP and I think those 90 seconds have more fanservice than 70 chapters of manga
we have a couple more yuri next season though I wouldn't currently expect them to dominate the same way
you can't see the offscreen bodies of several unconscious spacians

<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
ok that's a fair option
Idk what I'd put for something like "best scene" I'm not sure there's been singular standouts for that since XV. Lycoreco and bocchi and gwitch have had plenty of good scenes but idk that I could point out a singular best
is it normal at the start of the series
isekai is being displaced out of your normal "world". Time travel is an isekai even if you don't actually move from the spot you're standing. Space travel in a world where that's normal is not isekai - so star wars is not, but stargate is
is magic school bus an isekai
I thought they were saving that for the last episode
it is
||you do see him turning away in the last shot before||
watched first ep of magirevo, ||was not expecting it to be so anime original but it's very fun||
nah let her believe
I mean, it's not "just made in japan" it's made in japan by a japanese studio contracted by a japanese channel for the japanese market.

Literally the only thing not japanese is the IP
after kenja deshi kenja I'm happy with just getting anime original stuff that fits and is competently done, it has more episodes to prove itself great
~~needs to be cute girls doing archery instead~~
or at the very least can be cut down significantly
the manga has lots of tell later on with exposition scenes that are now not needed with ||tilty's early introduction and already contextualising her royal position||
and I mean, consider the phrasing of ep 2's title
||If she's never seen euphilia, how would she know what the situation she landed in is? It can be taken as implicit that some scene like that did happen in both other formats but was unmentioned, anime is taking the chance to mention it with its more show-don't-tell approach||
remember that that panel is *euphy's imagination* and she's not been given this context yet
||that panel doesn't come until next episode anyway and having seen her once is arguably a necessary point for recognising her at all||

||at the very least we did get some of that time and with a completely full episode, no op/ed||
more likely they just have automated systems to grab and upload that are timed to the official release so they didn't pick up pre-air. pre-air has subs
yep nothing changed since the pre-air
there's a pre-air that appears to be the full finished ep, nothing really out of place aside from overlays. The raw's airing right now so official subs will probably be like an hour

I found it funny where I dropped konosuba fairly early, though it's nothing amazing
lol
has the last ep come out yet
can you call that animated?

see: all the people sleeping on bocchi
If you insist on only getting A+ you're gonna miss most of them anyway
I'm gonna at least start watching it along with all the other yuri this year
and a shortlist of staff:
> shokugeki no souma's character designer
> kimetsu no yaiba's composer
> and the series composition worked on Adashima, gotoubun and Machikado Mazoku
https://youtu.be/YRDSausZ4_g
supposedly yuri harem and people commenting on the PV are confused by it actually looking good despite being project no 9
the jp name is more specifically tenten kakumei (which is the site url) but that's a pun that doesn't work with the english title so we take magical for it instead
that's a different synopsis to what anilist has for either
though actually it is tagged as male protag so hrm
does it? anilist only lists 6 girls as characters for the LN
on the list it goes
does it look homo
even without those (and until this week hiki vampire was on the leak part of the list) it's good eating
though ggwp doesn't have a date so might not be this year, same with seiyuu radio I think
> 13 future GL anime (+leaked)
> Magirevo
> Watayuri
> Wataoshi
> Hoshikuzu Telepath
> Birdie Wing S2
> Gundam Witch Part 2
> Seiyuu Radio
> GGWP
> Hikikomari vampire
> Sasakoi (leak)
> Vampeerz (leak)
> Citrus S2 (leak, unreliable source)
> Watanare (leak, unreliable source)
and this year's stacked even without the rumoured ones
I watched otherside picnic all the way through
whispered words anime doesn't get near far enough
probably most it's just citrus and ntr are funny to meme on
I am still vaguely planning to watch it at some point
'cause this is a funny enough take for me to go with it
is carlos claiming all romance media is ntr?
~~nah there's several like that because best girl should get with second best girl instead~~
~~now kith~~
it'd be perfectly possible to have idle conversation about it, and they do go to a co-ed school
it's entirely possible bocchi's gay too given a total lack of expression of any kind of guy-interest but she comments plenty on how nice the girls around her are
nanoha does sportsball
~~what do you mean we got a new symphogear project confirmed last year~~
well in anime club ...
theory: anis = hiroi isekai'd. discuss.

more butt?
lycoris recoil and 86 are a-1 aren't they
did you watch the post-credits
cute girls beating each other up?
any anime can fuck up later on (see: wep) but from the first ep I don't see a reason to think it's any more likely here
I think you're the only one
magirevo is basically pure fantasy and just isekai on a technicality
since it's a more SoL spinoff
zwei herz is generally considered 2.5 I'm pretty sure
inori wrote a sketch of rei and claire live-reacting to magirevo ep 1
https://twitter.com/Inori_ILTV/status/1612393240090771456
d5dj

pretty much from the manga
ED is less weird, animation's decent enough when they're actually bothering, episode is very exposition-heavy since they're not trying to be clever about the adaptation like magirevo

... well this is a fuckin weird OP theme for reborn to master the blade
implied? It's canon
if we can just get as good an adaptation for ILTV we will be truly blessed this year
true, but on the other hand the anime has considerable new meme potential https://twitter.com/kiyuri_P/status/1611999378507706368
this whole ep was basically two conversations it's not that fast
the point more being that if that bypassed the treaty everything from before it would too so why would this thing be special
something nuclear-powered would have batteries for high-power transient loads anyway so I don't think "we charge the battery with it" would cut it for a treaty about using nuclear power
||she didn't know then though||
so we now get to find out exactly when claire turned homo
<:catbrain:847879295996919888>
bocchi would probably change her name and move to another city
probably but keep doing it
true, better sleep with more guys to make sure you're not into it
... hair doesn't look particularly close to me and shoujo manga hair basically always needs simplifying for anime
and if it's just the expressions then ... you're eventually gonna run out of original romantic poses to use ofc there's gonna be reuse
not seen anything of oregairu so I wasn't comparing that way just seeing if it's well matched to the original. If the original just happens to be similar to some other trash I don't really care
still don't see anything that makes them hugely different to the original art
not sure what other congrats image is meant because the only other I see is the edit of vol 7's cover which is posed completely differently and has basically nothing to compare?
I'm looking at the vol 2 cover and is it actually that different to how they look?
in the end you may as well make the shows actually woke 'cause the right wingers aren't gonna watch em anyway
yeah but in this cycle it's funny because there's always *barely anything* they'd normally call woke, if anything, and plenty they'd love like transphobia
ah yes because those have never been on TV before
I swear this is basically what happened with one of the PPG remakes too and some other stuff
is it just me or do we keep having a cycle of
show is rebooted but something smells fishy, generally left groups start questioning it
right groups start complaining it'll be woke long after complaints originally started when there starts being a bit more publicity about it coming soon
turns out one of the creators is a shitstain and like the least woke person you've ever heard of
left groups who would've watched it don't and the right groups never would've in the first place
is that the full chariot setup from k&m
prudent, rather than coward, perhaps
fandom, probably
hope the season 2 leak is legit
citrus is good
there's one change they could make to the manga to make it more wholesome. I suspect any others would be less <:ao_sus:819391312745857054>
the OP and ED sure aren't but we'll see how close to the manga the actual show stays
no they just deleted all the other shows
wasn't the writer a woman?
I don't remember anything about high guardian spice's creator being a transphobe?
yeah something's holding it there, but it's not just pipe continuation and the pipe doesn't continue past the stalls
which I can't tell what it does? It doesn't go along the toilet or the sink wall
... that's not even a light fixture it's a random pipe?
incredible
it also like, makes sense that it's fat when it's additional armour over the key unit that's much lighter but has special capabilities? While seravee is just fat
s2's basically just had some additional lines that could be skipped while s1's had more actual *parts*
that's pretty normal I think? But s1's were as detailed in the regular animation as s2's in the glory shots
GN cables are cool
I've seen *one* random person on twitter say it but by far it's the minority opinion
only way you can improve a haro, no notes here
more giant robots need hips instead of crazy shoulders
I think it looks better without, tbh. It just feels overdesigned with *everything* mounted around the shoulders
it does however mean those bullets are gonna hurt like a bitch, but yes the only part of a normal car that is "armor" is the engine block
gunjutsu
is it gay yet
probably need to wait for them on one of the auction sites
chad citrus: get together halfway and then build up to the wedding, then do a sequel with even more buildup to the wedding
it's clearly an ecchi shounen first and foremost <:Ashuna_laugh:973937738522976326>
yet they're still not together after 100+ chapters ||and 40+ after agreeing they should get together||
ok somehow I was forgetting onimai (possibly because you see no before)
I still only know of 2
and we've definitely had 2 in a season before
I only know of 2?
I've rewatched most of seed recently and it's still not great
also 00 at least avoids "warships constantly being destroyed by smaller weapons", and warships aren't even really a thing until the tau drives make more active space combat viable
6 episodes in I was wondering how long seed was gonna drag out that arc but I won't comment further
00 has economics be relevant but actual machine costs are never gone into, other than vaguely "ok getting constantly wrecked by gundams is getting untenable even for major economies"
at the time of eva I'd've probably accepted this but I just laughed at myself because now my reaction is "like they're spending enough on those things to make a dent in the military budget"
by "raunchy" in the descriptions, it means that his manga is about a character who wears boxers on his head and the jokes are silly but on the side that only older readers would get it. It's not sexual in any manner
so it's not yuri if 3 girls confess in a triangle and all end up getting together but they never formally confess the other way?
what if the nier delay is intentional and eps 1-3 are different
it's enjoyable just very Fucked Up™️
have fun
fwend
fair but I couldn't even see where an option for paywalled stuff would be, it just looked stonewalled
huh why do oricon only have estimated sales for the current week
so it's def still selling
(it dropped to 2 the week after and this last week is 3 so far)
might be their weekly chart? since it was best seller that week on oricon https://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/ja/w/2023-01-09/
it'll be floating around in a couple weeks or so as a result
vol 2 blu ray iirc
~~I nyaasi'd a flac version anyway to save myself having to find a drive and extract it~~
and it's still a purchase
it's my parents' so I'll get it eventually
Mine went to the wrong address because cdjapan did not make the shipping address clearly separate lol
and by the time it airs there'd probably be enough for a third
crazy sales hasn't always guaranteed more seasons, but hopefully. there's enough manga for it
inb4 the shitpost that ep 1-3 rebroadcast change turns out to be true
they delayed two episodes, didn't they
~~plus if this is the one time china lets everyone out of quarantine of course they're all gonna get covid~~
not american but we had like two weeks off + half the office used PTO the week before the office closed for xmas so more like 3
after hibiki convinced her of the power of love and friendship she reincarnated as a weirdo bassist who wants to hear people express their honest feelings

> highschool dxd
why not both
(I know I'm asking which is best girl)
which one?
happy dorito
yes
that was funny but it was nothing special
k and g are the same letter in as far as your mouth pronunciation the change is just in throat, and japanese acknowledges that in the writing so you get shorthands that can swap them
I mean that relation isn't explained as far as I've read (though it's manga so anime might even overtake that point) but yeah the shortening is just a grammatical thing
G is voiced K so they're swapping between i-n-gu-ri-su and ku-ri-su which to a japanese ear is a perfectly normal shortening
someone break a spine?
<a:BocchiNod:1060572600381739110>
why does everything come in multiples after having none for literal decades
https://youtu.be/x9H2uJxOREs why are there *two* formula racing anime coming up soon
I do enjoy on this one that I think they've added a bit of vignette and blur to make it look like it was an actual smartphone view
ah yes the weeb
given the tweet says "these two's story is not over" I would rule out compilation stuff
lycoris s2

when they need filler text they'll just take it from wherever and it's great

also chisato's gun replica was around during its airing wasn't it? since it's based on an actual one
I hear at least carol and miku in there
ore ga gandamu
weird kink but ok
parts type always means having to find the alternate parts no matter how quick it is though
it definitely feels homo but whether they develop a relationship is another matter
you remember that but not iftv?
f
how many of these are gay
||that's how the real stuff works anyway||
barcode battler was definitely a Thing™️ that got pushed a lot and never seemed to gain any traction. Don't think I even tangentially heard of them existing except on tv
even companies *still* posting more profits post-covid laid off people (See: microsoft, google, etc). It's constant pressure from investors insisting on reducing the baseline, they'd fire literally everyone if they could
<:KarenPirate:397866969723830282>
though I can go back and read
oh I missed the last one too
still didn't recognise logh until like third pass through the list though
I shouldn't need to but it gets way easier to recognise stuff at 200% zoom (and a 1440p screen)

mayonnaise and slavery, the two staples
recently I've not been tho so who knows where my current list will end up but
I mean when I'm feeling like anime a lot I could easily watch multiple episodes an evening and keep that up most of the week, it's not that hard if it's your main relaxation
