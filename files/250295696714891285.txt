Given the last few messages I can't blame you
Who are you, m. Zuckerberg?
*Megalomania starts playing*

Once I find the time that is
I see. Ima sit myself down and make that bot then I guess
So you have both
I mean I guess you could also do a Color me only X command
Why tho that's what the character roles are for
<@263983345669505025> mostly a question for you I guess
Would it be possible to make it so that when you get a color me X role you lose all other color me roles?
The same advantages dont apply to streaming, at least not at she same rate.
VC however is a very integral part of communication on such a server and allows for much more things that otherwise couldnt happen like group viewings or gaming together in a neutral space.
So, its far easier to moderate text than it is to moderate those things
Not to mention that as was mentioned before VC/Streaming isnt logged so you cant just look up what has happened.
because toning down the amount of things to moderate increases the resources you have to moderate the server as a whole
Yea sure they arent. But... that is the exact reason why they have disabled streaming
Because that is the function of a moderator
Im pretty sure they would feel that way
or rather
not... really? If it happens in here it is at least partially the fault of the moderation team
hmmm
and that way, the person can always decline or block if something harmful is going on. 
Although this does put the responsibility more on the individual
yea. Nothing stopping you form doing so
Honestly if you just want to show one person something, you can just you know, pm them and start a screensharing call that way
I also throw in the idea of writing one story where everyone writes only a certain maximum of words and then the next person has to write (my idea would be 100 or perhaps 200 words per person)
when we are on ep. 10 we only watch 2 episodes, so we can watch the last one alone and discus our feelings about the season afterwards
But I agree that 3 should be the max
Maybe we could mismatch 2/3 depending on where that lets us end for the most anticipation for next week
I think that if you do it only once a week 3 episodes are the best format since it does allow for sizable chunks and also isn't too long (about 70-80 minutes)

I agree with Matt 100% technically that can even be true of Twitter but it's much more unlikely
Ok, sorry. I mean the whole suggestion was a joke after all, but yea I'll refrain from using it that way
Ok sorry I'm only joking dess
*reveals to be a true Stalinist*
He is obviously good
Nah don't think so
Ah yes World of Warcraft characters being morally grey was the best part about Battle for Azeroth
If you have problems like this try to open it in a command prompt that might help you get the error
No you have to install it
That is true
Depends on how many people are watching we could just do like a discord screenshare?
I mean the we/us role really only show for example that when we talk about us we mean us as a singular system and I do see the merit in that
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I mean I did it too
for like the first 4 times perhaps
for reference to what I mean: https://discord.com/channels/336297387863703552/337805317276565525/928302318238187550
the trash troop
Or as Kerrik would say
so they can be educated
get everyone to watch Utena
More like #Point-of-no-return
but then again this shouldn't happen here anyways
yea makes sense
yea mean that it will probably not be easy to find common ground on what to watch?
because its old probably
actually there are a lot but still
What is the purpose of this channel anyways I always thought it was about suggesting changes to the server itself or its moderation
be gay instead
being reasonable sucks
yea 100% agreed
^
Someone gave them to you on a cold summer night
That is mythra :/
Id rather not this server be public
tbh
Well for you aren't adult yet so no nsfw for you. And I guess you can post your unrelated memes in hieroglyphs
into Live Shitposting it goes
otherwise
I feel when its part of the conversation (and sfw) put it in the channel the conversation was in
You aren't really missing too much don't worry
And I guess also where the manga/ln is being posted
Yea it's kind of the unofficial nsfw non art channel
Is  that enough or do you want to hear more?
We have modded several times in our lives 
for about 3 years we modded a teamspeak server which was filled with actually rather diffcult.
We work in the service sector so we are no strangers to helping people who are being difficult.
We also still on a discord server so its not like we are out of the loop with that.
We have been organizing meetups for about 5 years now (online and offline) which was rather hard work I'd say.
Sure
no not at all
<a:FlaynWave:708868350607884438>
Its just that these last few days, its just been filled with joke suggestions so I get the idea. 
It is a bit annoying to think someone might have actually said something you might want to consider and then it just turns out to be the next jokey suggestion. Which is not bad in isolation but it has increased these last few days to the point where you can't really expect a serious suggestion anymore. In essence I don't think removing it is a good idea, but at the same time I would really appreciate if we could limit the channel to more serious suggestions. (not saying anyone who did that before did a bad thing just kinda would like the channel to be usable for serious suggestions)
Its still toxic. Ella, do not eat grass or I will personally ground you.
and messes up your teeth
Also btw. just so we are clear here: Never eat grass its toxic to you
Honestly I think I've never had the experience here that techtalk has been a problem so as much as I understand the desire, I don't think it's super nessisary
That makes sense tho, since table top games is something that's done here
We could also have stuff like programming and the sorts
So, why not have gaming be a thread in tech
Gaming is kinda part of tech
No like
How about making a tech channel and having that split off into threads whenever it gets too much
It happens
Simple talking besides each other.
That was all
Das calm down I just wanted to point that out because when people say something like that they tend to mean "and I don't like that because" I just wanted to point out that **I** think it's good not that **you** think it's bad
Which is good actually
What for, please don't be sorry, you have not done anything wrong, I just want you to be better. You really don't need to feel sorry ok?
The problem I see with the "live posting" ala putting out all your thoughts is that... it essentially is as if you were streaming it without streaming it. And while yes I understand for some its easier to look up what someone thought about something every second but, and I know that some people are too shy to go into a vc but stilll I feel like you either are there or you are not, and that is essentially how a stream of a game/anime would be in vc as well. (it is ofc not exactly the same btw still.) I mean there is nothing that goes against still posting highlights, but your postings about the anime you watch and the games you play can get rather excessive. It wasn't a problem yet however I feel there are certainly better ways to express that. Maybe a blog, as odd as that sounds nowadays.
Yes well this sever is always changing and it kinda is ok there, like it wasn't a problem. I just feel like what you are doing could be probably done better as its own thing, maybe something you can link to.
How much cash is required?
A channel is really only necessary when it permeates the general discussion so much that is warrants being put in its own corner
mind you, can just talk about it in general normally when the topic comes up
In terms of talking about Literature itself I don't think we talk enough about it to warrant its own channel
As in, what kind of thing would you discuss there?
<a:patpatpat:857369131733090334> I see so it was already tried. It's ok lily sometimes these bots are really dumb
probably because it would be confusing for newer people and also a bit bloaty
Also keep in mind these are supposed to be something you only have one of, since they cancel each other out
probably just a bit of looping around tbh.
I suppose, if I were able to build one that would be able to do anything Elfnein could, then I suppose you could replace her (Call it Elfnein 2.0 and she has a robot eye lol)
I just wouldn't want to have like bot bloat, because we can (technically) make a bot that can do that, its just we'd rather it would be possible with a bot that is already there
yea, I think I heard about that before. Though Yggdrasil might be able to do that
<@263983345669505025> Can we add additional functionality to Elfnein? Like give it more specific commands for role selection?
I would really love to have the "Color me" command take away all other roles that would begin with "Color me" so you don't have to type 5 different commands depending on what colors you used to have. Maybe you could give that to Yggdrasil instead if Elfnein doesn't work?

Why are we explaining this in introduction
\`\`\` text
Fun fact snipping flowers is something you often do in gardening so that the flower in question can grow better in the future
Jaden is an interesting protagonist Especially in terms of Yu-Gi-Oh
I think so too
power metal might be a thing here
hmmm
Good thing, can almost already imagen the song
Ah, no sorry Matt we had no friends in school at least not really the we was as in we, our System

meaning you have to do alot of training to get it to 20 but then again Garados is a strong Pokemon even with 4 Hms Surf is good anyways so is fly
In gen 1 Pokemon are catogorized by level groups Magikarp is part of the slow group
nah its 20 but the exp rate is insane
(Grados can learn 4 Hm making it the perfect hm slave
I dub thee, HM-Slave

Good Night
tho you should try to beat Misty first
once you have spoken with Bill (you need to help him first) a house will be open that wasnt open before in the city you need to go through there
Also direction wise
Puh... its late I think im going to hit the hay, keep fighting the good fight

Here is a list with things to do, if anyone wants to keep going:
- Train Magikarp to lvl 20 thorugh switch training (So it can evolve and learn fly and later strength and surf)
- Beat the 4. gym. (should not be too hard, Simon is very much over leveled)
- Do The Pokemon Tower (we have a doll so we dont need the Silph Scope)
- Check on Chris  (She is in the daycare)
Ok, I need to do some other stuff

Hey <@!171395487247630336> you wanna see something super duper wholesome?
https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/the_idiot_in_your_thoughts_the_idiot_in_mine#1
But what if Chris a bit more sad?
Iits ok Das. Though I must admit... I'd somewhat would like to see Fudou dead... somewhat.
Its supposed to convey a certain emotion as a way of exploring a story implication. Sometimes you wanna go to that dark place hopefully to return with more value for that which you have, knowing our time here is precious.
The point of the picture is to show the loneliness that Qiqi is probably going to feel, it isnt literally about the characters death. After all grave stones are only a shorthand.
No, just... The one in the middle is the only one who is undead therefore she will never die of natural causes
This is sooooo cute!
First commision from con more will follow

When Hibiki says she doesn't wanna eat the meal
Ah yes that way Tsubasa can be with Shirabe finally.

Hi: Not enough Miku!
<@260489748869677067>
Still looks super good^^
Oh! that makes way more sense, so the first Kanji in the thought bubble is Hibiki itself, and the other is an is
hope that helps
From Right to left: 
"Look Miku, this shirt is so cute"
"Fufu, I agree. It is very cute"
"Yep!"
Miku is thinking: "Hibiki"
I can try shooting it through translation and kinda guess if that helps
Yoo that is super cute
Now we shall know who the "horny bastards" are!
Lovely Edelgard
What did you search for anyways?
I like how they give each other confidence in their own abilities
but that interaction between the protagonist and her in one of the most recent missions I did was just so good
Im not to far into the game myself

Kanade is Aerith
Quick reminder that the only reason flayn likes fish that much is because it reminds her of good times with her mother and father
Wait yea Kanade being Zack is actually perfect 
Aerith is obviously Miku... Even if I don't want to admit it
<:ShemHaEvil:642229421062750208>
Oh that's what you meant
And obviously I did wanted to give credit to the artist so I posted the link seperatly
Do you mean me? Because it's a commission they made for us they did not post it. But I did wanted to share it with you
But yea see it as the two of them kissing on a mission when Miku does not expect it
Should I Spoiler that?

but very gay
|| <@222517038042710017> I don't think he is still an autoscorer then no, the same way Hibiki kinda leaves behind her human form||
Oh yea my post is a spoiler huh

Huh
I guess I'm gay
Fellas is it gay to marry your best friend and sunshine of your life?
But yea obviously they all do it's just more visible since they have an arc showing the suffering as a center piece
No I actually think Kirika and Shirabe don't have a "suffer" arc
Come on Maria suffers too in the tomato arc
Super cute!
Which I think was one of the main characters
No I meant a fistweapon combined with a gun
I mean isn't that just like that one character from RUBY?

this is why in our fanfic universe Miku studies the power of symphogears and follows in Ryukos steps


<:maddygoodjob:688226701817151534>
Very cute indeed
The idea here is that, by distributing art you commissioned you give someone access to art that the artist has gotten money to draw, and that choice should be with the artist, since it is still their work. That is how it works legally, of course in the real world most artists are glad when their art is shared
Well its fine normally. Distribution =/= Commercialisation those are two different things. But yea by default you do not have the right to distribute art if you commision it, like sharing it around or posting it online, because that is understood by copyright law as illegal distribution. (according to some law I don't know the name of) Most Artist online don't mind that though and thus because there is no one who would sue you, nothing really happens. I just find it important to be aware that "technically" it is illegal. Most people are aware that the same is true for commercialisation, well NTFbros don't but they aren't really smart either.
I just mentioned the right to commercialise because its often misunderstood too.
No but the right to distribute is still not upheld when you distribute it.
No. actually. While yes the artwork is "yours" that does not mean you have the right to distribute or commercialise it, unless  that was part of the contract you made when you commissioned the artist.
generally speaking you should always ask for permission on sharing the artwork.
well getting pinged is a privilege not an obligation. And its rather hard to remember everyone who likes a thing.
very cute
Because like... Most people would just not know I assume and would probably then think they might have done something bad
Wouldn't it be better if instead it also tried to search for the actual source? Or is that not possible

Yep, it is certainly for the better
I see
Testing again to see if there are different imagies
Testing the new settings for iggy
but don't let her know
Taiga cute tbh tho

But as it turns out it was haunted
14 years ago kerrik brought a server at a garage sale but it was a used one with a singular file from before on it titled "Biki.exe" he did not use it as he didn't want to look into other people's files.
No Das, don't reply to this, if you want to reply do it in our dms
Also, please have this discussion in private since this is not the #having-arguments-about-my-personal-hangups-channel
Das, stop putting your self-worth into weither or not you can post art before other people, its just not worth losing your head over.
<a:police:766496921480069160>
very classy
yea now that you mention it
<@722121666641133608>
What do you mean, they're the same picture
Fair and based, on the ground, where all thoughts belong
Here come the boys
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956> we will try :D
yea, that is why I said that im glad to not be living in the USA. 
We need more rehabilitation and less just straight up imprisonment. Sure there are people who can't be part of society (at least if you ask me) because they are a danger to other people, but those are most likely people with strong mental disorders who literally cant really act otherwise, and I think imprisoning those people isnt really the answer.
It also means that prisons tend to take any opportunity to keep people there, because of money.
States are forced to incarcerate a certain amount of people per month, so that prisons are filled. Because the prisons get money depending on how many people are in them. 
So fucking gross
Sometimes im really glad I dont live there
I mean they have "mandatory incarceration rates" in the USA, WTF why would you ever do that
Prisions especially private prisions just create more crime
I mean, yea I dont really mean, locked away in prision, dont really like those either
People can just be the worst. Honestly people like this do deserve to be locked away forever. If they do such a thing when they are technicians, who knows what else they might be capable of doing
The fact that things like that are even possible serves to show that we somewhat aren't ready for the technology we have today
The Orwellian one apparently
yea, for me its kinda driven by this huge impostor syndrome thing I have where I will think that what Im doing rn is neither what I deserve or what I should have. Then I kinda imagine, everyone finding out, and me losing everything. Though I must admit this hasn't happened anymore for some time.
yes I mean thats commodification for you.
I mean, it doesn't really not in real life. Prison is still something you want to avoid even if you are rich. The injustice just lies within the fact that a rich person will not work to earn money therefore, they need not be outside of prison in order to earn money. So to them it is merely an inconvenience.
true, true
To me the biggest problem is, that for every "normal" person a prison sentence just destroys their life, while rich people can usually keep doing their stuff within prison.
<a:APetForMiku:752996320259604592>
sounds good! Hope you will be alright
I guess, that is one of the very scary parts of becoming an adult. You realise that most stuff in the world isn't build on concrete things but very fragile. I don't know if you can go back, but I guess that there is also power in knowing the truth, because once you know that things aren't so solid, they also become more changeable
it may feel petty or something but I think I would be much happier with my body if I were shorter
I wish I was smaller...
Also I just wanted to visit because its a country that I image being nice to take walks in, which is something really like to do.
Well I did want to visit ireland some time, since a friend of mine wanted to move there soon.
<a:HibikiHug:656221774240808960>
I just sometimes wish I could really hug people over the internet (though that might be a bit akward)
which is really dumb, I dont even get why this is made so complicated...
This is a lot of scary stuff... but I guess now you now where you are at, right? I guess although not a lot that is still something.
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
I hope you will be well
Im pretty sure their answer would be something like "extremists" though that is obviously wrong.
People like that are just the worst honestly
the mum probably
<@!782841825069236236>
Lexi, really you are a woman. 
Because being a woman isnt defined by whether or not you pass,
it is something you have to know for yourself. No one can take that from you. 
Also really even if you don't pass now, that doesn't have to stay like this.
Not being satisfied with how you look can be a motivator to get better in your eyes. 
Just really please ask your self, who you want to pass for. 
Because you have to pass for no one but yourself. And really I think there are so many
people out there, there is bound to be someone who likes you for who you are, or want 
to become.
yea, that was why I stopped arguing.
Ok, I have to ask again, what are you arguing about here? Or did you just want to talk about the similarities between these two events?
Well, yes and no. The difference lies within the details. Hitler planed to do the same, but there was a major difference between the us. and Germany: The region they wanted to invade was part of central to east Europe, invading all of this would have always resulted in a war. My point is not, both are good actually, its rather, comparing both situations if Hitler believed this could work like manifest destiny did, he was sorely mistaken. Also, like I said... I still dont really see what you are arguing here, nor why you feel the need to argue all of this.
I mean I get the take there are just way better arguments for that. It also... idk does not really fit here?
but other than that. Im not really sure what you mean to say with this other than USA bad.
I mean, the fact that he thought that would work, because manifest destiny worked just shows again what a brainlet Hitler really was.
its part of the quadrillionare mindset
yes
I mean there is a good reason I keep a stock of unopened amiibo as my form of pension
well alas, you arent a sigma
But if cryptos are dying thats a really cool thing, that shit eats up way too much energy
Yea, they have been doing that shit for years
not... really? Like I said most of them are just afraid of the side effects. That is not some choice that you do because you believe there is better way, they don't want to be responsible if anything goes bad. I mean we already have way too much stuff that you can not choose, where there is not logical reason, so why not do it somewhere where we can achieve something positive.
I just think parents tend to have way too much influence over what happens to their children in general.
Btw. vaccines don't really kill people, I mean they might, but like only if they are already having problems. Also you dont really have to vaccinate 2 year olds. Most vaccinations start at like 5
The problem lies in the thing that a vaccination can very much have side effect. The chances are slim, but since it is the parents choice some of them would rather not want to live with that choice. I feel like its very much a thing about fear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOPbwV52Ijg
I mean over the years I worked out that im about 30/70 tho im more romantically attracted tho man than I am physically attracted to men, but I am both for woman, which is kinda weird.
But like I said my whole problem for people who see it and are single is, that that tends to reduce relationships to physicality when really that is only a small aspect of a relationship
I guess Kissing? I wouldnt include handholding or hugging/cuddling. I mean I doubt people will have sex in the public, but I guess that if they did that would also be pda
but for me that was a bit more complected than just not bothering.
It doesnt anymore I just still know how it felt when it did
You can get very physical with people you dont even like, but you cant express love if you dont at least have a shread of liking that person
I get why you would think that. But its more a people should just be more considerate of other peoples feelings. There is also the problem that there are people who just want to show off in that regard. I dont know it just does feel kind of bad, because it always does remind you of that stuff. 
But tbf. love isnt really only about displays of affection, and think it is is also a very harmful way to think if you ask me.
On one hand I understand the feeling. 
Especially after being in a relationship where being public about it wasn't possible, it hurts to see other people display it so openly not even considering how that could make other people feel. 
On the other hand, I would want for everyone to just be able to express their love openly but I guess there is a middle way where we are aware if that makes others uncomfortable but can still have those moments if everyone is ok with it.
Well they can say that. Obviously the Eu will not make them by force. But they can deny them what ever benefits they get from being in eu. 
They could also establish a trading embargo, technically but who knows who would truly uphold that.
?
I mean yea, but who is forcing you to see those fanarts
Yea, pretty much.
but that has also a lot to do with how we are socialised to so relationships in media in general.
Well, im not saying that the pda does that. Im saying that single people tend to see that but not the relationship behind that do so. So they try to achieve only that part of a relationship
I mean yes
This way, people feel like this system is stable and therefore because you "shouldnt fix a running system" it is said that this is the best system we have, when in fact that is simply not true
Also, and I think this is a very important thing, by exporting any resource problems that exist in developed countries, those rich companies have effectively made capatalism stable where it matters for them, but unstable where they can suppress an uprising quite easily.
Im not so sure its a majority that is the problem. If you ask me, there is a very small majority that actually profit from all of this, but the trick is that they convinced the majority of people that they could theoretically become them, therefore they feel attacked by anyone trying to do something about the state of being. In that sense it is kind of a backwards egalitarianism where because you could be rich some day, you try to preserve the rights of those who already are.
I guess, its now showing very strongly because we are facing events that demand competence
Or rather, its corruptibility
only recently? Well I'd say actually corruption lies within the very systems that our democracy is build upon.
Well in Germany they (the "Querdenker" it's a dumb "anti-corona" group) threw Trash at Police men and volentiers who were helping at the local desasterside With all the damages caused by the rapid raindall
maybe it is giving them too much credit. but it might also just defuse situations like this. but in my experince that is very person depended and also depends on how far a person is into their anger.
For example your mom probably meant to say that she thinks that all this frustration you fell is just a port of what she defines as normal live because this has happend to her most likely aswell. She might even feel like you complaining about this is invalidating the frustration she might have put up when she had to do stuff she didnt want to do. 
But she didnt say that did she? 
Likewise while you expressed your dissmay adiquitely you did not say what exactly you find so frustrating about this. Its a sitaution where an I-message might be of great use, something akin to: "When you accuse me of being resentful, and dont validate my work that I do for us, I feel as though you dont appreaciate that I both go to work and then help around the house. Maybe you were frustrated aswell with other things, but this does not change the feelings I am having now." 
Dont know, this is a very personal situation, just wanted to give my 2 cents
Well, conversations like this can feel very frustrating because none of the parties really say what they feel or rather where the problem lies.
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
if you contact them (which should be your decision alone) you might still get to know if you might be able to salvage a friend from that group, but It needen't be the case. You should decide for only yourself if these people are worth to be your friends, as this is something only you can decide.
And thats a good thing, a really good thing. It isnt easy to let go, especially if you feel like it is something that feels so substantial to you but sometimes it is very necessary to move forward. It was very brave for you to leave that group, but as I see it, that was very worth it.
Well, that could be the case, but you changed didnt you? It is important to keep a health distance for as long as you dont know, but who knows if your friends havent changed themselves. You know when I younger same happened to me, I was in a very edgy group a lot of people who where, after I how I see it now, just way to angry at the world. Back then they would get into infighting all the time, sweared at eachother and so on. I then kinda faded away from that group, tho I never really lost contact, I only really didnt show up anymore (they ware based in Ts back then) Then I joined a local meetup where I found some new friends, and decided to go with them to a convention. One of those old friends wanted to go there aswell, so also because of financial reasons, I invited him to come with us. All in all that was a very good decision since I got to see that he, while still mayorly edgy was a good person, and after all also kind of a good friend. I then kept contact for a while and after some time, he abandoned his edgyness completely. 
I guess what I want to say with this is: People do change, sometimes for the better sometimes for the worse, if you are curious how they are doing do check on them, but make no promise to them or to yourself to "come back", I didnt at all back when my friend got better. I still hang out with him but I dont with the other people who used to be there. And when I see something toxic happening, I just leave.
Indeed I am not, I think that problem is deeply entwined with the nature of online communities because of their nature of savespaciness.
Isnt the underlying discussion more about why these sort of people feel a need to defend something, that to them should not matter at all? Because I feel like there is a discussion about masculinity here that we might be able to have.
Depends on whether you have an AC or not and also very dependend on your isolation
I mean the discussion has long since moved from what I wanted to talk about anyways. I dont really know anymore where the goalpost is anyways.
I mean yes. But it isnt wishful thinking to assume that authors who are the gender of the character they are writing are more likely to treat them not as objects to be sexualized. Ofc that isnt the case for all women, nor is the oppisite true for all men.
well, I mean, we dont know. Its a very speculative idea. if capitalism never existed, or for that matter the current idea of masculinity. We just dont know. But we do know that these systems have an effect on this kinda stuff. So I guess we agree on that, kinda.
Well, yes but a lesbian author will normally put more emphasis on the person that is sexuality rather than just have the character in because she is hot.
Probably yes, but that again feeds into the whole masculinity stuff, because you can bet the person who thought "I want a hot girl in my work" and also thought that that constitutes her being seen as sexualised was a man writing that.
Well, no, the sexualisation of underage characters is definitely something that is done especially in anime, because it drives sales, of merchandise.
I mean, the age yes but the sexualizazion I highly doubt.
Well, I guess that is after all also a capitalistic problem.
people just noticed that having cute underage characters that are sexuality drive the numbers up.
The kick start was probably a market trend
yea, important to remember especially in disscusions like this.
no, not really it was more a retorical question.
It isnt ofc
Then the question is, why is that? Has the anime community normalised underage characters being sexualized to a degree that discussing that topic is just normal to "weebs" or is it because "weebs" are more culturally developed?
because these people see this sort of stuff as their "turf" their, if you will so their safty net when the world becomes too much for them, it becomes an integral part of their identity. When people then at the same time hold conservative ideas or are just very used to the current state of anime, they tend to see nothing wrong with the portail of women in anime, therefore defending it to the teeth, because for them it is just an attack on their "turf"
Yea, things kept happening I think he had a whole mental breakdown
ok
ah
whats a pos?
Must admit tho, Onision is a pretty scummy dude.
Never got the appeal of these "preacher" style channels even back then tho.
but makes sense
yea was confused for a second
took me quite a while, and being slapped by my brother to get out of that
Oh, I never got these guys even back then. I was more in the lane of Thuderfoot and the whole "asshole Atheist" community
yea, especially when she is portayed as someone who does not know what she is talking about, which isnt really true, but that would require actually looking at the content yourself instead of consuming it from a second source.
Really for me it was alot of frustration back then that I just didn't know how to direct and who to direct at. I mean I even knew back then it was all a capitalist ploy but thats beside the point. Point was I just looked for an easy scapegoat and for a while extreme religious people were an easy target of people who really were doing something wrong. But I didn't notice the shift really from extremists to people who really did see a problem that nowadays I see myself, so I just started equating the two groups.
my mother is a feminist my father a communist, im a transgirl myself, I think it can hit everyone. Though if I had realised I been a trans back then maybe that would have changed that but i dont know.
Keep in mind, Sylvanas is not only a woman, but either a ||rape|| or an abuse survivor depending on how you read it so yea...
because they claimed they were going to only do "morally grey" Characters, and than had Sylvanas literally slaughter hundreds of people
Well, it was more obvious when it came more in the spotlight. It was a major talking point since bfa actually
well, yea
because yikes the whole writing around sylvanas and women in general in wow is just, the worst.
also the writing cant be worse thatn wow's is
I think I will refrain from going further into this because i'd just be ranting for way to much and I don't think this is the place for that.
ah yea right that was the tree in hyjal
I mean both tbh. although the writing stuff would be tolerable if it weren't for the fact that it is part of a wider problem.
Honestly I just have so much pend up frustration with this because I have been playing that game since 2006 and there were so many good opportunities to do something good with this character and they just have been put aside I mean I guess I now at least partially know why.
Honestly Sylvanas didnt do much for the overall story after her ||suicide|| until legion where she becomes the warchief of the horde (which is one of the two major factions in wow) she then doesn't do much for that expansion other than trying to steal an artefact that would have given her the opportunity to make herself immortal. But really that whole story line goes into noting because she is stopped by someone. Then in bfa she begins the expansion by burning down Nordrasil, which is a world tree which houses the night elf population, so she literally killed thousands of  innocent civilians because she said that if they didn't strike first the others would eventually because they too want the ressorces they want (but for other reasons). And overall she just keeps doing things that put both factions into peril because at the end of the expansion it is revealed that she doesn't really want the horde to succeeded she only really wants people to die because turns out, when she died all the way back then after the second expansion she met up with "the Jailer" a powerful being from the afterlive that wants to escape its prison. Sylvanas pledges loyalty to him because she thinks he will break the machinery of death or something idk. that last part is pretty recent and not that well explained.
True, but to understand whats the problem with Sylvanas you have to understand where she came from. because especially her origin story is important to understand why this is such a travesty of a character arc.
I mean we dont have to go that far in order to see the shit show that is Sylvanas Character writing.
Sylvanas used to be a high elf and tried to defend her home from the undead who eventually caught up with her. 
The commander of the undead killed her, but instead of doing that normally he turned her into a banshee, which is a hurtful and agonisingly painful process, because the sould unlike raising the dead is still alive and conscious while the soul of the victim is ripped apart. Then, he left her in the conscious state while forcing her with his power over the undead to do his biding. After Sylvanas freed herself she sought revenge on the man who had killed her, and after a while he did die. Problem was at this point, the writers at blizzard were not smart enough to write her autonomous so she ||committed suicide|| because after the man who had brought her all this pain was gone she had nothing to hold onto anymore (you know except like the whole faction she build up, her loved one, who even at this point still existed) and then the stories diverge, because after bfa they rewrote what happens to her after she ||committed suicide|| shall I continue?
Ok, that doesnt even cut it
No, the "when will you learn" guy was someone else
Nah got no clue, then again I really cant be bothered into even looking into how people caught wind of that. But you are right ||CwC should go to jail for that||
big content warning do not read if faint of heart:|| she basically raped her own mother. Because the mother is dementend and cant give concent nor can she really fight back||
I read about it, and well... now I need some hot coco, because that shits just too much.
Misgendering is never ok, people might be bad but that has nothing to do with their gender.
In the past they would use pr and smear campaigns to get around this but nowadays, disney is just so big that it doesnt even matter anymore.
yea they are just big enough that they dont really care anymore
Just saying.
All Companies are inherently.
Now Im way confused but ok.
ah ok so I guess thats 280?
But its still possible that such a translation has a different meaning as was intended by the original. Such errors occur all the time. What chapter was that from exactly?
Ah ok never mind then.
The Words dont map all the time, so sometimes you have to come up with something that makes sense in english while still conveying the meaning of the original which sometimes requires just kinda making up stuff.
well because both are probably fan subs and translating Japanese into English can have drastically different meanings.
Though changes in either direction like this have been made numerous times. for example in evangelion the relation ship between Kaworu and Shinji was kinda changed when they translated a line in a romantic way which in the original Japanese wasnt.
Nor is it really attraction. Like of course you can admire someone you find attractive but admiration alone does not constitue attraction. Well that is of couse if the translation is correct.
Well thats just dumb then. Admiration isnt really love now is it?
of course it is
For example I used to hate school and thought that being in school would always suck, but well when I started my apprenticeship I was matched into a class consisting of primarily other nerds which were all cool people.
Point is, like Melua said if you can find a group that you share hobbies with that is a very good thing that can lead you a long way.
And I'd say having friendgroups in real life is neat and all, but It really does depend how well they function. Over the years I've been in many semi rl friend groups (semi in that regard that they had met online but tended to meet up in rl aswell from time to time) And those tend to be pretty cool if you can find one you fit in. But well if you are like me and you tend to fail to commit to such groups you tend to still stay out of them. I'd like to think that that has become better over the years, but really I still question alot if I fit into certain groups or communities all the time. Sorry that was a bit off topic there.
Also I do think that uni can define who you are as a person to a great deal. But I do agree that its radically different from what you will probably experience for the rest of your life.
It's Not because it is so super exiciting it's Just hanging Out and being able to be there together
Yea, Last weekend I had the first meetup since corona that wasnt online and it was just way to cool.
Also we should not understate that espacially if you dont know that person for Long Meeting With them for the First Time offline can be at least somewhat scary
I mean I tend to go to pretty gar lengths Just to See some people If I really like them like take a train through the country far
its for the best I think.
I guess? though tbh. the fall of the roman empire had more to do with inner conlict than the "germanic" tribes. But anyways. The point is, whenever people tend to compare themselves or others to this kinda stuff I get the feeling that they themselves think of their own as "important" historical figures which, actually is very harming and makes me kinda afraid what these people are capable of doing in the name of their cause.
As someone who lives in germany and knows the history I get readily wary when someone tries to identify their movement with the superficial elements of the roman empire.
Well yes. Gamer gate was essentially someone calming that a man could not have written a positive review of a game unless the creator of that game would have slept with them.
Gamer gate was a a buzz word used by different crowds to mean different things, but essentially it is the point the alt right took off and the point where "gamer" culture was firmly consolidated as anti female
Thats like the funny thing with me. While  I did pick up a lot of the rhetoric from the anti feminist crowd I never became part of the alt right or hated on people. So I guess you were right in what you said about the luxury of growing up with the right people, because the biggest reason I always resisted becoming a truly shitty person was because Im a communist, and I used to be back then as well and reconciling that with gamer gate is pretty much impossible
Btw. im not advocating for domestic violence here. But I think my brother was somewhat right and I think at that point it was the only thing that would have woken me up.
But the thing is, I had the luxury of growing up with good people, I still developed into a person that would hate on "sjw"'s for quite some time, because I just felt they were the bad people who wanted to blame their problems on that one concrete safe space I had, which back then was gaming. So I fell really deep in there because I had been introduced in a way, that made me think that the people producing that content were people defending rationality against irrational people. Then again I never did something bad myself nor did I really have trans phobic believes or homophobic ones for that matter. The problem was more that I was stigmatising a lot of people for something they didn't do. I think it was on my fathers birthday when my I talked to my brother and I said a book would be clearly written by an "sjw" he then slapped me explaining how wrong I was for even using that word. In retrospect that was the beginning of me turning away from all of this.
yea I totally get that. but I guess I get both?
Its dumb if you are compelled to dislike someone who you dont even know or because of some superficial reason but sometimes people do make up stupid dumb stuff that you have to somewhat rally against. The problem, then if you ask me is that its hard to see when someone is condemned for an action that is truly horrendous or when someone is condemned for some stuff they did 3 years ago and that they clearly regret and has to be ship-of-theseused in order to be anywhere bad enough to constitute such action. In conclusion: Twitter was a mistake ;P
I mean that would mean that any person who has internalised their oppression is and will always be an oppressor themselves which, wow that would be really stupid to say.
I mean yes there are things that can not be taken back, but if someone is clearly trying their best to be better than shunning them for their past actions is just harmful
yea, but that is how some people think about this. They think that once you have done anything in that regard you are automatically a bad person by default forever.
I dont know to much about vaush but from what I have seen he seems to be rather pro trans rather than a transphobe. I mean perhaps he used to be? But that doesnt change the fact that he is now doing good, even it that were true.
The one about being ||submissive and breedable||
No... bad Rider, we are through with that.
Gun!
So now that we are finished with the vaush debate
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
well they call what they see I suppose
also Twitter bad
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
So in conclusion: 
you all are cool people keep going and strive to be even better than before
All makes sense now
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
wait how can you be a chaser but still think *that*?
though I hope I wouldnt be
Honestly if I wouldnt have been part of the communties I had been, I might still be in that hell hole
Yea that was what I meant, that community kinda "indoctrinated" a whole crowd into this kinda stuff, because they slowly but shurly upped the radicalisation
I mean that is not completely true. Gamegate was more or less the peak of the whole "asshole atheist" crowd being even more radicalized and either they stuck because they just want their games the way they like them or they became part of the alt right or well... they saw that it was stupid and left
Lotsa breadtubers have like rather yikes inducing twitter accounts I feel.
Sometimes I do get the feeling that IRL action is just the only thing that will ever help. Though I want to believe that we can at least matter online a bit by trying to be better and condemning those who should change.
yea...
Well yes it doesnt but the question quickly can become would this person like to see me not exist, when we speak about for example trans visibility so at least to me it makes sense to be somewhat careful whose opinions you declare as safe.
I guess I have just a very different mindset nowadays to how I consume stuff I never really try to emphasise the person behind the work and just try to see it for what it is. Because I dont want to just consume something because its uploaded by that person, I made that that mistake before. If content keeps regressing like it did with Contrapoints I will just move on to someone who makes better content.
yes that was what I said Vyn
It is a pretty dumb excuse espacially since
a. her platform is just too big for her to force down her own personal trauma in regards to politics
b. she doubles down on this so hard if she just said, "look, I wont be able to trust transwoman, because of my trauma, but thats on my laddie" I'd be fine with that, but she didnt she douled down and tried to connect with anyone who was willing to defend her stance, hence why she is a turf.
oh thats a german thing, didnt know there is a diffrence in english tho my bad
Yea Rowling had this traumatic experince when she was younger and since then she couldnt really trust men, and because she has that stupid turf believe that trans women are still arent women (which they are just so we clear <a:transflag:587392684390482016> ) so she sees Trans women as the men she has anxiety about invading her spaces, hence why she is so big on the whole bathroom stuff. 
So shite opinion of a person with way too much reach who then supports people who support her decision just to piss on the parade of trans women. (as you might tell I dont like her that much.)
She did say that it was never specified which... well isnt true. But I get where she is coming from, it would be really weird to be reminded of the color of the skin of characters constantly so we tend to assume they are white since that seems to be "standard"
Nah, while the books state her to be white, Rowling said that she loves Black hermonie which isnt the same as saying she is.
Well No, actually she ist afraid of all men because of This. The Problem in her thinking is that she Sees Trans women as men in disguse invading women spaces
:P
you got those
cute/pretty
Sorry that seemed a bit to much...
wtf... some people are just the worst.
never was never will be
No
its called "spast" there.
Actually there its a slur in german too. Just worded a bit dffrently.
It's Just America needs a working democracy
Tbh it can get much worse
as should wales and cornwall and Scottland and north ireland. but like. we knew that for how long?
yea... that is true.
It kinda is. But the nation that is specifically the most responsible for not doing something about germany is britan. They they ignored when germany became a dictatorship (which mind you wasnt a secret) and also refused to do something about them basically annexing territory. Sure america didnt do something either... and yes they werent also really that big on intervention, but Germany had hardly and soldiers 1933  because they weren't allowed to at that point...

my point being nobody really saved poland from the holocaust, they got that full strenght and no one was there to "save" them. If anything the russians did so when they reconquered the territory. But wait, they also just occupied all that land because they also wanted to kinda annex it. So I mean I do get all the hate for like the rest of europe and the us to a certain degree, from a historical standpoint. But again, that shouldnt really influence the current politics if there isnt something like that repeating or the sorts.
What?
Espacially that last one tho? The allies literally refused to go to war with germany and russia up until germany marched into france, because they saw Poland as a lost cause (which it only really was because of appeasement but whatever I dont want to hate too much on the british they already did enough shit nowadays.)
The fact that you regret it this much, only shows how much you have grown
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
<:ElsaPat:637356110415659063>
mel fanclub is strong
tbf I feel like this a lot too. It gets better over time if I find like those 1 or 2 people I really know I care about and that care about me.
Oh yea that sucks I only been to a desert once but that sucked alot. I think that was in nevada
if that is possible
I mean it doesnt have to be moving in with them. It can also just be moving closer so that visiting can be easier
Or rather it would be very easy for a parent to legally remove you from such a living space
I know it can work for others but that usally requires the approvel of their parents
I guess its not *that* young
I kinda do. Its not legally adult.
I get that. Plushies help me a lot. But nothing ever gets rid of that, I mean other than moving together or something. But from what I heard you are fairly young right?
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
sure is
Thats really good tho im so glad this its the way it is here
Well, but... thats worth a lot I think. Dont play yourself down Matt.
Im Just not sure how much lomger I can keep This to me. But I dont want to.destroy the friendships I.have build.
Espacially when I know it is wrong
It's Not Like I want This to Stop... But im Just tired of always Feeling Like this
I feel Like whenever I Like someone, anyone really it all Happens so fast and I tend to Not think about it at all. I strugle alot With sperating friendships and romantic relationships because I Just tend to Develop feelings for way too many people.
There are people who are just this twisted I suppose
Its probably the extention of that awful tumble community that glorified serial killers
Well its tiktok
Im not really sure they do know.
They literally think that Women are robots. hence why they call them femoids.
Also I find it rather amusing to think that incels would know what women are.
I mean I dont know if you are "a good person" I dont know. But I'd like to believe that everyone has the chance to be, even if we once did bad things. The first step to recovery is finding out that there is something wrong, you know.
Also yea I do not believe that someone would just want to distance themself from you just because you tell them how you feel
Also yea if that is really how it is, then I get what you mean. Maybe you should work on that. Why does this normally happen, if I may ask? Does it start with people truly doing something that you feel is so resentable that you just have to say something?
someone who you can vent to or make those comments to instead of doing it publicly.
Honestly I feel like this is exactly where a friend can help wonders
please dont say that das. Im just sharing my personal opinons.
Also its really normal to not tell everybody everything. And espacially if you feel sad or put down it can be hard to talk about that, but most people dont resent you for sharing, if anything I'd say the ones you do share your feelings with can become your best friends.
I used to. But... I did away with masks a long time ago. I mean I still kinda bury some stuff down if I dont feel save sharing but I just say as I am. I feel like not being honest with myself will just lead to even more bitterness.
The point is I know that but it still hurts. But I rarly talk about that, but sometimes I do and I dont really think it makes me a bad nor a resentable person.
I mean yea it wasnt specifically directed towards you. But I know that most of the time. It still will make me feel like shit but I think that is also kinda the problem. I seek out attention way to much. if I feel like I get withheld from that, I feel like someone is taking that from me, when really I shouldnt be making other people responsible for my own happiness.
Hey Matt I know it isnt easy but maybe I can go first. I cant you tell everything I resent about interactions here, because I feel like that would also be too much but I can tell you what I resent the most. Then you can judge how you think about me. 
- I hate it when people talk past me / ignore what I said instead of talking towards me when I write something it makes me feel like I just annoy people with how I write and what I write
- I hate that sometimes I catch myself writing something that I feel is just something someone else said but repackaged as my own experience because I feel like im just trying to get the main attention, when really im just trying to share how I feel about this
- I always have hated and will always hate how other people will be so much faster to be integrated into a space because I feel like it should be easier, but it isnt for me but somehow it is for them, that does make me resent people like this way to often especially when they quickly befriend people I had to take a lot of courage to even connect to. 

Sorry that was really renty and I know that isnt what the channel is for but, I feel better now honestly. This isnt a *now you have to do it too* thing I just wanted to do it myself, to see if you are right, if that makes other people resent us. perhaps they will, but honestly I doubt it.
It may also help you to structure your thoughts and perhaps find a valid or constructive criticism that you can tell the person you were angry about.
you can even erase it after you have written it but writting it down may help you to clear it off your mind.
if not to a friend, maybe in a personal diary or a text document on your pc
but it can be difficult to do so while keeping your composure. Thats why I sat venting may help
it sounds harsh but... distancing yourself from people you get angry with easily or telling them how you feel can work wonders. In a stable relationship (of any kind) communication of any emotion (even anger) is an important thing to do
well, but in real life or online?
Also do you get angry while reading stuff in here?
Maybe you need to do something similar? Cut down the sources of anger you experince each day?
I used to be really quick to get angry in Video games. I still am. But since Im now not playing any toxic games anymore, its has rapidly declined. And when I know get angry when I play games it is much less worse since I just have distanced myself from that anger over time.
Well, thats ok. But it is something you can work on, if you see it as something that interferes with how you want to be
my point is, whether you are a good person or not is something you have to know of yourself, but ultimately its noting static. Living means to change, and change makes it possible that you can become better. Maybe not overnight but you can try to be. and that is something that I feel you are doing right now.
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Zoe
z: But as Miku said, those arent actions of like the whole best nor the whole of China but rather those who control them.
z: I mean. Yea but also the whole imperalism is kinda also a thing that had a pretty big influence here.
I like to believe that this is still not the fault of entire countries but corrupt individuals that just like to do what makes them more powerful because they are high enough that no one can really touch them easily other than other who are this high which ofc isnt in their own interest.
Ok, so they have enough military might to keep everything together since they have centralised it huh. Hmmm makes sense.
Ok one thing I still dont understand about China: Historically it was made up out of a lot of different dynasties that were really only held together by wet glue. Is that still the case? Is there a risk of China falling into a lot of different smaller states?
From what I know from my mother (who is the vice principle at her school) teaching online is something a lot of teachers are really struggling with, not only because it is a new thing but also because it has some unique drawbacks
which, it isnt in general but it should be.
If your Children get sick in school, school becomes meaningless as a safe place
Well yea tbh. I dont even think that means anything, really. School should be a place to measure performance.
because that sounds like a horrible condition. Even if it may not affect your brother that much synthoms wise Long Covid is still something that can effect even smaller children. Also, because you are in immediate danger. This is just so fucking irresponsible. Like really I just feel so much anger toward those people
Ima be honest is it at all possible for him to get home schooled?
So I guess we are on the same page
I meant that when platforms are smaller they will accept more nsfw content, which helps them grow and then discard it when it threatens to harm their profits.
I suppose
Well its the cycle of platforms
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
I did an apprenticeship as basically a software dev. so, only half our teachers didnt know how to use MS teams
Also all my group projects (bare one of them that I refused to do) where all successes because I had a good core of competent people I could work with (not including me lol, or only sometimes I guess)
As a pupil Online Classes have actually improved my performance in Class since its easy for the teachers to notice who is the most active, and I didnt get as distracted by others.
And thus you can not really adjust the lesson accordingly.
Like how you cant really gauge the engagement the class has with the lesson.
Buuuuuuuuuuuuuut... blaming all of this on gay people is fucking stupid, because I dont think gay people are more likely to obduct boys than straight man are to obduct girls.
I mean, in general, not going with strangers is a good message.
Those damned Straights!
So, if a women does it to a man or a man to a women its ok?
Yea, thats true.
Maybe... but like, the fact that an employee of that company could probably do that if they have the proper knowledge is just... a gruelling thought. I dont think appple would systematically try to eliminate people, just that it gives a few individuals at apple way more power than they should have.
As good as the intend might be, this could very much be a bad thing everything considered because 
a: Who says Apple wont report back false reports because they wanna put dirt on someone, if it isnt there later, they can just claim that they deleted it
b: Who regulates if the algorithm that does this is actually able to find Child Porn instead of you know, Elephants or anything else? 
In general I dont think we should give companies as much power over us as we are currently doing
maybe that discussion can be had in <#337805317276565525>
We are getting very off topic now
Im pretty sure its a part this wouldnt make sense otherwise given the context.
Yes, but we havent, now have we?
For you it might be logical to you that the critics of something are the better side to take, but you need to have the knowledge about the whole thing in order to have that opinion. For someone from the outside looking in, venting about other people of a sided debate appears very antagonistic. And yes, I also think this is something you should have probably more talked about with a friend or perhaps even someone of that same critic community.
of being really anything.
They did try to point out the flaws with your argumentation, but nobody accused you.
Well, Vyn, like I said, nobody is trying to hurt you here. But you are right now acting irrationally angry Nobody accused you of being "a fucking conservative". And nobody is trying to shut you down. Thats not how we roll here.
Ok, lets just step back a second here: While this is Serious discussion, there is no need to get at all angry or mad about any of this; Nobody wants to harm you here.
me, sorry I missunderstood something
Well, Harris can also make mistakes I'd think.
I dont know, I thought is was kinda cool, but I think it was ok since it was self contained in that one season. (well not completely but mostly.)
moffat tho...
But I get what you mean
yea but Doctor who actually resolved the plot
but as much as everything on Hbomberguys channel is I suppose
Or well to some degree they are
They arent memes tho.
No Im just saying that I will not see this video as a part one for as long as a part 2 doesnt exist, because to my knowledge there may never be a part 2.
Serious lore anaysis
I suppose you havent.
have you seen SLA:3?
I mean yea but with Hbomberguys track record that part 2 may never come out
?
The video is 2 and half and hour btw.
And thats 100% the best idea
I can only say that even if Harris the person, used to have an awful opinion about Monty the video really doesn't.
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
Hey Matt. It's ok.
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
You told us about something that eats you up inside, sharing this must have taken an enormous amount of courage, Matt. Feeling like this doesn't make you a bad person, nor are you any less likeable to us. You are worth, being here, Matt.
<@84811738653929472> <:Zababies:672238628398956594>
We use chrom but... How is this a serious question?
Damn, what happend? Will she be alright?
I mean I should know, I got moderna well the first shot anyways, second is this friday
I think so? I mean I think it means that more blue cells are produced and therefore you can withstand an infection easier. but also might mean that it takes longer for the body to accomidate
It's good to become more self reliant and it's also good to become so in a rather safe environment, but if you ever need encouragement or advice, we will be here!
Ok, I also hope Gwen is ok
I wholeheartedly disagree. People just need to learn to isolate themselves from the toxic people in their lives, and there needs to be more possiblitly for people who cant do that to do so. Because you reach out your hand to people and if they dont take that on, that honestly that is them.
while I agree that people should get what they deserve just going around and punishing them yourself just makes it seem like the person you want to satisfy is yourself. (Not that I would think that but really it makes it seem like this) For as what you should do: report them to the authorities.
because... well, doing so would mean that you alone are the arbiter of whats right or wrong.
Honestly having just one ruler sounds not like a good solution to any of this
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Well isnt that just the same thing just the other side of the coin?
Yup! Always remember, this isnt normal, this is wrong. Because that is what they wish you wouldnt belive
I mean of course normal people are against fascists, If I recall right, their goal isn't necessarily to over take with these "protests" its to normalise their presence because if they are normal they can do way more than when they are seen as what they are.
At least some good news
Oh yea that might be, I meant breaking contact with those individuals completely
That was what I meant tho, if we all isolate ourselves from these people and help those who can not do this (due to financial instability for example) we can isolate those people.
Yes, but it protects the people who need your help. Going around and punishing people will, in the worst case just make everything worse because their might be retaliation. Im not saying you shouldnt fight back if someone is hurting you specifically, or threatening you.
if you dont thats good
thats all
I felt like it was going in that direction.
doing that is all but healthy
Please dont make this into a contest
Giving anyone enough power to just punish people like this, means giving people enough power to hurt others, badly
Because there is no garantie that the "us" you are speaking of, doesnt change.
If everyone can do a bit, we can all move forward together
Thats why we decided to get involved in party work with the left party here, we want to have a postive impact on our city and (at least we) think that we can start doing so this way.
no clue honestly
Who says a ruler would?
<:ElsaPat:637356110415659063>
this isnt something you need to do alone
But, really your parents would probably want you to tell them about this, so you can both work through this together
I get that
its important to know when that is the case, but I'd say most parents want to rather know so they can help their child
some parents are just like that
I know
Being bullied can happen to anyone and admiring thats something that affects you should never be considered a "weakness"
Your parents wont be disappointed in you for being bullied, why should they be?
<@!457268466429329429> Z: yea... That was back in Highschool. In middleschool while we were bullied we knew there where people who cared about us. But in highschool, that changed and nobody seemed to care about us, and honestly that hit us pretty hard. Espacially since it werent only the other students that were ignoring us it was also the teachers
I mean... yes you can. Or at least you could allocate the same amount of resources that are spend going into war zones fighting the results of the hurrican or helping victims of covid
Ima be honest Meele is just one community of players where I think it actually makes sense that Nintendo doesn't want them be associated with big events, because it also associates them with Nintendo by substitution. 
The reason for that is, a. the community around meele is just ridden with drama other stuff that no cooperation would want to associate with. Also regarding what Melua said: I dont think I have ever seen a community so focused on a game that doesnt exist, as to go as far as make it exist because they think that is the game that it was meant to be.
yes it always is, because even if you have the antibodies it is still possible for you to carry the virus around. But if you have been vaxxed once and have gotten the disease once too you should be good for quite some time, but maybe you can still call a doctor and ask them if they could make an immunity test in order to be sure
I mean thats how it works in austria apparently, no clue how it is in the usa
From what I heard about 6 months. but I think you are supposed to go to the doctor after 3 months to let them check your antibody density
I know that when it happend I didnt really register it as something noteworthy but keep in mind I was 6 and lived in germany. But I heard my brother and parents actually did take this in very seriously.
It would take away a huge market for esports, which might actually be a positive thing tho.
Honestly... a lot of our history knowledge ends at the end of ww2 and the rest is very german centric, but I assume thats kind of the same for most countries history lessons.
I see.
then again germany isn't really nice to the rest of Europe (economically) either so it somehow checks out
I dont really wanna shit talk a whole country but... yea
even Churchill wasnt really in on that at first... so really idk
but even that is kind of in the shadow of the appeasement strategy
I mean I guess
When has it ever?
I think it's too present and that it should be somewhat restricted but I think forbidding it absolutely not a good idea
all you can really do is just report the video
It wont show up tho
And the not so meaningful fanservice becomes almost an inevitablity
Neir is kinda debatable but when we take a look at anime meaningful depictions of sexualisation become very rare
The whole problem with the male gaze isn't only the way it looks at woman but also the way it teaches men to see the world
The male gaze is part of a work that explains how movies are shot in a way that looks at woman like a man is "supposed to" even when the camera isnt even a stand in for anyone's gaze
Yea feeling never stops
Then why not stay at home just do nothing from time to time you know there is nothing wrong with that
Because it requires lotsa introspective
It took us 3 years to realise what makes us happy it's not an easy feat
I do actually get what you mean
I know
Lots of this sound like expectations you made up for yourself. Wel apart from moving in with your partner
See that's the problem you did what you were supposed to do, but what did you want
Most people don't just make a decision like this over night
I figured as much
And you probably can't do that alone. Please do seem serious medical help
So you plan of taking your life huh.  Only thing I can really say is ... Are you out of your mind? Sure things might be bad but what you need isn't release it's a perspective that allows you to see your way out
Also please do not feel like you can't vent like that. If you want to you can always dm us
Life isnt about destination it's about the journey work only as much as you need to, and do what you feel makes you happy
But I also think that certain circumstances can prevent us or hinder us from being happy
I think life can get better, but it does not get better by anything happening to you it only will be better if you do something about it
Hey you need to talk about this kinda stuff
So you are asking, what the point in all of it?
Im Here im listing to you
And how did you feel about that?
When you can't you can't it's as simple as that
Im with gwyn Here, while I get the expectation you don't have to be like that with us
I don't feel like crying anymore I did that enough, and I feel so happy when I do. Happiness doesn't happen to you, you have to shoot it free
Sometimes you wanna cry but
And sometimes it's hard
Which doesn't mean I'm encouraging you just, I think living on is as much a decision we have to take on even if subconsciously
I know that's a controversial thing to say and I don't want you to do that, but at the end, this is your choice
Not you know
I meant don't do anything
Oh
Then don't do
And that does feel good
I know it sounds banal but that way I can lose myself
I can just lay on the bed listen to something and get lost in the music
Sometimes tho
If they can vent to you surly you could vent to them
Ask them if you can vent
Talk with people about this stuff
Not the way you say the way you need
Take care you dummy
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
Im people too
Just you
Of you
Not of anyone else
No what we wanna hear is that you take care of Yourself
The end is when you decide. But you don't have to be as drastic as you Imagen.
And yes that is emotional labour but you can't expect to only help and never let anyone help you
You shouldn't tho you need to talk about stuff like this
You know I feel what you need is to vent and talk more about this.
You don't have to forgive people also. As a medic there are standards you need to hold up to
Nah
So you are angry? That everyone around you expects you to hold it together when you feel they can't?
And its an appartment building the person would have to break into the building first and then into the apartment's themselves
We dont lock doors here, but you cant open them without a key anyways.
I see
Maybe thats a language thingy, we call people anti social here if they dont do social stuff. for the things you described we use asozial
Oh... I mean yea actually that makes sense
yea also, still what do you mean they want to stop antisocial behaviour its not their business why I dont like interactions with them.
Wtf, like you mean if I stay in doors all the time there might be an officer knocking on my door like
"Oi, laddie why you hanging in here, get some bloody fresh air mate or I'll end your bloody live"
On antisocial behaviour?
it doesnt. Unless you a company is printing the money a goverment can never really go "broke"
Oh... wait
And like we said, we wont bother you unless asked to.
That is totally fine, take the time you need.
Yea, we got through that too. It isnt easy but if you keep at it, it is defenitly possible with a bachelors degree
If you dont want people to speculate on that, you should have probably made the reason more clear. But anyways keep on being we wont bother you, but just know we are kinda annoyed how you left. Because it did leave a lot of room for why you did so, and the way you did was all but a good one, next time, if you feel like leaving (which honestly is your choice) I'd would be cool if you didnt just, you know, be a jerk about it again.
But I think its a definition thing
yes you can. Its just that a lot of nonbinary people are also experiencing dysphoria because the way their body is, is generally different from how they see themselves so, while it isnt mutely incusive, most people would say that living out your gender as nb is strongly linked with being trans
I dont think that is the case actually since China has a pretty hard grip on their populations growth, also keep in mind you can only really run into a dempgraphic crisis if you have a demographically dependent care system
Yea, I think the problem for them is less expression itself but disruption
I mean of course you are, but there is a huge difference between influence and moral degradation. And I mean the difference or the argument with video games is specifically that since you choose what you do in them, and since there are games where you choose to be evil in a capacity which you could not do in real life without expecting consequences. So I think that is the reason Video games are often picked of instead of Movies or books. (Although this is false equivalent since  choice is at the core of any medium, but movies and books get banned for portaing being evil as good, while any game that allows you to be evil is to those people a possible moral degradation)
I guess that does make sense from their twist world view, but I mostly just meant to say that it is quite ridiculous to think that a video game degrades the morals of its player.
I mean moral degradation in that case is just a euphemism for being critical of the government or the establishment at a whole, well I guess they also mean it quite literally but that is even more ridiculous
Deciding between right and wrong encourages critical thinking, and that is something a fascistic government wouldn't be so fond of
sorry that wasnt very serious
If my gender is being sold does that mean Im agender now?
Well, I was speaking very generally, with good or close friends I think that it can be very much worth asking them the question of what they value about you. It should be noted though that asking what they like about you can be very easily misunderstood. It is very important that if you ask such questions you are very exact with what you want to know. E.g. not asking "What do you like about me?" rather ask "What about our friendship do you value", the reason for this is that the first one is rather vague in what you mean, but the second question leaves all but none way of misinterpreting what you want to know.
maybe more the aspiration to be one, but yea
No problem, you're welcome
Rather I would try to do good things, or deeds
I wouldn't say that is exactly how it works, but I think its about right. Just... dont put to much stock in being a good person. I dont think being a good person is often a thing worth being, since its so radically different depending on who you ask.
If it is a consoltation to you, I dont think they would be nice to you if they thought you were a bad person.
Well I wouldn't say it sounds stupid. It just sounds like you aren't sure of yourself and would like for others to tell you what they like about you. From personal experience of being of either side of this: People don't usually think in the way "I spend time/I am nice to them" because of the way you are. Most people can easily tell if they have fun spending time with someone, but putting your finger on the why is oftentimes really hard to do. It also requires the separation of the own needs for connection from the question why exactly you like being around a person. 
tl;dr: People probably *do* like you for who you are, but they wont or rather cant easily tell you what that is.
im pretty sure the point is that Noelle would rather appreciate it that people are nice to her because of who she is and that sometimes someone just being nice to you because you are to everyone feels kinda empty
also you meant to do Hieroglyphs right?
in order to print(money) you need lotsa ressoruces
turns out
but it is not really a good thing
its called cryptocurrency
Actually programmers did do that
I think the biggest thing we have of the sort is the 9.11 when we remember the jewish people killed in the atrocities at the "Reichsprogromnacht"
All politics are inherently dumb because most of it is democratic
Thats super good!
I'd rather be able to say goodbye, so I say I'd want to know
Which is a us state I assume?
I see.
Maine as in... france?
What is the opposition to the Holocaust? Are they supposed to teach Nazi ideology or what? Because believe me that stuff is not only wack but also super boring
Hasn't Britain been on fire since like the last how many years was the brexit vote ago?
and I also think many more of these mechanics do exist, but probably worked into some indie titles since they mostly tune out more personal stories
I think a ptsd mechanic could work in a video game. but im just spitballing
No, I dont think you sound dismissive, Noelle
Sorry I really messed up by not putting a can't there, It was meant to be an anti generalisation statement.
Yea, I don't think you can't just generalize anything really in a way that you could say: this should never be in a game/novel/movie, but execution does matter.
I guess, but don't you know what I mean? I wouldn't want for example DID to be a cutesy mechanic wherein a character just switches between different personalities to gain an advantage in lets say combat.
No, I didn't mean, this shouldn't be a game mechanic, rather I meant, this probably shouldn't be a game mechanic in the service of fun.
Yea I mean, in the context of entertainment, Mental problems probably shouldn't be game mechanics, because they aren't fun, and displaying them as such would be kinda disingenuous.
and in a land where you can get a gun in a supermarket I guess thats just easier
the point is you'd probably have to commision it
or barrels rather
You can have a fake gun with rounds
and with guns it just doesn't make sense.
espacially knives should never be real.
Props exist for a reason
No even that
I have a problem with both. Both is unsafe.
yes
I mean thats only because they feel they *need* to incorporate inefficient blockchain technology into the whole mix, tho then again I think there is to much of a crowd who is very disillusioned with authority but they thing that the solution is always more privatisation/less regulation which then often leads to stuff like this.
the basic concept it, that it is like a receipt that you own something, though what that is, can be totally arbitrary like the first twitter post
You know you're both just more or less are talking beside each other right?
Which, isnt my opinion, but I think that is what it boils down to
Even in jest.
The whole point was just, we probably shouldnt call for the killing of any ethnic group even those less oppressed
At least that is what I got from it
No, just... what outside meant is that saying a certain subgroup of people belonging to a bigger group can not justify action against the bigger group meaningfully, and calling for such an act mimics the tactics of fachists.
Guys please chill down, really I mean I get what Outside means, but still I dont think Matt was even at the slightest serious with that
so I think that might be a reason.
I mean schools as are neighbourhoods do tend to be very segregated in the us. from what I know
I guess what I wanted to say with this, I can see that happening, because I know there are teachers out there who just want to humiliate their pupils into submission
and we were just being "difficult"
basically told us the bullying that had been happening to us didnt exist
In our case they werent racist towards us, but they basically took us out of class and told us how wrong we were, made us cry and continued on as if nothing would have happend
though no clue if that is better or worse
then again, teachers have done simlar things to us, though that was in a private room off the class
... yea that is true. I dont even get though how anyone can even think such stuff is even remotly ok
It absolute is. Like that is like going to class in blackface and expecting anyone to sit tight
and I guess that is indirectly doing harm
I guess I would say the harm isnt caused by her, but rather she facilities an environment where such harm is more acceptable
https://discord.com/channels/336297387863703552/336297840529899522/901285179597926401
it starts here
Yea, you could probably just say, this joke makes me feel uncomfortable I would appreciate if you wouldn't do such jokes in the future or something.
I know hot take
but I also think that in general, disliking genocide jokes is probably a good thing
Yea pretty much
The content wasn't bad but I agree that it was very clumsily argued.
Ok, Outside made his point pretty clearly so im pretty sure we can you know, move on.
dont just argue over nothing, or change the point we need to stay on focus
But again, I ask you, what are you even arguing about
I guess so, that is true.
It might exist, Outside, but not to a degree that matters.
You are, correct, They were. Although like with all white supremacists who is white is always up to their own definition.
And, tbh. while I agree that white woman are probably a group that gets oppressed way less than other groups, this sort of humour can still desensitise, and that is more the problem.
The problem is, outside is german, so am I. We tend to have a hightened sensitivity to such jokes because, well its kinda endrenched in our culture
but you could also be like decent and just respect that seeing such jokes makes someone uncomfortable
I mean ofc that would be a way to slove that
Im not fucking victim blaming you, obviously, what you said is right, I just cant stand when people drag on needless arguments for the sake of making points that will probably only lead to others being either bored confused or in the worst case disliking you afterwards.
I meant be done with your argument with outside
I didnt mean, be done with the issue at hand, as you say that probably wont happen
Than make that clear!
Clearly state your problem, with the others argument, and be done with it
I mean you aren't wrong the problem isn't, that you see a problem that doesn't exist, Hectan. It's that the methodology you think will change that either won't or will do so at the cost of a vaguely defined other
Not to speak of the fact that no one should have the ability to just you know legally kill people
Life isnt always fair, but sometimes it is quite amusing
funny story actually the guy who bullied us in middleschool, failed to become a window cleaner.
A scam?
And, yea I think you are right. Armis (no clue who is fronting) the values we have do tend to influence our discussions immensely
especially since convincing anyone that they are wrong in a discussion is pretty dang hard.
Yea, I guess you are right. Im just trying to be constructive about stuff like this. Generally speaking people in here won't try to attack people from how I feel about them, so trying to understand what they mean rather than trying to convince them that they are wrong seems to me to be the best course of action
And, I think that does apply to alot of people who discuss in here.
I do also think, that alot of situations that happen in here where people get stuck disscussing with each other could be solved rather easily by just taking a step back and reconsidering what has been said and what you feel misunderstood on.
Seriously Vyn even if stuff was bad back then, does that really mean that doing something bad is ok? Stuff doesn't become ok to do just because context changes. It might seem more ok but at the end of the day, Slurs are slurs and bullying kids for content is just that.
Nag, you're not helping at all rn.
I don't think that more moderation would solve people getting pissed at each other while discussing stuff in here.
Tbf. even if they did watch all channels 24/7 what can you do in a situation like this? A moderator doesn't want to just punish people for discussing either.
Oh yea, idk. it does happen from time to time in here, I know that much, but I try to deescalate if I can tho, truth be told, that isn't an easy thing to do either.
Because I didn't mean being non-confrontational as in don't talk with people you have a problem with, but rather to step back and try to find the best solution to a given situation. Even just for your own sake, as stepping back can help you not be a part of ugly situations like this.
wait do you mean in like, people who tried to be non-confrontational didn't succeed in that
or
people were non confrontational and that was a problem distinct from lashing out on others?
I know it isn't easy to step back from a situation like that, especially when the confrontational behaviour feels more natural to you, but honestly that is exactly why I'm saying it needs to be done, because doing this is trying to unlearn a toxic part of our society one that, we should all strive to get rid of if possible. And it's not like we don't struggle with doing this as well, I know we get upset about this too but we learned to at least somewhat deal with this over the years.
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
for him probably
well
Profit
The should be able to provide you with legal help as well
Cases such as this should I think go before the "Arbeitsgericht" I think the "Arbeitsamt" can hook you up on how to do that, since it is their jurisdiction
Sorry that was a lot but this kinda weighs pretty heavily on us, tho I think this is much worse on the picture side of the fandom than it is at the story side of it.
<@!238855496797257729> The problem with writing gay characters straight is that ,a they already are a minority being claimed by a majority at that point which, does kinda hurt a lot when you particular like that about the given character. And I didn't really talk about a well written fanfic I specifically meant when the fanfic is just "this male character that is a self insert, meets up with established sapphic character and basically "fucks" them straight. The point is, most of these characters don't have a given sexuality that is stated anywhere definitely (because mostly Symphogear isn't about sexuality) So it can be very easily argued that those characters even those who are clearly attracted to a same sex partner could be bisexual. Yet the problem is, that often they aren't recontextualized as being bi, but rather are assumed to just be straight or to be made straight by the act of meeting a "superior male". The problem is more so that often sexuality isn't the subject of these stories, on the contrary often times this shift of the source material is glossed over to focus on the sex itself, so as to speak its objectification. That is my problem with writing a story that is "just" self insert sexual fiction between an established Sapphic character and a men because most of the time it just ends up being an objectification of a minority group for the express entertainment of the majority group.
They are just different ways of looking at the world
No what solo meant was more in line that they are separate from each other, so claiming one can explain the other is probably not a good idea
You know since that is very opposed to Jesus's teachings
I mean the underlying question was, can a Christian that tries to make cash with their religion be still considered a Christian?
Really? I always thought they did. Hm
I mean that country still exists it is just really small
That is true, though I must admit at times I do think pope Francis does share some wise words, still probably not a good person but still
I see it like this, a religion is a way to express your faith, and when you try to use that faith you have for your own gain, you are setting up a false equivalent where you think that just because your faith is strong that means you may take money from others to share your faith.
Is being Christian not just a label then, without any meaning? If anyone can be a Christian who is part of a Christian denomination then that becomes the defining factor doesn't it?
May I speak frankly, Mel?
It was just about him being uncomfortable about that
The problem here from what I gather was:
Matt dislikes that in November people tend to post stuff about their sexual tendency in channels not meant for that. That is basically all I think
But we are specifically talking about a space where there are rules against this
I'm sorry if I see that stuff or any other rule broken I will tell a stuff member if any are online and not on busy. Because, yes they are human that is why I let them know because they can't see everything
That is why that seperation exists why should a "Meme" change that?
And I don't want to retreat because some people just can't keep that in the nsfw channels
My stance it if there are rules for non sexual content on the server that obviously you shouldn't talk about that stuff there
Also at least to a male body masturbationbcan be actually healthy. But I'm on Matt's side here as long as the space you share it in isn't a nsfw space, you really shouldn't talk about these habits. Otherwise it's totes fine
The important thing is that you don't use enhancement words like "can you explain to me *again*..." as they tend to make your chatting partner feel like you think they are stupid
So for example: someone just said something that didn't relate to your point, you may ask "can you explain to me, how this relates to my point?"
Also your tone of voice irl might make you less snarky
Because irl people just get used to stuff. Online too but you have done people who are still critical
I'm not sure that is something you can do overnight. But I guess going over what you said and reviewing it with another person might help
Text can convey tone it just is done differently for example by choice of words
I do have to agree. Though I don't think it's normally that bad in casual situations
But I agree that that might just be text not conveying the original tone
"It‚Äôs not that goddamn deep" sounded very snarky to me for example
Yea that is very much true snark seems to be what gets you in some of these situations quite easily.
Yes, it makes sense. At least to me it does
That's why he seems so distraught
I think that is the problem Yumi, Matt doesn't know when he is or what others would or wouldn't consider snarky
Because contrary to common believe even kids in this age don't act like this without rime or reason
What I want to say is perhaps finding out why your brother acts like this is more important than trying to stir him on a right way
I feel like when children act like that at this age there is a specific reason for it tho it may be rather banal, but it could also be an onset of early depression I know my brother acted, well kinda like that.
I feel that at least in part others perceive you being snarky alot and start identifying that with how you are
Reduce the amount of snark you use I in general I guess?
Because people do tend to read into what others write even if it's not obvious especially then when they think there might be something hidden in tbere
the friendgroup we had back then used to be an echo chamber for that kinda stuff
Funnily enough
I remember this did happen to us
Or people who are persuade by others that they need to defend something or that others are just "crazy"
but that isnt nessarly a bad thing
That isnt really true it would just mean that the concept of a good or bad person wouldn't exist.
from our experince, people can change a lot actually
you know
since
Rather than would it be possible to eliminate the bad people
I think the far more worth question to ask is, is there a way so that the bad people can affect the other good people less?
If you see it like this, isn't toxicity an inherent part of society as a whole just in online communities it is easier to remove the humanity from whoever you feel vile towards?
as they will just silence anyone for speaking out about stuff for being "dramatic"
I mean yea, but putting people in charge that are themselves super problematic will just amplify the problem
How would you all go about changing that? I know we did try to do thorough application processes but im not really sure that does it.
And tbh. Discord has not made this better, but arguably worse since now any person can just open up a "server" without any hurdle to overcome.
At least to our knowledge this happens because often these spaces do lack people who will want to step up to these kinda things, except those who want to but really shouldn't.
Honestly one thing that has been bugging us for a while is that often (not always and certainly not here) Online spaces, especially Community servers seem to have the most vile people as moderators or admins. Or rather they tend to be people who just really like having the power and love to abuse it.
But jokes aside, this is peak "these people should never have been moderators in the first place" if you ask me
Gotta hate it when you actually have to respect people around you
yea. Still can remember that time we sat in school and we were kinda playing around with our fat breasts and in retrospect all the signs are very obvious but... the point is, we got made fun of way too often for just being at least slighly different to others.
which sucks hard, if you feel you don't belong there
Yea the worst part about irl stuff is just that you are very limited most of the time by the social cycles you are born or breed into
now we are communist trans people, a gay dude, a transhumanist communist, and the quota straight person. And at least 70% of these people are emo somehow
its also bad for valve because of gambling laws as far as I understand
Honestly, that is probably not an easy to thing to know since most children will actually not tell their parents about bullying since its way too normalized
The reason she doesn't want to go to school is most likely not really linked to participating in school activities, but rather something else, she is most likely feeling rather uncomfortable at school and that is also why she doesn't want to do homework since it reminds her of the inevitable truth that she will have to go to school a place that she despise that's our theory from what you provided anyways
Idk it just read unintentional harsh to me, but if you say so, than I'll take your word
You should probably reconsider your phrasing there, Yumi though I wouldn't say you are wrong, this does read rather demeaning.
But entitlement is often used against neurodivergent and transpeople so, I try not to really go into that myself
yea
I guess
if you are upset that means that you perceived a problem which might be there or not, but you don't get upset over nothing
I mean you arent upset over nothing, you literally can't be upset over nothing
because they would pity someone who has such a problem, but feel as though they are betrayed if it turns out as fake
Mostly just because alot of people have trust issues I think
Tbh. yea
Yea ok. I mean tbh. it thoroughly depends. That sounds very rude, at least how you described it
I mean if you want them to prove its real, then most likely a diagnosis is what you need for most people
Then yea
Especially if they are trying to get that diagnosis and can't seem to get it when they at least somewhat know that something is wrong
Depends? Like if you were already talking about the subject then perhaps not, but if you just do it out of the blue if someone mentions they have e.g. ADHD then I think it might be perceived as rude by that person.
I need to go anyways
I should calm down
would have been my answer
"No, he told me I should tell you that you are a confirmed dick"
that you cant ignore but, well I hope you'll manage
Uhgh that sucks tbh
you shouldnt need to prove your sexuality
Yea still very shitty behavior
that doesnt sound like its a very considerate person
Yea
Did they ask you whether you had a diagnosis for being trans? Because tbh. if thats the case just yeet em
Don't worry I did too.
because they shouldn't generalize their experiences with others or the media to such a degree that they make someone else uncomfortable if unneeded like this
No, not really. its a problem that person has then
which is a problem in of itsself
Its probably not because they don't specifically dont trust you, but in general dont trust people to know what they talk about when they dont have a diagnosis
the problem is that its highly speculative, and most of the time the speculation isn't in your favor
actually happened to a friend of ours since they are pregnant they couldn't be vaccinated till about mid October I think, but before that their test were still free
if you have a reason you can't get vaccinated you can get a permit and you can still test yourself for free.
I know it works similarly in germany now too
yea, all my friends hate NFT's
Then with no shoulder Lenin, perhaps I can continue. Lank, at least from the perspective of a marxist reading of the world, of course if you look at the extreme cases of those two system, they going to be very similar, because they are both part of the same progression, and in Hegelian terms do both contain a master and slave dichotomy. This means that there are 2 opposing sides in both systems who will, over time, antagonize each other since they are both respectively the lowest and highest class in that society. But that is where the similarities end, capitalism's way of distributing power through monetary means is vastly different than feudalisms nepotism brought on through the right to rule through blood. I acknowledge that with inheritance kind does the same in that system, but capital does remain fluent to a degree, and people can (technically) rise to the top from the bottom. But to get towards the discussion that started this whole thing, the reason capitalism can feel like feudalism to a lot of us is because the people who are on top don't stay on top through competition, they stay there by cementing their power through lobbyism and undercutting smaller businesses. The reality is, that we aren't living under capitalism, but that capitalism 2 already exists, maybe even capitalism 4, but it was brought to be by those who have an interest in it being that way and those sadly are for whom the benefit is the greatest. (Most) Capitalist societies we live in, are not purely capitalistic, they rather a mix between Capitalistic, socialist, democratic and neo-liberalist ideas and to my knowledge in that cluster of words Capitalism isn't the biggest problem, neo-liberalism is.
With all due respect, the problem isn't that we don't know how it works.
Yea, the problem is, as long as you can't pay with crypto without reference to another currency, they will stay to be pretty much another stock market.
Yea, I mean of course it has advantages and disadvantages. Like anything really.
So, only once I have bought something with the currency has the currency anything to relate its worth to.
I only get a worth out of a currency once I got what I wanted to trade it into for.
I mean, that is true for any currency, Lank.
Same thing, I once deleted a friend from I think it was league of legends, because I thought he was an old school person who I just used to play with and really couldn't stand. But yea, Tipp for all of you most of these systems have the ability to make notes for friends that helps sorting them mentally
yea, Im not really a proponent of capitalism, so yes. I agree.
that is as if to say you shouldn't let your friends help you so you don't get dependent on their help. Which, yes can happen, but is just a very paranoid way to live.
but that doesn't mean they aren't worth pursuing
yea can't really take that as a valid example. Ofc that is just the general downside of globalisation, once you get cut off, you lose those lines of support
I mean the essentials perhaps, but not everything.
it can and it does lol. there is so much stuff that producing all of it just does not make sense
at least financially
and we are pretty fine off
but that is how germany works mostly
why?
I mean it does yes
as someone who this has happended to trice in life, this sucks, but you can probably just clean the microwave and use her still.
you mind telling us or me privately what happened to you?
Also is this a serious discussion?
Me
but sometimes I just wanna lean back and do nothing you know
if I wanted to have good hot dogs I would broil them and prepare them myself
so can't really cook it
its already with the cheese on top
well, yes but the ones I buy in the supermarket are specifically for doing that
also often times much faster
yea but microwaving has the added bonus of you not needing to clean then pan just the plate afterward
it definitely is heat
friction is the cause for heat there but yea
that wasnt a nice evening
let me tell you
then set myself in the otherroom to continue gamin
We used to have a microwave that was also an oven, so we once put in something to bake and put it into the microwave function by accident for the same time
It should work the same in the Netherlands, but I can only really speak for German law
First of that and it is still them taking money and doing something with the money that he was not supposed to be doing
I mean it is just embezzlement of funds surely there must be laws against that in the Netherlands
Ah ok.
Because at least here such a Club is still a legal entity so it needs to be defined correctly
It is supposed to be? That is at least how it works in Germany unless we are talking like a school club
But I guess that highly depends on the law of the country this did happen in
Normally a club such as this should have a document that states what the purpose of the club is, and unless it was "swimming and investing our Clubfonds in Crypto" this action should be liable
I mean that is a gross Mishandling of clubfunds if I'm not mistaken that is a sueable offence
Lol
which I think is a very different question from, is it reasonable to ask not to be tagged
But that wasn't the point now was it? Yumi was kinda asking why nobody would honor her wish of not being tagged based on her name
Gender is very complicated, and honestly isn't really static for most if we are honest with ourselves. The same way how when we go to bed and wake up again a part of us is now gone and another part has become anew. We are constantly changing, so obviously why wouldn't our gender or rather our identity?
Oh that is very much true, still I would think, we all know Yumi does not like being tagged by now. After all this hasn't been since yesterday.
Us? Our name denotes both who is fronting in our system and our system name.
If you want my advise on how to cope with the world as it is, I think therapy is something that can greatly help you work through this stuff, because you aren't doing it for anyone but yourself.
Ima be honest here, Hectan the problem I often see when you write in here is that you don't seem to want truly a discussion rather it feels like you just want to vent about how cruel you think the world is (with which I do agree with) but this channel is for disscusion and as pointed out by Mel before not for venting.
So you can keep it to yourself if you are uncomfortable sharing it with others
Yea that is something that only you can decide on doing and it is also something that only concerns you
It's just you getting help for something that is clearly eating you up.
Not at all.
You know going to therapy does not mean you are weak, nor that you are the person that did something wrong. It is just you seeking help
And you clearly have some trauma you need to work through
Hectan, that is exactly why you should seek help your mind set of being weak because of seeking help for this isn't healthy at all
No, that does explain it.
The problem is the conformatiy, Yumi. A lot of people have pronoun roles so checking for them can become a norm.
<a:PetTheRakhi:766296799148769320>
And I'd say actually, I don't think it is reasonable to expect to read your full name out before they reply to you, because as Matt pointed out (because now I do understand what he meant) 99% of all users don't have a name with crucial information in it. What I think you can expect, is that when you told people to not tag you, that they don't do so. At that point they should know about this, though I must admit that we have also forgotten this from time to time.
Yea that is very true
Companies should be destabilise due to shit like this.
Yea that would be good
Well probably that your approach just isn't effective enough especially since those in power aren't normally reachable by mere education
my opinon is that 4chan is something you just outgrow at some point or I guess you keep getting stuck and never turn around your life.
some of them are nice people but some of them are still massive idiots. I think it just should never be them moderating those spaces but if everyone there is from 4chan then of course that is going to happen
well, yea /mlp actually is a big reason it is as big as it is today, since they had a huge surge with tulpa people trying to force pony tulpas.
I warned anyone on the server I saw the video before about it, and well, I'm super glad that our german tulpa community on tulpas.de is way better than this
I stayed a bit to see if anyone would say something else in the matter but since that did not happen I left.
So I asked if this behavior was normal for the server since they wore throwing around the n-word at each other. A moderator answered by saying that not only was it normal it was also very much accepted by them since they were "mostly people from 4chan who like to shitpost"
Very well, also thanks for sharing your point of view Cypher.
The problem is that there is nothing a person who has to decide for it gains by saving the environment but they gain much by forsaking it.
But my point is that the problem isn't that the young don't know this is bad, it's that doing something for the environment is nothing you can let companies decide, who only will care for the environment if insentivised for it
Reminder that most young people are already informed enough about this that they despise the older generations but the truth is systemic change can not come meaningfully without someone wanting to change the system. If you don't cut out the tumor no amount of healthy eating will make a patient not die. (Sorry this might be a bit too krass but I really don't like this reasoning at all...) No offense to you as a person Cypher
Same goes with Climate change we really need to reduce more by about 2040 I think it was or we will have doomed the generations after
I mean we live in Europe so we got the euro already
I think the better or rather what most people try to ask is: "Where do you want to see yourself in 5 years"
Thankfully he kinda left the meetup we are organizing so we don't have any contact with him anymore
then he claimed that everyone would be mean to him online but when he was offline nobody would even talk to him about such stuff.
I've actually known someone who was, pardon my wording, a huge dick online but whenever you met him irl he would just be all buddy buddy with you
And yes, one thing the internet does is that you don't really have to go outside your bubble if you do not want to. This can be good, as it provides a space for minorities to have a space where they won't get prosecuted but it can obviously also be really bad when people just stop engaging with anything outside of what they already believe to be true
So, im saying its less the reason, and more the result
I don't actually think the reason is, that they would think they should not do it because it is socially unacceptable but because IRL you obviously can't just block or terminate a relationship you have as you can online, so in order to keep that up you act as what you believe is socially acceptable
and because you don't really have repercussions in most internet spaces, they will just act on their compulsion because they think they'll get away with it.
I think what would be more fitting is that people lose their base respect for other people, or somehow convince themselves that because person A is part of group X that means that they do not deserve that respect.
I mean yea. It kinda just depends with how much they think they can get away with. Most social etiquette is just people being anxious if the person they are around thinks that they are a good proper person.
but yea I agree that is a huge problem with some people.
Ok, wait, what is the actually problem, like what happened, Armis?
I mean I guess that is why I said it would have to be choice based rather than party based
Yes obviously
Non of the normal voting body has that
Ok but if 6 shouldn't vote than that should also apply for 70 olds
Well the problem does exist the solution is just wack
Or let me be more clear that system could work but only for an issue based voting system
Actually having voting rights for 6 year olds sounds about right, after all 70 year olds also get to vote
Oh those kids probably did know that, they just did it because it is wrong I think
Sure but people over 18 do that too Cypher
Of course there is, but im strickly talking in the way they inform themselves about politics and how much agency they tend to have
Now mind you I don't think the old should not vote, im just saying that it makes no sense to have one demographic like that who can vote but then another who can.
my whole point was that if we can't let kids vote at 12-15 because they are easily manipulated and barely inform themselves then we should do the same with the old since they are much the same in that regard
yes
I mean, people don't have enough personal agency until they become financially independent from their parents.
I mean 6y is obviously as pointed out by Rakhi just a thing to rattle up people but voting at 16 or even 14 sounds plausible
A Child can not really understand the meaningful difference between parties (if it exists) but they can know weither they want certain policies
ups I guess you'd need a subscription or knowledge of how to make stuff disappear at websites in order read the whole article but the point is probably brought about easily enough by the headline
<@!279341087494242304> https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/graham-linehan-glinner-twitter-ban-suspended-account-trans-a9588721.html
ours do, we get a whole sheet with what we will need beforehand
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I mean yes, but this is Germany compared to something like the USA everyone is comparatively 20% more left by default
kinda. but it seems to work out, they just signed the coalition contract yesterday pretty cool stuff in there
We now have a government with the FDP (economic liberals), the Green party, and the SPD (social party germany ... though the social part is kinda been debatable since 1918)
https://www.bundestag.de/resource/image/828186/16x9/1460/822/e8ed5211ce81cfd9db033c530fc5a035/Cx/distribution_of_seats_bild.jpg
Ima do what they call a progamer move
Still took help from our parents to get the apprenticeship tho
But at some point we realized it would be even cooler if it felt like we earned that pressure less time and you know weren't on the way of becoming destitute
And it was somewhat cool to just, exist without pressure
You know we had a similar phase from 18-20 we had stopped doing university and just wanted to get an apprenticeship but didn't put in our work to get it
Yea. But honestly the point should not be, if these things didn't exist I would do it, but rather even if there were no barriers I wouldn't go back despite that.
(unless you are like rich or something idk)
Yea but that is kinda why you sometimes need to do such stuff. You need to realize that stuff does not work like that
Yea obviously that can be something you yearn back to, but... It just sounds like you did whatever you liked to do and yes being an adult isn't being free from responsibility but it also isn't like being a child, it's more that you make your own rules for yourself and you gotta live with the consequence of those rules
Yea me too kinda. Then again we are about to do our first job. Isn't really the same thing as what I did the apprenticeship in, but to my experience it is more in the field we'd like to do
I mean that is totally understandable, but please know that your value as a person is not based in how useful you are to a company while that can be a part of it, it isn't all of it.
Yea and that's totes fine, I think no time is ever wasted time as long as you learn something, be it something you learn from school or that you learn about yourself in school
Yumi would be proud of me
https://youtu.be/j6jrBZQo5fM
Most of the time old WW2 stuff is the reason for an explosion in Germany if it were different they would mention it in the title
but thats after I think over 1000 of reports
oh it does. if you report with enough people you will get a community strike and your video will be taken down
Well I guess on youtube they had to at least do a lot of boting in order to get around youtubes report feature
yea facebook has been notoriously bad about removing shit content for years
but yea this type of content is bad wherever it surfaceses
oh yea that was in youtube too
so youtube basically had to change its rules and algorithm to take them down
they got millons of clicks
and since kids loved elsa and they loved spiderman, well
uh a few years back, some people made really questionable videos about someone dressed as elsa and someone dressed as spider man would engage in very questionable content like elsa being pregnant from spider man, all made for youtube kids
Well so like the elsa & spider man stuff?
Quote Alex Hirsch "If I got the rights I would do a final movie ‚ÄúWaterchip Down‚Äù where the Chipmunks all brutally die at war and then make it legally binding that there can never be another Chipmunk movie again because ‚Äúthe Chipmunks are dead now‚Äù
Still, I do think that your data being breached is probably more likely on a centralised location rather than a decentralised location.
because otherwise we would probably know and have definitive sources about this.
ok, I really thought this was more clearcut than it actually is, some say they could potentially sell data, but a lot of that seems based upon a missunderstanding on legal text. So probably they aren't openly selling data
And they did, reportedly so sell all sorts of different data in the past, why would they stop just because they have another source of revenue?
But that was the case for a long time for discord, mind you, Nitro didn't exist at the start of discord.
The cool thing about teamspeak 3 was mostly just how customizable it was from a permission perspective. In Discord if you have the power to give any role that means you can give any role that is under your role hierarchically. In Teamspeak that is customizable role by role. there is a lot of stuff that is better like this, but to a normal user, this will never be relevant, it only really is relevant to the people moderating the server. Obviously there is also the data protection issue, since Discord snacks up basically all the data it can get for selling it to third parties as marketing data. This can't really happen when you set up your own server on your own infrastructure or some that you are renting. Then again, this also makes it harder for people to open up communities and in the past has often made communities dependent on not so cool "tech-bros" that could sometimes be the worst aspects of such servers.
they just don't pop up or do sound
you always get those even if you disable the notifications
you can't at least not the red dot
sometimes it can also help to keep a conversation going when you'd otherwise just be silent at each other
the general aim of small talk in general is to either pass time or ease into a conversation.
to have literally anything to talk about that you share an experince in
no its just something you talk about as an icebreaker
<:ChrisHibikiHug:630262562361049121> 
Many hugs and my condolences for you. Lossing someone is never easy.
We all hope you will be ok... You should spend all the time you can with your mother, do not worry about other things right now, they are important, but you have done enough already, take care of yourself and your mother you deserve your respite.
That is what was being claimed yes,
the truth obviously was always that while an artist could sell their art as an nft, everyone else could do so too probably without the artist even knowing
Who would have thought that?
The problem with DMCAs isn't that you can't do it as a small person afaik its that you actually need a lawer and those can get pretty costly
I mean, a woman can dream right?
Then Ubisoft?
You should read the rest of the messages. Sussus Amogus explained that
It's easy to just accept stuff and not work towards a better atmosphere especially for parents from my experience but it is achievable
It really does not have to be though
Yea sounds rather complicated
It's actually quite common for this to be an issue in families since they tend to force a lot of group activities. And often even the children only realize that problem once they moved out
Or well maybe hating is a very strong word but some people have very different amounts of social energy and when those get expended they tend to get cranky or trying to find a spot to be alone and regenerate
I mean what I meant is that perhaps she hates the whole being together part of chrismas and that puts her on edge because she feels forced into a situation she does not want to be in maybe even only temporaryly due to the bipolar
Ours was really stressful but we somehow managed
I'd ask: did you consider that if your sister leaves social places maybe what she needs is space?
Well probably he needs a person to really vent to right now, also might after that need some time to sort his feelings... Also what a C*** honestly who the fuck does shit like this? I mean we are in a poly relationship but that means actually talking about that kind of stuff, you should really just be there for him I think
Thanks Abi
Yea but you make rules/laws to protect people from being run over or do you think these are obsolete?
I wonder if he forced them to take brain force
The problem with remasters is that with a 100% digital sale you don't have higher uptake for selling both versions you may lose profits because people don't want to buy a more expensive version if they feel that isn't worth it, but that just means a remaster should be worth the up pricing
Like if you got the the let's say 1.5 as newest and you get a release by asking a friend who just hasn't updated for the 1.3 shouldn't you be allowed to play that version? I think so
Hmmm yea you might not but I don't think forcing you to play the newest is right either
I think you should have the right to do that yes
Although in the hardware world with stuff like apple this is also highly debated
I think the answer should be yes but I think at some point you also forfit the Guarantee for support and possible need for replacement if that would normally apply
For example by revamping the controls
Of course but most of these are for games where remastering actually changes them or their game feel significantly to the better
Yes in general but it's often something you can get better with fan content unless it does add new content but that isn't a remaster then
See for example dark souls remastered
Which is kinda scummy since the new version is often sold at full price
I know that what's very controversial is that most of the time a remaster is made available the old version will be pulled from being sold
More likely they would close your account but yes.
Technology can only be reconciled with morality other wise it just becomes mass destruction on the long or the short
<:ChrisRead:688429724334161987>
Good to know
your rl name is Donovan?
If I recall correctly the best procedure when you suspect you've been infected is to test 1-2-4 days after or 2-4-6 if you are fully vaccinated
I mean at that point the artist is just the person declaring it so the nft itself does not declare right of ownership, the artist does. Which obviously makes a lot of sense since they are the only one who can proove natural ownership by that they have created the art.
the legality of ownership via nft is iffy at best I mean of course you don't need legal documents for everything, but an nft can hardly be recognized as a record of ownership especially in court
Well tbh it's hard to know with all animals since for example the bat that contracted Covid initially was immune to it animals just sometimes have vastly different immuniesystems than us then again by mutating constantly a virus like Covid will eventually have a version that can infect all animals I guess
So what if people do stuff with it that's bad I mean it's not like it deminishes the original work
While there isn't too much data the answer is most likely no, you can get long Covid either way even if your case wasn't that severe
And although I'm also really sick of them... I think they are very much nessary if anything our lockdowns haven't been thorough enough in the past
I think lockdowns are (besides vaccination) our only real weapon against the spread of covid
Yea
but anyways, this stuff happens everywhere since it is just a general thing news sites do to push people to read their articles
GG was a thing that happened
since you know
Then again, not liking polygon is also such a uh I guess "Gamer‚Ñ¢Ô∏è" thing to do
like I know for example polygon draws a lot of ire on itself by doing stupid headlines to get attention and then backpaddles when they deem the backlash too great
but yea I feel like its just that old problem with articles being titled way too clickbaity
generally explosion mining is a thing and we do need to be able to like efficiently get rid of old buildings sometimes so having a more environmentally friendly way to do that would be good
yea obviously
the what now?
look the whole problem with the pandemic on that level is, that conclusive scientific evidence takes years to be thorough enough tp be usable in legal terms as a way of declaring the lockdown as "a crime"
it isn't until those studies are conclusive
Also while picking apart this argument is tempting kss did the right thing to just ban the person and presumably delete the post
And I mean it works it does make me mad
I mean they probably post this because 
a: they believe that shit
b: it makes people (deservedly) really mad
true yea those should close really
actually at least in germany a lot of people did as being shown by how the waves were much less drastic in germany than in other contries
well, im not saying that is my thought process Im just saying I do understand it. And yes that is the valid answer to that sentiment.
Well yes but I understand the sentiment, at some point you just think "I did everything right, why do I have to suffer for a small vocal minority that isn't considerate of others?"
I do understand that completly
not the other way around really
because shockingly companies need people
but it is hella effective if you get enough people to do it
well not really it just be less money they would additionally get
strange that
Huh
like if they have a bad time they will shorten stuff but suddenly when they are well off nothing gets better?
weird how companies do this
especially if it is obviously halting progress
Inform the moderation. if they are in anyway shape or form competent that should not fly
oh thats why the name doesn't say anything to me he is a english VA
Just saying that "metally mature people" is only under 18 if you are a fucking podophile and are so deranged to think that being traumatized is the same thing as being mature
21-26
So like
It was
Yes.
I mean that can not be true at the fact that obviously there has to be more nfts than what is brought otherwise it would have been brought immediately
I had my third last saturday, still feeling a bit weak and was a bit tired yesterday
but yea I would do that too
it is 3 months here
I mean I think we should just lockdown according to hospilitation numbers like if its at 2% of capacity left we should definitely do a lockdown
I do go out to meet my parents, and or visiting friends sometimes, but im vaccinated 3 times by now
and now with omicron not being vaccinated basically will make you get it with 70% probability and being vaccinated would have probably saved you from the symptoms
We rarely go out ourselves but when we do we want to be safe
Yea I do agree
then it just got made into an investors bubble
well
but
Well yea the only idea where this would work is if you would buy and sell with the decentralised currency which I think was the original idea
especially since, without the ability to buy with crypto inherently you will have to convert it back into non crypto at some point, and then you are going to lose a lot of it to taxes
yea
a dream that is as delusional as the American dream
that is just what stupid economists mean with it, but in a decentralised system the smaller units can obviously regulated as they see fit this is just not happening with crypto because it is literally build of this "hustle" mentality of just investing a dollar and then making thousands back
Yes, and one thing that often gets overlooked there is that decentralised does not mean unregulated
I do disagree, I think it is very possible just that obviously it would be a very big change a change that most likely could only be brought as a part of something like a revolution
Also the problem with Bitcon ect. is that it is specifically build to be exploited tbf. so I don't think it's decentral aspect is that much in the foreground for anyone but the people strongly arguing for it.
I mean we do have stuff like that. Stuff like communes being build up, sure they exist as a decentralised thing within a centralised system but they still do a very good job at showing how this can work well.
generally decentralisation is good
it also means everything is so anonymised that just mostly scummy stuff happens with that aspect
but well
Well, technically, that means no one centralised institution can corrupt that specific system
to have receipt of a transaction happening between 2 people that is decentralised
Wasn't China always famously unstable because it was never one country but rather a lot of different dynasties?
<a:KiricoinSpin:664652551580418068>
https://youtu.be/YQ_xWvX1n9g
ofc they do they have no idea what nft's are nor what it really does
if you think that doesn't make sense then you haven't understood what nft's are
Lootboxes, microtransactions, season passes those are all really shitty things that mostly profit the people forcing these onto games and not the creators of those titles
yea. And I think that isn't good
Also we are still losing a lot of energy for that, and generally that means more pollution
sure but it stands for something much bigger, that is acutally really fucking gross
the problem with NFT's is truly in that regard that staying impartial is very much impossible because NFT's invade the spaces we inhabit, staying impartial now seems to be the same as surrendering the ground to *them* where as they are the nebulous force behind the greed in the world, individuals for sure but more ridden by the idea that any potential economic growth must be made into reality, which obviously conflicts with a lot of our viewpoints. Staying impartial now thus feels like you are just letting this be a thing when it feels like a few people pushing this onto a lot of spaces just because they want to chase that nebulous potential growth
compaining about that is a fair point, but it is wilfully misplaced at a creator, who tries to bring his view point on the topic across
I see, what you mean, but this is after all also a piece of capitalistic design it is entertainment and as such it is not in the creators interest to remain impartial, because that will end with them losing a potential audience
I mean I ask myself here, what is the value of impartiality?
And the obvious answer is, 
a: platform people who others hate (see the recent stuff with the BBC)
b: try to convince others who aren't on your side of the argument to be on yours
Both... are not something you want to have
platforming those who are by all other means just people who commit hate crimes in the name of impartiality often turns out to be a thinly veiled attempt to *just* platform these people but not their protestors.
Trying to convince others, isn't often the aim of such essays as it is more a way of seeing an issue through the lense of that creators view on the topic, so having it impartial would just work against that aim
I highly disagree. because tbh. it is impossible to be tone neutral, and even if it were I do not think impartiality is in any way valuable when it conflicts with the values of the creator to such a degree as this does
So the value in such a video is not about convincing others who are not yet convinced but rather in compiling what the creator things about a given topic.
sure but that is how it works with most content, I am under no illusions that this video will change the minds of those who are investing into this idea, but I do not thing any argument can do that really, beside one that could definitively prove that there is no profit to be gained from these systems
im pretty sure, nftbros isn't really the kind of audience he tries to reach
I mean, yea that is part of the point, that is how most video essays work in general. that is why good ones do have sources listed so you can read up yourself and build your own opinion. Nobody should base their opinion on one piece of media they find, that just leads to misinformation and very bad bias
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
fuck, I really do hope she gets through this all...
At least that is how it feels to me
The problem I feel is less, Ten doesn't want to cut their ties and more like, they have to much power over them and basically their lives given the countries situation
Wdym?
Because by design Nfts can't hold images unless they are really small (datawise)
That would probably be better yes
And generally an NFT is nothing more than a bit of data stored on a Blockchain so generally it can be anything that fits within a certain size of space.
The image in question isn't what's immutable it is infact the token that is, which is mostly just a number and even that is not the 100% truth. Technically Nfts can be erased by branching a Blockchain.
I mean the whole problem is this isn't legal, or at least people who get their likeness or intellectual property used can definitely sue the problem is more that this stuff is new to the law. There isn't an easy way to resolve this for the creators in question because of that.
if thats worth it for the movie go ahead
treat the time in between as if you could have it and self isolate
but if you want to and won't let yourself be convinced go to where there are less cases do a test before and 4 days after
safest thing is to not go to that
You can not reason your way out of an abusive relationship you have to either escape or destroy the power the abuser holds over you
Because under normal circumstances child parent relationships can get better with distance especially if the children have become independent but as long as ten is trans and the Brunei literally criminalizes being trans there will always be a power dynamic and abusive people will always try to take advantage of that
In order for this to remotely work they'd have to be on equal footing powerwise which can in fact not happen due to the country they are in
So this isn't just a strained parents child relationship
Technically yes if this was a normal parent child relationship but they are definitely abusive in that regard, and as ten pointed out they have been also neglecting towards them
It's good to know you're better
<:ChrisHibikiHug:630262562361049121>
thats what what you implied tho
I mean unless you are talking about like ambulances but those obviously are not something we need to change really
wha? Like how would using less cars cause deaths?
It has no special meaning, it was just a way to refer to the situation Gwyn experienced
I had a similar thing, though I wasn't passed out, when we got our eyes operated on and let's not go into detail but the after operation pains are something that was only able to be withstand able while sleeping really
like you were there sure, but you really functionally couldn't do anything
I think the whole thing is more, about how weird it feels that this whole time feels like it happened without you
that is what for some people children have been in like the middle ages when you needed someone to take over the family business and help in old age
or some twisted shit
probably that if they get so much money they should give their "poor mothers" a cut because they help them with staying where they are
They won't at least they said it went well.
"Attempt to commit suicide
309. Whoever attempts to commit suicide and does any act towards the
commission of such offence, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term
not exceeding one year, fine or both. "
Thats from the "Laws of Brunei" Penal Code from 2021
Yea and not having anything to back that up
Well from someone who had to actually go through all that stuff in school way too much and was actually interested: The Nazis were in the sense socialist that they wanted to build up a more social state that would bring "the German people closer together" it had little to do with actual socialism. And while yes, the Nazi's had industry closed that was less due to fighting against capitalism than it was disowning prosecuted groups like the Jewish people or Sinti and Roma. Also the whole "Hitler beat unemployment" thing is technically true, but also would have meant that without a war, he would have driven crazy deficits, because without a war there was nothing to support the jobs he had created.
I mean I agree its just, I feel like at some point when you start making fun of someones sexual activity it just become petty and I don't really see the sense it that unless you want to vent at something
This is rather offtopic also I think a bit too much redicule
<:owoAqua1:587930874306232333> üë®
Not that I would equivalent the two but yea
I guess
I just meant that any of such substances can have a drastic combination effect
I didn't mean to say that you were doing anything wrong
I mean yea
yea, I mean even taking anti-depressants and anything else needs to be closely monitored
that is true of almost all of these substances
(on itself its much worse if you mix it with other stuff)
LSD becomes most harmful if you don't take sufficient breaks between trips
yea.
But so can most things that people do for fun
yea it can
I mean yea. But the discussion was mostly about psychedelic substances without an inherent addiction factor
My opinion here is that in general the problem is less the substances themselves and more the market around them that is mostly caused by the substances being illegal.
I mean I agree that there are substances that should in fact not be given to people un supervised
Honestly its hard to say if they even exist because the hardest physical reactions are caused by drug abuse by way of mixing drugs to get more to sell
yea that is why having substances like this as illegal is harmful, because that means people will learn about them in an unsafe environment, where they might not be educated about risks and when not to consume these substances.
same with China tbh.
like russia and the usa both need to split up honestly
yeee
Because the USA isn't that much better honestly
Invasion probably honestly. I think the EU should just be way more clear that they need to establish independence for all states inside Europe

wanna know something funny? they actually take complaints about that so I made a complaint with them and the gall they had is just sheer fucking bullshit
When I say the EU should protect sovereignty I mean that as in protecting them from outward forces like Russia, and I specifically said Europe not the EU (European Union) because those are 2 different things you know
The us must be so proud rn
yea
Venting is kinda ok, to my knowledge as long as you want to actually seek advice on the topic
yea.
and that is also why strikes are so powerful and important as a tool of dismantling power structures
yes, and that is why ultimately, in order to harm those above you'd have to harm those under them, or make them refuse to do their jobs otherwise.
I think the whole problem is that... often times the only way to harm the upper class is by harming the lower class because that is mostly how upper classes are uprooted in the face of war. Then again that isn't a good thing at all. War is never and can never be good nor righteous
I just drink tap water lmao
No Australia had an actual toilet paper shortage the rest of the world did not, but despite that whole markets were brought out
I mean hording is a self-fulfilling thing, once you have rumours about people stocking something it is literally brought into existence as a real problem even if it didn't really exist otherwise
yea Cringing at your past self is just character development
and I think
the question is how do we preserve the disscusion
the fics themselves are already dealt with
that doesn't solve the problem tho
the prompt wont be gone after all
we can safely delete that disscusion
I think if the discussion around a prompt has been 3 years ago
Well tbf
yep
like a drive folder
I think the best idea would really just be to make an archive outside of discord too
but I think one thread per prompt is better
We can set threads to 1 week
That wouldn't work I think? Because threads self archive after a while if nothing is written into them
I mean general that has always been the case as long as there isn't a comprehensive collection of the prompts
I think threads might actually work pretty well tbh
sorry
Sorry I don't even think you are wrong but having two people solve the same issue just makes it worse
Cypher please don't interfere
then search for "recovery"
First you open your windows start menu
windows 10?
you use windows right?
give me a sec
This is like a super common scammer setup. If you can, reset your pc to an earlier state and after that reset all your passwords, best think is to use 2 factor authorization or multi factor authorization but a password manager is also a super good thing to have on top of that.
the y axis is how much % said they were gonna vote for that person
Its about voting polls
just a sec, can I call you so you can share your screen so I can advise you more easily?
just click on the recovery
yep
It should look a bit like this now (sorry for the german)
<a:angy_gay_noises:733001221299896428>
Let's still use Windows 7
Meanwhile people in our company
the problem here is that something can pose as an image and if you click on "Open Original" it will open a web address that will then do the bad thing, probably steal your account token as Das said, which then allows the scamer to use your account for the scam as well

just kinda a thing so people can see this and know about this hopefully ahead of time
Isn't the problem more in the inflationary usage of the term itself? 
Censorship is (at least from how I use the word) a direct attack on an idea or movement to shut it down. And thus you saying something racist is not censorship its just you saying something most people don't like. Censorship asfaik constitutes a group inside of society to decide a kind of planed erasure of a kind of idea or movement
Russia hasn't been very helpful to Poland in general
Why were they there in the first place lmao
Well then we are on the same page ig
This isn't an easy issue
No like seriously cops are literally broken down in the USA to become shitty human beings
No that's how the system works no twisting required
yea thats also a good point you might be able to affort a loan but not at the current time exactly so you can take the loan now, but be able to pay it back in due time
declaring bankruptcy at least here is a long and very argosies process that can take years of court time
Some yes but not all of them you gotta find a therapist that works for you.
the problem is just that progress without ethics is not going to help humanity its going to help investors
though I think its generally accepted that he did try to push progress
it can be argued that a lot of "good" that bill gates did was only rather self serving
I mean
Curse of balal beaten <a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746>
I know
make them pay finance transaction taxes
funny idea
Or
by avoiding taxes or investing it in charities they made themselves but that ultimately only do what they want
Like they invest a lot of time and effort into completely avoiding that
The problem is that billonairs are the exact people that can not be trusted with reinvestment
well it is just a social construct. 
the problem with Greece was that they were printing money to pay goverment stuff without accounting for inflation and they kept doing that even when they had the euro
an "economic crash"
I mean its literally
I mean tbf. going back further even the first global economic crash of the 1930s was caused by basically the same thing although the background was a bit different
yea exactly. That is the way to big problems with loans on this scale
hmmm at least one good thing about the UK
which is the whole problem
eh conservatism and liberalsm are about the closest you can get politically without outright agreeing with eachother
I feel like not having pensions for politicians might be a problem with that
like they don't know history but they have the gall to invoke it to justify their shitty decisions
I mean I'd be ok if they were old but its also that they are flatout wrong
imagine having a 2 party system smh
they elected Donald trump with a majority vote, what more disappointment can you express
not really a good topic to talk about
ok, then lets just not talk about it going forward
I don't even know why you brought that up Cypher
we really don't need to talk about columbus
I meant this
but yea the statement you posted there is just factually wrong and kinda disgusting honestly
but that was also when drugs like cannabis was leagal so no, like that is the bad thing about this when Politians say they "wanna go back" they don't mean going back they just want to reestablish certain rules they like
Gotta love how American Politians don't know history
and not considering evidence flies completely in the face of that
thats like the whole point of new evidence tho, a court is not supposed to make a verdict for its own sake
the verdict is supposed to determain the most truthful solution to a trial
Yea I don't think anyone of those video game companies took a significant loss because of that but still not a win either considering that this has definitely fallen off
but it should definitely not be possible for them to be appointed by either the executive branch or the legislative branch
Though tbf. it would probably be hard to enforce that fully
If you ask me, a court such as this just shouldn't be allowed to be affiliated with the other branches  of democracy
ah I see
wait you live in NRW? I always kinda had all others on here mapped in the east but I guess you life probably in east phalia right?
yep I will be home in like 30-40 mins. so got plenty of time
until like 18 o'clock?
I still have time right?
fuck
yea. especially if they think they can also control the education system.
Are they ok? Are *you* ok?
yes
but the core problem is that you can literally shut a kid up by letting it use youtube something that for a lot of parents is might convenient
I think playing games is not even that bad if it is something you do together
so they will just ask for it because they saw someone else do it
Kids have friends and some of them will have bad parents
since you know. Its like it always was
but its kinda hard probably to not do too
yea
Let them fund XDU
Oh no
yea me too
Nowadays some 2 year olds get set before screens because it keeps them entertained. Which yea isn't a good idea
Anyways this is getting way too silly for this channel
Maria would never cave to a man.
nobody under the age of 40 ever did
Curse you, Edison!
also wouldn't any kind of energy storage always be very concerned with conversion rates? I can not imagine gravity battaries to have a very high conversion rate
so its more like some Prime Ministerdom
and I mean technically speaking the country is not even led by royalty
given that it is led by a Queen
Actually its more like some Queendom
The problem is that most of the time, Evil makes the laws
<:ClownMeru:816322913962557510>
or see the other as the greater evil I guess
the problem in the usa is that only like 20% even vote according to the candidate. 
Most just vote because they are more convinced of the democrates or the conservatives.
if I had to hazard a guess its probably at about 70-80% acceptance now
yea
You must have deluded yourself a long time to think that hatred like that can at all be sustained in the general public
Damn
what? Homophobic/queerphobic people are actually a minority?
Or a walk if possible
But I get how you'd get the idea
No like those who engage in such stuff tend to be trans and just like to experience that kind of stuff
So yea in conclusion no this isn't a thing and it was a "study" mostly done to prove an already transphobic idea
Well it doesn't actually exist so there isn't really an analogue to it
"you're just a pervert who wants to be a woman because you want to defile your own body"
As in
But the whole problem around it is that it was used for a long time as a scientific argument (which was not really proven) to discredit trans women
Like no even that like just urgh it's dumb and hard to explain
The idea would be that a man would have sexual desires about becoming or being a woman
Like
This
Feeling you might have Agp just validates your transness more
No more to it than that
It's called being sexy or wanting to be sexy
Nah not really
<:SothisHug:690606262282485780>
Well yea. Im fairly certain that for debate purposes we are talking about the USA right? At least as to where such laws would be needed.
but that doesn't mean we shouldn't consider heavy gun control
which, is true
I don't see a counter argument here just a "but other stuff is bad too" argument
Well sure but then at least we can make it harder for homicides to happen you know. Like guns just generally serve no purpose and since you can't really have a resistance even with guns anymore, using them to be able to rise against the state isn't really an option either. I don't see a reason to not restrict gun usage to a minimum
That ofc yea
No speaking from experience people who really want to commit suicide will find a way. (for the record the experience comes from someone I used to be friends with ( he is not dead)) But taking away something that a lot of people consider as the first option does help.
You don't need to ban guns in general. 
Just have it be way more restricted. In Germany for example for most guns you need a psychological evaluation to own them. 
And also you need to be able to prove you can store them safely without anyone else being able to access them. 
I think if someone wants to have a gun they should be able to have them but they shouldn't be able to just own one without consideration for their mental state and also how they will store it.
I think the one I saw was in Colorado
yea. that is a thing depending on the state
Me only once in that wall mart I mentioned before
yea but then those need permits, and thats fine. Problem is just having handguns be so unregulated
I don't even get how you can think that is ok.
Like
Because tbh. any more restriction for guns would be good in the USA. I still remember back when I visited the USA in I think 2014 or so, and the Wallmart had the weapons isle directly backtoback to the kids isle, with some guns out of any cases that were restricted
but still yea not a thing that should have happened
They are definitely not right
The S√ºddeutsche Zeitung is left centre I think this is more an artistic exaggeration than any internalized anti-Semitism since  that is generally highly 
ostracize in germany for I think obvious reasons
yea...
I mean yea if you abduct an underage girl (or generally just abduct someone) you should be locked up period
ok but like the comments on this are just atrocious since Ezra Miller is apparently non-binary half of them are just about how homophobia is wrong/write 
smh
I'm half joking
Switzerland is not part of the EU they are neutral
The whole problem is, yea ofc you don't "blame" the object but a destructive person is much more of a danger to all if they use a knife than when they use a larp sword.
Why don't we ban knives then? Because knives have a good regular use outside hurting people. Guns have a few cases where using them makes sense and that's it. And for those you should have a licence anyways.
Yes ofc but that was before that was even too much of a possibility
The problem is when the reserved list was made, these cards were no where near their current value and the reserved list was more meant to let collectors have something that was not gonna get devalued over time, not to be an object of speculation
Yes. And since it's never printed again those are some of the most valuable trading cards that ever existed. Although most of the time they are just sold to other collectors or people who want to resell them again later
Proclaiming that no card on the reserved list would ever be printed again
After a while wotc the company creating magic decided to do a so called reserved list
So at the beginning of MTG there were a few cards that were really really powerful
It's a card game Cypher there is no specific law regarding this.
Honestly I'm fairly  certain there is little to no legal precidence that's fitting that case enough to say how such a trial would end.
Yea
As in, promising that certain cards would not be printed again they increased the value of those cards basically artificially
I mean technically the reserved list was market manipulation more so
But also wizards (to my knowledge) has never profited from the secondary market and is it really a damage when the whole reason there was value in the first place was the non existence of supply?
Yea number 3 rings very true
Like sure they'd be devaluing stuff but the secondary market has never been an official thing
Really? I think they only ever said they are not gonna do it, how is that a law binding contract?
Now all we need to do is get rid of the MTG reserved list
Me dumb
Oh wait
Can't you get protein through beans tho
I mean in the end it's your choice I think there are better ways to protest in that regard than consumption. I think that is rather true of Many of these topics the far more important thing is real protest if need be with (economic) violence
You are right i think sorry had something different in mind
Or well
But it doesn't fit you're right
No
sapphic for women don't know the other but it exists
Well I'm ok with the secondary market I just think the reserved list gives it an artificial value boost that mostly makes it so formats where those cards are legal are all but unplayable without proxy cards
Mostly yes
That was like 1995 or something
I had 2 SIM cards where you could punch out the smaller one of you needed it
Kat the problem here is not your Argumentation, it's your conduct. And it has been for some time. You tend to attack people if you deem them as not agreeing with you too much. In this case I do understand why you feel that way, but still it's not ok to just say some reductive word to "call them out" when you really don't dislike them but rather the politics of their country
Its really a dumb situation and in all honesty most of this stuff is probably easier to sort if you aren't where you are now
<:hugs:642833304231477250>
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
See, then you got little to worry about your past!
<@331908049822547978> 
The past is as much a part of all of us as anything else. But it is how you choose to see it, that determines if it is something that holds you back or leads you into a better future. You made mistakes, but those mistakes are part of why you are now doing better. If you do not make mistakes then it is impossible to learn to be better. Generally speaking it seems like you are unable to move on from this, probably also because your life (at least right now) feels too stagnant in other ways as well. So it feels like not a lot has changed, when in fact it has. You have changed, for the better, you aren't the you from back then, even if it does not feel like that all the time. And what is especially great to think about I feel, in 2 more years you might be even better if you keep working at it
Well yea our brother was attempting suicide, so my parents got him into one and that did really help him from what he told me.
because if they get money for keepiing people in then good luck with them helping people other than giving them more drugs (as in medical drugs but still)
yea the most important thing tho is that you need it to not be a commercial place
yea. JFK did some crazy shit but he died on the job so people really liked him for that, strange
And then you complain for the next 4 years about that. Idk its a dumb system. Then again a lot of our political systems are just really dumb in some aspect.
Yea American politics is quite dumb. You literally just decide between a bad and a worse choice.
Not reading too much news is in general not such a bad idea at least if you aren't affected by it yourself. Like reading a bit is ok but sometimes its easy to just spiral down
Yea there is no way to negotiate with someone who literally wants to take away your independence and probably also annex you if possible. Because doing so would just mean they could do that again and again. If anything we just need more help for the people of Ukraine
Yea. That is true. Just telling a bit that this is (or more should be) a thing of the past. Because often times mental institutions are still vilified to this day
yea the situation was similar with our brother. He has a good education and could certainly find a job, but well... depression is not a thing you can easily ignore away
You can literally just vent to Lily, or me or probably also Matt or anyone but doing it here just puts it into the spotlight which is always kinda bad especially with personal issues as this is
Because this is not the place for that. you can vent, that is not the problem.
Someone blocking you does not belong in this channel also because it is not a vent, nor a conflict solving channel
Also, probably not the right place to address that.
Das, this is neither the place nor the time. If you want to be better then be better. But don't you remember what I said earlier? Holding on to your past will only make you resent. You need to be better and at some point it is going to be better.
I hate how back in our apprenticeship we were literally forced to have WhatsApp because our company was doing absence notices over that 
Though later on I found out nobody really took that serious and mailing was more preferred anyways
Anyways, yea we have given companies way to much sway over what information gets shown and what not
we had that more with stuff like Whatapp but its the same story.
also time to remember that the biggest theft world wide, 
is wage theft.
They would never say "Irish travellers are now illegal, and can thus be hunted on the spot." Although they would probably like to do just that.
they would make it so you can be easier to be imprisoned via things associated with them like theft, or remove things like necessary rights for them if they are "caught"
mostly you make out certain characteristic, that they share and then you illegalize those which then makes it grounds to arrest most of them and raid their occupation since a "criminal" can be held in custody. Its a really perverse thing, but as an example:
In the US there was a thing called "The war  on drugs" which supposedly was about being tough on drugs to safe innocent people from falling into drug habits but disturbingly enough it was mostly used to raid and bust Black and or Hippy gatherings those groups were associated with Crack and Cannabis. Thus they just found something they can criminalize them with and then used that to incarcerate those they deemed as "dangerous". 
And same will it be with the Sinti and Roma. If you want to illegalize them, you will be more tough on stealing which is the stigma attached to them, and then just imprison those who you can catch with the suspicion of  theft. 
Honestly this is a really fucked up thing... but that is also how Extremist Right dog whistles get made, by advocating for law changes that will target those groups the not so extreme can focus on the law change while the extreme will know that this is a tactic to literally hunt down humans.
Yea or you just have a sports event and push it through while the masses are occupied with that
How is that the case when a lot of them are on federal land?
Not the fact that it was discovered
Yes. The "that's not good" was addressing the fact that that's happening
Hmmmmst
That's some real bullshit right there... Like really that's how important it is to then that please not even a not known about pregnancy is carried through?
Like games made out of NFTs
no thats games that have NFTs but not NFT games
Money
right
what even is a NFT console supposed to be? Is it supposed to read smart "contracts" and via a combination of those create a game?
If so, why would you need a console for that? Oh wait
yee that is correct.
I mean Cloud gaming might actaully become a thing that is done more in the future
The *somewhat* cool idea about nft driven games would be that you could have your character or more generally your progression be an NFT that could then be cross referenced in other games the problem with that is, that is already something that could theoretically be done its just bollugs
its written down in "Faust" by goethe
but we gave up our humor
to get good food and beer
We made a deal with the devil
true
it just eludes my thoughts what a console would add to that other then novelty and wasted money
Anyways, an NFT can carry code which then through a larger collection of NFT's can create a game
Unfortunately for you, Im german
Ah well
but they are not
We are way to used to nft's being pictures
That would actually not work in that case.
its just stupid
Well I do
I think the implication is that authorities only give 110% when its big company money on the line and not children in schools that is threatened.
What does NI stand for written out? I wanna look more up for this
I never heard of it before but then again that's true for most celebration out of my own country
I agree this seems to be majorly fucked up
Well don't.
Gotta love British culture
Idk most stuff like this in Germany is just memorising the cost of those who died for a better cause or those who died because of fascists oh well and Carneval
But the reality is: even if it isn't part of British culture it's a result of the actions of the British and at least a result of their past culture
I do know what that is about. And yep that is urgh reaaaaaaly fucked up
In that case
Oh I did not make that connection
The IoT is really dumb good ol' internet 2.0
Does it even matter that one thing gets more shit than the other? Sure it would be cool if all of this wasn't shitty but dismissing augments because "we didn't blame X for this" especially when people did and it was just not as visible to you as this is now, then that's a poor argument. Do you think we should dismiss the whole shitshow at blizzard just because Activision is doing similar things and "we haven't given them shit for that" (which those of us who pay attention to this have but whatever). Sorry if I'm coming off as upset but dismissing arguments is seldom grounds for a good discussion
Even if it is I fail to see how that makes it good
Eh covid is not "too bad" for all of us but you will have to stay inside for about a week at least and while that might not sound so bad now it can get somewhat dumb down the line
its not only because of covid tbh.
Like I believe you can only visit Japan at the moment if you take a guided tour
That, and making people who have experienced that stuff be very angry with you for (hopefully) obvious reasons
Yea lets just end this discussion her and now
Just stop there
Stop
Ok Broom
that won't work out as a disscusion
Anyways this discussion is pretty dumb because its weighing one persons generational trauma against someone elses generational trauma
but that is just kinda spliting hairs
the memebers of the nazi party
As in
The nazis were mostly not the german soliders dying in ww2 at least not exclusively
One thing
Ok like
lmao what really is the point of finding out who is worse they are both awful and no, German soldiers did not "follow rules" in WW2 espacially since and we can't forget this, the Nazi's literally made them kill minorities
yes
Yea. This discussion is done
Well sometimes that has to happen when you have a bad enough take
we are not discussing this again
Circles please
because we have a Preschool here too though that is only for when someone is of age for school but not ready for it yet
Or wait is it actually like school
yea Montessori schools are actually pretty cool. 
And if its anything like germany I think Preschool in america is like Kindergarden if you have that in Ireland
Gotta love Mario Mario
He was mostly recorded in Plato's own stuff
Socrates probably never existed
no that is the joke
Gotta love Platon who literally wrote down his dialogue with his Tulpa xP
It's a nice story though
But it's probably the most made up one
Though pretty fine lad
Diogenes
No like it was very specifically about that not having worldly desires would make you suffer less because you couldn't be hurt if you could not forfill them
Cynicism was a philosophy of having the minimal amount of worldly pleasures so that nothing could be taken from you
Also the had the funniest philosophy as a counterpart
But back in the day they were known for their huge wine parties
Eh it's about as old as Christianity I believe
Hedonism is fundamentally a group philosophy and more of a vibe than an ideology tbh. like, it used to be practiced in old Greece as a form of maximising  happiness. As such it was practiced in big groups as a form of just using whatever means to have as much fun as possible, more or less the motto was "you only live once"
America moment
Most of these things aren't like unforeseeable
This isn't a contest who is worst
Be it how Russia does or the USA
Generally I think we would all be better off if intervention wasn't an excuse to "help" countries
Especially internal conflicts don't need international interference but this is a hostile takeover that is much different
There is a difference between nonintervention and not reacting to international threat
Well what he meant was mostly that the USSR was heavily influenced by the US given the cold war and even after that it never really ceased. You speak of something entirely different than what lank meant. You try to assert that, Russia is bad even without the influence of the US is that right?
Ok, show me where you think they said what you think they did.
Kat, what he argued was, that American interventionism is negative for everyone, not that it's the reason Russia is bad. You tried to find an argument there that does not exist and that is also what lank meant. Try to find out what the other person means then you argue with them. Because as it stands, and this hasn't been the first time, you tend to argue against an "opponent" that you made up based on what you think the other person thinks. And that does not sit well with anyone neither you nor the person you argue with.
I'd like to read more into that
Is there a study about this or something like that?
Huh. Like bones don't develop as dense or what's it about?
Yea that's at least the idea
Yea and you will. But probably not there. The system is much better in Germany anyways. The British isles are notorious on a trans side to do exactly this they say it takes a certain amount but then say there is nothing open and you would need to press them until they give that to you but well ofc most trans people are not able to chase them by themselves
Lily, I don't wanna sound harsh, but that stuff will probably not be doable since if there is no news you will probably not have something substantial until you turn 18 and even if that did happen... You'd probably need your legal guardian with you and your nan will probably want you to go with your bio mom...
Lily those people are not arguing on rational arguments. That is not what they are about. There is no thing to explain really they probably do this because they fear someone could "trans" their child
No and no one said that honestly.
But I sorta agree with you, Rusia is not bad because of the USA but I don't think lank meant that either
Because ignoring Stalin as a major factor in this is as saying the treaty of Versailles caused the second world war
Ok, because lank argued that us American interventionism made the situation worse not that it was caused by it. Which I think is somewhat correct although the thing here is more the cold war which made the relations pretty grim but mostly, Stalin
TBF. This is serious discussion
No like that's super easy to explain you guys are like Europe only you had the bonkers idea of having in central government the rules all the states
Yes.
Well it is at least consistent if you say you stand for pride you can't just remove that when it is convenient to making more money without revealing that it was always only about marketing
Yes, that doesn't make it better honestly. That's like saying: "you are required to show how bad the USA is in order to sell in North Korea" 
Is it therefore, ok?
What a shock, a video game company that has no intentions to actually stick to pride Hmmmmmmmmmst I wonder how that happened
Germany meanwhile (This is for berlin other cities have other laws)
```Insofar as the rental agreement does not provide for an increase in rent (also known as graduated rent) the owner may demand an increase in rent if the following conditions are met:
the last increase in rent was at least 15 months ago; and
the new rent is not above the local reference rent, which is generally decided according to the official index of rent prices, the so-called "Berlin Rent Index" (‚ÄúBerliner Mietspiegel‚Äù), which determines the reference rent on the basis of location, age,size and fixtures and fittings of the apartment and
the rent does not increase in total by more than 20% within 3 years (in some areas, like Berlin, 15%).
If these conditions are met, the tenant is obliged to consent to the increase in rent. Where he or she does not do so, the landlord may sue to obtain consent.```
is there no regulation that forbids this? and also yea a contract should not allow this if not way too loosely defined
we eat way too much when we aren't hungry and just because we want a proper meal that is tasty
Idk. I have the opposite problem if anything
I am mostly voicing that I don't think when someone says this its something that should be inherently trusted
not really
like they will to some extent
Honestly I don't even think they will do that
an excuse for actually doing something about what he did
as I said before somewhere else this sounds like nothing but a pitiful excuse
Let them suffer
Good
Also, yea you can just right-click, and select don't want to see this crap anymore
Dude the YT comment section is about as reliable at predicting the future as the ability of us presidents to bring meaningful long lasting change for the positive
Oh that's good
NGL that belongs in a German museum
I just want to make that clear that Germany didn't exist for about 4 years. Then around that time both the BRD and DDR formed. (Bundes Republik Deutschland aka. State Republic of Germany / Deutsche Demokratische Republik aka. German Democratic Republic) 
And when these two states who both officially referred to themselves as Germany unified, it was more so less a new Germany with both states in mind but more a reintegration of the DDR into the BRD. And thus really the current state of Germany has been existing since 1949.
Which both saw themselves as Germany so not really an excuse there. It's just that back then Poland itself was basically occupied by Russian forces
Yes. It was made to minimise Nazi presence and criminalise Nazis and those who sympathise with them.
No it's because showing those symbols is unless properly justified like in a historical documentary against law in Germany
There are fundamental 3 sectors of work. Primary like digging for a minaral, secondary which is producing goods from a Ressource and tertiary which is services where what you pay for is having something done by someone who is better at something as yourself
It is as much a part of capitalism as anything else so we should treat it as such with regulations that ensure safety
Look I'll give you an example in Germany we have labor laws these aren't enforced everywhere but especially bigger companies can not break them cause they would be sued into the ground
Like, if enough states would accept NI's independence that laws like those just don't matter honestly
But its less about law and more about how legitimate people think a cause is
Technically yes.
So what? If you want to liberate from anyone you can't just listen to them or can you?
because I doubt they are as ballsy as to do that with military force
I doubt the UK could actually enforce NI as a part of them
actually
And... I think things like that are not too likely to happen
But to stay on the topic of Ireland I feel like there needs to be a British liberation for anything to happen at all there
me too.
they do, they just also speak catalan
Aragon is pretty well integrated by this point tbh. even though they don't always want to admit it.
They would have to resolve a new ireland in of itself
that is the whole problem, people would need to leave behind stuff. and I don't think people are ready for that.
Like I think it could work better if NI was like not a part of great britan
Honestly, Unification of Ireland seems way to unlikely with the troubles still way too fresh in peoples minds
things like these are never easy and never without sacrifice which is the problem in general with shitty systems. 
All people know they are shit or at least can sense it but doing something about it most of the times also means giving something up even if only temporarly
Actually in Germany that is how it works. Funnyly enough
Also that is majorly fucked up
Cops should not need unions as they are employed by the government
Because it is reasonable to assume you already have a usb c cable but it isn't that you have an apple port so idk
This is only acceptable at all if they use standard usb like USBC as a charge port
yea probably like 5-10 years as I said earlier
The queen just really did not like Diana
There are some stuff that can make you be removed but I don't think he did any of that
we might get that when Charles dies though
Well honestly, its pretty clear cut rn
Not in german
yea because he was the child of Diana I think?
brb editing Wikipedia articles of the royals lmao
then it would be Harry
that would be him unless he did like the stuff that makes him unfit to rule
yes
Then it would be Charles first born
Very true
Charles
So now we get Charles who only will live for what 5-10 more years?
Well yes but the queen is not part of the government
you forget that once nightmareframes are inventet the holy empire of Britania will conquer Japan
I don't think it does like... almost at all
also living till 90 is pretty uncommon
yes but statistically, Men do life less long.
2030s seems legit
but still
tbf that could go wrong really fast too
well
which makes it even worse that they don't do anything against topics that could be largely improved if only they said they approve or disapprove of certain things
as they have a lot of public sway
Tbf. I think the monarch has a lot of power they have just refused to use it
also <@726218419749519400> if you like manual that much go live in germany we have like 90% manual on our streets.
then again, I think the queen did not want to not appoint someone the "people" have voted for
when for some of the candidates that have been elected that would have been mighty cool
which they can technically do but haven't done for quite some time
Technically the biggest power the monarch has is choosing to not appoint a prime minister
<:DimitriSalute:610240740865343498>
Rip kitty
In that case
I thought you meant the queen
Woha
On some magazine they had that as the leading headline that day
Reminds me of that time Knut (an icebear in the Berlin zoo) died
imagine capitalism
the monarchy does not really hold power that can be enacted easily
But yea
for example if the monarchs would speak out against trans hate (and I know that won't happen but take it as a hypothetical) 
I could see a lot of stuff getting easier at least socially for trans people in the UK, or at least people who haven't before being able to reconsider.
Pic or didn't happen
So basically there was no way to choose a "good" option
yea me too that is why I wanted to ask him as I thought he might know a bit more
<@87512939107450880> quick question for you, how is the Italian election looking rn?
In DnD I believe it is the way where the body has the soul but then if the body dies the soul returns to the phylactery instead of going to the afterlive
its ok
a  phylactery then is the object the liches souls goes in
I was vague for a reason, as to not spoil :Y
its someone who has taken their soul and placed it in an object as to become immortal, most then construct a body they can act through. 
Its a bit like how magical girls are in a certain magical girl anime you very well know. With their souls being in objects and their bodys just acting out their wills.
as a person who knows about history (especially German history) Whenever someone speaks about referendums but also has troups stationed in a region or about to do so, ima be honest that is just someone trying to justify conquering the region by threatening its people
you are thinking of league of legends
ah finally the anti genshin armour
Delusionposting? I mean that is what's mostly meant right?
yes
Xdu is mostly for having more cute Hibiki Pictures
If someone has committed heinous crimes, nothing is more compelling than to die to them. Because then they can't be punished
And that goes both directions
The thing is regardless of anything nobody deserves to die
#nevertoucharunningsystemmyass
And nobody doing the work to reroute it.
It's just a lot of shitty systems working together
Ofc landlords are just humans, the problem has never been on an individual level
Mostly because of the rules tumbler had but yea
Tho I'd rather stuff like Facebook just didn't exist rather than Twitter, it's algorithm isn't helping anyone really eithet
Is that such a bad thing?
If Twitter ends
Honestly
but yea Bureaucracy can be quite strange sometimes
Was it really? I mean culturally perhaps but on like a urgency level I don't think so.
Tbf. Twitter was always kinda shit, Elon is just accelerating stuff
You try to get rid of bob, but there's always another bob
I mean not if you are being invaded, no
Does Teslas stock going down endanger Musk or not?
Getting back on track tho
That's only true of analogue cars though? Like they show you 5mph less than you have, to encourage you to drive slower. The Tesla might have that too but still maybe then the problem is just with how we have decided to drive cars
Idk maybe I missed the point of that discussion but I just wanted to point that out
Actually there are quite a lot of trans people who did so
Good
I will say, of all the British I think Rakhi specifically does not deserve that at all.
Lmao
Here's hoping they just die off at some point
Nah like yesnt they have been on the decline for a bit actually
Fair enough. Like it's just we have like 5 relevant parties in Germany and either they all seem to do the same, (SPD/CDU/Green) or they are asshats who want to push liberal shit (FDP) or they are a party with good values but way too caught up in infighting (Left) so idk
True change always comes through action. Idk
I mean when has voting ever given you the power to actually enact change? Don't get me wrong it *is* important but I just don't have much faith in any party really
Yet
Well I mean the fact that the British government is pretty shit is not really a new thing I would say
Can't get cancelled if you don't have twitter :P
I think it mostly represent how dumb Moderation on subreddits tends to be
https://twitter.com/Esqueer_/status/1610944242607685633
Funny story around these parts not only do you have to do a psychology test to own a gun but you also have to prove you can store it so that others can not access it
Broom you have neither the understanding nor the knowledge to make such a claim.
It was 2 revolutions or rather 2 revolts
Just cease to talk about it or change the subject
No we can end it rn
The discussion?
And because of cours it's in the interest of people with wealth to stay wealthy it's stays white people
Well in capitalism it's people who are wealthy really it just so happens that most wealth was before capatilism accured in white dominated countries
A capatalist answer would be: "because there isn't enough for everyone and some people deserve it more than others"
Well yes you could but the difference is I actually read Marxs and also have a very solid understanding of both ww1/ww2
Do not miss understand me in no way am I saying that what Stalin or Putin did was good, I am not but your blatant disregard for anything in association with them is just something young people do because they don't know better. I'm just being harsh because I want to drive home the point that you lack a lot of understanding even if I can absolutely see where you come from. But we had this discussion before basically what you are doing is pretending like the theory of evolution would be a bad thing because social Darwinism exists.
Either it's all or nothing
Also wtf how is "seeing half the ads" anything you'd promote
When everyone can buy it anyways
OK so explain to me again why anyone needs that
Well yea fair enough
And while yes doxxing a transphobe would also do that to them, I don't think it's nessisaryly the best course of action
I think the actual right move is to probably involve the authorities of possible since doxing someone's information usually is a threat to the person itself given that the implied effect is people finding out where you live so they can attack you where it hurts you
I mean it would be if the person (the transphobe) had said before that they don't do harm to anyone but it turns out to be that they have a dox this transperson channel. But otherwise I don't see it as something that should shock anyone. This must be some reverse ship of Theseus stuff
Well yes it would have to be either law or contractually binding
Well basically what it means is that you only get time off when you aren't needed and or when someone else can cover for you which will probably be less than normal. I get 28 days off here and Tbh. I think having many more would not work out anyways. Sure 32 would be nice but 40 would just not be able to be used anyways. Which is only good when you can get them paid out. Generally it's way better to reduce overall hours or even think about the 4 days work week where possible
Can you just... Not Circles?
Fair I think it's weird how much people get hung up on stuff like this
I mean someone who has sexual intercours on work hours should probably be fired tbh. But... That has nothing to do with whom or how many people they sleep
Yea... That is pretty gross.
TBF. I think the one thing that always gets me with new systems is learning how to create new characters most other stuff is just easier to look up as you go
True pathfinder 2 is its own thing build on in inspiration of pf1 I think
Yea I meant pf1
But it belongs not to wotc as far as I know
Well yea pathfinder is just a DND offshoot to be specific DND 3.5
Like yea trying out new systems can be very fun
The normal hours for anything are what's written in your contract
Lmao imagine landlords taking only as much rent as you can pay
If you want to learn history from an ai, yes
Which honestly is good
I'm assuming it's the other way around, the ai in the background probably is set to never be anti-Semitic
It's basically delaying the choice
No it's stopping for example puberty
The thing is yes I understand the urge to trust doctors on this... But most of them just don't have experience with with treating trans people and thus some do not realise what's going on and or have believes that are quite transphobic
No like we have the data, that's why we don't believe them. All data that exists points to it being almost none existant.
Do not get me wrong Chibiki these people need counceling but they also need a system that helps them and not just flat out tellls them no like it is currently in the UK
A trans person that is on blockers before their voice cracks is one less trans person that has to do voice training (that is for mtf)
I mean you also have to understand... Helping trans people is most effective when done before they get too much into puberty
Most people know stuff is going on for quite a while
I don't think there is something like a sudden comming out
Well yes because they probably feel much more safe to do so now than they did before. Which is a good thing.
CEOs be like: how can we reduce the costs of our company.... Fires people but takes a 50k bonus
But yea ima vanish too we are going in circles
Well if the news article says : "this trans person transitioned and now regrets it" and thus people are putting too much effort into people who will eventually detranstion thus taking away places for "real" trans people then no, I perfectly understood what you meant. But due to the data we have it's just based on making an emotional argument based around the experience of people who probably only worked with like 3-4 trans people
And just not looking up data. They can see one case they are emotionally attached and from this assume to other cases just like everyone else
Yee. See BBC for example
Because negative coverage tends to stick more
Also keep in mind "person regrets things" will always be more showable as a news story than "trans person now happy"
Or it can be used for mtf people to make testosterone less pronounced in the body as it's more dominant than estrogen
Why do you put a plug for a conlang into <#336297840529899522> can you please not use this channel that way?
Imagine management doing bad thing especially at blizzard
I mean if you have the time make up a solid plan with them and only them so they know you value them. And *are* putting in the effort. That is of course if that is what you want
Because honestly
Ok but so like the problem is they are pissy or are they trying to do something
Yea
Honestly that sounds Hella toxic ngl
Sounds like you should cancel them
Idk it's a false equivalent and her being upset is well and all but it should not be your problem
Yes?
I mean historically anti-popes have existed
 But I doubt that's gonna happen again
Probably yes
Well its a short so its most likely if anything a recreation but still
This sounds like a bdsm date that only one party agreed to if you ask me, which is so weird like people really do shit like that?
What a twist
wtf
like
thats still super scummy
ah I see
thats even more reason to like not pay for it if they already wanna not teach you
and what do they mean you owe them now? Like you owe them as much as they have thaught you (which tbf. isnt a lot probably) that just screams capitalism ho to me
if it isnt it should be
I think to just comment that I just like to add to the whole point of people donating to charity as a way of "cleansing" your sins. Because its such a common opinion on the right especially but that makes sense because to them, most of the time the idea of the "good person / bad person" dichotomy still makes sense. To them you are either good or bad, maybe neutral but you are to them in a sort of moral binary when in truth, you can do good things and you can do bad things, but neither really undo the other. If you do bad things these things wont suddenly be ok just because you did enough good, and vise versa, if you did something bad that does not mean that something good you did is suddenly bad (though of course it can be called into question if perhaps you might have anterior motives) It makes sense to get an idea about how you are by your actions, but thinking that one thing can be balanced out by the other in terms of doing good or bad is just laughably childish of a world view.
tl;dr: 
People aren`t good or bad, their actions are.
I mean TBF a counter action doesn't nessisaryly need to happen on the same level as the action , it could also be demonstrating or other activism
(which I should clarify I think is a good idea to teach from what happened as a negative example)
Meanwhile school in Germany: this how not to Germany, you got that
But yea it seems pretty artificial
Honestly if anything that thinking is pretty dumb and toxic for another reason. Because if they had their way, their kids would have to spend time with them instead of at least having some space spending that time at home
Hard to say but from what I could tell they are upset that they don't get a commute with their kids that takes some time for them to spend together
Yee. Like I take about 1 hour and I still think that's major bs
Does hugging my Honk neso count?
but do not fret, it is worth it.
Love Live can make you feel real hard if it wants too
|| daiyobu... Honk is coming back, with sad anime op||
I mean, I can totally relate, music (both playing piano and singing) is just way to fun for me
Or to be frank rather fucked up
I mean the dream itself can be noble the reality is just... not that.
I just do that while talking walks, makes me somewhat nostalgic.
Oh it is. Truely I have the complete soundtrack here <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
That would be funny
thats where we at I think
I think its susume tomorrow right?
you will understand... 
soon enough
What is 2 - 2?
true. I still remember
To some extend yes.
True, in love live it does feel like they just become idols because they trained to be and are earnest about it.
because... honk is too adorable
Im suffering with you, have my nesos here too
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
Everything will be daiyobu trust in the power of idol
Because, the feels hit too hard
but yea
ah yes, I kinda count the movie to the series by default
Good good. Season two is really good if you ask me. Are you going to watch Sunshine after this?
you can't escape the feels!
if so, I just did
"Stay away from me!"
More like the anime annihilator
so I watched about everything in about a month
I started back then because I was dragged to a dv and it was just way too much fun
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
y'know now I want to hear way more love live ahhhhh
Wait thats good
Du du du du du du du du du du du
HEY HEY HEY START: DASH
Its all daiyobu now
totally understandable, tho sunshine made me cry I think more than sip did tho it did also do that enough times
tbh. A rise has nothing on saint snow, but... you will see...
I mean it can be but I guess that is up for prefrence
There are some... good doujin out there. I might have read them.
https://cdn.anisearch.de/images/character/cover/full/33/33700.jpg
also Honkbasa is top cute
relish your time with them.
But Ill take a look what this is
hmmm I was under the impression that Precure is a brand name, but I guess I was wrong
Then why have precure in the title <:kanna_confused:633802315488428033> ?
Huh. I see.
is that the spinoff were they go to vietnam?
look it had to be said
Honk is best idol
Both are worth checking out tho
although there are 2 sif and sifas 
School idol festival all stars is the newer one, although I still prefer sif over sifas because i like the gameplay more.
School idol festival would be that
ofc
yea
she doesnt that is the point. She always puts a pretty front but she kinda does that to fool herself but especially her sisters, who kinda need it.
its... too adorable
and the will do a nico nico ni
yes
I do like them all tho
I dont know perhaps that is true.
WASHI WAShI Attack!
mostly yes but it does have a story line throughout which alot of moe shows do not (which can be good)
ima be honest I dont really consider love live to be too much moe its far to drama for that
One of us!
One of us!
I mean, they have some very good performances in the show. but I think the best are yet to come, considering where you are.
The Anime annihilator strikes again.
Im very ok with this
I mean
what?
true Mari is doing the tsundere stuff right
tho early love live looks a bit different.
So, basically, some time ago Sunrise was like: "Hey you know what people like? Idols! So we gonna do polls in our magazine and do an MV where whoever gets the most votes gets the center."
nah only if you want
you will HAHAHAHHA
Because
well, its a bit more complicated
yes
¬µ's
which, actually mirrors real events, as snowhalation was their breakthrough song.
yep! They won with the power of snowhalation
where you at rn?
Have fun!
The reactions are going to be gold
im just stocked for Sunshine.
packa packa pack?
Alpaca cute
Because
English? In my idol anime? That is a no go low blow.
nice!
Singing is always fun!
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
yea, and then snowhaltation
School idol festival, I think I mentioned it before
Although I think School Idol dairy is more interesting because it contains more... shipping.
Oh yea, got the manga here, all 5 volumes.
Just Gacha
So yea, ¬µ, Aquour and the Nijigasaki Girls are actual bands.
Training Arc!
Training Arc!
Training Arc!
You are only using 10% of your idol power
You have yet to achieve true power
But I also think at some point its not healthy anymore
I guess so.
so I should eat
its 14:30 now
I didnt but... that was at 8:30
I should also get something to eat soon
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Very nice!
absolutly fair
I had to take the oppertunity
you know baring my title, it is Konichiwa xD
I guess we could continue doing the reaction stuff in a private convo? I guess then at least it wouldn't spam the server
Anime and Fanservice?
One question for the gundum fans, does every protagonist in gundum have problems with their respective parental figures?
Bikibility comes before readability
thats the point
I had some of those cards, it was a pretty confusing game
I do, sadly
did you know that on mal you can use custom css for your anime list? There is some wild shit you can do with that.
https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Chazoe
You are right, the definition is a bit maluble
I don't because it is neither the focus of the show, nor is it ever explicit about the relationships it has. E.g. Kirishirabe declaring their love for each other but they aren't a couple in any sense. If anything they could just be sisters
Yuri isn't inherently porn tho and yea symphogear has Yuri elements but it is not a Yuri show
<:MichaPoint:738234743115743292>
Refering to the boyfriend comment
That's... A bit farfetched lotsa people at that age will think they need a boyfriend regardless of sexual orientation
I knew that was gonna happen...sorry sometimes I lack the right words I mean explicitly Yuri not Explicit Yuri
I'd say the hibimiku scenes especially season 1 can be very yuri
I mean shield hero has some well very uncomfortable themes sometimes
Maybe there could be a disscusion in there if there is a merit in being controversial for the sake of it or not
Then maybe discussion of that anime is just not that good for the server in general... Idk disscusing controversial anime Just for the heck of it... Could probably just devolve in unwarranted conflict
I see
Ah
Maybe live shitposting since it is nsfw and a bit of a shit show from what I gather from context clues
Did you do something wrong? I think Mel just wanted to stop you before it gets out of hand
What's ISWV <@379337518371307522> ?
If anyone wants to take that up please put it in <#336297840529899522>
But this is getting a bit too serious
I mean I just think there is something to say about how willing someone can be to let someone do literally slavery and still be the "good guy" as long as he has been beaten down before
Yes just saying shield hero isn't a like without its shock value but I agree that it is a story that is worth watching/reading
I would say you should but I dont know if youd want
or rather it feels like it
I wanted to get into fate, but if I ever wanted to I would want to play the vn, but that shits fucking impossible
thats my idea
dont watch fate
or what Ikxi said
but if you have to, just start with Fate/stay Night
just dont
Oh you mean fate
im not sure im following correctly
What framework are you looking for
Ok, I will take that as gospel because I don't think I will read however long Index is
do that good night
I just thought it might be a bit distracting that was all
nah I didnt think so
Maybe, I will have to see if I get to that
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
watch symphogear
in that sense
my rating is just: Sao is decent if you like it thats fine, but I wouldnt invest the time if you still have other better shows to watch
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
fuck I dont know how to write that
I mean honestly concidering that Kuruhara wrote sao years before it was adapted for a contest he wasnt even able to apply it to, im pretty sure he just didnt know where to go with it in PB because alizasation while not good is at least consistently decent.
I havent read nor seen accel world, but I did hear it is good, tho since I havent read it, I can not really disscuss it that much.
When he writes stuff he doesnt know, or cant really relate to he doesnt fair well.
its more a problem with the way Kurohara writes in general its just most obvious in those arcs.
Honestly
Not really...
Its probably the only reason its so popular
the anime sells the idea of sao way better than the ln does
No, actually I think if anything, I think its the other way around
I mean they were... fine
I did not like them at all
And lets just say.
yea
because I read those
No, I was refering to the sao ln
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
But all im saying is, if you show doesnt get a season 2, thats on you for not buying enough merch.
I guess
is all im going to say
Merch sales
Ngl the ero manga sensei OVAs where mostly just cute wholesome stuff
all I got is a PS4 but I doubt that player is region free
So, what im taking away from this: Dont buy bd from japan only buy dvds
Im confused
Wait is it diffrent for BD's?
So I never have to worry about region locking?
huh
Then what exactly is it?
<:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
Wait it isnt?
Europe in general is Pal
no it isnt
<--- Lives in Germany
oh yea too have only a PS4 for BD's
I just know that when I got my AXZ Dvds I was a bit afraid they'd be region locked but it turns out they werent. Tho I guess there could be diffrence between dvd's and bd's?
Or do you want to watch older releases with it?
Wait wasnt region locking removed a while back?
I mean the obvious better way would be if you would just give money to the creators you want to see more stuff off or fund the projects you have faith in. But... idk. Buying some stuff from CDJapan occationally is also nice.
When are we gonna get "Reincarnated as a Symphogear Fan" voiced by Nana and Aoi Yuuki?
I absolutely disagree. Watching something and wanting to live in that situation are two very different things
I mean I get that
Idk. The only big thing is that for a show names "Index" the show doesnt really focus on her at all, since Tomua is the vocal point of everything
ye
but its like 7-8 Good
Well its still good
On a related not and since I know Cypher probably cares, I rewatched Index last night, well about 12 episodes
What if Ash was Kirito tho
I guess
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Not watching Sao makes you a better person Cypher not the other way around
Awful idea I tell you
... why did I even bother trying to browse twitter?
sauce?
just it does it weirdly and it contradicts itself
it does
Its not that it doesnt
Im just saying the anime has a weird way of portaiying this
I mean I guess
but Im pretty sure thats due to a poor interpretation of the anime
and since he doesnt really act any diffrent really... it isnt shown in action as well
I mean yea I got the "he doesnt want people to know about it part" Im just saying that it isnt really made clear that he lost that much of himself
Uh I can find that for you 1 sec
Im remain in my opinion that Railgun is just better, at least Anime wise
Well but Tohma also says that he "doesnt rememeber anything from the 28th of july onward" at the end of August. I mean perhaps he also forgot other stuff but still.
wha? Then perhaps we are talking about diffrent things or... the LN has a diffrent then the anime
I mean that tho doesnt make sense... it makes sense for like 1-2 arcs after that, but he only lost like a month, its not like he lost his personality nor did he loose years of memories
Tho im not Zoe
sorry
My fault
have you seen him
Obviously its Pain
Lol wtf happens to him
Idk I do like him
its obvious he does carries a lot of reservation about his situation
Tomha isnt really that bland tbh.
I mean kinda
I know tbh its just so dumb
Yea, Tomua, His teacher and Style <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It just reminds me of that
but I still dont like it when anime does that thing when it has a bland protagonist that hangs around a princess like character that would be far more intresting to follow. (Now mind you that isnt really a problem in Index as Touma is actually a pretty cool character)
Sounds dumb ngl
Mikoto tries to find out everything the old fashioned way, and Misaki just uses her esper powers to find everything out in like 2 secounds
I get those vibes from this
?
like a detective duo
are they
lol
My whole impression of their dynamic is mostly based on a doujin
I cant relate
I didnt really like her that much. Also shiping Misaki and Misika doesnt really make much sense does it?
Wait. Misaki is the one with the remote power right?
i mean yea they are in the anime too, but because the anime chooses to make this 5 1/2 episodes when it probably is just like 30 pages of a 200 pages novel makes it a bit overblown
probably ye
after the memory loss
and he doesnt really... act diffrently at all
but after 5 episodes Tomua is an established character
I mean yea
you see the problem?
The problem is really that in the anime Touma loses his memories in ep. 5
huh makes kinda sense
<a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746>
sure I'll fight you
I dont know what thats about but
well unless its just a straight recreation as with e.g. FMA:brotherhood
I just liked Railgun. Its a good anime. And I do see it devorced from the source material as I do with all works
Idk
I think this is just a diffrence in what we both consider as good characters
I think thats a gross misunderstandning of the Anime. Also why would she have to change? Its not like she has a character flaw that makes her a bad person
Not really...
I hard disagee
lol
Maybe I'll read the manga then some time in the future
I dont know I didn't like Citrus that much it was a bit too intense
It has come to this tonight, I will watch. Precure
My fav. episode is probably still "nagisas philosophy"
But we are going to watch ala mode
But splash star feels very similar
Not really
Futari wa precure max heart is
There is like 30 of them so...
but now we are going to watch another one
Ok to be more specific we already did watch precure
its quite comfy
yuru camp good but I read the manga
if we could it added up
For me that would be Your lie in april I think
actually stupidly shit
uhg that sounds
Also its fun just for how much the show tries to top itself
at least Sagiri isnt *very* abusive and actually cares about her brother
Oreimo is worse ngl
that is not true
despicable
uh
Eromanga Sensei was a decent Anime just the content was
the ovas of that were really cute so idk
tho tbh
Eromanga Sensei
So like
drop it?
you know
if its bad just
why tho
Good show
I see
its Simoun
AHhhh
Bloom into you?
yea
https://www.youtube.com/user/64BitAvengers
generally good channel to find cool media ngl
I found out about it existing due to a hazel video
gotta do that at some point
I think I never finished it, because we never had time to
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
They need to kiss to power the magical holy flying devices
Yea
dont take me at my word tho
I mean its at the border of it but I think you could say so
Kinda?
for some reason
Its also mecha
I mean its really cool ngl
So, yea I completely agree with Mel, that Isekai can be really good but only when the writing acknowledges the isekai and doesn't just make a fantasy anime where the protagonist is from another world, but probably also overpowered because they have that one artifact or power they got with them.
I think the worst thing about *those* isekai is that they aren't only self-insert characters as in blank slates you can project onto but specifically a protagonist that is supposed to be a stand in for the audience target demographic, aka. otakus and often time literally coming to the conclusion (thematically) that if only otaku would be born in a technical fantasy world with magic power they could have flourished. of course this is also why the so called "Truck-kun" is so aptly thematic.
but then again, tbh it wouldnt be too far fetched
its not animated by trigger now is?
those damned clifhangers
also
<@!738898415173500969> Code geass good, but not great tbh. s2 was way too bloated
but with the power of google images I did find this
Had to look for it myself
That should answer it Yumi
https://yuripedia.fandom.com/wiki/Chloe_Lemaire
Gotta love Utena
the power to revolutionize the world
so we choose to smash it with the power given to us
if we can not smash the egg we are doomed to die
we who are in the egg must smash it
The world is an egg
Yes
<a:HibikiAniThreeSeconds:836580813474103326>
watch it!
Now
Yep
now I want to talk about Utena
Fuck

its the first "oh look anime can be serious too" thing I watched
it do be that yea
If y'all want to watch it there is a cool longform video about elfen lied though it contains adult content if I remember right, so I'll spoiler it and urge you to watch at your own risk. ||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trwdaJA-6z8||
also animation quality improved greatly between 3 and 4
DAL 4 actually pretty funny
so the idea is kinda cool
we once wrote something with a similar idea actually. tho it did turn out differently (and it was a gear prompt so you know gear characters)
Free shippng!
the best thing about B√ºcher.de?
so im ordering from Books.de
So funny story I order books from "B√ºcher.de"
and B√ºcher is just german for Books
so its fine
I mean I got it by searching for it like that
Yea that was what I thought
https://www.buecher.de/shop/liebe--aufklaerung/im-in-love-with-the-villainess-light-novel-vol-1/inori/products_products/detail/prod_id/59462241/
I found this:
I'll see what I can find at my source
Honestly with most Shonen you are just much better served by reading the manga anyways
I for one, think that Maria + Holic is a good anime
It's just gonna be a Romeo and Juliet thing isn't it?
not Lily :P
also im Miku
its much worse than symphogear das
with the 10 million different cliffhangers
true but that is code geass in general
which honestly is not the best in general
Like code geass s2 starts strong then dipps a lot in the middle and then finishes strong
yea s1 is good s2 is uhm very dragging in the middle
no but I will force you to watch code geass
also helps as otherwise 1.11 is mostly a retake of the first few episodes
and then watch something else or two before you begin with the rebuilds
yes
it would be better to have some time inbetween the ending and the rebuilds
tbh.
although
you still have the rebuilds
is that its sponsored #notsponsored by Pizza hut
also the only really important thing you gotta know about code geass
Do kase-san

If there is one thing, Genshin impact can do really well its to create serene music
Ah yes, a song about the british educational system.
so its kind of a way to distinguished between the games cast (which is the actually band) and the anime cast which consists of not all the members of the band and yuu as an addition.
and its kinda still its code name inside the game (SIFAS)
it was the code name for the group prior to it being Nijigasaki
Perfect dream project
Im pretty sure she will be on an album once s2 hits tho
Yuu isnt really part of Pdp therefore she isnt in the album I guess
