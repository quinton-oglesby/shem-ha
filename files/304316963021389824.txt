Hello

But its so expensive
God I want to get back into Warhammer so badly

POV: Eren yeets u
Rendered
Got more stuff that has more to do with materials
Used Eren's titan model to do this
Thank you <:latom:610198939341160463>
Got back into Warhammer recently, finished my first miniature (left) after years of no painting, compared it to an old miniature a younger me painted  (right)
<:Pain:831691522285240330>
I've scaled them up several times and they still feel small to me
Also I meant more in the hips and legs
o
I don't hate it I guess? Proportions feel off
Hair
Coloring stage
Drawing Basa, or at least trying to
Doodle
Trying out my airbrush on some minis I bought recently

No info on studio/staff
Only thing revealed so far is that the VAs from season 1 are retaking their roles
That would be a complete disaster lol
Wouldnt want 19 volumes crammed into 12 episodes
It better not reach the ending
ITS BEEN 8 YEARS
If Devil is part timer is getting s2 after 8 years i will regain hope and faith for NGNL
afaik
latest WEP episode left me like this
