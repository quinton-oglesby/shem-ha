advanced racism for an already fairly homogeneous state
where u from?
its also deeply rooted in neo-nazi ideology, as Croatian and Ukranian nazis believe themselves to not be slavs but instead goths
just an excuse, i see it regularly used just to insult russians in general
regular russian citizens are not responsible for the action of their government
its dehumanizing and only fuels hate
proposal: stop calling russians "orcs"
if i can say anything to the average US citizen is to arm yourself just to be safe because the next decade, or even years, wont be pretty.
this, given with the current political climate over there in the states, is an almost perfect recipe for instability
but by my assumptions i believe the next crisis will come because of the "Debt Bubble" inside the US, since so many people there rely heavily on debt-based payments and lately we are getting rising inflation + popularizing of "pay later with 0 interest" services, which all would easily lead to an internal crisis of overproduction due to demand plummeting since people wont be able to consume as much to keep the system going
the market agents would surely lose faith in him both ways, except in the case he doesnt get bailed out it means a lot of people would lose a lot of money possibly leading to a chain effect for an economic crisis
though the question is if that would still cause an economic crisis which is possible
hes not a bank owner as far as i know, but even then he has enough influence to just get bailed out by the US governement just in case
i assume he has a lot of capital invested into stable things that arent as volatile as his self image
i dont think so, or at least not entirely
When is australia gonna cut ties with the uk tho
I want southern italy to be separated from the north to preserve all of our regional languages and culture that are constantly under threat because they imposed Italian on everyone
Yes but thats not why i said that
or +Europa
like Volt
the only ones who want it are laughably small liberal parties everybody hates
if nationalist as the usual other meaning than no
thats fair
nationalist as you want a united ireland?
the only thing id want is a southern italian entity in the federal state separated from the north
im staunchly internationalist, so i dont believe in exclusive unions like an european one
<@277145490087215105>
im advocating for a non-bourgeois and non-eurocentric entity with the prospect of federalizing large territories, while not advocating for any particular identity and defending all cultures insides it, be it minorities or otherwise
what im advocating for is an entirely different thing
no shit
Im saying the eu wont do shit to unite europe, its just gonna be there to give a sense of legitimacy and progress when there is absolutely none
im not saying "break up the EU NOW"
7 actually
for federalism?
also, when 6 of the member states are monarchies, do u really expect them to ever want to just give up their fancy titles and shit
the EU is never gonna be more than a group of bickering states with competing interests
functionally we are very much divided
it could be infinitely better if it wasnt made as the Neolib wet dream
that is with pure alienation, packing them into ghettos and letting them into only the worst possible jobs
the migrants are also a non-issue, they are made into one because of the way our states treat them
im not saying im pro brexit, im saying the EU is a deeply flawed organization that cant lead to absolutely anything, its perpetually stagnant at its core
its my real name and i prefer it anyway
call me celeste
especially eastern europe
yes because theyre all steering towards awful directions
eurofederalism will never happen, it goes against the individual interests of all the singular states' elites
the fact that its so divided its already a failure
tbf the EU is a project made to fail from the beginning
daily thank to ireland for popularizing tory as a derogatory slang for conservatives
Cuz itd be the ideal case
I wish there was
Omw to move to australia for uncritical support for the trot people's republic
They better gotta use this opportunity to rally the workers directly
Yes but electoralism is pee pee poo poo
You know the USSR wasnt the evil "authoritarian" oppressive state its painted as?
What
I wouldnt take the news we get about NK as granted, and i also do not believe them to be socialist in any regard
As for the second part, i think only Dengists dislike Maoists because the latter see how revisionist and not socialist post-Deng China is
Like its a word devoid of any meaning
Totalitarian means absolutely nothing
But theyre still socialists
Personally im not that fond of maoists and MLs in general because i found them not internationalists enough
They are
Wh-?
Although a leftcom socialist state would be really interesting
If theyre the latter i have no hope in them managing to go beyond newspaper selling
Btw with "socialists" do you mean a geniuine socialist party or just the socdem labour
it would also be really really funny for me
because hes descendant from the Brindisi Arbereshe
if the current PM is gonna do it im gonna laugh a lot
I need it
Quoting Gramsci and Bordiga, communist political violence is justified because we represent the interests of the majority of the population (workers)
because clearly peace is not an option?
why cant people see that escalating further is a bad idea
jfc
Libs try not to be warhawks challenge
he hasnt really changed besides just hiding his intentions
also
not video
twitter
He does the same to justify (in his head) killing migrants as long as theyre muslim
Without spitting in the face of actual historians that is
Especially because you cannot bloody fit a narrative into history
Thats why i say to not trust him
The guy twists everything to fit his narrativr
Kraut in general is not someone u should trust on pretty much anything
<@170641480791228417> <@472513526393602059> just saying but the video is bs
Kyivan Rus was neither ukraine nor russia
fuck private property
ü´°
may he reincarnate into a cute toad
transphobic*
a crisis of overproduction to be precise
btw im predicting an internal economic crisis for the us soon
(rapidly decreasing % also)
very different
theyre 2 different things
private=/=personal
‚òùÔ∏è
fascism is capitalism in decay after all, with an incoming big crisis its only normal that the biggest capitalist power would use the help of fascist goons for their goals
why would the feds do anything about it
I wouldnt take post-Deng china as the best example
Today it would be even more effective because we have massive supercomputers
Not really, input from local level was always a massively important thing that constantly shaped the national plan
Fighting the urge to sing Uz Marsala Tita from the top of my lungs
And very well too
Central planned economy does work
What i mean is
(Yugo still lives in my heart)
Yugoslavia
U dont know him?
Josip Broz Tito
Yes
The whole market socialism thing was tried by tito and it resulted in massive failure
No
Rich person with insane populist right wing platform being elected isnt a new thing
Either way what i mean is
Great
Where u from again?
Yeltsin? Orban? Berlusconi?
Other people dont compare their country constantly to americs
I assure you that only goes for americans
Funnily enough italy did it first with Berlusconi
The US and trump werent even the first ones with that kind of politics and head of govt
The thing is
Its all USAcentrism bs
God i hate those trump comparisons
I know very little of korea in general
Cant help with that one
Oh.
That is?
I think it mostly stems from having the biggest market of all that everyone wants to tap into
Serbia fumbled the bag hard
they can actually accomplish something??
the english workers are proving marx wrong??
finally
omg based
i dont think i see whats wrong with it
<@445783190976856065>what did u mean by that
??
Im really excited to read it
Just bought Lenin's State and Revolution book
üôè
i wonder what would happen to the commonwealth and all if the uk actually falls
what im more worried about is that the strikes could be repelled because of lack of a central anti-government authority
and i hope the people win
Im so confused, how is 4000 a lot
Unironically it should
Not enough for me
La magia di bologna <@87512939107450880>
Is it big or smth
I mean more like what are the consequences of whatever was discovered
Im a humanities girl
I dont understand shit of physics  in general
Can someone do me an ELI5 on the whole fusion stuff
And this is without mentioning how the church and religion in general as a concept are inherently reactionary institutions that serve only to keep people shackled to a set of old rules while giving a veneer of legitimacy to them by claming that they are divine rules
And this goes for pretty much anywhere but especially in south italy
I just wanna say that if church property were actually taxed (let alone confiscated and put to actual good use), the wealth of my city would instantly skyrocket
Either way
Im roughly from the same place as cipher
Apulia is in southern italy
I..dont live in the balkans?
Basically with the constant balkan instability over the centuries many came over to the other side of the adriatic, mostly from the coastal sourhern/central regions of albania
Albanians did exist at that point already
Illyria was the name of the roman province and that covered a lot of the balkans, has nothing to do with albania
Over a total of 4+ M people in the region
Less than 20k id guess
Today the amount of arbereshe left in apulia is next to nothing
And we are talking about like a lot of people too
From roman empire collapse onwards for a looong time
They get the same treatment as the jews aka forcefully convert and get treated as 2nd class citizen or get killed
Church is not happy with them existing as non catholics
Albanians come into south italy fleeing from chaos in the balkans
Im from Apulia, i refer to the Arbereshe genocide the church did
Nope
The first thing i'll ever do is personally tear down every single church in my own city
I swear
Noooo cel why are you so mean towards them why dont you forgive them for the ethnic genocide on your lands, the millenia long exploitation and the current attempt at trans genocide? We can totally win them over
Every day i add one more reason as to why those people should be wiped off the earth
Just had to priv my twitter account because of tradcucks raids
Tells a lot about the us lol
The fact that "interracial marriages" are somethings that need to be protected by law and not just be something already there is insane
And yea the foreign backing part
Mostly the freedom stuff to me
I for once would be very happy if the Maoists retook control of china from the dengists
Pro-us liberals are a nonexisting demographic in china
Most big antigov protests are flying frames of Mao and singing the Internationale
This has to be sus-iest video ever
Deng had already started the process
Im talking about revolution in specific there
Which is understandable but sadly real change in general is achievable only through that
Id argue even worse in the irish case
If by that you mean monarchists, it is essentially the same
Any fascist rethoric at all deserves nothing less than full repression
And honestly no letting them yell is not a good idea
We are talking about people who would bomb civilian passenger train lines because of how much they hate socialism
Fascists are actual threats and should be treated like one
Politics is not a debate club
And how it was born from antisemetic aristocratic circles, then ejected out of the parliamentary game for a long while before being reintroducted by the National Front with their rethoric adopted by the mainstream parties
I know a good book specifically about the history of british fascists
Btw if anyone is interested
That we must infact laugh at them
That is a moral imperative
Fascists should infact NOT be let having freedoms like that
You shouldnt do anything except laughing at any monarchist
Or actually
You shouldnt give weight to neoimperial larpers on twitter yknow
Mao is influential worldwide but obviously he is a lot more in china itself
I mean it most certainly is not just for show
Im gonna go back to studying wacky italian friars
My brain kinda dead today
Sorry
Oop
Its something that happens as a consequence
Becoming a conservative isnt just a "natural step"
I disagree
Bah
I mean
A group of people tends to go to either side of the political sphere based on how their material condition is
What i mean is
Partito Comunista d'Italia
I can attest you both of my grandpas (71 and 78 respectively) both voted PCI whole their life and both couldnt even go past elementary school
Most people who do not vote are disillusioned with the electoral system and with good reason
What is that even supposed to mean
ü§Ø
Dont vote
Since a massive amount of people just
Voting stats are always wrong because they only take in account like maybe half of the electorate
Also
And its not like they aint poor
But europe is mostly comprised of countries where older people are the majority
Silent, X and Boomers are more right wingers because they were shaped by the Cold War propaganda machine in times where it was relatively ok and affordable to live "normally"
Generations arent "always something"
What are you basing this on
Wait what
