Admittedly she was cool when she was around but it was only in the first episode or so.
Is Kanade liked mainly for her appearance in XDU? She seemed mainly like a character used to further Tsubasa's development in the anime.
Did someone share this already?: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ECvT5o9VAAEmJ1_?format=jpg
Though I know what it's supposed to be referencing.
That Big Head Hibiki from golden_nabe quite a few posts back <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

They got Aoi Yuuki to voice a Cure but I don't know if anyone made art about that.
Cure Parfait
So I guess people here don't get the joke. That outfit belongs to a PreCure character with the same seiyuu as Carol. (Inori Minase)
Found out the existence of this pic and I love it so much lmao

Apparently Nana Mizuki voiced Victini in the Pokemon movie featuring it:

I thought the reason EdgeBikki became edgy was because Miku died in that AU.
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
But would EdgeBikki still be EdgeBikki if Miku existed in her universe?
HibiHibi art in the TL for once
I think that's already a thing in XDU ain't it?
AU where Miku got Gungnir instead?

The new villain trio seems to be Illuminati members that have goals separate from Adam's.
So all in all, they got some interesting things being set up here and the action scene was phenomenal honestly.
Also damn you Kirika for lying about the South Pole being hot <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Also holy shit what were the first few seconds about?
So I'm getting caught up on XV episode 1 right now.
The OP has a much 'darker' tone to it this time around.
Where's the YT channel for Symphogear?
Ice Cream Cone building
It's not popular though <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Most of the time whenever I see celebs saying they like an anime it's usually a very mainstream one or if not that a popular currently airing show.
Does this mean Independence Day takes place in the same world as Symphogear? <:GWumuThink:399090734361214976>
I know we're only 3 episodes into season 5 but still.
I'm just saying I don't expect Symphogear S6 to happen anytime soon.
Maybe with a final movie to tie up the remaining loose ends.
A lot of the things about it point to it being the end.
Has it been confirmed that this season of Symphogear will be the series' last?
Cryptic shit is fun though <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
There's actually people who think Elf is useless?
Wait what?
I'm honestly surprised no one's tried to create a fake Kanade to try and screw with Tsubasa.
Also is Vanessa a robot/puppet/homunculi/whatever or does she just have robotic limbs?
Maybe there were clues in past seasons that he's not as good of a guy as he tries to boast that he is.
He was evil all along? I never would've guessed to be honest.
When I saw it for the first time I thought it was an asspull.
Guess that makes sense.
Maybe AXZ gives context but its been a while since I've seen it.
So can someone explain to me how that Philosopher's Stone gear power-up from XV Episode 4 works?
I still like to fuck around with people and joke that the Symphogear girls are straight.
Elfnein has way more plot armor than her so she's definitely not the one whose bleeding.
Though I think if Miku were to be killed off at this point I think that'd bring some interesting development for Hibiki.
I honestly don't think the series has much of the balls to kill off Miku or Elfnein at this point.
So basically knock-off <:Ver:336656981144109066>?
Also anyone gonna guess where the blood at the end of episode 5 was coming from?
I love how a screenshot from Thundercats is randomly on there <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I think I remember someone trying to accuse that Gridman show from last Fall of plagiarizing animation.
Like a :notlikebasa: or something.
That Tsubasa hold_head thing needs to become its own emote.
Tracing? <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Ironically enough I think the most 'expendable' of SONG is Tsubasa actually. Because in a lot of anime I see characters like her getting killed off for shock value.
Elfnein has major uses to the team.
Was that ever explained?
Also why does <:Cag:423197445644615711> have a male voice to begin with?
Unlike for other series like SAO and Attack on Titan of which the clones are numerous.
I don't think there's been any major attempts at going after the success of Geah.
LNs get a bad rep solely due to what gets adapted when I hear there's actually quite a few good ones.
LN will always have that one genre that a majority of them that get adapted fall under.
Isekai is basically the replacement for that magic highschool genre that was running rampant for a bit after Infinite Stratos got popular.
There are some more unique ones like Rokka no Yuusha and I think VE was one but a lot of them are just excuses for wish-fulfillment.
I know.
At least Mecha is a better wish-fulfillment genre than any LN ones will ever be <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
^ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Like the bread one from K-On(?).
I think some of these are just taking the piss out of the trope though.
I mean all of the past season villains have shown up to some degree this season aside from her.
How about instead of <:Ver:336656981144109066> they bring back out of nowhere they bring back Carol?
Hibiki on a dirtbike <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
Which chibi short did that let's destroy a bike Tsubasa come from?
Hibiki Euphonium
Which chibi short series is that from?
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
I was only guessing that Hibiki must be shocked about something, and it's likely that one of Miku or Elfnein is getting hospitalized at least.
So they're hinting at the death of Miku?
Didn't know that.
Kanade's seiyuu is one year older than Nastassja's.
Unless the person who voiced Natassja is older.
Definitely the oldest female seiyuu in the cast.
Kanade's VA is 55 years old <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Straightphogear <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
So did Millaarc kidnap Miku instead of Hibiki because Hibiki can actually resist?
I found this funny as hell for some reason.
"I'll do that tomorrow."
"You need to be more polite to guests!" - Elsa
I think that one line that Millaarc said while she meets Elfnein in the new location needs a mention though.
I'd be interested if Geah Miku came back.
So I'm not sure which of the Noble Red trio will be killed off first.
I want a Symphogear who sings country music for the lols <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
So DESS on steroids?
>Millaarc is a chuni who took her chuni too far
I wonder how long it'll take before someone makes a compilation of all the <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> moments in the series when this season ends.
Imagine if the dolls actually come back.
Yeah I even like her more than <:Germain:421434126856486912>.
She's honestly my favorite of the Noble Red trio by far and my favorite antagonist of the franchise so far.
Though what scene is Voyeur talking about?
I liked Cross Ange unironically.
Like Geah in a way.
The first time I heard about Valvrave I heard it was ridiculous as hell.
That kind of stuff.
A lot of the messages this show provides regarding politics is stuff I've been hearing for ages yet not seen in much anime, how corporations manipulate governments into doing stuff that benefits them and them alone, how the US' foreign policy is terrible and selfish.
I think his business is this show's evil megacorp.
In fact I'd actually like to see at least Vanessa die before the climax begins.
I really don't want a repeat of AXZ in terms of the final battle.
Noble Red Ranking: Millaarc > Vanessa > Elsa
Can't even think of an anime that had that "bury your gays" thing in it.
S1 ranks in at a 7.07 which I feel is too low but admittedly understandable.
I'm sure it's quite a bit lower on other anime rating sites but still.
Other seasons of Symphogear scored in mid to low 7.
Funny enough this season is pulling in a 7.93 on MAL.
Skipping Geah seasons <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
You probably know which site I'm talking about.
Although the site where Character x Readers are most common in terms of Symphogear content has a lot of fat Geahs in the newest section.
What is it like though?
They're so cringe. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Oh god those things.
Chris-chan meets Sonichu <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Is Super Heroine Chronicle actually any good?
Just be like Hibiki and break them off <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
This episode just made me realize I need an official Symphogear fighting game.
Ikenai
If Carol does hijack the villain role from Noble Red would you think that'd turn out well or no?
Sadly I don't think Noble Red will be killed off just yet.
I'm not sure whether to give it a 9 or 10 yet. It's been one of the strongest seasons so far.
He's the only villain that hasn't even been mentioned yet this season IIRC.
I don't even see how Ver could ever be brought back to life.
I meant more so in this day and age.
And Macross.
Other than Gundam of course.
The fact a non-kids original anime is getting as much episodes as a long-running shounen adaptation is something to be appreciated though.
The art style was noticeably different in S1 compared to every other season.
Hibiki over the seasons.
On a side note I don't know if someone's posted this image already but: https://twitter.com/wtosh_/status/1162771435267461120
Sand <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952> ‚è≥
Didn't Trump strike Syria before AXZ's finale came out?
I'm pretty sure that Not-Trump isn't THAT stupid to try and nuke some eldritch horror again.
I predict that Noble Red will die within the next 2 episodes but won't even be able to pull off a sacrifice before doing so.
Can Sword do it too?
I forgot.
Oh yeah.
Still though something must be at least inside Fudou if he pulled the glowing red eyes of death. No other human character was able to do that.
Maybe the latter will be answered via next weeks' episode.
2 questions though: How could Carol reconstruct herself via Millaarc looking at her, and why didn't Elfnein save Miku before she got absorbed into Shem-ha?
CURSE OF BALAL??!?!?!??!? <:Germain:421434126856486912> <:Germain:421434126856486912> <:Germain:421434126856486912> <:Germain:421434126856486912> <:Germain:421434126856486912> <:Germain:421434126856486912> <:Germain:421434126856486912>
When will Noble Red get emotes?
So its kinda similar to that weird abomination Hibiki turned into in AXZ?
Maybe Rakhi thinks she's the most likely to die of all the Geahs?
Are any of the Geahs even likely to die though?
But that's for another discussion.
Meduka should've ended after the TV series <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
I remember when someone tried to say that Magical Girl Asuka Whatever was similar to Geah and I haven't seen that show but I doubt it.
Are Wild Arms and Geah even similar in terms of writing though? <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
So I bet some guy is just gonna complain that Fudou is getting too "cartoonish" in terms of his antagonistic traits.
Enki started the Curse of Balal to begin with.
I mean it's obvious that's the case.
It's likely we'll get a sufficient explanation as to what Shem-ha really is as a god. We can assume that Shem-ha is what Fine was referring to when she was calling "God".
It's likely the case.
Hibiki suddenly lost her powers when Miku-ha came into existence.
Shem-ha vs Gear Miku <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Was it explained how the other villains could summon Noise then?
What's the worst that could happen?
If this is what actually happens how many people are gonna complain about this season 'reusing plot points'?
So anyone want to guess how exactly Miku-ha will be defeated if not a brand-new power?
So I'm guessing that Hibiki or one of the other Geahs will gain a new power in order to stop Miku-ha.
Symphogear's not mainstream enough to get a MatPat theory video <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Is the whole Shirabe's Fine thing actually canon or just a fan theory?
Carol's the only one of the past season main villains that isn't dead IIRC.
I think Fine hasn't either but still.
He's the only major villain that hasn't even appeared in a flashback yet.
I honestly doubt that this show would do anything as stupid as bring Kanade back from the dead.
It's kinda expected for CR to spoil their own licenses at this point.
On a side note I think I remember saying that Carol was my least favorite Symphogirl, and that's kinda changed a little bit.
It does that for me too.
Fudo's inevitably gonna hijack the plot.
I mean you can argue that Ver was 'evil just because' but he had a lot of other things that stood out about him.
I'm kinda worried about how well Fudo will be handled as a villain. From the image on the Symphogear XV website of him and his grin it seems like he'll become kind of a cliched villain (the 'evil just because' kind which is the worst type of villain by far) which I really don't want to see happen.
Unless the time travel stuff dinoboy theorized becomes true somehow.
Then again I don't even think Kaneko will stoop that low.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Kinda reminds me of a certain anime where some kid from the future saves the day out of nowhere.
Also did Noble Red really just die off that anti-climatically?
I kinda have my doubts that Noble Red are just dead right now. Their arc is too incomplete to have them dead just now.
Shem-ha's probably gonna betray Fudou.
At this point we still got Noble Red, Fudou, and Shem-ha who all have their own goals.
I really don't want Shem-ha to go down that easily.
Thinbasa
Geah's still too obscure in the West for XDU to get a release here.
I mean last episode did focus a lot of Fudou.
I heard something that the "focus of the episode" image shakes.
Any images that shake this time?
I still don't fully understand how Shem-ha was able to perfect Noble Red though.
Still a really cool episode.
Does physical contact from Shem-ha turn you "complete"?
Though in terms of the latter thing I asked?
I see.
I'll ask again if these aren't explained too well in the episode proper.
I'm only 11 minutes into the episode though.
Shem-ha is words? Shem-ha can turn people into "complete forms" by killing them?
Copyright infringement? <:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
*gives Shem-ha water*
So have episode 11's preview images come out yet?
Also why does Millaarc's suplex thing remind me a bit of Rainbow Mika?
Custodians are fucking nuts. They can turn into basic DNA and even a whole language.
Don't ask me how I came to know the existence of that.
Reminds me of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qrx18XuWx8
How exactly did Shem-ha decompose into DNA, let alone a language?
I think like 2012 or something.
Toriko is early 2010's though.
And that's really the only other notable role I can think of for her.
Voices Kasumi from Bandori.
Still though, I can't wait to see what ends up purging Shem-ha from the gene pools of humanity.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Silly me.
Oh yeah I forgot.
Also it seems like Maria is related to the Custodians. Otherwise it'd make no real sense as to why she of all people got the Enki vs Shem-ha dream.
Isn't there one by the KonoSuba author?
Though I've only seen the 1st season of the anime.
I put even for the last one because it's kind of a love it/hate it sort of series.
Though I've seen a good amount of recent isekai and they're not all terrible. KonoSuba, Youjo Senki, Grimgar, Isekai Shokudou, and even Overlord I admit they're actually pretty good.
Your generic isekai <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
I'm wondering though, given the chance, could Shem-ha have hijacked Millarc and Elsa as well if need be?
Yeah: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Laconic/DiabolusExMachina
Though not the first time this series has done something of the sort.
It kind of felt like a Diabolus Ex Machina or whatever you call it.
That was my only real gripe regarding episode 12.
I get that Noble Red had parts of Shem-ha within their system thanks to the revival process.
It's been on my mind for a few days.
Can someone explain to me how Shem-ha was able to hijack Vanessa to infect the Balal terminal?
Craallim <:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
I mean I think most villains they tried to make sympathetic except for I think Fine and <:Ver:336656981144109066>.
Smol Millaarc was so adorable though, we can probably agree on that.
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
Since Vanessa is mostly robot.
Or are they too human to have that happen.

I hope the ending is good.
One more sleep before the final episode of the Symphogear series airs.
Because I imagine some people gave up on the series after AXZ for whatever reasons.
I think when things settle down I imagine the sample size will be one slightly smaller than AXZ's.
XV has 16,632 users that have it somewhere on their list.
To put things into perspective again, Kimetsu no Yaiba has 96K users that rated it, and that one Fate series has 7K users that rated it. I bring up those shows in particularly because they also ended today.
I've never seen the sequel effect take affect this drastically on MAL before.
Still I'm shocked it ended up this high.
Someone's been botting Symphogear ratings?
Sequel effect for a relatively niche show for ya <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
To put things into perspective.
AXZ was 7.7, GX was 7.49, G was 7.52, and the 1st season a 7.08.
8.75 BABYYYYYY <:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
https://myanimelist.net/anime/32843/Senki_Zesshou_Symphogear_XV
I'm not all the way through the episode though.
So pretty much every main villain is dead now except for Fudou.
I don't want it to become another Madoka <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I honestly hope Gear ends after this episode. It ended the best way it could've.
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227> came back if only as a spirit which was neat.
I feel like Gear did have something a lot of post-Madoka magical girl shows lacked.
Sixth season <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I kinda want to make a video where the climax song's dubbed over by the beef stroganoff song.
And Maria too I guess.
I think if anything Chris is the waifu bait.
You sure about that m8? <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
>Elfnein waifu bait
I mean I could see an anime about the XDU alternative universe being made, but I don't want that to happen <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
And S1 was at a 7.08 to put things into perspective.
Still haven't watched S3 of that <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
I think this is the first time Ver and the Illuminati trio from AXZ appeared in the same scene if only as spirits.
If Miku-ha and Geah Miku from G were to fight who would win? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
FIST EVERYTHING <:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
Honestly expected a bit more after that.
Like his arc just ended like that.
Only thing that really shocked me was how Fudou just ended the season stuck in prison.
More Basa bullying <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Overhydration <:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
Okay.
Have any of the XV chibi shorts come out yet?
Also what's up with that tier list?

It's sci-fi fantasy magical girls, alright? <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I think XDU might give answers but still.
I wonder how the series would've gone by if Tsubasa was the one killed instead of Kanade.
In the west at least.
I think Discotek only picked up the BD license for the series this year or last year.
Hibiki being free from the curse was basically just one big Cherkhov's Gun that took several episodes to be fired.
People blame Kaneko for everything that goes wrong in Symphogear as much as people blame A-1 Pictures for everything that went wrong in FranXX.
Also when it comes to why Shem-ha just released the Gears after Miku and Hibiki gave a reasoning against Shem-ha's philosophy, it felt like she was testing them in some way.
No Symphogear reboot/spinoff anime please <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Wonder if there would be a kill Miku entirely option.
When solopy said "Edge, On!" I thought about an edgy version of K-On. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Found a post sharing all screenshots of Hibiki saving Miku throughout the seasons: https://twitter.com/AsagiKurosagi/status/1178302170753425408
I really liked the first 6 episodes of it.
I still need to finish that.
They're basically Japan's Disney, with all the faults that come with it.
Kadokawa hold a monopoly in terms of both light novels and like I said before gatcha games.
Kadokawa then decided to damage control but using the seiyuu that had nothing to do with the decision to "apologize".
This then turned out to be a big lie, as Kadokawa did give approval for the Kemono Friends ad they used as an excuse to fire the original director.
So Kadokawa fired the director of the first season of Kemono Friends for "using the characters in an ad without permission".
I think they're still around because gatcha + they hold a few franchises that print money.
Like I said before they have a monopoly on the light novel industry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Kadokawa_Dwango_franchises
On a side note I really want to know how "well" KF2 sold in Japan.
Are there any notable anime/manga that have the Illuminati (either the Bavarian or NWO variant) as a major villain other than Geah and Blue Exorcist?
Oh yeah I forgot PriPri was a co-production.
Not to mention 3hz possibly could be working on other projects between PriPri films.
It's gonna take a while for all the films to be released, let alone them being subbed.
I love that show.
Also in terms of Fall stuff I still haven't watched S3 of My Hero Academia and in terms of stuff I'll likely pick up maybe either Rifle is Beautiful because 3hz or Null Peta because it seems like a genuinely sweet show with a setting I'm interested in.
All 3 have a lot of the same appeal really.
Oh yeah in general I can recommend both Flip Flappers and Princess Principal for Symphogear fans actually.
<:ChrisPadoru:640024920729845780> <:HibikiPadoru:516438720082346004> <:MikuPadoru:640024920805605396>
Though maybe it's not even really the same staff?
It's by a studio I loved the majority of works from.
I expected more from it though.
I'm only watching Rifle is Beautiful and Null Peta. I really really like the latter but the former is just kinda alright.
Excluding sequels just Knight's And Magic, Isekai Shokudou, and Isekai Smartphone.
2017 didn't have that much from what I remember.
I mean isekai only started getting really huge around the time Re:Zero and KonoSuba came out.
The 2nd one I mentioned is getting a third season.
IE: K-On, Non Non Biyori
Cute Girls Doing Cute Things.
Also am I the only one kinda surprised that the CGDCT subgenre isn't dead yet?
I'm not too sure about all that.
Even for sequels we only have Bookworm and Re:Zero.
Excluding sequels new isekai will slow down dramatically this year.
I still believe that Fall 2019 was peak isekai.
The characters in that just play a game.
Inb4 people say it no the Shield Girl thing doesn't count IIRC.
I didn't like the show itself much, but I did like the system set in place by Shinchou Yuusha/Cautious Hero.
Charm Point's Pride <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Ah yes Ragnarok the adaptation produced by a studio known for such classics as *checks notes* Assassin's Pride and Kuma Miko.
I think my favorite's probably KonoSuba and my least favorite would be Smartphone.
I still haven't watched the movie for that.
I mean it was probably the case for the LN sauce too.
Guess they realized that Choyuyu doesn't have much interesting going for it or something and made it <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868> to keep viewers.
Fanservice moments for days.
Oh yeah I've seen Choyuyu screenshots and it tries so hard to make the girls in that attractive.
I don't know why I always forget that Youjo Senki is isekai. Because in most cases it feels like an over-the-top version of a traditional war story from the bad guy's perspective.
is that actually true?

Oh and Youjo Senki.

Log Horizon's one of those shows that actually kept its OP the same through BOTH seasons, even with a studio change.
You can only become anime enough when you eat beef stroganoff <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And the rights to Hibike and Rokka switched IIRC.
The division wasn't very successful.
Their USA division at least.
Pony Canyon licensed like Hibike Euphonium, Rokka no Yuusha, and Denki-gai no Honya-san too.
And they never dubbed anything past S1.
Part of the problem is that I watched S1 in its dub.
I still want to watch the Yuuki Yuuna stuff past S1 one day
J.C. Staff stealing everything <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Bones tends to keep their shows through sequels unlike a lot of series.
I still need to finish S2.
That's a good sign.
I see.
I don't like visiting ANN.
What'd he do?
New director?
Among things like lack of animation techniques such as squash and stretch.
A lot of people at first have trouble transitioning to the more 'limited' animation of anime compared to a lot of the Western stuff.
Eh I think you're underestimating them. Like the OG Eureka Seven and Darker than Black (I know the sequels sucked but still), Space Dandy, and some more 'cult-ish' titles. Not sure if you mean financial success or the quality of these original works.
JC Staff is one of what I like to call "studios that just pick up what the others don't want". Its a bit like this with say Silver Link too.
Its like yuribait + diving how could I not?
Also am I the only one who got Amanchu vibes from seeing Aquatope?
Its one of the few studios I can say is so polarizing.
PA Works is like a really hit or miss studio for me. When their stuff is good they're really good, when their stuff is bad its really bad.
Does it go beyond that?
I've seen mediocre-at-best looking art.
How bad is the MuvLuv anime anyway?
"DAL keep a studio for more than one season challenge." (Actually happening apparently?)
Has there been a JC Staff sequel recently that wasn't a disaster production-wise?
Between the seasons.
For why the staff all changed for OPM.
Part of me wonders what went behind the scenes.
Cause people hate the lizard stuff or something.
I thought S2 was the really bad Overlord season?
Record of Ragnarock <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Also freelancer reliance is a common thing.
They changed it for the movie.
I couldn't even really tell it changed from what I've seen of the movie.
IIRC they kept a lot of the same staff for that one
Apparently though Souma manga went to shit at the same point the anime completely wet the bed so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Like later season Souma, OPM S2, DAL S3, and Index S3 level disaster.
CUTE GOLF DOING GIRLS
MiA author is into loli/shouta shit should've seen this coming TBH <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Is the Gridman anime actually any good or? I've heard a lot of mixed thoughts about it though it is decently popular, enough to make it on Toonami even lol.
Its one of those "creators rights" thing that just ends up being abused by corporations to silence others.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
that's a fucking terrible idea holy shit
Cure Miku now <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
