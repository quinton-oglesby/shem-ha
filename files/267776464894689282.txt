Thought provoking video.
There‚Äôs a moment when you realize that it is not healthy to burn yourself out on writing while simultaneously procrastinating on your schoolwork, and that you probably stop, but can‚Äôt, lest you feel even *more* inadequate than before.
With barely any thunder
Like, lightning on a near constant basis.
This weather is completely insane. Anyone have an explanation?
The slight increase in demand would be nothing compared to that.
> It's just that while a lot about the Nordic model and what its advocates will tell you is absolute horse shit, the part about how just straight-up legalizing prostitution will increase demand which will increase the profitability of human trafficking which will result in more human trafficking (and johns don't care whether they're having sex with a "consenting" prostitute who's making a rational decision between selling sex and being homeless or a trafficking victim who's making a rational decision between putting out and being strangled to death by their pimp) is unfortunately true

Completely random thing that I have to correct because my economics class compels me to:  while legalization would shift the demand curve forward due to it being deemed ‚Äúokay‚Äù by society to at least some degree in some people‚Äôs eyes, the greater impact will be on supply, as deregulation will make it cheaper to overcome some hurdles, thereby reducing the marginal cost. This increases the quantity supplied because that is determined by the point where the marginal revenue equals the marginal cost.

Individually, no. Any one person‚Äôs voice doesn‚Äôt matter, until they can get others to join their voices together.
Do whatever the heck you want, whenever the heck you want. Don't allow yourself to be bound by societal rules and niceties that are contrived and ephemeral in the first place. Follow your heart.

Nothing is Axiomatic, after all.
Spears tended to be 2+ meters long.
Spears are cheaper to produce, more versatile in terms of range, and easier to use. Furthermore, shields and horses are... not necessary when fighting wild animals, as opposed to people.
True enough.

You could just use the spear as a walking stick. *The* spear. Don't bring them for throwing, but for stabbing.
If you're going to be carrying a Longarm, though...
Hot take: if people are in areas where having a longarm would be desired to protect against animals, they should just carry a spear.
Red-Hot Blaze Style?
There are ways to deal with wild animals aside from guns, too.
Honestly, I was just throwing that out as a possibility, not as a solution by any means.
True
Interestingly enough, the US could probably focus on China as an external enemy, but...
Depends on the school, tbh. We talked about that stuff in my high school's APUSH class.
Or a spear.
Again, depends. Zweihanders are basically polearms.
True.
*Note: depends on the sword.
I proposed spears as an alternative to longarms.
Yes, the Arming sword is a sidearm. Yes, it's easier to carry around. However, at the same time, you probably won't be in an at-risk situation doing everyday stuff.
If you're in an area where wild animal attacks are an actual issue, then you're probably also in an area where you have the option to use a spear as a walking stick.
Use it as a walking stick.
That's exactly why. I've heard people call them monoliths, even though they're *metal*.
I'm glad that people here aren't calling them monoliths.
Sometimes, people just want to vent. Not to anyone specifically, but instead just... to get it out.
Something actual pedophiles use to justify their stuff... I think.

And that you shouldn't accuse people of having mental disorders if they aren't.
I would like to put forth a motion that we just ignore tusk.
Also, I looked at gen, and... ah, you brought it up here, that saves time.
At one point, it was. Funny, huh.
You are basically just arguing semantics.
So it's only a mental disorder if it's lolicons?
It *depends*, as with all things.
That depends.
The US voting system practically mandates a 2 party system.

Part of the point of the anime artstyle *is* exaggeration.
Aye
That's the best option, I feel.
So secede.
And the only way to actually achieve it would be through "the" revolution.
How decentralized would it be?
Except that a transition state is infeasible, as basically no state would give up power
I mean, the Black Gungnir Obsessed part was more of an epitath.
That's the first time I've ever been called that, I think.
And the employees would run the organization themselves democratically.
Everything Kaiyo just said is correct.
Or Agorism.
You get Mutualism & stuff, then. Not capitalism.
Capitalism requires a state. So actually no.
One group can be an anarchosydicalist commune, and the other can be mutualist, and even primitivists.
Anarchism opposes Heirarchy.\
That's not anarchism.
Anarchism is very flexible that way.
Depends on the specific group of anarchists.
https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-gelderloos-anarchy-works
Like, actually.
Anarchy.
What we need, is no state at all.

They sometimes lobby for further barriers to entry into their fields.
Eh...
Also, why just DMJii?
Finland, Poland, France. Same Difference.
Poland doesn't exist, it's fine.
This, obviously, raises another question: Anarchist Symphogear Wielders. Yes or no?
There was a lot of stuff directly after the American Revolution that ultimately led to the Articles of Confederation being replaced by the Constitution.
Not just that.
And even then they had a rough transition.
As was France, because they were revolting for... patriarchal liberalism
Facts
Centralization is the opposite of the goal.
I'm of the opinion that it should be built in a grassroots setting, rather than... a political one.

> During the formation of the reproductive system, the paramesonephric ducts are formed just lateral to the mesonephric ducts in both female and male embryos 6 weeks after fertilization.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesonephric_duct
It's much more complicated than that.
"Default" gender is BS, tbh.
And they differentiate or are degraded based on horomones at the time of development.
Like... we actually start with precursors for both reproductive structures.
Honestly... that really doesn't mean anything.
Remember that I'm the sort of person who theorizes methods for how a vampire yuri tragedy manga could work, and calls a system in which neurotoxin precursors are constantly flowing through a person's bloodstream "elegant"
It's elegant in how it works, even when it's broken.
The chaos of biology pleases me.
It's much better than compsci, where everything can be right yet still stuff can go wrong.
Yeah, I'd say that's accurate.
Aye
Basically, leave everything up to the individual, and reach the point where "ability" and "natural state" are meaningless.
I'd say that this is what we really should be aiming for: https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/terra-brix-anarchotranshumanism-this-machine-kills-ability
And honestly, developmental biology, to my knowledge... like, even if we go with the simplified "female default" explanation, I highly doubt it's relevant to being trans.
And M can take over even post-nataly
Personally, I'm of the opinion that the specific explanation doesn't matter, it's not something that's worth researching, and people should be free to be who they are, whoever that may be.
There was a male character in shield hero, that the author, to my knowledge, decided to have been not actually a male because he was actually physically female the whole time.
Also, "You're not actually trans," the... was that in the anime? I stopped watching after a point.
It's also trickle-down economics, the anime.
It's not *just* revenge porn.
The big bad is the very first person who wronged the MC

Naturally.

Gah. Fuck the CCP.
And the community reaction?
What was the situation in Overwatch exactly? It's obvious they acted as the CCP's lapdogs, but what exactly did they do?
Are people just that shallow?
Question. Why is there so little Anti-CCP backlash towards Genshin? Like sure, no ethical consumption under capitalism and all that, but *maybe* not spending money on stuff that actively supports, say, Genocide, is at least worth *trying*.
The point isn't to look to one or the other as worse, it's to do what is in your power to be better. While there may not be many things that don't support either, there are things that support them less.
And it's possible to look to alternate, marginally more ethical alternatives.
That doesn't mean that it's not prudent to minimize using them.
I suppose that "one" would be a better pronoun, but that's beside the point.
You in the plural sense.
Basically, my point is that every little bit counts, and even if you may not consider it activism, it's better than being more complicit than you already are.
I'm not bragging about it.
The problem is that if you believe *nothing* can be done, therefore nothing is worth doing, and if enough people believe that...
So you will do nothing? At the very least, *try* to minimize the support you're giving to the CCP.
So? If you refuse to hold a position because it's difficult, then you've already lost.
Change starts with you.
Refusing to act because you'll be supporting them anyway is... honestly, it's one of the things that's rotten about modern society. Apathy is Death.
And?
*Looks at Catalonia & Ukraine*
Personally, I couldn't be sure that a confederation wouldn't try to eliminate the anarchist society.

"Statist" is more a part of Ancap discourse.

It's because the Bolsheviks won, and forever changed the "face" of communism.

So Center in terms of auth vs lib?
Regardless, to my knowledge, Marxism-Leninism is synonymous with Stalinism.

If elections actually changed anything, they'd be illegal.
Also, it's ultimately just appeasement, when you think about it. Asteroid mining would just make the hyperclass happy for the new materials, even as they continue to tank the environment further. What we need to do is to *break* them.
That's not what the capitalist overlords told us.
It's worth noting that asteroid mining wouldn't fix the whole "fossile fuel" issue.
I am incensed that this can still be allowed to happen..

*Throws ball at a wall*

If, for some reason, birthrates worldwide fell drastically, at such a rate that it would be likely for the human species to become extinct within... 1-2 centuries, how do you think we'd respond? Would our choice, whatever it may be, be right?
My rule of thumb is that anyone who gets offended as opposed to confused when they're called a kid... is a kid.
That's the essence of the question, though. Does it matter if humanity ends up extinct or not? *Should* we go against it?
Assume that... some percentage of each generation is born impotent/infertile, and every couple ends up having no more than two kids, if not one.
That's why I talked about drastically falling birthrates.
Basically, if humanity was going extinct, without anything actively killing us, would it be correct to oppose that?
It wouldn't be "no humans born after 2 centuries," it'd be "no humans alive after 2 centuries"
Eh, it's low-effort political action. It might be petty, but it's better than nothing.

It is possible that they‚Äôre playing the long con and trying to destabilize politics like they did during the Arab Spring so *they* can become the true rulers of the world! 

...Or something like that.
Honestly, it's mildly tempting to go into conspiracy theory territory with them.
Apparently they're also looking into establishing a right-leaning outlet as well. Which is... like, at least have the decency to be consistent.
> Al Jazeera Media Network (AJMN) is a Qatari international public media conglomerate headquartered at Qatar Radio and Television Corporation Complex in Wadi Al Sail, Doha.[1][2] It is the parent company of International Arabic news channel Al Jazeera and other similarly branded factual media operations. Initially launched as an Arabic news and current affairs satellite TV channel, it has since expanded into a network with several outlets, including the internet and specialty television channels in multiple languages and beyond. The chairman is Sheikh Hamad bin Thamer Al Thani.[8][9] The acting director general is Mostefa Souag.[4]

From Wikipedia
From what I see, predominantly international issues.
AJ+ confuses me deeply. Heard about them when a video from them -- something along the lines of "Eat the Rich" -- was recommended, and that's also how I found out that they were funded by Qatar. I did some digging, and just... it makes no sense. On one hand, the content they make is clearly based, but on the other, well... Qatar itself is very much not based, shall we say.
On another hand...

I mean, to be fair, another one can be true at times. Strikes harm productivity, or at least production.
True enough.
In terms of tactics, I'd say that's fair, but I find far more people talking about the latter while ignoring the former.
True, but I'd argue that in most cases, the exploitation of workers is *far* more egregious than exploitation of consumers. Unless you're talking about, say, the housing market, but I'd consider that to be largely outside of "Consumer Politics"
Y'know, whenever I hear modern, consumer-oriented discourse, my brain kinda stalls. Like... okay, cool, you're peeved that not everyone will be able to buy this piece of media. Whatever. Let's talk about the workers who made and are making that piece of media possible. Maybe it would be better to focus on how they're being exploited instead of consumers being exploited.

Uh, Seria...
I'll go Egg
Hm... Egg or Gekidol first? How do I want my mind to be screwed?
You know what I mean?
Like, I guess the best way to describe it, the way I see it, is that it takes an at least seemingly-generic plot structure, but writes it intelligently.
Only the first episode is out so it has plenty of room to fall?
What would I be lying about?
Watched episode 1 of Seven Knights Revolution, and it is actually not that badly written. There are no real elements of a harem plotline, people make intelligent decisions, and the male lead *doesn't* overshadow the female lead. Not something you'd expect from a show with its immediate aesthetic. I'd say I recommend it.
