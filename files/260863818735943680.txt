*WHY*

Tbh Biki makes a good point
THE GOD DAMN CURSE OF BALAL STRIKES AGAIN
OOOH
Oh
It aint that hard
"do that for your friend"
"sure"
Problem solved
Shed do anything for miku
What the fuck
Instead of, kidnapping her friend?
Just ask her?
How to use it
Biki is like a permanent planetary threat
Why he's dumb
Remember how 3 gals stopped a NUKE?
America has ***what***
Sentinel my ass he couldn't do anything without the symphogears
"but I wanna be the sentinel"
They have 0 risk of being threatened
They have literally the strongest weapons
Why are they so insistent on getting power
Dumb bitch
Diabolo can kill anyone whyd is he  scared if his identity is leaked
For a stupid reason
I'm betting he gets killed or redemptionned
Fuudo is an annoying old fuck
My favorite char is Shirabe Kirika
Dess
"since when can humans do that"
What if they brought back the berserker mode
If she dies, whatver killed It will get beheaded by biki
Miku won't die
The best thing in Anime is hiding a thing way too big out of sight
Titty missile
For the third season in a row
Again
Or they do epic hero redemption
Forgiven
Or they get purged or something
Batgirl killed a lot of people
I mean
Biki would come back from the dead by the power of miku love
Big ol eyes
Until we get new episode
How many howers
I hope it builds up
tsubasa
basa
lewd
Show me Chris beeg sword
Is there  mrre
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Also why not try each other's symphogears
Chris doesn't cosplay enough
*remembered
Kirika's transformation is ra as kew as I thought
also they did the autoscorers dirty
"its the secod time today, god damn"
yeet
the other half running
elfnein spending half the episode on the ground lol
LETS GO ELFNEIN
SPIDER MAN
BAD MAN
what th hell is a lulu ameru
so we got a god killer and a  destroyer of miracles ?

here
i thought shed keep being edgy
im surprised basa kinda got over it
i confused garie and big hand girl
whops
lol when do we get gear car  paint
~~even if gungnir would fit way more~~
AutoSymphogear
Give Garie Ichival
i feel bad for them
shame
yeah they were really broke
well they can be repaired
*dies*
"lol nah"
"we back"
what about airgeltram
circles ?
whats Shirabe's theme ?
usually its "desu"
yea
its anime girl for innit
translating suck then
death
deah
also does kirika say death or dess
isnt it greek
"kept you waiting, huh ?"
or evn
"i lived, bitch"
or
"Missed me?"
yeah indeed
shes gonna piss on the moon
"you dum or somtheing, i kill gods this doesnt do shit"
"thanks to my god powers i can now make you unable to use gungnir"
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
mecha arm, berserk arm, real arm, sympogear arm and almagamation arm
bruh
thatd be funny
ha
hibik style : gay punch
*shoots*
hibiki style : gun
idk how to say it
idk
Maria id say its
Tsubasa has glorious nippon
mass
what happened to the sword ?
well belserk elfnein is just carol
also a sheild
also a cannon
airgelram ?
is it just a mixed bag
bad dads cause mass genocide
good dads get killed
but they were both killed
oh yeah
like what the heck
is carol's dad the only good dad ?
damn dads in symphogear are badly treated
where you see all the chaeacherts that died
im betting all my davings that theres gonna be a big spirit punch at the end
XV is just reference city
its her being chuni ?
gods make miracles
not really
idk
the moon ?
what i like about symphogear is that we cant predict where its gonna go nexr
inb4 the nephilim uses the corrupted fragment to regenerate and become the living gungnir
also the enemies are real annoying
theres 100% gonna be a sacrifice
use the nephilim to fight god
lol
any ptoblem he needed to fix were fixed
i mean he couldnt do anything
he wont come back
but hes funny
tbh we dont need gim back
ver is the best part of the show
make ver return
whatsagaijin
gaijin ?
what about the tomato woman from AXZ
but 2 white haired girls is too much
not dream scenario
you said "nightmoare scenario"
OH YES
ver comes back and wears a syphogear ? <@90164247643828224>
kanade is even more dead
dr ver will not be back
and it exloded
hes even in another dimension
the nephilim is 100000000000000000000% dead
wait wait
well he was hibiki'd
on paper their motivation dont seem that evil
hm
ver wants to be a hero
fine wants to fuck someoen
this season's girls want to be human
Carol doesnt like mirales
adam doesnt like clothers
in a flashback ?
when ?
if they do any more resurrections im gonna lose it
i swear if they ressurect adam or something
it has a spider abdomen
smh
its a beeg spider
also it aint a blob of tentacles
it makes total sense
i mean he's human
i dont think theyre gonna pull out a "this person was your dad"
dead
wait they never really fought the symphogirls
"oh wow theyre real weak"
carol uses the powers and downs the three of them in one move
looking cool, Gugnir !
basa calls herself a sword
kirika become a guillotine
i mean
killin fudou fixes a lot of problems
Chris summons the nehustan armor
then biki shoots chris
biki become big hand and chris becomes big gun
lmao
chris becomes a gun
lol
it lirerally was a tribute summon
i mean
i sacrifice the 4 autrosocrers and elfnein  to summon MIRACLE BREAKER CAROL
where its battle time carol takes over elfnein
no its literally like yu-gi oh
THAT RIGHT
Kal-el
wait a minute
they fuse and become Carel
nah
what season
inazuma as in from inazuma eleven ?
also whats beef stroganoff from
stefan!!!
you know you can like a charachter without wanting to fuck em
how much you wnana bet theres gonna be another silver/gold attack at the end of this season
they literallly do what they want in symphogear
also because its fun
isntead of "toys"
you know ou can call them "figurines" ?
drink the autoscorer juice
yeah
over anyone elser
who likes basa tho
cast a wide net and youll get a lot of different fish
symphogi
fair
hm
platinium is a company
uh becvause "warriors" is a genre
i wanna mega deth party some people
when do we get a warriors but symphogear
good
thats basically a joker card
yeah but she has the GEAAAAAAH power
but not tittier
shes taller
it did age her
idk
says the tiny girl
"i am the breaker of miracles"
look at this
she went too hard in the wash
shes shrinked lmao
oh lol
shes like 1.5 times the height of elfnein but shes a loli alright
sure
okay
"because she doesnt have beeg tits it makes her a loli"
garie iss ballet
yeah micha doesnnt dance
the other 3 dance
forgot her name
hm
big claw girl doesnt have a dance
wait thats just the autoscorers
but it works with dancing isntead of singing
symphogear
giant robots
demonic powers
elemental powers
the 7 deadly sins
angels
that and
yeah
probably another anime
persona 5 too
i rhink its probably something like elfnein with caro'ls persnality
maybe its her inner chuuni coming out
why you so mad
wasnt there a preview ?
in the afterlife

time to die shirabe
hm
shes the only one who didnt swan song
is shirabe gonna die ?
to kill any of the gear users
you know what'd be a power move
"who is that"
so you cant do shit
but its your boss's pet fly
that you could crush
its like an annoying fly
noble red is a joke
let that sink in
its more probable for Dr Ver to come back than to hibiki and Miku to go  on a romantic date
and airgerltam was a a gear made to absorb divine power
inb4 the bracleet is part of airgeltram
step 3 : you now have a full squad of divine  pwoer squad
step 2 , blast the Symphogirls
step 1, give miku shenshou jng
lol
hate and love are interchangeable
also fused with noise , alca-noise and the nephilim
she finally became one with her lover
and anu
adam is back and he fuses with fudou , saint germain's dad and DR Ver
cause he was the final boss the whole time
and then saint german's dad is the final boss
and then theu kill  him
then fudou comes in and absorsbs all the residual divine power
and then do a final ultimate attack
each of the symphogals are gonna kill one
the custodians gonna come down
they gonna go sicko mode
its gonn abe morre
no
seven billion ?
lol
literallt a tribute simmon
unless youre Cagliostro, Carol or the autoscorers
well your udually dead forever
just kanade
no basa anymore
tsubasa is gonna regress into kanade
lol
what are they doing
LAOS
whos headpattting
look good
they gonna make weakened carol in elfnein's body
dess
"i am death"
baby
*person
in both  love and hate you spend a lot of time thinking about the other persona
"you talking mad shit for someone in hamster range"
from blazblue
taokaka
who is 100%  not
dark hamster mode
bring back hamster mode
didnt ecpect that, didja
biki is the final boss
and then
becomes hamster
biiki eats the soul
series ends
no one sees any problem
because hes just an old man
and then fudou dies
"wake the fuck up samurai, we have a planet to save.é
how is he the head of the assiociation of whtever ?
i remember now
aahah
grandpa is her dad ?
what the hell
??
is he her *dad*
wait
Is Carol too deep
Why
Don't elfnein and Carol have the same va
Shomi
Do we have an image of the cute basa
Too big
She got succed up
No reason for genocide
*resurrects Carol's dad*
Watch this
All of the alchemists?
She didn't go all out
Green girl is a sword breaker and uses a sword
And hibiki is a godkiller and a god
Small Carol
Yehh
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
<#377148557796442134>
Never heard of it
Remember the part where fudou did a nice thing for Basa?
What is it  <@90164247643828224>
I don't think any character would be sad if fudou was gutted right the fuck now
Even if, she saved Japan many many times over
Tfw you trigger your daughter's PTSD
She's a hair from breaking down
She looks sick kinda
Do they actually care about noble red?
Maybe it's just Carol's memories
>Autoscorers
Inb4 Biki has to sacrifice memories to defeat the big bad
Sometimes they sing for the shit of it
Yeah but shes nt alone
Fudou is the Head of the organisation
Pfffff
What's underdog
Why didn't she sing in the first place
GENOCI- I mean
They're gonna sing both art the same time
Noble red is probably gonna get gutted by the big villain
Lol
Duet from the same body
What's a carol
This is the best image so far
Lmao

I didn't like the part where the baby was yeeted
Whos dat
One or two minutes?
How long was Kanade Alive on screen, not in flashbacks
I want to see the end but I don't want to see it end
Would she sing Bad Apple
If Maria became evil
Okay but
You mean Apple
Can't wait for the chain Swan song and then the mzdley of all the endigg themes
What?
Stock?
Fudou album
Cagliostor Album
Serena album
Dr Ver surprise album
Fuckin pissing me off
UwU woman titties *blush*
A virgin baby
He's also fuckin
If he abused the levelling level or something like that
He just has high base stats
He's not  a cheater at all
Could have been more interesting
It's name was wasted
Except its name
It has nothing of its own
But this has NOTHING
Kenja no mago at least had something like, good animation sometimes and the main character gets with his love interest
Its so generic it pisses me offf
I swear I've heard this one somewhere
Butchered adaptation wihh bad CG
Mao sama has trash animaiion, Arifureta has bad CG and isekia magician is blerrrrrrrrgh
Big dude is named Mount fuji
The fuckin tavern owner is called noma noma yei
All the characters are basically jokes
That's what makes it endearing tho
Dumb
And maou sama retry is uh
At least Arifureta mc is edgy as fuck with a gun
"get off my lawn, punks"
"I'm boutta use the tuffauge château to commit some war crimes brb"
"you talking mad shit for someone in Genocide Range"
Is that not what they are
what's in the box
I can't wait for Tsubasa's hair to become orange
Also  Carol acting Tsun
Did shem ha always had baby legs
Symphogear is like the final boss of a sonic/jrpg, but all the time
Mashing that ignite button
Quintuple ignite
My bad
Can't wait for the amalgam x drive ignite berserk Swan song
Horns!
Wait wrong mythology
Like zeus or something
Ususally it's the other way around
They go X-Ignite mode
She teams up with carol
And then
Isn't that what she's been doing all tje time though
Gods are gay
That'd be a spicy meatball
And Biki goes Berserk
If they make it so that fudou kills miku for tee divine power
I swear
BRI
Bruh
Saint German is the gloves
Which one
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
Biki be like : who you gonna bring back lol
Inb4 anu brings back people from the dead to haunt people
Being the god of the gods is better than being the god of anything
Yeah but
I mean it's Baal, close enough
You mean Borrowed power ?
Tsubasa tries ol megasword but one of the reactors jams
Chris becomes a gun
Theory
Becomes god²
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Adam fuses with fudou
Also every time fudou is on scren he just insults people
Tfw Adam wasn't the real villain
Fudou has the meme eyes
"wait fuck"
"sure *unhinges jaw*"
A very fucked up bird
The noise noise
The one that doesn't sound like anything
You know the one
Noise - Noise noise
Kirika - Green
Carol - Ribcage
Name a more iconic couple

Miku - being controlled
Tsubasa - swofd
Wait this is just power rangers
Milaarc is gonna get flayed by Basa before the series ends
That'd be hilarious though
Can't believe fudou was Dr Ver the whole time
What the hell
7 billion Swan songs?
Carol also is busted as hell
Problem solved
Jam the linker
Never trusted him
>trusting fudou
The whole ass noble red kills people because "Uguu I'm a monster"
Millarc don't
Yeah but Saint Germain felt actually bad for the people she killed
Can't wait for them to each be one knuckle in hibiki's fist at the end
Have they even interacted with each other?
That's literally the closest Chris and Maria have ever been
Also can we talk about that titty touch?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Option D) miku dies and Biki dies
It's all just a big karaoke
Waiiit
Elfnein is the karaoke persona
Carol is the battle persona
They're going on and off
"damn time to save the ones who were about to kill me"
Hm
Ah
Yeah but she has Carol brain
That's what I mean by carol/elfnein
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Yeah but Carol has been awakened
Fucking hell
But they go with old man japan
The strongest alchemist
Elfnein/Carol is literally
You chose the old man over the team with 7 weapons of mass destruction and THE BEST POSSIBLE DOCTOR FOR YOUR CONDITION
If they literally just talked with Biki instead of going stupid mode everything would have been fixed
I'd be baffled if they somehow redeem any of Noble red
To see who killed more people
We need a kill count at the end
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Wait a minute
But they were both duped by the evil evil man
And at least had a purpose for killing them
Saint Germain is old af
Also
Noble sacrifice lol
Everyone is their enemy
What are they gonna do though
Problem solved
Why doesn't she yeet the moon into the sun
Piss on the moon
Shem ha :weak body
Old man :me
Shem ha : no
*Maria
Oh Inb4 Mario is a reincarnation
What's a lala limuel
There isn't a royal family
Shem ha is gonna open the gate all gods are gonna fall down
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Wait a fuckin
Attacking earth at the same time
Lots of God's?
Ragnarok?
What next?
Inb4 shem-ha is Fines Child or something
It's a restraining order
Oh shit
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Enki Balal?
Wait
No curse of balal
Shower the world with symphojuice from biki
I know
Ah hmm
Destroying Ichi Al breaks the curse of balal
Curse of Ichibaalal
She also has hair ears
Can't wait for the Fudou Adam Moon nephilim Shem Ha Custodian fusion
Option I)
Chris tsuns so hard the fabric of space-time is broken and the nephilim comes back
Apple Dainsleif
Waiiir
Bass boosted apple plays while he's bleeding out
Option G)
 fudou goes outside and gets killed by a falling apple
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Nice spoilers
Wait whos enki again and when was he stabbed
The real secret is that Biki's fluff is natural
Were gods made afte humans or were humans made after gods
Lol
What is a god though
Beeg punch
I hope they pull a TTGL
Every single god is a nalien
All gods are aliens
So mecha gods
I see
Borrowed power : Odin
Inb4 the gears are the personnification of Gods
"Biki gives up on fucking mind control and manipulation for the fifth season in a row"
Maybe shem ha just wanted to be a cute girl
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
What does that have to do with you spoiling
Color changed relic? Simple but clever
Awesome
Tiara looking thing?
Horns? Cool af
Shenshou Jing
Why are the legs so yuge
Ugley legs
My bet is that shirabe is the top
Shame
Go on a long speech please
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Who gets spanked
What about Shirika
Miku is 100% a top
What are basa's good points tho
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I mean she's the least popular of the 3og girls
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Inb4 basa dies and joins back wihh Kanade in the afterlife
Airgeltram bs, her ancestors/apple, and more
Maria is gonna 100% do something
I mean
I've seen a whole lot of series with hiroyuki sawano ost
Indeed
Something something I say fire
Something something are you still my family
Something something vogel im kafig
Something something perfect time
*light blaring*
*trumpets blaring*
*heel slam*
Kill la kill ost sounds serious as hell
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Akatsuki like in naruto?
They don't reallt work together
Also symphogear and sawano music wouldnt be good tbh
Can't wait for it to be re-summoned
Wasn't Dainseif destroyed or something
Biki with golden hair when
Isnr that how it was
Would gungnir be gg then?
Everytime I see ssj I think of super sayiajin
Miku
Who did he hurt really though
We should have let Adam destroy shemha
Shem-ha more like dead
But yeah sure let's throw a nuke at the hornet nest
You have 6 walking mass destruction weapons that could level a city in seconds, without any cost or loss of energy
Like, the répercussion on the US could be easily 10000x worse
And the US had balls of fuckin steel
Fucking what the hell
They thow it at *Japan*
One
The Us would be slammed
I almost hoped they didnt stop the nuke out of spite
America *did* throw a whole ass nuke
I'm gonna ram you with my fucking meteorite and if you survive that means I'm not guilty?
"but it didn't hit"
Excuse me?
Like.???? What????
"the US throwed a nuke for the third time and it was considered a war crime"
"no big deal"
Ah yes leave the Hyper nuke on standby
What's Maria's last name
Is what I mean
A "funny" or "clever" namz
Tsubasa is wing
Well, if both of pour parents dying is normal
Second to Miku
She's the most normal person
Is Chris the only one without a weird name?
Was it only fine and Chris?
Who were the season 1 villains
"she may look like a child but shes hundreds of years old"
Use phonic gain
Pshh
Literally
My armed gear is the sun
Oho
My armed gear is activating Tsubasa's PTSD
Oh **shit**
Didn't Kanade have a Spear?
"my armed gear is the Spear that will pierce the heavens"
Fuse Dainsleif and Durandal to make the **real** gungnir
Dual weild
Lol use the château to turn back the Dainseif fragment to the whole ass Dainseif
Ah

Holup what?

Why don't we drop him into the ocean or something
Fudou isn't even that strong

But there's only enough energy to bring back one of them
They both die
Mutual assured destruction with Mibiku
Ooh
Bruh
So improve, adapt, ovetcome
Ooh
It was destroyed because no phonic gain or something?
Bruh
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Dr Ver becmme one with the château
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
What if Dr Ver is Dr Ver
Who's kaneko
What if Dr Ver is the symphogear
I'd pop off like hell
Explosions are bs
Pfff
<:Ver:336656981144109066> <:Ver:336656981144109066> <:Ver:336656981144109066>
>Ver takes over Maria's body
Bruh
Doubt there's even a body
Rotting?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
He becamd a god
Ver is actually a Custodian now
They were never alive in the first place
Well it was in her memories subconscious
Dr Ver came back

Watch this
Shame
How did Durandal get bapped
Oh the VA
Hikasa?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Maria dies of embarrassment and becomes so weak now Ver is the dominant personality
And with how much Maria hates Ver it makes it grrrreat
Thinking of the stupidest "Ver comes back" stories is fun as hell
<:Ver:336656981144109066> <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Ver DNA
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
*reactivates the château to remake the staff or babylon*
Hmm
Cue super mega ultra transformation
Brings a lot of noise with him
And tears a hole into the space-time
Inb4 the nephilim ate a shit lot of Noise
Bruh
Instead of the megablade 5000
Bad weapon
Ah yes let's use the uh
Ooga booga sentinel
>ah she doesn't need friends
>symphogear literally become busted as fuck by pairing up
>the symphogear is a weapon highly reliant on emotions and *singing*
>yeah let's make an emotionless sentinel
How strong is fudou
Cause he's an asshole probably
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Ver has such a strong personality that he took over the nephilim and is now the nephilim
Featuring the corpses of noble red on the side
Vs the symphogals and Carol
Nephilim arm goldy power fudou
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Inb4 Dr Vet's arm is a relic too
Wentucky Fucking Carol
Who's WFC
Shame-ha can you turn back the château on?
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
Can't wait for the château to cheer up Basa by taking Kanade's voice
Doesn't Elfnein have some alchemy knowledge?
Pfft fuck if I know
Why do the enemies always get it?
The best single use item
The "Red alchemist flask"
Ah yes
Wait wasnt it turn lead to gold or something
Bronze
That's right
What's the opposite of gold
Wait
Copper?
What's the green fire for
Fixed

What string
Oh wait that was biki
Remember when she jumped off a building
Does miku have a fetish for being mind controlled or something?
Poor little blue bird
She needs therapy, not training
Basa already went berserk
Last season
We already got one berserk
I mean
Tch
On a scale from one zesshou without linker to Carol With dur da bla, how likely is it for Biki to go berserk in XV
"we aren't in an anime"
Didn't it get bombed by the gang?
Biki bullying Chris is good
Chris has friends
Basa is still coping with Kanade being gone
Maria is just really lonely huh
You wouldn't know if I told you
I could say ||basa gets stabbed by Fudou||
If only you knows what's under the tag
What's the point of putting spoiler tags
Why would i
Because I don't
Yeah
Whats that mean
"friends"
I have ***never*** heard anyone say "DMJII"
Oh shit
Kirby
Kirabe
Wait
Or you could say Shirika or Kirabe
Since when?
Wh
Who's Djmii
Lmao
Wait
They aren't that strong when Biki isn't there tbh
By all-out I mean obliteration
I can't wait for the all out gun battle between Vanessa and Chris
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Her face too I think
Isn't her brain human?
She thicc
I'm betting Vanessa and milaarc die but dog girl lives
What are the chances that the whole noble red survives
I'm sure they didn't look like that
Wait are those the friends?
Is there even a non-romance only anime without any mythology?
I mean
What?
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Gee I wonder whats the Gungir from
What does Maria do actually
I read what's in the anime
Yeah but I don't read titles
Something something tomato
Yea that
How they started calling their special move Zanana out of nowhere?
You know what's weird
Mamu
Uh oh linker ran out!
And they they kiss
"thanks my sunshine"
I'm betting the next episode is gonna go
"get out of miku"
"no"
"shem ha punch"
"oof"
"miku fighting back"
"ah yes I'm freed from evil god"
Ver from the grave
Who made the anti linker
Lmao
Can't you make miku un-pure so shemha gets yeeted out?
Wait
Oh
Tainted by the eveeel
They don't need that anymore
Oh yeah
That is a protagonist's power
Biki solves problems just by existing
To black alchemy?
What wad the idiot  Stone for again
It's a gungnir specicif thing
Biki is strong even without her gear
Hibiki beats you up in an alleyway (ASMR)
God :exists
Biki : You have a lot of nerve being alive
Without needing to sing?
By herself?
Did Biki one-shot the shem ha cocoon
Waiiit
Chris has big tids
Oh wait no its sad
*unzips*
What missing character
Big shame there isn't amalgam x drive ignite
As long as we can add more descriptors to the move, I'm fine with it
You fuse the girls
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
But of the girls
Amalgam
Oh wait
Bruh
I totally forgot her name
Oh
Yes
Who's elsa
It's like one of the dudes who conytol the S.O.N.G ship attacking biki
Self preservation isnt attacking the equivalent of the strongest member of the association you were in
They have 0 reason to attack her
A fight you have to be able to beat your enemy
She didn't?
She got like big wings on her legs
Especially in Xdrive
Okay is it judt me or does amenohabakiri's leg propulors look kinda goofy
Whatever its called
The fuckin arm cross sword
That what makes it coil
Ignite is black though
Then that means Chris doesn't get an upgrade
Four arms though
Instead of partly
For example basa's sword becomes fully blue
Like biki's gloves
Maybe not a gold trim but maybe a flat color+ shiny
Shame she didn't
Let's say a murderer passes by you aren't you gonna stop him
I mean they're allies of the big bad
Do they live on the song boat
Millarc is just a meat vampire
What is a human even
Human?
Divine power
God in the machine
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
>deus ex machina
>>symphogear
The most damage tbey did was psychological damage to Basa and Miku
I feel like noble red is way too un threatening
I think that was the point
Yeaj the turtle spin
S2ca hexaconverter
Or
GIGA
GEAR
BREAK
Piss on the moon
Not as in religious
Jews are a race though
Bruh
>in an argument
>>shut the fuck up
Who says that though
Yeah how about that sword though
>symphogear
Like older people aren't
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
You don't
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
"you're young, so you're stupid"
Hey how about
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
I mean it's true
Bruh
So is Elfnein
How do you know
Are noise people?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Bruh
Does linker have a countereffect?
Linker am I right
Ver is funny
Who's topdad
Show please
Is Biki with long hair a thing?
She got no tits
Is elsa a loli?
What's even her character
What does prelati do
I have a question
And the first time it killed her best friend
For the second time
Because 70k people died "because of her"
Also basa is a trained soldier
Does Milaarc have ptsd though
I'm having ***fun***
So basa is a nazi?
What law is there in magic spandex land
Does it work though
Hero is person who saves people
What if the enemy is a demon though
I'm trying to see which part says genocide is good
No!
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
It's not personal though
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
What's your adress so I can arrest you
Maybe not if you're a Kanade-liking mouthbreather
This joke is
It's called a joke
Why you getting mad
Trolls ?
Ver and Kanade having a melodramatic-off in the afterlife
Isee
Aaa
Whars that mean
Chewing the scenery?
Tsubasa beats Milaarc to death using her bare fists while singing (ASMR)
Cause Ver is dead
Ahok
Isn't linker a multiplier
Papow
Jam Carol full of linker
Wanst it 10k
How many did Milaarc kill!
Yes
How many people did she kill again?
Oh
Who's SG
If Saint Germain is roman why is her name in french
Fine lived for a fuck load of time
At the end of the series we should see who killed the most people after Carol
What about the US
Even though she could have
Also prelati didn't do anything to stop her from killing people
Biki talks the other blast
Not used
Should we let allies of murderer go?
Also basa isn't a hero she's a sentiel
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Tsubasa is a noise
80k for 5 concerts is a high kill count
/kill
"shame"
Milaarc be like
That probably won't affect basa's ratings
Whoops
Symphogals, in unison : you get used to it
And then we have a whole load of other problems on our hands
Then the non powerfillable gets gutted by noble red
Yeah but what if one of them actually isn't
Pop fudous head like a grape
TOPDAD IS BACK
"singing won't protect the world"
>>>>>>Bruh
The dude who killed her dad was saved
She got mind fucked for what she lives for
Her dad died
Bruh
They fucking love to torture basa
I swear
Also
It looks more like an hotel
Like most people
Yeah?
I fell like Biki had a different voice when talking to him
Only good and alive dad
TOPDAD actually tries to be a dad
Lewd lol
/dies
"what's this"
They died in 3 seconds
GONE
Noble red
Fucking
Bruh
Oh and let's not even talk about shemha
By her boss
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Delete the least used emtte
New emote?

Do we have a Ver with a big ass grin?
They don't deserve pity
That it was horribly anticlimatic
I think that was the goal
Because the feedback system is used on miku
Shemha didn't do anything evil yet
To be fair
Golden whatver airgetrlam is
Golden scythe
Golden missile
Also the amalgam weapons are confirmed to be gold
How in the fuck
Fudou is a monster
That's it
Esla has tail thing
But can Milaarc regen!
So she's prolly alive
Vanessa is made of robot
He probably loved that sword more than he loves Basa
Thinjuro
So waifu mecyas?
About
What it avoir
What's grandbelm
Flashback to that one Basa animation
Enki is actually the moon
Saturday is a good day
Demon slayer and Symphogear both are on the same day
https://youtu.be/rTVPK5i7pqk
Noble red_irl
Oh so she *lied*?
Is turning trees and ground into silver easier?
Why can't it turn them back into humans
If shemha is a god
This reminds me of that one episode of Dr who
Adam's apple?
WAIT A MINUTE
You can't perfect perfection
Or, "if it aint broke, don't fix it"
Alchemy
I mean
Vanessa said "so we can't turn back into humans"
And then she said "that's what becoming a perfect monster implies"
Not an emote jusr an image
Is there a smug miku?
Anyone has a picture of shemha looking angry
What's this from
Wait isnt there a frame where she has the Amalgarms stretched out
It's for a meme
Or anyone really
Is there picture of Biki with outstretched arms?
Oh its Hastsune Micha
You know what'd be funny if marioa s transformation music was apple
Maria's amalgam be like
Isn't fine perma dead now?
Why is Milaarc by far the strongest of noble Red
He won't come back
Isn't that just normal adamn?
Is adamn in the game?
Ah
Which alchemist
It didn't look like symphogears
Also when I watched the start of the episode I was hella confused
Why don't they
Soon™
Shemha
Lmao
Who is gonna use WHAT
Where did he die again
Biki's dead arm
Aitgeltram
Fuckin
What's with symphogear and arms
Nephilim dick
Nephilim is in noise dimension
Be in a flashback
Isn't that what he did
I mean
*proceeds to assblast them*
Why not
Why don't they summon alcanoise to fight alcanoise
"change da world, my final message, goodbye"
-Fine
Carol musics hard
Final boss is actually Genjuro
Also the animation was pretty good
Gwah
Chris titties >all of the antagonists combined
Do de have images?
Like come on
What's with villains and being horny
Gwah
Shemha got no arm joints
Someone who thinks they're special but they aren't?
She's walking like a "special snowflake"?
You mean like naruto?
Milaarc got away 100% Scott free
Dead ass
Can't believe they used the espada's resurrections
I can bet 1 billion dollars there's gonna be Hajimari no uta in the last episode
Hot
Biki beats shemha to death using her bare fists
Ogawa's family is hot
Noo
Us president nooo
Oh noooo
Oh no
"Why are you doing this"
"racism"
"Pff crying for incomplete human? Such dumb dumb"
"Carol dies"
"Bakana shemha is too strong" 
"take this, the last of my phonic gain" - Carolnein
"yamero"
Inb4
I swear I've seen that hair/cloth into fire transformation before
Also Vanessa kinda turned into
He is now cancelled
Président of the us did nazi salute
Also
Ichival is long-range weapons
No
So ichival is actually a bow?
She's hou jeeng
Full power Fist
Hibili is actually the og custodian
Go, Biki Go Biki, Go biki
Half of the people she helps reject her help
I feel bad for biki
Wouldn't it be NR
Who's NB
Fudou's redemption arc is being thrown into the sun and extending the sun's lifespan for a few seconds
Ive watched it
I know
Kinda feel sorry for her
Like come on
Elsa just got tossed around a few times and then got hit with the mf double Amalgam
That's what you call saving?
Or God that doesn't give a half of an atom's shit about them
If life sucks so much why didn't they side with the people that actually wanted to help them instead of the dude who lives only for Japan
They did
The future of the earth can suck my toes
And?
People who kill 10k people usually don't get a peaceful death
Yeah?
Noble Red got away free of charge
Literally
I also didn't mean the FE one
It does magic
It's a magic Bow
Atio
Yewfell
What mythology
??
Real shame we won't get ignite xdrive amalgam
Because its from symphogear mytnology
It's Airgeltram that isn't from mythology
Read this
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/Norse/comments/7rtnk8/ichaival/
Best defense is attack
She's a map
True villain is tomato woman
What did he do again?
What evil did Adam do
Kinda
Adam wasn't a bad guy but had bad methods
She burning all the memories
And then they kissed
And actually each of the nobles are weapons for the Autoscorers to become real persons
Shem ha takes control
It eats shem ha and spits miku
👀
Biki summons the nephilim
Nahhhh
We had no way of knowing
Who would guess that the genocidal one will kill everyone
If so that's some kinky shit
If you get choked while in gear mode can you breathe?
Okay but
Lesbians?
What doesnt awaken an evil god
Also how do you think they sing in space
Also phonic gain can be converted into air
Gears give air
What arc
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Is basa the bottom or the top
Less tits?
Uh
Chris dies
I mean you aren't going to remove a color from the palette
And she's actually the final boss
Inb4 biki has to kill miku and goes berserk
Lol
Have him piss on the moon
It's easier to hack into a computer
Genjuro runs
Genjuro wins easy
Shame
"this is the power of the fist that loves or something"
Shemha "Bakana!"
And then everyone who's dead and alive is behind them in spirit form and they start screaming
For a final noost
Are they gonna pull a "enki took over Maria's body"
Oh wait
Shemha is lesbian
Also are you saying that lesbians aren't normal?
You are now cancelled
Isn't from a long line of magic demo. Killers or a host for fine or capable of hosting holy power
By normal I mean
Oh yeah miku
Is Chris the only normal person?
X drive more like Hibiki X miku
#ShemHaIsOverParty
>basa is probably into hair pulling, that's why she has a ponytail
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
And the hands
👀
She could take over the arms
Oh
"yet"
That's kinda gay
I mean she shares her body with elfnein
Yeah?
Inb4 fine and saint germain come back as a spirit cameo
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
Like I said

Who are kirika fans except lolicons
Oh
A fan made what
Kirikia is a bottom?
Shame-ha
What'd you expect
It's lesbians fighting magic monsters
It's symphogear
Also that's not what à "trap" is
Did maria have a black cock?
Maria got
Also why don't you say ass
"wait does she have a dick? I havent checked"
Why
Diki
You know that right?
You can say Ass
"Did I do that?"
Shemha sees those Miku bondage pics and gets distracted
It's really fucked up coochie
Explain
Please explain
What's the Orca
So, Ver?
So shem-ha?
Forgot
What's blue waffle again?
Bluebird ?
Yeah
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
No swords
There's only sheaths
I hope biki fuckin lubed it to hell and back
Too much chafing
What's a god to me
Ho
Obviously it was shrinked
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Maria using dragon hand to fuck basa
Zababababababbababbabbababa
Oh Maria is an angel
Why not
They look like the espadas from bleach brave souls
Them
Where's the rest of tje
I meant half way not full-on
Yo uh can I get the screens
Not the material
Super Saiyan changes the shape and color
No
Where hair/clothing becomes fire
I swear I've seen that kind of transformation before
Again?
Like,
Why do I gotta fight my friends
Come on
What evil did Adam do apart from vaporising the FIS
Biki, Free
Basa with black hair
Zoophilia is entry level hentai
Maple syrup easy
The Orca ain't shit
Bruh
Explain
What's about the Orca
Milaarc is real evil but really hot
She's the brain
Elsa also planned the killings
By far
Milaarc did the most work
Incredible
There's good people in the middle of all the bad people?
From carrying noble Red so hard
I think Milaarc's back is broken
Dude beats out a non amalgam gear barehanded
That he'd think that his family is garbage
With how strong fudou is
I mean it makes sense
People who support fudou are dumb
>>you mean unlike what I've been doing for the last 4 seasons?
>you cant save everything with singing
Is symphogear a mecha anime?
She even got to ass slap basa and Maria
Cause she's damn hot and strong
Shame Milaarc is a villain
Episode 13 hit all of the checkmark
Also she has god killer
She had feeling of everyone in the world
"we beat god for the 3rd time can you accept us?"
"no and ill kill your dad"
"singing can't solve everything"
"We literally beat God"
"I wanna defend the nation"
He doesn't deserve any more attention
They hit us with the flashback
Also I feel like they wrapped it up too fast
With brand new weapon armor
It missed ultimate final mega hit attack
Except à final mecha transformation
What I couldn't predict is tsubasa sword hair
I also predicted the flashback Ghosts
And that they'd do a Swan song
I knew 100 billion % she shou miku would be back
Do I need to wait for the discs to come out?
Where's the music
Wait
Why
Roll credits
And then they fuck
But why
Yeah
Why is miku a doctor
How
?????????
Nnn
Punch people?
What does biki do
Becomes a teacher or something
Chris goes to school
She has her own harem
To shoot with a bigger gun
Also Chris just summons a bigger Chris
Obviously it's Chris, she just makes a smaller Chris
They're babies they can't have babies
Why is there a geass symbol
Dess
Any blanket statement is wrong
Yehh
It was banned on the discord
Also is that true that most of the LGBTQ+ community considers it a slur?
Dumb fuck idiot lobbist dumbass headass straight into the void
Why do you need an assault rifle

Golbin slayer is jssr an average d&d season

Makes sense

Isekai wise
Hm
So this season we got either bad adaptations or had source material
Can't read my bad
Oh
For Zero no tsukaima
Also writer is  dead
Like Holy fuck
How does isekai cheat magician manage to be more basic ass barebones than kenja no mago
Didn't watch
Who either gets obliterated or lives
Oh and that one really punchable character
They're in a buncha isekais
Nope
-racism
-slavery
-corruption
Isekai starter pack
-Magic
-big titty girl with one personality trait 
-loli 
-normal girl but who's actually best girl
-buff dude 
-small dude 
-evil criminals
Generic main characters ASSEMBLE
"god I wish that were me"
Says the Japanese customer
High-school of the dead
To love ru
Remember makenki
Hh
Was slime the latest good adaptation
Unlike like, fairy tail, one percé and stuff
With the intention of watching anime
Tbh this was one of the first anime I've seen
Fair enough
Ngnl is *colorful*
Oof
Got me sold
Is it that good?
Yeah
Ooh
Is this an anime from this season?
Wait
Name a char from it
Mondaiji?
So mom isekai isn't isekai?
I took too much of this for granted
Grandpa is nice
The main character has one perslnal struggled
It isnt à harem somehow
It's a starter isekai
All the isekai are either edgy af or basic af
Arifureta was apparently butchered
At least kenja no mago had some cool animation sometimes
Diablo, Bell, Arifureta dude and Kenkaneki ré just same charachter
I like kazami yuuji from horny : the anime
Same
Midget pig boy becomes speed good
It's just flatlands
But accel world's world is pretty boring
Oh yeha
-character goes berserk
Or
-that one rapey dude
I forgot
Oh
I didn't watch sao
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Code Lyoko is an isekai
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
He fucked up the genre
70% isekai
It's like
It's the father of isekai
That's why I watched it
Yeah
Couldn't give half of a dick about JSDF
I just wanna see guns mow down
Pff
Makes sense with how professional it looked
I see
Oooph
It's Catharsis
Gun vs medieval
I liked it
Only thing specifically Japanese is their names
"nationalistic"
Most countries have the same army

Gundam is just robot fight
To kill god and satan
For example, dude was shunned by heaven and hell so he gathers teams of angels demons spirits and shit
Like give me **new** stuff
Oh and don't forget the "half humans" bring treated by slaves, those groups of dudes that attack one girl so the main character can save them?
90% of the time it's always demons are evil, spirits are good, Kings are corrupt
We need *new* fantasy
I hope
Preferably not slice of life
Recommend me some anime with good protag's
I forgot how fun hours kazuma's va talking was
But if mha had an entertaining main character
Bruh kny is basically MHA's better cousin
Isekai have always two approaches
Tiny group of people that destroy tons of  mobs
Or huge army at the boot of the tiny group
There's so much flexibility
Fuckin
He's a saint
The man is so god damn
