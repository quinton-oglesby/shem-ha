:TsubasaLetsDestroyAPadoru:
Can we rename <:Bike:690470896892379136>  to :ABike: ? I think it'd work better with <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592> that way.
He was looking for a *suggestion" on how to fill up his xp *box*. Makes perfect sense to post it here
0.5ms frame time
Needs to go faster
I'd assume no role means "I'm fine with whatever".
What would be the advantage of splitting them?
Raids like that are just annoying imo. You make more enemies than friends unless everyone's in on the joke already.
I don't really get why you'd want a no-images nsfw channel in this server tbh. Surely there's whole servers for the explicit purpose of being horny with other horny folks. At least the current nsfw channel has the reason d'etre of Geah lewds existing.
The ovas
I'm sure you'll find something good! Tbf I think there's a fair few emotes already on this server that it's hard to make out what they are. <a:KanadeSingA:625031533966917663> is pretty hard for me to see, for example.
You can't really see her face at all imo, it'd be worse inline. <:Garie:730169570538684480>
<:Garie:730169570538684480>
I think it'd be really hard to see that she's angry on an emote scale. She'd look like <:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149> more than anything, i'd suspect
The miku would be a good birthday emote if she wasn't hiding behind everyone else
:kanasmalldick: <:mischieve:586208451630202936>
I think you meant
> I shall not let <:Bike:690470896892379136> be destroyed <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Rady.
I prefer the second of those two meme god, it's more zoomed in the face so it's clearer
I think if we're culling marias, the <:MariaBully:689614085452464318> might be a good candidate. I think most people use elfnein instead.
Padoru is always used to be obnoxious. It's fun. Of those three bikkimunches, the second is the worst for me. I can barely see her mouth/that she's got anything in it.
On one hand I agree rady, on the other, ftp people should be allowed to be obnoxious too
It's always padorutime <a:padoru:393562720273956866> <:PadoruHibiki:516438720082346004><a:PadoruRainbow:692482944765526016><:padogeru:662514938513719306><a:padoru:393562720273956866><a:defaultpadoru:652715215112241182><:mealiepadoru:662861521491066890><a:mealiepadoruspin:626980979893993493><a:setsuna_padoru:657355274667032577><a:Hilda_padoru:657355316215808032>
animated padorus are best anyway
Serena munch is at least a different kind of munch to the others. it's more of a nibble/hamster thing.
Is she the haram master though?
I like them both too, but they're basically the same emote.
<:KanadeWink:690470895608791040> and <:KanadeLewd:690470896174891008> are basically the same emote so you could probably get rid of one if you wanted to.
If you get rid of it, I'm stealing it and using it illegally <:blobthief:723278019157819503>
No! Delete is the single best emote on this server, besides *maybe* <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
The future is now! <a:MikuHyperDelete:729379613180166184>
I cannot make out what that is at all. It's a vagely orange shape with black dots.
Of those two i prefer the screech over the aa. On the other hand...
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534> <a:borgar:638930287568355351>
Or when someone challenges you to a fight
it's a good emote, but too niche <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
If we have to get rid of a miku, i think the one i like least is <:MikuHype:688429715676987428> , but i'd use it if i wasn't a whale with access to the superior <a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
<:ChrisEmbarrassed:663558614610608128>  is good for when people say nice things about you. I don't think there's anything else that really fits that purpose quite as well.
<:ChrisRead:688429724334161987> looks more like :chrisgameboy: to me, but that's all I can really say about them
All of those are good and unique though
<:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326> I think it's pretty unclear that she's drooling. It just looks vaguely happy to me, and there's three more vaguely happy shirabes
Is this Polish?
make another private server
It's fun culling emotes when you know you can just save anything you like from the chopping block and use it yourself <:fufufu:586742813828317184>
:mikulocated: because it looks like she's found something she's excited about
Middle is probably best imo, by the time you get it down to react size.
Okay, this is going to come off as massively dickish, but w/e. I think a vent channel would probably encourage more venting than there currently is, and whilst most of the people who talk here regularly are friends, is a public anime server really the best place for that?
an emote would get spammed in all kinds of situations. It'd end up meaningless very quickly
They might have lowered it when they last messed with nitro priviliges.
I could have sworn it was 50 at one point. Did they lower the requirement or am I going insane?
I thought the server had max boosts, and I thought max was 50?
if we're only at 30 now does that mean 20 boosts have gone walkabouts? I guess that could be something to do with XDU dying but still <:sweatgondola:439946868554727433>.
Sidebar might be empty though. Idk, never tested that.
It will look like a bunch of black bars saying "click to show message"
More like from September 1st to May 30th
You can't block me! <:Ver:704169051391524875> I have the thing!
All emotes need a purpose, they're like Pokémon, you can't leave them suffering on a hard drive forever!
Same purpose as any other <:wao:586185672159789066> emote probably, rady.
Cancel the emote then. It has already reached its peak purpose. 😔. It has found nirvana
I dunno how it works out on PC, but that is one well-placed emote on Android.
That one white pixel in maria's hair, directly up from the right side of the heart, is really distracting once you see it. (Not that you should see it at emote size)
Wouldn't that just be a Miku takeover? I sense some colour bias going on <:yotsusba:735678570910711833>
In small form I think it's really hard to see how it's different from <:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
I know rady already put it as a command, but could we maybe get that timeline thingy pinned in either <#336310266654490624> or <#357682999300718592> ? I think it's a really useful resource for prompts (and i guess fanfiction in general)
Well, one didn't, but it was shit in other ways too
All the dorms i have been in have had ovens, so it's not an unreasonable assumption, Phanta.
Always get a dorm with an oven. Those microwave/oven combo things are shit
Also, that's a good Miku, lank
Who puts pizza in the microwave? Cold pizza is better than reheated pizza
It's the chomping emotion
Rename it to :chrischomp:
Even if these don't make good emotes themselves, I like the idea of spanish subs on an emote.
I like the one he already did better tbh. Looks like she's headbutting the hand
Why not into Fanta?
I guess like the carol Vs 9 event on their birthday maybe?
Matt why would you give your life to pass the fish into the exclusive hands of the rich?
You can't kill the fish, it'll merely go underground. By which i mean people will add it to their personal emote servers
I think people would get confused about which side is "heads". It might make more sense if this side is heads and the other is tails?
People shouldn't be spamming coin flip anyway I don't think, and that's what people don't like about the fish, isn't it?
That clearly is an emote. It does the pop up thing when you click on it and everything.
<:TsubasaDere:768545990495961129>
The og emote just sorta looks like a moomin with hair to me
What is <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> supposed to be besides scared/nervous?
Just throwing it out there, but might anyone else be interested in having a bot like chuu-bot in the music channel? Basically Chuu allows you to compare your musical tastes with other server members and also produce pretty graphs, based off Last.fm, and that's fun. It is possible to 'scrobble' from Youtube (as well as lots of other sources), and Last FM does recognise a decent amount of geah songs.
https://github.com/ishwi/discordBot

I don't really know what it takes to integrate a bot like this into a server, and we'd probably have to have quite a lot of people buying into this for it to be really good, but I figure it couldn't hurt to ask.
(His Secret Hideout is ||under the table||)
26 remaining is more than half
Problem solved then let's just hijack phanta's server <:mischieve:586208451630202936>
Another server I'm on does something like that, it works pretty well but the problem is *which* emotes go to the backup emote server/emote graveyard and, once they're there, can they come back to the main server?
Plus, you know, getting rid of Miku for a lost-song themed thing seems apt
Maybe one of <:MikuPanic:640289659452129310> / <:MikuCry:688397678584791074> ? They are similar emotions
imagine not living the 7 til half three life.

It exists anyway cocoa, gotta learn to live with it
<#377148557796442134> exists.
Isn't there a hololive discord or anything?
When has that channel ever been clogged?
At that point why not just set up a group DM?
No, not really. I just think it'd be funny.
Can we add a joke rule about "no mentioning she-who-must-not-be-named"? Every time she is mentioned it brings up a long discussion about whether she is good or bad. I know I am guilty of taking part in  those discussions, but really we do not need to retread 2yr old ground in a discord that has nothing to do with Fire Emblem.
3 episodes a week would be good for the first week, we get [spoiler] coming in right at the end for a cliffhanger
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Stalin was hot when he was younger. Is he morally grey too? Saddam Hussein also not that bad. The Spanish foreign legion too!
It is an argument that just goes around in circles with nobody ever changing their minds though.
You can never fully escape the Padoru, you can only loosen its grip.
Yeah I meant the prompt that gets released on whichever character's day
Would it just be birthday writing prompts in a thread or all of them? I think the channel would be pretty dead if every prompt went in a thread but swapping between thread and no thread would confuse people
Maybe shorten it a bit for still images? Not to say that those are somehow worth less than fanfics or animations, but they're probably the bulk of the time sensitive content and tend to generate slightly less discussion. I guess it wouldn't hurt to say 30minutes rather than an hour than the other stuff too, if it helps.
I think unless you restricted who can nominate a post you'd end up with a load of crap from hiero on the starboard, but if that's what people want <:akarishrug:772307493677432842>
Another server I'm on didn't have that kind of thing for years, then when they added it it just filled up with crap and after about a day nobody looked at the channel unless they were trying to game the system to get their own post in. Let the past die (kill it, if you must!)
There is exactly one person who reads the self promo channel and their other hobby is watching cable TV just for the adverts.
Just put that in your bio?
I am not sure where this new page on [another server] came from, but are there any plans to move the pronouns (and maybe the other roles?) to this "customise community" thing?

This is going beyond 3rd wheeling. This is becoming a vicar.
I'm not the most clued in person ever, but i don't think that's shirabe
Hibiki and Miku don't even need to be that far apart, they're just doing it for fun.
Chris be like "her sweater's in my mouth but I can't say anything because that'll just make it worse."
If they'd sat together Maria wouldn't have to have been out in the cold...
Also pretty sure boobs don't stick up in the air like that.
Kanade acts like an old man in locker rooms lol.

Is it in your tsubasa folder?
Tsubasa on the right is just like "do you expect me to be impressed?"
It's a collective delusion. You both have Alzheimer's.
Because they refuse to conform to your preconceived notions of normal.

And the fact that she's so divisive is what makes her a good character. She not only split a continent in two she split the internet in 2 too <:EdelLurk:545269012276183040>
Probably should take this to gaming chat
I don't like her (yes, I have played crimson flower). I don't take issue with her as a character (I think she's decently written at least), but I just can't support her revolution as I can't see it meaningfully improving Fodlan and I dislike her as a person (as a character?)

maybe the head shape as well?
it's the eyes and the round shading on the nose that's making me see it,  I think
That last one's good but she's got Sonic the Hedgehog's face.

I guess there's too many swords already, you're right.
Can't believe they gave Britain a lance rather than Excalibur.
Wait, Tsubasa doesn't have a nose either, that's a shadow of her hair. Does "Ame no the sword one" have the same effect? <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>

Bikki and Maria don't have noses. Is this what Gungir does to you?
Wtf is going on with Maria's glasses though?
You are being informed because you're a tsubasa fan so you might appreciate this picture of tsubasa in disguise
Some of them are good, like the low budget cosplay guy's one
It's not just his body, it's the shape of his head too, i think. Admittedly, he's a proper twink in the show, so it could just be a style thing.
Is the dude on the left in that Ogawa? He looks like he has a dadbod in it.
Going back to that Kanade for a sec, if she's an angel and she's half of zwei wing (aka she's one wing), does that mean she's a one-winged angel? Kanade = Sephiroth confirmed?

Komi does develop a bit, just extremely slowly. The problem is that the best character is the MMC but he's not in it nearly as much anymore.
There's also the descriptive character names gag which the author has kept going. I still like Komi but it's only like mid-tier for me right now.
It wasn't nearly as popular as the manga though, you have to admit.
Also, absolutely nobody gave a shit about seryuu girl anime so I can't see komi doing much better.
It could maybe be okay as the 3 minute shorts type of anime? I think Komi benefits from short chapters, I don't think 3-4 chapters an episode would turn out well.
Yeah, what would we do without Bumblebee the transformer?
That's not a nintendo powerglove...
If life were a shonen anime the hamster would undergo carcinogenation at a crucial moment for a crutch victory over the crab.

Anpan flavour milk?
All the better to slay noise with.
Leon's a chump. Dude's using worst kanto starter in current year.
Rather than a gekota plushie though, what about the giant gekota suits from  best toaru manga (idol accelerator)?
Oh damn, i didn't even seen that you drew it yourself. That's super cool!

Imagine tripping over that headphone cord though.
<@247701824335904770> shemmy posted Maria like 1 million up.
Maybe I'm just slightly colourblind then. Either way, there's a missed opportunity there! <:listenhere:581760660770258944>
The headphones are orangey, but the cord is like "burned orange"/red
That cord is not yellow.
Looks red to me
/nitpick
Miku's headphone cord should be red in that last pic too. It's almost-but-not-quite "red string of fate".
<:HibikiPing:688397678421344268>
I don't know what that background is but now I want to see shemha with a duel disk.
Whomst?
Not a fan of the hat. It makes her look like a lamppost to me.
Also 3 literally whos.
Oh hey it's Sherlock Holmes and the IKEA shark.

Wait it's wagen not wangen I can't read
To me it looks like a compound word of "crank" and "Wang". One of those indicates manual operation of something, the other is slang for penis.
Krankenwangen doesn't mean what I think it means, does it?
seems a little bit of an ott reaction to a picture of people hanging out, shemha.
No it's au tsubasa
no gwendy, not good. Don't you know how much of a rip-off the funeral industry is?
How come you can inspect element on reacts, but not on people's profile pics? That'd have been an easy way to get it. Discord bad <:angery:230967607862362112>

Not knowing what that thing in her hand is, i can only imagine her with that super-serious face saying ||"And THIS is where I stick this".|| (Spoilered for implied horny)
Pretty sure it's from a doujin on dynastyscans. I'm also like 80% sure it was porn.
The bloodshot eyes on the right remind me of the cursed yui with real eyes
all these pictures of hibiki and miku are leaving a somewhat bitter taste rn.

Ur not symphogear but ur nice :)
Do you recon edgebikki's a Mace Windu fan with her new purple lightsaber?
Yeah but passable at high school level is not enough to communicate that you just accidentally dimension hopped through someone's child's computer screen.

Why bring them into the real world when you could instead go back into the fake world?
Not enough green though. And the headpiece is worse than doomslayer's helmet.
You know what we need right now? Doomslayer Bikki. Rip and Tear until it is done!
Bikki needs the height on her new gigs so she can tower over the murderer as she crushes them into dust.
It's missing the panel where the far person is really into something that the others are not.
She's going to do that "save your life" thing where you push someone and then pull them back. That's pretty mean
Yep. That's the thing all right.
See, that's a smile that's threatening to kill you.
idk, maybe i'm just bad at reading faces, but the smile looks more sad or pensive than angry to me.
Hey, the fact that she's smiling in this pic (and it's not an "i am going to dismember you and feed you your own dick" smile) means the event has a ||happy-ish ending||, right?
bottom left there is WORST, i'm pretty sure. That's significantly less cursed.
No, it's just cursed.
Cursed Railgun/Accel in the bottom right, lol. Wait, in the bottom left is that?
Inferior yellow, or whatever she's called.

Then it's no longer a knife, it's a drill bit!
She finally finds inner peace in another universe, adopts a Miku who either doesn't have parents or who doesn't have a Hibiki, then that gets taken away from her too.
Leaked screenshot of a flashback in the next edgebikki event just before she suffers even more.
I vote for not cursed
It's a him, Mario.
wait, really?
Where did those two extra gigas come from?
Maybe i'm projecting here, but i think it's kinda cool how lonely they made Miku look in that without actually putting anything else in the picture. <:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>

because the word for a group of them is funny. Then again, the idea of a parliament of bikkis is also kinda funny
a group of crows is called a murder of crows ikxi. the sentence makes perfect sense 😤
Let's go with a "murder", not because Bikki is like a crow, but because it's funny.
This is getting out of hand! Now there are three of them!

Edgebikki is definitely really awkward/bad at rap.

no. she really likes that hoodie and doesn't like that mainverse bikki nicked it.
Hey it's Sucy from LWA but she dyed her hair.
No in this particular case I would strongly object to it being real
(little red riding hood) ||how can Hibiki be red riding hood and st. germain the hunter when it's the hunter that kills the wolf (in some versions)?||
Could they not have put the signature either on the shirt or on her skin? Why does it have to cross both?

Wait, hang on, is she just standing there in a thong? Wrong channel?
Daggers are kinda like bows in some worlds I guess...
That's supposed to be a pic of  golden sonic
I'm not sure how I feel about the headphone decoration. It does look kinda cool, but on the other hand...
Tbh I prefer the 2019 version. The red blur makes it look like it could be a possessed Hibiki, but the 2020 version looks more like someone else cosplaying Hibiki (and shooting lasers from her fingers?)
Now where's the pic where they're both guys?

No, I cannot, UH. it was gore and I blocked the guy.

Is that Xerneas on Lugia's chest? If so, is Yveltal in Ho-oH's design?
There's a VN where Bikki steals the Infinite Stratos Harem.
Literally it means "unusual", UH. People used it as a euphemism for "homosexual" in the latter half of the 20th Century and then LGBT+ people reclaimed it somewhat.
Never heard queer used to refer to stupid people before. Specifically I think the stereotype was about gay women but I am not 100% sure on that.
There's an old stereotype that queer people wear flannel (and inversely that people who wear flannel must be queer).
I wonder if they went for the stereotype on purpose or if the artist just really wanted to draw flannel?

Hibiki can't risk her life to save the world if she's sushi instead
The word you're looking for is narcissism
She can't drink because she's an idol now and if she got shitfaced it'd ruin her image or something.
None of the gears can drink

I'd say so
Vampiress Lord didn't really have anything but fluff in it, though it's also axed. Also it was pretty horny, idk if that's something which would class it as not-sweet to you
It has a ||bitter ending|| is all I will say. Any more would be spoilers that would ruin the story.
I do think that everyone who thinks they're a fan of yuri should read "My Joy" though. It builds character.
Though unironically I didn't hate "My Joy". I read them both like 3 years ago when I was in a yuri manga phase.
Yes
http://mangabat.best/manga/her-pet By the same author, i like this one slightly more because it's not the same flavour of "interesting"

Ryuko/Satsuki is kinda uncomfortable, even by incest standards, imo. Satsuki probably has little to no idea how to express affection normally because of the way Ragyo treated her.

She threw it away to put on Junketsu, I don't think she'd let it stop her if she didn't want it to. She's Satsuki Kiryuin after all!

So what would be the problem with, for example, incentivising members of minority groups (especially working class ones) to join the police Rakhi? You don't go against your own.
Without a legal system I'm sure all "justice" would be vigilante in nature, which is unlikely to be proportionate to the crime committed. I also think most Marxist explanations of criminal behaviour struggle to explain non-economic crime, like sexual assault for example.
Would you mind giving it for us who jumped in halfway through the conversation then, aria?
Anything is salvageable. It's just whether or not people judge it worth the effort.
No I didn't. I was putting forward a not-abolishing-the-police-force *solution" for abuse of authority against minorities to see if you have any arguments as to why it wouldn't work

Dang, there's some nasty questions in this 9axes quiz. "Leaders should be strong or a country will suffer". What does 'strong'mean?
Like the black raiden guy's above you
Apparently. "Normally" most of the bars are  at 75-90% in my experience.
That's the most moderate reading i've ever seen on.ome of these tests shocker. What are you, a centrist? <:gasp:613577463938940959>
8 axes is probably "the best" in my opinion, but it still shouldn't be taken as anything but a fun number to compare with your friends in a casual setting.
Really not a fan of politiscales tbh. It's more for Marxists jerking off how revolutionary they are than anything else imo.
Yes, but even the tests with many multiples of axis are kind of crap without multiple readings
But seriously, all these political tests are designed to tell you that you're a socially liberal socialist because that's the predetermined"good" result.
You have to actually try to not be in bottom left somewhere.
Bottom left is boring, that's where everyone is 😔
You lucky soul <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Yeah but that's like saying *A sister's all you need* was alright after the first two minutes
Get the CIA to stage a coup in their country and install a neolib puppet government ~~oh wait~~
A guillotine is such an individualized punishment anyway, they need to share the burden of their crimes. Tie the rich together and force-march them through the mojave

And dodgy videos of concerts from before you were born, of course.
This is why you should preserve your innocence and only watch Minecraft LPs
It was pretty surreal, but I guess armchair generals are capable of using mics too.
That career-ruining career reminds me of one time I went properly down the rabbit hole. I ended up watching a video entitled something like "The History of Breadtube" and it was just some guy ranting for 30 minutes about how YouTube used to be massively right wing until he did a masterplan of cancelling the ideologically impure and now everything is sunshine and rainbows and ready for a revolution.
Like <:CoolNoiseDontLookAtExplosions:673239311876882462> ?
Oh dear <:yikes:462121713002348565>.
Literally who? I don't know so much about this "breadtube" group or whatever they're called
Folks he shouldn't? I presume you mean contrapoints because I only know he's friends with her and the philosophy tube guy.
Yeah I saw that. I liked his "soyboy" video
The flat earther dude dying was just sad because now the nutters will claim the FBI shot him down to prevent him proving the truth.
You're not going to mention poop girl?
He sees pretty legitimate in his beliefs to me, considering he joined a far-right party and ran to be an MP
The Brit who named himself after some persian king?
You mean Sargon of Akkad?
They all are. It's one of the reasons they're fun
Hmm. How does this yelling at feminists thing go then?

 "DEAR LIBERALS, IF COMMUNISM DOESN'T KILL PEOPLE, THEN WHY DO YOU ALL DYE (DIE) YOUR HAIR RED? LIKE BLOOD!"

Something like that? I know that block caps are the important bit but I don't know just how meaningless to make the statement.
Maybe I should give that a try. For all I know it could be even more fun than these virtual dick measuring contests.
<:OhISee:586742815124357130>
I don't think I've ever seen a right-wing skewed political test come to think of it. What do enlightened centrists and republicans do for fun?
It is funny though. In fact, I dare say that bad "political tests" are more entertaining than good ones.
Yes it is. Mandatory political testing and chopping off 5% from either side every 10 years
I won't really go into it any further because I realised it's a bit insensitive for me to talk about this shit from outside the culture, but I do think that most people can be convinced to enjoy their gun-based hobbies in a safer and more responsibile way. I'd hope that has some kind of knock on effect on gun deaths/suicide rates. Maybe I'm just naive though.
Actually I should just shut up.
I think that the kind of message I'm thinking of for this campaign has to be seen to be coming from "the people", specifically gun owners, rather than politicians or "city elites". I'm actually thinking of a specific campaign that's already a thing tbh. I'll see if I can find the article but it's been a while.
Maybe what i suggested would be an ineffective scratch on the surface of gun deaths but i think it's something that could be done in the current political climate over there right now, maybe even in some of the more conservative states. Idk, there's obviously no easy solution.
Maybe, but try telling the NRA that, solo.
As I understand it suicide is typically a very in-the-moment decision and those extra seconds or minutes it might take to unlock a locker might be enough for the suicidal person to hesitate and have a re-think Saki. I'm not an expert on this topic so take this with a massive heap of salt, but I think guns are the most common cause of suicide because there's less time to talk yourself out it, unlike driving to a bridge or buying a rope or whatever.
What I'd suggest as a thing that the U.S could nominally do *right now* is run some kind of anti-suicide campaign, preferably with grassroots  elements. Combine this with subsidies on gun lockers so that they're affordable for everyone and I think you'd see a tangible drop in gun deaths. You won't be able to convince people to give up guns, but you might be able to convince them that guns aren't for kids
I think that even if you're nominally okay with the increased risk of authoritarianism, most of the people we'd need to convince of this are not Melua. Not to mention that i imagine that for many of them their gun is a big part of their identity and so they'll view tracking it as an unacceptable violation of privacy.
Not an American here, so perhaps I should keep my trap shut but I like the idea of the Swiss system where ammo is kept locked down at ranges or wherever but you can still own the gun.

Very much not a fan of armed revolution against the bougies, I think it'd end up with another authoritarian, trigger-happy, lot in charge again like the Bolsheviks in the Russian Revolution.
You throw vegetables at people who throw bacon at mosques. They'd probably be terrified at the sight of a salad
Not to mention a license-based thing is just straight up unenforcable.
Even if not straight-up eugenics, it sounds like a bat for politicians to hit "inconveniences" with. Are you *sure* you hate this pipeline more than you want children?

Is there any chance of the crown prince being more moderate than his dad? I seem to remember the sultan made shit worse a few years back, so is there hope of his son reversing that?
It is ignorance, it's just that ignorance is backed by the law in some places unfortunately

If homophobia's as taboo [where he lives] as he describes then that might not be the best idea, unfortunately.
Britain fucking up by drawing arbitrary lines on a map? Say it isn't so!
The Hindu/Muslim conflict in India is quite a bit older than that though, isn't it?
Election, pre-election. Same thign
Maybe, idk. There's too many people in your damn election. How are we supposed to keep track of them?
I guess not then. I could have sworn there was a dude that started throwing money everywhere before ...uh... the NYC guy
no, klobbs
Is he the guy who's trying to run a campaign on money alone?
How is Klobbs going to be outlasting Buttigeg in this? Literally who even are they?
Biden's like the last person you'd want gaining things, i'd think
Doesn't that mean all of his voters are going to go to Biden though?
They already do parenting classes of a kind over here in high school, as an optional class. I think it was called health and social care or something and it dealt with looking after young kids and old people. ~~It was known as the teenage mum class though so 🤷~~
Don't apologise, it's better to test ideas against other people and other ideas rather than just assume they're good.
Multiplication is forbidden now Lonk. you haven't got a parenting license after all.
I should clarify that  ^ was me *making fun* of accelerationists. I am not one myself
but what if we made it *more* dystopic until it suddenly magically wasn't a dystopia anymore?
That may be true lonk, but who is and who is not fit to be a parent is not something anyone has a right to decide
I hear that Poland has toll roads everywhere. Is this true or is it just an exaggeration?
So what's the rules of this duel then? Do they throw ballot boxes at each other until one falls over?
A duel with revolvers or with yugioh cards?
Please tell me the absolute boomers who are making the countryside "LGBT free zones" aren't winning.

I'd be curious as to how the Johnson government stacks up against the dems. They're weird, definitely Tory <:kimoi:255588712967176208> , but weird.

I really want that guy to catch coronavirus now, just for the irony
The tweet got deleted so it's probably safest to give it a solid "maybe"
Unfortunate that it isn't going to be able to be used widely but it's still good news for those that have that kind of cancer and HIV to boot.
I'm going to throw a big <:doubt:308730924445728778> at that. Brexit is status quo at this point, so I don't think you'd actually get enough votes for a retraction of it.
I don't suppose you have a stat for  40-65yr olds, do you Melua?
"alright boys, 3/5ths of us are infected now, the rest of you can go home"
It's not like the guys proposing purposefully infecting people with it, they're just acknowledging that the virus is likely to spread quickly
Most large gatherings across the country have already been shut down, almost every workplace is making plans for staff to work from home and most carehomes aren't allowing visitors. What else would you do?
What would you propose then? Shut the whole country in airtight boxes forevermore?
And they're also typically much less mobile and so less likely to be found in busy areas
Mortality is like 0.2% in healthy adults.

I am very surprised they're banning church services.

Yeah but you're not relying on rational arguments to sway policymakers away. You're relying on money.
The banks etc know that too, and they will lobby HARD against it.
You can't block/backdoor VPNs because that'd screw over all the banks and big businesses that use them
Even if some kind of mass-surveilance thing was 1. Passed and 2. Successfully developed (and those are 2 big ifs), I reckon people will figure out how it works pretty quickly and swamp/overload it to make it non-functional.
People probably conflate furries and otherkin too (I know I have in the past) and give them shit for that.
I'm guessing the people currently in government have a good change of winning right now because they're pretty authoritarian and people are wanting harsh quarantine measures?

We can always dig ourselves a deeper hole ⛏️
Tl;dr: no
Long answer: also no. Boris (so far) has been kinda moderate for a Tory. Still a scumbag, mind, but not the literal worst. This article speculates it might be Dominic Raab who replaces him, and that'd likely be a step down from Boris https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-who-is-dominic-raab-replace-boris-johnson-prime-minister-2020-3
Yeah but a moderate boring stance like that doesn't get clicks.
California'll be feeling the burn alright in a month or two. Social distancing'll be hard if you're in a communal shelter.
Political ideology isn't really applicable to people, except in like the broadest of senses. A good way though might be to honestly discuss your opinions on the internet and see what word people use when they respond to you angrily.
You just did though.
You should phone in and point out that radiators irradiate too, so everyone should turn off their central heating if they don't want to catch coronavirus

Dear LIBERALS, if the right weren't using facts and logic properly, then why is it Ben Shapiro's catchphrase?
Trump's got to sign it first before you can get it
No you need to slide to the left, not the right! Then you gotta take it back now y'all.
Idk about "significantly" less. In the UK our biggest left wing party just went through something of a civil war and there was definitely quite a bit of "centre-left might as well be a Tory (the largest right-wing party)" going around. (Shit was definitely being thrown both ways, but the 'centrists' shit is less relevant here, I think)
Can't wait for someone to nick a post truck with everyone's votes in it.
Why your your postal service be the ones to organise elections anyway? Does Postman Pat count the ballots or something?
I think it's more that they're angry at the world, but no matter who they rage against things don't get better so they're swayed when a recruiter says "no, join us and we'll fix shit for real"

A million people disliking your video is a tragedy. Just one is a statistic.
I guess i'd say people are amazing, everyone has things they are knowledge and passionate about, I think that's pretty cool. People can definitely be cowardly and cruel, but we know this and we're trying to be better than that.
It's kinda impossible for me to wrap my head around the idea of "all of humanity" to form an opinion on it.
I mean, there *are* plenty of wehraboos and armchair generals out on the internet. Just don't go into their spaces, let them be.
Okay it looks like what I was referring to was a study from 2015 which showed that 48% of people in the UK supported the death penalty for anything (which, at the time, was the lowest it ever had been). Still too high imo.
Okay, I'm getting stonewalled trying to find the article now, i'll have to try digging it out of scihub when I get home
Unspecified
On the other hand like 47% of the country wants the death penalty back <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>. You can't win, can you?
This policy seems very "Mumsnet"-ey. Hopefully Mumsnet shuts down due to covid and takes this with it.

We're saying *he*, but is this actually a policy that's come from Trump? I'd be surprised if he knows that trans people exist. Not that  it changes anything.
I meant if the post service attempts to make all those deliveries and fails to do so in time. Would the results be declared invalid or would some people be screwed over through no fault of their own?
What happens if they are unable to do that?

What do you think they're going to say/do? "Ah ha! You applied for a visa to work in this country as a skilled worker but, on top of your job, we've found you visiting the fjords on a weekend! Deported!"
I think that varies by country Solo. Afaik to move to the UK, for example, you "just" have to prove you can support yourself. Assuming you have a cash reserve and a job offer. immigration shouldn't care whether you came here for this job or if you came here because you really wanted to eat Cornish pasties every day.
I don't think economic migration is the only reason for swapping countries. It's definitely a massive change but if you're willing to go through with it for whatever reason, then that reason is good enough.

You can and should overthink something else as well as your work. Be that a mystery novel or learning a language or whatever, nobody can keep focus on one thing perfectly for long periods of time.
I daren't re-watch some of the shows I liked back in uni. God knows how many times I watched Dragon Maid, for example, and I don't want to ruin that by re-watching it and thinking it's shit.
Also, anecdotally, I would not have made it through last year of uni without destressing on S-O-L anime.
Literally every study I've ever heard of says the exact opposite about fun stuff. Google et all don't have these crazy offices with pool tables and whatnot because they're nice, it's because unstressed employees that are having fun work more productively.

Probably not, though showering every day might be good unless you have particularly sensitive skin/hair. Almost certainly every other day though.
Get better at something. If you're good at something, or at least better than average, you'll feel more confident about doing that thing and the confidence sorta naturally bleeds into confidence in other things too.
Being "childish" isn't even all bad. I'm sure plenty of people would say things like drinking alcohol-free cocktails and watching cartoons is childish. 

Jokes on them though, the drinks are tasty and there's plenty of cool people to meet in communities like this. By "not being childish" they're the ones missing out <:blobcatdab:589275712448364545>

Report them to the admins instead. If you get no response, talk to a journalist, Reddit has proven susceptible to changing its mind when the mainstream media get involved.
What content would actually be offensive without being morally reprehensible? Unless you're suggesting spamming giant green squares or something?
Why would that be a problem? "arsehole" isn't a protected group.
What is AHS? Is it like "Shit Reddit Says"?
Either way I think it's definitely right for Reddit (the company) to shut down hate speech. Allowing it on their platform is (indirectly) condoning that speech and giving those who use it a platform with which they can spread the rest of their vile ideology. It NEVER ends at just hate speech, as far as I am concerned. A website is not a government and should not be held to the same standards. In the case of brigading rotten subs, both sides should be banned imo, there's a report function for a reason.
Yes. I'd say it's a much-try amongst slice of life type shows.
Tbf, Nichibros is extremely good so it almost makes up for the disparity by itself.

Bloom into you is good but the author is pretty much done with that IP now so my hope for a S2 is low.
hmm. Maybe now I know that I'd just ignore the poll altogether then. I know I'd probably just ignore the poll if it said Ben Shapiro or Jordan Peterson, for example.
Notch is just your normal "capital G" gamer, isn't he? Or is there something else to him too?
err, by "capital G" i mean like a racist, sexist, transphobic, homophobic Libertarian, who wouldn't call themselves any of those things except "Libertarian".
That doesn't reflect my actual opinion on Notch or on trans rights, it's just an inconsequential way of spiting someone who I think is acting like a dick.
Tbf if i saw a poll like that I'd be tempted to click the "I'm a transphobe" button, *unless I knew that this was in direct response to something dumb Notch said*. Without that caveat it seems like "Inclusive Gamers" is picking a fight with a celebrity for the purpose of gaining publicity/popularity and, if they *are* picking a fight for attention, then they deserve to be messed with a little bit.

There's always pushups
Personally I'd say to either get on your feet or get on a bike and sprint until you can't keep it up any longer, but that might be a tad irresponisble if  you end up going a long way, considering current circumstances
Exercise. It's hard to be angry when you're exhausted and it feels *really* good to work it all out.
Admittedly I'm a pacifist and possibly a bit naive, but I don't think violence is the answer to racism in america. Or rather, I thinks it's a solution that may work in the short term, but definitely wouldn't in the long term. Even if you beat up every police officer, that's not going to change anyone's opinion and you'll eventually lose the monopoly on violence.

On the "all lives matter", i'd like to think  they're just being ignorant.

Life's too short to get salty
How do you decide if a tickle is 'really good' or not?
Then again, you're also missing out on stories like this:
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-52843846
Don't keep up with the news, it'll only make you miserable
I don't know who this guy is, but this seems somewhat relevant, if it's right.

Murder-but-the-guys-not-entirely-at-fault, as I understand it.
That sucks if the dude has family. Like, if he has kids it's really not their fault their dad did what he did, and it must be really scary for them
Tbh I'd probably cut and run if I were you, but that kind of thing is a personal decision not to be undertaken on the advice of randos on the internet. ;)
That doesn't even look like an argument to me. It looks like they're monologuing and not responding to anything you say.
"At fault" is probably being a bit too hard on yourself, it's not like you went into the relationship wanting this to happen.
That sounds like it sucks, a lot, for both of you. It's still better than leading her on though.

Whether this is actually a "psyop" or whether it's just a well-meaning mistake, the blackout thing is causing trouble for people.
Nobody thinks that Hectan, don't worry. Anime style stuff  in general is portrayed as nazi-dominated so we know the deal.
Agriculture would be so expensive so automate that I can't honestly see it being much more than a gimmick in a hydroponics lab.
Perhaps you should have a conversation with her about it, in person if possible, at some point.

It could still potentially be a pain to push for though. That particular example was at least partially inspired by an interview on the BBC I saw yesterday where a guy mentioned how hard it was to get (pre-legalisation) Australia to acknowledge that his husband was his husband when the husband died on holiday
Then again, I'm sure there's plenty of other similar cases of words used differently in a legal and layman context so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>, and it's not really a thing I'd actively push for anywhere gay marriage is already legal.
I wasn't actually aware of that last point, so fair enough, but it doesn't have to be China, it doesn't have to be a gay couple. I think my point still stands that different groups have different ideas of what a marriage is and what it entails and whilst everyone should be able to use the word to describe their relationship, a legal term shouldn't be based on a term that's so culturally charged. (For lack of a better way to describe it)
So beaurocrats may choose to not admit a gay couple is married
Gay marriage is not legal in China (iirc).
I'm not a lawyer or anything and just to be clear it would be absolutely everyone who had a civil partnership, not just gay couples.
That's nice and all iskeria, but say for example a gay couple goes to China on holiday and one of them unfortunately dies. Good luck telling the PRC "f you it's marriage", but I think you *might* be able to get away with being put as their next of kin if you have a strictly legal contract saying you are.
I guess that second example could also work if you're in a gay relationship and go to somewhere where gay marriage is illegal/not recognised.
The reason I think I'd be useful is for cases like Catholics not recognising re-marriage, for example, or if faith X does not acknowledge faith Y's marriage as a marriage.
It's not that I'd want to get rid of marriage. You can still do all the rites and whatever. However, I think it could be useful to have a clear divide between the legal relationship and the cultural practices/norms.
Personally I wouldn't like to get rid of the word "marriage" now we've got it in the UK, but I'd also kind of like it if Civil Partnerships were the only legally recognized relationship for tax purposes/next of kin etc and marriage was a fancy ceremony/label that only meant anything to religious people/the people in the relationship.
Are they likely to get involved in anything?
I'd actually say you should be trying alcohol as a young teen, in a safe environment with adults you can actually trust around. It's the ones who've never had any before that need their stomachs pumping in fresher's week.
It's quantities as much as anything. A sip of beer at 13, or even a single cigarette, probably isn't going to do much long term (unless you're asthmatic, in which case wtf are you doing making it even harder for yourself to breath?)
I think so? It's been a while. You'll probably be fine if you're late teens and if you don't go crazy.
No it doesn't, not necessarily.
Tbh the first slang thing *I'd* think of for "jogger" would be joggers/joggy bottoms. I think the American word is tracksuit pants?
That's probably bs and whoever wrote that just wanted to write the n word to be edgy Cocoa
<https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Jogger>
I have never heard anyone use the term in this way, but there you go.
That is a very strange take. I'd be curious as to which series they did like if they said they like yuri but not the hibimiku relationship.
It doesn't sound like they were complaining though, it just sounds like they were asking for reccomendations
Did someone say Hibike Euphonium/Love Lab?
I could understand someone saying they don't like yuri or yaoi, as they both tend to have traits that go beyond "this show/manga has a LGBT person in them" (Yuri has a lot of "oh, aren't they so innocent and chaste?", Yaoi has a lot of "get to the fucking already"), but it's kinda hard to say more without context. 

If they were looking for SOL in general with no yuri I'd kinda get it, but cgdct it seems a little bit of a strange request.

Yeah, apparently the Met had to protect some statues of racists from "football lads" who wanted to protect the statues from people who weren't there, lol.
As an example, there was a conversation in this channel a couple weeks back where we were discussing what a twitch admin had said about voice chat in games. As soon as someone said "oh she's an Otherkin" her opinion was dismissed and people talked about otherkins instead
I disagree rady. If you're using a slur against someone (unless you're somehow completely unaware of how rude the word you're saying is), you're disregarding them as being less than you. To me dismissing them is also dismissing their ideas before they've even said them. if you're not taking their ideas seriously then you're not allowing them to speak freely.
Many of them would say "I hate what you say but I'll fight for your right to say it" out of one corner of their mouths whilst spewing all kinds of disgusting things out the other. I'd wager most of them wouldn't even call it hypocrisy.
Because they don't actually care about free speech, they care about their ability to call people slurs
Chaz is the antagonist-turned-protagonist of Yu-Gi-Oh GX, lol.
They're like that because what they actually want is a fight and they don't actually care who they get into a fight with, Hectan.

I'm cautiously optimistic about Brexit right now tbh. I think Boris is going to capitulate on everything so we end up with a "soft" brexit by the end of the year.  Still painful and pointless, but less so. 

All that probably depends on your american Cypher. Most Americans I know are commies though.
Yeah Cocoa. They were one of the first bands i was really into and then that came out. At least the rest of the bandmembers are doing alright for themselves in another band.
it'd still probably raise a few eyebrows to have a guy like that memorialised on your arm. For the boomers out there it'd be a little like getting a Lost Prophets tatoo

For anyone else who can't get rid of the blm thing after reading it and doesn't like the annoying blue popup, ctrl-r allows you to get rid of it.
As a kind of tl;dr: It's mostly cultural differences/xenophobia.
There is the perception that they "invade" parks, fields, roadsides, until the council gets authorisation to move them on, at which place they'll move to the next illegal site, leaving the old place littered with trash and sometimes human waste.
Even though many of them live "normal" lives (ie, live in a house, pay taxes etc), and amongst those who don't I'm sure most of them stick to "official sites" (ie, places where the government has allowed them to set up camp), the image of a Romani in people's mind is someone who lives in a caravan that they've parked illegally on the roadside or in a farmer's field. This stereotypical Romani has an aggressive horse which might attack locals, they leave rubbish everywhere, they are a thief, and they are loud/aggressive. Also, also, because i forgot earlier, there's also the stereotype that they pull their kids out of school after primary school (age 11) so they can help with chores.

Without commenting on the validity of that stereotype, most people have never met a Romani person in a casual context so there is little oppertunity to break it down, or if they have it's likely one of the more settled Romani and thus "not one of the bad ones". To add to that, because the prejudice exists, the news will run stories of Romani/Irish Travellers doing bad things, but not good things.
Nah, longer than that for sure. It'd've been impossible to attempt to tax the romani throughout history so it's likely people hated them for that at the very least
It's right and I hate it but I can't dispute it.
It's good to see Colorado got rid of qualified immunity. Kinda insane to think that it was ever thing in the first place.

Is pointing out that the "what the hell" is probably related to the video they posted specific enough or do we need to go deeper?
It got too real a long time ago. We're in a post-real reality.
Everyone knows that ain't it.
Nuclear is, in my opinion, going to be a critical part of the worldwide energy grid, but I think relying only on it or thinking it's the singular solution / the single best answer to everything is too idealistic.
This article, which is where I got my information from, is saying we have 240 years at current rates of consumption. Just bringing it up because it's suspiciously similar to your number of ~200 years on solely nuclear. (Sorry if it's the wrong one/won't open, I'm bringing this back from a previous discussion on another server and I can't open it on my phone <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222> )
Nuclear power is awkward, not because of the waste it produces (though that is a potential problem) but because it can take about 5yrs to build a nuclear plant and about 30 to decommission one but if we went all-in on nuclear we would burn through all of our currently economically viable fuel in about 10 years. There are ways we could get more fuel (some being more viable than others), but it's still concerning imo. Any near-future power grid is going to have to depend on a mixture of renewable and nuclear power depending on local resources.
Literally every national airline, every village that this thing passed over, would complain Cypher. Every observatory, historical society too.
Unless you put it over the Pacific or something
Can you imagine how many NIMBYs you'd have to pass over with something like that?
Can you really infer future breakthroughs based on past trends? I wouldn't think so, or at least I wouldn't imagine progress to be made as quickly as that graph suggests. On solar panels in space, I imagine that'd be a nightmare once you take the kessler effect into account, considering how fragile they are
I have to admit, I am extremely sceptical on just how much seawater extraction can be scaled up, and I'm even more skeptical on Thorium (it's been 30 years away for the past 60 years, it would seem!).
Yay. 
I feel like I need to put a (?) next to that, because sacking a pedo/pedo enabler really is the bare minimum.

I don't think people *are* sick of this shit, or at least it doesn't count against the right because of  "They're all the same".
I don't know what to say tbh. It's not like she could work a miracle by herself and I genuinely don't think there's an appetite for anything genuinely left-wing in the UK right now. Anecdotally, after talking to my co-worker (who's very much one of those "not interested in politics at all" types), I think there's an increased demand for social liberalism at least. I think that's a small victory to be happy about, assuming it translates into at least some results.

ngl my dude, i do not like that article at all. It's not like fascism was a uniquely European phenomenon.
That kinda makes my point a little bit then, doesn't it? It's hard to nail down, even if we have a broad idea of what it is.
I mostly agree, but I'd say the definition of fascism can be a little blurrier than you're making it out to be. As I understand it it's basically set up to funnel power into as few individuals as possible in any way it can, meaning it can take different forms. Umberto Eco's definition of fascism is the one i think "most people" would defer to, and that thing is a whole essay!
This wiki link basically summarises the thing and some other definitions into bullet points for ease of reading

I don't think you can say the Overton window in America is right wing without saying what you're saying it's right of. It's not like there's any kind of universal centre.
I've also heard that Japan's ruling Liberal party is pretty conservative, and the fact that they've been in power almost the entire time post war probably says the Overton window is quite narrow, but it would be a pretty massive leap of logic to extrapolate anything from that imo.
I don't think that's a question that's very easily answered, because it's relative to Japan itself. You can't really relate it to America or the overton window in America, that's not how it works afaik.

Yeah, and the U.S is one of the countries that aren't dealing with it <:loser:582712599641063454>
Do you also have logic?
When was he even first elected? The 90s? Feels like he's always been pm
Oh yeah, it's almost certainly intentional too, it's just ironic.
It is somewhat ironic that it seems the only people who get a decent union in the U.S are the police.
Where is Heddlu? Wales?
Still internationalist, just the Leninist definition of it.
Or Puerto Rico if they ever get statehood.
Which state are we removing the libs from? I vote for hawaii
That's also YouTube for you as well, tbh.
That's Murdoch for you.
Idk. I'm relatively ok right now and I have no "internal" at all. I'm all surface thoughts. Maybe you just don't enjoy those things as much as you used to?
Also, don't feel like you have to be happy for doing something just because people tell you you're supposed to be happy doing it. Do what you want to do.
I guess sort of? It'd be weird if you could just choose to be ecstatic/really hyped at the flip of a switch, but you can choose to take a minute and reflect "actually I'm glad I did that" (or not, if you really really hated doing whatever).
i dunno about literally the worst time. At least it's not St. Petersburg when it was under siege or something equally nasty like that. It definitely sucks, but it could suck a lot more.
who wants to be perfect? Like, Adam is a direct lesson on that imo, he's literally perfect and he sucks.
debateable tbh, but let's roll with that assumption
what is a natural machine?
People cannot control their emotions with facts and logic, no.
How can it be that previous generations had more choice/options?
I think they meant why can't it be legalised *where they are*: something being legal an ocean away isn't useful
I dunno about where you are dovid, but it might be a situation like the UK: it's possible to get a license to grow and sell the stuff, but the only known way of doing so is being the drug minister's husband!
But that's illegal! <:gasp:613577463938940959>

As I said, they charge that much in the first place because people/insurance pays. It's the same reason private companies overcharge governments stupid amounts.
I take it your work aren't willing to pay any of the $400 they need to maintain a useful person?
Hey we all need to vent sometimes, and to remind ourselves that this shit isn't right and isn't normal.
I genuinely don't know. Sorry.
Also because worth is currently defined not by how much it takes to make something but by how much people are willing to pay for it. Turns out that people are willing to spend an awful lot of money to not die.
Because the funny line is worth more than any of us peasants, or perhaps more than all of us put together.

You need a way to break that cycle dude. Personally, i listen to rock at unsafe volumes to snap me out of it, but you need to find what works for you. Just make sure it's distracting!
Yeah they save all their smart political takes for 12 the next day so they have something to talk about at lunch.
A land war in China sounds like a brilliant idea that would definitely go well.
I don't think so, or at least not initially, not entirely. Weren't you supposed to update everything every ~50 years originally?
Inertia
Idk that a fptp can produce "better results" than the US. I dare say that whatever you think is better was despite, not because of, fptp
I don't know how effective that'd be though, and sleazeballs would probably abuse the hell out of it
Honestly I kinda wish there was a week in which neither side was allowed to mention the other party at all when asked "why should we vote for you? What will you do for us".
What has the momentum to disrupt the duality right now though? A theoretical BLM party might, if it could avoid pissing off centrists too much, but there is no such party afaik and would they be able to translate the initial momentum into staying power?
Idk. Maybe I'm being cringe here but I think it's still going to be around even in a postscarcity world.
This has a better picture anyway. Happy old man 👴
The article I read was on the other site
The article I meant to post was on this subject https://www.euronews.com/2020/09/18/poland-s-law-and-justice-left-to-rule-alone-after-united-right-coalition-colapses
Hang on sorry that's my bad, I must have copied the wrong link or something
The coalition might be called the pro-eu coalition (idk) but the fall out was over animal rights.
Poland's one of the most pro-eu countries out there iirc, comparable to Germany
In what context, lankpants? I don't understand which British thing you're comparing this to.
Having read a little more, it's nice that the fur industry gets fucked at least.

honestly the best thing you can probably encourage them to do is get professional help if it's that bad. There's only so much you can do
Mustard gas is yellow. That's basically the same as green, right?
Well, in Australia it'd be coal.
Sounds like Australia.
The tories sure as hell won't allow it, and if labour does they'd be as well disbanding because they need the scottish seats the SNP have if they want to get in in the first place.
They can't influence it that much though lank. Both Labour and Tories won't touch them with a 50m pole.
100% of seats in scotland is like 20 something percent of seats overall
UK does not have a robust 3rd party. They maybe sorta had a chance back in 2011, but that was basically the only time. Well, i guess labour's younger than the libs, but they took over like 100 years ago.
And then they became even less popular when they sided with the tories vs the snp in Scotland.
To be honest, and this is me speaking from a position of massive fucking privilege here, so feel free to block/ignore me for saying this, but I think the Good Friday Agreement/putting the choice of when to leave the UK and join Ireland into the hands of the northern irish people is the best possible resolution to the hurt they've gone through, so i think it's wrong to support a return to/glorification of armed conflict/imperialist pressuring/ anything other than the peace process. That's why i think it's kind of shitty both to be saying stuff like that and, obviously, the crap like "oh ireland should leave the eu to be with us" too. i know shitposting on the internet is almost certainly meaningless, but i really wouldn't want to affect public support for the good friday agreement.
Yeah, sorry, i wasn't assuming you specifically were making a bad taste comment, but you yourself must have seen plenty of "ooh arr up the 'ra" comments on the internet.
But then again, how soon is it before it's no longer too soon? You'd rarely hear people tell you off for spouting shit about Bosnia, for example.
That's not the usual take. I'm more used to random people spouting out IRA slogans. I know "both sides" is a meme, but spouting random/uninformed takes about Ireland and Northern Ireland is mega cringe considering so many people got hurt and that plenty of people as young as in their 30s were directly affected by the troubles.
Only thing below Corbyn now is his allotment <:uMu:586208440763023381>
and the answer is "very" <a:winku:498891469285883922>
Depends on where you live, lank. I lived in Boomerville for the last election so there was at least a one in a million chance for getting the libs over the tories. No chance for anyone else though.
What is "the british imperialist shit"? Something other than the common "we had a very big navy which was kinda cool and also the RAF was kinda cool"?
British imperialists say "they should just re-join us, it'd be great" and all that crap, as you already mentioned.
It's not so much actual irish or northern irish people i'm concerned about saying it, they fucking live there and i don't. It's more British imperialists and American wannabe liberators i'm bothered by.
They're referring to (former UK prime minister) Margaret Thatcher, rady

The thread seems to suggest one guy is getting 5 years for Breonna Taylor's death.
Is this some fifth empire shit? Wasn't that guy called Sebastian too?
You should always assume there's at least some idiots taking it seriously. See: flat earthers.
But it's a good skill anyway, so I'd still recommend taking the course.
The elections? Are things really going to be that bad? If they are you'd probably be better locking yourself inside for a couple of days until the worst of the anger burns off.
If you think you can afford to, I'd say you might as well. It's a good skill and it might give you an edge over other applicants when job searching next time you need to do that.

I don't think it's possible to leave history untouched, it's not like we can go  back in time to show people exactly what happened. That doesn't excuse this or mean that we shouldn't try to show history from different perspectives whenever we can though.
Good one.
I don't know for sure that less peaceful activities will help, but if the government/society at large is put between a rock and a soft place...
I like the idea of nonviolent protest, but here in the UK, extinction rebellion are the textbook example of non-violent civil disobedience, and they've achieved nothing. Heck, the news just completely ignores that they exist nowadays, I wasn't even aware of the ongoing "Autumn Rebellion" thing they're  doing!

No killing people is bad.
I wrote that specifically thinking of President Trump. Maybe he does and i'm being uncharitable?
It'd be at least a little nice if they made a show of wearing the mask coming onstage/up to the podium at least. A token nod to the idea that the rules apply equally to everyone. This is public speakers in general, not just nk
though then again that could be me underestimating how ruthless they are there
There's "always" been smugglers into and out of NK though. I'd be surprised if it wasn't in the concentration camps at least.
There's supposed to be no corona in NK according to the propoganda, meme god. why would he need one?
He's probably got the read that his citizens aren't too happy with him right now (about corona maybe?). It's hard to say anything for sure about NK, but this is almost certainly a publicity stunt rather than a genuine change of heart.
from what?
"taking over"
? I know for a fact that there's been DMjii stuff in the nsfw channel on this server. Do we need to block everyone who posts it there too?
Probably shouldn't open the lid on this drama pot, but who are any of these people, and if they really are paedos then why haven't they been reported to Twitter or wherever?
$30 for peace of mind sounds like an alright deal to me
Dude i'm pretty sure it's be no issue to get you on the same stuff they give guys with a low sperm count. Not to say that you do, but it's an alternative comparison point to trans people.
If you're really bothered you could probably get your doctor to get you testosterone, or a way to stimulate natural testosterone production

Can we leave this topic dead and go back to "orange man bad" or whatever?
Though then again I saw a pro-real-fur ad last time I visited the us so maybe the corps want for more than for you to buy their game too.
At least corporations are just saying "buy my game <:Todd:585406353766613027>".  I'd expect China to use the information to push true but anti-us rhetoric to disenfranchise people so they end up thinking China and the U.S are equally bad and don't care as much about China doing shady shit.
Well they will, but it'll be in aggregate to see general trends. Info on one American is useless. Info on a large portion of us society maybe not quite so much.
And as iski said, you'd be working with the t, not against it.
People can transition at like 40 and you'd never know.
Breakfast means Breakfast, yes, but I think there's a lot of people who just want it "over with" now, and they'd see a deal as being more final than no deal.
I am not sure about that. I think his base wants Brexit, but not no deal. I do not know though, for I am not his base.
If he gets even the shittiest deal there's going to be at least a segment of society treating him as a new age messiah for not getting no deal.
Oh yeah, and I'm not saying that he hasn't already done disasterous damage, just that I think he's going to decide in the end that a deal is less damaging to him/the party than no deal.
But at least we now know that breakfast means breakfast.

Tbh I wouldn't be entirely surprised if we did no-deal, but I think Johnson is going to capitulate completely at the last moment.
Yeah but there's no weird history altering cockroach things irl

Kinda curious what people's takes on this are. I'm inclined to think that the mayor who is slowing the imposement of covid restrictions is in the right here, but I wonder if anyone might have the opposite opinion?
Was putting "panzers" instead of "panders to" intentional or?
I know this sounds super generic, but have you considered asking a doctor if it's bothering you that much? Worst case scenario is them saying you're a healthy/normal level of horny.
Meanwhile here it's like the charge of the light brigade.
Either way it's probably a good idea to remind young disenfranchised voters that there's more to the dems than just Biden, if you want to be cynical about it.
iirc someone else invited her to do it?
It's true I saw them in the documentary *The Professionals* (1983)

Nobody picked Johnson because of confidence in the man.
Wow that's kinda whacky. I am genuinely surprised that's a thing
Rather than saying "possible but unlikely". I think it's straight up impossible. No way republicans would give the government the power to annul marriages (if they can do it to gay people they can do it to straight people). It's the complete opposite of "small government", as i understand it.
Maybe i'm being naive here, but I don't really understand how they can take away people's right to get married in the US. As I see it either they
1. Annul every existing gay marriage. (Surely there's no way the court would give the government the ability to annul people's marriages at will?)
or
2. Do a cut-off date after which gay marriages are no longer legal/recognised. (At which point surely someone would be able to sue the government until they give in/give up)
Oh wait you said "this" not "his". I didn't read your message properly and didn't realise we were talking about the lady Trump's put in. <:teehee:582680710931021840>

Hey, there's a chance that Biden somehow manages to not grasp defeat out of the jaws of victory! Probably.

Spooky. This might be a bit much but could you put a small camera in your mailbox to try and see who this person is? At least that way you could give a picture of the person to the police or whoever.
No kidding. I don't suppose it could be a family member/someone in the house trying to be cute with a "surprise, anonymous" gift?

I made the mistake of clicking on the beeb's comment section which is what set me off. There were people supportive of Marcus Rashford's relief campaign but there were also some of the most miserly penny-pinching bastards i've never heard of. It really makes you despair for humanity.
Labour's apparently going to force a second vote somehow. Can't wait for that one to fail as well <:notlikethis:581295203361619978>

Rather than "too many people", I think it's mostly just teenagers. I don't think most adults give a shit so long as you have some basic level of social awareness.
You mean you aren't going to become the top general in the country and fill the upper ranks of the army with ancoms in preparation for the glorious revolution?
Staring at walls is good because sometimes there is too much information flowing into your head and you need it to stop.

Or rather, holiday resorts and pubs smelled like smoke rather than the other way around
tbh i slightly prefer the smell of cigarettes to weed. Cigarettes smell like holiday resorts or pubs from when i was a kid so i get a bit nostalgic thinking about drinking cola at those places. Nostalgia tells me it definitely tasted better/different with the smell of smoke in the air.
The US might actually have a shot at this, there was a news story about Oregon (?) considering decriminalisation the other day. If it works out there then other states will probably follow

There's no such thing as a boring year. Only years where you're not paying enough attention
No 2022 because if you read it out loud it could either be the number or it could be the second 2020.
Honestly, if we're thinking 2020 is a bad year, i'm not looking forward to 2020 two.
I think it's a reference to a story.

Midday today (Thursday), right?
I suppose the problem with the paid holiday idea is that service industry jobs in the U.S don't actually pay their workers and that's a day of missed tips.
Make it a paid holiday, encourage mail-in voting for people who can't reach their polling station, put a bunch of "vote today" ads all over tv and the internet so nobody can claim to be unaware
I think using a carrot to get people to vote is better than a stick. That way if people really don't want to vote they don't have to, but there's no reason for them to not do it

How do you say it then?
nuh-vah-duh?
I don't think the map says much about the U.S besides rural/urban split. Pretty much everywhere in the west inner cities vote progressive and people living in the countryside vote conservative.
I think the opposite if anything? Isn't the meme that people smoke rather than eating?
They could have phrased it as "we're prioritising skilled workers", but no, gotta end the free thing.
Ah yes "ending" and "free". The words that always look best next to each other
Veritable doesn't mean "verifiable". Not sure if that was intentional.
`Project Veritas is an American far-right[10] activist group founded by James O'Keefe in 2010.[15] The group uses undercover techniques to reveal supposed liberal bias and corruption[11] and is known for producing deceptively edited videos about media organizations, left-leaning groups,[23] and debunked conspiracy theories.[27]` 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Veritas
This makes me pretty skeptical of this source
Of course maybe there is some voter fraud by the dems going on, but I'm not inclined to believe so based on a social media website with a large base of Trump supporters ( and Saudi Nationalists <:smalldick:459023318129836055> ) quoting a conservative newspaper (who previously published conspiracy theories about Obama) quoting the "far-right" *Project Veritas*.
He's said something strongly when in public/ not "on the hook", watered it down when "on the hook", and then states it strongly again when he's no longer "on the hook". The way I see it he's probably said what he *thinks* happened on social media, and what he actually physically witnessed to the Feds. Once you take out any assumptions/any bits he isn't 3000% sure on, then the claim probably looks a lot weaker.
If they do an independent investigation and find nothing Trump stans will say that was rigged too. There's no winning
Why do we care about this person's opinion?
Aren't the libs the current government and also climate change deniers? Why would I agree with them over people who aren't idiots?
How on earth does the successor party both have the word "reason" in their name and also some degree of common sense? Isn't that breaking a fundamental law of the universe?
Because they and their friends either own the big businesses, or believe that they will some day
tbf you could probably argue that there was violence there, a lot of those changes, a lot of socialist policies in Europe at the time, were because the ruling classes were scared shitless that they'd fall victim to a revolution like the Russian one
Is Pence *that* acceptable,  though? He, like Biden, is very "establishment" which may put off some Trump voters.
Is the white house really called the white house because of racism?
Yay(?)
If Labour's infighting continues the Tories are going to "Strong and Stable" their way to a victory 100%.
I totally get that, it isn't *fair* to want him to let it go. I still do though, because I'm sceptical about a united labour's chances at the next election (I think 2030 is our realistic best hope), and I think a Labour where the more left/centre are constantly sniping at each other has an exactly 0% chance to win.
I hope he lets the suspension go as water under the bridge, the last thing Labour needs is  more factionalism/infighting right now. Let the Tories be the ones who publicly implode for once.

UK greens aren't great. They're very anti-nuclear iirc, in a science-denying kind of way
TBH I think Labour are very close to being screwed in general. I don't think they can get Scotland back, and I don't think they're getting "the red wall" back without a miracle. Libdems are stone cold dead.
If Starmer flops the vote is going rightward and not leftward.
People don't care about that Lank. The narrative with covid is "they did their best and anyone else would have done the same", and people don't want to think about  brexit
Maybe this is being a bit edgy, but I think that so long as people are able to use violence against each other there will be violence in negotiations, especially high-stake ones.
It won't. It won't die out with the millennials or the zoomers either.
I think the actual point is to fuck up sensors and maybe also gps on drones or whatever rather than pointing at people.

The previous government (same party) ignored a petition that got like 6 million signatures in a couple of weeks.
I wouldn't *not* recommend signing the petition, as long as your aware that it absolutely will not change anything.
It's not that far off an existing overground road tbf, but it's definitely not ideal.
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-48871358 Map in the article. Both portals are in the unesco heritage sites and it looks like the tunnel goes pretty close to the stone circle itself.
A conversation in another channel/possibly dms seemingly overflowed here.
Are you okay?
Yeah I know, but lines like that just stink of lubing up the national arsecrack in preparation to bend over.
but ackshually chlorinated chicken isn't that bad so you should just give in and eat it.
We need to justify the laser weapons somehow
can't wait for the UK to enter all these proxy wars on the US side like a good little dog.
Lets hope it stays cold
What do you mean by "adopt"? Personally I'd prefer to come up with your  own idea of right and wrong rather than thinking "What would Jesus/Marx do?". Obviously that'll be influenced by the people/circumstances around you but i don't really like the idea of adopting someone else's philosophy in its entirety.
I guess if anyone I look up to my gran. She's good with people in a way I'm not (kind/friendly/looks after people), and I'd like to be more like that. I don't really look up to celebrities because I don't know them, but I guess Daniel Radcliffe seems like a cool person, never heard anything bad about him.
where are you getting that number from, 0th?
One thing that might make quite a big difference to an independent Scotland's finances is the military. Scotland absolutely doesn't want the very expensive Trident program (nuclear subs) and probably wouldn't want the Queen Elizabeth II aircraft carrier either. Maintaining a token self-defence force rather than these powerful tools surely ought to relieve some pressure on the economy.
Because the people who rioted, and their friends, and their supporters, vote Republican.
wth do two people need 6 bathrooms for?
They've been doing shooting drills regularly for what 10? 20? Years at this point so it seems strange that people are acting surprised now, is what I'm confused by
I kinda get that, but it's not new news that this is a thing they do.
I had to do one when I was staff at a summer camp over there
Why are people surprised by this? Even just passively learning American culture over the internet you should know they have active shooter drills
Please elaborate
Why?
They're going to shoot the food into people's mouths with bazookas, fenny.
We produce enough food on the planet right now to feed everyone. Actually getting said food to people is an economic issue.
I don't understand why we would need an ai smarter than ourselves to do basic tasks as fenny described.
I like how the article had to clarify that Trump is unpopular in the UK
Why would you need such a machine?
I dunno about that, by "big tech" I assume you mean companies like Google etc, and all the data harvesting/selling they do doesn't feel very "leftist".
What's the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's stake in this though?
Can we call such people an-cops?
I'm sorry for being a bad commie, my numbers aren't very big <a:sad_spin:626259648294682644>
But like, strapping someone to a chair and running electricity through them seems like something out the late 1700s or the 1800s, not something from 2021. It belongs with other whacky shit like lobotomies
I'd prefer no death penalty in all cases <:sip:346851914635280385>
Not that there's a method of execution that isn't, but moreso maybe.
Do they still use the electric chair? Seems kinda cruel and primitive.
and trains
Actually he's kinda completely right. Time *zones* were invented to co-ordinate trains. idk how common knowledge this is but i only learned it like last week. Maybe everyone already knew this though <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
Tfw you're not allowed the choccy cereal <:sadecat:582712622097498113>
I don't think that's the best justification for a system. "everyone in town A works in the factory so we'll provide education that sets people up to work in the factory, everyone in town B works in the government so we'll prepare them to work in the government" doesn't seem cool.  Sorry if i misunderstood your point here.
Believe it or not, I can be unironic sometimes.
The problem with decentralised education imo is that you're potentially opening it up for really insulative communities that enable either pedos or cults to have their way, the way private schools already have a rep for doing. That's not to say it's no good at all, it's obviously good for stellar, but I don't think going 100% decentralised is going to be great either.
Plus, a friend of mine has a good way of putting it. "Their point is obviously pretty shit if the only thing that can be said in its favour is that it's not literally illegal to express".
Taken literally, the first amendment only protects you from the government going after you for saying stuff. In like 99% of cases people use it to defend themselves its not applicable.
Google agrees with Loris
More like TV PiSs
I do not remember that, no. I remember r/pyongyang though
Political Reddit is the actual worst. Bad takes, hivemindey, AND toxic. It is a surefire way to make you angry, upset, and sleepless all the time.
Fair 🤷 I was just curious so I did a quick google. There's probably plenty of reports that rate the US higher or lower.
582. Best way to get there quickly is probably by searching for United States, as in the main body it's grouped into "North America"
Yeah, gimme a sec.
I'd say 13th isn't bad, though it's definitely not where the US thinks it is. I'm not entirely sure how credible this source is, but given that it's apparently based in switzerland I dare say it's probably not too biased for or against the US.
http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_TheGlobalCompetitivenessReport2019.pdf
You doubt, but according to this report from the World Economic Forum (<https://www.weforum.org/>) The US is 13th.
I think one of the reasons his fans are so enthusiastic is because they don't want that myth being taken away from them.
Plus all the funny man and smoking weed stuff.
I think, more than that, it's that he (or at least his myth) is nerdy childhood dreams personified. He came from relatively nowhere (yes I know about the emeralds thing but not everyone does) and now he's an inventor making futuristic cars and rockets and heavy machinery and flamethrowers.
If you're just concerned about the economic impact of an ageing population, i genuinely don't think it's such a big deal, as long as we don't let it become one. most western nations already waste tons of food, so i think in the most extreme case we cut down on wasting food, maybe make farming a more popular industry and cut down some regulations in that sector so that more people can be supported with fewer workers. With other essentials like electricity perhaps we encourage switching to power sources that require fewer people to operate them, but again, i don't think it needs to be a life-and-death thing.

whilst undoubtedly there would be problems, i think they'd be very manageable ones and not nearly important as "holy heck what is causing this?"
Dropping stock values isn't something that can kill you either
Then, as iskeria said, some kind of way of either isolating or curing it would be found, though it could potentially get very eugenics-y.
I mean, counties like NZ and Singapore have done mostly okay. Plus i'm sorta assuming that an infertility disease might be some kind of HIV-like STI, which would be easier to isolate than an airborne thing.
Then
1. It can be cured/its effects mitigated
or
2. It can be isolated
Humanity is extremely unlikely to go extinct on that kind of timescale without some kind of incredible disaster.
I mean that kind of scenario seems so implausible that it's basically inconceivable (heh). I think if things got anywhere near that severe though governments would look for ways to encourage people to have more kids and also at curing/undoing whatever was causing that rampant infertility.
Annoyingly I bet if anyone did try to protest the drone strikes right now, I bet the government and possibly also the media would "accidentally confuse" them for capitol hill rioters/supporters. Or maybe they'd pull a horseshoe theory and say "look, both far left and far right bad. Only trust centrists!"

Is that too cynical?
Also, off the top of my head, Irelands wind resources are probably in the west, to catch that atlantic wind, and nobody lives over there anyway so it'll probably work out.
It's only an uh-oh if nobody does anything about it, and the article suggests ways to increase public investment in the transmission pylons.
That's probably everything but the sports pages
It'd be ~~funny~~ actually kinda cool if this was the thing that brought down the monarchy, but that's extremely unlikely because the uk is pretty racist itself.
Also i'm pretty sure people were pretty upset about Diana's death too
The article doesn't present the riddle well. It says you have ||A (implying one) ray gun, not 10 and a bunch of mirrors! I am the 97%||
Ice? Like the people running the border camps? Isn't long Island in NY or something? What is Ice going to do from the other side of the country?
This is good right? Idunno how good/bad ALP are but the Libs were having sex scandals amongst the top members.
I think that's kinda a bad take Matt. Religious extremists may make it easy to hate religion, sure, but that's no different to extremist JoJo fans being annoying. There's plenty of religious folk who are cool
From what i know anglicanism was very catholic under Henry and he even converted back to catholicism at one point. It was only under Elizabeth that it went really protestant
Not that that's *really* that relevant but still
It's the **evangelical** alliance. 99% sure those'll be protestants
Is this after the "are you trans" interview or is that a seperate thing?
This sucks, both for trans people in london, and for the one person they must have staffing this clinic. I bet they don't get leave because there's nobody to cover them.
Now can we make ukpol go private again because it's a toxic shithole? Same for r/UK.
It's not a strong correlation but I've definitely seen a fair bit of "oh it's a femboy, what racist things do they say on twitter?" memed about.
If anything I'd consider ||femboy|| a slur for describing a similar aesthetic,rather than twink, considering there's some level of misogyny baked into the word and there's a low-key implication of "nazi" associated with the word sometimes.
Maybe for a specific kind of guy, pug?
It's a gay stereotype for a less muscular man, but i wouldn't personally describe it as a slur.
That seems like a reasonable complaint, thanks for the explanation!
I still don't really get  the twink thing though, if that is the problem.  Is calling someone a bear also problematic?
I'm sure there's some crucial information i'm missing here, but i'm missing it.
Going back to this tweet, what's the problem with it? Or what the connection to LOTR is? I don't understand this person's complaint at all.

 Also, seperate note, in the tweet they linked one of the "bad takes" was just her wondering about whether a ship exists. Sure the relationship in question might be in bad taste, but there's plenty of similarly awful ships in fiction and  fanfiction, and it's not like Ellis was saying she supported the ship or anything.
Okay, earnest if somewhat silly question time: does attraction actually work like it does in memes/fiction? Have any of you seen a person on the TV/on the street and thought "I want to have sex with that person"? I don't get it and I'm genuinely unsure if attraction actually works that way or if I am being bamboozled by a trope.
"You should stay out of politics! But please don't cut my paycheck 🥺 " you'd think with however long he's been in politics he could be a bit more subtle.
I would probably keep the oven closed (and turn it off, obviously)

Planting mangroves and stuff would be adaption. Or may she'll build a wall and make the sea pay for it.
What is in her portfolio then? Planting coal trees?
I also saw an article hyping up Liz Truss as the new Thatcher (as a good thing) the other day so who knows what they're thinking
Yes it wasn't that long ago
The response is still the same though.
You are right that is not yougov, i am dumb and thought they were the same thing.
I signed it anyway but you do know the government response to this, as it has been to literally every other yougov poll, is going to be "fuck you, plebs", right?
Matt's point is that companies refusing to support LGBT people in  the places they need the support the most makes their "rainbow campaigns" in more liberal countries seem like a shallow marketing gimmick

Is this something to do with the Poison Ivy/Harley Quinn ship? It seems somewhat tenuous.

fair enough. I guess that is a bit vulgar then
cop's not really vulgar imo, it's cute nickname for a "Constable On Patrol" aka a police officer.

ACAB, to me at least, doesn't mean that literally every cop is a horrible person in of themselves, but police forces globally have proven to be corrupt and prone to violence, especially against the working class and minorities, and "all cops are bastards" for participating in that system. ACAB is supposed to be a shocking/dramatic thing to say to draw attention to this issue.
I don't think they meant a literal sperm donor
I thought you were talking about the chauvin thing for a second, lol.
Foster care is supposed to have awful outcomes for kids, i will try to find some numbers.
I don't think the dude has the right to tell her to have an abortion or anything, but he probably shouldn't have to pay child support either. I assume that's what you're getting at.

I heard somewhere that the purpose of these boring machines was actually for space mining though, and these tunnels were basically Musk getting people to pay him to test his machines instead of having to pay himself. If that's true then it's pretty smart (and of course he gets more money because all the cars down there are Teslas).

The city council or whatever you call them though were pretty stupid for agreeing to this.
When was it he decided he was going to do a reboot? It was some event either this month or in August right?
I'm surprised Kier still has the 21%, even accounting for lizards. He's not done anything so how can he have done it well?

impossible!
They made a mistake asking for the previous guy rather than waiting for the next one though. The revolving door is surely overdue a turn around
Sounds like a normal day in Australian politics
No the point is to get political brownie points from that kind of person, whilst still making a recommendation so that they can absolve themselves of the blame when things get bad.
Yeah, the UK government is also "recommending" that people still wear masks. Basically they don't want to be held responsible any more and want to say "if there's a lot of people dying, it's your own fault, stupid proles"
Incidentally Wales is doing a review on restrictions on the 15th July and Scotland is dumping most restrictions on 9 August
It does not, though some covid restrictions are being lifted in NI on the 26th. Masks **could** be one of the things that go, but we won't know until the 22nd.

As someone who is pretty much asexual, it feels as bad or worse as you're describing when people get onto the sex/relationships topic. it's alienating and is a real reminder that there's something wrong with you. As Solo says, you just gotta learn to deal with it because the topic will always come up if you want to socialise with people on a deeper level than "I know that face/I know that name".
Wasn't that the actual code at one point? Or was that just a myth
It probably won't happen, but imagine if this actually dragged Labour under and we're back to the 1800s where our options are the Tories or the fucking Lib Dems. <:dead:638565422400274464>

NY Times are missing a crucial bit from their tweet: We can still avoid and even reverse the worst effects. As is their article will only promote fatalistic complacency
pornographic movies? I'm surprised the government allows that, it seems rather unchristian
I'd assume that like most european far-right parties AFD would be pretty hardcore on christianity, and as Kemalism promotes secularism, I'd imagine Attaturk wouldn't be too hot on that.
Being " a different person" when in different social circles is completely normal, everyone does it. All of those 'versions of you' (masks are another way I've seen it be put) are the real you.
Oh okay so it's just boomerism with chinese characteristics. Makes sense i guess.
Tbh I do not get where China is going with the  "no new games" thing. I guess maybe they might think that people are organising via in-game chats or something?
Yeah, I was thinking that it was probably mostly JRPGs that'd be affected, and Japan tends to make games for Japan first and foremost. I could see them maybe just not providing certain "too feminine" options from a character designer or something.
I wonder if this'll have much of an impact on international companies? China is a big market so I wonder if they'd be willing to potentially drop characters from games so that they at least have some access to that market.
Why would China ban content depicting democracy when China, at least nominally, employs democracy at some levels of its government? Sure, the elections are fixed so that only CCP approved candidates can stand, but I think it'd be strange for them to decide to ban depictions of democracy.

They definitely wouldn't, they'd say it was entirely on the driver.
France is getting salty because they want to lessen the west/NATO's America-centricism (ideally with them as the second pillar of the west). They probably see people cancelling contracts with them in favour of American ones as a direct rejection of that idea.
Okay,  so how are you going to get from A to B?
I really doubt it'll come to actual WW3. nobody wants that. More likely, if China did take Taiwan (which they might be able to do), The US/NATO would get pissy about it but not actually do anything about it. 
Maybe they'd launch a trade war, but that would nuke everyone's economies because everyone is tied together so tightly, so I doubt it.

I think it's more likely that the US and China have a bit of a metaphorical dick measuring contest until some kind of meeting is drawn up where they negotiate a settlement of some kind rather than any kind of land grab attempt.
Except all of us involved in a proxy war in Yemen, Cypher 🙃
But Cypher, the weaponisation of space is *ILLEGAL*, they can't do that!
Possibly, but I believe in the cold war the Soviet and NATO economies were pretty much separate, whereas it's pretty much impossible to untangle trade relations between China and "the west", so I don't think it will be the same, or even that similar.
It's just a Markov Chain text generator isn't it?
If we're going to be judging him by his voting record, the dude consistently voted against reforming the house of lords, against raising benefits, and for reducing housing benefits. He was against gay marriage and human rights in general. I still don't think he should have been stabbed, and I definitely wouldn't celebrate this without being 100% sure the guy who stabbed him wasn't a nazi stabbing him for nazi reasons.

I still can't believe that wasn't staged in some way. It's too funny.
Personally I haven't experienced it much, there were a lot of queues for like a week and after that not many issues. It's apparently a very regional thing where some places are fucked and some are not.
This is like the 4th(?) time in the past 5 years that a member of cabinet (the politicians directly in charge of stuff) has taken a break whilst their area is on fire. It is completely normal 🙃
I suppose you could compare it to Nero and his violin, in a way.
Honestly you don't need to comment. This is business as usual.
I think this is what they call "coping".
Simply proclaim a republic, proclaim Whitlam's corpse the eternal president, and do the just transition thing anyway.
<https://www.tuc.org.uk/how-unions-work>
Flicking through this website should probably give you a better idea of what a union is and how they're organised.

Another major case study about unions that's going on right now is that the workers at the John Deere tractor company are on strike for better conditions. John Deere responded by retraining a bunch of office workers to fill the gaps. This has also led to a "mistake"
<https://theintercept.com/2021/10/26/john-deere-strike-accident/>
A union is when a whole bunch of workers get together and work together to get paid properly/fight against unsafe conditions and workplace discrimination (Join a union!).

As I understand it: In this case the unionised workers at the filming said "Hey, this set is super unsafe, we're not going to put ourselves at risk until you fix this shit", so the non-unionised staff on the set were forced to do all the extra work, including arranging this prop.
I expect you to fit this fact into the d&d session seamlessly, cypher!
San Marino isn't legally sovereign?
Theologically, is the pope even allowed to have opinions? I thought they were supposed to be direct telephone lines to God.
Wait how is genesis a retelling of the big bang? I guess you're equating "let there be light" to the actual bang, but that's the only parallel I can think of.
Fines don't mean anything if they don't change behaviour, and afaik PiS are still being stubborn?
Well why not give them a good way to dispose of it, Amogus? Surely it is the duty of every local government to provide waste collection services? Saying "they're poor, they can't help it" isn't a good excuse.
How about we don't put the plastic in the river in the first place?
Sounds rough buddy. Can your union do anything to help get a pay rise?
They did do operation condor, so it's not surprising that people suspect them of all kinds of shit.
Or how did you get to the 4?
Surely we're on a higher number than 4? We've had both Keynesian and Neoliberal economics in the past 50 years just in the UK, so surely there wasn't stagnation for the previous 150?
Going back to the capitalism thing for a sec, Sir Alan Sugar is your example of someone genuinely working class getting very rich. 

Just because it's happened at least once doesn't mean it's a trend or anything, it's just to show that this kind of thing *can* actually happen in the real world.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Sugar
The hashtag is a little hard to read, at first I read "LGB with het" and wasn't sure what he was saying.
I feel like if EU countries (for example) mandated that actually a company MUST be able to know the carbon footprint of their whole supply chain that would probably then that would negate the "uncompetitiveness" aspect and probably also shorten supply chains
I think you can probably do more than you think with personal stories Cypher. Even for a boomer, it's one thing for (eg) trans people to not be able to transition, it's another thing for them to see the effect not being able to transition has an effect on people they know, such as a grandchild for example.
If a society was structured correctly they wouldn't necessarily have the power to "tip it back"
Not all of them Cypher, and not all of those leaders' power is/was as absolute as power is nowadays. For example there's archeological evidence of Basque societies that arranged their settlements in hollow circles and duties went around the circle from house to house. They weren't exactly small either.
I feel like you can even back off from capitalism there and just leave it as western culture, which obviously created capitalism
Well yeah, i was sorta going after the "entirely" of the "entirely co-operatively"
That's not entirely true, as I understand it Lank. I've been reading this book "The Dawn of Everything", by Graeber and Wengrow, and they seem to show that it varies quite a bit by culture.
Do we though, or are we taught that?
The answer is sortition

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ireland>
They are already out of the line of sucession Kat, and even if they weren't then they'd be like 10th in line or something
What does the governor general do?
I kinda like the idea of a direct election for President, like how the Irish do it. Giving parliament the power to elect presidents is a bit poop.
Sadge. I was listening to a republican who was talking back in like 2016 and she had hope for those
Did anything come of those letters though, Lank? There doesn't seem to have been much fallout from my pov
The best answer to that is we don't know iski, we know they do under the table pressure to bend laws in the UK, and we know they did dismiss a popularly elected AUS PM

Aren't income (paired with capital gains) taxes better than wealth taxes? Because with wealth tax people just create a shell company/charity and put all their wealth in that.
More seriously, I'm sure there's some kind of "shock doctrine" theory behind what they're doing, even if I don't know money enough to know the specifics.
No you see they can't delete the virtual money so they need to print it out so they can burn it to reduce inflation.
Morrison said that? I knew he was a twat but I thought he was just a coal shill

Presumably you would have some kind of communally agreed land zoning rady. If his plot of land is in an area that is designated for housing, and his house fits building regulations, he could build the house. If not, no.

Wow just like in the hit anime non non biyori!
Skyscrapers are one thing, but 2-4 floor townhouses are also pretty dense and don't have the "mega city" feel.
That sounds like the condition "Misophonia"
Yeah, though obviously a factor in that is that male cattle don't make milk.
I don't think it is. I can only speak anecdotally, but I know my family and I both have reduced the amount of meat, especially cow, in our diets since we found out how bad beef was for the environment. I'm sure plenty of other normal people are at least making a small effort to reduce the impact of our diets on the environment too.
Not really, it was more like "yes, beef really is that bad, but you're intelligent people who can use that information to make your own decisions".
It talks a lot about Supply and Demand without demonstrating any understanding of what that means.
Are we sure we're not falling for  a bit here? this definitely seems like parody.
I like how they couldn't even just get a copy of Das Kapital off Amazon for the ad <:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
And where do you even begin unpicking the Jenga tower as a metaphor for supply and demand?
Well yes, but it feels to me like that kind of person shouldn't exist in the real world. Obviously they must do, but it doesn't feel real. Shit's crazy.
What kind of psychopath buys that kind of token?
I hope that if they're able to recreate milk that way it turns out really similar to cow milk. Milk substitutes are fine, but they are definitely inferior substitutes imo.
Maybe but this way Discord gets a cut
Can you call a relative or close friend and talk to them about it? Hearing a real person's voice might help calm you down
Yeah I guess it really is an ex-mas tree now.
Maybe but chances are, if the damage was a political statement, said arsonist thought Fox was too *left* wing.
Have you tried this?
I feel like the way people always make pattern-learning bots racist means that any kind of decision making robot in the future will also end up super discriminatory and bad.
Have they actually banned it or did they chicken out like the UK gov?
Isn't that just slavery at that point?
Are they still allowed to wear masks at least, or is that going to be violation of the school uniform/dress code now?
You really have to hand it to conservatives in general that somehow nothing ever sticks to the bastards
It's a bit annoying though because you just know that even if people don't forget all this (possible) then the Tories will just off him and basically start with a blank slate of a reputation again.
Whether they'll win or not, I hope they do but Amazon definitely has the money to play dirty.
AFAIK you can put together a class action lawsuit anytime. I hope the workers at these factories do.
There's one of him dressed up as a police officer, which is probably the most offensive one I've seen, but they're all awful.
Exactly what it sounds like. Cartoon pictures of George Floyd dressed up in different outfits being sold as NFTs
Don't worry, it's still slightly more tasteful than the George Floyd nfts which manage to be racist too!
Idunno Lank. We have it pretty bad here in the UK rn, and we aren't locking down. Then again, Johnson doesn't really have the authority that people would follow one anymore.  Maybe Scotty from Marketing, or some of your state leaders, can call a lockdown still.
Poland has heard of banana republics and doesn't want to become a Discovery 
Channel republic.
It's hard to say. Currently the opposition is more popular than the government in the polls, but I think that introducing new restrictions would probably erode government support further rather than help them
It's getting worse because Omicron is highly contagious but they promised "no more restrictions" back in August and they think it's political suicide to change their tune.
If it gets worse they'll throw a dead cat on the table and tell people to talk about that instead. Maybe another juicy antisemitism scandal in labour or another garden party.
I genuinely don't think the UK will lock down again, come what may. [Middle class white] people [aka the Tory base] have decided that they're bored of COVID and that any attempt to lock down will have worse consequences than staying open.
I haven't heard of this. Afaik the most the PM has said he *might* do is introduce limits on how long bars are open on NYE
Not a fan of Shapiro but "Facts and Logic" is a funny bit, especially when prefaced with something nonsensical. Same for "Checkmate Liberal".
Hominini is a funny word. It's like a human panini or a "same panini"
Which comment?
maybe your monkey brain doesn't know that? Idk I feel like this is some high-level behavioural psychology stuff that we can all only really guess at.
Probably some "social animal" deeprooted psychology to share exciting information with as many people as possible. You want people to know that a lion is coming or that there's food here.
Lol I googled "Australia racist lady politician" and it knew I was talking about her
Sorry I've forgotten her name, but you probably know who I mean.
What about the racist lady? Or is she a liberal?
Australia politics be wilding
I thought Barnaby Joyce got kicked out? How is he back?
They might try a deal of some kind maybe? We get the mouse (and probably the Disney Princesses) brand forever, you can have a load of these other IPs we don't care about.
Mickey Mouse I think they will move heaven and hell to keep. They will find a way to extend the licence again, I think.
I think I remember that one lol
This is kind of a funny point, because if you deregulate social media then you run the risk of Nazis taking it over too! (As seen on voat and the other pro-trump platforms). It is horseshoe theory!
Seize the means of retweeting!
Even if this was a totalitarian government and not the US, how would this even work?
It probably will, right? If the Kazakh police decide that they can't contain the protests themselves.
I think they're like that chris-chan person? Terminally online and probably not well.
Aren't they some weirdo streamer person?

So you can get into Australia on the wrong visa to teach a liberal party donor's kids horse riding, but not to play tennis? <a:fujiThink:393823977585508352>
oh yeah, and I also made the mistake of reacting before reading the article <:teehee:582680710931021840> (the girl is alive and stable for anyone else who didn't read the article)
They didn't specifically target the 4yr old, they blindly shot into the apartment and hit her.
Was there ever a doubt?
It's bad to put drunk people in taxis?
True!
The purpose of the thing is to go to a baseball stadium though, right? Surely you want a less active mode of transport so that drunk people can use it safely. Never mind it goes to a convention center, not a baseball stadium
That was more or less the original pitch though, before it became a Tesla tunnel
There's not like a moving cable along the floor
Pretty sure there's an electric rail but I never bothered to pay that much attention
I do not know <:clueless:581295202551988235>
The Glasgow metro trains are 2.65m tall, you might be able to make those fit
Reroute boat armour into plating trains instead.
1. That's quite hot
2. I meant plate steel. With extra rigidity so that in the case of a crash they can simply move the obstruction out the way.
Simply build your trains entirely out of solid steel so that they do not catch on fire.
This is a guess, but from what I've seen of those tunnels they don't look amazingly ventilated.
Does Australia just hate tennis players or something?

It this an 0-1-2?
Could you point out that part to me? I just reread the article to check, and it pretty much dives straight in to "decentralised finance" and then NFTs. What other uses does it talk about?
The parallel the article tries to draw is gambling. "Don't invest what you can't afford". I'd feel relatively comfortable saying everything related to gambling is a scam.
The article presents people saying it's a scam then tries to weasel out of the obvious conclusion based on "well maybe one day it won't be a scam".
I feel like if you have to ask "is X a scam?" It's probably a scam.
They don't exactly need anything for one of those right now,  we're selling to the lowest bidder
Yeah you'd like to think they were apolitical, that's why I'm saying it's probably too tinfoil hatty
That's probably too much of a tinfoil hat theory though.
The conspiracy theorist in me makes me wonder how much influence the Home Secretary (Patel) has on MI5 and whether she could force them to go public with this as a political manouvre to try and distract people from the Conservative Party infighting.
Can't wait for the "Labour has been bought by the CCP" narriative that'll win the Tories the next election.
I think that the CCP probably would be hoping to get some kind of leverage for some kind of guarantee that Britain stops trying to sail warships through the south china sea, maybe pulls out of AUKUS, and doesn't do anything if China did try something with Taiwan. I agree that they must've been courting Tories too though, and that's been hushed up
It's kinda funny hearing the guy pronouncing "newark" as "nork"

Putting aside how complex the autopilot's features may be, why would you not immediately turn it off when you were approaching the red light and it wasn't slowing down?
I think that's sort of missing kat's point, that if the Qing were more organised and invested their resources more efficiently they could've made many such boats, and thus been a lot less vulnerable to gunship "diplomacy".

Not for lack of trying though
Good.
One thing I'm a bit surprised they've not come out with is endangered animal NFTs. "Own a NFT of one of the last two northern white rhinos" surely has some kind of appeal.
Besides, Abbott is a white man. The most likely candidates for Johnson's replacement ATM are a POC man (Sunak), a POC woman (Patel), and a white woman (Truss). You can't bring in a white man and ruin the Tory party's image as the party of diversity.
Come on, there's a lot wrong but you can't judge us by The Spectator, that's just unfair
Yes but if we're going to reach a diplomatic solution here then that is likely going to involve Ukraine letting go of the areas currently held by separatists, and there being very little to stop Russia simply doing the same thing again.
I guess the other thing that's worth mentioning is that there's a neonazi paramilitary called the Azov Regiment fighting on the side of the Ukrainian government. Though they got incorporated into the Ukrainian army so the "para" part of "paramilitary" may no longer be appropriate. One of the things the US is doing to puff its chest out is sending military advisors to train the Ukrainian army, which would include these bastards, and it's likely that they are sharing this training with other fascist groups around the world.
I feel like I might've been a bit too pro-Russia there in my attempt to be impartial, so I would like to clarify that I don't think they're a *good guy* in this situation, they're trying to do a bit of imperialism on a neighboring country because they don't like the decision that country made.
This is not to say that there are no genuine pro-independence sentiments in Donetsk or the other areas, I don't know.
To go just one layer back, Ukraine used to be in the Russian sphere of influence, then around 2013 (iirc) they pivoted towards NATO and the west. Since then various Russia-backed independence movements in the east of Ukraine have appeared, meaning that large areas of the country are contested between Ukraine and the separatists (&Russia). What I understand is that Russia wants a buffer state between itself and NATO, whereas NATO would love to humiliate Russia.
There's lots of Russians standing around it. Ukraine doesn't like this, USA and friends are puffing out their chests to appear big and scary. That's the short version. There are many increasingly long versions depending on how far you want to go back.
It's good to see even people from marketing can be reformed into honest workers. <:yuibless:582737307367505943>

UK is in the "perfect democracy" category still, at 18th place, it went down like 0.4 from 2020, probably because of that time the prime minister tried to illegally prorogue parliament. (actually I don't remember what year that took place, Covid time is a blur)
Ah I guess that makes sense yeah.

Plus, as he's a lib, missing a vote likely counts as a service to his country.
Phrasing the title as if the MP actually did soil himself when the rumour-starter denies that there was any 'soiling' is mean. "Man falls asleep at work" isn't really a news story though. He shouldn't have done it, but I wouldn't consider it "seriously wrong".
Actually yesteryear's worries were radioactive boars, according to Cody
Yeah, it's quite worrying how this conflict seems to be emboldening the far-right back in the USA and UK. I did not expect to see them go batting for Daddy Putin against the "decadent west".
They've already disavowed Zelenesky so I think there's a decent chance of them getting kicked out of the army and  then ??? in this scenario. I don't think they'll get dissolved as such, I don't think the government will have the power to do that.
One theory I've heard for Russia making and then not holding to ceasefires is that they want to generate some internal propoganda. They want to say "look at the evil Ukrainians, they are not letting civilians escape during a cease fire, they are using them as human shields. This is why we need to rescue the Ukrainians from the Nazis".
NATO is never going to get involved because there's too large a risk of a shooting war between NATO and Russia turning into a Nuclear war between NATO and Russia and nobody wants that.
Except it's Paliament that is sovereign, not the monarch. I guess technically that also means that in a way Parliament claims authority over god. Hadn't thought of it that way before lol.
Sorta picking at nothing here, but Israel isn't even a theocracy, is it? It's just a very religious democracy. I've never heard of them justifying their leaders as divinely chosen.

There's layers of wealth, right? You can get "rich" through your own labour by being a highly skilled doctor, or you could win the lottery, and those are relatively unproblematic. If you're a multi-millionaire though you're definitely exploiting somewhere.
Nope, there is no bias in Australia towards the libs. None at all and any word to the contrary is libel.
Argnetina
It would be very funny if they did somehow manage to conquer and hold the islands, even though it'd be a human tragedy and the islanders don't want to be Argentinian.
Eh, someone was talking about the Falklands the other day. They might try again if they're feeling lucky.
Plus as I understand it, capital in Russia is hyperfocused in Moscow so people outside won't necessarily feel much impact.
Plus Argentina is pretty ignorable and they default very regularly
Didn't Russia default on a load of stuff in like the 90s and then everyone just sorta forgot about it within months?
He do be purging people though, which could keep enough people in line.

Everyone in the gambling system I meant
~~this is totally not me trying to justify the ethics of me winning a fiver on a scratch card once~~
I guess, but by that logic wouldn't everyone in the system be an exploiter? It doesn't seem right to me to say that someone with a gambling addiction is doing a grift. In my mind everyone is a victim in the system.
I agree with you that the gambling system is exploitative, but I don't think someone who "gets lucky" within that system is an exploiter, if that makes sense. Of course, there's also a decent chance that someone who gets lucky will blow all their gains on more gambling anyway so it's maybe not fair to call them rich.

Yeah but this was almost certainly written by a centrist (and most likely a "centrist" who always ends up voting right)
I got this screengrab from someone else so I haven't actually read the article. but I imagine it's the standard BS of the conservative as the disciplinarian father vs the left/liberal as the coddling mother and that the tl;dr of the article is that the author thinks Labor should promise to give criminals harsher sentences and cut down on (supposed) benefit scroungers.
Well I guess the vibe they're going for is that the general public are the children, but I'm sure we can think of more cursed answers than that
I think it's perfectly self explanatory, the coalition are the daddy, labor are the mummy, and the child is...

That's definitely a step up from what I remember! I never did GCSE+ History so maybe i'm unfair on the curriculum in general, but I don't remember covering the world wars in history at all. I think we got some of the Holocaust in R.E and something on remembrance day? Definitely the Flanders Fields poem but i'm not sure about anything else.
Henry the 8th established the Church of England, which was a good thing, then (don't worry about it), then we saved the world in the two world wars.

I don't really know what the consequences of that could be, but a major not-english-language set of software seems like a significant thing
Not a computer person so idk if this is a thing, but theoretically if they're going for all-chinese software and operating systems maybe they could also go for a Chinese based programming language, starting from scratch, rather than an English based one. The Chinese market is probably big enough that it'd maybe not be a waste of time to develop such a thing for the domestic market alone, and then they could potentially export it too.
Are you talking about corruption or cocaine here?
Wiping the floor is probably an exaggeration. though the generals getting assassinated is funny, I believe it was the same in the winter war (which Finland ultimately lost)
Of course, I'd have probably have said the same about Russia.
I don't believe it's likely at this time. If such a conflict were to happen it'd probably have to be NATO Vs China, and I don't believe either side has a reason persue a total war with the other.

I hear that some ministers might resign so maybe something will come of the no confidence vote after all, but I'm still skeptical that anything will meaningfully change.
The line currently is that a larger segment of the party voted for Johnson now than he was originally selected on.
I'm not sure it is dumb. This way they can say. "We are strong and stable and we get the job done, as opposed to Labour who are indecisive and infighting". I think that could potentially work well enough to get them through the next election.

Seems fine.
Besides, you can do multiple things at the same time
Ireland doesn't
I think you're probably in a bit of a bubble Ghostra. If the UK government ignores the Good Friday agreement than the material conditions now will be the same as before that treaty came into effect  and people will once again get angry. Things won't go big straight away, but they will eventually, if nothing changes.
It was literally a war, people weren't playing nicely and only doing protests. Soldiers were using kids as human shields and doing murder and torture and  other unpleasant things.
Well you had a load of anti-Irish racism on the UK side and a load of extrajudicial kidnappings and torturings on both sides. And lots of bomb threats
Well it's more people shooting the government they'd be concerned by
Which uni do you go to, out of curiosity? I am very surprised that it's entirely unionist.  I'm pretty sure every uni has a marxist society and that'd definitely be anti-english
Side note, "Republic of Ireland" was a term invented by the british government. I always wonder if the term was invented by someone with a dry sense of humour, as "ROI" is the French word for king.
That would never happen Matt.
I wouldn't be so cynical. It's a matter of demographics, the young want an united Ireland more and more. Brexit compounded this, as I understand. It won't be easy, the UK government will do everything in its power to stop it, but I genuinely think there will be an United Ireland in our lifetimes.
There's a difference between a foreign war that doesn't really affect "home" that much and an actual civil war
What? It literally ended 30 years ago. More or less
Huh, I'm surprised by that. I'd have thought that a more balanced history would've been a condition of the Good Friday agreement
If there is a hard border I am 100% that there will be partisan violence, though you're probably right that Ireland won't unilaterally declare war or anything crazy like that
Yeah. I feel bad for y'all in NI. You're a political hostage and football right now, and it doesn't look like things are getting better any time soon.
The DUP can shut down Stormont, yes. I don't think that's going to be at the front of people's worries though if there's actual wide-scale violence again.
Yes Sinn Fein grew from the political branch of the IRA
I wouldn't be entirely surprised if this went like the cod wars and the U.S just says "no you can't do that". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod_Wars
The EU is absolutely going to sue the shit out of the UK if this actually passes. The US has a large Irish Diaspora, notably including the president, who will press for sanctions against the UK. Not to mention, it's not like there aren't IRA cells still around. Things might not happen immediately, but there are plenty of people willing and able to put pressure on the UK.
England, Westminster specifically, is going a little insane right now. *Sinn Fein weren't supposed to win*
Yeah. This isn't going to end well.
Of course people do it. It's like creating a  NFT but you invest time rather than ETH and you get an actual product at the end.

The democrats aren't doing a garbage job because that would imply they're doing anything. Vote 3rd party. They won't win the next election, they probably won't win the one after that, but you will eventually be able to build a movement that can change the status quo.
If the liberals are just going to let the conservatives pull shit like this when the liberals have the power to stop them, there's no difference between the two. The democrats have chosen to allow this to happen.
What I will be doing at our own elections in 1-2 years is voting for the furthest left party I can in protest of our own supposedly center-left party also being worse than useless.
I'm british
The republicans are winning the next election anyway (hello federal abortion ban). Their base is going to be massively energised by this whilst people will simply not show up for the dems, and why should they?
I get the impulse to find a "less bad" lever and pull it. It's just the "less bad" is still looking unworkable to me right now.
Actually doing things isn't the Democrat way, unfortunately. It's nice to know there are options though.

The gods we know of aren't exactly fans of heathens, heretics, and non-believers though. Their "benevolence" might still involve conversation to the true faith whether you want to convert or not.
The perfectly benevolent dictator also needs to be omniscient and maybe omnipotent. At which point you're basically just saying the best form of government is Theocracy.
I don't really agree with this, even a perfectly benevolent individual cannot empathise or understand every perspective and will naturally favour the perspective of people like them. Even if they are generous with handouts to "the other" they are still lacking and will make harmful or ignorant policy sometimes.

 IMO a truly representative council/parliament where everyone is acting in good faith (whilst an equally fanciful idea) is a better theoretical form of government. It may be slower to come up with a solution but it'll come up with a fairer and more equitable one.
I guess China still kinda does it but they also do market stuff too

What did Ted Bundy do then, if he wasn't the zodiac killer?
Ok Ted Bundy
TBH I didn't know much about it until a few years ago. For various reasons these guys got their guys into the kingmaker position in british politics. That made a lot of England, Scotland, and Wales need to understand what the deal with NI was for the first time.
Except when they got the DUP to be relevant to the rest of the country, yes
Going to mostly disavow that, NI is it's own special brand of fucked
I think it is fairly regularly they do this (yearly?)
I don't really know who the people on the pyre are, but I do know that The Orange Order (bad people) had a parade today and the fire is probably something to do with that.
I guess it feels more sinister to me given the context of NI's not so distant history
I want to say it's different but maybe it's not
I feel like the blatant putting political opponents on the fire, especially the moderates (going after Alliance rather than Sinn Fein), is a bit frowned upon in most places.
I don't think I'd be able to ride a motorbike without anxiety. Being inside the car must feel a lot safer than being atop the bike. I'd like to give a vespa or something a go, but at low speed and absolutely not around cars.
<:shakehands:992231260325953596>
Anxiety because of driving hasn't ever really been a thing for me. I do not contextualise it as being in a 2 tonne death machine, it just is what it is. Living in a country of relatively good drivers and not having to do city driving often definitely makes it easier though.
Tell them to go socialise more rather than living vicariously through you <:mischieve:586208451630202936>
Yeah there are definitely people among us who can be pretty sus.
Nothing wrong with being Asexual/Aromantic. It's just like that for some of us. Just don't write relationships off entirely - Stress/Depression can surpress attraction as I understand it, and feelings in general can be fluid over time.
Wind down the window, put on the radio, talk to yourself, drink caffeine but do not do the sleeping

Ok, it'd be really funny if it turned out he was Harold Wilson 2 and MI5 really were out to get him (presumably for completely different reasons)
Why no energy to waste near Rome? Presumably Rome has some industrial area it wouldn't look out of place in
Honestly that sounds like probably one of the worst ways to do solar power, because people will take the money and insist on installing the panels in stupid places. However it's what everyone else is doing so it's understandable.
I thought 5 stars were supposed to be pro-environmentalist? I'm surprised he was buying foreign gas rather than building solar plants or something.
If they're feeling especially evil they'll arrange with their host states for extended sentences for those who don't meet quotas to keep people locked in even longer
They'll simply turn to slavery and employ prisoners who aren't allowed to quit. They'll keep the metrics and use other punishment methods than termination instead.

They literally have hotels specifically targeted towards gay people, idk what else to call that.
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-60339741
You still probably don't want to go into the more rural part of the country, but Cuba is definitely one of the safer countries in the Carribbean for gay people afaik
They've been relatively good on LGBTQ stuff for a while, around 2010 Castro apologised for the way gay people were treated in the 60s. (To be clear, they were treated awfully, put into concentration camps).

Since the outbreak of COVID 19 the country is trying to cultivate themselves as a gay holiday destination as an extra income stream because their economy is massively in the shitter right now.
They're just chilling there sunbathing rather than fighting to defend the Holy Constitution.
The alligators aren't patriotic enough.
I mean your mom is probably hearing stories about people being radicalised into committing terrorism/ being groomed by abusers over the internet and is worried for you. It's not exactly reasonable, but at the same time it's probably a good thing she's worried for you. (Even though it's annoying)
Yeah, so these are the midterms, how much more spread out could they be? They're literally in the middle
It's already been almost 2 years though, Biden came in at the start of 2021.
That kind of erratic behaviour almost makes it sound like they fell asleep at the wheel or something
I think that didn't happen until later? My understanding is that the initial colonies were on bought land. The colonisers intentionally ripped off the Native Americans but if they'd tried shooting initially they'd've been easily killed.
It's probably also worth pointing out that it's dubious how much Russia/social media trolling in general is able to affect change, we shouldn't assign more power to them than they have, or absolve everyone else of their own agency
Russia is probably supporting specific dems too, to be fair. They want American democracy to look and feel illegitimate and they can get that both by supporting crazies like Trump and by supporting "born to rule" types like the upper echelons of the democratic party.
The reason I'm confident in this is that they keep trying and failing to ban porn websites. They can't do it though.
I will say that this would never happen in the UK on the grounds that the government is too incompetent. It'd either never get implemented or there would be a really easy workaround found within a week.
You say never but it wasn't so long ago that they were proposing that 2 tier internet thing where companies paid for faster connection. That would have virtually shut out a load of smaller websites and probably a decent amount of open source ones too.
Sounds like you want a Putin, Broom. Nein, danke
I don't think they did? Abe really wanted to, but I don't think he actually got it (yet)?

I mean maybe what happens is that people move to more moderate unionist parties rather than voting SF, but that's probably still a win?
For now. I appreciate that this source maybe isn't the strongest, but it suggests that younger people are much more likely to support unification than old people, and I doubt that's something that'll change as they age. Especially as the DUP are utter ghouls.

https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2021/12/northern-ireland-unification-or-the-union/
On the contrary, if the UK had been able to regain control of the island they would've, it's the UK that lost. You can't defeat an insurgency. You can beat it down, but doing so only radicalises the next generation of combatants.
by what metric? They're free
The rest of Ireland would've said that once upon a time. It won't be easy or quick, but it'll happen.
The UK is going through a period of monumentous change right now. We have the uncertainties of Brexit and the Neoliberal ideology is either dead or dying, with no heir apparent. I won't say "if not now, then when?", but I wouldn't say it's impossible either.
Yes. However it's not about money, it's about pride. NI to England is like a toy to a dog. "No I'm not going to do anything with it. No, you can't have it".

There is a world in which the political calculus of getting a nice photoshoot at a re-unification ceremony outweighs the cost of being "the one who oversaw the UK losing one of its constituent kingdoms", but I don't know what that world looks like.
The causes are very bad but the results are very funny (good), so to speak.
Ok this is bad but it's also funny.
It's doing transphobia. Either that or it's trying to pretend it didn't do a transphobia
I think it was largely the previous ruling class in most cases. It didn't really matter who it was though, the colonial governors just needed someone to create internal strife and division in the colony so that the population didn't unite against the colonisers.
Why were you asking an anime discord server about German/Belgian colonial policy in the first place though?
There was a revolution in 1959-1962 that offed the Tutsi monarchy and replaced it with a Hutu Republic, apparently, and then the civil war was the Tutsi coming back from Uganda.
So yes they were, according to Wikipedia. The page on Rwanda says that independence from Belgium was granted on an anti-colonial and anti-tutsi sentiment, for a slightly corrobating piece of evidence.
The area was ruled as a colony by Germany (prior to World War I) and Belgium. Both the Tutsi and Hutu had been the traditional governing elite, but both colonial powers allowed only the Tutsi to be educated and to participate in the colonial government. Such discriminatory policies engendered resentment.[citation needed]

It's kinda funny that we don't actually know what Latin sounded like, we just have to sorta guess.
There's also the problem that it's difficult to preserve meaning through translations. If only we had some kind of universal language that we could use to communicate without all these misunderstandings. Instead we just have to babel on without.

Nah it makes perfect sense, not everyone is going to be able to interpret the word of God perfectly, so occasionally theologians need to go over it to correct the record.
Like I think the one where ~~Jesus~~ some guy (not Jesus) sicks a bear on some kids isn't canon
The bible is a collection of books, and like all collections of books, some are deemed not canon.
Sounds like heresy, proddy sc*m! <:bully:463257081710116874>

Over 75% coal is a little bit funny.

Do you not have nuke power in Poland though? Obviously coal is cheap but I'd've figured the Soviets would've built some anyway, for making bombs or something.
You know what would also save a load of emissions? Busses. Even just normal diesel ones make a big saving.
No.
I'd recommend reading the replies a little bit because this person talks aboiut it a little bit more below, and I don't think I could summarise everything they have to say properly.
Obviously there's potential for a world of difference between the law and enforcement of the law, but this is still good, I think.

Nah because if everyone around you is unhappy then you'll be unhappy too. The idea is that even working with this hedonism you'll not maximise your happiness unless your friends/family are also happy, and everyone is someone's friend or family so...
Well yeah but it'd be shocking if they weren't doing well. They're nationalists and Russia, their boogeyman, is doing scary things right now. Of course they'd be popular.
Yeah for sure.
If Donald Tusk teams up with Poland 2050 (no idea if that's a realistic proposition at all) they'd have more, at 38%

Politico has PiS in the lead but only on 37% so maybe.
No more PiSing in Poland.
Not an expert thought so I'd be glad to learn more

That's a big assumption
Well there's a degree of thought applied, in that a load of conservative Cubans moved to Florida, and Florida's a key swing state so those Cubans are an important demographic to appease
Badly. You can guarantee that much.

I think you're wrong. Any head of state/former head of state getting assassinated is a big deal, especially when it's done by a guy with a whacky improv gun. This is as true of Abe as it is of Bolsanaro or Biden or Macron.
Centrist is when you're right wing but embarrassed about it. Or when you don't want to think about issues.
Though third rail is even worse iirc
I wouldn't recommend it, it's a painful and unpleasant way to die. Living isn't necessarily going to be a good outcome either.
True, but it's significantly more difficult to step on an overhead.
Car batteries do be doing that. This is why the overhead wire is the superior way of powering electric vehicles.
They have however put the marriage thing in the constitution, so it will be impossible to make the argument that this discrimination is unconstitutional, which is what got rid of 377A in the first place.
You can tell that that coup in the video is fake because the general in the thumbnail does not have enough medals
Book Haram is basically what they think anyway.
Australian SAS doing war crimes in Sahara whilst allegedly fighting Boko Haram doesn't sound amazing tbh.
ASDF (like JSDF) is four letters in a row on a qwerty keyboard though. You can't do that!

I agree that skateboarding is a vital skill for any politician. Tony Hawk for president!
Strictly speaking it happened yesterday. I hope Pizza Hut breaks the embargo to provide food for his wake
They can't be irrationally oblivious, that's heresy! What about my Homo Economicus?
No, go on. What's happening to Kazakhstan?
Also, they did get significant territorial concessions from germany already, if you look at Poland in the 1930s and then in the 1950s you can see the whole country got shifted west.
Because they were both Soviet puppet states and Moscow would have called any troublemakers for a "discussion"

I suppose it doesn't even have to be news. Fiction should work too
You mean a news channel? Doable but your mileage may vary based on how closely you stick to the sensibilities of the day.
yeah absolutely. there is likely always going to be a market for sex work. if you provide a legal and (more importantly) safe environment then people are going to prefer to use that over shadier options.
I agree that cop unions are bad, but I don't think "because they work for the government" is the reason. All those nationalised euro train services still need unions!
It's just that we're all used to "Queen" and not King. They both work fine
Yeah the commonwealth as an institution wanted an elected head iirc but the Queen forced it
Queen did a little trolling.
Yes and no. I understand that laws are often worded in such a way that the palace won't have to object to them, and that the royal family have gotten exemptions from laws on environmental matters and on workplace diversity. It's not nation-defining stuff but all these little caveats and carve-outs aren't nothing either.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_letters
(okay, she didn't really, but only because everyone in the chain of command conspired to keep her out of the loop. It was her governor general though)

Queen Elizabeth II has been the head of state over a country that has done mass killings in Kenya, Ireland, and many other countries during her reign. It's not surprising that people feel strongly about her death.

Though I guess there must've been something for the US to back up Pakistan.
Unironically though I've never heard the "India was bad for being 3rd world" take before. I'm sure there's some hardcore cold warriors out there but I don't think it's a popular opinion.
Damn can't believe the major power of the day screwed India over. I'm sure that's never happened before.
Not to defend Putin, but I feel like this is a bad take. The sentiment must've been already there for them to stir it up, and in the scheme of things 300mil isn't that much. Saying it's all Russia's fault is an attempt to pretend that real problems don't exist
Visa are right here.
UK is probably a lost cause still but we can hope
It'll be interesting who goes republican now the Queen's dead. Australia is basically a given but will Canada? Who else?
Plus having a king is just more cringe than having a queen in general.
Not entirely correct. The monarchy got a lot of support based on the Queen as a persona. Nobody likes Charles so the reality of the Monarchy has fundementally changed even though the rules are all the same
You're absolutely right. However the Queen, as an idea rather than a person, embodied the very idea of the UK in a way. And now she's dead. It's understandable, albeit very stupid (and also very funny) that a certain subset of the population that was very invested in the concept of the UK has gone insane.
Because we're not the aristocracy
Maybe but have you considered that an old lady died (not of cancer) and that's far more important?
They need to set up a little nominally independent exclave in Krakow to complete the look
Yeah I remember that. With a 3 way partition I guess J&K truly is the modern Poland, lol.
J&K being Jammu and Kashmir? I always forget China goes that far west. There is an independent Tibet in my head even if there isn't one in reality.
Oh right yeah
Even if an actual war there is logistically impossible afaik there's still an expectation which way you'll fall.
Yeah but the problem is that if any capitalist does get blown up it'll be because of Q and not because they're a capitalist.

Going off Wikipedia that seems extremely fair to call her a fascist
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgia_Meloni
"Huh that's one fascist ass party name"
> Meloni served as Minister of Youth in Silvio Berlusconi's fourth government (2008–2011) and was president of Young Action first and then of Young Italy, the youth sections of National Alliance (successor of the neo-fascist party Italian Social Movement) and The People of Freedom, respectively
Not cypher but I heard the right are doing well.
Tbh I'll be glad when she's in the ground in a few minutes. This past week has inflicted severe psychic damage upon me, seeing the true derangement of the British psyche.
She's still dead

Portugal is quite a lot to do with the UK actually. Longest ongoing mutual defence treaty in the world afaik (1347)
It's called an Imperial propaganda machine. They're quite useful if you happen to be an empire that wants to maintain legitimacy.
She was basically deified by the media in life, so it's kinda like god's died.
Ah it's fine, that happens as the body decomposes. It's part of where the vampire and zombie myths come from, I believe.
📖 🛳️
She's already Andrew's mummy though
I think my source for that rumour is Republic's podcast (which is surprisingly good btw) but it could've been elsewhere
Actually I think we have evidence of that too. I'm pretty sure I remember someone saying that there's a really intense pressure in Westminster to not pass laws that the royal family wouldn't sign because that'd open a massive constitutional crisis.
We know they're involved in the decision making process though! Charles made sure that he got all cabinet correspondence during the Blair years, which is something that not even the whole cabinet got, and they've carved out exemptions in equality and environemental laws for themselves as they please. We know that she was at least informed of the governor general's plan in Australia because they have the damn letters.
I'd probably be indifferent too but seeing all the hysteria around the death has pushed me the other way and made me glad she's dead.
Yeah
idk maybe i've been radicalised too far off the deep end in the past couple of years.
She was the head of state of a genocidal regime, and she had power over all the governments that did genocide beneath her. There is zero chance that she did not know what was happening in Kenya, Malaysia, Ireland and the least she could've done is spoken out. However she chose to condone it, to approve of it. I honestly fail to see how a party could be going too far. Like, it'd maybe be a bit edgy to burn portraits or an effigy if you're a middle class white suburban American, but anything less than that.
She was a racist, homphobic, imperialist, nasty person who the world is better off without.
Obviously this is (to a degree) me reinforcing that a person I already didn't like was in fact a bad person, and not my primary reason for disliking the royals, but she wasn't the innocent old lady that The Palace would like people to remember her as.
She has done plenty to deserve shit since then too. Like I learned recently that she knighted a guy known as "the butcher of bahrain" into the order of the bath, which is the group of knights the royals get to choose personally, the gov't can't be blamed for that one.
What the fuck are you, a fucking commie, HOW DARE YOU question the rightous outpouring of grief at this tragic universe-defining moment??????3?
It's probably worth mentioning that the only way to become a lich in D&D is to commit attrocities so vile that nobody even dares write them down/talk about them.

It's worth noting that Phylacteries irl are apparently a Jewish thing that a religious man wears on their head. It's a small box with a bit of scripture in it. D&D cannot stop being problematic.
Mountbatten was her uncle iirc. Or the Pedo Regent of the Raj was anyway, and I think he's the famous Mountbatten

I'm not really talking to too many anarchists right now, but don't they also talk about the (modern) Zapatistas? That seems like a relevant case study to me
Marx notably did not give any ideas on what a communist society would look like afaik.
That's different, I meant referring to someone like the Louis the Sun King or Tsar Nicholas as a communist. Monarcho-Socialism is a joke (based on how the working class and monarchy have sometimes aligned against the bourgeoise.)
Actually that's 100% been said before.
Absolutist Monarchs are communism <:naruhodo:680978973697769514>
That probably is her personal Facebook, I don't think you can do alts on there?
I just picked up on the fact that she's using the love live pic and talking about defending traditional family values. How many gay doujins/fanarts of LL are there? There's got to be thousands.
Yeah that is random, if she was Irish she'd be ginger

What I'm trying to say is that they were a product of their time and place and idk that you'll necessarily get anything that useful from them, unless you want to be one of those people who are extremely invested in the Russian revolution and civil war.
Are the Mensheviks even that relevant anywhere in the modern context? What I understand of them is that they wanted to side with the Liberal Duma (Parliament), and develop industrial capitalism so that there could be an actual proletariat base in Russia outside of 3 cities. I don't think there's a similar context anywhere in the world right now, and if there is then I think Maoism would probably be more popular than some Russian 1900s Social Democrats.

It makes sense in the context that meat dishes are all people know how to cook. I'd have no idea what to do with lentils that aren't pre-prepared tbh. I do agree fwiw, but as an intermediary the fake meat makes sense.
Uncle Ben's? I think referring to those as mexican/asian might count as a hate crime, lol.
Yeah but have you considered that vegetables are gay and for girls?
I do have to admit that it's weird that you get people ideologically opposed to eating vegetarian meals here. You'll get (especially men) who insist it's impossible for them to eat a meal that doesn't have meat in it. Not sure if that's just a Bri'ish thing though. Which is kinda ironic as iirc we have the largest proportion of vegetarians in europe.

I don't think any union has ever had the ability to take on the extra work of actually governing a place though. Unless there was some weird moment in a small part of Russia during the civil war.
I think that's a bad argument. If it was that bad it'd probably make sense to topple them, from a certain perspective
[citation needed] also no, the USSR was not good, it was an imperialist superpower. However, claiming that it was much worse than it's capitalist contemporaries is probably also not true. Look at how the UK treated its colonies (especially the non-white ones) for comparison.
As I understand it, Italy was the only coloniser that tried, which I find a little ironic, considering how they went fascist and all.
Which part of Europe are you talking about specifically Broomy? We're not unaware that Poland/The Iron Curtain did not have it as good as Moscow did, and that Yugoslavia had a different experience still.
Europe would be a poor, religiously extreme, technological backwater on the edge of Eurasia.
Things went really really badly as I understand it? Loads of people lost their job and the average life expectancy collapsed.
Yes countries have different standards of living, and that's largely because the "nice" countries did a colonialism and stole from the "less nice" countries
That's certainly a large part, though I understand that the party has also made some bad decisions at various points.

It is also worth pointing out that Lycett himself is bi/pansexual (and is quite camp), he knows what it's like as much as anyone, so it's not like this is some straight person doing it.
Apparently yes according to this random website, though (for context) Lycett said in his original tweet that he didn't know if it was legal or not.

Yes that £10k would've been a nice thing, but not doing a nice thing is very different to doing reputation laundering for a homophobic regime. It's not like Beckham needed the money.
He did something dramatic to embarrass a football player who has previously marketed part of his image as being an ally. and by "has issues",  the penalty is death for muslims. If he hadn't followed through with the threat it'd've meant nothing.
slim shady
Not very attention grabbing though, is it?
It's  not wrong to say that the charities could use the money well.
Eh, we thought he had, and that is enough imo
https://twitter.com/joelycett/status/1594657948525289473
<@457268466429329429> apparently he didn't shred the money after all.
Technically that's how it is in the UK (though generally the police have tasers rather than firearms). Having said that i don't think it's necessarily a great idea for the US at the current time.
Yeah, try not to worry about not feeling how you "should" be feeling, these things take time to process and affect everyone differently.
Because it needs to pander to a range of people with polar opposite viewpoints if it wants to keep going as a global thing.
Also, yeah, this isn't surprising at all and nothing will come of these talks. They have the tournament, FIFA isn't going to call it off, they won't even threaten to, so there's no reason for Qatar to make concessions.
Did anyone get the "please subscribe to us" pop-up with the "stick it to the man" comic? Seems ironic coming from the guardian.
Peterson hornyposting is a weird vibe but sure
I assume it's like the various bylaws in the UK where it's legal to shoot a Scotsman with a longbow in a certain car park in York (no it isn't).
As I understand it the actual age of majority in Japan is still 18 everywhere, it's just 14 on the books of some prefectures or something. (Or is it the other way around? I don't remember and it doesn't really matter)
On the plus side, with this happening at a Walmart, at least it probably wasn't a hate crime(?)
Nothing could've stopped this from happening says the only nation on earth where this happens, and where it happens multiple times a day.
If you actually are interested read *The Dawn of Everything* by David Graeber. He's an anthropologist who's done a lot of work on prefeudal societies and his work is very easy to read
Yeah but how much of that is due to child mortality and stillborns.
No it isn't!
That's largely not how that worked at all. Kings/rulers/leaders seem to have originated as a kind of play/joke, they just gathered power over time.
Yes, the cia are bad. More at 6.
Yeah it didn't go well for the rich who wouldn't give up their wealth. There were plenty of defecting aristos in the red army
Stalin's purges were like 20 years after the revolution, and it's not like paranoid crazy guys are unique to revolutionary governments (it just doesn't help). Not saying those 20 years were all sunshine and roses, but it's not as tied together as you think it is.
That's not actually universally true necessarily. Specific case study: the United Kingdom. Over a decade of stagnating pay, slashed public services and rising inflation means people are in fact worse off now than they were in 2010. This would be the case regardless of Brexit, but that hasn't helped. Admittedly, this country might be an outlier, but you can't just say things are only getting better.
What do you think that's going to look like other than academic work?????
That's not what a Soviet is afaik. A Soviet is like a factory committee, but one that also manages the wider politics/ the surrounding areas where the workers live. You're talking about the Supreme Soviet (the parliament of the Soviet Union)  I think?
I mean, look at COP27 or whatever the most recent one was. The richest countries didn't even bother showing up. I'm not advocating for a revolutionary war, but it's obviously going to take more than what we've been doing. Same goes for BLM, trans rights, etc.
Famines plural there were like 7 in a row.
I mean, you can say "within the peace framework" for stuff like strike action, even though that's sorta been rectroactively put into that framework

I'm not Irish myself but I understand that that's politics/not an entirely settled question, at least in part because Northern Ireland would be a massive financial drain and there'd potentially be trouble from Orange Order types.
Oh no
Yeah but wasn't Malcolm Turnbull also a longtime republican? He didn't deliver.
Now listen, Kier Starmer is a sensible centrist, which means that he'll reintroduce section 28 but he'll be sad about it.
The replies seem to imply that Ye claimed that Hitler invented the mic, or at least the modern mic, so this guy is saying "no, these cool people are the ones who invented it".
The guy sounds cool, you should read the linked article.
I think "this thing was created by Hitler" is an attribute of the art itself and that publically destroying it is also an act of art that says something.
I agree. I have to admit, knowing such a terrible person painted it does make me more critical of it. I'm thinking "okay, but why did he paint this, what was he trying to say with it?" and assuming motives (idolising traditionalism and hierarchy?). If it wasn't painted by such a monster I'd probably just think "it's a nice view they wanted to share".
Good luck, stay healthy and all that!
Plus it would be very strange generally to not acknowledge a domestic terrorism event.
If you want to put it in those terms: The attack on the substations was an attack on capital, and the capitalist conception of the state is that it is there to protect private property. The motive of the attack on capital isn't really relevant. Not to mention, you have a Liberal president right now, not a fascist one.
Has there been an official response to this from the State/Feds yet? Surely they'll have to do something about this before it escalates to someone re-enacting 9/11 to own the libs.
Yeah, the thing is it didn't use to be that way, but as things have gone the US railroads have lost more and more staff, which means they've put their remaining staff into harsher conditions to maintain service, which has lost them more and more staff. It's a cycle and as part of that cycle sick leave is now verboeten.
A lot of people in the UK are choosing between heating and eating now it's getting colder. That was the case before the energy price spike though.
I think that's premature.
I'd also like to point out that the UK, a country that is aligned with the US, is also shitting the bed.
Syria has been constantly "shitting the bed" for over a decade at this point. The civil war is still ongoing.

We don't really want to get to a position where it's considered inherently suspicious to not carry your id on you. That's why I'm against it at least.
The argument against is that people are concerned the government will use the cards to more effectively discriminate against whover their current target is, be that jewish people or trans people or whoever.
If they do get in they probably will try to do id cards, it's the policy that ( Former Labour PM, and the current party's hero) Tony Blair wanted but couldn't ever get. The cynic in me says you can guarantee they won't be free though.
I'd say 2-3 months as a minimum but after 6 months for sure. Long enough that you're actually doing the job and aren't being trained anymore, basically.
ah okay.
maybe I am simply going insane then.
I might be going crazy but I don't think it said that originally. I am sure when they said that the linked post was "twitter makes it so "loli" doesn't return any search results."
As I understand it that's what the law prevents, they cannot do that now
It's still broadly good but nowhere near as good as they're pretending it is afaik.
Apparently how this actually works is that it forces states to recognise all marriages done in other states. So a Republican state could still ban interracial or gay marriage and if you're too poor to travel to get married then you're fucked. Especially if you're in the deep south or wherever and you have to cross multiple states to reach a blue state.
I think the accusation was that TikTok was radicalising zoomers into using a lot of casual homophobia and misogyny
I don't really know details, but I've heard that apparently tiktok specifically is real bad. Maybe there's a degree of "kids these days" to the complaints, but that Andrew Tate guy was on TikTok so maybe there's something to it.
Is this pre or post 2016? Because pre 2016 it's strange, post 2016 it's a whole other level.
Random "irish nationalist" who most likely isn't too into politics should be though. They're dumb but probably not hurting anyone
Some people certainly have opinions and it is unironically cool and good that a diversity of thought is allowed.
You might have a point, however these rules aren't going to be applied as written, they are going to be applied selectively to the benefit of Musk/his friends. So whilst yeah it's probably not a good thing to amplify the locations of vulnerable people (for example), that is not what this rule was intended to prevent nor is it how the rule will be used.
I saw something saying there was a provision made to allow them to continue to be jackasses. Even if there is no such provision this rule was always one that was going to be selectively enforced
Afaik yes it's just hypocritical
Musk did fire the entire accessibility team iirc
Maybe the entirety of the Brussels office that he fired could've told him about this.
I do feel like if this cousin got a yacht mysteriously then whatever your equivalent of the IRS should be saying "yo dude, where did you get this yacht from?" and that's cassus belli enough to investigate the cousin and gifter. You might miss the politician if they're savvy, but you should hopefully get the root of the problem
Realistically I don't think people can hide a massive cash bribe, they'll slip up eventually and spend more money then they should have, and that will get DB's secret ninjas or whoever on the case.
They did find out about that though, otherwise you wouldn't know about it. Said politician got in legal trouble for corruption and tax evasion right?(right?)

It's definitely a thing that the US has wikipedia pages for mass shootings per year whereas euro countries have wikipedia pages for every mass shooting ever.
obviously not every one of those is a Columbine (only 5 at schools and only 2 at places of worship) but it's still not good!
So over 2 a day actually I guess.
Wikipedia says 735 mass shooting events resulting in 762 deaths and 2902 wounded.

No?
What the article describes is a combination of people like this and an equivalent of your grandma retiring to Florida, as well as investors investing.
https://www.technomadfamily.com/tech-nomads/
One of the things that the article mentions is property investments, rich people everywhere, including rich Chinese people, invest wherever return is best, not just in "yellow peepo regions".
I don't think that's the case, what it sounds like to me is that the same kind of people moving there from the US and Europe: relatively wealthy young people whose job is to go on the computer. (Eg social media manager, influencer, etc) The number of those is relatively small.
I would imagine that at least some part of the bureaucracy did? This isn't exactly the Berlin wall coming down. On a different topic in the article: It's a bit funny that the social media site is called "little red book".
The scary thing is that he probably didn't.
In the US alone, I mean.
There will have been way more than one, there was more than one mass shooting a day last year afaik.
politicsposting in General, probably. This channel is a containment zone that people can leave.
You're not wrong about the general point about us all being dumb though
This one is imo not a particularly great example of a "communist disaster" as this kind of large scale geoengineering project (gone wrong) is the kind of thing that every state was trying to do in the 30s and 40s. It's not entirely dissimilar to British colonial policies of offering bounties for snakes (promoting an illegal snake breeding program that led to all the snakes being released when the bounty stopped).
You are not immune to propaganda etc etc.
Maybe it doesn't need pointing out, but imo it is usually worth acknowledging outside of commie spaces that shit was still *bad* and leaders made bad decisions that hurt a lot of people.

You hate to see the people who jump straight from "communism bad" to the other side "west bad and therefore every anti-western action good". It's surprisingly easy to do!

I hope I'm being too pessimistic, I hope I'm being too cynical. I don't think the powers that be are really that invested in democracy though.
Hollyrood was created in an attempt to curtail Scottish nationalism, now that it's done the opposite Westminster will be perfectly happy to take it away.
I can't help but be pessimistic. If Scotland tries to leave, in no matter how justifiable a circumstance:
> Westminster says no
> The supreme court says no.
Then what? Sturgeon isn't going to call on the army to enforce the border.
No because there's only one way this constitutional crisis will get resolved (the bad way, with Westminster saying "fuck you" and nobody doing anything about it). However, theoretically the UK could split up over this.

Seriously though, whilst mass purges are *impractical* (to say the least), I think it'd be good if there was a more general movement to have faith be a thing between a person and their gods/the cosmos/whatever, and less hierarchical. 

I should probably be explicit and say that my use of *impractical* was ironic understatement for "morally wrong and impossible to implement".

On another topic, some good news! It would be very funny if NI joined in on this (though they probably won't)
I know like the bakers union left, but Unite, Unison, and GMB are still backing him I think and those are the big backers afaik. Sharon Graham keeps threatening Unite's funding but afaik she hasn't pulled yet and the other two have right-wing leadership so won't.

Oh no, pis-tok. nothing good can come of that.
lol
Yes and no. What the goverment are trying to do is square the circle of NI being both UK and Ireland, Ireland being within the EU and UK obviously being without it, so it's not that they specifically want the border as much as they're trying to create some level of legal fiction and compromise so that there both is and is not a border. The backbenchers mentioned are part unironic unionist ultras, but also probably part opportunists looking to get concessions for their own agendas.

2d cake, if sufficiently well-drawn, can be exchanged for money, and money can be exchanged for goods and services. Therefore 2d cake could potentially be exchanged for multiple 3D cakes and must be strictly superior.

Have chibi mange finally completely distorted my image of the human body or do all those LL characters have really long legs? Not inhumanly or implausibly long, but long enough for it to be weird for them all to be so long.

Tbh, from what I know, i'm not really looking forward to when Railgun gets to  where index is. People trying to fight for their lives in the mysterious, malicious, and seemingly omnipotent Academy City is a more interesting story to me than all the grandiose shit in Index.
I read the wiki sometimes. :P
I am aware of the spoilers cypher.
Yeah magic seems way more powerful than science in index. That's one of the reasons i'm less interested in it.

No the Saten thing was definitely a fanfiction. I just think it might have been that particular one where I remember the queen being young.
An actually good fanfiction btw, iirc.
I remember a fanfiction where the queen was a young woman and the MC got smuggled into the UK in the middle of ww3 by the IRA. Might have been that one where Saten becomes god a million times over.
Unless that was just that one fanfiction.
Can't believe index made the queen of England into a loli or young woman or something.
Even though the gay spinoff already has a name (astral buddy), it can have an extra name.
Consider this though, we can save Q for Railgun Q(ueer), the gay spinoff.
Railgun U btw. I will unironically be a little disappointed if it isn't.
Why would it be Q? Q comes earlier in the alphabet than S, that would be confusing!

Do you know if you can get the lns without the pictures? The thing that put me off was a picture of L.O in the whatever novel (might have actually been the first N.T novel) I got. I REALLY do not want that kind of thing in my possession.
Touman 🦸‍♂️
I should probably give the lns another try.
Should have kept it to hinting <:peepoignore:588913619987726336> . On a scale of like Gunha to Kihara how much do you think I wouldn't like them?
6 never existing was funny
I'm actually a little disappointed about that last bit of trivia cypher
Does Kakine even have friends? I have only seen him in his oneshot mango and all he had were two minions and discount L.O.
Which one is ITEM again? I get them and GROUP confused.
<:YellowDogSaysPerhaps:737405481856925846>
She is ||on the dark side. Dark side bad||
Hmm yes. ||Lazer lady bad||
Frenda? More like ||dead||
You should watch Love Lab and Hibike Euphonium back to back then hanabi.
Also it's pretty much the opposite of the truth. There's never any confirmed relationships beyond crushes.
How have you not watched Yuru Yuri yet? It's like THE cgdct show. If you watch it you don't need to watch any others. <:AkariHappy:393820745400057866>
En anglais sil vous plais? The only word I recognise there is "Katta" 🐱
Honestly they should have just gotten Kaos to draw a 4koma about animals in the first place. People love cute fluffy animals doing SOL shit.
Apparently it's treated like a couple's holiday over there, or so I've heard. Also they eat KFC or something?
5 is the best face regardless.
No u again
Sometimes it's like that 😔
You want another spoiler? ||They don't shut up about the chicken for a long time, I think the author thought it was the funniest joke in the world||
Uhhh... Spoilers. Whoops.
Are they still talking about the divine cock in that manga?
It is a good mango. It has a very good |||GUTS!!!!|| fight in it,
astralbuddy can be number 2
I will fight you over this idolaccel is the best part of raildex <:blobcatknife:602701510014533652>
An accel spin off would probably work much better as a comedy imo. This is why  idolaccel is the best part of the raildexverse
Accelerator is bad because he's never in his own manga. Also bunny girl vore.
I can't wait for Saten's dad to turn up and it turns out he's one of those ||natural esper people|| with super detective powers and that's why she's always chasing conspiracy theories.
If you want proof that you need to be fucked in the head to enter Academy City then remember that they let Misaka's mom in and she spends all her time drunk and flirting with people her daughter's age.
though i think you told me most of it and then i looked up the rest on the wiki
<:YesMan:740547635819315201>
Implying i have room in my head for anything to do with Index the character.
I'm sorry cypher i don't speek weeb
By what metric though? ||Kinda cringe for #6 to assume his own morality system was absolute||
Nice scribble
no because #6 is boring now that they actually exist
Yes. That was the joke.
The spoiler would be a heavy object?
Gunha's Rambo training montage when?
Tbf, ||the guy who beat him up basically said that Gunha just needs more guts to beat him|| he could come back. It'd be neat if the power ranking of the #5s got shaken up at some point
Don't do my boy like this
He will come back with more guts than ever before <:pepehands:566510801863573533>
I don't think there is a last chapter, it's ongoing, no?
mirrors go brrr right back
cypher is horny on main for the chinese cartoon
Mugino deserves disrespect tbh. Laserbeam woman is literally just worse railgun. Snoozefest/10.
blonde girl from mugino's gang who mugino murks
more like ||dead/nda||
But she's best girl in the manga and that's what matters 😤
I can see a lot of people not liking sabagebu for Urara ||she do be pretty rapey||. I liked it though. They did a good job of making the MC a horrible person and still a little bit likeable.
"Just don't watch naruto if you don't want your time watched to be distorted" is what i was going to say, but mine is almost the same length as lank's, with about 1/4 of as many anime watched
Probably for the best tbh. How many people would reject it because "eww boys kissing"? Idk, maybe i have an unfairly low opinion of otaku and weebs.
No for hibike
The music's supposed to be pretty good, afaik. Is that a good enough reason?
Does Beserk count as one of those long running series if the author's playing idolmaster rather than authoring new chapters?
Maybe they just really like yellow haired ninjas?
This is an official shill post btw
Why read it though, when you could read something good like this?
https://mangadex.org/title/21562/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto
Boule is the kind of person who's still salty Naruto didn't get with Sasuke.
<:HornyPatrol:588551090161844235>
the spin-off's gay, i think?
the only good part of sakura trick was this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha54G-_K1Fw
Why are they all fat children though, hanabi?
I can tell you what's a better anime than both ayaya. It's||symphogear||
What kind of show *are* you looking for?
This is not a suggestion <:yourlasthonk:634272610263498766>
Also, this isn't fantasy but it's good so you should read it anyway.
https://anilist.co/manga/99022/The-Apothecary-Diaries/
Idk about that, but there's one that's finished anyway and that's what's important.
The manga's complete too, which is a bonus.
I take it you've read this?
https://anilist.co/anime/14833/Maoyuu-Maou-Yuusha
So if you were hanging off a cliff and someone grabbed your hand to prevent you from falling you'd say "tiramisu"? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
That tiramasu looks kinda funky. Not sure if that's because it retained its shape after being cut though.
What makes her so good?
That's an odd way to spell Totsuka, Millh.
They are ALL interesting and good. I broke out the "actual good taste" just this once.
Yeah the maoyuu maou yuusha would be good then if you haven't already read it. Also read the other two too <:GrinchInAMaskWithAGun:582712584969388041>
~~perhaps it would have been a good idea to ask what you liked about Frieren before making suggestions.~~
Also also, capes aren't really fantasy either, but SHY is cute so it's all good <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740> 
https://anilist.co/manga/110909/SHY/
What is that thing? The blue thing with the white ball
You picked the colour based on your favourite gear and not just the colour you liked the best?
It was so good, and it became so, so bad <:NanoPensive:695154593239269436>
I thought SnS was Shoukugeki no Souma (aka food wars). <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
No, it goes to shit hanabi. Not as much as the manga, but still.
The turtle thing is cute
But can he be progressive enough to include a non-rapey villain?
The madman.
Railgun Quattro Formaggio
You can't have STFV. No.
Kamachi isn't going to drop Railgun, it's got to be at least, if not even more profitable than Index
I don't know what you mean by "everyone", I've never seen anyone else refer to it as Railgun U.
Railgun begins with an R
Then there's Railgun S
Then there's Railgun T
Then there will be Railgun U
RSTU, it's  the alphabet.
We're on chapter 127 and coming to the end of the prison break arc now (which started in chapter 98, to be clear)
71-97 according to the wiki
*Idol Accelerator* has Misaka and as that is the single best thing Raildex ever made so it will hopefully get adapted one day <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Not much Misaka, but it has NotHorny!Kuroko which is just as good, if not better.
It is good, much better than Accelerator.
aka swimsuit & drills girl from the start of T
It's a spinoff, focusing on Junko, Misaki's top subordinate, Ash.
and hopefully in the meantime we could maybe get Astral Buddy?
Railgun's like mega popular. There WILL be a Railgun U.
It's not over, it's just "until next time" <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
<:smugworst:598321185918287872>
Misaka is a horrible person.
Oh so you're just horny for worst. right
That's probably not going to happen. Harem Protag mcs have to stay young to stay relatable to the zoomers.
Granted. Touma is a grandpa now.
Fun Fact: Trump is a villain in Pumpkin Night (Don't read Pumpkin Night)
If it wasn't the previous pic, is this the spoiler then?
Spoiler from Railgun version of that arc.
Yeah i know that manga ended. I'm proposing a new and better one 😤 .
Accel manga but he's just using his powers to cheat at children's games ||in prison|| when? Basically Kakeguri but accelerator.
We had an entire Accelerator manga without Accelerator. We can have a Railgun arc with just Kuroko, Uiharu, and Saten 😤
There was the poison dude. Idk if he did poison in the actual SAO, but he did it in Abridged.
Well yeah that makes sense. One of them has a "no" in their name and the other doesn't. Why would we confuse them?
Now she's a Touhou. Touhou Ultra Beast.
rude :/
Why does that person look like an ultra beast? can't we forget SuMo ever happened?
<:satenwhy:715203152554754198>
Saten tho
So if Accel is the ||chairman|| now, does that mean he's Nelson Mandela?
<:OhICantSee1:393822216178892801>
because he's in a prison and he'd starve if he was left alone?
He was posting 😂 because he thought the episode was funny. wym, firezero?
Was it cool and good?
That's probably cool and good.
So speaking of something else anime. SAO abridged ep 15 apparently released today.
2 should be able to, because dark matter BS. How is meltdowner rated higher than mental out then? She's already discount Railgun, now you're saying she's an even bigger discount?
Surely Meltdowner and 2 can too?
If mental out got loose ||it'd probably be a dragon or some shit and then touma would come along and punch it and save the day <:isleep:581295203219144752> ||
Even if Astral Buddy isn't her best appearance as you say, it's definitely her gayest.
what about akarin though? <:AkariHappy:393820745400057866>
lol x series
I'd typically agree FZ, but Cypher's a boomer so he can be forgiven <:umu:393825154444034069>
Nobody's told him that "lol" doesn't mean "lots of love" yet.
You might not like them Cypher, but you can't just go around referring to someone as "that ho". It's rude!
every day feels like a deja vu because every day you have been in this place before. Every day higher on the street.
Did the witch get burned?
Whomst?
Subtlety is overrated. sometimes.
All Stars, as in *Sonic and Sega All-stars racing*?
Incest more like eww gross
Rem is Voldemort?
But you can support it illegally
take a day off to read them all.
<:YuukoPensive:695154587736342578>
I'll get it off the cat site then.
I didn't know this existed! What platform/site?
Oh hey is this *the other* slime isekai?
<a:NoU:588551088542711808>
Because SOL romance in general is "standard"?
I guess it just burns a bit slow for me <:AkariShrug:393820744829763605> plus I read like two different adaptions so the second time through I'm like "I have been here already, get to somewhere new!"
Adachi and Shimamura(manga/ln spoilers) ||goes nowhere unless you read the ln or whatever. Adachi is definitely gay, but her one-sided thirst is getting kinda stale in the manga, and Shimamura is only just starting to catch on that Adachi likes her||
Is it about the batman character?
https://mangadex.org/title/19436/ouji-sama-nante-iranai
Maybe i'm just super late on this bandwagon, but this is a super good (~~Ongoing!~~ complete? AND with a post-confession!) romance manga. I hope we see more of the boys school's school council, they're a cute pair.
Yeah Ash. I really like it! Only thing is ||the arranged marriage bits|| were a bit squicky for me. I get why the characters went for them but it still left my individualistic ass feeling kinda dirty. (spoiler for granny's story)
I am reading Magical Revolution. It's nice that the MC is assertively "no, I am gay" without being a horny stereotype. (well, maybe she's a bit horny, but she can be serious too). Maybe i should clarify a bit? I don't think she's necessarily a great example of a portrayal of a  queer character, but it's nice that she's comfortable with/confident in her identity rather than being yet another "omg can i really fall in love with someone of the same sex" type.
Oh i read the web novel for that for a bit, Fenny. 'Twas good.
I lost track of that one at some point but it was in an ending-ish place anyway so 🤷
The one where she's isekai'd into the world with only girls?
It was a better manga for the drama tbh. Was worth.
fuck how does formatting work? Why was that so hard?
Come on, it's not the kind of manga where bad things actually happen. *Mentally blocks out those ||6 months|| of Bloom into You  ||playing with my heartstrings||*
Oh dear the latest two chapters kinda give the feel like shit's about to go down in that manga <:notlikethis:581295203361619978>
"Kizuna Ranger" is only returning a song in Google so I think it's just a case of "generic ranger pls don't sue us"
Don't thank me too much, I'm just passing on something that got shared in another server yesterday <:mischieve:586208451630202936>
The sentai fans will probably get a kick out of this
https://lhtranslation.net/read-the-red-ranger-becomes-an-adventurer-in-another-world-chapter-1.html
*Looking up to magical girls* is v.horny but also pretty good if you're not already reading it, Ash
Is it even 20? It doesn't feel very long.
You say it's a slow burn, but in about 20 chapters it goes ||from a kiss to getting married||
No this is best vampire.
I know who the best vampire in manga is but idk about any anime vampires
I guess Ms. gura's spent a lot of time looking up animal mating rituals then because on incognito the top results for harem were the Islamic definition besides like, 2, pointing to the anime definition.
"what is a harem" returns similar results
Where did she get the animal definition from?
Personally I don't think it counts unless it looks like they're broken their neck to do the tilt
Yuru Yuri> Yuri Yuri tbh.
Actually it looks a bit like the "dead mom" haircut
isn't that just a normal pontrail with a weird headband?
Don't worry the link is 100% not shady <a:winku:498891469285883922>
https://blitzfansub.com/category/gokushufudo/
I love this so much. It is literally perfect. I do not know how the anime is going to top this. (live action gokushufudou)
Not if you sold off the old one to pay for her...
posting 1/4 of the bee movie script but everytime the word "bee" comes up it's replaced with 1/4 of the bee movie script
"theoretically"
I'm pretty sure the staff wouldn't be happy if you did
Normally you just end up pinging a person called "everyone" i didn't know that it was like this when no such person exists
you actually did it, the absolute madman. It's not actually on though, i hope
hey out of those 4K there's like 3900 who have probably never said anything. They could all speak spanish fluently, for all we know!
How am i supposed to know who can speak spanish and who cannot? It's not like i stalk anyone ~~from this server~~
<https://mangadex.org/title/16817/sakura-nadeshiko>
I assume it's this
oh wow that was a million years ago <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Also what's up with this cursed scanlation group that did one chapter in english?
I hope you can read spanish then nikosuba
People have been shilling assault lily super hard in here so it's probably enjoyable at least
It has a cute french person and what more could an anime possibly need?
Idunno, who do you think they are?
Obviously Symphogear ||They get isekai'd to the treasury||.
Unironically probably kumabear, mainly because i like the wn.
If he was taking too long his stuff wouldn't get published
<:this:414137928672083968> If we're doing Real Talk ™️ though, no.  He has no obligation to output anything more if he doesn't want to. Similarly, the magazine that publishes Beserk doesn't have to keep to keep him on their register. However, they do keep publishing his stuff, so the time he takes is worth the money to them.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I swear half the people on novel updates post shit fresh outta google
Length isn't so much of a problem next to "does this give me a migraine or has the poster attempted to do some level of editing on the MTL?"
||Jade of "Jade's party".|| A recurring side character
I reread it recently, it's surprising how early ||"Jade/Jeid"|| shows up.
Yeah, and the translation is super scuffed like all translated wns, and there's the obsession with eating japanese food that permeates every isekai. Still kinda fun though, especially all the author's notes about how they have no idea what they're doing.
He wants you to tl a VN, I think?
You don't need to tl a page, just use Google to translate the page and then edit the output into coherent sentences. That's all we want
What would you consider a "decent" harem?
It is a particularly bad example of a harem though. MC is part of that, but so is the fact that all the girls are into him because... (?)
Did she just lose in a video game? Because she sure looks tilted.
Rosario Vampire is a magical girl show, it has a transformation sequence, so where does it fit on this chart?
There's no reason to assume it won't work out.
It's ||setting up more drama in that last panel though||. Seriously, how does this not have a drama tag?
UTOOFREOTOUI
What is this capitalisation?
They better reference the soup store in this.
It's a bit, they've disappeared like the character in their pfp.
Looks like a very light blonde to me
if not it probably wasn't.
Did they advocate for circumcision in the episode?
Yeah but it has Yuru Camp S2 so its pog. admittedly the OP isn't as much of a banger as Shiny Days but it's still pretty good.
All you need is a 3d printer and a cad program. Probably idk
Hey it's the bartender dude from SAO, what's he doing in this?
that's what they all say
Whilst not inaccurate, referring to Rance as "a RPG" is... one way to put it.
Same, i thought Yuru Camp aired on Saturdays but apparently it's today?
I'm a little worried that she'll get sidelined in her own manga, like accelerator did, and that this'll end up as worse Astral Buddy tbh. Let's be optimistic though!
i wonder what kind of antagonists there will be?  A friend joked that maybe it will be an out-of-order elevator.
Toaru Kagaku no Railgun Manga Editor Kentarou Ogino stated that he plans on working on Toaru Kagaku no Mental Out to be serialized and hopefully release in 2021 (in-production)

https://twitter.com/gouranga_/status/1344629047687409665?s=19
No mental out manga
Yo <@!87512939107450880> you hear that they're doing a Mental Out manga? I am somewhat hyped.
Ur a trope
Wait maybe you can 🤔

***TOURNAMENT ARC***?
https://mangadex.org/chapter/1203250/1
You mean Tachi? Something fucky is going on with it right now, i think
lemme grab the link i used
I just read it on Mangadex
New Frieren chapter is very good as always! ||I can only see half the sky|| <:fufufu:586742813828317184>
The first arc was good but I'm not really feeling the ||infinite Rei Taylors and the baddie is a computer or something|| direction the series took. I think that's a general problem with LNs though. They can't stop until they crash.
what does this mean?
You were my only hope Cypher-Wan Kenobi. The guy I normally talk to is asleep <:mikosleep:606555854350581831>
<:sadecat:582712622097498113>
Btw <@87512939107450880>. Completely different topic. Railgun latest chapter. You read it yet?
Bad news for IFTV fans

I guess *Looking up to Magical Girls* is continuing on dynasty until further notice. How convenient.
I don't think i've seen a 51% before. Just how bad is this?
Masaki no Pan has an anime?
for the purpose of this definition "booba" can be male bodies too
I'm not sure i agree that's applicable. Ecchi, to me, means "halfbaked porn watered down [to make it more acceptable] so we can put it on TV". Is there actually such a thing as an ecchi show that handles sex in a way other than "omg hot booba"?
Good point. I'm not really sure what the point of the Ragyu ||bath scene/torture scene|| were though. They was just uncomfortable incestuous ||rape||.
No, what I was asking for was a series where sex/nudity isn't just there for fanservice.

What would you call Mewtwo if you were in a room with it and it was destroying the world then?
Charizard got a charizard gf and to live in a valley with his bros. It was Pigeot that just got dumped in the middle of nowhere
we can be
No clue. He was permanently 10 and then I heard he got aged up because they're retiring him.
Did Hilda even ever appear in the anime (as that's what we're talking about)? I thought Ash had someone else with him for  BW?
https://www.amazon.com/Pokemon-Diamond-Adventure-Graphic-Volumes/dp/B0051DZG4G
As an alternative (not-adventures) pokemon manga, this DP one is also good.
It really is a fun manga series though. Have you read Sun/Moon? I never got around to reading them because BW2 was poo-poo, so I want to know if they're worth reading
blocked <:peepoignore:588913619987726336>
You are wrong! Yellow is my favourite, because the pacifist route is cool! Also she has a fishing rod!
NO!
The camera shot is simply looking at the moon from the other side.
This is totally the canon reason the moon has a hole in it btw
I forgot Restaurant to Another World tool place in the Symphogear world
You can read books with other people,
How could you get that thing in a narrow/low roof space though? or are you just saying "rule of cool, the zombies aren't allowed inside buildings?
I guess maybe Fallout-style power armour might work, but that's not mecha, is it?
Unless the zombies are giant like titans I think a mecha is probably the worst possible tool to fight them with. How would that even work? Just build a wall, it'll be cheaper and more effective!
Slavery is bad <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
The mecha isn't that big a part of the story, is it? he uses it to fight the love interests in that one tourney then that's basically it, right?
There's probably enough content rn, right?
Assuming for a sec that Frieren is popular enough to get an anime, when do we think it might get one?
Actually it might have been the so who wrote that one. It has been years
I wanna say they're Filipino? I think I remember it from the SOL they did about them and their SO.
Apologies to Voy and Ten for probable mistranslation
Regardless it's on that one Korean app so manhwa is probably fine
Malay gets "Komiks" apparently.
Google tells me that "comic" in Indonesian is "pelawak"
Idk that SEA gets its own names, I haven't heard them if they do.
W is Korean, U is Chinese
The girls look right but none of the images I can find have those two guys
Looks like it could be "konbini kareshi", according to Yandex
Yeah the damn Lancastrians should've just submitted to the obviously superior county.
That is one intimidating flamingo
He just wants to rewrite 16.5 out of existence
Hopefully progressive takes some inspiration from the abridged series and has Asuna kill that guy
GGO was pretty fun to watch with friends, ||but of course they couldn't escape putting the totally necessary rapey villain at the end||
I don't see how it could possibly fix the biggest issue with SAO though, which is all the rapey villains. Especially ||Mr. Rapey Elf Man from the second arc||
iirc from third hand info,  progressive is supposed to be better than the original
Nah it's just
1.LO does thing whilst Accelerator is in hospital
2. Fallout happens
3. 20 chapters later the titular character shows up for like a chapter
4. he gets sent back to hospital
Repeat
No you're not, it wasn't a good arc. Oh I guess there's also paper rabbit girl also (?) from accelerator
Just to be clear, I am talking about the ||bunnygirl vore cruiseship|| from Accelerator. Did they do anything else spooky?
This cover is extremely concerning considering what happened the Raildexverse used rabbits.
That's illegal. Are you reading "Tamen de Gushi"? It got a bit of that before getting hit by the Chinese government. It still occasionally puts out chapters though
I thought you meant this until you specified. This is also good, though it doesn't really go post-relationship
https://myanimelist.net/manga/85802/Ookami_Shounen_wa_Kyou_mo_Uso_wo_Kasaneru
Hello? Yagakimi exists? Sure it's only half the story but that wasn't in your specifications.
Also is it just me or does the ad looks super grainy even on HQ?
Yeah but somehow that one looks less weird, maybe because they're moving (spinning) at least, whereas in this ad they're all just still except they're flying
There is something very funny about all these people flying through the air whilst the central lady is T-posing
I feel like this is still no guarantee that they won't pull a "guys suck but <<love interest>> is special".
What is that in Norwegian krone though?
Simply don't pay attention to who is in what and it won't bother you.
Wall-E with significantly more drifting
so true oomfie
Kinda cringe. Manga is obviously the superior artform. Easy to consume unlike light novels, and quicker to consume than anime.
Pokemon Masters EX. The website was called "pokemonmastersex" or something like that, quite unfortunately.
Tbf Faraway Paladin is an isekai and it's good, or at least the manga is, haven't watched it.
<:angery:230967607862362112>
Or watch it and then pick up the manga where it leaves off
and by something actually good I specifically mean Yagakimi.
Drop whatever crap you are reading right now and read something actually good GDI
Yagakimi is unironically my #1 for yuri manga, cannot think of one I liked more, and it's probably the only one I'd recommend under the "romance" genre generally rather than specifically "yuri".
Wtf, tell me you've read it at least and you just haven't seen it?
having said that, a translation from something as big as Billibbilli probably means this goes nowhere, as the state must approve of it
A scanlator used to do it, the latest load looks to be official because it has billibilli's name attached to it
That's why I'm not sure if I've read this particular one or not
There's like 10 manhuas called lily, Lank.
I really wish mangadex embeds would show the picture in a thumbnail
https://mangadex.org/title/19daf6ef-6d95-46e5-9e1a-f4e5b655902f/lily
I have the feeling i've read this before, but I remember literally nothing so it's all cool
No I am reading a manhua instead. It is still yuri though.
I do not remember that happening at all, so I thought it must be a new chapter.
I have to admit i was a bit suspicious of that random dude Konatsu reaches out to in the last chapter though. Felt like it was the author going "NOT GAY, NOT GAY, NOT GAY", even if it was probably intended to just show her being able to reach out to people.
I kinda feel like the ending is stronger for them not hooking up though. They could've and that'd've been cool, whatever, but them growing and no longer needing each other felt more interesting to me.
Yeah it's good.
Where did you get this? I don't see an update on dynasty. (I mean, i will wait for dynasty anyway but I wanna know)
It's just what they do.
But all yuri involves aquariums. It is a scientific fact that if there is a yuri manga with multiple arcs they will go to the aquarium.
https://dynasty-scans.com/images/15346
speaking of Sayaka*Yuu, this is still a good image.
I want a S2 but yeah, they'd probably never sign off on one without something to sell
The MC has the same face as Yuu and his mom is a harem protagonist.
Yeah I think it's really unlikely to get a S2 announcement at this point unfortunately, all the Sayaka novels are done so there should be nothing more happening in that world. Looks like the mangaka's next work has only been translated to Chinese so far.
https://mangadex.org/title/248807b9-f596-4f87-820c-407b175fe8cc/kami-sama-ga-machigaeru
Touko deserves it for those 6 months of pain. Plus you cannot look at Haru and say that Sayaka is not into Yuu. That girl is a carbon copy.
I am right and you know it, Lank
<:gunniime:601268911576449024>
All you need to know going into it is that Yuu*Sayaka is the true OTP. <:fufufu:586742813828317184>
I like Yagakimi because it feels decently done as its own thing, it doesn't feel like it's *relying* on being yuri to sell, if you get what I mean.
I have no real interest in either of those tbh <:AkariShrug:393820744829763605> Each to their own.
Tbh I associate Schumacher with F1 before I associate him with Germany. Racetracks are like a whole other world separate from mortal geography.
Oh and I guess if you're counting Austrians then Arnie would be ahead too
I feel like he must be at least third, behind Einstein but probably ahead of Marx.
So "Erased" and "Your Name" are isekai?
I feel like the ||"don't fall in love with me"|| makes that not count at all, but yes, there definitely are plenty of yuri manga that get ||a confession||. There's also a lot that are "bait" though
One advantage BL has over yuri is that it actually goes somewhere. You would not be getting this in CH13 of a GL manga. Or a lot of het, for that matter.
<:naruhodo:722371916337381377>
So this is a situation in which you use cap rather than no cap?
I don't understand these zoomerisms
Holy Grail of Eris is good yeah. I like how the world feels a bit menacing, unlike most villainess stuff where the world generally feels peaceful and safe.
It's cute though, or at least the first couple of chapters are. Haven't caught up on the manga yet
Yes. https://anilist.co/anime/126288/Sasaki-to-Miyano
Are you reading "please bully me, miss villainess"? the MC of that is also quite wholesome, even if it's limited a bit by the plot.
Hopefully the anime will cover the whole thing <:yuibless:582737307367505943>
https://mangadex.org/title/b603c211-d1f9-4145-a2ac-04dcd5f06329/sasaki-and-miyano
Finally finished reading this, v.cute, would reccomend
Is it an actual phone number or is it a LINE address or something?
You're most likely thinking of "I'm in love with the villainess". This is a different one.
Saint Germain, like the football team
wow that's dark
So you're saying the dude slays the friends he made along the way?
Did they slay the demon yet?
Main two girls are stepsisters or something, but there's a friend who you could probably read as having a crush on her childhood friend if you want to.
Exactly that.
You were looking for yuri stuff earlier, right? Slow Loop, starting on Jan 7, will probably have a bit of bait. About as much as something like Yuru Camp probably, but idk how thirsty/desperate you're feeling.
<a:baka:528697770387701763>
Actually, how the fuck did we pick up Japanese terms back when we were all first getting into weebshit? I genuinely don't remember what is was like to not know what a Tsundere was.
You can probably say equally confusing things in english, I purposefully went for stuffing my fictional title with buzzwords to make it hard to understand.
I'm going to need an actual chinese speaker to tell me if you can use "white lotus" to mean someone who is actually innocent, or whether it is only someone who shows those characteristics but who is evil inside. If they are all evil then what is a black lotus?
Wait maybe i didn't get it wrong? I'm confused. What I was going for was `a rich/spoiled person`  who wants to be `a pure/innocent/"perfect girl"` type of person for `a poor/lazy/ unsucessful person`
Never mind, i got the term white lotus wrong. I need to look up what the unironic version of that is.
"The green tea wants to be the salted fish's white lotus"
No I will content that a lot of it is very bad actually. In the typical transmigration both the protagonist and the love interest will be either billionaire celebrities/actors or billionaire students at prestigious universities. It's a different kind of fanservice to JP shit, but it's no better.
oh god yes. But a lot of everything on novelupdates is hot trash, even amongst the highly rated stuff.
Strictly speaking it's Chinese Transmigration which doesn't usually have the same tropes as Japanese Isekai.
To give a bit of balance though: it is one of those isekais that forgets it's an isekai.
https://jiulianlian.wordpress.com/falling-in-love-with-tsundere-villainess-after-transmigrating/
random yuri wn that some people might be interested in.
What I found interesting about it is that these kids "only" have hundreds of dollars, which is practically middle class by China's standards for protagonists, and they're not incredibly smart either. Not really sure what the takeaway is from that, but it is something slightly different.

Also as something else that's rarer than it should be, neither of the protagonists were disowned by any family members when they came out.
I like how they just slip ABO in there like it's nothing. Lol.
There was another one?
The fish goes straight from a whole fish to fillets
Can't believe the CGDCT chickened out of showing the MC mutilating a fish 😔
Also funny because the alpha girl looks exactly how you'd expect an alpha to look like
I read that one just before I commented. It is horny as hell
How can that kind of relationship dynamic not be insanely horny, even if there isn't smut?
https://youtu.be/zhWWcWtAUoY
This video does a pretty good job at introducing the concept of Omegaverse, it is funny too.
Huh, the more you know.
To be specific, it's mostly stuff about gay men, with the target demographic of straight women. It's spread to het and apparently also gay women now?
Alpha/Beta/Omega. Do you know how there's that wrong understanding of how wolf societies work with alpha males/alpha females? It's that but people.
Man just wants to be Merlin, can't believe you're bodyshaming him for that.
You should look up how to do V/H/Xlookups and pivot tables at least. They are easy enough and add a decent amount of appeal to your CV.
<:naruhodo:680978973697769514>  I never got that far into the story.
(the one where the elf and the beastgirl want to have sex with a cat)
yet
That already exists, it's called mahouka
Also the koreans have access to a secret technology that the Japanese can't get as frequently: Coloured ink.
I forgot that existed. Surely it is dead by now?
You don't, it's crap. The idea is funnier than the wn itself
You'd been outflanked by Vending Machine Isekai before you even set out.

The hungry caterpillar is my favourite manhua <:uMu:586208440763023381>
I think the fact that's she's ripping the fish open when she's saying that is one hell of a blunt metaphor
One thing I hope with the fiancee is I hope it's her that gets the revenge and that it's something incredibly harmless like dropping a bucket of water on his head. That'd be much better than the MC going nuclear on him with fireballs or w/e
At least the sister is cool.
Yeah, I kinda wish it actually did something with the villainess bit though. The FMC is just a generic love interest instead.
It's such a hot mess of a premise, why does it kinda work?

Can't just call it Queensman, have to call it Queengsman
I think if anything it'd be Yandere's for me. They're either "isn't domestic violence funny?" or just psychopaths.
They're all women (except landlord) yes
Unlike Fate none of them are famous characters, they're all sorta mid-ranking nobodies.
"A Private Story on Third Street". It's a comedy about historical soldiers from around the world living in modern day Japan.
Good manga!
Miku because Gamagōri/Mako is at least worth acknowledging as a ship.
Iirc not only did coke not pull out, but the head of coke Germany hung up swastikas in the coke factory and joined the party.
That sure is a combo

You don't want some crunchyroll gaming? It'd mean you could watch "gamers" whilst being a gamer!
You can't make as many unique waifu designs from the church aesthetic alone, and you can always have a rogue clergyman/clergywoman cover that niche, so it's inevitable. Plus there's something to be said for challenging the idea of divine authority, when the show/manga/Ln bothers to do it.
But, but, have you considered? What if the demons/devils....were the good guys?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?

Okay i know I was shittalking "what if demons were the good guys" earlier, but can I live in the demon kingdom please?

Monogatori must have 6 movies

Very good even.
SpyxFamily has a broader appeal but both are good.
Wait, like 2 days ago.
There was a chapter like yesterday, what more do you want?
But yeah, read A Certain Scientific Railgun gaiden: Astral Buddy.
At least a third, it's probably closer to two.
Kuroko needs to chill out first though, and that'll never happen because her un-chillness is a solid third of her character
Kuroko is actually cool and good, just not when Misaka is in the picture
Explicit in the sense of obvious/explicitly stated rather than in the sense of horny.
The astralbuddy/mental out sidestories are pretty gay but yeah you aren't going to get anything explicit.
It's like 2 pages out of thousands, and this pair are nobodies. I guess I overestimated the thirst here a bit.
Feel like some people here can be baited into reading a certain manga with this
ah okay <:naruhodo:680978973697769514>
There's a comic girls S2?
Interesting that they're making Red Gyarados Lance's signature and not Dragonite.
I want to re-watch K-on!, ideally both seasons and the movie. Is there a definitive (subs) torrent to go for or do I just go for whatever?
Nah, it is. There's always a token unreciprocated gay guy or lesbian in harem shit.
Is this even still a bell curve? I mean, technically, right?
These are all you need

Wow it's my favourite Planes 2 character!
I usually like that kinda stuff too, but it's not really comparing to say *kiss and white lily* or *ouji sama nante iranai* for me. I'll still keep reading it but idk <:fujiShrug:393823986577833994>
I mean, the ||student * teacher|| side pair doesn't help but I don't think that's the only reason.
What are people's opinions on the manga *Anemone in Heat*? I just binged it and whilst it hits the same notes as other stuff I've liked, I can't help but feel a bit meh about it and I'm not exactly sure why I don't like it as much.
Spy Family counts as another .5 at least
I will leave it
Can't believe Otaku are horny. What is the world coming to? <:pensive_seliph:590545138032574496>

That one actually is good.
Gonna do boomer amq and just guess Inuyasha until I'm right.
No if you add colour to a manga it becomes korean

We cannot possibly do IFTV because that promotes falling in love with a video game character rather than someone in the real world. That would go against the wishes of dearly departed Shinzo Abe.
You know that BL trope where the two generals of the the opposing armies go off by themselves and fornicate like rabbits rather than fighting each other? Does anyone know where that's actually from? I've seen it referenced a load but I don't remember seeing it in the wild ever.
I'd be extremely surprised if someone hasn't already taken a screenshot of this scene and altered the date so it says 9/11. Maybe altering the time so it shows the time of one of the strikes too
Code Lyoko looked pretty good iirc
Already did that. If I win the lottery I'll bribe a scanlator, but until then <a:sad_spin:626259648294682644>
It doesn't. I just want to read it because I like what the author has done before, you know?
Maybe there'll be a 10yr anniversary something, but I think it's doubtful.
Panty & Stocking is anime original though, right? And the other example, Index 3, is an ongoing series. However there's no more Bloom into You IP coming out afaik, there's nothing to warrant an anime promotion.
Extremely doubtable. I just want someone to start translating Nakatani Nio's new manga.  I want to know what the deal with the weird floating boy is.
GDI Sam, I thought they were actually doing a S2 to finish the series for a second there.
Move it up your list to the top!
I watched GiTS subbed for the record
Ghost in the Shell is really good! I also like what I've seen of the anime tv show Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. I think the sequel movies maybe aren't as good, from what I've heard, but they're still watchable.
True but I'd prefer to sit here and claim it's bait without ever watching it <:mischieva:768092103171375124>
You never know, the Recoil show might not be bait. Have faith in Japan or something.
You can have yuri bait only. Take it or leave it.

"since, on one hand, every given thing may be observed in a purely objective manner". Does Gundam have a thing that lets you do that? Because I'm pretty sure philosophers would argue the opposite, that we can only view things subjectively, relative to our own experiences.

Jesus fighting against the tyrannical false gods of the zonder metal because he is *the way, the truth, and the light* that is the only way you will get to heaven.

Actually, you know which SOL needs an anime? K-On Shuffle. Surely there's enough content by now.
Like, you can go and see an action movie or a romance without much context, there's plenty of those in the cinemas. But a film about just chilling and camping there's not really an equivalent to get an audience outside of those already familiar with the IP

turn off the heating (or put on the AC) for the full wintercamp experience!
Whilst there's nothing stopping you from bringing a big blanket and a mug of hot choccy to the cinema, it's easier to do those things at home. Plus you can sit in a camping chair!
Also very useful to know the movie is coming to streaming. I will pay the fiver just to watch that and then unsubscribe again
You need to finish it, S3 is coming out!
Very cute, thanks!
Also, side note, where did you get the Santa Nadeshiko from Loris? Is it fanart or an official thing?
What would it take for you to not complain about it?

No and I am probably not going to, unless you mean the G episode in which case yes

Who are any of these people?
Downside: it does also treat an incestuous relationship as a sympathetic thing
I'll second "I favour the villainess". It also has a trans character who gets treated seriously, which is quite rare for manga.
It has an 79% rating on Anilist so it's probably good by someone's metrics. As to whether it's actually good queer representation? Who knows? ~~It's doubtable~~
looks interesting, thanks!
<:mischieva:768092103171375124>

(Please don't tell me about gay/bi female leads, I know about those)
Can someone with an encyclopedic knowledge of isekai help me please?
I am trying to think if there's an isekai with a gay/bi male lead, or at least supporting protagonist, but I am drawing a blank.
I'm asking because this show likes the cone-ichiwa pun so this might be one too
Is this a pun?

7% of people insisting a show about (a?) brothel(s?) has nothing to do with prostitution <:galaxybrain:581295203705552908>
The bookworm will soon be able to ascend no further. I will assume this is due to glass ceilings etc etc
Would you rate it 86/100?
She is Lorelei's illegitimate daughter and she picked a grass type to own her mother with it.
Bocchi is good because it gets weird when she freaks out. Also the ||psychedelic thing|| from last episode. That is basically the bit I'm actually watching the show for.
That's assuming that you're reincarnating as Asumi-chan
That Time I Was Reincarnated Into A World Where Asumi-Chan Is Interested In Lesbian Brothels!
iirc ||they never actually get together||, at least at the point I last read it. I think there was a yuri tag on ||nettaigyo|| at some point and that also got removed.
Wait, you *don't* read everything on dynastyscans? This is genuinely a surprise to me
https://dynasty-scans.com/series/the_two_sides_of_seiyuu_radio
I'm pretty sure it's this, you probably have read it
~~I wonder if Aoi Yuuki will ever take on a second role as a Magical Girl?~~
So I know I'm 11 years late here, but that Madoka Magica is quite a good anime isn't it?
I don't think they'll get much more than that though I'm sure they'll show up again.
All of them have, as cameos at least. Azusa even got a fairly big part
K-on Shuffle. || It's a hype moment, the title drop! She finally said "what are we? Some kind of K-on! Shuffle?"|| Idk why I'm so excited about this but I am.
They posted ch1 of the manga on dynastyscans so that means it's canon, right? <:clueless:581295202551988235>
Yeah that's understandable. It's the Sapphi without the "c" and the mario noise at the end of their nickname that confuses me.
That person's nickname  (so not the bit with the \@) gets less comprehensible every time you read it. It's an actual psychic attack
En tl might not be up to date but there were 4 new chaps today

iirc Mikasa Imouto is 10034 or something
isn't 10, 032 about the number of Misaka sisters Accelerater ||killed|| too?

If she was really like them fr they'd go and learn an instrument.
It'll drop. It's at least partially recency bias.
I'd probably watch it if it was made but I'm not using my dictator powers on it.
K-on college and the Asuza one were okay but I am enjoying Shuffle a lot more than either of them
In no particular order my choices for anime adaptions would be 
1. SKM <https://anilist.co/manga/101335/Sengoku-Komachi-Kuroutan-Noukou-Giga/>
2. K-ON! shuffle <https://anilist.co/manga/102317/KOn-Shuffle/>
3 Mao Mao <https://anilist.co/manga/99022/The-Apothecary-Diaries/>
4. God's Mistakes (the other nio nakitani manga)
<https://anilist.co/manga/139700/God-Bless-the-Mistaken/>
5  I don't really have a good answer for 5 so I will put it on hold until someone else comes up with a good answer.
I like the one where she says things like "hora" and "ima" the most I think. I also like Distortion a lot though.
It'd just be like an entire show of Old Lady Nadeshiko
A cgdct where they play old people games like bowls or croquet would be kinda funny though.
Turkey is apparently 3 strikes in a row
Deadnaming an entire country is a brave move.
It's Turkiye now iirc
🇹🇷
The ice skating world
You cannot say after ||that hot tub scene|| that it'll ever be explicitly gay
Yuri *bait* Camp.
No I am not biased why do you ask?
S tier: Yuru Camp movie
A tier: idk, people seem to like Gwitch and that LycoReco thing
B tier for Bocchi
C-G tier: who cares
This is a correct take actually, unless we're including S as a tier. It is good, but it's not top tier.
MagiRevo might do okay as it's an isekai
MagiRevo, Magical Revolution xyz.
I am recommending a manga, If you like a bit of gay angst read this. It is very enjoyable.
https://anilist.co/manga/87208/Our-Dreams-at-Dusk-Shimanami-Tasogare/
I feel like AoT is the more distinct of the two there. Plus it's English so you can more easily explain that it's Attack on Titan rather than having to remember SnK stands for Sakurauchi no Kurosawa or whatever.
Same place as Bocchi episode 13
||there are only 86 survivors|| that's what the title refers to, right?
You cannot tell the difference between this emoji and her.
<:blobcathappy:901687190281674792>
This is excessive levels of blob
Or there's a web novel if not a light novel
It is
(no)
Oh isn't there an Otherside Picnic anime too? People like that I think
Yagakimi and the Kase San ovas
The manga was also trash tbf.
<:RinDisgust:793365026752167946>
I don't read the manga either but that scene made the rounds when it was released
How can you say nothing happens when there was the thing with the swimming pool?
She's talking about Kita
Is there a big voice acting scene for dubs in Italy or is it like how English dubs used to all be the same 5 people?
Yeah, read *My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness* instead, that's text
Hiroi is generally pretty chill whereas Anis is almost always manic
No Sailor Moon? That's a bit surprising
(Please Bully Me Miss Villainess Latest Chapter) ||This is just turning into Madoka isn't it?)||
<a:NotLikeDuck:393822064240230400>
It has the number 2 substituted in for the letter Z in "Zwei", a word that means 2, but it's the third season?
Do not watch Bocchi the Rock. Be the resistance! Fight!
Always ||she was infatuated with that "prince" girl before, right?||
Idk, my theory only extends as far as "it is". Maybe that other girl you see in the fanart sometimes has a sister (or a brother?)
Also Madoka
Further evidence for my theory that LycoReco is a "little sister" anime in disguise
It's a Claris OP so it's either Oreimo, Eromanga Sensei, Lycoris Recoil or (I assume) another anime with incest in it.
👀
Yes and nobody should be shamed for their guilty pleasures. ~~but a bit of light bullying never hurt anyone~~
<:bully:463257081710116874>
Yeah but you like Citrus

You should watch the Czechs instead they have a mole
Pretty deep one ngl
The Irish animation industry?
uchuu senkan titanic
||the correct answer is yes btw, this is indeed Tsubasa||

Blue hair, a high ponytail, this is Tsubasa, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOc0c0euqVs
There is only season of precure but that isn't it
In a slightly more shit-posty phrasing: ACAB includes Chisato and Takina
Whilst this would probably be a good direction for that show to take, I don't think it will. I think it's much more likely to  do "authoritarianism is cool and good actually". This is basically just a gut feeling/projecting based off other anime, but I don't generally expect "police are bad" from Japan in current year.
Jodio at the rodeo
so crazy it killed mangadex
Skip every part! <:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>
It did get shared already but yesterday was yesterday and today is today! Very much looking forward to the poison gremlin anime
Didn't Magirevo come up as yours? or was the adaption not great?
if only
Hectopascal's a 38-medium
oh nvm i just forced it to appear through dupes. I guess i just rolled the 2nd ed a lot lately. ( I also just got owned this round by Nijiro no Flugel straight into Nijiro no Flugel, lol)
no way to know when it doesn't exist
I play with easy enabled, regardless I think it's medium, like 49 or something?
Btw the second ED is the only one that seems to show up on AMQ nowadays, idk where Hectopascal went
Anime eds do be like that
Also, these are some weird things to come up under the "hectopascal cd" search
I like the bit in the second ED where they say "watte shmatte" it sounds funny
The OP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRdNI4XAxRw&pp=ygUOa2ltaSBubyBmdXJldGU%3D
and the other ED

I actually didn't think to consult megacorp™️ and I probably should've
thank you.

Anyone got some pro-gamer tips on how to get cds from Japan? I've been listening to the Bloom into You soundtrack recently a lot, so I kinda want to get it properly. Now, I could download the songs from Youtube, but if I like it so much I should probably pay the creators probably.
oh right dutch cheese is kaas idk why i thought it was kase
Question for the German and/or Dutch and/or other applicable Yuri fans in the chat: do you ever read "Kase-san" (as in Yamada and Kase-san) as "Cheese-san"?
Maybe AoT could be moved down a tier
Of all of these I've only seen Bocchi and Spy x Family but, judging the books by their covers, your rankings seem fine.
yes you should!
Unless there was a third?
Oh I think I put g witch in "literally what is this?" because I didn't recognize the cover. Also Mob Psycho 3.
This is true
It's a good movie! Idk how they made a SoL into a good movie but they did!
<:RinGlare:552231265340882954>
Yuru Camp too low!
I somewhat feel like I should've added "Heard this was bad" specifically for Classroom of the Elite 2

Symphogear has like 62, so it takes a whole 40minutes less to watch!

Oh hey yeah Devin Townsend (and his million bands) is good shit. I like his Ziltoid stuff a lot.
01011001 more like.
Plus changing albums is a bum with physical versions.
No, I don't have the space or the money to store all the shit i listen to.
It's not Human Equation or Electric Castle, but it's good <a:pepeJam:581592088559353866>
No Spotify?
I don't suppose there's anyone else hyped about Transitus releasing today?
"poland" is "enduring" in middle scots? That's probably a coincidence, but it's kinda cute.

Why'd they shrink Kirika's hat for the vtuber? smh ~~bad~~ awful decision.
I guess that explains it but it's still bad. Should have gone for a bigger hat instead.

<@!173112001684439040> I see you've been posting a lot of power metal lately, is Dragony a band on your radar? Their last two albums "masters of the multiverse" and "viribus unitus" are good and also VERY cheesy. Some of their older songs are pretty decent too.

Not sure if this is the *official* Hectopascal, but the album is really good
Yuru Yuri also has an insane amount of character songs for some reason.
Both major brain rot and a fun song.

As are Eiai Promise and FOR THE FUTURE tbh, but to a lesser degree.
It's kinda interesting seeing how the songs' listnership goes on Spotify. Obviously Waikyou Shenshoujing was always going to be the #1 Miku song, but Backpack song and Hidamari Memoria are underrated!
I'm surprised Devil Dogs got the lyric video. that was easily the worst track on that album iirc.
