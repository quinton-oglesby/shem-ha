Sup!

Yeah - a product of the USSR providing aid during the Wars with China when everyone else didn't yeah?
And in the end the US and India have a lot more things that they agree on.
But then again, who is.
It's not perfect
Less Risky as a partner? It's the world's largest democracy for one thing.
Or they might not and so on. I'm not really sure.
They might wizen up and not go for it.
They could yeah, but Pakistan has been keeping an eye on how the Belt and Road initiative has been going elsewhere - which is to say not very well.
Only time will tell though.
The problem with Pakistan is that it's an unreliable ally and so on. It's a big liability, especially with the ISI constantly wanting to go off the reservation. Pakistan can't continue to juggle relations with both the US and China - eventually, it'll have to choose, and right now a lot of the thinking is that Pakistan will turn to China.
Of course, all of this stuff will take time - but India dropping many of it's arms deals with Russia reflect the changing realities.
India is moving slowly into the western camp as the west becomes more aligned against China, and with the clear failure of Russian equipment in Ukraine, India's only options for procurement are to go west or develop domestic equivalents.
