<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
ooh, i could see that being a great situation for Genjuro to take the field after Hibiki used that power to take the other girls down. Not via being manly as fuck, not purely, but because he knows her the best after Miku, and is well aware of his flaws and failings
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
and this would be Hibiki with her mind, not bestial berserk Hibiki. she'd make them **suffer**
hmm, or maybe Ark-Gungnir
oh totally, if Hibiki saw a villain murder Miku in front of her, she'd absolutely snap and become Ark-One

yeeeeeep
also the World Cup starts Sunday. apparently that puts a big strain on Twitter
i've hear speculation elsewhere that the person(s) that knew who had access to what told Musk to get fucked and left, which prompted this while they scramble to figure it out

hmm, looks like the only thing i wanna watch that starts in the next few days (new season of Demon Slayer is in 5 days) is the Muv Luv Alternative anime tomorrow
<:CarolWhat:688191203040034831>
lol
i'll be sad if the hockey anime doesn't have the cute girls checking the shit out of each other and getting into fistfights 😁
||damn, that's horrifying||
Wakamoto's back as Yokohama's commander
🤔
this isn't just for fans
||we'd have to wait a LONG time for TSF action of any kind without this ep. This was to whet people's appetites|| Alternative VN spoilers
||was pleasantly surprised that the viewpoint lady Komaki survived||
I thought that first ep did a great job of showing ||how brutal combat against the BETA is||
They're ok. Nothing great or awful
Nope, the Take is a sexy, sexy TSF. Especially Meiya's purple one
lol
don't recognize any of Yuko's VA's roles
ahh
lol
nah i'm positive they showed a couple Soldiers, just not a full body shot
Takeru's VA is like super new
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=24354
here's the ANN version
hey, i feel the same about not having Marimo and Yuuko's va's back 😭
nope <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
oh, would be neat if they get Master Asia's VA back to voice one of the navy captains (or was he an Admiral?) at Sadogashima
but i've set my expectations REAL low, so i wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't come back
i'm hoping they get Kyoasu back to voice Sagiri
sadly i think Meiya's VA retired
most of the cast are pretty new VAs from what i saw
do we know if Tsukuyomi and the 3 Bakas have different VAs?
🤣
hmm, microscopic annoyance?
i particularly enjoyed him curbstomping that first enemy with just the beating of his heart 🤣
i do remember the art and animation being rather good
i was watching it as it aired, so my memories are really vague. i kinda recall getting annoyed that it felt like the plot wasn't really progressing, and i think that it never felt like the MC was in danger of losing
ikr
||Lay/Hero Kanon||
I'm sure that he could've magic'd up a better sword, but he used the one his dad made in that tournament because it was from him
I found that really touching. He hasn't known them long, but their unconditional love and support clearly means a great deal to Anos ☺️
🤣
yea
lol
🤣
hmm, does Voltron count as an anime? if not, my first animes were DBZ and Sailor Moon
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>

Aisa is a precious cinnamon roll <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
🤣
slime isekai was decent until i realized that the MC will never be seriously challenged, they'll just steamroll all 'threats'
ah yea, i can understand that
hmm, there are some shorter ovas that you could watch compared to a 50 ep Gundam series
my favorite Trigger one
yup, pretty sure it was Meiya's that retired
lol
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
nice, i'll have to check that out
oh right, they're doing a remake of that?
ah k
oh? i thought TDA was finished
hope it's about some of the cool shit that was either at the end of the Alt manga, or in something else from around when it ended
seems like it, pretty much all of the cast are newbies aside from Wakamoto
lol
Takeru's original va is still active, not sure why they couldn't get him back. too much $$$ maybe?
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
aw
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
you could be turned into one at any moment
yea that's really weird
i recall it being enjoyable
i'm getting decently confident that this cour will end ||at the end of the coup arc||
lol yea
i don't see 4-6 or the last ep
ooh, nice. though it looks like it's missing a few eps
agreed
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
it's always a good time for a Gaogaigar rewatch
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
similar color wierdness to ||Yuuhi's hair being blue instead of purple|| i guess
hah, yea
the other spot i could see it ending on is ||Takeru returning to the Betaverse at the end of the Ptsd Arc||, but that would be moving a bit too fast for my liking
yea, they'd have to fucking floor it to make it there
i'm thinking it might end on ||everyone being commissioned||
lol yea
hopefully
lol wat
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
🤣
indeed <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
damn, ||Bullet X was just as good as i remember it being. I even got a little choked up at Mikoto's despair at Gai's apparent death, despite knowing that Mamoru will almost immediately save them|| Gaogaigar
oh boy! finally back to ||the Tokyo showdown with EI-01 arc|| in my rewatch of Gaogaigar <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
rewatching Gaogaigar to refresh my memory of it for SRW 30, ||i completely forgot that the show was seeding stuff with Kaido and Pizza/J long before they become active protagonists||
😔
nice, one of my favorite series <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
lol
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
😲
oof
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
in particular i despise the use of one of my most hated cliches to make an enemy more threatening: ||absurd, near-instant regeneration with no limitations||
yea i'm not a fan of Final outside of a handful of scenes
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
i fucking hated that in AO and i hate it here
yea, i hear that they're shitting all over the happy ending of the original anime *again* <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
lol
though i will admit ||that the Train Demon is the least interesting of the Twelve Moons that the protagonists fight|| Demon Slayer manga
same, and i enjoyed the movie
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Gundam Unicorn Poggers Mode <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
this ep ended just slightly before where i expected
*soon*
when Jojo Part 3 is good, it's *really* good. drags a lot in the middle though
ooh!
nice
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
...holy shit, i can't believe i didn't realize the ssss thing <:CarolBlush:617039657896509460>
oh man, i remember watching that as a kid
Akane and Alexis being able to make their own kaiju worked much better for me
i'm aware, still didn't like that they were dependant on kaiju showing up on their own
yea, they bored me. didn't even create their own monsters smh
i liked the villains in Gridman much more than Dynazenon's
ah yea, the armament people were pretty flat
right after Frodo shows up and uses the Force to kill Voldemort
i didn't like Dynazenon as much as Gridman, but it was still pretty enjoyable
loved when ||the OP of the toku series started playing during the final battle <:MikuJoy:738234684655403110> || Gridman
i bailed on R2 when ||the Black Knights betrayed Lelouch. i was too angry to keep watching with how dumb it was||
yup, Ultimate follows the manga from start to end
sounds good <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
i vaugely recall thinking it was decent
don't worry, that was all Ultimate
Hellsing Abridged is wonderful <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
||'...well shit'||
😁
nice
oh, forgot to be more specific: the original anime or Ultimate?
what are you watching, Hellsing?
<:FudouSmile:672848303632678942>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
hmm, probably watch it all at once
yea that's great
i love the Turn-A OPs, especially Century Color
30's done a good job so far in ||making Victory less horribly bleak||
i'm not surprised 😁
lol
😔
the descirption of the last ep is just some normal thing, not any sort of finale
hmm, looking it up on wikipedia, doesn't look like it
i wouldn't be surprised
and i vaugely recall there's a big Christmas showdown with him, but it's timewarped away or something
ah right
yea he's the big bad...Kilovolt is his name i think?
🤣
lol
yea i heard about that...that sure was a thing
yup, really like how in her first appearance alone, Cornelia very nearly captures Lelouch
i love Kallen and the Guren <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
||rip||
true
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
hah
yea, it's fucking great
huh, weird
yea, Crispin Freeman is awesome as Alucard
yea, the first anime is just decent compared to Ultimate <:FudouSmile:672848303632678942>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
oh yea, that was a great one <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
oh? what did they do?
lol
we'll find out in like 10 years at this rate
oh yea, think i know the one you mean
lol yea
i've read a decent bit of it myself, it's much better than the original
oh, Progressive? i like the manga
i watched a couple eps, but couldn't really get into it
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
🤣
floor 2 was the scam and ||figuring out the Floor Boss' gimmick/weakness via punching rocks i think||
nice
yea, i really like that
geeze
wow wtf
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
oh yea, this ep was Turning Point 2 right? ||Rudeus' first encounter with Orsted?|| Mushoku manga/ln spoilers
i kinda fell off watching the anime, but i'll have to watch this one
yea i think 4's right. Build Fighters, Try, Divers, Divers Re:Rise
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
hm, might have to check it out then
damn, yea
seemed way more kiddy too
i didn't watch it because the concept of the characters riding on and not in the zoids bugged me
ahh
didn't watch any of the one before it...Fuzors i think?
yea, Genesis was pretty good
rip
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
Megas is great 😁
oof
'Fuck your Heart of the Cards!'
nice
lol
and not, y'know, burning hatred or anything reasonable towards the person who put him and thousands others through hell on a whim
yeeeep, i vaugely recall Kirito even shows admiration towards the murderous asshole later on
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
probably not, and i don't think he should try
if you're going to be that unfair to it, i'm not even going to attempt to change your mind
oof, yea
love black clover
totally
still following one piece myself. its had its ups and downs, but overall remains great
yea, two different kinds of awful
lol yea
Boruto only has a couple good things in it, everything else is awful
ahh right
it did?
atm it's just that one chapter of it
not sure yet
definitely
oh yea, i totally get that
first series i really got into
it was pretty good back in the day, still have my dvds of it and the manga
do we know if this is like a new version of the original manga, or covers that new arc that started a few years ago?
meh, i wouldn't be interested even if Watsuki wasn't a pedo.
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
never seen the HF movies, but i do agree there was some crazy animation in the movie
true, really improved on the manga
just hit at the right time, with the right mix of whatever, to explode
yea it's crazy
lol
true
hmm, that might be weird, the arc's not over yet
true
i think the only ones left doing it the old way are Boruto and One Piece
yup
kinda like how the old shounen anime trend of always airing with no breaks is almost gone
you can tell he's got love for it from the bits and pieces related to it shown in one piece 😁
lol
rip
that makes sense
been meaning to check it out since it sounded interesting, guess i'll wait for the last ep of the season to come out so i can watch it all at once
ah yea, i was surprised when i learned that
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
ah nice, exactly where i though it would
ok, i'd be lying if seeing that short pan around ||the Susano'o didn't get me a bit hyped|| Alternative VN spoilers
yeeeep
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
lol
i'm weird, i enjoyed Franxx even after the twist
damn
i think i only watched a couple eps of Evol before losing interest
lol
yup
pretty much yea 😔
and all the stuff before the coup is like...at least 10 hours of content in the vn?
quite reasonable, it skipped/sped through **so much**
same. even in the very likely event it's not nearly as good as it could be ||i won't miss seeing Sadogashima in the anime|| Alt VN
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
animation is clearly worse, but i still found it rather good
i love Kengan Ashura <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
not just the same dude, but both manga are in the same setting 😁
they're great <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
yea, i vaguely recall the vas for Kenshin, Shishio, and Saito being rather good
lol
hah
i heard that it goes wn>ln>manga>anime in terms of nationalism
oh and a Gundam MC too, we have the SRW trinity 😄
...oh wow you're right! So that's a Getter Robo MC and a Mazinger MC in Symphogear 😁
lol
ahh Guyver. i think that's the first anime i remember watching as a kid when i rented the ovas from Blockbuster
ah yea, i recall watching anime on sci-fi awhile back
wooah
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
oof
i'm surprised that exists. didn't 3 bomb pretty badly?
vague memories of the really awful One Piece dub they did awhile back
onto the next manga i love that has been finished for awhile but doesn't have an anime: Animal Country by Makoto Raiku, Zatch Bell's author
holy shit, never thought it would get an anime
<:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>
ok that's pretty good
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
and slime and pals deal with it in like an ep
yup
nah, it was before that
i was ok with slime up until they fought that flying shark demon thing. it was at that point i realized the MC and pals would never face a serious challenge and steamroll everything, and the rest of the show wasn't strong enough to keep my interest
looking kinda Esdeath there Weiss
GunxSword is quite good
only time i've ever woken up early so i could dl eps as soon as subs were out
hmm, i think the worst for me was All Might vs All for One in....s3 of My Hero Academia.
😁
there were a couple neat spectacle things in Super, but overall you didn't miss much
he really should've stuck with keeping Gohan the MC and not pivoted back to making Goku the MC again almost immdeiately
lol yea
while i kinda like how SS3 looks, i agree how it was implemented was **awful**
Kill la Kill's great. it's my favorite Trigger anime
I really enjoy their stuff, even though they sometimes get hung up on things
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
😁
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
lol yea
also Mako's mom is voiced by Nia's va
and mohawk guy is voiced by Kamina
Viral in Gurren Lagann too
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
||Ufotable bringing their A+ game||
KnY ||fucking incredible animation||
<:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>
that and the second are my faves
damn
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
totally
||i wanna see the Akaza and Kokushibo fights animated *so bad*||
ikr
||because the final arc probably needs to be like 2 cours||
||i wonder how they'll handle the next season. a single cour season of the Swordsmith village and the setup for the big final battle? <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641> || KnY manga
KnY ||sadly no||
ah gotcha
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
one more ep in s2 after this one that just came out
||i knew that was coming, i always love Tanjiro's absurd headbutts 😁 ||
LWA was fun
guess it didn't sell well enough to get more <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
that, Guyver, and some others
oh yea Genocyber, one of the first animes i saw as a kid. The Blockbuster near me had a bunch of OVAs
nice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIU86eLUVXQ
cold opens or eps with no op at all always get me excited though
hmm, i can't really recall a link between time before OPs and quality
do it~
yup
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
nice, i've heard good things about that
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
lol yea
how so?
i recall enjoying Frontier a lot when i watched it
same
i recall at least one touching ep with his mom as well, was there something similar with his dad i can't remember?
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
oh neat, i've heard good things about that manga
lol
lol yea
all Yugioh MCs have wild hairstyles
I **loved** Zatch Bell, extremely excited to see what Makoto Raiku has planned for it <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

he's great 😁
<:HibikiDab:688190074395164696>
i was sad to get rid of the sweet Genesic Gaogaigar with metal bits i had
i used to have a bunch of mecha  and godzilla figures, but i had to get rid of most of the mecha ones when i moved
twice i think. the time you said, and i believe ||when he unlocks his midseason upgrade||
lol wat
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
<:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
nice, i vaugely remember watching that as a kid
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
hmm, my memories of how it handled that are pretty fuzzy, so i can't say anything about that
it has some good stuff, particularly Tryon 3 imo, but overall it was just decent imo. I enjoyed the first series much more
Back Arrow from...last year? was really good
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
hmm, i think my favorite MA is the Val Varo
though if we're talking just UC stuff, i'd have to say the Gerbera Tetra
Master Gundam, god it's so cool
lol
ugh, 0083 <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
though without the double suicide <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
yea
lol yea
hah yea
lol
lol
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>

ah gotcha. doing a rewatch, or first time?
still Pride by a fucking mile imo then
you should check it out if you get a chance, it's great
his debut in that tunnel was fucking terrifying
i do love how eldritch shadow monster Pride is in Brotherhood
aside from that, my memories are fuzzy on 03 Bradley and 03 Sloth
well i couldn't stand Wrath in 03 even without comparing him to Bradley in Brotherhood
hmmmm
oh that's a good one
Uverwold i think was their name
i enjoyed the first OP, but the 2nd and 3rd are the ones i *really* like
i can see that, yea
cool
😔
🤣
i'm curious because sentai and the two look cute together, but i can see it getting tired quick with the 'gotta hide our relationship from both sides' thing
don't bother with the third season of it, it's all filler and not that good
Kenshin is a pretty cool kinda historical anime, set in the Meji era in japan
Jujutsu Kaisen is excellent, i highly recommend it
yea
oh nice, the mc's voiced by Byakuya's va <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
love the OP for Ya Boy Kongming! gonna check it out
hmm, does playing one of the main antagonists count as a main role? or are we talking just a main character?
or Gundam 00, where he played Lockon
oh nice
😔
👴
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
ikr
yea, Grievous was terrifying in the 03 series
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
true
hah
oh right
yea, there's only like one or two 'just keep making eps forever' animes i think, in One Piece and Boruto
yup
lol
ahh
lol
yup
lol
G's my favorite Gundam <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
it's always time
||force Mika to start thinking for himself, not just follow Orga||
your way would've been much better imo
||yea, that sounded awful when i heard about it||
agreed
||'lol, look at all the characters you've grown to like dying and the Big Bad winning, we so edgey'||
yup
and from the stuff i heard secondhand that happend after that, i'm really glad that i dropped it there. i'd have *hated* the rest of the season
lol yea
hmm, i suppose i can see that, but i guess it was the last straw for me
yea that was pretty bad
from what i recall, the point where i dropped IBO s2 was when ||McGillis got Bael, made his play to take over Gjallarhorn...and didn't have any contingincies prepared when the other Seven Stars told him to fuck off. just felt so dumb to me||
so my memories are very fuzzy
uhhh, i don't recall hating it, but i watched that as it was airing and haven't felt the urge to rewatch since
lol
Big Bonk
lol
lol
lol
maybe not safe for END ||i *loved* when Ral and Chinan deployed in the Build Master and Gouf at the end of the season <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> ||
watched that subbed for the first time recently, it got me a bit chocked up
ah yea, agreed
oh? when was it done better?
yea <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
not until s2 though unfortunately
i also recommend it, it's great
oof
hmm, you mean just anime?
lol
it still had the same safety systems that let Kira survive Aegis blowing up point blank <:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
lol
lol
the first chunk of ZZ was a real struggle to force myself to watch
lol yea
i eventually lost interest in it, but it's animated pretty well and apparently, for better and worse, follows the manga much more faithfully than the first anime did
yup, it's the sequel manga, Flowers
nice
huh, they finished the new anime of the original series?
lol yea
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
lol
🤣
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
oh! Magic Knight Rayearth is another magical girl anime that i thought was quite good
Ya Boy Kongming is a currently airing show i'm really enjoying
i can recommend a *ton* of mecha anime if you're interested <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
yea, adapts the mobile game's plot really weirdly from what i heard
those are the magical girl shows i can think of off the top of my head
uh, never watched it myself, but Pretty Cure is a pretty long-running magical girl franchise
cool
and the MC's Aoi Yuki too
never watched Madoka, but people say that's very good
and there's another classic in Sailor Moon, just about finished rewatching S (s4) with some friends, and i enjoyed it a lot
can't really speak for Cardcaptor Sakura personally, but i've heard people say it's pretty good
go for it 👍
Nanona's quite enjoyable too
well there's Symphogear obviously <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
any specific genres you're interested in?
ooh
i remember being surprised at ||how long it took them to form the titular mech when i watched it awhile back||
and the like 90 second series recap was amazing. i don't remember for sure, but i wanna say they faked us out by acting like it would be a clip show ep in the preview in the previous ep <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
lol yea
just rewatched that with some friends, love it
can't say anything about that, didn't interest me
ah yea, Electric Chinese Batman <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
lol yea
right about the same time i got fed up with the manga
yea, the first couple seasons are quite good, then there was a lot of glaringly bad animation
i usually think of his role as a minor antagonist on Zatch Bell because it was hilarous 😁
i love Wakamoto
i recall it having a couple cool moments, but overall being so-so
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
ah, so no one gets off ever
🤣
lol
🤣
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
i vaugely recall heaing something about that kids would visit his house during that arc of the anime, and he'd (jokingly) chase them off using his Cell voice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkPlBYekfr8
nice
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
yea, the grey-haired guy that was first introduced as Tsubasa's dad
oh, no wonder Mr Elegant sounds familiar in SpyxFamily, he's voiced by the same va as Genjuro's brother <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>

try to take over the world?
super dragon super ball super heroes
lol
even dragon ball super duper heroes would be better 😁
lol
ugh, i hate that name <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
same
also yes, it's Genjuro
*wikis*
yup, Nana did voice a character in Gravion
yea that's great, i always at least mouth the words there 😁
Zwei was great, the OP and the Sol Gravion combination theme were awesome <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
yea, the tv series wraps up too neatly from what i recall for him to have thought of it then imo
lol
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
fucking Nexflix <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
i fell the same way with no Jojo on...fridays i think it was?
😔
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>

nerrrrrrrrrd
nice
oh man, the Fatal Fury movie. that's a blast from the past 😁
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
it's excellent
he voiced Inuyasha too
yup
oh, i like that the Osiris Red dorm teacher is voiced by Usopp's va
*wikis*
huh, not familiar with his va, and i don't recall that part of the anime clearly, so looking forward to it
'fuck yo turn'
lol
ah gotcha
oh, i know Takehito Koyasu voices the big bad of s2, and his ace monster is apparently ZA WOLRDO 😁
oh nice
like how s3 gets *dark as fuck*
i know the general outline of the events of the series, just not the specifics
only a couple eps in. Jaden just had his first dark duel and didn't realize he just watched his opponent get *fucking eaten by monsters* for losing <:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
couldn't stay invested in Zexal for long because of how much of an idiot the mc was, but i'm liking GX so far
oh nice, this masked badguy's voiced by Wakamoto
decided to watch Yugioh GX because i got the urge from seeing someone doing a watch through on twitter, and i completely forgot JAM Project did the first ED <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
or absolute garbage like Boruto
hey at least it's not a filler-bloated mess like naruto
probably only like 2 seasons left after this one i'm guessing
yea
lol
i'm still reading the manga because my interest isn't gone, but it's definitely the manga i'm following that i'm least interested in
i think it was after the Overhaul stuff that my interest began waning
||i'm really only gonna watch this season to see Mirko's badass fight with the High Ends animated|| MHA manga
my interest level in it is **way** lower than it used to be
and more Burger Demon King
oh nice, next season of Dr Stone
huh, i should give it a watch
nice
couldn't get into that one myself
lol
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Slayer:_Kimetsu_no_Yaiba
yup
seems pretty shonen to me, it ran in Shonen Jump
hmm, Demon Slayer is like the only case i can think of where the anime improves on the manga
lol
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
yea that was fucking dumb
ohh, the not giving Ral the Doms thing?
lol
or just fucking launch nuclear missiles from a battleship like M'Quve did in the first Gundam
lol
oh right yeaaa
how so?
sorry. this is a Nina Hating Zone 😁
nice
lol
huh? not sure what you mean
yea, something about enough for Zeon to be able to keep fighting for awhile
and got caught off guard when he was and Revil attacked from there
iirc he deployed his forces assuming that his spy in the Federation wouldn't get found out
hm, not sure
hahaha, a dueling monkey <:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
hahaha, i really like Misawa in Yugioh GX. his deck is apparently thrown in the ocean, but he goes 'hahaha! that was just a deck i made to fuck around with, my **six actual decks** are just fine!' <:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
hah
fucking love the zeorymer's theme
ok, finally time for the main plot of GX s1 to start
oh hey, this antagonist in yugioh GX is the same guy that voices Buggy in One Piece
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
oh and now he got young and *fucking ripped* and is voiced by Basara's va <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
oh snap, the big bad of GX s1 is voiced by Professor Saotome's va! <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
poor Misawa, made the husband of a sexy Amazon duelist <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
awww, no more JAM Project ED <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
wow, this vampire lady is pulling some absolute bullshit to beat Ryo <:HibikiAngry:688429716096548892>
totally <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
i just heard
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
ikr
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
https://twitter.com/V_SAGA_ANIME/status/1534507784527564810
yea, it's fun
i certainly hope it's getting another cour in a season or two, because i seriously doubt they can wrap things up well in the remaining 3 eps
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
😔
totally counts
that was Voltron for me, took me seeing it show up in SRW to realize it was an anime 😁
i think they only had dubs up to like midway through namek at the time, and would just start from the beginning again
Sailor Moon and DBZ were my first animes, watching them really early in the morning on local cable before i went to school as a kid
it's great
yup, with the energy sword
||oh damn, i only saw the first ending where it left what the survivors would do vague, and not the extra stuff later||
lol
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
pretty fitting for RWBY then <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
lol yea
i have, and can confirm it 😁
||'boo hoo, how dare you stomp our shit in for rebelling, we're gonna mind control *the entire galaxy* in revenge'|| Delta spoilers
Delta was decent, really despised the enemy faction
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
ooh, very cool
cute mc is cute
ahh
yup, those are gundam names 😁
nice!
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
that is **way** worse than the 2 examples of shows ending badly that i can think of: Shokugeki no Soma and Gundam AGE
fucking yikes
what happened?
aw that sucks
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
flcl's a lot of fun
yea, sadly don't think they got to the first proper use of the Goldion Hammer 😔
||Buggy finally getting the respect he deserves 😁 ||
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
looks like it, yea
having Heero's va as commander is pretty good 😁
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
i do! <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
or all the mecha figures i could buy. had to get rid of a bunch of them when i moved, only have a small Gaogaigar now
ikr <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
yikes
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
agreed
yea i was thinking the same. do people care enough about Korra for a movie to be profitable?
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
ah, i thought i recognized Fine's va in Love After World Domination. she's the school nurse/Blood Princess <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
sadly no 😁
oh, kinda reminds me of....Sakamoto Days? the manga in shonen jump about the former assassin running a convenience store
hah
makes sense, it was buried in the ground for ages iirc?
hah
after...i think he killed like 20 suits and a couple ships in like a single fight
yea, Amuro was mowing through Zeon pilots before he even got his Newtype powers
i think?
after that i can only really recall some holes in the head when an aquatic mech grabbed it, and Amuro overworking it when his Newtypeness got too high for it to keep up with
lol
oh right yea
i don't think it suffers serious damage until the end fight where it gets destroyed
its shield gets trashed a few times, think a Gouf cuts off a bit of the foot like once or twice
i recall the original doesn't suffer that much serious damage
it was more that they had a bunch of spare parts that could replace the destroyed ones for Usso the MC before other people start using Victorys
oh yea, that gets its parts blown up like almost every ep <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
same
looks interesting so far
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
the Ace of Aces if you will <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
oh neat, Nanoha's va is voicing the top high school golfer in Birdie Wing
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
or the follow up to the Giant Robo ova <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Or the Gundam ZetZet
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
i can't ever recall seeing someone doing that before now
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
||true||
yea, Shining and God didn't take that much damage even with much more close range fights
i wouldn't be surprised
Honey Flash! <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
<:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>

lol
yea, that was really dumb

some Ultimate Coordinator <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
😁
Master, Master, and Master here <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
i completely agree with Zero EW. the angel wings look really dumb
hah, yea
yea 😔
the pilot's supposed to be *world-level like Sei*, just doesn't make sense
yep
can't have a new character totally dominate the top seed team 3 on 1, so lets invent a drawback for that one fight and never use it again! <:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
lol
lol yea
hah yea, that was pretty wild
ah, built out of good ol plot armor!
i'll get the popcorn!
☺️
nice
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Wufei was by far my least favorite character of the Wing protagonists
agreed on both counts
makes sense
lol
tons, yea
oh totally
super gay

well, he was working at a convience store when he first showed up iirc

<:ThatsExactlyRight:793885897216753715>
i'm absolutely sure that ||Ippo's going to un-retire||, it's just a matter of when
yup, it's very realistic. only a tiny bit of more out there stuff shows up occasionally
Ippo's my favorite sports series <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
i miss the all-out insanity of golf mafia, but the stuff after is still good
yea
nice, first one i'm gonna watch is Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer in a couple days. *loved* the manga
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
oh you mean sk8. never seen it
yup! i'm quite excited <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
'boo hoo, we got our asses beat for revolting, and we're so butt hurt about it we're gonna *mind control the entire galaxy*'
i *really* disliked Delta's villains
😔
oh yea, big time
Freya and the Walkure girls were good, MC guy was fine, jet mechs were neat
agreed. they were my only serious problem with Delta
i can hear the Sakura Wars OP now
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>

i was annoyed at how Hikaru clearly chose Misa at the end of the big showdown with the Zentradi...but because they got extra eps they decided to retcon that <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>

||it was at 11:49, lemme see if i can find a pic of it in real life||
||nah, it was a bit before that. one sec, lemme find the time it shows up||
||hah! they showed that one park with the pillars that shows up in a lot of toku shows 😁 ||
||love that pic of Akiko's dad, he looks cool as fuck <:GermainCool:736523122324275309> ||

hmm, that's a tough one. AfO twisted Tenko into a weapon to use against All Might without Tenko realizing it. Slade tormented the absolute shit out of Robin, and also used Terra as a weapon against the Titans
think there was a lot in...Victory? or was it Turn-A?
😔
😁
lol
hmm, well i think it's ok for goalies to touch the ball with their hands in football, so karate chopping should be a'ok 😁
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
||yup, they were in the background of the shot of all the base W forms in the latest ep||
yea, wouldn't be surprising. both ||because it's Philip in the driver's seat, and because FangJoker's a big step up in power from the base forms||

no problem

hey, at least human soldiers would be effective against Beta <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>

was totally just so that one person voiced by Romi Park with the sweet Crossbone suit didn't take out the top team 1 on 3
the stupid suddenly having to worry about how many particles you had left
i can still recall getting sick of the Build Knuckle spam towards the end

cg is good though
arcs are severely truncated, art's much worse, and imo the new VAs are also much worse
*incredibly* lacking
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
||a bit, yea. they should give him a rest for awhile and then have him come back with a win against a strong opponent||
||eh, i don't mind this loss that much. he did quite well against Elan in what i think is a much worse machine than his previous two||
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
and i think he also updated it again, in the middle of combat, when they landed on earth to handle sand better
yup, just redid it in like a minute when he first got in

<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
ooh, very nice
hm, can't really recall anything of his design unfortunately 🤔
just finished rewatching that with some friends recently, very good
Mr Freeze was also much worse compared to BTAS
very cool
let's see...only 10s i have are G Gundam, Gaogaigar, Giant Robo, and FMA Brotherhood
was quite enjoyable before that, then we get an *amazing* rematch between Kazuma and Ryuho <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
oh i have a good one: the finale of sCRYed
yea
oh, there was Eureka 7 AO shitting all over Renton and Eureka's hard-earned happy ending towards the end. i really liked the first series, so I was *pissed*
closest is Gundam AGE falling apart in the last arc i suppose
hm, can't recall an anime finale like that for me 🤔
oh boy

<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
oh nice
oh riiiight, i vaguely recall hearing she was in that
only toku stuff i recall her from is Yurusen in Kamen Rider Ghost
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>

<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
never watched the original Mazinger/Getter, but Armageddon/Shin vs Neo/New Getter and Mazinkaiser/Shin Mazinger/SKL are quite enjoyable imo
oh nice
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
the *other* Mazinkaiser song he did <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>

nice
that was...Alpha 3?
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
god i love the part at 0:35 of him yelling **CHANGE GETTER** at the top of his lungs <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
have a Getter Robo OP he sang as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoNmzoP3CF8
No not Aniki <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
||Miorinne did that to make things easier on Suletta, but didn't realize that Suletta didn't mind the extra work, or how badly she was taking it because Miorinne was too focused on work||
||i'm sure 95% it was just miscommunication||
unfortunately yea. apparently some event in japan is airing instead or something
and then 2 *more* weeks for the ep after it <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
gotta wait 2 weeks though <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>

G Gundam is wonderfully over the top like that 😁
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
yea <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>

Yeah I’ve heard the same. Gonna check it out eventually
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
i hear the previous one is also quite good, but it doesn't cover as much of the manga
ah nice, that's really good
the older one, or the one from...2011 i think?
damn
oof
fucking yikes
yea, for a week or 2 i think
really good, yea
yea, i heard that was a bad adaption too 😔
spending more time with these characters we barely know because the first 2 vns weren't adapted? fuck that! 😔
lol yea
yea, and they're not speedrunning content anymore
same, never
yea
digital art's bad, va's are bad, ost's bad
agreed, i only really care about the tsf stuff because the cg's good
like enjoyable to watch, but that's just stuff i heard, don't know myself
https://www.twitch.tv/itssaku if you're interested
speaking of muv luv, i heard from an acquaintance on another server that a guy on twitch that's apparently pretty good is gonna start the vns in about an hour
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
damn 😔
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
yikes
'Those people that gassed innocents so they could drop their colony on the Earth, then *fucking missed their target and obliterated a major city* aren't all that bad' <:CarolWhat:688191203040034831>
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
wow
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
hell yea, my Gaogaigar Bluray shipped <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
even when i was really into it i wouldn't put it at A, maybe B+
🤔
lol yea
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
agreed
sweet
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
<:CoolNoiseDontLookAtExplosions:929758650157895711>
i don't read the manga so looks like i'm wrong
And apparently nothing’s really changed with him even though the manga’s been going for like 200 chapters now I think
Yeah, everything I’ve heard paints him as pathetic as fuck
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
tons <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
oh and i think the guy that played Winston in Ghostbusters was a major human character on it too
yup
remember it for Jeffrey Combs (Weyoun in Star Trek, Question in the DCAU) voicing Rachet
don't follow any fan projects
i watched a good bit of Prime
some people are dumb
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
she's quite sexy from what i recall
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
||oh yea, the glasses maid pilot||
i recall getting a good laugh from when Raven was revealed as the one guy's sister, and she somehow concealed her giant boobs perfectly
oh yea, there were lots of cute maids
i don't recall much of the animation, just that it was the anime that got me into JAM Project
face-first even <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
makes sense
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
<:CarolWhat:688191203040034831>
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
||yea, I think that fits <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611> ||
Ahhh
||huh, never heard that term before. what does it mean?||
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
at this point i'm just gonna wait until it's confirmed to be actually over and watch what's left
🥱
lol
and Itachi, though he was extremely chill there
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
hm, i should see if she's been in something with Musashi or Benkei's vas
oh, i just realized something: with Witch from Mercury, Aoi Yuki's been in anime with 2/3rd's of the Getter Team now 😁
Aoi Yuki's got an excellent voice to nail that <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
Hiedo Ishikawa yelling STONERRRR SUUUUUUUNSHINE at the top of his lungs while this plays is one of the coolest moments i've ever seen in anime <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
hah
lol
ahh
ooh, didn't know that
my favorite is G though
as for myself, my first Gundam was Wing on Toonami
Dai-Guard was quite good, still have my dvd boxset of it
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Oof x2
oof
can't say myself, only heard stuff secondhand

<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>

yeaaa, i can remember it had some fucked up shit
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
||it'll shatter you <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611> ||
haven't watched it myself, but some friends of mine on another server really liked it

WE

GIANT ROBOTS
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
yea that was neat
i didn't watch the anime, but i read all of the manga. found it decently enjoyable
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
ahh right
though iirc you have to deliberately get Ideon's health pretty low to unlock said attack
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
<:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>
Detective Conan right?
that caught me **completely** off guard when i watched it, and i *loved* it 😁
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
lol
sorry, still drawing a blank. it's been ages since i watched it
hm? what did it do?
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
nice
just that Sugita voices the MC's mech
hm, i don't recall too much of that one
hella stupid indeed <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
i remember very little of it, but that sounds about right
...pretty similar to Carol now that i think of it <:CarolBlush:617039657896509460>
and iirc using any of the titular machines burned away your memories or something, so if you're not careful you could erase your identity
lol yea, it was a trainwreck
i recall the art in that being quite good. Does a great job getting across the twisted, monstrous nature of the bad guys||...and Shin Getter <:ChrisShock:620077681484103680> ||
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
huh, gotcha 🤔
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
hm, wasn't it the classic Gainax 'shit, we ran out of budget'?
a necessary sacrifice <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
oh yeaaaa
iirc Guyver (the older ovas) was the first anime i watched as a kid when Blockbuster was an actual store chain <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
ah gotcha
i vaugely recall feeling about the same having known about The Fight loooong before i watched the rest of the series
oh and i think Jung's mech was a Getter Robo homage kinda?
all i can recall is Coach Cool, Mech Cool, Noriko and Kasumi get home like centuries after they left because of how the FTL worked
i can kinda understand people leaving, i vaugely recall the series before that being nowhere close to as good as that fight
that's afterwards, when Noriko and Kasumi are escorting Buster Machine 3 iirc
yup, the Gainax Pose <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
oh yeaaaaa
lol
damn
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
personally i didn't like Dynazenon as much mainly because ||the villains were so much more reactive compared to Akane and Alexis. like they usually just sat around and didn't too that much while waiting for a Kaiju to appear that they could control, whereas Akane and Alexis were making and animating their kaiju||
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
oh good <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
i *adore* G Gundam, but don't go in expecting a normal Gundam
i tried watching the first couple eps and it bored the hell out of me
is that bad or good? i'm pretty unfamiliar with artists/animators
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
but ||Domon proves that wrong when he's able to pour his heart out to Rain in front of the entire world and save her|| major G Gundam spoilers
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
*by far* my favorite Gundam though
hmm, i wouldn't say it's my favorite (looks at Gaogaigar), but it's one of the few shows i've rated 10/10
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
not that long after we lost Aniki too <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
damn <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
same, and ditto for Chibodee and Sai Saici
ikr 😁
nice, you're moving fast <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
aw
oh yea, i have the old dvds of it
i could easily be wrong though, it's been ages
i could've sworn they stopped airing it originally right at about the end of the Solomon battle
yea, i recall G, Wing, and what was aired of the original was good
you damn kids, get off my lawn!
that's how i first experienced it, wayyyyyyy back when it aired on Toonami 👴
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
oh, like that one wordplay challenge early in the Chapter Black arc of YuYu Hakusho
huh
No way! <:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
it's pretty good, but my favorite is the original TAS theme
WOO, TIME FOR MORE GAY GOLF
Quattro's dawning horror as she realizes that Nanoha's found her, and then that, no, being on the other side of the Cradle from Momma Bear Nanoha *will not save her* is just...*chef's kiss*
that entire sequence is **immensely** satisfying <:Ver:704169051391524875>
i love the wheel mechs and battleships <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
i should check out the toku series eventually. i've heard it's pretty weird
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNn9NxZH2Vo
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
i haven't finished it, got like halfway when something distracted me and i stopped, but i recall it being pretty enjoyable
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
reminds me a little of Kill la Kill and every ep title being old japanese pop songs i think
oh nice
i second this
love E7...don't love AO <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
hmm, i don't think i heard Heats before i started watching Armageddon
true
hmm, i think Storm is my favorite Getter song
love those <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
ahh Gravion, the anime that made me a JAM Project fan <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
oh neat

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlY2_Hx2pDc
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
definitely my favorite Gundam
yea, it really picks up when Master Asia shows up
nice
reminds me that Mobile Suit Breakdown, a Gundam podcast i like that's watching all of Gundam, is *slowly* closing in on getting to G Gundam <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>

god i love that song
