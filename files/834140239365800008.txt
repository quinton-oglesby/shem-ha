Hibiki Preferred for profile picture but all are welcome
gonna need an october profile picture
can we get some halloween geahs in the chat?
aoi yuuki js a show seller for me i just love her performances that much
classic
JETIX
i wonder if this is the first historical rendition of Hibiki Voice ðŸ¤”
had her on the cast already so it made sense to use her for an extra voice
this clip of a random mosnter from Madoka Magica is totally Aoi Yuuki lmao, i'd recognize that hibiki voice anywhere!!
i do generally prefer modern character designs
i just brought them up as an example of digital effects going too far
yeah definitely not
they're definitely hyper crunched too
valid
my video player has a sharpening effect that does exactly this if you turn it up super high
normal lines shouldn't look that.. watery and crunchy
with Attack on Titan they do this extreme oversharpening of the characters
takt op destiny had a Chromatic Abberation effect that made it feel blurry to me
they add effects onto it that while not noticeable at first just make the shows less visually pleasing to me
personally i don't really like how the "MAPPA style" looks
they have good animation but the actual art isn't very appealing to me
it can be a bit Too Much sometimes
some modern anime tend to blur the heck out of the backgrounds for a depth of field effect
the dark shading of that era is hard to replicate as well
i love how "Earthy" those old backgrounds feel
i really like cel era backgrounds
valid
backgrounds are quite underappreciated
yeah they tend to look so... desaturated, and also can't be upscaled to HD like pre-digital works
