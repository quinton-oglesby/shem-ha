https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/609475569188470963.png?v=1
This is a HibikiWow I had made for myself
yeah I tested it in my own server and <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
also very good <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
oof quality isn't very good <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
FudouWoke
I'll be very surprised if no one else has thought of this <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
(props to a friend of mine for cleaning this)

wait I might already have a clean version of this
<:ChriSmile:613005626787758090>
just thought the emote was fitting since it's from her birthday 4-koma
probably needs a different emote name than the one I use though, since we already have <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176> here
maybe we could add this here?
she's so happy about it <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
it would look like this I'm guessing <:KokoroYay:528271413405024274>
<:ShiraBean:661077098428891136>
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
here you go <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

<a:hinalaptop:550757299300466708>
hmmm, can do better
oh I can probably do it
any/all of these are up for grabs, they're all from official material <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:KanaHeh:605497353406775319>
<:KirikaBIGNom:653930308260986893>
<:CAAAAAAAAAAAAArol:613052761390710785>
oh right, if there's still space
Leiur emotes never
~~who?~~
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760> the more you know
<http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/2480058954466317571378774930533488707>
I don't think you actually can use it by itself
"fine", "no problem" basically
blessed
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
these are all from the official XDU 4-koma so <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
not enough happy Basa here
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/605505854073995264.png?v=1
oh this one too
hard to do much when you're dead <:GWmythicalFeelsSadMan:374568771421208577>
it's called KanaHeh where I use it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/605497353406775319.png?v=1
can't hurt to try for this one too
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/613052761390710785.png?v=1
it's finally time
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> is such a good name
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
do you mean Andou or Terashima?
but gohan and gohan
stroganette isn't a word so I'm sure you can spell it however you want <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~inb4 I'm the one who got the name wrong~~
one of the stroganettes, lol
<:GWmythicalFeelsSadMan:374568771421208577>
real proof is remembering every nickname Andou gives
Terashima Shiori and Andou Kuriyo are best girls
Ayahinein stronk
this one's all I need <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:MikuRave:858488956231221288>
I'm not very confident in my redrawing skills but that one looked easy enough so
thank you thank you <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
<:MikuRave:858488956231221288>
<:HibiMikuPeek:661660014288568361>
<:Ayahinein:858501098594893834>
it has been since XV episode 5
~~I just cut off her ahoge because I'm a monster~~
but yeah having the full as a command is better
<:Ayahinein:858501098594893834>
if I tiny size there's no point in cutting the braid <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
this was the closest I could do, I'll leave it up to you guys to decide if it's good enough
<:AyahineinZoomest:858498364387885076>
this... might just not be fit as an emote <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:AyahineinNoShrimp:858497639687127050>
I didn't want to cut the braid though <:ElfneinBully:602159741116088325>
hmm needs to be more zoomed in
<:Ayahinein:858497089596030996>
if someone can redraw the ahoge without losing their mind, I kneel to them

the full version of <:ShirabeChibi:698939825155473499>  as a sticker would be nice
yeah that was one of the reasons I waited for a while to watch it
mfw I finish AXZ and first thing I see on reddit is "Symphogear rewatch starts tomorrow!"
I actually finished the day before it started
Marathoned the entire series over last month, and here I am
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>

you're all blessed


<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>






<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
hoodies are justice






they both are used by people to fight
Basa blew up too many bikes, so she's after ships now
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176> <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920> <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>

also while I'm posting 2D seiyuus
well I know I got it off pixiv, but I'm sure it's not the only place you can find it
thanks <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
that does not seem like the right source <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>

or Gen
She's pretty much as important as Miku
Kanade is fundamental to both Hibiki and Basa's arcs in season 1
yup that's what it is <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>


with some tricky editing
I stitched it
yes
it's already something like 4000x2000 lol, I'll do an upscaled version once the NCED is out and not with my not-quite-well-edited version
the biggest amount of raw power held in a single pic
it's so good
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
don't look at it *too* hard
<@!247701824335904770> I did my best

<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
also wfc that pic is great, lol. Maria is the butt of jokes even in fanart
it's from the 4-koma coming out (for XDU I think?) for each episode of the anime
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
this is what you were thinking of

Symphogear pro racing spin-off after XV plz

<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
sorry me dumb
oh right
many thanks <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>

that first one had me die of heart attack



oh right the other day I found a great Fate artist
mind blown
wait I never realized Serenade is also Serena + Kanade
if someone can find the full version it'd be cool
yup
I see Fine in the top left too
it's part of a bigger image
oh
wait what is Cag doing there
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
she can do it <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
possible <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Shirabe: yoyos; Kirika: oyoyos
or maybe Kirika oyoyo'd before and we just never noticed cause it wasn't a meme moment like that <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
found Kaneko's art
<:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
this is hilarious
I'm honestly surprised half of these combinations exist
please post that Kirika & Kuriyo I wanna see that
that's incredible

<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
this is a PEN!
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
first thing I thought of too <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

oh hey I know that artist
why does Tsubasa *not* have a restaurant in the anime
you can barely read it, but the text in the background quotes the cool scissors line <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>

did someone say cool scissors
zero for me
plz stop the boobs 4 times the size they should be Japan artists <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
definitely took me a second as well
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
the legs just look weird in general <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but they didn't have a personality there, so essentially he's the one who made them into proper characters in Gears of Destiny
I... don't think so because I don't think he had a hand in the Battle of Aces (the first PSP game)
and she's like this hyperactive genki girl that's nothing like I ever heard Nana voice, I love it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yup
fun fact: the PSP game was written by Kaneko
not in the main anime series
she's from the PSP games/last 2 movies
also it didn't even register that was Basa's gear cause she already looked so similar <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
it's Levi from Nanoha
best Nana role
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
what's the crossed out word? I can read the rest <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
it's like a 9/10 spinoff for a 5/10 show
Railgun was so good it made me watch 2 seasons of Index even though I hated it
good Miku art is <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>

Chris and Basa have my favorite chemistry in the series
but I don't know the context so
they're saying something along the lines of "it's not appearing"
why is this funny what's the context <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
bless Kerrik as always <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

too many things <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
then again the tags do have the Nanoha series so maybe it's just Fate's hair but not well drawn? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that's all I know
it's not
yeah but someone said that was Fate's hair
that's certainly Mami's outfit, don't know about the rest
those aren't her weapons, that's not her body, that's not her hair <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I just know the blonde girl isn't Fate at all
that's definitely not Fate

I kinda wanna put them together to make myself a wallpaper but it's hard to find something that fits
if someone can find me a pic for Nanoha and Fate that's as good as this, I'll... be very thankful I guess <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Doga Kobo animation does a lot for me at least
I understand if it might put you off, but I still recommend checking out ep1 to see if you enjoy it <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
but even the manga is only 2 volumes in so I honestly have no idea
as of episode 1 only Kirara yuri
https://gfycat.com/temptingmedicalhogget
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
watch Koisuru Asteroid
Kirara is a manga magazine which has plenty of manga with subtext which is never made explicit

considering how at least two other characters in G are inspired from Nanoha
I'd be really surprised if Maria wasn't at least partially inspired by Signum


is that all of them?
<a:hinalaptop:550757299300466708>
where did I find that first one
actually not all
you'll get all the results

aaaaa
<:BayonetHug:597188701877043220>
there's actually a huge parallel between what Yatsu did to Tsubasa and the way Tsubasa treats Hibiki in G after realizing her time is limited
Yatsuhiro is just really bad at expressing emotions the same way Basa is
they hint at AU Basa and AU Yatsuhiro reconciling in the memoria story taking place after the event ends
in the AU that obviously never got fixed since Gen ran away from the Kazanaris and Basa decided to follow the only family member she liked
Basa and Yatsuhiro were on terrible terms before GX happened
AU Basa is worse at the sword than Main Basa, but she's got better stamina
yeah AU Chris is stronger because she can fight close range too
yeah but Gen is a badass <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I need to re-read the event but I think it says the difference in their combat skills
AU Basa and AU Chris have been trained by Gen
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
you mean thank gen

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
if you pick a Tsubasa line at random from the anime, I give you 50/50 odds it's got the word sakimori in it
Sentinel. What Tsubasa calls herself all the time
<:MikuLove:585596189802627072>
this is the only combination of characters that makes it work <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I'm also a chuuni, so I love sword duels <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
is it just cause Basa is my favorite so this is actually my favorite pair of characters
I love this art so much it's hard to explain

<@!149704282793443328>
bonus: last Hibiki thought bubble "she's an angel", and the narration "they had lots of hibimiku after this"
except instead of just stopping Miku to say "we'll talk later" she also kisses her <:MikuLove:585596189802627072>
before Hibiki and Tsubasa go to fight
it's the scene from XV ep5
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
haven't you ever called, like, your equipment in games, your gear?
yeah
to be fair, armor made of music is pretty literally the show's concept

technically the last AXZ OVA ends with Chris singing the theme song at karaoke <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's just flavor <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I mean, it doesn't need to be
it's not in the show
no the rest I got from our official lore book, aka the keywords
I think in AXZ4 you can see Tiki reading it
which is a real manga in-universe made to try and disguise Gear operations <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the silly excuse Chris uses in GX ep1
or however your subs have it

Kaneko is a JRPG writer so he needs his 20 GB of text exposition. If he can't put them in the show where else will he

it's a really good song too

finale: "we were just kidding! see you in seasons 6, 7 and 8!"
Dr. Ver raises from the grave to use Airgetlam
like, I wouldn't put the beef stroganoff past Symphogear <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but not in a way that will cost him his life afterwards
I mean, I fully expect Kaneko to troll his audience one last time
<:GWmythiFeelsBannedMan:391321610872946689>
the Custodian *is* beef stroganoff
what if
Bean, you're thinking too little
I don't actually want them to re-use it
well, correction: I wanted it in AXZ
I want Axia no Kaze as insert where the first part also plays over the transformation sequences
thread
https://twitter.com/zoid9000/status/1137740676047822848
don't know how they can top that
tbh I feel like Axia no Kaze is the ultimate version of compiling the activation/zesshou melodies
agreed <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
every duet from AXZ
Rainbow Flower
yeah off the top of my head
just listen to each character's line in Hajimari and Axia one after the other
the entirety of Hajimari no Babel is activation song + zesshou melody
even if it was licensed, I'd never watch Symphogear on Crunchy since their subs are worse and don't have the songs
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
understandable
it's because of Kirika's thing where katakana words are in hiragana
it's 'baasudee' for birthday <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I think you're getting the "bus" part wrong <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://twitter.com/YameteTomete/status/1142019493373317120
it's so silly
I mean, it's like naming your attack "destroy"
also Exterminate would be such a terrible attack name
wait I just checked and Exterminate does play right after Glorious Break anyway lol
that syncing of lyrics and attack name, beautiful
how do you instrumental into that
I always thought the simple reason for no auf Exterminate was the a cappella intro
when Exterminate didn't play it was for another new song, even
with them having played Synchrogazer like 3 times in season one, I don't see them robbing Metanoia like that
the worst of both worlds lol
so once axz is up we can get a sneak peek at the sub quality
it might be likely for whoever subs axz to be the one subbing xv too
also something about Tsubasa which Takagaki can't say but her only reaction is "Senpai! ...SENPAI! <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792> "
|| "Looking at the script, I felt this season's theme was "living your own life". Since the users are usually prone to self-sacrifice instead." ||
I'll keep it under spoilers in case someone doesn't want to know
Another comment from Nana about the theme of the season
time to go into hiding cause I will wait for good subs
wait that's not
correct way to play gacha games
I loaded it up once to get Miku 5* then deleted it
longest con ever
the Custodians are only weak to Red Hot Blaze
I just play them in the background while alt-tabbing to something
I don't think I ever skipped a Symph ED
I was right in not believing in them cutting the pun corner on the radio
people would quit the company because of Takagaki's puns
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
I think I've already listened to it more than I did Vitalization/Exterminate (if we don't count the 12 times in the actual episodes of the season)
it's so good
Metanoia might become my best OP though
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
Futurism best ED, especially now that I have my self-made "Aufwachen version" of it
Synchrogazer and Testament are tied for best OP for me
tomorrow shows off the other half of Carol really well too, it's great
you can read the details at the bottom of the wiki page
https://symphogear.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Green
it's a cover from a 1963 song
I can't really count Green Green as a Symphogear song though
I have made peace with the fact that I will never know whether I like G-Beat, Rainbow Flower, Shenshoujing or GENOCIDE <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>  more
choosing the top 10 is fairly easy, actually ranking them against each other next to impossible
Carol's two songs are both in my top 10 for solo songs
I want her to have a Bayonet Charge attack combo with Tsubasa
wait that's Matsuoka
no idea if it's released honestly, haven't looked
it's pretty great <:LetsDestroyABike:593568746694639839>
we had ||another Glorious Break situation, with Nana insert song. FINAL COMMANDER's the name||
ep1 never has the OP
started rewatching, hopefully subs don't hurt too much
have done so for like 8 years, never had a problem
I use uTorrent myself
there are a few reliable torrent softwares
no?
maybe the X-Drive lets you breathe in space
same
lol
you have me curious lol
go ahead Naraaa
I'll use them to fill in the blanks from watching the raws this week, and just wait for good subs from next episodes
and well, as expected
oh thanks, blessed Nana
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I mean, why ask to go out when you're already married right
alright time to see if Crunchy subs are any decent
||we all wanted her to, though <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024> ||
btw ||what is the title of this season's Glorious Break||
so now we're gonna overthink that to death
also yeah the summary baited us with the question Miku was gonna ask
and 1 of a naked guy with a ball of fire
9 screens of epic battles
I know, it's just funny that you know
I love that that of all the screenshots of AXZ S.O.N.G. could have kept, they have the one with naked Adam
best ep 1 in the series
I'll just say two things:
I'll wait to rewatch with subs for proper impressions
thanks I was looking for one
I love how ||after all our calling the 3 new girls jobbers, even they are self-aware about it and say they have no chance to beat the girls/coffin||
ending song is FINAL COMMANDER
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
gdi I didn't see it the first time around but ||Kirika has such a derpy face while frozen I burst out laughing||
||who's taking bets on whether Trump will cause more trouble||
oh right middle of rewatching just reminded me
we just discussed this lol
good luck with it, we all appreciate your efforts
oof
oh I see <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592> that one made me lol
I love scarves
that scarf
absolutely
yes
ofc, opinions will vary <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
hell it might not have any super hype moments like climax episodes, but on quality alone it's on par with the best of any season
same here
haven't seen Heaven's Feel so I can't comment on that I guess
I didn't think there was any issue with the writing this episode
Millhi, maybe under spoilers, can you tell me what you thought was wrong with the subs? I'm actually usually quite harsh on CR lol but I haven't really seen many issues so far
which is not a given
at least it feels like they were written by someone who has watched the past 4 seasons
I can't help but want the cool stylized lyrics and everything, but these are good
I'm not too far into the episode to judge the actual accuracy of the translation, but they got the technical side of things right
that kinda thing
like, for Kirika's attack the sub had a different color
I can't recall the last time I saw a CR show with typesetting
TYPESETTING EXISTS
color me impressed
AND the song
oh hey they subbed the holy chant at least
also ||scarf attack ftw||
okay yeah it's not, I double checked
yeah, best tranformation in the series so far imo
I might be wrong since sound effects all over the place there
||the guy from the very beginning, pretty sure his seiyuu is Matsuoka Yoshitsugu?||
you can't slip Matsuoka past me
it's in the credits
what's the second word in the 6-person song title? don't feel like looking up kanji now
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I get you
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
everyone talking in here
I got the feeling that since she's been a "complete" character for a while, people find her kinda boring compared to the others
I can't wait for whatever the hinted Basa development is
proud to say I recognized that Aufwachen intro for what it was 1 second in
this sets me off so bad
they did the principle/principal thing
OKAY TRIGGERED
oh my god I forgot with so much other stuff in the episode but ||Tsubasa's Wight Slayer now makes a fuckin helicopter I can't||
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
the problem with official anime subs is that one of those is really badly written most of the time
so basically I started thinking of it as getting to enjoy two versions of the story
I used to be really into VNs, so you can imagine huge scripts of JP talking with EN translation
the more technical explanations went over my head
but Symphogear isn't so simple
since I watched Bandori s2 and pretty much understood everything with the raws
to check
I did watch the raw first in fact
I don't understand 100%
I can't imagine what translating geah songs by ear is like
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
"I could do better and I learned to use subbing software yesterday"
it's like "aaaaaa people are getting paid for this"
The downside of being into tl is that I'm now incredibly bothered by any subs that don't sound right lol
<:HibikiYes:593568746694639792>
as someone who both likes and does some translation, I really liked your work on AXZ
take your time if you need, we appreciate your work <:MikuLove:585596189802627072>
I like you guys' more so if I'm already waiting I'm not gonna go with Commie
I'll be waiting for you guys' subs starting next week
how do you mix that up
how
okay I got to the catch a cold line
can we like just end the season here, call it 10/10
or the whole Ver death scene literally being a set up for AI DESU YO/ NAZE SOKO DE AI
like getting Tsubasa to make Nana's drawing
I really wanna know how many plot points were made literally for the sake of memes
well, also without Ignite their Alca-Noise could destroy them in one hit
CR EN has always been worse than other languages
no surprise
if I can mention a small detail I liked from the episode, it was how that one person tried to help the girls somehow. Too many shows make bystanders completely useless
also Aimi playing a da ze character was made to appeal to me specifically, I'm very happy
I liked how they were like "lol we can't beat that, let's hope they do or we're screwed"
<@!400844698140409856> you get a virtual cookie for this it seems
||cause someone was credited as "Enki"||
did you read the credits
my best translation experience still has nothing to do with kanji, it was having to go onto bread.jp.net to figure out what the katakana was saying
I really liked that she used them in the first place
not completely useless at least
so it made me laugh
and yeah lol we were literally talking about Red Hot Blaze and Chris' sniping minutes before the episode dropped
it's along the lines of Six Flower Rebellion, but Joe said they have TL'd it so I'll wait for their take since my creativity is zero
oh yeah I just came back from looking it up myself
when you literally were cleansed of the original sin thanks to a laser beam made of Miku's love <:Ver:336656981144109066>
yeah, the others are just harder to spot since s2-3 weren't nearly as unique as s1 transformations
we were pretty much fangirling over it earlier lol
join the crew
it says Rokka something
nah, we need a new Mikugear
she's the one who stole pieces of Japan's Gungnir to make a gear for Maria
plenty of flashbacks show Ryouko!Fine at FIS
Ver literally worked with Fine
100% disintegrated by its own laser
nothing left
no the SSJ is super gone
help it's hard to keep up 3 conversations at once
a keyword specifically mentioned the Custodians being afraid of humanity's progress, which is why I'm thinking Fine's interpretation is only partially correct
>someone who just rewatched the end of G today
that's why I recognized it
thank you
oh
yeah when Fine said it it was like that, but it's also only her interpretation
I might be wrong
I got the feeling the first scene was on the moon actually
I don't think necessarily hers only, going by the myth it was more of humanity's overall progress?
depending who the Him she was referring to is, maybe she had a direct tie with one of them
which was set by the Custodians
Fine wanted to release the Curse of Balal
that line's tl needs to be "Go jinx yourself!"
I called the "I'm sorry Fine" before it happened, I felt smart <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
that definitely seems like the implication
finale of the season is gears ally with the Custodians to beat Genjuurou
yes
I mean, we can never live this down from now on: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/590329981213605916/596684177219256340/fd.png
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
but I'm also done with money on gacha thankfully
the amount of money I spent on Bandori shall not be mentioned
avid Bandori player here, honestly thankful I can't play XDU or goodbye life lol
just in celebration
oh right I'm gonna go install XDU real quick for the all 5* pull
close the server, we reached the peak
badum tss
the Frontier is in SPACE
also if the guy in the beginning died in the Frontier
the arm thing is different
doesn't look like it
to the point whether gear or not I can't imagine Miku not singing this season
they're going all out
we have a new 6-person song (only G and AXZ did this), an extra Nana insert song (like GX)
tbh, with them having unveiled a 6-person song already all bets are off
like, "don't ask me about common sense!" (very rough)
if I heard right
yeah I think she actually says the opposite?
I can accept BasaChrisMaria
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
it's just a lesser version of the other one, yeah
<:BayonetHug:597188701877043220>
Maria is too cowardly, she can only sing about it
both
It is kind of a shame now that we can't say Armor Purge is Chris' signature move
yeah
isn't it the thing from the end of AXZ
<:KirikAyaya:585256962065956894>
welp
is there one of those reaction charts out for this episode?
obviously it means he'll handle the finale by himself <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
and yeah Rokka Ryouran was HYPE
obviously we don't know the context though
basically the main conclusion we came to is that he activated the Curse of Balal to protect humanity from the other Custodians somehow
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
also something else was mentioned later but a bunch of Sumerian names popped up and I quickly got confused
ah yeah
we only know his name through the cheating magic of looking at credits though
let me go look it up
someone pointed out some mythology about Enki (his name)
I think I prefer a consistent episode over a ridiculous scene myself
I'm in for that
Kuno Misaki GENOCIDE
go read that interview if you haven't yet
I was literally gonna mention that
for reference, Bandori s2 had its climax be a 2 minutes-long song that on CR got no subs
just so you know
this is a miracle of miracles
CR is REALLY bad with that
yeah
yeah CR had a bunch of translation hiccups but they did get songs rights
yes (probably) and yes
given the mummy look I'm assuming they took inspiration from pharaohs
I don't put it past Symphogear to just have it suddenly wake up though
it was a "coffin" so it should be dead
just seems to be some ancient Custodian creation
only the moon isn't fodder

wait I'm getting dejavu from this conversation
correct ship
Otherwise Maria and... Elfnein? she's the only character left <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
you were not ready
I really got a laugh out of AXZ itself making fun of it in episode 1
not gonna lie, after how much shit I gave GX for giving the same arc (I'M WEAK) to 5 characters,
but they didn't dare touch this one
and in AXZ they fixed some of them
they knew they made mistakes
same
since we just quietly took him out of the series
so powerful he'll never be beaten
that reminds me, someone on the reddit rewatch thread pointed out how many <:Cag:423197445644615711> lines from the episode of her "death" have double-meanings
ah and that too
that's why they can go toe to toe with Symphogears before using the robes
yeah, cause of their "perfect bodies"
the Illuminati trio has a higher base power level though
Elf a good girl
no bully
I don't disagree but <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
SHINJITSU NO HITO
(that says "haaah... won't Maria remember me again?")
Sugita plz
it's a classic
yeah I recognized the BGM immediately
obviously is one
song of the heart
<:ChriSpaghetti:593568746442850305>
speaking of which, editing a few bits of food to dirty the table where Chris was eating has to be the most hilarious BD edit ever
I actually never saw that animation cause my first experience was with the BDs
with AXZ and expecially now with XV though, it feels like Symphogear really found a way to feel unique even with more "classic" tranformations
I enjoy them more than GX
they are unique
I give them a pass just because I honestly don't know how to do it either
nice call there
also LOL
ah yeah that's who I meant
just ask if you want a link <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
but I do recommend one channel which did like 40-minute or so commentary on AXZ episodes and it seems like they're doing it for XV again
there aren't many reactions on Symphogear unfortunately
320kbp/s though <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>

nice
did you also do that for past EDs like me lol
Oh I found lyrics for the part of Final Commander that plays over the credits
👏
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/231447613122150401/597220187527446557/ep1.jpg
don't know if this was posted already
there were two shows I think which were popular so far and they didn't do anything for me so Sympho #1
it is so far, really
glad to see we're all on the same page
there is no objectivity in arttttt
yes
regardless of whether he'll appear, nice to see Sugita's watching the anime <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
also it was really only the case in GX and AXZ
feels like this season won't do that though
it didn't have ridiculous set pieces like punching a mountain but I never really cared for that as much as most people did
tbh I prefer this opening, the action was just as awesome
and I answered the Trump question above
I agree with pretty much everything you wrote Kerrik <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
rather than just being a co-operation
I was saying it to someone else, but judging by their expressions it seems more like the US are being forced to help as repayment for what they did
the one about "deicide" ends on the tagline from the preview, freakin Kaneko
only keywords on the site for now are the usual pre-season ones
I think Spear's talking about the German part from AXZ e1
you mean for Ewigkeit?
god this intro is so good
you can just download mine off Discord too I guess
and Kirika's like "don't ask me!"
Shirabe is like "what's a coffin supposed to be again?" since that thing is doing nothing that looks like a coffin
it's kinda like
the coffin was kinda an awkward translation
her best plan so far was to jump into a giant laser
just Bikki was very confused about lakes being covered by snow... in Antarctica <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
nah I don't think it was implying that the moon fucked it up or anything
they didn't blame it on anything
to set up things coming out of the ice
no they just said "climate change exists"
<:BayonetHug:597188701877043220>
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
shhhh ChrisBasa lives in my heart
AXZ already learned to only have a few characters in the spotlight rather than rushing arcs for everyone
so Basa and HibiMiku focus for this season
same for DMJii likely
I think Chris and Maria are done with development
it was hinted we'll have Basa focus
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
I feel like there might be spinoffs or a "new generation", but Kaneko is the type to end things properly
this being the final season and all, it would be weirder if they didn't have a final send-off of our Last Action Hero
I don't expect him to actually appear properly, but I'm sure they'll reference him somehow
I can't beat John Wayne Vercingetorix
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
nice meme
good
Symphope, high five
Bikki gets the good one-liners
I'll come back alive even if it kills me!
they can only be together <:DMJiiHug:579676447854034947>
Kirika a best <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the subs did make it come off they somehow did not know what a coffin is
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> join the club
best attack screen of ep1
oh I was gonna take a screen of that
I mean, it was in GX
yeah Ignite wasn't very well thought out
true, but also they at least didn't take the place of B-side songs or anything
since fights in GX literally always went: Auto-scorer dominating -> Ignite -> insta-kill
it just ended up eating 2 mins of transformation sequence per episode
I actually never cared for it
I didn't know so many people liked Ignite this much
no, they specifically burned Dainsleif in ep13
they burned it up for the upgraded gears against Adam
they did
Ver's Ignite
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
I like Hikasa Youko but I love Kanade's voice more
2) because it came literally out of nowhere in GX ep 1
1) because Maria was a terrible character in G
I never liked MariaBasa
My Precure knowledge is lacking <:GWmythiFeelsBadMan:391321619748093972>
welcome to best henshin of the world
any reason you're so specifically against Mikugear lol
yeah, stuff like that too <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
big brain
that one "don't make them panic" by Chris during the sniper scene because she always tries to be someone they can rely on, for example <:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
This episode did the Symphogear thing I really love which is showing each character's personality really well in the little things
Jesus wasn't the only god among men at the time it seems <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
in the credits
yes
aside from the fact that I don't think Crunchy can literally alter the anime footage, I did watch the raws so I can 100% confirm
even on the livestreams when they introduce the seiyuu she's the only one in English
it's her thing
all of Chris' moves have always been in English
that's not type-setting
yeah
we'll now never know
biggest plot twist of the franchise
it took 5 seasons by they finally can spell "death"
I can't believe I just noticed this
wait
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
a new meme is born
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
the dialogue flows much better in a few points now
<:MikuLove:585596189802627072>
outside of two small typos, exactly the quality I'd expect
just rewatched with YT subs
then they replay it so she can put her armor on
Chris does Armor Purge at the end of her henshin
case in point, Symphogear s1 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Someone did say "I've seen entire anime with less budget than that henshin"
Basa's fault for duetting with everyone
if we actually do get 3 duets, HibiChris, BasaKiri and MariaShirabe is the only combination that doesn't end up overlapping a previous song
no HibiChris or HibiBasa is a crime
as much as I want every combination
in AXZ there was a structure to it, but I can't really see them just giving us duets for no reason
So, do we think we're gonna get more rarepairs duets this season
<a:ElfneinDoIt:493803070409670657>
SCIENCE
so technically they should have all evaporated
someone was explaining how once you go past absolute zero it actually gets hotter
lol even Kaneko on twitter is saying to recommend Symphogear through the new Hibiki henshin
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I feel like I'm slowly getting brainwashed
https://streamable.com/4w01m
also for anyone as insane as me, I've clipped this and have been listening on loop:
meanwhile, after rewatching the episode again, I noticed how well the first few lines of Rokka Ryouran (specifically BikkiBasa part) fit what Yuuki Aoi described of Hibiki's character
I want the show to reveal Tony Glazer as a Custodian
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
the Custodians are getting rekt so they decide to possess Genjuurou cause he's too strong
final boss
OT3 intensifies
fun fact: they're the only trio of characters to have duetted with each other in all combinations
calling it now
so DMJii duet, HibiMiku duet, and ChrisBasaMaria trio song
we're definitely getting the final ultimate Zababa duet
alright yeah inspiration hit me
actually thinking about it a duet/trio song centered on Basa is very likely given the hinting about her having a major role
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
good taste <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792> <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592> <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
I'd be up for a trio song of the OT3 too
oh and HibiBasa combinations work too
Kaneko been pranking us for 7 years, won't stop now
Already feeling like I'll get a lot of mileage off this meme
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/590329981213605916/596684177219256340/fd.png
but then we couldn't occupy ourselves for a week discussing Symphogear physics
I mean, the only other scale that uses degrees I can think of is angles, and that means nothing
and ^^
JP uses celsius so you're right
so in other words this is Symphogear's "his power level is below -9000!"
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
"I don't understand anything you're saying!"
If I can quote Hibiki
legends say at 256 degrees exactly the world implodes
Chris did say they had a heat-regulating field...
if we weren't already 100% sure it was about Miku, we are now 1000% sure
I guess it's time to mute this channel
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
the 3 month wait gonna be painful <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
that's why I don't want to spoil myself on it
I'm gonna dodge B-side for now <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
thanks <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
alright, as expected
on the other hand, anyone have a link to the full version of ALL LOVES BLAZING
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
I don't wanna know what Hibiki's B-side sounds like yet <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
first time watching as it's airing, I forgot chara songs come out before they even appear in the anime
Finale of the season is God watching a movie with Gen
that's a name we'll never use
"Glitter Gear Gathering Finest Arts"
"Basically, I don't really understand it"
"Outer Physics"
Kaneko's in full trolling mode
the common sense keyword has slain me though <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
this is the only thing worth seeing
time for info dumps
oh boy, an interview and a bunch of keywords dropped
I don't want to make promises cause I know well myself how lazy I am, but once I'm done with my exams maybe I'll work on some keywords for fun
it says something about how the sad part of everything is how even she doesn't know the real circumstances behind everything
the Fine keyword actually kinda supports this
replace bike with ship
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
~~also I'm obviously biased against anything made just to ship them <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592> ~~
AXZ unique pairs were great
if I had to say one bad thing, I'm disappointed that by the look of the OP we're gonna have Maria/Tsubasa team up again
WHAT
on the rest of the episode...
I also liked how fluid the art style was in the fights
feels like they took parts of each of her previous ones
I really like the new Kirika song
thoughts one by one I guess
WHAT DID I JUST WATCH
UHHHHHHHHHH
uhhhhh
uh
"we have good ideas but fuck most of them up" - Symphogear <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
it's fun
I mean, I just like to see more interactions between characters who don't interact much
Maria/Chris: past regrets; Tsubasa/Shirabe: quiet one with troubles getting close to people; Kirika/Hibiki: ~~actually the same character~~
and each pair was clearly based on character similarities
I don't know, I felt like they were integrated well. "We need Unison to beat these guys, let's make sure everyone can do it so it's not all up to DMJii"
Serena/Fine ship when
all tastes are valid
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I don't actually take shipping seriously pretty much ever so if I ever comment on it just assume I'm memeing
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Me now: <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
just the other day I was like "It was a really good idea for AXZ and XV to split cast focus. Can't wait for Tsubasa to get development this season!"
I just realised I got hit with the hardest "be careful what you wish for" of my life
Aimi is too good but also Millaarc <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
the line about Kirika and common sense
screwing up every classic line of the series
"Eliza"
absolute trash
after seeing the Crunchy subs, holy shit thank god I waited
still doesn't stop him from showing up if the flashback extends long enough
I mean, Ver 99% wasn't involved with whatever disaster took Maria and Serena's home
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
I hate that you made me think about this
gdi
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
ai no tame = for love
and people have also talked about the secret meaning of the name spelled backwards
that's what Nana said on her radio and interviews
yup
pretty sure I used those subs and they were pretty good
we also had GX done by H&D, right?
I'll need to remember to never check r/anime frontpage next time though cause people put spoilers in titles <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I waited 5 days for YT subs and I can say it was worth it <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I think it's someone different from ep1 since that one felt much better
but the worst part is definitely that whoever translated this episode didn't know any of the classic lines they re-used
the weirdest one this episode was the "concert hall near the cost" instead of "concert hall at Yokohama Bay" lol
do they think we don't understand place names
Crunchy was just too lazy to check
it's spelled in English on the site itself
it is Elsa
yeah the OP shot of Elf with the headset I think also implies it's her researching a way to get in touch with Carol
but no Elf sacrifice <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
I guess Elf might be able to use it
it isn't a relic though
even if she doesn't come back alive
I think we can count Fine as being here based on plot relevance
but they learned not to bring back the dead with Carol, so there's hope
it's the last season, gotta have the "everyone is here"
I will be surprised if he doesn't show up at all <:Ver:336656981144109066>
and we have so much stuff to cover this season already
while he's dead no less
I really can only see it backfiring if they try to develop him
Ver is too ridiculous for that <:Ver:336656981144109066>
we should organize a group rewatch now and rewatch all episodes that are out every day <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
nice thing about watching the episode 5 days late is that I don't have to wait a lot for the next one
they need the power of love too
just singing isn't enough
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
but Gen should know not to tell him
Elf figured it out and told Gen
is it though
I'm pretty sure he doesn't even know that
her surname is the one I can't figure out for the life of me
I'll leave further details to the pros
Millaarc is from Styria, Austria. A failed attempt who didn't manage to become a vampire, and her Stained Glance (the thing she does with her eyes) is also presumed to be an ability from vampires
8 years of studying it and I haven't learned anything
actually it should have been obvious after reading she's French
Elsa Bête
I got you <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Elsa is from France, least powerful of the trio in combat but a quick thinker
the Elsa and Millaarc keywords had some new info, while mostly retreading their bios
though I'm not 100% sure how to un-katakana them
oh we have full names for Elsa and Millaarc
I guess I can post some of the funnier parts <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm sure zoid/YT are working on them
I bet Kaneko's having lots of fun
also, the Sneeze made it into the keywords
one of them is Hamburg steak
oh boy ep 2 keywords out
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
we solved your country
lol next email is another woman who said she went from having two children to five during the time Symphogear has existed
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
their reaction to getting a mail from a woman who said she started watching when she was still a student and now she has a job and a baby
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
"Symphogear is life"
as expected from the terrible pun team
Fasting Song
it's a song about wanting to eat
realized the joke
lol I just
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
"Did Kaneko-san make this? The title sounds like Kaneko-san made this"
>spending a whole minute trying to pronounce Kirika's song title
".....I FORGOT" <:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
and they had to tell her "on the sneeze... do the "XV" thing"
she did it normally on the first take
lol apparently Ayahi had a lot of trouble recording the sneeze right
I want a compilation of all 60+ radio intros <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
relatable
Iguchi singing the new ED but with lyrics about wanting to eat ice cream and cheese cake
new Symphoradio time
zoid summarizes the Symphogear experience: https://twitter.com/zoidzero1/status/1152208904417185793
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
whether dumb like the sneeze or heartwarming like the hamburg steak
yeah it's literally just memes
there's plenty of great ones, I encourage you to watch them now that XV is airing <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
who doesn't
aside from memes, the shorts also cover events not shown in the anime like Basa graduating
thankfully SONG managed to give her a better wardrobe eventually
also Elf had like 15 copies of her cape from GX ep1 at Carol's castle
if things being over-the-top meant it wasn't canon we'd have to delete all 5 seasons <:Ver:336656981144109066>
yeah, it's all slightly exaggerated for comedy's sake, but doesn't mean it's not canon
Pretty sure she was gathering funds for Ver and Mom
I mean, it's not like Maria *had* a reason to be an idol
one of those Bikkini photos is her phone wallpaper, you can see it in AXZ
this is all canon
yes
the Zesshoushinais are unironically the best part of the franchise
time to sit out of the server for half a week again <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
there are no numbers between 1 and 9 <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
the episode was only like 20 hours ago though lol
especially since so much shit was going on
I'll be the first to admit I don't pay too much attention to Noise designs
yeah
oh
wait the episode is all a blur what do you mean by that
I need a break
"OH SHIT TOP GRANDAD"
"Shirabe henshin hell yes gimme all the yoyos"
"oh shit top grandad"
WE BELIEVED
SHE SHOT THE FUCKING GUN
"HOLY SHIT RED HOT BLAZE FIRED IS THIS EVEN REAL LIFEEEEEE"
"SO GOOD"
"OH SHIT CHRIS HENSHIN"
"oh shit they mentioned top dad"
here's a run-down of my impressions as I watched
I just watched the episode
the fu
what
I had to go back to check but
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
https://twitter.com/zoidzero1/status/1152649019425878016
meanwhile, seems like zoid agrees with the above
nice, I guessed it was from that short but I couldn't be sure
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Aya mentioned it right under the video, Grenadier
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
but
I actually have no idea what this emote is supposed to represent
also hi fellow Elf pfp <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
"well, they still aren't together cause he *was* a dipshit for 2 years"
I'm really glad they finally dealt with topdad the way we always said we wanted
alright now that I've had time to think the episode over
Symphogear steals animation cuts, characters and plot beats from everything, I wouldn't be surprised if it's intentional
well, I like DMJii way more than Maria too <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:DMJii:549819519082692608>
if Maria doesn't job in her henshin this show is cancelled
not impossible
I could see them as BD specials
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
only 2/3rds dead
two more episodes for best transformation
none of the henshin have disappointed so far, I'm very happy
I'm 99% sure we'll see it <:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
best skit still the birth of YAMETETOMETE
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'd watch Zesshoushinais forever
just follow the current trend and make a season out of the OVAs
that is, the Zesshoushinais
tbh a sitcom about everyone
that was the only good part of Chris in that episode <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
Shirabe plz
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
it really is the ultimate Symphogear experience I can't think of anything to complain about
this season
tbh everyone has
they've been great
GX also had one combo attack by them that didn't get a card
that's what they've always done
I think they're saving the DMJii combo attack card for the unison song
I had the biggest grin on my face lol
I know right?
as the day Red Hot Blaze got shot
today will forever be remembered
yes
I think they just haven't been going overboard with them
there were like 3 this episode
Shirabe can't distinguish ketchup from blood but she's still the only one to know what a sword is
"it's an [X]!" "No, it's a sword!"
oh right, scene we need to have happen in XV still:
well, technically she can already summon a thousand swords at will but
Tsubasa defeats Fudou and goes on to dualwield
I guess it fits since for being called a hero and all Yamato-Takeru was a big piece of shit
who thought that was a good renaming
lol
oh
Murakumo?
which one is that wait
^pictured: Japan's strongest sword
I came across it in uni since I was doing JP literature and my dreams are dead
Kusanagi sounds way less cool once you know what it means
I 100% expect either Kusanagi or Masamune
Gen+Tsubasa+Ogawa vs Fudou
well if he is we can have another dream
would Fudou really be so powerful as to beat Gen
sword and wind, not very creative lol
clearly the one fighting Fudou should be Genjuurou
what the actual fuck
o boi time to check
Vanessa still needs to show off more of her character
Elsa is good too but yeah Millaarc has stolen the spotlight for now
exactly <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
second, it's not even like they're saying "she's actually a good person", it was just something very obvious: of course she cares for her family even if she has no qualms about killing others
first of all, have you actually been watching Symphogear so far
so many people upset at how they're "redeeming" Millaarc it's ridiculous
you want zoidzero1 iirc
on his main are just retweets
because he didn't wanna spoil
he made a separate account for XV
and the fact that it's not actually impossible is what makes it Symphogear
did I just read
thanks for reading this shitpost
everyone else: "AI DESU YO <:Ver:336656981144109066> "
either before or after Kimi Dake ni plays, Hibiki realizes her feelings and goes "This is..."
what if
I literally had a dream about this last night: you know how we all kinda want a true confession for <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690> ?
yes <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I predict one more shocking twist incoming
our information is that "ep 4 is the one to look forward to"
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
oh no they're eating themselves <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
I guess her mistake was thinking a 200 ft fall would kill an anime character then
(now iirc it's because she needed his arm after the other relic she was after was shot, but details <:CarolStare:336656462287994882> )
really, losing to Hibiki & co. wouldn't even have mattered if not for her one mistake: getting Ver in the Château <:Ver:336656981144109066>
well, Carol had stuff planned out well anyway, she's getting a pass here
or for Maria in G (Ver was just screwing around instead of giving orders <:Ver:336656981144109066> )
same couldn't be said for Adam
basically, these villains have a leader with a brain
Chris' fight actually straight up felt like a MV the way they lined up music and action
yeah it's definitely more of a stylistic choice
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
what sort of Kaneko madness will be in there
I've been looking for a new series to play anyway
I might just start it after XV is over
also Kanade, the traffic lights thing is a combination of Japan using the bluest possible shade of green, and the fact that "Ao" used to mean both blue and green, and it's been associated with the color of traffic lights
"braising the steaks" is the best tl of the century btw
well, we know how to resub AXZ now
and yeah I wasn't saying dango is a good localization, simply that I prefer it to neapolitan because it's the one of the two I understand
I wonder if there is anything else in the world with a pink/white/green fixed color scheme
At least I trust them to actually know Japanese, which is not always a given with CR
unfortunately their tendency to over-localize means I get even less references in their scripts because I'm not American
I mean, I personally don't dislike them, you just have to know whether their subs are for you
while I'd have understood dango
I, and plenty of people who I know, had no idea what Neapolitan was lol
Commie does very American things
I'm all for keeping dango
I will basically be shutting off my brain for half an hour till Genocide&Genocide
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
today I have to watch Chris episode + TopDad "redemption" episode don't remind me
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
cause they were running out of ideas in the 2nd half
GX repeated every transformation to the point of having like 3 in one episode at times
they might also do Tsubasa as well but it might depend on how her current arc develops
well, I think it's almost 100% sure we're getting Maria this week
yeah <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Kinekuri a man of culture
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
(and I say this as someone who loves the Trails series to bits, I can't stand Laura's popularity lol)
please, Tsubasa has an actual character, let's not compare her
the rest is either stuff we already know (Ignite Module dead) or stuff that's still a mystery (Shem-Ha bracelet, Daedalus End)
https://twitter.com/zoidzero1/status/1154747757778886658
most of them aren't too interesting this week, but we got Vanessa's backstory now
Keywords outttttt
this is pretty obviously Vanessa
Ep.4: "The flower's name is Amalgam."
The ep synopsis is a bunch of cryptic bullshit as usual
have there been non-cryptic previews
ehh I've heard this from a bunch of people, but I don't think Elf's useless just cause she doesn't fight <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241> 
this season she's already learned to reconfigure gears on the spot
what about Fudou screwing with Tsubasa more and this being a Kanade rip-off
"mysterious familiar melody"
Frankenstein monster, basically
Fudou is Asshole Evil
genius, that's why ep4 is so hyped!
never count anything out in Symphogear
they're joking that since we've already had the reveal of Fudou being the chessmaster it's already the climax and the rest of the season will be everyone on vacation <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I can tell "pinshan" is gonna become a new meme <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
navigating through a Chinese site was kinda hard though
that's how I marathoned it lol
you can find every single episode on bilibili
also they're laughing about that one Maria line with the ambiguous translation ("I'm great, for my age" in the YT subs)
"Takagaki-san, please do an ad-lib for the part where the boobs make the bullets jump"
Takagaki talking about her direction for the henshin scene:
"What manga did those deliquents come from?" lol
Radio time <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
because Yuuki Aoi just puts her entire soul into each one
honestly, the live versions of any Bikki songs beat out the regular ones
and not-ignited G-Beat is my favorite Bikki song already <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I do think they sound *amazing* in all the intros for like 15 seconds but a whole song of crazy instrumentals is not for me
I'm not actually not much of a fan of Ignite versions in general, personally
"In the end, Carol and Hibiki were unable to come to an understanding with each other. As Hibiki's actress, it even came as a shock to me to learn "there are people who aren't willing to join hands"... Of course, at the very end Carol did take Hibiki's hand, but that was actually her father's hand in essence. That's why, my personal take in regards to the fight against Carol, is that we won but also lost at the same time. I always imagine that Hibiki must take time to reflect back on the fact she was unable to join hands with Carol. It's because of that experience that when it came to season 4, her motivation to join hands with others was so strong, that she was able to get through to Saint Germain."
This is from an AXZ interview with Yuuki Aoi:
I don't think you'd be able to have her join without losing that
Carol stands as someone who Hibiki wasn't able to change
but also
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
same and same
I'll ping you when I post
still an amateur at this so it won't be perfect but <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
this reminds me, I subbed the live version, should upload
GENOCIDE
(shame on me for not reading the lyrics sooner, but then again the wiki's version is so fucked up lol)
it's about the last day she's still kinda sane before she's taken over by her revenge, and it basically reads as a mental breakdown almost like a fight between split personalities
Also I got into subbing songs recently and Tomorrow is glorious
"f u I'll die but I'll prove you wrong while I do at least"
even after being defeated twice
Carol sticks to her guns to the very end
it was especially so satisfying after G where none of the villains we directly fought against (the FIS team in that case) had their own convictions and were basically just either being manipulated or had a stroke of really bad writing (Maria <:GWmythicalFeelsSadMan:374568771421208577> )
Carol also my favorite villain <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
everyone in this channel is 55 episodes old
episodes
too bad Bikki busts out the power of hand-holding
but it was really cool
I was expecting it to be related to the labyrinth in the preview because Daedalus myth
Daedalus End was also a super cool attack
it's so <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
she herself got to make Hibiki's wish come true by asking for that performance at the live
Aoi didn't disappoint with the hype
I can't wait
they're saving it
and then we get Bikki repeat
Basa and Bikki drop down
THEY TEASED US
this is how I feel right now
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
the show keeps one-upping itself every week
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I'm definitely stealing it for when my friends catch up to XV <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/590556827901755402.png?v=1
that Bikki expression
he doesn't sing Genocide though <:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
Fudou is a mastermind-type villain like Carol, of course you would <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
since you're a fellow blue man of culture, you understand my wish to see Basa being the coolest <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
just my wish and not anything based on what might happen or not
true, I'm just saying I wish she finds the strength to say "fuck this" and saves everyone in some climactic moment when everyone thinks she's about to switch sides <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
if you kill her say goodbye to the 1% chance of her coming back
remember, Elf has Carol inside her
don't kill Elf! <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
but her coolest moment in season 4 was telling him off
people are saying she'll side with Fudou, or she'll break down
what I really want is for Basa to go against all the odds
so to his plan it's irrelevant
and regardless he 100% knows about Hibiki
but yeah, it's just a small chance
I mean, as long as nobody knows <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
we've been just taking it for granted
I still am not completely sure Fudou knows about Miku
if Bikki wants Noble Red to join them but Basa will probably be against Millaarc
is some genuinely understandable in-fighting
what I'm actually excited if it might happen
nah Ichaival isn't Odin
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/597815129777766450/603236458903633963/6_-_Empress_Rebellion.PNG
"secretly"
was similar to an Odin design I saw in some game or something
and iirc the form she had after breaking out of her shell in divine power mode in AXZ
Gungnir and all
Hibiki is Odin
thanks <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
maybe the solution is simpler than we think
do you think God has ever used electricity
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
the man, the myth, the legend
"we'll have to defeat Custodian Genjuurou by having Tony Glazer use Red Hot Blaze to shoot Beef Stroganoff at him"
wait what was it that I said
I've been calling it since before season start <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Symphogear memes are as numerous as Gen's power level
I never will
Shirabe wtf plz
skirts
yoyos
saws

GX episode 3 still best chart tho
it was just the chart link again but screwed up lol
whoops don't mind
btw, anyone have this episode's reaction chart
or about to
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I think she's throwing up
I don't want to be here
what is happening here
I ain't touching that <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
oh god I'm not ready am I
amazing
I tried to use Prelati emote but I don't have it <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
in-jokes <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
this conversation is going places <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
it's an hallucination
there is no term
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I know I know <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Japan has like 13 versions of its own mythology you can't try and keep up with everything <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so clearly that's the version we're running with
well like I said, in the show it's stated they are blades
tfw all Europeans bows are just [name+bow] or the dumbest name "Fail-not"
darn people 3000 years in the past being slow with inventing things
we should have had mythological missiles dammit
it sounds less cool to have to say "bow" as part of your bow weapon <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
this is stated straight up in the show so the origin is canon
Sumerian goddess of war Zababa's pair of blades
but they probably mean for Chris to have a European relic so
I can think of one Japanese one
there are many bows in mythology
it's because just like Yuuna, Hibiki fights with fists, and as a new weapon she got BIGGER FISTS
oh I saw it on twitter already
no suffering <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
hopefully they don't have side-effects this time
everyone's already made the Mankai comparisons I see
I mean, so can Gen
lol nice
>hands you a movie
that's his power
that means he has slept, eaten and watched more movies than Genjuurou
Fudou is pretty old, right?
meanwhile, I had a revelation
I know but the first experience is special
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I prefer good subs over hype
just watched too since good subs just came out
join the hype
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
same I was saying it earlier but it would be understandable in-fighting if Hibiki's desire to join hands with everyone pissed off Basa who witnessed what she did
possibly with added drama when Basa will flip off cause she won't be able to work with Millaarc
I think it will end up as "the enemy of my enemy" kinda thing
I said that they obviously don't plan to just let Fudou off them once they do their job
I didn't say redeem
they're under Fudou's orders but it's not like they're his allies
Noble Red are in it for themselves
which obviously Fudou wouldn't let them have
*and* she said they need the divine power
and she's clearly smart enough to know they'll just be killed in the end
Vanessa knows they're being used
but Vanessa was clearly planning on backstabbing?
yeah they are
I doubt the rest of the world is on the side of letting Fudou have unlimited power
well, Japan
but honestly I'm afraid of what memes Kaneko has in store
like Carol, I want to watch the world burn
I know <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
but just *think*
also no
XV ending: Fudou beats everyone but then Dr.Ver shows up to save the world
yes of course, I just mean it's not like the show or Hibiki didn't try <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
and that's why we love her but still
well Carol said "fuck you" to it
I mean, it's the theme of Symphogear that everyone is always just fighting for what they believe in
Millaarc used Mazinger's boomerang
damn the other Yuuna's surname starts with Ta- and for a moment I had it mixed up with Tachibana lol
I mean, it was Hibiki haxx
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I can send you the cat site link if you want <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
it's worth everything
the 2018 is the only one that is completely subbed
you really do
Cypher you need to watch the 2018 Live if you haven't already <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
she has a stand
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
streamable doesn't agree with Discord so separate window <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
<https://streamable.com/3j42k>
sure
it's all thanks to her
because Yuuki Aoi herself asked to do it
tfw the 2018 Live is now plot-relevant
Miku isn't dying
they specifically put the attention on Miku and Hibiki being able to do this, would they just have overlooked Elf if there was a third option? or maybe that's what Kaneko *wants* us to think...
but I guess there's a small chance
I feel like it won't happen because it'd be too technical to explain, if we're being reasonable
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
you think like me, friend
time for theories on if it'll matter or it's just more red herrings <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
...is the same as the distance between Earth and the Moon
lol someone mentioned that the "380,000km"  that the Daedalus labyrinth is wide...
the light rays
Fudou protagonist
it's just one of those "take it as it comes" things
but I also never think about it much
in s1 they clearly took time
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
like this?
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/336297674707828747/603352160146685962/DqO6OBmVAAAMNWJ.jpg?width=923&height=684
wonder if it was just a mistake the first time lol
oh right, I noticed Chris is back to spelling Deth instead of Death
she'd probably be satisfied with that
and it seems to have worked in directing everyone's hate on her only
it's literally her character that she does all the dirty work so the others won't have to
you know what, I'm happy for Millaarc
we'll never know <:Germain:421434126856486912>
I liked it, it was appropriately cool but still not enough to overpower them, which fits with them being weak
finally her turn to fist Hibi-- I mean
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
someone else just got done watching
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
FFIV was literally the first thing that came to mind so
"we made it, now go!" "you mean we have to run for 380,000km?"
there's no way he doesn't realize what the SSJ did
Fudou seems to know way more about relics than most other people too
also thinking about it
probably has haxx
true
I will eat my arm
he definitely hasn't told Hibiki and Miku themselves as far as I can tell
yeah I'd think Gen has enough common sense and knows enough what kinda piece of shit Fudou is that he *might* have kept it secret
Basa no
god that'd be depressing
the original plan was good
so she resorted to Ver
well she was gonna do it herself, Chris blew the thing up
which would be Miku or Hibiki, but if my wild theory that he still doesn't know about Miku is true, maybe Basa? He seems to be obsessed with "the bloodline" and has been taking steps to crush her spirit this season
that Fudou's plan is to use someone who can handle it
more than a twist, I think it's what we all already assume?
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I thought you were saying she uses it to get the scarf back
I don't think Fudou would hand out divine power just by asking
she both said she knows they're just being used (and likely will end up like those other guys) and that she wanted the divine power to turn human again
I mentioned it but it looks like Vanessa was always planning on betraying Fudou
inb4 Miku can bend physics because SSJ removed curse <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
it's possible
I feel like since it's the final season they might do it, and we've seen the new gear from the OP for episode 4
G too with Miku
welp, the duality of man
I feel like it's definitely happening
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
who's expecting different OP visuals starting next episode or the one after
but actually he was just Hibiki's friend <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
yup
good ol' emperor being the grandson of Amaterasu, yup
as someone who studies Japanese literature, I like it when fiction is involved in history <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
history class flashbacks <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
yeah, lots of places speak German-ish languages so that's my only ambiguity
yeah I just assume her to be German
also I knew she was in France because of the palace (that's what she complains about in the pic), I was just wondering if we had any source to Carol's actual homeland that isn't my "her surname sounds German-ish" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and named it after the palace s/he(?) had been in
yeah Prelati helped build Carol's palace
also is there any reason the sisters have been placed at opposite ends of Ukraine
she technically should be Germany right? even if we have no proof
I like Carol complaining about her France placement
<:KirikaSpook:602224871585480776>
I'll go delete myself
lol I didn't notice till I posted
oh shit
why do we have <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367> but not KirikaOYOYO
after XV episode 3
very serious question:
there are plenty
it was "kiri", meaning "ready"
the one that made me lol earlier was they uploaded the Shirabe clip titled "KILL!" but the "kill" part itself is the mistranslation of someone who didn't even have the script, clearly
CR is the biggest mistake in anime
yami ga fukai
it's pretty much Aoi's most famous comment that she spends most of her money on gacha because she has no free time ever and it's the only way she feels accomplished
been a while but I think it was during university iirc?
she says it during the live
Aoi and Minako were schoolmates
did the snake save the world though <:Ver:336656981144109066>
food for thought
Illuminati emblem had a snake on it
we got all of them
Adam
Apple
Eve
I mean
wait I think I said it at some point
if she really has like connections to the custodians like the gauntlet thing was making us believe
and be a new song
but it could just be related to her
sounds familiar to Maria so
also yeah Joe bless you and everyone on the team <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
also end of episode 3: "the Symphogears made through killing a perfect beings" instead of "the Symphogears which defeated a perfect being"
I torrent all my stuff
understandable
oof
basically if you're enough of a Symphogear fan to be in this server and you're watching CR subs what the hell are you doing...... I'd say, but I do understand the rush to join the initial hype
subs: RH Soil Blood
the best one is still having the blood packet with "RH-xxoyle" *written on it* on screen
after episode 1, pretty much every episode has been terrible with tls mistakes
these two things can co-exist
it's obvious Millaarc both really cares for her family and probably doesn't even regret what she did
it's not just black and white
this
didn't stop Kimi Dake ni (which I assume also is, haven't listened to it and won't)
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
god they're going all in with the Basa teases
I got all of AXZ on my hard drive, time to go check <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
she left it behind after she died
it was with Saint-Germain's Spellcaster iirc?
I'm sure a detailed explanation is coming tomorrow
it's similar to Hibiki getting the gold gear in AXZ ep13
we will probably get more details in XV maybe?
short version is just that with the Stone's power inside of them, the gears were able to unlock more of their powers
yeah I 100% expect that to be the final plot element connecting everything
regarding the Fine/Custodians backstory there's so much we've yet to know
yeah, there will definitely be one more element coming into play I think
well, they also didn't already lose 3v1 in the first 4 episodes <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
yeah
and once again
end of AXZ ep4 is when Adam makes his first move
XV ep3 is the first time we see Fudou in the season
just think back to AXZ, ep3 was the first time we heard Adam talk
for like 10 seconds
end of ep3 cliffhanger
they finally did
I mean, we *had* been saying for months they'd just be here to job
honestly, nobody knows what wild ride Symphogear will bring us on
so I expect it to get used exactly once more and her to lose with it
because it'd be weird after this to have her use it while singing different songs
I don't actually expect it to come back more than once again
I'm sure Saint-Germain can provide protection from the cold as well
yes give Bikki more scarfs
(not actually true I think but would be cool)
she turned her scarf into the fists
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Though I do love my walls of text so I read them all <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
it's still mostly stuff you don't *need* to know to enjoy the show anyway
AXZ and s1's have all been translated, which is quite a lot. Less so for G and GX
because Kaneko
some is memes
some of it is worldbuilding that they didn't have time for in the anime
basically extra info that comes out on the official site
keywords should be out tomorrow, I'll translate it if nobody else does <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
but it's actually quite clear
it's a Symphogear finale after all
it's easy to lose the information when so much is happening
just watch the timestamp I mentioned whenever you have the time and you'll be fine
or I guess that's the answer
only thing we don't know is why the Rebuild versions look so different now in XV4 compared to AXZ finale
"S2CA Hexa-Conversion"
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
8 mins into AXZ ep13 if you want to check it out
that's also why they had to burn Dainsleif and Ignite Mode, because they wouldn't be able to handle the energy otherwise
but Hibiki does her thing and they all absorb its power
in AXZ ep13 Adam picks up Saint Germain's Spellcaster and shoots the energy at Hibiki
just like Hibiki in G stole DMJii's Zesshou
okay yeah
B-side
the episode title is Miku's song from G
oh boy
MikuScarf
Hibiki can probably do it with those new arms
defeat Custodians by throwing the moon at them
we need the biggest moonfuck yet
this is the finale of finales
ye, it was something like, the guy in the GX shuttle was the senpai of the people on the plane from AXZ ep2
true but also theorizing is fun <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
good ol' Symphovillains revealing their plans only in the last 3 episodes
usually we'd be at this point at like episode 11
at the same time, so much is going on and we still have 9 episodes left
by which I still assume he wanted to destroy the bracelet or something
I think the alchs in ep 1 were saying he wanted to destroy the power inside the coffin
okay the *good* villains
yeah, I assume the coffin was just gonna be another step in his plan probably because of the bracelet
it's full both of Sympho dumbness but also of Sympho spirit
I think the Amalgam keyword is my new favorite keyword
tfw I won't get my tl bashed by YT
I actually had a smart idea on how to post it without a wall of text but I guess it's fine then <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I can tell this guy's gonna be a riot
best preview pic yet btw
*dato shite mo <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
if YT's also translating I'll just leave it be cause their version will probably be better
it's a huge wall of text lol
should I post it
so uhh I translated it all
don't know why I couldn't think of that, but it sounds very right
oh Emerge is a good one
but I wonder what we should call the... "Image" state?
oh okay I think I get it
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
there is one line I really don't know how to translate
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I see why, they had to fit an actual irl scientific medical explanation to validate this stuff
and lol, the Amalgam keyword is like 3 times as long as anything else
I think it's the first time for the latter two
oh the new interview is Gen, Ogawa, Tomosato and Fujitaka
Hibiki not trying to sympathize with the villains at least somewhat would be bad writing
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Basa good at killing her own emotions <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
reminder in s1 Fine killed way more people through Noise attacks and even rejected Hibiki's last offer by *trying to pull the moon down to destroy the planet* out of anger, and Hibiki was still like "hope you can make the world a better place when you reincarnate"
I do expect the Tsubasa thing to bring discord with Hibiki's way of doing things
I mean, Fudou probably doesn't give a shit about Noble Red
they don't need to worry about what roles the surviving characters will play in future seasons
and this is the final season, it's the perfect time
this time they'll finally be actual allies
SG trio: connected but they died
Carol: couldn't connect with
it's the only way this makes narrative sense
whether they *all* make it is another story
I 100% believe not all of Noble Red is dying
they should just be able to use it at will
Amalgam I mean
it's been "unlocked" now
I think the stand power is a one-off thing and from now on we won't see stands
specifically Saint-Germain's Spellcaster in fact
basically Amalgam is happening because of the Lapis infused in the Symphogears
I don't think we'll see stands again
it's trade-offs
you can either go full defense (the golden shield) or full offense though
In terms of utility, Amalgam is kind of a power upgrade in the same way Ignite was, just works differently
while I do enjoy those, I'm actually the type who'd probably like the anime more if it was all the characters sitting down and talking about themselves more lol
but it almost never gets screentime because hype fights
there is so much in Sympho characters
the real reason I want SoL is to expand everyone's characters like that
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
clearly it's a sign
only three characters who have all duetted with one another
I do accept BasaChrisMaria though <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
it's suffering
I still prefer BasaChris over that <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
wait
I'm sure Basa can live happily with Kanade after XV <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
"pass me on your way to hell"
her song in AXZ goes like "if I meet Buddha I'll kill Buddha"
Basa has the best lines
I'd be satisfied with a SoL spinoff of characters having happy lives <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
it's only because of Nana Wills It that we made it this far
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
yes
he passed a law specifically to be able to command the government defenses in "emergencies" without having it go through official means
that's Fudou's special squad basically
just brought it up cause I recall people mentioning it was weird they were totally fine with killing them
yeah that's why I said I don't know
well SG didn't know
Cagliostro's dialogue in ep8 sounds completely different too on a rewatch when you know what she's actually planning
I could see that
I still wonder if in AXZ the lack of reaction to Cagliostro/Prelati's "deaths" is supposed to be a hint they're still alive
I, for one, am excited we seem to be getting another Basa/Millaarc confrontation soon (unless the preview pics are deceiving us)
Fudou is so evil, he likes Dr. Ver
He's so evil he buys all the physical copies just to throw them away
yeah can't think of any
hmm
in all of Symphogear?
dammit, he's the one putting all the "1" scores on anime episode threads
good job everybody, we've given birth to a new meme
Fudou is so evil, he tells you to do your job then stops you with an armed squad pointing at your head
so it checks out
nah that's not being evil, it's just being anti-American
<:GWmythiMonkaT:407618804592541696>
oof this one triggers me
Fudou probably reserves entire theaters to himself to watch new movies
this conversation went places
he read the script
that's why he stayed ahead of everyone
genius
"back in MY days, the Americans were the enemies!"
and starts telling stories
I just imagine in the middle of the afternoon he calls a random one of his subordinates to his room
real time
that's a day in Fudou's life
before season finale, we need a 24 hour OVA
yes
but with the cast bloat starting in G that started being impossible
S1 had a lot of seeing just the characters be themselves
this is why S1 is still near the top for me
yeah
not in a meta sense, but physically
Gen can't die, we all know that
let me try
I, uh, think I did it
don't worry about it
yeah
unless you go galaxy brain and add together all the frames where each part of the characters is visible
better just to wait for the nced
right
oh
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
does anyone have a stitch of the part in the ED where the main 6 are walking while raising their fists?
Fudou is so evil, he's plotting to conquer the Earth for "muh Japan" by using divine powers
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
that's like 23 volumes in, I haven't even read that part lol
Index stops being anything that's not an excuse to cockblock harem-y moments after the 2nd arc
there's not even a comparison there
Miku has character
plz
so
and the preview mentions something being kept hidden
"The secret in the bag", literally
Miku's B-side from G
yes
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Maria's most likely safe just because we have unexplained backstory stuff for her
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
same <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
ninryu I think this every time, but your pfp gives me life
that is for every episode
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
many times in fact
#SAKIMORI is a meme in the JP community too <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
the only correct term
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I've been saying it for two weeks now
Sentinels? Surely you mean Defenderz <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
CR in two hours, good subs eventually
was an experience
I did a marathon of the radio shortly after I got done watching AXZ lol
(and neither have they played Kimi Dake ni, thankfully)
they don't play B-sides until they're actually out usually
no it's just the A-side they're playing
first time on the radio
next week's guest is Fujitaka <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Symphogear da yo <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
oh here's the story posted earlier in the other channel <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
but then Takagaki was like "wait is that alright for a 7-yo? Chris' songs all say stuff like 'go to hell!'"
and at first they were touched
lol they got a letter about someone saying their 7-yo son started singing Symphogear songs a lot
like the sneeze joke
lots of things were born in the radio lol
your message synced up with a "Ice = Ai(s) = Love" pun and I'm dying
meanwhile, they were talking about how they can't imagine the end of Symphogear and said it should continue as long as Sazae-san <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
prepare for lots of weird Takagaki puns too <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
people still tell legends of Re-yakiniku-Day
every time
they do a different one of this
I WANNA EAT ICE CREAM
you can listen to the latest episode there
<https://hibiki-radio.jp/description/symphogear/detail>
not enough time to finish listening before the raw <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
I don't do the seiyuu justice through text
don't worry I understand, the radio is super entertaining <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Iguchi:".....wait, maybe then Miku would have appeared instead! reeeee"
Takagaki:"It's really amazing... if Ao-chan hadn't asked for the duet at the live this development wouldn't even have happened!"
Miku impersonation: "I see... you had a duet with Saint-Germain again... Hibiki.... *I'm watching*"
Iguchi: "(after Daedalus End) but then in front of her appeared... Miku...."
Takagaki: "No, it was Saint-Germain"
during episode summary:
Ayahi making fun of Youko like usual (specifically about her English this time)  and then "I'm worried, what if the agency complains about this?"
Igu-chan: "Don't worry, they'll probably tell you to do it more"
apparently Kaneko brought everyone in the studio ice cream <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
oh actually I'm dumb the radio comes out on Friday so I'm really late <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
that first
oh actually new radio should be out
anyway, time to hide this channel away, have fun with the episode <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
no there's a package in the same episode too I believe
I mean, there is literally text on-screen with the correct name
that's basically what I do every week <:Ver:336656981144109066>
and I liked the use of fire/phoenix imagery too
this one had a different charm and was really great
I like quick sword techniques too but AXZ did well enough on that
I like that it was a different direction
was great as expected
every line, every movement, you can feel it
and the animation step-up this season too
Nana sells it so well
someone make the Basa suffering stop plz
...on the other hand
and Hibiki being Hibiki too <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
funny jiis
Radio jokes! Chris impersonating Elf, Miku doing the chossei!
Elfnein song! <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
I'll start with the happy stuff
but Basa is based
I'm not sure appreciate is the right word
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
alright, so this is a weekly occurrence already but let me:
it's actually hilarious
god I didn't catch that Basa expression on the first time through
meanwhile, zoid has literally been reading a mythology book on the Anunnaki to come up with theories and it's fascinating
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
it's in his bio on the site
it's his nickname from his police days
the bait
lol
https://twitter.com/zoidzero1/status/1157505471919489029
I vote for this one, it's pretty perfect
wondering if a real person was gonna pop up dead any second
Tsubasa fighting should have been hype (and it still was) but it was more scary than anything else
I went back to check others' reaction and yeah, someone described my feelings exactly
I almost forgot about this lol thanks for posting
well, 40 seconds less
bless you <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
I assume a streamable link will pop up for that eventually
also I was more looking for 'only' the henshin sequence, but thanks regardless <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I won't look at the comment section <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
anyone have a decent link to Basa henshin btw
still only a very low chance of this being the case, just it would be amusing if it turned out to be right <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
and inb4 the investigation they did is what lets him find out about her instead
I mentioned how there was a slight chance Fudou didn't know about Miku because Gen could be smart enough to hide that info. Now there are holes all over the place on this theory, but given that Millaarc only wanted Elf and not Miku it's possible
but hey, my fringe theory is gaining steam
I'm definitely betting on the former though
it definitely isn't Miku, but it *could* be [off-screen character]
...Millaarc killed the officer didn't she
Finally, last thing I didn't mention: the ending
Fudou's plan was specifically made to screw her over, too. She really got the short straw
that's the biggest thing
and she properly talked about her feelings
now that she did have free time she did go to karaoke, even if she couldn't quite enjoy it
they didn't go full edge (aside from the illusions part which is justified)
back on Basa, I do like how they're handling her a lot
I don't Pokemon so I had to google that word just now, so I'd say no <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
^^
I can forgive them, nobody will notice while watching and it doesn't take away from anything
they changed the mouthflap to fit the songs, nothing to see here
and the writer having a stroke in the middle of thinking how to deliver the message
the problem was Maria/Nastassja
meme man was perfectly fine in Linker arc
Kuno Misaki is so good
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
with Elfnein this makes it the... third time? we cover a song older than 50 years on Symphogear
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I just need Fudou to die of old age in the middle of the climax
A sturdy sword will not break easily <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Apparently Aoi wanted to play a female role once
and got it
cause he auditioned for it
yeah <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
oh my bad I thought you were talking about seiyuu
well that's only Nana who writes the OP
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
and every time someone new joins the cast they have to be like "don't worry, it's tough but it's not scary!"
I don't know the details but basically they were talking about how many times they get asked by fellow seiyuu "hey isn't recording for Symphogear really hard? how do you do that?"
oh? this is something Aoi mentioned during the AXZ preview screening if I recall
it's a generic power fantasy
copying something like SAO is easy, because there's so little substance to it
Symphogear is like a legend in the voice acting industry because of what the main cast does lol
Geah is insane how do you copy that
good adaptations of good LNs are *really* rare
adaptations of good LNs are rare
good LNs aren't rare
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
lots of good LNs
there are
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
too bad it's always the bad LNs that get adapted
I'm just gonna shill AdaShima quickly because it's a great LN and everyone should be reading it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
we all know it's Tony Glazer on his weekly stroll in Japan
make this stop <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
I can taste the suffering
and holy damn the voice acting for Tsubasa's breaths at the end
I was rewatching the fight to read the song lyrics
https://streamable.com/9palx
oh hey, I found a henshin-only streamable
I only had to do it once so it was easier but I did suffer from a random pc self-reboot at hour 4/6 of the muxing process <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
I actually kinda subbed the variety portion of the G live for my friends, but that's how I discovered I'm not good at subbing unscripted things so those subs are now in the trash <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
disgusting, I can only watch 1080p <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
10 GB is the result of cutting one of them and the loss of quality due to muxing into an mp4 while burning in the subs
because it's two angles
original raw is 28 GB
you think that's oh geez <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
missing Igu-chan tho <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
best fanart
I'm sure they didn't wanna have him worrying about the boobs in the middle of singing lol
he tried his best
I've been working my way through my groupwatch with friends and the link's only gonna stay up till after we watch it ourselves
anyway, enjoy that live while you can, Sympho and everyone else
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
<:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
Singin' Hood
and even more for Utazukin, such a cute voice
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XofpttTMZqT6oA2AFBcpseg12qXLkUPq/view?usp=sharing>
yes <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I happen to have a link to the fully subbed 2018 Live concert right now
10/10 character interactions, need more episodes
Live concerts are still the best part of Geah
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
not remembering Nana is a sin punishable with death, be careful
as someone who does pay attention, I can't recall any other cases off the top of my head either
kirikabrain
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
or did you
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
you said that backwards
I didn't know while watching either, but I went to check around episode... 4? during a break and I was stunned too lol
live performance of Shitou -Ewigkeit- is hnng
and I guess he did better than anyone else in the audition
I'm sure they'll release it, it's more money for them
Carol also did one of those
it's a cover of a 50 year-old song
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
ninryu did you enjoy <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585> song
too soon <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
god hearing her panting after her last attack is *painful*
which to me is more important than the plot itself
not a lot to move the plot, but we really got a sense of what Basa is going through
I held my breath throughout that entire scene
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
because she's a vampire
Inorin does mention she had zero experience with big bad roles before Carol so she was very nervous when she got the role
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> 
The knowingly suffering popstar
yeah <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I went to do research because I like Carol so much <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980> so I'm re-listening to the one time she was a guest on the radio
she was still a regular because she played many bit roles like "Researcher" or "Girl" though <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
actual quote is "for season 1 I auditioned for various characters, such as Hibiki"
I don't know if she talks about it anywhere else, I only heard it in the 2016 live
just didn't get them
Inorin auditioned for various roles both in s1 and s2
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
but then she sings her karaoke song again instead
Genocide instrumentals will start playing
yes and that's why I'm terrified of getting spoiled on Kimi Dake ni <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
clearly they're releasing Elf CD in the middle <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
thanks <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
when was the Basa CD release?
I've found some stuff on mandarake but the billion "this item might be fuckin destroyed" warnings are scary <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
me neither really, there's this yearly convention where I picked up some stuff, but it's like one thing I manage to find per year
like, now
gonna need to check this out
bought online?
holy that's super nice
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/234523214372405249/572125584000286720/IMG_20190428_201734.jpg
potato quality but
you do
only Nanoha fig I have is of all things a Movie the 2nd Reinforce I found at a local convention
tell me more
bought a bunch of things from them
and yeah Banpresto is the best, good quality and cheap
the best I can find right now is a 60 bucks Basa
...I commend you for actually buying that
some sites with the Chris nendo in stock have it at 150+€ lol
online with the shipping it's <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
same <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
well, unlike everyone else who was battling for their own ideals, Vanessa&co. are with Fudou just because it's the only way for them to stay alive
I'll decide what to do after sleeping on it, thanks for the help <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
also uh sorry for turning xv channel into a Nanoha figure hunt lol
I found NanoFate Nendos at 1200 yen each, with shipping that's probably about... 30€ each?
yeah I know it's just a business thing thankfully
meanwhile I still really want a Basa becomes a pro racer spinoff like she dreams in that one XDU 4-koma
or even 1st G one
I think the 2nd G one but don't quote me on this
it's just like Millaarc's ability
Basa can't help herself if she sees a bike <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
nobody's issues get solved in that show
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993> 🚲
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
or a month
sometimes people get their copies early because scheduling is a mess
and yeah pre-ordering does that
it's not unheard of
some stores get them early sometimes
this one is alright but still not at that level
the only Maria song that really clicks with me is Ginwan Airgetlamh
I honestly don't think it would have a negative effect
And I wish we didn't <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but I obviously don't lurk deep in JP sites
Most JP fans I've seen aren't like that at least
that's an apt comparison lol
anyone who says they're not gay is either being a troll, or an idiot, pardon
I don't think there is to be honest
and let's not get started on Waikyou Shenshoujing lol
and even in the main series DMJii say I love you to each other, hold hands going to school, and their songs are explicitely about kissing each other
there's like the scene in one of the OVAs where Miku specifically says she'll try to conquer Hibiki's heart with food
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
but they are explicitely attracted to one another
also whoops not the right place to discuss this <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
yeah but ||Fate handles him specifically||
or am I forgetting something
tbf, there are zero male opponents Nanoha deals with?
s1 plot can be summed up as Nanoha gets stronger until she can blow up her opponent to become her friend
that is entirely correct
if your answer is a no you're about to blow up
Nanoha asks once first
I'm waiting till XV is over for B-sides
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I haven't listened to Happy Birthday don't say anything
well it's not like you are "forced" but nobody would get extra stuff if there wasn't something interesting being told in it
and yeah Kirika B-sides that are not Happy Smile Vacation are pretty depressing
tbh, Geah puts enough suffering onto Hibiki I'm not sure she's happy in the majority of her screentime
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I have been her in some of her stories
Arisa hits way too close to home for me <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
yeah of course, having more depth and it being well realized are different things
I might have made a 30 line essay on Arisa over in a Bandori server
ninryu good taste
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I tend to think of characters (the ones in more 'serious' anime at least) as people who just live in a different world, so the ones with no flaws or depth fall really flat for me
yeah
~~all the seasonal waifus are bad anyway~~
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
Have you seen someone shoot 10 missiles from their clothes?
<:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
Most people who use the term is just a shorthand for "I really like the character" anyway
I know *why* it exists, I just... don't comprehend it? Like, in the sense I don't know what it *means* for someone to think a character is their waifu. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
:HibikiOraOra:
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I'm happy with my inability to "objectify/waifu/whatever" any fictional character
eh
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I will never understand the concept of "waifu" in the first place so
I'm sure everything can be a waifu if you try hard enough
good anime <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
the "we make it obvious but not explicit" thing
because so many shows have done it, more shows keep doing it
I feel like it's more of a culture thing at this point
for every fan out there crazy enough to be mad at something like that, there'd be 5 happy that the show went through with it
people are too pessimistic about it
NoWaYu is the best part of the franchise too
most people won't go read
yeah, I meant officially
oh wait no Nitro, can't post over 8MB <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
ninryu I've edited every ED to have the lead-in, want it?
we just get the short end of the stick cause no translation
the thing about Yuuki Yuuna LN is that it was a multimedia project from the start, you are *meant* to experience both LN and anime
I meant more the 3 SoL VNs
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
that's the Yuuki Yuuna way
basically, let's all learn Japanese <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
actually since I brought up Nanoha, it's worse there because 90% of the side material is one hour-long drama CDs. Which while as a JP fan you can just enjoy normally, for me it meant staring at a bad translation of it
(not that I wouldn't anyway though <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> )
Like, I watch all episodes twice already because the second time through I read the lyrics
For songs the fault is also partly because of the language barrier
I think they're just as important but well, people's opinions vary
B-sides can be argued
Every song that appears in the show definitely is
nice
I'm just trying to say there is also value in experiencing that extra stuff that doesn't detract from it not being in the main show
Like, if somebody says "oh but this is explained here" it would still be a fault of the source if it didn't show it well
I understand, it's entirely fair to judge something only through what is shown in the main source.
I listened to all the Sympho Radio just to get all the references
and yes, same lol
that's how it should be
Nanoha also has lots of "out of narrative" elements and only like 5% of the western fandom goes through it, and it doesn't really impact the main narrative
but well, definitions are subjective
She's very energetic, more than Hibiki I think
how to say, the fact that Kirika's ultra-genkiness is kind of a facade is already shown in the show, but the songs go into more detail about it
I think that in general, extra material can tell you stuff that is not in the show and it should be fine, as long as the show is still good and complete without those extra bits
only one hour
they're the only ones who figured out the day doesn't end till you sleep
yeah, Japan lives in the future
aside from that, depends on where you live
2:38 of the next day
I hate French with a passion though
Spanish is... alright
same for Japanese technically
how to scare your foreign students 101
the teacher in our classes there taught as that one
it was when I had a two-weeks school trip to London
oh I got this too lol
yeah I had some good laughs when I found out about it
colonel
I was looking for one with the text too but this is good enough <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

anyone have a version of this pic that isn't really small?
I've seen a few around I think
Yuuki Aoi on Hibiki's B-side (no spoilers, I haven't heard/read the song either): "Well, Hibiki loves everyone, but this song really lets you see that her love for Miku is different, it's special"
when literally all the seiyuu talk about how Hibiki and Miku are married, it's almost Word of God already at this point
I think it's possible <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Not listening to B-side till it's in the show <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
we finally got the Lightning Detective Van! keyword last month lol
I know some anons on /a/ or something translate stuff every now and then
I don't really know the details but I think basically they weren't done by the time AXZ came out and so the focus went on more recent stuff
because it takes time I guess <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
afaik G and GX are the only seasons for which not all keywords have been translated
I use zoid's blog personally
yes
someone remind me, is keyword day today or tomorrow
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
yes
I went from memory just now
it's from one of the early XV radio episodes, I'm gonna see if I can find it so I can check the exact wording
but there is no misinterpreting her words
she likely isn't allowed to say it before the show itself does <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
nothing
I think she straight up said it's the same way Miku loves her, too
going by that void pic
Miku... does not seem dead
also Tsubasa's song is so good but it also fills me with dread <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
oh shit new keys out
AXZ Zesshoushinai 01 specifically
>predicting Symphogear
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
aren't we all born to dess eventually
also lol they were really excited to shout out DAEDALUS END in ep4 because they had seen the G3FA recording and wanted a special move too
Aimi straight-up saying she expected Millaarc to be hated by everyone after episode 2
new interview is with MAO/Aimi/Kana
it was all planned!
which is the same joke for Maria's songs in AXZ
that opening was all like Ready/Lady
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
anyone know what the title means btw?
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
it was introduced in AXZ 12 to fire those tanks at God Bikki
finally there's one more keyword but I actually get 0% of what it's trying to say so <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the "Disaster Prevention Mobilization Law", which lets him use his army as he pleases without needing consent from the government as long as the trouble is relic-related
Fried Shrimp: The design on Elfnein's mug. "It looks like a pigtail, very cute." <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
the song Elf sang
Chateau/Direct Feedback System keywords (mostly the same as in past seasons)
ridiculous backstory for the granny Gen contacted
an update to Fudou's law that actually explains it instead of just dunking on Kirika for not remembering the name
so, today's keys:
oh nice lol
also more hinting at Carol
certainly a whiplash to see these pics while I was reading the ridiculous granny keyword
s1 still has the best character development
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
it boggles the mind how people think G > s1. I know opinions and all that, but I'll never ever understand it
but I could go on about this forever so <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I don't have a problem with the idea itself
the problem in G is that it was *conveyed* extremely poorly, and the point Maria makes an about-face to say "nah Ver's right" makes literally zero sense in the narrative
I don't understand that, it'd be way more interesting to see how they deal with the consequences of Millaarc's actions
man if only I could delete Maria from G
Kirika was emotionally unstable, and also basically a child, Maria's actions in G are dumb and make no sense <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
oh I was actually forgetting, they did go to prison for a while
Miku was mind-controlled so she doesn't really count
Maria's dumbness gets handwaved after G
realizing her mistakes, dealing with the guilt, and then settling things in G
tbh she's the only one who gets a good arc about that
Chris also killed lots of innocents by summoning Noise through Solomon's Cane in early s1
oh I went back to read the interview with the SONG cast, and apparently Ogawa gets to show off sometime
no <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
that's the only one more hinting but well not groundbreaking
and also "please pay attention to the relationship between Noble Red and Fudou, they seem to be dissatisfied with one another"
incredibly vague stuff
"there's a scene later on I really liked"
alright nothing else of much interest in the interview outside of some foreshadowing
all the guests do two episodes in a row
yeah
it's his first time so they're worrying how he'll react to the pun corner lol
oh next week's guest is Fujitaka <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
depending on how old this is it might be from when Iguchi was doing the radio on her own and Nana came as a guest
ooohh they're playing Basa's song
ah yeah
we knew that since ep2
yeah
also they said that even though they aren't released, they have all the adults' ages decided
oh god they're doing a skit after someone asked to imagine what they'd be like in 2045 where Iguchi is playing Ayahi's granddaughter and being like "granny, say chossei! say chossei!"
stop <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
so Kuno offered to do it herself instead but she was like "NO"
apparently on the first take Ayahi overdid the Elf impression and had to redo it
lol
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Ayahinein-san
nice this time I'm not a day late on the radio
I loved the Belka flashback arc though
late Vivid isn't that interesting unfortunately
but I just see it as a way to cap off the series
yeah that was silly
I assume you mean "Vivid"?
oh I didn't know about that <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
they did make one of Nanoha's stomps on the ground literally crack the floor though, pretty badass
not much change otherwise
BDs in Nanoha only fixed stuff in... StrikerS I think?
and honestly outside of the problems they fixed in the BDs it didn't look that bad
(posting this in the right channel this time <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952> )

that line feels like it's referring to Noble Red in the first place
in the 2013 Live Kikuko-san does mention they're the same age
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
I can't unsee Rabe having cat ears in that cover
the guy says "Show me to the ends of the world" since he's not the one in front of the car <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
"I'll show you to the ends of the world!" is the original
it's Utena
this is where the season tagline comes in
this is why I don't watch with bad subs early, I would have hated everything while watching lol
yeah
or google anything, if "Ruru Amel" is anything to go by
whoever is subbing clearly doesn't even look at the footage
it was Elsa saying "Vanessa, Millaarc has come back"
how does shit get approved, I can't believe people are paid for this
lol CR subs having Vanessa say "Vanessa has come back"
that's not how percentages work
"119.6%"
this episode was very much the "let us confirm everything we already know/recap for people who don't remember past season plot points"
lol sorry for disappointing you, I don't have a moment-by-moment reaction today <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
that was honestly the best
I fuckin lost my shit at Ogawa's car chase, 11/10
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
even if I'm increasingly worried for Basa
alright, this week I don't have to scream since it was a slower episode
Gonna try WA once I finish the game I'm playing right now
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
Symphogear is just Wild Arms re-skinned
Chris showing why she's the smartest, got her development in AXZ so she can just be a badass this season
Ogawa car is what I wanted, and Ogawa car is what I got
as expected
reaction chart where
I need the goods
oh right <@87512939107450880>
it lives up to its reputation definitely
I caught that first time through, watched Utena fairly recently after all <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
yeah
SEI WO UKE KASANERU KONO KODOU
where's the part where they rebuild the gears in the final episode by infusing beef stroganoff into it
clearly he must be shady if all his concerts with Tsubasa get attacked and he still is doing well in business
someone who understands the merits of Tony's laugh
Hahahaha
it's him
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
I assume "something corn" with the first part being a brand name
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/609475569188470963.png?v=1
oh wow can I get the source on that gif
Nanoha s1 comes to mind
how about Maria instead <:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
and now End-5
then A to Z/Axis
in GX the "X" was for "ending" since Kaneko originally planned to end it there
comfort Basa like you did Bikki <:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
ChrisBasa still best ship
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
damn it discord
wait
you diss on the :HibikiOraOra: :TsubasaDisgust:
xz
He specifically references the scene in the epilogue where Gen and Yatsuhiro talk about international issues coming up as an example
at first he was opposed but since he started wanting to write more halfway through he changed some bits
he said he's the type to want to properly end things, while Agematsu likes leaving something open for sequels
it probably would have been more ending-ish if Kaneko hadn't changed his mind halfway-through
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
6/10
definitely worst season, had lots of problems in execution. Love Carol though, best villain
ED releases in a week
Nana's official channel also uploaded the MV to yt
Metanoia's been released for a while
the rest is flavor essentially (and more dunking on the US)
Airgetlam keyword tl;dr: "how could a Celtic relic be in in the Middle East?"
exactly why the happy Basa is scary
time to brush up my reading skills
also, fuckin' *huge* keyword on Airgetlamh
time to be in agony for 48 hours
IT FILLS ME WITH FEAR
that's just Millaarc
never seen
what the hell is this
aaaaa pv images out
oh shit didn't even see him lol
Da
Jare
I'm losing it
Still haven't listened to it though
I can't imagine it being for spoiler reasons given Kimi Dake ni was released this early <:MikuSad:336657015961026560> As much as I tried avoiding it, it's impossible not to know what that's about by now
I watched Love Live but it was so forgettable to me outside Nico so I don't actually remember what Eli sounds like at all
"we should all be friends" vs "I'm gonna kill that batgirl"
Hibiki vs Basa is actually where it's at
I'm also biased <:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
Chris can probably relate, too
I really want a Chris/Basa fight because it'd be the opposite of s2
use the Divine Power to regrow only the human parts of their body
and Noble Red basically wants to do the upgraded version of Berserker Hibiki regrowing her arm
how that works (of if we'll even see something like that) I have no idea
so the Divine Power actually is able to create an entire world
also confirmed that nobody knew about Miku being a vessel outside Gen/Elfnein (and probably Ogawa) before the recent inspection
something's *really* wrong
that's why I've been saying, that Basa smile is scary
oh hey Stained Glance full explanation
we basically got a 150% Carol confirmation
real rough tl: "If someone's going to talk about what I swore to kill, I'll destroy it with my 0s and 1s (alchemy). Useless memories that were thrown away reverberate here."
"Things I swore to kill"
is lyrics from Senkin Dur Da Blà
actually the whole thing
which is from <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
just saw 0 and 1
I didn't even read
CAROL
sdnmfjksdfksdfkds
Shul Shagana, Igalima, and "Airgetlam" were found in the Middle East
given Fine's from the Middle East it's basically a huge neon sign saying "HEY IT'S FROM CUSTODIAN TIMES"
but clearly I was being tsundere cause now that it's like 90% confirmed I'm like HEEEEELLL YEEEAAAAAAHHHHHH
unlike everyone else, I was really unsure if I wanted it to happen
but I feel like we'll finally get that Carol re-appearance now
that's very true <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
the first three lines are literally made out of Genocide lyrics
did you see the earlier discussion
I get the feeling this time it'll matter *a lot* <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
considering AXZ had 3+3
It's the final season, I can't see them having only one new duet and one new group song
Well, I'm sure there's probably at least another group song or something
might be bias talking though <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
I mean that to me that sounds very much like we are getting <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980> again
"there are still songs that haven't appeared yet, as well as re-recorded ones"
we are at 200% confirmed
OH BOY
I didn't notice while listening but apparently phrases from every other ED appear in the song
Takagaki wrote it with theme of "I can feel you in this song even when I'm lost"
(of course it's a vague whether he means in-universe farewell, or just between the series and viewers)
apparently Kaneko said:"Since there is a farewell, I want it to be a song that honors encounters"
oh, interesting part about Lasting Song
And the staff said they came to the same conclusion
"I think Chris would understand Tsubasa-san's feelings, so I don't think she'd blame her"
basically they took a few patterns for that scene, and afterwards Takagaki went to the staff and said:
oh this is so sweet
also how she was happily surprised to see Chris reigning in Tsubasa during the ep6 scene <:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
Takagaki talking about AyahiNein in her interview lol
that's why the Bikki vs Basa fight can happen, since Basa wouldn't be in the wrong, but also Hibiki probably wouldn't back down
yes
let it happen
correct
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
yeah don't trust the wiki
so she's almost 17 but not quite
her 17th birthday's in April (not her real one, but still)
that we can agree with
yes
the thing is that since there was no basis for it to start back in GX, I'm still not convinced about it
that's true, XV has been better at it
which is why I really hope they solve the Basa situation in a way that isn't just shipping fuel
I agree with solopy though, Tsubasa & Maria ship started for literally no reason in GX, and they still have no real chemistry other than "Maria has a big crush on her"
lol and now Kenji's like "now is there anyone I can get excited with about Kirika's henshin"
I don't know if that typo was intentional but it's perfect <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the other is from a girl who said she watched it when she was younger with her older sister who told her "you'll get stronger if you sing". And now she's a 2nd year HS student and watches it together with the person she likes (apparently they got really excited at Chris' henshin lol "that was crazy right!?")
one is yet another one woman who got married, but apparently they played a Sympho song at their wedding
awww today's letters are the sweetest thing
I decided not to listen to B-sides till show is over
oh, apparently Chris' B-side is a graduation song <:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
Kenji's getting caught up on all the radio references in the show, from the XV sneeze to AyahiNein <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
- Takagaki Ayahi
THIS IS SYMPHOGEAR
"No, he really just can't see the road"
apparently they asked the staff "...is he trying to encourage them?"
"show me to the ends of the world!"
the Utena reference
so now they were talking about
oh my god lol
I'd assume
oh Kenji's saying apparently in AXZ Hibiki used a technique he did as a protagonist of another show
and now everyone losing it over ninja cars <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Yukachi I don't believe you saying Carol won't appear
everyone talking about how much Chris has grown <:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
and then saw the script <:Ver:336656981144109066>
from what I gathered it's more that the guy was like "an inspector, should probably be a serious role"
they didn't go into detail but I don't think so
and that's how we got what we did lol
"You can probably do whatever you like, hype it up"
"Akabane-kun, what should I do!?"
apparently the guy who played the inspector was like
commenting about how for someone's first time recording Symphogear there's so much stuff going on they won't understand
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
"I watched him suffer"
apparently at some point Kenji got out of saying something really hard and they passed that line onto Ogawa instead
YANTRA SARVAZVA
now that they got into the same talk they do every time with both Ogawa/Elfnein: all the dumb hard techno-babble words they had to say lol
actually two seasons after
yeah, the season after Symphogear aired
he only had 4-5 roles, which probably counts as a newbie
SAO was after s1
she was 18-19 back then, so she was probably finishing high school
apparently back then Setou came to the recordings in school uniform
talking about how both he and Setou (Tomosato's seiyuu) were newbies when the show started in 2012
oh no the infamous girls' fashion talk has eaten up the entire intro
what's Fujitaka got to say
oh totally forgot radio's out, let's go <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
see you people in 24 hours or so
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
first of all, Carol stopping the Stained Glance was cool enough I'd have been satisfied if that was Inorin's only line in the entire season
I feel like rewatching immediately
so uh Cypher where do I begin
braising the steaks is my favorite line of the decade
I love puns, keep at it
YOU WERE INDEED
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
IT HAPPENEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
suddenly ears conversation
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
best autoscorer
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I love Micha's voice more <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592> <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
am pleased
I must say, between "Genocide returns" and "Elfnein battle song", I didn't think we would get a new Inorin song instead
I'll know where to find it <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<@87512939107450880> gave my impressions one by one again this time, scroll up for the start <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
that was always my favorite Autoscorer scene
low-key favorite moment is Elf praising Micha's hands
now that he's 100% sure about it
but he should probably have mentioned "btw they working for my dad yo"
that he doesn't know exactly what's happening or what's their objective
I know what he means
when Gen says "Our enemy is still shrouded in mystery"
I have only one complaint about this ep
I don't think Dur Da Blá's Faust Robe fits as well on child Carol though
am also super excited for <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980> though
am really scared
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
heck, we got TONY GLAZER in the Apple flashback, so that crosses him off
for the Autoscorers, their re-appearance didn't last long but, I understand the "everyone is here" for the final season is cool
am scared <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
sasuga Gen noticing "wtf that ain't Basa at all"
she seemed so happy to be praised for it too
also, somehow Tsubasa is having better teamwork and judgment right now
I noticed that <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
but as you'd expect, no video to follow along
yes
I am galaxy brain and watch Japanese live reactions instead <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
SHINJITSU NO HITO
ep13 spoilers
Carol takes the Divine Power and finally destroys the whole world. The End.
ehh that's basically already how we had it the entirety of AXZ and up till now
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
science
unless whatever Elf's been doing on the DFS gave some progress
I don't think Carol would break the plot anyway cause still zero memories
let us dream
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/431914167826382860/612619095602364425/tsubasa_happy.jpg
she regressed to this
it's like Kerrik said
I think she's really mentally fucked up right now
not really
Carol brought love to an end. Clearly that's why Elf couldn't solve the LiNKER
His AXZ appearance was like the perfect final send-off
But I don't think Ver will be back
sasuga CR
wait what <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Elfnein is great
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
also no bulli
remember, don't believe anything you see anywhere
60 episodes, 10 shorts, and 3 live concerts over the course of 60 days was insane but we did it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
tomorrow we'll finally be caught up <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I have made 4 of my Discord friends watch through the entire series over the last two months
good decision
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'll hold off on an actual rating till season is over cause so much can happen. But everything I wanted to happen is happening so
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
anyway Aya, I encourage you to... get outta here till you watch the anime so you can see for yourself <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367> XV has been 10/10 so far to me
her reason for wanting to fuse at the end of GX was because Elf knew what she'd forgotten
most likely
as they said multiple times
but that was the last one
yes because after the first time she "died" she went into another body which had them backed up
it would go against pretty much everything we established
Carol should not have a memory backup
I mean, as long as we admit bad writing with no explanation into the question literally anything is possible
and you probably can't back up memories in a vacuum
because they said it was her last body
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Millaarc's shoulders are close enough
Elfnein is a treasure
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
I love them!
the coolest hands
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
am dumb
it's pinned in this channel
oh right
they referenced their best scene (Micha's hands scene from the OVAs) which was my favorite moment in the episode
they are based on GX's chara song album covers
two versions for Micha
https://twitter.com/jonnthebest/status/1162818641051750400
I'll be your captain, mateys

plz
delete CR
Kirichan plz
Kerrik please ping for more cute Elf/Micha fanart <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
ooooohhh this is so cute
Micha still best autoscorer <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'd get one
man I feel like the weight of what happened is only sinking in now

<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
<@!263983345669505025> only one comment

bless you for your work <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
DESS
gdi Kirika and her dumb naming
<:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>

is the last word... "taler"?
yes lol
A question for the YT people: how are you supposed to read Kirika's new attack
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
the name-dropping Kanade just makes me scared for Basa's mind state
how about that ninja car
but more imporantly
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
by timeline
probably grandparents or great-grandparents
>gender mattering in Symphogear
she does have (unexpectedly) good grades <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
finally someone who understands the FATE OF THE WORLD is more important than slight embarrassment
not only the owner of the ability itself
Stained Glance can be activated by anyone through a command phrase
yes
Apparently Inorin invited Kaneko personally to her last concert, but he had to keep it a secret because he was afraid it'd be spoilers lol
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
that's why it's the final season
I said it yesterday: Carol destroys the world and that's how all of Symphogear ends
lol nice timing
indeed
until Shirabe decided "fuck this I'm leaving"
I don't think there was a single competent brain cell in FIS
imagine living in a world where you didn't read 4 keywords' worth of Hibiki's summer homework
Fried shrimp <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
there are plenty of memes
Sneeze, Sunglasses
mostly the latter
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
probably
Miku can wield any gear
I see what you're getting at
isn't that also why she was able to use everyone's power at the end of AXZ? Just didn't "steal" them cause that's not what they were trying to do
and yeah she can
and then only because she was freed of the curse
Hibiki could only use Gungnir because of the fusion
That's pretty much canon
everyone went with the flow but it turns out the reason she could do that in the first place was being curse-free
so it'd be surprising either way
and had no proven natural compatibility with anything
I don't remember her line but, Hibiki was purged of the fusion
he's either a genius or a madlad, possibly both
at the very least Kaneko has stated he had the ending planned all along so
so some of them were incorporated into later seasons instead
it's more that there were a lot of concepts planned but they couldn't cram them all into s1
it's more the other seasons which skirt around it
I'm sure the Custodians/Anunnaki were the planned end-game all along
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
100% obviously
and she was also the one to tell Maria "sing you damn idiot" so she probably knew what Apple really was too
apparently Nastassja found out what it was when she was reading the Frontier Wikipedia but then she died
also for what it's worth, aside from the fact that we can already see the model numbers in AXZ, the GX Airget-lamh keyword already mentions it being "shrouded in mystery"
yes
yes in s1 they say stuff like "Ichaival is the second relic" and so on
that's probably why we only got the numbers in AXZ and not before
it's probably just that Kaneko didn't think about it for a while <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
"Basically, it's a pouch" - Prelati's Frog
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Hibiki essentially gave her hope in mankind again
she saved Shirabe post Bikki-development, it makes sense
"oh no Tiki fell to the ocean, time to spend 400 years searching for another plan"
but really Fine and Adam's biggest brain is
causing Gen to take over for Fudou should make Fine a good person by itself <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Fine > Fudou in outsmarting confirmed
I hope XV doesn't come up with a justification <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I still love that being the single unexplained thing in the entire series
happens sometimes you know
gravity stopped working for a bit
7 million feet into the sky in fact
"mutual annihilation" with the Nehushtan armor
destroyed
I'd be into it
Ame no Habamiku
this man has solved the series
"you thought it was Symphogear, but it was me, plot from 4 years later!"
that's exactly what they did <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
what I'm saying is that it's already a fact
but I can't say I'm disappointed with what we got
have them job to the divine power to sell the threat
replay both their henshin but together
and it seemed like the perfect chance
I also thought we'd have DMJii this time cause AXZ 7 was also DMJii duet
still hilarious that literally all of the long-term planning wouldn't have mattered if only she and the Illuminati hadn't accidentally blasted Tiki off into the high seas
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> 'night

puccho hanzaa da
plot twist
diligence and effort <:Germain:421434126856486912>
they canonically practiced pronouncing the Lapis so they wouldn't screw up in the anime
it was SG being all somber about their goal and Cag lightening things up <:Cag:423197445644615711>
"HOW COULD YOU!?"
my favorite is the last AXZ short when they're at karaoke with Chris and the trio, and Hibiki orders food for everyone but forgets only Miku's
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592> you're welcome
they have plenty of Nana content on their channel so it's a goldmine for me <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the subbers here are still the same group who did the 2018 Live
same

also she writes all the OPs and puts so many nice touches in them
there was an episode on her own radio program before XV aired with Hikasa as guest and it was plenty of fun
Nana's pretty into Symphogear
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
aaaa If The World Had A Song really is beautiful

<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
also telephone memes and Miki Shinichirou 11/10
but his inferiority-complex, and relevancy to the overall lore made him fairly compelling to me
and double the main characters too
but unlike Fine, he has 3 other characters who steal the spotlight
Adam kind of suffers from the fact that, just like Fine, he only gets development in the last 3 episodes
I was basically suffering from withdrawals for like 3 months once I finished Nanoha still I started Geah lol
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I liked him a lot <:Ver:336656981144109066>
of course mad scientists are aplenty, but Jail and Ver are similar enough (and Mom is straight up a slightly different Presea) that I can't imagine it wasn't intentional
yup
the villain from Nanoha season 3
the character he's based off of was a much better villain
sasuga Sugita
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
if I actually try to think about his role in the plot my head starts hurting really badly
I do like Ver, but I don't like Ver as a *villain* <:Ver:336656981144109066>
exception made for G, of course
I seem to be in the minority of liking almost all the gear villains
I always loved Carol even while shitting on GX <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
"mastery of the telephone"
yeah that was amazing lol
first time I saw the zesshoushinai where he orders pizza with it I lost it laughing for like 10 minutes

Nana confirmed she's been a Chris-oshi since season 1, praise
updates still aren't out so I'm gonna go listen to Nana's radio instead cause she had Ayahi on last episode
Fine plz save us
I'm scared
oh my god Kenji literally just said "there is one person who hasn't come back yet"
oh no KenjiMiku has joined AyahiNein
YT rejoice, Ayahi went all-in on Garie puns too <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Ayahi re-stating the theme of Lasting Song: since there is a "farewell", highlighting the importance of the meetings and memories made along the way
Yukachi: "I won't forgive you!" on Carol getting a new song <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
more Maria/Hikasa bullying as always <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
he couldn't remember Elsa's name so he just said the "Gance!" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
apparently he and Ishikawa (Gen) got really excited by Minami's performance
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
talking about how the entire staff and cast helped in doing the call during s1e1's Gyakkou no Flugel
he likes Edge Works of Goddess Zababa, nice taste <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
lol "Kuno Misaki no honki"
apparently the reaction to Elf karaoke was "woah she's actually pretty manly" <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
Kenji's talking about how near the beginning he and Setou would think "oh but wouldn't it be cool if us operators got a song too?", but then they saw how amazing all the songs became and got scared <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
time to listen to radio instead
darn they had raised my expectations <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
or maybe I just remember wrong
I think last week it was precisely on time
unacceptable <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
welp they're slightly late today
2 minutes left <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
oh no my pfp Carol is scared by CarolYandere
she looks so good at the end there
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
less than an hour left <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
aw the Autoscorer key references "don't give up on living" with regards to Elf <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I do not envy him <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I mean first they invade his base, then he finds out it's his dad, then some god-like being appears and knocks out their best fighter, he's seeing his oldest daughter go through a slow mental breakdown, he just found out his youngest daughter is planning on fighting in the middle of an enemy base
I like that idea, Maya <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
only two new keywords: Apple and Harmonic Scalpel
but 4 updates to Autoscorer, Chateau, Divine Power, and KOHINATA MIKU
name-dropping Itsuka no Niji, Hana no Omoide too
Carol added to cast page
ooooooooooo
and Hibiki is just "ikehibiki" which I can't tell if it's just saying "Go! Hibiki!" or  if it's a pun
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Basa is "sakimoriZ"
Maria is "shiroganeflame" cause random English?
Chris is "Ashita" from her B-side
DMJii is just Mapputatsu/Buttagiri
for XV I noticed the link names for the album covers are fun
nice <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
because that's when every other season had their title drop
it feels like episode 12
if anybody better at JP than me can help <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
"依り代の少女と捧げられるからであった"
there's one line in the Miku keyword I don't really understand
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
gdi
I spy that Miku/Future wordplay
then he switches plans to hoarding it in his arm cause why not clearly superior being <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
when Tiki becomes huge monster thing he says "I planned to just take it with me"
the thing is Adam didn't want to just become a kaiju, he planned to use it
yeah he could have it
the part about "they strayed from what they wanted" is probably related to whatever Enki did, we should find out eventually
and said the Custodians made humans instead
Adam got discarded cause he was too perfect
that's more the mythology, I'm saying in-universe
could Fudou be the actual original human
but obviously they didn't just create 7 billion people
we know after Adam the Custodians made humans
this fits better
there were already theories about Fudou being a direct descendant but
Fudou made by Custodians theory? <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Symphogear is also made of several crashes, but you always come out on the other side riding a better train somehow
she should still be way stronger than all of Noble Red combined anyway though
She likely does not have centuries worth of memories right now
time for XV to deliver, am I right <:Ver:336656981144109066>
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>

you wear it
That's because Nehushtan is literally an armor
Complete relics don't really transform you
such a good emote
:ikkib:
Metanoia
yeah I noticed that part
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
wait isn't the Rainbow line just the rest of the HibiMiku duet title
Ayahi especially though <:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
they've always been
"starting"? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
(but also this was just a "cover" cause Yukachi did this already some episodes ago)
oh no I mentioned it to some friends I was chatting with and forgot to do so here <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690> are
from what you said, I'm guessing you're not the type to go look at CR afterwards, cause yeah... they've been screwing a lot of stuff up ever since ep2 <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

alright, muting the channel till tomorrow <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
oh and all the Autoscorers' say "Master"
and Carol's covered but I think it's saying something like "no more kiseki (miracles)" <:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
Elf's shirt says "soumen" <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
not mutually exclusive
see you all in a day or so
I also somehow didn't notice #Carol being the 3rd highest trending on twitter lol
thankfully with recs turned off and some self-control I was fine
I was this close to seeing the Elf transformation video before ep7 <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I'm still so happy over how GOOD Carol was
I can't wait
and yeah Kerrik
you can tell it's much brighter in parts on the youtube version they uploaded
easiest example is Hibiki henshin
they have to turn down the lighting somewhat
for TV broadcast
I've said that 5 times this season
this episode was the best yet
I am shook
can only imagine it being even better on BD
yeah that it was awesome
KANEKOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
AND THEEEEEEEEEENNNNNN
AND THEN
I had no idea how it would end
honestly they had me synchronized with Tomosato when she put her hands together
the little cuts to Shirabe and Kirika in the middle of the giant lasers was amazing
the animation was incredible
wtf the X-Drive fight was SO GOOD
we good
also didn't completely take over Elf
didn't die for no reason
and lol someone predicted the "Daedalus End -> lol nope"
she wrecked everyone
Carol was properly handled
this was so good
11/10 what the hell
>screaming in unified language
I just watched ep8
Cypher where are you
coolest moment
last thing about the episode: I screamed out ICCHOKUSEN NIIIIIIIIII together with Hibiki lol
& rice
beat the boss with rice
Voyeur I like your idea
was it just that someone made a mistake when first making this meme
always wondered, why do people spell it with two t's?
with Dur Da Bla this time
oh we also got our seasonal "da to!?" moment
they brought back the fuckin symmetrical docking I can't believe this shit
I *almost* forgot but
also
we've been waiting for this
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
and yeah just get Carol to sing a bit, instant X-Drive for everyone
"the one who stood against the entire world"
I loved everything about Carol this episode
and yeah I lol'd really hard at that
which makes me scared, actually
Tsubasa's been doing surprisingly well
I was wondering where the Goku jokes were coming from
lol I just saw that Miku episode PV
OH SHIT FINAL COMMANDER RELEASED?
just in time <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I actually learned the whole thing like 2 weeks ago, I got a big payoff <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
too busy screaming it together with Bikki to notice if it was
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
oh wait he's gone
hey Cypher
I'd count Kirika figuring out the "master plan" of stealing blood in ep3 as stupidity saving the day <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it doesn't hit you when you see it in AXZ 13 cause you obviously don't know what's coming, but it happens on screen
which makes perfect sense so
nah Amalgam is already explained to be the fusion with SG's Spellcaster
ye that's what I meant
XV already stated "he still was a dipshit for 3 years, not getting back together"
the problem with topdad in GX was that he was forgiven without doing anything pretty much
XV showed that it knows topdad's place so that'd be fine
there are plenty of good Sugita faces in that live
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
they knew
Cypher someone pinged you next to my breakdown
I said it better <:Ver:336656981144109066>
sasugita
but we've had enough
he was a blessing in GX
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
sasuga Japan top artist
and Nana is, well, Nana so of course I'd heard tons of stuff from her before
Hikasa was among the first seiyuu I got to know because K-ON live concerts
she's the ojou-like friend that has the badass moment in GX
you're welcome <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
on the other hand, I'm definitely into all the seiyuu stuff <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
she's like one my top 5 seiyuu together with Ao-chan, Inorin, Kurosawa Tomoyo and Nana
Nao a best
good taste <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
they were unknown names when I checked them out
as in, don't know their roles outside of Gear
I actually don't know any of the Autoscorers' seiyuu
she's the most wholesome seiyuu
can we talk about Touyama Nao
TOUYAMA NAO
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
in a similar way, if I don't forget G happened, it'd be impossible for me to like Maria
yes
anyway just to give my two cents I admit I tend to just pretend that part didn't happen because in a meta way I recognize it's just the writers going overboard for no reason (I dislike most of G's writing)
cause people were too lazy to fill that page
always time to rewatch
finally read lyrics for Final Commander, definitely a Basa song
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
(and as an aside, her insert song is freakin' splendid)
that was a big boost
she was Rem in Re:Zero too so
she's pretty popular definitely
yes
bless Geah for jumpstarting Inorin's career as a singer
but not that widespread specifically in anime
Nana is among the top of the top singers in Japan
I just never checked the singer's name lol
what blew my mind was that I'd been a fripSide fan for quite a long time and I never made the connection with Nanjol
final battle is putting the moon back together... somehow
I mean, the script would have been done way earlier
Kaneko was like a year ahead of the curve writing AXZ Trump
Basa could do it
just saying "fuck this mind control" and overcoming it
still barely hoping for that willpower coming through
Tsubasa seems almost fine right now
mirrors are very resilient didn't you know
SSJ removes impurities, I doubt a god counts as one

<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
why not
SYMPHOSCIENCE
...I think
Shem-Ha used Miku to revive itself basically
what Hibiki turned into is just divine power running rampant on its own because Hibiki can be a "vessel"
no, the opposite
but to take control of her body itself
it's that Shem-Ha isn't trying to become big kaijuu thing
as I understand it
I think the technicalities of language are the problem there
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
would be amazing
I didn't say that Symphogear hasn't had bad writing before <:Ver:336656981144109066>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
join the ride
there are probably other ways to have Fine appear that aren't "we straight up lied"
that would just be dumb and really bad writing so let us hope it doesn't happen
Fine
I expect a meme keyword on copy-pasting next Friday
we've all been doing alchemy this entire time!
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
I'm sure the original 4000 year old Fine's corpse can be around somewhere though <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so not even that's left
Her soul got deleted by Kirika's scythe
don't spoil <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
black shhhh
Shem-ha Miku SoL shinai when
they're also the best part of gear
most series are not fuckin SYMPHOGEAR
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
why stop
if it keeps working
playing through the first Wild Arms now and definitely similar writing
yes
(also I believe what he said is something along the lines of "please believe in the girls")
Kaneko cannot be trusted
now that it's dust
don't see much of a difference
either original Shem-Ha or at least last Shem-Ha reincarnation
inb4 Shem-Ha falls in love with Hibiki <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the producers are the real villains in gacha games <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
and Hibiki as a protagonist as I've heard
we just don't know why precisely
yeah the scene just read like "I'm doing this for the greater good, sorry humans and Fine"
even in actual mythology, Enki's the one who takes away the unified language
no the "jamming" was about mutual understanding most likely
but we saw him activating it
no
but no he seems to have clearly done that on purpose
I'm going to assume we don't get more explanation then "MAGIC" for how the curse is created
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
when they can't in ours <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
disappointed that irrelevant tidbit about Greece being the only surviving government in Europe didn't become relevant <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
don't think it's directly confirmed but from her surname to the writings on the activation thingie from last episode, pretty much everything points to Germany
Germany
humans were like "time to kill each other I guess"
Fine decided to go through with her plans cause after unified language was gone
humanity doomed humanity
and everyone now calls it the Vambrace of Shem-Ha
they said they "found writing on it read as Shem-Ha"
well
yes
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
current Custodian is Fudou clearly
Fine did it
she shouldn't have had the Cane activated yet
that was 2 years earlier
no
no wait
I guess that counts
oh right
what do you mean Chris didn't attack the concert
well I'm not sure Shem-Ha needs to "tactically" retreat
Kerrik get ready to cross off Space on your bingo
even the most likely option, I'd say
just like every Symphovillain
"bye I'm going back to space"
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
just took slight offense at being called the wrong name
at the very least Shem-Ha didn't seem immediately hostile
I just call it tekigousha and expect people to understand me :15min:
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
yes
I've already had to hear 3 different seiyuu hint at this on radio saying something like "HMM I WONDER WHAT WAS UP WITH ENKI"
something happened to him that forced him to do this
we will definitely explore this in the last 5 episodes
well to be precise
IT'S IN SPACE
yes... just like the Chateau am I right
inb4 Ver invented it
so they can probably access it
SONG did say they moved all the blood they need to a secure location
Symphogear
but on the other hand
true
if it doesn't happen I'll be surprised
still waiting for that "380k km labyrinth" to be re-arranged in a straight line so we can run up to the moon btw
Alca-Noise with either alchemy or through Illuminati black market <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Ver with the Cane
is in space
the part that Nastassja was shot up in

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yarr
I don't use CR
same
I would love to see the shitstorm on that <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
what if we actually get the canon HibiMiku we all want and CR subs it as "I really care about you!"
Commie's not as good as YT imo but honestly anything looks like art when compared to CR
I always watch with their subs first
YT used best friend
that's some worthy of my grace shit lol
where "daisuki na hito" (literally "person I love") was translated as "The one I care about"
but then again this is shitty CR
friend is definitely weak
"Best friend" works fine there
no curse, no relics
SSJ beam on the whole planet
and honestly what I want <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
yeah Cypher that's definitely most likely
Basa and Maria are at higher risk of being casualties if the show decides to go that route
we were pretty much expecting this season to be "Miku turns into a god and Hibiki has to get her back" since two years ago, I'm not too worried
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
aw you can't listen to Nana radio directly from the homepage like you can with Sympho radio
we crossed over with Revue Starlight and she used her power as Top Star <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
time to listen to it again
today is the second episode of Ayahi being a guest on Nana's radio
oh shit actually
Nana wills it
I know <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
but now everyone can enjoy Nana saying Chris is best girl <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
if I knew they were going to sub it I wouldn't have gone to bilibili to find it raw darn it <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
they ded
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
that was fixed in BDs
it sneaks up on you how much more grown she looks like
what I really like is how you can tell Miku and Bikki get older
true
though I know some of the QUALITY frames when characters are in the background lol
maybe it's because I watched BDs but I can't even recall s1 animation being that bad
this is fine <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
and yeah I'm scared of anitubers covering geah because I don't trust any anituber ever
if anyone's still deciding whether to watch they won't watch 90 minutes of content
there's like one guy who did a hour and a half long video and dude I respect you but that's not how you convince people <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and putting the shouting into subs
my preferred meme is just shouting angrily at the screen whenever puns come up in something I'm translating
translating jp puns is where the real hell's at <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
especially when the radio has a dedicated pun corner
Also puns are like the thing I love second most in the world, so getting 40 minutes of Ayahi per week is heaven
I feel bad for non-JP speaking fans who will never hear such hits like Fasting Song
this is the best meme Symphogear taught me
<@336930234219888644>

Symphogear content quality: concerts > radio > shinais > actual series <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
everyone calls her Yukachi so <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Iguchi Yuka
15 episodes during GX and then 66 more from AXZ till now
hosted by Yukachi (Miku) and Ayahi (Chris)
the Symphogear radio program
no
but what if I want it now <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Maya I see your OST pick and raise you this one
sasuga
including self-edited versions of the EDs with the intros too
I have pretty much 90% of the songs on my pc too
they're all great
haven't decided yet which one I prefer
actually Metanoia's up there too now
#2 <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Testament best OP fite me
the OP singles come without the intro, but Nana does albums where she titles them "Aufwachen versions" with the intro attached
the version they use as inserts
the OPs with the one minute instrumental intro
"Aufwachen" Futurism is my jam though
Axia and Aufwachen OPs are top tier
I love the Ignite instrumental craziness... for about 20 seconds then it gets old <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
they also said it in XV
end of AXZ
thankfully
felt good in XV to recognize tracks from past seasons
both the zesshou and individual chants are used *a ton*
the OST in e1 when Hibiki is running away with the little girl has all 3 chants in it
and rewatching lets you pick up on so many things
less fights
s1 most memorable to me just because there were more moments to just listen to the OST
yeah
I put it before episode start when groupwatching with my first-timer friends
you mean the instrumental version of the school anthem? that one's also great
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
what I read are usually episode impressions on twitter
haven't seen much speculation about that
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
their reactions are mostly the same as the ones I've seen here
JP fanbase is loving XV
oh, I meant all the seiyuu on 2020 concert puns <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
we need everyone to join in <:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
Ayahi has designated Nana as "not being able to make good puns"-moe
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
the best parts are when either of them *really* like one of the other's puns and just are so sincerely impressed and excited
the last word is Agematsu lol
it was actually because her joke was so bad she and Ayahi laughed at it for 30 seconds straight <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Nana is crying from laughter <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
one fansub group did a few random episodes of the radio cause they're Nana fans, but outside of that nope
it was "tsurugi" <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
she has to make 7 puns off a word they draw
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
oh hell yes Nana put a special pun corner on this episode cause Ayahi
I have managed to remain vaguely ignorant of Kimi Dake ni other than knowing it's super gay
I hope nobody spoils Kaze no Anata ni when it comes out <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
full version soon
they're playing DefenderZ Brand <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
niconico <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
found the raw for the second Nana radio with Ayahi <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's likely one of the instrumental melodies in the background but it's hard to hear in the middle of the epicness of the song <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
same but I have no idea what this one could be
AGEMATSUUUU
I've literally had it on loop for the last day and I haven't noticed anything
get best of both worlds, no Ver in XV but Sugita still makes surprise appearance at the live
radio and (possibly) updates in one hour <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
just Kaneko things I guess
yeah doesn't seem like it's a reference
so yes, Kaneko memeing the community again
with one of them saying "when I first heard it, I wondered "who thought up this line?" As expected it was Kaneko-san"
the comments are all spamming it lol
I don't know the context, but apparently that last line is a big meme
"ah"
you'll get to fight in XV, I believe! <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
meanwhile, lol at Hideo's being Gen punching Fine
he sure did
and then Kaneko just has half of one the shinais
I love how in the staff's Best Of playlist, everyone has one of the most memorable moments (like Agematsu's posted above)
Shem Ha is looking at the moon too so time to bring that back into this
wtf is that keyword about Fudou's thingie lol
Gen is everybody's dad
clearly the title is about Gen
they really wanted to top <:Ver:336656981144109066>
WHAT IS THAT FACEEEEEEE
IS THIS EVEN REAL LIFE
OH MY GOD
F-waado
it's the silly keyword of the week <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but I was just memeing
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
nope
yeah I'll read it soon
Millhi tell me your wisdom about the Fudou insult keyword <:Ver:336656981144109066>
"hell yeah my dad taught me to run away from my problems ever since I was a child! heiki hecchara!" sounds about right
also that the message the show tried to send got muddled to hell and back
he technically "redeemed" himself in GX, but the problem was that it felt shallow as hell cause they just forgave him for everything
yeah
like properly understand these keywords
same, gotta do other stuff first
I also can't wait for the radio jokes about Yukachi's new role
gonna go through it later
today's interview isn't from a seiyuu, but from the director
also known as "Kaneko explanations that don't actually matter cause we'll treat her as if it's Carol"
also yeah it was mentioned but Carol's literally an AI now
for Gen and Fudou to throw down
we're all EXCITED
wdym
awww opening song is congratulations to Ayahi's marriage <:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
alright, radio time <:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
and that it's coming to a head soon
also at the end saying how they tried to show in the past episodes the delicate balance of Basa regaining her footing through focusing on being a sentinel
yeah he said "Hibiki can kill Shem Ha with her fist, but the dilemma will be whether she Hibiki can fight Shem Ha inhabiting Miku's body"
yeah <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
no shit sherlock
tl;dr "uhhh Hibiki will try to save Miku probably"
"I'd like to ask you about the story. [...] what will happen from now on?"
okay Ono did just say Noble Red are the weakest villains
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Germain is great <:Germain:421434126856486912>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
what if your fave character is one of those marines who got killed in G
:15min:
I think we were just talking about battle capabilities there but <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
now DMJii could probably win by themselves
FIS from G might have had trouble with them just because they're at least good at teamwork
yes
that's why they made sure to show how much in a terrible condition they were so you can tell why they lost
also canon that GX Autoscorers are "overwhelmingly stronger" than Noble Red
It's too much to hope for good working conditions in the anime industry, but nice to see Ono is worried about the staff
alright time for interview
lol Yukachi and Ayahi saying the girls doing zesshou is actually a metaphor for the staff working so intensely on the fight's animation
not that impossible for Gen vs Fudou
then Fujisaka and Tomosato being surprised at Fudou's appearance
then a cut to Noble Red
eh, I could totally see Gen appearing on the field being end of first half
Gen won't die <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I'm watching on Sunday, hence the <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
day after tomorrow <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
if Fudou and Gen fight each other for real this is 11/10 plz
hi Kerrik <:Ver:336656981144109066>
oh she's also talking about how she was a HS student when she first recorded for Symphogear
that one Fudou frame already makes it 8/10 at least <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Tomosato
she sounds completely different
I've never heard Setou Asami's normal voice <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
soon(tm)
Yukachi:"Eh? What's this? It's funny... I don't get this at all!"
Aoi in the back :"WOOOOO YAY THIS IS SO FUNNYYYYY"
about the episode PV (Dragonball Miku)
I don't disagree <:Ver:336656981144109066>
...sometimes
they're great
everywhere
on radio
in concerts
in livestreams
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
because
she's making puns with it
kekkon = marriage
kekkon jokes
this is hilarious
"WOOOOOOOOOO"
okay now it's just more being impressed at pun skills
meanwhile, Ayahi talking about how she wrote Lasting Song also with the ep8 ED sequence in mind
stealth Hikasa
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
it was a joke about how she almost broke the equipment
sasuga Maria
cause Hikasa was moving too much during singing and hit the microphone
Yukachi saying she saw the "Condition Red" at the recording studio...
oh lol
they know their fanbase
Yukachi about the cut where you see part of Hibiki's gear being torn apart with all the details: "All the boys who love mecha and hero anime will really like that"
or rather, possible at least
Tomosato and Vanessa talking seems likely
in her words "I thought I was seeing two lovers!"
while Yukachi mentioned that apparently Setou and MAO get along really well, to the point they would sit next to each other and talk, and even wink at each other or something when they sat apart <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
she said she would always help her out in past seasons especially in season 1 when she didn't really know what she was doing
Setou's sad this season she couldn't talk much with Nana
my brain just registered HOLY SHIT TRANSFORMATIONNNN and HOLY SHIT NEW CAROL SONG as two separate things <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah it was
but I really like what I've heard
Basa can be anywhere depending on full version
Carol > Chris > Hibiki > Maria/DMJii so far for me
but also yeah holy shit this is so good
I guess I was too busy being hyped
oh yeah at the end of ep7
if the intro was in the episode I didn't notice over everything that was happening <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that's almost a full minute of intro like the Aufwachens
enjoy

I'll post in here dw <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
I will <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
gotta record this
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
this is glorious
holy shit they're playing Carol's song and I never heard the intro before
thankfully, TopDad saves the day <---- words I never thought I'd say
which is why I was worried about Ver since I would have liked Fine to re-appear but she wasn't in GX
like I said, that conversation was in the context of GX
:15min:
c'mon is it really TopDad if they make him likeable
also I'm sure his appearance won't ruin the story but
Isaac/Izak/choose your spellings
less chance of Fine now though <:GWmythiFeelsBadMan:391321619748093972>
indeed, that's acceptable <:Ver:336656981144109066>
especially since the conversation was about GX
the "one more person yet to re-appear" was TopDad
ffffff it literally just dawned on me
we've been stealing from other series enough already <:Ver:336656981144109066>
basically I can't explain it well but it was the flow of the conversation that makes me almost 100% sure at this point they were talking about this
late reply but wfc, they didn't exactly say "one GX character has yet to come back", but that's just because JP is vague as shit. What was said is "we still have to see that person" in a conversation following up on the Autoscorers' and Carol's return
also what you said is only really true in GX, they were properly separate characters in AXZ
for the others it's hard to unison without Dainsleif
yeah since Igalima and Shul Shagana were built for it
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
Chris ate one
Maria was also complicit in releasing a bunch of noise on those ships
on another note, has the episode preview text been translated yet?
like, I get the general meaning but <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
I actually can't make sense of most of the text because it's written in the usual cryptic way <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
the preview specifically mentions 'sakimori' too
oh my bad habit of not looking properly at furigana'd words
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
and hundreds and fifties are born
more like "we about to fuck off into space and die (lol)"
that wasn't really a battle song either
if it happens it would be something similar to First Love Song
I know
would book end the anime perfectly
though I was thinking it would also be amazing if we finally got Nijiiro no Flugel as a battle song instead
I'm expecting it to come back final episode
holy damn this song is incredible
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
also where did you get this? <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
https://twitter.com/YameteTomete/status/1167571529347084289
time to mute this and come back later
just in time
also, attacked the ship in ep2 with Alca-noise
>trying to kill Elfnein
I don't think Noble Red is 100% irredeemable, but don't treat Elsa like she's not the same as Millaarc and Vanessa
yeah people will warp anything to fit their opinion
she's the one who came up with the landmine plan in ep4 as well
I hope we get a longer version of that instrumental version of Itsuka no Niji that played at the very beginning of the episode
thanks <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
btw, anyone know what the kanji Fudou does with his fingers mean?
I'm all for it
this one really *should* be dead though
rip Yatsuhiro though <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
but HAH to the non-believers who thought Gen would die if he fought Fudou. He came back fine after being piledrive'd from a 100 feet into the ground by him
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
finally caught up with ep 9
(of course then I get jebaited by the contrast between GX1 and the rest of GX but that's another story <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> )
honestly I might have dropped the series after G if I wasn't hoping for the show to get back to s1 last stretch heights
the way she brings around the whole theme of Symphogear contrasting with Hibiki is great
I'd say Fine then for me
that's a good way to see it <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
in anime in general, I mean
because I really like scenes where characters debate their ideologies
the Fine/Hibiki banter at the end of s1 is still the best villain *confrontation* to me
Fine's definitely up there
best villain, best *idea* of a villain, and best execution of a villain are so different <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
honestly I don't know
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
G was really bad with villains
conversely, Elsa is my least favorite in NR, while Millaarc does a much better job of being a villain
saying a villain is a good person who didn't do anything wrong just because they're cute is different
I mean, liking an evil character is fairly commonplace
considering the mess the CR subs are, I understand why
I've only watched this ep from them
oh I see
they did at least fix the "What will you do?" attack card, I lost my shit when I saw a screenshot of that lol
the Maria/Basa conversation is still all wrong
because they just edit rather than remaking from scratch
most mistakes in CR script carried over to Commie's, really
this is all /s anyway
we figured out the ending everybody
>shem-ha revives Kanade for [insert reason]
>Kanade accidentally hits shem-ha with the spear while turning around
>"whoops"
I won't be surprised if that ending was Shem-Ha sending a signal to other Custodians to come have a tea party or some other ridiculous shit <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and cliffhangers could mean literally anything in Symphogear
though part of me will be sad we're not getting them to make their labyrinth into a staircase to the moon
for story reasons I hope they're mostly dead
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
though now that won't be the case
yeah I thought there was a chance Kaze no Anata ni might have played on the Basa arc resolution episode
as much as I can anyway
keeping myself in the dark about the rest
since well, after ep9 I could guess what it was about
this is the only one I've listened to for now
why did I ask <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
ah, JP lyrics are fine too
speaking of Basa's songs, anyone know where to find the lyrics?
~~totally not waiting on YTT's ep9 cause I'm not confident tl'ing the start of the second verse myself~~
won't be done for a day or so though
been working on something cool
we're getting Zababa
IT'S OUT
https://twitter.com/SYMPHOGEAR/status/1169905807200145409
main sympho twitter interns are sleeping
oh okay just Defender'Z Brand
oh no they're gonna play Kaze no Anata ni <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
why every time I'm actually here at 11 the previews are late <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
because she's really funny
her favorite character is Chris
Setou is finding out right now about ChrisNein being a joke from the radio <:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
<:MichaSleepy:586957502306975744>
they're saying they should make Tomosato playable in XDU too since Ogawa is, and her special technique would be "attakai mono douzo" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
hopefully it'll be out by the time I finish listening to the radio
yup <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
10 minutes till radio and previews (hopefully) <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
basically it's like "can't take control of Shem-Ha, but we can take control of Miku and put Shem-Ha in there instead"
the previews must be late because they take the time to make these jokes
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
pffft
to be precise, "Defender's Brand" is used as furigana above "Sentinel's sword" (sakimori no ken)
also the Murakumo is the Defender's brand
keywords are: updates on DFS, Miku and Stained Glance; plus the new ones are Shem-Ha, SSJ's Faust Robe, Model C-96, and the Murakumo
I'd assume
probably helping in the final fight
Zababa is happening
wtf is happening to Hibiki tho <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://symphogear-xv.com/next/next10_zetsubounoshintaisokutei/05@2x.jpg
me at Symphogear every week:
it's just one line saying "everything from the rainbow memories and flower days has already passed"
I DO NOT appreciate the Miku keyword
I'm trying to say here the relevant stuff while reading through
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
we literally got them 10 mins ago <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
not as soon as they come out obviously
during the Maria slap
no I mean
also confirmed that Millaarc being half dead at the time helped in part in breaking the Stained Glance
oh true
I'm assuming the reason for the Faust Robe is that without that Divine Power into a human body just means what happened to Hibiki in AXZ 11-12
so probably Shem-Ha without Faust Robe would be too powerful for Fudou to handle?
but to restrain it actually
isn't there to give the usual powers
Vanessa's Faust Robe
okay so cool
which might be the thing in the ep10 preview
thanks
I'm <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
probably from mythology I assume
oh did we
oh we got a full name for Shem-Ha
inb4 Shem-Ha checking the specs of her wife's body
give more happy Kiri
that one's the best
as they always are
it's pretty much all flavor
last two are about Fudou's gun and sword
Shem-Ha keywords talks about since it was sealed in a coffin, with defense systems, under polar ice, it must mean people *really* did not want it to come back
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
"Everything, from the rainbow days to the flower memories, has already passed."
it's there to restrain Shem-ha's power rather than enhance it
SSJ's Shenshoujing: Vanessa made it using info she stole from the Los Alamos Lab
Miku update: oh no
Stained Glance update: Millaarc being exhausted since last episode was one of the reasons the seal broke easily
Direct Feedback System update: they had to take control of Miku carrying Shem-Ha cause they can't control Shem-Ha directly
ah yeah ofc
want a quick recap?
we've been discussing them
yeah
I don't really get what it says
the last part of the Murakumo keyword is a bit weird
Nana saying how going to Fudou in ep9 was half and half Tsubasa's will as well
just play his death straight and have the aftercredits of the last ep be him waking up in his grave
ohhhhhh Nana interview
I can't imagine he isn't dead just because, well, Kaze no Anata ni
btw, anyone have a link to TV ad for ep9? I can't watch the one on the site cause not available outside JP <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVEEEEEEE
though I'm having trouble deciphering the last 2-3 lines of the Murakumo keyword
apparently next episode the story gets "bigger" whatever that means
Shem-Ha is checking out Hibiki's body, what else
same as usual
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
lol
literally
it's the National Defense Katana - Murakumo
implying it's not the same
"Murakumo has the same name as the legenday sword..."
I think he isn't because the keyword goes out of its way to say
not anymore <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
it could totally be just random trolling <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I still wonder what was up with the giant Fudou punch to Maria though lol
we saw Gen stop Basa's sword with air pressure in s1 and other ridiculous shit, I wouldn't take the arm thing as any proof he's not human
doesn't look like he's standing down in the preview
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
ep2 was Kirika's derpy face at realizing her scythe gets stuck inside the ship's corridors
nah it's been silly things since early on
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
I feel dumb for not noticing myself but the "we can fight together again" in the BasaBikki talk and the "don't let her go alone" at the end are direct references to season 1 episode 3
lol that's amazing
thanks dess <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that reminds me, anyone have the reaction pic for ep10?
if you use a hat as a weapon I will instantly like you more
...also yes
should learn from Adam clearly
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
why does she even have clothes she's full robot now
despite having a fairly big showdown, I could tell they were holding back on this episode. I imagine the last 3 episode are gonna be even crazier than usual
the duet was nice as always <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I'm just gonna assume it's mythology related as well
Kirika's new scythe looked really cool too
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I know, and probably they weren't even thinking about this, but sword and shield usually go together and AXZ had Rabe unison with Basa so it's nice <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
also I love Shirabe's Amalgam design and I like that it's a shield because it makes a pair with Tsubasa
protect this sword
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
already when she thanked Hibiki in the middle of the fight it felt like she was gonna suicide bomb or something
indeed, I'm very thankful
why are they still making me scared about Basa LET HER REST
what
I know I say this every week but
did I just watch
what
~~I believe, dammit~~
we can't ban people for spoiling the ending or we would have to ban everyone who posts fanart of a HibiMiku wedding/kiss <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Adam's arm <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
he says it to Gen, to Basa, to Noble Red, whenever they screw something up
don't recall if it was different this time, but it's usually tl'd as "You have failed"
the second one is Fudou's catchphrase
"Victory is fleeting" iirc
the first one means fleeting, which is what they used
儚き (hakanaki) and 果敢無き (hakanaki)
they couldn't tell the difference between
where they messed up is in Fudou's line to Gen during their fight (kept the same as CR script)
nah that was a separate thing I was saying
it's just Kirika really makes you notice it <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
more sentences end naturally in desu than you think
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I can tell Commie doesn't read the keywords though <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
indeed they do
there are plenty of ways to word things, thanks to English
Commie (mostly) and YT (since ep3) do their own from scratch so
"shireta koto"
how does someone mess up like that
I felt the irony in that line
"I've always known!" --> "You don't know what you're talking about!"
no CR mistranslations
no plz <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
also believing in your own justice is one of the main themes of Symphogear in its entirety
I know, but that doesn't make the dumb grammar better <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
determination to fist is a good meme, but I'd rather have a good translation <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
which is where they actually translated it correctly
and then in GX Hibiki's B-side was "Little Miracle -grip it tight-"
the song was "Seigi wo shinjite, nigirishimete"
it's the same as the title of Hibiki's battle song in G
Believe in Justice and Grip it Tight
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
(Hibiki's B-side)
the most dumb thing about that title is that then in GX itself they translated it right the second time around <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
trusting JP people to know English <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
mistranslations <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
in fact, they had both the shuttle and the atmosphere against them
"one of these must be a switch, nobody makes bricks like these"
This is a anti-Fine wall
tbf, it started with a kick to the stomach
especially for Symphogear where the anime is the main product, it's likely the game's schedule is trying to match up with the anime, not the other way around
mobile games trying to be relevant to what happens in the anime is fairly common
13th of September
normal brain says probably not, just production issues
galaxy brain says we get a HibiMiku OVA on the 7th of November
whoops different quote format <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
> or yourself, or youself, or yourself, or...
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
sword of culture
:kaoru:
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
obviously I couldn't have known the different spelling of the word through hearing it alone otherwise <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
which is how I noticed this
it was one of the keywords for episode 8
yes
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Japanese <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
my family got all the short genes <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:GWcentralPikaLUL:377110562116468766>
maybe less
my mom is like 155cm too
shorter than Cag
I'm proof <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
but then again, bodies made of alchemy
then again, Prelati
the alchemists were european so it makes sense for them to be at the upper hand
like, it couldn't mind control, just vaguely put your mind state in disarray
but her power was incomplete
not about the restriction
oh yeah shit
Elfnein also got hit by the Stained Glance while she was kidnapped so no surprise she figured it out
I'm just saying there are ways to bring her back
nothing right now
I can imagine during the last fight the gears are in space while Carol alone handles stuff on the earth
I'm placing my bets on the Carol personality surviving XV <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
:hibikioraora:
Vanessa can probably do literally anything Kaneko wants her to do now, she was built for it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but now maybe she can
For one, I always enjoy Kerrik's posts <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
given the chara designs, seems unlikely <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
zero fears
https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/ca1yz0/aoi_yuuki_is_going_to_be_the_creator_planner_and/
I think it is a typo too
oh that's true
trust Symphogear to pull out the most obscure of stuff
the first kanji only is different between what this is called in JP and the attack card, so changing "Strife" to "Slice" is correct
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnerotomachia_Poliphili
she looks kinda smug
does <:MikuGay:336656810788388864> count
GX was written to be the last season, but while recording was underway Kaneko started wanting to write more so he left open some things at the end of the last episode
gdi Kaneko
see the ideas are coming together
Symphogear movie recapping season 1 but everyone is voiced by Sugita
maybe we should all make an anime together instead <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>

AI DESU YO
did I hear someone say
then AXZ's B-side for Rabe is a song that answers that letter
in the shinais it's just a joke that it's something too embarrassing for her
it's basically where she wrote her feelings when she thought she was about to get taken over by Fine's soul
it's her B-side song in G, "Tegami" as well as a running joke in the shinais
you know about Kirika's letter?
though I love Defender'Z Brand too
yes give Sakimori no Uta full version plz
2 seasons actually
and I agree, blasphemy <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
G B-side for Kirika, AXZ B-side for Rabe are *the* Letter and the reply
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
why not both
damn it
Ogawa'd?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ninja'd
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I read the lyrics for both Happy Birthday and Kimi ga Nakanai Sekai ni and I'm so <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Happy Birthday no Uta is so good <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
also this time we were blessed with another answer song <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
yeah I love all of them <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
it's hot
turn the sun off <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Rabe finally upgraded to my top tier of favorite characters after listening to Kimi ga Nakanai Sekai ni <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
before she took control
I think Program Shem-Ha is referring to what Fudou was doing in his basement
Song for the World, Sakimori no Uta, and the Flugel remix are <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
this week's keywords are updates on Elsa/Noble Red/Shem Ha + Yggdrasil System and Teleport Gem for the new ones
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
update on time, what's this
Shem-Ha's power is language, the curse fucks up language
Probably through the Curse of Balal? that seems to be what it's leading up to

woah they're playing Cutting Edge on radio and it's another banger intro <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's Airgetlamh
>when a god hears you need a hand
<:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
Nanjol next guest on the radio <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
<:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
I just totally got spooked because I forgot about the extra pic then hovered over the title by accident and suddenly giant arm <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
definitely Airgetlamh, very likely Enki's arm
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the f is that
I forgot about hovering over the title
okay wait
I have the feeling this will be a doozy of an episode because neither the keywords nor the pics really tell us much
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
after copy-paste being alchemy, my understanding of the Shem-Ha keyword is that her power is like changing file extensions at will
technically Vanessa's just a robot now physically
true
just NR were mostly monsters and she was like "might as well finish the job"
but to be precise, I don't think Shem-Ha specifically makes people into monsters
that's actually how I described her ability earlier too <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
true <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
human.exe has been reprogrammed into shemhaservant.exe
also I guess if the others are also Custodians maybe they're just as powerful as her
maybe Enki wasn't alone in fighting her
true <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
don't get spooked hovering over the title like I did <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

sorry I forget the order of the dates is different around the world <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
4th December
XDU one? 12/4
yeah it's not something really used in current grammar
it's a quote from a gospel
"In the beginning was the Word"
all of Shirabe's B-sides are great <:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
just that Joppy seemed to have mistaken it for an Ignite+Amalgam power-up
yeah not saying it wasn't super cool <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's just the lyrics in the song
Ignition isn't Ignite
though I guess Enki is, in fact, pretty much a WA protagonist
just went through that dungeon in Wild Arms the other day
also, Marduk
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
too cool
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
good episode
the ED always starts with WOOOAAAAAHH, but every time we get there I really want to be shouting WHAAAAAATTTT
I don't think we'll get another new group song
just cause the show doesn't spell out characters are in a relationship it doesn't mean that they aren't
eh with regards to Sympho I wouldn't call it baiting
arrested for being too cool
I can dream
surprise 1 hour last episode <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
Chris is the perfect middle ground of all three <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Basa, Hibiki and Shirabe also have the cool factor <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I think when Gen sees her on screen he makes a face or something but the show itself doesn't tell you she's the missing Gear user yet
ah that's also true
it takes 4 more episodes before Ichaival
lol spoilers
when used by Chris it wasn't fused but
Fine used her research on Hibiki who was fused with Gungnir to make it happen
Nehushtan fused with Fine
so basically it was a last push into making her believe that Hibiki really might be able to change things
and Hibiki even forgives her after at the very end she tries to bring the moon down
and during their confrontation Hibiki&co. show again and again the power of their bonds
she had the ideology that "only pain can connect people" because she'd given up hope on humanity
it's not like Fine "reformed" from just a few words
finding the previous time it was mentioned was fairly easy <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
||here's hoping he resurrects Ver in whatever fic he's in||
I will only accept it if the name is exactly what you used <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
god that hurt to read
I don't see her having some test subject hidden in a cave somewhere <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Ryouko is the only one who could make them, so there's pretty much zero chance
it just does whatever it wants
Airgetlamh was always the swiss knife of the gears
I love how they made Basa's 7shitou look like a wing when she wields it to the side
mosquito swatter
dragon gauntlet
"and here we have a shield, which can make a bigger yoyo, which can make a robot clone of Shirabe, and can also combine with a scythe to become a bear trap"
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
she can make her *skirt* into a saw <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I don't really think there's a logic to it
you mean the saws?
and that stuff is very loose anyway, Shul Shagana sure wasn't a pair of yoyos in legend <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
well, she doesn't use a spear at all
no, that's just the philosophical armaments
grandma bikki <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
guess we now know why they used XV as a title early
clearly we should assume this to mean there are less than 8 frames in the episode which aren't spoilers <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ayahi made 7 puns in the first 10 mins, gonna be a good radio episode
we basically got an Enki monologue inside the keyword
Enki keyword is beefy
not that the Symphogears are gone
which is exactly what Shem-Ha/Enki said
it's saying Yggdrasil is restructuring the Earth while the Symphogears aren't there
okay that tl is right but also nothing we didn't know
GT can't be trusted <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
gimme a bit
am trying to make sense of the keywords, Cypher
it had been on my mind but the keyword mentioning it makes me feel like it's relevant
is it just that she can do it because she's in Miku's body which is free from the curse, or is there more to it I wonder
despite the Curse being there to stop Shem-Ha, she's now using Yggdrasil even without releasing it
Also yeah I'd been thinking about this since last week but now the keywords have explicitely stated it:
didn't you hear Maria? the ruins are totally Earth-like environment <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
it's been 4000 years, probably decomposed or something
and so he died alone in that room in the end
but he has to go complete the Balal jammer
he's basically thinking he wants to die next to Fine at least
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's not the same even so
stylized it a bit, but this is Enki's thoughts
"I'm sure she'll be sad to be deprived of her words without having been told anything.
I don't want to see her like that.
I want to go back and tell her the truth.
If I'm dying anyway, then not in this far away place but---
...Even so."
g'night <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
nice timing Millhi
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
oh I was just pinged about this
AI
as literally everyone might have expected, Hikasa's choice for which word represents Maria is
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
seems to have worked slightly too well in Shem-Ha's hands
okay yeah this reads as the Anunnaki's species having reached the end of their evolution so they made Yggdrasil to find out more about how life could proceed
(or click it if on phone)
hover over the title
I wonder if it's something similar to Adam being already perfect and not able to improve/evolve
something about them being  "stuck" and Yggdrasil being made to open the way to their future
The Yggdrasil keyword says something interesting about the nature of the Anunnaki
*smol
I can't make sense of the middle part in Shem-Ha's new keyword <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
actually since they changed the school afterwards, yeah obviously not everyone in hew new school knows
that she's Symphogearing
Her school already knows by the end of season 1
...I recall it being slightly different <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
last one probably will be the tagline just like people were predicting
now it's the entire series
best Sympho meme yet
yeah I'm not counting XV yet when I say "best season"
can't when you're correct
you don't want to be arrested for breaking the Whatever Law <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
please end it well
at least, for now XV has dethroned s1 as my favorite season
still best ep12 ED lean in
here's hoping <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
it proves itself
I like that statement cause it holds true no matter which season you think was the weakest <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
asdasdjhasdhjasdjkasdjkjasdk
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
btw most hilarious thing in the episode was Millaarc being smol the entire time
he's mentioned in the Ogawa family keyword from whatever season it is <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
it's the host name of Ogawa's younger brother, that's common knowledge <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
also they showed Alan on screen I started laughing
it's how cool it was <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that was incredible
I still can't believe s1 tagline came back after 7 years like this
even if she couldn't do much against hacks
also Elfnein being cool <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
I can't fucking believe Alan appeared in this episode
AND THEN
METEORITES FALLING, BURNING, DISAPPEARING
what the hell did I just watch
this time with De La Metalica
I'm wondering if we've actually had a Wild Arms reference every episode now
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ame no Hibikiri you mean
works towards the theme of the series
rethinking about the episode, I like how Shem-Ha's getting screwed over by humanity in its entirety right now
lol
seems to me more like he's the one who didn't want anything to do with the family so they let him do whatever
I... guess you could read it either way
https://i.imgur.com/IV3GsaW.png
let me check
I think he's the one who said "fuck being a ninja"
it isn't
I guess he did quit the family business to be a host <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
why is Ogawa's younger brother called "abandoned dog"
had been looking forward to this ever since the keyword
the Ogawa brothers appearing made my day
ShiraBasa is the biker's ship <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
maybe we can count the <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690> duet
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
oh
(thread)
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
https://twitter.com/zoidzero1/status/1175594003590524929
during the ending montage or something
I actually do think we'll get like a second or so of Ver's grave on screen <:Ver:336656981144109066>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
this season I've only watched Joshikousei outside of Symphogear <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
but Tegami, Sense of Distance, Practice Mode, Draft Folder are so good <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
though I guess I don't really listen to their A-sides because of the duets
all the others are great
the only DMJii song I don't like is Kirika's GX B-side
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
they're so <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
don't sleep on DMJii's B-sides
I have an exam so I won't be home most of the day though <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
new radio/keywords/preview pics are in roughly 3 hours
lol, Inorin saying her new song is cool, but she's embarrassed to sing it in front of people because the part where it goes "My song will cost you dearly" with absolute confidence <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
and the fact that shooting stars were relevant a bunch in s1
given the use of "nagareboshi"
I'm starting to think the tagline for s1 was supposed to be "shooting stars" in correct English
and Kuno as well <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
ooooh Inorin interview
just got back home so I'm catching up on everything
yes lol
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
we have people here who do that
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
they're on the site otherwise
in English nowhere yet
done reading the new keywords, X-Drive was one cool as expected
Tsubasa looks amazing
more Carol is good
previews
just got hooooooooome
btw, is there already a translation for the last episode's nazo?
it was both to Carol and to Inori, apparently <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
Kuno straight up saying the karaoke song is a love song from Elf to Carol
it's just called Burning X-Drive
nothing in the keyword says they are burning their gears
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
also same
same
maybe an epilogue OVA <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
just give me spinoff of Sympho school life
this
just nothing to do with their current X-Drive
I can see the gears disappearing since the opponent's got SSJ, after all
unless you count the repeat of the s1 tagline as "burning"
Railgun was always way better than Index so I'll hold out hope
I see we've finally given up explaining it every time someone new notices it every week <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
https://streamable.com/z6n2u
see you all on the other side
time to mute this channel for the last time
oh right it's time
to be fair, I just googled "symphogear hibiki" and restricted the site to streamable <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Kaneko played me for a fool
...I just realized for 3 months I've been avoiding the slightest *mention* of Kimi Dake Ni and then it wasn't played <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@87512939107450880> whenever you want I'll try and give you a run down of my impressions
I'm still a mess of emotions
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I caved in and just watched the last episode raw
welp everybody
I'm just satisfied with the pure bliss on Basa's face when she saw the Kanaghost
Will check it out as always <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Live, live your life now
YES
"I want Miku for myself"
I still haven't really put down my exact thoughts, so I'll just fanboy about all my favorite moments
I think that exactly because it's a song "for the future", it's alright that Kanade passes her role on
it's alright, we have 2/3 versions with Kanade in it
so good
Ashita e no Flugel
you mean
Carol being the commander of the squad is so good
ALL OF THEM
ALL THE GROUP SONGS
but holy shit was this amazing
since Shem-Ha got done in relatively quickly
I didn't know what to expect after the first half
I'm just getting into it
oh hi Cypher
it was a ride
same
what's everyone's opinion here about the last episode? I'll go back and read the reactions eventually but that's 4 days worth of comments <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the pure joy in Basa's face for the two seconds she got to see Kanade was so good
thank you solo <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
still need to see it
of the last reaction image
anyone got a high quality version
before I go
OH WAIT
alright, it's been lots of fun this whole season discussing things here with everyone <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
nice <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
share <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
(how'd you like that Nana-level pun)
I'm Basa biased so <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
anyway this season's getting a 10/10 from me, congrats on sticking the landing Symphogear
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
after I held off on it for 3 months
alright, I'll go cool off for a bit and then finally listen to Kimi Dake ni
outstanding
well, as expected from Kaneko
wtf was that even
Chris got a stand this episode, it's fine
gdi
didn't notice that <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
...
and yeah happy Fine <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I think it was so effective because they held off so much on Kanade screentime
especially cause Kanade
to be honest that whole part almost got my waterworks going
made me smile
yeah it was good
a small nod in the last episode
*exactly* how I expected Ver to appear in XV
The Ver appearance was
a "book-end" is when a fictional work begins and ends in the same way <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
book-ending with the same poem
yeah
I also assume that she had to make *at least* 7. Even with 8 singers you can just have one of them sit out <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
...Nana Wills It was not just a meme after all
and that all being important
the 7 Symphogears
the 7 songs
last moment realization
I'll be looking forward to rewatching this with subs to read the songs
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Millhi, how was this finale for you <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
11/10
I will take all the Basa happiness I can get
sasuga 7 billion zesshous of phonic gain
I really love how Carol felt like the leader when the 7 of them were fighting
it does
an uncommon usage, but not that rare
oh I see <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
which means "in the direction of"
the e is a particle
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah but you can't just remove
but that's the meaning
I don't actually know if "Wings towards Tomorrow" can be considered correct English <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yes
towards
Kimi Dake ni was even better than expected <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<@!119492161900118018> <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
someone ping me or something when Rikka Ryouran and Angelic Remnant come out <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
okay that explains it
for some reason I thought they were only candidates
oh I see
outstanding
even though the whole point in G is that she wasn't
is Maria actually a descendant of Fine
from Enki and *who*?
Maria is Enki's descendant right
shower thought
...wait a second
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
turns out Shem-Ha did manage to reset time just a bit... Hibiki wakes up post KanadeBasa concert
will we get a Miku bonus song in the BDs
Rewatching the episode, the bgm that plays when Miku shows up with SSJ is very clearly an instrumental version of a song
I just found out Spanish CR actually subbed "Metanoia" with a mirrored "for love" <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
the BD for that is out today right?
speaking of AR
there's Perfect Symphony, Xtreme Vibes, Ashita e no Flugel, and most likely a vocal version of the Miku song that played when she appeared in SSJ
we can now guess at the bonus CDs for BD 5&6
it's killing me inside that I'll need to wait like 5 months for the release
Perfect Symphony is such a good song <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
yeah only week 1
https://twitter.com/zoid9000/status/1179237493025185792
gotta wait till December for the first Shinai <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
it's been fun reading all your posts <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Kerrik, on a complete side-note I wanna say I loved your paragraph about the Metanoia attack <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
BD1 is making huge sales even without including a live ticket <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Carol is actually just the coolest Symphogear character
aside from the shipping, I also mean they showed off their characters well <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
I'm impressed we got a good Elfnein/Carol arc in the middle of everything else happening in XV
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
is the Rikka Ryouran on the wiki the HQ version or the one from the magazine rip?
I need HQ Rikka Ryouran <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
lol apparently then at the after-party once everything was over Agematsu went up to her and was like "Those lyrics were really good, right? <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920> "
Nanjol had to stop halfway through listening to "Kimi ga Nakanai Sekai ni" for the first time cause the lyrics made her cry too much <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
apparently she pointed out a certain shot made her hungry for curry (no, I didn't understand why <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ) during the part where they sing Perfect Symphony, so on the actual take everyone noticed it and starting from Aoi they started laughing
more Hikasa stories on the radio <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the paragraph is mentioning that it's the name the place where Maria's ancestors used to live is now called
I found that too but I don't know how to connect it <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
ニガヨモギ
actually this might not be mythology but I still don't know what it's referring to
someone help
why is there still more obscure mythology in the keywords
Nice to know all the seiyuu gave HibiMiku their blessings after the end of the show <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
Nice interview as always <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
only the yt video has it wrong
wait it's actually spelled correctly in the interview lol
I'm gonna call it Xtreme because <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
also I just noticed now the "Xtream" spelling <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
previews for all the songs <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
I was a bit confused
but I see, I guess it says "another song, 2 in total" then
Miku song is all but guaranteed I think
oh maybe the Shinais will get a new song
*two* more songs?
does BD6 say
wait
of course, he probably never expected to get a s2 in the first place
most of the way there is made up on the spot though
He had the ending planned out since s1
Also I don't think they're hallucinations, if that makes sense? It's just that they saw the people most important to them
I wouldn't hate Maria in G nearly as much otherwise <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But the "real them" are dead. I don't think sudden ghosts to make everything better is good either
I mean, she did
also to be fair it doesn't specify that they saw people who were on their mind, maybe it was totally random! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's just as silly as "hey random ghosts suddenly"
I think you're making too big a deal of this
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
how nice for Chris to be the most emotionally stable Gear
ehh this is just for fun
it says that "it might even be able to show possibilities of 'what could have been'", so now I'm expecting Yggdrasil in XDU <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I don't know enough about XDU but it actually feels like they want to connect this to some future XDU plot
and yes <:Ver:336656981144109066>
this is very much Kaneko flexing with explanations since he doesn't need to connect it to everything anymore <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so basically they had world history in front of them but only saw the people most on their mind for each of them <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Yggdrasil contained the Akashic Records (the entire history of the Earth), the phonic gain from the 7-people song made the Records activate, but since the information density is too huge, everyone only saw a very limited part of it.
keyword text: "What might have been reflected in the eyes of the Adaptors who were present there?"
get prepared for silliness <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the explanation for the "all the dead people are here" moment in the last episode is silly as usual, but I can't say I dislike it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
but everyone was *pinshan* <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
also since they recorded Xtreme Vibes before they even knew what developments led to it, a few of the seiyuu were actually thinking this was all the Gears dying <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I don't play XDU but I'm interested
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
she said that it might appear in XDU, but she doesn't know
and he told her a bit about Kirika's past
tidbit from the radio, apparently Nanjol often goes to Kaneko to ask about the lore not in the anime
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But well, I get what you're saying
Maybe I worded it wrong? I didn't actually get that impression reading it
Hmm, I guess we just have differing opinions on what "actual souls" is? I'm guessing you were thinking that like, Yatsuhiro and Kanade literally came down from heaven and had a nice conversation with Tsubasa. Since there is no actual detail on what happened exactly, I don't see why that can't still be the case
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
meanwhile still no HQ Rikka Ryouran <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
have fun, it's a great concert <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
don't know why I thought it was 17
I just checked
yeah that one
probably lesser quality since it was hardsubbed, hence the lower size
I got the raw off nyaa, didn't use those
since a 17GB download is <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I wanted to show the live to a few friends so I uploaded it on my gdrive as a backup
yeah it was taken down from Dailymotion
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XofpttTMZqT6oA2AFBcpseg12qXLkUPq/view?usp=sharing>
gimme a sec
I actually have it on my Google Drive if you want a link
oh Chad is this about the 2018 live?
it also kept going for the entire 2 years between AXZ and XV
there's still XDU after all
yeah <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
just every two weeks now
they have more episodes
Shem-Ha is a Custodian
plus acquiring the divine power in order to be able to fight her
of course, "uniting" with him as a leader
Adam's entire plan was uniting humanity to fight Shem-Ha
holy hell the new Carol song
we finally have subs which sub the songs in the final ep <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
those are some top tier choices
good show
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
at the very least we should eventually get Kirika's backstory, most likely in some XDU event
what he said is pretty interesting though
Kaneko really did just take HibiMiku question as a chance to make philosophy <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
just remembered, what was the correct tl for "Rikka Ryouran" in the end? I remember the kanji were a mess <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
sasuga Kaneko
yeah it's pretty interesting
time to read
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
Agematsu and Kaneko
wait I didn't know there were two more interviews on the website
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
oh right I think for like 5 seconds
did she, I'm not even sure about that
who would actually think Basa is talking about Hibiki's dad in her line? She hasn't even met him! <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
ah if I wasn't clear, I meant that the episode itself still had mistranslations
better than nothing <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
though they still have a few mistranslations
got a link? <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
bless you <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
the scarf part looks so much cooler <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
there are actually more differences than I thought <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
and Kuno-chan is the cutest
it was great
Miso did you already get to watch it? <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
G is probably Gungnir, just like, well, G
The "X" stood for "end", before Kaneko decided to write two more seasons
also yes Shirabe has 4/4 great B-sides <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
make sure to read the lyrics to the B-sides of course <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
"oh guys I took care of it let's go home"
"SOSHITEEEEEEEE......wait where Shem-Ha at"
actually she totally could have, the problem wasn't memories but Shenshoujing cheat powers
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
and then it ends with Metanoia
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
well, they were just joking <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:GWcentralPikaLUL:377110562116468766>
their last mail also asked for other suggestions, but unfortunately Yukachi/Ayahi's proposal of "Hasegawa Shem-Ha" was rejected
on the sweeter side, someone who'd already had their mail read sometime ago said their new child was born since then and named her Miku <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
also latest radio's mail is hardcore <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592> someone enrolled in the military to be a "sentinel of the country" because they admired Basa
just realized, but wasn't the premiere event supposed to be on BD1? has nobody uploaded it?
just hers? it showed up on Noble Red's head after she "reconstructed" them
on an unrelated note: "The last episode (of the main series)... to sum it up in one phrase, it was Miku and Hibiki's wedding"
the fact that they're dancing around it is what makes me curious <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
involving a character and their seiyuu
it seems like something funny happened
yes
stop making me want it now <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
something happened with a "certain person"
they seem to be hinting at something
oh they recorded the Shinai recently
Yukachi and Ayahi memeing about Ver on radio <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
already did in the right channel
can I post one last one, I put effort into it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ver waited until the last moment to make his appearance <:Ver:336656981144109066>
The radio ran the whole two years between AXZ and XV, I'm sure it won't be a problem
XDU, mails, puns
radio will still go on every two weeks <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I posted some of this a while back while I was listening, but I'd missed some things like the "Yuuki Yuuna" radio name <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

oh hey I'd been wondering how you'd react to Kanade
yeah it was the perfect Ver cut
I can't see him being handled better than that
can you really improve perfection though
like, in the manga both the HibiMiku fight and Chris' face-heel turn converge into the Fine battle
the only way to make a s1 movie is to draw inspiration from the manga and merge a bunch of stuff to cut on time
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>

good taste
same
right, ZokuOwari happened too
and right now I'm watching Sore ga Seiyuu on the side every now and then
I think this year all I watched were Bandori s2 and Utena?
I'm having trouble remembering what I've watched over the past months because I don't follow airing anime lol
also I'm using Handbrake too for my Symphogear rewatch with friends
first time entering this channel, and I chance upon someone watching Nanoha? nice <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
and much better than I expected
very informative
Sore ga Seiyuu
Shirobake but for seiyuu is what I'm watching right now
people are incredible
but seeing the entirety of anime fandom break down over a kiss was fuckin *hilarious*
I didn't like pretty much anything about Franxx from the start
Girlish Number
okay I tried to find the show I like that people talk about the least
oh here's something niche, Yuuki Yuuna
I have a super slice-of-life/magical girl focus in what I watch
Cop Craft I heard is good, might try after exam rush is over
Gridman I tried and it had some stuff I liked but I'm just not into tokusatsu
I never even heard of Fight League <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
I probably won't watch it if I don't have already, but maybe I'll have seen some stuff <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Wolf tell me a bunch of stuff you like
I just enjoy anime that have a decent but not big following, but in different ways/for different reasons
my tastes aren't even unique enough to be fun though
I ask this question every day my friend
if it helps, I don't think what you fear about the character is true
I can't talk about recent anime, the only thing I watched *during* last season was... Utena <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Sorcerer <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I, uhhh, don't recommend Asterisk War at all, but different tastes and all that <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
though ofc opinions may vary
it's written by the author of Oregairu which has fantastic writing so I knew going in I'd like it
and it ends in a character study which I really liked
and anime industry in a way
Girlish Number is mostly a sarcastic, cynical take on the voice acting industry
tbh it's because of Watari Wataru's writing, he literally stole some of the lines I liked the most from the Oregairu novels and put them there, that's cheating
so rare to have such an absolute brat for MC and to have it handled properly
Girlish Number was fun most of the way through, but I really liked it for Chitose
you'll be slightly confused on a few non-relevant things since it happens after the manga's ending, but it pretty much doesn't matter
Strike is hella good though
which means we got an incomplete story for the Vivid anime unfortunately
cause if you didn't know a s2 was planned but then cancelled
also Wolf I hope you're planning to read the manga (at least part of it) after you're done watching?
I'm good at the listening part, which is good for this
true
oh
there are translations for all of it
that's 2 side manga, 2 PSP games and around 20 1-hour long drama CDs
also just like with Symphogear's radio, with Nanoha too I seeked out *all* the side content
we're making that rewatch happen eventually
but basically I could make an essay about anything Nanoha so I'll stop here lol
I think what I liked the most is that even if most of the minor characters got very little spotlight, they made the world feel much bigger. Like that Hayate has her own little clique with Karim/Chrono/Verossa
Hayate shall rise through the ranks and dominate the world
I liked how everyone as a grown-up was pretty different from how they were as a child, but it was still a believable development
lol nice
also because I want to fill myself on positivity to brace myself for Vivid opinions
interested in hearing about it
How did you like the rest of Nanoha? <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I tried out Sakura Quest but wasn't really feeling it unfortunately
stop ruining the anime for people who enjoy it <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
basically a subgenre of SoL in that it doesn't even have much comedy, it's more about putting you in a relaxing mood
words are hard
yeah healing
uhh there's no translation for this, it's like "relaxing"/feel good anime
I've basically heard of it as being the best iyashikei out there, so I'll definitely try it out
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I need to properly watch Aria one day, I keep getting confused at the seasons and giving up <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
thankfully most of them are just side-stories (even if really good ones sometimes), but there was one after StrikerS which is pretty much part of the main story, and that's also where that girl Vivio visits in the hospital is introduced
unlike in the west where we never get those, in Japan they're pretty much free (since they usually come with the BDs, which is most of the anime sales) so they just kinda assume you know
if you ever wonder where something Nanoha is explained, that's the answer
<@173112001684439040> dRaMa CdS
Einhard has her new ~~girl~~friend and everything
you'll have noticed Strike happens around a year after Vivid
the best two fights of the manga (imo) happen right after that too which is a shame
yeah that's why
Vivid is only 12 episodes
she's also super cool
Victoria no-selling
and yes Sieg is the best
Vivid doesn't actually play by tournament arc tropes that often, to be fair
imagine Nanoha visiting Earth and suddenly "btw I have a 10yo daughter now"
lol I'm trying to remember if that happens in some side-story
also nice merch Aya <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
you can always count on Nanoha episodes 8 to be awesome
Nice to see you enjoyed Strike <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
what have you already read? <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
lol
the VNs which get popular outside VN fandom are usually the ones like Steins Gate which have some sort of big plot
I'm a pretty big VN fan but most of my favorites are the more standard kind that not many people try out <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
understandable <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
"lecturing you on what to play" lol
Aya what VN was it <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
did I hear VNs <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
you mean mine <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
got back to my GX groupwatch with friends so I'm repping Elf for a bit
oh lol
you missed me asking about the VN talk I missed
yeah <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
not my kind of thing
I actually never read FSN
I see you're into Type Moon stuff
just getting to see adult NanoFate and Hayate hang around is fun
ron's back to tl-ing Vivid Life <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Adachi's getting up there in my all-time favorite characters
I'm reading the Adachi and Shimamura LN and it's soooo good
aww the last Vivid Life chapter was adorable
no Shinju I didn't mean you--

WaSuYu adaptation was really good
I'm still holding out hope for an adaptation <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
ah yeah
which one? "the one thing" doesn't tell me enough <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Her descent into madness and the chapter where she reads the diary from that destroyed supermarket are my favorite parts of the LN
<@468591607332208641> ||Chikageeeeee <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> ||
I know I know <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
don't know how many details they changed from the "source material" once they realized Nanoha was actually gonna be its own franchise
at least in the actual Nanoha-universe
Her mom seems to be a normal person
Ogawa would get along with Nanoha's family
"Fate-chan is nice, don't try to deceive her."
and Nanoha arrives, binds her, and smashes her onto the ground
where Kyrie engages Fate and tries to get her to back off by telling her her backstory
there is one moment in Reflection
even as a child
Nanoha is pretty savage
and not all of them got the proper development
I liked StrikerS' more relaxed pace too, since I like just seeing the characters hang out (I actually wish Symphogear did a bit more of that), but they tried to do a few too many things with the plot
A's is almost unanimously agreed to be the best season <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Nanoha has bad luck with fights with rules, she lost in a similar way to Signum in one of the side-manga <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@304623375706357761> moving the conversation here since <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I spent more hours on Gears of Destiny than I'm willing to admit <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
fun fact is that my favorite Nanoha plot is the only one written by Kaneko <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but yeah happy Nanoha gets to have her dad alive
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
in suffering
Yuushas unite
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Yuyuyu's ending is Symphogear-levels of "how the hell do I explain this plot"
with how detailed the environments are (for a PS2 game), it's hard to think this was all 2D before the remake
Sounds promising <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I started the first Wild Arms (the PS2 remake, to be precise) and around 1-2 hours in the game seems pretty good <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Rikka is pretty much devoid of any substance
It's not that good at all
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
this is 4 hours later and I just realized I posted in the wrong channel
The soundtrack has been really solid so far
I assume it's the same cause this one is pretty epic and has nice whistling too
Miso I haven't even watched GuP but I can tell that's Sumipe
it's by the same producers as G-Senjou but better <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Cypher I recommend Sharin no Kuni if you haven't played it yet <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
teacher's also in the running
I can't even choose a best girl most of them are so good
I've caught up to episode 7 and the show is just so good wth
I have found the greatness that is Joshikousei no Mudazukai
tbh Aki has changed so much she made me doubt recognizing everyone else instead
okay 4/5 of them are grown up now
everyone's so grown up now <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
the entire K-On cast performed K-On songs at the Anisama event
don't exactly know where to post this but
"Wait, you've got the wrong...! Okay, you don't have the wrong idea."
together with the nurse
Waseda is most definitely Waseda-tier
Majo almost up there too
honestly all Wota, Loli, Lily and Yamai are top tier
sword of culture
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
oooooo Fate figures
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
the adaptation is good
oh you already read the manga
it's probably *the* best yuri romance
also yes
yes
weeb points are all that matters <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
between the Imperial March, the amazing Engrish and Stand User [The Bench] this should be entertaining even if it really ends up being trash
I read the first few chapters of OreSuki way back when and dropped it, but the adaptation really elevated the material to another plane of existence entirely
welp I found one anime to watch this season after all!
personally I prefer S1 to M1 but I do understand why people recommend the latter
that oughta do it
it's the Symphogear inspiration
just watch things as they were released <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
tbh it's simple
so <@209896097026408449> you can watch Movie 1 in place of season 1, but watch A's properly <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
some of which is brought up in StrikerS
they cut half the content and main plot points
but Movie 2 isn't interchangeable with season 2
you can make that argument for Movie 1
Wait
I thank him every day for Levi's existence
tfw Kaneko wrote the best Nanoha character
ZENRYOKU ZENKAI
Everyone:"Nanoha... <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289> "
>one Starlight Breaker later
Nanoha:"Fate-chan, it's not good to destroy the buildings, even if they're abandoned"
it's pretty entertaining the whole way through <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
and some sad lines as well <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's somewhat hilarious that they acknowledge the cutting of plot points, with Chrono going "Actually, there was an entire other side to this story..."
Nanoha/Fate/Vivio + the Forwards on movie 1, literally everyone on Movie 2
that is the characters older commenting on the movie
the movies themselves on BD have a commentary track
it might have more vocal tracks than Symphogear <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm just thinking about how every Nanoha drama CD comes with 3 songs each
exactly as I want it to be
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
her design gets better and better through the series
I wouldn't have watched Symphogear if not for Nanoha <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I love the franchise, always happy to see someone get into it
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
basically an excuse to encourage people to buy
they were Bluray bonuses iirc
it's nothing plot relevant, just lots of nice character interactions <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
no, but it has tons of drama CD side-stories <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
when I found out about Sympho keywords I was like "oh I was trained for this" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Nanoha's most similar to Symphogear in the way that half of the content is outside the show itself <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that is the best part <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
still, it was never as bad as Vivid's lengthy hot spring scene
season 1 was a bit bad with that yeah
and every battle does the "clothing damage" thing
Vivid's like, every 2-3 chapters or so
in fact I can't recall anything in season 2 right now
ehhh it's really not much in season 1/2
anime stopped right before getting good cause canned season 2 <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
for one, I did enjoy the Vivid manga though
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the loli fanservice?
while most don't really like Vivid
season 2 is widely considered to be the best part of the franchise
...that is the most out there Nanoha opinion I've ever heard <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
let's agree to disagree <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
they don't even give you time to care about the characters
everything just happens so fast
even the stuff they didn't cut
I think s2 is *way* better than the movie
which was really subtle in the first place
if I had to say, the reason I prefer S1 is cause the movie pretty much cuts out the entirety of Nanoha's character arc
I'm the type to play 50-hour long VNs, a lengthy introduction is par for the course <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but I did like just taking the time to get acquainted with all the main and side characters <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
basically yes
enough that in the movie the first 5 episodes and a half were covered in 20 mins
starts off real slow, then ramps up all at once
s1 pacing *is* wack, but I like it <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
obviously they'd cut ||their own admiral being a traitor|| <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
M2 does have the excuse of being an "in-universe movie" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the commentary for movie 1 and 2, right?
I'll just send you the link, gimme a sec
hence my mistake
that's for the movie itself, the commentary sub is by ron
yeah that
oh wait not ron's
ron's torrent on nyaa should have it
how'd you like it
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
I really came to like every character
I'm up to date with the fan tls, so volume 16 <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
your opinion is valid too <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
more people need to read Konosuba LNs <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
I'm glad even the boys get their time to shine
though honestly I like everyone
Signum and Fate are my favorites <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
good taste <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
btw, favorite character so far?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah
but then again nobody knew the show would take off and become such a huge franchise
like yes, they could have used the first half of the season better
yeah I personally had no problems either
sounds like Sympho was made for him then
ended up being only half-true, but don't regret it <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I did watch Symphogear specifically because I heard it was similar to Nanoha
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
gonna be quite a different experience, but I really liked it nonetheless
so Strikers up next
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
honestly I think the final showdown up to ||Presea's death|| plus the scene on the bridge in the last episode are some of the best moments in the franchise
s1 gets a bad rep, so I'm happy to see someone enjoying it
I'm glad
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
but if you think you'd enjoy it more as a movie, then sure, go for that
you said you had no problems with the early parts of s1 you watched
just watching things as they came out is fine, you can see for yourself if you'd like it
so Ikxi if I had to recommend
also I think s1 has the best climax in the franchise
I personally had no problems with it cause it was my first magical girl show and I was having fun just trying to recognize all the tropes I'd vaguely known <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I do understand the beginning's so slow most people wouldn't enjoy it, unfortunately
clearly the solution is to just watch everything
then again I'm one of the weirdos who likes S1 over M1 too so <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I also think S2 is paced way better than its movie version in general, cause even with the stuff that's cut events are still pretty rushed
never used Commie subs for Nanoha
movie 1/2 I'm guessing
I don't personally agree with all their tl choices but I can guarantee the quality
you can trust them
CSW is someone from the Nanoha server who's been remaking everything from scratch
unfortunately the anime *is* 15 years old, plenty of bad subs to go around
ED is decent too
search for CSW on cat site
the newest release has them
"Scythe Form"
https://i.imgur.com/fSB5war.png
official Nanosubs are *infamous* for how bad they are
I hope it wasn't anything official
which subs did you use
I thought they had good scans there, but maybe not for some chapters
where are you reading it?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but even in a chapter that could be read (and was in fact meant to) before the anime you have the "tl note: she's the character from episode 11!"
they're spoilers for A's itself to be clear
the scans I read way back when were full of misspellings, and even had the translator put his own comments on the first page which spoiled the anime (the first few chapters actually came out and take place *before* the anime)
I hope there are clean versions somewhere
you do
like Hayate's life with the Book before shit hit the fan
also side-stories was the wrong way to say it, it's just events happening concurrently to the show
headpat
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/458220405358854145/528966719562317840/pat.png
but you can witness a literal book patting Hayate on the head, worth it
just short side-stories
there are also side-manga for A's and Strikers
no lack of content indeed <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
then somehow Vivid Strike took its concept and made a story more in line with early Nanoha and was really awesome
though it's also that it's a mess to watch cause the anime only partly covered the manga and it stopped right before the most interesting parts were about to happen due to a canned season 2 <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
basically there's a reason most people think Vivid is the weakest part of the franchise
Reflection/Detonation are also close to the first seasons
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Vivid Strike? actually feels very similar to s1/s2 I think
Vivid? plenty
I don't Fate (unless it's Nanoha's <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ) so I didn't get the analogy
as well as some minor plot differences that happened because of S2/M2
they aren't the same universe because the timeline of things doesn't match up with what is said in StrikerS
though it honestly doesn't matter
also that
honestly, StrikerS is the "end" of the main Nanoha story. Vivid is a spin-off that's not quite the same genre, and Reflection/Detonation are a story taking place between A's and StrikerS
hardly necessary really, but it does introduce a character for Vivid
this specific one was subbed by someone and put on yt, so it's not that hard to watch
or the Reflection movie
otherwise you can spin-off into Vivid directly
are you interested in drama CDs? there's one as an epilogue to StrikerS
uhhh
always gets to me
also Snow Rain is such a good song
I'd be surprised if she wasn't intentionally like that as a joke <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
official Nanoha subs :15min:
just play Gears of Destiny instead <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
OreSuki ep3 (as well as ep 1-2, really): a bunch of terrible assholes make romantic plans that make no sense
let's talk again once you get into StrikerS <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
gonna watch ep3 of OreSuki <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but alas, the time for good anime is over, back to the trash
anyway I rarely get to talk so much about Nanoha so I'm really happy
I just can't
this is what was screened on theaters
yes it's hilarious
the Detonation subs accidentally killed off a character in the ending monologue by translating it wrong
meanwhile, official Detonation subs: 237 mistakes <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but yeah better something that reels you in quickly I'm guessing by your taste
the anime covered only 2 volumes, the LNs are up to... 17? it's almost a different story by now
reverse isekai with Devil is a Part-Timer?
Re:Zero?
forgot
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
oh right
for isekai... Konosuba?
I'm into slice-of-life/romance stuff so that's usually what I'd recommend but
What genre of LN do you like?
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
it's so simple but so good and fun to read
finished reading Adachi and Shimamura volume 3 and I've reconfirmed it might become one of my all-time top 5 series if it keeps being this good <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
I've been reading the Monogatari LNs and loving them <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> the anime is already a masterpiece, and the novels are adding even more depths to all the characters <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
also whoops, 231
wait I don't know if I can post that
the guy who did the fansubs
*237 mistakes*
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
don't try to fool people like this
it's very quirky and can be hilarious if you're into its type of humor
it is
we're closing in to chapter 180 soon too, can't wait <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Aka specifically said he makes a climax every 45 chapters so that if he gets an anime it's easy to adapt <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
90 is ||Ishigami arc end||
45-46 is the fireworks one
well, rather than changing, it's more like there are some serious chapters and some pure comedy chapters
even before that I think
never
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
oh you haven't read that? definitely recommend
I spent this morning binging the latest 3 chapters of the volume, it was so good <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that manga is very good <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Millhi, have you read up to the end of vol3?
true
Seven Seas release schedule though :15min:
licensing announcement was fairly recent after all
there are 3 full volumes currently fan tl'd
yeah <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but the official TL isn't out yet
yeah there's no way they can just put them in there
try it out and see
I happen to think it's wonderfully written, but it might not be to your taste if you prefer things moving fast
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
and Shima's too, really, though for different reasons
the best part is reading Adachi's monologues
honestly I have no idea how the anime will be
the rest of vol3 tl came out today, btw
half of the anime's runtime needs to be Adachi staring at Shima <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
there is justice
and anime announced
indeed <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Adachi and Shimamura, it's a fluffy romance
I think they're great <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
the novels are... even weirder <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ikxi, if all else fails read Monogatari
meanwhile I think I'm out of isekai knowledge <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
also nice Millhi <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> let me recommend you AdaShima because I honestly think it's one of the best LNs I've ever read
yeah
oh right
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
you might know, but Mugi is Saint-Germain
two live concerts for your first main role is pretty impressive <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
like most of the K-On cast, that was her breakout role
yeah she is
I don't know what it is about Maria's style that doesn't grab me
I love her Mio songs in K-On, but in Sympho the only Maria songs I like are Ginwan Airgetlam and the XV ones
though her competition is absolutely top tier so I'll cut her some slack <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah, Hikasa probably has the weakest range of the Sympho cast
I consider myself to be pretty into seiyuu stuff, and I get surprised by things like these all the time
it just means they have great range <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
yup
totally forgot
she's Shiro
since we were talking about NGNL
oh I found another different Kayanon role
It's written by one of my favorite authors <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367> the writer for White Album 2 as well
It's kind of a meta parody, I really enjoy it. The characters are all caricatures in the beginning, but they feel very... real, by the end
have you watched Saekano? She's Utaha in that
since live it's harder to keep character while singing
in the live concerts especially you can tell that when she sings she reverts back to that
yeah
Kirika's more of an exception
well, Kayanon's voice is normally on the deeper side
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
lots of great roles
Kayanon <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
playing her serious side like Fate and her silly one like Levi
Nana as Azriel <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> I might want that
no because she isn't cast in those <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Innocent Starter, s1's OP was her first breakout hit, and Eternal Blaze after is what made her really famous
much like Symphogear, Nanoha getting a second season was mostly the power of Nana Wills It
but yeah A's is Ace
just like XV is pronounced like a sneeze <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
according to Aka, he made it so every season could cover exactly 45 chapters and have a good stopping point, so that's almost 100% where s2 will end
sports festival is ||the big Ishigami arc||
given what I mentioned above
though it's a lot more sci-fi than Sympho is
to be a bit more clear, like I said earlier it's mecha/sci-fi in the same vein Symphogear is: the focus is still on the characters' stories... mostly
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
||the first two seasons are as kids, the third is 10 years later when they're all 19/20. But the *tonal* switch is like halfway through a season one when you're just watching a generic (if somewhat darker) magical girl show and then with literally no warning they cut to a spaceship being like "this is one of the many dimensions we're monitoring, blah blah" and the show never goes back after they jump the shark. The 3rd season literally takes place on another world entirely after the protagonists have moved.||
spoiler'd just in case since we have a few people here starting Nanoha recently
if I find something appealing of course I'll watch it though
I used to, but not really anymore
so I haven't managed to care about a single "popular" anime ever, except Re:Zero <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm the opposite
I end up having niche opinions for like 90% of the stuff I watch, I know it well <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
taste is a thing <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
headpat
still best anime
first anime
feeling old <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
thanks
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
socializing <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
... <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
if I had job I'd have a use for my phone
I used to think characters who don't have a phone in manga/anime/LNs were a bit too unrealistic, but then I realized I haven't turned my phone on in 8 days
want me to link you?
there's definitely a smaller version
if you're fine with torrents it's up on the cat site
watched it a few months ago, lived up to its reputation
it's a great show
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
more Nanoha always good
do it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I don't think not liking Neptunia is a hot take <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
OreSuki 4 was indeed very entertaining trash
so I kinda do understand Ayahi being the least popular, they're all pretty big names
and Kotobuki Minako is Mugi from K-On too, as well as a character in Symphogear you... haven't seen yet? (AXZ stuff)
Toyosaki Aki is Yui from K-On
hijinks ensue when they see how much they spoil her at home <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
one of the drama CDs is Nanoha going back to visit Earth with all the Forwards
my life in one pic
JAST RELEASE FLOWERS FALL ALREADY
there are plenty of official releases now
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Mashiro is a top tier girl
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
#3... probably Aokana, now that I've played it
#1 is ef
Majikoi #2 for me
Overall I wouldn't say it's among my favorites, but *that reveal* is still so memorable
rare comrade
someone who knows that game
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
burn the Sakura series
no
no
no
SonoHana series is too much of straight-up a porn game for me <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Kindred Spirits is the one good yuri VN
it wasn't good
I stooped to playing one directly in JP <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I have <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I wish there were more good yuri VNs
no that's bad
it's silly yuri
like, 3 years ago now
yeah it is?
S
that's 4 games
that's a lot
well Majikoi is tl'd up to A-2
that game is an absolute masterpiece nobody in the west knows <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
my dream VN tl is Hatsuyuki Sakura
hope you like it
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
it's always time
that's why I love Monogatari
they're the future
shows just doing random shit are the best
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Starlight is Sympho lite
oh we said the same thing <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
more than anything, the TV series' budget didn't last long enough for the second half to have good fights so I'm really hopeful to see what they do with movie budget
both the game, and the second stage performance
technically there already are sequels
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Saki is also word of god gay afaik so no issues on that front <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
guess I need to finally watch Saki
there is more depth in Railgun's main 4 than all of Index's cast minus maybe Accel
yeah I know, it's mindboggling
if those editors are what gave us Railgun then I welcome it
opinions I guess
and I don't want anyone to say "New Testament has development for Touma" cause I'm not waiting 30 volumes for a character to get interesting <:GWcentralPikaLUL:377110562116468766>
I think Index is goes from bad to terrible
I'd say Railgun would be better for me if I never watched Index
Railgun could totally be great without Index
headpat
but Railgun anime always expands a lot so I'm excited
for the first time I already read the manga so I kinda know what's coming
Railgun s3 should be good
yes hail Misaka
way too late
not in the first 20 volumes
too late
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
NO SHIT
"yeah don't get controlled by your evil organization"
every time
but it's the most basic shit ever
and like, if there were actual arguments or whatever it would be fine
literally every arc is him telling someone "no ur wrong"
that the anime didn't make him interesting at all is a failure
honestly, any LN protag is more fleshed out in the books
one good one at least
I guess Re:Zero is also here
same <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
It's as good as you'd expect
recently I've been reading the Monogatari series
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I read plenty of good ones
Let me vouch for LNs
I plan to but I like to binge so I'm waiting for a bit
wait Aya I wasn't the one who watched the anime <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
you have, I found you a librarian isekai fan
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@238855496797257729> has been enjoying it
I'm the type to binge so I'll be waiting for a while
right I wanted to watch that
oh
not familiar with the abbreviation
which one is Honzuki
top tier
If you like yuri fluff, let me recommend Adachi and Shimamura
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
I wanted a bench to be in the pool or something during the episode, ngl <:GWcentralPikaLUL:377110562116468766>
I've seen at least a few people say they kept watching because they were so confused why so much effort was being put into a show like this at first <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the animation quality is the only thing that carries you through the first half of episode 1 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
that MC seat being free
The whole anime's had pretty good animation and attention to detail
he came out of a 90s sports manga or something <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I wanna know what's up with that absolute unit in the front row though
https://i.imgur.com/OaLQgDr.jpg
also wait, Touyama Nao is in this too, just saw the post-credits <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ex-Twintails is great I agree. I still like Himawari best cause I love her design and reactions to everything
about the Yukarin thing, it's because she voices the mom and they did a Forever 17 joke with the text <:GWcentralPikaLUL:377110562116468766>
last episode was my least favorite so far so I was worried the show would lose its streak but this was awesome
it was pretty great
just got done watching now
OreSuki has kept surprising with dumb shit, but a Tamura Yukari self-insert isn't what I expected <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm just waiting for the day 10 years in the future when a Konosuba season 4 comes out so we can see vol9 adapted
ironically, the book that comes after Nise (which is what you said you got to) has tons of jokes about "readers who came here after watching the anime and don't know what the novel is like" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@238855496797257729> do try it <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
the next arc stars best girl as narrator though
headpat
to each their own, I think Monogatari is literally the best work of fiction out there, but if you don't like it that's valid
Kabuki had like a pretty big portion removed cause it was hinging on knowing Kizu events not yet adapted at the time
I recommend Kabuki and Otori for most extra content
they're just as good if not better than the anime
I've recently been reading all the LNs instead
good choice
actual peak of culture
then read Monogatari
watch Monogatari
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
basically it's a grunt
well onomatopeia fits
no it's
hearing Fate's voice muffled by the pillow was funny
I did like that scene for how perfectly it captured the "I literally just dropped dead on the first bed I found" feel <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
only Nanoha and Fate sleep together regularly
they were tired after a mission, cut them a break <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I honestly thought it was a nice change of pace when I watched, only later I found out literally everyone was mad about it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
"every girl" <:GWmythicalFeelsSadMan:374568771421208577>
best is actually Rihoko fight me
headpat
wtf that emote genuinely spooked me <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
never knew
wait Millhi is in my timezone
I can't believe I was 15 back then, time flies
Ever 17 was one of my first VNs, I barely remember anything about it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and also Suginami
and Suginami
and by highs I mean Suginami
Da Capo has high highs and low lows
big think right there
as an anime or VN Millhi?
I need to replay ToHeart2 one day
can see why it's a classic despite being the definition of vanilla VN
game was great
13 episodes for a 60 hour VN lol
didn't watch
they knew what the appeal was, solo <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
delete all these people
getting any sort of good ending just feels wrong though <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
School Days anime is the only true way to experience it <:GWcentralPikaLUL:377110562116468766>
not exactly in the format, but well, it's pretty special
Amagami was actually super unique as a VN, too
the 9year long tl is almost over
cause I'll play the VN one day
never watched Yosuga
the VN was by the same makers I think
oh right Kimikiss
I honestly don't know any other
play VNs everybody, they good
I'll go to sleep too
like Lindy and Nanoha's mother sitting down and discussing their daughters
there's some cute chapters in there
it's not an adaptation, it's extra material
also lol though: >starts speaking German -> "Belkan!?" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
holy shit that animation quality what the hell
time for Detonation <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
btw Melua, have you read the Reflection manga?
aaaand there's Nanoha giving negative shits about her health
animated Aurora Slash <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
aww she didn't call her "Hate" in this <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Levi is absolutely fantastic
this track <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtS43uvwuzE
...no pun intended
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Yukarin's Stern voice is so good <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
best written Nanoha plot and also best written Kaneko plot <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
play GOD everyone
Dearche's Inferno move, and even Signum said her Full Drive quote
it's really cool getting all the references now
I've spent so many hours on the game, I hear the shouts of VARIANT CANNON! every time it's being fired even when they don't say it
Gears of Destiny was a bit sillier so Amita was totally a hot-blooded shounen hero
"KKG!" it's hard to translate <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> (stands for "kiai to konjou de ganbarimashita!" - I did it with guts and willpower!)
I hope Amita says her Gears of Destiny catchphrase at least once
they're great
I forgot just how good the designs look, and the OST is great too
Rewatching Nanoha Reflection before I finally get to Detonation
wow you already watched all of it? <:HibikiWow:609475569188470963>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I love Jail's hamminess
also now you know where the concept for Ver came from <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Subaru is essentially the proto-Hibiki
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<@83626774000308224> what did you think of it? <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937> StrikerS is usually a pretty divisive season, but I think it has plenty to like about it
<:mashirosugoi:636219763776815124>
play Aokana everyone
it's based on the Perfect Edition
has all the routes
Steam version
<a:HinaSlowlyRunsOutOfTheDoor:564188497309597709>
the original game didn't have them either so
Refrain was a mistake <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
there's a reason they don't do them anymore
not with Key
has even a new thing where they have notes on all the JP cultural terms and stuff
LB Steam is the optimal version in this case
which is just Refrain minus the terrible H-scenes
||he loves both of them. It makes more sense in context <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ||
also (spoilers for a scene that was skipped) ||we might retro-actively get Subaru confessing to Rem, the fanbase will actually implode on itself|| <:LUL:610135925078360110>
can't wait for it to not get brought over in the west and everyone be really confused when season 2 references events from there <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
in preparation for season 2
oh boy Re:Zero's first season is getting a re-run where they're adding in some scenes they skipped
I've seen people skip it
just wanted to tell you that the recap episode is 100% worth watching
speaking of, are you still watching Oresuki?
but also I've read up to the start of Arc 6 in the WN so I'm in no hurry <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
same
it was something like 47 extra minutes iirc?
for Re:Zero someone counted
<:LetsDestroyABike:593568746694639839>
even just extended runtime for some episodes
so I'm optimistic
there was a lot of thought put into the Re:Zero anime, what with all the skipping OP/ED for extra content
gonna feel quite different
especially with all the times they used EDs over the cliffhangers
yeah Millhi I was thinking about that too
it's probably too hard to explain properly if you don't actually know the story
that's simply an earlier development
Ayamine you aren't wrong
I see Millhi is also ready to enjoy the shitstorm that will happen
that was really really good
just finished reading the Bloom into You Sayaka novel
I spy one of the new scenes already <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwq7HxrHiZU
tbh I just use JP voices for everything nowadays <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
while there are really great EN va too, there's like dozens of better JP ones for each of them <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's just the difference in quality between EN and JP voice acting industries
especially since the show often used the ED as runtime, so they might even have different bgm for those parts
it will definitely be the most interesting part
yeah that's the main thing I'm looking out for <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
(25 technically, but one was double length)
nah it was 26 episodes
the show was 2-cour so there's enough content for a whole season of double episodes
<@!238855496797257729> the latter. 13 "hour-long" (48 minutes) episodes
Lucky Star is a very particular style of comedy
that was a ride and a half
speaking of VNs, I just finished BokuTen
never watched C;H's adaptation
but it existing just pisses me off <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's not as "bad" as some other stuff
I was about to say Eromanga-sensei
oh what a coincidence
hard to say cause I tend to drop stuff I dislike very early on <:F_Thonk:408369856673480714>
Formia <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
oh right you did ask but I got sidetracked by something and never got back <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah, I guess that's natural <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and then at other times I just want all dramatic stuff all the time
like sometimes I just watch a dozen cute girl shows only
I just go through various phases depending on my mood <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
my tastes have gone literally everywhere since I started watching anime, but K-On! has always been at the top for me <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
nothing wrong with liking *absolute trash* <:ChrisStare:605517107077316631>
lol
Shuffle's anime was pretty good, but I think they ruined Kaede by having her go full yandere at the end <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
especially the more vanilla slice-of-life/romance ones
tbh, most VNs simply do not work well in anime form
VN translation has been going for like a decade now, maybe I'll get to play it eventually
alright I'm gonna go sleep now <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
sleeper hit
Joshigakusei ga Mudazukai is the recent comedy which surprised me
definitely not for everyone
well, with only 2 volumes out right now the LN won't catch up to the anime in forever, so I'm definitely watching it
it's 1-cour right?
will probably watch the anime after I'm done with the LNs currently released
but I'm enjoying it
anime ja nai <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
reading LN volume 1 right now <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
on an entirely different note, was it you who really liked Bookworm
I watched this show for Himawari's character design and I don't regret it
nah, that's pretty common in this kind of shows <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
seems fairly likely s2 will be announced after the OVA
an OVA has been announced at least
<:HibikiWow:609475569188470963>
Spring 2020
April
a bit before the start of the 2nd cour
alright, the OVA will air in March
the difference is just in the production process
I mean, essentially the same thing
oh but it's getting a 2nd season
I'll look into it <a:hinalaptop:550757299300466708>
any idea when they'll air?
there are two OVAs you said right?
that's all I need to know
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@!238855496797257729> what episode in the Bookworm anime does ||Myne fuck up the Bishop before joining the temple?||
currently reading Bookworm LN volume 2 <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
gonna finish the volume by tomorrow <a:hinalaptop:550757299300466708>
as for me, don't know how much the LN matches up with the anime but the family is about to go slaughter some pigs with the neighbors <:LetsDestroyABike:593568746694639839>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
that's pretty good
1-cour is still like 4 volumes usually
<:EveBless:555025000482996244>
of their recent work I know Dagashi Kashi was pretty good, but I heard the Quintuplets anime had some QUALITY <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
no idea what I should expect <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Tezuka huh
wait my eyes just glossed over those moonrunes
thankfully the trailer gives me nothing but good vibes
I really wanna know which one it is
the studio hasn't been announced yet
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I don't think I've ever cared about an anime adaptation this much, I'm so stressed about it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I have all the worries
I know <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
<https://dynasty-scans.com/system/releases/000/023/596/0001.png> this is the LN cover for reference
Shima's hair in particular they captured perfectly <:MikuLove:585596189802627072> (she's the brown(?) hair one)
yeah the artstyle looks super good
this is the PV released just today <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=uWz9iPUUMF0
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm scared that the anime might try to rush through the content since it's so slow though <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
the inner monologues are incredibly enjoyable
it's also a really slow burn that focuses more on the characters' inner thoughts rather than immediately developing the relationship, but that's what's so great about it
I've absolutely been loving it
Adachi and Shimamura, a yuri LN which is also getting an anime in 2020
I gotta hope the AdaShima adaptation gets this treatment too
as expected of the LN that ranked #1 last year and #2 this year
there seems to be a lot of care put into the adaptation, given how they're not rushing through content at all
so the anime is essentially taking a break for just one season
<:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
oh I missed the "light" in "light novel"
is what I was referring to
Bookworm was #1 in the Tankobon rankings of KonoRano 2019
it's silly to blame the pronunciation, it's not like you can just transliterate names
this is only the adaptation of literally the #1 light novel of 2019
Crunchy is absolute trash
how do you not take the 10 seconds required to search the *main character*'s name
bless fansubs
oh god did Crunchy really sub Myne as "Main"
I ended up loving the series way more than I thought I would
finished reading all the available Bookworm LNs <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
that's what I felt when I watched Nanoha and it led me to Sympho <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
also Flip Flappers
Yuuki Yuuna?
it's technically well-known, but outside this server I don't know anyone who's watched it <:HibikiCry:601426670372782081>
Alright, Nanoha is what I was on the fence about
outside  like, Madoka
I don't know what passes for a popular magical girl anime
"lesser known" than what? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
you've heard well <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
if I had to say, it starts off somewhat slow, but then the ride just keeps on getting faster <:LetsDestroyABike:593568746694639839>
go into it forgetting everything you've heard about it and you'll enjoy it <:ChriSmile:613005626787758090>
slightly sad I won't get to see everyone be really confused when s2 starts <:LetsDestroyABike:593568746694639839>
Alright, Crunchy is picking up the Re:Zero rerun after all
this meme needed to die 2 years ago <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
<:blobpopcorn:322812441157435392>
I can't wait for fan reactions to the extra season 1 scenes
yes
is the protagonist restarting when he's killed
the whole premise of the anime
Aya hasn't seen the anime, be careful <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
still, I enjoy her being a total smartass <:LetsDestroyABike:593568746694639839>
she didn't shine much in season 1
Ram will have a fairly big role in season 2
I'm sure fans will be talking about them anyway so they won't be hard to find
so make sure you at least check those
Fire, there are new scenes in this rerun
well, there are plenty of good characters
2nd cour EDs are legendary
best
very good
4 volumes of Bookworm, 1 of NGNL, the latest AdaShima, the BiY Sayaka novel, 2 Tomozaki volumes, now reading Torture Princess cause I heard good things about it
I've read like 12 volumes of stuff over the past week or two <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
next time I get into a binge-watching mood <a:hinalaptop:550757299300466708>
they do seem my kind of thing
looking back at your list, I've had Yama no Susume and Tamayura on my ptw actually forever <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
if the anime can reflect that it will be good <:EveBless:555025000482996244>
that's how different Adachi and Shimamura feel
in the novel when you get a switch in perspective it honestly feels like you started reading a different series
I place my hopes on the latter
Tomozaki adaptation should be good too <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
don't make me more stressed about the anime than I already am <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
that will be 100% on character acting
AdaShima adaptation please be good
^
but hey, 2020 is gonna give us all the adaptations we didn't deserve <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I've become too jaded for anime <:GWmythicalFeelsSadMan:374568771421208577>
aside from those, lately my tastes have shifted towards LNs <:AyaThonk:589618289777442816>
I count Liz as part of Hibike <:EveBless:555025000482996244>
not sure if I can count K-On cause 2010 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
after that it's hard to rank
aside from that, Symphogear/Hibike/Oregairu
is using Monogatari as a favorite cheating <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yep
Maruto's writing is godly
it's just the best
yeah
WA2 is like my favorite VN
rip internal thoughts though <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
getting through it thanks to voiced protagonist
I guess my best/worst experience was reading the WA2 VN in JP
but I can't recognize them on sight <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I'm good at grammar
yes, after I look them up <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
be like me, understand 90% of spoken JP but can't read more than 20 kanji
train trips to Naples for uni <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
it's not like people understand them around here <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
same I read LNs in public pretty freely
<:TopDad:603239938011430923>
do you not want to show off your power level
I've read enough mediocre VNs for my fill of trashy harems
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I like DAL
the volume I read was volume 8
I don't think the anime fanbase remembers any anime past two seasons anymore <:TopDad:603239938011430923>
currently I'm just in the "Fall 2019 lol" waiting room for Flowers part 3 <:HibikiCry:601426670372782081>
haven't seen the other ones
Hanasaki Work Spring is also really good out of the 4 season series
oh I didn't know that
yup Millhi
what did you mean by that
<:TopDad:603239938011430923>
aside from WA2, Hatsuyuki Sakura is the other one
nobody else I know knows them <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
tfw 2 of my favorite VNs aren't translated
if only it had an actual tl, WA2 would be as famous as Clannad even in the west
sorry, acronyms <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
White Album 2
I wish Index didn't exist so I could appreciate Railgun as a standalone <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Touma is the worst <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
so it definitely seems very planned
if there are no breaks at all between episodes, episode 1 of season 2 will air on Subaru's birthday while the last episode will air on silver haired-girl's birthday
as for Re:Zero, season 2 should be 2-cour yes
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
oh wait I was talking about Bookworm
season 2 will probably adapt part 2 which is 4 volumes
season 1 was the end of part 1 of the series, the first 3 volumes
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
also Aya, now you know what I was referring to the other time. Sorry for almost spoiling <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634> I thought the anime would have gone at a faster pace
there's translation for the LN though <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<a:HinaSlowlyRunsOutOfTheDoor:564188497309597709>
anyway, you should all be reading the Bookworm LN <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
so they can go at each other over their taste in anime
the entire server waiting on Aya's screencap <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
this sounds fun, let me in <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I can link it to you if you want
the LN is really really good <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
there we go

oh right
hah, weak
<:EveBless:555025000482996244>
that's how I learned
my advice is literally "play VNs" <:LUL:610135925078360110>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's fine I understand spoken JP
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
since season 2 will go beyond the translated books
I haven't yet watched all the anime because I read the LN first, but I'm planning to before season 2
same, I really like everyone
<:RinaYay:660932004723949583>
it was about the last episode
it's happened in the anime now so it's fine
I liked School-Live out of those, the rest is mostly unknown to me too
<:KirikaBIGNom:653930308260986893>
<@!238855496797257729> I had to go eat dinner <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
yeah when nothing else is available Erai is higher quality at least
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
did they fuck up any other name
I'm using good subs for Bookworm so I won't know
speaking of, Aya
which can be pretty bad depending on the show <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
HS is Crunchy
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I watched Koisuru Asteroid raw today because HS was the only thing available
heresy <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~don't~~
there's Railgun T too but I'll probably binge that once it's over
I'll be watching just Koisuru Asteroid and Bandori s3 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
also the reason for the title being "Asteroid" is really silly <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'd forgotten just how good Doga Kobo is at making me enjoy just looking at the characters' hair <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Koisuru Asteroid is very good <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
oh I'm talking LNs here
Danmachi official tl is pretty far into the series
don't know about hard copy but
one day
one day I'll read Danmachi
this sounds like the dumbest thing ever <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
oh I see
and the source material does not get worse
it's obvious they care a lot about the show
I have full trust in the staff
and yeah but with season 2 coming you can guess it's gonna get more and more relevant <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ah Yori, Aya hasn't seen the show yet so don't say too much
<:TopDad:603239938011430923>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so you'll hear the others, but then it's like "Jealous Witch"
sins are a thing, without saying anything specific
because Envy is one of the 7 sins
it's supposed to be "Witch of Envy"
still not perfect but better
DameDesuYo did better subs
plz
like "Jealous Witch"
so they wouldn't have fucked up every title ever
Re:Zero subs were good but I wished they took like literally 5 seconds to look into the lore of the show
it's actual pirating
well cause it rips the official simulcast <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
don't pirate, kids
see, if you only pirate LNs you can't get crushed by them to be isekai'd
<:RinaTehe:661623410958270465>
<:RinaTears:661622342639681547>
<:GWmythicalFeelsSadMan:374568771421208577>
now she's just an anime character
why would they do that
SOMEONE WHO AGREES WITH ME
when they showed her face
<:ChrisStare:605517107077316631>
gacha has destroyed me enough <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:RinaYay:660932004723949583>
but she funny girl who makes faces on a notebook
it's Rina from the newest Love Live game I don't actually play or know anything about
<:RinaSad:661622342987808807>
? no
or something
rather than selling too well, I think the release got postponed
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
and the only two sellers available now are double the price
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
...on a *pre-order 3 months in advance*
they cancelled my Owarimonogatari order cause they didn't know when it would be available
speaking of LNs, I got fucked by Amazon <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
AdaShima, Tomozaki, Oregairu s3
for me, 2020 is my dream year of SoL LNs I love getting adapted <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
same
but yeah they're available for Danmachi <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
speaking of not straight, Kanamemo is good
I've seen Manabi Straight <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I don't know much about either of them, but Tamayura has the Millhi approval, and Kanamemo seems to be the openly yuri SoL I always wanted but that nobody ever told me about <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Tamayura and Kanamemo
gonna be watching 2 anime from 10 years ago back-to-back <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> will be an experience
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
darn long weird season names
I somehow forgot to mention the actual series <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> though I'm sure you know it's Tamayura
or are the 2 OVAs standalone from the rest of the series
<@!152896851660505088> first the 2 OVAs, then Hitotose, then More Aggressive, then Graduation Photo, correct? <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
into s2 in April
there's like a double-length OVA at the end of March
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
only a single season break
spring
I personally can't speak for the anime, but I've read the LNs up to what would be the middle of s2 and it's great
Bookworm is super good

Kana was so innocent, now she's such a bully
reading Kanamemo manga makes it clear it's just a story about awakening to a tsundere fetish <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
wtf there are Yukachi-voiced audiobooks for Bookworm
3 volumes for the first 11 (+1) episodes, almost 6 in the other 14
2nd half went way faster
ah yeah first half of the show was 4 per volume
Index s3 was a special kind of fuck-up we don't talk about <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Re:Zero was around 3 episodes per volume, rarely 2
for example
both Oregairu seasons had one volume that got only one episode
but quite a few get ultra-rushed as well
usually 3
most LNs are about 3-4 episodes per volume
I'm just greedy and want more always <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
5 episodes is more than 95% LN adaptations get, so it's good
Ascendance of a Bookworm is the full English title
I hope vol2-3 aren't too rushed
which is the shortest one
wow, Bookworm spent over 5 episodes on novel 1
just watched ep2 so I got upset all over again <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
alright, I found out that Bookworm's author specifically stated her name is Myne, so CR has no rights <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's next season
entirely voiced by Yukachi, for every character <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I want to get my hands on the audiobooks
bless Yukachi
I now understand the Shem-Ha vibes
they really did that scene justice
<:KirikAyaya:585256962065956894>
but also watched the anime now
I did
a lot <:HibikiYes:593568746694639792>
Aya I finished marathoning Bookworm anime <:RinaYay:660932004723949583>
<:KokoroYay:528271413405024274>
I just like memeing about her, she's actually my favorite character
<:kokrying:661367271129612319>
but <:KokroWaaaa:504405879915806738>
most people think Kaoru is pretending, at least
I'll just put this in the category of "how do some people think Michelle is a real bear" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
she... probably doesn't go to school with dyed hair
it is Pareo
totally forgot to mention, but Shirabe officially joined Bandori's cast <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
got like 10 screenshots off the ED, it's so good
<:EveBless:555025000482996244>
<:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
I understand the intent but... no
hidive in Bandori s3 the other day: "gokigenyou" -> "bonjour mademoiselle" <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
I own both the K-On and Liz movies <:EveBless:555025000482996244>
exactly <:HibikiYes:593568746694639792>
basically, don't use CR if you can help it, if you care about supporting the industry there's plenty of better ways to do it
given how huge some mistakes are sometimes, just editing is a hell of a lot <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
because there's actual effort put into them
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
there is actually nobody who knows English at CR
what a meme
<:TopDad:603239938011430923>
CR was actually using that tl for a while
sure <:HibikiYes:593568746694639792>
if you want, I happen to have all links on hand cause I just gave them to a friend recently <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'd say it is
I'm waiting for official releases to keep going
don't say anything <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I've read 1-14 and 0
but very important
it is all backstory
btw, since the official releases skipped it for no good reason, did you read volume 0
but the characters and comedy are still really strong
I also don't care much for the isekai plot I guess
I like Chiho more than Emi, I see our difference <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I love Maou-sama LNs <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
vol4-5 (especially 5) are pretty damn good
you're about to get into the stuff the anime didn't cover now <:HibikiYes:593568746694639792>
cute idiot has fun in her new game
Shield Girl is actually decent
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
still, it's almost like whoever translated didn't know English has polite words
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
it's not worse than Sissy
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:KokoHappy:589621245847535616> <:KanonLucky:589621246472355851> <:KaoSmile:589621245868376064> <:HaguYay:589621246053056512> <:MisaYay:589621246581276728>
mine would probably be obvious from the emotes I'm using
I don't want to derail sympho channel so I'll ask here: what's everyone's favorite Bandori band? <:KokoroPeek:504405876816347136>
a new White Album 2 OST album got released <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
turns out without a boring MC and harem antics you can make most premises good
shield girl is good
but a bad start almost never becomes a good show
there are just some shows where it's like, they might get worse if the material gets stale
agreed
but if you can tell the characters have good chemistry and depth
the quality of a show is never in its plot anyway
shows starting slow is good
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that's like 4 times the amount of anime I've watched in the last 4 seasons
I'll be watching Bandori, Asteroid, Magia Record and maybe Shield Girl if it keeps being good
they'll explain soon enough <:HibikiYes:593568746694639792>
he saw the thingie glow
now you've met Reinhardt
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
children might be smarter than the average anime fan <:TopDad:664848944517480489>
Bookworm anime gave me my Yukachi voice acting fix I needed
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
so yes
best fripSide song in Hesitation Snow, you're all missing out <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I discovered that Muse Asia are the only ones doing good official subs, but they're region-locked (on yt) so <:TopDad:664848944517480489>
same
Koe no Katachi
you're watching a great show then <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
alright, I gushed enough, I need to sleep now <:KashumiSleeper:589621246426218508>
the most fun to play is still Fate in Sonic Form though, I love the "super fast but no defense" characters in pretty much all games
I played this game for an unhealthy amount of time <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I used her in Survival mode and got up to like 50 wins <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Einhart is actually my best character gameplay-wise
Chrono, you don't do enough damage <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I'm a perfectionist, so I also replayed it like 10 times to get all the different dialogue <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
though you'd need to know JP to understand them
coolest thing about the final boss is all the unique lines for the limit break
and letting time run out
by not triggering the second health bar
you can cheat the final boss <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and hearing Mizuki Nana voice a character like that was hilarious
Levi is just too great
in the games I loved the Materials too
basically I love the entire A's cast <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Vita is really great too
the other pair <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Signum is up there too
my favorite Nanoha character would probably be Fate <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
fun fact: Gears of Destiny was written by Kaneko, Symphogear's creator <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@!471416654346321930> finally someone I can share my love of the Nanoha PSP games with <:HibikiWow:609475569188470963>
that scene just looks ridiculous
ah, the "bad" was about the slow motion part <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that's my description of the show
with the really bad slow motion CGI chain
the death game one
I'm staying away from that show based on what I've heard and seen <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
meanwhile, I just watched episodes 2 and 3 of Bandori s3 and they were great <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
(potato image quality <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634> )

my only Nanoha figure is a random Reinforce one I found at a local convention by chance <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:LetsDestroyABike:593568746694639839>
same
it's me <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Yuuki Yuuna is very good
by gjm
there are good fansubs for the show if you look
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
read entirely by Yukachi
though there is actually an audiobook for Bookworm
of course, you can't just have them read every line of the book for you <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
of course there is still stuff that was skipped but it's great
yeah it is
we were blessed with a good adaptation
<:KirikaBIGNom:653930308260986893>
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/630524172635996200/667095290469154845/s.png
why limit yourself to monsters
yeah <:LetsDestroyABike:593568746694639839>
I just realized people might not know what the hell Bofuri is <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> it's the Shield Girl anime
watched Bofuri episode 2 by them and it was great, I'm liking the series way more than I thought
while I shit-talk official subs in the other channel, let me say Muse Asia is actually great! just region-locked to 95% of the world
https://twitter.com/SymphoNonsense/status/1217740427526316032
<a:HibikiOraOra:597682354135367681>

<:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
Shield Hero characters sucked all the fun out of Isekai Quartet
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Aya probably just means in the current arc, he's a first timer
<:LUL:610135925078360110>
yeah I was always more comfortable with English too
this twitter post took away years of my life
https://twitter.com/FrancescoDonald/status/1184116997522644994
wait I have a good meme for you
outstanding
there's actually gonna be an even worse name screw-up in the episodes you haven't seen yet btw <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
holy shit Rabe <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
don't worry, you *will* hear about them once they're out <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the bonus scenes will be mostly in the second half
so far just a few animation tweaks here and there
so basically the rerun is: ep1, ep2-3, ep4-5 and so on
ep1 of the original was also double length
yup
which was cut from the adaptation due to time constraints the first time around
watch the rerun cause it will have bonus content needed for season 2
with 50 mins episodes
yeah, a rerun of the first season
especially in the second half
I speak for myself of course, but part of the fun with ReZero was the wait each week in trying to figure out where things would go
stay strong <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
which also leads to less outsourcing
the reason KyoAni stuff looks so good is because they're pretty much the only functional anime studio, training their own employees and treating them well
good animation isn't just down to money
because after the first time she messed him up badly
it is, he just woke up twice on the first day <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so basically she "knows" him in that sense, but she doesn't know about the loop
<@!238855496797257729>
so the fact that he visited Beatrice's room happens before the reset point
the save point was after he woke up in the bed the second time
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I can safely say this'll be my comfort show of the season
Koisuru Asteroid ep3 good <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
slight season 2 spoiler ||she will be one of the major focus characters in s2 <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> ||
Beatrice is great <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
of course I did <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's Crusch though
Aya hasn't even met best girl yet <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah what Yori said
it's been over 3 years, so aside from the most famous memes you won't find many spoilers anymore
I'll just say you're onto something with that last thing you said
see, this is the fun part of thinking about the show <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
<a:aChisatoNoUBig:586243095667146762>
expect the show to start throwing curveballs at you though <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
read at your own risk ||2 more deaths before next checkpoint||
I assume people will make links or something for the extra scenes, so you'll be able to watch just those
as a source material reader, I've been waiting for the anime fanbase to catch up for 3 years and a half now <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
actual typesetting? what is this
watching Muse Asia subs was like discovering a miracle
>thinking there is a working braincell at CR/Funi <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I was already guessing it from the OP, but I'm really happy with Risa's build, cause high agility/low defense is what I tend to play as myself <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Smol Girl Eats Literal Bombs
since yt is free anyway I don't feel as bad <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's not in mine, so I still had to torrent it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
oh nice <:HibikiWow:609475569188470963>
they don't have Railgun unfortunately
Muse Asia is official, but region locked and doesn't have most anime
fairly sure it won't be another gacha game at least
I do think it will be something good, but I like a good meme <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:TopDad:664848944517480489>
time for that pachinko am I right <:TopDad:664848944517480489>
new project <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
wait WHAT
wait what
<@!152896851660505088>
haven't watched ep2 yet but dialogue is what I want so I'll probably enjoy it <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
also I really loved Kitou Akari's voice in this role <:EveBless:555025000482996244>
I like just kicking back to watch anime more
hmm, it's not my kind of genre so I probably wouldn't read a manga about this
also give a raise to whoever did Kotoko's character design
dialogue was as good as I've heard everyone say, so I guess I'm watching this too now <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
finally watched ep1 of Kyokou Suiri / InSpectre
they're the sub group
search for MajiYuusha
it's still Yuuki Yuuna is a hero
I think Amazon did that, and their subs actually got the entire plot wrong
search the high seas <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
please
and the other 6 episodes which take place after the season 1
then season 2 is divided into the first 6 episodes which adapt the prequel light novel
there's season 1 with 12 episodes
<@!471416654346321930> Yuuki Yuuna is essentially two seasons, but with a bit of a twist
the official tl contacted the JP author and they made clear Myne is the intended name
katakana <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
season 2 should be even better <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
or well, that's not exactly right either, but while in a WN you can just go on as much as you want, a LN needs to have a proper development and conclusion in a certain amount of pages
technically LNs are the "definitive" version because the changes are stuff the author wanted to cut or clean up, but obviously some people prefer the original stuff instead
yeah
I decided to wait for the official releases so I'm stuck now
advantage of the wn is you get to keep going a lot further <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I don't think you can find it online
was about to say
^
let me search for a bit
actually I'm not sure the latter is possible outside JNovel club subscription <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
I have the .epub files themselves, or do you want to know where to read it online
sure <a:hinalaptop:550757299300466708>
be careful what you wish for <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
I definitely love the series, so I do recommend <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
and sometimes part of the fun is seeing her fail cause she gets overconfident <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but she does definitely get less selfish as it goes on
of course, taste is taste so if you don't like it that can't be helped
so it shouldn't be too long
I don't know exactly where you are since I only read the LN, but I'd say that around the second half of the first volume is where it picks up
since they're essentially a cleaned up version of the webnovel
on that note, I recommend reading the LNs for the available volumes
she definitely gets way better
ah
uhh you mean, when should you read the prequel prequel LN?
it's not like the best thing I've read, but I enjoyed it a lot
if I think about it like this I owe a lot to the franchise
I think NoWaYu is actually what awakened my passion for LNs <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
tkg did nothing wrong <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
but it's also my favorite part so <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
it's not needed to understand the story so don't worry
yeah it's another LN but it doesn't have an adaptation
alright, back to crying in the corner about no NoWaYu adaptation
I DM'd it to you anyway <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:IrohaWink:656662789166727218>
yeah, wait a sec
yeah, I think those are the best
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
won't go into detail cause spoilers for Death but
like, all of it
not only that, they actually missed out the entire plot
yeah CR subs for season 1 are actually decent
use the Asenshi ones, they're people I trust <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
let me check
I haven't actually seen those subs, they seem like they come with the dub which is scary <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I don't think they're planning to watch the movies first, yeah
Death seems like the type to download everything at once before watching <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
anyway: season 1 - 3 movies (Friends, Spirit, Promise) - Yuusha no Shou
so I understand
there's actually no batch of s2 with good subs
but it's like a matter of 10 seconds
I think technically there's an extra bit of content in the anime version in pre-OP stuff
I guess yeah
so you don't need to watch the movies
those 6 episodes originally came out as movies
so the beginning of s2
it's the prequel 6 episodes
<:KashumiSleeper:589621246426218508>
alright I've done my share of selling anime to people for today, gotta sleep
like the Gear Shinais
the OVAs are just very short extras
official subs don't have song lyrics so that's a hard PASs from me
Chyuu-PAS
it's not "fight while singing", but you do get fights to vocal songs at least <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I think so <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
it's difficult to sum up in few words
hmm kinda
<a:aWakarimasu:516101933371490304>
but the giraffe is a good meme
the show is not about the giraffe at least <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
"the giraffe thingy" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'd recommend you Revue Starlight maybe too <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
then from K-On! to Monogatari, my favorites are all over the place
that shows more what my taste is like <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Hibike Euphonium is one of my favorite shows
it's just that these shows are fairly unique in terms of the stuff I like
no I understand <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ends with those two and Nanoha
my mahou shoujo
I mean, there are tons of good anime out there, I don't know what you'll want to watch afterwards <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
buying the stuff you like to support <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
nope
<:EveBless:555025000482996244>
nothing to say other than this is the perfect season
Bandori s3 ep4-5
the next volume of Bookworm LN just came out <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
but this was really really good
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
each volume's quality is directly proportional to the amount of times Myne gets called an idiot
done with Bookworm volume 5
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
ah
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
what did Aya do
shield hero s2 probably means I'll need to tune out the entire anime fanbase for a season again
oh yeah ReZero 2 ofc
Oregairu s3, AdaShima and Tomozaki-kun adaptations
this yeah is stacked in my favorite genre
making those people mad is the sign of a good anime in the first place
<:K_KappaLUL:408369857671725056>
because all the complaints are people talking about the MMO mechanics
you can tell a show is good
it's awesome
Bandori s3, Koisuru Asteroid, Shield Girl, In/Spectre (or Kyokou Suiri), Magia Record, eventually gonna watch Railgun I guess,
I'm watching more stuff this season than anime from all of 2019
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I see we're trying to out-trigger each other
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
yeah, I did watch [your favorite anime]
anime I won't watch don't count for AOTY <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
as long as the anime adapts it well
with how good part 2 has been
might be AOTY this year too
<@!238855496797257729> <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
https://www.crunchyroll.com/it/anime-news/2020/01/22/ascendance-of-a-bookworm-dominates-akiba-soukens-popularity-poll-for-fall-2019-tv-anime
Monogatari is just the peak of fiction
this is just a guess, but I think they did that cause a full story like Kizu makes for a better first book to sell than the way Bake is structured
but if you're watching for the first time now there's no reason not to watch it immediately after Bake <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
(quick explanation: in the novels it was released directly after Bake, but the anime was delayed for production issues so that's why anime-watchers saw it later)
Kizu is best after Bake
yeah
<:TopDad:664848944517480489>
it is a very important pantyshot to be fair

live by these words <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
"Everyone but you has shit taste"
a wise man once said
Everybody's got their own taste
Emilia probably would too, with her personality
you now know the classic ReZero meme sound <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:EveBless:555025000482996244>
it's not a spoiler though
the Dragon does have a name, but I can't recall if they say it at this point in the show
ofc, with everyone saying Emilia looks exactly like the Witch, there's something there too...
the Witch of Envy and Dragon just exist
that's just lore
No, you're supposed to take what Ram said at face value <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Beatrice is very good
I don't think ceilings work like that
yeah that was a fun optical illusion <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ofc everything will be explained
(iirc there's the conversation between Ram and Roswaal being like "yeah maybe he's a spy cause he seems weird, but let's trust him for now")
and that time he hadn't done anything to be suspicious
he died in his sleep
remember that in the first loop
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
you did say last time that the two causes of death might be separate
of course, this is on top of the main reason he set off Rem's warning flags in the first place: acting buddy-buddy with them and like he already knew them
he's kind of an idiot for not realizing how suspicious this made him look <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
he had stolen a knife from the mansion, lied about where he was going, and set up camp somewhere he could spy on them
also this goes completely unstated in the show, but the loop where Subaru actually discovers she was killing him
well, she found him sneaking in the mansion at night towards Emilia's room <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that episode was the first really big moment for ReZero during the original airing
heeey, I was waiting for your reaction
since it's hard to convince people to buy a book by just telling them "hey the plot is that these characters talk and make puns a lot" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's just a well of creativity
Flip Flappers is pretty great <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
make sure you don't do that with the flipflops though <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the only ones pretending are the ones airing censored versions
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it was never pretending
my reaction was basically same as you word for word
nice to see you're enjoying it <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
LL is a sports anime anyway
but it wasn't enough
lol
same reason I watched it
and maybe that's it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the good idol shows are the first Idolmaster...
22/7
I'm not actually watching either so
I'll reserve judgement
I have no idea what that show is doing
uhhh
<a:CS1Shake:563437816533614610>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I only like good idols
strange how the season with no isekais is the one where I watch 5 times the usual amount of anime <:SmugCag:605781364381450241>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I don't want to know about this, thank you very much
just the sport happens to be dancing and singing
unlike LL where like I said, it's more like a sports anime
that one's actually a show about idols
I want the original Im@s to have more recognition <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KokroWaaaa:504405879915806738>
and recently got Nendo Kokoro too
I have Iori and Yayoi figures from Im@s <:EveBless:555025000482996244>
good taste
maybe because Nico wasn't there <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
don't know exactly what was so different
I dropped Sunshine ep2 cause I simply didn't enjoy it
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> puns
<:KasumiYay:504405876728266772> <:KokroWaaaa:504405879915806738>
but Bandori is great
Bandori... s1 is not an idol anime, s2 has some aspects of an idol anime, s3 is a mix of both
and yeah I also dropped Sunshine like a rock
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
not even a contest
in terms of game mechanics Bandori definitely is the best
so we'll probably see 3rd years graduating and RAS added
and the season schedule lines up nicely with the school year change
with the band showdown
seems like s3 will be the big year 2 finale
probably once year changes Sorano
but I love the character writing the most
game itself is fairly fun
<:KasumiXD:586236709017223178>
indirectly through having them spend all their savings, yes
Millaarc is already the main character though
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
especially since I don't play the game anymore so I watch the stories on youtube instead
I have my hands full enough following Bandori
but I also am not getting into another series <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
D4DJ seems like it'll be cool
they don't own the franchise
remember that it's not like all the money goes to Sunrise
404 not found
jii_delete Cypher's friends
anyway Bandori best anyway so everyone is wrong
if only people could understand there's no debate to be had and people just have different tastes <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but you do
so you want to get shows that you think people won't know
ofc, from everyone else too
and those shows are the ones that will play
where you can collect shows (up to a max number)
basically you get dropped on this board
the one I'm thinking of is Battle Royale
which one?
one of them is really fun
but there are new game modes now
Cypher, if you haven't played in two years you probably don't know
I'm not proud of it, but Oreimo 2 EDs are the one thing I know that none of my friends do
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
a Symphogear only round would be so fun
hope you can hear your JP lyrics
or Ashita e no Flugel for XV!
but be careful when it's Gyakkou no Flugel for season 1!
all of them valid answers
it can play for all G, GX and AXZ
nice meme: Nijiiro no Flugel
I understand why <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and you can't tell what the hell it is
with no lyrics
when the 20 seconds sample just plays an instrumental part
is getting sampled
the worst thing
no
it will also make you know just how hard it is to get songs right <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
it is
so I got to play a lot
I hadn't played for years but this past week some friends got into it
I've been playing that a lot just recently
on the other hand, BD quality on first watch is nice
which have the BD episodes on them
it's cause of the single releases
<:KokoroPeek:504405876816347136>
yes
<:KashumiSleeper:589621246426218508>
alright, I'm off to sleep then
should sleep
late for me too
fair
usually they're random
that's just one of the game modes
ah Rybo
some of them
wanna go have a round at it right now so you can tell the rules? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I just pick all my Nanohas
very fun
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
also lol it took me until now to realize you changed your username to OverDess <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Shirabe plz
OD, you mean you need links to the second half of s2?
ep5 is a really good place to stop
the show is really good with stuff like that
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/458220405358854145/670997861722488852/image0.png
the otaku culture influence was a big part of the show and of its character chemistry
It will also lose most of what makes S;G
and this has like lots of issues
the story and characters are fine, but basically gacha games are mostly all trash
same
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
stay away from it
ever
don't play the Starlight gacha game <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
wait really? I didn't know that <:HibikiWow:609475569188470963>
<a:Bananice:567673742386266113>
Bananice
recap + new scenes most likely
yeah
comrade <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
those are exactly the 4 shows I recommended to OD
yeah OD
Kaguya, you also seem to have the same tastes as me <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
already done <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I also recommend Flip Flappers <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
pdf or epub?
want them?
for the volumes
there are both .pdf and .epub links
oh, and just to reassure you, this is not a so-called yuribait series <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
still excited for the adaptation though <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
since most of it you spend it reading the characters' inner thoughts
I find AdaShima to be an incredibly fun read as a novel, I honestly have no idea how the anime will adapt its feeling
Shirabe cheating <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
but there's already more translated content than the anime will cover (I hope so at least, or the anime will be really rushed <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> )
it's getting an anime adaptation in 2020 too <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
it might be the single most enjoyable work of fiction I've been reading
https://dynasty-scans.com/series/adachi_and_shimamura_novel
as for me, read this:
is it time for me to shill my favorite LN again <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
we talk about LNs all the time as well
I'm sure manga is fine too
same
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
so K-On as first anime was a godsend
I feel like I might not have gotten into anime ever if I started with an action show (which to this day I mostly don't like, mahou shoujo is a bit different)
I started with K-On of all things
tfw my first anime is still #1 in my heart <:EveBless:555025000482996244>
StrikerS doesn't have a bad payoff, thankfully
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I don't mind that at all, but yeah the pacing isn't for everyone
it is very slow
Vivid Strike is as good as s1 imo
Vivid is... <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> welp
StrikerS is fairly different from s1 and A's, but it's good
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I kinda assume you have based on your taste but you never know <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Kaguya, have you watched Nanoha?
Slow Start <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
and even then I quit cause of my awful gacha luck <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
over the course of a week
the reason Bandori is the only good gacha game is because it takes like maybe 30 minutes to get a whole event story
too bad it's locked behind hours upon hours of grinding! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
are all 600-700 MBs small *per episode* compared to the Reinforce raws
YTT's BD subs for Symphogear AXZ
for example
it's normal cause people don't know how to encode <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
1.5+ GB per episode is a lot
could have 1080p be way smaller, but I've seen that group always have these bloated filesizes, probably shitty encoding
well, and also because the video files are way bloated
because it has 100+ episodes and 3 movies <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
the gods must be rewarding me for getting someone into AdaShima, cause the first half of volume 5 is out <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
she's so good
I'm really, really glad Kotoko keeps being the protagonist
great episode <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
the resemblance is striking

and I just figured it out, it's Chris <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the Steel Lady's
also I swear I've seen that exact design somewhere before
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that's a silly name
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the episode title said "Steel Lady"?
alright back halfway through cause
done rocking out to the OP, see you in 20 mins
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
shhh <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Kyokou Suiri
alright, time for Cute Girl Makes Up Bullshit episode 3 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
btw you don't need to ping me every time, I'll read <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
games and novels <:LetsDestroyABike:593568746694639839>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:AdachiFuee:664925476518625330>
unfortunately watching anime isn't my entire life
Bandori, Kyokou Suiri, Koisuru Asteroid, Shield Girl, Magia Record
it's like the third time I post this list but <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
probably gonna binge at the end of the season if I hear it's good
I'm not watching that since I'm already following a bunch of stuff
tfw my fluffy SoL yuri has made me more of an emotional mess than ReZero ever will <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but so painful <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
but yeah it was so good
let me say it was just evil of the translator to end there with the update <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
yup
that scene hit way too hard <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
I need to share this suffering with someone
<@!152896851660505088> aaaaa I just read the newest tl'd chapters of AdaShima volume 5
except me
having bad taste happens to everyone Aya <:RinkoPat:504405878913499158>
Kaguya has good taste in anime so that's a cute homie right there
this server is your homies
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
is the running gag for OD's Yuyuyu watchthrough that we just make up fake plots for everything
I know, I'm just memeing too <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
damn now OD will know about the cow god fight
woah spoilers
seems so <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
with all the LN titles
and Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero isn't even a long title by today's standards
you only omitted one word <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
happens to everyone
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
worth mentioning that outside of the initial reaction and like, one joke later on, Subaru himself never makes jokes about Ferris' gender anymore either
can't remember if literally everyone does, but also not everyone is aware of what Ferris is like
yeah
then like Melua said, a bunch of fans were like "hey that's what being trans is" and he made it officially canon
basically Ferris was written as trans in the first place, but not outright stated to be so (which I think it's just due to Tappei's inexperience with the subject)
there is like zero room for interpretation
Ferris is trans yes
Ferris is a really good character <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
that's not a spoiler <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
what was it
<:HibikiCry:601426670372782081>
wth Shirabe pinged me twice <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Yuuna is a bit dense
<:MikuLove:585596189802627072>
Tougou loves Yuuna very much
||I think episode 9 shouldn't be the first episode in a session <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ||
yeah Krika
seems alright
but I don't recommend ending at 8
either ep7 or 9 are good stopping points
but yeah just wanted to recommend
that means nothing to my timezone <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
how many episodes are you planning on watching btw?
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
and yeah the upgrades are stupid awesome
not in terms of how it works, but in terms of power level it has the same function
and yeah OD it's like X-Drive
in the first place, it's a silly discussion to have <:KaoruSigh:462933876881358848>
also music I don't mean anything by it since I don't know the source, but that sounds kinda like bullshit <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Tougou is a popular choice after all <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367> I prefer Karin myself
yeah
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
who's best girl
Kaguya while we're at it
all of ep4 was character development for her after all <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I haven't watched the shows for either Astolfo or Hideri so can't comment more on them
not every character is actually depicted as trans like Ferris is, so that's definitely a fair viewpoint
YuYuYu for short
Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru is the JP title
yeah
smell is very closely related to taste
but the udon <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
also damn you guys I was going to sleep but now I felt like re-reading my favorite chapters <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
plot's over, it's all SoL from here on out
NoWaYu adaptation when <:ChREEEEs:615251224295505927>
after the movies is when you can read either the manga or LN of the prequel that hasn't been adapted, if you want
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
can't post here cause spoilers though
btw Krika, I also have a more emotional VN video, if you want <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:ChisatoStare:506072710510673931>
is literally everyone in on the lie to OD meme <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeEaN9rRUAA
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
wait I can find it
and Yuuna's seiyuu just kind of falls to the ground
so a CG of them very close to each comes up
with a kiss scene
Yuuna and Tougou are rehearsing a play
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
[insert clip of Yuuna's seiyuu playing the scene from the VN]
don't talk about what's to come too much <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
speaking of novels, my Owarimonogatari LN just came in <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

actual spoilers
Yuyuyu has literally black boxes in the novels <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'd recommend the Kizu movies before Nise, but the other way around also woks
btw Aya, yes you finished ep9 in relation to the original series
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
new ED remix is what I'm here for
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
also it's not tl'd right?
I'm missing Kud Wafter cause I didn't play it <:TopDad:664848944517480489>
that's what I remember the most from it so I have a fondness
but Clannad is just really enjoyable in the comedy scenes
I don't really disagree <:TopDad:664848944517480489>
got my Pokedex to 96/100 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
only cleared one route but I've spent like 15 hours replaying common doing all the optional events and achievements <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Summer Pockets has been really good so far <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
-
VN
LB: 10/10, Rewrite: 9/10, Clannad 8/10, Tomoyo After: 7.5/10, Planetarian: 7/10, Air: 6/10, Kanon: 5/10
Anime (Miku help us)
LB: s1 6/10, s2 8/10, Rewrite: s1 3/10, s2 5/10, Clannad & After Story: 7/10, Air: 4/10, Kanon: 6/10
alright <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
do I have to get into my Key rankings <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
so you're planning to just marathon the whole thing tomorrow? <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
which was the last episode you watched again?
don't watch the Rewrite anime plz <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
there is literally a whole Pokemon minigame in SP <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
both Rewrite and Summer Pockets have like a huge list of achievements to get by doing silly things in the game <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
what I love about Key VNs is their uniqueness
probably better than the actual VN I think
I watched them <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Planetarian?
yeah Rewrite is their... 3rd latest VN? after that was the first Angel Beats, and then this
it also has a table tennis minigame that's too addicting for its own good <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's really fun, I love the humor in these games
their latest VN, Summer Pockets, has a fan tl out so I started reading it <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I don't know if you know about Key, they're the studio who made Clannad, Little Busters and a bunch of other famous VNs
feeling pretty content after finishing a route in the new VN I'm playing <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
if you really quit at Nise you don't have much to remember <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
this game's surprisingly good at spooking you in weird ways
gonna put the game on hold until tl is complete
I also got done with another route in SP, so only one more left before the yet-untranslated true route
it gets heavy listening to the whole playlist at once
I'm not too huge on Maeda's style of writing so I still hit my limit though <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah, cause he gets to sum up the core concept in 5 minutes
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's hitting me that most of these songs are just Maeda making up Key heroine #72 and having a song about her
I think Owari no Sekai Kara is a notch above the others so far, but they're all good. Killer Song in particular I loved the instrumentals <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
alright, stopping after the fourth one cause I need to go have dinner <:KirikaBreadNom:664852234399645737>
1st song was really good <:HibikiWow:609475569188470963>
I already worked around the issue though, starting now <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
yup
the yt videos are 360p only <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I'll let you know once I do <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
ah yesterday it was late so I didn't
hey Shirabe agrees with my ratings <:TopDad:664848944517480489>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
in the novel Araragi describes Kiss-shot eating the leg as "so gruesome we can't get an adaptation now"
to meme, of course <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I know what I'll be listening to for a while
<:KokroZOOM:589621176540725252>
<:MisakiSweat:589621246673551387>
I'm really loving the song though
well, there doesn't seem to be info on the story anyway
ah yeah I'm on the site but I was feeling too lazy to read the JP <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
any info what it's about?
at least with NagiNagi and Maeda the music promises to be good
oh I missed the news about this it seems
oh which new game?
wouldn't quite say it's a kamige like Hatsuyuki Sakura, but it was a strong 9/10 <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I played <https://vndb.org/v18842> in Japanese
I decided to go deeper into the Saga Planets list <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
speaking of untranslated VNs
ah, Kud Wafter reminded me
only thing is the 2nd s1 OP
doesn't exist
what anime
lul rewrite anime
also seeing *that* scene animated was worth the entire thing
Refrain adaptation was nice enough
Little Busters
Konosuba easy choice <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
so I wanted her to be happy
but Rena very cute
while I really liked the ep2-3 arc in the end, at the beginning I had no reason to care about any of these characters
honestly, the character designs are the biggest appeal <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
if it didn't have people constantly making Madoka comparisons it'd be better, but obviously as a spinoff that's tough <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I'm actually liking this quite a bit
(as an aside, watched them literally 2 hours before the YTT subs came out, I feel trolled <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> )
finally watched Magia Record ep3-4 now that Doki isn't using a totally shit video source <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's a metaphor
no
indeed, I've never seen anyone use the term sjw who wasn't just insulting someone <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Ino-senpai <:MikuLove:585596189802627072>
bless Sakura-senpai
it's true that the characters aren't as exaggerated, but I kinda prefer it like that
everything flows really smoothly <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
the animation, the timing of the jokes
Doga Kobo's always been good at this kind of shows
it's just the quality
with the movies slotted earlier on because that's the *planned* release order that they got delayed out of <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Monogatari is just release order
yeah that's the thing
they just suddenly realized it "fell outside their services"
and no there wasn't
that's not how licensing works though
(Anime Maru is a satire site, but still, this line was just gold <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> )

hey, at least we got a good Anime Maru article out of it
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
then 3 episodes in realize what it's about
how do you literally start a dub of a show
yeah that's what I meant
Animelab picked it up afterwards since I assume they saw the chance to follow up on that dumb move <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
cause they somehow were releasing a dub of it but didn't even know what the show was about
Funimation did pull Ishuzoku Reviewers entirely, yes
<:GWcentrallGoodMorningBOYE:395626835783712768>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah Netflix has been trash
cause some genius thought "oh the second half is the same, we don't need it right"
they picked up Pop Team Epic and released only half of each episode
we could instead talk about Netflix trying to fuck up the industry for the 237th time instead <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
just trying to explain since someone asked
I mean, I personally don't care one bit <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
zero communication between the management side, and the dub production side
it means there was literally
just caught up on OD's reactions <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
to be going that far
Tougou's kind of losing it
the future!
it's "300 years after Vertexes started showing up education"
technically in the show it's not Asian education
it's cause it happened right as her character development happened
and yeah
but also <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
so it's entertaining in a way <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
well, seeing someone speak with notebooks is a fresh experience <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
waiting for OD to come back once he's done
I don't wanna say anything for this one
best moment in the show
ironically I'm enjoying Magia Record more too <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and since that's what I find most important in anime I enjoyed Yuyuyu more
characters were the weak point of Madoka for me too
OD, now that you're reaching the climax I recommend just watching and posting impressions later <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367> unless you don't get distracted, honestly I don't know how people live-post as they watch <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
episode 9 is my favorite episode <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
sasuga Kaguya
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the other day
I posted it
was released as movies first
the first half of s2
yup
it was 41 fairy activations <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
everyone give a guess <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
without fairies
counting every time the Heroes would have died in season 1
someone made a video
but yeah I'm surprised Itsuki gets through fine
well, technically it's not getting Tougou quite right <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
speech-to-text
sdasdas
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's so... readable
you know, I'd never guess this was text-to-speech
meanwhile I'll go post more art of the birthday girl <a:hinalaptop:550757299300466708>
I've rewatched that scene too many times <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
today is the birthday of best Yuusha <:KasumiYay:504405876728266772>
oh speaking of
can't let the people we need to save the world die! <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
that's surprisingly many series it turns out!
not at all
no
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
1st of 3 chapters of a new LN got tl'd today
oh right, for everyone else
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's hard to explain it all without context
keep going
no
she was adopted by a different family?
makes sense
I don't think the movies were out on BD by the time s2 aired so
the Shinjuu is the "gods of the land" who sided with the humans
yes
Shinjuu-sama
one island
Shikoku
just
not even Japan

world's fucked enough to need a new calendar
welcome to why the show takes place in *300 D.E.*
just posted a meme
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
we're all waiting on OD
this chat right now is the 4 reaction guys meme
Aya what are you doing in the middle of this discussion <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but then she retired after she lost her memories so they returned her to her original parents
since she would need them
and they gave her a family with government connections
Tougou was adopted by the Washio family cause she was a Hero
Shirabe <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
well, "very happy"
yeah don't mind us <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
in s1 too, there's a system to prevent transformations, but it's not very flexible
-san does NOT mean miss/mister
yeah, we should have left that behind in the 90s
god Amazon subs just make me angry remembering them <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I sure do love calling my best friend in middle school "Miss"
s2
so the plot literally makes no sense anymore
in the official subs of s2, all the "gods of the land" and "gods of the heavens" just got subbed as "god"
but since you got to here, I can tell you one of the things they screwed up
yeah I know <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
that literally got the entire plot wrong
for people who watched with official subs
I feel so bad
end of endings
second half of season 2 is the finale
no
only half of your sentence was true in the first place, it's fine <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
you people <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I should be sleeping <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Yuyuyu feels very Symphogear in how the last 3-4 episodes just keep on ramping and ramping up the climax
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Tougou was never straight
yeah
||Gin's death||
it felt like the anime came straight out of my dreams
you know, I used to fantasize about how they would animate that scene

THE RED YUUSHA IS ALWAYS THE BEST
KARIN IS JUST THE BEST
MIYOSHI KARIN NO JITSURYOKU DA
~~I totally don't have her whole monologue memorized in Japanese or anything~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
oh boy it's time
the most knowledge <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
it's very minor at least
we're about to get the 2nd best scene in the show
||that's what I meant by not flexible, as it can't tell that while Tougou is indeed determined to fight, she isn't on the Shinjuu's side||
just for a while though
Astral ||the episode OD is watching right now, has Yuuna unable to transform cause of her unstable emotional state||
you said you weren't gonna read it I think
I mentioned to you before
the other prequel novel
just complaining about bad s2 subs
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but you were forced to gacha and each time you lose someone
started you off with every unit
what if Yuuki Yuuna's mobile game
but other times yeah it's arbitrary
that were taken away
it seemed to be the parts that got hit
during Karin's fight
she lost everything else instead <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Tougou is definitely a "my girl over the world" kind of person too
if she loses even her friends then that would be a fate worse than death for her for sure
who can guarantee Tougou that someone in the club won't lose their memories again
but uhh to sum up the spoiler-free part
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I missed one part
it's a spoiler
no
oh
oh
Astral's I don't think is a spoiler?
||the Hero Records||
because that's the intro
literally the only thing is that the episode versions have an extra 10 seconds at the very beginning for each second half
just the length of two episodes each
but also Tougou is only 15, and mentally unstable after everything she's witnessed
yeah it's selfish
"I'll die with my friends instead"
"I don't want to spend my whole life suffering"
even in the first generation
Red Yuusha still best
<:KashumiSleeper:589621246426218508>
have a good one
alright I'm going to sleep
still early for that <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
who can find me that one gif of the little girl running towards Misaka with candy and then past her
Railgun fans unite
don't think that one's actually available in the west yet
makes me wonder if they'll include OVA2 as well
yup, OVA next week
<:Genocide:604104761406652419>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
YOU DIDN'T KNOW????
WAIT AYA
it adapts some short stories
slice of life episode, as far as I know
instead of what would be eps 12-13
is airing the OVA next week
the re-run
no you will
aside from who the characters are
not really
which I haven't seen yet
since they're airing the OVA
speaking of, next week I'll join you as a first timer <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it just keeps getting better from now on too
Aya sees the light
<:remEhehe:358881747833847809>
it didn't help that despite her being the #1 seiyuu of 2019 I didn't watch almost anything with her in it <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Inorin and Kitou Akari have a similar tone of voice
Kaguya I know exactly what you mean <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
why does my ability to recognize a seiyuu in 2-3 lines not have irl applications <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
if we could measure anime by the amount of balls it has it'd be #1 without a fight
Mal has been a meme since it was created
the return of nice boat
well played
MILLHI
sdjkasjdkasjk
an expression worth more than a thousand words
isekai war Hibiki
yeah, just wanted to make sure you saw my comment about the movies <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
ah before my recommendation gets washed away <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> <@!256945399338631168> about monogatari watch order
been busy <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
'sup <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
is best imo
with movies slotted in after bake
broadcast order
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
because of the new username
no I mean
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
and didn't notice
I was waiting
wait Aya that's you
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
after that kanji I don't know came up
alright I was good enough to read the first 7 lines
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
anyway now I have to wait like 2 months for volumes 5-6-7 to arrive
it's my favorite LN
I never knew how small these were wth
<@!152896851660505088>
and she had plenty of reasons to be upset at what he'd been doing
like she said, she's not the ideal girl in Subaru's imagination
yeah but you can't just expect her to get it
do yourself a favor
watch Railgun only
same
but they just haven't happened yet
there are some scenes they cut which set up the s2 arc
those will likely be a few weeks from now
but no new scenes
there are some scenes where the animation is redone/edited
Miso, not yet
I'm also a VN lord <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
to set up s2
yeah, and the extra scenes are all towards the very end
rerun or not makes no difference
Aya's watching for the first time
nah it's the same
it's hard to watch though
I'll just say that was my 2nd favorite episode <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm the opposite <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> can't watch with other people
it's still the greatest trolling in anime history <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah, I meant for the anime audience <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I guess they knew not many people would actually listen
these actually have like a ridiculous amount of foreshadowing wth <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
sentences I never thought I'd hear
the Monogatari BD commentaries are great

time to hurt myself by reading that part in Japanese
Amazon said they'd arrive in April, this is the best surprise
<@!152896851660505088> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa they're HERE
:run
the "true" order is watching only the cooking spin-off <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
mad
real
he got real mad <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
my friends got me one for my birthday <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
still not exactly sane <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
with his anger
he regained the will to live
it is one of the two legendary episodes
btw Aya I was asleep when you pinged for ReZero but I do always read what you say <:DMJii:549819519082692608>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Betelgeuse is the name of a real star
I hear it's plot relevant <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
(btw, it's Petelgeuse, don't trust subs <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> )
ye
ah to explain, you set the game on "Watched Only" so it doesn't give you random 1970s shows, and the game will only pick songs from someone's MAL/anilist
I hope none of you have like the 30 Pokemon movies or something in your anilist <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
it's about the naming <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Gintama does though
One Piece I don't think counts as multiple seasons
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
gundam...
it's alright, my Railgun game is on par <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
this server is full of Index fans
I just realized
oh no
also I only know one index OP
happens more often than you'd like
"getting season'd" means choosing the wrong season for a show <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
just the anime
it's not song names
you can filter shows
what do you mean you don't like to hear Apple 3 times because it plays in 3 seasons
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
we should do Symphogear only rounds too, those are fun <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I watched 4 seasonals in all of 2019 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
also you said you haven't played in two years but I play fairly often so I can tell you about the new stuff <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
make sure you have an anilist set up btw
I know it happens because I saw a few frames of it in the trailer
speaking of, the next week should have the first rerun fully original scene I think
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
was playing around the other day and found a Symphogear only room
I'm up <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
then what songs would you know <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
for Symphogear every ending and opening also plays as insert <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
21, turning 22 in November <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I lost a childhood <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
also I guess I didn't know what anime meant until HS <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
never was one for TV much
I only saw the popular ones at lunch time
was there really? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
2012 for me <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
though that's because I never put in dropped shows
also that's like twice my amount of shows <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
you're watching Utena? <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
I admit I made my anilist entirely just to play AMQ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Cypher was faster <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
who's the one next to HanaKana, she looks so familiar but I can't place her
energetic
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
he's also pretty deranged by now
let's be fair, Subaru being Subaru would probably have fucked up even with OP powers
||turnaround might be closer than you expect <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> ||
sure
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Subaru is a car, not a bike
sorry you're right
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
he's a first timer and we're enjoying his reactions <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
nope
hell yeah I am <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
my personal favorite
it's the other legendary episode
well, look forward to next week
you mean you were enjoying the first ones? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I didn't know Saaya was that popular
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
the female ranking has good taste though
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
use some different syllables
Satoshi -> Satsuki/Satoru
also plz that naming sense for the children
I don't pokemon <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
wdym it was the best thing ever
Wilhelm doesn't have two whole volumes of backstory for nothing
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
the #10 show on that list is the best one among them <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
this is ep22-23
ah no
the new ending yet
I haven't seen
oh shit
yes
we didn't have that cliffhanger 4 years ago (though a lot of people spoiled it <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634> )
just so you know, those whole last 4 minutes or so were what's new for the anime version
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
and it may have been delayed but season 2 is coming too <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
don't speak in past tense, it's not over yet <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so I also watched <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
they did add a new scene to this finale
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
best order is Railgun s1 -> Railgun s2 -> Railgun s3 and that's it <a:HinaSlowlyRunsOutOfTheDoor:564188497309597709>
don't do it <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
so much
Index s1 ruins the best Railgun arc in S2
no
but to each his own <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I thought Index was "not bad" until I tried to rewatch it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I know I'm in the minority around here though <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I'm just memeing cause I think Index is very bad <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:HibikiCry:601426670372782081>
that's a really good sign, I would have been worried about the pacing
oh it looks like Bookworm anime won't be rushing to be done with part 2
for anyone who's watching it, how's the Argonavis anime
afaik nobody's doing good subs for s3, I watched the raws
the official subs were so bad at times <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
it *might* be the AB prequel
the patch for the Angel Beats visual novel is out, if anyone here cares about that <:MeekuPeeku:675007115496259606>
he was Kaneko in disguise all along
was Maeda faking being sick so he could write Symphogear XV
<:TopDad:664848944517480489>
Maeda only knows how to write in VN length
let's hope it goes better this time
the last Key-P.A. Works collab was <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
my happiness is limitless
finally announced
AdaShima volume 9
Millhi
oh right
seems good so far
I booted it up last night to see if everything worked and played just a bit
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
then I can call it quits
I just want a TK route
maybe now that Maeda isn't sick anymore he'll get back to writing these
also I thought it was supposed to be 6 parts?
I meant just part 1
well yeah in that sense yes
oh
oh boy
I once tried to 100% Clannad, can't be bigger than that can it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
from the translator's guide <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
> Angel Beats: 1st Beat is an outlandishly convoluted game. A single playthrough of the Matsushita route can involve upwards of TWO HUNDRED choices, and a preposterous number of those choices have lasting effects on incidental dialogue, change the manner in which characters react to you, or in some cases cause major, dramatic shifts in the game's plot.
Key VNs are my favorites in terms of how they work, so I'm really looking forward to playing <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
but I'm not holding out hope
I'd love to see it animated finally
one of the background characters in ep1 has the best ones
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
but it was written by someone who loves twintails as much as me
Twintails might not have been the best show
but the galaxy brain move of leaving Otonashi's sexuality in the player's hands since romance isn't a big focus is 10/10
the heavy parts are <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> though
no matter how many times I replay I get new events
the VN is really unique in how it entirely adapts to your decisions
I'll just say I've been having the time of my life
I keep having no idea whether to post about the Angel Beats VN here or in gaming
also good taste
very
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
all people of culture here
they have an option to turn off the romaji lyrics for the songs if you only care about the meanings <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm the fansub dealer around here
I got it
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/588426470003703834.png?v=1
though it's been a while
also I don't think Hidive has song subs?
but I remember ep3 having a bunch of mistranslated lines
I can't remember off the top of my head
it is
the RippleSubs release is best, it's a re-edit of the best fansubs for the show
the official subs for Revue are incredibly bad
they're a major part of the show
and find the version that subs the songs well
also since I don't think anyone answered you, 100% go for subs
I haven't watched it so
you mean AssClass?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yup
yeah <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
the writer of the show is one of my favorites, I feel like his writing just gets me
but I really liked its... heart? don't know how to describe it
the story felt like it could have been better
I liked it quite a lot myself
TrySail has lots of great songs
Cobalt is great
hell yeah
every time someone brings up AssClass I have to re-read the name and confirm the disappointment that I'm still the only person to have watched Classroom Crisis
hi <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I have 3 Date A Live nendos and I don't even like the show <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
all the time walking around conventions <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
all I know about Teekyuu is that it drives me mad on AMQ <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
might give it 10/10
were amazing
the other two routes
I 100%'d the Angel Beats VN
speaking of reading
and not "here's Nobunaga but doggo"
unless they actually make it an historical one
I know who he is, I still want him out of my anime
leave him in his grave
what is Japan's fixation with the guy
stop them
there are too many nobunaga shows
nobody likes Symphogear around here right
need to watch that
Anne Happy <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
yeah I thought it was pretty popular too
Simoun's ED is 🔥
I was genuinely shocked to see someone mention Simoun here yesterday
meanwhile
yeah it's not that obscure
Puchimas is the best idol anime
Girlish Number
if we're talking relatively obscure shows
those people are wrong <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
I highly doubt that kind of show settles on a pairing for a long long time
I've not read the novels so this is speculation but
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
^
who isn't really grown up
having a crush on her teacher is just another of the aspects that make Reina someone who thinks she's smarter than she actually is
hmm I'd argue it still isn't
not like Hibike doesn't have yuri anyway
and about Hibike, it's more like, romance is 0.1% of the show and people go nuts over that instead of all the other good content
nah you're totally valid
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Hibike is one of my favorite all time shows and I'll FIGHT people on it
||Hibiki:"I knew that's what I was forgetting!"||
hey how about cutting all the Shouko development from that same arc and cramming it as the first 30 minutes of an already rushed movie <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
even though in the LN ||their first kiss is during Futaba's arc (ep 7-8)||
oh lmao I forgot about that
but plz they live together, sleep in the same bed and raise a child
NanoFate is just less central to Nanoha then HibiMiku is to Sympho, so it doesn't get focused on as much
you're jumping through mental hoops to tell yourself it's not yuri
I'd argue Nanoha is in the same boat as Gear
whether on purpose or not
those people are just being dumb
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
possibly backwards order <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and I somehow went two years past when it was made without realizing it was a thing
I'd been watching anime since before Crunchy so
I always just torrented to get the highest quality
with a passion
hate crunchy
yeah I just
since honestly, if I end up watching trash I don't particularly want to support it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
to support
I tend to buy merch for stuff I like
it's very unique
torrents <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's 3am
alright I need to peace out too
yeah it would
despite the crazy on one side
they clearly had a soft spot for one another though
but you can read it that way
it's subtler than any of the yuri pairings at least <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
neon lights
bolded font
very
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Tiki was literally programmed to be in love with him, she gets a pass
judging by how Carols mixed up gear and yuri in the sentence, you are correct Iski
Official subs outside of Muse Asia never have any sort of typesetting at all
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
||AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA||
that's all
<@!152896851660505088> I read the end of AdaShima volume 6
right, I forgot
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
what an incredibly charming show
watched ep1
anyway guess I'm watching this now <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
apparently there's a movie planned <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
thank you kirichan
it's the origin of ayaya
it should be fixed eventually
it's been slow lately cause they had to change stuff with the servers
I think I read the first 2 chapters and then was waiting for it to be over
ah yeah the miko-focused series?
there is also the fact that there's the one song released that seems like it would be perfect as NoWaYu OP
we're getting the short anime with the YuYuYui characters so I wouldn't think they'd make also a full length one for it
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
NoWaYu is far and away my favorite part of the series so I really hope the last announcement is an adaptation <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
good, it shouldn't
sorry if that's how I came off <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
oh I'm not blaming you for what you said, it was just more in general that nowadays I see lots of shows being described as "bait" and I'm like <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
it's just that the plot doesn't focus on that
just because they don't start dating it doesn't mean the anime was just stringing you along
I just think that yuribait has a really negative connotation
I felt solo coming
wouldn't say that's "bait"
in Yuyuyu there's one character who's gay for another but it doesn't go really anywhere cause it's not central to the show, unlike HibiMiku
btw I don't like describing a show as "yuribait" <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> that word got so out of hand
Yuuki Yuuna is great do watch
NoWaYu anime may finally become a reality <:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
there is another announcement coming too
I did end up enjoying it, at least <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
it's plenty weird, to the point that no matter someone's taste I wouldn't be able to say if they would like it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I've watched Simoun
they have a lot of fun with it
ah, that's not to say it stops being entertaining <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
And don't worry, the Engrish never gets worse than smol Karen in episode 1 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I've ben watching Kinmoza too and it's great!
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
here are all the info you'd ever need if you're interested <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<https://todokanaitl.github.io/>
it's not the best translation ever or anything, but it's passable
no
yeah
Closing Chapter is tl'd in English
oh but Hectan
and yeah it also depends on the novel itself, the ones full of chuuni and hard kanji are <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
but I kinda glaze over most sentences I just don't get
showing my support and all that
I did buy and am slowly reading volumes 5-8 of AdaShima in JP though
light novels are impossible for me in JP cause I entirely rely on audio for context
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I'm bad at kanji but I understand spoken JP fine, so it was not that bad cause WA2 is one of the super rare VNs with a voiced protagonist
well I'm kidding and now I know a bunch of JP, but I first jumped into Closing Chapter when I could barely read it
be like me and don't learn JP but still experience untranslated VNs <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the anime's like, 1/10 of the whole thing
haven't heard of the former, but for WA2... let's just say I'm a big VN fan and the WA2 visual novel is still the #1 rated in Japan
alright, just so I know to be careful when talking about it so I don't spoil <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
btw since you like BiY, have you read the manga/the Sayaka novels?
yes
which is also outstanding
speaking of, the author is the same as the author of the Bloom into You Sayaka light novel
it's a yuri romance light novel
it's my favorite yuri <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I can't wait for the AdaShima anime to come out since nobody will read LNs <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
twintails are the ultimate hairstyle
There is a new Nanoha "anime project" (this could also mean a movie, we have no details) coming eventually
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
Hidamari Sketch is so good
the anime won't cover all of them, so I absolutely recommend reading them after, at least
I'm dying cause I have nobody to talk to about them <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Lank are you reading the AdaShima novels <:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
aaaaaaaaaa I KNOW RIGHT
a 2nd season won't improve things that much nor be popular enough to make lots of money
the anime boosts manga sales once
it is, very specifically, the Kirara adaptations
it depends on many factors
Doga Kobo isn't really the one who gets to decide if they do sequels or not
but I honestly couldn't tell you if that improved the experience or not <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I've started watching cgcdt shows that don't have fansubs raw, since I mostly understand
I watched Koisuru Asteroid without subs so <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ez, learn JP <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
recently I started Kiniro Mosaic and it's been really good too <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
haven't watched that
like you said earlier, HidaSketch is an underrated gem
I didn't like Yorimoi as much as most people seem to, however <:CarolPout:617039564313198602>
since Hibike is more of a character drama
I kinda consider it and K-On two different genres though
I super love Hibike too (can you tell by my username <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367> )
well, season 2 is, I should specify
K-On is the first anime I watched and it's still the best in my eyes <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
CGDCT somehow never stopped being my favorite genre
Slow Start <:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
I didn't watch it but well, it became infamous enough <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
before the image loaded somehow I knew what show it would be
and yeah Millhi, bad animation just makes me <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> most of the time knowing the state of the industry
yeah Hanabi it's a matter of preference
Monogatari is like the high point of all anime and I still found myself liking the novels a bit more because of the extra dialogues/details/development
I don't care that much about the pretty pictures
I guess this is why I tend to read novels a lot
agreed <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
maybe this is why I'll never understand people who rate Sympho G higher than s1 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
obviously I don't want the show I'm watching to look horrible, but it's definitely the least of my priorities
people who judge shows on animation are a mystery to me <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Aka has more wisdom than most of the world combined, Kaguya is a good Jump series
still haven't watched
don't remind me of my procrastination <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
what if I never watched shounen in the first place though <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
which is why it's rare to find yuri in them
there is still this idea that "action" shows are shounen
I think it's more a matter of demographic
type S has kinda died
I feel bad, I haven't actually read it yet <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Otherside Picnic?
Monogatari series is novels, technically
technically there is the target demographic too, but things are varied enough now that you can't really say that
that's all there is
length
Monogatari doesn't count
they've genuinely become my favorite LNs ever
I can't get into a lot of recent anime because of fast pacing <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I feel like it's understandable given that she's just a 15yo girl who had all this shit dropped on her at once
well, opinions and all that
"I can't be your friend because I'm terrified you might die anytime while doing things that you won't tell me about" is a more interesting conflict than "please don't fight" that I've seen many times before
this is definitely an ultra-hot take, but I also like s1 Miku more
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
still like s1 Bikki more
wait I'll take that back, the ChrisBasa (as in, the way their relationship changed) in G was great
Ver as a meme is great though, in GX he's totally great <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
remember when they said they searched for him for a day after the battle at Kadingir and couldn't find him, then we see him and he's literally STILL THERE
I just mean that Ver was incredibly dumb and his plan was dumb and it only worked cause the show had to make everyone else dumber than him
that scene was pretty much the best animated of the season <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Boulé that's one of my favorite episodes <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
was
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
also yeah Millhi I was watching Tamayomi <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
in short, I think everyone's character arc in G is worse than in s1, Ver was terrible as a villain and Maria somehow worse <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
wait what in the twintails
oh no her head is falling off <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I managed to play XDU for all of half a day because of the collab before realizing I hated it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
implying I'm not procrastinating all my responsabilities <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I've been making slow progress reading the novels in JP, and the translation is now coming out faster than I can read <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Adachi really understands

volume 7 chapter 1 + the 2 omake came out and I went AAAAAAAAAAAAA once again
I'm very grateful every time <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
I always ping you just to shout at you
I didn't forget you Millhi <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Kindred Spirits <:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
me @ adashima except novel and not anime

I've already found my ultimate yuri story, I just don't have anyone else to talk to about it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
anyway let me actually get to watch some anime rather than just talking about it
I saw it on my TV when I was like 5 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
which are a major part of the show
since song lyrics and all that
and even then, you might argue it is explicit
it just isn't explicit
Symphogear isn't subtle about the yuri
don't you heh me <:Ver:704169051391524875>
gonna pass on that <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
>read more hentai
cause it's only 4 strokes
s2 was pretty great
^
if you're willing to watch a lot at once, I recommend eps 1-9, 10-17, 18-26 in 3 sittings <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
it's 26 episodes, can you do it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
rating the show in the heat of the moment, s1 is a 8.5/10 or so
wtf the last episode was soooo good
lol I just noticed during the last episode, but I appreciate how the subs for Alice and Karen specifically use British spellings <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>


KinMoza good
man, Nao's broken Japanese as Karen is so endearing <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
as in, they literally mistranslated the main plot
the official subs for s2 are the really bad ones
let's just say the show isn't as simple as it first looks
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I'd like to address your concerns but spoilers <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
episode 5 -> 6 is a turning point for the show
no number can express the way I feel about a show
I tried to rate things once, but I ended up hating it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
basically, that the good surpassed the flaws anyway
if you enjoyed something but think it's bad, it just means it was good at entertaining you
quality is subjective
volume 1 works with just the context from the stuff the anime covered
anyway, I'd recommend reading the rest of the manga before volume 2
v3 is the last one and it's Sayaka in university
also includes events from the year before Yuu joined their HS
then you're mostly right
volume 1 is specifically Sayaka's life before BiY
not exactly
it's out as an e-book
<@!160142617940590594> I've read both volumes of the Sayaka novel currently out, they're great
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
the KinMoza s2 OP is just a concentrated dose of happiness
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
go do that <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I did check it out in the first place cause I love the writer
just off ep1 this show completely grabbed me
Shaft great
I've started watching Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
everyone in this show looks amazing
<@!152896851660505088> learning Yashiro lore <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Denpa Onna gets a solid 9/10 from me <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367> one of those rare shows that just appeals to me specifically
just play the fully voice acted PSP game for the ending of your choice! <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
best girl didn't even make it into the anime adaptation <:GWmythicalFeelsSadMan:374568771421208577>
Kirino is very close to worst anime girl for me <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
top tier choice
Sakamoto Maaya
dsdasbdhasbh
who is voicing Echidna I can't tell
yeah the people at the top are mostly the old conservative guys but pro-LGBT movements are a thing in Japan too
like with most things, it's more that people shouldn't generalize a whole country's behavior
it's almost like the OP frames him ||exactly the same way as the "doom flags"|| <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
we all know Kaiki is the best Monogatari waifu
they don't have genders but waifus don't need to be girls
WA2 is the best romance VN full stop
Amagami is a VN so everyone having endings is normal, though it's certainly rare to see it in the anime adaptation
I stopped reading both BokuBen and 5Toubun early, but I still went to check reddit threads for the final chapters' reaction cause I enjoy a good salt mine
<:KasumiXD:586236709017223178>
they've certainly had more development than some protagonists in lesser series get
nah, everyone in the Student Council is a main character by now
Kaguya's such a good example of how great a romance manga can be when it's not tied down by harems and bad writing
stay as far away from harem manga fanbases as possible
Aoyama's so good
<:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
this reminds me, I should start reading Arc 6
since (very very light spoilers) ||whatever the Al scenes are building up to won't be part of season 2||
well, at least that one is understandable
still sad they didn't manage to fit the cut Rem scenes in
the real answer is that only 0.1% of LN adaptations manage to adapt enough content for a real ending <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
something like that
or 3
in two weeks
here's the link whenever you feel like <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<https://streamable.com/0711d>
or that
I can get you a link to the scene
post credits ep25 was the only new scene outside of some edited better-looking animation
yeah
they adapted the arc so well <:KasumiPray:675007115865096192>
don't rewatch it and ruin it for yourself <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> I think the show hasn't aged well
but you can think of it as a romcom too, in terms of the tropes used especially
neither the comedy or romance are exactly center stage, it's more of a serious SoL
I'd say it does
since they both go way past confession stage
I've heard the comparisons between the two
ofc, this is all subjective but man was it good to reread
the balance between seriousness and comedy is on point
and the entire extended cast is likable
every single character is developed in ways that you can go back like 60 chapters and be like "ooohhh this makes total sense knowing [...]"
there are basically no cliches
I think the way the characters develop is pretty much unlike any romance story out there. Aka clearly "gets" romance and tries to present what real relationships are like and their issues
I might need help
On a completely different note, I've spent the past 3 days rereading the Kaguya manga over and over thinking how it may literally be the best written manga I've read
the movies
3.0 is like "IT'S ALL WRONG GO BACK"
2.0 is like "here's what modern fans want"
it was essentially Anno giving the finger
the only thing I tell people is that it's an experience worth having
I've never really tried to put into words what the show made me feel, I don't know if I could
Eva discourse is neverending
when being tsundere should be the result of her personality
yeah nowadays it's just "oh I'll make this girl a tsundere"
<:ArisaSmile:589621244153036812>
<@!476058996315389953> you're right
inventing the term tsundere is the worst thing anime fans have done
it's such a fundamental part of anime
I agree on everybody should watch Eva, no matter what you end up thinking of the experience
it's actually one of the few anime that got me to cry though <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:ARRYAYA:717853643629658132>
yes <:KasumiXD:586236709017223178>
<:Ayaya:717853643713282088>
I know that's not exactly the point, but to be fair Lily was really young at the time and she, well, died so...
ohhh someone watching Im@s
because it's the most popular
they're all bad in different ways
also don't worry, I did drop the manga too. I'm ashamed of how long I held out hope though
I never thought I'd say this, but I do think SAO is better than this
not a single character has a braincell, every girl introduced falls for the MC for literally no reason, the MC himself is incredible trash who never develops past like chapter 5. It should tell you something that he is still using the rental service, and with like 4 different girls no less, and we're past like over 100 chapters
it makes BokuBen and Nisekoi look like high art by comparison
Rental Girlfriend is the worst romance manga I've had the displeasure of reading
anyway, to talk about actually good series, reading Kaguya-sama is ruining every other romcom out there for me because they will never measure up
people having different opinions? impossible
easy to tell which one is better
one is a harem, the other isn't
no
speaking of, Millhi, how are you enjoying AdaShima volume 7 <:MikuLove:585596189802627072>
not like I need an excuse to reread that
also I gotta check out official AdaShima translation
all this talk about LNs reminds me I need to read the new Bookworm volume
<:Fish:707710912534151300>
the announcement is calling it s3 so
<:TsubasaFish:689635621324718082>
but yes
s3*
people talking about AdaShima <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
it's a nice read, but tls are slow <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
the Kotori spinoff manga goes into detail about her backstory with the two producers that was hinted for like all of two minutes in episode 21
Chihaya is just Tsubasa in disguise
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
no we talking Idolmaster
her spinoff manga is great too
btw Kotori is actually best girl
I didn't think it was bad, just not interesting enough to watch more than the 4-5 episodes I did
I really like the first Imas anime, didn't really get into Cinderella Girls
Iori and Chihaya best
btw AMQ ping me after you're done with episode 20 and I'll link you a good video <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
she's technically the main girl, that's why her development comes last <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the bigger the meme the better
Hachiman didn't get his date with Totsuka... <:GWmythiFeelsBadMan:391321619748093972>
been trying to slow down my watch until the new movie comes out
I still have 3 episodes of KinMoza s2 + Pretty Days to watch
that one's very good too <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcx_ulopz84> <@!453836798796234762> go enjoy this <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
definitely my favorite episode
very nice
outside of stuff that was airing on TV (but back then I didn't know what anime was), my first anime was K-On. All downhill from there <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
still gonna watch though
I have no idea how one adapts AdaShima to anime
Planetarian a bit too different from the rest to judge it on the same scale
Little Busters >= Angel Beats > Rewrite > Clannad > Summer Pockets > Tomoyo After > Air > Kanon
for me, Key VNs are like
that's why I'm asking <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
how serious is that statement :15min
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but we don't speak of that
before Kanon was ONE
also technically Air was their 3rd
Kanon 2006 yes
Kanon kind of made the romance VN genre what it was for the next 10-15 years or so
it's a 1999 VN
yes
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
6/10
I'll sleep on Kanon
but what's available is absolutely great
part 2 might never come out <:GWmythicalFeelsSadMan:374568771421208577>
not more than part 1
it is tl'd
it's technically only "part 1"
there is one
11/10
read the Angel Beats VN
I accidentally used my pre-XV argument by habit <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
true
whereas HibiMiku have more moments on screen, since romance is slightly more out of place in Nanoha, there it's shown by stuff like living together and raising their child <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
that is, it's 100% a thing but not acknowledged directly by the show
NanoFate is basically as canon as HibiMiku
you better believe I listened to them all <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
in the sense that just like Sympho has all the Keywords you can look up, Nanoha has something like 25 drama CDs
Nanoha is made for me just like Symphogear...
I remember saying this exact thing <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Touma's real ability isn't Imagine Breaker or whatever, it's making the plot and all the characters worse whenever he's present
I did miss half of ep14 I guess
he wasn't *that* present
also skipped every Touma scene <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
watched all of the first arc in one sitting
I finally sat down to watch Railgun T
the mangaka girls one
oh is it... Comic Girls?
what is it?
I should know this show but I don't
with the amount of Misakas out there
those are not mutually exclusive
this is why Misaka x Shokuhou is the best ship btw
Shokuhou is a really good character but the show has to remind me she's also in love with this bland idiot
twintails isn't a hairstyle, it's a way of life
seeing them in a fresh look is always a plus but I usually still prefer the twintails look overall <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
twintails are objectively the best so everything made sense to me from the start
she's best girl
it's a really good novel
and ranked 2nd the year after
Ryuuou had a 2-year streak of being first in rankings
they just have the same voice
Madoka is like opposite Hibiki
nothing wrong with appreciating cute girls though <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I uhhh think it's absolute trash that doesn't belong in this world
Ruka?
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
most people who shit on Silent Party are Index fans anyway, can't trust their taste
nah I was just teasing you don't take me seriously <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
nah only bad ones
<@!171395487247630336> I'd say ViviD Strike is *really* good, unlike Vivid
holy shit it's been like 7 years
they got Sugita to voice this
oh no
oh
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
it's already happened
bless her
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
that's depressing
<:GWmythicalFeelsSadMan:374568771421208577>
oof
feels so strange to be caught up <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
speaking of, though, volume 8 tl was finished
volume 9 isn't out I think
I heard non is gonna focus on other genres now so no more Adachi
ah yeah
<@!152896851660505088>
new cover for vol9 is by anime artist
I don't care for any Love Live but I just like Rina
<@!152896851660505088> AdaShima first episode was better than expected, they're including a lot of monologues <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<@!476058996315389953> just buy the novels then, they're officially licensed <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
speaking of anime movies, I stopped being lazy and watched Saekano movie, 10/10
I recommend the LN to everyone
read LN
yeah
oh
second one is trying to catch up
first one was axed a long time ago
do it
hope people enjoy the anime just as much <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I'm too sleepy to properly form arguments but I'll just say that AdaShima is my favorite LN
as you should <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
<@!483807933642047488> lol just checking over here before sleep and I see you shill AdaShima here too <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
it's my all-time favorite LN so I won't stop trying to get people to read it <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
"goes nowhere unless you continue the story" is not a criticism
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:AgematsuBlurry:690965100475056209>
lmao what manga is that
it tried to do a bit too much, so it didn't resolve everything as best it could, but it's got plenty of good stuff
I like StrikerS a lot
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I'll need to shill the novels really hard once the season is over <:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714>
<:MikuLove:585596189802627072>
<:EveBless:585567202359640074>
<a:ipaid4nitrotousethisgifforkumiko:736781410416853063>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
if you don't recognize Tomopyon from a single sentence are you even a real fan <:ChrisStare:605517107077316631>
boomerangs are the best taste in presents <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Adashima is my favorite LN, so when I see people going like "okay but when do they get together" I have to jump in <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
> Don't get me wrong, it's still great, I'm just a horny gremlin and wanna see the gay
I know you're just saying it as a joke so don't worry <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
It just bothers me cause I hear that kind of thing a lot <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
it's just developing naturally
"baiting"
it was a really good read
I recommend reading the LN volume <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
the urge to say something as a source reader is so strong <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
love it
||Tarumi's|| anime design is gorgeous
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
no easy way out
no the true experience is all 8 episodes one after the other only
I'm glad for Kei too but I'd have been more surprised if she *wasn't* #1 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Kuroha and Mimimi making it into top 10 girls is the real victory on that list <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
https://twitter.com/RanobeSugoi/status/1329817718606888962
https://twitter.com/RanobeSugoi/status/1329793343421706242
oooh KonoRano rankings out
Hmm, it's more that she subconsciously keeps it out of her mind because she doesn't want to ruin their relationship. After all, I don't think she'd return Adachi's feelings if she was confessed to.
I think it's been hinted quite a few times that Shimamura understands more than she lets on
give Shima some slack, it's her friend who is a disaster lesbian
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
I don't know, since you won't read/watch Adashima <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
life is a mistake
<:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
oh no why is that manga actually spreading
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I already dislike Index enough to argue with him <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
don't bully my fellow countryman too much, Protato
I act as if I have
hot-blooded shogi action though
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
which doesn't include me
Ryuuou LN has been praised by everyone who bothered to read it
there's one good series there
yeah I was about to say
I was 200% sure she'd be #1 again
Kei is the next Misaka
<@!87512939107450880>
https://twitter.com/RanobeSugoi/status/1329793343421706242
if you haven't seen them I can find the link again
I posted this year's results a few days ago <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
these are last year's results
it was like the 9 years gap never happened <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I read the new Haruhi novel
I think the artstyle just kinda has the permanent blush <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
hmm it's not quite like that
also Tarumi's design is really really good
it's been a delight to see certain scenes adapted though
though part of me says it's still not good enough <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's better than I expected
I watched only the two latest episodes but I've been keeping up
have you been watching the Adashima anime
hey Millhi <:MisakiPeek:671147522395209744>
Flip Flappers
imagine not downloading everything <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the official license is slowly catching up
the (fan) translation is up to date and it's of great quality
they're so good
I'm recommending everyone I know to pick up the novels, at least after the anime is done <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:DMJiiHug:579676447854034947>
open to interpretation, so your takes are just as valid <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I'm going to stop before I say more though cause this is my favorite series and I'd just ramble on and on otherwise <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
and half "she's a lonely girl with no friends who doesn't get along with her mom, I probably shouldn't push her away"
The way Shimamura sees Adachi is half "I admire her because she keeps trying to change her situation" (while Shima just goes along with her boring life)
I don't remember which episode it was, but Shimamura's reaction to that was basically a "thank goodness this won't be something awkward"
Does it look to you like Shimamura thinks of Adachi in that way?
<:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
so many good Nanjol songs
Hesitation Snow
every Railgun OP
but like
I had no idea how seriously I should take that sentence, as I'm pretty sure is the intended response <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's not that bad though
I think it was just in the sense that the music sounds pretty upbeat for what is mostly an introspective character-focused work
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I hope the 5th volume of Adashima comes out soon because it has my most awaited scene <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
that's fair. My ship sailed when I gave in and bought 4 JP volumes to support the author one week before licensing was announced <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
read Adashima <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
which is why I recommend just going ahead with the fan tls <:MakiLUL:549719118266368010>
that's where the anime will end
yes
of course in exchange we get good voice acting and animation so I'm not complaining too much <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I think the biggest appeal of Adashima is in the character's internal thoughts so the anime loses out on that a bunch
they're an amazing read
I read light novels so this doesn't concern me <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
all I need from the Adashima anime is for it to make people pick up the LNs
of course it was, you know me too well
somebody asked the other day
<a:CS1Shake:563437816533614610>
basically just gotta find the right places
gotcha
since for currently airing anime I obviously can't check stuff like BD sales
I mean I probably do know enough JP, I just have no idea where to look
do you know an easy way to check how popular the currently airing anime are in Japan?
oh I had an actual question for you
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Millhi what happened with your name lmao
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'll stand by being the only person on this planet saying the anime is better than the movie
this one isn't a comparison
Nanoha A's >>>>> 2nd Nanoha movie
<:MikuLove:585596189802627072>
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
how popular are streaming services in Japan compared to just watching anime on TV
right <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Adashima wasn't published under a label famous for yuri after all <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's basically because he was a well-known author that a yuri SoL novel got popular enough in the same magazine that runs stuff like SAO and Index
from what I've seen, the people who like his works *really* like them
of the light novel
the writer
feel like there might be proportionally more yuri fans overseas, but then again we don't get that hardcore Iruma fanbase <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I honestly have no idea how well this would do overseas vs Japan
this is around what I expected, really
was hoping for better but yeah
it's... not that bad?
<@!152896851660505088> <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
https://twitter.com/RanobeSugoi/status/1336332427761840132
thanks for the info as always, I rely on you for this kind of stuff every time <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
d-does anyone think AL is good
how are you on this server and use Tanya instead of Hibiki as an example for Yuuki Aoi's voice <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I don't want more Adashima so people will read the novels <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
this season is gonna end really strong and it just keeps going afterwards
second Nana season would be so good
<a:APetForChris:752996305697243257>
🤝
||comrade||
||I just hope if he eventually comes back to the good guys they don't try to ship him with Nana <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>||
||yeah I see basically everyone predicting Kyouya's sister is either Nana or "Jin".||
Nana manga spoilers <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
||yeah I loved Nana's character since the beginning and she's only gotten better. She carries the series. I like how she's trying to change herself while still in the middle of all the morally grey stuff. A moment I found powerful was when she shot Koharu herself so that her kouhai wouldn't have to.||
not one of my faves but yeah it's an impactful scene
I can see that
Love Live Nijigasaki, Sigrdrifa, and now D4DJ. I basically caught up on my cute girls do music things, and also a cute girls do war things
but yeah the stuff afterwards is still really good compared to most of this season
I think the absolute peak of the series is exactly where this season ends
but mid
not good or bad
I thought this season was mid until I binged 3 anime in the last 4 days
I'll never forgive humanity for giving kanokari a s2
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
but the novels are so much better <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
||Nah, I don't think Tsuruoka could possibly be her brother.||
As a trivia, in today's episode ||Tsuruoka was voiced by the late seiyuu Fujiwara Keiji. Which means they must have recorded (and as such, planned the entire anime) *way* in advance. Likely even pushed back airing a season due to covid. This makes me feel safer about the final episode because they definitely had the time to properly structure everything.||
||This is just my intuition, but this doesn't feel like the kind of adaptation to put foreshadowing for the source material in its OP, really <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ||
manga stuff ||I think the bodies around Kyouya are just the show's imagery in general, and not anything specific. What I meant is that in the opening you can see the pen Nana gifts Michiru, and then it shows literally all the events of the show in order, up to Michiru fainting in the bath, then someone with a bloody knife, and Michiru's horrified face... that is, the events of next episode <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ||
it's not impossible but given that it's the season finale I kinda expect them to take it slow with the climactic moments?
but that's still about 110 pages to cover in one episode (this one was about 80, for reference)
manga spoilers ||they're covering up to Revival, not the full end of Invisible Blade||
no, by next ep's title they're definitely ending the volume
ep12 covered a bit less than I thought it would, slightly worried if they can fit everything in the finale
Nana manga spoilers ||Yeah, I think he'll be the "main" villain, so he definitely has his own plans.||
<@!297542051057238017> I'm watching the new Nana ep and now that I'm a source reader.... holy shit the OP
someone else catching up on the manga
<:DMJiiPeek:781967661088899094>
I've technically seen half of Fruit Tart already from screenshots on my twitter feed alone
that just means you need to read the LN <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Fruit Tart I'm going to start either today or tomorrow <:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
I thought this season wasn't that good but I wasn't expecting this LL season to get me invested, and I didn't hear that many good things about Sigrdrifa but I ended up loving the show
then I marathoned 31 episodes on anime in 3 days <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I was literally watching only 2 shows just last week
I've got Adashima on Thursday, D4DJ on Friday, Sigrdrifa and Nijigasaki on Saturday, and Nana on Sunday <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
isn't that how anime works in general <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
if it was already out for a while and I just didn't know then sorry <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I don't know how long the delay from it coming on CR and it being uploaded on nyaa is
oh yeah
<@!297542051057238017> <@!213645184125239317> new Nana manga chapter out if you know where to look <:DMJiiPeek:781967661088899094>

on a completely different note, today the last volume of the Sayaka LN came out and it was damn great
<:KasumiXD:586236709017223178>
probably gonna pass on it, I've got other stuff to prioritize
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I can guess immediately
...I see
watch D4DJ
is this the season of anime abs
SW is one of those series I'll marathon one day
I watched ep1 but not sure whether I should continue <:ArisaLazy:567673742285733905>
how good is Fruit Tart, if you've watched far enough to judge it
that's a lot <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the girls are just so fun to watch
<:EveBless:585567202359640074>
aside from that I watched Adashima, Nana and D4DJ
watching anything else? Sigrdrifa was my biggest surprise, ended up really enjoying it <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:TopDad:664848944517480489>
I see a pattern here
it's not like I'm a LL fan in the first place
well aside from that <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Millhi what you watching this season
<:TopDad:664848944517480489>
I guess it's just a difference in taste, after all I dropped Sunshine at episode 2 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:RinaHappy:661623410786566185>
<:RinaYay:660932004723949583>
same since bias
but the first 3 episodes and 10-12 have such strong directing
the middle episodes are a bit shakier because of the "girl-of-the-week" thing
Nijigasaki has been great
the first one is the best to start with if you want to understand what it's about, it's a good character-driven comedy + music performances
the third one (the one airing right now) is standalone and imo far above all the others in terms of character writing
for a serious LL answer
K-On!! is the best anime ever so that's a good recommendation
the one in this show is, at least <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
CG is good, everybody
https://i.imgur.com/GvzeqQG.mp4
lmao
yes
<:YuuPomu:790390711366451260>
I do hope we get the LNs translated, it's only 2 pairs of 2 volumes
but yeah I really like it but it does reek of "shit we rushed things a ton"
I saw someone saying the prequel LNs written by Tappei are much better <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
anyway, I just finished the last ep of Sigururi
same
just play the VN 5head
Anyway, just let me put it like this: standalone, I'd rate the anime maybe a 7-7.5
The novels are my favorite series ever <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> that's how much I recommend them
Unfortunately the anime doesn't get to that part <:ArisaLazy:567673742285733905>
I mean, you are not wrong at all. And these issues get addressed as the series goes on.
read the Adashima LNs, they're great <:EveBless:585567202359640074>
the story is still incomplete after all
that was the silliest thing
it gets better
go back
it was the weirdest experience lmao
for some reason on this last ep they played all the plane sound effects during the OP
<:RinaSad:661622342987808807>
but it entirely feels like this and ep11 was content meant to be stretched over 3 episodes instead
I think the emotional beats of this last ep hit really well
yeah I'm just wondering how late in the production they fucked up
and that's why they slid in a recap episode in the middle
but things went wrong
I really do think they wanted to do 13 episodes
yeah <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the "we had one more episode planned but we scrapped it late enough in production that we even changed the airing schedule mid-season" feeling is strong with this one
starts stronger than it ends but overall a solid show
Revue Starlight a good <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
ch28, right at the end of volume 4
time to catch up with the manga and join the cool kids
Niji would have been a much better show if we cut like 3-4 of the less important girls and focused more on Ayumu/Yuu
blessed
<@!152896851660505088> the BD bonus story for Adashima just got tl'd and <:ShirabeHeart:738932033635483738><:KirikaHeart:738932018116821034>
just letting you know in advance, it's got another "what was Iruma smoking lmao" part in it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KokoHappy:589621245847535616><:KanonLucky:589621246472355851><:KaoSmile:589621245868376064><:MisaYay:589621246581276728><:HaguYay:589621246053056512>
one of them is an idol band
HHW is best
and nice to see someone enjoying s2
<:KokroWaaaa:567673227137122306>
Bandori isn't idols, it's bands
<:KokroYes:504405873804705822>
exactly why I'm asking <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Millhi should I watch horse girls s1
also shows where the OP/ED have changes throughout the season <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
since Madoka talk is happening I'm gonna take the chance to shill YuYuYu because I just got back into the series reading the latest bonus LN + the VN from the anime bluray and remembered how much I love the series <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
with idol talk? <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
there are two units of side characters which are *literally* Sphere and TrySail <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I went to check the seiyuu for Idoly Pride and while the main unit is all unknown people
also at least the OP had a bunch of 2D animations for the singing so I have hopes
I get the slight feeling the rest of the show will be different from ep1 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> but as long as they keep the quality of the direction up it should be good
I liked it lmao
yeah
turns out there was a good idol show this season too <:KasumiYay:504405876728266772>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
are we all shilling Wonder Egg here? cause we should all be shilling Wonder Egg here
Urasekai isn't really for me but I know many people who love it <:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
thankfully we have Wonder Egg to be the better heterochromatic yuri show of the season?
but well, to each his own
> I'm not going to sit through a torrent of trash just because source readers say it gets better later, every time I've tried that it hasn't.
I agree with this I just don't think it's trash now
I feel like this is just your assumption though. Nothing has even happened yet in regards to them settling the argument.
<:WeWillConquerTheWest:605780247862050826>
and taking statements from either of the characters as if they're some sort of universal truths the series is trying to affirm
I feel like people are judging the series a bit too fast <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KasumiYay:504405876728266772>
won't say anything since I'm a source reader but I really, really like the series
Tomozaki good <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
so basically, spending extra money
cutting into ads time
not only cutting OP/ED for content, but literally just extra long episodes whenever they need
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:OttoComfy:799052404900626484>
I'd be worried if they hadn't gotten better animation
well the movies are from like 10 years later <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:HibikiCry:601426670372782081>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
if yes, why is it the best show this season
<@!152896851660505088> have you watched the egg show and if not why
the weirdest thing about choosing Echidna for Re0 is that Roswaal is right there
wdym Index is perfect for its genre of "bland protagonist gets a harem for no reason"
I'm already watching another idol show this season though <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I honestly dropped the show ep2 because I didn't like the execution (there was that one scene of the girl getting really angry and it felt too melodramatic), but I wonder if the show is gonna be interesting enough to pick back up
<:pain:759159608370921503>
<:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
so it has both Ayahi and Minako
one of the side-character units is literally Sphere
not in the main unit but yes <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:pain:759159608370921503>
already done ofc <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
the other idol show blessed me with Ayahi singing instead <:ChriSmile:613005626787758090>
you can't reel me in like that and just take it away from me immediately <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
on the other: <:pain:759159608370921503>
on one hand: wow nice they went there <:DMJiiHug:579676447854034947>
I saw one screenshot of *that* and caught up with the anime lmao
I'm so easy to manipulate
<:pain:759159608370921503>
<@!152896851660505088> did you watch ep4 of Gekidol <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ayahi's character had like half a line in the episode she appeared
for all we know her character just won't speak outside of songs <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:EveBless:585567202359640074>
really excited for whatever song the TrySail group is gonna play <:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
not that I expect anything less from Sphere but
it's a really good song <:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
it came out on the day the episode did <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
so you get a bit of <:WeWillConquerTheWest:605780247862050826> in the mix

the album version has the full group singing too
also so much more canon gay than I expected, even with Tougou in mind <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and it's so good
I very recently binged all the story content of the Yuyuyu mobile game
so excited for this
<:HyperYuunaBox:795798590165483541>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GKGbOxdxk
TrySail ED in this ep of Idoly Pride <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I still need to watch Egg
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
like, "Celia"
btw am I wrong in thinking "Seria" is supposed to actually be an anagram of Alice but fucked up by Japanese <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I didn't sign up for a yuri psychological thriller post-apocalyptic sci-fi idol theater show
literally can't tell
or is the show too dumb for us???

WHAT IS THIS SHOW AAAAAAAAAA
but I'm committed at this point
this is so hard to watch
<@!152896851660505088> started gekidol ep5... what the hell is this shot composition <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
re0 ep spoilers
>me when someone says Emilia, Rem, Echidna, or whoever else is best girl in re0
exactly
anyway yeah read the 2 LN volumes they're really great
why are you posting a machine translation of the WN lmao
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
eww
and I keep anime or specific episodes I really like in a separate folder
I delete episodes when the next ones come out <:MakiLUL:757002008027725884>
basically it was "we've wanted to work on this for a long time" and not "we would like to work on this for a long time (from now)"
that tweet was wrong
I can't think of a good occasion to play it next ep
it's probably gonna play in ep 7
the song will probably play in a hype moment but I'm fairly sure no visuals will be there
and yeah I'm 99% sure this cour isn't gonna have an actual OP
by next ep we will have had 6 episodes with over the runtime of 8 for a normal anime <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
no OP/ED in any of them (except playing the ED over visuals but that doesn't take air time
ReZero eps for cour 2 have been 27m30s, then 28m, and all the last three have been 29m30s
I wish the Sigururi LN could be translated, I basically saw people saying the prequel LNs are just as good writing as ReZero by Tappei and the anime ended up being very rushed <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
anyway, this season has Egg which makes up for everything at least
I don't really want to think about that show more than necessary
I think it was the inspiration for a specific genre of isekai? haven't done much research though
turns out the work that spawned a hundred bad other isekais is a bad isekai <:KaguyaSmug:742004030846402580>
no one can convince me MT isn't trash
^
I'll be fucking creeped out and not want anything to do with this
that if your first reaction to meeting a 7 year old or whatever is "I want her to be my wife"
it can't be so hard to understand
this
nice argument
lmao
read up to vol15 then just kept up through memes and laughed at the salt on the ending
they already are the same thing: terrible
it still makes him a creepy asshole I don't want to watch as the protagonist of a show
time to post this again
no but yes
I can't stop now I must know
I'm so damn easy to fool
it's because I saw ||the kiss|| lmaooo
5 is the most wuuuut of them all
just the drama in s1 *really* drags it down. Kotomi's arc especially
Clannad comedy is pretty great
this is a very good take
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
||feels like thrown off the roof is right||
they could reveal everyone is secretly robots and at this point I wouldn't be surprised
<:pain:759159608370921503>
on the other hand, new Egg episode might be my favorite yet
yeah like this felt like a "here are the answers" episode except we still don't really understand anything <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
being confused 100% of the time has its own sort of charm <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I don't think it's good, but it won't let me stop watching
alright, updated opinion on the show: I still do not, in fact, know what is going on at all
no other show makes me want to shout "WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON" so much while I'm watching
<@!152896851660505088> it's that time of the week <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> gonna watch Gekidol ep6
"I summon the opening visuals to win this fight"
I stand by the fact that Gekidol really isn't a very good show but I'm too far in to stop now and there's enough to amuse me
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
||yeah||
everything forgiven thanks to next ep preview
plz
why can the episode be so normal then so ridiculous
w h a t is this
what is this
also wth there's a new OP song (but same visuals)
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<@!152896851660505088> Gekidol time! I can't believe how much I've started looking forward to this <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:AiEgg:800815047651098624>
I watch raws so it didn't affect me but Funi plz
wth apparently on the official platforms Gekidol has had the same ED the whole time?
this ep I think had more "normal" good moments so it wasn't quite as entertaining but ep preview tells me fun times are ahead
kek
oh I think it's *entirely* rolling with what it wants to do, so much that it left me no time to be able to tell what that actually is
they're just good in unconventional ways <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
score them higher then <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
definitely recommend people to read the LN
2 volumes are currently out in English with a 3rd awaiting tl and a 4th to be released soon-ish
it's a great LN
<:ShirabeHeart:738932033635483738><:KirikaHeart:738932018116821034>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
that's called NanoFate relationship
I know this to be 100% true from my actual experience, I just don't want to give excuses to the people who'd say HibiMiku are just friends <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
my recent life is living for all the Yuyuyu ships in the gacha game
> has strong support from its parent text 
by which you mean "it's literally canon"
and not "here's anime excuse to get two characters close to each other suddenly"
tbh I need more yuri like Adashima that is actual relationship building
I've also read the LN for this one
me during the whole ep: "I still don't get this and it doesn't really feel satisfying"
did you ever watch the latest ep
<:MakiOmegaLUL:795454608813588547>
this conversation was buried under 5 layers of in-jokes, don't think about it too hard
do you enjoy torturing me like this <:KaguyaPensive:795454454077063168>
you're either watching yuyuyu or nothing, you fool
the best way I can describe the anime is that it feels like each scene every episode was written by a different writer and none of them actually know what the plot is
literally unpredictable
but I can dream!
me neither <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's still something so incredibly rare in anime for it to not be left ambiguous
all I really want from this show at this point is for the gay couple to end up together because it would be so refreshing
<:kekw:716193705316581486>
that's all I can say
anyway, the gay stuff is good
I can't tell what is happening in this show at any time
is it? I can't tell
not very high, mostly because they basically aren't idols
but we're watching it <:ChisatoStare:506072710510673931>
here romance is just something that's part of the characters' lives, and in one case they happen to be gay which is great
because there they will dance around the words "love", "dating" and so on by any means possible
though honestly, the romance in this show is better than the shipping in stuff like LL imo <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:ChisatoStare:506072710510673931>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
me seeing ||the kiss on the cheek|| in the next ep preview: "HELL YEAH"
<:KasumiYay:504405876728266772>
<:HyperYuunaBox:795798590165483541>
I watch raws so I can pretend it's like I watched it on JP television and then it's not piracy!
it's far and away the best show of the season
if you're not watching wep you're doing an incredible disservice to yourself <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yes
||not really? like, the kiss wasn't a big deal but the preview didn't make it out to be anything that grand either||
not enough bait for me in the preview this time
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
especially the end <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
this ep was wild as always
last ep already had it
<@!152896851660505088> you know, I wonder if they planned on making an actual 2nd OP for Gekidol, because the visuals don't work at all on this new song <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
sigururi good
why is Azuzu so good
<a:hinalaptop:550757299300466708>
I'm gonna post some official Azuzu art in the art channel to make up for it
same <:KaguyaPensive:795454454077063168>
what ep you on?
Sigrdrifa a good!
actually wait today I downloaded the subbed version
today the ED was a flashback montage so
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I know
anyway, unless we're getting ultra-baited, next ep should have plot??? given how this one ended
on the other hand, I have slightly more hope for proper yuri ending <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the season is gonna end and they're not gonna tell us it's aliens
go watch anime you fool
that was literally my first comment about the ep too lmao
WEP is the Gekidol palette cleanser
playing the epilogue VN fixed every problem I had with the 2nd season ending <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
btw Millhi
the chibi series in April, and 3rd season eventually
it's coming!
the anime you should have at the top of your list is yuyuyu, anyway <:ChisatoStare:506072710510673931>
<a:FujiKekW:765048643399974912>
it's just the proof of how damn slow Yen Press is <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
Polish ones got 22 recently I think?
the official English release of re0 LNs is at volume 14
yeah <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Polish... the blessed language that has ReZero LN translations 8 volumes ahead of the English ones <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
ah well, not officially
it is
yup
the anime is kinda skipping everything that isn't the main plot, the manga is a lot more light-hearted and slice of life-ish
actually you reminded me, I wanted to buy the newest Re0 volume today but shipping is gonna take a month <:AyaDed:674382490755924009>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I know
look
support the author and all that, but here's the quick link
<https://nyaa.si/view/1330657>
<:ARRYAYA:717853643629658132>
if you need a link to the LN just ask
<:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
2 volumes released
definitely recommend to read
the best part about the book is that it's not shy to talk about many social and lgbt issues
the two volumes released in English already make for a great complete story (they cover the original web novel), and now there is going to be more and it's great
it's a really good novel
hopefully that won't affect the anime too much story-wise
big rip though
do you have a link to this
<:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
<:TopDad:664848944517480489>
damn I trust your opinion so much I second guessed myself there
*she(?)
Liz is the culmination of that
Hibike is a wonderful character work in general
it just brings bad discussion to the table
I'll say this: don't watch Hibike just for the gay or whatever
very
just will take some time probably
it was already announced
they are going to
I know but honestly I just felt like I wasn't gonna like it and I don't want to ruin my impression of Hibike as a 10/10 anime
no <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I know they cut out all the screentime of a character I really like so I'm not watching it either <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
just read the novels <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the other one?
I'm the type to prefer longer narratives too
I had a friend from America buy me a copy and send it over to me
I know right? sometimes the Liz soundtrack just plays as my life's bgm, that's how much it's stuck in my mind <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
the movie is probably my third favorite anime movie right behind Disappearance and Liz
s2 is almost entirely KyoAni original content which is why it's so good
s1 only like a 6.5/10 or so to me, mostly because it's about 60% material from the manga which is just meh
I will die on this hill
and s2 is the best anime ever made
K-On movie is a 10/10
it's so good
there's something about that uniform
they're so pretty aaaaaa

the volume 4 cover is absurdly good
I've definitely rewatched it one too many times <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:EveBless:585567202359640074>
volume 2 is even much better
I'm sure you'll love volume 2 as well
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:TopDad:664848944517480489>
imagine needing subs to watch Precure
except unlike Akira and the other one, the two characters from this ep had literally zero presence until now
this was the "let's develop the rest of the side cast and set up for the final arc" ep
I feel like this show keeps being a big meme
did she exist until now
who is this character
there's one specific cut this ep of Gekidol which really supports my idea of "the writers put random scenes together with no coherence" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it is time
the LN is better translated and has a bonus chapter compared to the WN
maybe we are the real gekidol
<:ChisatoStare:506072710510673931>
this is an unintentionally hilarious sentence
this is one of the weirder time loops she went through
that's actually just Homura
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I swear that girl who looks kinda like everyone else just randomly appeared in the group one ep because I didn't remember her
<:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
that said, the animation from this pv seems real good
the animation seems different so probably not
<:RinkoPat:504405878913499158>
I recognize scenes from vol3-4 so I can tell you that's not the case <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
judging only from screenshots, yes
math!
something like this?
also because in this screenshot the plane is inclined (and in the middle of rotating) it looks a bit off, but basically the figure inside is like a trapezoid
yeah that was the point <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
look, it's got the length of the segments marked on it
but it wasn't a square
I've seen people argue about it for hours
it's not a square
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
btw Millhi, what in the actual fuck is this week's Gekidol
which is fine by me
I think this will be more like a sidestory thing, or "scenes we didn't get to show in the game"
literally no way for it to work
adaptation would have been terrible
we're finally getting the best chapter title in today's Re0
<:pain:759159608370921503>
*that ending*
that ending though
more like tripled down
won't say anything
I
...
for the mess this has been
it's just so fitting
so I watched the final episodes
I randomly found the download on nyaa
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I've watched them, so yes
what did I just watch
what was that
fgjkdfksdfj
I wonder if this is a leak of some sort? But I don't think leaks work like this with Blurays <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
don't ask me, I have no idea how this happened lmao
so I guess I'm watching the last two episodes now <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<@!152896851660505088> Gekidol has finally successfully confused its own production team enough that all the episodes are now out on Bluray even though the anime isn't done airing yet <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
but as long as I'm just reading for free what someone else is doing for me, I won't complain too much unless it's unreadable <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I do translate myself, and I have really high standards for what to call a "good" translation
plz no <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but well, I'm fairly easy to please as long as it's not actively the wrong meaning
I love the ReZero novels but the prose in those is... pretty damn bad. Part of it is Tappei's fault too
while that is a pretty poorly phrased sentence, I also know official stuff that's worse <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
only error I could spot is a case of mixing up character names
the translation is also pretty good, you wouldn't be able to tell it's fan translated
<https://nellietranslation.wordpress.com/2021/02/23/the-story-of-unforgettable-witch-prologue/>
want a link to the prologue/ch1 that are translated?
aside from the obvious answer you've been so kindly shown, ||it's about a girl who lives every day repeatedly, like 3-6 times. Once a day is done repeating, only one of the iterations is randomly set as what "really" happens for the rest of the world.||
<:YashiConsumeNutrient:797361052450029578>
let me steal them sometime <:MakiOmegaLUL:795454608813588547>
I need those healin' good emotes btw
<:DMJiiHug:579676447854034947>
Adashima is my favorite LN and I don't get to talk to enough people about it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
are you caught up with it? <:KokoroPeek:504405876816347136>
ofc then you'll have to put up with waiting but <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
you can go read the prologue + ch1 right now, they're translated <:KokroYes:504405873804705822>
the volume is also a chunky boi, it's about 1.5 times the length of an Adashima one
no, there's a volume 2 coming out this April <:KokroYes:504405873804705822>
I don't think I can really read a LN in Japanese yet but it should be fine trying to look at the text until next chapter is tl'd <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's yuri and it's pretty good from the prologue+ch1 that have been translated so far
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
meanwhile, this LN I bought arrived today <:KasumiYay:504405876728266772>
can't wait <:kekw:716193705316581486>
Gek|dol
Gekidol/Gekidol
that's how much I was left ?????? by the ending
if a week after the last episode an episode 13 airs I wouldn't even be surprised at this point
<:kekw:716193705316581486>
<:OttoComfy:799052404900626484>
seems like I got lucky
lmao
I was about to say Symphogear then I realized what server I was on
basically, the 3 movies were re-aired as a 6-episode anime
ofc Nanoha also <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
but the anime is great
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm probably a bigger fan of this series than should be allowed because I consumed like the entire 5 years' worth of the gacha game's content
<:HyperYuunaBox:795798590165483541>
if you like magical girls, Yuuki Yuuna exists
the first 6 minutes felt like characters reading their list of character tropes to one another
but yes that
I do know other people who liked it
I, uh, dropped it 6 minutes in
?
assault lily
oh
haven't watched
<:MahiruHugKaren:588426470003703834>
well Mahiru can't be beaten actually
yeah we're saying flipflap is gayer <:ChisatoStare:506072710510673931>
it's pretty great
Flip Flappers is a canon gay show
also has got nothing in common with Starlight but K-On s2 is my favorite anime of all time so <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I don't really think KLK has much in common with Starlight except "people fight" lol
it's further on the magical girl and abstract scale but it's a great show
Flip Flappers?
well it's fine if you weren't into it, everybody's got their own taste <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
but I personally really love the way the thematic threads run through the entire series,
s1 starts off slow, and s2 has its own set of problems due to those production issues
Yuyuyu is definitely something that's more than the sum of its parts
though funny you say that, since Tougou has the same seiyuu as Hikari instead <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
not the same seiyuu though
I'm guessing you mean Yuuna?
it's a fansub group name <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
they use FFF
should be good
you don't understand how much the lack of long vowels is upsetting me <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Assault Lily is just a coward though
and that's *before* getting into the gacha game stuff
never watched release the spyce, though I know it's the same author
as in, literally getting the plot of the show wrong
cause you should be warned, the official subs for s2 are terrible beyond belief
does that use official subs?
also this depends if you're the type to read LNs or not, but there is also an unadapted prequel novel which is really great
yes
it's literally just s1 -> s2
that's why there are way more entries than there should really be
this week's ep of Uma Musume seemed to be real good
<:KasumiPray:675007115865096192>
kek
gonna watch the new ep now
really hope the show ends well
I see <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I can guess what you mean, but elaborate <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I mean, when the makers of the anime don't know what's going on, how can you expect the translator to
<a:FujiKekW:765048643399974912>
<a:aTsuguMoney:586236767418581011>
also I assume they didn't need to buy the license twice to put the same song in both games <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Synchrogazer is probably the most famous Sympho song
https://twitter.com/bang_dream_gbp/status/1371295878770696194?s=20

<@!213645184125239317> you're the only one I remember off the top of my head <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that's just denial
Madoka is just 12 episodes + movie
Nanoha is 2 13 episode season + a 26 episode sequel
I just can't wrap my head around what the author of the story wanted to do
<:MakiOmegaLUL:795454608813588547>
so how about that ending, take two
h-have fun
a mess
when the last two episodes air two weeks early cause bluray that happens
<:pain:759159608370921503>
such a good time
I've started watching Yama no Susume and it's better than anything I'm watching this season
5 hours to be precise
imagine trusting the anime community <:ChisatoStare:506072710510673931>
just be like me and start catching up on Yama no Susume now that the 4th season has been announced
yes
watch Uma Musume, that's proba--
...it took me more than I'd like to admit to realize this is you <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I don't know if the anime will be able to keep that quality <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the whole point of that manga is just to have this incredibly beautiful shots because the art is so good
I'm pretty sure that's enough
I've consumed all of Precure through fanart
took me 3 days
it's a surprisingly good disguise isn't it
the real big brain move is making Illya the only part of Fate you watch
unbased
<:TomosatoStare:688429724233629772>
smh not using her best role
Shinobu Mail kept getting put off forever <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
all in all, it's surprisingly completely average
I have a friend who's a big Fate fan and I thought it'd make for a good meme if this was the one thing from it I watch
I know you were <:TopDad:664848944517480489>
finished season 3 today
yes
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<@!152896851660505088> no points for guessing what it was <:TopDad:664848944517480489>
I finally consumed my first Fate media
are we talking Fate
the game never deserved it
the best thing about the anime is that it's making good use of the amazing ost
<:MakiLUL:757002008027725884>
long time no see
oh hi
oh sorry I didn't even consider that I might be spoiling someone on the game <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
honestly I was keeping my expectations low but seems like it'll be pretty enjoyable
the mere existence of actual villains gives me hope
this episode was better than the game in its entirety
my dream
a bread loving blonde twintailed anime girl
shadows house features literally me
everyone go watch super cub you can thank me later
I knew I could count on you to be watching the best show of the season
btw good pfp
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
> All done.
> Uh, holy shit?!? Iruma Hitoma you're a genius but what the fuck is *wrong* with you lmao
to quote a comment by someone else:
<:HyperYuunaBox:795798590165483541>
Iruma is just one of a kind
just got done reading
time to reeeeeead
<@!152896851660505088> wait scratch everything I literally just saw BD4 get translated now
BD 3 should be getting tl'd soon since sneik got the scans
I've been dodging spoilers
3 and 4 aren't tl'd <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
actually I just remembered there are already fanarts of Rin and the main girl from Super Cub crossing each other on the streets <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yes
it's very yuru camp-like
well, just try it out when you feel like, I'm not joking when I say I think it's the best show this season
I feel like that description is both correct and also giving you the wrong idea of what it's like <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
super cub is the best show this season after all <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
since most magical girl shows are either mainly aimed at kids (Precure, etc.) or seinen (Nanoha, Madoka, etc.)
which is why it probably feels very different from what people are used to
it's a rare shoujo magical girl show
the 3rd ep was better than the first 2 <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
so much
I love them
so blessed
the smol pigtails
<:EveBless:585567202359640074>
also ||gyaru miko|| is a galaxy brain move
can this cast get any more stacked <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and Ai Fairouz
<@!152896851660505088> pog Kitou Akari in Yuyuyu
I guess technically the episodes have like 30 seconds of extra content
there's essentially no difference in content, so it's fine
actually should I say the LN*s* at this point? the latest one is also really great
but most of all read the LN that is the best arc in the series <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:KokoroYay:690553009066868737>
after I'm done with YnS I can probably binge Tamayura too
well, I was just in a phase where I didn't watch much anime at all back then
I already downloaded everything the first time you recommended it to me, I don't know why I never started it
<:DMJiiHug:579676447854034947>
most people are meh
those 4 seasons are still sitting in my hard drive, I just never got around to it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
will probably do it soon
still need to start the pottery show
<:KokroZOOM:589621176540725252>
those puppets
oh
wait which one is that
the other shows I'm still watching this season are... a disappointment of an adaptation (Osamake), a show I watch just for Yuuki Aoi (Slime300), and magical girls that aren't very good but I'm curious to see what happens (Blue Reflection) <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
going into ptw then <:KokroYes:504405873804705822>
oh it's something yet to air
I have like 30 episodes on yns still to watch, I'm good for now <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
the art I mean
<:HinataSmile:479098853887311883>
the show's style reminds me of Yama no Susume for some reason
I'm glad we're blessed with this show in this mostly empty season
oh this series is nostalgic <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I don't think it'll be idols judging by their songs
damn I'm listening to irl Healer Girls' covers and they're great!
did somebody mention (2nd) best girl?
<:FeelsBadMan:391321619748093972>
if ice hockey counts then they're coming
I can't blame you there <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
s1 of ZSL kinda raised expectations in that sense
I'm also still watching Slime300 as basically comfort food, and Blue Reflection Ray which might not be good, but it's still interesting <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
show hasn't missed a beat
thankfully Super Cub is all I need this season
I fell behind on anime last 2 weeks when I decided to speedrun the Umineko VN over 10 days
haven't been watching but things don't sound good, huh
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:HibiMikuPeek:661660014288568361>
I actually feel like I know where everything is in relation to each other
also I was thinking while watching the latest ep that I like a lot how the show repeats the same backgrounds each time because it really does give the sense that by riding on the cub we're learning the lay of the land, so to speak
the dark/light versions of the intersection are so good
ooooooooh
honestly the first half of Gou I have mixed feelings about because while it's written really smart in the sense of giving first-timers and original fans two entirely different experiences, it also just kinda re-treads ground from the original arcs and it can be pretty boring
h-half and half?
I wasn't ever a big fan of Higurashi but turns out if you let me think of the story as a yuri I enjoy it a lot more!
since I figure a bunch of developments are hard to not hear about <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
how spoiled are you on the rest of the season
<:KokroYes:504405873804705822>
on the positive side, after binging Higurashi Gou and Umineko, now I'm excited for Higu Sotsu next season
wish that was me, really
though her character is probably the one who does so the least
I know what I said <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367> the anime's very silly so she gets to goof off a bunch
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
she's doing many voices, really
<:TsuguLove:674374977813741594><:HinaLove:674351163159871534>
it's all about HinaTsugu
also SayoTsugu sucks
<:kekw:716193705316581486>
<:KasumiPray:675007115865096192>
it deserves this
umamusu s2 was so damn good
is this what justice feels like
I wanted to ping you with this lmao
I've watched like 28 episodes of Saki in the last 24 hours and I've been having the time of my life
<a:HinaSlowlyRunsOutOfTheDoor:564188497309597709>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
also for some reason I had it in my head that the manga was over but I guess I'm in for the pain of waiting instead huh
I'll see where you come from once I catch up with the manga
<:RinkoPat:504405878913499158>
Yukarin also got another meme role <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah <:MakiOmegaLUL:795454608813588547>
<:HyperYuunaBox:795798590165483541>
>Naobou, Ao-chan, HanaKana speak
>Achiga starts
dude
<@!152896851660505088> I wrote up some impressions if you're curious <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
time for 2 OVAs then the manga
overall I'd rate the franchise 9/10 so far
Zenkoku-hen ||the quarterfinals remain my favorite part of the show. It was probably the only match where I genuinely had no idea how it would end, and it could have gone anywhere. I also love Badass Normal characters like Kyouko, so Himematsu winning made me incredibly hype||
Achiga ||somewhat disappointed that Achiga and Shiraitodai were the ones to make it through even if (or maybe exactly because) that was completely expected. Toki was easily the best character in Achiga, and the Shindouji group also had me rooting for them way more than the main characters. Achiga group is by far the weakest one character-wise in the entire franchise.||
blessed show the whole way through
alright done with Saki Achiga and Zenkoku-hen
"bruh I just wanted to play mahjong and this girl is literally summoning devils into her body to beat me wtf"

also
||Himematsu|| actually got through hell yeah
I haven't been this excited by a match result in anime in forever
<@!152896851660505088> just finished the quarterfinals in zenkoku-hen
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's like "shut up, you 'subtext' people. at least half the girls are gay, some are bi, and some of their moms are gay too!"
yeah I knew that part before starting the show <:KokroYes:504405873804705822>
also nice
just a really strong cast <:EveBless:585567202359640074>
my favorites from s1 were Yumi/Momoko, Touka/Hajime/Koromo, Hisa/Nodoka
also Toki is way too cute, Ogura Yui is too strong for this world
Saki in the spinoff:
Saki in the main anime:
I've been making some good memes watching
now in the middle of Zenkoku-hen so I can join up the timeline and then get back to Achiga <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
watched up to ep7 of Achiga
finished s1
dw I'm watching everything
shhh I'm not done with the anime and haven't touched the manga yet <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
tons of great characters
the yuri is great but the show in general is just real good
you're very cultured as always
<:ChisatoStare:506072710510673931>
gonna start Shinohayu now, heard only good things about it <:KokroYes:504405873804705822>
<:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
look at this chad
meanwhile, I thoroughly enjoyed what's available of the Toki manga, Toki is such a cute
yeah that feels like it's the obvious development but the way it's now it means we don't get to see them talk for the next 50 chapter or so <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
maybe it's my bias speaking, but also in order to shorten the story I'd have liked to see ||Saki lose in the semifinals, *Teru* go talk to her about it (with her team in the know, it's not unreasonable that they'd push her to do it), they don't quite make up yet but promise to meet in the individuals.||
semifinals anime would be great even though it'll be sad to ||see Kyouko lose||
it's the same problem as Kiseki, I *do* like how big the world is and how everything seems like it'll come together at the end, but I'm not gonna be alive to witness it by the time it gets there <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but we're never getting there!
technically they're supposed to come up later again
it's a shame many of the early ones end up underused
yeah I like tons of the characters
those two scenes expand her character a lot without showing us much
and then right before the flashback when she's comforted by Sumire after meeting Saki
but first the small scene with Awai on the rooftop
the parts I liked the most were actually not the backstory itself
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Teru very good
yeah <:KokroYes:504405873804705822>
*guess what*
and it was hilarious seeing people in 2012 be like "Ritz so slow, the manga will be done by 2020 at this rate"
cause it's fun
I actually went to read comments on the manga from way back
it's mostly about the building up hype for Shizuno, and the problem with that is we won't see if it's deserved for the next 4 years <:MakiOmegaLUL:795454608813588547>
honestly I don't actually feel Achiga's done that much, but I get where you're coming from
<:MakiLUL:757002008027725884>
look
<:WhenKokroGetsAtYou:689637371968225362>
I can draw better than Ritz
someone help ritz draw please
<:DMJiiHug:579676447854034947>
<@!152896851660505088> I caught up with main Saki manga and all of Toki too <:KokroYes:504405873804705822> only Shinohayu left
I feel like it's probably just been too long since Saki was popular enough to get anime
having almost caught up to Shirohayu, I wish we could get an anime
oh right damn yen press for changing Yuuki's aunt's wife into a husband lmao
and there are like 18 chapters released past that
yeah afaik it's up to volume 20?
<a:ChisatoZoom:564400410450722816>
conclusion: it's not nearly as cool as Saki makes it seem <:KaguyaPensive:795454454077063168>
<@!152896851660505088> I've finally arrived onto the terminal stage of my addiction

...I spent the last few hours playing mahjong <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm sorry there is no cure
if at least I could find the raw online I could probably read it with some tools, but reading the physical book in Japanese is impossible for me
the prologue and chapter 1 were tl'd and they were great, but tl's didn't continue and now I'm <:AyaDed:674382490755924009>
think I talked about it here once, it's Wasurenu Majo
I have a yuri LN I want to read and I even own it, but it's in JP and there are no translations <:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
Saki side-tracked me
sorry not yet <:KokroSlain:567673226839326732>
I read the end of WataNare vol3 today and while the series itself is just 'good' this volume's ending was so pog
ah I see
oh btw Millhi, do you read any other yuri LN apart from Adashima
<:NotLikeSword:607851587989274634>
I felt like this was bound to happen at some point or another but aaaa
OH SHIT
I can't believe someone remembers ~~Shinobu~~ Noel from Nanoha (edit: clearly I didn't either)
that's because they're cowards <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
novels never <:GWmythicalFeelsSadMan:374568771421208577>
<:KokroYes:504405873804705822>
*slap*
"you alive bruh?"
true but that's when you go "but why didn't she" and try to guess <:MakiLUL:757002008027725884> well I don't wanna say much since you're still watching but it's not like I don't understand where Koguma was coming from
enjoy it <:KokroYes:504405873804705822>
top tier ep
there's once again a lot of the "just try to understand what the characters are feeling on your own" that made me love the show so much and was missing a bit recently
<:EveBless:585567202359640074>
<@!152896851660505088> very good super cub ep again
what *could* possibly happen to an anime for this to happen <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> h-how will they make money
I've already seen comments and I don't care <:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:MisakiJudge:504405858055225354>
I guess I'm vaguely excited for Higurashi Sotsu because I need to know how Satoko and Rika end up fucking I mean what
summer is traaaaash
>spend the entire series showing how Koguma is used to handling things by herself since she was always alone
>she takes care of Shii on her own in ep 11
<@!152896851660505088> I found something fun lmao

(~~I do understand that 'run an anime studio' is an oversimplification~~)
I'm not surprised that a company that runs like shit in general couldn't manage to run an anime studio either <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I don't know what it is about LL that's different from other similar series I like
yeah <:ArisaLazy:567673742285733905>
tbf I don't actually like LL very much so even if I say she's my favorite in the group, that's just liking her a bit
Nico is best Muse <:ChisatoStare:506072710510673931>
wait did I just find my first real disagreement with Millhi
<:TopDad:664848944517480489>
just finished the ep, solidified as 8.5/10
<:DMJiiHug:579676447854034947>
I was!
yes
2) you shouldn't cause the original PMMM is a legendary show why wouldn't you watch it first anyway
1) you shouldn't because Magia Record *wants* to play on your expectations stemming from the original
yeah
fairly sure this is fanart of a vtuber
if we're recommending mahou shoujos there's always Flip Flappers
Asuka <:KokroYes:504405873804705822>
<:KokroYes:504405873804705822>
and yeah Magia Record isn't lighter anyway
I don't think anything in PMMM is "gory" per se
just a nice finale overall
I don't have 18+ stuff showing on my pixiv so I only get the good stuff <:ChisatoStare:506072710510673931>
🚓
why are you like this
Sango is the best because I've seen the best fanart of her
seems like it
https://twitter.com/RanobeSugoi/status/1408389802148327433
It's sitting at a nice ???/10 for me right now
I think BRR has transcended concepts such as 'good' or 'bad'
do not try a drinking game where you take a shot every time they say "omoi", you will die like 1/5th through the episode
since you haven't watched the latest BRR
<:HyperYuunaBox:795798590165483541>
I enjoyed it because I was watching without subs which enhanced the "what the fuck is going on" factor
that show will forever be on its own tier
yeah ofc it's not even approaching Gekidol
I honestly can't explain how I'm still enjoying it, even though I am
Blue Reflection is reaching Gekidol levels of "I can't even tell what's actually happening"
you could probably get me to do anything if it's for some good bread
bread is powerful
I was only planning to add some of the seiyuu dialogue <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
my translation ocd is too severe to just leave it alone
then I promptly died inside the moment I actually looked at what the lyrics taken from the wiki were like
I was like "hey what if I try to make progress on those live 2016 subs"
this is a bit off-topic, but I'm doing something incredibly dumb that might entertain you <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:MakiOmegaLUL:795454608813588547>
let's watch this trainwreck to the end
oh right the final episode of the first cour of Blue Reflection Ray just aired
so I just enjoy whatever the few people I follow retweet
I'm too lazy to follow people on twitter
<:KaoruSigh:462933876881358848>
in the first place, it's not like the gems live in JP society so you can just assume the pronouns mean nothing and ignore everything <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:MikuRave:858506953436954655>
I have been poking around here more often recently, though indeed I haven't really seen you <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
"boku and ore are male" is an oversimplification
that's the point
none of the gems are gendered ever in Japanese, of course
https://twitter.com/RanobeSugoi/status/1409789861070970881
that ed tho
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I like how the running sequence in the OP ||seems to frame Satoko as the one we should be supporting. Because I sure am! <:kekw:716193705316581486>||
I spent my last few days subbing the live full force so I'll take it easy now <:MakiOmegaLUL:795454608813588547>
this season I mean
I think I'm literally only watching this?
well yeah thinking about it for even one second I can't imagine a situation where that would be happening in the plot lmao
oh nice
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
dammit I haven't watched the ep yet, and even though I totally knew this was gonna be about Gou, I still opened it
not much judging by the OP <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I could literally not care less about 95% of these episodes because it's all stuff I already knew <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
welp, overall it's just as I feared though
if just because then I can tell all the references to it in Yuyuyui
one day I'll watch ririsupa
s2 is just a 10/10 anime
it was really great but it's monthly so it's time to suffer forever
welp catching up to Machikado manga has left me empty inside <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
watched all of Machikado Mazoku and it was absolutely amazing, 9/10 <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>

the mangaka doing the adaptation is also doing his own yuri work so
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U3h2dPkdN0> if you want to give it a listen <:EveBless:585567202359640074>
as the OP for the show itself it's great already but the second half of the song just goes nuts towards the end
for the 2nd cour yeah <:KokroYes:504405873804705822>
to the two (one?) people still watching Blue Reflection over here, holy shit the new OP's full version is insanely good
<:AdachiStare:664848361823797249>
this isn't ... *checks list*... wait what good anime is there even this season
okay prob not gonna watch this one
I'll just say the main girl exuded more personality in the first minute than Honoka did in 2 seasons and a movie
ep1 usually decides if I'm gonna watch a LL season
i'm just gonna watch the raws
the movie isn't even a good experience for building up year 3
just read the year 2 novels or something
do you really though <:KaguyaSmug:742004030846402580>
if you've watched Liz end it there
just don't
which somehow gave us an 11/10 in Liz but also fucked up everything else <:kekw:716193705316581486>
but well, the movie would have been an absolute mess anyway because of the way they went about adapting year 2
yeah the problem with Hibike is that they doubled back on their vision with the movie
it's alright Millhi I'm keeping the most hurtful comment to myself
<:TopDad:664848944517480489>
now, the artist doing the manga adaptation is a yuri manga author so that gives me some hope <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367> but I don't think I'll follow the anime for real until I have confirmation there's something more for me in it
but I need some substance
people are watching it for the pretty art <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but I don't think it was amazing or anything
that ep1 was decent
<:MahiruHugKaren:588426470003703834>
so I guess I'm still watching... Higu Sotsu, Aquatope (maybe???) and is that it?
and Tantei <:AyaDed:674382490755924009>
I dropped LL Superstar too <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm not watching it <:ArisaLazy:567673742285733905>
uhhh are we going to tell them
I feel like most people know already but still <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:pain:759159608370921503>
I got it but I couldn't be sure if you were kidding so <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
if for some reason that bothered you, there's no need to be <:MakiLUL:757002008027725884>
the show progresses past the characters being 18 so
how am I supposed to cope with needing to wait like at least a year before I get to see ShamiMomo date or something
that's the problem
I have
meanwhile I'm still in Machikado burnout <:FeelsBadMan:391321619748093972>
<:kekw:716193705316581486>
kageki shoujo != shoujo kageki
what really stings is that they could totally have given everyone development if they didn't put in the romance plot
yeah, usually I like it but this time they kinda fucked up everything
Chikai was just a mistake on many levels <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Yuuko and Natsuki's development is also like cut to 1/4th or something
Kanade gets like half the development, all the other new people get shafted and Kabe-chan-senpai barely appears reeeeeeeeeeee
I mean the movie is trash as a representation of all the year 2 characters too
but I'm not talking about the yuri or anything
my "read the novels" was more tongue in cheek than anything <:MakiLUL:757002008027725884>
it's a manga yeah
it *is* technically fine as a standalone movie but that's only if you're not gonna watch Hibike at all. If you are, why would you watch it backwards <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
sorry I just have no idea what your friend's on about since Liz takes place after s2 of Hibike and builds on characters introduced there <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
wait why would you watch Liz *before* Hibike s1/s2
Ayumu is the gayest LL character and that's saying a lot
<:AyumuSmug:790390357572583454>
I'll look forward to you finishing ep11 <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
oh I'll hold my thoughts for now then <:MakiLUL:757002008027725884>
what ep are you on?
as long as you're armed with the knowledge that all gacha games are bad and you should never touch one no matter how appealing they make it sound, you'll be alright
and that reason is that it's a damn amazing anime
there's a reason UmaMusu s2 is literally the best selling anime ever by a wide margin despite not even all BD volumes being out
uhh not really, the new one is a direct sequel
continuing from after Kai
Gou is a direct sequel
here it is
oh btw, new adashima volume cover is finally out and it looks great <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:pain:759159608370921503>
oh god was it actually her I didn't know that <:MakiOmegaLUL:795454608813588547>
(which are the ones the ripplesubs release is based on)
true but there's just no comparing the terrible official subs for Starlight to the fansubs by ChyuuPAS
also technically the wasei eigo オープン has quite a few meanings
in this case I think it simply comes from open/closed signs being widespread
there's innumerable cases of it so <:MakiLUL:757002008027725884>
loanwords
this single pic is what I remember most from the show
Fuuko best Clannad girl prove me wrong
but cour 2 has just been surprisingly solid
I would never have recommended it to anyone
honestly for the entirety of cour 1 it was sitting at 6/10 for me
yeah
my current impressions of BRR at ep 17:
> what the actual fuck
> i can't believe brr is gonna end up being wonder egg priority except good
<:kekw:716193705316581486>
I don't understand how that happened
but somehow it won't ever become bad!
hint: it will never, never stop being weird
<:Gunchan:779071273388867645>
the real required yuyuyu readings are all the ultragay chapters in the gacha game <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
not with you, but the site, they should allow us to rate Liz 11/10
I take issue with that rating
I see it as a "I got this" gesture <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I'm so happy, I already missed all the characters <:HibikiCry:601426670372782081>
oooo this was so cute
but that is also just English being weird as well
the only actual mistake is the cake slice getting de-fattened to 1/1000th its amount of calories <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
what can I say, English <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
hence what Chris says later
in the subs Hibiki says "[crayfish] just scream "Chris" to me!"
literally her question is "who exactly fits with crayfish?"
it makes sense
Fudou and Shem-ha on the last Shinai pls
this was pretty great <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
best Shinai yet
this was incredible
<:KirikaBIGNom:653930308260986893>
