Soon(tm) according to Alice
okay
yeah
I can see the problem there
oh
I'm still not sure what's inherently bad about thsi
oh wait it lets you see what servers a user is in
but what's the problem with this
I'm shitfaced rn
Now
Aug 7 IIRC
Nearest Birthday is Maria, btw
I look forward to more in the future
It was fun!
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I'd lick my fingers after eating Kanade
Since as-is she essentially doubles the message count of large image dumps
Suggestion: Shirabe can be pinged on command in the art channels, instead of auto posting a source for *every single image*
just my 2 cents
I don't care too much either way though
only potential snag there is the figs/fanworks channel is nsfw and fancontent isn't
since it's a good 70% of what gets discussed there anyways
Personally I'd say make the figures channel it's own thing and just add fanfics to fan content
Light/Aqua blue is already taken by the Elfnein role though
I forgot Light Mode existed lol
or a pale pink but idk if that would be different enough from Shirabe
pale yellow or light brown or something
Could do like
this server lacks a Serena/Color Me Serena role
Oh also suggestion since it came up in conversation last night
wasn't that their april fools' joke or something
I too vote for crabbbasa
I more meant I assumed you still remembered her birthday was July 28th lol
but Kanade's birthday is only ten days before Maria's
I just ~~complained~~ brought it up because the typical "Put it up on their birthday and leave it up for a month/until the next birthday" gives most of the gears three weeks to a month of birthday spotlight
honestly the staff is pretty good about these kind of things so I don't think they needed reminding
~~coughcough <@!102691114762371072> coughcough~~
https://i.imgur.com/xtYwaWr.png
~~cough cough~~
~~but~~
~~I know we like our shiny new animated rotating server icon~~
that's a cute basa
I'll take that
Suggestion: Even spoiler-tagged, art pertaining to the latest episode of XV is to be kept in <#431914167826382860> until 24 hours after the YameteTomete release
just like she is
It's so perfect
Fair enough
~~I wouldn't even be able to use it because I don't have Nitro but would it be possible to turn the current server icon into an emote after we take it down~~
but it's okay, it's still wonderful
not necessarily that you remembered the "Let's make all of July Kanade-month"
In-line emotes are really small
Maybe a bit closer even
I knew I'd seen that recently but couldn't remember how or where lol
My authority on the matter ends at being able to tell you your idea isn't dead in the water
probably, but I don't have an actual say
Those are considered fair game, as we have several emotes from them
Now I have a useable crazy face emote
Oh good
I somehow read it as changing your color without character roles
I misread your post
Oh
You can use the color me roles
yeah
still not great tho
that's better
Cropped down further

might need to crop it in a bit more
hmm
I am not an artist
I tried cleaning it, idk how good it looks

Though that's more an angry grab
With some clever trimming you might be able to use the artwork from Glorious Break from XDU
I'm just saying don't be disappointed if they get rejected
Yeah, and that's fine
Emotes get rejected a lot for being too difficult to read in-line
Yes?
and that has to be considered
That's exactly what I meant by in-line
probably same with 5 tbh
2 is cute but I think it'll be too had to see what's happening in-line
1, 4, and 5 have the best potential as emotes imo
"dagger" was right there
come on man
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Either that or someone who can copy the style nearly perfectly
That Kiri is from XDU art
The JP wiki has long since been pinned in the JP channel too
also the JP wiki is designed for the JP version of the game, and there are at least three cards that are *entirely* different between JP and Global
Everything else is weird because it mixes ratings based on both PvE and PvP, and what is good (or even passable) for one is not necessarily good for the others
The JP wiki is only good for actual hard numbers and stuff
A meme bike emote would be great too, even if it has to be first on the chopping block if/when we reach the limit
That's a great Elsa too
I definitely support those two Kanade emotes being added
I used it a few times
KanadePadoru was definitely a thing
<:PadoruSerena:688181190015844376> ~~still exists though~~
She'd be the first to get cut
It makes sense though, Kanade is not as popular
:padoruk only finds Kirika
so I guess the rest can go too
Padoru Kanade has already been dismissed
~~i don't have nitro so I can't use her but she's coming~~
Yay!
KanadeBear and SerenaBear
The last suggestion before Bang
Is there a reason the bears were rejected?
:(
"Tsu... basa... friend..."
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/701642370357264465.gif?v=1

This emote is made by <@!193590220640223232>, so now we finally have a Kanade Bear created by someone we can talk to. Should it be added?
at least my Kiricoin didn't expire llol
I was really, really drunk last night and could feel a downward spiral coming on and bailed before I did something stupid in this server
Sorry

back at launch in JP you couldn't use the same character more than once even
Yeah you can't field the same unit more than once
it's not really worth rn
so like once you LU a card you can feed other units to it for a chance to level up skills
Skill leveling is done by feeding the units to another RB (LU, I think, on Global) unit
No
Red raid has a stacking ATK buff
It'll be a while but you'll get there
Eventually your raids will look like this
that's actually strong enough to reliably one-shot units that don't have immunity
If you really want a black nuker Hibiki one comes along much later
No
Green Carol can drop orange materials, yes
With the comparatively small playerbase Global has, just refreshing is probably *feasible*, unlike JP, just difficult
Being followers makes it dramatically easier
~~she is brutal and unfun~~
~~there was a reason we called her Cancerfine~~
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
It's simple, just kill her before she can proc Instant Death
It gets frustrating, I know
Because ~~that stupid bitch~~ Fine refused to drop the mats I needed
When raids first came out in JP it took me like a month to get the mats to RB the Kanade I wanted to get
There's 16 total raid bosses in JP
it doesn't work
I have tried it
since you can't get to 100%
but to what extent is unknown
and these do stack with 6* buffs
30% from passive, 30% more from buff IIRC
So even some non-6* units can do it
Note: some units have additional attack/counter attack chance on buffs provided by skills
that's neat
Oh, I didn't know about win+shift+s
alt+prtsc only grabs the active window
just so you know, if you care
Crab?
Poison is uber meme in JP yes
Hell, one of her welfare 4*s inflicts burn
Three of the units on my PvP team can inflict burn
assuming it'll follow the same
or started, in JP
Dragon Dusk starts the trend
Kanade kinda becomes the "burn" person later on
~~Godzilla Kanade with all-target burn is bae~~
burn is lulz
she *only* buffed Reds
she did *not* buff blues
since at launch
which was the ultimate meme in JP for her
She buffs Reds though
They both have Taunt I'm pretty sure
Then only attack Micha
Taunt makes you only attack Leiur until she's dead
Berserk is functionally equivalent to Silence, yeah
There's also Taunt
Rage/Berserk
all that's in it is 1* and 2* mems
but it makes inventory management much easier
I'm not close to running out of storage either
(within reason, of course)
storage is the one thing I'm willing to shell out stones for without question
Gacha is horrible value for stones lol
yes
storage is arguably the best investment of song stones tbh
You'll get there eventually
I keep a copy just because collection but other than the 1* flower obaa-san they're all pretty much absolute garbage
Not really
You will eventually have more than you know what to do with
^
and exp mats
Raids are balanced around Level 70
Nobody had Level 70s
He's a Relic
Dragon Knight dude?
Power is Red, yes?
and a more traditional suit to finish things off
I thought I had at least one more in here
but Kanade is Kanade and Kanade is always cute
I greatly prefer long hair in general
I do not know how I feel about trimming the wing


now let's check the monochrome and sketches folders...
that's all the *colored* art I have
let's see
chris in old-timey suit





not exactly a suit but UNIFORM



there should be some more in my "With Hibiki" folder...
let's see
bonus S.O.N.G. uniform


again not quite a suit




alright first up, not exactly a suit, but


also happy birthday to the greatest girl there ever was

C U T E
this is the sfw channel
beautiful
what better way to kick off the art channel than with my #1 favorite Kanade fanart
Do you have Maria in the adorable sailor uniform
I can neither confirm nor deny that I only save pictures with Kanade in them


Mommaria!


Happy Birthday Maria!
Your daily dose of L O V E
Memories of a better time
I like to think she was the sort to do silly things to try to make Tsubasa and the others laugh
also I'm not sure what this silliness is but I love it

Get the more paper cut-out texture like the actual OVAs have?

C U T E
Extra fluffy Kanades today



on a less "Dear christ what happened to your spine?" note
oh dear god
Since it just came up in my wallpaper rotation, have my very #1 favorite image of Kanade
This is good
<:KanadeSmile:341463635492601856>
You must construct additional kanades
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
there's one
oh wait
there's *none*
like
but
you said "Many" and I was gonna say that it's okay to only have a few
I want Kanade to bully me gently
"oh"
"Oh this is such a great piece of Kanade fanart for my phone wallpaper! Alright, let me turn my phone sideways to play XDU-"
Maria is cute af
It's a fun little headcanon/AU thing
I've always liked Berserker Hibiki as a sort of semi-feral pet


Interesting one with Kanade as a griffin or somoething similar
wiping_head_with_towel.tiff












I like how Maria herself isn't a Jigglypuff, it's just her HEAD
Lots of new Kanade fanart to share
Daily L O V E - Gungnir has the best taste edition
Daily L O V E - planning the concert that will never be edition
I choose to believe that Kanade and Serena are getting into shenanigans together in the afterlife




CUTE LIL' KANADE
Ruffly Fluffly L O V E
Daily (sleepy) L O V E before I go to bed
Oh hey, one more for the new stuff
That'll do for now I suppose

One of my favorites









I'm gonna post some Kanades in hopes that it makes me feel better
Daily L O V E please don't go into the light edition
Daily L O V E for you to stare wistfully at
DAILY L O V E (extra fua fua edition)
Another daily dose of L O V E featuring Maria because happy birthday you adorable tentacle monster
Maria is the best living girl
There is a *lot* of porn of Symphogear characters who aren't Kanade
I'm used to only looking at Kanade's tags on Pixiv
also goddamn
Found it with the help of a friend(o)
C U T E
>end up finding a piece of Kanade fanart I've never seen
>try to find it on Google
it's like the cutest thing
I used to have it
Not a seifuku, like an actual Japanese navy sailor outfit
I want to be her friend
Maria is so very pretty
so cute I could hug her to dess
"I'll hold weapons in both my hands so I never have to hold someone elses hand again! HA! Take that, love and friendship!"
A true friendo!
THE FRILLY CUTE XDU OUTFIT GOT SOME FANART
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS
(fuck me that's good)

In fact I have more than one
Pharah is cute
maria a cute
good night friends
time for sleep
three images I'd call outright bad
wait I forgot about my most recent trip to deviant art
There's more than a few that are mediocre and or have weird proportions, but a solid 80+% of it is at least decent
I mean my fanart folder has almost 1400 images in it and there are only two I'd actually call outright *bad*
and I'm grateful that the overwhelming majority of it is pretty good
I understand why that's the case
While I am kinda sad that Kanade gets so much less fanart than the other characters
You know













Kanade is sleepy and so am I. Good night friends, see you tomorrow.











so I'm gonna
I feel like posting some Kanade art
I love how her hair flows in that one kaliks
also that's one of my favorite kanade arts
cute spooky halloween geahs
probably
Apparently he blocks a lot of americans though so idk
because I had no tweets since like 2012
so maybe he thought I was a bot or something
I don't use twitter like... at all though
I followed him and about twenty minutes later I was blocked
Because I'm american
because I am a filthy gaijin
he blocked me on twitter
I don't know if I have all of it, but I have a lot of it
while the others are all arriving there
since Kanade and Serena are together and already at wherever it is
It's definitely younger geahs but I always got the impression that it was somehow them talking to or visiting the ones that died
Yeah
Possibly G
This pic predates GX at least
No*
Mp idea
Miku's murder eyes always make me laugh in the second one
did someone say long haird bikki
Chibi cape!
that is tucked under her belt
but rather part of her jacket
like they're not pants
It looks
Cape
wing-cape things
heavy armor and a cape
I think I've got a couple Kanades with capes
and it's always good for them to have a fluffy partner to snuggle with on cold nights
Remember, birbs need lots of love and support to grow up big and strong!
Or nervous. Meeting new birbs can be scary!
sometimes birbs can be angry too
Birbs can cheer up anyone!
cute gungnir burbs






I want to be victimized by the fluff











Usually it's just two songs and their off-vocal versions
maybe it's just the concert duets
The CDs usually don't though I didn't think
Sometimes they include the TV size versions for certain songs
Those are the studio versions
yeah but even then you'd have to rip the episodes and manually trim them out
you can't buy the TV versions
Well
while the full studio versions are usually about 4-5 minutes long
and also the TV versions are usually only about a minute to a minute and a half long
Loses a little bit of the emotion from the scene but becomes much cleaner in general
Also in the TV versions the characters will sometimes yell/shout certain lines more than sing them
and no dialogue
Studio versions are longer
Also the fact that they dropped the XDU theme in AXZ makes me really hopeful that some/all of the new music for XDU will be released on AXZ soundtracks
The vast majority of Symphgoear music is really good
someone needs to uplaod the lossless shit
I want to hear the studio version of her AXZ song so
Ressou Gungnir and Ginwan Airgetlamh are probably my favorites though
I like all of Maria's songs
Linkleft's kanade is amazing
I spam Kanade like three times a week
don't worry
Maria is pretty!
yeah
especially since Kanade has never appeard in a zesshoushinai 😦
I'd be entirely okay with that
and everything is very silly and cute
everyone's happy and nobody died
AoT High School or the TTGL spinoff manga
she has very, very little art
but compared to, say, Maria
she gets a lot of art (and a lot of *very good* art) for a character who died s1e1
She's popular but not nearly to the level of the actually living characters
she's dead
y'know
given
which is understandable
since Kanade isn't very popular
I only have about 1200 pictures
Alone, with Tsubasa, with Hibiki, with Serena, and with others
then by who she's with
then colored, monochrome, sketches
Top level is fanart vs. official art
but that gave me well over 800 images in a single folder so I had to sort that
sometimes people tagged her when she wasn't there >.>
well provided she was actually present
and saved everything with her name tagged in it
after I went through Pixiv
I was forced to sort it
or that's a new one
it's either in completely the wrong spot
I went through and checked and with how I sort things
Oh
My what gallery
Thanks!
Yeah that's a new one for me
I think I actually don't have that one kaliks
oh hey
but yeah
I'm guessing that's supposed to be Serenade
the dolls as mannequins in that image makes me chuckle
Seeing that sort of love from Tsubasa's end is pretty easy
Most people did
yeah
not necessarily official but done by the lead artist I think?
or
that one I think is official
that don't have Kanade in them
are the only Symphogear fanart I have
this one
and
that one
the braid is so adorable
I love it
boom
that doesn't have Kanade at all in it
I've got one piece of Maria art
oh wait
also I kind of like how expensive they are, for nice ones. Means you don't buy a shitload of them and then have nowhere to put them except in your empty wallet
Yeah but Nendos are cute and small
but the nendos were made after S1, right?
It is a little overdone on the nendo, yeah
it's become more silver in the later seasons
Her hair was more lilac in S1
I'd definitely buy nendos of the FIS girls
I want it, I want it bad
idk if it ever got finished
or was
There's actually a custom Kanade nendo
I really wish they'd make FIS and Kanade nendos
I have the nendos
it printed money
Because shortstack in a sexy outfit
also I just don't like bunnysuits
it doesn't fit Chris' personality very well
I'm not a big fan of that figure
sadly
which is approximately 12,750 images occupying 14.3GB
I mean I also have every frame she (or a picture of her) appears in in the anime
I check Pixiv a few times a week to see if anything new pops up
Which includes nearly all her fanart, all her official art, and all her art from XDU
1.86GB
The sum total of all of her fanart is only a handful of gigabytes
It's not that much
I don't have *all* of her art I don't think, but definitely the overwhelming majority of it
I spent a lot of time on 4chan and pixiv and boorus
alright that looks to be everything I've got









wew here's some questionable art
hold up, not done yet I don't think












incoming Lydian outfit Kanade
alrighty
Gimme a minute though my sound is whacked out need to restart my PC
also if you want Kanade in a Lydian outfit I have a bunch of that
I'd lean that more towards NSFW
If you're not sure I'd say put it in nsfw to be safe
been a while
I guess it's time to troll twitter again
Shit, that one's new, too
I definitely haven't seen that before
That is also a new one


So fluffy!
*I must MLB as many Kanades as I can*
*sixth copy fucking where*
Five copies of it are
re: official art of Maria in the Lydian outfit
The Lydian uniforms look *great* in general
Maria does too
So cute
Kanade looks so good in the Lydian outfit
"It's nice that I got invited" is basically my reaction whenever Kanade gets included in group shot fanart

Oh I love that art style
but it's a good butt
like it's not Hibiki-tier
Not enough fanart puts emphasis on Kanade's butt
kitty kat kanyaade
My wallet will be dead if they put out ancient Japanese-style Kanade
either that or a crossover of Kemono Friends and Flip Flappers
looks like Kemono Friends

No way for Maria to be 21 in GX if she's not in G
and GX starts only six months after G ends
G definitely happens in the winter, based on Lydian uniforms worn during G
Wiki does not correctly account for birthdays between seasons
Do so
IF you want to wallow in ignorance
Whatever
Fine
Wiki is wrong
G takes place in winter based on Lydian uniforms, GX in summer, and Tsubasa's graduation is stated to be between the two
No she's not
not 2y9mo
So Maria is 1y9mo older than Tsuba
and Tsubasa turned 20 between G and GX (G in winter, GX in summer, Tsubasa's birthday in late spring)
She turned 22 between GX and AXZ
*Maria's* birthday was during 3.5
Wait never mind I read something wrong
Wait
Making her just a bit under 3 years older
So if Maria was born in August of "Year 0", Tsubasa was born in May of "Year 3"
I mistyped
August three years prior to Tsubasa
Derp
she was born in August the year prior to Tsubasa
Maria is like 2 years 9 months older than Tsubasa
What? No
The overall series timeline from the start of G to the end of AXZ is really short
after Maria's 21st birthday
which places G as happening in winter
Tsubasa states that her graduation from Lydian was 3 months after the end of G in the zesshoushinai, and the start of GX was three months after that
hence, Maria is approximately two years older than Serena
Serena was 13 when she died
So six years prior to G, Mariaw ould have been 15
wait nvm I confused myself
hmm
wait
which takes place in the six months between GX and AXZ
since Tsubasa celebrated her 19th birthday during the 3.5 event from XDU
GX takes place in the fall after Tsubasa turned 19
Since she turned 22 before GX started
Maria is *already 21* during the events of G
Okay wait, I think I got this figured out with the help of the other discord
20 in G
Maria was 21 in GX
Maria was 20 (recently) at the beginning of G
She was 13 at the time of her death
Serena died 6 years before the events of G
Oh here we are
It's stated in a flashback in G I'm pretty sure
since her birthday is apparently October 15
Or 19, about to turn 20
"Serena is 2 years younger than Maria. If she was alive, as of AXZ, she would be 20 years old."
so Serena would be on the borderline if she were still alive
and drinking age in Japan *is* 20
Maria is 22 now IIRC
Though if Dess and Jii are serving...
Serena is probably ~1.5 years younger than Kanade, entirely possible she's not old enough to go in the bar
new kanade aaaaaaaaaaart
Which means if Maria is 22 during AXZ, she had to be 21 during G
Yeah
Also Chris would have graduated if a full year had passed
^^
The timeframe from start of G to end of AXZ is like 9-10 months
Summer uniforms in GX
Those are winter uniforms though
We know there are six months between G and GX
So I would *guess* S1 was Spring?
and since AXZ happens only a little while after GX, it's presumably fall
and G is winter and GX is summer
I remember people talking about "finishing the seasons" (as in, of the year) with AXZ
The Lydian students are wearing winter uniforms during G
G is winter though
Maybe late November
"Winter" in Japan is still like December-February
It's in the same hemisphere so it's not the opposite
Yes
Serena is just appreciating the fluffiness of Kanade's Kanades
Yeah! Thanks <@123147794658754560>, I don't get to Twitter that often, and this last week (and next one) has been really busy. Thanks for posting and tagging me!
I still don't have my own wifi though so I'm at mcdonalds again
Yes, I'm in japan
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
have there been any kanades in nsfw?
When this shitty mcdonalds wifi decides to work I will go through it
I have had a Kanadrought
CUTE KANADESSSSSSSS
CUTE KANADE GEAR DESIGNS
CUTE BLUSHING KANADE
I HAVE NOT HAD AN INTERNET CONNECTION FOR THREE DAYS GIVE ME NEW KANADES
The Yuri Giant

B) Smoking is super unattractive and *everyone* does it
A) KanaBiki is dumb
why is this the guy that draws the most Kanade art?
ugh I hate this vampire hunter AU
PUNCHNIR KANADE
I got one!





I know it's not a new image but it popped up in my screensaver and I felt I needed to post it
Kanadeeeeeee
actual furries
you know
with
That pic solopy posted

(spoilers: it's not)
Regardless of whether or not you think it's furry
If she is in the image I will save it
I collect all fanart of kanade
No furrier than this
that is not furry
that's the gears as animals
bruh
>no furries
Did someone say team pets
Some decent Zwei Wing cosplay pics tho
The only truly *bad* Kanade fanart I've found has come from there
because I must have any Kanades I can find
I go through DA once in a while
Jaga's art is so great when they aren't drawing everyone smoking three packs a day
man
Today is a great Kana-day!
So many Kanades!
Pretty! Thanks!

Oh my god

giant rideable flightless birds from the Final Fantasy series
They're basically a chicken mixed with an ostrich
tfw not drinking with kanade
I want to be drinking buddies with my wife
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I like the way he draws Maria a lot, too
Like that one, that's a good pic
when he's not drawing everyone smoking or his weird obsession with HibiKana
is great
This guy's art
man
goddamn it japan

Holy shit, it's spelled it right when I spell it out thanks Google

I have a lot of kanabirb

b
r
i
b
of *course* I have it
the *best* official art of Kanade
I mean the infor is on a spread of like

so it says "because a wing needs to be aerodynamic"
that needs to be updated to post GX
guess not
coulda sworn I had another
not specifically bikki but
I'm not Rukia but I've got a couple, I think
also merry christmas to me, got a new piece of Kanade art in that dump
it was neither
oh
wait do we mean bacon like actual bacon or bacon like Baiken from Guilty Gear

I think there was a memoria in XDU that had cat ears?
so
I only save art with Kanade in it
probably
also that's the last of what I've got I think and my video game characters are yelling at me to keep playing
also not cats but it's cute and it's kemonomimi
some more actual cats
again eeveelutions which are kinda sorta feline ish a little
mix of cats and dogs
yeah, Bikki as an eevee and Kanade as a Flareon
eeveelutions are usually more canine though
cat-ish?

not exactly but


I have at least one
I forget what it is though
It has an actual name
Or the gray form from all the geah powers?
The golden form?

whole thing's on batoto if you ever feel interested
Overall it was nothing special, but it was really cute and it was a quick read
(also one of the secondary characters in this is a raptorgirl)
thanks for asking about raptorgirls
so
I am having the time of my life reading this

yeah he's a fighter
Oh no he just beat the everliving piss out of someone
Apparently boyfriend-kun is also either a god-tier street fighter or garnered that reputation in some other manner
https://i.imgur.com/I4OtHqz.png >she makes him pinky-promise with her tail
and it turns out she's basically a big baby and hasn't ever been trated nicely because she;s so scary
only her goal of "intimidate and scare" backfired *horribly* because he thinks she's adorable
and then *basically* gets mugged by Churio (T-Rex-chan) the next night
He comments on how he thinks dinosaur girls are really cute
this is great
Her X-ray looks so ridiculous

>big t-rex body

I'm gonna rig one of crab-kun's polls and get a T-Rex girl added to MonMusu
tsundere ore t-rex girl who's way taller than her boyfriend
but this shit is cute as hell
probably never sadly
so
It had an original manga run for two volumes over the course of just over a year
https://i.imgur.com/A19QXkH.png more raptor girls
this is good
>being scanlated by "raptor scans" on batoto

Apparently it's like Dragon Maid but with a T=Rex girl
Raptor imouto and T-Rex nee-san
A SCARY MONSTER DAKI
gonna post in NSFW because it's questionable
Gimme a sec
I FOUND SOME
HAHAHA
gimme a minute to see if I can find anything
yeah probably
so clever girl
like a raptopr as in the "clever girl" raptor or like a bird of prey
a raptor monstergirl
is that a specific thing or do you just mean like
Also thanks for the ping earlier - I saw that one already but it's good enough to see twice <:KanadeSmile:341463635492601856>
You could land a B-52 between those tits

*sadly the manga got canned like two years ago so it never finished*
SUDDENLY ANKYLOSAURUS GIRL AND SHE'S GREAT
SAME
yes
and loli is meh for me
Catgirls are cute but I'd prefer pretty much any other monstergirl
if that's heaven then I want to go to hell
There's a new one coming out Soon ™ but it's by the same guys who do MWO and apparently MWO isn't very good?
I miss MechWarrior
man
I had the freaking K'Nex MadCat when I was little
Not even like an HD remake, just one that plays well with modern OSs and supports resolutions above 1024x768

https://twitter.com/ra_men06/status/964736997544701952
like an Eva thing or something?
is that a reference to something? It looks familiar, but not as Chris
yeah most I've got is the same version
I'll check though
if there is I'm pretty sure I don't have it
I don't think there is a full version
she seems nice
yeeee
She cute
Yeah her
I don't know her name but my favorite character is already the big-titted onee-san witch lady
one of my friends just started watching it
pretty much the only things that I actually keep up on are Symphogear and Jojo
I've heard good things about it but tbh I have a hard time sitting down and watching anime lately
I haven't watched Konosuba
so vampire maria being very careful to not drink too much from Tsubasa is a very cute and lovely idea to me
like a vampire taking tiny nibbling bites or a succubus... doing succubus things
One of my favorite things in ~~porn doujins~~ manga or anime is a monstergirl who needs to, erm... "feed" on humans in some manner being intentionall fed
Jaga's endless tweet-spamming of motorcycle bullshit and his ridiculous kanabikki fetish is worth it for his occasional posts like this
Kanyaade and Hibikitty
I like how Shirabe's getting a handful even though she's asleep
"How can one person be so fluffy?" you ask? Well, it's quite simple.

Salty licorice sounds amazing tbh
Maria always wants Tsubasa to penetrate her <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
just like tsubasa's sword
Symphogear: Civil War
Oh hey a piece of Kanade fanart I don't have
it does look pretty cool apart from the implication that kirika is dead
It's a hybrid of Igalima and Shul Shagana
I like the tall one, cuz she's tall
My friend was right about at least one thing
Shirabe
Also holy shit speech-to-text can pick up the word doujins, but can't get sharabi
The entirety of my knowledge of love live comes from doujins and one of my friends, who watched it, and told me I'd like it because there's a really tall chick in it

Did someone say KONO MIO DA?

The THIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRD~
Hibiki
Hibiki
Hibiki

Now if only the gacha would give it to me
Thanks Alice
Man, I ain't the biggest fan of meido but Kanade looks so good in that outfit
Looks like the other universes were allowed to come visit for the Live!

I
GX and AXZ added some yellow accents and changed the outline of the stomach window
True, but there's also bigger differences now
Maria has more stuff on her collar, Hibiki and Maria's stomachs are covered, and Hibiki has a frilly "skirt" around her waist that both Kanade and Maria lack
It's not exactly the same, but it's similar
Thanks for posting it~
Oldie but a Goldie
which makes those categories more viable
but Kanade probably has a significantly smaller volume of fanart than Hibiki
and within those what she's wearing
then within those, by who she's with
I sort my kanade pictures by whether they're sketches, colored, or monochrome
thanks for the ping!
had a couple new ones in there
Anyways, sleep
Welcome to one of the major reasons I hate him
Yep
Just make sure it's Jii meat
Meant to be stuffed with meat and eaten
A sandwitch
Also Carol's voice actress got death threats before a concert after her role in GX, and actually had to cancel the concert because of it
From her manager before she signed onto King records
There's some stories floating around of fairly heavily implied molestation slash sexual assault against nana
It's super bad in Korea too
It really is
Yoko is married
A part of that too is simply that Asian cultures are much more conservative when it comes to relationships
It's a super fucked up system to be honest
Being a successful Idol basically means signing your life away to whatever company you sign up with

She looks so confused there
I could do it myself but like I said linkleft is so popular in the japanese sympphogear twitter community that anything she posts gets retweeted by other people I follow
I have a japanese gmail account and have been procrastinating actually making a japanese twitter
seems like it would be more effort than it would be worth to remove her watermarks
Someone in the 4chan discord at one point said it was an art thievery issue but idk
I wouldn't think it's a sourcing thing since she puts "TwitterID:@Linkleft" somewhere in the middle of every picture
So I do appreciate you posting them but I *did* already have those ones
Thankfully, her blocking me doesn't prevent other people I follow from retweeting her works
I only follow people
also it doesn't help that I have literally no tweets
She blocks foreigners who aren't artists, basically
last thing I saw her draw was the really nice IGNITE Kanade
so
Linkleft blocked me on twitter
kanade is probably a great durnk but it judoest change the fact that shed hate me because im an awful person
where the fuck you get that
hoih fuck that ines ne w too
i cnasn sotrt the rest out in the morning
I got it open in chrome
sort it
and aor tit
I shall sav ie
you know tbh I don't think I have that one
and then another like 3k fanart and officil art not featured in the show
it's actually like 12.5k frames from the anime
that's not a drunk typie
but a lot of that is literall drame-dumping form the tanime
I have like 14k pics of her
get it together
oh gjeex
More like Ame no Haba*bikki* amirite

BitTorrent is shit even on Mac
Use Deluge instead
I kinda want it
it's so stupid
her scythe is a pirate flag
those are two of my favorite kanades
like I'm not trying to be the fun police here but there are better ways to share images than to dump hundreds of individual pictures in a row
but no one wants that
I mean if you want I could join you and dump my ~13,000 pictures of Kanade
and even then half the time you guys post faster than Discord can even load images
I mean I get that but it's to the point where people can't consume it unless they're here watching it get dumped
also waking up to like 800+ new messages in sfw every morning is just absurd
like posting a bunch of images is fine but the repeated dumps of *multiple hundreds of pictures* is excessive
not
can you like
that was some moe shit right there
nyanko days
fuckin
and the original from the stitch thing
additionally

you can't post handholding here
bro this is the sfw channel
always wear a glove
Remember kids, handholding without protection can lead to unexpected pregnancies
and Fine as the mobster ex-husband guy
Chris as the main kid
also honestly I would pay good money to see Kindergarten Cop remade with Kanade instead of Arnold
The Govenade
Like I don't mind fit or even fairly muscular Kanade but those pictures are just Kanade's head slapped on a young Arnold Schwarzenegger body
DLanon straight up draws a man when he draws Kanade
that one image of kirika and shirabe asleep on the couch with shirabe copping a feel in her sleep makes my heart feel good
but it's definitely Tsubasa's hair wing and bangs
it looked kinda Kanade to me at first too, the expression and the red colors
you mean like actual Ignite?
each of them will get another full-size event and get their IGNITE forms
that's my guess
I'm guessing they'll wait to do another full-on Kanade event until they're ready to release IGNITE
yeah
There were files indicating a sequel Kanade event too, but those have since disappeared
whatever
I probably am
I sound like a goddmn crayz person
This is still after all this time probably my favorite, or at least one of myf avorite pictures of Kanade.  It manages to get both her beauty and her power so perfectly I think, and I adore the way her hair is drawn. I know it's not healthy or realistic or anything but I do love her. I really do. And I hope that someday, somehow, I can meet her and tell her that. And good god is this bad to just be typing out in the open like this but I don't care, she's the only person I think I've ever truly loved even though she isn't real.. I know that's not healthy and probably is a symptom of much more deep-rooted psychological issues but it makes me feel better and I can deal with that for just a little bit that way.

I love you, Kanade. I really do. 

I don't know what I'm doing typing this here tbh I've just had too much to dirnk tonight and I'mma sleeps oon anywyas. Maybe I'll dream about her again tonight. Once in a while I see her in my dreams and it's always nice, I always wake up in a good mood after I dream about her. Even when I don't remember my dreams sometimes I just wake up happy and I know it's because she was with me there

"What did you DO TO MY LITTLE SISTER?"
"I only encouraged her to have a little fun. Frankly this turned out *way* better than I had planned."
I feel like Kanade would encourage that sort of behavior too

12,793 frames of Kanade over S1-AXZ, 12,874 deaths at the concert
fun fact: 81 more people died in the concert massacre than there are frames of Kanade over all four seasons
Updated ~~and censored because I left my name in it last time~~
6'2" is like 190cm
I like taller women and my options are limited enough being average height
I'm glad I'm not super tall

then again I also have every frame Kanade appears in so I'm not exactly a control sample
'll still have my Kanades
plus if for some reason I don't have internet access I
I mean I have a few pictures of Kanade that aren't hosted online anywhere anymore to my knowledge

but not a picture role because I am too specific
and I have Kanades
bitches love cannons
tfw that imageset will never be completed with Mikugeah, Serena, Kanade, or Airgetlamh Maria
official s1 art is p good
Get a wallscroll of the dress, an illustration of the suit, an illustration of the dress, a cute little bag tag, and an acrylic stand-up of the dress

The show can't just be one long string of fight scenes

since Vol 4 was kinda the best it's been
If you didn't like Vol 4 it's definitely not for you
Vol 5, particularly the second half, is a slog
I don't blame you

Kanade in anything is very nice <:KanadeSmile:341463635492601856>

the sleeves have blue on them
She has her arm and hand up, holding her hair up
It's her outfit
I'm very fond of it
That's a good one

even if it's not great
like at least they cared enough to try
I applaud most people for their effort though
*even the not-so-good stuff*
even the not-so-good stuff
I save everything of her
I forgot about this image lmao

I'M FDURNK
GUESS WHAT
Maria's is a close #2
YYYYYYYYYYYY
so much lovely hair
I have the one on the right as my wallpaper
and I also have a Kanade phone case
but I use one of the arts of Bamboo Nebula as my wallpaper
My lock screen is the default
vintage saintposto
actually drawing girls
y'know
like DLAnon but
it's good
Saint draws stronk women
but Tsubasa appears to be more "fit"
Hibiki is probably stronger
Tsubasa is shown to be outrunning Hibiki and holding the water-on-knees pose more stably
Whenever the training montage is
or at least better stamina and endurance
in the G training montage she's demonstrated to be more athletic than Hibiki
like /fit/ fit
Tsubasa is meant to be fit
That's a cool basa
If only chris was that pure
>blushing, naked, balled-up tissues and gravure shots
hibiki and miku would probably say yes
ask to join them
don't masturbate to pictures of your friends
chris no
and getting it home would be a huge pain
It looks hella comfy but its also like $90
It's like two body pillows stuck together by a third body pillow so it's shaped like |_|
also they don't have the Miia one but they have this big U-shaped one that's like
I kinda need that
>TIO MATTRESS
I want a standard fucking daki
just
they're all round and ergonomically shaped or big or crazy
the local mall sells every manner of body pillow except the standard 50cm x 150cm rectangle
I am so disappointed
Women are prettier
Can confirm
As a straight dude
"Hibiki I told you we needed to use protection!"

But at least he's not Adam
and he died like a bitch
He thought he was big shit but he was actually nothing
It suited him
and it's all but directly stated that Cinder emotionally manipulated both of them into working with her
since they're clearly coerced into it
I don't count Emerald and Merc as villains tbh
Torchwick was *vaguely* interesting
All the villains are shit in RWBY
Either way
forgot
whoops
Oh
All of the villains are crap imo
Spoilers m8
She has no motivation other than "I'm evil" and by *god* her voice actress is fucking *awful*
Cinder by miles for me
and some of the characters never really improve
voice acting is *really* questionable in S1 too
it's okay
ehhhhh
Yang at least *acts* more mature than the rest of the cast
and either way
Yang has a year on Weiss and Blake IIRC, though I may be wrong about that
Yang checks all my boxes
Long, super voluminous hair: check
Fights with her fists in a world of crazy weapons: check
Boisterous attitude: check
Somewhat taller and older than the rest of the main cast: check
Older sister archetype: check
Tig Ol' Bitties: check

Yep

I, a Kirika fan, shall now post images of Kirika
Detective Conade!
but the one I go back to most just to have fun with is This One Goes to Eleven
The Heist is really good too
Yeah
~~except for the one we didn't see~~
Best fight scene in RvB
"This One Goes To Eleven"
YES
Red is the best trailer tbh
And that they have access to *good voice actors*
because it shows that RT can at least *try*
RvB generally being good confuses me so much
Yeah
*Way* stronger than he should be given the overall plot and relative power levels of the other characters
Shitty voice actor
Motivation literally that he can't get his dick wet
*fuck* Adam

This shit is kawaii as fuck

I just like the idea of her being in contorl
It's more aou having her lead than the act of being tied down
one of my friends described gentle femodm as "why we need feminsims: mporn edition" and I agree
if she's gentle about it
be
It can
I mean
I want Kanade to tie me to a chair and tease me
IS BESTEST FETSIHEST

you've heard of Swimphogears
For the quality of figure it's really high tbh
and possibly tax
plus shipping
like $120-$140
I didn't know the character's name but that's totally the chick I was thinking of
Yeah that's definitely what I was thinking
though my first thought was Fate, not FE
she *does* look familiar
buuuuuuuuuut

yes

<@215370118073548801> Kaminade
I've seen *tons* of signs and posters and shit with her on it
including just *in japan*
Fate is just so aggressively over-exposed literally anywhere that has anything to do with anime
I had no idea what her name was either
bikki dikki and miku niku
Miku's gobblin' up the bikki dikki the second it comes through the door
"patiently"
https://twitter.com/gummy1024/status/1024055458695327744
I considered that but went with dessjiimon because it preserves the syllable count
dessjiimon
I think it looks a little nicer to have the directional consistency
there's also a version with their hair colored in and everyone facing the same way
You can't find the colored source because I colored it myself a couple years ago and never did the big versions
CUUUUUUUUUUUTE
Elfneing is CUTE
I want adult eflnein
I want to rest my head on her stomach and feel her breathing
Kanade got the big bap
I am not complaining
<:KanadeSinging:421432676789256202>

Never really been a big fan of bunny suits, but the cat aesthetic does improve it

One punch man going to become one pump man with a girl like that
But only for Hibiki
Miku is a lewd machine
Miku is lewding herself to Hibiki's smell
Yeah
But then Kirika came along and Miku became purple
Her hair was green-ish a couple times too
This isn't G anymore
Was
She at least has a tangential connection to Maria through their relationship with Tsubasa
Your options are either adding her to TsubaMari or pairing her with Chris, who she literally never interacted with
Because everyone else is in neat, clean pairs
I want Kanade to kabedon me
Kiriland is now open for business!
Or if we're limiting ourselves to reality, black hair
Crazy anime colors are where it's at

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>smoking

right up my allet
Revy seems like
On the one hand
SO POWERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL!
I don't mind the shark teeth
but my ears bled every time she opened her fucking mouth
it wouldn't have been so awful if her voice didn't sound like nails on a blackboard
She was expressive in all the worst ways
just like the bunny suits
Meido is a played out fetish at this point
which are four character tropes I can't fucking stand
Garie was The Flirt, Meido, Granny Voice, and Cutesy Bitch rolled into one
she's acting like a dude thinks a "slut" acts like
Everyone goes off on the "She's a flirty empowered female character!" and it's just like no, she's not acting like that at all
I'm glad you said it and not me
and Ver is just a garbage character who exists as a joke
Cags was a bunch of tropes I dislike rolled into one character
Garie was literally every trope I dislike rolled into one character
so my taste is wildly different from the average Symphogear viewers'
I also hate Ver and Garie
but <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I did not like her at all
from the wedding dress opium event
yeah
they still brought his stupid fucking ass back in AXZ
They fucking didn't though
Might as well have animated Shirabe taking a dump on-screen
Budget horribly spent
Sad that instead of putting money and effort into her character, the writers instead blew their budget rehiring sugita to be a walking meme
She is sad

111 frames of cuteness realizing she's about to die in the actual anime

hold up lemme dig it up
for a character that literally had under 20 seconds of screen time, her amount of fanart literally tripled in one day
https://twitter.com/rx_HTS/status/1037715258423398401 make that three pieces of fanart
Holy shit, the *second* piece of fanart of Kanade's little sister
The fans barely remember she exists, I can't expect the XDU devs to remember her
showing them getting attacked by Noise
She appears (along with Kanade's parents) for ~15 seconds of animation
In the flashback showing how Fine acquired Senshou Jing

is it meant to be surgical scars from it being roughly stitched up or something?
like what happened did everyone get attacked by Zoro from One Piece
I'm always curious why anime scars are cross-shaped
you know
and Kanade is *usually* doing something involving food
and Maria is always derping around
Hibiki is always getting into trouble
I love the characters they have in this twitter

Maria might not be the oldest but she's not got the Onee-san personality Kanade does
they're all siblings
with the three gungnirs around maria is not the mom either
Maria is not the big sister
Maria is older
like a proper big sister
or trying to keep the other two from injuring themselves
Which I'm pretty sure is an alternate account for Kunyono?

I;m so torn on Igarashi's art style
I like figures but there will never ever be a real Kanade figure
Here's the original
Brisingamen
It's the attack name
gimme a sec
should have the original
It's one of the card arts from Sunflame Cremation in XDU

She's got 1cm more bust and 1cm more height but Maria has a somewhat more slender, feminine build than Kanade

Alright, I'm mostly being a meme anyways rahki. Take it easy!
She's got the length down
On second look it's actually quite a bit longer than my initial impression, but still
But the style and size are still well within "mundane" by anime standards
Weaponized hair is good
Give me outageous 'dos that would make a card game anime say "Take it easy!"

there was no reason to ditch it
No but my point is more her weapon was undamaged
and then they just... threw half of it away
Ember Celica was by *far* my favorite weapon design in the series
I wish she'd kept the other hand of Ember Celica
Her arm is cool but I really don't like that dinky built-in gun
ah yes
I doubt Oscar's gonna die
I could tell they were a reference but I didn't know what to
Oh that's what they were supposed to be?
also while the fight was good I still didn't like it very much because it was narratively pointless
I also haven't gotten my hands on the Vol 5 OST yet so I haven't listened to the studio version
but I'm a fan of that cheesey pop-punk/buttrock stuff
I actually really like the music
The only good fight in Vol 5 was Cinder vs. Raven
5 was *bad* though
Vol 6 has been better
the choreography got worse, but I'll take the trade for the non-action scenes looking decent
When they switched to Maya from Poser the animation got way better

I don't know if that's even what that's supposed to be but it reminded me of that
god I wish XDU had a little like... idle room like GFL has
and not exactly a wedding dress, but a pretty white dress nonetheless
She's not a popular "waifu" so...
Only have a couple
in my 3,853 pieces of Kanade fanart
I've got a couple
also yeah I saw that earlier, thanks <@!188714906143424513> ~
weeeeeeeeeeew
oh come on
fanfic thing
this was an illustration for some *insane* dA crossover
and last one, I promise
Oh yeah and this one
but those two are the most memorably bad
There are a couple others where it's kind of "Was this just heavily stylized or is it bad anatomy" that lean a bit towards the latter

Guts Kanade, I can dig it
but nobody draws that <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Kanade could rock nothing <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Kanade rocks anything
but Kanade *rocks it*
tbh I was never overly fond of thigh-highs

one of the oldest, and one of my all-time faves
Ah, aclassic, then
what kind of Kanade pic do you desire
as the pope of the church of Kanade it is my sacred duty to share any non-lewd Kanades with those who request to see her divine image

CC2 would be the cutest secondary character in Nep except for one thing
sharp

Their art is great
Or dudette idk
Oh fuck yeah this dude
Can someone post the Kanades

the only MMO I ever played was Tera and I stopped enjoying that when my friend quit
but still
maybe then
I should have a modern gaming laptop
in about a month
hopefully
and I don't really enjoy MMOs
My computer is a macbook that's going on 6 years old
I just collect any and all images of Kanade I find
I don't play PSO2

<@125353790537728001>
stay a while and listen
what's she from?
she's cute
Oh I've seen that girl before

she was cute as hell though
I didn't even look at the voice actors
Was she Nana?
Wait
sorry Shirrabe this is all taken direct form the show'\

>bikki x Kanade
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>

something I didn't expect to see
that's
well
and five for now
numbah 4
aaaaaaaand more
and more Kanade
instead let's have some Kanade
it was just a lame pun
and dom is just... dom
a "bear" is a large/slightly chubby/hairy(?) man in a gay relationship
I have gay friends

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA



Because I love her
idk the exact number since the files are stored on my external hard drive but it's somewhere in the vicinity of 12,500 imaged
I also have every unique frame of Kanade from the anime saved
discounting XDU screenshots and the handful of frames I have in that folder it's probably ~4500 images of Kanade
my Kanade folder has 4,886 items in it
it's more
oh
Not counting the individual frames of the anime I have saved I have like 3k
I only save Kanade images
they were in the same folder
with how I sort images

Especially the Germain one
Those alchemist ones are super cool
I've actually had that Kanade art for a while, had no idea it was Persona reference
Aww shit
Those are really cool though
"all"

I pick the one on the right
Chris fits in well with any of the other pairs though imo
Shota Stack
https://twitter.com/golden_nabe/status/1098600124245258240 lmao
she has legs but she also has a giant robotic snake tail
also that mecha inkling is cool
robo lamia yes please
looks like if Daft Punk were a Doctor Who villain of the week
something gonna get stretched
"I'm not a pillow!" those couple fanservice shots would disagree
"No no we talked about this - only when Lemo isn't home!"
that boy is made out of sheet steel
but Broly's chest would not be nearly that squishy
Okay, she'd be fondling the fuck out of Broly
and it's like the size of her torso
you know she's catching that saiyan dick
I mean the pose yeah but also the outfit
but idk if it actually is or not
it looks very gainax
her legs look like an MP Eva
the fuck robots show
is that from the uh
https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=manga&illust_id=73439175 there's some good Kanades in here and also some other good stuff
that might be pushing it for sfw
"Hey server girl, give me your meat buns."
"T-t-those aren't on the menu!"
"My sexy voice tells you they are."
Shauna
cannot remember her name
just with darker skin
She looks like Itaba from Symphogear
as is the dark-skinned Anime Ja Nai-chan ripoff
Calem and Serena are "French"
yeah
Kalos is Poke-France so
yeah
there was porn practically before the Direct ended

that's a fairly literal translation though so it reads kinda weird

Maria and Tsubasa: [post a facebook pic of their baby]
Chris: [emotional because her first love is forever lost]
Miku: "They can... *they can*"
Hibiki: [chills]
Tsubasa: "But don't you think that's a little too much? Borrowing a staff member's baby..."
Maria: "The joke will impact their heart strongly though~"

or "It's literally a lesbian romance"
like "it's clear that the girls like the girls but they will *never ever ever* actually say anything"
are we talking Yuru Yuri "rather blatant" or Sakura Trick "rather blatant"
is it just so her tits don't fall out?
why is the button so important
that's what I'm confused about
but the buttons
that's cute
also I feel like I'm missing a joke on the christmas tree thing
but mostly because there's a *lot* of KC porn out there
I feel like I'd recognize a few of the KC girls without their guns or stuff
I kinda guessed based on the fact that it mentioned a gun and had a picture of a cute girl
great
so that was a GFL thing

I like that design with the red color
https://twitter.com/_RegisterSIX/status/1110179936919130112
I wanna do this with Kanades now but the assets for this game are a fucking black box mystery lmao
keeping the red color scheme is better imo
It's a bit thick on the title/logo but on the Chris' I think it's okay
it's not too complicated and the glow/outline effects are subtle but are enough to give it a little pop
I think it looks good

Kanade with her pet/lover Hibiki and now with two of them because of edgebikki
It's always KanaHibi
she's a minor character in the detective/noir/vampire/whatever the fuck it is AU

it is
long hair coming out from under a hat/helmet/hood is 50000000% my aesthetic
so have this one instead
or it doesn't actually exist
which means it's either horribly mis-sorted
also I can't find the image I was looking for
"Answer: There is no reason" or something like that
The caption makes less sense lmao
I *think*
"I won! Until tomorrow, please think about why you lost."
another meido
and I cannot for the life of me find it
also I have a mental image of a Kanade
I just wanted to post meido Kanades
I actually like TsubaMari more than KanaBasa







I have no idea which one that id











so it's time for Kanades
I'm drinking
hey guess what
Kanade is strong
felt like a lot of the s1/2 material from what I remember
the first two movies were honestly good
Yeah Equestria Girls
there were at least 3
the human version
and... four spinoff movies?
a theatrical release movie
199 episodes
>ninth and final season
I think it's still going
it was in 5 or 6
it was definitely
I dropped off whenever it split
whichever season was a split season
I stuck on until the uh
first two seasons were genuine quality childrens' programming
but I agree
I watched it longer than I care to admit
It's basically just a better version of this princess celestia recolor
Gungnicorn
https://twitter.com/kunyono_gia/status/1119236268037029888 kunyono pls
like either Ruby is a rebound baby or...
there's some fuckery going on with them anyways
I think this is the one I was thinking of except I was imagining her with alcohol instead of just a little present
I found a couple other images involving alcohol but I ain't postin' 'em
I had a different mental image of Kanade holding a beer but this is the first one I found

Cute
Pics of you lol
Pixiv
I've spent the better part of the last three years scouring pics of you, Twitter, and every image dump site imaginable to find as many images as I can
Kerrik isn't wrong
I had beer for dinner, I apologize
5000*
almost 5000, not over 50000
I math'd wrong
wait no
wait
though there *might* be a few dupes in there
discounting the frame dump I have over 5k images at this point
and at this point I feel like I've exceeded the limit of dumping vs. spam so unless anyone specifically wants more I'mma stop
and/or XD fanart





have some fan gear designs
I love her
I love her smile

https://twitter.com/iitomyii/status/1121068721315803136
I don't know what this is from but I will grant her
That's just her being gaydere
It's just completely removing inhibitions and any sense of self-restraint or second thoughts
except with more murder
It's like how I spam pictures of Kanade when I get drunk
so when she gets drugged up to fuck and shoved into a Symphogear...
but *sane and capable of realize that actively murdering people about it is a bad idea*
fiercely in love with someone, to the point of it being a little bit creepy

I *did* just remember this though
It's actually kinda hard to find cat stuff because Kunyono and Jaga, who are the only two people who consistently draw her as animals, almost always draw her as either a dog or some sort of mythological creature
maybe not a kitten but
all Kanades are cute

Hibiki: "Wait what? What's gay?"

>Chris just slaps her across the face
"Mom, mom... we're... gay."
"Congratulations, you're the last to know."
"We're adopted?"
"Yes."
"Oh thank god, so that wasn't incest then."
"Wait wha-"
Tsubasa: "Maria, I've been wondering... how should we tell our kids they're adopted?"
Maria: "We're... we're both women, and only like six years older than them. I think-"
Tsubasa: "*Maria.*"
Maria: "Yo- [siiiiiiiiigh], fair enough."
Maria: "Then it will be an important lesson."
Shirabe: "She could *lose a hand*!"

I need to watch Black Lagoon
come hug me in winter I'm like a gofdddamane furnace
I am a warm person
I want to warm her up
more winter Kanades
but yes
not Kanaden
I kill her bosses and hope Kanaden-senpai notices me
and even then she's still good because she draws Kanade
as long as she isn't drawing fingers
Kanaden is great

holy fuck what happened in this channel
Apparently there's an actual episode of Detective Conan where she plays an idol and the whole joke is "Wow she can sing really well" when she's also Conan's VA and Conan can't sing for shit
There's a few others
I saw lol
because I kinda want to test a theory
is Akuma no Riddle any good
If your Bikky lasts more than four hours...
It's essentially the equivalent of a "free to a good home" box
writing means, among other things, "look after"
https://twitter.com/That_Drawer/status/1124293394291941376 yes ma'am
I can almost always pick out who's gonna be my favorite before watching the show because of certain character design cues and personality design cues that seem to pretty consistently get paired together
Like if you show me a shot of the cast of a show that's all/mostly female characters
It's actually kind of remarkable how consistent that kind of thing is
also I can tell from how their faces are drawn in fanart I like her personality more
I ain't seen this show but the other girl wins by virtue of her hair
I want her to torture my ~~dick~~ enemies, yes
or Tekken
I wish Ploot/Iris Heart was playable in 4GO
Uni has combos for days
Gunguni Sisters is adorable and I love it
"Hey Maria! Shirabe and I played the naked game like you and Tsubasa do and now my tummy is getting bigger!"
>Maria spits her tea all over Tsubasa
Oh the *scandal*!
And Shirabe is the mom!
Plot twist: *pregnant*
because it's chris and for fanartists it's not Chris art if she doesn't look like she doesn't want to be there
She's just flat out impossible without the exact right setup
because *hot damn*
https://i.imgur.com/RB9CnFF.jpg My Hero Academia's biggest failing was bringing this character in for one chapter and then basically forgetting she exists
babby bikki and Kana-nee
"danna" is also a *very* formal way to refer to the master of a household, AKA the husband
Kanade uses "da na" to end her sentences sometimes, which is basically a casual, feminine way to end a sentence
The joke at the end is a pun
She thinks baby!Chris is Genjuuro and normal Chris' baby because baby!Chris calls Gen Papa
"You're wrong! You're completely wrong, Tsubasa!"
Baby!Chris called Genjuuro Papa and Tsubasa's first thought is "What did you do to Chris"
https://twitter.com/LyukaArt/status/1127265970609897472 she cute
and someone says "Da na" to end their sentence and gen is like "Aw fuck"
so Genjuuro walks back in with baby supplies into a room full of women carrying babies

these are cute kiris
but these are tagged

I monitor the Amou Kanade tags
links
The pixiv
these aren't tagged right
hold up
which is gross
which gets dehumanizing *fast* unless kept in check
bordering on pet play
but it's way too like
I get that
but I'm in the minority in this server about that I guess

it is smell
Yes
Who could this beautiful woman be?
A fellow master of disguise appears!
the world will never know the true identity of this pink-haired, blue-eyed woman with blue butterfly clips in her hair
this is a flawless disguise
She's wearing glasses
*Maria is older than her*
that Kanade is the oldest one
that one daycare one always makes me chuckle

"As expected, you smell of *that woman*, Yukine Chris..." "... Miku?"

I've had that second one for years but never in this high quality


also that Riot guy doing sketches has done a couple Kanades

DMJii are cute
Nee-sama will also swoop in and just solve the situation but very much lord it over you/make sure you are 100% aware it was *your* fault, even if it wasn't
Nee-chan will just swoop in and solve the problem herself because she can't stand her poor sibling to get hurt
Nee-san will do her best to get you out, ideally by getting you to get *yourself* out
An Aneki will get you into shit but won't necessarily get you *out* of it if you're in over your head
Aneki is a little too gruff
"onee" is too distant and "-chan" is too close
Nee-san is the big sister that supports you and gets into shit with you but still wants you to be your own person
and not an "Onee" or a "-chan"
hence being a "Nee-san"
She's not the doting Onee-san
which can refer to an older sibling, an older person, the head of a clan or region, or a skilled craftsman
which is an archaic reading for the "older brother" kanji
There's also apparently "konokami"
that';s the more traditional
Yeah
ah
but I forgot about Ane/Aneki
idk about "old japanese"
all have slightly different personality traits that they get applied to
Nee-chan
Nee-san
Nee-sama
Onee-chan
Onee-san
Onee-sama
There's six variants of older sister
~~yes I know they're the same thing technically~~
Nee-sans don't
Onee-sans go "Ara ara"
Nah
Ultimate nee-san
It's really good
Shirabe: "This is the third time *this week* Maria has walked in with Kirika's dick inside me and hasn't noticed and has decided to cuddle"
you sure about that one

but green soda is melon soda which is really popular in japan
handwritten japanese can be hard to read but it looks like it says "shampan soda" aka champagne soda
the image is seconds from disaster
that's why it says "tries"

Not "sidegirl"

that's not meant to be a representation of Kanade
But point is he always looks like that
Is that it's own character who was included because they *look* like Kanade, or is that meant to be Kanade drawn as a wolf
that orange wolf up there with Tsubasa
Some card game has Tsuboysa as a protag
Fluffy Basa

yeah
it looks so cooooool
So thanks!
Yes but actually only because I *happened* to open Twitter on my phone

someone told me this was Revue
Someone told me it was Revue
Wait, I have a revue picture, I think
I do like the idea of the bridge bunnies hooking up out of desperation and having no one else to relate to, and then actually, slowly, falling in love
Also yeah it is a bit lather-rinse-repeat but it gets exhausting to have new stuff 24/7 in every manga, and of course the editors don't like that because they don't want a popular, money-making series to end
She still mostly writes messages instead of speaking but she does actually communicate *herself* now
Not much anymore at least
Not really
Whether or not you find them funny doesn't change whether or not they were *meant* to be funny

it's just perfect
which is why this particular one will *always* be one of my favorites, the hat, her hair, her smile

Long hair under a hat is just
Especially with hats
casual outfits are so good
also yes

>Kanade just immediately starts jilling off

yassssss
like I'm some part of stupid inside joke
okay for real though I love the wilhelm scream and it makes me smile every time I hear it
she, much like Ryoko, *has* to wax
Honestly if you look at Kanade's Gungnir
did someone say undergears
"I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THA-"
"Wow Miku I never thought I'd be in your box.*
>Chris sheepishly joins her
>Miku sitting off to the side in a box that says "only smart gay people get in this box"
>Hibiki, Kirika, and Shirabe dive in from a full sprint moments later
"Only gay idiots get in this box"
the Dark Oblivion dress was fantastic
At least one of those billions of locks has to be a dildo
these were designed by Ryoko "Sadomasochism is an important part of breakfast" Sakurai
and lets be honest
I imagine you'd have to be wary of the pointy bits
"You SAID you were wearing protection!"
"I was WEARING my SYMPHOGEAR!"
Shirabe: "Kirika, are you wearing protection?"
[Kirika holds up her Gear pendant"
Shirabe: "Perfect!"
>six months later
https://twitter.com/neiura/status/1152156221580836869
but a sexual harassment lawsuit is not one of them
Maria fears many things
That doesn't particularly sound like it would be
might be one of those things where the author had to make it more palatable until it was successful, and then write the story that they actually wanted
Also, it's from the 80s / 90s, which means they weren't pulling any punches
As far as I'm aware, it's a seinen about a group of mercenaries
I mean, I never got the impression that it was a happy show
I really need to get around to watching Black lagoon
There's a couple Kanades way tf up there I need to grab lol
$5 they have an episode where they all wear hats for some reason
Also seems like the kind of thing they're actually give her in the show
I'm pretty sure I've seen that art
And Yang
Baseball caps
Also yes
Holy fucking art dump today
I've listened to this song dozens, if not hundreds, of times, and only just realized the humor in the line "Motherfucker I'm the straightest shota"

IT WILL BE GOOD
IT IS GOOD
IT WAS GOOD
I SAW IT
those were a little much 😛
It's a lot but it's not the 200+ image dumps we used to get
cute!
It goes really hard on it but I love the effect
hold on, I've got another one that does the "purple in her hair" thing too
Yeah
They're all good but that one is one of my favorites
it really is





with this pulled direct from XDU
It's not colored but
I have a straight up official reference sheet
Yes

||It must have been in a PV then because that image was posted two weeks before XV started airing||
The image was made before XV started airing
It says XV but it's not actually XV content
hello imgur i am grate artiste



I'll just say my last piece then: Because when you see it coming and you know what it is, you go "Oh, I've already seen this" which makes it a spoiler regardless
"It's only a spoiler if you know it's a spoiler" is factually untrue though
If you want to argue semantics sure
Whether you know something is a spoiler or not doesn't make it not a spoiler
It literally wasn't
or not content from the new series
that doesn't make it not a spoiler
If it can't reasonably inform someome
And again
The server has a policy of "all XV content goes in XV channel or is spoilered appropriately" so
That doesn't make it not XV content
The gun is also her new XV revolver

Yeah might wanna put a spoiler tag on that

also Maria apparently having done her hair afterwards is cute too
I love the green and yellow ribbon in her hair after she puts it on
like this one
I love silly art that has the characters still incredibly distinct yet still feels the need to label them


I like the lil' Basa birb in this one

I didn't mean to kill Shirabe
sorry
oh shit

also because you made that, you can put it in Fanworks
also lol all the hair tips are round, good work 😛
I love the texturing of her hair
Oh that's beautiful!





it works but it does look kinda annoying

yes
Karate Kanade is cute af
random Airgetlamh Kanande in her B-Day stuff






I love all Kanades
If you've drawn anything for Kanade, even rough sketches, please post
also yeah I've heard *several* artists complain about her hair being a pain in the ass to draw
~~this is one of the bad ones though~~
While she gets comparatively less art, there's very little truly *bad* Kanade art imo
I feel glad
There's a lot of really good art of her
Everything about it is so good
Like 5-6 years old but still honestly one of the best pieces of art and one of my favorites
That's old but gold
do not
Naturally she still has fans
With a character design that flawless and being the perfect onee-san
hooooooohly fuhk

"Maria onee-san, Maria onee-san! Kanade is so wonderful! She taught me so many useful words in the afterlife, like 'fuck' and 'shit'! I learned so much useful, uh... shit! from her!"
[Kanade promptly sent back to the grave]
"Get on losers, we're going Christmasing"
Kanade would 100% own a fucking-reindeer "ugly" Xmas sweater
Yes, those deer are absolutely fucking
also sorry for the ping
<@!182683872062865408> This one's still one of my faves, thank you for drawing it
this was drawn by someone in the server
"How about a deal, Maria - I'll change if you take it off me."
[Kanade, muffled, in the distance] "Worth"
"And just like that, you're crawling home."
[Maria promptly drops Kanade on her face]
"How am *I* the responsible one?"
"Because you're like my mom!"
"Shut up Tsubasa I already know you call her 'mommy'."

also damn that's a good one kerrik
Yeah
get in the summer spirit
There's not a lot of art of her in her Swimphogear out there
don't be like me
don't forgo rest for Kanade
Please sleep

Let's ignore that Hibiki never rode a bike, so it's not a fair comparison
That's right, 0
How many bikes has Hibiki crashed?
3, 4?
How many bikes has Tsubasa crashed?
I mean
Get in losers, we're going singing

I got the message that when you try and fail, there's no reason to try
She got the lesson that when you try and fail, you can rely on your friends
Maria and I just got different lessons out of it
No matter how hard I try at certain things, I still fuck up, and I still fail
I can relate to her
I think that's why I like her so much
And the script conspires against her
Maria is a good girl who tries her hardest
Shirabe
Here's a little lesson in trickery motherfukers
She Robbie
She's so cute, and she deserve so much love, and so does she Robbie
I want to pick up kirika and hug her

The Jackal fires the same caliber as a deagle but also uses weird (fictional) up-jumped cartridges that feature much more powder
Also, despite being an overall significantly bigger firearm, the Cassull fires smaller bullets than a deagle (though with a shitload more powder, so much, much faster)
but they do kinda look like it
Alucard's Hellsing Arms 'Joseph' Cassull and 'Jackal' Anti-Armor pistol are *dramatically* larger than a deagle

I don't remember Walter's eye getting damaged like that
The only thing I can imagine is the young Walter vs. Lolicard fight at the end of Hellsing Ultimate but idk if that's it
I don't think so
https://twitter.com/tv3838stc/status/1158753443034517505 also Shirabe straight-up not having a good time, bro

I'm not sure you and I were thinking of the same thing

I've got something for this
wait

Maraia Careydenzavna Eve
Maraia
I do appreciate some nice Kanade tiddy though
You can't bribe a man with that which he already has!
He just draws weird shit sometimes
It's Kokonag
I need to get one commissioned at some point yeah
tfw no Kanade pillow
I assume so, since they were sold for last year's birthdays
She dressed for the "slide" and not for the ride
https://i.imgur.com/EQZPUMr.png full up 80s Japan female biker gang Kanade
but I'd almost prefer like
Sexy riding leathers would be good
God I'd fucking kill for a Biker Kanade
XV is taking place in Jan "2018" though
so either 22 or 23
~~the XDU timeline doesn't add up with the canon timeline at this point tho~~
dess_.. timeline
As of current
yeah Kunyono's art is really great when he's not drawing weird shit



I got a thing for that
wait
wait
Tsubasa: "Fuck you you're not my real dad!"
Yatsuhiro: "Look Tsubasa I love you but even my resources aren't infinite, this is the seventeenth tricycle this week, I can't keep replacing these"
"I'm here to sing songs and drink juice boxes, and my juice box is almost empty."
Mammarias
I mean, this is Gunguni Sisters, where they're all meant to be toddlers
https://twitter.com/gunguni_sisters/status/1159072893575188481
That's just five Hibikis and ***thorsty*** Miku
https://i.imgur.com/sxGDU3z.jpg I want a recreation/sequel to this one with the new 5v5 and duplicate gears
Also that Ignite Gungnir Mara is bitchin
"Oh and DMJii are here too"
"Ah yes, my two beautiful babies"
Maria
but it works pretty well
idk *how*
It detects visually, not based on filename
Yes
especially for S1E1 which I literally just told ffmpeg to turn every frame into a .bmp
Thousands upon thousands of dupes
This reminds me of when I did the Kanade frame dump lol
o-oh
if you leave it lower it gets a bit iffy
You may also want to set the dupe finder thing to the strictest or second-strictest setting
It's also kinda useful for tracking down images that are in the wrong folder if you have a dupe in the right folder
I use it to clean up my Kanade folders
Yeah
It works really well
It's a program that detects visually-similar images
You should use VisiPics
does anyone have the Cat on the Dog! Why is That? image
speaking of catbasa
I was looking for a colored image
yeah
that one
OH
<@!193408538909868033> is this the one you were talking abo
I got this one of Kanade falling onto Basa
idk about falling into her *hair*
or it's post-XV
So either the XDU event is Maria's 22nd B-day during AXZ
Germain: "Look, Adam, would you just use that legendary Hat weapon you have? Just this once? Or even that familiar we let you keep even though you're not classed for it?"
Adam: "I. Cast. Fireball."
Adam is that one DnD player who casts Fireball in every combat just because he can
Might also just be a commentary on how it's been fucking hot in Japan again
IDK why they're in their bathrobes though, some shit must have gone down in the XDU event
I mean they killed a lot of people so probably
"Everything is fine"
and most of the rest seemed to be from having gone on Pixiv and downloaded higher-res versions of twitter art I already had
of those 39, 4 were not actually dupes
So basically not on Apple
If you can access the device's filesystem then you can use it
if you plug your phone into your PC yes
https://i.imgur.com/aZbyMaN.png
I frequently go back and look at my favorite images
I haven't added in the new stuff I picked up on her birthday yet so I think there's probably a few dupes that got reposted in there
I'm running my Kanade folder
sorting through the literal *tens of thousands* of frames from S1E1 alone would have been nightmarish without it
I'm really glad one of my friends knew about this
np
http://www.visipics.info/index.php?title=Main_Page
"Alright any interesting new art today?" 
>350+ new messages since 15 minutes ago
It's not exactly an official rule but it's a bit of a gentlemen's agreement after certain users had a tendency to drop hundreds of images at a time, which made it very difficult to appreciate/talk about/even look at the art
not just dumping an entire folder
In *general* these channels are meant to be used for art you want people to see
you've been posting images for at least an hour and a half
I appreciate your enthusiasm for art but this is going a bit beyond a dump and is leaning into the spam category
Based on the birbball
Volleybikki
That's a nice Kanabooty
Oh shit
Braids are good civ
All the better to pummel you with (love)!
Like a 80s chibi
They look so soft there
I'll get that one when I get home then
Nice
Did you get it on Pixiv?
Where's it from?
Oh shit I don't recognize that one
I didn't see any new Kanades
Where?
Shirabe is dead, you're next
- Alcanoise Moth
A lot of people apparently, judging from the number of galleries I've found that do that
Like an image of Kanade and Tsubasa being tagged "KanaTsuba" but not being tagged for either of the individual characters
Forget improperly tagging the series, the one that really gets under my skin is improperly tagging characters
Shirabe: "On my god Kiri whatever you do *don't stop*"
Kiri: [literally isn't even touching Shirabe] "...  yes"
Kiri would 100% do it on purpose
Shirabe: "Kiri please stop moving you're just making it worse"
Kirika: "But if I keep wiggling eventually I'll come free!
Shirabe: "*If you keep wiggling I'm going to come*"
Kirika: [wiggles more]
Kirika: "Let's be honest, this is not the most embarrassing situation you've caught us in"
Shirabe: "At least it wasn't your fault this time"
"MARIA HELP IT HAPPENED AGAIN"
Specifically Maria's mouth and eyes, her overall expression
(that *is* Chinese, right?)
Their Story
The Chinese lesbians
That art style reminds me of... what is it
The sequel 
"They're right here!"
[spins Tsubasa around and pulls her into her cleavage]
I came up with that
"Hey Tsubasa where yo tiddies at"
"FFS Maria"
AAA that Sungnir trio pic is really cute!
Like "Akatsuki" but using 赤月
Knowing Kirika she'd want to make some chuuni name
Serenade Kazanari Eve and her best friends... Fuck, making Japanese names is really hard lmao
It would be conjugated "naki___"
Naku is "cry"
Yeah looks like a pun
Magic lesbian singing babies
Serenade Kazanari Eve, Age 5: "Mommies, where did I come from?"
Tsubasa: "Well love day we had this really passionate duet, and the lyrics were just... right, you know?"
Maria: "So we sang without protection."
Tsubasa: "And nine months later..."
Maria: "Our perfect little song was born!"
I'm pretty sure it's a parody and not an actual series though
Source is in the title lmao
https://youtu.be/NdOpvPCgVBo found it!
The one where the guy has literal waifu armor
Someone post the waifu henshin thing
They were just doing what felt good for each other and found out later what it was
They didn't realize it was *sex* is what I was getting at
No I mean like
They got quite the scolding from Miku
100% the first time they fucked they didn't know what they were doing, they were just kissing and hormones and atmosphere got the better of them
"Miku I'm 16 I'm not ready to be a mom!"
"Then you should have used protection!"
"I was wearing my Symphogear!"
Shirabe: "Oh look, Mommy's so happy again!"
Maria: "Yeah, and your other Mommy is gonna get some tonight!"
Kirika: "Some what?"
Tsubasa: "ohmygodMariapleasestoptalking"
Maria: "SOME FU-"
Tsubasa: "OKAY THAT'S ENOUGH ALCOHOL PARTY IS OVER KIRIKA SHIRABE GO TO BED"
DMJii: "Aww, but funny Mommy is so snuggly!"
Maria: "Yes, Tsubasa. *Snuggly.*"
Tsubasa: "Okay, Maria, you go to bed too."
Maria: "Aww..."
Tsubasa: "I'll join you in a minute."
Maria: "Yusssss"
~~the question is did she let them drink~~
That's cute
Aww, look how her daughters are snuggled up against her
Alright
Like is it plot stuff or just outfits
How spoilers are these if I haven't seen the lastest episode
DA DA DADADADA DA DA DAAA DA AFRO DA DAA DADADADA DA DAA CIRCUS AFRO CIRCUS AFRO POLKA DOT POLKA DOT POLKA DOT AFRO
~~Also baby Miku would have to deal with the fact that her mom calls her name when she has sex~~
Imagine how confusing it would be for Hibiki to be calling to two different Mikus all the time
She also shoots down the follow-up suggestion of the second most important thing, Miku
Miku shoots that down
Gohan
And Hibiki would just want to name her child after the thing she cares about most in the world
Part of Shirabe's name and "aka" which means red but is also used for babies
The slightly-longer hair works really well on her
Cute dess
Edge with no justification is some of the most boring literature imaginable
I hate edgy bullshit like that
And Kanade actively hordes Hibikis since she "owns" XDU's "Gray" Hibiki as well
Also tbh my problem with KanaHibi - especially in Jaga's AU - is that it breaks up HibiMiku, and particularly with what Jaga draws, Kanade is super possessive and is actively preventing Hibiki from being with Miku despite evidence that Hibiki would prefer to be with Miku than Kanade
I don't like smoking either
I don't like KanaHibi at all
I don't like it
I'm really conflicted because two of the artists who regularly draw Kanade draw weird shit
Kanade is a vampire/hunter, Hibiki is a werewolf, everyone chainsmokes, Hibiki is Kanade's pet but also they fuck, it's really weird
Jaga has this weird detective noir AU but like
Ayy
That's a hot Kanade tho
Oh shit, finally adding Chris to the chain-smoker-detective-vampire-noir-werewolf AU?
At this point I may as well open up the XV discussion channel with how people have been posting unmarked spoilers in other channels
Spoilers m8
I am simultaneously both parties in that Our Innocent Love manga
I want to give Kanade a massage
This image is straight up pornography
Holy shit
Backs
I do not have one
Sadly
I mean in Japanese culture for a long time the nape of the neck was considered the most alluring part of a woman's body, hence the design of kimonos
I mean everything about her is perfect but I'm not some Victorian era man-harlot
Ankle wtf
Smile
Her ankle is perfection
Yeah the New Gear's outfit is probably my favorite new outfit XDU gave her
Can you blame her?
Really
Which
She saw New Gear's Kanade

The manga implies that she knew it was an issue but didn't necessarily do anything about it
Big Bada Boom
Father Genjuuro works for the Catholic Church
No, Papa Genjuuro
And the gears think he's done something untoward with Chris lmao
Put-upon single father Genjuuro is fun
Kanade: "Hey Genjuuro, my hair's getting kind of long, can I get a haircut?"
Gen: "Due to budget constraints, we can't afford an actual salon. So uh... I could cut your hair?"
Kanade: "With what, your fists?"
Gen: "I could try?"
Ryoko: "Oh please, she's a *lady*, Genjuuro. She needs an actual cut. Where's Tsubasa? Let's use Ame no Habakiri."
Kanade: "Gen please punch my hair shorter."
I really don't
Is called Ame no Habakiri
Tsubasa's gear
"Alright, now Kanade, stand very, very still."
"I dunno Tsubasa, this seems kinda dangero-"
"HEAVEN'S WRATH!"
"TSUBASA NO-"
Maybe they have to cut it using Ame no Habakiri
It can be tamed... somehow

60% floof by volume
Sadly, the fact that it was styled approximately the same way and approximately the same length since she was a little girl implies that she does actually intentionally keep it like that
I like to imagine that the reason her hair was so long was just because she didn't want to have it cut
Serena about to commit a war crime
Which uh
It is a thing, but for a long time there was this weird gatekeeping sect of waifu culture that basically said "If you want to fuck her your love isn't real"
If anything it shows that your love is stronger
I resent the implication that having sexual interest in your wife who somehow makes you love for her less pure
She is the ultimate pillow
And her Kanades
And legs
And stomach
And back
On Kanade's hair
Rest my head
Can I just



I'll post a couple more cool Kanades and then go to sleep
Sorry I'm getting into lonelyposting hours again
I just want to hold her and be held by her
Soft and fluffy and warm not just physically but emotionally
After a stressful day you could just hug her and feel so much better
I bet Kanade would just be the snughliest ever
I still think one of the greatest jokes I ever made was someone asking me what the opposite of a succubus was and me saying "Fuccubus"
Every day
Some days?

Okay drive is just being a dick now
Testing
Can't preview images on mobile drive file picker
Okay it didn't
IDK if that one actually had thigh-highs
Yeah I have no idea what that sword one is supposed to be but I like it

Not exactly thigh-highs but a thigh band

Also *why* do you want these
The Android Discord Google Drive file picker is not excellent
Lemme see what I got
You want socks, boots, what?
As specifically opposed to the thigh-high armored boots she wears in Gungnir?
You already do a great job on her hair!
This is the one I came in on here looking for it first. It's an old one, one of the first images that I saved, but it's so good. The detail put into the shading, the way her hair fluffs up in the back, the detail on her gear and her spear oh, it's so good, I had this as my wallpaper for a long time, and I think it might still be the wallpaper on my PS4. This image is so, so good. From the tip of her winged hair to the soft, confident smile on her face, to the shape of her breasts, to the shading on her stomach and the detail on her Armed Gear. This image here might be the perfect Kanade fanart.
This one is called "Kanade Happy" but honestly it looks like she just made a really shitty pun and she's waiting for someone to catch on
This wasn't the image I went looking for, but I love her smile so much
I thirst for all of Kanade
Full of essential vitamins, minerals, and Gungnirlytes
Kanadade
On Kanade
I am hydrated
Good thing I'm drinking
She's so super perfect
Tux Kanade can pin me down and fuck my ass any day of the week


I prefer Butler
I actually don't care for meido that much tbh
Did someone say meido
For *completely nonsexual cuddles*
Sometimes Chris joins them
Between Maria's thighs
Tsubasa is the one sleeping thight
Sleep thight
Thanks!
Jabba the Hutt would look good in a suit
In a well-fitting suit, at least
Literally anyone looks good in a suit
I love you, my precious and perfect Valkyrie
Thanks nin
Oldie but a Goldie!
You find a girl and you think she's like 6'8" and towering above you and then she takes off her shoes and she's Samwise Gamgee's little sister
Platform heels are the work of the devil
This is good <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
These girls are like 70% leg and a solid 40% thigh by volume
Who taught Nepgear how to Zesshou
https://i.imgur.com/7qPI4uT.jpg
Cute Chris!
No one wants to hear me sing
If they're half decent at least lmao
Kanade or not, listening to the person you love singing
I think that would be nice
At least we know she can sing phenomenally though
I don't know if she'd be any good at the guitar but I'd love to hear her sing
If it were Kanade playing it I'd listen to Wonderwall on repeat
No one said Vivio was Carol 2
"beta" implies a demo/test or "in development" version
http://imgur.com/gallery/W2s8wk8 whole gallery
Like Kanade with the body of Daidouji
Rany u should draw jacked Kanade
The second one was posted during her birthday this year, and she really is just the perfect angel isn't she
Oh I think that first one is new
Like she's not quite Nehushtan levels of "how are you still decent" but like, god damn
Kanade's Gungnir is cut *crazy* low though, in the front
I would have loved to see how her Gungnir would have evolved over the seasons ~~and I'm still mad XDU only uses her vanilla S1 design and Brisingamen~~
Like the white bits are kinda halfway between armor and undergear
And that one even removes some of the other parts
Kanade's gear is mostly undergear anyways tbh
There we go!
I know I have a Kanade one but I can't find it
Need more bodypaint undergears <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
It's so lifeless
Shit from the early 2000s was *bad* unless it had vast amount of budget or effort put in
Early digital anime
Like seriously sucked
But you know what sucked
I don't necessarily think either is better or worse, but there is a pretty distinct difference in style
There's this weird balance between how characters were typically designed when art was mostly traditional, compared to how it is now
He's not her father, but he's her dad
He's her dad
It's very 90s anime
I like Tsubasa's face in that one with her dad
Thank you for the ping :)
It's very good!
Pirate Captain Kanade!
||I really wish I didn't know what you were talking about||
So fluffy
I love it
That Yankee Squat in the second one
Ichaival looks surprisingly good in yellow
Cute!
"Alright so tonight I'll sleep with DMJii, tomorrow with Hibiki and Miku, and then Tsubasa and Maria wanted to go on a trip this weekend so..."
Chris literally sleeps around
Everybody x Chris
Chris works really well with any of the established pairs tbh
That's a trio I really like
Or TsubaMariKuri
Drei Wing is good but I prefer just TsubaMari tbh
Because it splits up ships I like more, or it's literal "pair the spares" Serenade
I don't really like most Kanade pairings tbh
Eh
I'd prefer solo though
Like there were some het Kanade lewds on Twitter not too long ago but like... they're the best-drawn non-Serenade lewds she has?
Yeah
But when it's just shitty MS paint rape it's like
I don't even mind dudes once in a while if it's at least decent art
But like
I keep the filter off because I save everything
But I still don't like it
Feeling like that over a fictional character
Which is really sad, I know
But I really don't like the idea of other people masturbating to her
On the one hand I appreciate more art of her, especially if it's good quality
Which as I've said before, I've always been kinda split on Kanade lewds
Yeah
CM3D2 has one purpose
I like people creating more art and images of Kanade but like
I'm really torn about the fact that they exist
Pretty!
I love how happy she looks
It's so good though
And either way, I was talking about the system of being able to add specific, detailed tags
There's also things like e621, derpibooru, and other more focused, independent sites as well that operate with the same idea
There's a lot more than one site
And again
You should have phrased that better then
Especially considering there's a lot more than one booru
That's not really a reason to blanket shit on the system
As well as sorting through images of specific characters or franchises based on things like poses, outfits, and other things
That's still an issue with the tags themselves, not the system behind it - and when things are tagged properly it makes not only finding them, but finding related content, much easier
The actual tags are only as good as the people assigning them
The system is good
That's not an issue with the system, that's an issue with the tags themselves
What? Why?
A tagging system like a booru has
What I really need is like
Great
Or did the artist give it some dumbass "KanaKana" ship tag instead of using her name
Is it tagged properly
Okay
*is it on
is on on Pixiv?
IT ALSO RUINS MY SORTING SYSTEM
That's new I think
Oh shit
Yeah I like that artist's style a lot

yes yes

Bottom: How Hibiki looks to Chris
Top: How Hibiki looks to Miku
Either that or Discord is just shit and loads post content *before* it checks whether it's spoilered or not
it *was* spoilered, just not when it was posted
At the very least it might be good to keep the art to the actual XV channel until after the YameteTomete release is out, since I *know* I'm not the only person who waits for that release

Holy shit she looks so good in a suit
that's a stylish goddamn Tsubasa

Kanade would be a Gryffindor

KUNYONO IS DRAWING WEIRD SHIT AGAAAAAAAAAIN
MAAAAAAAAA
https://twitter.com/kunyono_gia/status/1166314568496250886
Speaking of dragon Kanade
suppose I walked into that one
I
My god, Hibiki's hands must be *enormous*
They can hold more?
Maria: "WTF am I doing here"
Serena: "GO ONEE-CHAN!"
https://twitter.com/kokonag222/status/1166362717785067520 Super Maria Sisters!
also because me paying for shit online is iffy sometimes, please for the love of god *don't start working* until I can confirm I can pay for it
feel free to dm me
hood
also for your consideration:
hedphon
What's that I hear? An excuse to repost one of my all-time favorites?
*yes*
No I just thought I'd like to see Kanade blowing a bubble of bubblegum
~~please take no offense in the fact that you are not the person I would ask to do that~~
I thought of something I want to see and I think I would pay money for it
oh Rany would you consider taking money for artwork
but it's beautiful and I love it
It's painful
I love it
"Just remember, when you are low and you need help, you can always find it in your friends, and if you look... toward the sky."
"It'll be hard, harder than you think you can deal with, but it's what she would want. And, even more than that, it's what *you* want, even when you think you don't."
"One day, after more pain than you think you can bear, you will spread your wings. Keep the song in your heart alive and everything will be okay."
And then Kirika throws a spider at Maria
Chris
That's
Less if someone else wants to intentionally tie her up
17 seconds to accidentally tie herself up
Here, how about this
Do you think that's being a bit generous?
I give her 17 seconds before she's tied up in it
Oh shit that's handsome as fuck
https://twitter.com/lanlanlap/status/1166688712823959552 and the reply tweet
I love Shimikuma's drawings
It was how much she loved being there
that wasn't scripted
There was a love, an energy in it
The beauty in how she danced
And it really showed
She loved singing
is posting Kanades
what I really love
But for now
God I fucking wish
well yes
I said what, not who
No
You know what I love
So yes, most likely it won't happen or it will
"It won't happen or it will" literally covers all possible eventualities
I mean

Thanks for the pings!
hence DMJii
G = Jii

so badly
I just want to hold her

I
Just getting drunk and passing out intertwined
Not even sexual
Going out drinking with Kanade and waking up the next morning tangled up in each other!
I would never want to forget it no matter what
With everyone who sang with her
And how much she wanted to share that joy
*don't*
https://twitter.com/_3sumi_/status/1095989175348690945 BEDHEAD KANADE
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT
EVERYBODY
I love the Kanadaycare memes
Chris in the back hiding behind Tsubasa is great
https://twitter.com/mmmy_poko3/status/1167139070054502400
yessss
thanks, shirabe
ayy!
if you don't mind I'm gonna repost it to see if Shirabe turns up a source
That XD Kanade is beautiful!!!
Also yeah Millhi I saw that, and tbh as much as I want it even if I could have gotten it I would have had no way to get it home
~~that sounds like a health code violation~~
Oh
I'm pretty sure I watched G soon enough after it finished airing that I got the TV version which didn't have the Fine eyes for Kiri
HEYO
God that's unsettling
https://twitter.com/jaga_mohu/status/1167439010085523458 Relic Cancer Kanade got finished
Incompatible with having straight character-swaps that is
unless somehow Fine is *Hibiki*
Yeah Fine having Ichaival and Hibiki having Chris!Nehushtan are kinda incompatible

sort of, at least for Tsubasa and Kanade
There's also this for alt hair styles
Hair colors are the same tho
Bikki and Basa swapped and Kanade and Chris swapped
Here's Bikki with Tsubasa's hair

"Look Kiri, Mom is tring to look young again! It's not working."
That one I do have
and tbh what they draw is more just furry than monmusu
Or much in the way of MonMusu Kanade apart from the stuff Kunyono and Jaga draw
I actually don't think I have any Spider Kanades
That's reaaaaaaally good
Ah yes that one
Spider Kanade
I'd love to see what you come up with
>does KanadeAnon still want new Kanades
I'm certain there's some I don't have
but yes, when you have your folders fully sorted I'd love to cross-compare
evidently I *do* have this one already
Oh
>download name: 69504983_p2 (1)
Oh you can only add up to 10 tags
*it's not tagged*
Oh hey
Oh hey that's new
Make Kanade harem king of me
I'll take everything with a Kanade label on it
lol
It's so good

Gears that look like Noise/have Noise powers
would make for a unique unit aesthetic at least
Noise Geahs
That would make a fun XDU event actually
but with a horde of Kanades
I want them to do that for Tsubasa
I have concerns for what Miku is gonna do to bab bikki
I wrote about that once
Maria, practically choking on her own spit after coming like eight times in a row from Tsubasa and Kanade taking turns: "bbblgghrlglglgllll"
Kanade either takes Maria from behind or gives it to Tsubasa when she thinks she's safe
Tsubasa gets the front
https://i.imgur.com/VzeZJ5x.jpg Mariacat fears the tomato
Wiki
That's a *lot* of loosening lmao
Kanade: 169/95/62/92
Tsubasa: 167/81/57/83
so let's compare
Oh, there are several new ones in this pixiv post
*can fit Kanade without fucking exploding*
as to why a dress tailored for Tsubasa
I have so many questions
Honestly
https://twitter.com/zatsu_kun/status/1167448158839832576
Yeah
Either way I don't think I saw them giving the eyes to Shirabe
**F**ine **I**s **S**hirabe
Duh
Right

I thought you were showing that off saying you'd finished sorting lol
I thought you were showing this off to what the fuck
I'm going to bed
Oh
I assumed it was meant to be an OOO thing
Oh
OOO
Her belt says Batta
Bata?
TORA
TAKA
They're from the same place Shirabe, it's okay


basically she's just being Chris
"You all don't really have to stare... it's embarrassing... you know..."

cool scissors
half a dozen episodes behind on Dumbbell
I'm like
Oh right

A lot more than two
T-two Kanades!
I love the effect around her visor
That's cool
~~tfw will never wake up hungover with Kanade and just lay in bed being miserable together for a couple hours before actually forcing ourselves to get up and do things~~
Good thing to wake up to with a hangover
Lots of new Kanades in here!
thanks though!
Ikxi sent it
I'm assuming it was someone failing to tag old Kanade art that got bundled in with a Pixiv post that *also* contains XV art
since based on the *other* ping I got which was "untagged Kanades here, too"
Can I request that whatever I got pinged for in <#601872369660854272> be posted here, provided it isn't actually spoilers



There's a couple Kanades
very poor choice of words
>they're gonna be fine

You know what other Kanade is really really good
~~even works on the level of Hibiki repeatedly getting hospitalized due to work-related injuries~~
Starring Kanade 'Clarkson' Amou, Hibiki 'Hammond' Tachibana, and Maria 'May' Cadenzavna Eve
Top Gungnir
This one made me think of something - Top Gear, but with... Gears
Hisashi too good
God that's a beautiful stomach right there
I figured as much
Also whoever pinged me in <#601872369660854272>, I haven't seen the episode yet
Oh, yay! I love waking up to new Kanades!
that last panel is just moaning, each others' names, and some onomatopoeia
but
The first line might be better translated as "you can't"
It's pretty close
Maria: "W-we can't!"
Tsubasa: "Come on, Maria, it's alright, isn't it?"
Maria: "Wha- Tsubasa!"
Tsubasa: "I'm sorry, Maria, this is the limit!"
Both: [sex sounds]
Exactly what it looks like
very cute indeed!
Something to do with thinking it was funny
Or the history of their overzealous edits shitting themselves when not used on exactly the right video players
or intentionally mistranslating things because "it sounds better"
or intentionally withholding complete subs to spite fans
better dead than SGr-01 HEAVENREND
Yeah but I don't do Commie
YTT subs are still MIA
But I don't know about others lol
I know you won't
No, no, it's fine!
She shares a voice actress with Dark Pit so... Uh...
Very cute Micha!
Thanks for the ping, Kerrik! Glad someone's watching Twitter for new Kanades when I can't
Meanwhile I struggle to look good in a tailored suit
Yes it does <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
she looks cute in pretty much anything tho
Maria looks cute in that dress
daki first
but
Gonna have to
Yeah
I really wish for a Kanade plushie
😛
I'll just not read the comment then
if it's general XV stuff like the one from last week then that's fine
If it's specifically relevant to episode 9 then don't send it to me
I didn't actually see the image
if you want to DM it to me I'll be glad to see it, as long as it's not episode 9 spoilers
I still haven't seen the episode so I still have that channel muted







Let me grab a few
Sure!
from the XDU XV 10 preview comic
cute
sure
I need to make a separate folder for "as an animal" with the amount of dogs/gryphons/dragons/chickens Kanade gets drawn as
Yeah, I recognized the outfit
Like a grunt of exertion
UNF
are
Hipless pants
also holy fuck that last girl
Thanks <@!237964037898502144> and <@!263983345669505025>! Got a couple art-holic angels looking out for me on Twitter
In all my life I've only ever found *one* pair of comfortable jeans
I have always hated jeans
If I'm just putting something on to go do whatever, I won't choose to wear one, but if someone says "Wear a suit" I wouldn't even blink
then I wore one five days a week for two years
I used to think that
https://i.imgur.com/1A9fz8W.jpg
That's a stacked Leiur
Cute Kanabab!
sorry, the last one is a unit called Deimos Witch in XDU
Yeah
also I gotta say I looooooove the hybrid "Ponytail and hair down" style Deimos Witch uses
Either I overloaded you or you're just not finding these images because they don't exist
Hush Shirabe, it's okay






and also somewhat educational?
It's a lot of cute fun
The fucking platelets were some of the cutest things I've seen in recent years

I've already seen it but I appreciate the ping <@263983345669505025> ! Thanks!
whether it's on purpose or not
Every now and then someone just draws them too damn big
There's a couple random images of Kanade with significantly oversized Kanades, too
and I *do* have the other art from this artist
Actually tagged properly, but very old
Because Jaga's a furry
danke
that dragon got tiddies
"What's wrong? I used to do this with Kanade all the time. Come on, let's do it after you finish the one with Elfnein."
The "main" Serena and Kanade in XDU are also from alternate universes, but they're also the only ones
There's AU Tsubasa, Hibiki, Miku, Genjuuro, Ogawa, and Fine
With Kanade as the "bad influence" and Serena playing the innocent card when they get in trouble, but really having known exactly what she was doing the whole time
I like them more as the friends that get along way too well, and should never be left unsupervised with anything you care about
But I prefer it to most other Kanade ships at least
I'm not a huge fan tbh
It's "pair the spares" taken to it's illogical extreme
that was really cute
There was that one art of Chris and Serena sliding around though
So changing her character design would have been just completely diverging from any canon origins Serena would have had
She like... didn't actually have any sort of *actual* personality?
which arguably would have been entirely an OC at that point since basically the only "Serena" we had by her XDU introduction was her character design
The problem is they would have to have given her a new design
So because they didn't have the medical tech to save her at the time, they dumped her in cryo until they could fix her
In the AU, Maria did that and died, and Serena was gravely injured in the process
So you know in the main universe how Serena Zesshou'd and killed herself and fucked up the Nephilim
Cryo-freezing
Physically 13, chronologically 21
13
13 I think
~~I mean 'canon' XDU serena is imouto supreme who would get along with literally anyone because there's not a drop of willpower in her body~~
A little something like this
Tsubasa: "Alright, I might know someone who can deal with her. Someone so wholly powerful and terrifying that no one else can even come close to stopping her."
Maria: "... who?"
[next day]
Kanade: "So you want me to *what*?"
There *was*
I'm going on XDU basis
In her own universe
I don't think it's official
In my head they do
[later, at home]
Tsubasa: "Well, Maria, Serena certainly was... nice."
Maria: "Oh my god, Tsubasa, I'm gonna level with you 100%: She absolutely terrifies me and I have no idea how to deal with her. She's been like this as long as I remember and as much as we love each other I'm a little scared every time I see her."
Tsubasa: "Okay, glad that wasn't just me then."
"Hello everyone! This is Serena, my precious little sister!"
"Oi I'll fuk u up cunt, sware on me mum!"
"Isn't she just lovely?"
Extra double bonus points for "Maria is completely blind to it/willfully ignorant of it"
I still love the "Serena the gremlin" headcanon/fanon
Tsubasa is staring at Hibiki and for just a moment she sees Kanade
And that other one is so sad
but I appreciate the ping!
that's an oooold one
https://twitter.com/isiyumi/status/1171424870627831808 also Allenbae
this time featuring fluffy
https://twitter.com/getuyoubi5/status/1171028131844513792 more dragon tidd
I'll fill all your comm slots
but it's similar
It's not quite the mechanic outfit
It's so good!
Right?
It's so goooooooooooood
Look how her hair flows from under her hat and comes out around and behind her!
Look at this amazing art <@!247701824335904770> is drawing for me!!!
and it's not twitter but!!!
https://twitter.com/cababako/status/1171434359116558337 I can finally get back on Twitter and the first image I'm greeted with is this
1. Main Timeline (same canon as show with deviations for the XD Quest)
2. Kanadeverse (Tsubasa died at the concert, Kanade is only known Gear user)
3. Gray Hibikiverse (Hibiki never met with Miku after the concert, Tsubasa and Hibiki are only known Gear users)
4. Serenaverse (Maria and everyone else involved at FIS except Serena and Mammu died, Serena is only known user)
5. Adultverse (Genjuuro, Ogawa, and apparently not-Evil Fine? AFAIK no known Gear users at all)
There are five primary universes in XDU IIRC
As are the adults
Also, just to be noted, the AU Tsubasa, hibiki, and Miku, are all from the same AU
~~Kirika got Tsubasa's ice cream for a month after this stunt~~
I love how Shirabe is just completely unfazed
but I kinda don't want to know the context
This *has* to be from something
I got the girls backwards though
but also I want to hug her
Kirika's face makes me laugh so hard
THANK YOU
YES
and Kirika's just like on the verge of crying her eyes out and Tsubasa is just like "Maria wtf"
Do you have that one meme of Maria pretending to sell DMJii
Oh Kerrik and/or Ixki
I was thinking of that old one with dead Kirika and Shirabe marrying Ogawa
wait no nvm, I got the characters wrong
That one random image
It started as  uh
I think
I'm like 90% sure this started as a meme and became an actual thing
ah yes, the forbidden ship
would get a sale out of me if you could tbh
sadly she is NPC
yeeeeeee
thanks, shirabae

ay shirabe I need your help
~~also it's porn so google at your own risk~~
not boobs
But that was butts
It makes me think of Is My Hobby Weird
It just stays in shape
like Kanade's
Her hair is just magical
Tsubasa: "Well even my worst days become good when I massage your boobs."
Maria: "Well then, massage away, my sweet."
Just most days
That was the joke, but I wanted to subvert it because Tsubasa doesn't have a bad day every day
Tsubasa: "I massage Maria's boobs whenever I'm having a bad day."
Maria: "But Tsubasa, you massage my boobs every day."
Tsubasa: "Well I massage your boobs when I'm having a good day, too."
I purport them to be thirsty for each other
That's all I do
Tsubasa is always thirsty for Maria
Tsubasa: "Maria, I've had a long day. I need a massage."
Maria: [removes her shirt]
Tsubasa: "I don't wanna! I just wanna make yours bigger!"
Maria: "Well, Tsubasa, they're right here! Come and get your fill~"
Maria: "Don't worry Tsubasa, I'll massage them for you plenty to make them niiiiice and biiiig~"
Maria: "Oh look, after I went to that buffet, my bust got 2cm larger!"
Tsubasa, looking at her latest waist measurement: [angry crying]
~~all the fat goes straight to her tits so it doesn't matter~~
some fat cat tats to go with that fat mamacat
that's a fat maria cat
nvm
derp
oh wait
weren't there four panels to that
Tsubasa: "Maria I'm home! You know what that means?"
Maria: "My dinner is ready?"
Tsubasa: [rips off pants] "Your dinner is ready!"
lol
Sports anime about tank combat
Girls und Panzer
that's a big compilation of old images tho
yeah
It's cute
so it's their spirits coming back to visit
It's an Obon reference
I think
That's just her uh... GX? casual outfit
https://twitter.com/jyudo_fu/status/1172165488098439168
Twitter will asplode with Hibiki art for the next ~3 days
https://i.imgur.com/Y0jO3NA.gif
rip
tagged, but very old
hold on what's that first image in the +Chris folder
That being said, it's Maria, she's going to do something incredibly embarrassing regardless
9% isn't that weak by cider/beer standards
the execution is nooooooot great
but it
I get what they were going for in that last one
Oof
It might just be me but I picture her as the type to get rather... hands-on
Kanade I picture as the kind who takes a lot to get wasted but continues to drink until she's trashed
I want to go drinking with Kanade
she's a lightweight
so
Maria's also a failure
"Kanade, Kanade, what's that?"
"Sake."
"But I'm not old enough to drink!"
"Yeah, but Maria and I are."
as a good birhtday prank
Kanade is planning on getting Bikki trashed
It's Sake
Hibiki: "Look, look, Miku! Which one is best?!"
Chris: "Now there's two of these idiots..."
Miku: "BOTH PLEASE"

okay fuck off, I hit ctrl+C
Horizon Cannon in general is pretty similar to Angel Arms
Actually
Reminds me of Trigun
but something about Kanade is... different
I'd be like "Fuck yeah let's do it"
like if they wanted to, say, dress up as Daidouji or Yang
I mean it's not necessarily even something like that
I wouldn't want them to dress up as Kanade to appeal to some sort of fantasy for me
Like, assuming I find someone some day
weird
but the idea of them cosplaying her to "be her" as some sort of appeal towards me feels
I've seen good cosplays of her
Like it's not that I don't *want* people to cosplay her
I'm kinda torn on the idea of cosplay in general tbh
Then nothing happens because I work the next day
Depends on what's going on lol
Bring me booze and I'll love you forever
Kanade would add so much fun to the group dynamic tbh
I am hydrated
well that's fuckin' cute
I know where it's from tho I just got it from there lol
thanks shirabe

They put them on before a concert
"Tsubasa?"
"Hmm?"
"You're really beautiful, you know?"
"Oh, thank you, Maria. Y... you are too."
"... can I kiss you?"
"I'd be disappointed if you didn't."
"... is that *all* I can do?"
"I'd be disappointed if it were."
just delete the post here and repost it in <#601872369660854272>
ain't gotta be sad

good ol' shitty tagging
thanks shirabe




need some shirabe sources
whether it's nonsense or not
and you've come out of boot camp where you've spent the last few months being told to follow every order you're given to the letter
It's one of those things where you assume you know nothing when you are at the bottom of the food chain
And from that day forward they were best friends
"Alright, Hibiki, I need to do some work on my motorcycle, so go get me some Headlight Fluid."
"Okay, miss Kanade!"
"Dumb kid... she's cute though."
>twenty minutes later
>Hibiki returns, covered in engine grease, scuffs, and bruises, holding a bottle labeled "Headlight Fluid"
"How the fu-"
The first few ~~weeks~~ months would have been Kanade jokingly telling Hibiki to go do stupid shit and Hibiki *actually doing it* and Kanade having to go bail her out
I feel like, had Kanade and Hibiki actually been given a chance to really get to know each other
Gungnir Sisters is perfect
I love that one
so Maria can't do a thing to punish her
All the sweetness of Serena
so she's always getting in trouble and doing stupid shit
All the fire and spunk of Kanade
and Tsubasa and Maria never spend another day in peace
Approximately 9 months later, Serenade Kazanari-Eve enters the world
"There's not a chance in hell our daughter could be any more of a nightmare than these two are, we can handle anything"
Like two weeks in
"Are we ready for kids?"
They adopt DMJii first as a sort of "test run"
Serenade Kazanari-Eve
Spoilers: the children they're adopting are DMJii
Finally he just gives up and announces that *he's* gay and that he doesn't give a fuck anymore, Tsubasa and Maria have been married for years and are planning to move to the US to adopt children and he's going with them because he's sick of dealing with Japan's idol culture bullshit
Manager drinks himself to sleep every night wondering what new gay bullshit he's gonna have to cover for the next day
Manager plays it off as them having gotten stuck in a sketchy part of town and having nowhere else to stay
They get caught leaving a love hotel together
Manager plays it off as "Tsubasa was choking, Maria had to save her"
Maria shoves her tongue in Tsubasa's mouth on-stage in the middle of a song
Manager plays it off as part of their 'colleague development'
media uproar
They get caught wearing them in public
Manager plays if off as part of their costumes
Media uproar
Either that or because I mentioned it before and someone was like "The fuck?"
I think I posted it before because someone wanted dragons
Kunyono: actually a really talented artist with great taste when he's not drawing gryphon Hibiki taking a shit
I got 2.25 in my Kanade folder



There's a reason pretty much all the manga I consume is fluffy sol/romcom or pure comedy
The only suffering I still deal with is Berserk, and that's because I got on that train years and years ago
I don't do suffering anymore
Fuck that
but apart from that the design is killer
the missing chunks are freaking me out

My favorite was padparadscha
You know, one of those weird 1-2-year obsessions elementary schoolers have
When I was much younger, I was really into gemstones
Interestingly enough
Also
I thought you said "This Kanade"
I misread
OH
and don't the gems wear those white shirts like that
The lack of Kanade's upward feathers in her hair
are you sure that's not supposed to be Padparascha
and a beautiful Kanade too
lmaoooooo



~~monday is one of my days off~~
look at something and start crying
You ever just

they are very powerful
I wanna fondle Kanade's thighs
"thighs you want to fondle"
"bewitching thighs"
the tags on it lmao
~~methinks Kanade is powering up Maria's fingers for another reason~~
Maria thinks Kanade is suspicious lmao
She's giving Maria her forehead-flicking power, for the express purpose of flicking Tsubasa
Kanade is the Goddess of Forehead Flicks
lol


idk what it's supposed to mean bu
"I explained the manager's joke"
At perfect pussy-eating height
I'll check when I get back home
It might be there
I have an old folder on my external HDD with a backup of most of the files on the C drive of my old computer
lmao
Tsubasa: "Maria, why did you buy a daki of me?"
Maria: "Well you can't sleep in my bed every night."
Tsubasa: "Who says?"
seifuku was white and blue
It was a single, long braid
No
Kerrik is working on it lmao
Maria you fucking... Maria!
is that a Tsubasa daki
HATS ARE GOOD CI-
HAT
It wasn't a large image either if memory serves
It's just Maria, and IIRC she's doing a little salute and is like half bent-over
<@!263983345669505025> do you have that image of Maria in a seifuku with a braid? I think she's wearing a hat
aww shit I don't have it anymore
with the braid
the sailor one
My favorite Maria image is the uh
~~if only the artist weren't a complete twat~~

not braidss but I like it
I'm so far past the point of being able to imagine Kanade doing almost anything in almost any art style it's getting hard to remember what's actual fanart and what are just things I thought ofd
I coulda sworn I had more than this
Messy braids!
Double braid!
I know I got some
Braid Kanade
which might have been why I thought I remembered her as being younger in that image
That Maria's thighs aren't actually that thicc though
thicc braids are a solid second place to thicc thighs

Almost midnight, in fact!
Lots of Bikkis I'm sure
Good luck!
So o can devote time to it
So best for me would be a Sunday or Monday
But on the weekend (Sunday/Monday) I'm pretty much open all the time
10:00-11:00 and 23:00-02:00 JST during the week
My active hours are like
Once Kerrik is sorted we need to compare Kanade folders
Which is "whatever appropriately delays you to the point where I can be present for the Kanade sorting"
I assume you know my vote
I mean

rip
ri[
you're welcome, shirabe
I'm pretty sure I have all these already but I love seeing them again
the paper-cut-out style looks so cool
I really love this art
Oh, that's a wonderful outfit!
https://i.imgur.com/5gyosAg.jpg
but there's a Kanade image that's literally photoshopped PRincess Celestia
I'm not sober enough to find it
fuck

and the headphones don't match, even if for some reason they decided to draw orange!Tsubasa
also the only other gear with a collar like that in S1 was Tsubasa
Actually tagged with her for once, too
It's like
yes

https://twitter.com/kkcawlt/status/1175247981374652416 really super cool basa in the link
what's the name of the tall girl anyways
That sounds right
Like 2015 or 2016
It was more recent than that
I don't remember her name but she was super tall and had long, messy hair so my friend called her Godzilla-chan
Actually not true, one of my friends watched one of the iM@s series and sent me pictures of a character I'd probably like
My entire experience with both LL and iM@s is doujins
What
Not knowing who
Or rather, based on the art, in one they made her head a tiny bit *larger*
Hibiki's head is a tiny bit smaller in one
Why is there a difference here
Why
Kirin beer with the Kirin on the can
Kirin should do an MH promo series
I have very mixed feelings on the idea of characters that transform and radically change personality in the process
She is very cute
"I suck for" just makes you sound even thirstier than you usually are lol
"I am a sucker for" lmao
I see only a single ara there


Genjuuro wearing Ichaival
<@!263983345669505025> do you have it
Voyeur did you ever see the Ichaival!Genjuuro
I can generally predict who my favorite character will be from a cast photo before watching a show
because the character archetypes I like and the character designs I like are so intrinsically linked in shows with large casts
I can basically confirm she's my favorite character without seeing the show
The funny thing is
She's not sure how far away you are though
Thank you~
Galaxy Brain
That just means less travel between the rice and your mouth
It's a bowl on a stick
I mean
I don't know anything about KonoSuba except to know that that's a good joke lol
Was that uh
that wasn't Judith
The rest of... shit, which one was that
looked stupid as hell
The omegathighs drumstick legs
Okay but like
Can't fucking wait for that BD Release
Sawano's score for Promare is amazing
I don't have a folder for it, guess not
I feel like I downloaded this series a long time ago and then forgot about it
Sign me the fuck up
Sawano music?
Wait wait
Mech design is cool
I've seen fanart from it before
The one with "long hair"
The... Nad... Nadleeh?
Dynames and uh
it was un
the robots
But not the characters
was from Gundam 00
Some of the first R34 I ever found
On a somewhat amusing note
robutts
"What do you mean new shit from the latest episode is spoilers?"
so
Even if not that, for other things in 12
people can't not spoil me
Like I said
wonderful
People just can't not spoil me
I mean I'm here so probably
The extremely blocky designs really only worked with itself
GA was the biggest offender in "It only looks good with itself" imo
It was definitely measurably more anime than the other armor sets
Yeah, that was definitely a problem
*cough*Aaliyah*cough*
meanwhile the head, arms, and especially legs could be used with almost any middle or heavy armor set and not look dumb
but looked stupid with other armor sets
It looked really good on White Glint itself
Honestly wasn't a huge fan of the core of ACfA White Glint
Same
Which makes me sad because I can't keep my Gungnir main Arsenal and also make an "Ignite Tsubasa" set with the Ame no Habakiri armor wielding Dainsleif
My only complaint with early-game DxM is you can apparently only have *one* Arsenal
which was great
The arms were also like literally Gundam Arms
White Glint legs were dope af
I spent more time building NEXTs than I did actually playing the game
Just the ACSYS
Hell not even the game
I'd kill for ACfA to get ported to PC tbh
Interior Union's Lightweight design
That's what it was
LATONA
No, Lahire was different
was that Lahire?
I want to see how accurate my memory is
more than a decade ago
This was like
I do lol
post it in NSFW
I mentioned it a while ago but couldn't find it, the "literally photoshopped Princess Celestia" Kanade image
while I was looking for that
Also I found it

counterargument
but
Chris is pretty cute
~~never again~~
~~once~~
I did
lovvi'd
she gets... uh...
She doesn't get bulli there
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868> "To shoot cum all over us."
"Here, Chris, you can be a cat in heat, and Miku and I will be cats in heat. And we'll *fuck*. A *lot*."
oh das is very cute
looks like a saber
Yeah but you did it
Hitomi is great
and a significantly less-dense MC
It's just Komi-san but with a scary girl instead of a demure girl
HITOMI SAN IS SHY WITH STRANGERS
Yeah I just love watching Kanade be cute with - oh
y u no ep 12
ytt what doin
same
thanks for the ping <@!237964037898502144>
Oh shit, that's a gorgeous Kanade
That white fluffy thing is a baby version/clone of Ridley
Yeah
Samus
The one thing scary enough to make Samus shit her pants:
Hibiki gonna Kobe that ice cream right onto Chris' empty cone
Jii: "Let's buy you a new one."
Dess: "I-I'll give you this!"
thanks though!
it's the same, 😦
can you link me?
danbooru might have better res
It has a tumblr filename

yessssss
I love the way the flaps of her gear are fluttering in the wind there
thanks for the ping!
old but good
Which came first, the chicken or the wing?
what? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
⚔
Yeah reminds me of something <#336297808221044736> too
Maria chasing an explosive splooge of liquid and deciding to cover it with her mouth instead of any other solution?
Chris gives her mentos
Maria: "Hmmph. I can do that too."
Chris throws M&Ms into the coke bottle to brag about her accuracy
Chris pranks her
https://imgur.com/gallery/GMSCpjp
is it tagged right?
I'll pick up the full res version when I refresh then
because I haven't seen XV ending
I haven't checked Pixiv recently
Ah
Hey Shirabe you alive
but Shirabe didn't find it
pixiv filename
wait
das new
👀
look at her arms
and some good muscle in there too
So much floof
<@200848377632653312>
<#601872369660854272>
Wrong channel
so I guess it's Tsubasa x Tsubasa x Maria
The crossed swords thing was originally meant to be Tsubasa and Maria

Oh, das a good chris

"Hey, Maria, look here! I got these T-shirts from a fan!"
"... tasteless..."
<@!247701824335904770>
lmao
I'm almost finished with my story
Without leaving myself out of the guilt pool of this I would like to remind everyone we *are* in <#336297674707828747> and I have very much not been helping with that
But sometimes it's hard to keep a straight face
Tsubasa plays along as best she can
Maria wants to top but isn't good at it
G: "You do know I'm legally forbidden from actually *giving* you these keys, right?"
T: "Yes, I know, but Maria really likes to tie me up and these handcuffs are just so use-"
G: "Oh *god*, I can't *know* that!"
~~They've had to ask Genjuuro to open the locks after roleplay several times~~
~~but not the keys~~
and SONG let Maria keep her old jail outfit
Tsubasa's been a bad girl
danke
tags says it's someone from idolmaster
Thanks for the ping though!
And I already have it!
It does!
Remember, spamming commands like that is what forced Kiri to be limited to specific channels last time
Kanade with shotgun
<@!247701824335904770>
I want Kanade to *ara ara* me
Chris: "AAAAAAA I'M SORRy..."
Chris: "Wait, with this person, it's probably no big deal..."
Kanade: "... perv."
Chris: [asplodes]
Kanade: "It's just a joke, just a joke! Wow, Tsubasa's kouhai is so cute~"
Old but gold
lmAO
it'd be a shame to ruin this one
There's a shortage of perfect movies in the world

Mawia?
Code 429 is "We overloaded the bot with too many requests too quickly"

This is meant to be a reference to something else but various girls in different outfits


We all know it's gonna kill Maria
The sweater is called a virgin killer for a reason
of course
lol
Chris with an Ichaival-styled shotgun would be really cool though
it's so cute
I love Mama Chicken Kanade and Babby Chick Hibiki art a lot
I thought you meant there were two units
Yeah I suppose if you count it that way
Ah
You're not wrong though, Deimos Witch is super cute
Do you know something don't
>both
like meido
It's not even a "Eww lewds" thing it's just an aesthetic that doesn't particularly appeal to me
~~I'm honestly not overly fond but I'll take what I can get for Kanade~~
good
very
It's good
I did see that earlier, courtesy Ikxi
v cute
*Trigger* in general
KLK in general
Her and Satsuki are both real good character designs
Ryuko is super cute
then I guess fine?
If we go by who killed *Ridley*
I mean I don't think Samus killed anybody's parents but
is very, very Ridley
the way they're posed
and those wings
that tail
I mean it does actually say dragon but just
that's dope
Motherfucker that's *Ridley* Kanade
"Dragon" Kanade?
Very cute!
XV ||wouldn't that technically be considered XV spoilers given it's the design and weapons specifically from XV? I thought that was what was decided last time||
banchou
Actual Meido > Bunny > "Slutty" Meido
It depends
She can lay you, too

https://i.imgur.com/GuHqXP0.jpg
Hibiki: "I WAS A GOOD GIRL TODAY ALL BY MYSELF GIB GOHAN"
Because the kanji used, more literally, would be like "The strike category of my armor has become stronger"
The last line is an awkward translation
"You better be listening, Ryoko."
"Record this."
"My armor's attack power has gotten stronger."
Now there's a crackship
"Do alchemy with me... Ger... main..."
"St... Germain... Big... Sis... Germain..."
I'm always broken
Bab Bik
touch fluffy tail
Maria: "Don't tell Maria what?"
Shirabe: "Kiri I tried to make dinner and then everything exploded please don't tell Maria"
yay!
Shirabe: [wakes up from dream] "Oh thank god, I thought she was going to crush me... in her giant vagina."
Chris: "OKAY, WHAT DOES YOUR INTERNET SEARCH HISTORY LOOK LIKE?"
Smoljii: "Kirika be careful, you don't want to accidentally eat me!"
Kirika: "Oh don't worry, I know exactly what I'm doing. It's not these lips you need to be worried about going into..."
That is good
oh dang
You can post the Twitter link in <#336297674707828747> yeah
Twitter counts as a source
It's probably good for <#336297674707828747>
Fancontent is meant to be stuff by users
this looks suspiciously more like "Hibiki is dead so the girls comfort her"

hold up let me find it I know I have it
No like it was an XDU thing, Maria gave her that dress as a present and Kanade was all "But cute things aren't really my... thing" but Maria was too insistent
It was a birthday present from Maria
I'm pretty sure I have that already but AAAAAAAAAAAA
for that being her sister
getting a little too into it
Serena is uh
Nobody looks bad in a well-fitted suit
It's like a suit, except Japanese
Literally everybody looks good in a kimono
I'm pinging myself for later

Kanaboy
Thanks!
<@!476058996315389953> thanks for the pings! I haven't been able to browse Twitter for multiple weeks so I really appreciate the pings for new art!
~~She cried herself out and her dad left his jacket there for her~~
~~that was Kanade's picture~~
~~this is shortly after the S1 concert~~
since that doesn't look like *her* jacket
I'm gonna hazard a guess
sleepy basa
Double Kiri!
er ma gert
"It's not quite finished yet though, it still needs the cream filling."
"I packed lunch for you, Tsubasa. It's between my legs."
"Maria, we're at work-"
"I'm on my lunch break."
"Then why don't you eat something-"
"Oh, trust me, I'm going to."
Maria's already got her by the scarf, no kabedon necessary
"Wait, Maria! I understand what you're saying-"
So would tons of Kunyono's sketches
probably won't
yeah
but especially the hair
I really like the everything
so goooooood
That's definitely new!
That's new!
Thanks for the pings though!
<@!263983345669505025> assuming you didn't follow the source link there
Those train kits are expensive
That's clever
LOL
Tsubasa Smash
Maria had no need for it but couldn't bring herself to destroy/throw away something Tsubasa bought for her
After about three weeks of only ever seeing the Yes pillow, Tsubasa discovers the No pillow buried in the closet
Tsubasa, tiring of continually having to ask Maria for sex, buys a set of Yes/No pillows
and wants to sleep on them
I think Tsubasa is saying something about how Shirabe and Kirika are always bragging about Maria's, erm, pillows
https://i.imgur.com/wfdxhnI.jpg cool looking robutt
"Oh, Tsubasa, I was just- umm- I uh..."
"No, Maria, you're really cute in that! Blue looks good on you!"
"Yeah it does."
"What?"
"What?"
Just Maria trying to cosplay
I did yes
>400+ new messages
with the gold on the "gems" of the spear
Oh that's a nice touch
Hibikkuman
lol
Miku and Shirabe end up meeting up and realizing what's going on
Tsubasa plans to propose to Maria and tells Miku about it, so she can follow and take pictures
But basically the idea was Maria plans to propose to Tsubasa and tells Shirabe about it, so Shirabe can follow and take pictures
Not a lewd fic
Oh I had a cute idea for a fic
I don't want to police you but maybe you shouldn't be single-handedly (potentially) using up all of Shirabe's daily request count on a regular basis
especially when it's done when people are away from the server and come back to "400+ new messages since 30 minutes ago"
and dumping hundreds of images at a time makes it hard to actually appreciate them in any capacity
Because like, I get wanting sources for everything, but adding jii_skip to everything defeats that purpose
is there a reason the multi-hundred image dumps stopped going in shitposting?
Hibiki not having much of a sense for timing and caring more about "I wanna marry Miku so I'm gonna just bust out the ring right now" seems like a very Hibiki thing
The purpose of jii_skip is avoiding Shirabe multi-pinging the same source when posting multiple images from the same source
or both
Or Shirabe runs out of daily source pings
Either we get a ton of unsourced art
The volume is the issue
That still leaves the problem of "We want sources on everything" and "Shirabe has a limited source of source pings per day"
severe
And the frequency lately has been a little uh
Additionally, see
"It shuts down a channel for hours on end"
There's a contradiction between "We want art sourced" and "Sourcebot can only source so many images per day"
The problem is art doesn't get sourced there
<#407060923078017026>
^
not to spam it
The point of this channel is to post art, yes
and leaves it a mess to go back to
It's the fact that it completely shuts down an entire channel for hours on end
I sat through a what, almost 700-image dump in shitposting? a few weeks back
It's not a matter of being digestible or not
it's just reverted to "Mark all as read"
the skip to top button isn't even a skip to top button anymore
but yeah
Then again, I also very rarely visit the art channels on android
and then it stopped again
a few days
It worked on Android for like
Tapping the banner marks them all read
Not on my clients
Going on my lunch break and scrolling up 50+... 100+... 150+... up to when Discord stops counting at 400
30-70 new messages in <#336297674707828747> is nice
waking up and seeing like
Like I said, I like seeing you post art
Yeah
but you post too much, too quickly - it's hard to digest no matter what channel you're doing it in, simply because the volume is *too great*
I like looking at the art you post
I like you posting art
I don't want you to stop posting art
Yeah
crash Discord
Dump all 23k pics individually
Make them regret those words
I think you know
those genetics are just gonna be glued to each other
I mean
what happens if their daughters are gay
"Keep it reasonable, and for extreme volume go to DMs"
I'll keep on enjoying your art posts
Yeah
not a "I want to dump 100+ pictures and not kill Shirabe" get-out-of-jail-free card
jii_skip was meant to be a niche use command from the start
also that
In theory, no, but on art-heavy days (like character birthdays or episode releases) you can easily run up the source counter
If I want to post five Kanades from a new Pixiv album, I'll post one and then jii_skip the rest so I don't waste pings because they're all from the same place
Again, because of the limited number per day
so putting a very specific focus on a very detailed texture feels out of place, and draws attention to it
I think it's because anime-style art tends to be less-detailed, with regards to variation in texture
I do too
yeah










Not a lot, maybe 5-10 or so
Can I post a few Kanades?
taiyaki is good civ
I was gonna make a boybikki joke but that's Kacchan from MHA isn't it
wait
Hibo-
GRAPE GUN
and... someone had a gun, right? What was the gun?
and a guy with durian armor
There was a dude with a banana spear
That whole series' theme was fruit
IIt is
~~that's why I watched it lol~~
the sequel was garbage though
Boondock Saints is a fun movie
And Shepherds we shall be For thee, my Lord, for thee. Power hath descended forth from Thy hand Our feet may swiftly carry out Thy commands. So we shall flow a river forth to Thee And teeming with souls shall it ever be. In Nomeni Patri Et Fili Spiritus Sancti.

Oh that's cool
hard to think of something better

Booknir
Hisone to Maso-tan was nice
https://i.imgur.com/V4dSSUT.mp4 speaking of dragons
looks inspired by the Dragon designs from XDU though
It's like a snake-priestess motif
look at the staff
Less dragon, more snake
looks cool
Yeah, I've not seen that one either
<@456226577798135808> specifically it's cropped out of this, from XDU
she'd be even more of a game OC than she already is
to be fair
If they changed her appearance in XDU
I mean
Cute!
Just sayin
Some of these are definitely not <#336297674707828747> material
Yeah the Sungnir outfit is really awesome
OOOOOOOOOOO
I like the style
Oh that's cute
cute birb
Kanade, equal-opportunity Kabedon-er
Yeah, there's a bunch of good ones in there
so thanks for that!
also I didn't have that one before, of her in the concert outfit with the hood up
Epic Sax Kanade
It's one of my faves
It's good anyways
That concert one almost looks like the Kanadeverse version of that Tsubasa solo concert, look at the little ornament in her hair
thanks for the Kanades though~
underscore, not .
*whoa*
Very cu-
also doll personality swap
Chris looks surprised to be so tall lol
Ah, that'd do it
it's a pun
Fine0ally
"Fine" sounds like "Finally"
looks like someone's genes fine-ally kicked in

Kirika: "Maria Maria! Yeet me!"
Maria: "Uh"
Shirabe: "Throw her."
Maria: "Why would I-"
Kirika: "YEET ME!"
Maria: [gingerly picks up Kirika and tosses her a couple feet]
Kirika: "That's a poor excuse for a yeet."
Shirabe: "You might want to use Airgetlamh."
Maria: "... okay..."
Maria: [transforms]
Maria: [yeets Kirika to the fucking moon]
Shirabe: "That might have been a little much."
Kirika, on the moon: "I GOT YEETED!"
he sings despacito in class and does fortnite dances
One of my students is a fucking memelord
she'd probably laugh at being a meme
yeet the Kiri
because they're Japanese high school-age girls
The rest of the Geahs are just tiny
neither Kanade nor Maria are actually *that* tall in the grand scheme of things
though tbf
You need legs more than figure
Yeah
u cute too
don't worry lil hamster
Hibiki in the background lmao
I'd let Kanade put pretty much anything in my mouth tbh
[gestures]
I was so distracted by her smile I didn't notice the um
uh
was not how I intended that to sound
that
Kanade can shut anyone up with just a fing- wait
yeah, granted on arrival
Japan is not one of them
There are very, very few countries that legitimately don't require a visa to enter
"not needing a visa" is just code for "granted on arrival"
you need a visa
Can you get one on arrival?
You have your tourist visa?

Yeeeeee Promare was fucking awesome
sometimes music
Usually I put on DBZA lol
I can't fall asleep without some sort of noise
Kanade: "But seriously, what does the other guy look like?"
same
Maria hangs up on her and sighs, then goes for her car keys
Kanade: "Hey Maria so funny thing-"
Phone immediately rings again
She hangs up
"What do you *mean* you're in jail??? Well, fine, I'll come get you."
Maria gets a phone call, freaks out
The police station gives you your phone call
Kanade is sitting there in the cell with you, laughing her ass off
Maria shows up to bail you out of jail after you fucked up
Kanade and Maria are the two sides of the cool onee-san archetype
ultimate nee-san
very cute!

Elfnein: cute af but apparently entirely incapable of not fucking things up
Either way it's great and should be posted again
I'm gonna count as a "no"
That one
if I didn't I meant to
Did I not post that one earlier
https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Deerling_(Pok%C3%A9mon)
it is Deerling
Oh I was right
I didn't play that one much
I think it's from Gen V
Yeah it's a Pokemon
and was like "wtf why is baby shirabe so thicc"
I thought the pokemon's back legs were Shirabe's legs for a second
done with the new shit
I already left
Yeah
Autoscorer/"Bad End PreCure" Kanade

https://twitter.com/kunyono_gia/status/1188461629886750720 <@!237964037898502144>
but it's cute tho so worth posting again
~~beat ya to it~~
touch fluffy tail
angery fluff
I hadn't seen it but that also doesn't exactly count lol
though it is tagged with *both* Carol and Elfnein
It's also titled "Welcome back"
(Carol taking back over, that is)
Judging from the expression and the eyes I think it's Carol tho
Yes
and then falling asleep waiting for her
So I think it's Maria being home late and Tsubasa saying "I will wait for Maria"
but chanign saki to "machi" which is "waiting"
I think it's sakimori, the sentinel thing
It has to be a pun on something but idk what

https://twitter.com/N_niyu/status/1188464710472978433
~~fuck that generic imouto bullshit~~
~~also delinquent/Tiny Terror Serena is best headcanon, fight me~~
I like them a lot as afterlife buddies, getting into shenanigans and cheering on their friends and family but romance is purely because they both died
tbf it's also probably due to them being narratively paired with TsubaMari, as well as Kanade being the ultimate big sister, while Serena is the ultimate little sister
It's literally "pair the spares"
but I don't like SereKana at all
because I like Cocoa's art
I am torn
yeah Yang is great

I will go insnae
If you manage to start a trend
yesssssssss

That lase one of her singing
I want to see her smile
But more than that
I want those pillows <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
This really beautiful Kanade also has a really adorable spaghet chris in the source
that Ponytail Kanade is super gooooooooood tho
it says it in the caption
yeah that's Tsubasa
re: that Tsubasa in Kanade's outfit
Yeah, discords been really intermittent with those lately

Mordred I think?

Jalter and uh
I don't know much about Fate but I do know Jalter is good civ

Millarc is singing something about tomatoes
"Chris your outfits are really cute and these pockets on your chest are so convenient for storing snacks!"

that last one is amazing
Oh shit yes
That was my thought too

I figured, I appreciate it!

it's so good though
It got posted here ye and someone DM'd it to me hahaha
looks like pocky sticks lol
11/11
yeah
oh yeah that's coming soon
that's cool
Using the tie as the canopy
Who's that supposed to be? Is that Skywarp or something?
Not being based on G1 designs is a definite possibility
so maybe it's supposed to be some sort of hybrid?
it does also say something about "two people" or "two children"
soundwave *does* have red eyes/eye visor though
yeah
G1 at least
Shockwave has a yellow eye
Wait
the belt too
but the two kids in the background imply Soundwave
The red eyes and purple outfit implies shockwave
Is this shockwave
A love potion that will make Hibiki "like a beast"
"Biyaku" is love potion
Yeah
but it looks like Miku is like "S-so it's my birthday..." and Elfnein is like "Oh sweet I'll make something for you" and Miku wishes for a hentai Hibiki (complete with "I'm becoming weird!" line) and Carol shows up like "Stop corrupting my innocent little sister"

I should too
I think hair down generally looks better than hair up
and tbh much more than short vs long
in general, at least
but I vastly prefer long hair
Short hair can also be good

the stuff that's like red bean paste, but it's yellow and not quite as sweet
I always forget what it's called
I had one that was filled with uh
very tasty
It's typically filled with bean-paste or something of that ilk
A fish-shaped sweet snack, popular in Kansai and Kanto areas
Taiyaki
For me, the idea is more about being told what to do and how to do it
^
that's fair
BDSM doesn't have to be about pain
It's not about being hurt, it's about domination and submission
sometimes called Mon Chéri
I only know the character Police Girl

Not like Gray Hibiki who is basically a completely different person

prudish
/ˈpruːdɪʃ/
Learn to pronounce
adjective
having or revealing a tendency to be easily shocked by matters relating to sex or nudity; excessively concerned with sexual propriety.
Though apparently when used as a verb those kanji can also mean "to be prudish"
Yeah she's congratulating her, saying she's really elegant?
Monmusu is good civ
Because she's in her late thirties at the youngest, and wearing *that*
Chris is probably decent
She'll make a god tier Curry one night, then the next night, make the same exact Curry, and hospitalize five people
With absolutely zero consistency
I propose that Elfnein is *sometimes* amazing, and sometimes lethal
In a twist on the typical "Confident but actually garbage cook" trope

lmao
But the flat chest thing does make sense too
My interpretation of the unamused expression was that someone was mistaking her sword as a shield, as a kind of reversal of the thing that happened in season 1
lol
oh
Pettan? I know I've heard that before, but I can't remember what it's supposed to be
"It's a sword!"
"Well, yes, I'm-"
"It's a shield!"
"..."
I think it's a joke about the "A shield? No, a sword!" thing with the whole Pokemon Sword/Shield

LOOK AT THAT LEG ARMOR
I SEE IT
it looks familiar, sax, but I don't know what it's from
That does look like her torso armor though
That's what we're trying to sort out
Also AKeupho none of them have the right body or weapons
as is the hair style
It's mami's shirt but the hair color is wrong
I finally figured out what those were supposed to be
not-Mami (who I think is a Nanoha character?) has Eva Unit 00's arms
Oh speaking of parsing things
Maybe if I knew what it was supposed to be a reference to but my brain is just not parsing it
also are my eyes playing tricks on me or does the purple girl have no right arm
I'm pretty sure those are something else
also where are you seeing SSJ?
the legs on not-Mami also look really familiar
Her eye color is weird
Is that even Chris
no
so
I only recognize a little of what's going on
a lot going on there

As cool as it is
Kanade, King of Symphogears
Her spear is super fucking cool too, it has Godzilla spines all over it
LOOK AT HER LASER FACE
LOOK AT THE TAIL ARMOR

12 if you count the dots separating her names
instead of the 10 it is in kana
If her name *could* be compressed into kanji like the other girls, it'd likely only be 4-5 characters
Her name is also the only one written entirely in katakana, which massively inflates the character count
That is the joke, yes
"Why is only MY name cut off halfway through?" or something like that

Kanade: "Sup bitch."

Kanade: "Don't even bother, the waiting room is this way. Chris' parents are gonna be way worse than me, though, so be ready for that."

https://twitter.com/M_hisashi/status/1208045007493459968
but it's also disappointingly consistent
It's nice because it's a set of design tropes I also happen to really like, so having a personality I like with a design I like is nice
It's both encouraging and disappointing how easily I can pick my favorite character out of a female-cast show just looking at a group shot because of how closely connected the personality traits I like are to specific design tropes
I was right
Based on those short descriptions
I'm assuming I'd like the one on the right the best
based on facial expressions and haircuts
These are also good

I like calling that version Shem-Hawt
"And so, they were both bottoms"
Maria's too subby
but she's far too direct to "ara ara" somebody
Kanade definitely has more sexual energy than Maria, by a broad margin
Well





Fine intentionally withheld information on how to use the Gears that ultimately lead to Kanade's death
It's also the truth
And that one up there of her in her classic outfit is very nice
It is, the one with the present and Hibiki dressing her hair up like a Christmas tree are two of my faves
until Piros decided to be a dick
This was a good way to wake up
I appreciate the ping, Saki
She was also stated to have been stronger than Tsubasa at the time, so
and also as Saki said, shitty LiNKER, no power-ups, and not being told how to use her Zesshou correctly

It is
Which like, I get the logic, but signatures to prevent fraud and theft has been a thing for *literally millennia*
The guy suggested adding a watermark and her response was basically "I shouldn't have to change my art because bad people exist"
So like... it's *there*, but acting like this is such an unimaginable affront to artists that she's urging fellow Twitter users to block foreigners and wants to know how to set her tweets to "Only visible in Japan" is a mixture of xenophobia and naivete
And the Twitter image downloaded extension I have is authored by a Japanese guy (I think)
Japanese imageboards have existed long before foreign ones did
There is a stronger adherence to the gentlemen's agreement of not reposting without crediting the original source, but like
and going ballistic about it *after the guy immediately apologized and cooperated*
the level of naivete there is staggering
>and expecting people to just... not touch it
>publicly posting art on the internet
but at the same time
I understand being frustrated about art being stolen and used without permission
good luck with that
so like
with a relatively anonymous foreign twitter user
She also threatened to get the police involved
"I really believe we can never be friends with foreigners because their law and culture is too different" *wew*
And now she's posted a slew of xenophobic "Foreigners cannot be trusted, never post your art online because it will be stolen by foreigners who don't give a fuck about copyright"
Guy was like "Yeah okay, but I didn't take it from *you*, I found it on another website, I'll change it but posting your art publicly means this will happen again"
Someone used her art in the twitter pfp, so she tweeted like "Hey change your pfp, I did not and will not give you or anyone permission to use my art"
Oh boy, another one of my favorite Twitter artist is going ballistic and blocking all foreigners

where have I heard that before
like hmmm
"Here's the character who is a victim of circumstance and fucks up colossally and repeatedly when she tries to break out of that"
I see a lot of myself in Maria
Chris is a particular offender, since she's the Designated Waifu, on top of having giant tiddies
Transformation sequences are always pretty fanservicey
is because Kanade exists
The only reason she's not way my favorite
Like
Maria's so pretty
Man
Oh I love Dark Oblivion
Hikasa's English is just *bad*
That said, Maria's English in "Dark Oblivion"
and I think Word of God said Fine was like "mocking" English or something
There's videos of interviews and panels with her that predate Gear
like, good enough to go to US conventions without an interpreter
Her English is actually quite good
Fun fact, Sawashiro was intentionally butchering her English in that scene
I assume she's probably had to speak it in Conan
also I don't actually know how good Minami's English is
XV henshins are like 45s+
a bit more if you count the spear forming scene
Kanade's S1 henshin is like 15 seconds long
and B) the art quality for individual frames and shots is *way way* lower
A) they're *way* shorter
but
that is true
it's like yes
I get what people say when they say the S1 henshins had more soul to them, were much more unique
Imagine what an XV-style transformation sequence would have looked like
lol
It absolutely did
If there was I'd be a part of it
is that Kanade died before Gear had an actual animation budget
The single most criminal thing
~~shame the artist is a twat~~





Also sometimes featuring Hibiki
also real quick incoming Gungnir dump since we were talking about Kanade and Maria
I have it hung over my bed
*it super is*
At least she got one!
With less stuff than the other characters but hey!
Even Kanade got one!
on top of copyright shit
Abridged Series were birthed in a different era of the internet, and Gear's very heavy reliance on music will make an already-arduous task even harder to undertake
can't imagine that being very good
I
Pretty much any Symphogear content that isn't officially sanctioned gets wiped off youtube in moments
King Records is, even among Japanese companies, notoriously picky about copyright
Minami's voice is so fucking sexy when she's not trying to sound like an eight year old boy
I want more Minami in more things that aren't Conan
Yoko is the only one of the cast who I've bothered to look into their individual careers for
Yeah
Sawashiro's English is only bad when she's being told to make it bad
Hikasa's English is just bad whether she's in-character or not
Yeah.
"English"
well
The *entire song* is in English
Classy
especially with how low it sits on her breasts, too
Some sort of elastic, sure, but it's still loose enough to not dig into her skin and to sit away from her chest between her breasts
That top kinda defies physics anyways unless it's made of spandex or something, and it still goes into boob-socks mode regardless
which makes it an odd choice for a casual outfit
nipple tape or something, but from my understanding that's not really a daily-use thing
She's probably got to wear *something* to keep the top up though
So no, she's probably not wearing a bra
I don't think they are usually used for bahonkas as big as Kanade's
There is such thing as a strapless bra buuuuut
They did their best and that's what counts
"Maria
Happy birth
day"
I love the wall poster
Gunguni sisters is probably my favorite twitter






sorry Shirabe

It's a representation of Kanade, so yes, it counts
but considering Tadano's whole schtick is supposed to be "reading people"
Komi-san is really cute and fun

You disappoint me Kerrik
I just saw it! Cute!
as opposed to being dressed up for a photo shoot
there's a difference when you're choosing your own outfit
because it sells
Therefore anything that's vaguely fanservicey must have her look uncomfortable
Chris is the designated waifu
If they're too confident with themselves/their bodies, they're sluts
If they're not girly enough they're not waifus
Waifus must be hyperfeminine but also ashamed of their femininity
Shame = purity = waifu

Not going to be *shot*
also "someone is going to die by bullets"

Oh does mobile only display the first image?
Maria first, then Chris
Not in the last panel
something along the lines of "Wow Chris' boobs are also really amazing"
I'm getting very Evangelion vibes from that
but Shem-Ha seems more than slightly distressed
Miku seems to be fine with it
and she's sorry she has to hit Miku to do it
She wants Miku back

thanks
At first I thought she was disintegrating but nah it's just weird furry art lmao
~~is it suffering~~
Thanks though, I'll look into it
one of them might have red hair
There's like a bazillion sabers
and I guess she's not actually firey just kinda fire-colored
is she a saber? She kinda looks like a saber
Oh I like that firey girl with the sword up there
I like her
Who's that

Visqi Brisingamen
Kanade's could have some good stuff in it if it takes from XDU
They said they're gonna do a Kanade one though
I think
I'll be curious if it only goes for the show or if it takes from XDU
I'm looking forward to the Kanade one
so throwing a lot of images really fast can also throw her off
She also can only source so many images over a period of time
when doing large image dumps, especially if we already know the source/artist or they're all from the same place, use the jii_skip command
this is good
fit dragon girl
oh yes
dark skin + light hair is such a good combo
Oh I like her
but I'm pretty sure I was confusing it with Fate
generic anime design
I always thought GBF was just
Yeah it's much better than I thought
Even better main than fem!Byleth
Fuck yeah, get that shit in
this is her though?
I don't remember why
I head people talking about possibly adding a Katalina from GBF to Smash
Is this the chick people are talking about adding to Smash
Wait wait
but still looks very feminine
A character that fulfills a traditionally/stereotypically masculine role
See this is what I like

You have to be careful with Kanade's hair after you cut it, it may gain sentience

Maximum Overfloof
the results, however, are wonderful
Cutting Kanade's hair is a sin, the barber must be put to death
everything is maximum soft
Also Lily your art is so good
Excellent Kanades!
Oh that one's a classic Kanadude

So it does work in that regard
I mean, Kanade's last name uses the same characters as Ame no Habakiri
"I peeped on Maria's bath" would be a literal translation
Tsubasa was peeping on Maria
to peek, as in through a keyhole or gap

where your lips meet in the middle but tug down at the sides and your chin gets all scrunchy

"from"
"cuddles"
"all the time every time"
"u no wut i get"
"lookit me"
not blue
though apparently her canon hair color is dark orange/brown
lol
the other half of Nana
Mizuki
~~who was also jacked as hell and great~~
No wait, that was the Fem!All Might from before
The One Punch girl is like Nana or something I think
from MHA
The rabbit
Granted they fought the Dragon Knight dude too
They ended up killing the dragon I think

and Kanade's Dragon Knight armor is dope as fuck
There is an AU where Kanade, Shirabe, and Chris (and later Serena) go dragon hunting though
not from XDU
No, it's just a twitter thing
It's an AU where the gears turn into dragons when they go into their gears, and also have lil' cute pet dragon forms they can use in their daily lives
https://twitter.com/getuyoubi5/status/1245705871134322691 this one's Kanade instead but Maria's "attack mode" looks like this too
and in her "attack" form she's very clearly a dragon
Other artwork has her with wings and stuff
She's explicitly a dragon
but they are a thing
A bit more common in eastern mythology

https://twitter.com/golden_nabe/status/1246719672403128321
It's still a bit excessive
and everybody smokes like a broken stove
I'm not sure off the top of my head
I guess
Miku is... around? but not frequently
as is Gray Hibiki from XDU
Hibiki is Kanade's pet/lover/side-kick
as is Shirabe I believe
Kirika is a bartender/bouncer at Maria's club
It's a lot of pictures
I'm not exactly sure
As for the *leash* there
that Maria very much does not appreciate
Kanade, as any detective would in a noir setting, makes continual advances on her beautiful female client
Maria is her client
Kanade is some sort of vampire-detective
Think Hellsing meets Detective Noir
I'm really not a fan of this AU
On the other

Bridal Fine, just straight-up naked
Fuck it, bridal Autoscorers would be a great meme
Chris, Tsubasa, and Shirabe never got them
Kanade and Serena never got them
Now there's the AXZ Alchs and Carol
There's so many more to make more too
^
I might be remembering that wrong though
Wonderland sounds right
Whatever was right after brides
Either way, it was such a shitshow that they haven't even teased the idea of doing another bridal event (leaving the inevitable *giant sack of cash* called "Bridal Chris" sitting on the floor), and the units don't get rerun as frequently as most others
I have vague memories of getting a second apology announcement about a story getting removed from XDU
IIRC a second, unrelated event *also* got it's story pulled, but that one was never put in the game at all
It was so bad the story got pulled like hours before it was supposed to go live and we only know about it because of data mining
The short version is the wedding dress Gears induced a state of euphoria in the wielders not dissimilar to an opioid high, and as time went on the effect diminished and they started getting irritable when *not* wearing them, and IIRC even started to suffer withdrawal symptoms when they had to stop wearing them
There's "taking more risks" and then there's "making the Geahs drug addicts"
and it got shitcanned because it was *way too much*
They already did a bridal event
I imagine now that Gear is over and Kaneko has given them the unofficial seal of approval, events will probably get more elaborate and take more risks
They seriously fucked that up when it comes to XV though lol
In the sense that it didn't want to do anything that couldn't be handwaved or reasonably explained for why something (or someone) wasn't used in the main story
I think part of it was during the main series, there was that need to maintain the status quo so XDU could be """""canon"""""

Kancolle?
all I can think of is the one from uh
which one is musashi again
so it makes sense that they *didn't* do that
I meant just outright *removing her from the game* would be seen as a serious problem
Yeah, I've picked that up
I'd think that outright removing units from players' inventories would be *extremely* poor form unless the unit poses dangerous, possibly game-breaking bugs
So what, you just can't get any more of her ever again now?

There's also a couple side character succubi that are hot as hell
It had a cute ending, and an epilogue panel ||of them getting married|| but no real relationship developed during the manga itself
And then it got axed before it actually went anywhere
As it progressed, it implied that the succubus was kind of starting to fall in love with the guy, because he just treated her as a friend and as a person rather than, y'know
He wakes up, he goes to work, he works all day, he goes home, he falls asleep
That's basically what it is, the succubus goes to do succubus things to him, but all his dreams are just pure and wholesome because he's a salaryman with zero free time
Shame it got axed before there was any real development
That was a cute manga

You know now that you say it
More specifically, Monster Hunter monsters
I'm just waiting until they run out of ideas and we get "Space∞Bird" as an attack
but other times you just get "Cosmic∞Wing"
usually like a constellation or star
Everything is vaguely space-related

fuuuuuuuck it's so good
especially to give it to her in her Duo Relic
I really like that they went all-in on the "space" theme with Kanade's cards and attacks in XDU
I love this design so much
It's so good

Having the "grand finale" be another alchemist trio like AXZ would be... lacking
That was originally a typo but I kept it because it's accurate
the show has been building up to Custgodians
Hanging out with Kanade, providing Tsubasa with additional trauma
Hibiki just goes tubthumping every season
"What got Hibiki" what didn't get Hibiki
it was just one giant case of wanting her own dick the entire time
inb4 god is Fine
and it doesn't look like Basa is
Maria *might* be, but Hibiki and Chris aren't
they're... not really smiling?
Episode 1: "Wow these guys are really strong, how will we ever defeat the-"
>real big bad shows up and instagibs all three at once
"Oh"
I get NHK G, NHK E, RCC, HOME, and HiroTele
yeah nvm I don't get any of those channels
the only one I might get is BS11
yeah but I only get a couple channels since I don't actually pay for anything
idk if I even get the channel it's airing on though
01:00 on july 6 or like 25:00 july 6
but is that like
we know it's on july 6
on a somewhat related note
Miku: "Miku is... uh..."
Chris: "A true freak?"
Maria: "A genuine demon?"
Miku: "*The Devil!*"
Hibiki, in the distance: "OH MY GOD SHE'S SO GOD! DAMN! COOL!"
okay yeah
that's ||this|| right
I forgot about spoiler tags
Oh yeah
It is fanart but it's of the new character Kape
like for example Promare fanart
what about spoilers for other things
Or any sort of spoiler-y art for that matter
also should fanart pertaining to XV be placed in this channel or in the actual art channel
https://twitter.com/zakuro_t/status/1137680374484545536 new cags

Basically
so if I'm really lucky maybe RCC or HiroTele will have it
A couple of the broadcasters it lists though *are* parent companies for some of those
Hmm
Killing Nana's character would also give some heavy finality to the season
Last song of the series is a Zwei Wing duet
*Tsubasa* dies
plot twist
actually
gib minami
nyet
End of Symphogelion
With the Geahs talking over literal storyboard sketch drafts
I thought it was hilarious
which actually might be the best moment of GX
She uses the attack again in GX
Nope
rude
wow
pls
wtb Kanade in an OVA
I grab everything manually but I also don't watch very much anime these days
SVP yooooooo
But we have no evidence that she'll even become a Gear user again in-canon, much less that she'll receive a deprecated power-up
Miku has "Aigis" in XDU, which is an extra relic that powers her up in XDU in a very similar manner to Ignite forms
Your friend is either bullshitting you or is misinformed as to something that happened in XDU
almost certainly not
I'll be going back to Firefox after near on a decade of Chrome use if Chrome kills adblock
tomorrow doesn't start until you sleep
Because Japan is the first country to figure it out
I'll be able to watch it live then if I get the channel it airs on
Aww hell yeah, it's Jul 6 25.00?
or whatever the fuck tjhat one TNG episode is
Damaak and Jalad at Tanagra
With Eyes Unclouded
Kanade Bestgirl

SO MANY HUIGD ANS LOVE AND LOVE
MAKE THE KIRI FEEL LOVED AND DESERVED ANF WITH THE SHIRABE
HUG HTE KIRI
LOVE THE KIRI
KIRIKA DERSERVES LOVE
If Kanade comes back only to get killed off again I'm gonna riot
The issue is more I don't know if/which Hiroshima station will be rebroadcasting it
Alright, I'll have to see if I can watch either of those
Like what's the July 6 24:30 show
What shows are airing in the slot directly before XV
Like the first Kanade event, the Miku/Edgebikki event, Zwei Wing of Sirius, Gungnir Trio, etc
Just make OVAs of some of the XDU events
I wanna be sedated
twenty-twenty-twenty-four hours to go-o-oh
No, first episode airs in approximately 24 hours
You need either a satellite TV subscription, or to be living in Tokyo
I mean I'm in Japan and I can't watch it live
I do feel a little bit better though, cuz it does mean that my Saturday nights aren't beholden to the fact that symphogear is airing
Rest in peace Hiroshima, second-class anime citizens
I won't be able to watch live rip
Will I have anything to put in the folder
So here's my question though
also who wants to bet that the corpse is significantly less corpsey than initially claimed
SENKI ZESSHOU SYMPHOGEAR: STEEL BALL RUN
>the holy corpse
aww boy here we go
anything fun in the post-credits
That it's not *just* a Bikki thing, but something they could do for anybody
which would actually have made me feel a bit better about GX and AXZ's finales retroactively
and give her a giant sniper rifle or something
Yeah I thought they were gonna dump their power into Chris
was a bit of a wet fart of an ending
That
Yeah
Gear Blast?
what
Is she actually gonna-
Is she gonna do it
Is
Underwater fisting
Oh yeah this is Axia no Kaze
~~I should fix that~~
~~if it's from AXZ I apologize I actually didn't listen to the AXZ music that much~~
in episode one
is this a new sextet
wait
yeah
aaaaaaaaaand Gen gets cockblocked again
I have my extra-warm underpants!
~~bring me Brisingamen Kanade~~
>it's super cold, gears need extra shit
I'm watching it right now
skates
scates wtf
that's cute
Kiri has ice scates
aww
Oh hey it has the XDU Gear patterns in the background
~~we will never get a Kanade henshin like this~~
THIS WHOLE TRANSFORMATION SEQUENCE IS AMAZING
that's cool
S1 style transformation start
Oh shit what
Elf9 a cute
>IT'S STILL FUCKING FINE
time to watch
finally
alright
thanks
based on filesize I'm assuming 720p but who knows
is the Yamete Tomete version 720p or 1080p
I just gotta know
with no spoilers
~~Grimm Eclipse sucks please don't~~
No bullshit bringing her back into the plot but still get a proper, ***B U D G E T*** Kanade henshin
That'd be the ideal
Holy shit not even kidding
Like
I'd be more than happy with that
please make a Kanade transformation like this
please
anything
animators
animatoes
please
yeah
~~except AXZ because I somehow lost those ones and haven't gone back to grab them~~
This is all the frames she appears in
That's exactly what I'm talking about
Yes

:KanaDess:

In the manga 100%
I do think they're working on it though, just slowly
And I'll admit there's a lot of narrative pairing aiding it rather than direct evidence like with the others
The feelings are much weaker between Tsubasa and Maria, which is fair given that they've only known each other for like a year and a half and were trying to kill each other at the start
Which makes the evident mutual feelings with TsubaMari much healthier and more interesting
~~and also even before any waifu shit I genuinely don't think Kanade had romantic feelings towards Tsubasa, while Tsubasa definitely wanted Kanade that way~~
The point of Tsubasa and Kanade's relationship is that while they did deeply care for one another, it wasn't a healthy relationship because of where Tsubasa was as a person
They are, but that's because they're both complete characters now
Also there's been fan speculation about a Zwei Wing prequel, but afaik there was never anything close to actual rumors
but yeah
written the same
Miku's line in the ferris wheel about "What if I was the one causing trouble?" might as well have been a big fucking neon sign that said "FORESHADOWING"
I mean
Because it's out of place
I like the song but if I'm shuffling Gear music and Apple (or the Lydian chorus, for that matter) comes up I'm gonna skip it
It's slow and simple in a fast-paced and complex set of music
Two of them, in fact
She also got a battle song/character theme in XDU
Despite them being minor roles
Their seiyuu are probably the biggest names attached to Symphogear behind Nana and *maybe* Aoi
Re: Kanade and Serena still having fans
I wouldn't be surprised if that was all they got for her
That and trying to suck Adam's non-existent dick
I mean wouldn't it have been freakier if Anthony Hopkins had been naked in his cage in Silence of the Lambs?
Ara Ara is good but Fine is a fucking psycho which puts a significant damper on things
LET ELFNEIN SING AND GIVE HER MINORIN'S VOICE
I wouldn't be even a little surprised if we never see/hear about her again
Her body exploded and gave them the information about the coffin's location
They needed to add a new Gear-level threat
Alchemy ruined Symphogear
The only good thing about GX was the non-Ignite music, which was all really good
Carol was stupid, the autoscorers were stupid, Ignite is stupid, Ver coming back was *really* fucking stupid, the Ignite versions of the songs are universally worse than the originals, Topdad was stupid
The whole thing was fucking stupid
Oh yeah GX was fucking dumb
She wanted the Gears to think they were stronger than her... so she feigned getting her ass kicked
I don't see what you're confused about
She was already stronger but she needed the Gears to use Ignite and to think that it was an actual power-up that was letting them beat her
The only thing Carol *couldn't* do herself was write the Cursed Melody, which is why she had to give the Gears Ignite, force them to use it (to make sure it worked) and then set up the Autoscorers to lose
The entire point of G was "Hey the Noise aren't a threat anymore JK LOL STILL NOISE"
Alcanoise were stupid too
After the Noise were completely defeated in G
Everybody's happy, and nobody dies, they're all just students at Lydian and the villains/adults are teachers
I want a spinoff like the TTGL spinoff
I could understand not liking it but like, there wasn't even a chance for anything offensively bad to happen yet
like
I was about to say
wait, <@!302063351767498752> , the first episode of XV ruined Symphogear that badly for you?
Dumbbell is fun but let's not pretend it's good
Quite literally, in the case of Fire Force
There are some things I think original anime handled better
By and large
AXZ is just a flashback though IIRC
GX E6 features original unique animation
G E8 and G E12 both feature original unique animation
S1E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, E9, and E12 feature original, unique animation
Not after-credits
Straight up shown in the episode
No
Actually more like 8-9 S1 episodes
If you only count unique animations and not flashbacks to her death, she appears in five or six S1 episodes, 1 G episode, and 1 GX episode
She appears in 11 out of 13 S1 episodes, 4 G episodes, 1 GX and 1 AXZ episode
"They only showed her in a single episode"
it's an edit from XV ep1
That's Hibiki, originally
neverever.mp4
https://twitter.com/Rabbit_inWL/status/1147829391877005313
her [ALL SYSTEMS GREEN] message will say [ALL SYSTEMS DESS]
didn't do one in AXZ either
It might be trying to avoid alphabetizing fucking things up
(which is still just Hibiki)
only Test and Glorious Break were only Hibiki
Synchro and Vit were group attacks
so technically Testament and Glorious Break
Yeah
Hibiki doesn't get attack cards
I have personally experiences exactly zero Steins;Gate content and all I know about it is it's a time travel story
and even to an extent in AXZ
As evidenced by GX
Even if she wasn't crying about her dead friend every second on screen she was still a major presence in her mind
Tsubasa's relationship to Kanade was like, the driving force behind everything she did in S1 and a bunch of G
also "forgot about Kanade"
It's also not the same as making a licensed MMO, it's more like making a licensed MMO and including codes in BD sales that have a *chance* to give you premium shit
But S1 and G were not easy money
After G went well they had the hardcore fans hooked and *then* it became easy money
G was a gamble
S1 made a bit of money, not a lot, and it's a big expensive project
It *wasn't* easy money though
isn't Yami Yugi straight up killing people
Also yeah isn't the first series like
Season 0 or w/e?
*cough*HibikiandMaria*cough*
this conversation *is* pointless
Yeah
Because she
And attempted to kill herself literally, as well
That was Tsubasa's S1 character arc
Like
She *didn't* deal with Kanade's death properly
She's moved on from Kanade's death but hasn't let go of her memories of her first and dearest friend
and yeah, Tsubasa has learned the difference between moving on and letting go now
That's what that is
Like
The fact that they keep bringing it back and keep bringing it up is literally them *not* throwing the entire thing to the side
Not to mention it is literally used to try to break Tsubasa's mind again in GX and it only fails because *she has other friends*
She literally tried to kill Hibiki
She
Kanade's death has literally been brought up at least once in every season
people don't talk about it
If it's more than that
so like
exactly
yes
literally the explanation to all Hibiki's bullshit in S1 and G
"relic fusion"
or at least misalign some internals
She fired directly into it's barrel and *damaged* it enough to prevent it from firing again
also admittedly it's been a while but I don't think it was enough to completely destroy Kadingir either
the No Motion Kamehameha
the uhn
not the one-armed one
err
It happens to Cell on the One Armed Kamehameha and he comes back just missing a couple limbs
DBZ also eschews that a lot
It was in a keyword IIRC
both deflecting it and diverting the full force away from herself
She also fired her zesshou into the beam
lmao
"Because it's fucking good, eat up you fucking gaijin"
Granted these people are speaking English at a kindergarten level though so...
I've heard *actual Japanese people* attempt to describe Okonomiyaki as "pancakes"
To be somewhat fair
It's also referred to as a "Superb Song" in later seasons
Swan song is a mistranslation
Symphogear tech is blackbox tech created by an ancient immortal priestess with heretical magic knowledge and also literally runs on magic relics
like, throwaway-line-tier mention, but I'm pretty sure Ryoko throws it out there at one point
It's also mentioned in the show IIRC
especially if XV really is a "grand finale"
all the bridge crew are... well, expendable
but at the same time
I feel like she's the least likely of the bridge crew
who's ready for elfnein to fuckin' die
I'll try to remember that people aren't always trying to be assholes
if you use *any* thinking emoji with me I will assume you're being a dick
In that case I will throw out a retroactive/futureactive apology
It's always the "Talking to you is a waste of time" emoji
but I never see people use it unironically
I know you were using it sarcastically
a new Kanade card has been released in XDU
I need to change mine up
on an avatar related note
It's an instant "I win" button in an internet argument
Which is why, thanks to the magic of the thinking emoji, you never have to
It's really, really not
It's a sign that discussion has stopped and that the other person has lost all respect for you
It's literally the "You said something I think is stupid therefore I win the argument"
I fucking hate the thinking emoji and all variations of it
Hot take
The weird amount of focus she got made me expect her to turn around and shank Hibiki or something
Big Coat Girl was cute
granted I watched the movie *one time* several years ago but it felt like they were trying to copy End of Eva without understanding *why* End of Eva did anything it did
and what even the fuck was the movie
00 kinda shit the bed yeah
and then the other one got blown up by the ship going up shortly thereafter
impaled and the bleed out in their space suit
Yeah didn't one of them get like
AKA the Important One
But not captain Milfpants
In the sense of "Oh, we're doing *this* character trope, hooooooooray"
And not in the sense of like "Wow this is a really hateable villain"
Gear seems to be continuing the tradition of having one villain that I just *hate*
"Hey Tsubasa, want some trauma with your trauma while we dredge up your trauma about your trauma?"
Yeah like
"*again*"
"Yeah let's just flash back to moments before she died"
That wasn't exactly how I was hoping to see Kanade come back though
Maria and Serena are featured *before* the season title card
I mean hell
I'm curious to see what they do with her
I will say though, I'm more interested in why Serena is featured so heavily in the OP
I thought it was Ogawa for a while
The only thing was I didn't know *who* it happened to
~~I basically had it already completely spoiled for me~~
Holy shit
AYY I GET TO ADD TO THE FOLDER
It'a like Galaxy Cross mixed with S1
These conert outfits
Oh shit
will we get some actual *canon* characterization for her this season
>Serena featured heavily in the OP
also
also holy shit guys but I think Kirika and Shirabe might be gay
Did Kirika really just turn Shirabe's buzzsaw into a fucking *Beyblade*
But
I wanted to wait until the end of the episode to give my full thoughts
Okay
~~it would have been better~~
well of course it would have been different
not the one person in the world she hates more than anything
But at *least* give Maria a character she *actually loves* (even if it's not for good reasons) to teach her about love
Like, I'll 100% cede the whole "tomatos and tough love" thing was trying to justify abuse
Instead of the man who wanted to forcibly breed her try to teach her about love
Imagine having had Mammu in Maria's head to help her with the LiNKER thing
You could literally have Nastassja fill both roles and have it make way more sense both in G and in future seasons
Why does Ver exist as a character
So like
Exactly
You could still even have her make the sacrifice play at the end
She's meant to be some sort of researcher with the heretical tech as well
She has a deeper emotional connection with FIS, which would explain their devotion to an otherwise insane plan
Even disregarding my personal hatred for Ver, I still think Mammu would have been a far better primary antagonist in G
He was full on nutso memelord by like G episode 8 or 9
Nah
At the *latest* after he fell down the cliff after Bikki beat the shit out of the Nephilim the first time
But he absolutely didn't make out out of G without becoming a meme
I'll give you that he wasn't a meme when he first shwed up
look what happened with G
Which hey
and would only get past the first step if everyone around him were braindead
A plan that would only make sense in the mind of a completely insane person
did you miss the part where he openly murdered children
He was mad the entire time
And people write off the first part because of the second
When your personality is "I want to rape Maria and make le funney faec"
It's easy to hate
but hey at least it was better than G's entire plot bending over and taking it up the ass to provide Ver with literally any chance to succeed
An asspull of a master plan
"this bitch" being Mill "My personality is murder" arc
and it was one note that didn't resonate with me
Cags was so extreme that she came off as one-note
The short version is he poorly handled, unconvincing, and had godawful motivations
I've given my Ver schtick so many times
G: Ver
GX: Garie
AXZ: Cags
XV: This bitch
Gear just has continually ended up with one character on the villain team that's just a pile of character archetypes I can't stand
I don't dislike all the villains
I'm just waiting for another flashback to Kanade disintegrating
KR is notoriously stingy over copyrights
fan nickname for Akira Tachibana
~~I'd take more topdad over more Ver~~
That's 100% gonna be psychological shit she has to deal with
Especially with whatever Invasion Lock or whatever it was called was
I do think he'll be a primary antagonist though, and we're gonna see the main cast butting heads with him all season
and with the overall tone of Gear it would be really strange for the final boss to not actually be a, well, boss
because I *seriously* doubt he'll be a combat character
I would be pretty shocked if he was the actual final villain
He has a logical place in the Gear world
He's a *good* villain
I'm just already sick of him
I'm not saying he doesn't
I'm already sick of Fudou's shit
At *minimum* FIS' motivation would have been more logical
But it would have made for more believable backstories and motivations
solve your birth rate problem
Japan, Symphogear forever
Symphogear makes babies
the takeaway from this is
Which is why fire forest got indefinite delay
The only reason gear would be delayed would be if a new episode heavily feature to fire
Yu-Gi-Oh guy
I think he was the S1 director at least
director of S1 and lead writer of subsequent seasons
~~except Kanade~~
the OP implies that Serena will be of some level of import
https://twitter.com/nbalnuae7/status/1152228120071532544
He famously did something similar to Millarc
DIO from jojo
https://twitter.com/kokonag222/status/1152224620176535553 ouch
It wasn't "We need to be able to do a unison when we have everybody deployed," it was "We need to be able to do a unison no matter who we send out or how many people are still standing"
Or Maria and Chris, who I think had literally said all the five words to each other prior to their mini-arc in AXZ
Tsubasa and Chris or Maria could probably bang out a unison with no prep, but Hibiki and Kirika?
They could split into groups but they couldn't do it with literally anyone
Tsubasa and Shirabe had hardly talked before their AXZ arc
Like
It was though
So...
The entire point of the training Arc was that they'd be able to do it with anybody on a dime, not to mention the fact that what ultimately ended up happening was one person from the main trio paired up with one person from the secondary trio
or if that was just supposed to be a momentary "she's too shocked to fight" thing
I'm curious to see what they do with that whole "lock" thing they did to her
Since apparently she's gonna be important as fuck this season
When are they gonna bring back Serena
but even the staff joke about how HibiMiku is basically an old married couple
I haven't seen Nanoha so I don't know what exactly it's like there
Hibiki and Miku kinda do that already
but I'd be pretty surprised if by the time *everything* is all said and done we don't get something relatively concrete for at least one couple
If they're willing to potentially give up future films and shit
if this really is a "grand finale"
with DMJii
They *might* do something like
"you"
"love"
"I"
it's easy
"It's hard to find the right words" bitch
recreate the "Perfect Being" from the gauntlet
Fifth Element up in this bitch
but then it just fuckin' turned into dust at the end of episode 2
I made a joke bet that the holy corpse wasn't actually dead, thinking it was going to resurrect/get up and be an antagonist
also I totally lost that bet about the holy corpse not actually being a corpse
Probably only one since it does look like he's trying to do something with/for the Custodians in order to "save" Japan
Yeah
turns out there's only actually two evil factions lol
I was wondering how they were gonna handle the alchemists *and* Fudou *and* the Custodians as all three as villains
Solves that issue
That
Well
Vanessa: "ROCKET PUNCH!"
Shirabe: "Wow, really?"
Kirika: "THAT IS SO COOL!"
I had no idea
... okay I was just randomly speculating about a DMJii fusion earlier
oh look, another instance where if an alchemist had literally said two sentences to a protagonist, they might have stopped some senseless violence
That was pretty great
WE ACTUALLY GOT RED HOT BLAZE?
HOLY SHIT
I know he's never gonna come back but he would be a fun supporting character
I'm loving the delinquent guy too
also the segway noise lmao
This is the greatest thing she's done in the series to date
>Chris has a revolver as her main weapon now
"My shit works because *you* think it works"
or in Phara's case
yeah that
Philo-
Fudou must know
since SONG knows
I would assume so
~~Genjuuro is gonna die~~
He could likely pull funding and shut them down with about as much effort as it takes Genjuuro to open a door
He basically has his foot on their throats
The way they talk to him and how the fact that SONG is practically a Kazanari organization
I think it'll be less an issue of "How long will they fall for it" and more "How will they get out from under Fudou's heel to do something about him"
I mean Fudou kind of is an "anime evil" version of Japan's extreme-right conservative xenophobes
That's *basically* what I was getting at
have been complicit in Fine's plans for the concert massacre and shit like that
watch Fudou like
Fudou is Tsubasa's father
Carbonization
which is going to be a sore spot forever for her
and it also indirectly insults Kanade
everything she's worked for
because it does kinda ruin like
For real though yeah Tsubasa's gonna be in a rough place after that
so
not "Fine"
Technically Fine's name is "Fee-nay"
I guess it'll start wholesome and end with Miku getting kidnapped and presumed dead or something
YameteTomete
no not youtube
same
GoodSubs came up earlier today
HorribleSubs are out like an hour or two after the broadcast
Yeah
giant revolvers
dual wielding
Like it felt way too specific to not be a shout-out
Which I know I've seen before
Yeah
now that she has more to her personality than "murder"
episode 3 made me dislike millarc less
oh yeah
That would be a trip
not necessarily ntr
She might be a child of rape as far as we know
We don't know any of the circumstances behind it
What happened to Tsubasa's mother?
also I have to wonder... where is swordmom?
Yatsuhiro
I keep forgetting it
Or whatever the other guy's name is
He fathered Tsubasa with Yatsunori's wife
and also her grandfather
That seemed a bit coincidental
I think she wasn't anticipating DMJii being there
it's less "out early" and more last week was "out late"
I would personally say that waiting to download would be better than trying to deal with shitty streams and unreliable data
How it used to be at least
Even without my VPN
Sounds like my internet sometimes
Why can't you download
Yes, I know you're in China
does your VPN have data caps or something?
What do you mean your VPN can't handle it
Realistically, last CharaSong slot is probably for Alchemists or Serena
LoliAlchemist Double
it's the bat signal
with millarc
the spotlight
guys
definitely tiddy guns
AlcaNoise were originally supposed to be "elite mooks" kinda
same
Kanade's back?
I would lose my shit
That's also happened every season since GX
yeah
the robot chick is great though
I don't particularly care for either of the alchemists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qByKEu0zdco
"Kirika seventeen people went to the hospital because of you."
"Well it's natural so that means it's healthy, right?"
Kanade would sell fake bathwater because she thinks it's funny
Maria would sell actual bathwater because she wouldn't figure out that you can just lie
Maria would sell bathwater to thirsty nerds
she kinda just got lucky
In her defense she wasn't trying to do a smart
Sekiro
guys
one of the funniest weeks on YouTube in a loooooong time
The week Getting Over It came out was like
Not gonna lie
https://twitter.com/rumirudia/status/1152691117407604736 this guy is the best new character in XV
Carol's minions were literally designed to die
I've never been overly fond of Shirabe's gear songs but at least the episode version of this new one is pretty damn good
Basa was gay as fuck for Kanade
Also what do you mean Basa not gay
Chris is Spaghetsexual
<@279341087494242304>
Doujins and shit like that
but I'd be willing to bet I have at least 90-95% of all the Kanade fanart that exists
or were posted and deleted
and some that are poorly tagged
Not all, there's some that are behind paywalls
I knew I had an actual image of them *fighting*
THERE WE GO

my god yes please

It gives us a bit of closure and more exposure to Kanade and Serena without bullshit resurrections and fucking with Maria and Tsubasa's developments/motivations
and gets to go back and tell Maria and Tsubasa how proud of them their deceased loved ones are
and has a conversation with Serena and Kanade
Would be somehow Hibiki dies
I think the best way to handle it
if she had any lines though it'd be the only time she's *spoken* outside of S1
please not as a villain
but not as a villain
I kinda hope so
Almost exactly 24 hours actually
also this
a lot of them 😦
Everything else from the other assorted flashbacks and cameos through the rest of the seasons
6,174 from S1E1
~~almost half of them come from S1E1~~
so 12,804
33 of those files are duplicates that I pulled out and put in their own folder that I thought were wallpaper-worthy

haven't pulled those yet
Not counting the very short flashback she had in XV Ep 2
12,804 frames
14.3GB
also yes
Kunyono in particular likes to post teasers and then make people pay for the whole thing
also Kirika isn't a loli
like it's *so* close that it has to be intentional
THIS IS WHERE I SAW BOOB RELOADING BEFORE
THIS CHICK
https://twitter.com/ZeroLesia/status/1152909637068345345 THIS
MARIA IS THE STRONGEST IN THE UNIVERSE BUT STILL DOESN'T DO CRAAAAAAAAAP
It's *possible* but extremely unlikely I think
just put it on the BDs
I don't need them in the show
Yeah, I'd be more than happy with them as BD specials
Ah yes, the wonderful dead character of *Miku*
would be amazing
a new Miku, Serena, and Kanade henshin in this style
for the off-trio
henshins in this style
give us
please please please animators
And I am so glad it tried to autofill "memes" as the next word
Also, I think that's the first time I've ever typed "dank" on my cell phone
It's the Thomas the Dank Engine music
The OP also implies she still has a bit of the Alchemic Gold left over from AXZ
While Kanade just never got an explanation of how her class worked and what abilities she was supposed to have
Shirabe basically got the Extra Life from Ready Player One from Fine
And Kanade, due to a different sort of Fine hacks
and all it took was some falling rocks to off Serena
It's why Maria can always get back up no matter how hard she gets hit and Kirika could survive a zesshou
everyone knows tiddy size directly correlates to defensive prowess
Not not surprised
I'd be horribly disappointed
I wouldn't even be surprised
as is Kiri's
Bikki's CD is out
Her CD isn't out yet, so the best you're gonna get is a clipped show version
Her music?
well that was fast
so it is
oh
later if you want the lossless, since Sheldonsuckz is behind and hasn't uploaded Kiri's yet
I'd suspect tomorrow evening at the earliest
so give it until the stores open in about 6 hours, plus time for people to actually buy it, rip it, format it, upload it, and host it
It's currently about 1AM in Japan
that emote being so yellow is weird
the tri-color dango typically consist of green, pink, and a white/off-white one
It's supposed to be white
I know
So the traffic light thing may be a case of *under*-localizing instead
They're not blue, they're green, but everyone says "blue"
~~traffic lights are red yellow and blue in Japan~~
not necessarily by anyone specifc
but that he got overruled
the most I've heard to that end was that Kaneko hated (and still hates) the idea
The whole "A shield? No! A *sword*!" scene
and for funsies in XDU they also gave Kanade Spear Orbit, which is basically Heaven's Wrath
Thousand Tears is basically Stardust Foton, yeah
~~though I wouldn't object to that~~
like dance-routine style dancing, not Kirika-style dancing
You could have her doing idol poses or sort of dancing as if on stage
Kanade did also mention that she really loves singing
I wouldn't be surprised if at one point Ame No Habakiri manifested as a spear or a very spear-like sword in the two years between Kanade's death and the main series tbh
Most notably the double-spinning-kick thing with her hands planted on the ground
Also if you watch the S1E1 fight carefully there's actually a few moves Kanade does that you see Tsubasa do later on
Yeah, you could have parts orbiting around and slapping on there
~~also Madoka~~
please
not today or tomorrow
like
Can we not
XDU really pushes the whole "space" theme with her attack names but idk how you'd incorporate that into a fighting style for a transformation
even G
but they keyframes and the actual *art* during it are nowhere *near* the quality of the later seasons
I love her original transformation, it looks really cool
because like
I'm just hoping against hope they'll add an official Kanade one as a BD bonus
The transformations in general having callbacks to S1 is nice
The XD Quest is over?
What? I thought we were still in the middle of the XD Quest
And maybe do some weird summer amalgamation with all the Swimphogears
Just do Zwei Wing, XD Miku/Edgebikki, XD Serena, Ver. Wingbeat, and then the Sun event
So it'd be pointless to have a second OVA that's 95% exactly the same
Not the they'd do everything
I'm operating under the assumption they'd only adapt a handful of events at best
Assuming we're only getting one shot at this I'd rather they just do ver. Wingbeat
Aren't the only differences between Sirius and ver. Wingbeat in the last couple nodes?
They could but 95% of the story is exactly the same
So they might as well just use that instead of the original
It's more like Event 2 ver. 1.1
"Event 3" isn't really event 3
And the new Triple-Gungnir Solar Event was basically what XDU had been building to and teasing since launch
The second event, despite basically being GX: Kanade Edition, is also well written (by XDU standards) and has one of the most popular designs from the game
And is also considered one of the best, if not the best, written events in the whole game
First of all, the first event introduces the Gjallhorn and the whole idea of the parallel universes and Alternate timelines
Honestly, not even trying to be biased, if they did want to adopt some of the XDU events, the Kanade-centric ones are actually probably the best options
Except with a giant fucking spear
You will be treated like a cunt
If you cannot be trusted not to be a cunt
I feel like I can expect the denizens of this server not to be cunts
I mean if you want to be a prick go ahead
I want to be surprised by it
***do not ping me***
*please*
please
if Kanade shows up
I got this channel muted
okay yeah like for real though
Yeah
Also looks like we're gonna get Noble Red to betray Fudou, that would be nice
I'm curious to see if the whole "Amalgam" thing has plot relevance or if it was just an excuse for a new gear design
sleep well
"Yeah lemme just check twitter for the new Kanade birthday images oh hey it's a picture of Saint Germain's name in the credits and oh hey a picture of her and Hibiki fighting together"
Saint Germain and the duet
if both Japanese and western Geah twitters hadn't shouted out spoilers to the high heavens
would have been a really cool unexpected twist
That
Well
Obviously he's the one making on-the-fly decisions when the gears are fielded, but from all we've seen, Fudou still has ultimate and absolute control over SONG
From what we've seen though, I have to wonder now how much of everything they did was actually Gen making command decisions
He might have "retired" but from everything we've been shown it was effectively a promotion
I'm assuming that Fudou is aware of who exactly was struck by the beam
I think it's less a question of what he kept secret and more question of how much Fudou was able to find out
He tries to force Tsubasa to use the bracer and it just kills her
Watch that be the big reason this is the grand finale
gimmick? Point? idk
Twist wasn't really the right word
So Hibiki - and by extension, Miku - could safely use it
I'm assuming the twist with the brace is it kills you unless you're "pure"
I wonder if we'll see the others use similar golden armaments
The famous "waterfall in my pants" scene was early GX
I'm not sure if they'll openly oppose him, but Hibiki clearly planted the seeds of doubt against the idea that working with Fudou is the *only* path forward
~~and then we can have another pointless mini-arc about not having enough LiNKER for FIS to actually do anything~~
Honestly even though he would never win, just purely for narrative reasons, Gen vs Fudou would be super fun to watch
Not necessarily following, just that he wasn't actually in control like the audience and the characters were lead to believe
100% Fudou is gonna kill at least one of Noble Red in front of Hibiki
Yeah
you gotta be gentle
you can't just rip a girl's tailplug out like that
also Hibiki
Onee-San 16 is great
for as neutral as I am on the other two Noble Reds
I gotta say
making a musclegirl anime would be the fringe of the fringe
anime companies cater to the fringe
I mean
And though it's not directly shown, it's a pretty safe assumption that at least Hibiki works out on a very regular basis
They're doing a lot of physical activity on a pretty constant basis
They eat a lot, but they're also active military personnel
The way I imagine it happening would be if Hibiki died
But this show has shown that emotion trumps science at times
Kanade's fragment was erased by SSJ, yeah
and gets to relay information to Tsubasa
Somehow *Hibiki* gets a chance to talk to Kanade
I really do think the best way they could bring Kanade back without retreading would be to have it be through Hibiki
so it's not exactly gonna be a surprise
that being said, I know Twitter's gonna go ape if she shows up
I'd rather it be a surprise
I would prefer not to know, yeah
after she gets a pep-talk
and then get another, "real" version later
sort of like Ignite versions
a "dark" Tsubasa henshin scene
Yeah I almost imagine we'll have like
yeah rip no Kanade on KanaDay
~~at this point I'd half expect a Kanade transformation in this style to just flat-out be porn~~
I didn't even blink lmao
I just rewatched Hellsing Ultimate where the bad guys regularly burst into flame after dying
Why is That?
Cat on the Dog
HibiMiku has points against it because Hibiki is the main character so making her canon gay would be a really bold move
I'd honestly think DMJii would be first to be completely confirmed
TsubaMari is the least likely to get made canon
That's reassuring at least
Ah, I hadn't heard that
if they really do mean for XV to be the finale and that's the end of it, I wouldn't be surprised if they actually kill someone
like
I think a lot of it is that XV is really truly meant to be the end and they're less afraid and don't have to worry about future seasons and merch
It's not a matter of SONG making the absolutely dumbest possible decisions
Like, Noble Red are actually thinking tactically
Yeah
that and like Phara's sword breaker and the new pyramid thing
Gungnir *is* a philosophical weapon after all
I'd buy in a heartbeat that they could converse with the deceased if Hibiki died and then got rezzed
and not only do they both trump science, but emotions trump magic
But yeah, Gear is a show that's shown that emotions and magic trump science
can we not do the Ver bullshit again
Just *one day*
like
Can we not
Died and then in the afterlife got a chance to talk to her
>starts singing
>lands
>immediately explodes and the music stops
The aborted song
Oh I did laugh in today's episode
so I doubt we'll get much of him
IIRC his whole arc went over really poorly even with the Japanese fans
I think the little mention at the beginning of the season is all we're gonna get
look what our little cinnamon bun turned into
Chris' partner is the fans
Chris is designated waifu
B) due to the KyoAni situation, the whole broadcast schedule got scrapped
A) no one was subbing it because the dub was getting ripped instead
Gonna have to wait, Kaliks
~~isekais in general are pretty much purely bad~~
AXZ is gonna end up like G as the "Okay" season
Yeah
People don't talk about it as much because most people don't *dislike* G
The thing with G is it's very few peoples' *least* favorite season
Not universal, no, but I'd venture it's the most commonly held opinion
S1 is pretty widely considered the best season
What's a first?
Next episode will probably big lore/infodump to move us into part 2 of the plot followed by more information pertaining to whatever is happening to Tsubasa, maybe with her henshin and a fight there
"So Hibiki's just gonna solo the final boss again?"
"Looks like it."
"I made bentos, anybody want one?"
"We can't get out of these forcefields."
"Alright well I've got food if you're hungry after Hibiki's done saving the day all by herself."
Only Hibiki gets to do things
This is post-GX Symphogear
Serena would be younger than Maria but older than Tsubasa IIRC
There are barbers, but Kanade doesn't trust them
They should though
No
~~I'm still mad that XDU refuses to update her design and only uses the S1 design or Brisingamen~~
I really would have loved to see how Kanade's design and Gungnir would have changed
In the two-year interim he got ripped
Genjuuro was fit but not jacked during the concert
also yes
You know, Fudou being part/descended from Custodians would also somewhat justify the ridiculous shit we see Genjuuro do
who's the big bad then lmao
It'd be a great twist if Fudou was just like "Yes my bloodline is pure I am perfect" and he puts it on and just fucking dies
AKA Miku or Hibiki
That it needs to be placed on a "pure" being to be fully activated
I'm assuming it wasn't activated properly
wtf am I typing
he's could
so he's could do something with it
Fudou also presumably has the bracer
Did you miss the Japanese goverment holding an 11 year old at gunpoint bit at the end
I wasn't very fond of Cags either
Prelati's design overall wasn't that good
were those supposed to be upgraded versions or a super mode or something
story-wise what were those supposed to be
idk how long though
It'll stay up for a while probably
Is Shirabe's CD not out yet
Wait
I'm just out that money now
We could have found another arrangement
<@583826941405298719> check your PMs please
I saw a box set of JoJo Part IV *DVDs* - not even Blu-rays - and the store had it priced at like 35k
$250+ for a box set of 13 episodes is fucking stupid
I... don't know? I don't think so, I'm able to rip CDs with no trouble, but I've never tried to directly play one in a CD player purchased in the west
Yeah
The problem is getting the sleeve is nearly impossible
Actually, getting the CD itself isn't the hard part
Which, honestly, because Kanade's CD was a Blu-ray bonus and the sleeve for it was a sales bonus from a specific store, is about the closest I'll ever get to actually owning Kanade's CD
For now I picked up Hibiki and Kirika, as well as the Metatonia single and the Zwei Wing single
So I'll come back next weekend
They said they will get more though
And the staff book too
It's not actually the manga, it's the AXZ artbook
THEY GOT THIS THOUGH
But no Shirabes
They've got a bunch of the other two
Evidently they're *sold out*
I see it there but I'm trying to buy the CD here
Where the shrb cd
Animate what u doin
as far as I recall at least
She'll throw double-edged swords but when she herself is swinging it it's nearly always single-edged
Traditionally yes
when I downloaded it it was written as "ken"
Sora e... is special to me but I understand why some people might not like it
I like her AXZ songs and Beyond the Blade is pretty good
that electric shamisen breakdown in the middle of Gekko no Ken is SO good
her G A-side
Gekko no Ken is still my favorite Basa song
an 8/10 at minimum
Like, none of them are my *favorite* but I'd put them all at like
Chris has had the most consistently high-quality songs tbh
I wouldn't say Ayahi is underperforming
Yoko's not exactly a bad singer
yeah
and Maria's
My faves are Kanade's songs
I like the duets but they don't have the same emotional impact for me
My top 10 is probably mostly solos
I was really excited to hear those
I think people were just happy to have off-partner duets
the songs themselves are good but not special
I like the idea
the music doesn't match the tempo of the music at all
which is why X-Edge's ignite is so bad
but the fact that it's the regular song's vocals applied to different music makes it ehhhhhhhh
If they'd rerecorded the vocals it'd be a different story
Yeah
I'd even venture that Ignite Just Loving X-Edge is the only actually *bad* song in the series
And Ignite Just Loving X-Edge is the worst song in the series
Are *universally* worse than the originals
The Ignite Versions, while not bad
Hot take
Sorry, had a couple beers tonight
err, after G
Did we have B-sides sung in-series after S1
They're clearly not the big bad, but they're also clearly *doing* things
The idea of them being "fakeout villains" died pretty fast
Yeah
just not very well
Especially because while they *are* weak, they *can* face the gears in open combat
I like the idea of smart-but-weak villains
Bikki showed them that a better option existed
They were originally taking the unsavory option, assuming it was the only option
Hibiki showed them an alternative
AXZ alchemists were also convinced that the only way forward was with Adam, despite not liking him
"Why not try something else?" and then when the bad guys try to kill them *and fail* the bad guys are forced to confront different ideals
while the Gears can be like
A whole lot of "Agree with me or I kill you" leads to not having a lot of having their ideals challenged
They haven't really been *challenged*
but they've also been kinda stewing amongst themselves for most of that time
yeah they're old as fuck and have been around for ages
also tbh I feel like the villains getting their motivations changed suddenly is that they don't get their ideals questioned
and Shirabe and Tsubasa show up to fucking execute her
but she was also not actively trying to harm the gears at the time, more just tyring to get them to piss off
Like she was clearly antagonistic to the gears and she was causing mayhem
Becuase Prelati was clearly distracted and upset and didn't actually *start* trying to fight them
The entire Prelatic fight felt terrible
The gears being suddenly willing to *kill* did feel weird
and I really didn't like the whole copout "Actuall Cags saved the day just to suicide later"
The Alchemist fights were kinda subpar
I might be misremembering but I could have sworn she at one point actively dove underwater for the express purpose of fellating him and was disappointed not to find a dick
She *wants* to be Adam's sexbot
And Tiki Is Also Here!
with a *lot* of missing numbers in between
Micha being first and Garie being last
or something to that tune
37 (Garie)
22 (Leiur)
12 (Phara)
3 (Micha)
IIRC the model numbers are like
Sounds to me like a lot of failed attempts
model no. 37 or something
Wasn't Garie like
also limited power
Presumably creating them isn't an exact science
The autoscorers are also numbered
The autoscorers were never supposed to defeat the gears
~~which would have been easier to do if Mammu had fucking been in charge instead of Ver~~
She needed to earn it better
Literally
But
The whole "wanting so badly to succeed but simply not being good enough" hits home in ways I rather don't like
I appreciate Maria's arc a lot
Like
His plan was so reliant on everyone else being fucking morons and on Maria not having the stones to actually *do* anything
and then relied *purely* on luck and plot contrivance
episode 1
Ver had a plan that went out the window in like
Carol's plan broke because the writers needed to force the worst part of the show back in
Ah, yeah, that's true
she had an actual plan
but
It was a stupid fucking plan
Carol had a plan
I mean
But no one can control them until the Cane was activated
but Fine can also manually summon them
They *can* just randomly manifest
That too
She had the cane but it wasn't activated at the time pretty sure
summon yes, control no
IIRC
yeah
I think her parents were on some sort of research trip/archaeological thing
Wasn't her hometown I'm pretty sure
With "kills Kanade's family" somewhere after manifesting but before acquiring Chris
So the order of events
Fine manifests
Acquires cane
Acquires Chris
Zwei Wing massacre
Activates cane
Main plot of S1
No worries
I thought it was the news that she got kidnapped
Oh, I might be misremembering that then
Since that was the headline news Miku's dad was reading
And she got Chris shortly before the Zwei Wing concert
I think she got the cane before she got Chris, because didn't she get Chris in order to activate the cane?
I know 3.5's actual story relevance amounted to little more than a throwaway line at the beginning of AXZ, but it might be nice to get a full translation on that eventually if there's juicy lore tidbits in there
also specifically only the story one, not the event
so take it with a grain of salt
but the only *canon* XDU material is the 3,5 story
also idk where that was stated in XDU
Millarc doing to herself what she did to that girl onto Hibiki's fist would be a great way to both avoid having to redeem her and give Hibiki some more trauma
At *worst* someone will (accidentally?) suicide onto Hibiki's fist or something
😛
The odds of Hibiki intentionally taking a *human(-like) life are microscopic
I'm just hoping they've restocked on Shirabe CDs when I go back this weekend and they're not sold out of Chris ones
She got the startingest of inklings of starting to tell papa fudou to fuck off
Genjuuro goes into combat against Tsubasa and she kills him
yeah
there's not any armor, it's basically just redesigned undergears
as a *combat* form
yeah it was a cool one-time thing but
*Unlimited*
Drive
X
New version of XD
probably not an episode she is *entirely* absent for
Probably episodes with minimal Tsubasa
And that frame is moments before Tsubasa completely breaks
inb4 that's The Dust Formerly Known As Genjuuro
also looking at those preview images I can't believe XV episode 5is when Symphogear finally just turns into yuri hentai
Okay *now* it's Saturday'
and it was like "Holy shit, that's fucking Rebecca Black"
Happened to be visiting at the time of his graduation
She went to the same school as one of my cousins
I WAS AT REBECCA BLACK'S MIDDLE SCHOOL GRADUATION
FUN FACT
also chillax it's not even Saturday in Japan yet
Someone needs to remake the "Friday..." Jojo meme with Geahs
Ghostnutbuster
LOL
Hibiki: "Landmi-" [explodes]
Tsubasa: "LANDMINE-" [explodes]
Chris: "Landmi-?" [explodes]
Maria: "LAN-" [explodes]
Kirika: "Landmines-de--" [explodes]
Shirabe: "Landm-" [explodes]
Genjuuro: "Holy shit they planted landmines!"
---
Vanessa: "Oh good, they found the landmines."
Millarc: "They planted *landmines*? We walk our cat out there..."
Elsa: "Nyaa~"
surprise Elfnein combat mode
It *is* Millarc's blood
You know what twist I could possible see there?
Actually
That'd be a twist
yeah
and also data will be a hot commodity
There are ways, but they're largely more effort than they're worth
Yeah
Never know when new art of her might pop up
for Kanade
Twitter is mandatory
Sadly
I'm gonna have wifi but I'm gonna be restricted to my phone is the thing
yeah
I'm going on vacation so I'm not gonna be able to watch the show this week or next
this cliffhanger
also fuck me I'm gonna have to sit on this for like two and a half weeks
inb4 Miku's *actually* just fucking dead and there's no closure
yeah
[stares in Stroganoff]
Yeah
we better fuckin' get that on the soundtrack
Elfnein song was cute
I mean she probably just got kidnapped so
yeah
Like they explained some more shit about what was going on but there wasn't actually a lot of *progress*
~~though tbh I feel like not a lot actually happened in this episode~~
The whole time she was going through that rage I was thinking "We haven't seen Hibiki in a conspicuously long time"
also tbh I was expecting that last Noise she skewered to the wall to be Hibiki for a hot second
either hers or Maria's
I think Basa's henshin is my favorite so far
What's behind Hibiki looks... unfortunately familiar

also I noticed something concerning with the title splash
"Nyaa!"
"Don't talk to me or my daughter or my cat ever again"
like it'd be a bigger plot twist if she *didn't*
so Millarc shanked the psycho, right
I'm assuming the call from Vanessa was basically her saying "Fuck it, I'm taking a gamble on Hibiki being able to save us"
I say 80% chance the blood is the psycho pervert, 10% chance it's Elfnein, 10% chance it's Millarc
Is that why the volume changes so much for some of the BD soundtrack CDs
and I think it's a week delay so first week sep
Basa CD is #6 IIRC
https://twitter.com/kokonag222/status/1158371972226568192 Bavarian Rhapsody
And of course the Autoscorers, but zero chance of them being playable before Carol
He's basically the only other named combatant that hasn't been added
lol
Ogawa?
Who is she beating
Combat Elfnein with Carol's singing voice would be great
Yeah
~~this breakdown also kinda lends itself to my theory that Genjuuro is going to die by Tsubasa's hand~~
I was expecting Hibiki
I'd be happy if the final attack is a HibiMiku unison
and that Miku was kinda just *there* and wasn't important to their plan
I'm pretty sure they all but explicitly stated Elfnein was the target
10% chance it's Millarc's blood and A New Challenger Approaches
10% chance it's Elfnein's blood as she tried to take the hit for Miku
80% chance it's the pervert inspector and the phone call we only got one half of was Vanessa saying "Fuck it, we're betraying Fudou and taking a gamble on Hibiki"
That's by far the most likely option
With Combat Carolnein fucking her up
This is why there's speculation that the splash of blood at the end of ep 5 is Millarc's
that line about tingling below the belly wasn't just her being horny, it was a reference to a specific type of scorpion that's venom causes a tingling sensation in your intestines just before they shut down
Carol's out there living her best life as a scorpion in the middle of the fucking desert
she can live freely
liiiiiiiiiiiiving her life now
She's liiiiiiiiiiiiiiive
https://twitter.com/CUB_M1911/status/1157907248703606785
Either way I hope my Animate still has copies by the time I get back from vacation
I know leaks and all but they're usually not *this* early
I'm confused how the full version is already out when it doesn't release until firday
ngl my "top songs" list is basically Kanade's songs, then Maria's songs, then everything else
I really love MAria's songs
Fine > AXZ Alchs > Adam > Carol > Nastassja > Topdad > The Noise that killed I-Don't-Want-To-Die-Chan > Ver
https://twitter.com/irotoricotori/status/1158772232476168192
I can't wait for the single
Speaking of EDs, Last-ing Song is a banger and a fucking half
That's why Vit is my favorite finale
Just please for the love of all things holy *don't* make it another Broly/Spirit Bomb "Give all your power to Hibiki!" moment
I agree, I think Miku dying might be the one thing that would drive Hibiki to kill
I liked it but it was weird
it sounded like Kiri music but not Kiri voice
yeah I was confused
I consider the songs to be part of the source material
I repeat
I consider the songs to be part of the source material
In the case of Gear, though
(spoilers: it includes not one but *multiple* fucking *stage plays*)
Normally I would agree - as someone who *loved* NieR Automata, the amount of out-of-game bullshit you need to track down to get the 100% complete story is inane
With how they like to do shitty memes they'd probably make Ver Maria's stand
Serena's in literally the first scene of the OP
and only one hour
Only on one channel
wait is it 25:00 or 25:30
on saturdays
Usually it's 25:30 JST
It'd be really hard to not drop Gear if they force Ver back in *again*, much less if they give him a major important plot role
please don't
it still doesn't feel right when I say it
I did that to myself with the word "vest" when I was like 8
he still hated it but he got it
When I wrote it down with punctuation and explained the use of the perfect tenses he got it
Yeah
He got so angry
I taught one of my higher-level students about the "James, while John had had 'had,' had had 'had had'; 'had had' had had a better effect on the teacher" thing
I don't blame you
It's pronounced "Ker-nel"
No
The list goes on
epitome
By that logic any language is classist because getting a higher education means learning more of said language
Yeah it's all one guy
so less potential backlash
DMJii are less "important"/marketable
HibiMiku are "basically married anyways" and is also the *main character*
Honestly I think DMJii are the likeliest couple to kiss
I wouldn't mind being inside Vanessa <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Yeah, I'm betting the most likely option is Vanessa telling Millarc that Noble Red is putting all their eggs in the Hibiki basket
There's no official betting pool but the general guesses are that it's most likely the inspector, small possibility of Elfnein, and small possibility that it's Millarc due to A New Challenger Approaches
A few of them have been artists just deciding that they like the outfit, but to my knowledge all of the commissions are from one person
Or Miku getting kidnapped or something
Hell, if it was particularly gruesome, she might make that face over the inspector
The odds of them actually killing Miku are still microscopic, and I could see Elfnein making that face at several things Millarc could have done
I'm just kinda glad there *wasn't* a Kanade appearance in this episode since I would have been pissed if I'd had that spoiled by some dumbass pinging me in this channel
which kinda implied the return of Durdabla
Harp was not, but the context of Carol coming back made it sound like it was a combat thing
but it still would have been kind of a nice "WTF" surprise
Carol coming back had been hinted at since the beginning of AXZ
Since I got pinged and then someone immediately started asking about Kanade in one of the other channels
I was half-expecting that for the random ping I got in this channel
pouty Serena is cute as all fuck
More name-dropping Kanade giving me hope we'll see her again even if briefly
more boxing Maria
Ninja Car
also turns out the silver thing the scorpion was crawling on is the original Airgetlamh relic, interesting
Yeah it's a pretty good thing I didn't fucking touch Twitter while I was on vacation
~~I really enjoyed watching Garie die again, and actually just losing this time~~
the Autoscorers coming back took me by surprise
Despite having Carol's return thoroughly spoiled
Alright
It's like when a dachshund is mad - you want to respect the fact that it's upset but it's kinda just more cute than anything
ANGERY ELFNEIN
https://twitter.com/drinkolive/status/1162763272895885312 speaking of GX album art
Carolnein solo duet
so if that *is* what they're leaning on then fuck yeah
was "Still Elfnein, she just sings with Carol's voice"
My "ideal"
Honestly
Inorin's voice is so fucking good
I'm stoked as *fuuuuuuuuuck* we're getting more Carol music
That said
I noticed the lion lol
I thought I noticed something, but I didn't see that it was the autoscorers
They're using shit to build bridges between pre-existing content
just... some things
They're not pulling new shit out of their asses for *everything*
I think even having the ideas goes a long way
in fact I was kinda surprised when the giant tentacle baby *wasn't* her
well I think Miku is gonna BECOME AS GODS
"Elfnein when was the last time you ate?"
"... ate?"
"You know, food?"
"Oh so THAT'S why my stomach is making weird noises and hurts so much"
raw slices/chunks of tomato is not good
Tomato flavor/sauce/paste/etc is good
The way they changed the outline colors looked a lot like an S1 zesshou
also I really liked the effect they did when Tsubasa was getting mindfucked
since her last will in GX was basically trying to atone for her fuckup and she was actively defending Elfnein in this one
I sincerely doubt Carol will attempt to be evil
She'd be younger than Kanade
third
~~Chris ate like that because she was used to not having enough food as a child~~
But the fact that they shoehorned him into GX and AXZ means he's coming back for XV
like he *should have been* after G
let him be gone
Nah, don't even bring his likeness or the neph back in
holy shit please do not force his stupid ass back into the show again
I would trade a Kanade cameo for no Ver
I hope to god Ver doesn't come back
I don't enjoy Millarc very much and Elsa, while not *bad*, is kinda just... *there* a lot
in XV the only one I really like *as a character* is Vanessa
as characters I liked FIS more even in G though
That's fair
but they easily top the autoscorers and the AXZ alchemists
I'm not sure they're better than FIS for me
Eh
like any time she's in the background she's making a funny face
Elsa honestly has great facial expressions
"We here at Noble Red do not condone child violence. We do, however, find it hilarious."
which will give her some form of magitech power armor
but she'll almost certainly have some interaction with the relic
I doubt Miku will get a new gear
It could have literally instantly solved any issue they had just by deleting relics
SSJ was brutally OP in the context of Symphogear as a story
They even had the "God Slaying Fist" title in XDU unlocked by using Kanade
With more reused S1 footage
Kanade did appear already, for like 2 seconds in episode 2
If we get three seasons of Ver cameos playing important roles in the plot and not a single voiced Kanade scene after S1 I'm gonna fuckin riot
Unless it's an animation error it implies it's at minimum some sort of hybrid and not fully Carol
and she also didn't transform into an adult
It's Carol's singing voice but as pointed out, the eyes are different
if it's just Carol going "Alright, you're useless, let me drive" then it's just another case of Elfnein not actually being allowed to do things
Because if it's Elfnein using Carol's power, it means Elfnein *actually gets to do something* for once
I really hope it is actually Elfnein
actually I just had another thought about the whole Elfnein/Carol thing
Fine was the only one who actually knew how to *make* a gear
at *best* an alchemist might be able to construct a Faust Robe or a Faust Robe-like relic fragment device
It was scaffolding for a structure they *might* get to build
Like I said earlier, I think a lot of it was stuff that they threw out that "It could be throwaway nonsense or if we get more seasons it's something we could use later"
Pretty widely agreed-upon that Hibiki's arc in GX was unnecessary at best
Lasting Song is great
I'll have to go pick it up with the Maria CD this weekend
Definitely just hype, but at the very least I'll get some sort of mention or cameo in the OVAs
probably not, probably just coincidence
I wonder if that'll have anything to do at all with the season
Ctrl-X, Ctrl-V
XV is the cut-paste command pair
Weird random thing I just noticed
might as well go all the way with it
Elfnein already isn't allowed to accomplish anything
lmao
Shem-Ha is
You're right, Miku isn't the final boss
that song was fucking ACE too holy shit
that was great
Best moment was definitely the whole "blocking behind her without even looking/raising a hand" moment
Like literally not even trying
speaking of Singing I know I said it already but seeing Carol just effortlessly curbstomp Noble Red was great
which historically has been "I'm above silly things like 'singing'" in Gear
idk, Shem-Ha seems to be of the "god" type
But Miku being the final boss and having to find a way to kill Shem-Ha *without* killing Miku could be the primary conflict for the rest of the season
Even something like a TTGL scenario would be way, way ballsier than anything Gear has done since S1
But I would be *shocked* if they had the balls to flat-out kill Miku
I mean I could see Miku being the final boss
Now we get symmetrical docking in XV
we had asymmetrical docking in GX
also lmao
So that might be where they call it good
they already gave the one obligatory "Flashback to just before she died"
~~still holding out hope for a voiced Kanade cameo but with the remaining episode count dwindling and still no evidence for what Serena's role is going to be I'm not as confident~~
If Miku's just fucking dead we riot
this shit is not okay
you see this shit
compared to X-Drive
They already pulled Amalgam and Amalgam, while cool, is not visually impressive or thematically relevant for anyone other than Hibiki
How's this shit gonna get more intense
They went X-Drive in episode fucking eight
but anyways
which I suppose I *really* should know better by now
and expected people to abide by the spoiler policy
I just used Discord
I didn't either
but it would have been a nice "Oh *shit*" moment
Like yeah it was foreshadowed to hell and back
That reveal would have been a lot more hype if I hadn't known it was coming though tbh
Watching Carol style all over Noble Red was great
I'm not comfortable with all the Miku flashbacks in the credits
I'm not a fan
The Amalgams just look like Star Trek dresses tbh
Hibiki was/is just the only one who's *fought* with it
No, everybody did it
as I said before, it's visually unimpressive and doesn't thematically fit anyone except Hibiki
I really hope Amalgam isn't the "Let's win" power-up
please no
They looked pretty but they didn't do anything
I'm not holding out hope for anything better than "Everyone give Hibiki your power and then do fucking nothing *again*!"
and now that Miku is an enemy
I mean seeing as GX and AXZ have decided to throw away the whole "Let's work together" prevailing theme of *the entire franchise*
~~added to the reasons the GX finale was fucking garbage~~
Glorious Break
but we do know Tsubasa's CD *was* pushed back to *after* this episode
afaik we don't know
because that was fucking great
also was that whole eurobeat leadin part of the opening to Tsubasa's B-side
she *shouldn't* come back
and as much as I would be *so* happy to see her return
as much as I joke about it
For real though
Everyone's happy and alive yay the end
Plot twist: Kanade is the final boss and it's a friendly triple-Gungnir sparring match
He might be the final boss as in the final antagonist, but I have growing doubts he'll ever actually personally *fight*
I genuinely don't see Fudou as a *combat* threat
so it should still have the relic-fucking capabilities
but point is, this *is* a modified version of SSJ
Ah
wait where was that said
somehow
Since they made clear the fact that this *is* Shenshoujing
Worst-case scenario, Gungnir gets destroyed
She can't raise herself to actually cold-cock Miku so she just gets her ass kicked
Hibiki gets bitch-slapped
Though I'll give you the cut to the tiddies was a little too long
I liked the giant laser
"See, this new form is SO MUCH BETTER even XD couldn't touch her"
It cheapens XD now but also hypes up whatever they accomplish later
because titties
But it was still so much "Let's just sit back and let Hibiki solo"
The only reason it was better than GX was because becoming friends with the Alchemists had been Hibiki's personal goal throughout AXZ
Test was baaaaaaaaad
It's like Symphogear's Fancy Dress Uniforms
It's not a combat deisgn
it's not *cool*
but again
I don't dislike the design
but it's not *cool*
I like the *idea*
6 henshins of "CONDITION GREEN" having a 3-frame payoff of "CONDITION RED" is all we're gonna get
sadly
not the wielder
Condition Red is about the condition of the Gear
I half expected Carol to flat out merc millarc
Pull a fuckin' Doc Strange up in this bitch
She believes it therefore it's true
Is what will save Miku
*Hibiki herself*
Not a Symphogear
Not Gungnir
Thus she *is* the thing that can save Miku
She believes herself to be the thing that can save Miku
Hibiki herself is a philosophical weapon
Calling it now
>gen dies
>chris: "DADDY!"
>everyone else: "CHRIS WTF"
I like Uncle Half-Brother Papa Genjuuro
but I think he's gonna die
I hope Gen doesn't die
it's literally the SSJ waveform
It is SSJ
~~still think forcing Tsubasa to kill him would be the great "You work for me now" Fudou could pull~~
but he's gonna die if he actually fights
He's gonna go out being an utter fucking badass
If Genjuuro takes the field, he's gonna bite it
so I kinda hope he doesn't
Gen is gonna die when he fights
Summon their gears out of literally nothing
and they have to fight with The Songs In Their Hearts
inb4 all girls get their gears destroyed
MORE THAN MAKING XD POINTLESS
ACTUALLY
Gear with Time Travel for an actual 9-gear zesshou
Airgetlamh Hibiki
They're making a big deal out of Airgetlamh
and Hibiki has to fight with only The Song In Her Heart for the rest of the show
I genuinely wouldn't be surprised if Gungnir, as a Symphogear, just gets fucking wrecked
like
I'm not sure if Gungnir is gonna survive the next episode
The way you phrased that is tickling me something fierce
so clearly one namey boi
Well it's anime
and saving a single named character
with a song and some handholding
Te same way they redeem everyone in Gear
and just fuck in prison into eternity
They live in "solitary" together for the rest of their days
and Gear's gonna be like "Fuck yeah you's a good person!"
she's going to get one moment of "Yeah I killed 70k people but like I sacrificed myself to save Elfnein so I'm a good person right"
Millarc is heading straight toward redemption equals death
yeah
I doubt she'll actually kill someone but she'll definitely get a good, clean, "unexpected" hit on somebody
I'm definitely expecting Tsubasa to turncoat at some point
Yeah
but
of course no one actually buys it
to make us "think" she's gone
the montage is the bait
just a lil bit
he seems to have a tiny bit of an ego
He's Fudou
and FIS are literally unharmed in the next scene
to the point where even Tsubasa and Chris are bleeding from the face in one scene and then clean the next
if FIS can Zesshou without saying a fucking word
There is *no point* to LiNKER even being *mentioned* anymore
*once again proves that LiNKER is literally not worth being a thing*
Fucking trivializing zesshous *to that level*
I literally have the CDs on my desk, unopened
I actually haven't listened to any of them yet haha
Local Girl Becomes Gay God
Yeah I'd count that
I read it as just "SSJ returns"
and Hibiki sure as shit didn't punch her
Miku is God
The Baby wasn't God
No
we got docking, honorary no more, jobbers, and jam all in one episode
I found Maria's CD in Bangkok actually but it was like 50% more expensive so I didn't get it
hopefully not out of stock like with the Shirabe CD that first week
to get Maria's charasong CD and the Lasting Song single
off to Animate
tomorrow
never as a direct comparison
I've seen it before, but only as speculation
and also *clearly* fucking
But DMJii are *clearly* a thing
ant TsubaMari is arguabley not actually a thing
HibiMiku is kinda just accepted as a thing
honestly I think DMJii are the most likely to kiss
let DMJii jkiss
Perfectly fine with that
I'd take just Carol or Just Maria over Just Hibiki
Let it be literally anything other than *just* Hibiki
it could be Bikki and Shirabe for all I fucking care
is
I don't care how many gears it
let the final attack be literally *anything* other than "Throw our power at Hibiki"
For lthe love of god
the final shot in the OP of the scorpion is clearly climbing over the original Airgetlamh rleic
as does Aigetlamh itself
Maria and Serena both geature heavily in the OP
the question is just what it is
Airgetlamh has an impotnat role to plau
She has to Save The Day
But she's the Main Character
in GX, with Leiur's little sister IIRC
if he wins, he'll solve the end of season conflict
if he loses (which he will), it'll be disappointing
Genjuuro *actually* fighting has been so hyped up
At this point
The thing is
WHY DIDN'T I JUST WISH FOR IMMORTALITTYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
[thirty seconds later]
I WISH TO BE RESTORED TO THE PRIME OF MY YOUTH
I like how Maria pulled out <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Like they say shit married couples would not say
The songs are *crazy* direct and clear for Japanese
so the kiss sseeems more reaosnbable
but the actual events of it meant next to nothing
like... it had grand plot importance
Yeah the whole godbikki thing was the closest Gear had to filler
Too busy with life and too not wanting to watch Kanade die over and over again
I haven't actually rewatched Gear since G
S1 is really solid for an anime original from 7+ years ago
And then on the rewatch you start to notice plot holes and pacing issues and other stuff
Because the first time you're kind of in that half-brain-off mode where it's like "Yeah I Can talk about it but at the same time shiny explosions and singing"
Gear in general is worse on a rewatch
Because "lol we have to make the actual fucking moron almost win"
G is a series of good ideas executed poorly
G was good during but not after
wasting 4 episodes breaking the gears and 4 more with the Ignite arcs was just bad
it takes way too much time to deal with problems
GX is paced so poorly I can't give it a good rating
S1 = XV > G > AXZ >>>> GX
the Ignited versions were *not*
Carol's songs were *really* good
sometimes it just takes a lot longer than is necessary
Everything is always relevant to the overall story
We've had bad pacing but never filler
something something GX's plot changed halfway through the season because Kaneko's dad died
and no impression is worse than a negative impression
like I'm sure it looked nice but it left 0 impression on me
and Shirabe at the bottom as I literally don't remember it
Kirika being cool but excessively fanservicey
Maria being my favorite living character
Bikki being really cool and having a lot of effort put into it
On the basis that I remember actively liking Chris and Basa
I would say Chris/Basa > Bikki > Maria > Kirika > Shiraber
~~I would kill in cold blood for a properly animated XV-style Kanade henshin~~
THE BEST HENSHIN WAS KANADE'S IN S1
especially oversized revolvers
so Chris gets extra points
I am a sucker for revolvers
Tsubasa or Chris probably
He's a half-step above goblin slayer goblins
The rest would not be palatable
AXZ especially where his entire role was to prevent Elfnein from actually being useful and give Maria an important advisor in the form of a wannabe rapist
just a problem
Not a hilarious problem
No
Np
*especially* AXZ
GX and AXZ ver only made it worse
G ver was a problem
liking Ver is one of them
There are cases where opinions are wrong
You are wrong
using him at all is awful
Ver is fundamentally awful
There's really not
Fuck him, just make him gone
Let him rest?
Having a voiced/important Ver role in XV would have me genuinely considering dropping Gear
~~both GX and AXZ would be improved massively simply by not inlcluding Ver~~
and none of the creepiness
and accomplished all of the same things with a more believable FIS motivation
you could have just had Nastassja
Literally
Like
Ver having a point and Ver being necessary were two entirely different things
please fucking no
but of the single-girl songs they're all so much worse than the originals
if you count duets/multi-girl songs then the one that's the least worse is probably Radiant Force Ignite
All the ingite versions are flat-out weaker
and then set those same lyrics to a different music as if that'd be fine
They wrote, directed, and recorded the lyrics for a certain music
because it's just not as good as the original
but I won't actively seek it out
I listen to it if I hear it
I'm the album version it's bad
In the show version sure
there are songs that I like less, or that I think are considerably weaker, but ignite x hedge is the only one that I think is genuinely a *bad* song
Ignite x edge is the only gear songs that I honestly consider bad music
But they didn't, they used the same recording of the singing and just redid the music
They would have been a lot better if they to re-record in the lyrics
Ginwan Ignite is the best ignite on the grounds that it was the best song originally
There are virgins that are less inferior, but every Ignite song is flat-out worse than the original
that's not a controversial opinion, the prevailing opinion is that the egnyte versions are flat-out inferior to the original versions in every case
The music and the lyrics are straight up at a different tempo, and it sounds fucking terrible
And the reason for that being, that it's the only song that I think is genuinely badly composed
And that's Just Loving X-Edge Ignite
tbh there's only one song in all of Gear that I actively *dis*like
and somehow this has endeared him to fans like cypher
Ver has just doubled-down on his shittiness every time he's showed up
but it wouldbe possible
it would be difficult to justify
it would be hard
Topdad could be redeemed
The thing is
"I like the rapist because he's funny!"
we've already established that you have the wrong opinion about ver cypher
Nah
"Oh yeah I added a thing to the Gears that makes them compatible with alchemy because I'm ver and I'm perfect amd I'm a meme"
Ver is probably the secre tto why Amalgam works
So I know we're getting more ver
Sadly, I know this show, and I know it's fans
I would genuinely rather have more topdad than more ver
I can't even quantify how much more I would have enjoyed GX if ver hadn't been in it
Ver made the shitshow that was GX so much worse
when you could have memes
why would you have a good, coherent plot
but big damn hero
which woulde be a shame so lose to the end
if we get *another* plot-relevant Ver I genuinely might drop the show
but I really like listening to Hikasa sing
Minami it's hard to deal with  beecause of emotional attachment to her voice
Hikasa especially
I definitely discovereda  lot of them because of Gear
but in reality I don't really know the VAs, I just like the show
Japanese Geah fans tend to assume I like Geah because I like the VAs
who the fuck is Yoko Hikasa
and it's like no, bitch, I just like the show
I've noticed that otaku tend to assume I'm a VA-friend because I like Gear
her voice was sexy
I wanted to see more of her
Leiur was cool
they *can* sing
not on the level of Nana/Yoko/Ayahi but like
decent singers
But yeah even the autoscorerers are like
and also the scene with DMJii
whether she was willing or not
No, it's from the scene where he literally said he was going to repopulate the earth with Maria
with the sole exception of that one girl who was in Nanoha
Literally any seiyuu with a decent singing voice is in Gear
Infinite, look at who they hired to sing
and people still like him and defend him
literally career goals: rapist
for all the things he did and believed
"for something he said" lmao
"I like the VA so the fact that he literally wanted to rape Maria and DMJii is okay!"
Who are nobodies until they're triply overworked
And the nobodies are doubly overworked because they have to work twice as many jobs to get noticed
you're overworked
Unless you're a nobody
they're seiyuu, of course they're overwoorked
I hopse she takes care of hersefl
especiallyh in the sieyuui indiustry
being healthy is important
that's true
se deserves more'
ahes so good
sad
her voice is so gfoiofd
I hopre she makesa it biug
I wasn't into jpop at all before geah
I def hadn't
Nana vbborders on housdehold name here
My fighting game logic is that if I'm only going to land one out of every four hits, I should make that one hit count for four
Him and ganondorf
I just play Ike cuz he's got the big whacking stick
I'm not good enough to maintain n air,
Id drop Ike in a heartbeat to main Kanade
DxM is Sept 13/14 IIRC
Astral Chain is Aug 30
Whoops
Oh
august 30
It releases in like 5 days
just let me fucking design mechs
I don't care about the game itself
I want AC:fA's ACSIS on PC
and I have no idea the fuck why
Yeah it's 8600 JPY plus tax
WHY THE FLYING FUCK DOES ASTRAL CHAIN COST 8600JPY PLUS TAX
ON A SOMEWHAT RLEATE DNOTE
I was looking at both of them recently and saw Satelight's name attached ot one of othme
I forget whihc
Satelight did the opening animation for either DxM or Astral Chain
They seem to be the most frivolous with udgets
Gear movie by Madhouse
You can probably get away with something like "dear friend" or "beloved friend"
Without using some really weird, awkward phrase like "bosom buddies"
Japanese has a few phrases that are something a little bit more than a friend that just don't translate properly into English
Some words just don't translate well
That's a nonsense phrase in English
They're the ones here, yeah
It's also heavier
I don't notice that at first
Oh yeah, the one with her kneeling must have something extra, it costs more
Any idea what the difference between these is?
What
... an exorcism?
We literally TTGL now
Fight the moon!
I do wonder why that never got released
Will we *ever* get Beef Stroganoff officially released
The biggest question though
So we might get the Elfnein karaoke song with the movie's soundtrack :P
Last time we got a karaoke scene though it took until the next season to get the song released
That would be fantastic
So we might get another Carol and/or Miku charasong CD before whatever's left on the actual soundtracks
The Tsubasa CD hasn't dropped but iirc there was another CD on the website but it has didn't say who it was for
And as anime has taught us, if you are cold in your sleep, you'll catch a cold, and the Japanese cold ain't nothing to fuck with
Miku just vibrating
That image always makes me chuckle
When one of them is not in the hospital, kidnapped, or dying, at least
I mean she and Bikki share a bed every night
Look, guys, I think we all know Miku isn't *pure*
That could be possible
And I sincerely doubt we're going to have a *five-episode* climax/finale
Gear isn't the kind of show to get the final boss on the combat field and then back off
Because honestly, as hype as Gear is, I could see Shem-Ha as the final boss... If she'd been introduced three episodes later
I think the biggest question though is how much they're going to commit to Kamiku/Shem-Ha
But yeah, them popping off Kamiku in episode *eight* really makes me wonder what the escalation is from here
So he'll be the last villain standing but he won't stand up until he's the *only* villain left
Fudou also very much seems the sort to only get his hands dirty when all other options have been exhausted
I think she's quite unlikely to die
Yeah killing Maria at this point would basically just retread Tsubasa's S1 arc
Fudou is gonna be the last villain standing imo
No way does Fudou go down before Shem-Ha
The question is just if he fights
Gen dies if he fights
Yeah I wouldn't be surprised if we end up with "And there were no more relics ever again" as an ending
Most likely to least likely imo
Hibiki > Shirabe > Maria > Chris > Tsubasa > Kirika > Miku
I'd say Hibiki is most likely
If someone *actually* dies
In fact it's rather the opposite
AKA not fucking happening without some utterly *asinine* corporate meddling
Miku actually being dead for good is about as likely as DMJii getting boyfriends
D

L O N D O N
>One Piece: 0 eps
We talked about it a bit after last week
I feel like Shem-Ha is more of a happy accident than an intended event
Just as long as it's not *only* Hibiki
I'd be content with a HibiMiku finale
Either there's a big fight vs. Tsubasa *or* she gets a bath in holy light
I feel like we'll get one or the other on that
or it's gonna be an *everybody* thing
like it's either gonna be *just* a Hibiki and Miku thing
If they do that though I think it'll basically confirm the finale of *all* the girls getting SSJd and the finale being a divine septet
Fits with the whole "Fudou doesn't do anything himself" thing too
and the last shot is Miku holding the 8 of Hearts
Apparently in a certain method of fortune telling, the 8 of hearts means "reunion"
https://twitter.com/8_kadu/status/1165960689506078720 well this is interesting
N
O
it uses SSJ's auchwafgen
Shem-Ha is in some form of SSJ
but I do not expect it
I pray for a BD bonus
but I would die a happy man
120 minutes of *movie budget Kanade* would kill me
I would see that so many fucking times
and we got *movie budget Kanade henshin*
If they did a prequel/summary movie
God
Some XDU OVAs might be fun
I see movies or OVAs, maybe XDU OVAs
But that's what killing Tsubasa would be saying
which would be a hell of a way to say "Symphogear is *over*"
Killing her would be killing any future for the franchise
She's the big cash cow for the show
I would be *shocked* if Basa died
if we're really unlucky it'll be just Hibiki
If we're a little unlucky it'll be just Tsubasa
if the final boss is Fudou, then it'll probably - hopefully - be an everybody thi8ng
Assuming the final boss is a giant monster, I could see involving Miku
and potentially even let Miku keep some/all of this new "Gear" power
Especially if they play up the Shem-Ha thing
involving her in the finale would feel relatively natural imo
She didn't fight much but she's been *important*
Miku has been like S1 Kanade
Glorious Break was just "Hey remember the whole 'work together' and 'you can't do everything alone' themes the show has run on for three seasons? Yeah fuck that, that's not important"
which Hibiki had been going for since episode 1
And got teamed up with the Alchemists
But *fuck* Glorious Break
Testament was okay
Or just to somehow be infused into Miku/the gauntlet
Was he expecting the power to actually create/summon a god like this
Or was Fudou even counting on Shem-Ha
What does Fudou have that he thinks Shem-Ha wants
And if Shem-Ha *doesn't* plan to work with anyone
Who, if anybody, does Shem-Ha want to work with
I think the biggest question is
the question is why/how
Noble Red is definitely gonna turn on Fudou at some point
They might have Fudou off her to prove he's a threat or something
She's the least "redeemable" and the most hot-headed
I don't see Millarc coming out of this alive
If he goes to combat he dies, but I still see it possible that he doesn't fight
but it'd be a big, steaming, stinky turd
They can easily bullshit it
No remotely *believable* way to do it
Like I said
there is no remotely believable way to prevent Hibiki from getting Gungnir wiped at point-blank like this
If it has it's G powers and it's controlled by a god, Gungnir is *gone*
Especially relic-deleting lasers
where it was just throwing giant lasers everywhere
I feel like they can't have it be as powerful as it was in G
I didn't notice that he was missing an arm, whoops
Didn't they just make a big deal out of the fact that nobody actually knows what Airgetlamh is
What if it was *Fine's* arm
She's going to be relevant again somehow
Fine was name-dropped in the opening scene and features prominently in the OP
Yeah
But she is Detective Conan, and that is continually receiving new projects
I don't know what, if anything else, she's done lately
Minami? She's Conan so
I know Serena got basically nothing, and Kanade had large portions of S1 to be relevant, but if they give an important speaking role to Serena and nothing but flashbacks to Kanade I'm gonna be upset
I just want Kanade to talk again
lmao
yeah
I mean
Watch the things on her head wrap down over her face into a mask
"And don't forget kids, always check your ancient relics for angry deities inhabiting them!"
and that's a hell of a fucking wrinkle in his plan
Summoning an ancient deity... probably not
Getting the energy into Miku certainly
was Shem-Ha the plan
Again though
Shem-Ha is not Miku though
Miku was definitely the plan
like that one meme from... uh... KonoSuba?
rainbow vomit
so we get more Shem-Ha, but Miku isn't the final boss
I think Shem-Ha somehow gets out of Miku
and hell, even *Carol* has made it more than one
This is a bit too big to be resolved in a single episode
but it won't make it to the end of 10
I suspect it'll last through episode 9
Airgetlamh hasn't really had a *theme* like the other relics
They didn't so much make an on-screen fuss of "NOBODY ACTUALLY KNOWS WHAT AIRGETLAMH IS" like in XV but it has kinda been a "This relic kinda just.. does things?"
Since when has there needed to be any logical connection for them to shoehorn him in again
Why not Gen
Why Fudou tho
LOL
She rides a flaming horse in XDU
They have another round in Ep 10 and Hibiki beats Shem-Ha out of Miku's body
They figure out how to beat her without killing Miku at the end of Ep 9
Shem-Ha in Miku is the primary threat for Episode 9
I figure the eyecatch at the halfway point of episode 10 is Miku coming back, her eyes returning to normal
Boom, Solid Snake
"Kept you waiting, huh?"
Spear comes flying out of nowhere and pins it to the wall
Noise pops out
Zwei Wing memorial tour with TsubaMari versions of the Zwei Wing songs
I'd like to see an epilogue
but yeah
prologue is a prequel/beginning scene
epilogue*
Why should Shem-Ha do anything to intentionally preserve Miku's consciousness when the one piece of personality we have for Shem-Ha is that Shem-Ha clearly thinks itself above humanity?
What does Shem-Ha gain from doing that?
Why?
So Elfnein's personality gets dissolved and suddenly it's Carol time
Carol doesn't
Elfnein gets Snapped
Also due to bullshit
~~double down on Tsubasa's dissolving crush trauma~~
Thus Hibiki gets Snapped and Chris has to pull Miku out of her funk
Like there would be zero recovery, she'd just be done
Hibiki would just shut down if Miku got snapped
Kirika, Maria, Genjuuro, Tomosato
And breathes his last
"You've become so strong"
Gently pats her head
Genjuuro takes the hit from Tsubasa
~~Gen dies to evil Tsubasa as both Bikki motivation and the snap back to reality (oh there goes gravity) that Tsubasa is going to need~~
Symphogear was actually a Metal Gear prequel the entire time
Episode 9: Gungnir gets destroyed by Shem-Ha, Shem-Ha proceeds to spend the whole episode kicking the shit out of the gears, when suddenly...
*Croitzal Ronzell Gungnir Zizzl...*
"GUNGUNIIRU DATTO?"
Episode cuts as a familiar voice starts to sing
Episode 10: Actual Literal Valkyrie Kanade with her God-Killing Spear wipes the floor with Shem-Ha and separates Miku from Shem-Ha, then gives her pendant to Hibiki and tells her "How many times are you going to break this thing?" and then returns to heaven after telling Tsubasa she's proud of her
A GYYYYYYAAAAAYYYYMMMMMM THREEEER- *gets shot*
Hibiki: "Was that St. Germain?"
Tsubasa: "Oh no, sweetheart, St. Germain is dead."
[later]
Hibiki: "... and St. Germain is inside me."
Tsubasa: "Oh Hibiki, she's inside all of us!"
I just hope for *anything* other than more reused footage flashbacks
That's about the most I expect, and even then I'm not really expecting that
Quite literal Deus Ex Machina
if Shem-Ha lasts at *least* through episode 10 he's probably the next/final step
If Shem-Ha is resolved before the end of episode 9 (which I think is *extremely* unlikely, and *really* hope doesn't happen) he's probably got one more hand to play
Depends on how long Shem-Ha lasts
I'm sure after Shem-Ha inevitably fails he'll either have one more plan or go "Alright if you want Japan defended, defend it yourself"
He's only gonna step up himself if everybody else he sent to do it fucked it up
as I've said a few times before, he seems like the sort to not get directly involved unless everything else has failed
I think there's going to *be* a fight
Yeah
depends on how you count it I sppose
well
I doubt Basa will be one of the final fights
It's definitely SSJ, it was SSJ's auchwafen
Then the rest of the show is Fudou/True Final Boss Custodian
We spend the rest of 10 and part/all of 11 dealing with Tsubasa
We spend Episode 9 and part of Episode 10 dealing with Shem-Ha/Miku
I figure
we still need to deal with the massive loaded chekov's gun that is Tsubasa
Oh speaking of
altering the OP to more heavily feature Fudou and/or Shem-Ha during the antagonist parts
But yeah, this time I'm wondering if the changes will be more significant
Though that was mostly just adding Chris to different scenes IIRC
I have three different S1 OP folders for Kanade images
also I just realized that's a lie
It's never changed in the past, but A) this is the final season and B) we've never had *this* big of a switch in primary antag role
is the OP gonna change?
Now that it's been pretty well confirmed in the show that Noble Red aren't the primary antagonists
Oh here's a question
without divine intervention
The Gears are - or should be - boned
Shem-Ha is a literal deity with a complete relic
that's the only time I think he's ever been shown
before the concert
when Hibiki is on the phone with Miku
He shows up at the *very* beginning
The exception being Miku's dad, who is literally just a non-character
Bikki's dad is trash
Basa's biological father is trash
Everybody else's dad is dead
Dads are trash or dead
Both of which are gone
And in GX it was because of ignite
In season 1 it was a side effect of being a relic hybrid
Fairly unlikely I'd say
Wait did XDU give them names
Aww, that's sweet
They just appear in the art
idk if it even has a story
I think that's the most they've been mentioned since G
They got a Memoria in XDU
Because that's how pretty much everybody universally refers to them as a pair, when they're not referring to them individually
Then you clearly haven't been paying very much attention in this server
Or we could just use the phrase that everyone has used for the last five years
DMJii
G = Jii
Jii = Shirabe's staring onomatopoeia
DMG = Dark Magician Girl, who Kirika's transformed state bears a strong resemblance to
since G basically
Kirika and Shirabe
Odd
Oh yeah, they haven't had a duet yet
Vanessa and Elsa 50/50
Millarc almost guaranteed death
And the trio of "normal" friends Hibiki and Miku have had since S1
Chris' friends, above
There are two sets of friends
Which one is which
For the million dollar question
It's both stated and shown in the anime
That's been since G
so when they work together it's something something Zababa
Zababa is the god(dess?) their relics come from
The manga is more "She was already dying even before the concert and had a single-digit number of years left of her life even before the zesshou"
Like the anime is like "This is unhealthy"
It's shown in the anime but in less explicit terms
in the manga I'm pretty sure Kanade was officially on the clock regardless because of how badly the LiNKER was damaging her body
In the anime it was messing up her systems and occasionally causing her to spit up blood
and regardless of being on LiNKER, the LiNKER was killing Kanade either way
She still intentionally orchestrated the circumstances that lead to Kanade's death, and intentionally did not adequately prepare Kanade for the circumstances she was fighting in
but Fine murdered Kanade
She might not have personally killed her
In short
*intentionally gave Kanade shitty LiNKER*
*because we know she worked with Ver prior to the events of the concert*
*and*
and *intentionally* did not tell either of them how to zesshou properly
She set up the conditions and intended to make one or both of Zwei Wing zesshou to get the phonic gain necessary to activate Nehushtan
Fine is arguably the one directly responsible for Kanade's death
But yeah
actually majorly plot relevant
and he's like
Though tbf it does put Fudou behind Basa
*exceptionally* weird that Kanade isn't present
Which is like
It's clearly harkening back to the dead and/or those who hold a significant emotional weight in the foreground girls
Wakanda bullshit is that?
And Kanade fucking isn't?
Multiple times
Serena's in the OP
but yeah
I didn't want to be "That Annoying Kanade Guy"
Okay
Like "Oh she was an agent of Fudou the entire time and her death was orchestrated specifically to try to mindbreak Tsubasa"
okay but for real though my genuine greatest fear is XV does some horseshit character assassination to Kanade
Yeah, I'm thinking it'll last through episode 9 and roughly half of episode 10
I thought you meant halfway through episode 9
Oh, that's what you meant by 9.5
I'll be surprised and honestly a bit disappointed if it's resolved by the end of the next episode
I really really like TsubaMari so I want Tsubasa to live
Reused footage: >90%
New footage, no dialogue: 60%
New footage with new voicework: 30%
Actually *coming back*: <5%
So presumably we need a couple more and then we'll get Album 2
There have been 8 new XDU-original songs released since then
First one has 10 songs
Presumably
~~I don't want to be ruined with an inferior version~~
~~I'm refusing to listen to the new duets until the full album versions are out~~
Gyakkou no Resolve is so good
Yeah!
Maybe just a little
but maybe as a BD extra
I don't
an XV-style Kanade henshin
I will ask for one thing and one thing only
also god, if you're real
XV has 7 so far
AXZ has 6
G and GX have 8
S1 has 6
AXZ has 6
Oh
AXZ might have only had seven
At least G and GX did
G onward has had eight
They've had *eight* charasongs for most seasons
*but*
There *is* a 7th character song
Also
If Kanade comes back and I get that spoiled for me I'll fucking kill the person who spoils it
It's almost certainly Carol
Which was kinda nice I guess
it also turned into evil Maria and she fought herself?
Because that had emotional weight to it
It turned into Mammu and fought FIS
Just something more than reusing the shot of her turning to dust again
with new footage
Honestly even just a *voiced* cameo
but I would lose my fucking mind if Kanade genuinely came back
I know it would be narratively bad
so
Last I heard Ver only got forced back into GX and AXZ because Sugita asked for it
"Go fuck yourself, you and I both know this is not the same love you meant."
"Fair enough."
[fades out of existence, never to be mentioned again]
I would pay for him not to
You bet your ass they're gonna force-feed us some shitty Ver cameo
Get ready to be annoyed
and he disappears like a bad taco bell shit when you flush the toilet
Maria instantly tells him to fuck off
Ver shows up
Late 12 probably
"Don't give up on living."
"Remember what I told you all that time ago?"
I'd be more than content with something like that happening
I forgot that was Yoko and Kamina
It's been several years since I've watched TTGL
Oh, shit, that is Yoko's outfit
~~kanade with chestwraps thoooooooooooooooo~~
something like this, you mean?
Just some actually *new* animation of her
Even if there's no actual dialogue
Please give us something other than reused footage
But honestly, for real
How does that affect future romantic prospects
You are now legally siblings
Your parents don't know you're dating, and decide to adopt them
Let's say you're dating someone who has no parents
Actually I've always kinda wondered how that would work
and that makes things... weird
Yeah but then they're sisters
Dr. Ver for some godforsaken reason, because he needs another cameo?
Each other?
Mammu and the old guy from the shrine?
*who do DMJii get*
the biggest problem with "Every girl gets a message from their deceased family"
I think
don't get my hopes up too much
I'm trying to hedge my bets essentially
Yeah but let's be honest the way this show has been going has been "Give Hibiki all the attention"
Kanade: "Tell Tsubasa she's become so strong and I couldn't be more proud of her"
Serena: "Tell Maria I love her and she's the best big sister I could have asked for"
Gets a moment to talk with the deceased
Goes to the afterlife for a minute
Hibiki gets fucked up
That's what I see most realistically happening
You are missing the point
like Carol's return, I was kinda 50/50 on it until ~~it was blatantly spoiled for me~~ I saw it happen in the episode
You can foreshadow something and not have it happen
Again though, foreshadowing isn't spoiling
That's what I'm *hoping* for, but *really* isn't what I'm expecting
Unless they got a sound-alike, which is exceedingly unlikely for a litany of reasons
so she was willing, from the get-go, to record most of her dialogue and at least one new song
which I sincerely doubt would have been classed under "continuing needs"
Though the *first* XDU song was her new solo
Yeah
which pretty much rules out the "unwilling to return" aspect and leaves the only out as "unable to return" for whatever reason
which is a lot more work than just doing a few lines of dialogue
Minami reprised her role for XDU, and even recorded multiple new songs for it
I just had a shower thought regarding yesterday's discussion about Kanade and VAs
I'm glad Saki
"If I had a million dollars, I'd buy you a green dess."
"But not a real green dess."
"That's cruel!"
"If I had a million dollars...!"
"We wouldn't have to eat Conbini dinner!"
"But we *would* eat conbini dinner."
"Of course we would, we'd just eat more."
They can afford *two entire* instant ramens from 7-Eleven!
If they saved up a whole ¥596 in their piggy bank last month!
DMJii have their shit together
I'm really hoping that they don't just reuse the concert death again
The whole conversation this entire time has been that it should be new footage, not additional flashbacks
Or like there was a weird gap in the release schedule that made it look like a 7th CD was going to be released
When the charasomgs were announced people were buzzing about there being seven CDs listed
If we're lucky, we could get it as early as late September
There was an unmarked CD 7 iirc
I never liked Crunchy to begin with but this is really not helping my opinion on them
I didn't realize they were posting multiple spoilers per episode
Oh, when you said Carol Returns earlier I figured it was the transformation
We already knew Carol was back and we know Noble Red are meant to be weak
Carol's fight vs. Noble Red would have been a good example
Or again, clip something *less spoilery*
You kinda were
Yet you're defending it and saying it's the *viewer's fault* for being bothered by it?
"You're wrong because I don't care"
Okay, so you're just going "nuh uh" and don't actually have an argument, got it
Are two entirely different things
And being spoiled
Being foreshadowed
And *again*
I'm trying to find a more polite word than "moronic"
That's
And they could have just as easily clipped a *much less spoilery* moment from the episode
"It was gonna happen regardless" is a bad argument
by definition
is a spoiler
and revealing a major plot point
The point is it's a major plot point, regardless of how heavily foreshadowed it was
And it was stated that most were due to being trampled
The concert in S1 had ~13k casualties
By which I mean she's the only one who showed literally any interest in the concept
Vanessa also seems the most interested in working with Hibiki
70000 is a statistic
One death is a tragedy
Told them to, but still, if Elsa is the strategist, and designed the actual plan to do so
She occasionally calls things out in battle and it was stated in the keywords
Unless it was Fudou because he just hates his daughter's career choice *that* much
She's most likely the one who came up with the idea for the concert massacre
Melua brought up a good point though, Elsa is the tactician/strategist of the group
Millarc is just "Oh boy here I go killing again"
Like, yeah, she's smug about it, but she's also trying to get the gears off her back and do what's best for her family
Millarc openly enjoys killing
Vanessa at least feels like she thinks these aren't the best methods
Millarc is too unrepentantly evil and Elsa is largely "I'm also here"
Vanessa is the only one I have any real sympathy for tbh
I just thought it was one show called "Symphogear G" and someone had shortened the title
In my defense, I didn't know there were two
And there were only two
Not going to lie, when I started watching, I jumped in the wrong season
Literal combat firebird with wings
Kanade is Blaziken guys come on
that's why they were talking about him
Oh, TopDad was in the preview images
https://twitter.com/golden_nabe/status/1167362513370894336
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
"One more person still to appear"
>Kanade hasn't showed up at all but they're clearly hinting at topdad
I'll take TopDad over Ver any day
Chris has bigger boobs, Maria has a larger Bust measurement
I thought the phone call was basically meant to be "We acknowledge this character still exists but he's not going to be relevant"
Leiur's Big Sister is the secret final boss
literally, since she was a giant
That would be the biggest twist
If this season brings Ver back again I will genuinely consider dropping the show
Having Topdad would be disappointing *and* surprising
Having Ver would be disappointing but not surprising
Having no Kanade would be disappointing but not surprising
Having no Fine would be baffling
as in "Only one important *GX* character has yet to return"?
Apparently it was specifically in relation to GX?
which was great in a campy 1960s sci-fi show
The gold trim looks nice but they look like Star Trek TOS dresses
please fucking no
give us G Shirabe's Giant Robot zesshou
please
At the very least
I'd love to see Giant Robot Shirabe
Are you even watching the series
Best part by far was her shielding Elsa from behind and literally not even looking
the big swaths of bold colors are great
I like the XV designs a lot too
color-on-black > color-on-white imo
I liked Ignite's look but tbh more for the color scheme than the actual design
but not so good in Symphogear
when she had the chance
Imagine how tonally inconsistent it would have been if Tsubasa had just flat-out *killed* Shirabe in G
Like
They hadn't had human opponents they tried to kill before
Either Melua or Saki mentioned it, it was basically S.O.N.G. dropping a kill squad on Prelati
On top of the whole "Tsubasa and Shirabe just went HAM trying to kill her despite the fact that Prelati wasn't really actively trying to hurt them until they started the fight"
which made it really weird
but in-universe it didn't
It was meant to play to the *viewer* as them killing the monster of the week
They were definitely viewed as humans, just bad humans
and celebrated it
But they *thought* they killed her
That's logically consistent character development after AXZ
Ah yes, let Tsubasa go kill someone again with no remorse
Carol just didn't give a fuck
so while Noble Red were pulling crazy shit and trying to choreograph *their* fighting
The entire point of the fight was that Carol completely outclassed them
what
That is all I've wanted out of those two since they showed those off
wielding G Kirika's Giant Scythe zesshou
I'm literally telling him to stop or the staff is going to ban him because of what he's saying
I'm not using that as an argument
"Person A shouldn't have emotions about killing Person B" is a functionally flawed statement
Shut the fuck up or you're gonna get banned
Armados seriously dude
Stop
Armados
Holy shit
literal children
When I say "young people" I mean like
The only people who think young people aren't stupid are young themselves
Young people *are* stupid man
Exactly
Young people have an excuse to be stupid
and how war and killing effect people
for your complete lack of understanding of how the world works
make that like 11
hell
Boy you better be like 14
lmao
I would offer you a shovel but you seem to be digging this hole just fine by yourself
The girls are *not* trained soldiers
Even not considering the ridiculousness of that standpoint
and Alcanoise for that matter
We know *exactly* what Noise are
Because we literally know where Noise come from, what they are, and how they work?
Obviously not
Killing a person is *always* emotionally damaging wtf
People like him because he's """"""""""""""funny""""""""""""""""""
Ver shows up and everyone celebrates
I'd rather see Akira because at least fans react to him like they should
Ver had nothing left to contribute after G - okay, *maybe* GX - but look where the fuck we are
TopDad by a country fucking mile
I have more faith in TopDad actually having additive value than Ver
I'll put it in SFW
I've got at least one
but it's not canon
There's a few images of it
Elsa - and Shirabe, for that matter - have something vaguely resembling hips and breasts and have more teen-like faces
She's small, has a childlike face, and no "developed" body parts
She plays to the evil loli demographic Gear attracted after GX
Clearly this should turn her into a sociopathic killing machine with no emotional investment in anything
I'm really not
tl;dr Armados thinks Tsubasa should just kill Millarc because PTSD is fake
I didn't mean to start a debate as to the nature of a hero
I was just quoting Serenity
The definition of a hero is somebody who gets other people killed
I thought it was a general insult
Is that considered bad?
Maybe if you're a Ver-liking mouthbreather
Can you literally not
IIRC that was technically how Kanade got it to work the first time
in theory enough of it could increase someone who has 0 sync rate could activate a gear
It increases Sync Rate but we don't know how
St. Germain
bruh
The concert and most modern Noise incidents
She still has a reasonably bodycount
Genghis Khan or some shit
but wasn't Fine implied to be like
I forget if it was fanon or canon
SG or Fine
Maria wasn't in danger herself but Mammu is very much not bulletproof
Cape blocks bullets IIRC
in a situation where she was kinda putting herself in a position where that could be a possibility
but like
The guys in the building were definitely self defense
Either she killed them or was partially responsible for the events that lead to their deaths
So
With Maria it's more a case of "Either she killed them, or she knocked them out and then left them in an exploding building"
and I don't think DMJii are directly shown killing anyone
Maria *plausibly* killed some soldiers in the office building
At the time she was hurting people due to circumstance, which, while bad, is a far cry from intentionally involving civilians in superhero-level combat
She also wasn't actively *trying* to kill people
I knew the guy at the time he killed someone
Should I be punished for that?
I used to know someone who ended up killing a person
Uh, yes, if they didn't actively do anything wrong
"At least I can learn the secret identity of The Flash!"
"I have no idea who this is."
Like that one Justice League thing
In regards to anything related to heretical tech or shit like that
Div 2/SONG seems to operate with nearly unlimited authority
"Break the NDA you just signed and go to jail"
it was probably "Sign the NDA or go to jail"
I mean
actual line was that they were dead
XV concernt was 70k, Crunchy subbed it as MIA or some shit
ish
10k was S1 concert
I feel like a lot more happened in 9 than in 10
I'm a little disappointed which episodes got delayed though
which has a tendency to fix things too quickly
It did, but this is also Gear
But still somewhat spoiled
and thankfully these episodes were spoiled significantly less than the previous
That Shem-Ha would be resolved and Fudou would be endgame
I guess my prediction was wrong though
also the sailors weren't people, they were American
Literally exactly what I just said
It was nice to see a return to G form in having DMJii's duet be their A-sides mashed together
even if by literally any count it's not actually her fault
but can't have any blood on Miku's hands now can we
That would have been an amusing and abrupt end to their character arcs and really driven home how much of a monster/threat Shem-Ha is
I was honestly hoping they were just dead
Even if they did get fixed afterwards
Also Noble Red getting just *mulched* caught me by surprise
also YameteTomete picked a fine fucking episode to be a week late on
Tsubasa had her big emotional Amaglam moment and didn't even *mention* Kanade
The Kanadream is Kanadead
Do you think G+ Kanade would still have "NO! THE HAIR IS *R O U N D*" design docs
don't blame me for this
also Melua said it first not me
It almost looks like a western studio drew it
I only wish Kanade had lived to see this budget
it feels weird and out of place when it very suddenly shifts to it
but
I kinda like it
I caught up, 'swhy I'm here
Yeah
not-Satelight
looks really
also that Chris one in particular
also now finally I can rip all my XV albums
Those shots that are now emotes hardly look like the same studio
10 felt weird
Yeah
out*
they didn't have enough to justify 2 cours but had too much for just one and didn't cut enough our
with how much shit they have going on
a cour and a half for XV
I feel like they needed like
A bit of cooldown from 9 and setup for the finale
and bizarre as it sounds 10 felt like a breather episode
shots which lacked animation
conspicuous
There were some
Yeah
which might be why 10 felt somewhat empty by comparison
9 did feel like it had a *lot* going on
Not by name but I've definitely seen it
isn't there an interview floating around that basically everything since S1 has been Kaneko pulling ideas out of essentially a metaphorical glass box of "Break if Gear gets more seasons"?
This shit might not have been *planned* but it was probably at minimum conceptualized
but they've been leaving doors on purpose since G
Yeah, by GX they probably had the idea before they finished up that "Yeah we're *probably* getting more unless we seriously screw the pooch" and I agree that GX had a bigger door than G
just wanted the door to be there
They had no plans to actually *open* the door until the new seasons were greenlit
They just wanted to leave the door open for additional plot threads if they got another renewal
Just because they didn't wrap everything up at the end of the season doesn't mean they were already anticipating a continuation
Every season except AXZ has been planned to be the final season
"Also except GX onward cause planned to end it then but changed their mind so it tells you it has a bunch of loose threads and already planned to continue."
I'm having trouble parsing the last sentence of that first message
Just that it was designed to tell a story without needing to use all of it's tools
I wouldn't necessarily say G was written without it in mind
I forgot if we saw her go away at the end of 8
did she just kinda disappear off-screen
where'd she go
wtf happened to Carol
also wait
how much stretching do you think she had to do
suddently getting three extra tail plugs rammed in
just like
also jeez poor elsa
~~ngl Vanessa was looking hot as hell in her new battle outfit~~
I haven't seen a finale episode be longer than average in decades
You now know how I've felt for five years
I'd be really surprised if they bring back the autoscorers again
Last time I had a hangover was after literally eight hours of drinking
I don't get hangovers unless I go way way overboard
I'm lucky
Do you think Tsubasa ever goes to Karaoke and sings old Zwei Wing songs, but only her parts
You also ruined it
As a fan of Jojo and not a rabid hater
Fine becomes her own little sister
just the girls in Lydian
Everyone's alive and nobody died and the Gears don't exist
Everyone's in high school
Just do it TTGL style
I'd like OVA SoL spinoffs
which means you've probably used it at least half a dozen times in the last three days
That's literally the third time today I've seen you post the same fucking image
The memories of rainbows and flowers are gone
Uh
Itsuka no Niji, Hana no Omoide is the name of a song
Which I think was Miku's G B-side?
I'm talking to myself tbh
Oh my god dude fuck off already
The show will end on Kimi to Iu because Kanade will show up and wipe the floor with Shem-Ha's face
pleeeeeeeeeeeeease
Unless Hibiki explained it off-screen - *and* everyone believed her - she's the only one that knows they didn't kill the other AXZ alchemists
The activation sequence is being emotionally fine with being a murderer
You'll freeze to death first
Don't worry, you won't suffocate
the one in the OP maybe?
yes
is the joke
that
"What do you want for your birthday, Hibiki?"
"I want Miku back."
"... I have like 12 dollars."
(and then a byproduct of Ignite)
I thought it was a byproduct of Bikki's relic cancer?
They are evidently merely soft covers over the missiles
Careful, Elsa, those'll take your face off
Neat
Somebody got the preview images?
but that doesn't somehow make the scene retroactively less intense
It *should* have had lasting effects
pretty sure it was the cliffhanger
Yeah I was gonna say
in XV the moment was just like "lol let's zesshou to kick-start X-Drive" like it was something they could just casually do with little threat
but *in the moment* it had weight
It was cleaned up too fast
Right
If it's some sort of faust-robe hybrid... I hope so
in XV it was literally a nothing moment
there was impact there, for a short while
Like, at least with Kirika's in AXZ, yeah the cleanup was overly quick, but the actual scene had weight to it
The Zesshou scene was *so* underplayed
That was the one thing I really haven't enjoyed so far in XV
scrubbing toilets with a regular-ass toilet brush
Shem-Ha done up in full battle regalia
That's a funny mental image
Actually
Her hair's already black, we won't notice <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
If that tiny little laser she used to kill Noble Red is "everything she has" then the gears should be cleaning S.O.N.G.'s toilets with her face right about now
Fair enough
poof
DMJii are visible in the background
Yeah I was pretty sure they dove into the teleporter as well
~~which is why it *should* have disappeared when she got SSJ'd~~
the arm regen, that is
I'm about 90% sure *that* was specifically the relic cancer
"I literally shot my tits off for this"
>Tsubasa jams again
>ends up Shirabe-flat afterwards
>Chris uses boob missiles
<@486087033652248576> that's exactly what I mean
Exactly
I don't really like any of them
Not when they look like dollar store halloween costumes
more mecha-ish
I like the gears when they look more mechanical
Well then Power Rangers are dumb
Too shiny, too smooth
They look plastic
Dainsleif is gone as far as we know isn't it
but Amalgam on it's own is super bland
Amalgam XD would be cool
I really don't like Amalgam's look
Just whatever it is please don't fucking use Amalgam as the final form
It's clearly because we're getting something "more" for the finale
~~inb4 some 'Hibiki killed her throughout all of time forever' shit~~
which does beg the question, what killed her?
Not with Hibiki around lol
And neither of them *would* have died if not for the show getting extensions greenlit after the fact
and Fine made it most of the way through G
Yeah like three seasons later
but the final boss and the main villain haven't always been the same thing
The final boss always dies
FIS and Ver didn't die in G
His existence doesn't expand the world, and his actions could have easily been done by somebody else
There's nothing that he, specifically, as a character, adds to the show, that another character could not have also done, perhaps more logically
Which is exactly what I mean whenever I voice that opinion
I'm muting the channel and then waiting for YameteTomete's subs
That's what I mean
Hopefully I'll see you guys tomorrow night/Monday night if I'm lucky
Anyways, it's Saturday and I have plans tonight so I'm gonna dip out of this channel now
And then we got Carol, who so wholly outclassed everyone else that only an *actual literal miracle* saved them
Which is what happened
It felt like the villains gave up
It never felt like the gears *won*
But the fights had no stakes because we knew they were holding back the whole time
The dolls and Carol were consistently vastly more powerful than the Gears *and* the Gears walked right into everything Carol planned and only won because Hibiki shit out a literal miracle
GX was *awful* in that regard, by far the most egregious imo
Yeah, the power gap is gigantic, but it's not compensated for with bad writing or by making the fights pointless - Noble Red's victory conditions haven't once been "defeat the Gear users"
What <@185949743321579520> said
That's the big difference
Especially post-reconstitution
Yeah, I think XV is the best it's done since S1
With the exception of S1 the Gears have been consistently either much more or much less powerful than the antagonist(s), which makes for fights with no real stakes and/or awkward writing to cover the power gap
Also tbh Gear doesn't do threat levels very well
I probably won't be back on Discord until after it airs
I'm going to be busy until it airs is my point
they'll do it again here
They did it the last two seasons
Shoehorned redemption as Hibiki solos final boss
"alive" is enough to be a wrench in the plot's plans
and knowing Gear
Depowered but not dead
So not like they aren't setting themselves up for an AXZ-like fuckup
Yet Maria and Tsubasa seem to think they did
Not like they killed Millarc anyways
I mean
Kanadream still Kanadead
also ancient Shem-Ha was Shem-Hawt
The resurrection of Fushichou was pretty great though
it felt like not a lot actually *happened*
but like last episode
That was pretty hype
***IGNITION***
Striking the final blow with her

They're there
and an anime about *how friendship is super fucking strong* of all things
This is anime
While that's true in reality
Shounen Cheerleading was Miku and the Stroganettes
and swinging the sword with her
Literally Tsubasa and Chris were there *helping bring her back from berserk*
also what do you mean shounen cheerleading
AXZ is only better than GX because that horseshit doesn't work
Not just raise their hands to the sky and shout "I'M HELPING"
I want them to *actually do something*
Same in AXZ
"Alright Bikki's got this go home everyone"
GX they could have just fucked off
I want them in the frame because in the frame means *actively helping*
and betrays the entire point of the show
Which was fucking stupid
Exactly
In S1 and G they were *doing something* when Hibiki got the last hit in, at least for the big OP attack
When Hibiki landed the finishing blow, the other gears were actively doing *nothing*
They didn't need to be there
just "Hey here's my energy go spirit bomb the bitch"
No support
There was no interaction
And then they proceeded to do absolutely nothing
same with AXZ
GX didn't even need anybody but Hibiki even present
G still needed all six of them *there* even if Hibiki and Maria were doing the most work
in GX by the time the final blow was being delivered literally no one but Hibiki actually had to be present
in G they gave their power to Hibiki but were still there helping the final blow
They just sat back and aped the first Broly movie
They didn't do any fighting
also you know what I mean Millhi, shut the fuck up
They could have literally not done shit and Bikki would still have solo'd
S1 had Chris and Basa help her by bringing back the power of Durandal
The other gears threw their power at her and fucked off
It was 100% alone in GX
Gear only knows how to let Hibiki Do Things now
Bikki will solo Shem-Ha
It is because Gear forgot how to do collab finishes
That seems like something that would be pretty hard to miss
Like
Yeah
I was about to say, I know I can be unobservant and forgetful, but I'd be pretty surprised if I'd managed to miss them transferring to a different School
I *completely* missed that if that's the case
Are they not at Lydian anymore?
Wait, did they really change the school?
I imagine considerable numbers of NDAs with threats of being disappeared had something to do with that
which would at least be them *working together*
You could just as easily have had the main six girls all get one strike in with the big fist as the finishing blow
as well as Shem-Ha and Noble Red
Ogawa, Genjuuro, and Fudou are all equally as big of roles as the Stroganettes ever were
But they also made other characters much more important
Yeah, the complete disappearance of the Stroganettes is sad
it's "Well Hibiki is the MC thus only she should do things"
It is 5 sub protags but it's not "Oh we have too many characters to let everyone contribute"
It's not 5 sub protags, it's the show shitting itself as it forces only Hibiki to do anything
They're literally just shouting their gear names
Meanwhile, S1 and G had all the other gears *actively aiding in the final attack*
[Glorious Break]
Hibiki does all the work for a few more seconds
They throw more power at Hibiki
Hibiki does all the work
They throw their power at Hibiki
Not to mention the last appearance of a character other than Hibiki or carol besides *one line each* is almost two minutes prior to the attack card
S1: actively helping Hibiki strike the final blow
GX: almost 30 seconds pass between anyone other than Hibiki or Carol being shown before the attack card
But okay
Literally not
That's sad and dumb tbh
Chris: "Where do you think you're touching?"
Hibiki: "I'm saving your life, if I accidentally groped you we can talk about it later, now is *really* not the time."
I remember that episode *vaguely*
Yeah
I really liked all the group songs
The songs were really good too
~~it'd be like SSJ3 Raditz, hair for days~~
~~I super need fanart of Kanade in that form~~
That said, I *really* liked the new XD forms
is *infuriating* though
They didn't actually give us an on-screen kiss or even confession for hibiMiku
The fact that, even up until the very end, with how much they were talking about it
Shem-Ha fighting again and Metanoia being the finale were also both directly spoiled (the former by screenshots and the latter by speculation in the XDU channel)
Hero forms was the new XD
HibiMiku getting separated from the main group was wrong
Metanoia being a solo attack was far less disappointing than I expected it to be given the specific details
No Kanade appearance was beautifully, wonderfully wrong
Hibiki actually straight up killing Shem-Ha was... sorta right?
Shipping was right
Millarc died but not even remotely close to what was implied
Tsubasa getting hurt was completely wrong
Long haired forms I directly saw screenshots for
Officially Spoiled:
Long-haired special XD forms

Heavily implied:
Tsubasa is seriously injured or even killed
Millarc dies (possibly killed/consumed by Shem-Ha or another Noble Red?)
The series doesn't have the balls to actually make HibiMiku or DMJii official 100% canon
Hibiki actually KILLS Shem-Ha
No Kanade appearance

Lightly implied:
Metanoia is another solo attack
Hibiki and/or Miku are somehow not together with the rest of the group after the finale
"Hero Forms"?? (possibly new XDs)

Obvious, but still spoilers:
Shem-Ha fights again
Metanoia is the finale attack
The other half were right
About half of them were completely wrong
So of the spoilers I had
THOSE FUCKING COWARDS
I had completely given up
I'm actually sobbing tbh
brief as it was
For not spoiling the Kanade cameo
from the bottom of my heart
deeply
to thank you all
I want
well
but it would have been weird to have a focus emotional moment for them given
I wanted a DMJii kiss
more than HibiMiku
Though tbh
also that
But a giant neon "WE'RE GAY, DUMBASSES" sign would have been nice
it's *all there*
Like
Yeah
It was so good
And then when Gyakkou started playing as the finale music to bookend the series musically
but yeah
I was a little sad not to see bullshit regen for the gears
that was awesome
Tsubasa using her fucking *hair* as a sword got me though
adding fluff and volume to her hair did wonders for her character design
Shirabe gets a star for "Most Improved" over her base look though
Is a hard choice between Hibiki, Tsubasa, and Maria
The one I think was flat-out *best*?
Hmm
Which was why I was hella confused
Yeah
so for like three weeks I thought it was some weird super form that *only* Kirika got
I was only spoiled on Kirika's XD form for a while
funnily enough
also
also Hibiki *definitely* got a handful of Zenbus when she carried Chris out of the way
That did look vaguely familiar
and the baby turned into a Kamen rider
It looks like Tron fucked LoGH
That's stupid and I love it
was simultaneously stupid and amazing
with giant naked Chris
Chris' giant gun
also
I have to wonder if there was some design-sharing going on behind the scenes
Miku's helmet in Aigis form from XDU bears a striking resemblance to Shem-Ha's bananas
also something I've been wondering recently
hopefully we'll get a lot of 'Shinai fun
but
It could have used a little more cooldown
It was good
Yeah
I'm a goddamn mess right now hahaha
tbh I think Mel probably would have shown the offender the door
It wouldn't even have been by me
Also this one of Offense Forme with Tsubasa

I have it
I saw the Amalgam art
they didn't meme him
yeah
It was almost... tasteful? As much as an appearance by him can be, at least
Yeah
Because Elfnein forgot
~~also my brain shut down like two seconds later~~
and none of them said anything
The Ver cameo I could kinda stomach because it was a "Here's all the dead characters" moment
knowing she's okay
and a wave
but a smile
Just for a moment
<:KanadeSinging:421432676789256202>
She came back
yeah
Giving Miku more songs is always good
Yeah
So I guess they just didn't want to do that again
it didn't stop them from reusing her recorded voice in the DMJii version
Though
but I understand why it wasn't
It should have been
I was kinda happy that Bikki didn't actually save any of them
My music player just shuffled all four Kanade songs in a row
>Orbital Beat finishes
>Gyakkou no Resolve
but ending their plot line with a bit of a whimper as opposed to a trainwreck was still not bad
The Noble Red plot kinda fizzled
Yeah
>Gyakkou finishes, it plays the Zwei Wing Orbital Beat
>Kimi to Iu finishes, it plays the Zwei Wing Gyakkou no Flugel
>queue up Kimi to Iu, put it on shuffle
>open music player
Or one of the cards in XDU or something
did they do something similar in AXZ?
It looked vaguely familiar
WAS AWESOME
GIANT ALLY FISBOT
OH SHIT SPEAKING OF ADDING MARIA
the fact that it was pretty much the HibiMiku show since midway through episode 12
Oh yeah
but I can't remember Maria's off the top of my head
I remember the other five
Wait, did Maria even get a big moment for the offensive form
I liked the whole "Absolute Offense ***or*** Absolute Defense" thing
Power set/ideas were cool
lol
as was mentioned last time I ended up talking about that
Rider > Sentai
I just thought they were ugly
I liked them and their role in the show
I just didn't like the visual design
but I'm happy with where it ended
I'm sad it's over
Well, I got some great music, a really cool fight, some kickass new XD forms ~~thank you god for not using the Amalgam forms as the final forms~~, a Kanade cameo that I had completely written off, and HibiMiku is as canon as it was honestly ever realistically gonna get
Yeah
scene*
That would have really ruined the tone of the svcene
as much as I would have liked it
Which implies LiNKER, or at leas the S1 LiNKER, had to be tuned per-person
implies it was designed *specifically for* Kanade
Which, given the name
they only had the Model-K
At the time
Well
less "No more Gears" and more "No more Adaptors"
That could have been what they meant
Yeah
so I may be remembering inaccurately
But again, very long time since S1
Fragments of an incomplete relic, yeah, but I always felt it was at least implied that it wasn't possible to manufacture additional Gear pendants, at least in S1
It's been a long time since S1 though
in fact I think that was a plot point in S1, that there were no other relics to make more Gears from?
and we have no evidence that there are additional fragments of AnH around to recreate a new Gear from
But that's my point though, assuming Basa went down the same way Kanade did at the concert, AnH would have been destroyed
Tsubasa starts to zesshou at the concert and Fine has to step in/reveal herself early because "Gungnir is expendable but Ame no Habakiri isn't"
Actually, that might make an interesting premise for an AU fanfic
~~but what would have happened to her plan if Basa had Zesshou'd and died instead?~~
~~then again she already knew FIS had the other fragment so I guess not~~
~~also the whole "Ryoko created seven Gears to deal with all this shit" thing really calls into question how callously she let Kanade die/Gungnir be destroyed~~
on the other *other* hand, Episode 13 was already extremely pressed for time
On the other, I feel like that would have been a big enough plot development that they would have called it out in the finale
an Adaptor can be replaced, a Symphogear is harder to fix
Like on the one hand, it seems somewhat logical that to Fine the Symphogears were more valuable than the wearers
From external sources, at least
since IIRC every other instance of the Gear being overwhelmed (save GX, where the pendant itself was attacked/damaged, rather than the actual Gear) the Symphogear unit seems to shut down/deactivate before taking irreparable damage
Do y'all think the Gears were *actually destroyed*, or just force-deactivated during the escape from Yggdrasil?
Okay, question
"Enjoyed" would be one word for it, yes
I did, last night, ye
also go back and see if there's any evidence that the girls are still wearing their pendant necklaces after the end
I'd want to go back and compare it to other scenes where Gears were forcibly deactivated
also stepping back it does look like the pendants exploded in that screenshot Melua posted
"I'm beginning to think you and I have a very different take on the word 'fuck'!"
I mean, the manga just flat out states "She's the strongest Symphogear user, but she's time-limited"
~~also it's canon that Kanade was stronger than Tsubasa at the time of the concert~~
even when it shouldn't have
to force it to work
She had the drive, the willpower
That *is* what made her special
Exactly though
they collect FIS
has to lay out her full plan
Fine has to reveal herself to keep AnH from getting destroyed
If I explored that idea, that's basically what I'd do
Maria and DMJii needed LiNKER out the wazoo to run their Gears
but only one was natural
Four
Well
Kanade's raw desire to wield Gungnir probably had an effect on it
Also considering the Gears are basically technomagic and are known to respond to and amplify emotions
<:KanadeSit:535301654464036884>
She was
None of the potentials could use Gungnir or AnH
I think that's kinda what we've been getting at
Yeah
I don't know if it was ever stated that the concert was going to be her last day, but she was frequently coughing up blood and was found passed out on the floor with blood coming from her mouth
and even if she hadn't Zesshou'd, she didn't have long to live
He means that in the manga, Kanade was already dying due to LiNKER use
The whole "It makes you surpass the point where your body's own safety limits kick in so you can hurt yourself by over-exertion more easily"
^
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Or at least not more than once
Either way, more to the point is that in S1 with the LiNKER they had available they likely wouldn't have been able to force compatibility with the Lydian potentials
It was just LiNKER in S1
so that might have just been a label slapped on after the fact to differentiate it
IIRC it was only ever called Model-K after a second type was introduced
Then again
I might be as well
It would have bypassed several of those steps
If fine just blew the moon tf up
She only got woken up by Gear bullshit and attempting to reactivate the moon
Plus Shem-Ha wouldn't have been a thing
Yeah
It didn't fix/rebreak, but it got further damaged by forcing it to operate when it was already in a non-functional/damaged condition
Since Airgetlamh wasn't supposed to be functional at all and just got overloaded with Phonic Gain
The forced X-Drive
Yeah
And Kanade's gear was already damaged but I'm pretty sure her pendant was damaged too
Serena's pendant cracked iirc
Zesshous when fatal to the user, at least
Since Zesshous and the forced X-Drive that the damaged Airgetlamh underwent in G have been shown to also cause damage to the pendants
Which is why I was thinking it was different when it was an outside influence
Like, Chris did that on purpose
That was also internal stress though
lol
Clothes are stored in the Gear
Since the pendants being destroyed is why the gears couldn't operate in GX
That would lend credence to the idea that the gears are gone, or at least inoperable for now, though
Or were they only kicked out of Ignite
Didn't they get force shutdown when they tried to Ignite vs. the alchs?
I'd be more interested in AXZ or G
I mean we already knew that in GX they got shut down due to the pendants being damaged
Singing about the power to do things alone vs. the strength of having people to lean on
Maybe during that scene when they all end up fighting Noise together while Chris is living in that abandoned apartment and Miku is helping her
Bikki/Chris could have had a really fitting "dueling" duet a la Fushichou no Flamme in S1
yeah
like wasn't Chris basically their guardian
It's kind of a shame on the Chris front since weren't they all supposed to be hanging out together after G/during GX
strange
and yeah Hibiki with no duets except Hitsuai Duo Shout and the Miku duet is
But Chris never sang with either of them unless it was a full group song
Or at least a couple
Again though, no duets between Maria and Kirika or Shirabe is understandable given that they have several trio songs
Maria (and DMJii) or Chris and DMJii
And/Or is important wording
Same with Chris, if she had had a song with either of them she'd have had a song with both of them
Also I understand Maria not having duets with DMJii individually, since they have a handful of trio songs ~~and DMJii are basically two halves of a whole character~~
Hibiki not having duets with the other main trio members is kinda sad
So, in the end, duets that we never got: (for the main 6 at least)
Hibiki/Tsubasa (kinda surprised about that one)
Hibiki/Chris (also kinda surprised)
Hibiki/Maria (*also* kinda surprised)
Hibiki/Shirabe
Tsubasa/Kirika
Chris/Kirika
Chris/Shirabe
Maria/Kirika
Maria/Shirabe
And she was happy
I could see her one more time
after everything
I'm just glad that
She was here
Or were Ogawa's brothers first shown in XDU
Did I just forget
Also wait
Thank you, Symphogear
Thank you, Kanade
Never give up on living
May the songs in your heart play on forever and ever
Well then, since this channel will probably be locked when I wake up
Not yet, I will wait for the BD release
Metanoia = Vitalization > Synchrograzer > Testament > Glorious Break
For finales, I'd say
I have expressed my feelings about Glorious Break in the past
I really liked Stardust Foton (and not *only* because Kanade,  because it showed us what a Gear can *do*) and Horizon Cannon
Not just the finales
If we're just talking about *any* attack
Superficially my vote still goes to Vitalization
as an "attack"
I was really happy with Metanoia
Yeah
~~but I guess Minami is too busy with Conan and Yui is too expensive~~
~~even if they'd had to use archive audio I really wish they could have made it 8-part or even 9-part~~
I feel like those are going to make me emotional for a long, long time
That final song and the 7-part Gyakkou
The episode 13 music in particular
though tbh this is probably the first time I am *definitely* more excited for the group songs/bonus CDs than the actual charasongs
But yeah, this weekend I'm going to rip all the charasong CDs (as well as the OP/ED) and give 'em all a listen
we talking six levels of Sora e...?
I wait until after the season finishes to listen to the music for Gear
No, I haven't listened to any of the music that wasn't featured in the show
I thought it was just a "He got shot and they're gonna have to send him off to the hospital for a while"
but I totally didn't know that Yatsuhiro actually *died*
or didn't realize in the first place
Either I forgot in my 5-week+ hiatus between episode 11 and the finale
also I gotta say
*spirit of Sakimori*
and gained some of the uh
She went to LON DON with Tsubasa
He was fused with Nephilim at that point
because I saw a lot of myself in her
I disagree with G Maria not being sympathetic
join the club
lol
*great*
can you get dupes
no Kanades <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
two high/higher-rarity cards compared to the main six's 6 cards with more common cards
I mean given the number of former 5*s I've seen I'm assuming the rates are different/there's more of them/it's not based on XDU card ranking but still
Since she only has two cards and they're both 5*
Actually I just realized that getting a Kanade right now is super unlikely
can I please get more Kanades
and which are in the Grand Opening Gacha
which Kanades are in the AU gacha
or actually
but is XD Kanade in the AU gacha
I know there are more Kanades in the AU gacha
Maria is busy celebrating her sister's birthday
same, but for my Valkyrie
I'm assuming you need to have the serena tag
I would choose not to
While I appreciate the thought
I'd just be happy to be rid of this rate-*down* I seem to be afflicted with
man at this point I don't even want a rate-up
whoever made this stacked it against me
I have one
everyone has a shitload
I still have exactly one Kanade
Can't get any Kanade tokens if I don't get any Kanades
Because my entire thing is wanting the one girl that the game isn't giving me
I'm gonna need to do that
The fact that it calls them "Chris Tokens" would imply that
So like I need Chris tokens to get a specific Chris
Are the tokens gear specific
that awakening art is dumb as fuck, I wanna max it
which actual XDU card is that
dual-wielding scythes lmao
I have a couple Chris tokens from pulling the same 3* Chris like eight times
I have lots of coins
She might not be Hibiki-tier but Kanade still has an ass
Oh that's just cruel
~~your waifu is not in your pool~~
every time I get deceased, red-headed, spear-wielding anime female it just guesses that one chick from Madoka
>akinator
but at the same time most of the other people that are actually playing have 1-2 copies of 1-2 different cards
It doesn't help that the odds are super stacked against me
I am the only person in this server who can't pull Kanades
and pulled *one* Kanade
3500 coins into this so far
considering I've put like...
It's a ways off yet but I'd rather maximize my luck
July 28th
Then I will save
but you're basically doing a character rate-up for birthdays
will that be a thing
Are you gonna do a birthday gacha
but there are not enough Kanades
So I decided I'd save until good KanaGacha occurred
Me
RV gacha was rude to be
maybe more now that I've missed a few daily timelies
Someone else has a couple hundred more than me
I actually don't have the most of anybody here <@!388516680742993933>

Or Hibiki is Biki
Like how Tsubasa is in as Basa
She's in her system as Prae
Made possible by Saki's hard work making Maria even better!
DESS NUTS LMAO
Hahaha just like XDU the actual Kanade Swimphogear isn't available until later
There's one each of the other main girls
and then a couple fillers units so I can't be accused of purely stacking the deck
12 Kirika cards
20 Chris cards
It's like
yay, the drugs have kicked in now!
dess_give 100 <@!102691114762371072> get another bonus pull
YUSSS
She's the only Jii card in the gacha
I tried to give you Roborabe too
Impact Slayer is dope
Oh shit nice
it was probs the colon
eventually
I'll get my fucking Kanades
Also this is 100% paying it forward for me making myself the bestest Kanade gacha ever on my birthday lmao
pulls are 100
timely is 75
I hope you get good Chris cards!
There we go
dess_give 100 <@!102691114762371072> Make it an even 20!
uh
wait
dess_give <@!102691114762371072> 100 Make it an even 20!
don't

Need to name a gacha
I think you mentioned it being a pain in the ass once or twice
you made it so easy
dess_give 200 <@!102691114762371072> refund for getting two cards you weren't supposed to
dess_$
Search your own name and "rv_pull" and look how far away you were last time you pulled
best of luck to your pulls!
For the record this Gacha has every Serena available to date in XDU ~~except the one that came out like two days ago soz~~ but she still makes up only about half the gahca
you get rewarded with card art from XDU
You put them into one of the gachas
You collect tokens
XDU with marginally less gameplay and a lot less money
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Ah... no, the Bandori units are not in the Costume Party Banner
rv_gachalist
ty Saki
no worries
<:KanadeSinging:421432676789256202>
since it means my daily reset is just gonna creep closer and closer to when I have to leave for work until I'm missing days because I can't do it before work starts
For me personally at least the 24h one is kinda inconvenient
Can I request we go back to the 20h timer?
And I think it's only in the Miku B-Day gacha
She's not really "on a piano" it's more like a keyboard
To my knowledge, the last update was in November IIRC
idk if that's gonna happen though
Been waiting for a gacha with better Kanades since the RNG was cruel to me at the start
dess_$
hmm?
It happens
Eh
Happy Birthday you adorable little moron, you!
would you look at that shiny new **Kirika Birthday Gacha**
that's new ain't it
Oh hey what's that

ALRIGHT

Part of me says "just pull 327" but I'd be sitting here for a looooooooong time
dess_$
alright so then
Thanks!
~~I was wondering if the description was gonna get vetoed~~
My favorite butt
If you really just want the art there's a MEGA folder pinned in <#336298054724485131> that has all of the (released) art assets from the game
It definitely is
So like if you pull 3 on Costume Party, 1 on Happy Birthday Shirabe, and 1 on Happy Birthday Kirika, you'll get an extra pull from Happy Birthday Kirika since you pulled it last
get an extra card every 5 pulls, regardless of which banner you pull on
100 coins for every pull
That's meant to be exploring/spelunking equipment, from the dungeon explorers event
and because a user spent a long time working on it
Collect cards without the bullshit that is *actually playing* XDU
Because it's fun
so I can give them more Gifts
I'm just waiting for more people to get their timely
I think I pulled 360 cards from Maria today lol
Oh, I should be in the other channel, whoops
rv_pull "Happy Birthday, WFC!" 10

He was half-Japanese half-Mexican IIRC so his name was like Chad Yasuhito or something like that

What was his name
uh
It reminds me of

Okay two different ones

beautiful Kanade
rv_mycard VALKYRIE
oh right
wait
rv_mycard Valkyrie
That's kinda what SSJ looked like to begin with in G
That first one up there was the second one added
Yeah everybody ~~except Serena~~ has at least two solo X-Drive cards
Shirabehameha
Yeah! It's my favorite one honestly
yeah
but if you haven't ever had any you get nothing
but I still get a message
I have 0

... what's the command again...
rv_myCard VALKYRIE
I only have one I really like
Peach clothes
Kimomo
http://i.imgur.com/Lqh9Klr.jpg there's a really goddamn cruel joke in here somewhere
She has a couple lines
thanks for looking
oh well
damn
yeah
does Okonomiyaki lady have a name
Never stated but heavily implied to have been Miku
No panties for the first part, completely naked for the second (when Okonomiyaki lady leaves), then it cuts to Hibiki at school talking to her friends and worrying about Miku, then it cuts back to Chris getting dressed
she and Hibiki are both fighting Noise in the same time at the same place
I mean
At least a few minutes pass with Chris and Miku off-screen alone together, plausibly longer depending on how you interpret some stuff
between Miku meeting Chris and Chris leaving to go fight Noise with Hibiki
there is a plausible time gap during these events
but hey I got the answer to my question
at the moment, in my head
I resent that line of questioning and the implications it carries
it's the okonomiyaki shop
yeah
hahaha I just got to them opening the front door and walking out
it's Miku's house
I was remembering the sequence wrong
Oh hey it's not an abandoned building
8 is Miku tending to Chris in the abandoned building
9 is Genjuuro meeting chris and tsubasa deeto
it's 8
Miku straddles Bikki in 9 or 10 iirc and it's on one of those flood embankment things
alley/building I thought
does anyone happen to remember which episode of S1 Miku and Chris meet in the abandoned building
nooooooooooo
explains the love of tig ol bitties
Tsubasa: actually super into mom-dom
Maria: "Trust me it's just easier this way Kanade"
from what I've gathered
and Miku is brainwashed/"drunk" in Gravity
since in the first one Ryoko is effectively lying about her identity and is more than slightly pushy with Gen
The ones that remain concerning are the GenjuuRyoko fic and Gravity
And yeah, for most of them I tried to either imply or state that the characters were already in sexual relationships, and when I didn't, I tried to directly state consent
Several of them do feature one character being somewhat uncomfortable but in those scenarios most of the time I was going more for them being nervous than (even somewhat) unwilling
since apparently "almost all" of my stories are dubcon *at best* according to this guy
again though I'm less concerned with Helping Hand and more concerned with everything else
It's not tagged with non-con, no
Kirika is molesting Chris in her sleep and then sticks it in without asking later
I mean he's kinda got a point about Helping Hand
Yeah but the complaints with that one are at least semi-legitimate. It's the other stuff I'm worried about
I just use it because it's better than pastebin or ff.net for hosting
ao3 is just fanfiction in general
I do get the complaints about Helping Hand but the rest of it
but those at least get to the implied consent level
I can see where someone might take issue with Senpai's Night In or Take Comfort In My Warmth
That's what I thought I did a good job of
I'm more concerned with the "Nearly all your fics have glarisin issues with consent and comfort" part
but that's not really what I'm concerned about
He seems to be mad that Chris is so open to sex
but I'm trying to see where those thoughts even came from or where they got that idea
Just some idiot complaining
this is seriously bothering me
<@!127644949884698624> I know you read my bullshit
also has *anyone else* come to the conclusion that "being raped made chris kinky" in the exhibitionist fic?
But for the most part I feel like I either establish that the characters are in openly sexual relationships, go out of my way to give direct verbal consent, or at least do the hentai thing of implied consent
now I will admit that the specific fic in question (A Helping Hand) doesn't handle that in the best way
Accusing me of writing rape and non-con fantasies
I just got a rather concerning message on ao3
How many people here read/have read my fapfics
okay I've got a question
https://pastebin.com/Ppru12U0 new reply
I'll probably make another, much shorter reply explaining that I had several people go over it and none of them found the supposed consent issues (barring Helping Hand) and that if they'd like to talk more about it they can
I've got to leave for work pretty soon so I won't be looking at Discord for a few hours, but if you think something needs my immediate attention please don't hesitate to PM me or drop an @ mention
Well thank you very much
I understand I can't please everyone, but something I've always been very stern about is making sure everyone is always willing and consenting in my stories. If someone is accusing me of failing to do that, and not just in one story, but "almost all" of them, that bears weight and I feel like it deserves a proper response
http://archiveofourown.org/users/wantfastcars/works here's my stuff
I'd really appreciate that actually
Oh sure
If someone would read it and tell me whether or not they think it's a good idea to send I would appreciate it
https://pastebin.com/bttBGsYe the first part is the initial message, and after the line break is the response I intend to post
Okay I know we talked about it last night but I don't feel comfortable letting this accusation hang without a response to it
and vag is eternal
but hearthstone is temporary
you don't get to play with your vagina for a while
you get to play with the hearthstone expansion immediately
well think about it this way
that's a hell of a step
seriously though congrats
wouldn't want to break your new toy
though I get the idea you're gonna be mighty sore for a while afterwards
then have some fun with your shiny new vajayjay
for the lulz
do eet
I knew it was coming up soon but I didn't know it was *this* soon
Oh shit, it's this week?
fair enough
in fact, that's kind of the point
dicks can in fact get big
Doesn't mean I can't consent, just means I'm gonna be a nervous wreck
I mean I'm still a virgin but I've got a list of concerns a mile long before I hop in bed with someone
Well considering all but one is gay
which I can kind of see where he might be coming from if authorial intent didn't bleed into the story well enough?
The only way I think (but this is with authorial intent and my own knowledge) that the guy could have come up with "most" of my stories having comfort issues is if he's misconstruing (what is supposed to be) nerves about their first time - since a lot of them revolve around someone's first time - as discomfort with the concept of having sex in general
lol
it feels scattered and rushed
honestly Exhichrisionism is probably my least favorite of my own works
since innocence play skeezes me out
I wouldn't do more with that tone at least anyways
it depends
maybe
well
Because what I was *trying* to go for there was "The only person who cared at all about Chris being pleasured was Fine, so that's the only thing Chris has to go on for trying something new because masturbating the same way over and over gets boring"
Did anyone else interpret that opening as "Being molested gave her weird fetishes"?
Also "getting raped made her kinky" for Exhichrisionism
I do establish explicit consent in almost everything I write, right?
But for real though, I'm not crazy, right?
TsubaMari could be argued either way tbh but it's honestly my favorite pairing
HibiMiku and DMJii are both effectively canon at this point
Alice is ever so slightly gay
boners are annoying
Hopefully you'll have it figured out whenever I get this finished
Well
lol
I need to know a rough deadline
hey when can you masturbate again
You aren't allowed to touch yourself until doctor onee-san says it's okay
just think of it as the ultimate orgasm denial setup
good luck
so
I'd make some clever play on your joke but honestly I haven't a single sexual goal to achieve by thanksgiving
kek
I hope your recovery keeps going well though and that you can play with your new toy soon enough
nah I'm kidding I'm gonna go play video games
I'll do it now
but just to make you jealous
I mean I wasn't planning on it
I can masturbate
if it makes you feel any better
well
Oh alice btw how's your vagina doing
Or to buy lube for that matter
Don't really have the privacy to properly clean myself as I'd need to to try it
Just saying I haven't done it *yet*
Not saying I'm not
I cannot say I know what you mean
as someone who has yet to shove anything up their butt
so I'd imagine most pain/pressure stemming from it would feel really weird
You are physically unused to having a vagina
I mean
I wanted to save it for a futa fic but it was too good to pass up
I hope your surgery goes well tomorrow Alice!
There's 5 now and it ended I think
okay
I think you might like it
<@!127644949884698624> have you read Is My Hobby Weird
like come on man what the fuck
The other one is full length... but tentacle rape
Two are TsubaKana and really short
It's like how there's three Kanade doujins
yeah
I would not enjoy it at all
Like if I had to choose between that and a rape doujin I'd pick the fat old men but blugh
God I hate fat old men
since they're so much either faceless producer-san or just fat old men
but they're few and far between
Occasionally there's a decent het doujin for LL or IM
while Symphogear gets ten
and LoveLive gets like a thousand doujins
like if 10% of doujins are good
there's just such a massive quantity overall
I think it's less that a lot of it is good and more that they get SO MUCH porn that even with a normal percentage being good
pervert
Probably just because you haven't hand the chance
you are one kinky motherfucker
man
I thought you had barely figured out how to get yourself off at this point
There's a difference between Kanade and Hibiki doing cute things together and Kanade tying Hibiki up, jamming a vibrator inside her, and then leaving her there like that
Why you gotta break up HibiMiku like that
couldn't you at LEAST do KanaBasa or SereNade like a normal person
It's like
why is the only person that regularly draws Kanade lewds a die-hard HibiKana shipper <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
otherwise I overthink it and make shit too complicated
I occasionally rewrite a sentence here or there but it works better for me to just write my first thought
next to no editing
I also do like
I know for a fact I'd miss at least one going back
also nope
and every time I keep typing the first couple letters and then going "Wait no"
so I can't use character B's name
and it's written from character A's perspective
in the setup I'm writing right now, Character A doesn't know Character B's name
this is actually hugely annoying
okay
it's just intentional, not "Oh I guess I'm horny now, time for a wank"
I still masturbate once a day most of the time
I mean
random boners become hugely less common after your hormones calm down
afterwards substantially less so
extremely
During puberty
it's like "No goddammit not for you"
they are the hardest part about writing smut
why the fuck doesn't exhentai have an onsen tag
Seven story chapters and two bonus chapters
""For those of us with good taste, I bring you a manga entirely about butts. This manga just might be the greatest thing ever." - Yuri-Ism. Truth."
butts, exhibitionism, voyeurism, and yuri
Not five
Seven chapters
Oh
If you liked it it's worth finishing
She's a fully fledged part of the last chapters
okay
Did you meet the third girl yet?
yeah that one
it was blue
do you remember what it was called
hey alice were you the one that told me about that website that lets you list out all your fetishes and stuff
I have yet to brave one
It's about a dude and two mummy chicks
"Sore wa Rekishi ni Kakanaide!"
let me check what it's actually called lol
I favorited it on ex
Uh
and lo and behold it was the same artist who did the mystery doujin I'd been looking for for so long
like "Wait I've seen her before, in other porn"
because I recognized a background character in one panel
I was checking out other things by the artist of the doujin I was reading
I'm nowhere near akihabara
lol
it
damn
god
>tfw you just finished and then find a doujin you've been looking for for years
but the person who catches them not realizing they caught someone banging?
getting caught
is there a name for like
also I don't *dislike* BDSM, I just don't like humiliation and BDSM in hentai tends to fall into the humiliation category
I hated Part V going through it but honestly the more I think about it the more I actually enjoyed it
man I can't wait for the Part 5 anime
hahahah jojo pls
No violence or humiliation
Yuri, but not too hard femdom
problem is searching "public" on ex just turns up results tagged with "exhibitionism" which is not quite the same thing in all cases
it's like a really specific subtype of exhibitionism
It's not just exhibitionism though
Is there a name for that? the "getting caught without actually getting caught"?
maybe even making a comment or two on how lovey-dovey they seem to be acting or making a joke about how he used to be like that with his wife or something
and he's old so he's blind or the steam is really thick or something and he has *no* idea that he just ran into a couple who are literally attached at the hips
and then an old man comes in and just sits down right next to them and starts making casual conversation
A couple is at a mixed bath and they think they're alone so they start getting it on
like for example
You must not play many violent games then.
A lot of them? Yeah, they *really* do.
And if I did I certainly wouldn't justify my actions by saying "Well I read some porn with it..."
I read a *lot* of shotacon porn, I'm never gonna go fuck a little kid
I think the main argument going on is that bad shit does not lead directly into validating bad actions
Just throwing it out there but I don't think anyone is disagreeing with using bad shit to validate bad actions being bad
I ended up on the other fucking side of the planet by pretending I knew what I was doing I mean he'll freaking crazy is that
It's kind of impressive how many jobs you can get just by pretending you know what the fuck you're doing
I am most assuredly not sober enough to actually use the keyboard on my phone right now so I'm just using the voice to text
That's what I think every day, since I'm in Japan, teaching English
That's what I think since I'm in dining Halloween teaching one-note
dicks be ugly
I agree
Man
I miss bionicle tbh
if I didn't have to fucking *paint* them
Plamo would be so much fun
Chris works wonderfully added to any of the main pairs
I prefer TsubaMari but I like TsubaMariChris a lot
at least based on the doujins I read
except the shotacon ones
among other things
Colloquially boats are girls
Grammatically we don't do it
but it does work
A little informal and can require some finagling
"you"?
uh
so seeing people take it so seriously is just *ugh*
but that's probably because I fundamentally do not believe in like 98% of the shit they post there
I can't stand /x/
small boards like /o/ and /ck/ (and whatever the outdoors board is)  tend to be more benign in general
I played through Sun in like a week but Moon took me ages because I was just using pokemon I wanted to use and it left me with a hideously unbalanced team that made the game unnecessarily difficult
*still hasn't finished Moon*
That sounds amazing I need to play USUM
I mean seriously limiting the guys to "short," "medium," and "shaggy medium" hair? Really?
Sun/Moon still had the FemPC with way better hair options though
femPC all the way solely for the clothing options
Dudes got *shafted*
Pokemon
But yeah holy shit
I still think it's a dumb response
"You picked a female avatar? You're obviously trans and you just don't know it yet!" No, I'm a thirsty guy and the female player character has a nice ass and sexier clothing options
I mean I'm pretty damn sure I just like ass
Christian logic
because the only reason you have free will is to surrender it
God forgives everything only if you ask Him to and give up your free will
and that's mostly because to my knowledge science has yet to explain how the universe actually started
I think there is *a* deity of some sort but I don't know what it is
Agnostic?
I don't know what the word is
I'm uh
I actually really like guns tbh but still
But this is AMERICA this is a CHRISTIAN NATION and JESUS and GUNS and RAMPANT HOMOPHOBIA are the RIGHT THINGS
when people say "the bible is right" they mean "the parts I agree with are right"
There's some fucked up shit there
Yeah
that's scary
fuck man
Especially if both of use were dicking around and/or intoxicated
He already feels bad enough about the one time he forgot to give me a bath towel when I stayed at his house and I had to use paper towels to dry off instead
"Hey remember that time *you fucking stabbed me*"
Honestly if my best friend stabbed me by accident and it wasn't that serious I'd probably just poke fun at him for it for a long time
are any of us
fuck
Just accept that the dude likes it in the ass, none of this "You're being raped by a girldick!" shit
I'm fine with futa on male (or male on futa) but I'm not big on dramatically oversized cocks or feminization
Define tasteful
>.>
Also I'm enjoying reading
This is kinda the rambling channel
thanks alice
but I'll keep the answer in mind
I do know some people who prefer to be addressed and identified as *trans*girl
It seems like it's just a shortening of the word "transgirl" but it seems like it's mostly used in porn and porn doesn't have a good track record with terminology for trans folks
Is the term "t-girl" considered offensive?
Serious, honest question for trans folks here
But either way, I'm too tired and too sober to get into why I believe that right now
Inaccurate my ass
Poly doesn't work because people are inherently selfish and will ultimately abuse others for any bit of personal gain
"Yeah let's all three have a relationship, except I'm only going to bang him and you're going to pay for all of our dates"
I've seen the former and the latter and both cases were just someone who didn't want to give up a meal ticket, while wanting to actually pursue a relationship with someone else
shit happens fast tbh
you seem to try hard to be friendlt and nice
I think
You're a good person
so when he tried to join here and *immeidately* tried to start shit with me, alice let me swing the banhammer
He and I had particular personal beef
to the point where he got banned from the 4chan symphogear server
Bwen was an absolute fuckhead

shit I thought that was like
was me cockblocking bwen from *another* symphogear server really that long ago
yeah there wr go
ping for pics-chan
ping for pics girl
I mean
what would this server beinwithouy ping for pics man
ibu
uby
the classic
you're like
I thought you'd been her elonger than that
o
have I really
my mom hates catholics
which is fundamentally very similar even if my mother would argue against it to her dying breath lmao
Ultraconservative christian, not catholic
I had more privacy in college with an actual roommate than I did at home
I was denied a door lock at the age of 21 because "You have nothing to hide"
That's nice
Wait your parents let you have privacy?
idea
but it's still not a good ida
the answer: probably
s see if I can safely make it to the conbini and back
Let
she's got better characterization than DMJii
fuck off m8
is not psychologically healthy
actually being really in love with a fictional character
like
I mean at the same time it also kinda sucks
and I love her
I can feel her
somehwoe somewhere
but
it will never be
I wanna be with Kanade so badly
at this point my only hope is for HibiMiku to be made truly 100% inarguable canon
they're never gonna kiss
if they didn't kiss in that GX sunset bridge scene
They will never be truly 100% canon
even if its just a one-off joke about Maria syaing she found them naked in bed together at one point
kiri and shirabe need to canonically fuck anyways
dark times
no dmjii
no sunshine
<@!127644949884698624> when was my twitter bot a thing
I joined shorly after laice made my thing
idk
maybe I been here since july
idk
I think
last november at the earliest
so like
less than my new apartment
so like
I've been here less than I came to Japan
that senetence died
I've been her less than I camr eot haajap
Victoria I know is new
e
I coulda sworn Kerrik predated m
wait really
at most
three months
I've ha da couple friend s who went from "I am me" to "wait maybe no" to "I am still me but I am not the me I thought" in like
tbh
rock on girl
You do you alyx
well fuck I'm just gonna stfu now this got way too serious for my drunk BS
functional acloholism is normal
I'm in Japan anyways
but the week before that I didn't
Oh fuck I did get drunk last week lmao
because last week I had no cash and the wek before I went out for something during the day so I couldn't get smashed
pretty sure
I definitely wasn;t drunk last week or the week before
in the long run it works out to roughly tice a amonth
sometimes it's every four weeks
sometiems it's two weeks in a row
I get drunk roughly twice a month
Compared to some people
That's not a lot
Twice a month
I get drunk like
Thanks for selling more alcohol to the plastered gaijin
Cashier 100% knows I'm shitfaced lmao
At least four
There's like
Several
Autocorrect
Autocorrected
With sorriest
Current state: sober enough to realize bad ideas are bad, but drunk enough to ignore that rational thought
trying to drunkenly explain in ajapense that I forgot my wallet
that would have been awkward
lmaoooooooooooo almost left my apartment without my wallet
brb paying electriicty bill and acquiring more drink + snacc
this server is older than rthat
I call bullshit
no
what
I really didn't get along with her at all
"friend" is a strong word
The kind of person who cheated on her boyfriend and insisted it wasn't cheating because it was with a girl
She was also kind of an idiot
just trans folks and eggs
that there's literally no such thing as a cis person
I had a friend in college who sincerely insisted that
Please don't tinymiku
this just in, wfc is not real
I am a myth
do ya thang girls
But honestly I am happy for you all
and being drunk mkes it shitty humor
please understand my inability to process emotions in a mature manner manifests as humor
I apologize I am drunk
I wanna eat skittles off Kanade's titties
titty skittles
lol
I'll come back alive even if it kills me - Hibiki 2014
death is survivable
I meant thst about the psychologis thing
I'm sorrt
Timing
bad toming
wait
Good for you!
if the context it needs is *other shows* then that's not good writing imo
that's suffering for the sake of suffering
"here's a cute show lmao wait no you thought wrong dipshit"
disillusioning the audience *is* suffering for the sake of suffering though
*did like
Plus it doesn't help that everything regarding you-know-who was basically everything I don;t like in an anime happening to the one character I didn't like
so I wasn't super enthusiastic from the getgo
but I got really pushed into watching it
I honestly felt like Madoka was suffering for the sake of suffering
"There's an antagonist" and "I watched my friends get tortured to death in front of me" are entirely different
Problems and suffering aren't the same thing
I like the characters but I don't like the story
I don't like Madoka tbh
just let everyone be happy
I watch anime and play games as escapism
I don't like suffering
^^
<:KanadeSinging:421432676789256202>
I know you were
I know
I need a new hat
SAME HAT
but I'm drunk
usually I'll just let it blow over because I know those people deal with a serious quantitiy of bullshit
I got nothing against trans folks, do ya thing, but people who insist *everyone* is trans or imply that being cis is somehow inherently inferior or being an incomplete person really get on my nerves
it was great trying to be her friend
Basically by virture of being a cisgendered mostly heterosexual male I was inferior in her eyes
fighting 20 years of ultraconservative christian programming
like I said, still working on this shit
Though I suppose that does come from the preconceived notion of "what defines a woman"
like you're saying "That woman doesn't look like a woman"
That makes sense, but the former still seems rude
That's fair and logical
typically supported by societally enforced ideas about what "boy" and "girl" consist of
The way I see it is a "gender binary" is the idea that there are only two genders - "boy" and "girl"
I'm still learning about a lot of this shit because until recently I was still in camp "Gays are bad and transgender people don't exist"
then again the person who taught me most of the shit I know about progressive sex and gender stuff also kinda went off the deep end so maybe her info wasn't the most solid
so it's better to talk about biology
that using masculine and feminine just enforce the gender binary
see I was told the exact opposite lmao
alright
Yeah please don't misinterpret this as saying your art is bad, it's just not my preferred style
Ah
I don't know what TERF is but I will say I used that term because I've had people complain that masculine and feminine are inappropriate to use in these situations
IMO DL's art leans more towards masculine physiques (broader shoulders, narrower hips, overall more square torsos), which is more reminiscent of a bio-male body than just an exceptionally fit or muscular girl
I like fit/muscular women
neither would I
I will say that I appreciate you're one of the short list of people who still draws Kanade on a somewhat-regular basis
Exactly
I like the style but I'm not overly fond of how super masculine they look sometimes
argue*
too masculine, some would argu
geahs with extremely masculine bodies
apparently he finally got banned over there too
like bwen lol
I left voluntarily because the mod was joining with the harassers instead of doing literally anything else
I wasn't modded
alright, fair enough
I try to avoid telling people to die or kill themselves because I struggled with that shit for a while
I don't actually remember what I said
because I usually lean towards the latter
also did I actually tell them to die or did I tell them to go fuck themselves
considering I politely asked him to stop *several times*
I got upset
so
What's-his-fuck wouldn't shut up about her being dead and a mod started spamming it too
Because the whole server was being intentionally antagonistic
Were you paying attention to the context
because I am definitely an asshole but I try to keep it mostly internal
I mean I still want to know what I'm doing to be an asshole
I'm still curious
Though I'm curious about the specifics
He's got a point
That's about all I got
I'm confident that I'm an asshole
but yeah we can shit on it too
I mean I was making a joke based on the fact that most trans people I know seem to have a shitload more self confidence than I do
like "How do I make friends" and "Does anyone *actually* like me"
We have other fun problems
So why did he talk shit about having underage nudes and lose his shit about the cops getting on his ass for pictures he didn't have
everything he did rubbed me the wrong way
sorry I shouldn't talk so much shit about him but man
not just pain to add to pleasure
Like the actual idea of causing substantial bodily harm
I think it's called ryona or something?
and there's what Bwen was into
there's hitting people
but at the same time
I mean to an extent physical violence can be a fetish
and his actual defense of distributing underage nudes and blackmailing someone was "I was drunk, it doesn't count"
there's that
so
He also tried to argue that it wasn't rape if there was a physiological reaction of arousal
Like he legitimately did not understand why doing something bad would cause people to dislike him
But the man genuinely had no concept of consequences or right/wrong
I'm actually not sure what the PC word is
I genuinely think he had some sort of mental... what's the right word, disorder? Disability?
I had issues with Bwen a *long* time before he got anywhere near the Valkyrie server
rip
Japan almost scored
noooooooooo
makes it a bad server
That letting bad folks persist in a server defined by it's populace
I'd argue
I mean
"What the fuck did you just fucking say to me you little bitch? I'll have you know..." I don't remember the rest
smaller communities with a short list of active members >>>>>>>>>> big communities where it's hard to keep track of who's who
I know the term but I forget the meaning
What's truscum again
I'm an asshole for unrelated reasons
if you're drinking
six
like
not even
for eight seconds
and be a decent human being
fuck off
just
fuckheads calling ProtoMagicalGirl "ProtoMagicalBoy"
imagine being such a shithead that you can't just call a transgirl a girl
but that doesn't make it less shitty
having come from the 4dhan server in the first place I get that mindset
maybe the valk server should stop tolerating such shitty behaviro thenm
so
Pulling dramatic changes immediately also leaves people dead
It's not a good situation right now, but trying to implement a massive cultural change is just gonna get the conservatives to dig their heels in harder
Making dramatic changes all at once does nothing but divide the populace
that'd do the trick right quick
I mean if you want to round up and execute the far right
"If the change can't happen overnight then it's not fast enough"
People say "Well if it's gonna be slow, why even bother"
but that's the exact problem
It can, it's just slow
that too
and that's rarely a good thing because it usually results in a lot of unnecessary violence
not without, well, revolution
there's no "ripping the band-aid off" for cultural shifts
Making big changes takes a long time
The french also killed a shitload of people in the process
People who cannot accept that you can't make dramatic changes in short time frames
who say "Obama wasn't liberal enough so why did he even bother"
And then on the other hand you've got those people
Pushing too hard will just cause resentment from the apathetic
and take a look at what Solopy just wrote
maybe that's not the right way to put it
well
the right-wingers are the problem though
Looking at right-wingers, pushing really hard for change doesn't do anything other than make them upset
Thank you for putting that so eloquently
^^
but it's better than just making everyone angry
It's not ideal
but yeah
I mean 1930s Germany had some other issues brewing
which means the people trying to change are unhappy because people are fighting harder against change, and it makes the people who don't want change unhappy because the change is active and obvious
Trying to change it all at once is a bad plan because it just makes the resistance resist harder
Trying to change the system is not a bad thing
I'm not quite sure how to put it into words other than what I've been saying this whole time
Again, no, it's not
I am saying that the US is not culturally ready to go full on into being culturally left-wing, due to the obstinate, contrarian nature of many conservatives
There is nothing wrong with that
Yes
Exactly
But my life tells me that ripping the band-aid off is the wrong answer
I am not a politician
I don't know what the solution is
Trying to do everything all at once will just make things worse
It needs to be changed
The system is broken
And that makes me the evil moderate who just wants everyone to keep their heads down and do nothing and accept things as they are
My life experience and the people I know and the experiences I've had have lead me to my beliefs about how the world works
so I feel like there's not really any need to continue this conversation
I mean I think you've already made up your mind about me
Now when did I say do nothing
Upsetting the position in power is a fast way to get the boot to come down even harder
Making people angry does nothing
Exactly
Don't rip the band-aid off
But go ahead, put words in my mouth
I said that's the shit that pisses off right-wingers
I didn't say that
which is kinda exactly what I was talking about
My nutbag fundie parents watch it
Modern Family is doing pretty well afaik
You get them to slowly accept things rather than trying to force it on them
Add a gay character to an existing show or have a gay secondary character? Neat, go for it
Have a show *about* a gay character? You can bet your ass the right wing is gonna go nuts
Take, for example, TV shows
Again, having grown up in the right-wing culture, "fighting hard" is a fast way to get people to just dig their heels in and just say "look at these people who think they deserve the time of day"
which doesn't work for anybody
It's just serial escalation
It makes them try harder to stop you
My experience says otherwise
🤷
having grown up in it
especially against the right-wing conservative culture in the US
all fighting hard does is make your opposition hate you more
but that issue also comes from capitalism
significant infrastructure issues can arise
eh, not the *only* cost
just kill everybody tbh
People are bastards and any system with people in it will eventually fail
No disagreements here
Indeed
If you're talking about massive financial gain, then yes, luck and exploitation
But the world is so much more complicated now that that shit just doesn't work
You could go out, buy some land, get some cows, and have a farm and make a living with honest, simple work
US just hasn't caught up with itself
The thing is a couple hundred years ago that was true
An innate Us vs. Them mentality and the twisted extreme of the "To each what he deserves, from each what he owes"
and people manage to consistently ruin everything
Political systems have... *people*
Computer systems at least obey their own rules most of the time
and is pretty glossed over in public education in the US
And understanding how voting and how the government actually works takes a good bit of study
*not necessarily "all" but a large portion of at least
Part of it too is the political system in the US, on the surface, looks like the President holds all* the power
local elections matter more than people think
IIRC 2016 was a fair bit lower than usual though
but the US does historically have low-turnout
the 2016 election was a shitshow all around
That too
I would disagree
but I remember finding it interesting
not gonna lie I don't remember a lot of it
I took a course on hinduism in college
I like studying religion tbh
I have problems with some of the people, and "The Church" as an organization
well, I do, but it's purely personal stuff, not conceptual stuff
I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with Christianity
Not being obligated to go to a southern baptist church 3+ times a month is doing wonders for my mental health
literally had teachers fired for not being Christian enough
the former
well
On a scale of "We use the Bible to justify hating minorities and feeling morally superior to everyone" to "We actually read the damn thing and paid attention to what Jesus said"
that white-skinned, blonde-haired, blue-eyed man's-man wouldn't want you to pay for other people's lives!
exactly
then again I basically went to Jesus Camp for high school so they probably just would have taught us to pray our taxes away
I would have hated it at the time but it would have been fucking useful
Also fucking hell, a home ec class in high school would have been nice
Another stage of life
and in countries where service is mandatory it's just kind of... a thing
where it's heavily glorified and heroic
but I think part of the issue is how the military is treated in US culture
I'm unsure of how I feel about mandatory military service in general
Having a break between HS and college/uni would give more time to explore the world and other fields
and you're asking this of 16-18 year old kids
Because with college (at least in the US, with how fucking expensive it is), you're asking people to make a decision that has an effect on their entire life
There needs to be a break between high school and college
I feel like
i.e. working a "cushy office job" vs. being a plumber
Part of it is an implied ease of life afterwards with the college degree
Go to college, kids! Be in debt for the rest of your life! What do you mean you want to be an electrician? Why not be an electrical engineer! Don't repair the shit that breaks, design shit that won't break! What do you mean "what about the time until the new technology is implemented?"
There's also the (granted, limited, I know) issue of people playing the system
Universal healthcare should be a fucking given
I'm talking housing and shit
I'm not talking medical services
I know what you're talking about
I'm not talking to you
I feel like equating substandard living conditions with death is an unhealthy road to go down, for discussion's sake
rare cases would be a better phrase
or, well, fringe cases isn't the right word
But they're few and far between
There are fringe cases of XXY too
and at extreme temperatures
Newtonian physics breaks down on extremely small and extremely large scales
for extreme situations you need other stuff, but extreme cases exists
But yeah, in general, newtonian physics work in most cases
because they don't quite adhere to newtonian physics
I mean there's an entire class of things we refer to as "non-newtonian"
4chan is just the GIFT in a vacuum
probably the latter
who are usually on the fast track to being cadaveriffic
I think a lot of it is that I tend to like the "Righteous Villain" and "Mentor" archetypes
Kanade? Dead
Mami? Dead
Pyrrha? Not my favorite, but up there, and dead
The original Nazca in KR W? Dead
Lockon Stratos in Gundam 00? Dead
Any of a fair number of Jojo characters? Anywhere from Dead to ***SUPER DEAD***
I have really really terrible luck with picking favorites
like
Mami was my favorite in Madoka too
You want to get your head bitten off?
I miss obvious shit all the time, don't be afraid to call me slow on the uptake on occasion
lmao
There was one of those in my local mall for *years* when I was growing up and I never knew what the hell it meant lol
is *that* what GNC stood for?
wait
gender non-conforming I'd assume
the trick is just shutting up and listening most of the time
That was me a few years ago
not exactly how it works
the only reason I'm still alive is because my parents kept me on such a tight leash I would never be able to get my hands on a gun
but didn't
my boss was supposed to tell me like a month ago
not renewed my contract
but
not actually fired
like
I losyt my job
having problems is just attention whoring when you;re an upper-middle-class white male like me
and literally all I'm doing now is attention whoring so really I Should just shut up
I used to have big dreams but now I crave nothing more than being normal
and *average*
I just want to be *normal*
My life goal is mediocrity tbh
Why bother trying when I can just aim for medioctrity
the more effort I put into something the harder I inevitbaly fuck it up
that's my life
The more I try the harder I fail
because anything I say would just be terrible
don't say anything at all in the serious discussion channel
it's why I like
because I am genreally very consicous of what I think and say here
got it <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
I'm a cunt
so me then
because I shouldn't have problems
which makes me hate myself even more
and I realize I'm just First World Problems: The Perosn
so much
I hate myself
I'm so goddamn lonely
tbh I muted the general chat channel because I just couldn't handle people talking about dates
it's part of why I'm such a cunt
I am a stubborn asshole
I am not generally easily swayed
maybe after a week or two there'd be a "Wait, KA hasn't posted in a while" "IDK where he is" " <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227> " and then I'd be forgotten
nah
Honestly if I died right now literally all I'd be is some paperwork
It's either - or 100
If I haven't fixed myself have I even done anything
recognizing it doesn't mean shit
It's really not
I've been lying to myself for ten years that I'm a decent person
maybe I can be a con artsit
yeah I'm so fucking good at lying
I fucking lied myself into this job
no qualification
I don't contribute
I should just kms
I'm decent at the teaching aspect but horrible at everything else
I'm an English teacher
I'm not competent at shit
a gun would solve all my problems
implying I have skills at anything
hahaaaa
haha
hahaha
alone
I like living in Japan but being homeless is not an option and my Japanese isn't good enough and my bank account doesn't have enough zeroes to live here alin
I will just go home
no no that was a while ago
and being homeless in Japan doesn't sound like a good idea
and my home is tied to my contract
I have a work visa but I didn't get a contract renewal
but that's gonna end in January
my parents are in Colorado and I'm in Japan
I literally live on the other side of the planet RN
wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Young Earth Creationists too
so yep
southern baptist
because woe is me for assuming you weren't being racist shitbags
and my mom and my aunt laughed me into oblivioon
and my answer was "Nah we have street lights"
"Is your neighborhood dark?"
literally
My aunt actually asked
I'm all sorts of a shitty person but at least I dont hate black people
by "good christian boy" I mean "Aggressively homophobic and transphobic who hates black people"
hence the tm
I fuckin' ain't
spoilers
which
and my family only cares about me as long as I'm a Good Christian Boy)tm)
what friends
that'd be it
but
like maybe a question of "Where's KA?" once in awhiel
you wouldn't care
and don't tell me that's not true
the would would be so mcub hebtter without me
my friends wouldn't have a shitty friend
my parents wou;dn't have as hitty son
my boss wouldn't have a shitty employee
if I just was dead no one would have to worry anymore
I am ready to die
I'm just sad because I'm not a good enough Christian
I just need to pray the depression away
and I'm not allowed to have mental illnesses in America because my mom is depressed (sort of) and she's the Only One allowed to Be Depressed
mental illnesses are not a thing in Japan
but
this is true
I need serious help
it
It's all the same shit I do when I'm sober it's just I'md runk so I talk about
being introverted is literally why I'm not keeping my job
and being more talkative
it's better ti actually talk about shit
when I'm sober I'm quiet and introverted
I am better when drunk
lmao
and make my spelling shitty lmso
all it does is remove my filtwer
Being drunk is just me saying what I really feel
I just shut up and don't say anything instead of being an asshole when I'm sober
I am not a decent people
People have an inherent value if they're decent people
I'm in the latter
There's a difference between "actively breaking the rules" and "doesn't help at all"
I bring down the quality of this server
but I honestly have no good features
I get the whole idea of "love yourself before others will love you"
I have no redeeming wualities
like
Why would I care for myself though
and only love me because they belive I'm still christian
they're shitbags
and fuck my parents
mostly my parents
but
like I'm sure people would be sad
no one really cares and I don't really matter
that's a good joke
ha
self care
and nothing to show for it
23 years
my entire life
I've spent ten motnhs in Japan and have fucking nothing to show for it
I haven;t maide my way anywhere
so it might as well be toilet paper
I have a college degree but it's a BA from a generic universirt
yes it is
which would be a step in the right directin
Entertaining suicidal thoughts will get me dead
and right now I'm at 0
0 or 100
I cannot promise comprehensible responses but sure
gooster
alice is a goose confirmed
goose person lmao
gooos person
you're a oog dopdpersin
I know you are
tl;dr I want to fucking die
and that things are only gonna get worse until I either settle into a rhythm of self-hatred or actually kill myself
and that I'm not gonna seek help
I know I'm not gonna change
but honestly
I would
mabe
it;s like "nah bro I should be able to do this alone"
emotionally
but at the same time
relying on other people is okay
like I understand conceptiually that yes
I should be able to do everything myself
but I Can't live away from me
I've been taking the L my whole life so that part's easy
way too goddamn hot
not Arizona
but
like I get your suggestion
*fuck* Arisona
would it be worth it
but at the same time
travelling would be cool
UK might be interesting
like there;s being lonely and being alone and they are not the same thing but in Japan I am definitely both
here
I like living her but at the same time I'm super socially isolated
I'm not sure if I'd even want to stay in Japan anyways
not really
In Japan or in general
'successfully'
I've got about 5mo left in my contract
about 10mo
Colorado
I wish I could go back to high school when I had friends and didn't known any better
Not a bad idea either
It's at least worth checking
and Target is basically Wal-Mart's direct competition, I would assume they do as well
I know Wal-Mart does
Wal-Mart/Target/any of those big stores should sell them
You're doing what's best for you
Phrase it how you will <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
given the context of the scenario
If you do though, I'd definitely be careful how *much* information you give them
idk how running away works tbh so
Might be a good idea
I have to wear shoes like a size and a half too big to fit properly if they don't come in the "Super Double Extra Wide" sizes
I have hobbit feet and it's goddamn awful
I fucking hate my feet
It's not even obviously from a certain culture or language
It's not a place, job, or color
google turns up nothing
Never met another person outside my family with it
My last name is a fucking mystery
Now the real fun begins
Oh hey, I've been awake for 24 hours now
I could always get some delivery health or something but that would just make it worse tbh
I'm very alone and I crave physical affection but I cannot get it
It's just two dudes having fun
It's so good
I don't play Dark Souls at all but I appreciate people who do and Happy Souls makes my heart feel good
I'm so alone fucking hell
RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD
"Support you" more like "Support your decision to get out of my life and thus make it easier"
So 🤷
He's really not, but you're ignoring him and putting words in his mouth anyways
Just that its how things are
He's not saying anything about it being correct
Which just means you've completely shut down
I was actually trying to calm things down at first
Yeah basically
You said Solopy isn't allowed to have an opinion because he is the aggressor
I mean pretty much
Instead we got "Fuck you for existing" and it just went downhill from there
So I was looking forward to learning something about the I-P conflict
I love reading this channel because I learn a lot from it, especially about LGBTQ issues
What I thought was going to be an interesting and educational discussion turned into people getting pissy and shitflinging
And there's a clear lack of respect here
There was never any civility, civility implies respect for one another
lmao
Your experiences don't matter because you're a member of the aggressor
Now wait Solopy, here's how someone from another country tells you why you're wrong
Or as if what country he was born in completely defines his personality and opinions on the world
As if he had any control over that
I'm saying you don't have the right to dismiss an opinion solely due to where he was born
I'm not saying it's right or wrong
So everyone from an aggressor country is responsible for everything an aggressor does, and aggressors are always wrong?
You wouldn't have to entertain my viewpoint, cuz I don't know shit.
I mean, it's common courtesy to entertain first-hand viewpoints
Not as an extension to the first comment
(@popwobbles)
And that's fucked up
You just dug in and from the start refused to accept any viewpoint other than your own
Like I said, I don't know enough to form an informed opinion
🤷
You're the one going "No you're wrong" to everything he says
He's stating opinions and what he knows
He's not though?
I've got no horse in this race, and I'll be the first to admit that I don't know enough about the situation to make an informed opinion on it, but you're literally currently telling someone who has lived through the conflict you're arguing about that they are wrong about it
It's not like you have first hand experience
Your country has no right to exist, you think your opinion matters?
Solopy don't bother
Or maybe an idiot
But that's it
The most I'll do is call you a racist
lmao
I'm glad I can look at more than one facet of a person too, yes.
gdi voice to text
*dismissing
Also, just missing someone's opinion based on race and or ethnicity is uh
I mean, he's British, so you don't have to
lol
I understand you now, but that was really poorly phrased <@256945399338631168>
Did we ever even start?
That was uncalled for
Also Yorin pls
"I am going to disregard a first hand comment from a member of the aggressor"
You literally stated that he's not allowed to have an opinion because he's Israeli
I mean yeah, I'm American, a country that was at one point an aggressor, so it's not like I have an opinion anyways
🤷
So I guess I'll just go back to
And the fact that you think it is means you've completely missed any point potentially made with it
It's not meant to be funny
Look at me, big old Trump supporter here
But Yorin, don't you know, being born in the country means you agree with everything and 100% fully support the government all the time
Which I mean, you advertise from the beginning, but I had a little bit of hope to start with
The thinking Emoji literally means the argument is over, because one side has officially decided to advertise that they have no interest in anything the other side has to say
Aye aye, cap'n. Don't have plans on doing that again.
I do not disagree with the moderation. I was being an asshole. I'm not going to say I regret or feel bad about it, but I broke the rules.
That's the spirit!
Safe travels!
If someone else's point of view is "You don't get to have an opinion because of where you were born" and to get aggressively defensive when called on that, yeah, I'm not going to be super friendly to that person
But when she made her intentions clear, I fully switched into being an antagonistic asshole
At first, I was honestly trying to point out how her opinions were hypocritical *at best*
I will openly admit that I was absolutely being a dick, because how she was arguing was how I argue when I'm drunk, and I know I am terrible at arguing when I'm drunk
Also yeah, it's okay to invalidate Solo based on who he is, but not okay to do the same
Not to mention she *instantly* jump down my throat for attempting to help the clarification
Hence the "extremely poorly phrased"
Exactly
Granted, in large part because he phrased it very poorly
She also completely misconstrued the statement that yorin was trying to make
Also that
Facts are facts, that's why they're called facts
That facts aren't sexist or racist?
At one point in history, women were not allowed to vote. Because they were women.
That's a factual statement
I mean if you don't open with "you don't get to have an opinion" that's a pretty big step in the right direction
Spending my time enjoying a different city
Nah, I'm on vacation
No great loss tbh
Yeah seems like it
Oh hey it is
For something you can't control
But I won't attack you for your gender
Because it would mean less shit for her to have to deal with
Hell, even my boss, who doesn't fucking get it, would be happier if I were just dead
The world would be a better place without me in it
Nah, I'm a racist, sexist, transphobic piece of shit
In the grand scheme of things, there is no reason for me to exist
M you shouldn't get worried, I don't matter
Which would just mean I'd further achieve my goal of being literally mediocre and unremarkable in every fashion
maybe the occasional Postwood, few months or even maybe a year or two after, wondering why I'm not posting anymore, but it would just get buried under people who would just say like oh, he hasn't posted in awhile, I guess he's just not here anymore
And don't you dare fucking deny that, it's the truth
for a couple weeks some people might wonder why I'm not posting anymore in this server, but after that, no one would really even miss me if I were gone
I'm already being replaced at my job, my parents only love me because they think I'm Christian, and no one else loves me at all
Honestly, what would the world's lose without me? Spoilers, the answer is fucking nothing
Then I would at least know what physical intimacy with a person feels like, and I'd still get to be literally nothing in the footnotes of History
Maybe, I'll go to Osaka tomorrow, and get laid, and then kill myself
Honestly, if I died right now, I will achieve my personal goal of just being another face in the crowd
I'd like drinking, it makes me more honest, like, it lets me talk about the fact that I want to commit suicide, because I have no hopes or dreams, or any real reason to be alive, I have no inherent value, and frankly, I don't contribute anything to society, so therefore really I should just died
Part of me screams "just nut up and do it" and part of me says "You're gonna regret that"
When or if I do anything I'm just gonna disappoint myself, fuck up my emotions even worse, or disappoint someone else
Why am I like this
Fucking hell
The very concept of getting laid puts a knot in my stomach that even Gordion couldn't cut
zenbuquest
brodyquest but with zenbu's zenbus
Not saying McCain is a good person, just that that's an enormous generalization
So all republicans are inherently shitty people?
like Alice said, that's going into territory of "I can determine who is and is not a shitty person"
There's a big difference between "I will not mourn this person" and "I will actively celebrate that someone died"
Sure!
so probably don't take my advice
granted I also failed out of my first college
I got into my first college that way
Apply even if you're not qualified
I am too drunk to have a filter rn
exactly
you can forget that you hate yourself
but it's fun
you don't have to no
exactly
it;s who I get drunk with
you have /r/symphogear
yes you do
it's fun
just leep yourself occupied to sty away from the self-loathing
it'a fun
drunk
be like me
just keep trying eventually you'll succeeeded
<@!196360095485919232>  got it right
just jizz in the water and hope for the best
like salmon
scattershot your applications
no harm in applying
doesn't mean I'm good
again
just because we have similar fetishes doesn't mean i'm s decent humsn
I just hide it when I'm sober
I'm right when I'm drunk
hahaha no
people don't like it
I'm not supposed to talk when Im drunk
Ah right
I also believe *I* would do the world a favor by removing myself from it
If it makes any difference
I'm drunk right now but I stand by my opinion that Bwen would be doing the world a favor by removing himself from it
and then his attempt to justify his actions with "I was drunk"
not to mention bwen's decision to attempt to blackmail a girl using nudes she sent when she was underage
with no convictions
which isn't much of a surprise since Symphogi claims he's "patient" but really he means he's a fucking doormat
but recently invited him back
symphogi/dora finally nutted up and banned him
one of the regulars in the /sgg/ server was an actual rape apologist who insisted that a physiological reaction to sexual intercourse was consent
what a fucking surprise
oh look symphogi decided to bitch out and go back on his decision to ban actual pedophile rape-apologist bwen
though I appreciate the thought
It's not a maturity thin
I 100% look like a 43 y-o office worker when I wear a suit and shave
but at the same time
she felt really bad about it
she apologized a lot after
it's super fun
on a similar not Japanese poeple have a hard time guessing white folks ages
I have  a hard time guessing Japanese folks' ages
in their defense
I mean
but that fuckin *hurt*
I've come to terms with the fact that I look older than I am
One of my students guessed I was *40* today
I am 23
fucking comparatives
more simple
simpler
more worrying perhaps but more simple for sure
without it life would be much easier
I hate my crippling fear of death
It's so fucking hard to judge how old people are
it *really* does
like dogs but *hueg*
Bears would make great pets if properly domesticated tho
I'm significatnly less than sober now
Sorry
refriegerate me until bears are domesticated
a guy selling insurance tried to solicit me and made a comment about me drinking and I had to clarify I was only 14
one time when I was 14 I got mistaken for 21
I do look a lot older than I am
but
I mean general maturity does add to it
and therefore inherently bad
I am inherently the problem
I am a white, ostensibly straight, formerly christian male
definitely not
nope
it would make me a better person
I should not be either of those things
I'm straight and cis therefore inferior
I am wrong
you're right
therfore I'm a transphobe
therefore no
I don't know
I mean I consider myself mostly heterosexual so therefore if someone identifies as a girl I should entertain the idea of being romantically or sexually attracted to them
Is there really though
something like "Would you romance a transgirl" has a solid moral correct and incorrect
but
I mean genuinely not knowing is okay
because it's not really "I don't know" it's "I don't want to admit I'm making am orally subpar decision"
Because if you answer "I don't know" it's always the morally worse option
which probably means it's fetishization and therefor bad
which probably means yes
Yes and I don't know
I'd fuck a transgirl in the ass and I don't know if that's fetishization or progressivism and I don't know if that's okay
wait sorry I'm drunk I'm not supposed to talk about that
hip hip how much weight can that 100-yen rope hold again
hip hip hooray
hip hip hooray
three cheers for crippling depression and finally finding independence and being told you're not worth shit
the person I consider my best friend is trans and in her words "it isn't a fate [she] would wish upon her first enemy"
she wanted to be trans and settled on being gay
the kind of "if everyone knew what being trans was no one would be cis" kinda person
this was a cis girl telling me we're both inherently part of the problem
and this wasn't the kind of shit that was venting
I'm usually just sober enough to hide it
I am 100% an asshole
College went from "Trans people are just confused sinners" to "you are inherently a problem for not being trans" in the space of about eighteen months so I'm still trying to figure that shit out
enforced by people telling me that
which sounds like an inferiortiy complex
I'm not allowed to be equal with people
probably
It's just shitty men with a persecution complex
I have a hard time believing that
says
or so she sais
therefore no such thing
misandry isn't a word
spoilers: never
when have I Done anything but cause problems
Nah she's got a point
so I'm wrong
and I'm the asshole because her entire friendgroup says I'm wrong
but if you disagree with her you're an anti-feminist asshole
and she's allowed to have an open relationship when the guy can't
She's allowed to sleep with other women when she's dating a dude because it's a woman therefore it's not cheating
100% trying to tell me something
but she's a feminist so she's right, right
probably not tho
maybe
if anything doesn't prioritize women it's bad
My first feminist friend taught me that
I'm not a girl and I'm not gay and I'm white therefore I'm part of the problem
My first feminist friend taught me that
it's so fluffy
I just want to play with her hair
like it's entirely non-sexual
I'm not sure if it's because I'm *that* starved for physical contact or if it just feels that good
haircut day is my favorite day
I bet Kanade would love it
having your hair played with feels great
it would be wonderful
I want to brush her hair
she's so pretty
I love her
Kanade is great
how about that Kanade
I'm apparently feeling better than I *should* be
so
I mean the doctor was surprised that I haven't had any chest pain and haven't been taking any meds for high blood pressure
basically means having a heart attack is only a matter of time
Family history of heart conditions and high blood pressure (father, both grandfathers and at least two of my great-grandfathers, both of my blood-related uncles, and one of my cousins)
but
which on it's own isn't necessarily a problem
found evidence of abnormally large Q-waves
they took an ECG
went in for a physical today
which isn't really surprising given my family history but I was hoping it wouldn't be so bad
so TIL my heart is basically a ticking time bomb
Maybe twice?
IIRC he only fights *once*
He's more of a side-character than anything
Stroheim the Science Nazi
and am rapidly losing hair in places I want to have it
but that can't fix the fact that I'm ugly and have hair in every place I don't want to
I've been trying to exercise and eat better recently and I have been losing weight
Yeah sure lemme just call up my local plastic surgeon
even if I weren't fat I'd be a low 4/10
maybe when I'm not a generous 3/10
Sure
Yeah
Ha
I'm not supposed to talk about this when I'm drunk
Sorry
but it's better than the alternative of having basically nothing to live for
It's super not mentally healthy
I honestly am completely in love with a fictional dead girl
this is me
this isn't memery, this isn't waifu fuckery
I love Kanade Amou
If you don't see how you were being smugly dismissive you need to take a step back and reevaluate your own position
There's a huge difference between "I don't believe in god" and "God doesn't exist lmao only sheeple believe in God"
There's stating your own beliefs and there's being a smug prick about it
basically "Depression is real sure but you can literally pray it away"
I think my favorite of all time was (paraphrased) "The only reason for depression is not being a good enough Christian"
The lead pastor was a genuinely nice human being but boy howdy sometimes he said some *dumb* shit
I also got voluntold into running my church AV for a couple years
My parents got absolutely livid one time when I suggested that *maybe* America wasn't a supposed to be a Christian nation
but a good diet and exercise can't fix my fingernails and toenails or teeth or bone structure
like I can buckle down and eat right and lose weight and that would help a lot
I hate so many things about myself that I can't change tbh
Being "after one's heart" can be a romantic phrase but "after one's own heart" is a saying meaning that two people share an interest, passion, or point of view on a matter
Nope
It's a phrase, Rakhi
*quality or interest in it be damned*
the only lewds I save are Kanade lewds and that's on the principle that I save all Kanade art I find
no need to save porn when there's so much of it on the internet for free
I don't either, with a couple rare exceptions
Rakhi can't even go in the nsfw channel lol
yeah
no the one in your actual picture is still the regular 1000-yen bill
oh rip I thought you were saying you had the Natsume Souseki one
I'd keep it just because once you spend it it'll be really hard to get one with that design again though
I mean US money from the 70s still works
AFAIK it'll still work fine
Yeah but any time you talk to someone, having them report it to the people you were specifically avoiding telling is worse
Someone ran over a cat
Oh fucking rip
I'm used to just bottling shit up and sitting on it because talking about things has invariably either done nothing or actively made things worse
Also I live in Japan, where mental health is even more of a joke than in the US
You say that like a psychiatrist isn't the first person in the laundry list of reasons why I don't trust anyone I can actually see
Hahaha
they have *immediately* proven why I shouldn't have done that
every time I have opened up to someone in real life about my problems
Because as much as I hate being cynical
no
The last person I tried to talk to locally about this proved my cynical "don't trust people you actually know" stance right once again so
yeah but I'm not supposed to talk here when I've been drinking
sorry for ranting
Nor is it my fault that my predecessor was a *career teacher* and I'm just some ugly motherfucker from Colorado
nor is it my fault that my predecessor *chose to leave* rather than stay with you
It's not my fault you were so bad at your job you got sentenced to the middle of nowhere rather than your bigger-city hometown
Fuck you bitch, you're mad at me for not doing my job, then you're mad at me for doing my job
"You don't talk to the students enough"
>goes to talk to the students
>boss interrupts me *in the middle of a sentence* while talking to students
"Have you clocked out to go home yet?"
on top of her getting mad at me for not doing a thing, and then later getting mad at me for doing that same thing
plus my other boss has been withholding information from her specifically for the sake of lettiner my first boss chew me out
*especially when I have explicitly told you how I've been doing it*
don't wait until I've made mistakes for *months on end* before chewing me out for having fucked it up for months
tell me when I fuck up
professional courtesy is the fuckign minimum
this is my first real job
but woman
I understand I've not been the best employee
Rather than telling me the first time, even after I've *reported to her that I've done it (apparently) wrong*
She waits until I've made a mistake many times before telling me I'm messing it up
also my boss is a fucking cunt and when I'm sober I won't say this but I fucking hate her
and that was the end of the discussion
They told me "You have nothing to hide"
I said "Because I want privacy"
they asked me "why?"
when I was 18 I asked for a lock on my door
My parents didn't either
considering the one who had the audacity to suggest that the world wasn't a literal seven-day creation was promptly fired for teaching that
in hindsight almost all of them where hyperconservative nutjobs
I had teachers who I thought were nice at the time
and also >3/10
I'm not a club person
but at the same time
Clubs exist
read: if you're hot
Not off me
Of me*
If my input is desired it will be requested off me, right?
Like if they want to talk to me they'll initiate the interaction right
I feel like I'm not supposed to talk to women though
Cuz the waitress tonight was really cute, and I kind of wanted to ask her for her number, but I didn't
Also is it bad to ask someone out when they are working
So let's just skip to step 2
But I fucked that up when I was born
I mean I get step 1: be hot
How do you ask people out
things will probably be okay
I am literally wearing a t-shirt right now
which is half a joke and half serious
I'm wearing a T-shirt
No reason for someone to be interested
I bring nothing to the table
nah
No one has been interested in me
Pretty sure I'm beneath most people
You are all the time
can't be a wingman for someone who can't fly to begin with
If she had been interested she would have said something
I shouldn't have asked her in the first place
it wasn't her fault
t some mask thing
this wasn
I knew her for a while before I talked to her
I know her
She was a good person
and she *actually vomited* at the thought
I asked her if she wanted to go to Prom
was in high school
The last girl I "asked out"
and now people are mad I don't take initiative looooooooool
just in general
Not even just a romance thing
"If my input is desired they'll initiate" is what I was taught for 20+ years of my life
i think you're looking for the word "condemn"
the other option was waiting another 6-12 months to apply for JET again and *maybe* get a position there
which is flat-out illegal but hey it's the least illegal of any of the big companies
I'm also contractually forbidden from obtaining a driver's license in Japan
It probably is
I am contractually obligated to represent the company in the best manner at all times in public
Not when my company is the only reason I'm even legally allowed to be in the country
I know
probably not a good idea
considering I can literally lose my job for that
because the real version of me is a flaming shitshow
I'm the socially acceptable version of me
I'm not *me*
even people with similar interests
mold myself to other people
It's how my life has always been
I need to mold myself to them
I *have* to be interested in what my students/clients are interested in
It's my job
unfortunately
I have learned to fake interests and learn about things I don't care about because my own interests are boring
I am not an interesting person
My job is interacting with people
I do interact with people
not for me
or who they want me to be
or they want me for who they *think* I am
and no one wants me
it's the matter of feeling wanted
It's not a matter of feeling complete with or without someone
old enough to have missed the time to learn about how to do things
but things will probably be alone
Because he doesn't understand why it's racist and trying to explain it is useless
but he will use it when discussing it
he doesn't directly *call* people the n-word
It comes to the point where my dad, who will actively say the n-word if no one is around to hear it, has to call her on her bullshit sometimes
My mom asked a black coworker, to his face, if he was going back to africa for a family reunion
"How dark is the neighborhood?"
"We've got streetlights, so it's pretty bright tbh"
>laughter from entire family until I walk out
also laughed out of the room for *not* being racist
I was 21 years old at the time
the one time I even *suggested* that *maybe* America didn't have to be 100% Christian all the time I got deathglares and sent to my room with my phone taken away
I can't say shit without being completely disowned by my family
I'm just waiting for them to die tbh
grandma why
>grandma literally posts "I dont care about Trump being sexist"
Ah, nothing like your relatives being tansphobic on facebook
My dad is a litera; "the Devil put dinosaud bones in the earth to test our faith" kinda person
That's my parents
some creationists say "The world is 6000 years old or less and created everythingas-is"
Some creationists say "God created the world and then let evolution do it's thing"
Young Earth Creationist
take that as you will for how bad an idea coming out as atheist is
like
so
My parenst are YECs
OT God is basically a homophobic shithead
New Testament as a whole is *mostly* pretty ok
Jesus is pretty chill
I haven't so much as looked at a bible since I left the US almost 15 months ago
hahaha no
as well as 90% of my US-based support network
it would likely result in losing most of the money I have to my name
and that I haven;t been for about five years
I am genuinely afraid of how my family would react if they knew I wasn't Christian
My mom got super pissy about the 9/11 debris that happened to look like a cross being taken down
not for baby boomers
I directly told him at one point not to say it because it was racist and his response was literally "There's no black people here"
god spagetti
probably
at least I'm fucking vaccinated
I think Something started the bgeining but then ignored us and doens;t give a shit because afaik science has yet to explain what happened prior tot he big bang
I have lost interest
This isn't actually Metal Gear is it
Is this actually Metal Gear
what is this
vn
Metal Gear HArem vsn
you *what*
>Metal Gear VNs
I would watch the hell out of a shitty Metal Gear anime
wait did it really
jk Metal Gear is already Metal Gear Anie
Metal Gear Anime?
idk what that us
IT'S BEEN TOO LOOOOOOOOOOONG
BROTHER
>liquid
leather shoes + dress socks
I was h them every day but
They do
the amount of effort required to be savage to me is literally negatibe
literally anything is savage to me
Inmate
IIRC Lucy/Satan is less the King of Hell and more Inamte #1
sorry
this is why I keep <#336297840529899522> muted and usually don't talk here
I thought this was actually Metal Gear
But on the other side of the coin, Japan is like the number one place for absolutely fucking ignoring how I feel
Honestly, Japan is like the number one place I shouldn't be in terms of actually getting treatment for how I feel
The only other I have is that I haven't looked money
I don't have prevented
No my drunk lonely at
Became pricey who actually here problems pay here
This is why I mite those Chevelle
I'm just an alcoholic son of a bitch who isn't as good at anything as he should be
I ain't got problems
Wait NVM I muted this channel for a reason
Why did I even go to college
time to duck out of this channel again
well, questions answered at least
which to me didn't make sense
she still wanted to present as male and not seek any sort of treatment for the dysphoria (did I spell that right) she was experiencing
It wasn't a thing of like money or emotional cost or people disapproving, the part that confused me was she told me even if it was free and guaranteed no backlash etc
she considered herself trans and asked me to use female pronouns but said she had no intentions of presenting as female or seeking any sort of hormone therapy/surgery
I had a trans friend back in the US who didn't want to transition
Okay that little convo in NSFW has me curious about something
forgive me, I usually have this channel muted, so if you've had some major personal developments here I probably don't know them
What?
So I guess I should just forgive and forget and move the fuck on
My mom apparently doesn't even hold her responsible for nearly killing her
Not with my parents lmao
I feel like I probably am
Am I the asshole here?
Yet somehow I'm expected to just play nice and pretend like she's fine and that everything she did in the past just doesn't matter
I personally have no reason to believe she can be anything more than a contrarian, vindictive, annoying person
Granted, I live a few thousand miles away from her at this point, but still
She's made no effort to change, not that I've seen
So I have no reason to believe that she's actually different
PMs not PMS
I've talked to melua about this a little bit in PMS, but I don't believe people can change, because I've never seen it happen personally
*whole
On top of the hole, you know, enabling my mother to try to kill herself
Contrarian for the sake of disagreeing with people throwing fits and tantrums in public, and is generally just being intentionally unpleasant to be around
According to my family, she has learned to be nice in the interim, but every time I've ever spoken to her, she's been utterly terrible human being
And while honestly, I don't really like her, she's my *mom*
She was also directly responsible for my mother's "suicide attempt"
Because I have a cousin who was a fucking bitch her whole life and when it came out my uncle abused her my whole family suddenly expected me to stop disliking her
Is being emotionally and possibly physically abused a free ticket for being an asshole?
It usually does a pretty decent job, but honestly, it can get a bit sketchy
Not going to lie, speech-to-text is questionable at best
LMAO why does it capitalize be and not just say be
I feel like I'm supposed to though, on the basis that most everybody here has been at least baseline polite to me, so I should B aware of what they do and how they feel and what's going on in their lives
I'm seeing reports as high as 33 confirmed dead
I got nothing
Japan does have capital punishment, yes
Which gives an axe to grind but not "murder 33 people" axe to grind
He claims KyoAni plagiarized from him
Might be a combination of both
It's funny to me that you think they would think that
Ha
And tried to retroactively get a kid's diploma revoked after he came out in college
This is the same school that expelled people on the *suspicion* of them being gay or having had sex
And parents were like "Get her the fuck out of here"
Principal was like "Okay so I have to bring this to the board"
One of the students reported her to the principal
Literally one of our bible class teachers got fired for *implying* that maybe Young Earth Creationism wasn't correct
but still
I *did not* attend public school
Granted
we were taught young earth creationism
Biology class in high school
I remember that fondly
It was
bullet train
Hell, there was an *attempted* murder on a shinkansen a couple months ago that was front-page news
Especially if it was a public murder
like, a single murder can be front-page news, and not even just on a slow news day
Yeah, Japan's overall violent crime rate is pretty low
I would consider the largest instance of domestic terrorism in recent history would probably be considered an exceptional case
the sarin gas attacks killed 12 people
in fact it's actually bigger
this is the largest mass-killing in Japan since the 90s
But yeah, millhi brings up a good point
My mom's the type of person who gets mad at Captain Marvel for being a woman because "Women can't be superheroes!"
my parents do that Aya
as are all geological evidences that the earth is older than 6000ish years
My parents legitimately believe that dinosaur bones are some sort of "test of faith" put in the earth by satan
It's pretty amazing what a private school can do in the US
They likely didn't lose *everything* they did as a company, but I'm guessing an untold amount of originals, masters, and archive-quality stuff is gone
From the way it's worded it sounds like any digital or physical media or archive content for their series', at least that were housed at that building, have been completely lost
I *think* I read somewhere that places where it's legal tend to have lower rates of human trafficking but I don't know if that's actually true
Legalizing and regulating prostitution severely reduces cases of illegal prostitution and leads to dramatically lower STD rates among prostitutes
It really does
and the fire he started killed less than half as many people
Some Osaka arsonist has been in solitary since 2008 awaiting his hanging
They might just let him rot for 20+ years in solitary before they actually kill him
This guy is 100% going to get the death penalty
It's how they had Ghosn in police custody for like five weeks before his lawyers got to see him
and you have another three weeks in jail
and then when the three weeks are up they can arrest you for murder
They can arrest you for drunk driving
So say you drive drunk and hit someone with your car and kill them
Also they can chain charges to keep arresting you and keep holding you without a lawyer
so the actual trial is more of a sentencing hearing than anything
and the court system has like a 99.4% conviction rate or something like that
While you can't be convicted based solely on a confession, a confession gives police the right to basically do whatever they want to your shit and use circumstantial evidence as *actual* evidence
Get arrested and you can be held for up to 3 weeks without a lawyer
Japanese criminal justice system is kinda fucked tbh
So
Prisoners are also intentionally disoriented to keep them from keeping track of time
You essentially get locked in solitary with no contact with the outside world for however long they feel like then one day they come and get you and you get about an hour's notice that you're going to die and then you get hanged
People that want him to rot forever *and* people that want him to die are both going to be satisfied
From my understanding of Japanese death row
I saw one place mention suspected schizophrenia but I don't think that was a particularly reliable source
The guy they have in custody has claimed they "stole a novel" from him
Depending on how much was lost, likely somewhere between KyoAni closing it's doors and all of their planned and in-progress series delayed indefinitely
One of my students was absent today and I'm like 90% sure it's because he went to Kyoto to do something about this
I'm gonna be honest, I know very little about Japanese politics, so I'm not exactly an authority on the subject but I'd assume it's a nice gesture that will ultimately be a foot in the door more than actually directly accomplishing anything
cosmopolitan: "Including people from many different countries or cultures"
in the US you can find people from all over just about anywhere
Like, outside of two major cities, Japan is *overwhelmingly* Japanese
I was originally going to say New York but the cosmopolitan nature of NY fits the US more than the cosmopolitan nature of Tokyo fits Japan
Yeah
It's about as representative of Japan as a country as Vegas is of the US
but despite nearly 1/4 of Japan's population living in Tokyo and the surrounding areas, it's not *Japan*
Like, Tokyo is in Japan, yes
and there's being gay in Japan
Like, there's being gay in Tokyo and Osaka
And he can't visit any of them, because if he gets seen going to any of them, he loses his job
And according to my boss he can count on one hand the number of places that are meant for the LGBT community
Like, I live in Hiroshima, which isn't a small city
And the idea of "gay culture" in the sense of bars or places meant specifically/primarily for the LGBT community is almost entirely exclusive to Osaka and Tokyo
he's also commented before how it took 20 plus years for his parents to become comfortable with the fact that he wasn't going to get married, and that he will never ever be able to tell them he's gay, or about the man he's choosing to spend his life with
So while you're not going to get killed, like you would in certain places, I wouldn't exactly call it "good" in an absolute sense, just in a relative one, because it's so bad in other places
Gay people can't get married in Japan, and are thus ineligible for a bunch of tax breaks and other benefits, and cannot adopt children (though tbf adoption laws in Japan are also kind of a giant clusterfuck), and my boss has commented before that he would likely be forced to resign from his position if the rest of the staff found out he was gay, since he works with children, and that's "not okay"
While it's perfectly legal, and you won't be jailed or forced to "conversion therapy" or anything like that, there's still an enormous social stigma around it
I'm not gay myself, but my boss is, as was one of my former coworkers
I know the conversation is kind of over but I just wanted to give my 2¢ real quick about being gay in Japan
Not to shit on big cities, but more going to the point that while they are everyone's first image of Japan and they *do* carry like 40% of the country's population, the what is or is not culturally accepted in the mega-cities is not representative of Japan as a whole
While it's not a colossal mega-city like Tokyo and Osaka, it's such a massive tourist destination that even in the less popular areas it doesn't have the same atmosphere as say, where I live, in suburban Hiroshima
Even Kyoto falls into this to a certain extent
Or when you do, they're blanket "Not Japanese" rather than "Italian" or "Brazilian*
but you won't find little bubbles of international culture like you do in the US
You find the odd tourist or foreigner who got married and went back to their spouse's hometown
in Japan they pretty much *don't*
But they *exist*
In Japan that's not really the case
Exactly
his die-hard loyalists are the ones that hate anything other than a cishet white christian US
and people support him *because* he's hateful
because goddammit he tells it like it is!
I can't imagine what their families are going through
That's just... that feels terrible
Jesus Christ, people younger than I am died in the KyoAni attack
<@302063351767498752> actually, due to the nature of our interaction, I never asked directly what said person identified as, just that they used a traditionally-feminine name.  However, in most places on the internet that I see that take it seriously, it seems that either she/her or they/their is preferred for such individuals
Yeah
Not exactly gender fluid, just... different
In Western cultures and pornography it's essentially used as a slur on the same level as "shemale" or "tranny" but a few of the people that I talked to here said it's considered a term of respect in Thailand
But in recent times, it's mostly up to personal preference on an individual basis, from what I've read and to the ones I've talked to
Apparently there's an actual Thai word "Kathoey" that has traditionally been used for intersex individuals
I actually spent a while looking this up, trying to figure out what the most appropriate word to use is
It's someone who was assigned male at birth and has undergone physical alterations to appear more feminine
From my understanding, it's something that doesn't really fit with the Western concept of binary gender? It's a sort of third gender/intersex thing
Yeah
I slept with a ladyboy. And before you freak out, that was the word she asked me to use
I don't know how legit it is, but that whole "five love languages" bullshit thing I scored really high on the "physical contact" part and not so high on everything else
Like
I just want someone to have physical contact with
And based on my experiences over the last couple of days I have come to the conclusion that sex with someone you have an emotional connection with presumably regardless of genitalia is vastly superior to just laying pipe with whatever your preferred loadout is
I mean I'm not exactly planning on going around guzzling cocks lmao
But if I was in bed with someone who had a dick I'd probably suck it
Again, I didn't *dislike* it, but if you put a dick and a vagina in front of me I'd choose the vagina
I know lol
I didn't dslike it but I think pussy tastes better
Pretty sure that's a wee bit different from porkin a girl in the butt
I mean I sucked a dick tho
I'd think no
Haven't tried it
IDK
Straight but not heterosexual
What does that make me
I like pussy and I don't mind dick if it's attached to a girl but I don't think I'd actually go to bed with a *guy*
I know I'm not gay but idk if bi is the right term
Hey so like
Pre-Eclipse Casca was pretty good iirc, though it's been a very long time since I've read that part of Berserk
What
Uh
Actual strong female leads from Japanese media:
Makoto Kusanagi (at least in the movie, I haven't watched SAC), most Ghibli protags, probably the girl from Black Lagoon
Not that, necessarily, all female leads in Japanese media are strong female leads, just that there's a lot more female leads
If we're talking Japanese media it's less of an issue imo, at least in terms of balancing the number of male vs female leads
I was talking mostly about Western media
Ripley and Sarah Connor, good
Captain Marvel I guess since Marvel is pushing her now
Uh... She-Ra?
We have Wonder Woman
What even main big female heroes do we have
Then again I'm also used to using the term "SJW" as a synonym for the extreme left/TERF level shit so maybe that's just me
My 2¢ but I read that as them commenting on my shitty "first feminist"
I mean, what is it, aren't there "only 6 stories" or something like that
"I've seen it done before therefore it's not good" is just as faulty as "This is new, therefore it's good"
Being original also does not necessarily mean media will be good, either
I think what I was rather trying to say was "Being original is not a prerequisite for being good"
You're fixing
I'm trying
Thanks Mel
Yeah, the climax shits the bed a little bit but even then it's not terrible
But honestly, the first two acts of the movie are pretty well done
Yeah, it's a superhero origin story for a character introduced in the 40s
Being original and being good aren't mutually exclusive
And I know you're not the kind of person to do that, which is why I was confused
And I'd never seen that really justified because that kind of statement comes from the kind of person who just screams down their opposition instead of actually having an argument
Because I *have* seen the argument before that having a genital preference is trans/homphobic, using language similar to what you said
I thought you were referring to any/every given individual, not the whole group
Okay, I misunderstood
Which is where my confusion is coming in
Which sounds an awful lot like "There is never a valid reason not to date a trans person"
According to Saki maybe, but Mel flat out said "garbage by a different kind of name" in regards to the idea that there might be a reason other than transphobia to not date a trans person
Maybe that makes me homophobic too, idk
Like, I feel like I'm misunderstanding what someone said, because that sounds to me a lot like "If you're a straight man and you refuse to date another man you're homophobic" which sounds patently ridiculous
Refusing to date someone because of your genital preference is transphobic?
I can't think of any way to phrase this question without sounding like a massive transphobe, so I guess I'll just say it, because I have the question, and I'm looking for an answer to it
But y'ain't missing much
Which idk if you've seen the Japan-exclusive models
So it's mostly going to be stuff like accessories or models that are only available in Japan
So very few Japanese cars are actually imported
That sounds really bad at first, but then you realize most Japanese auto manufacturers have major factories in the United States
6000 is the number I grew up with <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
In the US at least I'm pretty sure motorcycle licenses and car licenses are separate
Rule #1 of driving: Assume every other driver is, at best, an absolute moron, and, at worst, actively trying to kill you
but you should have to retest with some reasonable frequency
Taking the test shouldn't be expensive
Just slap labels on them
I like Japan's method
That's a good thing imo
which means I got like 15+ hours of solo night driving without a license
almost all of that experience as a solo driver
which was weird because I got like
NH (where I got mine) like I sad required like 40+ hours of practical experience before you could even take the test
I think laws vary by state
Driver's Ed was a 2 month course for me IIRC but I needed something like 40 hours of behind-the-wheel experience, 15 of which had to be at night
I mean look at movies into the 90s with people smoking on planes
Before that time, regulations and restrictions and security were a lot more lax
that's sad
But yeah, you are right about that
"I guess" the ever-present response of the "I'm wrong but I don't want to admit it"
Overestimating would be thinking it's more/bigger than it is, so thinking the response time is longer than it is
which makes it kinda backwards from the usual measurement
It's just weird because we're talking about response times
would be underestimating
Thinking it's less than it is
or... underestimating? I guess?
You are overestimating Air Force response times significantly
so many names
There's just
Not to mention the raw scale of it
I think one of the most powerful things on the memorial in NYC is the list of "[NAME] (Unborn)"
Our class took a trip to NY at one point and we found his mom's name on the memorial
One of my friends in HS lost his mom in the 9/11 attacks
Spoilered content is footage from 9/11 ||https://i.imgur.com/kH4nxiw.mp4|| I've never seen this particular shot before, god damn
I've had particularly baggy cargo shorts trigger it
but you're supposed to leave your hat and glasses on
They tell you to take belts off now
"Look, guys, there's metal in my hat, it's gonna set it off."
"Sir, please leave your hat on."
"It's gonna-"
"Sir."
"Fine."
>go through scanner
"Sir I need to examine your hat."
which are super annoying
That was before the big full-body scanners were a thing though
to make sure there's nothing on your body
They take you aside and kinda just touch your arms and legs and torso
Yeah
Instead of removing it and putting it in the bin by itself
I got a pat-down once for forgetting a *camera* in my backpack
All electronics always removed from luggage
I have instead been moved to a shorter line
I have never once *skipped* security
I usually get pre-check with domestic US flights as well and can vouch the same
I had *substantially* stricter checks going into my fucking layover airport in Taiwan than I did actually re-entering Japan from thailand
Like yeah they still check it and make sure you're good but it's basically a formality
Like there's a special line where they basically say "Oh yeah go ahead we don't care" for flashing a US passport with a valid work visa
I get basically whisked through customs for having a work visa here
Yeah the TSA is useless
and enough options to pry open a cockpit door if I had really felt like it and not gone "Oh shit, I'm not supposed to have this, I'm just going to pretend I don't"
A multitool with a fairly long folding blade
though in my defense that wasn't intentional
that being said I made it onto a plane with a leatherman in my carry-on at one point
child*
Hell I remember bringing full water bottles onto planes when I was a chile
I can't wear hats at work, but I typically wear a hat on the weekend
There's shit about covering/not covering your head in the bible
I assume it's a religious thing
and every fucking time I got a new game with a femPC "So have you figured it out yet?"
At least as far as gender goes
And also the fact that I told her multiple times over the course of multiple years that I am plenty happy with what I am
Happened like four times from the same person
"I'm just gonna pick the femPC because-" "You're an egg!"
I got a bunch of shit from people in college for it so it gets me really annoyed real quick
My parents bitch about this stuff all the time
she was convinced that *everyone* would be trans if they just knew about it
despite not being so herself
She actively wanted everyone to be trans
hence why my work still receives multiple faxes a day
but it breeds a society of "If it ain't broke, don't fix it"
Japan has very strong ties to the past, which on the one hand is nice, it preserves a pretty unique, ancient culture
It's just how things are
that people commit suicide by jumping in front of trains
It's just a casual thing
Yeah
"Does that mean..."
"Hahaha, oh yeah, that means somebody killed themselves. That happens here."
My boss laughed at me the first day when I saw that on the bullet train and asked
"The train between Station X and Station Y is suspended due to human damage accident"
High enough that suicide rates have canned messages on the trains
By far IIRC
Young people are too busy to have kids
it was "Oh nice, twice as many people to work to death!"
The response was not "Oh nice, twice as many people, half as many hours!"
And when people said "Hey why not women in the workplace?"
Lots of very old people
It's a plot point IRL in Japan
Import babies
But the world, on the whole, does not
Japan does
my parents think homophobia isn't real because "you can't be afraid of something that doesn't exist"
Fucking morons
"Gays? You mean those dumbasses *choosing* to fuck ass instead of pussy?"
Not when you're a conservative
It isn't!
It means being forced to acknowledge that an "alternative lifestyle" exists
"Can you believe they added gender-neutral bathrooms to our office?" my dad asks, complaining about the *single-occupancy, locking rooms for one person to use at a time*
I mean I'm pretty sure I accidentally joined a cult on my lunch break a few months back
If you can get two weeks then Tokyo-Kyoto-Hiroshima/Sapporo is a good trio of places to visit
If you want the best food the country can offer, Sapporo
If you want culture and sightseeing, Kyoto and Hiroshima
If you want shopping and entertainment, Tokyo and Osaka
Depends on what you want
Fuck off mom no I don't and even if I get one I'm probably not having kids
My mom always asks me if I have a girlfriend yet
Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka are very English friendly
Their our know rules!
*fuck* it's good
I had okonomiyaki at lunch today
every day
It really is a gorgeous place
the actual definition of a weeaboo
in Matsue you'd be actively hindering your life by not owning a car
in Hiroshima it's useful, but not necessary
In Tokyo it's basically just showing off
If you live in a smaller, country place, it's still pretty helpful
If you live in a city, it's pretty much not
$10k gets you a suzuki shitbox
an RX-7 is more like $30k or $40k
An RX-7 doesn't cost $10k
and doing like $15k worth of mods to themn
of buying $10k cars
bizarre mentality
Also this
They don't buy stuff because they have no time to use stuff they buy
They just work to have a big number in their bank account
the Japanese economy is struggling because no one fucking buys anything
People work a lot to *have money*
It is a problem though
Galaxy brain strats
One thing that gets me up in the morning
There is one thing
But!
the idea of just "not waking up" one day is an almost literal dream come true
I want to die but I don't want to kill myself
same
the alternative
well
the idea of just simply dying is so much easier than
I kinda hope that happens sometimes
No chances for regrets, no eternal mulling overmistakes
the idea of simply being gone is oddly comforting
at the same time
I like to imagine there's *something* after death, but I haven't even the vaguest guess as to what it is
he has to wear long-sleeved shirts to work because of it
My (English) coworker has an Aperture Science tattoo on his inner arm
on the designated day dude ended up at a Yakuza member's birthday party
Some drunk guy was like "Hey you should come to my birthday party! It's at XXX on XXX"
Apparently that happened to one of my company's employees at one point
I haven't seen the guy since so I'm assuming they fucked off
At least they advertise themselves and make it easy to manage who they are so I can easily block them
Fucking dumbfucks in random gamefaqs threads that just open with transphobic comments tangentially related *at best* to the topic at hand
it is
I've gathered that
yeah
Not necessarily trans-friendly so much as less-transphobic I guess
I mean yeah fetishy but like
or gifs
Looking more for pictures
it's really slow and the content isn't as quality as the bigger, but more transphobic, subreddits
I know there's r/safe4trans but like
On a related note, is there a more trans-friendly subreddit than r/you-know-what
"reasons to live" is "There are things I want to do"
"reasons to not die" is more like "This would make other people sad"
Its way more depressing imo
I often find myself less with "reasons to live" and more "reasons to not die"
My death would inconvenience people I care about
She wouldn't want me to
Don't give up on living
Normal Person + Anonymity + Audience = Total Fuckwad

So I kinda get it
I got a friend request from someone on Discord at one point whose conversation opener was "lmao the girl in your pfp is dead"
So delays, affected stations and lines, and reasons are usually posted on the JR website within a few minutes of the incident
If there's a delay, especially on the main line in a major city, potentially hundreds of people will be late for work
In Japan, on the average day, you could set your watch by the trains
Also re: reasons
It could also have been a genuine accident, but...
That's the "We don't want to say what it actually was" phrase
It was probably a suicide
Less "announce" and more "make available"
Train delays due to "human damage accident"
Ah, lovely start to the morning
Essentially, yes
and it's just *not* news
That a 20-something-year-old can publicly commit suicide
How fucked is that though
Woman in her 20s walked off the platform in front of an approaching train at 6:49AM
There was no major news about it
suicides are kinda hushed up
They didn't announce it, but actual accidents are front-page news
The train delay yesterday
It was a suicide
For how small the western gear fan base is, it's surprisingly fractured
What's the DWP?
What is that paper for?
I'm so confused
I cashed out ages ago too
that made Unusuals not so unusual anymore
didn't Valve crash the economy a few weeks ago with a glitchy update
who's a complete ass, but doesn't actually break any rules
Every server has to have at least one active twat
It's an unwritten rule
Hell doesn't Overwatch have like, specifically Chinese servers
Hearthstone, Diablo, and tbh probably Overwatch
if not the majority of their entire income
I'm not gonna make any claims I don't know for sure but I'd be willing to bet the single largest financial country for them is China
It's Blizzard
What do you expect
At least FFXIV was
MMOs that are both buy-to-play and sub-based
he paid like $300+ worth of items for it
a hat of some sort
I had a friend who had a sub-100 crafted something
The low-numbered crafted cosmetics went for insane amounts
That too
Yeah
But anything that actually affected gameplay could be obtained simply by playing the game
A special one maybe
Yeah
You could get the dead ringer without boxes
Anything that affected gameplay could be found naturally
Yeah, but the boxes were also purely cosmetic
I know people that made net profits in the multiple thousands
$250 or so?
didn't make a huge profit like some but made a net profit of like
They'll respond with some bullshit faux-pology and then wipe their crocodile tears with stacks of Chinese cash on their way to the bank
Fizzy's question
I feel like that's arguably worse
First Blood is a thriller that focuses on exploring PTSD and how veterans were treated post-Vietnam, and IIRC has only a single death in it
Saving Private Ryan is far, far more violent than the first Rambo
First Blood Part II is the movie you think it is
Tangent, but the first one is not the movie you think it is
it's not srs discussion though so I'll post about it in general
Oh that reminds me of a story I read in one of my kids classes
what?
uh
but yeah
so that's nice
Japan actually just elected it's first openly-gay... I think ward mayor? in Tokyo
~~also because getting pregnant is still basically a career-ender for women here~~
No one wants kids when everyone's too busy/tired to fuck
Work everyone to death
Japan's got it down pat
that said yeah, betting on who would do it is just outright kids being shits
so just make jokes
it's less that they actively want it to happen and more it's become such a distinct possibility that ignoring it just doesn't make any sense, but no one wants to actually *talk* about it
which is definitely something I remember doing a *lot* in high school
Sounds to me more like gallows humor
that is typically how it's phrased, yeah
That's fair
Yeah
The people who consume lolicon/shotacon hentai and the people who consume actual child pornography are, by and large, two different groups of people
But it's also not solving any sort of issue
It's not
But saying it's the same as, or should be legally treated the same as, actual child pornography, is severely cheapening how disgusting CP actually is
Which, don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of loli either
just "lesser" child pornography, somehow
That's still equating lolicon with actual child pornography
so it's probably just gonna stay censored
and while no one *actually* thinks it's a necessary thing to censor porn, being "That guy who wanted to uncensor porn" would be political suicide
I'd need to do more research into it but apparently the porn censorship thing is a result of post-WWII American political meddling
I do feel bad about that in Japan
That's a bit more grammatically correct
Child Sexually Exploitative Materials/Media?
I do too
That is, sadly, what CP is intended to do
But the definition of "Pornography" is, according to the OED, "printed or visual material containing the explicit description or display of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate sexual excitement."
Child Sexually Explicit Materials
I bet
Sexually Explicit Material
also by definition, it *is* pornography
Child Sexual something something probably
That's fair
You'd just lose the entire legitimate western anime market
That's the other thing, it'd be all but unenforcable
Yeah
As well as huge swaths of anime whose greatest sins are a little bit of fanservice
I mean if they go "Minor is anyone under 18" something like Symphogear could easily get banned
I do know a number of people who are so hyperbolic that any anime is "loli pedo shit" so yeah, those people do exist
Ah, it's *that* server
No program can auto-detect images on that scale that quickly
No loophole made it allowed, Discord doesn't auto-block it or anything like that
as Discord is an international service provider which operates in countries that have very strict laws regarding the depiction of sexualized minors, regardless of whether they're real or not
Lolicon is banned by Discord's TOS
I do
I get where you're coming from
But if it's not going to solve or even help the issue - which is why it's being pushed - then why bother pushing it?
||or content wherein one or more female characters actively fetishizes their partner||
The porn I consume is usually solo female or like, vanilla doujin stuff that focuses on mutual pleasure
I mean, same
That was the implication, yes
Men watching porn = good
Men using sex toys = perv
Women watching porn = perv
Women using sex toys = good
Which is a really amusing irony
It's also more culturally appropriate, at least in the west, for (straight) men to consume porn
You can have porn that doesn't
Yeah
It makes them bitter and impossible to talk to
It doesn't
My mom will turn off music that mentions sex, much less TV or movies
I sincerely doubt my parents have done anything sexual since I was born, and probably the only times before that were going for my conception
You're very lucky
Because they hate sex *that* much
I would legit be convinced I was adopted if I didn't look so much like my parents
much less porn
who barely acknowledge that the concept of sex even exists
My parents are also neo-puritanical fuckwits
it's there to bring in the views because it's "cinema" so it's "okay" to see it
The nudity is as fanservice as it can get in GoT
Nudity in GoT and porn are kinda two different things
PornHub's "Porn for women" section is actually kinda nice
Is it  though, if it's intended to be shared and viewed?
You can find it
and not in a fun way
Most porn is maledom
tbf it does
||I was also like, 14 at the time||
Spoilered for explicit content: ||It was called "Lesbians, Leather, Latex, and Oil, oh my!" on YouPorn, and I skipped the cunnilingus parts because I thought they were gross lmao, I just liked the shiny skin and titty licking and girls doing the kissing thing||
I remember the first actual porn video I ever intentionally searched out and watched
Amusingly enough
My parents hate porn, my school hated porn, some of my friends still hate porn to this day
Because porn = sex = sin = bad
*might* have been drunk
Maybe
I don't think so
u cute
oh shit
turns out I don't know what the lesbian flag looks like rip
I'm so used to seeing the Trans flag I saw that and assumed that's what you were talking about
lmao
Oh
I don't recognize tho-
I mean, I could say the same about the implied "porn for men" that the rest of it is
and I don't get to talk about it often
I find what other people like and think about to be interesting
talking about porn is fun
anyways
Meanwhile Jonny Sins and Asa Akira over here are just fucking because they have the most famous genitals on the planet
There's at least a *little* background to it, some establishment of character
That's why doujins are nice
or at least the inverse of it
I think that's the point solo was trying to make
And it's something you and I simply don't see eye to eye on
We've discussed this before, Mel
I live in this weird state where I know I'm an asshole but I still get the good feelings from doing it
It makes me feel like I have some modicum of power or control
I wish I didn't, but I do
I get it
so I usually get fucked on things that are normally 3-day weekends
which I already get off
usually national holidays are moved to Mondays
super rare in Japan
Tuesday is a national holiday
I might finally finish Astral Chain
I would make a snappy quip but honestly I'm gonna go to bed sad and lonely like usual and wake up the same way, then go to work and have a nice day, hang out with my coworker afterwards, and then come home to a 3-day weekend
Don't have too much fun without me
I really should be going to bed
fascinating and fun as this conversation is
anywasy
ready to bedevil that butt
here comes mel
speaking of the devil
Oh
Because people are narrow-minded and can't accept that the world is different from what it was when they grew up
speak of the devil
lol
Congrats, Kerrik!
it was called mustard gas
Yeah they made a bomb that makes you go blind
Most common forms of photo ID are issued by the state, rather than the national government
They're not common but they exist
as an aside, there are non-driving state photo IDs in most places in the US that you can get for pretty cheap
US passports are 10 years too I think
oh shit they're super expensive in the US too, nvm
wtf
or limiting their availability in other ways
By not providing enough voting machines to certain areas
Which is how a lot of people rig ballots
Yeah in the US there's a lot of on-location voting
B) all the time, but I don't post them in <#336297840529899522>
A) that's not Saki
I think there are other chemical agents that specifically cause blindness
it was made illegal
The only country that has necessitated the creation of a new word to describe it, as far as I'm aware
No, it doesn't, I don't think
Though that *does* include unemployment
and something like 70% of said suicides are attributed to work-related factors
One of the highest suicide rates in a "developed" country
but drivers licenses and other such things are issued at a state level
the big exception being passports
I think the question is less "what work are they doing that's resulting in that" and more "how in the hell are poll staff being worked in that manner"
It's absolutely not lol
Yeah
Bethesda-*published* games might be good
Bethesda-*developed* games all suck
but EA is worse for the industry
Bethesda is a shitty company that rides on brand recognition, to be sure
EA releases bad games and expects the players to keep giving them more money so EA *maybe* can fix it at *some point*
Bethesda releases bad games and expects the players to fix them on their own
the main reason the Kardashians are famous
He's also like
Like there's a big difference between the general "I'm awesome and everyone should like me" that many superstars have and Kanye West
it's like "I was put on this earth as a blessing to music and you peons are lucky I deign to share my masterful creations with you and enlighten your world by doing so"
It's not an "I'm so great, I'm the best" thing
like
this is
No, no
So far up his own ass you can see his fingers behind his teeth
tl;dr he's a narcissist with a god complex
and that was much more peoples' problem from what I read
afaik at least
EA had the reigns on microtransactions and what content was base and what was DLC though
It's really bad but it absolutely the fuck is not
Is this the same shitty server you have stress-related breakdowns over like once a week
Doesn't make it any less against the ToS
Lolicon is banned by Discord's general ToS, regardless of a server's individual rules
It's the Nazi armband and his phone straight up had the Nazi flag on it
Yeah there's no room for questioning
Japan, especially WWII-era ultranationalist Japan, would have had no problem killing Germans because they were German
"because lolrussia"
"which it won't"
"we'll deal with that when it gets here"
Yeah and Japan probably didn't really care
Japan doesn't really have a cultural problem with racism
They just kinda don't care
Japan knows
I mean I'd rather not lose my Visa for assault
It's not a separate thing he's wearing
It's a part of the design of the hoodie, too
Yeah
His phone case has a swastika on it too
I have several questions
And maybe take a close look at the things that are being discussed in question before leaping to the defense of the *Nazi swastika*
I'm not saying it's bad, I'm saying that dude was a fucking Nazi
We're saying in this case, with all the other evidence with it, there's no room for argument
I've seen it as the actual Temple symbol several times on maps in Japan
No one is saying it's not a symbol of good luck
Also, Sub
And the German flag on the skull
The combination of bad grammar and borderline nonsense phrasing makes it hard to interpret *exactly* what it means, but it's pretty clearly some degree of "Fuck you, I play by my own rules"
But with the German flag (and the *literal Nazi armband*)
On its own, no, you're right
It is
With a *German flag*
That is not a coincidence
The swastika *with the German flag*
Again, not just the swastika
Is "mulatto" a racist word? I learned it from Archer and I honestly don't know
Or, it absolutely does
in the same way, people try to justify enjoying Goblin Slayer by saying "I like the action!" or shit like that while simultaneously consuming and promoting the absolute worst the anime industry has to offer in regards to rape and fanservice
People that like Dr. Ver are the people that want to overlook how heinous and irredeemable he is to justify being entertained by his hijinks
Goblin Slayer is the equivalent of Dr. Ver to a wider spectrum of anime
Because that's why they're there
It's enough to judge the readers and viewers, Mel
I liked you, too
It really is
That's a goddamn shame, Aria
I like *parts of it*
the less I like how they got where they went
the less I like the end results
the less I like the story
But the more I think about it
Characters, music
I like parts of it
I'm not sure how much I actually like Gear
recently
Honestly
and damn near dropped Gear in GX *and* AXZ because of him
I despise every frame and second Ver is on-screen
It's the most baseline bullshit "how to make an enemy irredeemably evil"
the rape is a *core central aspect* of GS
The problem is
The themes of the show are "BuT hE kIlLs ThE rApIsTs"
Then they wouldn't be fans of GS
I've honestly judged you for a while and I guess this just solidifies the hunch I've had
I Will
Got it
So you're saying rape as fanservice is acceptable
Which makes it even more deplorable
You are defendinf something that, by your own admission, you haven't even *read*
You are, though
It makes me think less of you as a person to know you would defend this, Anand
You are a terrible person if you like GS
So yes
You are liking, supporting, and promoting content that promotes rape as fanservice as a legitimate selling point
I will not fucking back down from the fact that anyone who likes Goblin Slayer is a terrible person
*and this is the selling point of the manga*
And not just any rape, but violent gangrape to the point of characters literally losing their personality because they have been so thoroughly mentally and physically defiled
"You want to see rape"
"So if you're here"
"And all the fanservice is rape"
"You want to see the fanservice"
It's used as "This is why the audience is here"
The thing is it's not just shock value
So that's shit too
I haven't seen Shield Hero either, but I've heard that it's celebrated that one of the characters gets shipped off to a violent husband and literally raped to death
and that is *every fucking instance* with the Goblins
"because look how hot it is to see her sweat and tears dripping down her body as the semen from her rapists covers her"
"To see this person beaten, bloodied, and violated into submission"
but to the *audience* it is presented as "This is why you're here"
Narratively, it is presented as evil
Like, it is drawn in an inexcusbaly pornographic manner
The manga is borderline pornography
No, but it *highly* sexualizes it
The big difference though
Symphogear is a show that idolizes abusers
And shame on me for *taking issue with people who choose to support it regardless of using sexualized rape as a key audience hook*
woe is me for getting caught up on one of the *major selling points*
I'm "hyperfocusing" on one of the *main themes* and primary purposes of the show, yes
but look where we are
I wouldn't have thought "If you like this show that promotes and sexualizes rape, you're a bad person" would have been a controversial view here
and you know it
But saying "I can turn a blind eye to this an be morally scot-free" is bullshit
and I am aware I am a *wild* hypocrite in that regard with my Samsung
That's like buying an iphone and saying "I'm not obligated to be aware of the literal slave labor used to produce my phone"
I think there is, in fact, a moral obligation to be aware of what you are supporting
It's obviously where I belong
Maybe I should just go back to the 4chan server
and supporting the anime is supporting the manga
in the manga it is a repeated, prolonged issue
Not in the manga
and people defending it crawled out of the woodwork
That is where I came from
Why, because I decided to express my disgust at a show that sexualizes rape and uses it as fanservice as a selling point?
because it shows who is a cunt, who is willing to defend cunts, and who is willing to support cunts
Conversations like this are actually really great for this
The block feature exists for people who are being cunts
get fucked Aria
what a fucking joke
DID THEY TRY TO SUGGEST THERE'S EYE-FOR-AN-EYE FOR RAPE
LMFAO
It only got worse
I read the manga past the point of the anime
Then there would have been a worse one later on, Cocoa
because of what the creator was selling
And they styaed
They came because of what the creator was selling
I am generalizing them because they deserve it
You don't have to claim it's amazing to like or defend it when it's indefensible, Mel
All in the name of "hey hey isn't it hot that this lady got raped and is mindbroken drooling on the floor of this cavern covered in semen, and she's the lucky one because she *wasn't* taken back to the main horde to be used as breeding stock???"
Ignore the issues because "they're weak" except it's not a small issue at all
On top of all the other issues it has
The show violates its own internal logic from chapter fucking one
That is exactly it, Raiden
*because that's a shitty audience hook appealing to the absolute lowest common denominator of anime/manga fans*
*and don't have to resort to rape as fanservice as an audience hook*
My point being that there are shows that *do that better*
on top of how badly it displays rape and its results
The entire internal logic of the series falls apart within the first dozen chapters
*counter to this*
A) Goblins are stated and shown to travel in large groups
B) Goblins are shown to have leaders who can organize their armies and use tactics
C) Goblins are stated and shown to regularly wipe out low-level adventurer parties
D) Goblins are stated and shown to regularly wipe out border villages
Goblins are presented as a minor threat in the show, because individually they are weak and easy to kill, and have minimal intelligence on their own
and as I mentioned before before (not a typo, typed it twice), the show's own internal logic is wildly inconsistent with what it presents
as I stated before, using rape as drama is a cheap way to make a villain utterly irredeemable
as if that somehow justifies the rape that built up to that point
GS yes, promotes killing the rapists
of *enjoying* the rape
You are also minimizing the issue of liking rape as fanservice
It's choosing to minimize the issue as if it's not a big deal
"At most" is minimizing language
I really, really didn't expect "even if they enjoy rape as fanservice it doesn't make them a trash person" either
I really didn't expect that from a mod
wow
"At most"
It reads like a rape doujin
It is highly, highly sexualized, and extremely "fanservicey"
It's utterly inexcusable
Like
but the first chapters of the manga are straight out of a goblin gang-rape hentai
Maybe the show didn't protray it as horribly
Can you not see how people getting into a show because of the "rape as fanservice" audience hook is something to take issue with?
or at least how it chose to handle it as it's audience hook
because that's how the show handled it
it was *so horribly mishandled* that liking it is supporting the positive, sexual view of rape
How they show it and how they handle it is the *core issue* of the show
that people that like it are either liking it for *very bad reasons* or are choosing to intentionally turn a blind eye to *horrible issues* because "swoosh swoosh stab"
that is exactly my argument
and how horribly offensive and repulsive it is
They enjoy it even with how garbage it is
you are feeding exactly into my argument
Lily
People who choose to blindly defend something they haven't read/watched because "I don't like your attitude in attacking this media"
Or, even worse
I haven't, no
It's fun to see in theaters, but BDs are out in feb so you'll be able to see it then
There's actually one song on it that sounds like it was written for KLK but never got used in the show so Sawano put it into Promare instead
The soundtrack feels *very* KLK
Most of the voice cast returns, Sawano returns for the soundtrack, it's written by Nakashima, and Imaishi is the director
Promare is basically a reunion party of everybody involved in Kill la Kill
really, what would you expect with Hiroyuki Sawano
which like
And yeah, the OST is spectacular
I saw it 3x yeah
lol
just to be that guy
I'll go see it in theaters
I should watch more Lupin
it looks so cool
I'm really excited for the Lupin III movie
I'm not watching anything
LUPAN ZA SAADO
LUPAAAAAAAAAN
LUPAN
LUPAN
LUPAN
that's this friday
that
Oh fuck
Meh
Yes but are the bears *actually killing people*
I actually meant literally... *literally* lol
unless my friend just did a real shit job explaining it to me
the being gay bit is actual bait, like, for prey
No I meant in an actual literal sense
Do the people *actually* get killed
yeah
so it's literal yuri bait
and the bears bait people into getting eaten by being gay
IIRC it's about bears that eat people
I can see why you made that connection
You know, based purely on the title
Lio Fotia nendo is confirmed too
On a related note
I only ordered you the nendos, not a copy of the movie
I mostly just wanted the extra OST but I'm also excited to see the special jacket illustration and the book/pamphlets
The one I'm getting comes with, according to the google-TL'd TR site:
A special jacket for the case
A "miniature pamphlet"
A "SPECIAL BOOK" that includes illustrations and messages from the staff and cast, a "PROMARE Scenario Book" that includes "a complete scenario decision" by the director
The two prequel OVAs
The "Stage Announcement of the movie public memorial special number + extra game"
PV/CM collection
Audio and "Audio benefits" (some sort of commentary?)
And a "Remix and rearrangement" of the OST
The Amazon and Animate posters are pretty badass though
which I honestly care about more than a promo poster
also comes with some enhanced special edition of the OST
It says it comes with some illustration but doesn't specify what...
I preordered from Tower Records
https://i.imgur.com/7ngQZkw.jpg
holy shit was that stop motion
Looks fun though-
ehhhhhhhh a little worried about that
>PTE Director
YESSSSSSSSSS
That one
Yeah
I think it's called Shameless
Shameless?
I forget which one that is though
also I like the elf futa one because it's funny
because *fetish*
I like Touch Fluffy Tail the best
don't think I know the other two
Wear was good too
and I have a friend who adores On The Rocks
Very
just a few songs that I particularly like (or that friends particularly liked)
I'm not overly familiar with Ashcorp
Probably the latter
but I have no idea *where*
I've definitely heard Paralyzed before
okay
had to finish another video I was watching
I'm listening to Hellbent rn
Oh Ken Ashcorp
Magic is really good too
but that's because I *love* the Turntable Turnabout animation
I think my *favorite* is probably Money
I like them all a lot though so I should probably listen to more
I pretty much only know the songs that got animations
Not gonna lie I don't know much Mystery Skulls

I wanted to buy this CD but it's not at my local Tsutaya for some reason so I guess I'm heading downtown to Tower Records on Sunday
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPCLhSseIb8
literally just satan lmao
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGy5uyuYgBg ... I think this is what it was reminding me of, but I'm not sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnXA6T9eOGE Can someone tell me what I recognize the opening of this song from (the first 30 seconds or so)? It sounds *extremely* familiar, I'm pretty sure I've heard it in a video game before but I can't place it
I haven't
I'm just saying a game like DR does not give me any reason to *want* to do thagt
And that's fair
Also UD was more an example of controlling fate than actually caring about the characters
I prefer characters to story most of the time
You care more about story than characters
I mean so is yours
Or rather, at least have a reason to care about the characters
I prefer games where I care about the characters
convoluted*
A solo murder mystery with a more developed and convuluted plot would be more interesting than "Which character that I don't care about has to die now because they killed another character I don't care about"
That sounds really boring to me tbh
It's a boring way to tell the story and I don't feel any attachment to characters that I know exist for no purpose other than to die
but still
Now granted UD probably had several hundred times the budget of Dangan Ronpa
Or you can save them and get a different ending
They can die, and that will change the rest of the story
Making smart decisions and player skill can save the other 6-8 characters
There's only like... two or three characters that *have* to die
To comapre, a game I think does it really well is Until Dawn
which is supremely boring imo and a really bad way to make me care about anyone or anything in a story
It's still just killing people for no reason other than killing people
but scripted deaths that only drive the plot forward are just stupid
Maybe if there was a route where you could *actually save everyone* it might be a little interesting
SAW is one of the dumbest movie franchises ever imagined imo
Phoenix Wright is cool
It's SAW meets Phoenix Wright with teenagers
I just think the concept is dumb as shit
I like the character design in DR a lot
man
Gravity Rush 2
NO KILLING
>mission states that Kat is KOing soldiers, not killing them
>next mission: best way to beat it is flinging soldiers off the edge of your flying boat that is thousands of feet in the air
since I sold my OS chip the first chance I got thinking "There's no way it would actually let me" and got Ending T
Technically it's my second run
Actually
Not making a lot of progress since I don't have a lot of time to play and since I got the PC version I'm fighting with crashes and bugs constantly
First
because I really want the soundtrack because it's so goddamn good but I don't want any spoilers and I don't know if I'll be able to finish the game soon
I want to know if there are any spoilers in the track names
Does anyone here have the NieR: Automata soundtrack?
and the Raven DLC is free too, fuck yeah
Oh hey free costume DLC for Gravity Rush 2
yeah
lol
Horror when done well is pretty good
Not  big fan of slashers
or rather
Not a big fan of horror tbh
I like bad movies
I can get behind that
lol
they took a while to get ported though
And the other PC Senran games work well enough
Sure the PC versions are a couple months behind but they work well enough
Considering Compile Heart/Idea Factory have it down pretty well
Sad
PC version when
I want gatling daidouji so badly
just not as bad as vanilla
I got FAR, it's still buggy and crashy
dunno
I might build a small form factor build while I'm over there but
Moving to Japan, can't take a 60lb full tower with me
No <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Today is the day I delete everything and sell my gaming PC
Today is a sad day
I didn't ask for these feels
It's making me cry what the fuck
which was sung by Minami
so it's playing the music from Wing
and he's playing as the Deathscythe Hell
I'm watching someone play the new Gundam Vs game
nuts
that's a little buts
good night
it was only like 10k coins or whatever the currency is
You need to unlock her but it's really cheap
and was included in the base game on PC
since she was technically a postgame only DLC character in the original version
but only missions you've already completed
Well you can do missions with her whenever in SV
I've heard Estival is a lot better
It's fun but the problem is I mostly want to play Daidouji and you can't exactly progress through the story with her
but I haven't finished it yet
I only have Shinovi Versus
I mean it is, but
Is that too much to ask?
I just want a woman who can break me in half, but chooses not to because she loves me
I voted for Baiken, Daidouji, Ayla, and Kanade
but I don't want to destroy the monster girls D:
I keep getting that in my suggested games
Not Makoto
I meant Bullet
Here's how little I know about bb
Okay
There's some squirrel looking chick in a newer one with explodey arms who looks fun though
And I've only played a little of BB, and an older one at that
I don't know anything about P4A or Uniel
Honestly a 6/10 At best
But it had issues
Grimm Eclipse wasn't bad, I got my money's worth out of it
Waldstein looks rad as hell though
I just want the girls in a *good* game
CTB... not gonna lie I'm pretty much only interested in RWBY
Wanted to play 16 but I am invariably terrible at grapplers
Cell and Vegeta for sure, idk about my third though
I wanna beat people up as Cell and Yang
I'm trying to get decent at Rev 2 and patiently awaiting those two games as well
But anyways it's a stupid argument on both sides
I mean creators intent or not,  a huge number of people treat it like a competitive fighter, and it can absolutely be played as such
I played ASB more seriously than Smash either way
Games can be more than one genre, but the "Smash is (not) a fighting game" argument is stupid as hell since it's treated as one by a pretty large number of people, but it's also wildly non-traditional as far as 2D fighters go
Which both have pretty grievous balance issues
Yeah, almost all my previous fighting game experience was from JJBA ASB and Smash
GG seems very well balanced, which is nice
Yeah
And everyone is at least workable when not at the highest levels of play
From what I've heard pretty much everyone but Potemkin is viable at tournament level
Yeah
At least I don't like Venom or Bedman or something
Ram and Baiken
I mean I also picked like,  two of the worst characters to main for a newbie
And going online *in Asia* is going to lead to some pretty brutal shitstomps most likely
I want a buddy because I really suck, and vs. Com doesn't breed improvement
I used to play on PC but now I don't have a pc
fuck
Xrd Rev 2? Which console?
Does anyone here play Guilty Gear?
Looks like I won't have to give that up entirely while I'm in Japan
Oh shit, Xrd Rev 2 is on sale for $24 on PS4
I forget about that sometimes lol
Fighting games have stories
Oh right
tbh I'd be *really* surprised if we didn't get at least one GG character over the life of CTB
Pretty sure the director said that they didn't want to include GG, but his desire to give the fans what they want would overrule that and he'd put GG characters in if there was enough demand
Sam Gideon in a fighting game would be *awesome*
and my first thought was P*
okay you said Platinum
Neps would be fun
I saw someone online said they voted for neps
Please not SAO
and also Ayla and Daidouji
I said Kanade because reasons
Yeah lol
which would have been fun
There were rumors going around that Senran Kagura was gonna be in CTB too
Fuck it's cold in my apartment wtf
Makoto looks fun too though
I got them blended in my mind
Seen enough memes to know the twists
Nah
With the memes and stuff
Wait is this the thing everyone's been going apeshit over recently
Good night Extika
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slxOllnC7oQ
BAYONETTA FUCKING THREE
fuck I'm really jonesing for a racing game but you know
wait no it was the 2012 Most Wanted that was actually okay
was NFS Rivals the one that was actually okay
Vert x *everything*
I really wanted to use her for those buffs but... damn she was just bad
and even then she usually waited until one person was KO'd to start healing
I literally had to take away every skill Vert had except her heal to get her to use it
otherwise everyone just died
My AI also seemed braindead the entire time so having a healer was *mandatory*
I stopped using Noire as soon as I got my hands on Uni
More just incest
I was dealing close to 20k damage to guard broken enemies with it at the end of the game
elemental shot is a mini-nuke for post guardbreak
way better than elemental shot
One of her later skills just liquefies guard
That *may* have been due to her being 20+ levels higher than everyone else I had though lol
it seemed like she was consistently doing considerably more damage than any other character
and her super special move nukes for a shitload of damage
yyyyyyyyyep
She ended up like 25 levels higher than the rest of the cast when I finished the game
I used Uni too lol
What team are you using?
Yeah, I thought that was clever
the first "half" of the game is more like the first 3/4
the plot and bosses are kinda end-loaded
It's both longer and shorter than I expected lol
cyberdimension is fun
>BBTAG 20 characters at launch, 20 DLC characters confirmed
>10 BB, 4 P4A, 4 UNIEL, 2 RWBY at launch
>Blake and Yang aren't even in the base game
>the B and Y of RWBY aren't in a crossover game featuring RWBY
>only 4 P4A characters
>the creation of P5A was contingent on TAG doing well
Well that went from 100 to 0 *real fuckin' quick*
Lighting's kinda shit but
I'll see if I can dig up a pic of my old setup
ye
made plugging shit in and moving things around soooooo easy
I could stick my whole arm into the front from the drive bays
It was so easy to build in
I loved it
I had a huge tower before
doesn't even have to be mine, I want the feeling of physically assembling a PC
I just want to build a PC
But on the other hand part of me says "Fuck it, XLATX with full custom liquid cooling"
I think building mITX would be really fun
Man I'm so torn
Not with this mining bullshit
Not this time
No
980Ti is still roughly 1070-tier which ain't bad at all
but considering the majority of good GPUs are literally 200%-300% of their MSRPs right now
I plan on doing an mATX or mITX build either way
either way I'll be waiting 4-8 months before I'm seriously looking at a build so *hopefully* there'll be a mining crash and GPUs will drop back to relatively normal prices and maybe RAM won't be quite so fucked
if I do I'll build, if I don't I'll suck it up with my PS4 until October and build again when I get back to the US
so I'm waiting to see if I get a contract extension
if I only stay here one year, I don't want to build a PC and then have to deal with trying to get it home in nine months
it's getting them home
The issue isn't getting things to Japan
I've got the cash I'm just A) not sure how permanent my stay in Japan is and B) not willing to spend 2x what RAM is worth and 3x what a GPU is worth on a fresh build
and makes another Midnight Club
if Rockstar ever stops masturbating over GTA and RDR
You know what might reinvigorate the arcade racer genre though
same
This game is really fucking good
http://store.steampowered.com/app/396900/GRIP/
Also I'm gonna shill the fuck outta that because those devs deserve every penny that they can get
GRIP is so good but development is so slow
Underground Rivals and Most Wanted 5-1-0
the two PSP games were actually pretty good too
Underground 2, MW2005, and Carbon were the best
not that indie games are bad, but they tend to be limited in scope compared to old NFS
And the arcadey section consits of indie games, Mario Kart, and shitty NFS games
The market is oversaturated with "hyper realistic" sims between GT, main Forza, Asetto Corsa, DriveClub, etc
I think it'll come back though
also yeah, it's sad that the arcadey stuff is dying off
depends though
so at that point I probably wouldn't rebuy on PS4
march-ish is about when I'd be building a new PC if GPU prices aren't still fucked to hell
hmm
I *really* wish Forza Horizon was on PS4
always been a fan of the more arcadey stuff
I've never been too big on sims
I wish GRIP would get it's console version already but that's a solid year+ out
I think I own one of them on PC but I never played it
Never played the GRID games
Sadly I can't play it at the moment because no PC and it's a last-gen game
not just racing games, but games in general
Burnout Paradise is one of my favorite games period
It's a good game but not good enough to rebuy on console instead of PC
I've got it on PC
Redout is great but it requires even more effort than WipEout lol
Not implying that WipEout is bad, no, it's just a very different, much less casual sort of racing game than an NFS title
I've got WipEout and that's it
if you know a good racing game I'm all ears
Unfortunately I'm stuck with a PS4 rn
a good one
like
my laptop is for discord and web browsing
some gaming but a lot of just movies and background noise lets plays
I use mine for youtube and plex a lot lol
but it's fun
Oh I'm straight trash at Guilty Gear
but mostly it was because Rev 2 and probably FighterZ will need it for online
and I got discounts on a couple games I bought
I mean I got MGSV and the new Deus Ex game for free so that was neat
That too
and also free games
I only have PS+ because it's needed for Rev 2 online
I pretty much only use my PS4 for single player games
I'm pretty sure my friends list is empty
didn't bother me with my glasses very much
ATH-M30 I think?
they were super comfy too
my "cheap" headphones before my sennies were an audio technica pair
I wear glasses too
I have some bluetooth earbuds that are pretty decent because they have some weird foam on the tips but even those get uncomfortable after about an hour
My ears are weird so I pretty much need actual headphones if I want to comfortably listen for more than 20-30 minutes
open-back + hard to drive
not good "bring them out" headphones
that's the one flaw with my 650s
my 650s are sooooooooo nice
Sennheiser makes super comfy headphones
can I hardware wizardry the hdmi port on my macbook into an HDMI-in
also because what else would I plug my PS4 into
it was in the apartment when I got it
because it was provided for me
wheeeeeeeeeeeee~
the TV in my apartment is 1366x768
Right now I have a macbook and my PS4
if I can't have real speakers I'll at least get some decent fucking headphone audio
That stuff came with me though
I also had a DAC/Amp and sennheiser HD650s
no sub but five speakers
I had 5.0 audio in my room with my PC too

Oh yeah it's pretty bad
R;B 3 also has the best/most refined battle system of the main trilogy, though I hear MD improved on it
also I believe MegaDimension is getting a direct sequel soon, which I think makes it the first spinoff to get a direct sequel?
There's a handful of other spinoffs as well
More recently there was Cybderdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online, which plays like an extremely refined version of AU or MegaTag but has a small playable cast
Then there's Action Unleashed and MegaTagmension Blanc + Neptune vs. Zombies which are both Musou/Warriors knockoffs and, while fun, aren't very good
R;B 2 isn't *bad* but it's the least enjoyable of the main trilogy
MegaDimension is considered the best game overall
R;B 3 has the biggest playable cast
R;B 1 does the best job introducing the characters
Yeah
When she's trying to kill something she goes full sadist for sure, but there's a big difference between trying to kill something and trying to sleep with it
That the enjoyment she gets is from the other party wanting to be dominated and (feigning) resistance
You're gonna have to be more specific. I don't remember that part - the only major one I remember was the one incident with Noire, in which she does firmly establish Noire's consent before the fact, and IIRC Iris Heart actually all but explicitly states at one point that actually raping someone would take all the fun out of it
Not to mention everyone is afraid of her, so of course they act differently when they're trying not to upset her
Also everyone's characters are kinda weird throughout RB3, that's an overall issue with the game (that can even partially be written off as them not technically being the same characters), not specifically an Iris Heart thing
She actually goes pretty far out of her way to confirm consent before she starts, and I only remember her undeniably having sex with one character
Fuckin fight me
Femdom best dom
Plutia is meh but Iris Heart is top tier
I kinda want to learn how to speedrun it
favorite game of all time
Yeah
excluding the final boss because *what* the fuck was that shit
Vanquish is probably the easiest P* game on the whole tbh
to be fair you're probably playing the wrong game
I mean if you're not enjoying the game for being kinda stupid
Pointing out that it's dumb doesn't make it better, especially when the game is taking it's dumbness and running to begin with
and then you've got a character *in the game* going "Guys, this is dumb."
It *is* dumb and tropey to a nonsensical degree
I got the exact opposite feeling
it made her feel out of place
The rest of the game went headlong into ridiculousness and Iffy was pushing against it the whole time
Which I think is what bugged me about her
A large portion of them being companies that provided content for the game?
Did you miss the part where *every character* is a company's self insert?
The other characters all seemed vaguely self-aware, but IF took herself too seriously for the genre
IF is my least favorite lol
It's not good but it's fun
but that was it
I played each game enough to get the True Endings
I got both since you have to get the normal ending first
but R;B 2 has like 11
R;B 1 has... I think only two? Normal and True? and R;B 3 has 3-5
but yeah R;B 2 has way too many endings
idk where manually came from
I mean accidentally
err
which doesn't need any special requirements for the lily rank stuff unless I just got it manually
I just did the main ending, the Good Ending, and the True Ending
Re;Birth 2 has more endings than is good for it
If you just want to beat the game there's usually a couple places where there'll be a boss that's like "aight I wasn't ready for that"
but yeah if you want to max those out you *really* need to grind
I never bothered with the Lily Ranks
It's not *awful*, especially in the remakes, but it's present
also >>>>>>>>>>grinding
The draws are the fun and (putting it nicely) quirky characters and the gameplay that's fun, but basic enough to do other things at the same time
🤷
Naruto was an interesting concept squandered by a writer completely incapable of making the audience give a shit about his characters
Speak for yourselves
I haven't either but I also lack a gaming PC and I'm not buying it again on console
I mean I'd suggest playing Chrono Trigger anyways as it's arguably one of the best games ever made *period*, not just a great beginner's JRPG
Like I did because I insisted on using Ayla for everything and there are some enemies that physical attacks just aren't that great for
if you go slow
20 hours
whereas Chrono Trigger is like
I'm saying they're bad first JRPGs because they're *really* long
Oh I'm not saying they're bad games
Other classics that would be safe to start on would be Grandia II or the original Secret of Mana
I've heard good things about several of the Ys games as well, but again, they tend to be long
particularly 6, 8, and 9, based on my FF-nut friends
Though I haven't played them, from what I hear, another good jumping-in point for JRPGs would be any FF game between 4 and 9
the story is good, the spritework holds up phenomenally well despite being 23 years old this year, the music is some of the best video games have to offer
And to top it off, the presentation is fucking spectacular
If you're doing it right, it requires minimal grinding, too
On top of that, it's not incredibly long like some of the bigger JRPGs are (the Trails Of series, for example, are all stellar games but the first playthrough can push 80+ hours)
<@255412045933969408> It's not quite a standard JRPG (the battle system is fairly unique in that it's not strictly turn-based like many are), but it's one of, if not the best, JRPGs ever made
that would be great
I want a shota voiced by wakamoto
can we just have wakamoto voice every male character ever until he eventually dies
ooooooh my god wakamoto's voice is sooooooo good
because it's super inconsistent with using one or the other here in japan
I just learned both
10:40pm wooooo
wew lad
It's fine for internet browsing and youtube but
I'm stuck on a 4-year-old base-model macbook
I know that feeling
It goes on sale fairly often
redout is good
spiritual successor is more accurate
"remake"
well
modern remake of one of my favorite games when I was little and ooooooooooh it's so good
This game is fucking amazing everyone buy it and give the devs all of your money
http://store.steampowered.com/app/396900/GRIP/
allow me to shill for a moment
on the subject of racing games
also
"We're going back to NFS' roots!" *proceeds to make Fast and Furious: The Game*
horribly
fucked up
and then they tried to bring it back with the 2016 reboot and just
yep
It's the first game that I remember *really* feeling like "I can't believe this is something I paid for"
I'm pretty sure ProStreet was my first real disappointment in video games
I miss old NFS in general
Correction
Well
fuck I miss Carbon
it was amazing
I had a fucking neon green McMerc SLR for like 60% of that game
but why turn better when you can *GOFAST*
it *definitely* did
Oh it did
If I couldn't win a race with GOFAST the solution was to simply GOFAST *more*
I *always* went for the exotics
At least until the Reventon replaced it
I think from MW2005 onward there was the murcielago
Underground Rivals and Most Wanted 510
tbh I'd pay good money for HD remakes of the PSP games
I don't think I could pick one I liked above the rest
Those three are all good imo
I have no desire to do it a third time
I unlocked everything manually twice
I kinda hope it comes with (or comes with the option) to skip the story
That being said
also Paradise Remastered *F U C K Y E S*
RIP one of my favorite series
Most Wanted 2005 and Carbon were the last good NFS games
Burnout Paradise Remastered or DragonBall FighterZ Season Pass (when it's released)?
got a very belated christmas present of a $50 PSN card
I paid $55 for my key early on and I've gotten like 60 hours out of it
Honestly it's well worth the $20 as is
50% off
It was on sale at christmas
wait for the PS4 version to go on sale
don't buy the shitty PC version
which is why I said *wait*
and on more than one occasion *completely broke my graphics drivers*
and on occasion crashing so badly that it took my entire PC with it
It took me over two hours to complete the ten minute intro section because it was crashing so much
Just wait tbh
buy the PC version if you have a gambling addiction
tl;dr: buy the PS4 version if you really want to play it
There's a mod that fixes *most* of the problems but it's still kind of a crapshoot
Constnat crashes regardless of settings or hardware
in-game graphics options don't really do much
Internal res is capped at 900p
It's not
Nier: Automata is half off on PSN right now
Is it even Smash 5 or is it Smash 4 Switch
particularly about 0 and 6
I haven't, but I've heard good things
95% of the internet
I use the same username on like
my PSN is wantfastcars
Otherwise I'd probably be stuck with some dumbass brony name too
I'm just lucky I made my PSN way before MLP was a thing
there is no third option
yes
as a reformed brony myself
and even the best are basically "Well it isn't *bad*"
I've heard mixed reviews on beta gameplay at this point too
RWBY isn't good but I'm along for the ride at this point
"I wanted to cut the game in half and get more money because let's be honest why are you buying a fighting game to only have half the roster"
*bullshit*
grade-A
100%
is complete
and then *only having RW in the base game*
having a game featuring RWBY, to the extent where the big reveal at the end of the *entire game's reveal trailer* was the inclusion of RWBY
Same, but I refuse to support ArcSys for their shitty decisions
Because fuck ArcSys for literally cutting the roster in half for the *express purpose* of rushing it to market to be at EVO
The RWBY characters are all free but I'm still not buying it
Do not support the absolute dogshit business practices ArcSys is putting into that
Please for the love of god do not buy CTB
dire straits
gimme dat fuckin
i will
everyoe sees
alil
drokn

just
I'm fine
tsubasa
basas
rhis
tusbachir
by the red one I mean the blue one
waitfo
the red one
not kirika
i mean
i predict that you liked kidkikr
but I am a sucker for the "I only need to hit you once" strategy in games
I just stuck with Warrior as soon as I got it
I mean a bit, but mostly for class ranks, not levels
I didn't grind *too* much
and didn't even have the best gear in the game
I had like 1500 ATK
was HILARIOUSLY strong
Endgame equipment on Warrior
was satisfying as all hell
walking into the woods and *one-shotting* a chimera
That being said
actually fair enough, Warrior is kind of a mid/lategame class anyways
considering I spent most of the game 1-2 shotting every non-boss enemy
I mean I don't wanna just say "Then you were doing it wrong" but I mean kinda probably
I had a fucking blast playing Warrior
the archers were the classes I didn't like
amusingly enough
everything else is kinda just "okay"
Dragon's Dogma is good because the combat is good
I'd forgotten about that part
that too
IIRC it can even grant bonus EXP if it's high enough
just dropping status effects and boosting crit rates to insane levels
it can be hilariously OP in the main game
Oh yeah the affinity thing they introduced from pokemon amie
half the time
Yellow Heart has massive tits
I don't think she can sing in English like Ayahi can though
as far as the actresses go IIRC Nana can speak a little English
Dark Oblivion has proven that that was a lie
Maria is *supposed* to know English
which is weird given the relationship between 1 and 2
3 was announced a few months ago
Dandy
Fucking
it's great
man GG lore is fuckin' dumb lmao
wait isn't Axel a time-traveler too
Outside of that totally-not-a-concentration-camp place, at least?
I mean Baiken is one of like... is it only two known pure-blooded Japanese people left?
a hundred and twenty years old or some bullshit like that?
what
and is still hot as fuck despite being like
except Baiken because Baiken is too badass to die
I just play the game poorly because I love the way it looks
I know *nothing* about the lore
Simple and easy and maybe a little grindy
Honestly I'd almost pick a Neptunia-style JRPG
yassssssssss
man overall Xrd has really good character designs
Jam a cute
Jam
and a brief attempt to learn Cerebella in Skullgirls
haven't been into them very long
My history with fighting games is Ramlethal in Xrd and Okuyasu and Josuke in All-Star Battle
I got my ass kicked by a vampire loli
It seems fun
I played Melty Blood in an arcade
I'm not good
I try to play Ram
Well
I play Ram
I can't make the motions fast enough or accurately enough to use her counter properly
but I just don't have the mechanical skill to use her yet
Baiken is my favorite visually and personality-wise
I *really goddamn want to*
I'm fucking bad at it but I love it
I'm hype for Xrd
Cutting the roster in half to rush it out the door for EVO and only including the R and W of "RWBY" in a crossover game heavily advertising RWBY and also fucking over UNIEL and Persona fans is stopping me from having anything to do with it
Being bad doesn't stop me lol
man I was really excited for that game
>BBTAG
Slayer's great
Vampire
Ass
I'm just waiting for games I actually want to play to be out for it
I own...
It had noticeable frame-drops on the PS4 pro though
No idea
it was fun but not "play it again" fun
and I probably won't buy Cyberdimension again on PC
The only one I don't have at all is the Sega one
but that one's on PS4
and Cyberdimension
Oh
the Re;Birth trilogy, Action U, B+N vs. Zombies, HyperDevotion, and V-II
uh...
maye
no
runin value
see ll for like $40
crahs the markt
tfw will never get ss'd by kanade
I'm the straightest shota
Motherfucker
My problem with monmusu quest was that most of the porn was a lose condition and also rape
That it does
though lack of lamia is sad
this sounds good
futa monmusu pirates
wait what about monstergirls
wait a bit and see how it goes
the trick is not to ake risks
I have yet to be burned by early access
https://i.imgur.com/Gs5Jxuw.png
is that fit wolf-girl in the background
for me
honestly the best-looking character there
yeah
this is also wildly off topic for the gaming channel
some chapters he's an adult, some chapters he's a kid
He met her when he was a child
It swings between
If that ain't your jam that's fair
straight shota
There's a fairly popular /ss/ series featuring a moth girl
gimme dat Alcina though
Nemui is cute as hell
Oh
Alternatively I've seen a lot of people "house rules" that you can roll once and just multiply it
>65d6
christ
it looks like a lot of fun
same
sounds like a shitty Bruce Willis sequel that was made 30 years too late
if it's rolling for successes and not "how much do you heal"
I mean that's kinda something completely different then
I've typically seen this applied to stuff that's like 4-6d6 or things like that
Most things also don't have bullshit like *36 d6*
like roll a d6 once and multiply it by whatever
At this point even if it's free day-one DLC for Blake and Yang
I was only really interested in RWBY then "lol DLC"
The development is just so incredibly predatory and disrespectful to customers solely for the sake of rushing it out the door for for EVO, and even then leaving completed content out to sell it later
Oh yeah I've heard good things about the gameplay
of being a *rushed* cash-grab no less
The entire game just reeks of being a cash-grab
20 base characters, at least 11 of the 20 DLC are complete prior to release, 18 of 20 DLC characters consist primarily of recycled/retouched assets
It's not "They should give it to us for free" it's "This content was complete before the game's release, why is it being withheld?"
TF2 still has a large active playerbase
I guess I can ver but that's not really the emotion I was going for
wrong server
oh
there's also always Fortnite <:Ver:336656981144109066>
no idea what the player-base is like though
It claims to be an old-school FPS and I remember it getting pretty decent reviews
Toxikk or something?
what's it
I think there's a free version of that uh
which is really, really fucking frustrating to see
I've never watched his content and don't know anything about him other than everyone is suddenly shouting "HA KARMA HE DESERVED TO DIE FOR SOME DUMB SHIT HE SAID ON SOCIAL MEDIA"
I mean if you want to dislike him, dislike him
guy he said it to accepted his apology
apologized for it
He said it once years ago
Not to mention, the characters that they decided to include his DLC, would be like having a Street Fighter X Mortal Kombat crossover and having Scorpion and Chun-li be dlc
Also the base game is only being sold for $10 less than a standard release
Plus the game developer openly said that they cut the game and had to rush out the door for Evo
18 of the 20 DLC characters are 90%+ recycled assets from previous games
The thing is though, the DLCs don't take much time and money for this game
if even
I'm not giving ArcSys more than $10 for this game at this point
Yeah, I don't care that they're free
the fact that they even *considered* trying to sell half of RWBY as DLC
TES combat sucks pretty bad yeah
Bethesda needs to nut up and either make a brand new engine or use something much more modern
Skyrim needs to die
and I cannot correct for it
Something just feels *wrong* about the way my character moves
I have the same problem with TES and Fallout
Something about the engine just makes movement feel off
The bigger reason is that movement just feels *wrong* to me
That's like a solid 95% of dark souls players
"bad apples"
Literally any complaint is met with "You suck, git gud"
Partly because of the community
but *hate* to play myself
is a game I love to watch people play
Dark Souls
Man
Infinite is love it or hate it
2 was not quite as good overall but aged considerably better
Bioshock 1 is good but has not aged well
As far as the actual games go
I should play Chrono Trigger again
It's cool but not my kinda game
at a friend's house
Only briefly
I've played like 3/4 of Infinite and about half og 1
It's *only* BSI and ME
Racing games, every other FPS, space games, whatever
or anyone not Meta Knight or Snake in brawl
or Ike in Brawl
like Pichu in Melee
but sometimes characters are just so bad that it's noticeable even at casual levels
Tier Lists really only matter at the highest levels
*weeps for charizard and ganondorf*
which was better than any of my other "mains" lmao
so on the bottom end of usable
C-tier
I haven't followed the meta but last I heard he was like
Actually I suppose Ike wasn't terrible in 4, which was nice
*crosses fingers for the heavy characters not to be absolute ass this time around*
which I *think* is gonna be Smash?
Whichever one of those games comes first is gonna be the system mover
Either way
since it came with some other bizarre, improbable shit in it
There was that but I thought that leak was confirmed fake
that said I've never been one for the spinoff Pokemon games
and I didn't think we had anything about Pokemon on the switch other than "We're doing one"
but I'd be glad to be wrong about that
Prime 4 is 2019 I think
Smash will probably be out first
I'm waiting for Bayonetta 3, Smash, Pokemon, and Metroid Prime 4
but I sincerely doubt I'd finish either of them if I bought them
Like they seem like excellent games
I've never been a huge LoZ or Mario player so BotW and Odyssey aren't system-movers for me
I don't want any of the games that are out for it
but the problem is
I want one
It's in this weird gap between a handeld and just "portable"
a switch is portable kinda?
There's a Switch version which
"Yeah but can it run Doom?" will turn into "Yeah but can it run Skyrim?"
Skyrim will become the new Doom
Skyrim for literal toasters
Skyrim for refrigerators
Skyrim for smartphones
unless you mod the shit out of it
and with Skyrim in particular lmao what even is magic
Precisely
I'd say keep Marth, Ike, Robin, and Corrin
Any smash-related forum will feature endless bitching about the number of FE charas
Oh yeah people bitch about it all the time
but have played exactly three hours of FE
because I love all the FE characters
FE is great
Smash gets exponentially more fun with the number of players
which is the best way to play Smash
It's 100% a clusterfuck
8 player is pure chaos and it's wonderful
the stage selection is *terrible* in 3DS
I preferred Wii U
buuuuuuuuut
I do have Smash 3DS though
I sold my Wii U before leaving for Japan
I don't either but I'm gonna fuckin' buy one for Smash lol
whichever it is
or 4.5
We should organize games of Smash when 5 comes out
Bowser's alright but I just can't into DK
Not a big fan of Bowser or DK
Interestingly enough though
which is exactly what Ganon and Ike do
My entire gameplan in Smash is pretty much "Survive long enough for the opponent to make a mistake and then fucking end them in one hit"
See the above logic
I'm *terrible* with lightweights
I loooooove heavies
as of 4
Ike > Ganondorf > all the other Fire Emblem characters > Charizard > everyone else
and you Warlock Fist their ass into oblivion
and ngl using Ganondorf is 500% worth it for the one time that someone forgets about his Super Armor
so I might as well use a character that makes every hit count
so I'm only gonna hit ya once out of every four or five attempts
that I'm bad
I just go by the logic
I understand
I'm torn about Ganondorf getting a rework
but also kinda not, at the same time
I would be pretty surprised if they made an actual third link
and Toon Link will remain essentially untouched
I'm guessing "Normal Link" will get redone to better fit BotW
and Link is obviously safe but will get retooled in accordance with the BotW look
I just don't know if she'll be selectable like she was in 4
I don't think she's gonna be removed
depends on whether they come back as their own charas or become transformations again
I probably could have pinked ZSS and Sheik too
There's no way bayo gets cut
Bayo's a fucking shoe-in
Green = safe
Blue = maybe safe
Red = probable cut
Pink = special case
Greninja was in Smash 4
Oh right
and the roster is getting pretty big
There's not really anyone I super want to add at this point
and I guess people want Golden Sun a lot so I'd be fine with Isaac
he looks cool
I want the lil robot dude
and a digimon
that's Golden Sun and the lil' robot dude right
so I can organize my opinions on who I think is safe or not
roster chart
I need a
Yeah
good night
I'm kinda surprised they weren't added to 4 as DLC
Inklings are a shoe-in
Yeah
*super* Iconic pokemon and they cared enough to *bring him back* after cutting him from Brawl
I'd say Mewtwo is safe
his Aura thing is really unique though
and he's kind of a mish-mash of a bunch of other characters
I'd say cut Lucario since he hasn't been the face of Pokemon for a while
God help everyone if his *other* moves had super armor like that
abusing the shit out of the super armor on Rock Smash was bad enough
or making him brutally OP via gobs and gobs of super armor
and there's no fixing him without completely redoing him
he's so bad
but he sucks
Like he's fun to play
I wouldn't miss Charizard that much
Honestly
I have bias
Also one of Corrin's pallettes is orange spear wielder so
(S)he has a lot of really interesting movement options
Corrin I only say keep because his moveset is fairly unique
like I'd be *shocked* if Mewtwo was missing from 5
Although I somehow doubt they're gonna drop any characters they dropped and then brought back
it's *roy*
I like Roy but
The pocket never bothered me, but I rarely played characters with projectiles
I cannot get the hang of him and one of my friends was *really* good with him
I hate villager lol
I don't really care about either company very much so I get them confused sometimes
Capcom and Bamco aren't the same
Oh right
as their inclusion relies solely on their parent companies still working with Nintendo
for me
Cloud (and the BAMCO characters) are all special cases
Like as someone who semi-mained Ganondorf in 4 I can't play Falcon worth a shit because it's like trying to play the game at 2x speed
insofar
inasfar? insofar?
and much more combo-heavy, inasfar as smash has combos
Falcon is *way* faster
Like yeah I get that his moves are nearly the same but the differences, while small, make his overall playstyle wildly different
He plays dramatically differently
Eh
but at the same time I *love* how he's just brute force: the character
that he's terribly inaccurate to the source material
from the LoZ fans perspective
I thought SuMo were the best it had been in a long time
Did people really not like Sun/Moon?
At least we're getting another mainline title next year
It looks weird
"Oh, I want a ________. I'm gonna raise the best one I can possibly get."
like once I get to postgame all I do is breed pokemon, 'cause it's fun
I don't even play comp but I like the EV/IV bullshit
Yeah I'll probably be skipping these
It just feels like they're throwing Go a bone
Exactly
The only thing I'm excited about this though is the co-op aspect
Though the long-ass cutscenes and the like 4-hour tutorial were pretty lame
It changed up the formula *just enough*
and that's officially a "nope"
>no wild battles
that's a blast from 2008
holy fuck nitrome
Last one I played was 4A
Oh
Or did Bamco publish
Or at least it was when I last played it
It's made by FromSoft
Armored Core isn't Bamco though, is it?
FromSoft needs to suck it up and put Armored Core on PC
Maybe some DLC for GoW
Sony will probably just be Spider-Man and TLoU2
To see if I need to buy a Switch yet
I'm pretty much only interested in Nintendo right now
Though Bethesda could pull a DOOM follow-up out of their ass which would be a huge plus for them
Either EA or Bethesda
As far as *worst*
I'd put money on Ubi being the least interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME30uIZx1sQ because this game is fucking rad tbh and it's the one game I miss most on my gaming PC
I have faith it will release eventually, but the release date is when it's on shelves, not when Squeenix says it is
you mean 2021
2019(tm)
they didn't show anything
TES6 only got title dropped
Models look normal but the textures have probably been redone
Yeah
Well, textures looked a little nice for a game from 2004
and maybe a framerate bump
I'm not expecting much more than a resolution bump
they said "upgraded visuals"
"remaster"
well
It's a remaster of the original
what *was* that
One of the guys in the audience exploded from hype lol
MECH AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
CHAOOOOOOOOOOOOS
WOLF
METAL
the new Jump game looks fun
Same character
It's about goddamn time Metroid got a second rep
but hey look at that
I mean neither did FE
One of the biggest recurring villains
He's basically the Big Bad of the series
One of the hunters from Prime 3?
The SA-X?
Who else would you put in?
Did we watch the same announcement
>Ridley
>kind of boring
Even if it's not the best ever, it'll be fun enough for the visuals to carry it
They know how to make an action game
it's the Senran Kagura team
I want to see some gameplay but I mean
but it looks really cool
I was not expecting that at all
Yeah
since they have to bring back a bunch of characters that got cut from Brawl or 4
Sakurai did say the newcomer list will be small though
Newcomers include Inklings and fuckmothering *Ridley*
i.e. Ice Climbers, Wolf, Snake, etc
No cuts, and anyone who didn't make it into 4 is also back
With all previous Smash characters returning
"Smash Ultimate"
Both
it was a good mix of arcadey and structured
but I think Melee handled single-player the best
I'm not a big melee-only nerd
Honestly
They would have mentioned a big single player mode
Yeah
Ridley was the only logical option for adding more Metroid representation
I mean if you just want to piss on the hype go right ahead
and in ZSS debut they were the same character
Different style
>KLK ArcSys game
so either it's just not there yet or it's plausible there's going to be a Dark Samus Echo Fighter
Apparently in the E3 demo build, Samus doesn't have a Dark Samus color palette anymore
Rising? Great
Bayo? Great
Vanquish? Great
Transformers? Great
Nier? Complete shitshow
Platinum's other PC ports are great
The weird thing is
so I had to work up the will to start from the beginning again on PS4
but technical difficulties prevented me from progressing too far into it
Because I got partway through on PC
My big issue was starting *over*
it was great
I sat down and played like seven hours of Nier Automata today
Man I forgot what it was like to just *play video games*
step one?
was that like
when you set it up, did it prompt for a system language
Question for Switch owners
and idk if that was good
who made the LWA game
and it's maybed by someoena nmaed APlus
we'll see how it goes though snce apparently it's only *publushed* by Arcsys
KLK game *fucking confirmed*
I liked the story but the whole "go to school" thing was just a drag
But all the stuff in between the combat segments bored me
I liked the... I guess you could call it dungeoning?
I played part of P4G
after this long I'm not sure I want to bother
I've been itching to play KF2 lately but >shooters on console
Killing Floor 2 is $15 on PSN...
I don't know shit about soccer I'm just watching it because I'm a bit drunk and it's an easy conversation topic
Japan is already doing waaaaaaaay better than usual apparently
which most of my students were expecting
better than a loss
I seent it
I wanna play it for Yang
man I hate that this game is such a shitshow
overrides to I Burn too
That's great
LMAO
>automatic install super
I'll watch that when I've sobered up
Cool
but I am too fdurnk to comprehend
that would be cool to watch
Celeste
did they TAS Ceelst
wait
I was told it was good but I was not told *why* it was good
I went in with hype but basically blind
but it *is* pretty damn good
It's not the greatest game ever made
I'll say that
It *is* overhyped
some of the OST is slaying me on the re-listen though
I didn't cry during the game, but I got pretty close
but Nier: Automata was p fuckin' good
I know I'm a good 18 months late to the party
so like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_oREd67HlA&feature=youtu.be new trailer for GRIP which means here I am to shill again
so it's like "Yeah I want to game but I'm also tired and sitting down for a gaming session at 12:30 on a work night is a terrible idea"
My problem is I always get the itch to play a game right before it's time to go to bed
been jonesing for an oldschool platformer
looks fun though
same with Crash for the most part
I missed Spyro by a couple years and also by being a nintendo babby
same with Metroid Prime 4 and Bayonetta 3
I got hyped for Daemon X Machina at E3 too but that's not launching until 2019
Actually that might be my excuse to buy a Switch lmao
I'll probably buy GRIP for it too when that's released
It seems like a great indie machine
Yeah
never got into the first Splatoon and, despite how great both games look, I've never been a big Mario or Zelda person
but there hasn't been a system-mover for me yet
I'm sure I'd use it if I had it
I was just hoping I could get one before and not have to worry about any special edition BS lol
I mean I'm buying a Switch for Smash regardless
I wanted an excuse to actually buy a switch before the Smash rush
but like
Yeah
but Let's Go just doesn't look... fun
Switch
I really, really wanted to be excited for Pokemon on Switsh
man
since Cycling Road is apparently some massive downhill , it's possible that it's built up high enough to allow the ships to pass beneath it?
That would be my assumption, too
Huh
Well
I
Nah just a family tradition thing
I should buy a video game
>Friday the 13th
aight lmao
@ me if you want a coupon for 25% off the new God of War
so I just got a coupon for a game I never intend to play
same
we have a fair few channels, but they're all clearly defined
I just mean I don't think this server is anywhere near that being an issue yet
Oh I totally get the concerns
I don't think there's any problem with adding more channels in general, but that's me
but I play enough XDU that I don't feel it's worth complaining
I'm in the same boat as zolg tbh
but I just... can't justify it with the games that are out right now
I really want to get a Switch
The sad thing is
I should get Vroom in the Night Sky
Xenoblade just doesn't grab me
Oh Celeste would be good
I will not
I've heard Mario vs Rabbids isn't bad either, but on principal of >rabbids
been kinda jonesin for some Mario Kart
Oh right MK8D
Never been big into Mario Tennis
what game would I get to go with it
and I was not going to buy Odyssey, BotW, Octopath, Splatoon 2, or Bayonetta
If I were to buy a Switch today
BECOME AS GODS
I just need a game I *really* want to play for it
Usually top, sometimes bottom if it's a *really* long fall and it's hard to judge the horizontal distance from the top
that's it
yeah there we go
here's mine
My... Amani? Dragon man
I enjoyed that the armor was equal-opportunity stripperific
I played Tera for a while
That was their names
CASTANIC
I mostly played it as a social game with a friend and she stopped playing so
I didn't get very far with it either
The last time I played was right when they introduced Gunner
"Yeah the female armor is basically lingerie, but to be fair, that's the case for the dudes too"
the dark elves or whatever they were
Yeah
and it was great
My dragon man tank character had his midriff showing
assuredly
someone already has
zombie killin'
Killing Floor 2
WHAT ARE WE CAN BE A FUCKING PROBLEM
does anyone here have KF2 on PS4
help us save us floop is a madman
Oh shit Evo
KLK game was cofnirmed months ago, yo
but I'll assume it loks fun
I'm not sober enough to comprehend the trailer
I'm gonna fuck that dog
can't wait for 3
Both games are
Bayonetta is nothing short of spectacular
Amazing
so I might stay up to watch
At least I don't have to work tomorrow
rip
16 hours back from me so... starts at 2AM
I'm in Japan so my value for "tomorrow" might be somewhat different from yours
what time is "tomorrow"
wait
aww ye
when's the Xrd shit happening
Yeah that was S1 era
Yeah that was it
but she did get a cameo in some VN or something
I forget what
She was in something
the Living Room on 4U was Nintendogs IIRC
I've probably just forgot
Genuine question
Balloon Fighter has an AT?
any *other* franchises
but no playable character?
Are there any other franchises that have a stage *and* an AT?
Speaking of
I'd just like Adventure Mode tbh
He's got Ike's smashes for sure
but Ike and Marth are absolutely nothing alike
You can meme if you want about Roy/Marth/Lucina
in all:
Simon Belmont (full newcomer)
Richter (Simon Echo)
Dark Samus (Samus Echo)
Chrom (Ike Echo)
King K. Rool (full newcomer)
if anyone still cares about her
Krystal also deconfirmed
Ashley and Shovel Knight deconfirmed
I like the new "tracks are bound to a franchise instead of a stage" option
Or at least *something* from Castlevania given Nintendo "leaked" it earlier
Probably
You can change a setting so it doesn't do that
I've never been a big fan of Stamina Mode but I've got nothing against it
Un-fucking-playable outside of FD mode
It fucking ruined the Megaman stage in 4
I hope they change it
*cough*yellowdevil*cough*
Some of them spawn *way* too often
Stage Hazards range from fun to obnoxious
since some of his moves were pulled straight from Ike
He's the most distant Echo we've seen yet then
Well shit
Is MSRP on a Switch still $300 USD
Hey wait
Got some good gifts for my best friend, too
One of them is a Ditto Lapras too, how cute
They have three different Lapras though so fuck yeah
They have Chikorita and Totodile but no Cyndaquil plush
These motherfuckers
Warhammer looks fun but also looks like way to much effort for me lmao
Oh shit these signs are here because the Kyoto Pokemon Center is close
Beep beep, best Pokemon coming through
Like, honestly, the game I'm most interested in on the switch right now is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which I got my fair share of on the Wii U
The big problem is, right now there's just nothing I really want to play on it
Yeah I'll probably pick one up around early November
I have the money, it's just a question of getting a decent price and getting one before the inevitable Smash rush
Oh it's used
This one is being sold for like $280 after tax
Honestly, it didn't seem like a bad game, watching people play it at all. It just had quite possibly the worst DLC practices prior to cross tag battle
I would ask them if they remember what happened to Evolve, but that would require people to remember Evolve
https://store.steampowered.com/app/627890/Reventa/
I'll let you know in six months when I have a gaming PC again lmao
Looks like a Bayonetta/MGR:R knockoff, but for a low enough price I thought I might bite
Something called Reventa
I figured that was just dead
Well, alright then
>get an email from Steam
>game that got greenlit literal years ago just went up on Early Access after like eight months of radio silence from the dev
