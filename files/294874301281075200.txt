need help with body raid
i only have aot basa at lv60
anyone who can help with body raid
i have 2 of her
the other body 5star is also a maria
im more focused on the pve
im not too much of a pvp person
does she haave type advantage over popular units?
<@!99695384296701952> pls can u explain further
if i can just get her dammit
biki is d one
aot basa is underwhelming
aot sword???
and i started with double biki in first multi and didnt see her again till her guaranteed multi
im at 13 multi with 7 basa and 3 biki
its so annoying
ive wanted her but always getting aot basa instead
i want aot biki
this rerolling is making me broke with its data consumption
lemme try to reroll 1 more time for mlb biki
i keep getting basa instead
im burnt out rerolling for mlb aot biki
im out of gems and biki is just lv54 so no hope for mlb biki
