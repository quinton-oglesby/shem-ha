<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
That little bit of yandere in her gives her that edge
Miku, the most intense of them all
üôåüèΩ
It‚Äôs my number 1 and has been since I found it a couple years ago
Hey!!!!!! Omg I‚Äôm so glad there‚Äôs a discord for this anime
oh you have the title already?
oh, damn, it's 4pm here
starting it off strong showing us a custodian
spoiler's for days
that's true
sorry, dumb question but was just so excited
OMG LOVED THE EPISODE, who else finished?
tbh, for this episode, when they all froze, I was kinda thinking
by acknowledging the memes
LOL at least they seem really into their fanb ase
in here you can
I was like omg NOOO, NOISE SHOULD BE NOTHING NOW
even though i knew they were different
yeah, when the noise beat them in season 3
which, yeah, was all planned
the autoscorers seemed to always look down on them until they got their ignite module
but that was back when hibiki was supposed to be hyper op
I think it was just season 3 then
yeah, that's true
ouuu nice
until they got their fauste robe
well, last season they did too
yeah, someone finally acknowledging the sympohogear team
but maybe they play the role that the autoscorers did for carol
also, it doesn't seem like any of the introduced bad guys seem more serious
i thought that they would have maria convert everyone's power into her sniper and go fopr it when she was talking about it
I like that they were there, I would like it to be kind of more common to block more stuff
yeah
I guess, it reduced it
it sucks that her reflectors were useless again
just like yas, support them!
and my favorite, chris getting her time to shine with her sniping skill
LOL right?!
who needs relic pieces lodged in your chest when you're just that strong
hibiki being op, even under water
loving it all
that whole transformation was like what.. WHHHAATT... DAMMMNN
I love that they called back to the first season with the beginning of that transformation
but it'll be worth it
shitty
mmm can't read that LOL
I need that song
but considering tsubasa can make it riain swords on everyone and it touches nobody on her team, I guess the wielder of ssj could do the same
I would be scared to have her watch my back
ssj has too many friendly fire flaws
he does know how to make linker
he knew about fine's research
oh yeah
but I wonder what
yeah, I know miku will have something to do this season
I thought they gave what they had to miku who destroyed it
but would they even have shenshoujing in their possession?
LOL that's true
not so much for the custodians
I thought her whole thing was that she loved god and just wanted to remove the curse she caused
ohhhh
but I don't remember if I saw anything with fine
it seemed like she was jsut always kinda doing her own thing
does fine want to do anything involving the custodian's, from what saint germain mentioned
I loved that part
hibiki almost set chris's flag
yeah witht eh frozen thing, I thought they would even have miku come in since she can remove unnatural phenomena
remove his counters
release genjuro
omg yes
and have the new team go to rescue them or something
that, that was what they would go for
that, with everyone saying for season 5 they should replace the team
oh okay, thanks!
oh aww
just on the reddit?
btw where do i get the invite link for this discord
I knoowww
when i saw that, MY HEART
hopefully we get an s2 callback with a cute little bang
back to xv, CHRIS'S TRANSFORMATION WHEN
here's to us getting out of that bad habit
same
those games really know how to hook you
but I'm all in control finally
yeah, for a bit I had an issue with spending when I saw a cute unit
GOODBYE ALL THESE UPCOMING BIRTHDAYS
if it gets a release
omg
since I learned it existed. I already am super addicted to gacha games like ffbe and epic 7
I wanteed to play that game so bad
I wish that they had a bigger following in NA so they'd make an app
I was like, ouuuu, do we have attitude in hibiki now?
oh yeah, with the scarf coming uip
AFTER SO LOGN Y'ALL ARE BACK
JUST SITTING HERE FANGIRLING
I KNOW
I'm right there with you
and they used up their first episode intense action
I wonder what parts will be explained next episode now that shit has calmed down
nice
LOL
omg
and all over those scientists
getting that shit everywhere
she's just a bit messy
oh yeaH, my bad
just everyone coughing up blood in this show
I honestly thought they had what mom had
oh, they had a hole in their chest
the more music, the better
or fuck something up
she probably will with that what if I cause trouble line
team Neapolitan and team primary colours
with shirabe
I swear she was skating on ice
I lvoe them all
i know
I loved her transformation last season and how she used her scythe
then i will die
and if kirika's is as good as last season
tsubasa is just hyper
maria's will always be beautiful
I want that bang in chris's
ughhhh
just
maria too
if that's the first transformation then omg I don't know how many more I can take
i love it
yeah, with how they link all the seasons to the newest
they really know where to dump their budget
This is why I love this show
IT'S ALL TOO AMAZING
and <@486087033652248576>  SUPER SAME
I thought she of all people would know
you're bound to lose a bit of weight
all that stress of the world ending
oh yeah
hopefully of xdu
maybe they are trying to get on his good side for the american releases
and slimmed down
LOL right?!
and that's gonna not show this season?
in the last season, when they released the barrier coating, did they end ignite module?
I knooowww
and if the other will do unison again this season
I can't wait to hear shirabe and kirika's songs and how they will be in unison this season
i thought, cause of that flashback that they would do something to maria to get her to go mad
poor girl
damn that ptsd for tsubasa
right?!
I thought carmilla was gonna break tsubasa by taking the hostage and pushing her onto tsubasa's sword
she's thinking another season 1, episode 1 will happen
but yeah, this episode really gave me feels for tsubasa
just making sure I didn't miss anything
so did all 100000 people die?
some people just don't learn
yeah, I feel like after almost every season of a concert attack, they would make sure all the gear users were ready
oh, I didn't catch it, gotta pay closer attention to everything next time
do you think that elfnein will ever get to use some of carol's power or is that just gone (I mean combat wise)
at this point it would be safer
LOL
spend the day ion another city
I'd be terrified every time tsubasa announced a big concert
at this point
after seeing hibiki just jump that high over every building in the season
at least in season 1
or just their jumps
that's true
I'm assuming that when chris uses them as transport she does something to limit that
lol
or get a really big riocket and they can hide on it
then chris can just rocket them over
if they just revealed themselves as gear users
tsubasa, put the sword down
omg, don't do it
when she said her line, I was like\
but I think they were waiting on the helicopter
oh yeah, we went passed that, with chris's missiles needing a charge up and the back fire
but that's millions of swan songs in one so I don't think that would work lol
I'd die of happiness
honestly, if I could just hear Senkin Dur da Bla again
LOL
I just want to know what camille did to tsubasa when she made her go insane. Like was that to intensify her emotions to make her more out of control or if it's for future use
hit us with all the fanservice before making us watch basa get mentally fucked
fanservice
story
action
I mean, considering it's the last season they gotta go all out everywhere
LOL
I still see them as so innocent tho T_T
considering last season with all the string
I wonder if they'll end up giving shirabe the same treatment
that's what I wanna know, maybe in the shorts they'll tell us
LOL
oh no
since the other girl's got their moments over the other seasons
but it makes sense making her address her shit now
yeah, you knew she was gone then
I wonder how far they will go with it
yeah, tsubasa got fucked up this episode (mentally)
and sorry to make you go through that again T_T
yeah, lol, thanks!
i can't get that frame lol
i think he was the second one to die after ones of the noise sliced the first girl in half
at tsubasa's concert
from this episode
seemed off from the rest of the terrorized ones
I swear he made an intense af face
does anyone have a screen shot of when that one guy in the navy shirt got killed by the noise
my tops are chris, kirika, and maria
and her songs
I loved her
I knew, since the day chris first shot down hibiki and then gave her a swift kick to the stomache
eyyyy
but, I think her transformation last season was my favorite
She's up there for me, but I will always have chris as my favorite
she really wants to be the favorite
for all those thigh high fetishists
damn, after watching the episode again, I noticed that in kirika's transformation, she even sneaks in a cheeky little sock pull
I  wonder what everyone else thought when she first changed up her transformation in front of them
love it
ever since learning close range pistol fighting from an action movie
ouuu all roles
the archer is also the tank
LOL
I should be supporting her new life choices
that's true
sounds about right
the addict becomes a pole dancer
causeaxz was chris talking about her past and that fight with sonia
if I remember it right
but it's usually like that with the second episodes, ending off with the introduction of this season's big trauma
it was messy
bikki was an easy tar4get for the people in her neighbourhood
it's easier to blame the survivors, especially the weak ones that won't fight back
I guess, if trying to make sense of it, when someone looses something, some people need to find somewhere to toss their anger
LOL
blame them for it all
but I think she got over it
time to bring back the old bikki trauma
and seeing that she's at the scene now
oh damn
I just found him super annoying
he's annoying, vampire chick is just about destroying people yet she wants to be all upset when she gets beat
I just want him knocked out
also
but who knows, the show is self aware at times so maybe they are leading us on
yeah, I can see it being almost the exact same
those 3 will probably get a redemption moment and badass song
I FUCKING KNEW THAT PIECE OF SHIT INCENTIOUS GRANFATHER WAS A FUCKWAD
yeah, tbh I think I was involved once I got into the story, and then when they showed chris and her backstory
you can't say no
then get into the gx first episode
once they get passed season 1 and see that shiny new budget
with all it's hiccups
yeah, people can't get past the first season
closet fans
but are all being hush hush
I think people secretly love it
BUT IT'S THE BEST
I'm like
but friends gave it a hard pass cause of the singing
I got some of my family hooked
I want to get more people hooked on it
i knooww
but sorry, chris stole teh show
I loved it
poor shirabe
yeah
LOL, Chris is just... I'm always jsut here for her
BULLETS FROM HER BOOBS
HER TRANSFORMATION
MY GIRL
SHE DID IT
cause "BANG"
3 so far was amazing
oh true
forgot the episode
fighting
like with bikki and miku
or was that nine
isn't episode 6 always one of their big bangs?
yeah, you think it's their faust robe, or are they done with that
and I'm like, okay, you're purposely skipping it at this point
but then skip past symphogear
I remember seeing youtubers be like, here are the summer season anime and what i think
not on twitter so wouldn't have noticed
wait, she said something?
no follow up tho
someone asked her and told her the premise and she wanted to watch it
in a podcast
I think lily pichu
was where I was like, okay, I'm in for good
Hibiki, and that duet with her kickass son from axz??!!!! I‚Äôm sorry???!!! Just, DAMN
Also, I fucking love this episode
I loved her transformation! Sure there was some... excessiveness, but Maria will always be elegant and just gorgeous!
You know what would be fun and a cute callback (probably not gonna make any progress in the show though) if tsubasa  reverts hard to being a blade, and she forces the other girls to stand down against Fudou and when they fight she uses her s1 song
Which biki knew, hence why she tried to get her back with karaoke
Right now tsubasa is reverting back to s1
And is able to live with it
Maria seems to have come to an understanding with her weakness
I think highest priority right now is tsubasa
Finish off the character‚Äôs issues
Petition to make this season a 24 episode
But I think Chris dealt with the death of her parents with Sonya
And by axz she was just there
I think the one who does need her focus episode is tsubasa. This is the perfect time to make her address kanade‚Äôs death cause I feel like they just made her get over it, or bottle it up, clearly cause of episode 2‚Äôs ptsd
Yeah I hope they don‚Äôt do it because most of the characters don‚Äôt really have much trauma that they didn‚Äôt already tackle
And yeah, dainsleif was hinted from ep 1 of gx
But yeah, that power was supe rout of the blue
They had to figure out how to put the girls in danger since they were stronger than the bad guys
Yeah, I think that trap was just to force that power up to happen
Yeah, I hear you
Oh, damn, sorry it‚Äôs been a bit since I watched gx
You have to die for that sweet redemption karma lol
In axz
And got the ignite upgrade by then as well
But I think usually they don‚Äôt wait long to show power ups, I think ignite was successfully used by ep4
Yeah that‚Äôs true, that little self reflection of hers was just about if the blue, then, SNAP, she‚Äôs over it
Mind you my dumbass never caught on that, that was what Te crystal heart was
But, tbf, they did show us that they gave hem something since first seeing the philosopher‚Äôs stone since the first transformation
Yeah that‚Äôs true
Maybe with Chris since she always seemed to be in fights with Chris last season
I super hope with St Germain coming back that I get to see Cagliostro one more time. Super fan of her
Yeah, she just needs that extra push at this point, which I see Millaarc doing
Hence the delay in her transformation and song
I feel like they are gonna be told that they will be weapon‚Äôs in the war against the world to put japan on top. The girls will refuse since they never want to use their gear as weapons against people, then tsubasa, going back to being nothing but a blade to be wielded by japan will go on the grandfather‚Äôs side for a while
Fangirling super hard, tsubasa‚Äôs bitch ass grandfather now making a move
Clad the girls in Nokia Armor
New gear upgrade
So that‚Äôs probably gonna happen
Well, ep 6 is usually a banger of an episode
Oh that‚Äôs true
Yeah
Can they convey more powerful emotions into old songs to@power it up
So maybe a unison power up I guess?
Mind you it was duet
When biki sang her song and got stronger
I figured when you said that
Yeah
Her gear reverted to be weaker and avoid the anti linker
When bass dance her s1 song
That in s2
But an issue is though
But I guess since it‚Äôs not that popular it won‚Äôt happen
With crunchy roll promoting symphogear I think there is some money in them getting Digital copies to sell
I can‚Äôt wait for tsubasa but girl is too stressed to sing, hopefully fudou doesn‚Äôt make her go against the rest
I just heard them on SoundCloud
Nyaa? I‚Äôll check it out
They need to get on that digital life so I can support them
Damn
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve used a cd in a while
Is there any way to get digital copies?
I want to buy them but broke life rn
Really?
Chris, and Kirika
That was a super nice surprise ü•∞
When did the full songs come out?
i guess that's true
it's just too much fun
try not to think to hard when watching this anime
no miku?
oh damn
man I'm so glad i get to hear her sing again
THROWBACKS
MY JUST
WHAT
omg
where elfnein pulled it from
maybe she put it back in that space
just make genjiro go beat up the god and hibiki takes care of miku
and outfit
guess cause of the voice
ohhh
she didn't?
thankfully they did
for a sec, when she went faust robe, I was wondering if they would age her up too
because she's gone for carol
I thought elfnein was going to just resort to eating away her memories to gain power to fight
THE DESTROYER OF MIRACLES
and hearing carol's voice
but this shit wants to put me in the hospital
every episode I think I recove3red from last season
i know
24 EPISODE SERIES
easy
yeah, i guess cause they are figuring out how to wrap it all up
anything that let's me see garie one last time
but still loved it soooo much
and bringing up old issues
or that he knows she's not over it
I think he knows something
yeah
she actually loved him this whole time
cause her lingering feelings for ver
there is no basa and maria
and at the end
what if they play everyone
that's true
LOL omg, pls no
the universe sends plot armor after you
this is what happens when you bully elfnein
but I feel like he would go to kill carol most likely
his turn to save elfnein
LOL
"nobody else from a past season better show their asses up here"
yeah, vanessa got cheated
or those rail guns from her s1 sqan song
if I was chris, I would have quickly switched my gun into the sniper and taken the whole arm
and she always just gets beat the fuck up
yeah, poor vanessa with her arm getting blown up twioice
well, not so strong without the chateau
with her shit ton of swan songs worth of power in that song
but then she would just destroy the enemy
I would have died
lol if I heard her sing that
she was just like, "garie, wtf"
i love how when garie threw her
LOL, love it
loved it
and her whole speech
also sad since it just goes over her happily falling to her death
I love it
yeah
from the song or episode?
TYYYYYYY
I thought it didn't existed and resorted to just going to the scene where chris died to hear it
OMG, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED THIS SONG
wait, it's called bark at the moon?
just that one sound part, unless it's in all her songs
chris's song has portions from her s1 song in the background music
yeah, her transformation is gorgeous
the end
a piece falls to the earth and ends the baddies' plans
just make the moon save the day
she's sooo happy
I was like awwwww
but, when genjiro congratulated her, basa made the cutest face
WE CAN ONLY HANDLE SO MUCH
GIRL, THERE IS A FUCKING GOD BEING BORN, GET YO SHIT TOGEHTER
honestly, someone needs to go to basa and be like
loved her sooo much
I would kill for more Cag
dang, you just get everyone back with alchemy
how dare you turn my favorite girl on me
KILLING THE FANDOM
<@185949743321579520> LOL
dbz prequel
go all the way
Might as well have it all
LOVE IT
I KNOW, THE HYYYPPPEEE
omg, awww T~T
watch her regress so hard she goes after hibiki for trying to replace kanade again
she's straight up broken
actually no, she snapped a while ago
the poor girl is breaking
damn, when you want to give basa more ptsd triggers
I feel like airgetlam and maria had more elegance it would fit garie more
LOL  just let her go through all the gear like she's shopping for outfits
but chris will never leave
oh no, I love garie
they were heavily damaged
oh, i guess that's true
you'd think they woulkd wipe the floor here
yeah, considering the autoscorers easily beat the gear users unless they had ignite
or an isekai with this being frieza's reincarnation to a new world
please don't let it be him
when I saw gen get plowed into the ground I was liek oh no
yeah, this is the end
tbh, I thought that they would start killing off characters to be like
mb
they do 13
oh yeah
but 3 eps left
when hibiki was leaving that outfit looked so close to what she wore in s1 ep 1
nothing like domestic abuse to knock your wife back into her senses
loved it
that slap was good
oh, actually
love that about her
she just got bashed around
I wish maria did a tiny bit more even if it's not her moment
damn
she was about to just cut him up
girl, still had some control in her
it really was
cause it seems like she didn't catch on right away
did he block basa's attack with his head or did she stop it
even though it was like 2 seconds
I'm glad he finally got to fight
damn, that was a short af betrayal arc
without fighting or suffering
yeah, chris had her suffer moments but I think she's an interesting enough character to have a slice of life, comedy
GIRL I REALLY HOPE YOU BEAT THAT TIMER
I LOVE THIS
OMG
and was like
I rememebr when I heard rainbow flower while she was fighting miku
ouuu those are my favorite from her
oh nice
she's independent
but then chris will be left out üò¶
oh damn
but it will just be slice of life
they'll make a spin off
and then
I want to see chris graduate
it's everyone's heaven but fudou's
but he's still a bitch tho
yeah, I know he truly wants to protect japan
since he hates music so much
have him sit there while all the girls play karaoke around him
no last minute redemption tho
I don't think any prison can hold him
I wonder how they'll contain fudou
that's why the shit grandpa made his comment
yeah, he did
I was just there with heart eyes
even when he was plowed into the earth
they were
and go
just to pierce him
nehushtan will make it's surprise comeback
Y'ALL ARE TEAM ROCKET
GIRL
I was like
and released shem-ha
and after they fucked shit up AGAIN
yeah, someone said that noble red is more like team rocket in this anime
he doesn't support yuri
JUMPSCARE
and BAM
I was just enjoying the heart to heart
oh yeah, maria got knocked the fuck out
and I'm like, uhhhh, girl, he can't listen if you go that intense
then she goes killer mode right away
yeah, and after I thought tsubabsa learned and wanted to show her conviction to fudou with how she can use her songs to save people when she was all "listen to my song"
I think if basa wasn't stopepd she would have ended him
gen FINALLY being allowed to fight
maria knocking sense into basa
fudou gettign beat the fuck up
and just crammed it hard into this episode
it's like they heard what everyone wanted\
it's all about putting in those movie references
for the sub
around 2pm I spam that refresh button
yeah, this shit has me screaming every week
it will be hard to recover from that one
yeah, I feel like cause they were so weak and needed blood
I'd life if shem-ha made it a point to sever vanessa's hand again
then just halves big sister
yeah, shem-ha fucked those 2 up first
that was a sick sword
so i could just stay excited forever
I wish I had the levels of discipline to not watch symphogear and binge it at the end
so that means all the gear can be equipped as a standalone faust robe?
although it makes sense now
I also didn't expect shenshoujing to be a faust robe
ouuu finally some answers
so badass
I always replay that scene where chris is lifting up the car and starts singing
it really is
everything chris does is cuteness overload
now that she tackled her shit she just wants everyone to do their best
than suffering, and beign a backbone for others
she's having more fun
I feel like in her fights
SOMEONE PLEASE MAKE THAT A SOUNDBITE
when I heard that I was like
soooooo cute
"PUT YOUR HANDS UP" engrish
was chris's
I think one thing in these episodes that really made me squeal
oh so it's like a mode shifting thing
it seemed very defensive with that shield and the op attacks it took head on
but power ups count
yeah, he beat the shit out of her base form
or got him
if he didn't hesitate
and gen did get told that he might have won
oh dang, I just saw that someone posted a 1 hour video essay on symphogear
unless bikki goes s2ca on it
that's gonna be a lot of ketchup
let the world all sing the swan song with bikki
cause swan songs would have been world ending
but it was people in this season
I thought in gx, she was saying that she had to power of 7 billion swan songs
genocide of the gods
gods are nothing to her alchemy
beats the fight easy
carol comes back last minute to save them all
everyone gets a gear!
damn, my bad, didn't pay attention to that
ohhhhh
considering there was 2 gear for gungnir I was thinking they could do a faust robe of it
so they had part of the actual shenshoujing?
oh
yeah, just walk up to her slowly
if you trip her, you're dead
yeah, blades come from everywhere on this girl LOL
she'd have to give them super huge power upgrades to make them viable int he current fights
was this cause of cr's push?
oh well, there are a couple of video essays about symphogear in august
is it good?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N18mHJYulBE
gonna give that a watch
but when she got hit I was like FUCK
he's got titan powers
girl I hope you're not broken
he was cute tho
is it a promo for a new show?
is this an ad?
I was like, wait
LOL <@301205769494331393> same
I was like, oh damn
yeah, and the truth about the curse
oh, I teared up
yeah
then it played
they are NOT about to do this
I was like omg, bitch no
and then it diud the cut back
when maria was all, "remember when we first sang"
I ACTUALLY FAN GIRL SQUEALED
WHEN THEY SANG THAT SONG
I WAS SO HAPPY
T_T
BUT LIKE
oh okay
I won't say anything
oh
MARIA AND TSUBASA
I CRIED
GUYS
OMG
HOLY
enki loves fine, but fine loves shem ha
or what if it's one big love triangle
or biki's god slayer
either kirika's complete death
it seems like the one way to kill her outside of biki tho
I was like, pls donm't betray them AGAIN
when chris was pondering about ending the curse
but actually re trap them in shem ha's control
yeah, she was thinking she would free humans
enki seems to like fine
but it was actually to protect her
fine thinks the gods put up the curse in spite of her
with all the misunderstandings
cause this is starting to become a god level shoujo
is fine in love with shem ha or enki
but the shard of a god vs the shard of weapons, unless the rest have that theoretical weapon power up that gungnir has
and the other gear are weapons used by humans
oh
considering it's the shard of a god
damn, so technically maria should have one of the stronger gears
and I guess airgetlam is straight up enki's arm
make that edit
LOL
so use to it, that it seemed lkike something that would happen
and, I mean, it's such an anime thing to not tell someone something important in the second when it makes sense to
SAME
so they chose to try that route
liek teh show writers wanting to give chris a conflict
I'm not sayign they wouldn't but like, they just told them to come and would tell them once they got there
I was so busy just loving everything that maybe I glossed it over LOL
unless I missed something
as in freeing humans
her thoughts were that the enemy was in the right
or got distracted
where they were waiting for her to arrive to tell her
and misunderstandings seems to always be a driving plot
cause anime logic is a thing
or she was in that call with homebase, cause she seemed to really consider the other side might be right
I really hope maria and tsubabsa told chris about the truth of the curse
GOLDEN ROCKETS
episode 12 is gonna be Chris's Amalgam
yeah, I think Adam mentions all custodians cause it's not just shem-ha he wants to stop but any custodian's that would possibly come to Earth
Adam seems closer to Shem-Ha now since they both wanted control over the human race
THAT WAS ME AS SOON AS AMRIA AND TSUBASA SANG
that's why she loved the god's so much
maybe that's where Fine learned her kinks from
the God's gotta look good too
yeah, she's a cutie too
man, Maria is just too gorgeous
you've got the god killer, absolute death, or the out of the blue gear eater nephilim to end this off
he'll be the one to end Shem-Ha
or no hat
so the trunks and hat combo
he has to have something to burn for alchemy
LOL
I feel like he'd just go to the beach naked
enki looks like the star guardian ezreal skin
loli or adult carol
which carol do you want tho
I think that's just her way of speech
that chibi milaarc was adorable
mmm, I think chris was already resolved
that's true
I  love the extra explanation tha the ova gives in cute forms
but I think it's too much
some people said they could wrap it up in a surprise movie
I hope that the OVA fixes things up
so I watched the end. Super sad tha it's done, and happy and all that, but it didn't feel all too complete
Chris Slice of Life
yes
ouuu
bringing up stuff
I think maria got left a bit uncompleted
