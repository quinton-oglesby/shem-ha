Hello everyone
Welcome
Welcome to the server
Hooray for July 7 being Sympho Day
The nerves have started
<@237964037898502144> is Hibiki
There we go
I will
Something that hasn't been really a thing for them to struggle
Watching it, I think the opening scene was probably worse than the S3 one but better than S4.
Just seen the first episode and I am definitively not ready for the end of this show.
Yes I just watched Episode 2
Hmmm, hmmm
Umm I don't think so
Just finished E3 now
So yeah just watch episode 6 and this may or may not be leaning towards a 10 if I enjoy the next seven episodes as my rating is going up.

Well I might think we might get an announcement for Magia Record after the broadcast is over. That or the new project. https://twitter.com/madoka_magica/status/1134384018655498240

Yeah
Well it seems like I have hit a dead end on what to watch.
