AoT spoilers above by the way, in case anyone's like me and clicks spoiler text reflexively
Anyway not much point in continuing this argument/discussion. Thanks for your time
||It's always the smallest hitches that stop me from enjoying massively popular things and then I enjoy them even less because I start feeling like I'm being left out.||
||In that version of events she'd free the slaves and they'd live in the village with her as basically their god||
||Well at that point what you're saying is obvious. I mean when she first transformed. When she was literally being hunted down. I really have to wonder how that interaction went.||
||I get what you mean, but narratively it's like an unfired Chekhov's gun to me. If it's more effort to stay a slave than to free yourself and your people I feel I need a very good justification as to why you'd choose the former. And that's something a relatively short silent flashback can't show. Though something as little as her smiling with her baby would've been enough for me||
||I did a very brief search online and the definition seems to stay at "Victims developing positive feelings towards their captors"||
||Literally one scene of her smiling would've explained that||
||You said it's implied to be stockholm syndrome. I'd say jack shit is implied. What, from that one scene of her looking at him getting married? Logically her deluding herself into being happy about her situation should be shown if she really was doing all that because of stockholm syndrome, but that would interrupt the misery train||
||The writer has decided there's going to be suffering despite all logic, shit pisses me off.||
||Okay manufactured drama it is. I was afraid that would've been it. Ugh...||
||Why didn't Ymir just kill the king? Like, one would expect her to seek revenge. Was it the magic centipede thing? If so why did Eren's peptalk free her? Was it just that she was used to being a slave and obeying him?||
Should I use spoiler text or just DM you?
Yeah me too
Anyone caught up with Attack on Titan? I just caught up today and something very spoiler-y is confusing me
