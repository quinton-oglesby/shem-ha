***CLONK***
I don't want people knowing what servers I'm in.
Works for me!
<@127644949884698624> <@102691114762371072> Can I have an unofficial "queen of ice skating/queen of the ice rink" role?
~~rip mel~~
üëç
I need a "Color Me Serena" role.
Okay.
Not this server.
I've already blocked the user and reported it to discord but it never hurts to be safe.
Received one myself.
So, it might be time to up the security on the server again.  There's a new scam going around discord, from a guy "offering" to teach DM recipients how to phish or something like that.
Mostly younger kids who don't know better.
<#336297674707828747> 
<#336297808221044736> 
<#336298587745157120>
I promise to keep my mouth shut as far as spoilers go.
Simply put, you be nice to me and I'll be nice to you.
I'm quite polite, but I have some fairly frustrating tendencies to speak my mind.
Anyways, I mostly spam artwork.  Just ask Alice.
I finally got fed up with the other server and jumped ship.
~~I'm listed under everyone except Tsubasa and I think Maria.~~
Hello hello!
Hello new player!
Hello~!
About time he showed up.
This one actually has an avatar.
Another bot?
Late to the party, it was a bot.
Good afternoon and welcome to the show!
A new player has logged in!
Name rings a bell, but that bell is in an empty belfry.
I know what to do
Those already happened.
Nah.
Ooh, nice.
Hello!
Hello, new person!
It's recently occurred to me that if the new members don't reply to our greetings, we look like we're greeting each other.
Hello hello!
Good evening!
You've come to the right place!
May your stay be long and enjoyable.
How goes it!
How goes?
I spy a touhou fan.
Oh dear.
How goes!
Welcome to the show!
I see Seele.
Hello new player!
Hello, new player!
With gargantuan amounts of fanart to share.
*I'm back!*
Hello new player!
Hello new person!
Welcome!
An international player?
Hello hello!
Then welcome *back* to the show.
Welcome to the show!
Hello, new player!
Lol.
Hello, new player!
Welcome to the show!
Yep.
Ultimate Apocalypse?
A Countess.  Welcome to the show!
Usually quite accepting.
Hello new player!
~~Who am I kidding.  Of course like the flower!~~  Welcome to the show!
Lotus like the car or like the flower?
Hello!
Welcome, new player!
Your name seems familiar but at the same time, welcome to the show!
Hello new players!
"***I AM CAPTAIN YARRFACE AND I AM BACK!***"
You've got a Nero desktop background, but no Nero figure?
For real, though.
<@81815015224516608> gib umu
Ah, alright.
Want a private preview of part 2?
<@99695384296701952> I went ahead and decided against the YT route.
aaaanyway,
This is important only insofar as it applies to your "character", Alexis, which decides the activity she's in.  Ping or DM your response because I'm probably gonna be asleep when you see these.
<@184766091363352576> Swimming or figure skating?
I mean, she introduced herself by name and gave instructions on where to find her.
Secret identities aren't really a thing, either.
Everyone at her rink already knows she's Frostbite.
If that rhyme ended up on YT, how do you think she'd react?
Lol.
Like, embarrassment.
Not suffering, bullying.
<@99695384296701952> Am I allowed to bully my own magical girl?
Is it working?
I'm trying to characterize Jessika as "passionate, but tactically stupid".
Yeah.
The worst part is that rhyme is forever linked to her transformation.
Lol.
~~Tell me your favorite part.~~
100% original.
Also: If you upload the file to drive, you'll be able to read it.
Let me know what you think.
I checked with Alice, she suggested here.
Something I've recently started working on.  I'll be publishing it through a blog as soon as I have artwork and another chapter or two.
It's difficult to imagedump on phone.
I've got lots of it.
Well prepare to be spammed by figure skater art.
OOPS!
Initially misread this as a figure skating channel.
~~Was it that bland?~~
Which works, I suppose.
So I'm assuming nobody read the fic :V
Did you read?
Really?
https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10374580/1/On-the-Ice-Marisa-Kirisame-and-Alice-Margatroid <@284390402210136064> Closest I've got.
Would you like me to DM all of them?
~~Did you save all those fallen ice skaters I posted?~~
Also, what's up, Red?
>Cuteness ensues.
>Turns out she's never even seen a figure skating competition on TV.
>Turns out she's never worn ice skates before.
>Dresses up as a figure skater for promotional photoshoot.
>Turns out she's never been ice skating before.
But Chris can't skate.
*If there was a figure skater fig of any of the girls, I would sell everything I've got for it.*
But that shelf in <#337805317276565525> is probably where I'd put them.
I have no figures.
"Comes completely disassembled" is still "some assembly required" :V
I'm not quite sure how to interpret total.
If "some aseembly required" is a thing, I'm not actually going to invest.
Models, figures, whatever :V
~~I still don't have an interest on figures.~~
Rip bread
I'd like them to fill a full page.
Actually they only fill about half, maybe 3/4 of the page?
They only fill a page with the profiles and summaries.
I still feel they're incomplete.
Any suggestions?

I'm wanting to add more to these profiles and make them look more in-depth, but I dunno what to add.
Intriguing.
And here's a semi-in-depth profile of Annaliece.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jgP5sAdlQwQUjHvqMBWsc3K2iM2foZ4tBQbeXv0v5MA/edit?usp=sharing Here's the rest of the list.
So, Lat, if you're interested, here's half the list.
So, what do you guys think of this line: "Young lady, you're a *magical girl*.  Your armor is formed from magic.  There is no reason to shirk on protection simply because *you want to look cool.*"
Ah, Scrmz, have you been well enough to read?
I haven't really done much with fanfiction in recent years, besides beta reading and offering ideas.
It's an older piece.
https://archiveofourown.org/works/15677970 I put something on Ao3, in an effort to see what works and what doesn't.
Lol.
Have you had your opportunity to read yet?
Hey scrmz!
If a technologicical discrepancy is the only thing that you get hung up on, then I'm gonna take that as meaning you enjoyed the rest.
There's really no such thing as a "flawless" story.
Whether or not the solution is satisfactory ultimately doesn't matter, either.
It's not really important to the story, but I'll probably end up worldbuilding a solution into play.
The specific reasoning for Paladin hasn't been explained in story yet.
Because that would cause an overload.
It's specifically noted that most mechs can't handle a particle lance as strong as the one used in story.
Actually, that's wrong on my part.
It's specifically noted in story that most CombiMechs require those external generators because otherwise they'd overload.
What's to say those selfsame warp systems aren't also powered by ridiculously sized generators?
Actually, <@99695384296701952>, funny you should mention the video game similarities.  The teleport sequence was inspired by Paragon's RTB animation.
Anyway, yeah.  Feedback, please.
That's why the address.
Point of fact: this story was meant to be published.
I trust you guys :V
Oh well.
Oh right, yeah, that's the mailable version lol.
How would you feel if Merlin was a lady?
Hey, fellas?
A new writing for EC popped into my head while watching Wrinkle in Time.  Anyone interested can say so and I'll ping you if I up it.
Yeah, I've been flopping between the two without realizing it.
Lol.
Cleaned up some redundancies.
Lol.
Comes with being an ageless and immortal sorceress.
Morgan takes *everything* in stride.
There's so many comedy scenes I have in mind for Mdme LeFay.
we've now come full circle?
You realize,
Lol.
Though I do see a sentence or two I can do without.
*She sees cool thing and she wants to do it.*
She's impressionable.
She's 15.
Wobbles.
I have a very "dry" writing style.
~~Excalibur's Chosen is destined to be King/Queen.~~
It hasn't come up in story yet, but I've been plotting it in worldbuilding.
Morgan le Fay is.
Actually.
He's not the one doing the chastising.
Greaves and shin guards.
<@!154722817412300800>
Wobbles, typos everywhere.
As far as she knows, being a Knight mostly involves some cool armor and a cool sword.
She wants to be a Knight without 100% realizing what a Knight actually is.
The armor bit for Frostbite comes from her admiration of Pellinore.
I'm 100% not a fan of the "Butch Lesbian" route, so I probably won't be doing much with "armor and swords magical girls".
From her transformation sequence: "On her head, a diamond tiara (her least favorite accessory; she would‚Äôve much preferred a hair bow or hair band)."
I'm about 70% sure Frostbite mentions not liking some aspects of her outfit.
Come to think of it, Lat, have you read the first chapter of Excalibur's Chosen?
***__NO.__***
Since Frostbite is 15, her view on armor is a little bit skewed.
But since she's creating the "knightly" suit of armor herself, she gets to design it herself.
In the case of Frostbite's base outfit, she doesn't pick the design, no.
Although context in this line is Frostbite deciding "I wanna be a knight, too!" and then creating armor that's missing most of the pieces.
Depends on the writer.
What if the "why" boils down to "Morgan le Fay watched some magical girl anime and liked it"?
That is, what the girls were supposed to be fighting against.
So, for a while I've been wondering why Morgan le Fay instituted her magical girls program.
Is that a comment on the story or a comment on yourself?
Lol.
That's the point behind the challenge.
Any other thoughts?
For those from the Outer Colonies on the edge of Xeraxian space.
I liked coining "fringeworlder"
The perspective character is biased.
Lol.
I had originally been under the impression that this as supposed to be for class, but a conversation with the professor revealed otherwise.  I'm still doing the challenge (a first-person story that's not about the perspective character) but I'd like some thoughts about it so far.
Shigure.
shiggy
Selfless to a fault.
Annaliece is probably the nicest girl you'll *ever* meet.
pfft
I haven't done the other three quite yet.
That's only half of them.
<@!154722817412300800>
Also, the other two because it's been some time and I don't remember whether or not I've shared them.



New profile written up for Frost Sirens.
WOBBLES
WOBBLEEEEEEEESS
~~I am phenomenally tempted to make a sunlight-themed magical girl named Sunburn.~~

Not particularly, no, but the "archmagus' is turning out particularly snide.
In story text, not dialogue.
Is that acceptable as long as the reader knows who's who?
I'm interchangeably using the real names and call signs.
I figured.
3001?
Alright.
How about insurance forms?
The bureaucratic section was getting a little long.
How about NDAs?
~~<@99695384296701952> do you find it believable that people with the capability of interstellar travel still use paper for contracts and agreements?~~
It was a joke that didn't get written.
I dunno.
An "autograph sheet" has autographs from the whole group.
An "autograph" is from one person.
Something to frame.
Y/N?
"NDAs, insurance forms, and an autograph sheet"
There is a *lot* of bureaucracy happening at the spot I'm currently writing.
Out of 275.
I've got almost 250 words of pure dialogue lol.
That's the title, mind.
Also, your thoughts on the font and size differences used?
preview of what's to come.
New idea for a short story.  Will share once it's written.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ij_XnSV670IvGTwbd7TIyx9l1abjhqRQpkv9ShfCIUM/edit?usp=drivesdk
<@273256087107403777> Knights were mentioned, so this happened.
Nice pun.
"Ciryes"?
I neglected to put that information earlier in the story.
NO
KRIISA
Guess not.
"xone"?
Was that intentional?
Semi-related, I think Squall finding comfort/calming aspects in different parts of her Glider's startup sequence will become a regular thing.
"In the past five months since the battle over Elyssia, the only action she‚Äôd seen besides training was Harpy Squadron leading an attack against the very same pirates that had attacked the colony."  I don't think I need the "very same" qualifier.
"In the past five months since the battle over Elyssia, the only action she‚Äôd seen was training, mock battles, and Harpy Squadron leading an attack against the very same pirates that had attacked the colony."
Added "mock battles" between training and the pirate attack.
Or is it too long?
Is five months not long enough?
You mean parameters?
Prior to her release, though.
Yes, that was the inspiration for the ARMC :V
Anything you *liked*?
Anything else that stands out?
Fix'd
<@!154722817412300800> Pronunciation guide: "Caedaen" is pronounced "Kayden".
I assume it has something to do with traffic lights, though.
I have no idea what that little toy is and thus have no answer to the question.
<@!154722817412300800>
Here's the first four pages.
Need to get to class.
I'll share a preview in a bit.
4.5 pages, 850 words.
I'm just bout to hit page 4.
And I'm already working on the justification for it in my head.
I went with Dancer.
Lol.
I need a callsign for Harpy 5.
Wrote some more.  Not much, though.
Computer is on its last legs and I need to close Discord.
Anything else?
Yeah.
I mean helmet cams as attached or built in to the pilot's helmet.
I don't mean helmet cams as showing the face of the pilot.
Yeah, not that.
Doubtful, though.
Helmet cams.
Maybe even a third feed.
Drunken Wobbles.
Cameras for the controls and the instrumentation.
Not face cams.
Starfighters.
No.
Maybe also cockpit cams.
Yeah.
Gun cams.
NO
~~Which brings to mind an unrelated question about the camera systems on the Gliders.~~
But yes, everything is being recorded.
Ah.
CGDCT?
Lol.
~~Every character mentioned so far is a lady, except the ARMC test pilots because they haven't had screen time.~~
Lady*
The speaker is a representative of ARMC.
‚ÄúAs mentioned during the briefing, the test will be executed like an interception, with the Archangels first intercepting the Virtues and then vice versa."
Does Vivio even have any figures?
Not the greatest, but definitely up there.
Nanoha is an OK series.
Should I enforce character loyalty and get a Noire figure as my first or go with cheap cheap cheep and get a pre-owned Vivio?
Hmm.
Pre-owned Teen Vivio.
~~ballet shoes best aesthetic~~
Yeah, true.
Also, the emblems.  I especially want opinions on those.
Lol.
~~You get three guesses for my mental image of her emblem and the first two don't count.~~
Or so I've been told.
That's how real callsigns happen.
I've made some minor adjustments and added the last Harpy.  Tell me what you think.
I like the shade that leans towards an incredibly light blue.
Vivio.
~~Silver hair is my weakness.~~
https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=FIG-MOE-1727-R
https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=CARD-00005926 want
I'm also aware how bad it is.
I've heard of the latter.
Also probably the closest to being finished.
Longest short story yet.
8 pages and 1500 words.
How cheesy is the following slogan: "Why settle for rapid fire when you can have *QuikFire*!"
Hey fellas.
The more eyes looking at something the better if you ask me.
Some folks may catch what you might not have caught.
Wanting more opinions, though.
Yeah.
So, no feedback?
It's 8 pages.
Ah warning.
Almost done.  Tell me what you think.
https://twitter.com/Wolfsbane706/status/1046880900636598272?s=19
~~Never mind that I among others haven't seen the latest XV ep yet.~~
Wouldn't this be better suited for <#357682999300718592>?
üëç
What do you think?
A couple unaasigned ones include "Excalibur's Chosen Hires a Dragon" and "Excalibur's Chosen Meets Madam Merlin".
For chapter 2, something like "Excalibur's Chosen Gets Lost" or something like that.
So, I'm thinking of a naming scheme for the chapters in Excalibur's Chosen and I think I'll do something silly and use the title of the book in the titles of the chapters.  I.E for Chapter 1, it'd probably be "Excalibur's Chosen Fights a Knight"
It took me 20 hours to spot that typo.
||~~Someone has to guard Camelot's vaults.~~||
Makes sense.
The dragons in the verse I'm working on are more like agents for themselves than any faction.  They're greedy, not ideological, if that makes sense.
Expect to be reading it this time next year.
I'm gonna be writing a short story around this.
"I have to tame a dragon?!  What do you mean I have to tame a dragon?!"
"Not tame.  Hire.  There's a difference.  You don't tame a Dragon.  They're far too smart for that.  Drakes, you can tame.  Wyverns, too.  Dragons, they have to be convinced, and the easiest way to convince a Dragon is to pay them."
That is, the way I'm setting something up, dragons in that 'verse aren't tamed.  They're *hired* for whatever purpose you need them for.
How do you guys feel about an intelligent dragon hiring out its services?
So, question, regarding dragons and concepts and such.
Also, some dialogue I just came up with:
"Full name, please."
"Jessika Montjacque."
"*Full* name, please."
"..."
"Jessika, your full name, please."
"Fine.  Jessika Eleanor Montjacque."
Since she has to pick a Round Table anyway.
I'm thinking of expanding "Knight Mode" beyond just Jessika.
Just something small.  Not a story, but a worldbuilding document.

It's an anthology.  Each chapter is a separate short story.
https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3338097/1/Harpy-Squadron-Anthology Only two finished short stories.  But there's like 4 more in the works.
https://m.fictionpress.com/s/3328523/1/Excalibur-s-Chosen Chapter 2 coming soon.tm
Outlines bug me.
I'm a very freeform person.
~~I played with Legos when I was a kid.~~
I don't enjoy kits, personally.  I'd rather just take a bunch of parts and see what I can put together.
~~And a lot more interesting to boot.~~
40k, Sigmar, WarMachine, any one of those is considerably more expensive than Gunpla.
~~At least Gunplas are easier to paint.~~
Minis are way more expensive.
Yeah.
Someone once tried to argue that Gunpla is more expensive than miniatures.
Most of my writing is based around something I call the "Fleetverse"
I never came up with an official justification for the name "CombiMech"
Lol.
I called em CombiMechs in the story.
Maybe you'd like some of the "designs" and names I gave the mechs.
I'm not too good at the genre.
I *was* writing a mecha story, but I ditched it.
He's attending the same school the guy once attended.
He didn't.
I say this because "fanart" implies that whoever's doing the art is a fan of my work.
I'd have to comission something to get artwork done of something I've written, and it wouldn't really be fanart anymore.
At least, it's impossible that someone will do it because they like my stuff.
Only, I don't think that's possible.
So, my goal is to eventually see someone make fanart for something I've written.
Sort of.
It exists.
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000PBLNR8/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_vSsmDbPAKPPHC
Lol.
And it's *never* coming out.
If I get yelled at, it's going in the trash.
I'm giving this story *one* shot.
So, in the end, I decided to break figure skating.
That didn't work.
So I tried to adapt the rules.
But the story, the way I wanted to write it, was going to be *entirely* unrealistic.
I had help.
No way in hell is this story *ever* gonna see the light of day.
In order to make the story work, I had to break figure skating.
*This is absolutely sucking.*
*This is gonna suck.*
Because the real one doesn't fit the story I want to write.
I might just end up creating my own figure skating testing system.
The difference between my original works and the Harpy Squadron shorts is like night and day.

~~That does indeed complicate things.~~
The sentiment is what counts, maybe.
Yeah, true.
~~Manufacture date?~~
"Were never born" lol.
That's why I haven't done it yet lol.
Yeah.
I just realized: not even my own characters share my birthday lol.
I butchered Arthurian mythology for that setting.
https://harpysix.tumblr.com/post/630651472640688128/merlin <@!740195087895756820> I dunno if an adapted public domain character counts as "OC" but this is probably the most powerful character I've got in my various OC universes.
https://harpysix.tumblr.com/post/637332461260619776/jessika-frostbite-montjacque-updated The one that started it all.

One of my many many OCs.
https://harpysix.tumblr.com/post/637332461260619776/jessika-frostbite-montjacque-updated
Picking this up next week when I get paid.
Fun times.
So basically, Shenanigans is the name of the game?
Which it's hard to create a fictional measurement system that's believable lol.
Except for measurements.
With pretty much no references to real world stuff.
Same with Harpy Squadron's setting, although that's almost entirely fictional.
It's based off reality a bit but the city and surrounding area are fictional.
The world of Excalibur's Chosen is one of my own design sort of.
Not keeping the Marines but the Necrons are going to be my way to start.
Necrons!
https://m.fictionpress.com/s/3328523/1/Excalibur-s-Chosen I wrote this and would like opinions.

https://harpysix.tumblr.com/post/616707413881520128/jeremiah-pellinore-kayne ~~Because I am an utterly insecure ass.~~
Also, an OC profile above for you to peruse, judge, and think about if you're interested.
https://harpysix.tumblr.com/post/641254274924429312/tabitha-sapphire-rodriguez-harpy-three Harpy Squadron has six total members and this is the third.
~~Please tell me their last name isn't "Estacado".~~
Lol.
Say Loris, what's today's date?
~~I don't.~~
While one is more swordlike than the other, the color schemes and big red circle are very (unintentionally) evocative.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_(video_game)
That sword looks like the one from Transistor.
Need to balance quality with price.
Yeah true.  That's tricky though.  And expensive.
*One of these days.*
One of these days I'll have fanart of my characters and my settings.
https://www.deviantart.com/wolfsbane7-0-6/art/Champions-of-the-CMBL-Angela-Christie-726537446
I wrote this a long time ago and never wrote a chapter 2.  Tell me what you all think ~~and also tell me what gender you think the narrator is.~~
~~I maintain that it reminds me of the Transistor sword.~~
Also yeah that sword looks weird.
Wouldn't this be <#357682999300718592> anyway?
I'm gonna side with this option for a mo because I like having detailed readouts.
My gripes with AO3 are hefty and justified but at the same time it's been so long since I read fanfic with any regularity it doesn't really matter lol.
Define "large".  Are we talking limousine, SUV, Hummer, or full-on 18-wheeler?
Cuz your character is cat.
The funny part is the two sets of ears :V
Whipping up something new.  Still in concept stages.
So, the characters by and large are unimportant as are the circumstances.  All I'm really trying to get input on is the concept of hiring a dragon and some of the terminology involved.
I did an incomplete thing.
The brown one, iirc.
My first Bionicle kit was one of the Rahkshi.
hallo, Bionicle fan since childhood here.
I'm writing again!  <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>

If you don't wanna open the link, the basic idea is "figure skating meets cosmic horror".  The protagonist's home rink is built on top of a "pan-dimensional nexus".  This leads to the usual cthulu-esque things showing up then disappearing infrequently as the borders between dimensions start to erode/wane/thin/whatever.  Things can go both ways though and eventually this happens to the protagonist.  I basically ended the prompt there with a standard "was it real or imagined" line.
I don't remember the rule on original creations.
Can I put non fanwork stuff in here?
Anyway, I just wanted to share that with everyone since it popped across my feed.

Time to break Shirabe.

I think I'll just get someone else to do the conversion for me.
But my only other option only has 4gb memory.
Yeah.
I was trying to do conversion on a computer with only 2gb memory.

It's a crossover.
Yeah.
That's Dorulumon.

Shirabe looks a bit uncomfortable lol.





It's the twins!  From Bronya's perspective.

Not named yet though.
Augment Core Valkyrie Ranger.
Also a Bushiroad game.
Yeah
He's the MC of the Vanguard anime but not the game itself.
Aichi is his name.
Besides, it's a Chinese gacha game.  I ain't gotta explain a damn thing <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Who?
Hockey isn't my thing but if there's a figure skater or two mixed in I don't mind watching just for them.
Yeah.
After checking the details, though, waiting time is 3 months+ so I'm gonna try and commission someone else.
So as it turns out, the reason my commission got cancelled was because I didn't check the details before issuing it.
May have to request from an R-18 artist.
I think so though.
I dunno.  My only attempt so far got rejected.
Just have to overcome the language barrier.

After about a minute Reno's character releases the rope to smack and kill the mouse but in the process nearly drops Ethan on the floor and almost sets off the sound detection system to boot.
Then who should come by but a stray mouse.
Jean Reno's character was the one holding up Hunt to keep him from touching the floor and setting off the alarms.
Actually, if you remember the context for the scene in #1, it becomes a lot funnier.
All I could remember was the setting and someone getting kicked out a window.

I forgot her name.

So as it turns out, Bocchi the Maid is *pretty popular*.



Also, she's got her boot size on the heel of the skate.
Nice details like that are always a pleasant surprise.
For figure skating blades.
It's a brand name.
Go google that real quick to find why it's such a cool detail.
That's the surprise.
Just under the front mount.
The blade.
And screenshot what you find.
Also, zoom in on her skate blade as much as you can.

YURI.




~~I just want that clip of Kirika skating into battle.~~
From the opening PV.
Does anyone have a gif of Kirika skating into battle?
9:48 AM
Midsummer?  I thought this was set during winter.
Do it Dalek style.
This should come as no surprise to anyone who knows me but I *really* want this season's opening concert to be on ice.
*I must know.*  What's the opening concert like?
Waiting for subs.
||It's like half a second long *but I still want that shot of Kirika skating into battle!*||
That was certainly a spectacle.
||Realistic skate noises.  Always a win.||
||And of course the scene I've been wanting a gif of so badly is in ep 1!||
~~I've got a friend who gives me codes in exchange for copious amounts of yuri.~~
For two days.
I have premium too.
Well no.
Spoilers are fine as long as you spoiler tag them.  ||like so.||
Oh.
Did they skip it for XV?
The concert that's at the start of the season.
The opening concert that every season so far has had.
Deluge.
||This is pretty much confirmation that Miku will never have a gear again as far as the anime is concerned.||
***SPOILERS!***
SPOILERS!
||Still no shot of Kirika skating into battle <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>||
I think there's elements of the transformations from all 4 seasons in there.
I don't think it was just a callback to S1.
Is it bad that I don't particularly care or want to know?
Referencing her gear.
I thought it was more of a callback.
So many people extracting scenes and nobody's grabbing the ones I want lol.
~~I must be the only one who saw it as a callback.~~
She was skating lol.
SHE WAS.
I'm getting impatient lol.
Just that shot of Kirika skating into battle.
I require Kirika.
Kirika.
I actually like her exam song better.
If you say so.
It was slightly longer in the PV though.
Yes, that's it.
If it ever loads.
*it wasn't long enough.*
I want more skating.
Realistic skate noises!
I still say that's a blatant callback to SSJ.
Now i just need to figure out how to crop it down to just Kirika and I'm set.
It's perfect!
I say this because in pairs skating, it's always the man that lifts the woman.
In the skating battle.
Kirika lifting Shirabe, that is.
<@284390402210136064> Knowing what I do about figure skating, *that basically cements Kirika as the dominant one in my mind*.
The teacher dodged.
She didn't miss.
EVA: 150
If Shirabe's transformation doesn't include figure skating moves I'm gonna riot.
Cags is pure sexy times.
Why aren't you using an adblocker?
It's *great*.
Next Saturday.
Lol.
~~I'm writing my own magical girl story.  Sort of.~~
They say if you can't find something you like, make one of your own.  Or something along those lines.
She's just a smidge shorter than Kirika.
I personally use nyaa.
You're fine.
Torrent gets thrown around all the time.
Yeah, those are annoying.
Shirabe is kinda "underdeveloped"
Maria needs her own series.
It's always annoyed me that Hibiki doesn't actually use a spear with her Gungnir.
~~I'm dead broke.~~
Lol.
In vlc they work fine.
On my tv, that is.
Except mkv files don't load subtitles.
That's how I do it.
Stick them on a flash drive, plug in the flash drive, watch vids.
My computers aren't all that great.
That doesn't really work very well.
Wanting to watch on my TV.
Nah.
Yeah.
The videos.
But don't wanna go through the hassle of conversion.
I need to watch the Zesshoushinais.
~~Like, unless S.O.N.G. has a really good pairs coach lying around, there's no way they can do that lift ungeared.~~
Lol.
It's the lift that's probably the gear augmenting skills.
The scene where they're skating next to Hibiki is pretty basic, even the peel off.
I'd be willing to bet it's the gears doing most of the actual skating.
I got my ice skating fix for the season in ep1.
Real world politics in fiction always puts a damper on it for me.
It's just a throwaway scene.
Frankly I don't care.
Moe, Larry, and Curly come back from the grave to show the gears how it's done.
||~~RIP The Three Stooges.~~||
It was unintentional, wasn't it?
Please tell me that reference was intentional.
Climax and denouement.
~~All of the RWBY games suck.~~

Kanade just disapprovingly looking up at Genjuro and asking "How are you going to fix this?"
Do you think Kanade ever saw Tsubasa's bedroom?
~~Foreshadowing is lost on me.~~

So, a death just for the sake of bookends with no narrative significance?

She's getting abducted.
She's not dying.

RIP Bikki.
Lol.
Lol.
"It's summer in the southern hemisphere" lol.
Like, what could be so ridiculous that Kirika puts on that face of sheer "WTF?!"
I think it'd be funny if it turns out to be one of the other gears.
Kirika's face in that XV preview makes me think she's about to get hit by something.
XV ep2 here I come!
I can't be the only one who spotted that shout-out.
The *Thomas Whitmore* is named for the president from Independence Day.
US carriers take their names from former presidents.
Kanako did his research on carrier naming schemes and did a shout out.
The USS *Thomas Whitmore*.
The carrier at the start of ep2.
Named for Bill Pullman's character.
That carrier?
Not joking.
Kanako is a fan of Independence Day.
Did you know?
Anyway I'm going back to watching so I don't spoil myself too much.
Still kinda in awe over the Independence Day shout out.
There's ep2 done.
I'll be 52.
Nope.
I'll be 53.
January 2045?
Let's see.
Ryoko is 11 next year.
Cags is pure sexytimes.
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
~~Determination to Fist.~~
Didn't that kid die?
I don't think that corpse was a dude.
Just hit the mute button.
Anyone got a TV remote?
Kirika and Shirabe are definitely going all-out on the figure skating and ballet.
~~THAT CARRIER!~~
~~Can't post about it either cuz no social media.~~
I spotted an unexpected shout-out in the first half of the episode but nobody really cares :V
*Really* good movie.
Equilibrium.
üëÜ üëÜ üëÜ üëÜ üëÜ üëÜ
I think the 100,000 was an estimate and not a literal headcount.
~~Nominate Saint Germain for owner of longest killstreak.~~
~~Well obviously not the same venue.~~
It would've been the best.
But I am *intensely* disappointed it wasn't on ice.
I knew it wasn't ever gonna happen,
Speaking of the concert,
~~Also the original movie's timeline is only like a day or two.~~
Independence Day predates the Relic program.
Nah.
~~Not unless Roland Emmerich suddenly became a Symphogear fan when we weren't looking.~~
Which means at one point in time, Symphogear's USA had a Pres. Thomas Whitmore.
The US names their carriers after former presidents.
It's not too hard to spot if you know how American carriers are named.
Unfortunately, nobody actually cares about the shout-out.
<@239527945142534145> I've been telling people about that all night :V
We saw Kanade die on screen.
Ah.
Whatever happened to Durandal?
We need backstory for Kirika.

<@189146272865845248> ~~||me||~~

It's been two eps.
Solo, chill a bit.
Solo, play nice.
"This is already well-known among your core fanbase!"  I'll bet $5 Maria snitched.

I just wanna see something somewhere go against the grain and just *shatter* that pride.
Lol.
~~At least I can still post in other servers.~~
I need them to implement that feature on mobile already lol.
Yep.
The day I can post those in <#336297674707828747> will be a happy day.

I kinda like the low-energy feel of it.
Hibiki is not allowed to be sad.
~~Mini Maria.~~
She kinda looks like Maria.

Maybe it's *Maria* who sneezes.
~~Yeah but "sneeze" is a keyword which makes me think it's more than just one sneeze.~~
No?
In other words, Chris caught a cold.
<@431656503490117632>
I don't remember that.

But from Genjuro's perspective, *this little girl just screamed for no damn reason*.
Because from Miku's perspective, she just realized she publicly confessed her possessiveness over Hibiki.
Of the ones I've seen, the one where Miku is thinking about the Shenshoujing fight is probably the funniest.
~~To be fair, Elfnein is androgynous.~~
Lol.
pfft
~~That bit alone had me doubting the canonicity of the Zesshoushinais.~~
Maria's only an idol for the catering.
Oh yeah, almost forgot a very important thing:
The "how are you planning to fix this" one?
Where's that comic with Kanade, Genjuro, and Tsubasa?
This is hilarious.
And she is *fully* aware of confessing under the influence of Shenshoujing.
If the Zesshoushinais are 100% canon, then that means somewhere floating around, Miku has an entire photo album of photos of Hibiki in a bikinim
So wait.
I never got around to downloading all the Zesshoushinais.
So by sharing Virtue in its various stages, I get coins?

~~Ni No Kuni 2 is Isekai.~~
That's not exactly what I meant.
Oh.
Not anon.
Me, that is.
A little slow on the uptake.
So what answered the "new skater" question exactly?
Lol.
Oh.
Gender-neutral clothing?
Gnc?
Don't leave me in the dark :V
Also, I could finally take lessons without getting shouted at by my parents.
Honestly, my answer would be "yes" only for skating.  When I'm alone on the ice, I tend to let myself loose a lot.  That is, I do things I wouldn't *ever* do in public, like wearing my guards on the ice and intentionally acting like it's my first time (harder than you think).  All this is done under the guise of "this girl is skating for the first time".  Or at least that's the role I try to play.
Button?
I think the best way to describe me would be "genderfluid"?  I dunno.  I mean, I don't think it can really be called as such when the only time I act as a girl is when I'm skating.
That is, I don't know anything about it and I don't think I will.
This is rocket science as far as I'm concerned.
I seriously can't imagine what would happen if I decided to change genders.
Get a really floofy one.
Ibu's wish list keeps getting longer.
If it's any consolation, I skipped straight to tights :V
~~sorry not sorry.~~
Knee-highs stop either just below or just above the knee.
Not necessarily.
Next step is thigh-highs?
Make sense?
And teach.
Someone to protect.
Like, in life, I've always wanted a younger sister.
Which is weird in and of itself when you apply it to the newbie skating.
Innocence is just a desire or something to be the "older brother".
Helplessness is a kink.
I like innocence in a girl.
Newbie ice skating, in my mind, is innocent.
I think the "newbie skater" question is still unanswered, though.
The tutus are something of an added bonus.
Being a girl means I can enjoy those things without fear of getting shouted at because they're girlish interests.
My mom particularly does not like that I enjoy ballet and ice skating.
Chris cosplay?
In terms of clothes.
This is just what I've seen.
Ibu wants:
-A tutu.
-A pair of ice skates.
-Thigh-highs.
-Weird multicolored tights/stockings.
Shall I list the things I've seen Ibu add to her list?
https://danskin.com/collections/tights/products/1331-ultrashimmery-tight These are what I wear on the ice.
Actually, come to think of it, I've never seen Ibu express a want for skates.
Makeup is important for skating.
Lol.
It's only for skating.
While at the same time trying to grow a beard *because dammit, why can't I grow a proper beard?*
I've been trying to grow my hair out for skating.
I don't strictly care where I live as long as there's a nearby body of water that freezes over in winter.
~~That's what I'd do.~~
Skip the stockings part and go full tights.
Go full tights.
I want knee-high ice skates.
Knee-high socks and regular shoes or knee high boots and regular socks?
But I can imagine one day just going nuts and turning a tutu and ice skates into daily house wear.
Yeah.
Lol.
~~*tutu*~~
Sadly no.
Religious zealotry at its finest.
Hell, my parents would probably be racist if it was allowed.
If you're trans, more hate.
If you're gay, you get hate.
There is a *massive* amount of hate in my family.
Kindness goes a long way.
Because the extended family hates my guts for some unknown reason (the feeling is mutual) and the immediate family wants me a brain-dead religious zealot.
Extended or otherwise.
I just want to go somewhere that's far away from wherever my family is.
Aspergers.
I don't necessarily want to go the Atheist route, but I can't in good faith believe in something I haven't seen.
Probably.
The kind of folks who won't take the time to learn about something and instead take it at face value.
The usual "anti-everything" bullshit.
Fundimental.
Nazarene.
Yeah.
Got yelled at for not liking the church we attend and not wanting to attend.
I need an out.
Apparently my family is just a bunch of toxic asses.
I think it would be funny if all the trans folk in the server just moved in with each other, plus me.
And harder to find a skate spot.
Harder to navigate, though.
True.
And also cheaper to live in.
I kinda wanna keep living in a small town because it's easier to keep to myself.
Personality is a big part of attractiveness as well.
Meaning easy ice.
It's one of the coldest states in the country.
Michigan would be alright if it wasn't so far east.
<@!263983345669505025> That was Alice's idea.
Ibu and I share some traits, it seems :V
~~I may have accidentally sparked Ibu's interest in me.~~
Need a passport first.
Wyoming.
Wanna live somewhere cold, but don't wanna go east.
Should I live in Sleepy Hollow?
And I don't speak the language :V
I don't have a passport.
~~I don't even know where I want to live.~~
Or money.
I'd love to move out, but I don't have income.
How's the weather in Wyoming?
Alamosa should be right on your route.
Because small town.
And small.
There *is* an airport, but it's regional.
I think if anyone could be allowed to know where I live, it'd be you guys.
Which is an old habit.
Because I'm not the biggest fan of giving out my city online :V.
*Colorado, you dunce.*
From where you're at now.
I'm about a third of the way down the line.
Thickness, not length.
I'm roughly right smack in the middle of it.
I don't do very well with that level of long-term planning.
I admittedly figured closer to 2-5 years.
But 10-15 years is *quite* a long time.
That's generally my natural state of mind.
And we'll likely have forgotten each other :V
I'll be in my 40s by then.
~~I want to move somewhere close to a skate spot both so I have somewhere to skate and so I can keep my promise to Ibu.~~
I haven't decided where to move yet.
Or at least planning to and wanting to.
I'm the one who's moving :V
Lol.
"I didn't know that was a thing"?
This is one of those that requires consent from the girl.  If I don't have her consent or she gets uncomfortable, I stop.
Yeah.
Depends on the girl.
At minimum, she'll pick out her outfit and all I'll do is dress her.
Like, at full "doll", I pick out her outfit, right down to the underwear, and dress her from there.
There's a variety of different "levels" based on how close we are, what she's into, how comfortable she is with it, etc.
All it is is dressing the girl.
I don't really consider it a full kink, per se, but it's something I've been wanting to do.
Another one that I've never gotten to done is a fetish I call "doll".
I'm not into the ageplay or usage aspects at all, I just like the padding.
The one that might turn some heads is the diaper fetish :V.
Okay, 5!
~~Those come after about 10 minutes.~~
Mostly shivering and arm rubbing for me, personally.
Shivering, teeth chattering, rubbing arms, stuttering, etc.
Basically, the kink is, she's feeling the cold and it shows.
I've posted lots of cold artwork, but people haven't quite put 2 and 2 together.
One that people don't seem to have picked up on is my "cold" kink.
Yeah.
It can be on an icy sidewalk or street or something.
Nah.
That's a little bit cute, too, but I'm not a big fan of rain.
Go ahead.
That's it.
Because the MC's name is Yuri.
Unless they're skating, that is.
It's very difficult to find girls slipping on ice in anime artwork :V
That's one that doesn't really come up often at all.
A heels on ice kind of thing.
There's an extension of that: slipping on ice.
Everyone already knows I find it cute when girls can't skate very well :V
Tutus on ice, etc.
So, everyone knows about the ice skating kink and all the kinda variants.
As in, 'That's a fetish?  I never knew . . . ."
I'd be more than happy to list what I'm into, but no judging :V
Because a guy showing up to skate in the outfit I usually wear alone is gonna turn some heads no matter where I skate.
So people wouldn't recognize me.
Or a rink that I probably wouldn't visit on a regular basis.
Would have to be at a rink I've never been to before, though.
I think, eventually, I want to dress up on the ice in public.
Is it really?
Sometimes I wonder.
You know, they say conflict is healthy.
Now, I think that's everything.  Aside from all the ballet-related stuff, which really just falls under how I dress.
__***NO.***__
K.
Any other questions?
I wouldn't mind that too much, if the dress was to my liking.
Especially considering my prom was some 8 years ago.
Probably not lol.
Probably not.
<@99695384296701952> You missed the part where I mentioned it was just for the padding :V
Although even with someone to do it to, I'd probably still do it myself.
Though that started out of lacking someone else to do it to.
In a lot of cases, yeah.
In the midst of the collar conversation.
I think I explained that.
Ohhh.
Can we get back to why you asked about someone dressing me before a skate?
SIDE TRAAAAAACKED.
oh jeez.
dess
The slipping, the cold, and the diapers are the three I typically apply to skating.
Lol.
I've never considered that, but it might be interesting.
Some of it would lol.
Yes.
Never once have I considered that, and I don't know how to actually respond.
Or initiating the contact myself.
At least, not without giving consent first.
*I don't like to be touched.*
It stuck with me, though, and I've kept my distance from crushes ever since.
And the youth pastor gives me a stern talking to that I must've ignored because I don't remember the details.
Literally all I'd done was put my arm around her shoulders because she was cold.
Growing up, I was taught that showing affection to a girl I liked was bad.
Other times it's just another addiction.
Sometimes religion can be a good stabilizer.
My aunt and uncle, I'm sad to say, are intensely controlling.
These are the same people who enrolled their kids in a school the mother taught at.
I dunno whether they red flagged it because of the skin packs or because the kid's mother lets him play the game.
Back in the olden days.
And for more zealous, to boot.
My aunt and uncle are far more religious than my parents are.
I have Minecraft on XB1, PS4, and mobile.  I don't have any skin pack on any platform.
Really.
They visited once, with their grandson and wouldn't let him play Minecraft just because the Chinese Mythology skin pack exists, despite the fact that I don't own said skin pack.
For all I complain about my parents being religious, my aunt and uncle are far far worse.
Then I think, at that point, it becomes a gauge of "how much is too much"?
*I need a win.*
I'm kind of in a funk right now.
Tonight has not been a good night.
We can only dream.
What will *really* never happen is all of us doing it together.
Similarly, everyone recognizes that the Skating Class is mainly just a flight of fancy that realistically will never happen?
It's long enough that I genuinely wouldn't blame Ibu or myself for forgetting about it somewhere down the line.
This has been on my mind since I made the promise, but 10 years is a *really* long time.
Decarion.
Yukine?
Steal one from a favorite character?
Anyone wants to know my name, it's right there on my Twitter.
I don't know anyone's real name save a few people who shared it publicly lol.
I'm really creative with character names, but not so much with real names.
My last name is uncommon, but not exactly rare.
Stimulation?
May have something to do with letting my guard down.
I don't wanna try and explain it.
You know what I'm saying, right?
Just as an aside, I always feel so lonely when I'm skating in public.
Not necessarily a roadblock, but a restriction on where I end up.
Which brings me to #4: I'm really wanting to move to a town that has access to both natural ice and an ice rink, for obvious reasons.
Assuming the town I'm moving to is big enough.
No roommates or anything.
What I mean is, wherever I end up, I'm gonna be on my own.
#3: I don't know anyone.
#2: I'm dead broke without a job in a small town.
#1: I don't know where it is I'm gonna go.
There's several roadblocks though.
So, I want to move out of this house and live somewhere that's far away from any family members.
How so?
Aloof?
Okay, as far as server antics go, have I ever given off an impression of being a worrywart?
Honest question: do I worry too much?
Kriisa with the megaphone.
Criminy.
Lol.
But good luck regardless.
Not close enough, if you ask me.
As much as I'd like to offer words of encouragement, I don't think what I do counts for this sort of thing.
But when it *does* happen, it piles on thick.
Locally, snow doesn't happen much because surrounded by mountains.
Colorado is a bit of a snowy state.
100%.
There will be snow.
Bit big though.
Pueblo isn't a bad place, speaking on personal experience.
I also don't want to recommend the town I live in for risk of sounding like a creep.
I just know the traffic is horrible.
I can't speak to the living conditions in Denver.
Come to think of it, Colorado doesn't have many major cities.
Just avoid Denver.  Navigation is a nightmare.
Colorado isn't a bad place to live.
Plus, you happen to have a contact in the area who knows where everything is.
If all else fails, Alamosa is a small town with low rental prices and it meets the "cold with snow" criteria.
Okay, for real.
Lol.
You can 100% depend on us to support in a time of need.
Pretty sure she's forgotten about it, but I've gotten a lot more careful in hiding things.
Thankfully she's hard of sight so she wasn't able to see what it was.
My mother accidentally discovered one of my tutus once.
Small towns aren't good for jobs, but I'm gonna try and get an anthology or two published.
Top tier.
The Jobless Revolutionaries!
I need a job in general.

Special thanks to <@!127644949884698624> in particular for helping me figure out the limits and stuff.
And for that I'm grateful.
But none of you did.
I think I was doubly worried about it since the "being a girl only on the ice thing" could have been taken as an insult.
It's just for the most part, my experience has been that people will do a 180 on me if they find out that I skate in a tutu despite being a dude (a girl on the ice).
Yeah, it is.
So, i just wanted to thank you guys in helping me to be more open with my skating and the way I do it.

Because if it does, then I can start setting aside $1000 per semester as a relocation fund.
Same.
So, during the week I got a call about being eligible for student loan forgiveness.  The call cut out before I could learn anything, but I may be able to take advantage of this.
All it does is block legal purchasing when illegal purchasing is already a massive problem in the US.
Because it doesn't work.
Stricter rules, on the other hand, I support.
I am, for the most part, against a total firearms ban.
For one, harsher penalties for improper background checks.
Ah.
That is, I don't understand your comment.
Rephrase, please.  You've confused me.
Mombot's remark in particular is the one I agree with the most.

I'm going to step away from this conversation before I say something I'll regret.
Also, gang culture.
That's rather petty.
In other news, I'm considering minoring in linguistics.
It's like he doesn't believe in silent letters.
These aren't so much a big deal as they are incredibly jarring.
Cuneiform is being pronounced (cu-nay-ih-form).
Enkidu is being pronounced (Ink-idu).
In the slides, Hammurabi is misspelled.
My prof is being a hipster.
Intro to Civ.
That was marred by shitty marketing.
I want to see what they can create.
I 100% want to see those ladies make their own MOBA.  Legitimately, not sarcastic.
How do I hide a tutu like that?
Short of ransacking my room, she'll do her damndest to find out what I'm hiding.
My mom in particular is against me having secrets.
It's not working very well.
I'm trying to set things in motion for my move without letting my parents know.
Woot!
Stereotypes are bad, okay?  Okay.
Not everywhere is the spitting image of a dystopia.
Nope.
So I'll have the pleasure of taking her skating on the weekends, if that's how she wants it.
From me, that is.
Kriisa will be living about 4 hours away.
Mobas in general have that effect on people.
That doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

Interesting.
Zealous extremism tends to come with a tone of moral superiority.
I'd almost be willing to argue that worse than the far right is the religious right.
The puppets themselves don't have orientations, but what about the characters?
It's still there!
https://youtu.be/-tMZK0jUrCM relevant.  Perspective Saki's.
Lol.
I made some adjustments to it.
A couple days ago, someone at the college wrote "You are loved!" on a whiteboard in the library.
There's no way he didn't see it.
It contrasts with the grass and the fence.
Because it looks like that thing was parked relatively out of the way.
Pretty sure if you explain what happened to the rental agency, they'll charge him instead of you.
I think it was either middle school or high school, that a teacher decided to take some 5x7 note cards I'd been using and literally cut them down to 3x5.
Why are teachers so obsessed with note cards being *exactly* 3 inches by 5 inches?
At that point, you call the cops.
Oh.
"Kiri-duo"?
I've come to realize: I've never been kissed by someone I like.
She's a hypocrite.
Development of Civ.
What *really* pisses me off is that everything for this one particular class has to be handwritten.
Nope.
We can take notes but we can't use them.
<@99695384296701952> Yes, I read that story lol.
We're allowed a single 3x5 note card to use on tests.
Any bigger and we get docked.
Note cards have to be 3 inches by 5 inches.
Every class that lets us take notes.
But why 3x5?
I'll never understand the specificity of "3x5 note cards, nothing else!"
Class is scheduled to end at 8:35 usually, but he keeps us til 8:45 because there are breaks so we're not sitting there for 3 hours.
Last night's prof: "I'm gonna let you go early tonight."  And then he proceeds to keep us til 8:50 when classes that late are supposed to end at 8:35.
Writing things by hand is very time consuming.
No, just jarring.
Honestly, one of my classes has us using our phones as part of the class.
He *really* doesn't trust us.
This is the first professor I've had who objects to music listening during tests.
Listening through Amazon?
If he seriously believes I'm listening to something not music, he's a moron.
The phone is literally right in front of me so the prof can see what's going on.
#2.
Elaborate, please.
You'd think that professors wouldn't mind students listening to music during a test, as it blocks out outside influence.
Creative Writing.
Lol.
Because then I can actually give my thoughts on the topic.
I have a preference for questions with "no right answer".
I *really* don't see the relevancy.
Particularly for those with less than stellar handwriting.
Seems counterintuitive to restrict if you ask me.
I've never been on a plane before.
The tech hasn't been made yet.
I've been homeless before because of my extended family.  I will go to great lengths to make sure it doesn't happen again.
And I really don't want them finding out.
But money is somewhat difficult to come by.
This feeling is why I'm doing my best to get out.
Literal.
I feel as though I can't express how I feel about certain subjects without immediately getting kicked out of the house.

Away from anyone who knows me.
I mainly just want to be on my own.
Especially with luggage.
The plane ticket alone is gonna cost a good chunk.
It's all so overwhelming.
Buy a plane ticket, find an apartment, find trasnportation, find a job.
Is it even possible to start a new life on $2,000?
It's a "my vote won't change anything about my life" thing.
It's not a "my vote doesn't matter" thing.
Yes.
There's genuinely nothing to be gained by voting.
Because for the most part, the most it will do is cause some other batch of idiots to start complaining on twitter, reddit, everywhere.
I don't particularly care.
That's the main thing.
No thanks.
I won't be voting, personally.  I want *no* part of *either* side of this.
Basically, yeah.  Aside from the ending where Rich suggests sitting down and having a peaceful dialogue as opposed to accusing a guy of being sexist because he wants to protect his marriage.
Welcome to gaming politics.
Most of it is just explaining things.
That didn't go over so well.
Sarkessian went after Ninja.
Yeah, Rich tends to ramble.

Intriguing.
Clubs get constitutions?
Like, invite the head guy to a showing so he can know what's going on firsthand.
I'm confident you'll be able to clear everything up.

Particularly considering they're mainly *wrong*.
You know, I *really* hate how zealous my parents are about their political beliefs.
That is, sincerity is a big part of whether or not they're just another line.
Sometimes the empty platitudes aren't so empty.
You have no idea how difficult it is for a fledgling author to get a paid publication.
"Character-focused, no simultaneous submissions, if your cover letter isn't exactly right we'll throw your tale in the trash"
So, sci-fi magazines are stuffy fucks.
I did take a new pic last night that sparked this, but I'm not fully comfortable sharing it quite yet.
Or whatever that brand is.
I've got a Schicks razor with a changeable head.
Mainly need it gone for planned videos on the ice in the outfit.
Actually just hair removal in general.
So, suggestions for chest hair removal?
Incremental progress is still progress.
You're a very empathetic person and you don't want to hurt people, even unintentionally.  The worry comes from, I think, a desire for acceptance.  Which is probably wrong on my end.
How do I put this . . . .
Paranoia that nothing you do will matter in the end?
And you tend towards being genuine.
You're a good kid :V.
Nah.
I'm honestly not sure any advice I give would really help.
What's up?

So, here's a valid question: why do people insist on letting things blow up rather than politely explaining to someone that they're being a bother?
I don't want to be anyone's role model.
Is it wrong to not want people looking up to me?
Same.
That's the only time I'd feel brave enough to skate in full crossdress gear.
By "with me" I mean actually on the ice with me, not just vocal support from the bleachers.
Moral support is a big part of my motivation, I guess.
So, *maybe* this is stupid, but if I had someone with me who knows about what I do, I'd 100% skate and crossdress in public.  Maybe with a little apprehension (I'm actually a very nervous person irl) but I'd do it.
https://twitter.com/Wolfsbane706/status/1053091744852537344 Here you go.
Hold, please.
I have an idea, anyway.
~~Yes.~~
Posting that reminds me that I need to post something new for that hashtag.  Thoughts/Suggestions?
https://twitter.com/Wolfsbane706/status/1042925161215713281 I dunno if this will help or not, but I do hope you find a use for the advice.
I think #2.
https://twitter.com/Notchplaysgames/status/1054062767257325569?s=19 PETA has gone off the deep end.  Again.
If this was the 50s, *my parents would be fucking racists*.
That's about as flimsy as it gets.
So, my parents reasoning for all the hate: "Bible says go forth and multiply.  She can't multiply."
Or receiving affection and not pushing it away.
From the sounds of things, it's less that she "came out" and more that she's showing affection to another woman.
Their bigotry is entirely founded upon their religion.
They're religious.
If she didn't already live in Kansas, I'd be willing to bet she'd get kicked out of the house.
My sister, I believe, has come out as either lesbian or bi.  She's 35 years old.  Our parents are *very much* not happy.
So, I'd just like to add on that I always tend to post with expectations of the worst regarding reactions.  You guys, however, are probably the most understanding people on the planet.  I'm grateful.
I'm grateful for the understanding.
I hope that makes sense.
Being carried through a battle or game means I didn't get a chance to contribute and also means I was probably better off not attending at all.
I like being able to contribute because it means I wasn't just sitting there letting everyone else do all the work.
It's a personal thing.
From listening in, I'm fairly sure at least one of the MS2 players has at least one fully maxed character.
I'm working on that with MS2.  My decision to run solo is mainly because if I don't, I'm afraid I'll just get carried and not have a chance to contribute.
Is it really okay to be the outlier?
My interests don't really line up with everyone else's (as near as I can tell, they're mostly unique among the active server members) and I've been told that it's a good thing.  But is it really?
Trying to be part of the group is offensive to the group.  This is the only group where that hasn't been my experience, up til recently.
I am, by nature, a cynical ass, but you guys do, in fact, bring out the best in me.

And not tell them where I'm moving to.
I need money to get out of here.
Not easy when the posers are my own parents.
So apparently, not wanting to go to a far-right church that preaches hate and politics is disrespectful?  What gives?
The trouble with living near farmland is that they have to burn excess.  And that smokey smell drifts into the house, making it a pain to sleep.
Heaven forbid we should lose the right to defend ourselves.
So long as "medicare for all" is affordable and funds hospitals as opposed to funding things not medicine related.
Personally, I'm inclined to disagree with the "assault weappns ban" because that can be defined so many wrong ways, but everything else is heavily desirable.
The only reason I'd support health care being a little bit pricey is if that dosh went towards funding medical research, supplies, and facilities.
I hate not being in control.
I hate college.
I hate Colorado.
2: I am actually held in pretty high regard by the community at the shop.  *I genuinely had no idea this was the case and it warms my heart to learn so.*
1: I am apparently *far* more stressed than I ever realized (which is likely the source of my recent headaches).
I took two main things away from that conversation.
Thankfully wasn't public but did have a talk with the store owner, which was where it happened.
Had something of a breakdown at the card shop tonight.
These aren't the words of someone being "lazy".  These are the words of someone who's gone through the motions for years without any results and has such, *given up*.
Apply in the next town over?
Eventually you just run out of places to put in applications, and if every one gets rejected, what then?
I'd especially like to point out that small towns have significantly less opportunities for people, just by virtue of being small towns.
I just want to punch anyone who claims that getting a job is the easiest thing in the world.
It's not nearly that simple anymore.
My parents are stuck in the 1970s.
Apparently getting a job is as simple as filling out an application and being told "you're hired"?  Not.
My parents are not.
ASU is progressive.
If not tonight, then next week.
We're still on feminism, but we'll be talking about trans, queer, lesbian, etc presumably later tonight.
Tonight in PHIL-201: Feminism, Equity, etc.  This is not a class I will be telling my parents about.
*Why do college students have to get the short end of the stick?*
If I wasn't a student, I'd be getting food stamps monthly.
The only reason I have to work 20 hours a week is because I'm a student.
Because I'm not working 20 hours a week, I didn't receive a deposit.
I applied for food stamps earlier this week.
In other news, I've figured out my sexual orientation.
Just make her a redhead like in the animated movie.
In other other news, I've sort of "come out" as a crossdresser to a figure skating community I joined early this year.  They were *incredibly* accepting and thanks to that I'll be doing a lot more with my skating this winter.
That's all :V
Asexual.
I just wanted to actually specify the orientation.
"You."
Helps that I'm crazy secretive to begin with.
It happens in every community I join, so I just say I like keeping people at arm's length.
It's kinda a looming feeling in general.
I don't think it does multiple words in one go.
Yeah.
It read a little bit like you figured that's the situation I'm in.
I don't quite get it?
Not related to here, but do you ever get the impression that trying to be part of a group is offensive to the group?
Just let me know when I can get back to what I came for.
True enough.
Not frustrated, just disappointed.
Elaborate, if you would be so kind?
It puts a damper on my experience when explicit parallels to real-world issues are brought up in something I'm watching to get away from it all.
As an escape from reality.
For example, anime.
Do you guys consider fiction to be escapism?
I know how that goes.
Whereas I was on leave.
(S)he's new.
Seems so.
If you ever need a good laugh, just look up "sovereign citizens vs the law" on YT.
I deactivated my twitter.
On here.
Because I'd probably get dogpiled if I did.
No comment.
I have to get fitted for anything more.
I mean, the most I wear is tutus and usually just while skating.
Not trans, just a crossdresser.
There's also me.
Rakhi is probably the nicest person on the server.

I apologize for no response.  It's 1:30 AM and I'm falling asleep.
It'll at least have people actually seeing a person's page before they hit that block button they're so fond of.
My objection is with the automatic blocking of people on a list.
I posted some.
I mean, the block button still exists.
If your blocklist includes people you've never interacted with, then that's abusing the list.
Whoever came up with the idea of blocklists should be dragged out into the street and left there.
I'm waiting for my twitter account to delete itself.
Pfft
Excellent!
Work takes a lot out of a person.
I apologize.  Today's been a crappy day for me.
True enough.

There's not much I can do on a personal level to change that.
The world is what it is.
Usually.
I don't whine.
I'm very apathetic.
I don't really care, though.
2020 I'll probably vote centrist or write in.
2016 I didn't know enough and didn't want to get involved in political shitflinging between family members.
In 2012 I don't think I had much of a permanent address.
That would be the right-leaning candidate more than likely.
I haven't voted in any presidential elections.
~~I didn't vote in 2016.~~
Because as much as I like the middle, I lean more right than left and have that kind of trust in people.
Now it's looking like both options were criminals.
I used to ask if people woild rather have a madman or a criminal, and we picked the madman.
And that's as much as I'm gonna say on the matter.
I'd rather the next president was a centrist as opposed to a Republican or a Democrat.
Who is Nanoha *training*?
Who is Nanoha even talking to?
Black people tend to be chill, in my experience.
I'm half Mexican and I can't handle hot foods.
Exchange programs?
It's not really doing anything but posturing as the "superior" standard (which the ad poster said was a YMMV thing anyway).
The ad poster mentioned that the ad was basically saying "our stuff's better than everyone else's" and I seconded that notion in my brief debunk post.
All in all, *incredibly* disingenuous and blind.
He followed it up later by complaining that the guy posting the ads was cherry-picking his data, ignoring that the ad poster had posted about 30 different ads by that point.
Over in Spacebattles' Gun Control thread the discussion has recently shifted towards ads and the nature of the ads.  So, one of the posters took it upon himself to post some ads he found in various gun magazines.  Attached is one of the ads he found.  One of the criticisms of various ads was "man card", or claiming that the ads were saying that you weren't a man without a gun.  None of the ads posted actually had anything "man card" (excepting a so-called fertility ad on the same page as a gun ad) but a guy tried to spin the attached ad as being a "man card" ad by trying to say that the stylized "M4E1" was actually "male" spelled as "mael".  That was promptly debunked by myself explaining what the ad was for, the M4E1 lower receiver.
No, sympoi.

But personally, I'd rather live in a northern state.
Oregon I haven't heard good things about.
Worse than anything.

The coasts get a lot of attention for having some pretty shitty people.

Some religious folk are fine, though.
Sneaky kiri
Religious idiots are just the most prominent.
That exists on all sides of the political spectrum.
I am a firm believer in self-teaching after high school.
It's amazing that school still exists.
This is what I do.
Pardon the slightly provocative pose in the first one.
I feel ya.
But it's my parents I have to hide it from.
I wouldn't mind it so much if I was noticed by the world around me.
So I just use shaping instead.
A feminine body would make what I do easier, but that's not something I can maintain without being noticed.
I could never cosplay.
I worry too much.
I've discovered something about myself.
Unfortunately, not everyone would recognize that.
I need to get better at tying those skates.
No, just unhealthy if it gets out of control.
False accusations are a serious thing.
If you ask me, everyone involved has just had their career torpedoed.
I think Johnny Depp is a good example of the court of public opinion jumping the gun.
Anything not sponsored by a company.
The big names won't go to smaller cons.
Also, consent.
The careers of everyone involved will be in shambles by the end of it all.
Or half?
But sometimes they're needed.
Wars aren't pretty.
Is that to say nobody won World War II?
Iran's probably gonna get butt-whupped.

Nah, not that.

Shopping malls tend to have *really* bad ice.
ehhhhhh
Ideally one without hockey.
Though once I get a job and a place to live, I need to find a rink to skate at.
My mood has stabilized and improved, so now I'm focusing on getting some work in Colorado Springs.
Alsp wouldn't be able to wear my gear during lessons anyway.
Depending on where I skate, it might not matter.
Just so long as I can skate.
I don't care about the political leanings of the city.
Easy to slip into the background up there and it's the home of US Figure Skating.
I like the friend's idea of moving to Springs though.
Someone who's physically there with me.
Like, a rinkside supporter or someone to actually be on the ice with.
Yes, that's the one.
Happily.
Don't have my own car or I really would do it.
A friend of mine suggested I move up to Colorado Springs for my skating, but I don't even know where to begin.
I have some *serious* emotional issues.  Emotional support for skating is definitely a requirement otherwise I'm not gonna be able to let myself get anywhere.
Like the people in the article above or the people who want to veganize their cats.
It's the nutters that give people on both sides bad names.
The average vegan is like the average meat eater.  They don't care what the people around them eat.
Anyway,
Got a source on that?
Like, if we're gonna shame people for eating certain foods, what goes around comes around.
What's your point?
Soooo
I don't care for vegans, but this was stepping way over the line.
These guys were assholes, end of debate.
Time to chime in.
Okay.
I tend to be a little self-destructive with my thoughts sometimes.
Do you think I'm too hard on myself?
Actually, let me rephrase.
Am I too hard on myself?
Folks,
I'll let you know what I find.
And the even harder part is finding a coach.
But it's a matter of picking a cheap but good one that will take adults for ice dancing lessons.
I'll be taking lessons so that will give me access to the rink.
And I don't think Springs has one of those anyway.
That may or may not put you as the oldest member.
In terms of server pop, anyway.
*Almost* unique.
Heteroromantic, asexual.
Is there a word for "straight romantically but not sexually"?
Nah, you wouldn't be wrong.

~~Just clone a new body, swap some chromosomes around, transfer consciousness.!~~
Real talk, I like the idea of body swapping.
Cybernetics are the future!
Transhumanism when.
Ideology is expensive.
~~I'm not a hugger, but I don't mind offering emotional support if you want it.~~
I'm actually trying to expand into Victorian style ballroom gowns for skating in, but thise are also expensive and I need to get fitted for one.
<@189146272865845248> It's not 100% the same, but I do sort of feel the same way about the outfit I like to use for skating.
I just wanted to explain it.
Yeah.
In "transcend" and "transhuman" it basically means to move beyond.
In "transsexual" and "transform" it means to change.
"Trans" as a prefix has two different meaninhs, I think.
I like magical girl as a genre enough that I'm actively writing my own.  With some trappings of other genres.
When my parents found out I liked ballet, they went nuts.  Though that was over a decade ago.
I've always had "feminine" interests even without the internet.
Mind you, this has been a thing since 2015.
They've already been heard out and their arguments have been found wanting.
I mean, there's literally over a dozen telescopes up there already.  Iirc, the TMT is actually #14.  In addition, they've been working with political and religious leaders since day 1 of the project, so these so-called activists have literally no room to talk.
https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2019/07/23/hawaii-news/observatory-says-it-was-denied-critical-maintenance-opportunity/ In other news, "activists" block maintenance workers from getting to an observatory complex in Hawaii.  I put activists in quotes for several reasons, chief among them being that the reason they're protesting is because the Thirty Meter Telescope is being built on "holy ground" or somesuch.  Never mind that there's already a dozen different telescopes already up there.
As it happens, I agree with this guy.

I've been burned before by people twisting PMs.
I'm just really cautious about things going on in private.
That's probably a better idea than a public callout, to be frank.
Moral of the story: don't play coy with the Justice System.
For those not in the know, some students from Oberlin got caught shoplifting from a nearby bakery after the 2016 election.  This led to a whole slew of complaints of the typical activism sort despite the shoplifting charges being entirely legitimate.  The Dean of the college even got involved, but as a protestor and not a voice of reason.  So, the bakery decided to sue the college.  And won the suit.  Oberlin *would* have had to pay up to $33mil in damages to the bakery, but then they asked the judge to delay the collection, presumably so they could liquidate.  The judge agreed to delay, but now Oberlin has to pay a bond equal to the damages plus interest.
https://legalinsurrection.com/2019/07/oberlin-college-ordered-to-post-36-million-bond-to-delay-gibsons-bakery-collection-of-judgment/ Oberlin played a stupid game and won a stupid prize.
My argument is that they don't have any ground to stand on for their protest.

The straw that broke the camel's back re: San Francisco waa a gay father getting told he's not going to be accepted onto the school boaed because he's white and would apparently not be diverse enough for the board, never mind that he has mixed race children and the board has more than one open position.  The SF Chronicle interviewed the guy, which is already more than what the school board did: https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/heatherknight/article/San-Francisco-school-board-s-antics-would-be-15948058.php
There's been a lot of lead up to this, starting with planning to remove the names of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and others from schools.
San Francisco's school board went off the deep end and the city's had enough.

Allow me to make this simple just because I can (not directed to anyone here): **Overstuffing the shelves will actually *lose* money for your store!**
The store encourages its employees to overstuff shelves to the point where there's product in the back splaying all over the shelf.  Then when we come in to do the resets, clean up the shelves, and make everything organized again, they complain about the backstock.

If I could just go through without being required to write a research paper for every non-mathematics class I'd appreciate it.
Also research papers.  I hate em.
I say that because the entire class missed a particular assignment due to circumstances outside our control and the professor was just going to mark it as incomplete on every single student.

That's an absurdly sexist take.
I'd like you to elaborate your point here because as I understand it, you're saying that some people are more inclined to be shitty just because they happen to be male.  I do hope I'm reading it wrong.

Are you familiar with the tweet that got her fired?  Mainly curious because you might change your opinion when you read it.
In this lady's case, it wasn't so much against white people but against Asians.
TL;DR, she's suing because the board fired her over the racist tweets and voted no confidence about her.  She's claiming that being called racist is a violation of her first amendment rights.

Just give FFLs proper tools to help enforce what's already there.
For the most part, the assault weapon ban seems to me like feel-good legislation.  Putting a bill/law into the books to make it seem like things are being accomplished when the bill in question really has no teeth.

This is *not* how negotiation works.
The problem is the people they blockaded don't have any say in whether or not the plant in question stays open.  If they were trying to get better hours or something then yeah, it'd be valid, but they're trying to keep the plant from being sold to another company.  The people who decide that probably aren't on-site at the plant, thus making the blockade ineffective at best and pointlessly antagonistic at worst.

~~I've never used a wooden straw.~~
Also, on a personal note, I have a habit of biting the top of my straw, which would make the top of the paper straws taste like cardboard pulp.
They weren't very good for "long-term" drinking either (as in, buying a 44oz and drinking it over the course of a few hours/the day)
A local gas station here used those paper straws for about a year.  They had a tendency to get bendy, especially around the spot where the straw meets the lid.
That's why they suck.
If they can come up with a paper straw that doesn't soak up the liquid as you drink and rapidly deteriorate as a result, I'll happily support it.

My point is mainly that the director is ignoring what's been said by Jewish Americans and instead deciding he's gonna tell them what they think, which is why I'm coming under the impression that Amnesty International is no longer reliable.
If the director's views on what Jewish people want are shared by the organization as a whole then that'd be an even further drop.
So, Amnesty International has been dropped a few pegs on my "reliable source" rankings.

The foundation can barely be called such.  The floor is literal plywood atop the old floor.  The only thing that works properly is the water.

That's what my boss says anyway.
If I was making $15/hour I would only be allowed up to 24 hours per week.
Apparently it's due to labor percentages/quotas.
But the nature of the job means hours are variable.
Technically.

Found out recently that I'm not allowed to have 40 hours per week at my job, on top of making a dollar less per hour than I was expecting to when I applied.

Which Love Live is Nico from, anyway?
~~Awaiting the day someone turns My Fair Lady into an anime.~~
*Momma Fate*
~~I really don't blame them.~~
Seems to me anime creators love the movie Equilibrium when it comes to dual-gun fighting.
Apparently.
I've forgotten some things.
She introduces herself as "Fate Testarossa-Harloawn"
Fate is also *married* as of StrikerS.
Fate's more like a sister while Yuuno is the one she's got a crush on.
As much as the fandom adores NanoFate, I feel like there's room for NanoYuuno as well.
Then again, given how she uses that longsword like a katana, I don't think weapon effectiveness was a priority.
I feel Signum would do better with a shield to alongside Laevateinn.
My desk is a TV tray.
Bread,
We're off topic lol.
I wanna recline while I watch.
Don't.
Legit.
Don't buy PS4.
Not even Strike.
In other news, Crunchyroll has no Nanoha.
And unlike most, I like being able to kick back and relax while I game?
Because I've had it for almost 3 years now?
It's really difficult to watch pirated anime on my PS4.
I don't wanna use Crunchyroll and be spammed with ads lol.
Amazon, since I have Prime and can watch on my couch ad-free.
Only ViVid Strike.
ViVid doesn't seem to exist anywhere.
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Like Ver.
Just once.  *Just once* I want a Mad Scientist villain who's actually aware of when things aren't going north for them.
Then I've nothing more to say.
This seems to be boiling down to a simple vs complex conversation.
Again, death is not the only way to have a meaningful loss.
Saying that an audience won't be invested in a battle or a conflict because the possibility of characters dying isn't there is rather presumptuous.
There's plenty of ways to create tension besides "this character might die, ohnoes!"
I think you're generalizing a bit much.
My reasons for not liking it are more personal than they are rational.
I also disagree with the idea of character death as a plot device, but that's unrelated.
Setbacks on both sides should be the marker of a good structure.
If the antagonists have all the wins, it's not interesting.  Same as if the *protagonists* have all the wins.
I disagree.
Nanoha sure has a habit of "the bad guys always win until the end of the series".
I feel as though one phrase sums up the entirety of StrikerS ep 12: *There's a hole in your plan.*
He was run over by a truck while saving a little kid who didn't actually need saving.
Theoretically, since he died and went to the spirit world.
AC4?
That went completely out of order because of latency.
I have ideas, now.
oh jeez.
For my own works.
If we're fanficing that AC-Belka and Nanoha-Belka are the same country, then these are the same folks who nuked their own borders because they weren't allowed to conquer the world.
Referring to ffn and ao3.
And yet fanfiction crossing over the two exists nowhere on the main places.
So as it turns out, I'm not the first to make the AC/Nanoha connection regarding Belka.
Did anything besides Strike and the Nanoha trilogy even get licensed?
Because it's *nowhere*.
Apparently whoever licensed it disagreed.
Since it's the only one readily available without downloads.
I think I'm gonna skip ViVid and move straight to Strike.
~~Bisa actually threw a fit because I try to only use Trusted sources.~~
I don't stream because bad internet.
Britweebs go to bed.
When I'm pirating.
I use nyaa.
And my "chair" is a reclining couch.
Unless someone else made a new one.
Last I checked, the AL thread hadn't gone anywhere.
KanColle thread.
SpaceBattles.
<@155150213445582850> Hello from SB!
#2 is a definite desktop background contender.

https://youtu.be/oZIJz3cx5M4
If I had more than 30 minutes, I'd set to it tonight.
Big.
Eps 1 and 2.
And official subs seem to be *completely* nonexistent.
Downloadable fansubs for ViVid are effectively nonexistent as far as I can find.
Anyway,
I'm not a programmer nor am I a crass person :V
With ease.
So they couldn't go with asa?
On one hand, *who thought that abbreviation was a good idea*, but on the other, *I don't wanna know.*
".ass" file extension.
*I'm sticking to trusted links from here on out.*
~~Nanoha is doomed to the depths of obscurity.~~
No seeders, either.
And then nothin.
FFF did the first two episodes.
None of the trusted ones have done the full series.
Welp.
Is it a full series or an OVA?
Or is it just ViVid?
Does ViVid have a full name?
The Golden Compass movie was backwards.
Yes, I am :V
They should've done a better job on the film adaptation.
Although granted I only remember minor details from it and only the names of the first two books.
Now, I read that line and my mind drifts to the His Dark Materials trilogy.
Gonna torrent ViVid.
http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2018/09/13/watch-action-packed-magical-girl-lyrical-nanoha-detonation-films-full-trailer-with-theme-song-by-nana-mizuki
30?
How old are Fate and Nanoha by ViVid?
My kamen rider knowledge is zilch
Urobutcher will not be on this series.
No worries.
I think is how it's spelled.
Haganeya.
Nah.
The fellow writing for the Azur Lane anime did Kamen Rider Gaim.
Lol.
Something I don't get about mecha anime: mech-sized handheld weaponry.
When it comes to mecha anime, I find myself drawn more towards stuff where the mechs are more mystical than mechanical.
Persona 5 in general isn't all that great.
So I dunno whether to watch the rest on Amazon or keep up with what I've been doing already.
Well, I've already downloaded and watched the first 5 eps or so.
Conflicted on whether I should watch or not.
Princess Principal is on Amazon Prime.
Y A W N
Mostly disappointed with the way they treat the female lead.
Agreed.
Yeah.
Do need to catch up on Vrains but it's only on Crunchyroll and I don't have premium.
I haven't watched most of these in years.
Hyper Drive makes me think 5Ds.
Halfway to Forever is Zexal, isn't it?
Maybe I should watch it again.
The fanart is cute, though.
No, I haven't taken the time to watch that yet.
Oh lol.
Don't remember exactly when.
Maybe?
Haven't read it, but I watched the anime somewhere around 8 years ago?
I mean I've already seen it.
<@!99695384296701952> too late.  Though it's been some years since I last watched it.
Are there any "Magical School" anime out there where the students *stay* in school and don't go gallivanting off to parts unknown to save the world?
Although I shall now exploit this knowledge for my own use.
<@231025503643893770> Speaking from experience, PS4 does support some mkvs, but they don't usually have the subtitle track.
The summary clued me in.
The MC of Happy Sugar Life is a yandere, isn't she?
Translation?
And also phenomenal.
Glitch's excitement is real.
What's a Yuyushiki?
I dunno.
Done.
Although all things considered, that's probably not much of a spoiler.
I only watched ep 1 before starting up Valkyria Chronicles and then going back to youtube lol.
spoilers.
oi.
Selesia has very honest eyes.
Watching Re:CREATORS.
I recommend The Expanse.
~~Lightspeed Rescue was the best series and you'll never change my mind.~~
Not a fan of how the morphers are getting bigger.
I wonder if they'll do an F1 anime?
They've done most everything else.
I haven't checked CR in ages.
I like Unicorn's all-white color scheme.
That was a separate question entirely.
Ah right, clarification: watching Gundam UC from 2014.
Watch him go completely undefeated until after the finale.
Masked pilot introduced in ep 2.
Mecha anime as a genre has too many traditions.
Tradition?
Why does every hero mech in Gundam have the same color scheme?
Question!
I've got a few character profiles written out already.
What would you say if I told you I was working on my own idol story?
https://twitter.com/llsimgfunbot/status/1056624641933017091?s=19 I should keep watching Sunshine just for this scene.
They never get denied the fanfare.
Which is why I hate rival chatacters.
I happen to enjoy a denial of fanfare, personally.  I may be the only one on the server who does, but I do like seeing someone built up as a superpower or something like that only to be taken down like it's nothing.
Even the original probably has its detractors.
With the exception of the ones that break or mock the traditions like IBO.
Gundam and I, however, mix as well as oil and water.
I like mechs.
I get that I disagree with like half the server when it comes to tastes, but work with me here :V
Then are they actually a character in their own right or are they just someone to juxtapose the protag?
My argument is centered around the idea that rivals are bad writing in general.
They are not omniscient.  They are not omnipotent.  They should be treated as such.
Directed.
Not random.
That's the main crux of my point.  I want to see them "lose" to more than just protag pilots.
So you disagree that rival pilots tend to be unstoppable forces by anyone but the protag?
Like "okay, this battle has zero tension because I know who's going to win".
But on the other hand, making them unbeatable just makes them feel boring to me.
My point is that a rival that's capable of losing to pilots not the protag aren't much of a rival.
Lol.
Then again, if they were protrayed realistically, they wouldn't be much of a rival.
I don't particularly enjoy the concept of the rival pilot, because it usually means the rival is set up as this unbeatable force.
Do you suppose the idea of a rival mech for the protagonist to fight is often poorly executed?
Asuna deserves better than the role she was given.
I think we've managed to agree on something, so go ahead.
Getting shot down by a secondary is fine because it fulfills the requirement that they be shot down by someone not the main protag.
Is that so bad?
*They don't have to be.*
I don't think I suggested that the rival be killed, either.
I think at this point we've moved a little bit beyond killing off main characters.  Particularly since I never suggested that the character being killed off was anyone but a supposed rival to the MC.
But who are we to say whether or not a show will be reviled because it subverts expectations by developing a doomed character?
I mean, I understand your dislike.
Is it really, though?
Make sense?
Except in my example, the gun is misfiring.
Something mentioned early on then forgotten until the time comes to pull it out of the ass.
Yes.
In which case the arc is about them learning humility and growing into that image.
Unless they escape to fight another day.
Someone getting built up only to get their ass handed to them has had their arc concluded.
Aborted arcs are arcs that typically get dropped quietly with no mention.
Yeah.
What I want is to watch it on my TV.
Because I don't want to watch on my computer.
Given my horrendous luck in getting my hands on ViVid, I'm just gonna see if it's on YouTube.
I seem to have a bad habit of picking up single-season series as my faves.
I don't really wanna deal with torrents right now.
Anyone have a direct download for Nanoha ViVid that's got subtitles baked on already?
It's not on Amazon or Crunchyroll, unless it somehow got folded into ViVid Strike because someone wasn't thinking.
Probably not.
It goes Nanoha > A's > StrikerS > ViVid > ViVid Strike
It's the only one I can't find on any of the streaming platforms.
Which reminded me that I *still* haven't finished ViVid.
Was looking for stuff to watch on Amazon, bumped into Vivid Strike.
Point is, don't be surprised if someone doesn't catch your references because not everyone's seen everything.
Because I've never seen Jojo.
I still miss anytime someone supposedly makes a "Jojo reference".
https://youtu.be/PXyDtX2BKfc
It's *really* good.
Go watch Fight League.
psst.
What next, though?
True enough.
<@189146272865845248>
They seemed to be setting up some threads for S2 in the last couple eps, but I doubt anything will come of it.
There's that done.
Welp.
It's interesting how a ruder form of "idiot" and the standard form of "monster" sound the same.
Though that's not saying much.
I enjoyed it pretty well.
So if there were to be a season 2 it probably would have been announced by now.
Probably wasn't popular enough.
rip
I rarely regret it when I do that.
I found it while looking for something to watch, liked the premise, decided why not.
On ep12 of Season 1 but Season 2, if there is one, doesn't seem to be on Amazon.
Armed Girl's Machiavellism.
Inasmuch as a Yandere can be heartbroken.
Yep it was heartbreak.
~~It's really hard to describe.~~
~~Also really good at picking apart their personalities, so to speak.~~
I'm really good at picking those up, if the animator includes them at all.
That foreshadow reveals.
Anyway, character tics.
Also picked up on a "heartbreak" (if you can call it that) a few eps before the reveal.
I picked up on a blind character about 6 eps before her reveal.
Anyway, the series I've been watching the past couple days.
Holy geez Discord could you be any slower?
Not so much on environmental things.
I seem to have a talent for picking up on character behavior.
Because the computer I'm using only has 2gb memory.
What kind of specs does it need?
Without converting them to MP4 I can't watch them on my tv.
Those are mkv files.
Mel.
No seeders, no file.
Torrents are automatically out because none of them have seeders.
Is there anywhere else I can direct download from?
This is still incredibly frustrating!
It's as though fate is conspiring to keep me from watching ViVid.
This is incredibly frustrating!
The 480p version will but the 780p version times out.
Ep 2 won't download.
I may have run into a snag.
How do I download?
Do accounts cost me anything?
So kissanime can do downloads, right?
I didn't get lucky.
Due to the unstable network I'm working with.
Downloading isn't working too well.
1-11 are all missing and 12 is an m4v file.
<@231025503643893770> Something may have gone wrong with the encoding.
Encoding is *much* faster than converting.
<@231025503643893770> I'll be watching ViVid on my tv later today.
Because heartwarming.
Do recommend watching.
https://youtu.be/qxrj_fovDr8
Lol.
?
<@231025503643893770> How does this "Handbrake" program work?
~~I also wasn't feeling well today so I kinda skipped everything.~~
I've been lazy on that.
I have to download ViVid first.
*Nobody* talks about it, but the eps are half length.
Fight League is like that.
~~And then I got blocked for posting spoilers of a finished anime, the hypocrite.~~
Did like Franxx a little bit, but people were spoiling it a lot.
A few years ago.
Seen it.
Because I'm not interested in having spoilers for something I was a few hours late in watching.
I think a major problem is that if it gets hyped up a lot by the server, I avoid it like the plague.
Fight League isn't related to Bamco.
And tend to hate on Crunchyroll.
It's on Crunchyroll but people here are spoiled.
Cop Craft
Gridman.
Toji no Miko
Fight League
And also vice versa.
I can't talk anime with anyone here *because nobody watches what I watch*.
It's boring.
Why do I have such unique tastes?!
It's really good.
<@189146272865845248> Go watch Fight League.
~~Especially Asterisk War.~~
Don't knock it til you've watched it.
I should finish Fairy Gone.
Despite being roughly early 20th century fantasy.
Fairy Gone.
Hmm.
Some recent anime I liked.
Gundam is meh in general.
Iron Blooded Orphans killed off every main character except for a couple.
I.E. Heavy Object.
Mecha is okay every once in awhile if it's not another Gundam clone.
Fantasy is seriously oversaturated.
Like, what trailer did you even watch to arrive at that conclusion?
"Generic fantasy" couldn't be further from the reality.
Mahouka was also good, but people liked to harp on about the protag.
Asterisk War was *really* good.
Like Asterisk War.
With some exceptions here and there.
I have a tendency towards single-season shows.
My interests can't be pinned down to specific genres.
There's another problem.
Ah.
I have this apparently unique ability to look past fanservice and see the actual show :V
I don't mind fanservice as much as a lot of people do, so I tend to have a broader scope.
<@302063351767498752> <#336297840529899522>
And it is annoying.
Gundam is *all* about the politics.
It dwarfed Wrench and the others.
That bot is *huge*.
Fight League is scifi.
***Fight League.***
And Persona.
And Jojo.
I'm biased against Gundam.
SBY
Though it depends on your scifi threshold and what you consider scifi.
That had best be an exaggeration.
>only two studios can do scifi.
The first 4 eps or so should let you know if you like it.
Some eps don't have seeders though.
https://nyaa.si/?q=Fight+league&f=0&c=1_2
I'm checking nyaa.
I can get you a premium code.  It will be from someone else but it'll still work.
Crunchyroll.
So you'll be caught up quickly.
There's 22 eps so far, I think, but they're only 10 minutes long.
~~Fight League is next.~~
Lol.
User*
"The Devil is a Part-Timer"
Lol.
Would you read something entitled "In Another World as a Pizza Delivery Driver"?
Does handbrake work well with removable drives?
Even in batchea it still does 1 at a time.
And finally figured out how handbrake works.
I have successfully encoded 5 eps of ViVid.
https://www.deviantart.com/wolfsbane7-0-6/art/Champions-of-the-CMBL-Prologue-726534320
https://www.deviantart.com/wolfsbane7-0-6/art/Champions-of-the-CMBL-Angela-Christie-726537446
 The prologue and the first chapter are two separate links but were one doc initially.
<@238855496797257729> <@316755282716000266> Would you two like to read the first chapter of my aborted mecha project?
Not really but they do look similar.
~~Wrench is a Bikki clone and Piers is a Kanade clone.~~
There's a few custom emotes limited to Mel and Saki.
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Actually, I'm gonna hold off on the ViVid waych for a sec so I can name the eps properly so I don't end up with "1, 10, 11, 12, 2, 3, etc."
If they have, I haven't seen it myself.
Soonas I'm done watching this Spacedock vid I'll set about watching ViVid.
ViVid encoding done!
I'm pretty easy to *entertain*. <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I'll probably be moving straight on to Strike.
As I told  <@238855496797257729> I'm pretty easy to satisfy :V
You don't have to worry any about negative opinions from me, usually.
Ep12 encoding.
Lol.
Hayate the Bureaucrat lol.
Adult Nanoha is *everyone's* mama.
I like young Nanoha's confused moments lol.
Very very Yuri.
In a couple hours I should be watching ViVid.
Lol.
Waiting on ep10 to finish.
Almost done with ViVid encoding.
~~shhh.~~
***GET YER MIND OUTTA THE BLOODY GUTTER!***
I'm pretty easy to satisfy as far as enjoyment goes.
Different strokes for different folks.
~~I can't wait for the Re:Mind DLC.~~
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
~~I have 7 eps finished, working on ep 8, 4 more to go.~~
~~As have I.~~
I was under the impression they were still bite-sized after StrikerS.
Also, when did Agito and Rein become full-sized?!
ViVid ep7: I seriously think it would've been funny if Einhart had accidentally put her head through the holo screen to show just how much a bundle of nerves she was at the time.
~~Yes.~~
~~I'm actually slightly biased about Belka because Ace Combat.~~
Nana does the OP for ViVid.
And dammit I wanna finish watching the fight but at the same time I must sleep lol.
As of 12:30 AM I've finished up to ep7.
Lol.
Vivid Strike OP: Where the hell does Sieglinde get all that popcorn?!
Ep5: I have this little headcanon that "Harry" is actually short for "Harriet".
~~I'm not gonna say more, although I would like to.~~
That's about all I'm gonna say on ep4.
I sympathize with Rinne.
Yeah, I actually did guesstimate a year or so between the two series.
Though you did mention the plans to give it a second season that never happened.
That was a very cliffhanger ending then.
Oh.
Also, RIP Fuuka's modesty.
She did have a job at one point before the show started.  I'm guessing it wasn't anything remotely related to retail.
Ep2: Fuuka was apparently not taught how to properly lift boxes.
Someone gets brutal on a bully?
Her moves are hilariously telegraphed as a result.
ViVid Strike ep1: Fuuka's got power but she's a brawler, not a fighter.
I'm gonna skip ep13 and go straight to vivid strike.
The batch I used only jad 12 eps in it.
Vivid is 13 eps.
I ran into a problem!
~~A girl with a katana was said to be one of the most likely contenders for champion.  Lemme have mah sword and shield!~~
Something that bugs me about Vivid and Nanoha in general: most everyone is either hand-to-hand or magic projectiles.  Hardly anyone uses weapons and I've yet to see a good old-fashioned Shield and Sword combo.
Disappointing that she lost.
The Chantez Choir in ep10 is hilarious.
Also wasn't banking on Miura for a win, but she's a protag.  I should've seen it coming lol.
And very protective of her popcorn.
ViVid ep9: Sieglinde is adorable.
Sifting through my danbo faves is reminding me that Asterisk War still needs its third season.
Crazy.
Apparently.
You must be joking.
Honestly given the mess that is the franchise's storyline, that seems very plausible.
Lol.

~~Vivio's too old to be the biological daughter.~~
After A's, her parents aren't brought up again.
Actually, that's something of a problem I have with Nanoha's story, too.
*She's never even been to Earth!*
My one concern throughout Vivio's story is that she never meets her adopted grandparents on screen.
I finished ep8 this morning, took a break to watch youtube.
I finished watching ViVid a couple nights ago.
K.
Yes?
It's more intrigue than spectacle, which is why I like it
That's the end of that.
Ep12: So emotional it's even affecting *me*.
Ep11: I found out why Fuuka always has missing teeth in fanart.
Her skills and repertoire would *skyrocket*.
Vivid Strike ep10: Someone needs to introduce Fuuka to the Wuxia genre.
~~Urge to refer ro Fuuka as Fu Hua rising . . . .~~
I do kinda like that ViVid and ViVid Strike don't have stakes quite as high as the other 3 series.
You're the first one to actually notice :V
<@239893407122718721> Explain.
?
Yours is more subtle :V
~~As straight as a circle.~~
https://youtu.be/5u05wDfJo5E
Inagine if mecha writers actually let the protag beat the rival early on.
Imagine if Char got his hands on a gundam.
***BIG O!  SHOWTIME!***
Although in my case it was more about rivals.
I've had this conversation with Mel before lol.
Exceptions being Wing, 00, and series that have pre-established organizations using them.
A good portion of Gundam is just falling into the cockpit with no prior training and suddenly kicking ass.
Thor is crazy powerful without the hammer.
Both.
I wonder if she'll get her own ep?
Rita showed up at the end of the latest Cooking With Valkyries ep.
Nonono.  Kiribot is for cute.
Shirabe mainly grabs sources for posted pics in <#336297674707828747> or <#336297808221044736>.
Maria is for the server gacha.
Dess
As the protag grows, they get closer to taking out the rival.
So to speak.
Make the rival a growth tool.
They don't necessarily have to win in ep1 or 2.
~~That's the point.~~
I do that already but people still get confused when I say I'm not interested in something.
~~I don't care about ratings.~~
What, exactly, does MAL have against localized titles?
I only recognize Cop Craft and Dr Stone.
Cop Craft and Gear are all I'm watching.
I've not heard anything interesting about Dr. Stone.
This is a 1/10 season, because I happen to be watching things that other people are watching.
And 9/10 it's usually something that nobody else is watching <:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
If I like, I watch.
I just poke around streaming services looking for stuff to watch.
~~I don't really use MAL.~~
~~I see Cop Craft.~~
Aya misspelled your name.
Did you post that in the wrong server by accident?
Using it pretty much every turn.
Was thinking of the guy who abused Shining Draw.
<@99695384296701952> Such as that guy who could literally use Shining Draw on command?
We should move to <#449826367903629313>.
unlimit macro and dfissure kthxbai
Build Fighters I opted not to watch because model building doesn't interest me.
I can do kitbash.
Unless it's kitbash.
That's the part I don't really enjoy, to be honest.
~~Neither did I but it's cheaper than gunpla.~~
~~Whatever happened to plastering every wall floor to ceiling with posters?~~
Lol.
*Don't make her mad*.
Speaking of Cleanette,
There's also Mattie, Cleanette, Snips, etc.
~~I mean, we've got a girl by the name of "Wrench".~~
AKA Nailgunner Piers.
<@238855496797257729> That's Piers.

~~Wrench/Piers OTP~~
With an anime attached.
It's a mobile game.
Lol.
Because GGG=Gear Gadget Generators in my mind.
I'm too invested in Fight League.
I just want to mix and match.
The whole UC storyline is a dunpster fire.
https://youtu.be/YukKDks9GVg
I finished the Nanoha movies.
I was watching that and then forgot where I was so I'm probably gonna start it over again.
For the most part yeah.
Horrible Subs usually are, despite the name :V
Horrible Subs version, y/n?
I was looking under the wrong name.
Oh never mind.
Need something downloadable though and all nyaa has is the dub.
Gonna watch that one.
Actually, what's the name of that series where the protag is a demon who's supposed to kill a magical girl?
gib magical girl stuffs
Need something to watch for the road trip home.  Suggestions?
Machikado Mazoku.
I love it already.
"Something very abnormal is popping out of my very normal head."

||https://youtu.be/D0QhT24AtRA|| <@468591607332208641> found it.
Although I forgot his name, but one dude tries to pilot I think Big Fau and it just says "Cast in the name of God . . . Ye not."
Yep.
"Cast" as in "forged".
Not quite the line.
It's been too long since I've watched Big O.
No joke.
No lie.
Big O should be in SRW.
I liked Vanguard if.

I have the game but I don't play it often enough.
Looks like a sequel-ish to the game.

Remember that manga about a fighting game team?
Cyclopses.
~~As a side note, I find monoeyes and eyeless characters to be extremely unsettling.~~
I'm always drawn to the eyes first so I tend to notice these things.
~~I don't watch or play BangDream :3~~
Just as an aside, I've never been able to get over the shiny spot in the corner of every Love Live characters' eyes.
Those are some poofy shoulders.
~~If ZLS doesn't appeal to me, what does that make me?~~
Kreimhild Gretchen was the name of Madoka's Witch.
Madoka was never Walpurgisnacht.
I have no idea.
~~Then again, I feel the same about ZLS.~~
Also has a gacha game.
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
hmm.
Nutcracker Fantasy?
So apparently CLAMP did the character designs for fhe new CFV anime.
Although that's mostly live-action.
See: **the entire Toku tv presence.**
Gundam generally isn't a favorite of mine.
https://youtu.be/5bU5sk81rG8 Found this in my recommendations.
I'd argue that applies to a grand portion of Gundam series with a couple exceptions here and there.
~~It doesn't.~~
Idols on ice when <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
Lol.
So the redhead is a murderer?
I get the impression something really bad happened.
~~It's sad, so no.~~
~~I have no idea who she is or what she did.~~
Not a fan of redheads?
Cute redhead.
It's the concept of the Rival Pilot.
If there's one thing I 100% despise about the mecha genre,
I like the stuff that breaks from the traditions of the series.
Gundam has always felt "off" to me.
I've never liked the political storylines in Gundam.
<a:piratelorenz:590545144508579840>
Wasn't there at least one rival in Gundam who trounced everyone in a production mech?
Only the protag is allowed/capable of beating the Rival.  Not even the protag's teammates.
Main thing I don't like about Rivals is their unbeatable-ness.
Now I have nothing to watch!
Couldn't say if it's because the subs are overly literal or something else but they're definitely not natural-sounding.
Downloaded a bunch of stuff to watch on the road but the stuff I downloaded isn't what I'd call quality now that I'm watching it.
Cute Shigure.
https://twitter.com/C2_STAFF/status/1400460279687704583
Less well-off fans are priced out.
I see people showing off merch and I consider them to be rich lol.
I was more thinking about the price of merch and the price of cons.
~~Sometimes I hate being a broke fan.~~
Doesn't help that they're usually fuck-off expensive.
It occurs to me that I've never been to a proper con before.
~~If you can even find them.~~
For older or more niche stuff I'd think direct downloads would be the better bet.
When I'm not watching during a roadtrip.
I usually just plug a flash drive into my PS4 and watch that way.
My TV is teeny and only has a couple HDMI ports :V
~~I forgot about that.~~
~~Also, I can't watch MKV files on my tv.~~
Torrents are fine if the video is MP4 but most nyaa torrents tend to be mkv, which can sometimes have issues.
I need a player that will play MKV files without glitching out.
I require assistance!
I feel like if I start doing research on Yukino Bijin and her design I'm going yo drop down a rabbit hole there's no getting out of.
See my comment above lol.
I have no idea.
~~And she's the only one I've really taken an interest in because the skates are part of her main design.~~
The only ice skating horsegirl I know of is Yukino Bijin.
https://youtu.be/HYrVKLBhitE
~~I don't have a anili profile.~~

Lol.
~~A dude named Yuri doesn't count.~~
Of which there are precisely none.
I just want more ice skating anime that involve yuri.
It annoys me when seasons in an anime have changed and the only change the characters go through is adding a scarf to the default outfit.
Mahouka got a *lot* of hate from western watchers, iirc.
Basically an anime where ice skating is the focus not as figure skating or hockey but as a communal and social activity.
I want an ice skating anime that ~~treats the ice rink as a character.~~
Some folks "anime not worth watching" is other folks "anime platinum"
I've been waiting for this lol.
https://youtu.be/4Ps6nV4wiCE not 100% sure where this should go.
A series known for yuri subtext with a straight pairing.
No wonder people hate it.
~~There may or may not be a trend here.~~
Sounds like a rude person.
Same.
I just want my magical girl team on ice theme.
Be different <:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
shhhhhh
There's a ton of idol anime on the market already, tbh.
Y'know, <@379633671897874433>, as many ballet dancing cures as we've had, it'd be cool if we had an entire season centered around them.
Precure on Ice when <:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
FFXIV
I'm waiting on November for two reasons and they're both in my status.
Ala Angel Beats?
~~That's ballet and only one girl.~~
gib
*magical girl ice skating team*
Once more
~~I'm gonna take that as encouragement.~~
This is going to require copious amounts of not-spending.
Gonna cost several hundred bucks at minimum.
Exactly lol.
<@152896851660505088> <@237964037898502144> should be both.
An all ice skating magical girl transformation.
I want to commission an *animation*.
But surely.
Slowly.
It's currently downloading.
Otherwise I probably would've watched.
Honestly I heard negative things about it on release and so didn't bother with it.
blame aria
https://nyaa.si/view/1239591 <@!331908049822547978> This the one?
Some folks here may be interested in her.
Whoever wrote Digimon Ghost Game ep 7 was very clearly inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds.
https://youtu.be/48Xrwn8Gsc8
I'm only halfway through ep 1 and I love it already.
I've started watching something entitled "Oda Cinnamon Nobunaga".
Just chiming in to mention that I love pretty much *everything* about Oda Cinnamon Nobunaga!
That I can get behind.
Super unflappable tends to come across, to me, as generally being smug or arrogant if there's not a backstory reason given for it.
Like super unflappable characters that practically never emote?
Do any of you have certain character personality types that just completely annoy you?
Despite many people pushing me that direction :V
Never got into flipflap.
NIH syndrome?
I dunno, never asked.
And the other is actually a friend of mine lol.
You're the second person I've encountered who goes by "Budgie".
~~you have no idea how surreal your name is for me.~~
Given who he's dealing with, incredulity?
Spotted at the local Sam's Club.
I could spoil things about Cole's powers to help the answer to Cole v Tsubasa but that'd be rude.
You ever wonder how many duel disks the average YGO protag goes through in a season?
Lycoris Recoil ended its first season.  People are apparently not happy?
Just one less thing for the meme pile I guess.
How do you think the fandom would react to a Gundam show without all the weird names?
Just as a thought experiment,
I was meaning that as nobody questions it at all, in or out.
In-universe or out.
So basically it's a tradition to the anime.
You ever notice how in most Gundam anime there's at least one character with an impossibly fancy/complicated name?
I'll have to finish it to see what you mean.
s2 when?
all I can say is
I have just binged half of the Cyberpunk 2077 anime.
So.
Yeah I busted out laughing when I realized what she did lol.
ep1 finito
Now starting ep1.
I just finished ep0.
gonna whip up a small writing thing as soon as I finish ep1.
I have been *inspired*.
It's all Dark Souls all the time nowadays.

Discussion of continuity regarding a decades-old property.
Just didn't look hard enough :V
Ah right, found it.
wanna watch the new gundam.  where at?
tfw so used to double spaced paging you forget you're using double spaced.
Ep2 and further will need to wait til tomorrow.
Mind I only just finished ep1.
End of ep 3, ||Suletta has 2 wins.||  Beginning of ep4 though, ||she's only got one.||
Apparently.
animation error in ep3.
WAITAMINIT
WAITAMINIT
commencing ep4
Anyway
too soon to tell, imo
Give it some time.
Or so.
I mean we're still in single-digit episodes on a series that will like stop around 24 eps in.
Corpo war!
ep3 finito.  ||Guel seems to be a bit of an Amazon chaser . . . .||
||Prospera=Suleta mama.||
After starting ep 3 I'm glad I decided to wait lol.
After finishing ep 2 I was gonna share something that I noticed.
||"I want to learn more about you," he says to the incarcerated girl.||  m'dude.  ***m'dude***.
I love how ||the bodyguard/butler dude is just so used to Miorine and her antics.||
New Gundam ep2 watch in prog.
It gets points for that.
Vivid Strike gave us Fuuka.
commencing ep5.
ep4 finito
||Miorine is a *really bad* pilot.||
also
Hence my "animation error" comment.
Lol.
Maybe not quite *that* far.
||Guel eating humble pie three times so far seems to have done actual good for his personality.||
Honestly
ALL CAUGHT UP ON GUNDAM WITCH
How does chuchu fit all that hair into a helmet?
question
I think Aerial has a bit too much of a fondness for ||dissecting its opponents.||
Ep6 done.
Took me like 2/3 of ep1 to notice it's in widescreen format lol.
Started in on the Arknights anime.
~~Nurgle loves you!~~
Lol.
Who do you think will be Suletta's date to prom?
So, assuming the school in gundam witch does school dances,
||He gets the job because he's the only applicant.||
When it happened I started thinking "Plan B" but nope.  That was full "damcon" mode.
~~It wouldn't be Gundam without a ham-fisted war story.~~
True enough but I'd like to see them cover that hopefully without starting a war during the storyline.
Ep7, not yet.  About 2/3 in.
Would be more interesting, imo.
Honestly hope they skip the whole "war" aspect and instead focus on the ruthless corporatism.
Shaddiq interest: *Everyone*.
Watching g-witch ep7.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbmE9AwMJ-s&t=57s vtuber anime incoming
G-witch ep9 finito.
THAT WAS INTENSE
True.
Can't watch G-witch this week.
Crunchy sub lapsed.

How many sipping pictures do you have?
"Suletta . . . forgetta . . . ."
~~My anime wishlist is full of things that'll never happen.~~
As of ep12 I think the haters will get a bit of a wake-up call.
Remind me again why there were certain folks who thought g-witch wasn't "dark" or something like that?
TIL there's a Trigun remake airing this season.
After only two eps?
Technically three, but one of them is just the first in an alternate key.
Which one?  There's two.
HEY GUESS WHAT!  I wrote this.  Not finished, but it does have at least a sort of "finished" sounding ending.
<@284390402210136064> https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcUW17nDbmdbrO0fVT1W2Q6Q7dYjdoxfA I made this playlist for my down in the dumps moments.  Here's hoping it lifts your mood a little bit.

MuseScore.
Also, ~~rests are my bane.~~
I dread the day I have to move on to 16th notes.
Also, the fastest interval I've worked with is 8th notes.
So it's not very suited to transcribing music.
The program I use is a sheet music program.
Probably not.
It's the best I can do with no money.
I use a sheet music program called MuseScore.
Yes.
<@!102691114762371072> <@284390402210136064>
Also for <@284390402210136064>
<@!102691114762371072> Here, have a version that doesn't have all the silence at the end.
<@284390402210136064> Between Cutesy v2 and Pellinore, pick your fave.
Better version, with a proper ending.
~~Someone else gib thoughts.~~

How do I write a national anthem?
Hey guys?
https://youtu.be/wyiYxYZ-t_c
https://youtu.be/cbnlzZ0KQ_8
I tried to stick a forte on the flute but that just forte'd the trumpet, too lol.
True.
It's drowning out the flute.
Adding some trumpet to the end to lead into the verses.
May boost the BPM by about 10 or 20.
Yes.
Common time, 140 bpm, MuseScore 2.
Warning: there's a bunch of silence because I haven't really completed the melody.  This is just the chorus.
<@290431224596660224> Tentative melody for the chorus.
Anyone else have thoughts?
I switched "adore" for "fight for".
"In the Darkest Night,
In the Brightest Light,
Xeraxis, she shines true!
For the sacred king,
For the noble queen,
Our homeworld we adore!" Next bit.  Second half has me concerned.
I'll put it in MuseScore when I get home.
Just a basic melody.
Though I do have a rhythm in mind that I haven't put on paper yet.
Lyrics first, song second.
I'm going the opposite route I usually do.
Yeah.
"We will fight against all the stars"
Not personally, though I've never been good at writing lyrics.
That may happen here.
You know how some songs start with the chorus?
Yeah, I was thinking this should be a chorus as well.
Well, first verse or so.
"In the name of our hallowed home.
In the name of our homeworld.
In the name of our Dear Xeraxis,
We will fight ‚Äògainst all the stars!"

Lyrics for a possible military anthem.  Thoughts?
And to think, I came up with that line about 5 seconds before posting it.
Make sense?
"For the honor of the Empire, for the glory of the Empire, for the future of the Empire."
Titled "Honor for Trizeria" or something like that.
Lol.
My aim is a national anthem for a nationalistic star empire.
Good taste.

https://youtu.be/jhK2ev_O-pc I feel like there's two different kinds of demonds being sung about in this song.
And before anyone chalks it up to accent, the last line of the chorus is "We have the Venom of Venus in veins", with no W sounds on the Vs.
Powerwolf's Venom of Venus normally has no trouble pronouncing Vs, but goddamn, "the wonders you *unweil*" bugs me somethin fierce.

Still trying to find 1 and 2.
#4 is really dramatic.
And also because the Circus Battle is pretty much a Wake-Up Call Boss.
#3 is regularly associated with the Circus Battle in chapter 3 because that's where it's first heard.
There's like 7 different battle soundtracks, including the one for the world map.

Rumahoy works with Alestorm on a frequent basis.

It's not exact but for the most part they're the same, just adapted for different word lengths and syllable counts.
It's literally Livgardet but in English.
As far as I know.
Switzerland isn't considered Nordic.

It's really that fun.
I've got 72 hours in that game already.
So, about two weeks ago, I bought Ni No Kuni 2.
I was doing scratch damage for quite a few floors lol.
Level 90 monsters vs level 67 party.
I got to Floor 24 of the Faraway Forest Maze before giving up.
Evan would've interested me more had he been a cat*girl* instead of a cat*boy*.
I originally played FFXIV on ps3.
Funny you should mention PS3, Shirabe.
Else I probably would.
Can't afford a sub.


Now I gotta finish it.
Ni No Kuni 2 beat.
bad joke
I was Scholar/Summoner before I quit.
<@!246146781832806401> If I can get my hands on a PS+ sub, I can redownload it.  Otherwise, nope.
I'm playing solo.
To be fair, it's literally designed to be played in groups lol.
30 minutes into Sea of Thieves and I've already sunk my ship.  Twice.
I'd think so, though, considering Hearthstone.
I've had it for years and I got it for free.
I don't know.
Thoughts?

Oh wait.

No thanks.
~~But Hearthstone has never been balanced.~~
Gauss mechs?
Either or, I play both.
~~Install StarCraft.~~
I played Hearthstone once, years ago.
I wonder if I should install Hearthstone just to screw around with you three.

Wanna know before I install it.
So does anyone here play Warframe or was that just the other server?

Yeah.
Gib league IDs.
But I tend to get lost.
I like caves.
I've never really been a fan of strip mining in minecraft.

Unit based or team based?
Honestly, I can't imagine the Symphogear creators allowing Bikki to be in another series, even as a cameo.
Swimwear sells, but I wish they'd try something different every once in a while.
A bunch of mobages these days also do male swimwear.
Nah.
There's so many winter themes that aren't Christmas.
I find that annoying and limiting.
What I mean is, every mobage out there tends to have swimsuit models and stuff, but nobody ever goes for winter-themed.
~~Some markets are more niche than others.~~
It's a right shame mobage makers won't capitalize on niche markets.
<@196360095485919232> teach me WarThunder.

I knew that part already.
Vertically.
Like, get them out of the way.
How do I move blocks?
I did that on another door that isn't vertical powered.
I want the whole thing opening and closing at once.
I don't want to use repeaters and delay the upper sections.
Redstone power limit.
Somebody stop this insanity.
My Redstone Gate can go up to 10 blocks high.
And when I play steam games, it pauses.
Well, the computer isn't mine and I can only have steam open a couple hours at a time.
It hasn't finished installing yet :V
For ftp, just Paladins and Dreadnought.
My PS+ ran out.
Mostly single player stuff.
And xbox.
https://gfycat.com/TautBlondFly I did a thing.  How stupid was that thing?
It looks better now.
That redstone gate.
Oh yeah.
HEY KERRICK
Alice can take over the world and play Hearthstone at the same time.
