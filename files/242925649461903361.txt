I will, thank, <@285555416056856576> <@!127644949884698624>
I mean we are all Symphogear fan, why are we fighting over something as stupid as pairing? That kinda thing is what tears everyone apart.
I'm trying to be civil. I just want to ask Quinn to let the other do what they want to do, and accepted other people's opinions. Nothing more
I just hope Quinn followed them and not start to piss everyone off.
It's a example, but you get what i mean, right?
I doubt she will follow those rule, but still, i mean shippers that are little extreme with this kinds of things. I mean, don't you hated when someone keep telling you one of your favorite shows is a kid theme which it is not? <@!127644949884698624>
This happen before some time ago, i just said that the directors didn't  say anything about who is paired with who and then Quinn came starting the pairing wars.
And not been a jerk about it?
I mean, will it hurt just to accept other opinion?
And maybe organize a privet channel for RP, it's better that way, or QuinnCrystal and others like her will start to bugging the RPers, because she doesn't like that her 'cannon' partners been paired with someone else.
Okay, but i think there should be rules if someone want to pair one of the girls with another character or using a OC. <@!127644949884698624>  Or else things will go our of hand real fast.
Or maybe RP channel, that can work too.
How about a pairing corner were you can pair with characters from other anime, game and a OC with one of the Symphogear girls.
