and all the references from previous seasons' transformation
this season's transformation feels too good
which is a good variation imo
ignite song give some rockish to the song
wtf so crazy
fk ep 2 really escalated quickly
~~all budget goes to seiyuus as usual~~
i gladly take this over the other way around
badly draw animation but amazing story so far
nah not as bad as s1
especially 2nd half of the ep 2
i seee few dropped qualities in few animations
