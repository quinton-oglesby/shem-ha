It's always morally correct
das knows all about those lmao
oh ye thats defo for the other chat
prolly fine so far tho
careful about going too <#336297808221044736>
No one is immune to The Rooster
no
so like
a sandwich is just 2 seperate pieces of bread with a filling hetween them
u shouldnt
no
but
tehcnically
i mean
WHAT
litterally its like they were trying to make the coin have the wrong words
we want to have prosperity thats why we are leaving one of the largest global markets
and we want to be friendly with nations thats why we are threatening to deport their citizens
brexit is litterally the opposite of all that
cause it is
`Greatest Liability: Prone to speaking publicly`
i thought the onion was satire? lol
is good tho
lmao have seen that \:P
yeah hrt and all that stuff is some of the safest medication out there 
at least the female one idk as much about T 
but compared to so many other things the side effects are super unlikely sorta thing
yeah but its really not good for u
and thats 3 weeks max
if ur doiung stuff and burning energy, or dont have much like fat reserve or whatever not gonna get that far
defo can be done if needed tho
boring answer is it depends
on like how much physical activity ur doing and what the meal is, that sorta thing
exactly
it wont
last use of the guillotine was in like 1960
should probably change that
that would be helping who really need help which would be SOCIALISM CANT HAVE THAT (/s)
generally considered to be right twats
trans people who super gate keep being trans
come in a couple variteties but the main ones are like: NB people dont exist, u need all of the surgeries to be valid, and you need dysphoria to be valid
now go use it to make truscum shut the fuck up \:P
phew
i can explain it a different way if it doesnt
does that makes sense >.>
like they are linked and similar
but u dont need one to have the other
and you cant have one without the other
is kinda like saying happiness is part of sadness
dysphoria is inherantly negative
no
but u dont need to hate one to like the other
ye
it mostly works my analogy shh >.>
basically you dont hate being ur assigned gender, but being ur prefered one is like "holy shit this is great love this"

like how say, you got the choice between cake and ice cream, 
u might be like, eh ice cream thats kinda meh, like ill eat it but is very middle of the road however
whereas cake is like, bam love that 10/10 food gimme more

just replace cake with gender and remove the bit about it being more of a choice
best way to explain this is with an analogy
errr so
and then they generally shut up
like yes they are intrisictly linked but you dont have to have been sad to be happy later
and then they will go "but surely they are the same thing"
and then you go "that means happiness and sadness are the same thing"
cause gender euphoria still exists?
will take more than 15 days 
but yes they should still do that
words
minority*
thankfully is a small majority
tho ye it sucks ;-;
for t and b respectivly
cause err
ive gt my thing screw you now
or like
nah p sure ur just like me how dare u be different
i found out thru memes
like even gay stuff wasnt mentioned in school at all
mooood omg
i had like
no idea how it worked or anything was never taught anything like that
and now ive kept it cause its funny
(its not its ID)
and if it was down to username
but i wanted to see what happened of 2 people had the same name
!! is the first name that will appear
oh err
i was testing the order discord puts you on the right hand side
in the same venn diagram of shit people
v similar if not the same
oh i was drhoagy \:P
can be other things but that kinda thing
just pills n stuff
p sure i explained this to u before
tho that might have been truscum
isnt it an outdated version of transgender?
o/
oh fuck ye thats gonna complicate stuff too omg
got a nice flag thats all i need \:P
i just call myself bi and roll with it
*narrator: it was not normal*
just chiling no need to check on that its probably normal
at that time
i was more like
oh i assume everyone hates being a guy cause fuck that noise
just
a lot better too >.>
oh ye it defo could have been worse rad
wait why idgi
i didnt even get that
heres a condom heres how u use it now out u go all is good
ye same emily
i was taught some stuff
but like
bare minimum
and only straight stuff
oh ye why is that different to like
just being lesbian/ just being bi
calling the democrats anywhere *near* the left at all is
an interesting move
More revolution than the others :P
brexit means brexit all that shit
no the most vocal at least want no deal
I doubt that most of them think they are doing good for the country tbh
lmaoooo
yet
Yeah it has the possibiulity of going
well wasnt there leaked plans to deploy the military in the event of a no deal brexit right?
so
thats not good
yay
which is fucking depressing that thats a thing to worry about but
yeah same
i mean fucking terrifying
and by interesting
gonna be interesting to see how this second wave of covid combined with brexit combined with everything else
like yeah we are pretty fucked
But think of the poor billionaires no one looks out for them clearly we need to cater for them
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
The UK has very different gun laws than the US no?
And are very restricted in what kind of gun you can own
Yeah you need a reson in the UK
need a place to lock it up when you aren't using it
have people vouch for you
and like
how civil war esque will that get cause ...
how likely is it that like
trump claims he wins today
then mail in stuff is counted over the next few days and it turns out he doesnt
Which is what the interstate compact is
(citation needed)
Hasn't the supreme court done a case where they said yeah
The states can vote how they want that's the whole point of this place or something?
(required to change it)
Plus cause it's a constitutional amendment isn't it basically impossible to change?
I mean we probably need to be able to loose a state thru legal fuckery and still be able to have at least 270 to be sure
Plus, if it's super close (within 0.1%) doesn't that mean a recount?
If he can't loose it they would have called it
Yeah
Though *technically* not in Nevada
It's already as close as you can get with all the nuclear tests
It turns up in heist films which Megan likes but
not *that* much
Which is a low bar but
We've never thought about Pennsylvania as much as we have this week
How much reporting?
0.1% right?
Yeah he just repeated what he's been saying anyway, just gave "examples" this time
Isn't it like 3% of the population needed to shut a country down at least partially?
I mean, there's the power of his cult following will do what he says
I think he's on loop right now he's said all this already
Has he said anything true yet?
Yes same
The telephone polls were wrong therefore fraud
tbf twixs are fantastic
tfw you loose the election because of candy
god its only been 2 days too
its been a while and like
if something did happen idk if we'd find out anyway
yeahh
kaiyoo
nice new pfp zug lol
and its owned by murdoch and broke the hunter biden laptop story but also like
ive nevber heard of it so
the only one I can find is from the daily mail or the sun soooo
That feels pretty applicable right now
Where's that article that talks about the US like western media talks about not western countries?
Terrifying it even needs to be said
?
what
*weeks*
I'm sure carol won't be annoyed at not being her colour
does seem like at best part of the alt right pipeline lmao
its why they are all getting thrown out
trumps own lawyers had to admit they had no evidence didnt they?
for so many reasons
but again the scale of that compared to how many people vote cause the system is designed to stop certain people voting lol
yeah cause it has to basically happen in the room where every person running has a representive there
what prompted that comment tho >.>
well there was the whole trump gutting usps thing too remember tho that was kinda undone
and tbh every single ballot room lmao
most have barely started cause they dont have a leg or even a toe to stand on
such as the trump campaign having to admit that yes they did infact have watchers in the ballot counting room
they are being investigated?
just
every time it turns out there is almost exactly 0 evidence of that
or fake ballots or dead people or whatever people are saying
easier to stop people voting than make people vote one way or the other
plsu in america you dont really need to do fraud cause voter dienfrancisement is much easier and totally legal
If you kick up enough of a fuss, *some* people will always use it as an excuse
Yes, that's exactly the point behind this well done
Trumps team have taken it to several state courts and every time have been laughed out because they don't have a leg to stand on
If you can show me that then I'll admit that maybe there is something there, until then all this is doing is deliberate slowing down of the counting process, either with the same goal of Bush in 2000, or to incite political unrest
*Any* at all
Any evidence of any wide scale voter fraud
Has there been any evidence beyond some one off claims of
oh
i saw a dead person vote
or my second aunt twice removed voted even though she didnt
And while ill admit this is on a slightly different scale to NASA vs flat earth
Just because someone claims there was something doesn't mean you have to give it any time of day, this act of neutraility being every single side is equally valid and should be heard is bullshit
It would be like giving equal time of day to NASA and flat earthers about matters of space and such
I'm sure there will be 5 million cases of it too
a) That is less serious because that can not be on anywhere near the same scale of mail in ballots being busted
b) even then there have been what, half a dozen confirmed cases of it?
Other instances such as?
with the *express purpose* of doing this after the election
Mail in ballots that trump told his voters to not use
It's not statisically unlikely
republicans made mail in ballots be counted last
it happens *every time* something like this happens
I'll give you a fun hint, 
there also won't be any evidence afterwards either 
it will be quietly brushed under the table that oh no nothing was actually wrong but Biden is still shouldn't be the president
Finally, something I agree with
And even if I wasn't it would still be in the *millions*
Yes I am sure
You need exactly the same infrastructure to do 33 million as however many there were this year
Sure it is more wide scale because of COVID but 33 ***million***
in 2016 33 *million* mail in ballots were used
Thats a total lie
Large scale fraud along those lines is litterally impossible to do with paper and pen elections
Believe it or not they are not acting in good faith
No they want an investigation to cast doubt on Bidens claim as a last bid attempt to steal the election
Which just validate these batshit insane "theories"
And then people like you are like
Oh no we need to investigate these claims of the hunter biden laptop, or obama litterally being the anti christ
And their followers all lap it up *every* time
It is a move *right* out of their playbook
See also: every republican conspicicy ever
>Some
Even by American standards
Now, what could he have done to be *more* right I'm interested
By being a populist yes
Like what could he have done to be *more* right
Just out of interest
What would you consider to the right?
Full *5 million* ahead
And I don't think you understand how asdWHAT
not 75
77
71 million voted for him
The majority of republican voters think biden won...
Just to keep his cult on side
Or some other insane story
And when the investigations turn up nothing, like they will
He will claim democrats burning all the evidence etc
WIth those words
Would you also say the same about trump unleashing it on the world though?
It *is* statisfying I'll admit
But I don't  see you complaining there at all
By that same logic Trump also unleashed it on the USA
I hope so
As are you if you believe then *unleashed it* on the western world??
And that there were "very fine people" on both sides of the Charlottesville murder
Ooo then pretend to be the victim here too, straight out of the alt right bad faith playbook
Who posts from project veritas or whatever it was called
Who thinks the SJW's are nutjobs?
I know shemmy but is is quite fun, I get to be angry which I normally don't get to
Exactly the same as China, and for far longer
He didn't lock down tourists or listen to scientists
yes
probably sesnible tbh
is defo why the UK has such a big a big terf problem sorta thing, at least partly
where "every opinion deserves equal time"


like esepcially with trans stuff but also just
*everything else*
its this faux "neutraility" carol was complaining about yesterday sorta thing
but yeah
<.<
they also do comedy and tbh thats normally p good
~~even i do sometimes lmao~~
nah people do
cause its not like
reporting on news or whatever right?
id assume so?
the latest in them trying to push transphobia as normal yay
theyve given a ransom demand and have about 12 people still apparnetly
the media also wants neo-lib labour lmao
oh yeah so much so
no because the media is owned basically all by murdoch (or other billionaires) who
want the tories in power
like remember back when corbs was the leader, and everyone was like "any other leader would be leading by 20 points"

thats turned out to not be true even with starner lmao not even properly on the left like
problem is with the media in the UK the tories dont have to really do anything to have a good chance at winning
hopefully all those neo-lib MPs that say they will resign if he comes back will follow thru lol
i mean he also added a lot of other stuff lmao
but
yay thats giood
which like
yeah that sums up the greens a bit
what if everything was the same atm but
better enviroment stuff
oh eww i thought she was chill
like good for the enviroment but
p capitalist n stuff
also like
whjo the fuck else is there
yeah but
green surge
lmao
id rather have starner than the lib dems lmao
but yeah the only thing is like
not fptp voting
and split labour in 2
but
it would be lmao
oh yeah
which is depressing cause, what the fuck can we do
even then i dont think that would actually change anything cept a new leader who, either is proper left, in which case same problem as corbs
or neo-lib again and same problem and starmer
ikr
and is *still* behind in the polls atm
plus he doesnt have half the party undermining him at every chance
hence why there wer so critical of corbs, and anyone else kinda on the left
That's one way to put it lmao but yeah
I mean it's not the chlorine that makes it bad so technically that's right :P
We need to go get that cool chlorinated chicken trade deal
Isn't the UK part of the eurofighter replacement thingy which is planned to use lasers already
oh thats very fake
yeah people come and go, and you can take a break from a place and as long as there are still some of the same people there that shouldnt happen
Hopefully it does
Could be either
Either that or because they spent millions saving Multinational corporations but couldn't find 10% of that money to feed *starving children*
Which you haven't much about recently I wonder why that is
Which was why Eat out to help out was a thing,
More uncertainty is bad for the economy but That too
Is I think the advanced and nuanced political take
Yeah we are, pretty fucked
From what I heard that might not be true
And a tax break if you own a race horse apparently?
listening to boris for more than 2 mins annoys me too much so i wasnt listening by that point
i think so yeah
we are at the 7 mark now apparently, 
just passed 1 million vaccinations yesterday
whats wrong with teachers lmao
unless u have enough for both
i mena you have limited vaccines right now, so its not
isnt that what indonesia is doing?
schools "need" to be open because capitalism cant stop is the problem
if ur that adament on keeping schools open, they should be near the top of the list to get it sorta deal
especially as theyve (at least here) been forced to work at risk with children for the whole pandemic
i mean teachers makes sense
yeah we are like top 5 worst responses or something
and worst in europe etc
I agree
why?
*What*
Wait
who has shot what
if they arent pushing back when they are *bashing down the doors of there* why would they start at 6 sorta thing tho
on the bbc
Yeah tbf is this was happening to parliment or whatever this would also be super tense
https://twitter.com/MeetThePress/status/1346924115656122371
shes *always* shit tbf
oh apparently that banner is him and his wife, not biden etc
which tbh that *might* help as biden is probs gonna be like "lets not re-open wounds and arrest anyone/too many people"
yeah exactly
not tht it will matter but
so he can still seem electable or something
to try un-algin himself from this
on damage control
cause people live there
its also not federal land which is what normally that is right?
tho that sorta goes without saying tbh but
oh *yeah* isnt there even a very very specific law about breaking into the exact building they did
ontop of EVERYTHING ELSE
yeah but theres been a lotta tlaking so, repeated it sorta thing
which is breaking half a dozen federal laws at least lmao
which someone decided to POST THE IMAGE TO TWITTER
yeah the origional image of that is emails
as well as the first thing he said that the election was stolen
was what he said
"we love you, youre very special"
is fox apparently
"how could this possibly have happend"
ik people just
outside the building protesting are "fine"
are they not already in arrest on sight sorta deal?
and that the vote certification should finish later tonight
yeah apparently the building is mostly clear and the crowd is dispersing
that and the "serbia deploys peacekeeping force to the US" one
tho not to the same degree obvs
apparently theres stuff in LA too
so
he urged them to go home by saying he loved them and that the election was stolen and everyone knows it
no
to the point where his cabinate thought about resigning in disgust
like even ignoring his normally inner circle
yeah wasnt trump refusing to do anything etc?
theres nothing stopping them
now lol
something *insane* like that
doesnt america litterally have a law where if the hague tries they invade it or something
they also have an extradition treaty right which might apply
he cant scotland doesnt have an international travel
how many more warnings can they do before they just ban him holy fuck
i can still access his twitter
errm
holy fuck
they did it
omg
including the one calling pence a traitor
and 2 others
oops
thats the wrong person sorry
p sure they all dispise him
didnt he force one of them to catch the virus, and like 5 of them to sit in a car with him without masks on when he was in hopsital so he could drive around for a sec
yeeeep
https://twitter.com/edokeefe/status/1346993660718698496
i cleared the cache and its still there
they did in the full statement
https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1347004167668330497?s=20
yeah
which is why
the person behind the face was doing it
the problem is like
trying to find a "one rule fits all"
in general yeah, pronouns and gender are linked, but not always
is tempting
New profile picture
But being willing to be bribed or get helped by some bad people or whatever makes life a lot easier
or in the CEO case fuck over ur employees or whatewver
There are no doubt exceptions
*generally*
Because to get to the top of a modern country (be it dictator or just voted etc) you need to be a sacrificial bastard to out do everyone else trying for power, basically
same with the *big* CEOs etc to make it that far you have to be the worst
Eh NZ probably is like Aus I'd imagine in some respects so
Yeah but his fans probably think stark was chill in that first 15 mins of iron man 1 still so
i think it was 2
I mean he was in iron man 2
Cause hes le funny meme man
Wow he lied about a technicallity to make him seem more interesting or somnething say it aint so what a dick
A broken clock is right twice a day or something
who are generally seen as more junior
ignored and everything
theres been a lot of talk in the past about how their QA department especially are like
who are prolly more likely to be women
which is probably also not helping compared to newer people
who have a major stake in the company so "cant do anything abhout it"
cough johan cough but also a fair few others
who can do no wrong
group of older devs who have been there forever
pdx also has a massive like
you can sorta imply it
tho the actual report doesnt actually say gender mistreatment
but like, 2/3 of women compared to 1/3 of men who replied to it said it so
yeahhh
but
well, ik why
ik? theres a reason my reaction was "why the dogwhistle"
antisocial means both here
etc etc
drinking
shouting
being loud
its like
thats not what anti social behaviour means
generally considered a terrible idea even before you consider how they will 100% be connected to the internet and hackable
so you can watch it back later
doorbells that record what they see
after the "party of family" one earlier
going for all the dogwhistles
but yes
common but not just from aro/ace people
Which is what will eventually happen this is all just posturing
Except China also doesn't want war
So you are hoping they back down before you do
You don't see anyone caring about China expanding its economic influence with African countries enough to start a war over it
No but the reason to escalate right up until war with China is economic
Hence why people are so willing to play chicken for it
Enough for people to care
It's a major producer of them though
Something that's already in very short supply
The problem with Taiwan is that it produces a lot of computer chips which every western country needs
These 2 ideas can and do exist at the same.timr.
People are always going to kill people
Giving people easy access to easily do so makes it more likely
not just the eu workers, it sucks to be a lorry driver in the uk compared to europe etc
So basing it off tom cruise is gonna skew your results lol
Isn't it based at least partially on your income
tbf over text that happens
like that second to last message defo could sound like it
Like that
But comes across like there's no other way to phrase things, and you want the other person to admit that for you
Idk how to explain it really sorry
Again with that literally 
It kinda implies that like, 
There's no other way for you to phrase things if that makes sense?
On its own it's nothing but over a conversation it can add up
Remove that even for example
How else would I phrase things sounds less so
cause u can make money
but like
depends a bit on the type
anyone can iirc
tbh
whoeevers buying and selling
also the reciept requires 3 acres of the amazon rainforest to be burnt down to make
a server that one day will prolly go down
it needs to be hosted on a server somewhere in combination with all the other reciepts to prove its the real one
worse the reciept itself is meaningless
irc gets back into faision
have u considered that maybe viewing the "progress" of a society as bty "how western" it is is maybe not the best lense to use lmao
tbf its measured by that because of the mesopotamians lol
cant think of anything
nah
gosh i wonder what big thing caused them to barely be used lmao
u knew about them an yet you said this? im confused
more like stopped pedalling forward
gosh how is everyone in this argument wrong lmao
yeah lets never update definitions to fit the mordern world
and most people who are into crypto are convinced that cause its slightly less bad its the econmic equivelemnt of jesus descending from the heavens
less bad
not
nah i just want something thats good
where loopholes have been written into law for the rich forever
easier to do it the traditional way
yeah like i said
etc etc
its slightly harder to evade taxes than traditional methods
its slightly more in reach than other stocks n stuff for the average person
i love that the best reason for crypto is that well its not *as* bad as these other things
Which again, is better than full fat
But still super unhealthy and overpriced and bottled by child labourers in factories etc etc
I'm not sure that was the comparison you wanted to make
Just makes entertainment bad too
That doesn't make crypto good
Yes it should though?
What was your point tho you just repeated the same thing
Yes and I can think both are evil for the same reasons
I can still critic it
And everything else in this society
Ofc I have to use a bank
"I am very smart"
"ah you hate society but still partake in it"
This thing can't be bad cause this thing other thing is *worse*
Yeah and believe it or not
Those are also bad?
but if money exists, there will be people desperate enough for it to live 
and then they can easilly be exploited for it
while still having money or worth or whatever
i just dont see how you can ever totally remove someone exploting people for labour while still having money
thats my confusion
yeah
carry on ur thought to the conclusion please
which means that ...
*how*
no before that tho you said that a decentralised thingy allows more easilly to stop capitalised exploting workers for their labour
how does crypto do that
yeah
ur going in circles
yeah explain what ur crypto based solution to no salaried work is
for instance
but how does that stop someone underpaying someone for their labour
traditional money
if everyone used a crypto currency instead of like
how would it stop that totally
wait how
sure but there are maybe other ways to bring about the liberation of the working class than dumb pictures of gorrilars
not capitalism for a start
this makes more sense
ahhh
whats the CEE?
just use the euro
which tbf arent in the EU
so even without it
cause the legal system is designed to protect white supremacists
i doubt that super mattered
just wanna be 100% clear lol
but had been worried to ask in case i came across as defending kyle or anything which defo not the case
so cant say
ive not followed it that closely
yeah
just appalling
which
like the judge also tried (or possibly just did) force the victims to be called like
i forget exactly but thugs that sorta thing
but thats the one thing where there technically might be a point
a lot that cant be justified
and ik the judge did an awful lot to be biased
so obviously what kyle did was wrong and this trial was a total farce
but
idk if saying they cant be called victims is actually that wrong
given the whole trial is basically determining if they are victims or not, idk if the *trial* should be calling them that
anyone else yeah ofc we can say what we want but the trials whole purpose was that so its sorta putting the cart beore the horse lmao
just a lotta people focus on specifically that point so wondering if my like, gut feeling is totally wrong here
shes litterally modelling herself off her
down to like, the outfits etc she wears
cause boris has been saying "it's the next pms responsobility" and the next pms havnt been in power to do anything
basically had 3 months of not doing anything
theres probably gonna be some serious civil unrest this winter
oh yeah we are fucked
however there is a vague idea shes basically a seat warmer for boris to come back
eh she might actually be so incompetant she wont be as actively bad
unfortantatly they were all the card holder tory members lmao
and like
157,000 people had a choice
She's basically thatcher 2.0 but she would struggle to spell thatcher
the international response will lean more on the law i reckon?
in holding onto NI
international law supports british with GFA right?
less comprimise more like
as much as the UK could possibly keep their hands on lmao
well don't worry cypher the UK has almost all the same issues
but ik fuck all about NI so
well not with a refurendum sorta thing
aaaa
unification with whom
wdym by unification btw?
Our response to 2008 was what started it 
And the election after when the Tories got in
Nah it was before that
"so soon"
she was 96 and has had serious health problems for at least the last year?
if we get one
so a week on monday
protocol is 10 days after the annoucement is her funeral
Italy's goes hard
its so droney and horrible
we unironically have the worst national anthemn
neither of them sound great lmao
sure, but people said i was wrong about the commonwealth having a king not a queen, which im a lil confused at
and there was a big thing in like
19 or 2018 i forget saying that ol' chuck would be the next commonwealth leader too
not a queen
yes, and right now the UK has a king
true
but you dont have a queen as your head of state right now?
As a commonwealth nation id imagine id effect you a lil though
im blind i cant see where?
me?
not queen
king
british propaganda is very powerful
Yeah they have a lot of power legally
And a lot of power
But almost none of those powers overlap
That and also the ability to just to "no" without any like
Checks or balance or whatever is kinda open to abuse for personal gain lmao
Kinda a hot take there
Well no actual power any more obvs lmao
She didn't do anything when Boris illegally tried to dissolve Parliament a few years ago, she won't refuse to sign in a PM

All her official powers are fake, all her actual power isn't written down in law
Any company worth 1 billion can get that here lmao
Rather than the UK as a whole
Generally excemprinf the palace from labour laws etc
Those are all specific rules for the palace
And the PM is just the royal representative but
In theory technically yes you have to ask them nicely to do anything
It's not though
Okay wtf channel 4 based
And they have task master
Actually 8oo10 cats does count down does slap
Yeah but it does mean watching channel 4
Prolly about 10 mill
Cancelling anything fun on telly etc
It's insane how the UK is almost beint *made* to grieve
Tho more seriously, yeah
I am sat at my desk at work rn I think imagination isn't needed lmao :P
An elected person is more okay, tho personally I feel like there are better options
Having a monarch do it though is, yeah as you said lmao
Ya it's mostly a mix of soft power as a public figure, though with one hand behind their back

And the power from centuries of tradition and being rich af lmao
Iirc there was many a complaint just before the Scottish indyref where in a speach she asked Scotland to "think very carefully about the vote"
Though like, that public sway, there would be a huge amount more kickback if she used it than like
Any other famous person
he has actually tbf, since like the 70s and the 80s
theres also the ability to hear "not the the best take" or whatever instead of "not the best take how dare you be wrong" for instance
That's why I compared it to the HP games
Apparently Rowling has had no super impact on the story (citation needed)
But still shouldn't buy it sorta thingn
Prolly a similar thing here is the new harry potter game
Where like, there are a lot of passionate game designers and artistis and everything making it
But you still shouldn't play it or buy it or whatever
Yeah fan art and projects and cosplays or whatever don't benifit RT at all, so is more fine imo
Oh oof did it
Still very overly harsh but, the US armed forces do have issues too
If you look at the report as "weak" compared to where it could be
As opposed to "weak" compared to someone else
Then it makes a bit more sense
then messing it up before stepping out for the media
normal
there are videos of him looking like
he delivberately does his hair like that
Just a few days apart
Wasn't in the same meeting
maybe a bit of both
wait a second...
yeah im sure sunak will fix all the prpblems caused by the last chancellor
sure but the others were johnson and mourmant so
prolly the least bad
of the three hopefuls
not really as far as I know
at best u could argue that ukraine hadnt super done much to cut back on them etc
A russian missile that might have been intercepted by Ukraine landed in poland and killed 2
I am a russian bot yes
so its a moot point
they arent
no they could also be doing stuff internally too that needs to be stopped
that too ye
I mean, ukraine does have a nazi problem lol
The dicotomy between "extremely hardcore" and "so I think this makes sense"
The full text of it
https://twitter.com/donie/status/1592859900941852674
tho, he was never gonna actually back out so thats kinda pointless
+ now you can kinda say the narritive is david stopped joe donating the money
same sorta idea as disrputive protest
but it does get u in the news so people read about u
ye sure blocking the M25 doesnt actually help stop new oil projects in the UK
same thing as the just stop oil people in the UK
much more "valuable" appearing in the news protesting it
well almost nothing
does nothing
in the grand scheme of thing
+ 10 grand
david beckham has been a big pusher for normalising lgbt people via football and such
the joe lycett thing
theres slightly more to the context than just that tbf
no one clicks on "joe lycett donates 10k to protest the world cup"
there was no way that newspapers would cover it if he didnt do something kinda out the box
that was the point of saying that!
Human experience is more than just art they see on pixiv is prolly why
That's exactly my point tbf
It can't answer that why
Or just /shrug I drew lines that's all that came out
Ask a human why they drew the face like that and they can show u other art they liked, why they liked it, (same as the ai) but also 1,000 other things, shows they liked from their childhood, an old friend they had a crush on idk who knows
Ask an AI why they drew seomthing the way they did
(Obvs impossible they aren't codes to) but the best they can do is point to their data set of images
Trace is maybe the wrong word
Cause ur right they don't take like, this bit from picture a and a background from picture b and glue them together but
Or not read but,
Random number generator s that have learnt to read pictures
Sorry thought a bit harder
aisbveint able to make art is fine
It's just a tool like anything else
It's more trying to equate it to "normal" art on the same level I have an issue with
Actually I wanna clarify something
Tho really really advanced, from a technical pov they are incredible
Right now they are just advanced tracing machines, they just trace so many different images because computers p good at data processing that it's hard notice
Eh depends how much you wanna gatekeep what it means to be sentient
That's probably ky biggest fault with it
When an AI can come up with something new that isn't just a meld of 10,000 other similar things then you have no argument against AIs
It's hard if you break down humans to just the bit that's similar yeah
As just one example
I wouldn't say that's true 
A way humans learn is pattern spotting but we can also come up with stuff on our own for instance
An AI can only use what humans have done before it, you'll never get a new style or new anything without that
But there's a whole host of extra details that also matter
Yes superficially humans learn by trying stuff, failing, then trying again
I think you're being a little reductive of the human experience if what is basically a random number generator can replicate it well enough
An AI has no understanding of what a face or a bridge or a sky or anything is
It just knows they are drawn lots so can replicate it
When an AI knows what it is it's drawing then it's probably not copying as much ig?
But that's all an AI does
Yes you learn by looking at what others do
If you gave me a choice between being Russian or being in a max sec US super blacksite prison, I wouldn't have to think very long
The smart thing to do
Until peolle realise that there's no way to have a key that only you can use
(something else that gets thrown around a bit)
Everything uses vpns
It's like banning encryption on the internet
It gets thrown out as an idea every few months to make it seem like tough on crime and protecting children and shit but
This'll never happen VPNs are used by every business and very very easy to set up yourself
Having an elevated house that is (kinda) outside the factionalism is a good idea
However
The house of Lords is the most British and terrible way to do it :)
+ making it so the PM can't stuff the house full of Tory donors
Mostly by getting rid of hereditary peerages
That title is misleading he just wants to reform it
scroll down to the results section there
i do wish to take back my "remarkably"
im just saying america isnt totally innocent lmao
oh ye thats dumb
history may be a lil different
all im saying is that if america didnt bully japan out of chinese markets etc and kept up relations and deals early on
its saying that depriving a couyntry of crucial resources, going back on agreements, is going to radicalise people and make self sufficicy seem much more appealing
as well as, if ur already being cut off from the greater diplomatic world anyway, it gets harder and harder to sanction them past that
not one im making here tho
no
its more small things that added up
like i said here
part of the deals was immigration
for instance
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924
one sec
They were promised cheap access tk American goods that Japan lacked
Ripping up trade deals etc
That was later
not embargo
in exchange for trade deals and migration and stuff
but gave them up because the US wanted its own access to the chinese markets
post ww1 japan had taken the german colonies in china
Not 2
World war 1
Yes Japan did some truely truely horrific things in ww2 and before
Which the US basically tore up and ignored soon after
As Japan had tok many people, not enough arable land, and lacks many crucial raw materials
Post we1 Japan was persuaded to give up their Chinese holdings to a degree in exchange for cheap trade deals and migration and everything with the west
Especially america
Unless u mean ww1
It was before their invasion of china too
American basically gave Japan the tools and motives to want to expand to aquire goods it was now embargoed from, and none of the diplomatic backlash because of it
That's actually remarkably accurate
And even before that trying to muscle Japan out of china and making Japan reliant on American imports and exports
The US was "sanctioning" Japan even jn the late 1920s lmao
Just seriously considering
Not confirmed yet
That's the one that terrifies me
Did you hear those mandatory brownouts that in October were a "worst case scenario" are now a "seriously considering"
Here's the full list for this month as of 3 days ago
Yeah it's a bit more than that
It's closer to 30 unions striking
What do you mean "sets"
Strikes every single day
Have you seen the list of people striking here this month
cant think why
something that for some reason isnt mentioned here at all
~~tho the west did a lot of not good stuff in the 30s, part of the reason hitler was unopposed to a degree early on was because he was seen as a good counter to communism~~
basically all i was saying is america using its economic influence to bully countries isnt a hugely new thing
given they were kinda strong armed into it in the first place in 1919
tho admitally that was much much more complex than america going "here have this thing" then a year later "oh wait no sorry"
as the best example early on
isnt that the Shantung part of the washington naval conference
`The act was seen in a negative light in Japan, causing resignations of ambassadors and protests.`
He's doing a bit where the people following him don't realise it's a bit
Lawsuit for which bit?


Tbf it's not stealing in the same way piracy isn't stealing
There's a not small chance though that if Hitler had gone into Russia rather than France etc that the UK would have loosely supported them
Because it sorta showed that Hitler was gonna go elsewhere too
Ye after the pact the west got a bit more anti Hitler
Until the Molotov pact
There were big calls for this actually pre war
As an alliance against the soviets
That's not what lank is saying
It didn't help much but
That was the whole Dunkirk thing
The British expeditionary force was there?
Why should america get to dictate the government's of other countries just because it has the biggest stick?
Or given a nice house under house arrest
Because they were owned by ford etc
Lots of factories placed on "do not bomb" lists as they were churning out trucks or whatever for the eastern front
Just like
Oh well supply arms and stuff on the cheap
It probably wouldn't have even been allies
Just for once it's trying to do something I agree with
To be clear tho America is also pursuing it's nations interests by helping Ukraine
The main difference beint who fired the first shot 
Amongst some other small nuances lmao
romania üí™ dubai
Might help Ukraine more if Russia had them
Whereas the A10 is a logistical nightmare and will do nothing
Just a logistical nightmare
Oh yeah like gonna do work
Even more useless than normal
That's cause a10s are shit and would be useless lmao
Some tanks that are awkward to use is better than no tanks
Nor should they
Ofc not
Whereas they are unlikely to get many more 2s
And yeah but, assuming they will get more 
Better to get more of what you already have
So even if it's tomorrow, worth keeping 2s
You can upgrade the 2 to the 3
Even if technically they are worse
Even then spare parts and training for more than the 12 tanks that are available still makes it better for Ukraine
But also, still the issue of a whole new supply chain for 12 tanks
Fine for Ukraine though
Doesn't stack up as well to mordern tanks compared to the leopard or Abrams or whatever
Whereas America has about 10,000 of their mbts sitting in storage
Also there are only about 5 of them
They aren't great
And it's gun is smaller
Trick question they don't have principles
And you never hear about doctors pushing people into getting replacement knees
Bare in mind the regret rate for knee surgery is like
30%
Just update documents
Ye this wouldn't help anyone medically transition
And bipartisan "against" in England
The law had bipartisan support ish in Scotland
Oh ye that's the other bit
UK gender is weird where the only place it's really legally defined is birth certificate iirc
No that's name, changing gender is impossible
England has been blocking it (the first time England has blocked a Scottish law)
Scotland passed a law changing that process so anyone can change their gender legally over the age of 16
Which given the state of the UK to get there is easilly half a decade
Currently in the UK to change that you must have lived with your new gender for 2 years, be medically transitioning for that long and have had bottom surgery
Rather than medically transitioning or anything
So the M/F on official documents
This is about changing your legal gender
More complex than that
Gender is only for adults
Can't have gender before ur 18
Blockers
It is when you see the bonuses etc for executives going up srill
I feel I should clarify quickly
No one was calling you transphobic
You did come from a place of good looking to reduce wait times etc
It's more that the doctor/news people were, they presented data designed to get average people to repeat transphobic rethoric by hiding it in something that looks reasonable
Lmao true actually
People who detransition aren't the issue with the wait times
+tbf even if we remove the 1% of people that regret it, the wait list is still gonna be years long lmao
People have regrets about stuff all the time
Especially medical stuff
There is no easy test for this, why should the 1% of people who do regret it stop the 99% of people who don't
Lmao
Not quite
Ai good?
Tho tbh those are close enough as makes no difference
Or trying to emulate him to pick up all his fans
More a Tate fan
Well political spam bots
Astroturfing is a huge deal
That is the point of spam bots
I mean
No he thinks bots spamming people's replies are the same as bots that post a seal every hour
or maybe didn't need to put on a show
just no one saw it, so they cared less
apparently there have been 3 in the last 5 years
They only did anything because people spotted it
they pop after a while
the reason its not a weather balloon is they arent designed to last
thats doable
if you wanted to go south by south west or whatever
not accurately but
you can control balloons, the wind directions at different altitudes vary greatly, as long as you can go up and down you can *mostly* reliably choose where u wanna go
cant compare to a balloon then
whats the flight time of UAVs like that?
65,000 ft is lower than you can get a satellite
you need something that can float
and for like, 2 hours because batteries are super heavy
Not at 65,000 ft
And you can manover it easily
Because you can get more data from a lower altitude
this is <#336297840529899522>
???
USA bad != china good
ye theres a little bit of nuance there thats been lost lol
i feel like we shouldnt just go to personal attacks like that
tho with jets
russia violates UK air space about once a week for a similar reason
just to show you can
testing response times etc
And there are other reasons to fly something obvious over them
I thought they tracked it since the aletian islands or however yuoi spell it
Depends where its set off tbf
Depends if people want it really
Give it a month or so
It's not cracked yet you can't lmao
lmao
personally
see i wouldnt give the blanket statement that harassment is bad
It's a stretch
Sir-ona- Ryan
what would you say is a smarter way to voice problems?
a token minority character, put in without thought at all to look good
tbh is exactly like that
yeah its more just a cho chang bs imo
because surnames are so commonly used
its more the surname of ryan than the first name imo
*maybe* jk did
but if she was actually consulted she almost certainly wouldnt agree with the character existing at all
"ehehehe this will be a funny dog whistle to be transphobic with lemme sneak that in there"
i doubt one of the devs went like
the actual culture or people who are represented by the character
"oh that sounds right" with no thought about like
at best its kinda a cho chang name
which is hmmmmmm
so itlly be like "fuck u ryan 50 points from hufflepuff" or whatever
but in hp all the teachers etc call u by ur surname iirc
no ryan is the surname
"i support you, but only on paper"
that their allyship ends when it inconviencnces them
This is my fav
There's a reason I'm leaving pol
I don't agree with her on several things but
She was the last British politician who seemed to have 2 brain cells to rub together
To replace her
The next most popular person is *very* bad
Careful, they only seemed like that with sturgeon who just resigned
Well the odd qrt
Am I the only person who has never seen an Elon tweet on my timeline
Mainly ignored it cause
I had that for my apprentiship lmao
+ the US
Their only advantage is the island is about as hard to invade geographically as it could get
Taiwan's military is more similar to Russia than anything else too which people never seen to rmemeber
They are almost wanting to be on their own side
And why they aren't favouring a single "side"
Sure but that is one of their main interests
But with the same end goal
Whereas Turkey is bouncing back and forth between the two positions
It's more passive yes
Hence the are playing both sides
In the same way Turkey wants to be the main power in the Black Sea etc.
They want a weak Russia, but don't want to be a US "puppet"
China would rather have the world where America isn't the sole hegemon, Russia helps with that goal
i sorta only just realised thats the official nato account too lmao
tbf it is insnanely cringe lmao
but stopping imperialism, while hypocritical from nato, is still a good thing
and yes they arent giving ukraine millions of dollars of military equipment out of the goodness of their heart
how is the current ukrainian govenment facist lmao isnt that the russian excuse for the war?
which is what it's doing in ukraine
Stopping russia/china from doing what it's doing
NATO doing imperialsim, which yes of course it has, is not its entire reason for existing
it also is acting as a "defense" against russian imperialism too
thats a bit of a stretch
it condemns nato/us in vietnam
it doesnt condemn nato outright though
but the point of representing america in a bad light in star wars is not "america always bad" but "america did something bad here"
harry potter is pro status quo, nothing fundermentally changes once the big bad is defeated
the Navi too, the humans are very explicitly representing western europe/american colonialism of the native americans
if the Ukraine war was like Harry potter they'd eventually win not by fighting back but finding some weird niche rule in warfare that suddenly causes putin to collapse and all his evil to disappear
its more accurate than harry potter at least lmao
it doesn't mean that there isn't a similar thing going on but with the sides reversed now?
I know that
the US vietnam war allegories only really happened in the third film no?
Yes?
and a smaller far weaker country/force facing off against a larger more powerful autocratic regime definently has some paralles
sure but it was also an analogy for nazi germany
the empire was based off many things
star wars isnt the most wrong lmao
of all the examples in that tweet
well yes but
why?
most of them?
compared to all the other examples
but
oh ye its cringe af
and (importantly for my side of the argument) isnt that disimilar to star wars (god why did this start)
no rakhi he also said that "there must be a way to find peace"
as opposed to everyone elses idea of "well roll tanks into moscow and see what happens"
eh their logistical stuff is very lacking
this is getting a little "personal attacky" now ngl
tbf nato *very nearly* is the US
weirdly I normally agree with Lank there lol
*several people are typing*
i feel like youve somewhat missed the point of the US allegory in SW
which is not "USA bad", but "imperialist powers, such as the US which many people dont realise are one, bad" 
The point was to take a specific example that generally is supported, and flip its on its head to show how the US on the "bad side"
not to say, that the US is bad generally?
*player 4 has joined the fight*
the allegory is the most accurate one on that list
even tho nato/the us is the empire in the OT, it doesnt mean they are now?
but they currently are not doing said bad things
i still dont see how its a bad analogy
you havent explictly
but it doesnt mean it isnt the right thing to do?
yes obviously
it wasnt until russia was building up on their border where gears started turning
nato was very hesistant to actually give them equipment
they were driven to nato due to russian aggression
sure ukraine has major issues with facist elements within them, but im not sure they are a nato pawn lmao
well then, dispite what it may seem, lank doesnt see everything thats bad as being caused by america lmao
eh Jrider ur also suffering from seeing things as binary lol
people have a habit here of only seeing things in black and white
tbf i dont think anyone was saying that
imma need a source on that one
trying to pull away from the US as much as possible?
wait wasnt hearth much much more pro china?
admitally "completely" is doing a lot of work there
yeah thats just a straight copy p much
oh thats such a good channel
