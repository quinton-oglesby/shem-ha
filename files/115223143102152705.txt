o/
why does it air past midnight in japan ðŸ¤”
<@152896851660505088> dutch gang unite
but because s1 had totally different staff, idk
it seems like something they would do
they might
i like it
oh god the end :LUL:
bad > none
its already on the japanese radio?
the full ver already??
how
what
wait
40 min long special final ep, yes pls
hottake: i dont like kanade's voice, too deep for me
nice
have the other lyrics of it even been collected and translated yet?
im listening to it right now
as a matter of fact
which has my favorite lineup of all the seasons
at least i hope the insert soundtrack will be as good as AXZ
and if not
i wonder if they'll bring anything unique to the table with using the melody in the inserts for XV
anyway afk
was hoping someone would do that for the AXZ eps too
when we had the OVAs for G they were uploaded on streamable or something
so i have to watch in my own time
cuz its 3am
i cant join the live rewatch
i still hope someone will upload the AXZ episodes for the Rewatch somewhere
that sounds far too confusing to me lol
they did **BUT** the extension version is still better than CR's own html player
thats why you need the holy trinity
forever region locked
cant even reach their site
funimation :LUL:
and cant Torrent
since i dont trust sites like Kissanime
i have to use CR
look that up
now i need to like
oh god thats a thing?
is that something in xdu?
its still kissanime
because even with the protection
somewhere deep down im still scared lol
busy doing good old MMO dailies, and dinner soon
not rn
i will later
cool
though with the script idk if they still will
i only have ublock and the popups used to go through that
yeah i remember stopping to use it because of the popups
i remember that
ah yeah
and when XV airs
i'll test it out when the rewatch gets to AXZ
it seems to be running when im on the site as it should, according to the icon in the top right
yeah its there
how do i check if the script has been installed to tampermonkey succesfully?
same
yeah
so i might switch over eventually
i use chrome yeah, though some people sent me articles claiming chrome will kill adblockers soon
<@279341087494242304> interesting suggestion i havent heard before, i'll look into it thx
europe actually lol
yknow
in battle
but i mean
around ep 9ish each season
hibiki 2nd songs always appear in the anime, except maybe season 1 where we had Chris' instead
that dont appear in the anime
the side ones
not like
as primary
nah i mean
a half one each
instead of just
i really hope they'll finally give Kirika and Shirabi their own unique songs
i c
why do they air anime at midnight anyway
MAL says 7th
weird
22 june -> 7 july
i only compared dates
also, rip the unlimited beat AMV, after several years it got deleted by KR
hype
15 days left till XV
idk
well maybe the curse gets broken
^this but with less caps
most likely
||is RR compareable to songs like Radiant Force & Arigato wo Utai Nagara / Gekisho Infinity & Senritsu Sonority but 1 for all 6 rather than 2 for 3, or one with the transformation chants like Axia no Kaze?||
yeah its ||
gonna be a great month
only a few days till its july
never knew
oh episode 1 was already screened?
speaking about, im actually planning on rewatching madoka now i have access to the movies
fair
i see
XV opening song name
r u for real
oh just Metanoia videos on youtube being copyright-killed again
people like me who use youtube for their playlists have it rough these days
again
rip metanoia videos
PogChamp
all anime
for like
they usually do this
||welp theres our final move for ep13||
so yeah
ive always seen Axia no Kaze's 2nd half **as** the combination of Gekosho Infinity and Senritsu Sonority
yeah, people usually just do it anyway tho
||mmk i didnt know whether you've seen clips in the tweets, or just raw text||
my bad
oh seems like what got posted was for portuguese speaking regions only
i thought they did for XV
ðŸ¤”
only 1 more for me
ha
true
given now we've been going off the hype of "there will be another season"
wonder if symphogear will live on for a long time after XV
not that far in
im only like
yo dont spoil eva
>dawn
except its like, 17:45
maybe theyre just on antartica
who knows
maybe we just get a 9 month timeskip
other than i guess it makes sense due to axz ending in fall i guess
idk where you got winter from
i swear ive always read summer
too dark?
why
im dutch so i should totally know that
oh wait a sec
glorious break was fine, idk why people are upset only because of opening name tradition
so i'd have to wait another week there
well i dont have CR premium
or today actually
time to sleep and be ready for XV hype tomorrow
anyway
in the end its japanese gacha apps so prob not
idk if its any good
i see a lot of people remixing stuff from Tokyo 7th Sisters so i might give that one a try
i need a new addiction to save me from my current one lol
or any other japanese exclusive mobile app
wish i could play XDU
it does
but what if
i swear she had some sniper mode
so i want to move on to next ep faster
since i binge quite a bit
i usually skip EDs unless i like them a lot
big brain thinking
what if king records actually hired chris
i would listen to it more **if it didnt keep getting sniped**
also technicly nijiiro no flugel is best ed
same
lol
you too?
we had songs in 1963???
i dont think ive ever heard "green green"
definatly rainbow flower
for me out of those 4
i have a hard time judging the OPs against the Inserts
since we just had the survey
might be easier now
i should do a top 10 someday
for real
why does hibiki always get the best ignites
and proved me wrong
then bayonet charge happened in the rewatch
i always thought i never really liked any of the GX songs
from around 30 sec
but for a second that song reminded me of touhou at the end of the twitter clip
it may be because of the low sound quality
||i just wanna say that: i called it lol||
i missed like 10 mins tho then
lol, i joined and it froze instantly
ah ur right <@152896851660505088>
for TV Tokyo stuff theres always streams up, but since this is BS11 idk if theres any
no stream or anything?
but hf for anyone doing so
idk where to even watch live
hype
noice
from the G opening right?
solid wallpaper
j-core in symphogear when
so the episode can wait
also busy getting some freely downloadable j-core remixes to share on different platforms
oh i can get the trial codes, i just dont want to make an account since CR has been hacked before
yes because youre the only one having premium
just the raw torrent atm
i dont think its up yet on any of the streaming sites
and rewatch with subs next week
i'll just watch the raw later
yh
they didnt even do one for AXZ
it doesnt even have a release date yet lol
nowhere yet i think
excited to see the visuals
we'll get it next week
yh
so i cant remember
but idk im going off drama from at least 5 years ago
i swear that mightve been one that had miners
that did bitcoinmining etc
all torrent software was hot garbage
last time i checked
how 2 torrent
who knows
maybe we'll get 2 final moves
yeah i love the transformation here
?
for people like me who dont have CR premium or a torrent device, seems like kissanime is encoding the upload rn and it should be ready soon
meanwhile only less than 4 hours left until re:stage so i get to relive yesterday all over again
finally
watching the ep subbed rn btw


which we can only make with smart audio edits
now we only need a fuller version
a man of many names
oh hes called thiago
what did jim say it was called again, Rokka Ryouran or something?
sigh
i should watch the Fate thing airing rn
oh right
thats a pretty nice theory
so unfortunately geah will be number 2
except Re:Stage is airing in 1 hour exactly
yh

i also have Ewigkeit full version but with the german intro
true
so i should redo it
now i can
back then i couldnt 320
oh yeah
same lenght
^
good
remember to rate SAO even below that then
brb getting murdered
at least maria voice >>>>>>> kanade voice
Symphogear ad while waiting for Re:stage
idk
whats a deth
icry how re:stage isnt on that MAL top10 list
idk if anyone here is in charge of the wiki, seems like Hanasaku Yuuki Amalgam Version will release with the bonus cd for the 3rd Bluray on **December 4th**
ever since the HTML5 chrome extension has been removed im having issues with Crunchy's player again
das a solid frame
