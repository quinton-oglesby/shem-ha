sparkles are simple
A enime emote would ruin my stars
It looks pretty bad
I do not like that
Wait, so it adds an image next to your name?
I doubt it
I still think one set for colors and one set for emotes is the best solution.
I disabled mine because I don‚Äôt want emotes
It‚Äôs an issue because I chose to have these emotes in my name.
That‚Äôs why we were considering having separate roles that didn‚Äôt have them, Mac.
There‚Äôs no option to turn them off clientside, so you are incorrect.

No you‚Äôre Lily Rose.
how do i downvote a discord message
"dessgusting" is a good fucking pun
Sortimg
We are discussing it
Nobody said it was stupid?
This is a very large public server and we can *absolutely* get slammed for posting NSFW content in SFW channels
Twitter, again, has much less risk of unintentionally posting smut
Why not just click the link
That too
There is some veeeery questionable stuff that Pixiv considers SFW
Also what Rad said
Whereas with Twitter everything the link will unroll is right next to each other in a small preview
And people will just look at the first image and share
With Pixiv you can sometimes have to scroll for a while to view all the images.
I‚Äôm saying that the person who posts the Twitter image to unroll will see the NSFW image because it‚Äôs in the same post
Or the app
I mean on the website
So it‚Äôs all there at a glance
Twitter also gives you thumbnails of every image in the post
It‚Äôs too unreliable
Again, there are a lot of times I‚Äôve opened a Pixiv link in the SFW channel and a few images down was straight-up porn because the person who posted the image didn‚Äôt vet the link first.
Since a lot of NSFW stuff can be included that doesn‚Äôt display
I wouldn‚Äôt do an automatic Pixiv unroll feature at all
And ‚Äúthey/them (plural)‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt be confusing to someone who's never heard of plural people?
I like we/us because it‚Äôs really clear as well
I wouldn‚Äôt trust it
You know anyone can edit Wikipedia right?
They're not holding toast either.
After careful analysis I have concluded that there is not actually any toast in the ShirabeToast emote and it should be renamed to ShirabeDrink or have the drink replaced with the correct, aforementioned toast.
Raven would be proud of your TF2 meme
<:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>

Are there any plans to remove the padoru emotes again now that Chrimbus is over?
If I've gone this long without being banned I can only imagine how much you'd have to fuck up to be.
What did you do???
<:MichaWow:900594454308728853>
You were banned?
DarkSydePhil vibes
Just curious, not judging.
Why do you want it to be publicly so bad, anyway?
Public and partnered servers have much stricter NSFW requirements.
Although if the mods think they can handle it, more power to them.
That would absolutely bring a ton more moderation work, and I can't imagine it being worth it given how small a western audience Geah has.
<:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
Let's not be too exaggeratory now.
<@!331908049822547978> Plus, suggesting ideas is helpful regardless of acceptance or not. It's a deliberate attempt to improve the server on your part and that‚Äôs appreciated. It's the thought that counts, after all.
You‚Äôre an anime girl
True, didn‚Äôt think of that.
<:flooosh:824765233188044840>
Making the emote server public could work since it doesn‚Äôt have any channels to moderate, right?
for every rakhi there are ten matts
imagine the musk
i am going to sniff 500-year grimy mythra
Just that some can be really toxic
I‚Äôm not trying to say ‚Äúlol look at these gross, unwashed *weeaboos* amirite‚Äù
Odd in the sense that they like niche stuff, not odd behavior.
Weebs can generally a bit of an odd group but the public ones often have some *really* maladjusted neckbeard types.
The less savory kind of weeb.
Also you get a lot of weirdos in public anime servers.

make me an admin
you‚Äôre right, don‚Äôt make me a mod
i can ban anyone i want
says you
yup
right on command
lol
no comment
honestly that‚Äôs a good question. as much as i love everyone here i struggle to think of people who would be consistently impartial
make kerrik a mod twice
they‚Äôre banned now
skye‚Äôs prick friend was literally telling people to kill themselves for like half an hour before any mods were available to check
genuinely starting to think the server needs more mods. this stuff happens more and more frequently and all the mods are often either at work or unavailable
i usually just dm mods because people minimodding is a pet peeve of mine
since it‚Äôs happened a handful of times now
you‚Äôre fine. i was just spitballing to get the idea out there
lets not get ahead of ourselves
i mean none of the current mods have even weighed in on adding more
You‚Äôre pretty responsible too
we were discussing potential mod candidates and were curious as to what youd think considering youre generally really impartial
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
if it was a popularity contest id vote for you tho
you can have anger issues sometimes, das. i love you and all but defusing confrontations are part of a mods job
what do i look like, a fed?
They probably wouldnt want to though
I feel like Ten or Fenny would probably do a good mod job since they‚Äôre *generally* really neutral
lilies are the female equivalent of matts
I wouldn‚Äôt want to see a ban though.
Banning seems extreme but they also don‚Äôt post much outside of art and the voice actor posts for whatever reason, I guess.
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
you‚Äôre annoying
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
Six max if you keep judging me.
Five max.
I promise to only ban like one or two people.
Me.
4. Make Matt admin because they are very cool and smart and handsome.
There‚Äôs a big overlap and I think it‚Äôd be a natural extension of the channel.
It was a good suggestion imo
What crawled up your ass and died, Yumi?
It‚Äôs a nice lil bit of recognition for all the people who keep the server up and running
I like it where everyone can see the contribution
No üò†
I didn‚Äôt realize they messed with permissions
Oh, that sucks
So it could be something to pursue if we ever get more mods
I‚Äôm in a few servers with threads, and as convenient and handy as they are they‚Äôre also a moderation nightmare at times.
<@263983345669505025> As Keeper of Yggdrasil, we need your wisdom.
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I‚Äôll bother Kerrik about it this weekend
Now *that* would be a nightmare to moderate, lol
Your joke was just explaining my joke?
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
Damn you‚Äôre right I should have made a joke about that
How embarassing
How the hell would you make this a legible emote
BLESSED EMOTES
<:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
I said renaming then, not finding them
Renaming emotes is EZ
DAMN
discord making this as much in a pain in the ass as humanly possible
they just seem  like more convoluted threads which are already just more convoluted channels
i don't even understand the point of them
I didn‚Äôt know they could do that
Mod stuff
Ohhh
What are the bots for then?
Oh
I getcha
Livestreams are so fucking awkward man
And as someone who hates livestreams I vastly prefer this method.
(Love you Aya)
<:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
I like it quite a bit. It‚Äôs nice having a place to live-share stuff like games and shows and I like that I can go into a shitposting channel without Aya posting actual hentai in it.
YEAHYEAHYEAH
Rad
Holy shit
We most likely wouldn‚Äôt need a ‚Äúrepost finder‚Äù without ZGundam in those channels.

What sisterfucker show is this
das if there was a three strike system you and i would have been gone years ago
Not me
Who knows
What is hyperbole anyway
Yeh all the deletion and stuff makes chat jump all over the place.
It‚Äôs been asked before but the answer has always been ‚Äúno‚Äù because the message system makes moderation a pain and when multiple people are using it at once the jumping around makes chat borderline unusable.

Is that Warhammer classic or something else?
Thank you!
I did an Dorothy.
Post them Bikkis
<@449754840445353994> Hell yeah
I did an Lotte Jansson.
<@456226577798135808> That's the girl from Three Houses, right?
Not bad.
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Those are some great minis, though!
I dread to think how much this cost.
Oh my god
Damn, those glasses must belong to an absolutely huge mini.
So your work, while slow and steady, is admirable!
I think my hands would probably shake too much to do this.
<@!486087033652248576> <@!471416654346321930> Those look so good, holy shit
Can't place it, though.
Reminds me of something
I'd recognize the kaiju art anywhere, though!
<@456226577798135808> I almost didn't recognize you with your change of appearance, lol
I used to love model kits, but I think my hands would be too shaky for that now.
What are they on?
Wh--
uwu
You turned out great.
And here's the final one.
Tried my hand at perspective for the first time! It sucks ass. Probably the most difficult thing I've tried so far. Even more than hands.
Very hard
It‚Äôs
This was mostly an experiment with drawing cloth and using finer lines, but I‚Äôm still happy with how it turned out.
Did a business witch.
SHE LIVES

Looks great on the end product, though!
That face on the texture map is terrifying, haha.

Damn, you work fast
Best girl
YES
How they have the legs/tentacle things on the back.
Reminds me of those spider guys from Dark Souls 2!
OowO
She hop
Love the cape üëÄ
Never seen a lamp that looked like that.
That's so funky looking.
Huh.
That's a funky looking lamp
What are they sat on, I mean?
Be sure to post it when it's finished!
Ooo
You had said that you wanted to finish it, so I was wondering if you ever got around to it.
This one!
That was rad.
Did you ever build on that Anubis/rabbit/horned Gundam idea you had?
It's not loading for me right now, Vector, but I'm sure it's just great!

Art getting worse
Looking great, Voy!
I'd like to get into doing models again but my hands shake too much for that
What's that?

<@!486087033652248576>
Here's color.
Forgot to post this yesterday, but I drew Giga Mermaid from Shantae for a buddy.
Any practice is good practice, no matter how few and far between!
I could never get the hang of traditional art like that. I'm way too indecisive, haha
I can't say I've heard of the show before, but looking up images online it looks like you nailed the design!
Is this an established character or an OC?
Nice!
Ayyy
ƒÜ√≥≈Ç√≥r
Most of the time it isn't.
Only sometimes, though
Sometimes art can be fun and rewarding.
Paint job's looking good!
It did!
It do not load üòî

Both with halftones
Dark El~~f~~dar
I mean the specific units
What are they those dudes anyway?
I love the color scheme
YES
That's what we were talking about :P
<@!302063351767498752> I just asked him, ya goof.
I love the mint/white combo
Well regardless, it looks good!
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
Nooo
Need
Wait, they actually have a game about building models?
What game dis üëÄ
<@!359141684606664714> Forgot to say the other day, but your drawing is nice! I like the outfit.
<@!471416654346321930> That's actually a really funny thing you brought up! I draw a lot better on my tablet using my finger directly than I do with my dedicated drawing tablet, because resting my fingers on the screen means they shake less than if I hold the pen.
Win win
I get a neat li'l mini and a small artist gets a paycheck
I have a couple minis, but they're unpainted. Eventually I want to splurge on one of those custom painted minis, though! I've seen a ton on sites like etsy.
I have EPSE which makes doing small movements a pain in the ass, lol
They‚Äôre a pain in the ass to draw
Good work on the legs/feet by the way
It fuels me
MORE ART
I DEMAND
More art
Yes
Oh my god there's so many
I laughed
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
What about hot *and* rainy?
What's the weather like?
Jeez
You're going to be painting for months
Those ships look like skate egg sacs
Love the hair highlights
EXCELLENT
YEAH YEAH YEAH

Looks great!
Ayyy
So what are these li'l dudes?
I really like the yellow one on the bottom
Ooo
Looking great, Voy!
Huh
Why does white do that but not any of the others?
OOF
Why's that?
I like the color scheme on the left dude a lot
Looking good!

Looking good Mikey, Voy!
It was bad

I mostly have the earlier sets
Not sure
Uhhh
Somewhere
I still have my Bionicle sets, lol
Yee
Who me?
I couldn't afford the expensive LEGO kits as a kid so I made do, lol
I'd say close to 100
I spent hours in that program, lol
My heart aches.
Nooo
Is that still a thing?
Lego used to have a 3D modeling software where you could design custom LEGO models and special order the bricks.
Oh, hell yeah it is
I can't make out the picture too well, is that a custom Bionicle?
It was the Boxor
You're right
Oh, wow
in a walker
I small dude
I also had one that was like
Good stuff
They had these skull faces
I liked the ones with the spears that could launch their little worm dudes
He might have been the last one I got
I had one of those guys too
Ohhh]
I can feel my hair falling out.
"I was born in 2004"
I enjoyed it!
But I still played it a bunch
I don't see anything wrong with it
I intended the gameplay at the start to me more of an intro, but it does seem a bit long for that in retrospect.
I can see that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N235ejDwIVY
I tried my hand at video editing for the first time ever, and I would appreciate your opinions on how I did. I spent literal hours on this while learning the software and features and looking up countless tutorials and the like, so I hope it's okay.

<@!266379640069685252> Looking great! Only I notice that looks off is the fact that you anti-aliased the axe blades but not the handle. Other than that you're doing great for just starting out! Better than I did when I started, lol

I thought sentai was the name of the genre with the people in suits
Ohhh
Isn't Kamen Rider a sentai?
What's Zi-O?
I can see it
LMAO
Looks like a sentai suit
Neat
How'd you do that? Looks great
You should! It looks really promising!
You gonna digitize it?
Looking great!
Got any other interesting facts about them?
So he's generally pretty easygoing, then
Modeled after yourself, or more factionalized/fantastical than that?
If you had to describe their personality, what would you go with?
<@!457268466429329429> I really like your OC's design!

YOOO
That's the one!
The toenail one was real because it was post-movie Spongebob and post-movie Spongebob generally sucks ass.
The jellyfish net one I posted.
This isn't an actual screen from the show. Someone redrew it.

For real though, Amiya. I love this li'l guy's design.

Here‚Äôs what I have so far!
<@237964037898502144> You inspired me to try and do modeling for the first time!
Yeah! I tried it out and imported my face into Godot.
Lemme check the App Store.
Maybe? I‚Äôve heard Android devs have a hard time with piracy. Maybe that‚Äôs related?
I didn‚Äôt know there was a trial version.
Yeah it's $15 by default.
On top of the $15 I already payed?
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
There's a full version?
Look at his high-poly ass.
Here it is normally
<@237964037898502144> I checked and figured out that mine had modifiers too
Yeah.
Like CADD modeling?
Yeah, I could never manage to do stuff with individual polygons.
They're displayed for me, don't worry.
Brain smol.
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I've only been modeling for two days so i know literally nothing about techniques or terminology.
What do you mean?
Like if you had carved a rough model out of foam.
I told Lily this but it looked like, uh
I wish I had gotten a pic of how weird it looked before I started doing the detailing.
Yep! I used a side drawing and a front drawing i did to make an almost Minecraftian-looking cube dude, lol.
Using photo references to make 2D references to make 3D references
<:towel:634957217795276801>
Carving out a rough model with drawing references helps so fucking much.
<@!237964037898502144> Yeah I started out with a literal cube, haha. So far all I've done is take some old-ass anatomy studies I made and carve out a cube into a rough shape like the top half, then shape and smooth it like the bottom half.
Not even closed to finishing, but I wanted to share it just so I have a reference for progress.

Would you mind DMing me a ballpark estimate/breakdown?

Like this

Gimme a sec
Lemme see if I can explain better
I understand that. You'll still probably want to round out the edges of the circles. As it stands now, the curves on the cardinal sides are too sharp.

It would really help with the geometry
<@457268466429329429> Have you tried perspective lines/loops?
If these are too close to the old versions I can remove them
Sorry for the reposts. I revisited both of these and touched them up since I wasn‚Äôt entirely happy with them. Wanted to share the updated versions since they‚Äôre hopefully better. They should be less blurry and have better contrast and less obvious editing trickery.
I can help when I get back from work

made the mistake of giving him too fat an ass but because I only started learning to scout on Monday I have no idea how to fix it without fuckijg up the other parts of the model

second thing I‚Äôm currently working on
learning to 3d sculpt
Crunchy
If you wanna send me the model tomorrow I can take a look at it
There‚Äôs a dropdown on the modifier that says ‚Äúapply‚Äù or something similar and that bakes the changes
Have you committed the subdivides?

<:LotteFear:865745707218763816>
What program do you use for modeling?
Unity feels like a ticking time bomb nowadays.
Or, if you don‚Äôt want to code at all, you could try visual scripting in UE I suppose
I'd probably try something like Godot first
I don‚Äôt recommend Unity because it‚Äôs run by ghouls

<@237964037898502144> I used Nomad for modeling and them clean them up in Blender.
It is easily the best free piece of software I've ever used.
My go-to sculpting program is Nomad Sculpt but Blender and ZBrush are great too.
Still kind limited though.
They've gotten better.
Both Blender and Maya had them so I assumed it was standard for the big ones.
Oh for real?
Not hard surface
Polygonal, I mean
Are you sculpting or doing hard surface modeling?
lol
Never mind!
I have no experience with that!
Looking great! Is this Maya?
Love the style.
<:biglove:829994825423650827>
Everyone is having it at once.
We just had this for dinner the other day.
<:lottefear:826620179706413077>
But they added an update where you can paint it at a high mesh density, bake the texture, and then apply it to a low-poly mesh.
The biggest downside to Nomad was the fact that up until recently it only supported vertex shading.
Yeah! Regular painting or texture/PBR painting.
I did about half of it on my phone and half on my tablet.
Nomad Sculpt. It‚Äôs like Zbrush but for iOS and Android.
Working on texturing my Model 3 revolver.
Smh that‚Äôs not how you play video games
Why‚Äôs that

No no, like do you use the hard surface modeling tools or the sculpting tools?
what tool do you use to do a majority of your modeling?
although now its further along

<@266379640069685252> heres the model I was working on that you asked about
i do kind of miss the splattered paint effect on the shoes tho
BEEG
This is fantastic!
im a sucker for painterly cell shading
since youre going for a sort of painterly texture on the grass, it'd look nice if you could add a similar effect to the rocks
looks rad
and you made these assets yourself?
ayyy
i just think its important to be extra careful with ocs because theyre someones passion project

Fuck yeah
because aside from the outline thing it looks really good

I can‚Äôt speak for Ikxi, but most of the stuff that happens in fancontent is spoilered fanfic discussion so it‚Äôs not a super good place to look for fanart.

And again, your whole point is moot because you can reuse filament if you really want to
lol
It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôd be able to anyway since you have to destroy them to make new ones
Holding a tangible object in your hands is much different than looking at a photo of a tangible object even if it‚Äôs an accurate recreation.
It doesn‚Äôt even have to be interactive my man. Looking at a DaVinci painting in person is infinitely cooler than looking up a photo online, for example.
And you could watch a video of a game but it wouldn‚Äôt be the same as experiencing it yourself.
So technically you could reuse that to an extent too.
And you know you can get filament recycled into new filament right?
Would you rather have an intricate statue or a photograph of an intricate statue? At least with a painting or photograph you don‚Äôt have to destroy the original work.
‚ÄúHere Jimmy, have this photograph of an Xbox Series X for Christmas‚Äù
We should just take pictures of things instead
Yeah man why do we even have sculptures
Not without destroying your previous work.
lol
It‚Äôd be cheaper to buy a whole-ass 3D printer and print a model than make one with legos.
Well, old days at least.

Because Lego is comically expensive

Haha, I don't think it's anything to worry about.
Biden said "poor kids are just as smart as white kids" or something similar.

Probably a good sign!
Haha
Yeesh
You guys here are all super nice and friendly so I just assumed the Symphogear community in general was like that.
That's a shame.
||Valk||?
Like it doesn't seem problematic at all?
I feel like settling for a self-diagnosis and not getting professional help is trivializing the serious struggles people with legitimate mental illness go through though, right?
It was a big thing I saw on Tumblr and Twitter.
There's a vast difference between someone using self-diagnoses as a way to give their doctor a better idea of what you're dealing with and playing mental illness dress up on the TL.
I'm talking about the kind of people on social media who base their entire online presence on being neurodivergent and then have "self-diagnosed" in their bio.
Yeah, exactly.
Pardon?
The problem with self-diagnosing is there's far too many complications for some person with literally no mental health training to know what they have from an hour on Google. So some person with something severe like bipolar or major depressive disorder may misdiagnose themselves with something less serious like SAD or the like, and someone with something comparatively less severe walks away thinking they have paranoid schizophrenia or a personality disorder.
I also dislike it when people self-diagnose themselves with all sorts of mental illnesses and ND stuff and then use that as a crutch to fall back on when someone says something they dislike. Like ???

I live with this crap daily and wouldn't wish it on literally anyone, and these people are romanticizing it like it was a summer fashion accessory. Like how bored and privileged do you have to be to pretend to have a serious mental disorder online?
No bullying!
I mean god had free reign for a good while and that got us the Dark Ages.

So they'd be people who don't believe in the Hindu pantheon but still practice the traditions and holidays and stuff?
That's pretty cool.
So it's more of a belief-lax, tradition-heavy religion then.
Ah, I'd heard there can be infighting in Hindu communities. Is that because of the broad spectrum of beliefs? Like how different sects of Christianity fight over interpretations and traditions and stuff.
Are Hindus allowed to use animal byproducts if the animal died of old age or natural causes?
Ohhh, so it's more about tradition, then.
I love learning about different countries and stuff!
Again, I'm not trying to come across as prying or anything. This kind of stuff is just genuinely fascinating.
Is that kind of like how Jewish people can't mix milk products with meat?
Also, why would eggs be debated? They're animal byproducts, but they're not fertilized so they'd be incapable of sustaining life, right? If that makes sense.
I love veggies and meat substitutes but I'd die without my yoghurt and cheese.
I can get behind lacto vegetarianism!
Sorry if I come across super ignorant. I grew up as a strict catholic and went to awful parochial schools so we didn't learn much about other cultures.
I was under the impression it was strict veganism.
Ohhh.
Does that include oxen for Manuel labor?
What kind of usefulness do cows have? I can think of milk, meat, and leather, but those would all go against the vegetarian/non-violent nature of Hinduism.
Also Dashavatara and Vishnu
Ah, Shiva! That was it.
Oh, no. Like a mental image.
God, I have an image on the tip of my tongue, too.
No I'm just stupid.
Hindus are the large Indian sect that holds cows sacred, right?
As someone who lives near both Mormon and Jehova's Witness churches, I can appreciate that.
I didn't mean to distract from your discussion
Oh shit, I'm sorry
Does Hinduism have any food-centric holidays like Thanksgiving? Because those are my favorite holidays, haha.
I guess they never miss, huh
Don't worry, I knew what you meant.
Yep, commonalities!
East Asia or Europe or the americas?
Do Hindus in other parts of the world have a tendency to ascribe to certain sects, or is it just as open in like
I was always under the impression it was a strict set of beliefs like the Abrahamic religions.
Tarring and feathering is pretty American
Hey Shem remember how when you and I were kids and felt bad about being gay and now we *aren't* trying to take away the healthcare of vulnerable people? Wild.
I think it's more the combination of that clip *and* his awful stances on LGBT+ healthcare

Ah, fair enough.
Yeah
I'm not familiar with the Indian political climate. What's going on over there?
I apologize in advance for the ignorance, as I've only become active in the LGBT+ community very recently. But does L-T mean you were assigned male at birth, identify as a woman, and like women?
Ah.
Are you LGBT as well?
I appreciate the solidarity by the way, Saki!
And *especially* the trans community.
Although unfortunately it's much more frontloaded to the LG half than the BT half.
Although I do, at some level, appreciate that it's becoming so accepted.
Yeah, a lot of this LGBT solidarity stuff from brands is incredibly tacky, admittedly.

I just mean he shouldn't feel the need to come out sooner than he's ready, if he even ends up being LGBT+ at all.
Of course, if it means putting your lifeline I jeopardy, I can see why you'd be hesitant.

Yeah.
I wouldn't.
Neither my brother and me have any interest in children and it's pretty obvious that makes my parents uncomfortable.
My family is in a very similar position.
Ah, that's what I figured.
Also, I wouldn't jump on Fizz. It's entirely possible he comes from somewhere where "siring a male child to carry on the bloodline" or some dumb shit is engrained in the culture.
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt lol
You guys included, of course!
Since I had friends in high school who were trans and bi before I even realized I was LGBT+, seeing the dislike for them in some of the LGBT+ communities really hurt. Thankfully though, it seems like I just ran into some bad apples during the time, as the majority of people I've met online since have been absolutely wonderful!
If I'm being honest, a lot of the Ace/Trans/Bi arguments really turned me off from the LGBT community for most of my high school/college life, so I've only been active in it for a year or two.
Sorry
Ah, okay!

It reminds me of the H1N1 panic a decade back or so. They ended up getting that under control, but people were out of control.
Like, for the vast majority of people, AKA not the elderly and the immunocompromised, there's a much, much, much lower chance of complications. And so far half the people who've gotten sick have recovered safely. That's not to say it's not a problem, but it's become so sensationalized that's it's actively undermining the cause and hurting people.
I'm just saying that declaring it isn't necessarily a solely positive thing.
I'm not disagreeing with them declaring it, for the record.
And that just leads to people bilking money from people who don't actually need the supplies.
The way people are reacting you'd think it was the zombie apocalypse. Like there are people spending God-knows-how-much-money on supplies rather than just washing their hands and not touching their face.
Panicking isn't taking it seriously. People buying up masks and food and supplies is so obscenely out of proportion that it's affecting people that genuinely need the supplies.
In fact, it's probably going to be spun as another reason to panic.
Honestly, the news media and social media has the public in such a tizzy that I doubt this will reassure them at all

Nara, I think you're misinterpreting "needs to contract" as "we should make them contract". I think it's pretty clear he meant "in order for herd immunity to kick in, it would have to reach 60%". Not that he proposes we should all get together and spit on one another until we get to a 60% infection rate.

Everyone would have to be okay with that kind of content regardless
It's pretty tasteless, but I guess it would all depend on who is in the server and if that's something they're comfortable with. If it's more of an "anything goes" server or with a group of friends who are comfortable with it I guess it's fine, anywhere else I don't think it's a good idea.

Hmmm
If what you're saying about your current school being pretty terrible is true, then the investment would most likely be worth it, right?
If your parents can afford it, there's nothing to feel bad about. If you're worried about it stretching their money thin, you can always bring it up with them.

He's venting about something that bothered him?
The earth isn't flat?

No everything must stay the way it was when I grew up forever
(Sesquipedalian is a long word that describes a long word)
I didn't mean to come across as dismissive or anything, for the record.
I think I've got it, then.
Oh, okay!
Or do you mean it's considered default, basically?
Wait
But then how do you distinguish the trans part?
Oh
Wyatdo you call people who are just into trans people because they're their gender of preference though
Like gay was before it was reclaimed?
<@!99695384296701952> What is the difference between transsexual and transgender?
I went to a very nice high school in terms of sex ed, thankfully. Especially because I went to a private parochial school my entire life and had no fucking clue what anything sex related was.
I don't get why seemingly a lot of LGBT people don't consider the B and T valid. Like surely everyone should be in this together, right?
What is bang bang
Like I actively resisted realizing I was bi until very recently because a lot of the LGBT people I met during high school and college were really judgmental. I think if I had met people like you guys before I would have realized much sooner.
I do remember you telling me about that
Transmedical is truscum?
Ohhh
Wait, who is "!!"?
Is HRT surgery?
Ohhh, okay
What are those?
Like bi erasure and calling you an asshole just for not knowing stuff about the community.
I'm really glad I met my LGBT friends now.
It wasn't until I met a lot of LGBT people online that I realized they weren't all rude people.
I didn't get involved in LGBT issues until very recently, because all the LGBT people I met in high school and college were assholes.
I thought it meant transgender, yeah.
I never realized that
That's like

This sucks ass

What do you mean, Emily?
If memory serves she came out as gay after same sex marriage was legalized.
I remember my sex ed teacher got really serious when someone made a gay joke one time. She went into a detailed rant about staying safe as a gay person in regards to stuff like AIDS/HIV and gay issues. She was really chill.
Oh, we went full spectrum.
I did not realize I posted it in the wrong channel until just now, lol
Wow, i'm sorry
lol, Moss
Yup
The closest we can do is find a system that works as efficiently as possible for as many people as possible.
As much as I'd wish otherwise, no political system will ever be overwhelmingly effective just because humans are incredibly flawed and often can't be trusted in positions of power.
Ah, that's true Whiskey. I didn't mean to imply that certain political stances weren't objectionable, just that you can have good political policies and still be a terrible person.
There are people I agree with politically that I hate with a passion and people I don't that I like a lot. And while it's true that certain policies and groups and cliques are favored by assholes, I wouldn't let that dissuade you from trying to find a place that you fit in.
Eh, associate with whoever you feel you align with most. People are assholes no matter what end or gradient of the political spectrum they're on.
Reopening pushed back, I take it?
I'll still be lurking if you need me.

I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that a large amount of people are able to discern behavior that should emulated versus fictional behavior that, regardless of it's context in said fiction, shouldn't be. Like oftentimes the people you see parroting negative behavior from stuff like that are just people who sucked in the first place.

At the end of the day, Carols, I think it's fine if you enjoy the show so long as you understand that it's not a healthy outlook for the show to have.
Iunno, it felt like they were trying to make him sympathetic with his self-sacrifice at the end.
I don't think so, personally? Ver is just as poorly written IMO.
Oh
No I meant stuff like it actively encouraging Hibiki to forgive her shitheel failure of a father, or that beating children is good, Iski.
Like Ver and the like
That's a good point. Geah promotes a lot of shitty things, but it's still fine to enjoy the show as a whole.
Also it's not like slavery is considered an A-OK thing in Japan, lol
But the show in question was written now and not in the 1700s?
I mean to be fair, everyone doing it doesn't absolve it of being shitty.

Pardon?
Thanks for pointing that out.

It's entirely possible that you just haven't had a breakthrough moment like that yet.
If it's suburban/rural, then it could just be that you don't know a lot of people IRL to bounce experiences off of. Like for example, I went from a puny Christian middle school to one of the largest, most well-funded public high schools in my state. I got more useful life experiences in my freshman year than I did my entire stay at Christian school.
Maryland is an absolutely wonderful state, though! I'd live there if it wasn't so expensive.
Oh, no I meant like urban/suburban/rural
If you don't mind me asking, where do you live, Lectric?
You're basically trading different responsibilities for new ones as life goes on.
It's not a cakewalk, but childhood isn't either.
That's because nobody generally vents about positive stuff.
Naaah. Any part of life you enjoy is the worthwhile part of life. I absolutely hated my childhood and I'm much happier now than I ever was then!
Yup!
Believe me, Lectric, you've got plenty of time. I had absolutely no social experience until I was almost 20.
Yeah yeah don‚Äôt carrot stuff I forgot. üòî
I don't like getting into specifics with the person I was in the past, but just know that's I've been in much the same situation as you are currently in, and it gets better! I know that probably doesn't sound like much, but I genuinely mean it. You're a good, well-meaning kid.
Not sure why I said age thirty.
I am
If I was able to basically turn my personality/health/and social life around at age 22, there's no way in hell you can't make the most of things at age fourteen.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that having a good childhood, while a blessing, is overrated. There are just as many opportunities to be happy and grow as an adult as there are when you're a kid or young teen!
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
You can do it, Aya!
You need to be as blunt as possible.
I'd definitely go with Aya on this one.
Still a timely coincidence.
Although he spelled his with a K so I'm not sure if that counts.
You're the second of my online friends who've turned out to be a Cameron today.
WTF
You mean your name is Lectric?
Wait
Really, really gross.
I would 100% consider this guilt tripping.
Yeah, definitely.
Yes, very much what Melua said.
I mean, I was as well.
I'm not saying you're butthurt?
Also, you needn't get so defensive, Aria. We weren't criticizing you for not understanding, we were criticizing you for being insensitive.
Invasive, I guess?
Just feels like
I'd prefer we didn't talk about people in other Discords behind their backs, tbh.
Definitely. I had to cut off a friend for the exact situation you're in Lectric. I know it's not easy, but if they persist than that's a pretty good indication that they don't value your autonomy and just see you as some sort of prize to be won with perseverance.
This relationship is very one-sided and not healthy.
Or at the very least, taking a break from talking with them for a while.
Still, if they keep pressing you on this relationship crap, you *really* need to consider cutting them out of your life.
That's still creepy, but not nearly as bad.
Friends respect other friends' boundaries, Lectric.
Press them on it.
They did, yes.
Hey, that's creepy.
You can't keep hanging around people who don't respect your boundaries enough to leave well enough alone.
Lectric, there's a point where you need to give someone who isn't respecting your boundaries an ultimatum. They either need to respect your comfort zone or they need to leave.
So that would probably help Aria a lot.
It used to be called DDNOS for "dissociative disorders not otherwise specified".
Oh, that's actually exactly what it is, after a quick google search. Hell, OSDD used to use the same naming scheme as PDD-NOS.
She does, my apologies.
Oh, do they?
Is OSDD to DID what PDD-NOS is to the autism spectrum? That might help explain it to Aria since he's on the autism spectrum himself.
DID and its sub-diagnoses are often the result of the person's brain trying to handle a traumatic event, right?
I'll try to be more careful with how I phrase stuff in the future so I don't cause any undue offense.
Sorry, Kaiyo. Didn't mean to drag you into this too.
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
Take a breather and come back when you feel better, buddy.
It can be exhausting, I know.
We like having you around.
Please don't, Aria.
For the record, Aria, I also have Aspergers/ASD. I know how hard it can be to find the right words for a given situation. Oftentimes things don't come out the way you mean them. That's why I was trying to help explain why the way you phrased it could be problematic. I'll try to word it better next time.
Which is why she explained it to you, Aria.
Preferably you wouldn't use *any* synonym of weird as a descriptor of neurodivergence or mental health issues.
For insensitive or weird?
And I apologize for being so hypocritical.
Just as the way you phrased what you said could be seen as hurtful as well.
But I can see how you'd take offense to the way I worded it
Aria, trust me. I'm not a good person. If I were using vinegar, you'd know. I consider you a friend, and wouldn't intentionally hurt you.
I know you have a hard time with social skills. That's why I wanted to let you know how you were coming across so that you could avoid it in the future.
I'm genuinely just trying to help.
Saying "that thing you said could be taken as insensitive" is not the same thing as saying "you are insensitive."
Aria, I really need you to understand.
I have a hard time with self control
SORRY
And you're 15/16 right?
This is getting a bit mentally overwhelming for me, so I'm going to dip out.
Yup.
That's reeeaaally shitty.
Definitely.
Definitely.
Also yes, tell him exactly that.
That reeks of guilt tripping.
Mmm, don't like that.
I can see that being an issue as well.
Hmmm.
Sargon, Molyneux, etc
Because he's directly quoting far-right YouTubers, lmao
This is what happens when you let YouTube raise your children because you're too lazy to.
<@227652825876922378> <:Zababies:672238628398956594>
He very much knows what he's doing and continues to push anyway.
Dense implies he doesn't know what he's doing.
I don't think dense is the right word.
NGL Lectric this dude sounds like he's just a few steps short of digging through your trash to find used underwear to sniff.
Provided you're talking about the creepy dude who won't stop haranguing you.
I mean yeah
**NO.**
Doubt
We're really stretching the definition of "better" here
Biden is so moderate that Trump is actually managing to convince voters that he's to the left of him I just dnscjjvkelslsman
"So which senile pervert are you voting for this election?"
Libs did literally the exact same thing in '16 and were like
Who is corbyn
Wait that's Boris
Is Corbyn the PM with the bad wig
Because they sound almost as fucked as ours
Is it? I know nothing about U.K. politics and I do not care to.
Good question
lol
Biden is just handing these assholes free ammo, holy shit
Lib dems have absolutely fucked us
"He may not remember, but we do."
Good lord, we are absolutely fucked. 
https://twitter.com/TeamTrump/status/1263945266723356672
Why do all the great powers have to be incorrigible assholes
Wipe us off the face of the earth. Our species is too dumb to live.
COVID has sapped my faith in humanity.

So raw numbers mean jack shit if the electoral college still votes Trump.
But we don't exist in a democracy. We exist in a democratic republic.
She did beat him in nearly every poll!
And Hillary didn't?
If the democrats had spent anywhere near as much effort on fighting Trump as they did fighting Bernie, Trump wouldn't be absolutely crushing Biden's wrinkly skull in like a grape right now.
Exactly
People are **still** toting around false stats on how it's "no worse than the flu"
We didn't get to the number one death toll in the world by being proactive now, did we?
That's why we're in the awful spot that we are.
It was a serious problem. The government just did not treat it as such.
COVID happened in the US as early as February
Again, younger people were also generally more well-informed on the risk of COVID, and the establishment did everything they could to make it so you had to vote in person.
Are you really surprised young people aren't voting when neither political party cares about their issues and actively dismissed them?
People in general voted way less in the primary because they didn't want to catch COVID, haha
A ton of young people turned up to vote for Bernie, what do you mean?
Young voters aren't going to vote for Biden because he does not represent their values. I am absolutely shocked.
Because moderate boomers are the Dems primary voter base.
Biden is literally not left in any form, lol
lolnope
Voting for Biden is a sign to the dems that you will vote for literally any of their future candidates no matter how far right they lean.
Cringe
Exactly.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
I can't in good conscience vote for either of them, honestly. If it was another useless Dem moderate I definitely would, but the dude is an absolutely terrible person and I would regret voting for him ever day he was in office.
The shitty part of me hopes that Trump absolutely crushes Biden and it shatters the Democratic Party.
OR, the dems will just keep moving further and further right and people will keep voting for them for the sole reason that they don't have an (R) next to their name.
If the moderate Supreme Court nominee still votes republican on issues, how is that any better?
Still instantly recognizable
Completely different face, unique fully modeled clothes

Compare that to something like this Demon Slayer or whatever it's called Nendo
And here's one without the glasses.

Here's their Lotte Jansson Nendo, for example.
Compare this to something like Nendoroids. They have the same brand style, but they also make it look like the source material.
Which would be fine, if they weren't literally the only option for figure merch available for certain series.
Because to them, they want to appeal to the collectors. And the best way of doing that is approaching the IP with as much conformity to *Funko's* brand as possible, not the original brand.
Ugly face, low detail, oversized head, looks nothing like the games.

Now here's the Funko Pop! version of Cuphead.
They keep the same style and recognizable art direction as the game they came from, and they look really good.
These are not Funko Pops, just regular Funkos.
Here's what I always use as an example:
The problem with that is that it almost always comes at the cost of the characters looking like they do in their original series.
Their trademark ugly, dead-eyed look is done to literally every figure because it's cheap and makes the Funko Pop brand easier to identify.
Another reason people dislike them is that Funko puts their own brand recognition before they IP's.
They're generally a cheap option, yes. But they're also frequently the only option.
With Funko Pops you don't get that.
<@!302063351767498752> A good way to think of it is that oftentimes there will be different types of merchandise. There'll be cheap figures, expensive figures, model kits, action figures, etc.
With my state, I mean.
I've already confirmed that I'm registered for the election.
I fully intend to cast a protest vote
I said I was not voting for Biden, not that was not voting at all
You don't catch the young voters' interest by running a candidate that goes against literally all their beliefs, lmao
That is such a huge jump in logic and I cannot wrap my head around it
How on earth do you think that voting for a right-leaning person will make dems think "why yes, we **should** run more left leaning candidates"
**Thank you,** Rad.
I do not have to vote for a senile molester just because he is slightly better than another senile molester.
This may surprise you, Iski, but Biden is not owed votes just because he's not Trump.
Relevant, rather
Because it's prudent, haha
Because he's even farther right than Hillary, Rad
If the moderates cared as much about moderate dems as Biden supporters claim they do, they wouldn't have voted for Trump in '16.
It's not that hard
Hillary got taken down because she was also a bad pick, lol
Biden deserves all the doubt and criticism he gets. If Biden can't beat possibly the worst President to ever exist, then that says something.
Hillary largely did as well, though.
I mean the product quality is very good
Although you could very easily make the case that stuff Warhammer is consumerist, since the lore is built entirely around selling the latest and greatest model kits.
A product being labeled as consumerist is generally use to describe a very cynical, low effort product designed to be as cheap and marketable as possible.
Exactly.
They games don't have to be good or different. They just have to be new, and quality be damned.
It's also low quality and filled with microtransactions
Now compare it to something like FIFA or Madden, where they pump one out every year for full price so that they can get $60 for a "new" game that's almost identically mechanical to the previous game.
It's not consumerist because there's effort involved and it's not made specifically to bilk whales.
There are a ton of unique video game experiences like indie games and AA games.
For example, Lectric, think of video games.
Whales is a very good term.
Exactly.
It's quantity over quality.
Funko puts the collectibility of their own brand before that of the IP's because they want people to collect them.
It's entirely related.
Just be yourself!
You don't have to pretend to be happy all the time

That is 100% not going to happen, Lectric.
Meanwhile let's players can use slurs and nobody cares
Like there was some makeup tutorial dude who got fucking spitroasted just because he recommended some makeup other than one his friend made
Some content  creators get away with so much it's insane
Eugh
Did Keem repeatedly mock him when he was suicidal?
> "He was willing to pay A$5,000 if it was 'really good'," the judge said.
lmao
Doesn't matter if it's clear as day or foggy as hell. The Justice system protects their own.
I‚Äôll admit I haven‚Äôt know you as long as Kaiyo or Haru, but you‚Äôve never struck me as bitter. You‚Äôve always been super friendly, at least to me.
You specifically, or all of you?
Would it be possible for ask the others for help? I know Haru has trouble with that sort of thing, but if it‚Äôs starting to affect *your* health this much would any of the others be willing or able to take a load off your shoulders at least every now and again?
I know I‚Äôm late but I just want to echo Shemmy and Ardan. If we let our worst days define us then everyone would be absolutely terrible. It‚Äôs important to remember your past transgressions so you can learn from them, but if you let them just sit there and fester in the back of your mind they‚Äôll eat you alive
It happening in the first place isn‚Äôt ethical, but moving past it is part of the healing process. Especially if the person forgives you. That doesn‚Äôt mean to repeat it, obviously, but if you‚Äôve learned from it then moving on is fine.
I‚Äôm not going to begrudge someone for having a bad day
Existing? Being human?
Iunno how to describe it
That‚Äôs just part of like
Part of keeping semi-regular contact with people is that sometimes you catch them in bad moods.

You touch their butt
I‚Äôm really glad I got to meet all of you.

I appreciate the suggestions, by the way
I know it probably seems weird when I‚Äôm cis, lol
Maybe I‚Äôm just being overly sensitive, Iunno
For the record, I mean no offense to trans people. I‚Äôm not trying to say that trans people aren‚Äôt valid or that I don‚Äôt support it. There are a ton of trans people in this server and I love ‚Äòem a bunch. But it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve taken umbrage with
I just don‚Äôt know how to tell them it‚Äôs kind of offensive to me without seeming rude or unappreciative.
I was assigned male at birth and I‚Äôm perfectly comfortable with that even though I appreciate stuff like fashion and makeup and liked ostensibly ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù activities when I was younger.
Like they think they know me better than *I* know me
Condescending, almost?
Iunno
I genuinely appreciate that they care about me and want to help, but it‚Äôs just like
Like saying stuff like ‚Äúdamn, you like X feminine thing? Have you ever explored possibly being trans?‚Äù
One of the few (kinda) toxic things I dislike about the LGBT community is how quickly they label stuff as trans. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just a meme or anything for the record, but assuming it‚Äôs not the community seems to label people as trans just for liking non-trad masculine/feminine things. Like I like a lot of stuff that‚Äôs traditionally feminine and I‚Äôve had people assume I‚Äôm trans just based on that. I fully understand that they‚Äôre just trying to be supportive, and I genuinely appreciate that they‚Äôd consider me valid no matter what gender I‚Äôd choose, but it feels almost insulting to have them immediately question my gender that I‚Äôm quite comfortable with.
What happened
that's really6 admirable

I"m sorry you had to go threough that, buddy
Ah, okay
What's does CWm ean?
i hope you feel better soon, kaiyo
At the end of the day you can't help these people if you yourself arent in the proper mental state for it
I'd encourange regular breaks, even
It's genuinerly admirable that you're helping people like this, even if you need a break every so often
if it were easy, anyone could do it
It's reassurting that there are people out there helping them like you do
Alot of times people don't take mental health seriously enough
You did the right thing, if it makes you feel any better
God fucking dammit I need to slow down my typing
taht just seems neglectful
ifd they have dementia, isn't sending them to a hospital what you *should* do? whyu would your boss want to send him in a taxi?

Wait, was Ten around first or something?

Oh, like rolls
Or was that Ten?
Wait, I thought Voy made NSFW jokes all the time
And provided you have the means, of course. I don't know what the situation is like over there, but over here it can be both difficult and expensive
I'd definitely recommend it if you think you need it and don't go already

For real though, it's really good to see that Voy and Ten made up their differences. They're really wholesome together.
*Unlike a couple certain someones who used to haunt one another, <@!486087033652248576>.*
That honestly really surprises me, because when we've interacted you‚Äôve always come across as being really cohesive. Like at the very least, all your members seem to do a good job of cooperating.
Well in the end you should do whatever suits your own lifestyle best!
Haha, fair enough!
Do you ever take time out of your day to sort of take a moment of introspection and try to sort things out, or does it just kind of come to you as you go about your day?
It could also help to come up with ways of labeling each of yourselves temporarily until you can come up with concrete names or packets of identity for you. Like ‚Äúso-and-so likes X things and dislikes Y things‚Äù or ‚ÄúX person and Y person share A, B, and C as common interests‚Äù. Like I said, I have no experience with plurality, so I‚Äôm just trying to repurpose techniques my shrink talked to me about for stuff like this
Haha, I know that feeling
Have you considered keeping a diagram or chart of sorts to help you sort yourselves out easier? Like those brainstorming charts they made you do in middle school to map out your ideas in a way that ordered all the loose ideas and feelings in your head
Keep on trucking, Emily. I know you can do it!
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
I know this probably doesn‚Äôt mean much coming from some random internet denizen you‚Äôve never met IRL, but from what I've seen you're all incredibly strong people. Hell, you‚Äôve put up with stuff that many people would balk at and you‚Äôre still going. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt underestimate yourselves.
Ohhh, okay
Hi Kaiyo
What does that mean in English

Boomers hate their wives because society pressured them into unhappy relationships when they were young and then shamed them for getting a divorce, so they're too prideful to just admit when their relationship fails and split up.
I have no doubt you'll find someone, Rad. You're a cool, genuine dude and people appreciate that.
Also, what's the context for the convo? I wanna help but it seems to go back really really far
I just meant that it's possible.
It happens all the time for me and I've know my friends for the better part of a decade.
> and yeah, social anxiety doesn't show up as much when you know someone well
I'm a moron
Fuck you're right Aria
Hey everyone!
I mean, I am 100% worse off because of my mental illnesses.
Aria's on them big mood vibes
Honestly if I could 100% rid myself of my crippling disabilities I would do it.
Take care, Emily. DM mew if you still need to talk. <:Zababies:672238628398956594>
I am who I am in *spite* of my diagnoses, not because of them.
Yeah, same Aria. It's perfectly fine to be comfortable with yourself and proud of who you are in spite of any mental illnesses you may have. But treating it's also possible to get treatment at the same time. My mental illnesses don't define my personality and I don't think any less of people who have them either.
Me treating my Aspergers doesn't make me any less me, if that makes sense.
I see it as the equivalent of any other mental illness or neurodivergency. I wouldn't stop treating my bipolar because it's "ripping apart my established personality." I didn't want to treat my Aspergers before either, but actually treating it improved my life tenfold.
I think you guys are confused as to what Aria means. She's not saying she's less valuable than other people because of her disabilities, but that it actively gets in the way of her living her life the way she wants to.
Hey Aria, DM me real quick and we can talk about it.
Ayy, calm down Aria. No need to get so heated.
Meiyiii
Iunno, I can‚Äôt imagine OSDD affecting that sort of thing but Iunno how anti-discrimination laws work in the UK.
What the fuck.
Do you have to disclose diagnoses to employers in the UK or some shit?
Hugs
I have
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
Everything okay, Rei?
Wait, did I miss something?
Damn. I guess I‚Äôm just unlucky.
<@!605753436763586573> This probably sounds like a really stupid question but do you have any experience with decreased libido with risperidone? It fucking spiked mine into the dirt so I was curious if it was a common side effect.
I was worried you guys regretted coming out as plural to us
Oh, good
She said about how they should have shut up
Oh, I meant Meiyi.
In general or for your therapists, you mean?
That you are schizophrenic
I very much doubt
Damn, that last one's a real kicker. I don‚Äôt have it myself but I‚Äôm part of a mental health support group with someone that has it and I know it can't be easy for you.
Just keep being you, self-perceived warts and all. That‚Äôs all we'll ask of you here, buddy.
<a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936>
<@!605753436763586573>
No thoughts head empty
Thought you meant like a butt lift
I
Oh
‚ÄúBottom surgery‚Äù?
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
I‚Äôm sure you guys will be fine
As for therapy for DID/OSDD, all the resources I‚Äôve seen about it just seemed to suggest is was for addressing the underlying trauma and not the presence of the actual alters.
I don‚Äôt think there are any medications for DID. I don‚Äôt think it's considered necessary to treat with meds.
What diagnosis are you worried about, anyway?
So at the very least, you guys have us!
All of ya
I‚Äôm glad you guys exist
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Pretty creepy ngl
Looks like something out of a sci-fi novel.
League has been defeated
Because we all know the US government would never associate with former Nazis.
I'm not gointg to post an example of who I was before, but if you genuinely want to know and would be able to forgive me, I can DM you an example of how I used to be
As recently as 2018 even
Was much more recently that that.
This
When I was talking with my shrink and had the revelation that suicidal ideation could be as insignificant as thinkg "i wish I didn't wake up tomorrow"
2005 was the first time I had suicidal thoughts. I didn't understand the full extent of it until much, much late.
I'm 25, but I've struggled with mental illness since I was 10 or so
I made it to a point where's I'm happy with who i am
But after so, so much soul-searching and support for my family and friends
Like genuinely horrible
I used to be a terrible person
I genuinely don't know why this song is so comforting to me
That's probably really stupid to most people, but it meant the world to me
Like "if I die I won't be able to see how it ends"
There was a point in my life when the only things keeping me alive were waiting for the newest Little Witch Academia episode or video game I was excited for
Hugs aren't necessary, but they're still very much appreciated
lol
Listening to this song really makes me thankful that I failed, in a way.
Failing felt awful at the time, but I'm eternally grateful that I fucked it up and was able to meet such amazing friends.
It feels vaguely triumphant in a way.
Listening to this song really makes me thankful that I failed, in a way.
It's very bittersweet
It just feels, like
Iunno
Like it's all worth it in the ends
Like if I've made even the smallest positive impact in the life of anyone I've waved to, or smiled at, or even just comforting when they're at a low point, I feel like my life was truly worth it./
repost from another sertver but I just wanted y'all to know how much you guys mean to me
CW, suicide: ||I found this song recently and it really hits close to home. I almost committed suicide twice between high school and getting my shit together in college, and this song really feels comforting. Knowing I survived that period in my life with the help on my friends, including you guys, makes me really thankful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4ptxPCnhuE||
Glad to hear it, buddy!\
<@!263983345669505025> <:Zababies:672238628398956594>
<@!99695384296701952> For the record, I was much worse than an edgelord. I was genuinely, truly an awful human being.
Even now, I don't know if I'm a good person
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
If you had told 22 year old me that people would genuinely consider me a friend an that I would be positive influence on their lives, I wouldn't have believed you.
Honestly, I still have relapses. Thankfully not here, but it does happen. Thankfully I worked up the courage to talk to my parents about it and now here i am, many medications and therapy session later
And I am all the better for it
But my journey has been long, painful, and absolutely soul-crushing
And I don't deserve to be
and I know I'll never truly be forgiven for it
I don't think i agree, but your guys' support means the world to me. I've burned bridges with friends that I've had for years
Here, I'll message you Rad
I'll DM you for an example, just promise me you won't hold it against me
i wasn't young. It was as recently as when I was 22-23
I have come to terms with the fact that I used to be an absolutely horrendous human being, and I've learned how to deal with it, for the most part
<@!472513526393602059> <:jack:621429470980472856>

I'm sorry, i didn't mean to start an argument
It's probably like the mask phenomenon in the US. The only reason people don't want to is that someone told them they had to.
I don't get why they don't just use josou or otokonoko, which are the actual Japanese words for the phenomenon. It's not like weebs don't use Japanese words all the time anyway.
Boomer Facebook memes
If I can breathe in this heat in a double-thickness bandana pressed against my face these dumbasses can breathe with a thin paper face mask.
I made dead baby jokes when I was a kid so I do not remember that, no
Yes

He was put in the care of his genuinely unhinged daughter.
Not normally one for schadenfreude but what became of Jordan Peterson almost makes me believe in karma.
I do it for recreation so I pack a lunch and take a few hours, Usually aim for 20-25 miles since I can do it in about two hours.
Yeah, I can‚Äôt do 15 mph for more than a few seconds, lol
Like I said, nowadays I average about 10 mph/16kph
Daaamn
Oh
I feel like I should be in my prime
I‚Äôm only 25
The last five miles I had to do in one mile chunks because my legs were literally giving out
Now, I mean
I *barely* scraped by
And when I was a teen I did it no problem
Ten years or thereabouts
After like
Recently I visited my favorite section of my favorite bike trail
Like here‚Äôs an example
I used to be able to do so much better
Iunno, it‚Äôs just like
Wait you what
I probably converted wrong
You‚Äôre not swapping miles for km right? 25 mi isn‚Äôt even 40 km, I don‚Äôt think.
Here in the US stuff is spread out way more
I think like
Oh
I only average like 16kph now. I can hit like 22 max but after like three seconds I feel like I‚Äôm fucking dying.
I mean the train would be much, much quicker lmao
I just feel like I‚Äôm getting worse and worse
Whereas when I was younger and not fat I could do them no problem
Although I struggle with hills now anyway
I mean where I live it's pretty flat. There are hills but they‚Äôre not too bad.
When my parents were my age they did like fifty in one day
But now when I get around the twenty mile mark I feel fucking exhausted
Even did over thirty in the span of a few hours once
When I was younger I could bang out twenty like it was nothing
I‚Äôve been stuck permanently at only being able to bike around 25 miles for what seems like the better part of a decade
I feel like I‚Äôm never going to be able to get fit
> I wish this girl would let me groom her tbh
Jesus Christ I did not realize you were talking about an animal
I bike in rural areas and small towns so stuff like traffic and stop lights aren‚Äôt a big deal
I have a cycling computer, yeah
I kinda want an ebike, Moon Runes.
same end, more steps
Whereas with Tik Tok it's direct
The difference is that the data those sites harvest get sold around a few times before they Chinese government gets them
But it's most likely nothing that every other social media site on the planet doesn't already have
I mean, Tik Tok is obviously harvesting shitloads of data for the chinese government
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
Please let us know how your appointment goes, buddy
At least with my dogs, the vet actually recommended we be there when they were put down., so I think that‚Äôs probably the correct decision
It‚Äôs never easy, for sure. We‚Äôll be here for you if you need us, buddy.
Damn, that‚Äôs a shame. Regardless of anything else, keep her happy and keep her close for however long you have left. Even if she can‚Äôt live for a long time, she‚Äôll sure as shit live for a good time.
Let‚Äôs not forget that we‚Äôre here to help Ali, not discuss theoretical dog intelligence. I didn‚Äôt mean to derail the topic like this.
If it was cancer and it had metastasized to that point, wouldn‚Äôt they have shown up on the blood work, Ali? At the very least, the fact that they didn‚Äôt pick up on that should be cause for a little hope.
It‚Äôs definitely worth talking to your vet about, yeah.
I‚Äôm operating under the principle that it still has dog-level intelligence, Nuker.
Let‚Äôs say, Nuker, that your dog was suffering. Even if it *could* theoretically tell you its feelings and let you know it wanted to live, would it really be the right decision to let it suffer? There comes a point where it‚Äôs better to let go.
Both my childhood dogs got cancer and had to be put down. Sure, we could have let them live for a bit longer, but it would have been selfish to let them suffer because we weren‚Äôt strong enough to let them go. Putting an animal down can be the right choice, even if it‚Äôs hard.
Netflix will just let anything on their platform huh
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
Good luck, Ali. We'll be here for you no matter how it goes.
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
Sending love and good vibes your way, Ali. We'll be here if you need us.
You're a strong person, being willing and able to do that.
The important thing is that you enjoyed your time together, and you made the most of her final hours before letting her go.
You sound like a caring owner at the very least, which is more than can be said for a lot of dog owners, unfortunately. I think she was as lucky to have you as you were to have her.
<@!160142617940590594> I'm sorry that you both had to go through with that, but with it being as bad as it was, you made the right choice. I know it's not easy, but your pup's in a better place now, and I have absolutely no doubt that she enjoyed her final time with you as much as you did with her. Not even specifically the past few days, but as a whole as well.
America and the UK may be shite countries but goddamn they know how to pick a good national anthem
They can happen at the same time, but imperialist countries can exist without being fascist, and fascist countries can exist without being imperialist.
Foreigners bad
America good
No
This information doesn‚Äôt mean what you think it means,  Kai. It means the gap between expected values vs actual, reported values. It doesn‚Äôt mean that the difference isn‚Äôt COVID.
Because of complications.
Also, surviving COVID doesn‚Äôt mean you won't have potentially horrible consequences for getting it.
Would love to see a source for that.
Deaths due to complications from COVID are still deaths from COVID, because if they hadn't gotten COVID they'd most likely still be alive.
If that were the case, there would only be around 90K deaths. We‚Äôre pushing 180K
What?
Most hospitals, where I live at least, have COVID wings that are entirely separate from ER. Taking COVID patients to the ER with seriously at risk groups would be a disaster. A lot of hospitals have little tent cities outside specifically for COVID patients.
Yes
The CDC doesn‚Äôt have accurate numbers because the government won‚Äôt allow hospitals to directly report to the CDC.
I never call you Kai anyway, lol
<@!170641480791228417> Not you, Kaiyo. Kai. The one with the funky username.
Yeah I'm getting big ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care that millions of people might die‚Äù vibes.
Again, these are preventable.
Took like twelve in highschool once and saw thousands of spiders everywhere.
Benadryl is not a fun trip.
What's wrong with contemplating love?
although in my case it was an ex friend
time only further proves that matt is just me but younger
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
Thanks
I‚Äôll try, I guess
Because everything always ends up the same
I don‚Äôt know why I even try
There is any help for me
I do not think
Do you ever feel so unmotivated that you feel like you‚Äôd rather sit in one spot until you shriveled up and blew away in the wind than do anything
Absolutely nothing can go wrong!
You're absolutely right. We should ban all potentially offensive art.
<a:Diakkohug:494545509764300820>
Well your family brought you about, so I‚Äôd say it was a net positive
That‚Äôs understandable
Give her a hug for me, Matt.
Jeez
So it‚Äôs nothing too serious then, at least?
Pneumonia?
Is it COVID?
What happened, matt?
Let the last like, sixteen end first
Can we not have yet another pointless war over dumb bullshit for like at least a year
Sorry
Oh fuck
So I don't think he'd fake it.
But it makes him, in his and his followers' eyes at least, look weak.
Oh, I have no doubt he'll survive.
He's spent his whole presidency trying to convince everyone he's some elderly alpha male. For the White House to let out news that he's on a breathing apparatus because of something he's spent the last year insisting isn't a problem would be an absolute last resort for him,
^
Especially not to the point of canceling multiple of his rallies for it.
He wouldn't lie about it.
People severely overestimate Trump's willingness to lie about having COVID. He's spend the entire year downplaying it to hell and back and insisting it's not a problem, and his public appearances mean more to him than anything.
X
Imagine actually believing that China isn't lying about their COVID cases.
I have no clue why I thought he was the founder.
Oh, I didn‚Äôt realize that.
I thought the main Rooster Teeth guy died a few years back?
Next time you get in a debate with someone, leave the overbearingly smug attitude at the door. Christ.
Talking to you is obscenely frustrating.
Actually, don‚Äôt.
Tell me where I said that
Lank apparently also can stare into alternate realities now as well.
Yes, but our president is a moron.
It held no legal power, though, especially not in the south. It was symbolic more than anything.
My state tried and were shot down
Again
No, they can't.
Woah they should have put you in charge of COVID here
China can just say ‚Äúyou all do this now‚Äù. American can't.
Yes.
Can you read?
What the fuck are you talking about
I didn‚Äôt say they couldn‚Äôt do anything.
New Zealand also made mask mandatory, something which the US can't constitutionally do without the Supreme Court shitting its Boomer britches.
85% of 5 million compared to 80% of 300 million is paltry.
Lank, NZ has a population of less than 5 million.
Because the US has an infinitely higher population total.
No it's not, though.
Something like 80% of the US lives in urban areas compared to 86% in NZ. What are you talking about?
Also ‚Äújust throw away the population density‚Äù in a situation where population density is one of the deciding factors in spread is dumb.
That's because we have a dipshit president downplaying the virus and encouraging anti-masking morons, though.
Lank, the US population density is almost forty per square kilometer
The population density in America is almost triple than that of New Zealand, though. Acting like it's a direct correlation that's as easy as applying the process of a relatively unpopulated country to one of the most populated on earth is unfounded.
China is also an authoritarian state while America has to rely on the populace for cooperation.
This sounds tankie as hell
What on earth
> Hawaii has several major US military bases.
Hawaii has several major US military bases.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Lily an Kerrik an Emily an Melua da bessed
Don‚Äôt let him get to you, buddy.
<@!170641480791228417> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Yes.
Also, I'm pretty sure Lank and I are the only Americans here Keihi
I'm american and I'm not the one wishing for a literal war.
I just think it's a weird route to take considering that with how infallible they hype their government up to be, this stunt would undermine that, right?
I went through puberty the better part of a decade ago.
Is it even early enough to fix it, though? I've been like this since elementary school and only ever really thought about it deeply recently. Surely it'd be too late for T or something at this point right?
I'm just really anxious about spending like $30 to see a specialist only to be told I'm completely normal and just being overdramatic
What you're saying seem like it could be accurate, but I still feel like I'm co-opting terms and feelings that I'm too privileged to have from an objective standpoint.
How can you tell if you have low testosterone?
I have some body hair but nowhere *near* as much as other people from what I've seen, if that helps.
Like, genuinely a lot Emily.
So goddamn uncomfortable in my body despite identifying with my assigned birth gender.
I just feel like
I don‚Äôt think it's that drastic, if that helps
That's possible?
I used to be mistaken for a girl a lot as a child, if that's what you mean?
Like medical complications?
Oh
I feel like you guys are using a different definition of gender dysphoria than I am, if that makes sense.
What do you mean by intersex?
Because I couldn‚Äôt afford it at all.
I apologize for coming up with this out of the blue. I've been researching voice trainers and testosterone stuff lately and it's getting me down.
But I'm not trans, I mean. I'm a guy and I also consider myself a guy. So compared to trans people I should theoretically have it easy, you know? I feel like I'm lessening other people's struggles for selfish reasons.
I don‚Äôt want to take resources away from other people just because I'm uncomfortable
I just feel really self-conscious about getting help, because compared to other people I feel like I should have nothing to worry about.
I know it's not nearly as stigmatized or stressful as being trans, but I still feel really alien in my body.
Does anyone ever feel like they're out of place in their own body despite being their assigned gender? For as long as I can remember I've absolutely hated the way I look and talk. People **constantly** mistake me for a woman over the phone, I can't grow non-scalp hair to save my life, and my skin is really pale and smooth despite being a guy.
Im making a note to call my doctor tomorrow
I'll call my PCP tomorrow morning.
Genuinely, from the bottom of my heart, thank you guys so much.
Anyway, I'm gonna head out to make dinner.
I appreciate the help, for the record.
What kind of questions should I ask them?
Could it possibly be related to mental health medications? I've been on them for over a decade, so if it can affect my libido it could affect everything else too right?
As my brother I mean.
My dad is about the same as well.
I always assumed it was genetics, because my brother is one hairy-ass-looking son of a gun.
I‚Äôm overdue for blood work anyway, so would I want to bring it up next time I go in?
I‚Äôm not in a good place right now
Posting that was a mistake
Sorry
That‚Äôs because you do, Kerrik
I was making jambalaya and it took slightly longer to cool than it was supposed to
Long story short
So
It‚Äôs not uncomfortable, I just feel like a huge dumbass, lol
I kind of want to provide some context for why I‚Äôve emotionally been down the shitter the past weak but it‚Äôs honestly super fucking stupid and embarrassing, lol
And while I try not to let it go to my head, it definitely helps put stuff in perspective.
It genuinely means a lot to me
Thanks
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
u guys are more valuable-er

Sorry, I‚Äôm not sure where all this is coming from. I know I‚Äôm probably making a much bigger deal out of it than it is.
Sometimes I don‚Äôt know if I really have improved or have just gotten so good at pretending that I fool even myself.
Like an imposter
Like a wolf in sheep's clothing?
I‚Äôm not sure how to describe it
Iunno
And I feel like
Genuinely some of the nicest, most wonderful people I've ever met.
You guys are all just
I don‚Äôt like the thoughts I have.
I scare myself.
It made me recontextualize a lot of my childhood behaviour that I thought was benign, but really was more of a warning sign than anything. I‚Äôm going to bring it up with my shrink, but like
I really do.
I try to be.
Was just in a really dark place for a few days and it made me question if I‚Äôm even a good person.
Like I‚Äôve mentioned earlier, I‚Äôm largely feeling better.
I don‚Äôt intend to worry you guys.
I'll probably be back to myself in a few days. Just had a bit of a mental lapse the other day and I'm working through it.
Are the negative thoughts mostly about yourself, BC? Or others as well?
And I have a niggling worry in the back of my mind that one day I might not be able to afford my medication, or that somehow I'll snap and act upon them.
I feel absolutely loathesome, and I'm positive that you'd agree with me if you were able to peek in my head.
I don‚Äôt feel like a good person.
I do my best to project an aura of friendliness and positivity because those are the kind of thoughts I want to encourage, but even all the self-improvement and therapy in the world can‚Äôt change the fact that I'm, at my core, an incredibly unwell person and routinely have vile, despicable thoughts.
So what does that say for the horrible ones?
Surely even the most benign thoughts have some level on impact on your daily life and decision making in subtle ways.
Where does you as a person stop and your thoughts begin? Are you a bad person for having bad thoughts, even if you never act on them? Wouldn‚Äôt even having those thoughts in the first place make you a bad person if most people wouldn‚Äôt think about them? Am I only as good a person as the thoughts I curate?
Ideally you should aim for somewhere in the middle.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Nah this was just the other day so I haven‚Äôt made it again
And somehow the second time I did it I just fucked it right up
The first time I made it it went quickly and turned out perfect
Here is the absolute rat bastard of a meal
I took a picture of it and I can barely stand to even look at it.
That was not the right image.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Literally it
That‚Äôs
And it was slightly bland
Fixed it
Sorry
Meiyi!
I think you‚Äôre just fine, buddy
<@!302063351767498752> I wish him the best. Please stay safe, buddy.
Despite the fact that nobody is going to give out their obscenely expensive $20 edibles to ungrateful little dipshit kids.
Like how every year at Halloween police try to scare up bullshit about how stoners are going to put weed edibles in your kids‚Äô trick-or-treat baskets.
Because they needed to justify wasting millions and millions of tax dollars on a failed pet project that accomplished nothing.
But most of the awful, insidious, super-harmful-ultra-dangerous-spooky-scary side effects you hear about stuff like weed are vestiges of government propaganda from the failed war on drugs.
Literally any psychoactive drugs from weed to alcohol to cigarettes are harmful if not solely for the fact that it‚Äôs interrupting your normal bodily functions and putting extra stress on your organs.
It‚Äôs just a matter of deciding if you, personally, are willing to put up with it.
Like alcohol is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù in the sense that it won‚Äôt kill you outright, but it can still cause organ damage or other negative impacts.
Any mood or mind-altering substance has inherent risks, especially if it‚Äôs inhaled, Lectric. When people say it ‚Äúisn‚Äôt harmful‚Äù, they‚Äôre not saying it‚Äôs 100% healthy and has no long-term effects.
Please take care, Cocoa. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre safe
Also, Jesus
And this obnoxious elderly couple spend *over thirty minutes* asking the most stupid fucking questions I ever heard and then berating the poor retail worker when they were too stupid to understand the answer.
I went to Best Buy to ask the Apple rep there one simple question.
I have never wanted to smack an elderly couple upside the head so badly until now.
Safe and stable is better than what I was worried about, at the very least.
Or from anyone?
Has anyone heard from her since?
That‚Äôs horrible
Jesus.
All we can do is hope for a speedy recovery.
And it‚Äôs probably best that we don‚Äôt wildly speculate.
I don‚Äôt think anyone knows just yet. It sounds serious whatever it was, though.
Or safe, at the very least.
Hopefully she‚Äôs okay.
Are you sure everything is okay?
Something happen?
Like a routine checkup
I‚Äôm just worried about spending money for this since I also wanted to get some blood work done
No I haven‚Äôt injured my toe at all, that I know of
Oh
Like a toenail?
How would I even have got a foot infection?
No they‚Äôd charge me for it.
I was trying to spoiler that but it didn‚Äôt work.
Here
It‚Äôs the right side of my big toe
Other than that it looks normal
It‚Äôs just a bit red
I mean it doesn‚Äôt look bad or anything.
But I don‚Äôt have much money to go to a doctor
And sometimes there seems to be pus or something coming from it
It‚Äôs been sore the past week or so but now it‚Äôs all red and painful
Or is it something that will go away on its own?
Is it worth seeing a doctor for a possible toe infection?
What is it?
Ah, the CounterStrike gun
Thankfully the line was less than an hour.
lol
Did the thing
Even if it‚Äôs only someone to vent to, it helps a lot.
Well definitely at least try and check to see if your school has resources.

Alcoholism runs in my family so we have to be aware of the warning signs.

No. The closest is either josou or otokonoko.

Woah who would have ever guessed???
I want to reiterate, I‚Äôm not going to explain myself, because I‚Äôd rather keep my mouth shut and you begrudge me. I hope there are no hard feelings.
They‚Äôre a good friend.
I‚Äôve disagreed with Armis before and there are no hard feelings.
I know it‚Äôs not the disagreement.
So I think I‚Äôll dip out.
I could explain my perspective but if that made you uncomfortable you‚Äôd hate to hear the rest.
Meiyi is an EMT I think
Is it?
Should peoples' beliefs supersede the lives of people who are waiting for organ donors?
Like take someone who died of natural causes, take the useful organs, zip 'em back up and give them back to the families
As long as they‚Äôre not going out of their way to kill people it should be fine right?
So?
What‚Äôs wrong with taking healthy organs if they‚Äôre already dead?
I should also probably say that I‚Äôm registered as an organ donor, so I‚Äôm not just talking out of my ass here.
I think it's interesting though, sure.
But I‚Äôm also a very utilitarian person.
I don‚Äôt see any value in it, no.
Define social value
Probably wouldn‚Äôt be much in the way of organs left, if that were the case.
They can look up your records at the hospital, Cocoa.
We're not saying you opt out as you‚Äôre literally lying there dying, Cocoa.
They have to have parental permission, but yes.
Why wouldn‚Äôt someone be able to opt out?
So long as you make it clear it's an option, of course.
I‚Äôd be aight with an opt-out, yeah.
Also yeah I agree with the spousal thing too.
Ohhh
Oh
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I‚Äôm just confused
How is that not overriding? If your aunt dies and wants her organs to be donated, and your cousin says ‚Äúno I won‚Äôt allow it‚Äù, how is that not overriding her wishes?
A living relative overriding their dead relative's wishes is exactly that.
I don‚Äôt see how you can have it both ways, Circles. Either the dead's rights supersede those of the living or they don‚Äôt.
When the corpse with all the to-be-donated organs is rapidly decomposing it's not exactly a great time for bureaucracy and  red tape, Circles.

I can‚Äôt possible imagine how awful that is,
I‚Äôll always really admire trans people for being able to put up with this on a regular basis.

I‚Äôm genuinely curious if anyone here knows if this is a real phenomenon or if I‚Äôm just seeing patterns where there are none. Y‚Äôall are a lot smarter than me especially about LGBT issues so I figured I‚Äôd ask.
It seems to definitely be A Thing‚Ñ¢Ô∏è in the transphobe community.
I‚Äôm not shitposting for the record. I‚Äôve seen a bunch of screenshots like this where they write weird rape-y borderline-fanfic rants.

‚ÄúI mean yeah the Biblical God may have explicitly told his followers to crack babies‚Äô skulls open on sharp rocks but Jesus was pretty cool right?‚Äù
You see, this is a take I can‚Äôt fully agree with, because all three holy books have some pretty vile shit in them.
I *have* very much seen the same thing with fundamentalist Christians, though
Also yeah, I‚Äôve never seen protests outside the PA capital building by angry gun-wielding Jojo fans using Jojo‚Äôs Bizarre Adventure as a reason to protest COVID and LGBT causes

If there are religious people who are ‚Äúcool‚Äù I‚Äôve yet to meet any IRL. All the religious people I know are 90% cool and 10% ‚Äútrans people make me feel icky‚Äù or ‚Äúoh yeah israel is justified in murdering Palestinians because it says so in the Bible‚Äù
Always gotta remind myself that if they didn‚Äôt have their religion to justify their shiftiness it‚Äôd just be something else.
Religious people make it awfully hard not to hate religion.
I *want* humanity to be the best it can be.
I just
Oh, I see.
I honestly can't even pretend to know the answer.
Like a ton of our modern medicine is based off of horribly unethical and despicable human experimentation. Is that worth it?
But still. it most likely would have happened eventually anyway. Is that really worth it?
Yeah, this is almost irrefutable.
I just refuse to believe humanity is so far beyond redemption that there couldn't have been a way to handle it that didn't end in over a hundred million deaths and the collapse of tens of societies and cultures.
That's fair, I guess. WWI was just putting off an issue that would have happened eventually. I still just feel like, Iunno. Couldn't there have been a better way?
I have a hard time justifying that many deaths even if our lives are more enriched and scientifically/technologically/medically advanced as a result.
Iunno
(I'm including the Armenian genocide and Spanish flu for the record.)
Worth almost 120M deaths?
But surely there had to have been a better way, right?
That‚Äôs an oversimplification, of course
It all kind of snowballed.
I often wonder if we‚Äôd have been better off if Archduke Franz Ferdinand hadn‚Äôt been assassinated instigating WWI when it did. WWI may have happened anyway eventually, and we almost definitely wouldn‚Äôt be as technologically advanced at this point if it hadn‚Äôt, but is that stuff really worth WWI? WWII? The Cold War? All the subsequent wars in the Middle East?
Either way it‚Äôs a pretty depressing outcome.
Is a short but brutal war better than a prolonged, infinitely costlier one with better results?
I mean it‚Äôs possible, but is it probable?
And to think there were multiple occasions where we were almost lucky enough for him to have died in WWI.
It‚Äôs almost impossible to bring up extremism and not talk about the Nazis eventually, though.
Was it an example of Hitler *needing* someone to blame or him extrapolating his own prejudices out and saying ‚Äúmy opinion is fact‚Äù?
Fair enough
Laws were a thing
There are plenty of murder cults that existed without tons of funding, though.
Pretending like religion invented the idea of Not Being A Dick‚Ñ¢Ô∏è seems pretty reductionist, man

I'll be fine, but it's annoying that you can never fully get rid of it even with medication and therapy
Speaking of bipolar I am almost definitely experiencing mania currently. Ben really aggro and impulsive and reckless.
I wouldn't wish BP on my worst enemies.
I mean, as long as it's voluntary I would be very much for it. Like laser eye surgery rather than getting glasses. Like if I could get rid of my bipolar, for example, I would gladly do it. But *forcing* people to do it would literally be eugenics.
But autism is literally your brain being wired differently than neurotypical people.
Autism cannot or even needs to be treated. You can treat related symptoms with social therapy or medication for aggression or depression.
You wouldn't call someone a "person with homosexuality" or something insensitive like that.
It's a core, integral part of your life and who you are.
Some kind of choice or accessory you can take on and off at will.
Autism is not like
Like bruh
It really fucking annoys me that there's this big push from largely neurotypical people to change the way of addressing autistic people as "persons with autism". Not only because all the autistic people I know, myself included, much prefer the term "autistic".

Like the idea of being "non-binary", at least from what I understand, seems to be like
Can anyone explain to me what non-binary is in simple terms? Doesn't the existence of non-binary people imply that there *are* strict gender differences between male and female? That seems counterproductive to the idea that everyone exists on a spectrum, which they do.
But then wouldn‚Äôt the ideal term not acknowledge the existence of a binary at all?
Iunno
Like
Lemme try and
I‚Äôm just really having a hard time wrapping my head around the idea of nothing being binary while still having a name that implies there being a binary.
Humans weren‚Äôt born with women getting manicures and dudes playing with legos, right?
But that‚Äôs still societal definitions, right? Or do you mean that it‚Äôs so ingrained in our culture that you *have* to think of it like that
That aren‚Äôt just one or the other
Categories
I need to have like
I‚Äôm autistic so it‚Äôs really hard to think of things in absolutes.
Sorry
Like nobody is going to be 100% male or female, if that makes sense?
It just seems reductionist
But the mere existence of a 0.5 implies that 0 and 1 *are the default*, as opposed to people being like, 0.1 to 0.9 and not 0 and 1
What would you consider *strictly* binary, then?
Yeah, I guess.
I don‚Äôt like the idea of nature as opposed to nurture. Maybe it‚Äôs naive, but I just feel like it‚Äôs so cynical and fatalistic.
Like if the traditional ideas of gender vanished overnight, would any feel one way or the other?
But how much of that is natural and how much of that is society telling them there *are* two genders since a very young age?
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Sorry, I‚Äôm really lost at this point
But then traditional gender roles are unnecessary, right?
I feel like there‚Äôs *nobody* that specifically fits into one traditional gender or the other.
But that‚Äôs most people, right? They just don‚Äôt self-identify as it.
But doesn‚Äôt being ‚Äúnon-binary‚Äù explicitly imply there *is* a binary? Which I disagree with.
Oh. I thought spectrum just meant it was amorphous and flexible.
Doesn‚Äôt spectrum mean that anything can be anywhere? Or am I using that incorrectly?
At least I think we should, I guess.
But what I mean is that traditionally people will *try* to lump them into one or the other, which we should combat.
I don‚Äôt personally, no.
Not disagreeing, just curious.
Can I hear your reasoning behind this? I feel like everyone has at least *some* things that they enjoy that are traditionally considered male or female?
<:AkkoWhenlifegetsatyou:551091724139757589>
I'm not good with this stuff
To follow up on this, I don't mean NB implies that gender is binary, just that gender is a spectrum regardless of being NB or not, right?
Especially since pronouns can exist independent of your gender.
And wouldn't being a non-binary gender automatically make you NB since it's not male or female, even though it's a specific gender?
Since gender *is* a spectrum, why specify that you're on a spectrum rather than a hard one way or the other?
Iunno how to describe it
Like
Sorry, I feel like a huge asshole for not getting this
I though pronouns were indicative of gender, which is why a lot of NB people use ‚Äúthey/them‚Äù or ‚Äúze/zer‚Äù or ‚Äúfae/faer‚Äù.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
If that makes sense
Even though I use he/him, which is binary, it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm strictly one or the other
So like
Like I‚Äôm a guy who also likes traditional ‚Äúgirly‚Äù things who goes by ‚Äúhe/him‚Äù, but that doesn‚Äôt make it binary, right? The way people use nonbinary just sometimes seems like I‚Äôd have to be one or the other since I don‚Äôt have a preference.
I thought I had it
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
I‚Äôm just confused again
I was thinking that nonbinary meant 0 to 1 and not potentially less than 0 or greater than 1.
That‚Äôs why I was confused, yeah.
I gotcha
Ah
So nonbinary itself is an umbrella term?
Ohhh
You could either associate as 0, 1, anywhere between 0 and 1, or entirely outside 0 and 1?
Like it‚Äôs not constricted to one or the other
That would mean all the nonbinary genders would be either *between* 0 and 1 or *outside* the 0 and 1 entirely, right?
Let‚Äôs say male and female are 0 and 1
So like
I feel like such a moron
Jesus, I‚Äôm such a fucking idiot
So they consider the binaries as part of the whole number spectrum?
Yee
Oh
No nonbinary means people think there *is* a binary but just don‚Äôt adhere to it?
I‚Äôm trying to understand, I swear
I‚Äôm genuinely getting a headache from this
Sorry, I don‚Äôt mean to be obtuse
I just mean that ‚Äúnonbinary‚Äù implies there *is* a binary. Like you can‚Äôt have ‚Äúnonalcoholic‚Äù without alcohol existing, right?
Maybe it's helped me in ways I haven't realized.
Although I'm doing pretty damn well recently so it's hard to say.
Maybe I'm just too cynical but I feel like my life would have been 100% better without my neurodivergence.
I think I get what you mean now.
I really appreciate the help, though.
I feel like I‚Äôd be so much more knowledgeable by now
(Literal autism, for the record. Not the slang.)
Taking everything literally is a curse
I fucking hate being autistic
This makes a lot more sense.‚Äô
I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs an expansion of horizons since I already agreed, technically. I just didn‚Äôt understand the terms.
I want to fall in a hole
I‚Äôm a fuckjing idiot
<:AkkoWhenlifegetsatyou:551091724139757589>
I assumed that calling them ‚Äúbinary‚Äù assumed they actually were a strict binary.
**Ohhh**
Ohhh
Rather than an actual binary
And that ‚Äúbinary‚Äù is just a term for the two traditional genders?
So you‚Äôre saying that even the traditional ‚Äúbinaries‚Äù aren‚Äôt actually binary, since they exist as just two of a multitude of genders or lack of genders?
If that would help
Try to think of an example I‚Äôve gone through

I‚Äôve seen people do that at my old school and it generally seemed like none of the staff cared so long as they weren‚Äôt trying to use it at the same time as the staff or students.
Also, why would you need to ‚Äúaccept the positive side of it‚Äù? <:thonking:319510586918699008> Most rapists are straight. Do you need to ‚Äúaccept the positive side‚Äù of straight relationships because of an insignificant minority of criminals?
That‚Äôs what I was trying to get at, Pug.
There are a lot of denominations that are (comparatively) progressive and chill.
^
I‚Äôd agree if it were another demonization, but the Church very much *is* Catholicism.
Almost all Catholic institutions are under the umbrella of the Church because it is quite literally ingrained in the sermons and structure.
You *can* be, but Catholicism is focused on the institution in a way most other Christian denominations are not.
At least not that much.
Iunno if something has changed in the last ten years but I can‚Äôt imagine it has.
I grew up Catholic and it was *very* homophobic.
are you a fed
You guys act like fetishes exist in a vacuum and don‚Äôt/aren‚Äôt entirely influence/influenced by IRL stuff
Humans are famously rational and can tell fiction from real life
Things don‚Äôt exist in a vacuum
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Then I don‚Äôt think they should portray it in a positive light anyway
There‚Äôs a difference between portraying unconventional fetish stuff and romanticizing horrible real world issues that have ruined peoples‚Äô lives because it just so happens to overlap with fetish stuff.
I don‚Äôt think abuse should ever be portrayed in a positive light.
Again, I think Fenny is confusing romanticizing with representing.
I‚Äôd strongly encourage you to actually, y‚Äôknow, know what you‚Äôre defending before defending it.
Because I am not talking about the anime and manga, which are fine.
Do you know literally anything about the web novel
Or the manga and anime
Are you talking about the web novel

The incest in GoT is portrayed as fucked up and bad
Again, Fenny, you‚Äôre confusing romanticizing with representation

That‚Äôs the whole point I was making when I brought it up
It does tho
Digi you sound like you‚Äôre creeping dangerously close to ‚Äúloli is fine‚Äù territory and I very much do not want to have that convo.
My problem, Fenny, is that you‚Äôre construing literally everything through your own personal lens of ‚Äúbut I like it‚Äù without thinking about the horrible real-world issues it‚Äôs based on.
Ah, it just came across like one of those ‚Äúhehe education is a scam my grandpappy didn‚Äôt need no edumacation‚Äù things I‚Äôve seen a ton of people do unironically.
So you don‚Äôt think someone who spent hundreds to thousands of hours studying a specific subject knows it better than someone who hasn‚Äôt?
I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs the former but I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs probably the latter.
<:AkkoWhenlifegetsatyou:551091724139757589>
And I am not in a proper state of mind to deal with it
This fucking sucks
I think her girlfriend is but she‚Äôs offline because it‚Äôs like midnight where she is
Lily
I want to fuckign crawl in a hole and shrivel up
And literally every mutual server any of us had in common
I brought it up with Jen and apparently she left the server while I was at work
Not have to do that
I may
Well
Ah
Hhh
I hate to do this to someone I‚Äôve known for so long
I just
I‚Äôll try and bring it up with the mods/other members, I guess
I‚Äôm not good with confrontation
Hhh
She needs us now more than ever, you know?
But like
We understand that fully, it‚Äôs incredibly hard to come out and even harder to live in a society that actively hates you. But we‚Äôve all been friends for close to 9 years and she seems hellbent on ruining any goodwill she‚Äôs built up over that time. We genuinely want her to be happy. We want her around. And we *desperately* want our old friend back. But she‚Äôs become so hostile and mean-spirited that it‚Äôs actively uncomfortable to even be around her and we don‚Äôt know what to do.
Two out of three mods, the trans women Jen that I mentioned earlier and a cis dude (and server owner) named Adam have been increasingly considering kicking her out, as she‚Äôs making everyone, trans or not, incredibly uncomfortable.
She also has been making a lot of really insensitive jokes. Stuff like how we should ‚Äúnuke the US‚Äù due to its rampant anti-trans laws which, while we know she‚Äôs only joking, still come off as incredibly poor taste and upset one of the members there who is autistic and has a hard time distinguishing jokes from serious statements.
She also gotten really hostile towards people that have been nothing but supporting of her since she came out, and before it too. The trans women (Paige and Jen) have given her tips on ‚Äúpassing‚Äù, although I‚Äôm not a fan of the term myself, the cis women have been giving her all sorts of pointers about fashion and makeup, and *everyone* has referred to her as her chosen pronouns and given her advice and reassurance when she was feeling self-conscious .
She we‚Äôre confused as to whether she thought the men were like, gay? Or whether she thought they somehow could tell she was trans despite being entirely male-presenting and referring to herself as ‚Äúhe.‚Äù
At one point we asked her about it, and she mentioned how she thought a couple dudes had been leering at her on the train, which caught literally all of us off guard because she isn‚Äôt ‚Äúout‚Äù to any of her online friends. She doesn‚Äôt dress, act, or refer to herself as anything other than male outside of online or her own home.
Lily, the member in question, is a trans female and lesbian (of course) and has been out as bi until recently and is now fully lesbian.
She‚Äôs also gone from incredibly friendly to concerningly misandrist, interjecting seeming randomly and without provocation with stuff like ‚ÄúI fucking hate men‚Äù and ‚Äúmen are fucking disgusting‚Äù. Her girlfriend, also a long-time server member, isn‚Äôt *quite* as concerned as us but is still caught off-guard by the sudden change.
Ever since coming out she‚Äôs been increasingly hostile, picking fights with other members regardless of whether they‚Äôre trans or cis, male or female or NB.
And we‚Äôre all lost on how to deal with it.
Before they came out they were easily one of the chillest, friendliest, and least argumentative people there, but literally the day they came out their personality seemingly changed almost overnight.
They live in Australia, which is very conservative and about on par with the US as far as trans acceptance, or lack thereof.
For context, they formerly identified as male for the better part of thirty years, and only recently (as in the past month) discovered they were female, although they had doubts for the past six months or so.
But recently one of the oldest members of the chat, formerly named Dennis and now Lily (only bringing this up in case I‚Äôve mentioned their names here before), has come out as trans and almost overnight turned from the sweetest person I‚Äôve ever met into a hostile, toxic asshole. I was hoping to get some insight from people who have themselves come out, because everyone in the friend group is just as baffled and conflicted as I am.
I‚Äôve been part of a specific online friend group for the better part of a decade. We started on a gaming site, then moved to Skype, then Discord in 2015. Over the course of that near-decade a number of them have come out as trans, including two trans woman and a trans man. Luckily it‚Äôs an absolutely wonderful group of people, and everyone is supremely supportive of them and have been since day one.
Can I get some advice from some of the trans people here? There‚Äôs a metric fuckton of trans people in the server so I was hoping you could help me. I‚Äôd really appreciate it.
I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without you guys
I appreciate the help everyone gave me
She is willing to talk with most of us
At the very least
I can get that, I guess
I think she‚Äôs just self-conscious
She knew that people supported her, but that she made them subconsciously uncomfortable? I‚Äôm not sure how she quantifies that, but I‚Äôll try to keep mediating things
She said that like
So I‚Äôm going to give her time to decompress
But she‚Äôs still willing to talk
I‚Äôm not sure I agree with‚Äô
Which
We talked a bit and she said she doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable there because she didn‚Äôt feel her problems were being taken seriously
She seems safe

Everything terrible "could have been much worse".
Postulating about how "it could have been much worse" is all hypotheticals.
Has anything good ever come out of British and Ottoman imperialism
Just nowhere good.
I mean, it's got them somewhere alright.
I know a couple people in Israel and Palestine and they're taking it surprisingly well. Almost too well. The general sentiment all around seems to be "I hate the government".
Not be reprehensible trash-garbage.
How hard is it for politicians to just like
You'd think when arms are such a comically huge waste of money they'd at least make sure they didn't squander them.
How do you even do that
Was it Jean-Paul Sartre who said something like "when the rich wage it's the poor who die"?
<:AkkoWhenlifegetsatyou:551091724139757589>
This can only end well.
If it isn‚Äôt they threatened protesters with a whole-ass tank.
*If* it‚Äôs true.
Like you said, both sides are entirely capable of being shitty and in a large way both are.
Clearly.
They only want peace.
Unlike the IDF, who just launched a ground campaign.
And do you know what their intentions were?
Brave.
Thank you IDF for threatening rioters with a tank.
It‚Äôs all become some bullshit ‚Äúwell *he* started it so it‚Äôs okay‚Äù
Nobody said Palestine or Israel were the good guys, Solo. Just that Palestinians are probably more likely to be radicalized and commit war crimes if Israel also commits war crimes.
TFW you literally make being mentally ill a crime.
I‚Äôm honestly surprised the UK managed it, given their sub-par history.
What you‚Äôre going through is terrible, and something nobody should have to experience. But trying to justify the murder of civilians is absolutely fucked.
If you say so.
So their civilians‚Äô lives are worth less than your own?
And that makes it... okay to kill civilians?
She‚Äôs saying responding to war crimes with war crimes is a Bad Idea‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
Not at all.
That‚Äôs not what she did, my dude.
Civilians shouldn‚Äôt have to die because the militaries are too busy stroking their own ego over stupid century-long feuds to give a shit about human life.
What are you talking about? The IDF is killing Palestinians too. Maybe they should both knock their shit off?
Hot take: Maybe civilian lives should take precedent over military targets
It‚Äôs still bad.
And the IDF is fine with killing civilians so long as it‚Äôs collateral.
‚ÄúHamas killed children so the IDF killing children is fine, actually‚Äù is a hell of a take.
Good intentions don‚Äôt mean shit if you‚Äôve *literally killed a defenseless child*.
It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs ‚Äúon purpose‚Äù or not. Killing children is bad regardless of intention.
It‚Äôs still bad
The US kills children in drone strikes
Killing children unintentionally is still bad?
Sure.
I‚Äôm saying maybe don‚Äôt do it unless you‚Äôre actually, y‚Äôknow
You‚Äôre using Palestinian-on-Israeli violence to justify Israeli-on-Palestinian violence, which is just going to cause even more retaliatory violence from fucking everyone.
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Pug said it better than I could have
That seems king of insular and fucked up?
Combatting civilian suffering by causing more civilian suffering is fucking terrible.
It‚Äôs not minor. It‚Äôs abhorrent. But the way the IDF is handling this is not helping in the slightest.
I‚Äôm saying one doesn‚Äôt justify the other.
I am doing no such thing.
**Hmmm.**
Hamas killing civilians isn‚Äôt justifiable either, so I‚Äôm not sure why you seem so confident in acting like we‚Äôre hypocrites.
I think what confuses me the most is that you claim to dislike the government, but will vehemently defend the military despite the fact that the military is the very hand that the government uses to enforce their will.
This is some Hammurabi‚Äôs Code bullshit
What the fuck
Like genuinely
This. I‚Äôve lost friends and family to war. My cousin fucking died over a pointless war because the US government wanted oil. My middle eastern friends have fucking died over stupid century-old squabbles they had no stake in. Why the fuck would you try and justify that?
You may not want people to die, but you seem awfully invested in saying it‚Äôs okay that they do.
<:dogscust:840997481709699152>
US businessmen
Again, I have to ask, what makes you believe the lives of your civilians are worth more than the lives of Palestinian civilians?
That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying at all, and I don‚Äôt appreciate the bad faith attempt to put words in my mouth. Civilians aren‚Äôt the ones ‚Äútrying to shoot you‚Äù.
Again, what good does ‚Äúintention‚Äù mean if innocent people still die?
Sorry
Has the IDF issued an official statement?
Anything to take your mind off it.
Sometimes it‚Äôs best to disconnect. Doomscrolling is only going to make you feel worse and the absolute last thing you need with all this awful shit going on is for it to follow you online. We‚Äôll understand if you need a break, buddy. Take some time for yourself and do some writing or anime-watching or something.

We‚Äôre glad to have you here!
It‚Äôs understandable for tensions to be high, but it‚Äôs still a shame you had to deal with that, Kat.
I just meant in this chat in general.
No no, I wasn‚Äôt trying to imply they were, Kat.
Disagreeing on points is only natural in a discussion like this. Aside from a couple instances the discussion has been pretty civil.
I‚Äôm pretty proud of people here.
People in here have generally been pretty well-behaved considering this is quite a serious, controversial, and ongoing event.
Yeah, if they were theoretically going to purposefully target journalists, I can‚Äôt imagine the IDF would do something like that just to scare some journalists. It‚Äôd probably be more to hamper operations, again theoretically.
Wouldn‚Äôt people notice if there was a relatively large-scale construction project under the building?

Yeah, exactly. I just want to emphasize that your mental health is incredibly important, now more than ever. Please take care of yourself as best you can, buddy.
I just don‚Äôt want Solo to burn himself out.
I‚Äôm not saying you can avoid it entirely, Iski. I‚Äôm saying hyperfocusing for very long periods of time is only going to make you feel worse. At the very least, trying to take your mind off it would at least help calm your nerves a tad

We‚Äôre just happy that you and Solo have so far managed to stay safe.
On one hand, hostile reactions are understandable given your extreme circumstances, but you have been snapping at people a ton lately and it might be prudent to take a break for your own mental health.

You're all wonderful and everyone loves you a bunch.
Because if people that I barely even converse with can realize I'm gone and miss me, you bet your ass your friends and family would notice.
Not really a discussion, I guess. Just wanted to throw that out there in case anyone needed to hear it.
So I just wanted to say that even if it feels like people don't notice you or care about you, it's probably way less likely than you think.
But when I got back to work from quarantine I had a bunch of people ask me how I was doing and where I'd been, and this little Hispanic woman from quality assurance came up and gave me a welcome hug.
Do you ever wonder if people would even notice if you're gone? I struggle with that a lot and it's hard to convince myself it's not the case even when I know better.

The problem isn‚Äôt that aliens are real or not (although it‚Äôs highly unlikely that any are visiting us), it‚Äôs that some country, somewhere, might have technology that we‚Äôre not aware of that could potentially be used against us.

Because you‚Äôre a genuinely nice and wonderful friend and we love you a lot
I just wish we didn‚Äôt live in a world where even *acknowledging* the existence of marginalized groups of people was verboten for the sole reason that they weren‚Äôt marketable.
I do know a lot of enby people who appreciate it though, so I am happy about that.
While Stephen Universe had some iffy shit, it‚Äôs one of the few shows I can‚Äôt think of with gender-neutral/non-binary main characters, and a lot of times it felt more like a decision based around not making the censures cry about lesbians than actually being for the sake of having enby characters.
I really want to be positive but it so often just seems like our identities are being used for shallow marketing ploys.
Or even worse, the fucking ‚Äúthis character says they‚Äôre gay in one sentence that we can easily remove for when we publish it in China and the Middle East.‚Äù
On the subject of LGBT stuff, does anyone else find it disappointing how a majority of LGBTQ+ representation seems to be cis lesbians? And **even then** a majority of them are bi, as if it‚Äôs some loophole for the cis-straight suits who designed them to say ‚Äúsee they‚Äôre not *just* icky gay people, they can be straight too!‚Äù Normally I try to err on the side of positivity when it comes to representation, but it‚Äôs hard to stay positive when it seems like 90% of them are either bi, shallow attempts to make pandering to straight dudes who think girls kissing are hot seem ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù or just outright ignoring non-standard genders/genderqueer/trans representation.

I'm not sure what you mean by "what should happen to all involved". Like obviously the woman should face legal consequences for it, and I'm not sure why anything should need to "happen" to the rape victim.
If anyone has advice for how to like, let her know we're not out to get her or something, I'd really appreciate it.
We genuinely love her as a friend and want the best for her, but it's mentally and emotionally exhausting when she keeps lashing out at us over nothing because she's jumping at shadows.
She's done this a couple times before, where a few of us were fake flirting with one another and she assumed it was about herself and gone on tangents about it.
What the fuck?
But like
She immediately backpedaled when we confronted her on it, especially since I'm ace/aro and one of the other guys is gay.
Just a day ago there was an argument involving about four or five mutual friends, who have also known both her and myself for around 5-8 years depending on who. She responded to it by saying something along the lines of "not sure I'd expect anything less from dudes who've given off chaser energy before". Really? Fucking really?
I've been nothing but supportive of her both before and after her transition, and up until recently considered her a good friend and assumed the feeling was mutual.
I'd previously known her as a dude for a little under ten years now, where in the past six months or so she's come out as trans. This is the same friend I had mentioned previously who's gotten increasingly hostile since transitioning. The two aren't inherently related, of course, but it happened around the same time.
Was hoping to get some advice since there are a lot of trans people here.
Seriously considering dumping a friend of almost ten years over her recent behaviour.
Because people were talking about ‚ÄúAtlantic Rim‚Äù?

And I hang out in a tooon of LGBT circles.
Yours is the literally the first time I've ever heard of it, lol
gay
But you could also say that any trait of marginalized groups could be weaponized like one, like how "gay" is considered a slur when used as an insult but not when referring to someone actually being like
Yeah exactly. But I don't think I've ever heard of something like "mentally challenged" being wholesale considered a slur. Obviously you can use it like one, but it's not considered a slur by itself.
Or "disabled" instead of "person with disability".
"Mentally handicapped" is another one you used to see
Or like
Is what I mean
Like they used to call people with an ID "mentally challenged" but it's not considered slur like "r*tard" is.
Is it actually a slur, or just an outdated term? Because one implies intentional malice and the other implies the medical community of the past were ignorant dumbshits which we already knew by all their other horrible concepts of medicine.
If it's a slur I've never heard of it.
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty blatant

No that‚Äôs entirely different, lol
Sporadic?
What
I‚Äôll try to avoid using it in servers with my UK/British Isle peeps.
But for real though, I‚Äôd love if someone had any reading material on that.
British English is quite offensive to me, as an American.
Are they any articles about how it came to mean such different things?
Because over here it can mean hyperactive, awkward, jittery, or clumsy. But in the UK it‚Äôs 100% always used to refer to people with mental illnesses.
I wonder why there‚Äôs such a big difference in US and British English?
Yeah I‚Äôve seen it in movies and games and stuff.

‚ÄúSpastic‚Äù is a slur in Ireland? In the US, at least, I‚Äôve never heard it called a slur. Over here it‚Äôs always meant something similar to ‚Äúhyperactive‚Äù.

‚ÄúFeminists‚Äù who hate trans women because they‚Äôre ‚Äúnot real women‚Äù
Trans exclusionary radical feminist
Handing out anti-terf propaganda is pretty anti-terf IMO
What‚Äôs stopping terfs from continuing to co-opt earnest feminist symbols once they drop the old ones due to association?
GC?
Feminism is a general concept and not an organization that can vet it‚Äôs members, so awful people will always claim to be in that group and co-opt its symbols. I wouldn‚Äôt write the whole thing off because of a minority of awful people.
It is absolutely platformed in the UK when it shouldn't be.
Ehhh. I don't think it's as big a problem as in the US but pretending it's "just a few people" is bullshit, especially when you have places like the fucking BBC of all things normalizing "both sides"-ing it.
As an american who is exposed to both mainstream media and alt media stuff a lot it is absolutely platformed here as well
Unless I'm misunderstanding.
Being a TER/TERF isn't a British exclusive thing though?
That makes sense
Ohhh

‚ÄúKAZUMA from KonoSuba OWNS FEMINAZIS with this ONE LINE‚Äù
I‚Äôm not saying all weebs are incels, but a lot of incels are weebs.
I am very opinionated and quick to anger.
I don‚Äôt vent. To anyone. If I let people know how I really feel about things they‚Äôd distance themselves from me immediately.
It starts as occasional spats, which slowly become more frequent, then devolve further into semi regular public arguments where I start letting the mask slip. Then the illusion eventually shatters completely and I get banned.
I have never once stayed in a community for more than a few years. I try to be a good person, but I‚Äôm incredibly hostile and bitter and there are many people I hold in utter contempt. I always do my best to make a good first impression, but over time I get complacent and more and more of the sarcasm, hostility, and pessimism start bleeding through. The more comfortable with people I get the more I open up, and the more I open up the more people realize what an awful person I am. I feel like I have to be guarded 24/7 because if I don‚Äôt I *know* that I‚Äôll just fuck it up.
Do you ever worry that people will find out what kind of person you really are? That they‚Äôll come to learn that you‚Äôre actually incredibly bitter and cynical? That the mask you try to keep on so people will like you will start to slip and they‚Äôll realize it was all a charade and distance themselves from you?
I know this isn‚Äôt a venting channel, but I was hoping to get you guys‚Äô advice on this.

<@!722121666641133608>
I understand. I just think you can have some aspects of gender abolition without the whole package.
As long as we stop arbitrarily locking things to gender, gender just becomes another flavor thing, like names.
Abolitionism is unnecessary.
I don't like pronouns either, but some people do and that's fine.

I mean I don't care what anyone calls me. I just have he/him in my bio because that's what I'm used to and it makes it easier.
Honestly I've gotten mistaken for a woman so much during my life that I've just given up on caring.

Yeah Mel's was really helpful
I appreciate the explanations
In all honesty I think the concept of gender as a whole is pretty arbitrary and pointless so I've never bothered to learn the specifics. Nothing against people that care about them for whatever reason, this just confuses the absolute fuck out of me.
That question made more sense in my head.
Then why are they called non-binary if there's no binary to be non?
Oh, I see what you were responding to
It's not about the creators. It's about Google's cut of the earnings.
I'm assuming it's that.
I just checked, and embeds have ads.
It was a pretty useless bot anyway. Why would I want to use the bot and have my audio sounds like it was fed through a meat grinder when I could just use, y'know, YouTube Music?
Embedded links have ads, don't they?

This is pure naivety. The government is hellbent on not mandating anything.
I stand by my earlier statement. Your rights end where they literally put other people's lives on the line.
So what's your recommendation? Let millions of people die because poor Karen doesn't want Bill Gates to put a microchip in her arm?
And if you think things haven't significantly changed in over 100 years you're off your rocker.
>100 years ago
These are not normal circumstances.
You do realize that the COVID pandemic is unprecedented, right?
These people are literally putting others lives on the line.
You do realize it's possible to get a diagnosis for being immunocompromised right? You would literally have to know it anyway.
And we can't just not require it for immunocompromised people?
Pretending that everyone of like, the 75% of people who haven't gotten the vaccine are immunocompromised  if just blantantly not true.
But they won't.
Like I said. The government *should* require it.
So people should be free to expose others to a deadly virus that has killed literally millions of people just because it inconveniences them?
Also, your rights end where the safety of others begin. The moment your decisions start putting others at the risk of literal death is where your medical rights end.
We have no precedent to assume that's the case.
That is pure conjecture.
Why should I, my family, my elderly grandparents. and more be at risk because some shmuck at my job thinks Bill Gates is going to pump 5G into him?
Good. Fuck people who put their selfishness above the wellbeing of their coworkers.
That's why.
Because the governnment *won't* do it.
Why does it matter who does it if the end result is the same?
I hate big corpos, but this isn't just about people refusing to get vaxxed. You are *actively* putting your coworkers and their families in danger.
If you put yourself at risk because of your own stubbornness,  why should your employer have to pay for your own stupidity?
Is there any reason this is bad? I feel like charging people who refuse to get vaxxed is a good incentive to actually get people to do it.
If your solution is to do nothing you are absolutely complicit.
Why should millions more have to go through the fucking pain and loss my family has
Who the *fuck* are you to sentence millions more to death?
*MY FUCKING COUSIN DIED FROM COVID*
I'm not pretending the government is going to somehow start caring.
They absolutely can't. Which is what I've been saying the whole time.
I just
I'm glad you've already resigned yourself to defeatism, i guess.
Again, people aren't going to magically come together. If the worst pandemic in 100 years can't resolve the issue no amount of wishful thinking will.
Mean while **millions are dying as you do nothing.**
You parade around all these idealist ideas of people somehow coming together and overthrowing the establishment government to instate people that actually care.
The government doesn't care and it won't care.
Guess what. I've sacrificed hundreds of hours of my life for this shit and it's accomplished nothing.
What the fuck have *you* done?
Volunteered at local homeless shelters and elderly homes.
I literally am a fucking political activist. I have been in marches. written letters to my representative officials. Voted in literally ever state and national election since I turned 18.
I'd love to hear your solution.
And how do you propose we do that?
You'd rather thousands of people die than let corps have more power?
So your solution is to do nothing?
We *know* this one is letting people die. You're *assuming* one is going to let people die.
I'm genuinely appalled you'd rather continue to let people die.
If the other unconscionable act is literally preventing people from dying I'm choosing the lesser of two evils.
**I'm** frustrated. People are dying. How is this conscionable?
So you'd rather let millions die because of a completely hypothetical solution where the government magically starts caring?
Because the government doesn't care.
Have fun watching hundreds of thousands of people die then, I guess.
Pretending the government is going to do anything is deluded
Again, what's your solution?
Hey remember that part earlier that I explicitly said immunocompromised people should be exempt?
I'm saying that *someone* should require the vaxx. I don't care who it is. If it's not one it should be the other.
Well, stubborn. Not necessarily stupid.
I'd rather let stupid people die tbh.
And I don't care that you're upset that your privacy is being violated or whatever. People are dying.
I'm going to throw up
Either way even more people I love are going to die
I don't know
I don't know
I just
If I could throw down my life for their safety I would
I am literally a fucking drain on society
I'm a fucking wagie for a billion dollar company
They have kids, family, important careers
I'd literally rather die than lose any of my family and friends
I just can't even conceive a result where the government puts the wellbeing of the country above their own reputation
And I've accomplished literally nothing
Tens of hours on the phone and Facebook organizing stuff
I feel like I've wasted my time
I've lobbied politicians for almost a decade and nothing's come of it
I don't want any more of the people I love to die
Want to give them the chance
I just
But they have
I probably never will
I've fucking accomplished nothing with my life
I don't care if I'd have to throw my fucking life away
I wouldn't be able to live with myself knowing there was something I could have done to save them and not doing it
I just want to see them
I just want them to be safe
I just
I've lost too fucking many already
I don't want any more of my fucking family and friends to die
I know you mean well. I genuinely do. I just can't agree with you.
Fuck
I just
But the difference is that they knew the risk and decided it was better than doing nothing. The fact they had to die was unconscionable but how can you compare someone putting their own lives at risk to someone putting others at risk?
I don't want any more of my fucking family to die
I have a laundry list of mental and physical health issues. You think I don't know that it has the chance to backfire?
It is possible to be disgusted at both, and I very much am.
I cannot believe this.
I'm sorry. I'm taking a break. I am genuinely fucking disgusted right now.
Do you seriously believe politcal change is going to happen? Do you really believe that?
Even if I still disagree with your assessment, you guys have just as good intentions as I do and I shouldn‚Äôt have assumed malice
I‚Äôm sorry for the way I acted

I sent this to Mel and Lily but I wanted to share it here too. <@!170641480791228417> <@454822882045067298> <@278860841485598720>
And why so badly
Why yesterday all of a sudden
But I don‚Äôt know why it hit me like a fucking truck almost a year later
I was sad when he died, obviously
I love my family, but my cousin and I weren‚Äôt super close
I don‚Äôt even know why I broke down
You guys shouldn‚Äôt be forgiving me so easily
No
I‚Äôll try to be better
I‚Äôll try and make it up to you guys but I understand if you‚Äôd rather have nothing to do with me anymore
I don‚Äôt blame you if you hate me now
I let my mental breakdown get the better of me and fucked everything up
I‚Äôm sorry
Hopefully i didn‚Äôt come across as instagitive.
I should clarify that I‚Äôm not trying to be snarky. I just think that as a general rule of thumb it makes sense to not post in a discussion channel if you don‚Äôt actually want to discuss anything.
I was just under the impression that the general rule of the channel was not to post hit and run posts. Unless I‚Äôm confusing this with another server.

The old bot was entirely Markov, though.
But it‚Äôs primarily GPT3 now
It can do Markov too
It‚Äôs a gpt3 bot that tries to come up with authentic-sounding sentences.
Ah, I guess I just misunderstood what they meant.
That kind of thing?
"Spanglish should not be the only aspect of a hispanic character's representation"
And like
Ah, so it's more people just mean "Spanglish should be authentic to how it is in real life under the supervision of someone who knows about the subject" and not "people should never talk like this in media ever"?
They were all genuinely some of the sweetest people though.
I've met a lot of Chinese immigrants at my past few jobs/volunteer work/soup kitchens/etc, but they primarily spoke entirely in their native tongue so I'm not going to pretend to know anything about that.
I've genuinely met more wonderful people packing boxes for 10 hours a day than i ever did shadowing engineering/computer science firms.
I like being able to interact with people from different cultures.
I've worked a lot of labor jobs and you *always* get a wonderful assortment of people and cultures. I remember interning at an office job and it was all just white guys
Oh, I mean if your whole "representation" is Spanglish that's obviously not good.
They're just happy to spend time with you.
So people feel the same way about you as you feel about them!
You've almost assuredly have other people tell you "I don't know why you like me" or something similar. It's like that, but you're the one saying it.
Everything Ein just said.
2. Absolutely.
1. It is wonderful to see you again, Ein!
Am I out of line?
I think the optimum solution is to actually comprehensively consult people who actually know about and are that demographic to know how to acurately portray them, right?
Isn't that the opposite of what we want?
Counter-representational to say that white/black/asian/hispanic people can only write characters of their own race?
It seems like
Not sure I agree?
I'm...
So you're saying we need less Hispanic representation in media?
But almost all the Hispanic people I interact with every day talk like that. Wouldn't it be more offensive to just straight-up whitewash them?
I've seen people specifically point to stuff in games like "[insert English sentence here], hombre".
But as long as it's a faithful/accurate representation and not done maliciously does it make a difference?
Is there any reason Spanglish is considered a bad trope/lazy writing? I interact with a ton of Hispanic people on the regular and they all mix English and Spanish in their day-to-day conversations. Isn't being authentic to how a culture or group of people talk a good thing?
I'll try saying it back to him if he says goodnight tomorrow!
Ah, fair enough
I say anything in another language without knowing what it means beforehand. I always wish him a good night anyway, so that actually works out very well.
Thank you!
THAT'S EXACTLY IT
YOOO
Lemme look up the pronunciation
We leave around 6pm
Is it like "goodbye"?
I was hoping you'd know what it meant so I could respond to him better
"wan-wan" or "wanahn" or "wanan", something similar to that
There's a Chinese man who works at the station next to me and whenever we leave for the day he always comes up to my station and says something that sounds kind of like
You speak Chinese, right?
I do have a quick question, if you don't mind
I appreciate the explanation
That makes sense
As long as you make sure your passwords are secure and you have 2FA there shouldn‚Äôt be a problem.
I don‚Äôt think anyone is going full doomer over let‚Äôs players, Rider.
Yeah but if you‚Äôre at work or school or something they‚Äôre not going to let you install password managers on their computers, lol
How would you use a password manager across devices though? They often recommend just gobbledegook letter and number jumbles so how are you supposed to log in from a device where you don‚Äôt have access to your password manager?
I don‚Äôt think so.
<:frown:868440357594083370>
Will this affect people with 2FA? Twitch forced me to use it.
aa fuck
For passwords, you mean?
<:frown:868440357594083370>
My dad is a techno-zealot and has a bunch of different home assistants so I‚Äôve just given up on in-home security at this point.
Because who breaks into a house and rummages through drawers for notebooks
That way there‚Äôs no risk of my data being hacked or stolen.
I might just do what I used to do and keep a physical booklet in my nightstand with all my passwords written on it.

Do password managers cost money

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good comparison at all.
Bows are hard to aim, have limited range, hold only one ‚Äúround‚Äù at a time, and aren‚Äôt semi-automatic
All my friends IRL are people I met at conventions or at the bar or at hobby shops.
But that‚Äôs not the internet‚Äôs fault? There are still myriad ways to make friends IRL.‚Äô
I disagree with your assessment entirely. Even as someone with social anxiety, it is still entirely possible to socialize IRL. Hell, it‚Äôs actually *easier* than it ever was. Given how simple it is to contact friends and look up information online, planning IRL meetups is piss-easy when you don‚Äôt have work or school. People aren‚Äôt addicted to the internet or anything, generally. It just provides a ton of help to coordinate things.

It‚Äôs a self-fulfilling prophecy. You hyperfocus on the internet and it makes you miserable, and your being miserable leads to you wanting to assign the blame to someone other than yourself, and so you blame the internet. As someone who grew up before the age of internet socialization, people aren‚Äôt any different than they were before. Prior to the internet everyone wasn‚Äôt magically happy or open to socialization or anything. 

Like I said, it‚Äôs entirely possible to have both a healthy social both on and offline simultaneously.
Honestly what worked for me, provided you can afford it of course, was talking to my doctor about it. They helped me set up some therapy sessions with a professional which really helped.
I mean I got my first job when I was 22. Mental health issues are considered debilitating for a reason. If you think it might be that, there are government departments to help people with disabilities find jobs, which is where I got mine.
Look at Miss Talented over here breathing and blinking at the same time.

For his final trick he made his job disappear.
I think I follow you
But for mental health and psychosis it's pretty damn normalized
Or other illnesses
Like you wouldn't have a cancer meter that you refill by getting chemotherapy without someone saying "hey isn't that kind of fucked?"
Like I'm struggling to think of other medical disorders that people would look at and say "make that a game mechanic"
I just never thought super deep about it before.
I should say that I'm not offended by it or anything. Your average person understands mental health so little that it's not done with malicious intent.
That's why I brought up the games that use shit like antipsychotics or antidepressants or whatever as a form of powerup or health item
That's definitely true, yeah.
Oh, mechanically it can be interesting, yeah. I just mean the game-ification of mental illness.
Normally games tend to just generalize it as "insanity" because they don't want to call it out, but it's almost always clearly psychosis.
Yeah, exactly.
And I was wondering how other people felt
I think it's kind of tacky but I'm also not super torn up about it either
And I can even think of a few where you can "raise" your sanity with antipsychotics and shit
I was wondering what your thoughts were on how video games often treat any form of mental illness as psychosis. Like how there are a lot of horror games with "sanity" meters and a low sanity almost always means "you have psychosis now have fun with the hallucinations".
I have BP I
I'm assuming you have negative schizophrenia, then?
Since they're also delusions and paranoia
I was under the impression that all hallucinations were psychotic but not all people with psychosis hallucinate
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Apologies for assuming.
Oh, you've been pretty vocal about your distaste for people making jokes about psychosis since you had schizophrenia, so I assumed you suffered from it yourself.
If it's too personal I can ask you in DMs.
<@!170641480791228417> May I get your perspective on something, from one person with psychosis to another? Asking here because I'd like other peoples' thoughts on it too, if at all possible.

<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
What you are describing is stockholm syndrome
i have not been to therapy in almost two years because of COVID and it shows
IIRC you basically forcibly sensory deprive someone for extended periods of time
I don‚Äôt see how I wasn‚Äôt being tactful when I literally attempted to word it specifically to avoid confusion
Which is why I explicitly said ‚Äúwhat you are *describing* is stockholm syndrome‚Äù and not ‚Äúyou have stockholm syndrome‚Äù
I said the way you described it made a non-stockholm-syndrome take sound like stockholm syndrome
Literally never did that.
People do stupid shit over minor disagreements all the time
You can‚Äôt remove violent conflict and not remove minor conflicts too
If there would be minor conflict there would still be violent conflict, so that doesn‚Äôt make sense to me at all.
Additionally, why do you not want to consult a friend? Talking to friends and giving one another advice comes with the territory in friendships.
Do you have any hobbies?

My problem wasn't the fact that you were claiming what was normal back then. It was you acting as if it's entirely unreasonable to call that bad behaviour and saying that we're better off for not allowing it now. Claiming I'd "never survive in a COD lobby" gives off a shit-ton of "SnOwFlAkEs today would never survive on the InTeRnEt" vibes.
<a:APetForMaria:753351133438935260>
Nah, you're fine Das.
Do you think people IRL talked like in COD lobbies?
Again, outside of places like COD lobbies, slurs were still *incredibly* frowned upon.
Now let's not be too controversial here, Rider
I fully remember COD lobbies
I am literally almost thirty years old, my guy

It‚Äôs not that goddamn deep
Exactly, Maria
Why would I complain about people posting NSFW content in a server where posting NSFW content was okay?
Did you stretch before that reach?
Exactly, Maria
The mods have in fact stepped in a couple times
Where are you getting the idea that the mods are okay with it?
I am specifically talking, as I have stated numerous times, about people posting their weird wankshit it public in a SFW channel unprompted
Nowhere did I say mods weren‚Äôt preventing it
You‚Äôre making an awful lot of assumptions on your part, Mel
It shouldn‚Äôt be my responsibility to leave a server because some greasy neckbeard has no sense of public decency and wants to talk about cranking his pud to Paw Patrol smut in a SFW channel or whatever
üëÜ
I am personally of the opinion that maybe grown adults should not openly talk about their masturbatory habits in servers with minors, but what do I know.
I literally never mentioned Twitter and was not even slightly talking about Twitter.
Or as close to it as you can get on this site
The SFW general channel of an entirely unrelated public Discord server is absolutely ‚Äúpublic space‚Äù
I‚Äôm not anti-sex or anything, for the record. I‚Äôm anti-‚Äútalking about your sex habits unprompted in public to complete strangers‚Äù.
It‚Äôs a thing people bring up on a yearly basis at the same time every year, so I‚Äôm not sure what else to call it.
Am I the only person who thinks the whole ‚Äúholiday‚Äù is just gross as hell?
For some people
People need to keep that shit to themselves IMO. For some reason the whole concept of privacy and not oversharing goes out the window the moment November rolls around
Yes ‚ÄúPokeLord420‚Äù I do hear that you couldn‚Äôt go two days without cranking your pud that is very good and cool
If there‚Äôs one thing I love hearing about every day for a month it‚Äôs the masturbatory habits of complete strangers

Isn‚Äôt that what I did?
Like I don‚Äôt even know where I‚Äôd begin with some of the stuff you guys are saying
if that makes sense
Which is how I talk IRL
I talk online literally the only way I know how to do
I don‚Äôt get it
How do you say stuff differently while still saying the same stuff
So I need to pretend to be someone else online or?
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm confused

Do you guys genuinely think I come across as snarky?
Melua did. I was responding to her.
I just don‚Äôt get how that is different than what I said.
This is a genuine question.
How else would you even phrase it?
Is this my autism showing? Pointing out that it wasn‚Äôt related to what I was originally going for isn‚Äôt snark, though?
How??
Autism etc, etc
But as a general rule of thumb I‚Äôm much more likely to be outright aggressive-aggressive than passive-aggressive, so if I‚Äôm coming across as snide it‚Äôs most likely unintentional.
I can see that.
And again, I genuinely don‚Äôt know how that comes across as snarky. I meant it seriously.
I was saying people were discussing stuff tangentially related to what I brought up rather than what I brought up.
Not snark.
This was frustation at the fact that people were muddling my point by introducing random variables that I was not talking about.
I‚Äôm not into passive aggressive stuff.
I‚Äôm generally not a subtle person so if I think something is stupid I‚Äôll generally just say very bluntly that I think it‚Äôs stupid.
All I can say is that I didn‚Äôt mean for them to sound snarky.
I feel like we have very different definitions of what constitutes snark if you think these messages came across as snarky.
I meant no snark. I cannot control how you interpret my messages.
Fixed the italics because it came across as snarkier than I intended.
As multiple other people obviously understood what I meant.
I disagree. I think I was very clear.
It‚Äôs not just ribbings. If it were I‚Äôd understand it.
How else would I even phrase things?
Is it just the way I talk?
People are reading mocking into messages that I don‚Äôt intend to come across as mocking, I don‚Äôt understand how that‚Äôs a perception or definition issue
I don‚Äôt even know how else I could interpret it
Derogatory or mocking.
My perception of it is exactly the definition.
I thought you were doing the thing where I define something and then you ask me to define what I defined and then define what I defined what I defined

I‚Äôm literally going off of the dictionary definition, for the record.
I‚Äôm genuinely asking here.
If this is an attempt at a joke it‚Äôs not funny.
A phrase meant as a sarcastic dig at someone else
Snark is a combination of ‚Äúsnide‚Äù and ‚Äúremark‚Äù
It‚Äôs in the name
It seems like a distinction without a difference.
Isn‚Äôt that the same thing?
My bad
Oof forgot to untag.
I‚Äôm not sure why she didn‚Äôt mention it herself.
Here‚Äôs an example Yumi gave.
I wouldn‚Äôt be asking here if I knew.
Because I clearly don‚Äôt know why people think I‚Äôm snarky.
So you‚Äôd have to ask someone else here
I am literally referring to people here.
Who is ‚Äúthey‚Äù?
By asking me for an example of what I consider snark they‚Äôre clearly implying that our definitions are different.
I don‚Äôt know how I can make that any more clear here.
I feel like a broken record here, but again, it‚Äôs not the definition that‚Äôs the problem.
If that makes sense
Like I think it‚Äôs pretty clearly not the definition of snark that‚Äôs the problem though, since I‚Äôm not intending them to sound that way
I don‚Äôt know
I don‚Äôt know how the disconnect is so wide
???
And when I asked for examples they literally just started posting my normal messages
I asked in some other servers and they said the same thing
What am I doing wrong
Why do people interpret so much of my stuff as snarky
Im gping to throw up
https://tenor.com/view/love-actually-christmas-christmas-movie-workingtitlefilms-hugh-grant-gif-15362644
Why is communicating so hard
I am going to backflip into the sun
<:frown:868440357594083370>
I‚Äôll try to remember this, though
I feel guilty, like I partially lied to them or something
I feel like I‚Äôm being dishonest if I‚Äôm not blunt, though
Wouldn‚Äôt vagueness be worse because it leaves more room for misinterpretation?
Absolutely terrible language
I hate English
https://tenor.com/view/calculating-puzzled-math-confused-confused-look-gif-14677181
But isn‚Äôt ‚Äúliterally‚Äù the correct word to use since I genuinely hadn‚Äôt messaged it once?
pain
I feel like we‚Äôve exhausted pretty much every avenue we‚Äôve tried exploring definition-wise
What are some practical examples of what I can do or change
Maybe we should stop focusing on the definitions and abstractions of communication which is clearly just leading us in circles and start focusing on practical stuff
I don‚Äôt follow
If that makes sense
I can‚Äôt trim out words when I‚Äôm already using the bare minimum I know how to use
But how am I supposed to phrase things differently when I‚Äôm already being as direct as I can manage
But again, if people are reading snark into my messages I *can‚Äôt* intentionally be less snarky because even if I‚Äôm not snarky they still think I am
I just don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing here
How would I even fix something like that?
But at that point there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it because they‚Äôre reading snarky into messages where I intend none
I don‚Äôt know how else to talk
If I‚Äôm being sarcastic I feel like I‚Äôm generally very obvious about it
If it‚Äôs not obvious that I‚Äôm being snide why would people assume I‚Äôm being snide?
But the example above is clearly intentional, right?
I don‚Äôt know how else to explain myself and it‚Äôs frustrating
I understand that you want to help, Yumi, and I appreciate it, but I feel like you don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm trying to say at all
I am back
Be right back
I am going to throw up again
I don‚Äôt understand your point
I genuinely don‚Äôt understand the correlation
How is posting a case of me being deliberately snarky supposed to reflect on me accidentally coming across as snarky
You‚Äôre still not answering my question
Which I don‚Äôt get how it ties to the original conversation
If anything it makes me understand it less, because that‚Äôs an example of me *intentionally* being snarky
Which is what I don‚Äôt understand
‚ÄúIntentionally making light of someone saying dumb racist shit‚Äù isn‚Äôt other people misinterpreting what I say, though.
Which is not what I‚Äôm talking about.
That is absolutely supposed to be snark.
???
I don‚Äôt understand how that‚Äôs snark. In what way is that mocking or derisive?
I am going to walk into the sea
But I don‚Äôt know how else I would phrase it
Can you rephrase that?
I don‚Äôt follow, Megan
I am literally talking about just normal messages

The problem with human crushes is that they're a lot like traffic jams. They form kind of organically almost out of nowhere, and once they've started it's hard to stop because the more intense it gets the more you have to get people to act in unison, which is hard when they're panicking.
They were crowding towards the stage.
Because that's where the performers were?
The problem is that most of the people who *were* there began pushing into a specific part of the venue.

There's also this, Freyja. It wasn't "overpacked".
The problem is that the event *did* have preventative measures. There were crash bars installed and open exits, according to preliminary investigations.
Do you think people who are panicked and fearing for their lives would be *less* fearful if it was acknowledged over like, a loudspeaker? If anything that would just incite even more people to panic.
You can prevent it, definitely, but once it's happening it's incredibly hard to stop.
Human crushes aren't all that uncommon at big events, unfortunately. It's not as simple as "well why didn't they just stop it", because you can't "just stop" a human crush. How do you expect several hundred panicked people to just calm down all at once?
and onwards of course
im guessing it will be for any earnings between when this takes effect and the next period

Like if someone quietly questions my medical diagnosis? Fine, I guess? But like
I mean it‚Äôs one thing to be dubious as to stuff other people say, but it‚Äôs an entirely different thing to *fucking press then on it like they were playing 20 questions.*
It's just a flat "any transaction over this amount has to be reported" thing
So this is just extending the current system to also apply to the crypto industry.
10K is the cutoff for everything, not exclusively crypto. It also applies for regular workers and people who run their own business and stuff.
Many ideas are good on paper.
For an ostensibly good technology all the practical implementations that actually exist and aren't just pure hypotheticals are pretty fucking dumb and bad.

Buying an NFT is essentially paying money for a receipt for a product that is infinitely reproducible and costs no money to secure a copy of.

A video game can never replicate the real feeling 1:1 unless we invent a Star Trek holodeck or some shit. We can literally do what crypto does now for infinitely less abusable and costly methods both in an environmental and energy consumptive sense.
It's not an imitation like a football video game is though. It literally does the same thing but worse.
Do you genuinely think playing a football video game is anything like actually playing football?
You can play tabletop simulator, but nobody is pretending tabletop simulator is some miraculous miracle tech.
Board games and video games share almost nothing in common aside from both being games, though?
I think I get it now, though.
I also wasn‚Äôt trying to imply I thought you were stupid or wrong or something, I just genuinely wasn‚Äôt sure how to interpret what you said.
I know that, though. I was saying that pretty much anything you say about something will be an opinion, so I don't get why they'd have said ‚Äúit's just your opinion‚Äù if that's all it could have been.
But opinions are not absolute by definition? I don't understand what you're trying to say.
‚Äúyou need to add objectivity to the opinion. of course depends on the situation‚Äù
‚ÄúOpinions are opinable‚Äù
‚ÄúWatch out with that take‚Äù
The whole thing

I mean I don't understand what you mean by this
What?
So I can kind of see that one?
I mean, white lies aren't uncommon. Being entirely blunt and truthful can be bad as well.
Does anyone else get confused by it or is it just me? It might just be my autism speaking or some shit so I wanted a second opinion.
Hell, even something like ‚Äúeating a steak is better than getting your own shit smeared on your face while you sleep‚Äù is an opinion because there is absolutely someone somewhere out there who is vegetarian and has a scat fetish.
Unless you're literally saying something  that is known to be completely objective without a shadow of a doubt like ‚Äú1 + 1 = 2‚Äù then literally everything will be an opinion.
‚ÄúIn the opinion of that drunk guy pissing in the corner of the subway car over there, books are very cool and good.‚Äù
People who say ‚Äúthat's just your opinion‚Äù baffle the hell out of me. Like yeh? Of course their my opinion? Should I have someone else's opinion instead?
They won't.

The current state of capitalism is one of being almost entirely deregulated. It‚Äôs working exactly the way it was intended to work.

Smoke can be cleaned pretty easily.
Did you set the microwave on fire?
You mean other than the fact that the taste and texture are infinitely worse?
I am very serious.
I never joke about microwaving hotdogs.
What kind of psychopath puts cheese on a hot dog?
Yeah but the texture and taste are ass.
I feel like pretty much any method would produce better results than microwaving
Frying too, now that you mention it.
Bruh
Microwaving meat is just

You don't grill or broil them?
You microwave your hotdogs?

Heat doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be friction though, which is why I was trying to think of how to word it.
I think it's a very specific type.
It's kind of friction.
Well

All a microwave does is excite the molecules. It happens much, must faster with water but it can do it with just about anything eventually.

I'll try and make an effort to remember to check people's names from now on, though.
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I get so fucking anxious explaining that kind of stuff because I'm afraid of getting it wrong and misrepresenting whoever originally posted
I might be misinterpreting though.
I think they just meant that if a lot of people do something like putting pronouns in their bio, it becomes second nature to check there; but if you put something in your name which not a lot of people do, the natural impulse to check doesn‚Äôt really kick in because you don‚Äôt expect it.
Although I think Yumi has mentioned being Autistic too before, so I probably didn‚Äôt need to overexplain there.
Autism go brrrr
Although I have been trying to come across more tactful lately since people said I came across as snarky, so I'm always open to feedback or constructive criticism.
I'm not super great at putting stuff into words.
Thanks for the assist, Maria.
Yeah, Maria said it better than I could have.
I get what you're trying to say, though.
Pronoun roles and profiles are something that we expect to be there because that's their intended use. Usernames weren‚Äôt really intended to be used the way you do, so I'm not sure if I agree that that's a fair comparison.
Is there any way to disable pings on a per-server basis? I'd imagine that could help a lot but I don't know anything like that myself.
This isn‚Äôt a criticism or snark, for the record. I just wanted to let you know how it could come across sometimes, because I know you don‚Äôt mean any harm and just want to not be distracted.
I respect your wish to not receive pings, and I disable them whenever I can remember to, but you can get pretty hostile about it when people forget.
It's not unreasonable to not want to be tagged. Not at all. It's unreasonable to expect people to remember it 100% when Discord automatically sets it to ping.

Again, I'm not insulting your intelligence. I don‚Äôt think disagreeing has any bearing on it.
Yes, but I am free to say I feel your opinion is founded on an incredibly shaky foundation.
It is incredibly in-context.
Additionally, nobody is forcing you to take assisted suicide as an option. That's not suicide, that's murder, and conflating the two is, in my opinion, unbelievably disingenuous.
Every action has a ‚Äúripple effect‚Äù. You choosing to piss with the toilet seat down instead of up has a ‚Äúripple effect‚Äù. If you use that as a basis for anything you're inviting unwanted meddling.
Exactly what Lank said.
An abortion taken by a woman who was TW ||raped|| could have a ‚Äúripple effect‚Äù on her ||rapist|| who wanted the child to live. I think that's an awful way to think about it.
Then I find that very hypocritical.
Are you anti-abortion, Cypher? These are exactly the same arguments you see constantly from pro-lifers.
So long as precautions were taken to not harm anyone else.
I should be able to do absolutely goddamn anything I want with my body.
I absolutely disagree.
I feel like a large portion of this comes from the very core tenant of being a doctor. At what point does ‚Äúdoing no harm‚Äù actively *become* harmful in and of itself?
Mandatory referrals could be a very decent middle ground. I can see that being a massive step up.
What you‚Äôre describing is almost exactly the situation in the US with abortion. I think it's very comparable.
Do poor people with Alzheimer‚Äôs not deserve the right because they can't afford to fly or travel hundreds of miles to find a doctor that will give them the okay?
Especially in places like the US.
Do you realize how impractical and in a lot of cases impossible is to get an abortion because of this exact situation?
Obviously doctors should be able to object if they personally don‚Äôt want to do the killing, but what if your doctor refused to even give you the go-ahead to see a doctor that did?
Don‚Äôt worry.
You can just call me Matt, lol
Again, I'd just like to use abortion as an example. What if you wanted to have an abortion but had to get a doctor's written permission? What if that doctor refused on a personal basis?
Dementia/Alzheimer‚Äôs/coma, for context.
My great grandmother suffered for the better part of half a decade because of this line of thinking. I cannot imagine being able to live with myself for allowing someone I love to suffer to that extent for that long.
I‚Äôm not insulting you, for the record. Just trying to explain where it is I'm coming from.
Who are you to tell someone else that they have to keep suffering an existence they hate and that causes them unimaginable pain on your behalf?
Many people also believe they should have a say in other people's abortions and vasectomy rights and they absolutely do not.
This is mostly what I was referring to anyway. A lot of people with neurodegenerative diseases can suffer for years and years only to be put on life support and have the plug pulled anyway, *after* suffering.
I personally don't feel like other ‚Äúpeople around me‚Äù deserve any say in what I do with my body, any more than they do having an abortion or child or vasectomy.
I can see it.
But like, people with terminal, uncuranle illnesses that are 100% going to kill them young like the one disease that ossifies soft tissue?
And, of course, it should be a last resort when you‚Äôve tried everything else.
And obviously you should still try to talk it over with your family and friends, or at least be sure to tell them a decent ways in advance so they have time to process it.
Not saying I would, for the record. Just that I don‚Äôt feel like I would especially ‚Äúowe‚Äù anything to anyone if I did.
Assisted suicide is a tricky topic but at the end of the day proper ways to do it that ease pain and suffering are much preferable to ‚ÄúDIY‚Äù methods and people who really want to are going to do it regardless of how. So long as both the doctor and you consent I don‚Äôt think you owe it to anyone but yourself to keep on living, provided you don‚Äôt have dependents or people that otherwise cannot care for themselves.
Just now realized how it could be taken differently than I intended.
For the record when I say ‚Äúif that makes sense‚Äù I mean ‚Äúif I'm explaining myself well enough because Autism makes communication hard‚Äù and not ‚Äúif you dumbasses can understand my 200 IQ Galaxy Brain‚Äù
If that makes sense.

At the very least I know that nobody here is coming from like

Like if we all natively spoke Italian or Polish or English
It could just be a language barrier, too? I could be wrong but I feel like it would exclude a lot of the vagueness that comes with second languages if that makes sense.
And we generally agree on the abortion issue.
I think.
Lank is saying the abortion issue is more complex.
If that makes sense
And trying to explain my position as to why I find it impossible to be supportive of one but dismissive of another when doing so is something I believe is contradictory.
I was not arguing about abortion. I was using abortion as a comparison because it raises similar ethical issues.
The point of the channel is to quarantine more bleak discussion so I, very possibly incorrectly, assumed that being in this channel was express permission bring up unsavory topics.
I feel like I‚Äôm at least doing a better job than I used to, right?
<:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
I don‚Äôt know what that means
Does it come across well that I'm trying to be very intentional with my words so as to not cause any harm or offense?
I mean like
That sounded so fucking bad when I read it back
Aaaa
Why is this so fucking hard
Aaaa
I'm trying to word everything very specifically to avoid unintentionally coming across like sarcastic dick.
This is a genuinely thank you, for the record.
So thank you.
Lank explained it better than I did.
I'm not stupid, even though it often seems that way.
I know what conscientious objection is.
One person objecting should not bring the process to a complete stop, which is what I was trying to get at.
It's too vague a definition, which is why Lank and I talked about mandatory referrals.
So I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about that.
Also what Lank said, but I think everyone knew what you meant.
Which is why I brought it up in the way that I did.
That is what I was directly focusing on.
You literally cannot use the ripple effect argument without bringing other people into the equation.
The ripple effect directly involves other people.
That's what I'm trying to say, Lank.
Yeah, I could not disagree more with that assessment.
There is someone who is not you deciding they have a say in your bodily autonomy.
Shame Southern states are comically gerrymandered because if they were actually fair with their electoral system I'd imagine a lot of states would be blue.
It's one person's right to bodily autonomy versus an outsider who should have no say in it.
I disagree with that as well. I stand by my statement that I think it's an applicable comparison to a similar issue.
I sincerely doubt anyone holds that opinion.
Just that I absolutely, vehemently disagree.

Also warehouses requiring employees to stay through storms/snowstorms/etc is basically universal, unfortunately.
Amazon has literally allowed people to die at work from overexertion Mac, lol
Bootlickers are always a thing.
I meant here, in this chat.
Most employees I know hate OSHA as much as the big corpos do, lol
Exactly.
Having storm precaution systems are super common for warehouses. Amazon not having one just makes it even worse for them.
I don‚Äôt think anyone was saying Amazon shouldn‚Äôt be to blame.
Most distribution centers don‚Äôt.
I‚Äôm surprised Amazon allowed phones on the floor at all.

The restaurant would call you on your day off to tell you ‚Äúyeah you're working today‚Äù and some of my coworkers were fired for refusing
And the overtime here is optional.
Even the part-time workers at Apple get benefits and stuff.
The mom and pop place would always give all their employees juuust under 40 hours of work a week, because then you didn‚Äôt legally qualify as a full-time employee and they didn‚Äôt have to offer benefits or luxuries afforded to full time workers.
And that's with sixty hour work weeks, lol
Hell, I'm treated better at a fucking Apple warehouse than I was when I worked for a mom and pop restaurant.
A small business that exploits its employees is no better than a massive corporation that exploits its employees.
Like I said, if any business owner can‚Äôt pay their employees properly, it doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre big or small.
And businesses are feeling the pressure.
Workers are getting out, and politicians and business owners are seething about it. ‚ÄúDon't like it? Leave!‚Äù Well guess what, they're leaving.
If politicians are good at one thing, it's doing absolutely nothing to help anyone ever.
I was responding to Lank.
Time is pro-Hitler?
Especially 2006
And as much as I hate the prick, he has a massive impact on current events.
Plenty of awful people have made Person of the Year
I think Stalin was as well
Hitler was a person of the year, lol
It's about global impact
Person of the Year is not necessarily an endorsement
This discussion happens every year

The only good part of getting my wisdom teeth removed was having an excuse to eat nothing but soup
I'd say weird feelings is absolutely normal.
I mean you‚Äôre basically high, lol
You live in Ohio, right? IIRC you should be able to get scrapple there
The benefit of scrapple is that you can easily gum it but it's still really meaty and savory.
Voy and Ten use <:OgawaRead:688429716507721770> all the time to mean ‚Äúnoted‚Äù so it's permanently etched in my mind, lol
Oh, and scrapple and eggs!
One thing I recommend once it heals a bit more: ask your parents to try making hamburger steak with gravy and mashed potatoes. It's very easy on the gums, but waaay more filling and satisfying than snack stuff.
My grandfather had most of his teeth removed as well, but he gums most of his stuff.
I was the latter.
Or is it more of a ‚Äúsoup and protein drinks‚Äù kind of deal?
Have you just been gumming soft stuff?
The grift that keeps on giving.
And they did it anyway
So clearly they expected this to happen, right?
That actually makes sense
Oh
I‚Äôm actually impressed it can somehow tell when someone is using it unethically. How does it know if it‚Äôs tracking you without your knowledge?
And now their whole gimmick is "these items are worth real money"
Their defense this whole time as to why it wasn't gambling was "b-but the items aren't worth real money"
But seeing their greed backfire spectacularly would probably kick them down a few pegs
It's still bad, don't get me wrong
This could be good, as if they combine NFT with loot crates which they will almost certainly do, they could get their fucking teethed kicked in by gambling laws
Thank you for explaining!
Ohhh
The speaker I mean, not the AirTags.
Even if it's already paired to another device?
How does it show up in my device?
If some stranger has a Bluetooth speaker that I'm not paired with
No I mean like
If it didn‚Äôt update how would it populate the list of available devices?
How do you pair it, then?
I mean one's it's not currently paired with.
Why would the auto-scan one drain battery more than your phone's Bluetooth which refreshes frequently anyway?
I already don‚Äôt like AirTags because packing them makes me want to die.
The investors wanted short-term profit. And they willingly fucked over the customers to get it.
This is no different.
It's also why every crowdfunding site requires risks and challenges to be disclosed.
It is funding a project that *may* get you a product.
It's why stuff like Kickstarter specifically says that backing is *not* buying a product.
You don‚Äôt gamble if you can‚Äôt afford to lose.
Again, investing is inherently a gamble.
And I see that as very obviously sharing part of the blame.
CDPR fumbled the project hard, but the investors pressured them to release it as is.
If I hold a gun to your head and tell you to kick a dog, and you kick the dog instead of getting shot, are you to blame for kicking the dog?
The investors knew the game was unfinished, man
So because the investors were impatient, the customers getting scammed was justified?
They deserve one another.
I'm saying CDPR and the investors are both to blame.
That's not at all what I'm doing.
I disagree.
Who were sold an unfinished game *because* of CDPR and the investors.
The real victims were the consumers.
You shouldn‚Äôt invest money if you can‚Äôt afford to lose it
Investing is a gamble. Not every gamble pays off.
I said the investors deserved it
And I never said it was.
So I say fuck 'em
These people directly scammed paying customers out of their money
A delayed game has the potential to still be good. An unfinished game will be shit no matter when it launches.
If they pressured the company to release an unfinished game and then were surprised when it bombed they're dumb as hell
And if true they absolutely deserved it
Because they thought they delays looked bad
I remember reading an interview with one of the devs talking about one of the whole reasons the game was rushed and unfinished was because the investors wanted it to launch sooner
They‚Äôre the last people who should get the money
On the other, fuck investors
On one hand, CDPR fucked up massively and deserve to pay for it
lol
I keep it for my artist friends‚Äô stuff and to post Gear porn that gets retweeted because I know you guys like it

Yeah, but the idea that western culture is inherently more valuable is a bit ehhh
The term coming from the idea that it was the (ostensibly) civilized white peoples burden to westernize the ‚Äúsavage‚Äù people of color.
It‚Äôs a term for the phenomenon that kind of peaked during colonialism where all the predominantly white countries pretended they were actually doing the colonized countries a favor by ‚Äúcivilizing‚Äù them.
Teens are angsty and moody and full to the brim with hormones. I‚Äôd imagine he‚Äôll grow out of it.
Imagine having to live knowing you‚Äôre related to this sentient human thumb
What
I'm more saying this is akin to doctors prescribing unnecessary medications because they get incentives from pharmaceutical corporations.
Being openly smarmy and condescending is classified under aggro, yes.
Is there any particular reason you're being so unnecessarily aggro right now?
There it is
Ayyy
So you're just playing devil's advocate to what? Irritate people?
And again, I'm just trying to understand what you're trying to get out of it.
You just seem heavily invested in it for someone who claims to be impartial.
Are you implying we don't?
To what end?
I meant in general. You often go to bat in defense of crypto most of the times it's brought up here.
I just don't see why you seem very hell-bent on defending it even though you openly admit it helps almost no-one
I'm just trying to get a handle on what you expect to get out of all this.
Are you particularly wealthy/have very wealthy friends?
Crypto is a tool for the rich to get richer at the expense of the poor, like pretty much everything else related to investing.
Hence being a grift.
Most make a pitance and the rest lose out bigtime.
Exactly. 99% of people who get obscenely wealthy with crypto were already incredibly weatlhy before
Which is what this is
It's a grift when you intentionally mislead people which in turn helps you gain a lot of money on illiquid assets that you know have no inherent value
More than likely they're just going to find new ways to grift people with crypto stuff.
This is modern capitalism. It's only downhill from here.
This is an exceedingly optimistic take, lol
What the fuck??
EX-FUCKING-SCUSE ME?
WHAT
BROO??
It is exaggeration.
‚ÄúWeekle‚Äù is genuinely a foul word and I hate that you've brought it into existence.
Maybe both
I can‚Äôt tell whether to weep or cackle at how horrendously tasteless this is.
Pardon me for not entirely believing that given your snide comments.
You win, man. Are you happy?
So I'll just concede, whether or not I actually agree.
And I would very much like to be playing video games right now.
Listen. I am very much trying to make myself clear here. I have, repeatedly during this conversation, laid out my issues with it and my rationale for assuming that your vested interest in it. You have repeatedly asked me questions I have already answered multiple times, which either means you're intentionally being obtuse or just not reading what I'm typing. In either case, it's obvious to me that you're not going to actually read what I have to write.
And I see that as a net negative outcome.
I am talking about the job that you have at this exact moment in time that is how you are currently making your money.
That's not what I'm saying, man
That may not otherwise be the case if you had a non-crypto-related job
I am saying that your employment, which you currently have, which is based on crypto, would be rendered moot if the technology didn't propgate; and so you have a direct monetary interest in standing up for what you perceive as a slight against it.
That's not what I said.
Because your source of income would vanish with the technology.
That was not what I meant at all. I'm saying that "not being involved in something" will generally not lead to confirmation biases like directly being involved with it would. I don't stand to gain anything from my position. You very much do.
Is "not collecting stamps" a hobby?
Even if you don't agree, you could at least see how it could come across that way?
You also still haven't addressed whether or not you see how your employment being linked to all this could colour your views and potentially lead you to seek out information that supports it rather than that is objective, though.
Pretending as if crypto isn't an enormous competent of it is willful ignorance at this point.
Which was not previously as bad.
At the expense of an enormous resource cost, electronics shortages, and environmental impact, yes
Apple is one of the biggest corporations on the planet. Getting a tenth or even a hundredth of their market cap is huge.
I'm saying that you have a vested interest in propogating it whether or not you approve of how it's being used.
But you do at least see how one could get the impression that your dependence on the technology, in the field that you make your income, currently being used mostly to swindle people could colour your views on it, right?
I usually see patriotism as a stepping stone for nationalism. They don‚Äôt *have* to lead one into the other, but they often do.

They're probably put a five-sentence paragraph devoted to him in between the loot boxes and the time-saving microtransactions in the Madden NFL store or something.

I know he actually voiced himself in the EA game series up until like 2010 or something.
He's been out of the biz since 2007 or so, right?
Hard to imagine what the NFL would be like without him.

I assumed no such thing.

I honestly don‚Äôt like thinking about apes and human ancestors because the fact that there used to be so many kinds  of us and now there's only like five extant species or like eight including subspecies is depressing as hell
Neoliberals be like ‚Äúclearly the solution to nobody voting for democrats is to move even further right‚Äù.
The difference is that the term ‚Äúcreation theory‚Äù by modern definitions is almost exclusively used to refer to intelligent design, which in itself is just religious Christian rebranded to appear scientific when it's anything but.

my flgs and game cafes both have strict covid guidelines

ive made some friends at my local tabletop gaming store by going for their open game nights for example
there are also groups for people with social anxiety you can go to and they'd probably be covered mostly by insurance
like going to meetups for hobbies you have or something similar
so i think you could probably make friends pretty easily if you‚Äôre actively trying
also you've always seemed really nice and fun to talk to

I feel like ‚Äúlockdowns wouldn‚Äôt stop it 100% so we just shouldn‚Äôt have them at all‚Äù is a very lackadaisical stance.
Which is why we need actual lockdowns.

We need a dedicated channel for Fuwa and Lank to argue about crypto.

Wasn't your whole reason for bringing up the topic the fact that you wanted to *limit* sound deadening?
Not sure I'm a fan of hit-and-run in the serious discussion channel.
I mean it's always been fairly arbitrary.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd consider COVID an existential threat to humanity at all, honestly.
It brought it the idea of it to a lot more people‚Äôs attention.

THE FURRED REICH
Countries and governments famously *never* intentionally misrepresent themselves as propaganda
Part of me wonders if people who think Nazis were actually socialists also think the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is actually a democratic republic because they claim to be in their title.
Can confirm, I am short.
Also yeah, the idea of "music" is so nebulous and malleable that saying it needs any of those things is inherently reductionist.
It is impossible to ridicule Shapiro too much.
who would have thunk

A lot of these anti-government people are also the huge ‚Äúrah rah cops and troops‚Äù type, which I wonder how they‚Äôd reconcile when these exact same people would be the ones shooting them dead in the street.
Ohhh
Also is there anything techy going on, or is it just people giving out their username and password?
Ah, I guess that makes sense
But why would people who grew up with it be *less* informed?
Most of the posts I've seen seem pretty obvious, and you'd think people who use it would be in the more tech-savvy crowd, right?
How do so many people fall for this stuff?

I feel like that‚Äôs too simple an answer
What is it with Russia and bungling the early-game conflict stuff? It seems to consistently take them a while to get their shit together.
I genuinely have no goddamn clue what this means.
It seems like more of a war of public opinion and discourse, maybe?

Are we talking about the same thing here?

Does it?
Anti-war?
Why would state journos post Russian-critical content in the first place, especially when it paints the military in a monumentally negative light?
Could just be the translation, obviously, but the way its structured seems kind of fake? Like it could be Ukrainian disinfo but I also wouldn't be surprised given the dumb shit Putin has said.
Communication and logistics are generally some of the first things to go.
No it isn't?
People thought WWI was never going to happen because it would ruin the global economy and plunge everyone into debt, and nobody would *ever* do that.
But does whether it's direct or not make that much of a difference when politicians are frequently just bought out by billionaires and corpos anyway?
Why do we call Russian shitheel billionaires "oligarchs" but western shitheel billions that have roughly the same amount of political influence are just "billionaires"? Just historicity?

I am going to lie down in a hole and cover myself with dirt.
I mean, the sentiment will probably still be there, but people can only be open about it for so long before Russia clamps down even harder.
I wonder how long the anti-war movement in Russia is going to last.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I know the intent behind it. It's just surreal to me.
For real though, the response to this war has been bizarre. If you would have told me about like, porn sites protesting an invasion by blocking the aggressor from watching smut, I'd have though you were unhinged.
Same thing

It‚Äôs about optics.
I‚Äôd imagine that the sports leagues banning Russia is that many international athletics organizations are ostensibly predicated on the idea of international unity (they‚Äôre about money, but they‚Äôre not going to say that) so keeping a member that invaded another member would make them look hypocritical.
"Offbrand Green Tories" is such a funny way to describe them

My favorite is when they parade around queer content for pride month, but only do it on the regions where LGBTQ+ people are already normalized. The places that need it the most like Russia and the Middle East? Fuck ‚Äòem. They get nothing, because it would hurt the almighty brand.
And there's literally no country that's 100% super amazing all the time.
Obviously it's not cut and dry, though.
Ethnostates and theocracies are usually not super great on their own. Israel being *both* leads to some sketch stuff.
And I can't say I'm a fan of how corps are specifically targeting them, even if I understand why
But the average Russian citizen having to suffer because of the decisions of shitty politicians sucks ass
Putin and his ilk deserve to have their names smeared in mud

The average citizen? Absolutely.
This is hilarious, actually.
I still find it hilarious how CoD attributed US and UK war crimes to the Russians as if Russia hadn't done super sus stuff itself. Like bro, you know you don't have to include US warcrimes in your recruiting propaganda, right? Just don't put them in.
Elon Musk "shut the fuck up for five minutes" challenge [gone wrong] [impossible]
BBC also simps for the Royal Family and it's the cringiest shit.
Etc, etc.
The BBC has generally good content, but they also humor anti-LGBT peeps because of "giving an equal platform."
Like going to The Washington Post for content about unions and corporations is a bad idea because it's basically a mouthpiece for Jeff Bezos on those topics, but other stuff they do is usually fine.
More often than not the reporting is fine, but obviously different sites will have different biases.
But saying "every mainstream news source is lying to you and the only trustworthy sources are no-name far-right propaganda websites with no credibility" is more often than not the natural end to stuff like that.
Treat news with skepticism and consider the biases, obviously.
Not that I necessarily disagree, but this phrase is more often used as a cope for confirmation bias and people not wanting to hear things that challenge them than it is for news sources actually being untrustworthy.
Fox News is notorious for sensationalism.
We live in the dumbest timeline
That‚Äôs stupid
Moving work hours just gives us less sun in the times when we actually have free time
Because it‚Äôs exceedingly more convenient.
The idea of noon being the moment the sun is at its highest point has almost no practical value outside of tradition and some very specific use cases
Etc
And it means kids have time to play after school
For most people, having sunlight when getting out of work will be much more useful.
About the only people this negatively impacts are people who work later in the day
And this is the same thing

The system is literally built to tell people these things are bad
Again, these are all very well and good in concept. How do you intend to get these passed, though?
I‚Äôm not saying you don‚Äôt realize it.
I think giving people false hope is exceedingly cruel
I‚Äôm saying that all these ideas would require you to address the root isuue
The disparity between the source of civilian and military weapons in modern times are so obscenely separated
What is Joe down the street going to do with his hunting rifle against a drone?
Do you think guerrillas are going to stand a chance against the US military?
You‚Äôd have to have a literal revolution
I‚Äôm coming from a point of view of someone who‚Äôs done a ton of community volunteer work at stuff like soup kitchens. The roots of the issue are so deep that pulling up the tree to replace it is borderline impossible.
Saying ‚Äúwe should make housing a human right‚Äù doesn‚Äôt give the homeless places to live.
The intangible concept of an idea helps no one.
Intent without solutions is worthless
I don‚Äôt agree with this at all.
Or is fraudulent
Or doesn‚Äôt count
You can say ‚Äúvote in local elections and get active in your community‚Äù, but that exact community is purpose built so that your vote doesn‚Äôt matter
Practically
Again, this is entirely surface level. How do we do this?
I‚Äôm not the hopeful type and I doubt I ever will be.
But I have no hopes that it‚Äôll accomplish anything
It‚Äôs refreshing
Genuinely
Although I do admire it
I cannot agree with your optimism.
I think I‚Äôd consider it naivety
But when you can say ‚Äúlet‚Äôs give homeless people homes‚Äù and the people in power are like ‚Äúyeah that sounds bad‚Äù
Call me a cynic if you will
Lofty ideals with no practical way to enact them, while admirable, are borderline worthless
And with the current system, it‚Äôs set in place so that specifically the people who are making the bad decisions get to keep making them in perpetuity.
But we‚Äôd need to radically change the way we do almost everything over such a long period of time
There‚Äôs a lot of things that we could do better
These are all very good ideas, but the chances of them happening are slim to none
So you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs never going to happen.
I agree about the work thing, but again, it‚Äôs incredibly easy to say ‚Äúlet‚Äôs fix the work thing‚Äù but monumentally hard to change
If you have an actual solution I‚Äôd be interested in hearing it, because we can conjecture about how good it would be but it would also be massively impractical.
Thats not a good thing
Changing school times would require a huge societal shift
So your solution is to substantially increase inconvenience for basically everybody so little timmy does better in math class
I‚Äôd rather we give children time to themselves than minmax their study habits
And standardized testing
Not to mention stuff like homework is stupid in the first place
Kids famously love studying
I‚Äôm sure the children will be very happy to give up their free time in exchange for marginally better study hours
You‚Äôd rather kids have no sunlight in the afternoon when they‚Äôre actually out of school?
Just so we keep a useless metric of sun height
Why would anyone want to get up at 4 am
Aren‚Äôt Ukraine and Russia largely using a lot of the same tanks? Or am I misremembering?
Part of me wonders why Russia never seems to improve on that front, but then I realize they have this habit of just kind of throwing more shit at the problem because they can generally afford to more than smaller countries.
Because the condemnation has been almost universal.
I don‚Äôt even think NATO is factoring into it *quite* that much. I just mean that even a lot of their allies, or as close to something like allies that Russia has, are hesitant to associate them.
Plus they‚Äôve basically spiked their reputation on the world stage through the goddamn floor.
I think it's a foregone conclusion that Russia will ‚Äúwin‚Äù, but they‚Äôre definitely going to end the conflict battered and bruised to high hell.
I gotta go pick my brother up from work but if you guys are still going when I get back I‚Äôll join back in
Yes
You guys keep trying to pin it to a single issue when I‚Äôm talking about it as a whole
I‚Äôm not talking regional
I‚Äôm specifically referring to voting.
Because it keeps them in power
It‚Äôs expressly built to average it out
The current system is not weighted to where population is
In cities, maybe?
Things like mass media and state propaganda were absolutely existent in the 1800s, just in a different form
I‚Äôm including the 1900s in modern
‚ÄúBefore‚Äù didn‚Äôt have the massive level of systemic disinformation and vilification of socialist policies we have in the modern US.
Are you genuinely comparing changing an arbitrary time standard to completely upending a centuries-long self-perpetuating system of power
Again, goals help nobody if they‚Äôre unachievable.

Hopefully they're aight.

Unfortunately "what ifs" won't change anything.
Part of me wonders if things could have ended differently if they had had someone to talk to.
I'd imagine they left most of their servers beforehand like they've done here a couple times.
We can lend an ear if you think it'd help.
Again, chocolate is a very small part of everything Nestle owns.
You seem weirdly focused on the chocolate thing
For the record Lank, they haven‚Äôt stopped selling in Russia. I was responding to Lily‚Äôs message implying they should.
Nestle in particular is one of the biggest owners of brands for infant food.
Kat, Nestle is one of the biggest companies on the planet. It‚Äôs nowhere near ‚Äújust chocolate‚Äù.
NGL you two seen incredible vindictive about something the average person has literally no control over
And the average person in Russia what, doesn‚Äôt deserve anything other than basic necessities because their government sucks?
I wonder why it's so niche.
I'm actually surprised at how, like, normal the people who join are. I've been in some larger servers and they can attract a lot of strange people. I'm not sure how else to describe it. They just kind of give me weird vibes if that makes sense.
They know when and when not to apply pressure.
Iunno,  I wouldn't call it lax. I'd moreso say that it's generally well-targeted.
I've been in a metric shit-ton of public and/or larger servers and this is by far the best.
Setting aside the personal grudges some of us can occasionally harbor, I think this server is generally very respectful and the mods do a damn good job of keeping the place aight.
I honestly don't see much of a good outcome for Ukraine even if they reach an agreement.

‚ÄúRussia must be willing to invade Ukraine and topple it‚Äôs government if that‚Äôs what is necessary to stop a proposed security pact between NATO and the Eastern European nation going ahead, one commenter has argued‚Äù
But his reasons, unlike the filmmakers, seem solid enough
He was still absolutely awful in all those movies and clearly wasn‚Äôt trying, and I do have moral qualms about shitty films doing bait-and-switch by pretending to star big celebrities
Probably trying to shore up his family in case he passed.
That would explains why he was taking on all those no-effort garbage roles in no-budget movies.
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a solid argument. The greedy will be greedy regardless of the state of the economy. Billionaires prove that it doesn‚Äôt matter how much money you have, people will still be shitty if they think they can make even more.

Is there a way to hide threads until you click on the parent channel?
Which unfortunately happens semi-frequently even with the 1 hour rule
It'd also mean that drawings people do wouldn't be drowned out by fanfic discussion.
Actually you raise a good point
Threads are a nightmare to moderate and I absolutely do not think they should be enabled.
Fair enough. I agree there's not much else that can be said on the matter.
Nothing more, nothing less.
I aired my two cents like everyone else.
If that's the way you see me then there's nothing I can say to change it.
You're reading ill-intent where there is none. I'm saying that context clues are important.
Aria, I'm not trying to insult you, but you're very, very aggressive when it comes to people not 100% sticking to perfect channel topics at all times. These things would escalate much less if you left moderation to actual mods.
There's a lot to be said for using context clues.

Damn man that take is kind of fucked up ngl

I‚Äôm out
I‚Äôll just let you get back to your ‚Äúkill all the Russians‚Äù thing then, I guess
Ok
You kind of want the average Russian to not hate us if you want them to stop supporting a war they‚Äôre being sold to by the government as entirely being ‚Äúthe west is literally Satan‚Äù
Sanctions aren‚Äôt going to do anything except entrench the average person further down into the ‚Äúthe West is the devil‚Äù rabbit hole. World War I and II proved that a lot of modern states can have their economies stretched to the breaking point and they‚Äôll still keep going.
And it‚Äôs the same thing the far-right does with spreading the ‚Äúother news sites and rumors are fake news!!!‚Äù shtick.
Most people just don‚Äôt care enough
But humans aren‚Äôt practical 100% of the time
If we approach this from a practical perspective, yeah.
And?
If you have a 5 star restaurant that‚Äôs half an hour away or gross lil McDonald‚Äôs down the street, most people aren‚Äôt going to go to the five star restaurant.
Hence why I also said effort.
China has some of the most isolated internet on the planet and even *then* very few people use VPNs, although it‚Äôs obviously growing.
Since it takes effort and money.
And again, even  a lot of younger people most likely aren‚Äôt going to go out of their way to use VPNs
So that‚Äôs what I was going by.
The 50% statistic, which was the entire impetus of the conversation, was everyone.
But the poll was *everyone* not specifically potential conscripts.
Most people - in any country - are too lazy to go out of their way for this kind of thing.
Do you think all the little old babushkas are subscribing to NordVPN
Oh yeah because the average person definitely uses VPNs
What do you expect when western sites are either or forbidden or intentionally stopped providing news for the Russians? All they have is state media.

Oh?
No, it‚Äôs obviously bad. But it doesn‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt still roll my eyes when a US politician acts sanctimonious about another non-US country invading another country.
Because it's damn obvious that they‚Äôd find some way to justify it if they were on the giving end.
The whole stance of banning certain kinds of weapons reeks of disingenuous ‚Äúrules for the but not for me‚Äù
Countries will stoop to the lowest shit if they think it‚Äôll give them an edge.
Haven‚Äôt most great powers used chemical weapons at some point? I think there‚Äôs very little that‚Äôs off the table when war comes to war. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me in the slightest.
I‚Äôm not sure why some people are so convinced there‚Äôs going to be nukes. Not anyone here, for the record, there‚Äôs just a lot of talk about it for some reason.
Yeah, this is what I mean. Russia has been throwing shit at the wall and seeing if it sticks in a way that defies a lot of common sense arguments that would otherwise be right.
Putin seems hellbent on making this a thing.
I‚Äôm just wary of the idea that Russia could dig in their heels out of sheer spite.
That‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúifs‚Äù and ‚Äúcoulds‚Äù
Televangelists are no different in Russia, apparently.

That latter one seems almost entirely unlikely, though.
I'm assuming it's specifically the troops that they're worried about?
To Russia, I mean.
But they'd still be armed to the teeth by NATO member states, which seems like it's largely just as unhelpful.
And they've been shelling out like nuts.
But the US doesn't need a defense clause to shell out military aid.
The legal wording is by "all means in their power".
AFIAK it's only been invoked once, but it's there.
Everything I'm seeing implies there is a specific mutual defense clause that obliges them to at *least* render aid.
Why is Sweden and Finland joining NATO so much more of a problem than them being part of the EU? Doesn't an EU country being invaded also invoke a mutual defense clause? Or is Russia *solely* just worried about the US and UK being legally bound to respond? Especially when they've both already demonstrating willingness to get involved heavily via arms dealing and weapons loans programs regardless of legal obligations?
I‚Äôll believe it when I see it.

Fuck me, Nuker types so fast.
Just with multiple factions.
Wars are events expressly organized around working together.
Exactly.
Not use cluster munitions? There are weapons much less likely of inflicting civilian casualties, my guy.
The world sucking isn't a good reason to *keep* it sucking.
I really dislike that excuse.
"I'd love for children to not starve in Africa, but we don't live in a perfect world."
We live in an imperfect world. That doesn't mean it has to be imperfect.
I am of the opinion that they should not have been violated in the first place and that they should not have been subsequently violated.
War crimes are war crimes regardless of perceived justification.
There's no acceptable justification for the endangerment of civilians in my mind.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I'm not going to handwave away war crimes just because the guys I support are the ones doing it.
So when are you going to enlist? You've been very vocal about the war despite being in the safety of your own home.
Sound strategy.
So they kill their own first. Got it.
National survival doesn't mean much when all your civilians are dead after the war, now does it?
I don't give a shit if it's "militarily understandable", to be brutally honest.
That's what bothers me the most.
And like I said, it's mostly about the fact that *these* particular war crimes are especially vile because the primary danger is unnecessary civilian casualties.
I think it's gross
That‚Äôs true for Russian war crimes as well. I‚Äôm saying that there being war crimes *at all* should be condemned.
AFAIK Russian state media hasn‚Äôt even addressed this incident.
This wasn‚Äôt a case of Russian media or state representatives alleging this. It was the result of a third party investigation.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Russia has done worse by far and infinitely more frequently. But stuff like this and the footage of Ukrainian soldiers executing a POW should absolutely be condemned just as severely as any other human rights violation by any other country.
We can‚Äôt just handwave away any evidence of Ukraine being shitty because it's not Russia. We're not playing into Russia propaganda by condemning something like this.
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/18/world/europe/ukraine-forces-cluster-munitions.html
This was an investigation done by the New York Times.
*This* time.
At the very least, there are no suspected deaths from it.
Soldiers die, and it's unfortunate, but in the end they often are people who signed up for it. There's a consent angle to it. Civilians didn‚Äôt give that consent. They're just being slaughtered so that opposing militaries have a slightly easier job killing their military opponents. They don‚Äôt *need* to use cluster weapons, tactical nukes, or chemical weapons. They just do it because it's *easier*.
Still fucking in awe at just how little militaries give a shit about civilians.
To some extent I understand this kind of thing. Total warfare has been an unfortunate reality for over a century at this point
Saw somewhere that Ukraine is likely to have used cluster munitions in suburban areas. War really does bring out the worst in people.

No no, there was footage of it *prior* to sinking.

I‚Äôm surprised you kept them around so long, although we still have monuments for Confederate leaders and slaveowners so I guess we‚Äôre not much better.

Holy fuck look at Estonia go
We won‚Äôt know until they actually formally start, though.
From what I understand the NLRB doesn‚Äôt investigate unless they're presented with credible evidence, so the fact that they‚Äôre publicly posting it at all does lend the allegations some weight.
Didn't you know?
Sorry, but if you say literally anything mean about capitalism you're basically a Maoist.

News corps and Facebook have rotted my relative's brains
But implying Germany *owes* them support and that if they don't they're "moral degenerates" is just not it.
Obviously I'm all for Germany supporting Ukraine.
This I'm much more inclined to agree with.
Unironically using the term "moral degenerate" is kind of cringe regardless of the context imo
üôÑ
>"moral degenerates"
That was a depressing read
Other than being a gutless coward who has reneged on most of his campaign promises despite having control over both the house and the senate, you mean?
I was trying to imply that it *was* biting but not at full effectiveness.
Or is it only biting if there's teeth?
I mean gumming is still technically biting isn't it?
I feel like "all bark no bite" implies they're making un-credible threats they have no intent of following up on. They *did* follow up with the full-on invasion, they just suck ass at it. This is more akin to having both the bark and the bite, but most of the dog's teeth fell out so all they can really do is gum.
Genuinely how are they this bad at their jobs
That didn‚Äôt take long.
I misunderstood
Ohhh
And obviously early rocket research in WWII
Yes, but modern rocket technology is just non-war applications of technology developed for weapons programs during the cold war.
If that makes sense
I feel like you could pretty confidently make the argument that war drives technological progression, since a lot of civilian technology is derived from stuff previously developed for use in war, but just because it‚Äôs currently that way doesn‚Äôt mean it *has* to be that way.
If that makes sense
And obviously trying not to assume negative intent when you‚Äôre unsure of what someone is trying to say, but people can only work with what you give them, and both of us have issues dealing with anger and frustration that can obviously lead people to the conclusion that we‚Äôre doing ‚Äúthat Matt/Das thing‚Äù again.
My recommendation is to stop and think of how your messages *could* be interpreted before you post. I can definitely be an asshole, but there are a lot of times when I phrase something poorly in a way that‚Äôs open to interpretation. And because I am predisposed to being an asshole, it gets read as me being a dick even if that wasn‚Äôt my intent. The best way to handle this kind of stuff is to stop it before it happens, *both* by carefully reading back your messages for potential vagueness and by improving negative behavior on your own part that may lead to you having a poor reputation that would contribute to people interpreting your messages negatively.
The curse of balal at work again
This is obviously an extreme example meant for demonstrative purposes, but imagine wanting to say ‚Äúman, this meal is all great, but I *especially* love the mashed potatoes‚Äù, but due to poor communication it comes out more like ‚Äúthese mash potatoes are great!‚Äù And while that‚Äôs technically still what you were trying to say, someone else may interpret the lack of precision as meaning, like, ‚ÄúI *only* like the mashed potatoes‚Äù.
I think a lot of the frustration comes from how people interpret it rather than just not being able to express yourself properly. People will notice the imprecision or vagueness and will sometimes fill in the gaps with their own interpretations which may or may not read ill-intent or negative implications where there originally were none.
Windows ME deserved to last much less than 6
IIRC Windows 10 usage shot up like crazy in 2020 when they killed W7

Booting Linux from a USB can be way more convenient than a fresh install of Windows if you just need to get something done real quick, which is nice.
My Linux experience was less installing drivers and more *reinstalling* them when something inevitably broke.
Android I mean
No it‚Äôs straight up a Linux fork
I moreso mean that stuff like Mint or Ubuntu look cheap or amateur
TBH they‚Äôd need to massively revamp Linux to make it appealing to most people. A ton of distros and skins look amateur as hell or just downright ugly, and on top of compatibility issues you have to interact with the terminal for pretty much everything that‚Äôs more than mildly complicated and that‚Äôs annoying as hell for most people.

Yeah, that's why I said it would be a good starting point.
I'm not entirely sure I trust Wikipedia but I suppose it's a decent starting point.
I think they're considered a great power, right?
The US is the only current world superpower, right? I know there are still a handful of great powers, but Russia hasn't been considered a superpower since the collapse of the UUSR, correct?
Maybe
Maybe just tone it down
Also, this doesn‚Äôt explain why you were being a dick to Kat earlier.
I was fine until whatever just happened.
if you say so man
So instead of asking for clarification you throw a hissy fit?
If you know that I‚Äôm referring to specifically fashy military parades then why are you being such a dick
Militaries do not exist to further ‚Äúharmless causes‚Äù.
Yes?
???
Dude what‚Äôs your major malfunction?
TBH it‚Äôs almost impossible for any military parade to not look fashy because military parades in and of themselves are pretty fashy behaviour
Man, things have continued to just kind of stagnate. Is Russia just taking a long-ass time to regroup?

According to Wikipedia I was kind of right? They announced intentions to join Russia in 2008 but kept pushing back the referendum until now.
I'm not sure if they actually did a referendum
Or they considered it rather
I think they tried this before in like 2012 right?
And they've also been talking about joining Russia for absolute ages now.
Haven't they been occupying Georgia for like a decade and a half? SO has been a breakaway state for like 30 years.

There are a surprising amount of mass shootings at supermarkets
when someone makes a bomb threat it's generally investigated even if its unlikely
that's why i mentioned bomb threats
i just meant investigated
you making incorrect inferences isn't my fault? if i meant prosecuted i would have said prosecuted
i thought they were two separate events
ah, i see
oh, were the "smoking in a room" and "breaking safety regulations" the same thing?
is smoking indoors still legal in poland or something?
when was this?
extremizing is unhelpful and just encourages strawmen arguments
where on earth did you get that from?
i never said to prosecute him for that

God do we wish we could take it back, And now he's on our minds. Mitchell was **an hero,** to leave us feeling like this, Our minds are rubber, our joints don't work, Our tears fall into abyss. He was **an hero,** to take that shot, In life it wasn't his task, He shouldn't have had to go that way, before an decade'd past. Now he sits there in my heart, this hero of mine, Always there to make me smile, Make me feel just fine. He had courage,that boy did, courage in his heart. To take that shot, To end his pain, To tear us all apart. But in the end, he died in courage. Lacking, nevermore, He died a hero, Mitchell did, And we'll love him forevermore. We love you like an brother. We miss you so much. We will always love you, kid. Rest In Peace Mitch. ~Lila"
yes
I haven't thought about "an hero" in a decade or more.
no no, "not all heroes wear capes" is an expression used to mean that regular people can be heroes too

theres a shit-ton of teen pregnancies in the US
FR?
because eventually youre going to have to tell them and it'll fuck them up even more because they've been lied to for decades
no, i mean lying about their grandmother being their mother
that seems kind of fucked up to tell a child
why would they do that
they had free condoms and shit and everything
it was comprehensive sex ed too
ours did but for some reason teen pregnancies still happened
did your school have sex ed?
we had a couple, yeah
dude so many kids in my high school did drugs and had sex in the bathrooms lmao
What a colossal fuckup
And one of the main reasons you invaded in the first place, to strong-arm your neighbors so they don‚Äôt join an oppositional alliance, not only ruins your reputation on the world stage but almost overnight revereses decades-long public opinion on neutrality so they join anyway
You attack a much smaller nation expecting to quash them in a short span of time only for them to not only fail to be steamrolled like leadership seemingly intended, but repel or stall most of your attacks to the point where progress is incredibly slow
Imagine fucking up this bad.
So both Sweden and Finland are in the preliminary steps of joining NATO, apparently.

Free-range cats are much more likely to get incredibly dangerous diseases and parasitic infections.
Although letting your cats roam free is awful for the environment and the cat, so I probably wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing that anyway.

Ah.
I'm just confused as to why you brought it up then.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I never said it was?
I just mean that setting aside a small portion of troops and looking incompetent is already embarrassing them.
Wouldn't full mobilization be *more* likely if they're worried about looking weak?
What good is Russia's word anymore?
They also lied about *totally* not doing it, lol
Public support is already decreasing.
Isn't that information already disseminating?
I'm just not sure their reputation could sink too much lower.
The economics thing I can see though.
You say that like they haven't been embarrassing themselves this whole time.
What leads you to believe they won't fully mobilize?
Russia as in modern Russia?
As morbid as it sounds
I don't doubt there's a ton to be learned from it.
This is definitely one of the more "balanced" wars in recent memory.
But recently has been *really* bad.

It overturned public opinion almost overnight.
That‚Äôs what I mean
How
I‚Äôm still absolutely in awe that they thought this was a good idea or that it would successfully scare the Scandinavians out of joIning NATO.
Bad logistics are still logistics.
True, they can barely handle logistics with the comparatively small amount they have now.
I'm just unsure as to why they'd be worried about looking weak when everyone already thinks they are. Do you mean weak*er*?
A much smaller country is stalling their progress and they looked weak retreating from the Kyiv offensive.

You know what they say about big feet, right?
Possibly
It‚Äôll probably go up once the minimum wage does, because warehouses know that once the other jobs pay just as well they‚Äôre going to hemorrhage workers, and no warehouse I‚Äôve work at can sustainably survive off of just temps.
I mean PA minimum wage sucks ass, but it‚Äôs still better than most non-educated jobs. Stuff like construction and surveying still pay way better but those are harder and also seasonal
We‚Äôre making over 140% of our state‚Äôs minimum wage where I am.
Most people just stick with it because it pays considerably well. Warehouses are constantly trying to poach talent from other warehouses and so pay is pretty good and competitive.
My warehouse has stopped hiring temps and basically just kept the best workers and it‚Äôs been a lot nicer. I basically get trainer pay while barely having to train lol
During new product launches you‚Äôll be pulling in like $2300 a pay period with seasonal pay
Although that pay is probably pretty good and I know that having a good income is more important now than ever
I‚Äôm surprised you‚Äôre sticking with it. Warehouse jobs are plentiful and the pay is pretty competitive.
Goddamn lol
How many hours they got you doing?
FedEx drivers are usually pretty good. For some reason a lot of UPS trucks come in late, which is their problem not mine.
Weekends are the goddamn worst. Technically we have orders, but there are so few that most weekends you‚Äôre just sitting around.

You haven‚Äôt met warehouse workers. They give so little shits about management and it‚Äôs great.
At the end of the day shit like ‚Äúsame day shipping‚Äù and that kind of thing are unsustainable, but customers will raise a stink and corpos are all too happy to cater to them at the expense of their workers if it means money.
Because people need their stuff **now** and don‚Äôt care about logistics workers, and rather than disappoint customers and potentially lose them corpos bend over backwards to appease them at the expense of their workers. We had a customer raise a big stink because they received an improperly packed phone (it was a sloppy job yeah, but the phone was undamaged so that‚Äôs stupid as hell) and we had to have a staff meeting on it.
All the warehouses I‚Äôve worked at don‚Äôt generally hassle you if you‚Äôre making quota, but the moment you slip below that they‚Äôll give you all kinds of shit if you‚Äôre caught ‚Äútaking too long‚Äù.
It sucks but it‚Äôs hardly new, out of the ordinary, or exclusive to Amazon.
That‚Äôs just every warehouse, unfortunately. You log into your station or scan gun and it logs your activity. If you stop, it‚Äôll be noted in the system. They can tell how long you take to go to break, for example, by taking the difference between leaving your station (via the last part you packaged) and clocking out at the breakroom.

Driving is pretty easy once you get used to that specific car. It kind of becomes second nature, if that makes sense. You get used to how that particular car handles/accelerates/brakes/etc and so it‚Äôs more about just staying aware of your surroundings than about actually controlling the car.

||Shitting blood|| and really bad pain is something that happens with all hemorrhoids, generally.
Generally ||if the blood is red that‚Äôs a *good* sign, since it means the bleeding is really low in your digestive system.|| What you have to worry about is ||when it‚Äôs black, because that means it‚Äôs had time to coagulate.||

Plus in places like PA we have one of the biggest coal industries in the world, so it‚Äôs dirt cheap.

For the record Lily, nobody is saying you‚Äôre bad for feeling that way. Just that it‚Äôs worth considering *why* you feel that way and whether it‚Äôs a healthy outlook.
No no, what I mean is that it still involves stigmatization of the idea of disabilities
But I also get where you‚Äôre coming from.
I‚Äôm not sure I agree with that
FUCK HES TOO FAST
Disability in this case means you need accommodations, essentially.
The problem here isn‚Äôt considering gender dysmorphia a disability, it‚Äôs that people stigmatize having a disability as a negative rather than just being different.
It‚Äôs something that you‚Äôd want to receive medical ‚Äútreatment‚Äù for, right?
So

I don‚Äôt think Das owns a PC supply store
Yeah, building an inexpensive PC will still require a lot of the same knowledge as a specialty PC, so it‚Äôs not like you wouldn‚Äôt be learning.
Since it was just for friends and family you don‚Äôt have to deal with weird strangers, and because they‚Äôre fronting the cost you don‚Äôt need to have money to buy the parts.
He'd help them pick the parts, they‚Äôd buy them, and then he'd build it for them and charge a few hundred for his time.
I know a friend who paid a lot of their college tuition by building PCs for his friends and family.
My advice would be to learn a skill in your free time. You won‚Äôt be paid for it, but it will directly contribute once you‚Äôre able to get a job. Learning something like Microsoft Office/art/programming/PC maintenance gives you something to occupy your time but also teaches you a skill and lets you be productive on your own.

If there's something specific about the way I phrased it that caused confusion I'd genuinely appreciate the feedback.
I apologize if it came across as me trying to continue the argument. I'm being honest when I say I was just asking for clarification.
I'm genuinely lost.
This isn't a dig by the way.
Or if we're even arguing.
I'm honestly not sure what we're arguing about at this point.
I was asking for clarification on what you were referring to when you said you dropped it, because I was confused.
No? You seemed to want clarification so I provided it.
Ah, I see.
I'm just confused as to why you brought up Zuckerberg specifically if it wasn't related to our previous convo.
I'm saying I didn't think that counted as dropping it.
I'm not sure what you mean.
No?
It's directly related to culpability for the state of the internet though. It's literally just a continuation of the same argument.
This doesn't look like dropping it to me, Mel.

When did you try to drop it, exactly?
This is clearly just a difference of beliefs at this point so I don't see any point in continuing.
For example.
*Streaming games* exists because of Something Awful.
They're both pretty prominent reasons.
I'm working within the context of provable, existing events that we can directly connect to one another in a timeline. You're the one whose entire argument is predicated on "but what if..."
I'd also argue Zuck was directly responsible too.
All I can say is that I don't believe it for a second.
I'm not sure what to tell you.
He can't take the blame because in an alternate universe he wasn't the cause?
Hence "has anyone done more damage to the internet than Lowtax"
And again, we're not arguing "what if Lowtax didn't make SA" because he objectively *did* and those objectively caused 4Chan and KF and ED to exist.
It's like Gavrilo Princip. WWI would have probably happened eventually but he absolutely set the dominoes in motion.
IUt'
"4chan exists because Lowtax..." is still because of Lowtax.
Yeah, exactly.
I'm not saying it wouldn't have happened, I'm saying I don't think it would have happened to this extent.
I think it provided a platform that enable a lot of these people to group together when if SA hadn't existed would have been infinitely harder to corrdinate.
It's not traditional social media.
KiwiFarms, Encyclopedia Dramatica, and Something Awful are all a *very* specific kind of site, Ghostra.
We may have eventually gotten similar stuff but I don't think it would have become anywhere near as popular without SA
A lot of the users were Goons tho
Stuff like KF and ED were directly related to SA
Has anyone done more long-term damage to the internet than fucking Lowtax
They probably don't want to get in trouble for hosting doxing info.
I was going to say

Oh yeah. I actually forgot about that
I feel like this whole situation benefits the US and Ukraine a lot more than Russia.
But with winter coming it would ratchet up the pressure for countries like Germany to come crawling back to Russia.
What do they stand to gain from destroying one of the only things that keeps European countries reliant on them? What do they stand to gain from reducing one of the few sources of leverage they had?

Why would Russia do it so far away?
That‚Äôs more of a foundational oversight than anything, I feel.
People are acting like this privilege is Russia-specific, but all the permanent members have veto privileges, right? I feel like there aren‚Äôt any permanent states that wouldn‚Äôt veto a resolution condemning themselves.
What would that accomplish if Russia wouldn‚Äôt acknowledge the condemnation in the first place? They‚Äôre too stupid or stubborn to budge.

But supporting RWBY directly supports the execs

Less forgive, more absolve I guess.
You‚Äôll notice I didn‚Äôt say that anywhere.

I don‚Äôt disagree with Fenny‚Äôs take on their pay. I disagree with her take on the slurs.
Because the only two qualifications you gave were ‚Äúwas a long time ago‚Äù and ‚Äúhas their behavior changed‚Äù
We‚Äôre not talking about their shitty pay. We‚Äôre talking about slurs.
Do you think that makes it okay.
They stopped calling her that when she came out as trans. So their behavior is not the same.
2013 was ten years ago. Does that mean them calling her ‚Äúf*ggot‚Äù is aight?

Like if they couldn't afford to feed themselves or their children
Like if someone was shoplifting, in legal terms it's basically 100% a crime. But strictly legal terms don't take into consideration like, why someone is shoplifting
There's a lot of times when some is "innocent, *but...*" or "guilty, *but...*" if that makes sense.
People think of guilty and innocent as a binary whereas real life is almost never that simple, basically.
I'm not sure I think that there should be a phrase for that kind of thing. Haven't given it that much thought.
"Innocent until proven guilty" and "guilty until proven innocent" are both black and white terms used to refer to situations that are almost never black and white.
I feel like they're reductionist.
If contrary evidence comes out then sure, reevaluate the situation. But if someone, a man or woman, says ‚ÄúI am in a very dangerous situation where I am being abused‚Äù you don‚Äôt really have the time to ‚Äúsit and wait to see what the other side has to say‚Äù.
When it comes to serious situations like abuse I think believing them until we have information otherwise is safer.
There was a guy who did as well IIRC

It‚Äôs hard to just take people at their word for that sort of thing
I can see it being genuine in retrospect after they‚Äôve proven it, but that still requires time yeah
If it‚Äôs genuine, yeah.
In this special instance with Kdin it‚Äôs fine because yes, she was previously held accountable.
I‚Äôm speaking generally
I‚Äôm saying that I don‚Äôt think those reasons are good enough if there‚Äôs no accountability, not that there was no accountability in the instance with Kdin
Again, my issue was with Fenny saying that ‚Äúbecause it was a long time ago‚Äù and ‚Äúbecause her behavior gas changed‚Äù were good enough. Not that she wasn‚Äôt held accountable.
Fair enough, I guess?
I‚Äôm not even going to bother with responding if this is the level of faith I‚Äôm dealing with here.
lol
Was it though?
We should hold her accountable.
It won‚Äôt!
People who abuse service workers suck ass.

I can see an article 4 but not an article 5. The only article 5 I know of was 9/11 and that was a significantly more far-reaching event.
A meeting for considering considerations is peak bureaucracy.
Like a formal meeting
Article 4 is just raising concerns, right?
if you say so
their games can't be that good
i genuinely don't know how you can stan for bethesda after reading mick's article
weren't you literally the one who mentioned the NDA
i assume the claims are true because he backed them up
>mountains of evidence
its a direct endorsement
that kind of negates the whole "private account" argument
then why did bethesda bring it back
either it's okay to air out in public or it isn't
they can't have it both ways
then why did they make and keep up the reddit post that mick was directly responding to?
"encourage" and "urge" are literally active
if you say so, man
its an awful look
not to mention bethesda just straight up doesn't even pretend to address the mountains of evidence levied against them

uhuh
and the use of "incite" here seems deliberate regardless pf whether it's "passive voice" or not
that's not his fault, as bethesda was implying
there would have been people regardless of how he broached the subject
doesn't incite specifically imply encouragement
they claim he "incited harassment" when he literally said not to harass people because it wasn't the devs faults
yep
bethesda released an embarrassing response to it recently
yeh
Fuck the feds

also i just saw this in the replies, lol
this wasn't some guy promising to make his buddy music for his indie game. this was literally one of the biggest companies in the industry who he had previously worked with before
especially if i had literally worked with them before
if they're a multibillion dollar company, yes, i'd expect they wouldn't stiff me
but "you should know not to be working until you actually have a contract for it" seems kind shitty
maybe im reading the tone wrong
"you should have known better"
isn't this literally victim blaming
üò¨
right?
but that has nothing to do with the allegations of him being stiffed money
even though that could be under NDA, which you are very willing to give Bethesda the benefit of the doubt on
you're saying that mick isn't presenting enough evidence to be believed enitrely, correct?
this is what i mean when i say you're either being deliberately obtuse or just not reading what i'm saying
c'mon man
that's not the implication at all, lmao
you even used quotes, which is quite literally putting words in my mouth
if you see "if it was fallaciously incorrect" and assume i mean "everyone involved is evil" then yes
i'd appreciate it if you didn't keep trying to put words in my mouth
not too thrilled about it regardless
listen man either you're not actually reading what I'm writing or you're just purposefully misrepresenting what I'm saying
again, tacit endorsement
you are aware that if it was fallaciously incorrect that they could have asked marty, as a representative of the company, to take it down, correct?
never said they controlled it, lol
literally nowhere did i say they owned it
not that they own the subreddit
*i'm saying that it is a public forum for their company where a high-level employee posted*
bethesda would not have allegedly offered six figures in hush money if they knew he was in the wrong
but they didn't
one of the heads of a studio made very serious allegations towards a collaborator on a public forum directly linked to bethesda and they allowed it to stay. the person in question responded and *only then* did they say something. if they didn't approve of marty's post they would have addressed it
that's damning as hell
they didn't address it when the news broke, only after mick responded
bethesda's lack of action in leaving marty's post up is tacit approval
what course of action would you have taken
do you just expect mick to not respond at all?
c'mon
marty already broke NDA dude
if mick's evidence isn't worth anything, bethesda's position is worth less than nothing
i just find it a bit meh to claim you're being impartial when you've been going to bat for bethesda despite them having put even *less* evidence forward
i'd consider it quite a bit
As long as the topic is open for discussion I don't see why it wouldn't be allowed here.

I‚Äôm just not sure the *chance* of that is reasonable justification for the *certainty* of the shoplifter dying of starvation makes it a net negative.
She‚Äôs basically saying ‚Äúif the employees suffer paycuts or are fired because of shoplifting then that could mean they‚Äôd eventually starve as well‚Äù, unless I‚Äôm misunderstanding.
This is my train of thought as well, but I get where she‚Äôs coming from.

Jesus H Christ I thought Das said ‚ÄúMelussy‚Äù at first and was about to kill him with a rock
Autocorrect why

I think Melua is arguing that if it harms the employees because of corpo backlash it can‚Äôt be a net good.
Fair enough. I‚Äôm not sure I fully agree, but I think we‚Äôre taking two different routes to a similar conclusion, so I‚Äôd imagine we agree more than we don‚Äôt.
I don‚Äôt consider that the shoplifter‚Äôs fault, same as how I don‚Äôt consider raising minimum wage to be bad just because companies will use it as justification to vindictively raise their prices.
It benefits the starving human being shoptifting more than it harms the billion dollar corporation they‚Äôre shoplifting from. It is a net good.
Consider not talking
I thought you were saying it *was* bad

Unless you mean for public transport in which yes, it would absolutely be easier to do rail
I meant more in the areas where you‚Äôd need the rails, like warehouses and factories and stuff.
A lot of railroads now have been paved over and used for other things
Yes, but one can be added to existing land whereas the other will need to purchase new land, clear existing sites, and build rails. We just don‚Äôt have a ton of space for rails because we tore them all up and built shit where they were.
The roads, not the wires.
I want railroads but I‚Äôm also a foamer so I‚Äôm biased.

No, it should

You could put pantographs on the major roadways and use the internal battery to do the smaller roads so you don‚Äôt need to literally wire every road, I guess.
So it‚Äôs cheap*er* but you may as well just spend the extra money for the railway.
I think Mel means that pantograph‚Äôd trucks would work with existing infrastructure, whereas because the US tore up all the railways you‚Äôd need to to have land to build them.

I got COVID three times because I‚Äôm a dumbass but I‚Äôm good now
If this is something you feel is affecting your life in a hugely negative way, as it appears to be doing, you should talk to your doctor. This isn‚Äôt healthy, and even if they can‚Äôt offer you any physical solutions they may be able to direct you to someone who can help you address your phobia or at least manage anxiety, if that's what it is.
You can‚Äôt live the rest of your life in constant unrelenting fear of COVID. Many people have told you many times that as long as you‚Äôre careful there‚Äôs nothing to worry about, and even if you *did* get it you‚Äôd be sick for a week and then better. You‚Äôve got to stop this. All you‚Äôre doing is making yourself miserable over something that isn‚Äôt even all that worth worrying about.

IMO the bigger issue is that this is absolutely not a scenario where you should call the police.
It's definitely shitty, but it looks like it wasn‚Äôt an actual trained service animal and there is a case to be had that it was a public health risk.
I was referring to this.

Why are they clumped up like that
What the fuck is that spacing
Exactly.
Would you arrest someone for letting their dog shit on your lawn and not cleaning it up?
It's a victimless crime.
Who is being harmed here?
Or are we just arresting her on the principle of the matter?
You‚Äôre refusing to answer the question, also. What or who is she harming by staying on the train to the point that it warrants a response from police?
It kind of does, man.
Hell, she cleaned up the shit herself.
And that‚Äôs that
And you clean up the shit
Then she gets off at her stop, and leaves.
Worst case her dog shits again.
What or who is she harming enough by staying on the train to warrant a response from cops?
Cops should be a last resort because they almost always escalate the situation.
What threat does she pose?
Even if she refused to leave and just sat there, what warrants a cop response?
Not call the cops on a woman whose dog took a shit on the train?
That‚Äôs worth calling cops for in your book?
What‚Äôs a 80 year old woman going to do to warrant a response from cops, lol
Yeah, that's why I said it was sus. They basically cut out the middleman and went straight to ‚Äúcops‚Äù.
The law is basically an excuse.
I gotcha.
Oh, you mean the enforcement of it.
Do you think they don‚Äôt know her race?
They are literally looking at the woman.
Are aboriginal people more likely to be publicly drunk or something
I genuinely can‚Äôt tell if this is a bit or not.
Looking at her
Because they were there
Once they showed up on the scene they knew her race.
Are you stupid?
The evidence is that in the video the police are on the premises looking at the black woman.
Is this a bit?
???
They were literally looking at her when they kicked her off, man.
Do you think they couldn‚Äôt tell the woman was black? lol
They have eyes?
Oh, you just meant once they were on the premise, not when deciding to respond to the call.
I‚Äôm not saying that couldn‚Äôt be the case, it just seems like an arbitrary inference.
Yeah, it's a shame it panned out like this in general.
Because now you have to bring in past legal precedent and shit.
This is where it gets off into the legal weeds, buh
Although if they allowed ESAs, I‚Äôm not sure why the same animal policies wouldn‚Äôt apply in this case.
Interesting.
I just can‚Äôt find any studies on it.
Although their owners did love them, so there‚Äôs a case to be made.
I obviously haven‚Äôt owned one, but I‚Äôve known numerous people who have had iguanas and snakes and stuff and basically all they do is sit in one place and flick their tongues.
Yes, but iguanas aren‚Äôt social like dogs and cats, which is where I‚Äôd imagine most of the emotional support comes from.
Are there any studied medical benefits to iguanas like there are dogs and cats?
My uncle had several and those things are Feces City‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.
Have you ever seen an iguana? They piss and shit everywhere, lol
If you refused to read it then there‚Äôs nothing I can do.
I‚Äôve told you what I think should have happened multiple times.
??
Yes, but the response to someone refusing to leave is not calling the cops.
Then forbid it from being brought in the future. How does a first time offense warrant cops?
The only thing that delayed the train was them stopping it to sic the cops on an old lady.
Then they should suck it up and accept that this will happen sometimes.
But they weren‚Äôt.
It wasn‚Äôt forbidden, though. If they don‚Äôt accept the risks associated with animals then they should be banned entirely.
How is she harming the company?
You could let it poop before going on the train, but what if it poops again?
If a dog decides to poop, it poops. There's not ‚Äútaking precautions to stop it.‚Äù
Basically.
Housebroken means not shitting indoors.
How do you force a dog to stop pooping, in *any* scenario?
It was out of line
<@276723234295250964> I apologize for asking if you were stupid earlier, by the way. I didn‚Äôt realize we were talking about two separate things.
He could just answer it tbf.
Is breaking the terms of service on social media enough to warrant a police response? You‚Äôre breaking the company policy. What if you keep creating accounts?
theyve been trying to make it more like insta and tiktok for a while now
i love the twitter format but i hate the company
truth social is a pretty good idea
i hate that to a point he‚Äôs not even wrong
According to the article it lasted ten years, somehow.
They don‚Äôt really care about making it kid safe, let‚Äôs be honest. They allow all sorts of horrible children‚Äôs content farm shit to go on YouTube Kids with little to no moderation. What they really care about is making it as sanitized as humanly possible to not scare away advertisers.
It was explicitly stated to be an ESA.
Nobody was trying to pass them off as a trained service animal.
Them kicking her off the train isn‚Äôt what people are upset about. They‚Äôre upset about the cops being called for a situation that didn‚Äôt warrant it.

$11 speech doesnt sound as good
it just seems weird to post beef between two very small Twitter accounts who can‚Äôt even scrape together 30K followers and 2K likes on a tweet between them, neither of whom anyone here has ever had any interaction with
i have literally never heard of either of these people in my life
of publicly and privately funded, I mean
so its kind of a hybrid?
to the genera public
where it was government developed before being made available
Probably the commie thing
The Dems are just diet Republicans. I don‚Äôt doubt the ones who voted yes think it‚Äôs a good idea.
‚Äúyup guys, china exists. pack it up‚Äù
what are they investigating
for an example, pug, think of how many people made ‚Äúhaha Chinese people eat weird animals‚Äù jokes after covid. that has nothing to do with government or their response to COVID. thats just straight up racism
yeah this definitely is a problem
thanks for elaborating
oh, okay
but there are a ton of Chinese emigrants as well
genuine question, Mel. whats the difference between drawing parallels between criticizing the israeli government and jews as a whole and China and Chinese people as a whole?
how is that legal
i meant more browsers, video hosting, and search engines, among several other things

reactionary American conservatives are genuinely some of the dumbest pearl clutching losers on planet earth
Purging all religious institutions with a well-documented history of systemic child abuse covered up at the administrative level? Sounds good to me.
‚Äúi‚Äôm sickos‚Äù

Having money to throw at your hobbies and stuff you like is very very nice
BUT
I‚Äôm not going to lie, working largely sucks and occupies a massive amount of your life
Working you mean?
watch it in ten minute increments over the course of 20 days
Ah, YouTuber
Who is that
Most well built Tesla
They talked about racing a lot?
They've changed their name a ton but they‚Äôve been active here for years
<:why:820460077948600362>
Can‚Äôt check back because you got a new account though
This is before they came out as trans.
It's Speed? They‚Äôve been here for years and have talked to you a ton?
‚ÄúApex universe‚Äù is so fucking depressing
I don‚Äôt think either of those things are true.

Trump absolutely destroying his desperate simps is so fucking funny

<:ballsack1:1048064502710681660>
nooo
dont cry
wait
and stopped
and i apologized
this is all a lot of waffling just to avoid admitting you missed obvious sarcasm
and id like to point out that ‚Äúhow can the country that invented pulled pork sandwiches be bad‚Äù is very clearly sarcasm even if i hadn‚Äôt been vocally critical of them numerous times in the past
ive been very open about my dislike for the us many, many times in this very channel
skill issue
in all seriousness though i could believe it either way. China and the US have been itching for something to beef about for a good while now
so
megan i have very clearly been sarcastic this whole time lol
how can the country that invented pulled pork sandwiches be bad
never done anything wrong ever
the usa is the best
im watching you tho mr. Pants
my bad
<:why:820460077948600362>
sad!
only saying that because you were called out
mr. lankpants what happened in tiananmen
why do you hate the uyghurs lank
sounds like something a tankie would say but ok
ok tankie
Why did you have that on your 2023 list
You think that they would at least wait until they‚Äôre above a C-tier celebrity to let the fame get to their head, but nooo

The NLRB, last I heard, classifies grad students as employees.
Bursar getting fired
The funniest part is that this is straight up illegal. They literally admit to it being retaliatory in the email. Someone's labor lawyers are going to have a field day with this, lol

acting like she has no tangible influence just because she‚Äôs not in a government job is willful ignorance
not to mention she funds and promotes vehemently anti-trans organizations
what
rakhi is 8 years old confirmed
i‚Äôm sorry but this is absolutely hilarious
then they realized and changed the password
was a wild three days
reminds me of the time the school's wifi password leaked in high school
so its more about properly crediting?
i‚Äôm not arguing ai art is okay for the record
i was just hoping to get some clarification on the distinction
but then why would ai art without profit also not be okay?
oh
but photoshop isn‚Äôt trained on content is it?
gpt/art/audio/deepfakes/etc
i‚Äôm not sure how i feel about ai anything to be honest
just social media as a whole seems way more okay with it for some reason
this isn‚Äôt a callout of anyone here for the record
is there a fundamental difference im unaware of that makes it more ethical?
weren‚Äôt they also trained without creators consent?
not to come across as pedantic, but why are so many people who i‚Äôve seen openly express contempt for ai art be perfectly okay with deepfakes and ai voice generation?
New woke order
Google is woke
lol

oh
live service?
they went from nothing to being one of my favorite devs to being dead in like 4 years
the brightest flames burn the fastest

that was the same team lol
actiblizz funded a company to make the best crash bandicoot game in twenty years and then immediately doomed them to the cod mines
jokes on them i can‚Äôt afford microtransactions

i am coming to confiscate your foreskin
im sorry das using the ^ in serious is strictly prohibited
i will take remakes of good games over live service games
gamers vehemently defend capitalism but then get mad when the capitalists capitalize
‚Äúyou‚Äôre telling me i can buy this cosmetic outright with no lootboxes or battlepasses or premium in game currency for only $4? what a steal‚Äù
not even that, remember the horse armor uproar? people would kill for small dlc that you bought once for like $4 now lol
that, etrian odyssey, and grimrock are the big ones i always see brought up at least
as popular as you can be in something as niche as dungeon crawlers
l
wel
plenty of people know about labyrinth of galleria. its the sequel to a fairly popular dungeon crawler
<@331908049822547978> say you‚Äôre prayers buster
my first order of business will be to ban das
i will pay melua $8 a month to be a mod

literally lol
they‚Äôve been doing that for years
that‚Äôs just nitro
lol
so it‚Äôd be fine generally as long as you weren‚Äôt saying like ‚Äúim a professional voice actor btw heres my recording of trump saying the navy seals copypasta‚Äù
i think i get what you‚Äôre saying
so you‚Äôre basically saying that deepfakes are fundamentally no different than photoshopping a meme of a celebrity or that kind of thing basically
time to buy you a bunch of horror games
duopath traveller
you can already get forspoken for like $30 on console lol
they‚Äôre so overblown it‚Äôs not even funny
ironically final fantasy would be better if they spent *less* on it
square enix
most of my favorite games are AA
honestly i wouldn‚Äôt be super crushed if aaa games scaled their scope back a lot
shorter games, worse graphics, paid more, work less, etc
is the NGAD more like the Abrams-X where its a large evolution of an existing platform or is it like the DLP arm of the NGCV program where its a full replacement?
oh it is?
no i mean we haven‚Äôt heard much about future plans for it
even though they claimed it never went anywhere
but that never went anywhere, did it? and its not like the smart bullets where *totally coincidentally* after the project we starting breaking distance records with .50 right?
rather than the current style of UAV
like the kizilelma
like in a conventional form factor
does the us have any known testing of unmanned traditional attack aircraft?
most people that are ‚Äúpro-russia‚Äù are really just ‚Äúanti-US‚Äù and russia is a means to an end of getting rid of them or weakening them
sf/f?
Why?
Paywall. TL;DR?
bungling?
bogging is the wrong word but i can‚Äôt think of the one i mean
yeah, itll be really interesting to see how the next couple decades shake out. a lot of current and formal world powers are bogging things up and the rising potential world powers are snapping up the space left behind
toootally a coincidence lol
yeah, that‚Äôs what i was referring to
damn brits sticking their fingers in everyones business
forcing your culture on them
so its not seen as like
ohhh
yeah i didn‚Äôt mean to imply everyone spoke it, just that you said it was common for people to use both as a bridge
but then why english? the british were even more imperialist than trying to make hindu an official language right? or is it because its external that theyre not as angry about the idea?
im not going to lie, thats actually pretty funny that the unifying language is from an entirely different country instead of the official state language
so is english kind of a regional lingua franca there or something?
oh?
official federally i mean
also why is one of your official languages english if its not prevalent in the states? just a relic of british imperialism?
i know there‚Äôs like 20 official languages or something ridiculous
with the most amount of speakers
like most spoken by population
what are the top languages there?
lol
im not familiar with india outside of what a few indian friends have told me
i know corruption is pretty bad there so i wasn‚Äôt sure how that would affect local government
or is there even less federal oversight?
so indian states are kind of like some us states in terms of wanting to be self-governing?
i hope they lose now

My favorite animated Disney movies are ones nobody talks or cares about so I‚Äôm used to disappointment.
She annoyed the hell out of me. i can‚Äôt possibly imagine having to sit through an entire film about her.
I thought Dory was the absolute worst part of Finding Nemo so i didn‚Äôt even touch the sequel.
Fun fact: the reason Cars is such a huge franchise for Disney is solely because the toy line sells absolutely fucking insane numbers.
Damn who's that guy and why is he right
<a:pensivewobble:820461775954247712>
Enlighten me
point to me where I said the words "objective fact"
