Thanks, I'm sure I will tbh
working on it
I can't answer I havent watched the final season yet oops
Heyo <:MFwave:670300882088230922>
Double welcome in under an hour, welcome
Hey, welcome
so you'd be happy to answer
i think if you join a furry gang you probably have a strong opinion about that question
its a normal question for a fan to be asked i'd say
I think its cool of you to ask something out of the newcomers to integrate them
<a:KirikaBear:493835576659935232>
she's cool, especially the bear costume
Hello, welcome
That is a good idea, I will look into it
I don't want to end it, it's fun to watch along 😔
Yeah as expected. Looks hard to get into. Thanks for the info though
Does that mean a sort of english patch or is it an external translation?
I did take a look at the characters though
I tried understanding XDU but I could only find japanese information and it seemed a bit hard to access
Im halfway through the 4th (AGX i think but the names dont stick with me), mostly because I've had no time to finish it
thanks for the heads-up, although its funny seeing everyone mention characters you've never seen, like when I kept seeing Adam gifs or images
Welcome
Greetings
who welcomes the one who welcomes everyone?
I cant welcome Das, that's unnatural
The ichaival is reaaaal
Thanks folks
anyway thanks
If you didn't notice then did I really leave?
Thanks
Welcome welcome
Cant believe we got Iceland itself to join us
Das you missed the previous 2 smh
Welcome
the third evan wow
Welcome
Welcome
I follow up with the <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993> (when im not asleep)
you pass the welcomer test
that's true i didn't notice
how will i feel welcomed if das doesn't ask me my favourite characters
you put the cute fox emoji but you don't say "Welcome!" smh
Holy shit Carol
Welcome
welcome <a:wavehands:855272119126196244>
oh we hadnt had a new person in a couple days
Playing ff14 for 7 hours whew, welcome
consumption of alcohol...
😭😭
got me acting strange
whew
the whole black sea access coastline is massively important
but you're correct their minority groups arent distinct enough
the crimeans would secede? they're already not russian, at least not in terms of official nationality
definitely targeted at some countries more
this is good
same way musk did
pretty much
it's not enough for there to be dozens of scam projects that steal hundreds of thousands of dollars from naive people, you also gotta make it racist
this was the saddest thing I've seen today
Portugal
we have mostly the same debates here
and thats the other one lol
thats a hot topic in every european country right now
all of europe will definitely be watching
when are the elections exactly?
Thats enlightening
Rome itself
either the first or the second week
It was in the first week of August iirc
I was in italy this summer and when talking to taxi drivers, more  than once of them said Meloni would probably not win
Guess not everyone agrees
I see, was just asking honestly
do you consider it better than not voting at all?
sadly lots of us are in that same situation all around
they cancelled some silly things
the saddest one is just protecting her sons, which i totally get
there are various threads on this if you're curious
just because she has no official power doesn't mean she can't pull a couple strings
mostly environmental laws not being applied to her
to protect her heritage
although she herself did stuff like silently alter laws that were passed
its more stuff the British empire did in general
she did a lot of bad but its nothing special only she did
i have committed a racism
oops
did you see the entire Irish football court singing and clapping "if you hate the royal family clap your hands"?
my favourite was on day 1, irish tiktoks dancing and singing "Lizzie's in a box"
based, i appreciate it (also right after my birthday)
quite sad, innit
yeah little brainwashed people, quite sad
they did make a long ass queue for it, lots of people did
the difference is they wouldn't do it for us, as expected
it's just boot licking
the difference is they wouldn't do it for us
Portugal has this 800 yo treaty of friendship with the UK
crazy
my country passed a 3 day mourning period for the queen of another country
I know people here who are doing the same which is crazy
is it a reference to coming back as a lich?
maybe but that's just conjecture now
yeah maybe in the last 30 years not so much but in the 50s and 60s, they definitely were
especially earlier on during the reign I'm almost sure she'd be interested in the future of the decaying british empire
just because the parliament is the official ruler doesn't mean they don't know or accept / condone its decisions
she was younger and more involved back then though, that's a factor
these days even the more indifferent ones are acting so patriotic
not a lot of brits with that view
did you mention you're British nevis?
(unless you're irish then i get it)
the partying is mostly a defiant act imo
the people who disliked her already did and the people who liked her will still like her so not much changed anyway
hey you can still point your finger even if it not the literal worst person
idk this one's just funny
https://twitter.com/Themightyhutch/status/1568934508178690048?t=-v3TZQ-h-SNx0GBD07-NwA&s=19 it was this actually
and they closed this one bike rack
some place extremely far fron london too
the funniest one was a bike rack in uhhh norfolk? was closed
this is true but remember she was ruling since the 40s,she didn't just inherit the bad, she participated in it
like football games
because parties like that would never win popular support without massive funding and disinformation
TLDR yes
im guessing his overton window is pushed to the right quite a bit
should have used "far right", would like to see them denying that one
how can someone say that with a serious face
"fascism getting funding doesn't lead to the rise of fascism" that's what they're saying
those like/dislike ratios are insane
very powerful
they reached triple that
miserable
when there's active fighting in the area
who's gonna trust this random referendum that's gonna happen in less than a week
you dont even need history just common sense
regardless if it was the true opinion of the people
completely pointless referendum neither side will accept if they lose
dont know anything about that situation but if thats correct thats so cringe
very unfortunate, hope you guys get through without catching it
hey that doesnt count as weapons or ammunition
Frick
a self-        child
😔
whore penis
90% of the time that is with religious reasoning
lots of scams use the appeal to religion its really easy to catch gullible religious people online
i feel bad for chileans they really had to choose between budget trump and the political equivalent of plain bread
and venezuela but everyone knows that one
thats why he keeps shitting on nicaragua
he is licking the boots of UOA to be let in
thats great lmao
what is up my guys, welcome to another episode of the cia podcast
he's quite unpopular now
and he will probably lose next time
his constitution idea failed miserably
he's the stereotypical 30-40 center-right-socially-progressive-bitcoin guy
crypto lib
he's not a leftist lol
with the union jack in every piece of clothing
every brit is either like that or extremely nationalistic
high fevers during the day and night, coughing for over a week
my family was like that too
unfortunate
I was so lucky with covid, got it from my parents but it only lasted 3 days, I only had a mild fever and a bit of cough, and it disappeared the day before a final exam
I just realized I dont actually know exactly: who is Devin?
would this be the first time in your family?
and its normally just a stab at "less-anarchist" communism
it wasnt even that succesful
I hate how the Paris commune became the literal only example that present-day anarchists bring up
do not underestimate the ideology soup of the internet
Oh i know its a joke but not for everyone
do not ask
there is a subreddit for monarcho-socialism
it has
socialism is when the government does stuff, and the more stuff it does, the more socialist it is
communism is when the government does ALL the stuff
Lol so many people cannot even describe communism, dont ask too much
ahah you guys seem to be in good hands then
let me guess your other party is just Aussie Tories
the Democrats special
ah the typical 2022 "Labour"
i guess Starmer's and Corbyn's Labours are quite different but well
is your labour ideologically similar to the UK's Labour?
that never works out well
Oh australia is federated im assuming
its not 1 person 1 vote?
Its called Senate there too?
at least my vote matters a bit
yeah i definitely dont envy any americans/brits/australians
and then we have the classical parties, the communists, the neolibs proper, the extreme right
and the second biggest party is centre left, but kind of umbrella for the right
we have a majority in our extremely-center-neolib party which is comically called "socialist party"
Portugal
neolib and neolib but a bit more left
i guess those were our choices in the last election too
well those are a dime a dozen these days
ew neokeynes
and i severely doubt it
all I know about that place is they call one of those a communist
ah thats australia right?
the only thing he did was try to change the constitution (which is good) and fail miserably
Sorry to hear that man, hopefully it was peaceful at least
i love this topic but im not very well versed in the american reality
it was a good read
Didnt expect such a high quality debate to come out of this topic lol
67% yes
it was quite the progressive change
with the exception of greece
especially as you go east
yeah that is common throughout europe these days
still they're close enough to shut up anything they want from the left
thats true so its not quite an absolute majority
absolute majority
what a steamroll
watch them post one piece can we get much higher memes next
ok maybe not *that* knowledgeable
would be cool, but no, probably just someone who knows trends
politicians rarely run their accounts
its still probably run by a manager
even if the characters were communists they'd probably take the publicity
it generates insane attention
do you think its her running the account?
its a very good place to be rich in, especially if your money comes from very suspicious sources as cons or scams
does he live in russia now?
im glad I know nothing about movies or movie making
uh
wth does this mean
what the hell does "government backed family law code" even mean, the law on family is always government backed
what would you expect its AP reporting on Cuba
does it? I've seen it covered extensively since yesterday
people over 2 years old eat a lot more meat than those under 2 years of age, time to strike them
if anything the smaller the place the easier voting is
to not go for universal voting
its weird for a "nation" thats pretty much just a city
all i know is they have the publicly owned land system
idk enough about singapore to comment
around half the document was changed after being originally written
its not just voted by the people, it was written by them
because it was proposed way back then and then addended hundreds of times in hundreds of different local meetings
its even better than majority vs minority in this case
the argument is that cuba is a one party state and since its a government-backed referendum, its mandatory
goes without saying the definition of democracy hasnt been this debated in a while
and by saying the US media you extend it to europe because its been the topic of talk for the past 2 days
lots of involvement
idk if you guys read on the process of the approval but it was really intricate
the government-backed family law code
holy shit we found it
cost him his team's spot on the tournament
yeah he is the CEO of G2 esports
Hustlers uni got shut down 😔
(its stolen passports)
he says he runs a "camgirl" business but he forgets to explain how the girls end up there
since he's involved in sexual trafficking schemes in eastern europe
he said it himself
he moved to romania because they wouldnt investigate him for rape and sexual trafficking accusations
for usage of lgbt themes without actual substance
if you want you can use pinkwashing
considering we were literally warned of it lol
its quite likely
"but you don't actually need the mask, you're just reducing your lifespan by 40 years by living without it, it's your personal choice"
renting a gas mask that's needed to live will DEFINITELY help the economy
if only air was easier to control too... that would be great for the economy...
at least food and water can't physically be rented or we'd be fucked
it's one of those things that came from the feudal times, with property being a divine right and tied to power
society evolved to understand that food and water are obvious necessities but didn't go far enough to secure the housing
that estate groups that own 2 million houses don't feel the effect of inflation
who would be able to guess
now the blame game will start
but considering there are suspicions it could be  inside-Nato sabotage, its tricky
that pipe in specific was mostly empty so it doesn't change much
considering who is suspected of doing it
Quest but the NPC died to mobs
its part of his role
you could fill a library with all the shit he's said
im not quite straight though
Im a minority here <:AiPensive:742428759088562311>
are you lgbt sapphire?
Half the US is it seems
Tennessee
so you could overlay that over the rainbow flag
lots of emojis on Unicode are meant to overlay over others
it was just a Unicode abuse
yeah the 🚫
that was on twitter screenshots a while back
you mean that one with the No over the rainbow
you mean an official one
literally the collapse of civilization
you are a threat to the western world im so sorry 😔
the fucking balls to write a letter to twitter and add it to your statement
because they're massive
Ahaha took a while
i was wondering how this leads to antisemitism
Ohhh
the 2 different reactions
<:xd:717329803098980403>
seeing the point of the campaign was to smear him
doubt its real
they would definitely be crossing what is pretty much enemy waters right now
its not quite off the coast of kaliningrad
the leaks happened close to germany/denmark iirc
considering how high alert the world is to their actions
and its also harder for them do physically do it
it makes less sense for russia itself to do it
to me it makes some sense
matt is literally wishing death to europe
whose subs would more easily get there too
is that impossible?
it made our headlines sure but the pressure is still on them
it sowed chaos for themselves
makes sense
but the idea of hurting their biggest leverage against europe
well you cant be asking anyone for the actual reason because thats definitely a military secret worth millions right now
both Biden and Mike Pompeo i think
if war broke out
we also got biden saying they WOULD stop the pipeline back in february
Gonna have to share matt's skepticism here
and lots of higher ups there probably agree anyway lol
they can say "we dont condone violence" and wash their hands of everything
the reason is it generates a lot of movement and clicks and they dont really care about the content
i love this sentence
“Overemployment” sounds like more of the same old grind, but its underlying philosophy is critical of work.
about being tired
that means you dont gotta think
big drive
Unicode is all for Big Car
only childish insults
Fortunately I dont have to hear death threats though
i dont wanna speak out of turn but not every woman sees those rights as necessary it seems
not just indonesia
oh you mean MTG in the usa too?
what a zero to hero moment
wholesome winning story
i think the best take was the little news piece going like "when she was 15, she tried to join the Italian Youth, but the men there rejected her. 30 years later, she's prime minister"
she could have just, not commented, like many others did
that aint it chief
there was the italian woman saying that not supporting her is a blow against feminism
after sankara it has been like that pretty much
absolutely nothing changes
military guy overthrows military guy who overthrew the president who was probably put there by the military
impossible
african nations try to have peace for 3 minutes challenge
lucky us it was just some minor sabotaging on pipes that werent currently carrying much
in 30 years we'll all be in our nuclear winter bunkers reminiscing "remember that time they sabotaged the pipeline and we never found out who it was?"
then again they'd do that regardless, nothing to lose on that
i think russia blamed NATO but i dont have a source
it will probably remain a mystery for a while
dont know what the official stance is
Saw poland and ukraine blaming russia
didnt see anything on that
that depends, some countries do
who do you mean by we in this case?
dont think american weapon manufacturers would mind selling to russian PMCs if they paid
but tbh they will sell it to whoever buys it
but nato's is bigger, so slight edge there
that is also true
which is in nato's interests
its also weakening russia's only trump card
justifying the war even more
its escalation of the conflict in general, which fans the fire more
raytheon is filling their pockets rn
military contracts are pure gold
to ukraine?
selling weapons lol
not saying russia doesnt too
nato definitely doesnt mind escalating it
this is one of those things that will get leaked/declassified in 10 years and we'll all go "oh lol that happened"
well it definitely is
that could have many explanations, it could even be a smokescreen to use as an excuse, "it was too far away"
international waters or not, that is definitely closer to nato controlled area than to their own
the referendum was obviously considered null but its not like we can stop him from moving troops there, since he already controls those places
thats why provocations without much actual value need to be kept to a minimum
most of us dont
I myself dont wanna get there to test your prediction
moves like that are dangerous
the more isolated they get the more dangerous they are though
not the country you'd expect to take a stance
Gabon abstaining is interesting
just like in a discussion you can technically defend yourself even if everyone knows its your fault
i think the only country to be kicked out of the UN was taiwan
noted to not react to XV myself
recognizing it is half the way
good luck man, self improvement is hard
and you might change a normal person's mind, but you wont ever change the grifter's
sadly i think those are mostly the bottom-middle tier conservatives
because the ones who feed them the ideas are almost always just grifters
"it doesnt affect me so ill say this and get paid a lot"
we also cant forget many are just pure grifters
because the message applies to the whole group, in this case women
it wouldnt really work if you just pushed yourself
lots of people think their place, or their group's place, is at the bottom or at least below someone else's
and/or proud
the result wasnt just decided by his veto either
then if a serious referendum could be held that would be amazing but that wont happen
as soon as they're kicked out the territories will be restabilished
doesn't help that so many of them get proven as scams instantly
it can't grow much anymore
they've been dunked so hard that everyone that isn't into them just dislikes it
and searches for NFTs too
yeah Eth has pretty much been declining for this whole year
"yeah I burned this Dali painting but I was only gonna keep 50% of the profits lol"
like that doesn't fix anything my guy
the best part is his defense that he was gonna donate *some* of it to charity
it was my mistake to entertain anything else forget it
i told you I'm not going to spend time exchanging arguments with someone with a strong opinion, that's the first rule of Internet discussions lol
i would appreciate if you didn't assume that just because i dont agree with tou at 100% im "being mislead" like im reading breitbart daily or watching tucker carlson
debating the reasons and how much blame each side has ultimately has nothing to do with who you side with, at least as i see it
it's not about listing the one reason, like there could be ever be just 1 simple reason
those are not the nuances im talking about
it's not like i wanted to change your mind or anything but there won't be any point
saying this might make you think i completely disagree with you (i dont) but you obviously have an extremely ingrained opinion on this so any talk is probably pointless
you can and should
even if i went i would read it tomorrow
lots of interesting topics to be discussed here
aw man if it wasn't 3.30am <:dead:940813190248411147>
but there is always more nuance than that, you cant just ignore the reason that let the Eastern territories to even be sympathetic of russia in the first place
Obviously agreed with who started it
you cant be that black and white
pointing the finger at a different cause does not mean you side with russia
he said it himself
roger is against the Russian invasion though
although i dont know anything about roger waters other than his position on ukraine and Palestine
I'd say this stance is different
and bam 14k retweets
just validating his method of getting fans and nonfans arguing because what he said is vague and pleases noone
the best part would be all the discussions on "rightful borders" that would flare up like any border is more or less valid than the one that came next
and create discussion
it's really interesting how his tweet is perfectly crafted to please noone
<:smart:298304900520214529>
or maybe he was so successful at it that we didn't hear of it
bezos is much more private at least
musk wins that because he's always in public
he gotta always be talking about the current thing with a hot enough take
since his value is tied to the stocks and speculation
he lives and dies by publicity
stuck between the byzantines and the persians
not since the 6th century BC
when has it been a good time to be armenian?
russia has always been azerbaijan's ally
he would be replaced by someone similar anyway
hey you could be tall and thin or short and super thin
are you just incredibly tall or thin?
damn that's super low
oh you can dodge it because of that?
what else is there to say? the entirety of this chat since yesterday <:pykeLUL:449019522305753088>
otherwise we'd be going back to the 9th century to analyze it
these problems are way more modern
That is another issue entirely
its nothing more than context
its neither an excuse nor giving the entire country away
it doesnt help they're also extremely corrupt <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
since the other pro-russian president was removed and zelensky did a 180 in terms of his stance against war, those people felt a bit abandoned
the annexation of crimea was so easily exactly because the people didnt really mind it
it was easy to, those people are almost russians living in ukraine
which sadly is even more present now
and its worth nothing they suffer quite a bit of racism and discrimination even inside
the eastern ukrainians voted for a different party, spoke a different language and had different wills
there is a massive divide between eastern and western europe
as circles is saying this is not quite true
yeah it is child's play
thats cool though, why did you ditch
literally roleplay smh
no discussion gets more heated than when china and taiwan are involved <:pykeLUL:449019522305753088>
hadnt heard that one in a while
country balls
wait are you saying clay as in
same result
if taiwan wasnt the biggest place for that we wouldnt have this situation
if they do that means less US interest in taiwan and subsequently less chinese pressure
until then its gonna be the tense triangle we have now
unless there are literal foreign troops or weaponry deployed there, that would be problematic
they dont need or really want to invade taiwan
im not too worried with that
china has much less to gain by invading taiwan than russia had
imagine trusting any sort of potency on their word
there was more than one argument (there was a lot of back and forth)
if you spend a lot of time sitting down your back is probably arced already, thats a couple cm you lose
oh thats not as short as i thought
thats him
that picture of the miniature cat on one finger
they're all northern vietnamese
call them all western japanese
its really interesting but also depressing
the legendary asian triangle of hate
you could say like uyghurs or tibetans
whatever the name is is irrelevant but comparing it to the japanese being called chinese is a stretch
this is a big stretch
well one region on an island that small
it seems quite split
lots of taiwanese still consider themselves chinese though
and human experimentation
chemical warfare and stuff
yes
that doesnt solve anything
because thats kinda just being brainwashed into hating the people who are brainwashed into hating you
i was gonna ask that were they born there
that person's just very racist wtf
i'd say probably not but that sounds cool
we're too tiny
cant say, dont have that here
~~i mean imagine trying to run the world under a singular central government~~
only one country ever claimed us and succeeded for a bit
my country's safe from that
<:monkers:951842330204332143>
habsburg federal states
in fact europe would have been like 3 countries at best
if all these things were taken literally then england and france would have been one country
taking these things as face value is so pointless
they saw themselves as chinese and meant to rule china so it makes sense
its silly to claim "yeah this is the place of mongolian history"
the people were so spread from kazakhstan to china
mongolia was barely our concept of nation for a long time anyway
mainland china doesnt claim mongolia though
i know they were intertwined
as in officially?
do they?
would have been a massive flex if they had gotten them
i know those things are 100 years old but still
the fact mongolia was on their claims is really funny
politics are interesting when people have a mind to learn and change otherwise its just screaming and strawmen <:pykeLUL:449019522305753088>
its still semi serious
its better like this than the discussion that was brewing up there
very unfortunate too
it's very interesting how easy it is to disagree over ukraine even if you're both against the war
don't think anyone here does
not at all
your previous message kinda spoiled it
pug are you American?
I've gotten mad at my dad because of politics and it sucked
it's not worth it
argue with your dad but drop it if you start getting mad
how does one compare which war is "worse" lol?
not even Afghanistan collapsed and they got fucking reverse conquered again
but really funny
they're ridiculous
"the CCP will collapse in 30 days"
everyone's a china authority these days
<:hehe:421108261778096128>
you mean the warlords in every century?
in a way lots of it still guides their ideas today
they are extremely proud of their history
they definitely do
we have very little chinese history represented in our schools and history, so we kind of assume it just doesnt exist and that if we dont know it, noone does
the british opium wars actually created china its true
like there arent people here who think the middle ages were just templars running around
probably strawmen with uneducated chinese people
which is very interesting
i myself was reading about the yuan dinasty
although the honor of deleting history probably goes to the spanish <:pykeLUL:449019522305753088>
revolutionary fervor always goes too far
which is unfortunate
definitely
~~too much sometimes, please stop making stories about the three kingdoms im begging you~~
even to us so far away lots of it is known
over such a large area
it would be a gargantuan task to erase so many centuries of history
they didnt erase nearly enough
this has happened all around over various pretexts
watch them just make a weird adapter
Are they gonna modify the phone or the charger?
i thought that was gonna be a hot take lol good one
being forced to spend 3 seconds on r/ukraine
try it now

"mr musk, people forgot you were messing with buying twitter already, they aren't tweeting about it, should we make the offer again?"
"ukraine im taking crimea"
"lalalalala i cant hear you"
just 1 more
we're maintaining peace give us 1 more year please
poland declaring war on japan in ww2
and also ridiculous war declarations
i love those cases
it really is not that OP
wait it was on the same level as heroin? that's crazy
cant wait for ben Shapiro's take on this
even Biden is joining the Drugs side on the War against Drugs
just a little trolling
at least (for now) riot employees dont steal breast milk
Riot Games is the same thing
like most gaming companies apparently
since the gaming area wasnt considered a real area until recently
tech stuff in general but gaming companies in particular
this is what happens when the area isn't considered a real business so there is no public scrutiny or standards of these companies
gaming company screwing over unions? who could have predicted this
defending abuse and pedophilia while also being homophobic
yup, that's 2 yikes in one
they're about the age of consent being as low as possible
how progressive
he was fired and not put on paid leave?
he had the burger
yes he was
that looks like a gta scene
what

we found her its Miss Gender Ideology!
Oh I like talking politics and this is just free shots
2 seconds after saying kids are being brainwashed
and then he goes and writes  books for kids
doesnt even try to hide it like many do
theocratic fascist which is even crazier
its always the gender ideology and the wokes and the whatever its called this year
always fighting the windmills
it was this tweet
gender ideology is literally the worst thing in the world and we should fight it to the death like wtf
dying on the worst possible hill to die on
he has the craziest most derange tweets
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
cant imagine there wasn't an ideological reason at the basis of it all
otherwise there's nothing good around
if you disagree you call them out on it but thats it
they do good and they do bad
you dont rate a country on "good" or "bad" man
<:1DazaiShrug:827796452632690759> up to each one
thats not really how it works lol
there's astroturfing but come on
couldn't find any other source on that, but if that's true, big L Evo
he cant be neutral on anything bigger than, idk, pizza toppings
every conflict has a side that benefits him somehow
tesla is a global empire he has pies in every game tbh
literally Iron Man
he's fixing the world haters

Nah Activision blizzard harasses adult women, and take their bottled breast milk
good reference
everyone had a in-show photo except chris

EA podcast
even bioshock gets one
thats honestly not that unlikely
probably stretching the definition of good but its fine
i wouldnt have watched it if it was today but it was fun
e7 is kinda crazy
I'll play it safe and not open the loli with little clothing video in public
they're having a great time
