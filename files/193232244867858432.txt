I just added it to my server
Melua I love you
<:mikucry:646598290946654209>
and I still want it back
I was wondering where my padorumiku went
27+3 is 30
2 would get us to 29 boosts, we need 30
ok if I can pull this job, I'll drop three boosts
Oh. Wrong channel for this.
^
1st - Miku
2nd - Shirabe
3rd - Garie
4th - Hibiki
üëè
Yeah it's bot only
And it makes me sad.
Garie is my third fav.
^
No Garie role either, I feel ya
Lookitdisnerd

Where is Girls' Lane
<@!217297243940716545> nerd welcome
I think I melted. I love this ship.
So cute.
This makes me cry a little
Okay that's absolutely adorable
that Kanade up there literally looks like a new MegaMan form
I can rock that.
That 'dragon' up there looks like Methode and that's literally who I thought it was
THANK YOU
<@106866895076003840> can I use that as my pfp pls
THAT MIKU IS SO CUTE
^this is why I want a Garie role
I mean under full control, not that kind of thing we saw
Durandal Hibiki would be absolutely insane to see
that is a really good reference, oh my god

<@!193408538909868033> MAKI
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
also I see an NC main <:squint:511891878715719690> but that's for another channel
and yeah, it's missing quite a bit
IIRC, she did use pistols in her SS during S1, but I'm not sure if that'd be counted
Oh god, Aya in the Shul Shagana
I'd still pick Garie
...I sound like a cold and calculating killer.
Dunno if anyone here has seen Kingsman (the first one) but Valentine's plan was effective. Crude, but effective.

Not something I'd personally support as mass genocide is not my thing, but if you think about it, it could work in the long run. You pick and choose who dies. You then kill everything who doesn't agree with you, whether they like it or not.
could always use Valentine's plan then
There are very few causes that are acceptable and correct, but people try to justify their reasons with stupid things such as revenge, or jealousy, etc
Because there are causes out there that it might just have to come to that, such as the situation in Hong Kong
I would agree to an extent
^this is true
^this
and think the world should bend to theirs
yeah, part of that problem is some think their culture and traditions are superior to others
Basically something that all people can understand and come together on without sacrificing individuality and/or their separate cultures.
A similar idea that could work - assuming people were willing - would be something like the Khala, from StarCraft. Something that unites all of us, and allows us to share our thoughts and emotions without throwing away our individuality.
And some people take that very seriously, they may take it incredibly far as a result
Sure, it would bring unity and break down barriers, but a lot of cultural identity would be lost
Such as what he mentioned in the screenshot
It would also cause more issues
~~Destroy the moon, remove the Curse of Babel~~
Probably China vs. English-speaking countries (Mandarin Chinese and English are the two mosty known languages iirc)
I think there's probably gonna be another world war when it finally comes down to it
well, global anyhow
that's why people expect it to be the one that becomes universal
that could have changed
at least that's what I remember several years ago
because it's the current predominant trade language, afaik
~~Now if we all sang Apple, we might become even closer~~
It brings thought and understanding to each other, even in the midst of terrorism/cyberterrorim, racism, hate speech, etc
See: WW2
Precisely due to the fact that people die.
Well, what he did was have signals sent out that shut off emotional inhibitors and increase aggression.
The point of his plan was to cull the population by a large margin, then repopulate carefully in a new world. He chose those who shared his ideas and vision, and those who didn't agree, got locked up or killed
I mean, by that point, you've already thrown that value of life out the window as it is
True, but when you're purposely trying to take out 90% of the population, regardless of who it is...does it really matter about the value of life?
I promise I'm not one, I just like analyzing evil plans
And no, it's not gonna stop shit
That doesn't really make any sense. You'd think such an important part of a country would be open every day.
They may have had good intentions, but this is not the way to go about that at all.
^you also need proper certification as well
*hugs <@!246678192360783872>*
Endro is good
I KNEW IT
I would hold her hand, yes.

Miku is worth it
