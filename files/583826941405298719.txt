where is shirabe
Dess!
i love her gear, she is my best girl
Dess
i can't wait for XV in July
i love kirika and hibiki
I just joined this discord because i really love symphogear and it's my favorite show
hi
i mean if she existed in real life
if she was alive i would adopt her
Dess
is that just symphogear too?
wait there is an Rv
yea i checked the wiki this week and found out what it may be about
i wish the game was in English already because i want to play it badly
true
do we know who the villians are for XV
they have been dating since Gx i think
i really hope they date in XV
i ship her with shirabe
she is a cutie pie who doesn't mean any harm
I like the OP
It would be interesting if kirika found out her real birthday. But what if it was the same day she arrived at the orphanage
Cool
So is he buying this stuff for us and we send him money for it?

XV is so good
It seemed like from this episode the show could go in so many directions for plot
It was so amazing
I loved the kirika and shirabe duet
I'm going to get my boyfriend into the series
Amazing
Just watched episode 2 and it was good
I'm 47 when the show happens
I feel bad for what tsubasa saw at the concert. She may never sing again or at least for a while
Lol

Lol I'm not surprised fudo is behind all this
Just watched the episode and it was amazing
I wonder why hibiki is floating in the abyss of her mind
I dont like using paypal
I did. I decided to buy the items myself since I'd rather not have someone mail them
I liked yesterday's episode
