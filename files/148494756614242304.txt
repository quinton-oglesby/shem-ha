(at least i'm pretty sure it is)
Emu Otori
the character
WONDERHOY
EMU
Eunie!
as does takina as kuroko, at least in skillset
...chisato as the railgun makes way too much sense
I mean considering what she does in X-drive, she could probably try it in base form too
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912> <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
ah yes, my fav ships. HibiMikuChris, KanaTsubaMari and DMJii

android bikki, damn
little dolls designed to repel or pray for rain, iirc
Yuyuyu! My children

<:Ver:704169051391524875>

Badass goofballs
I love them
melia got that KOSMOS drip

That'd be very cool
Even better
I did not know that I needed Hibiki with Barbatos mace, damn
So much good shirabe art
~~don'trisetothebaitdon'trisetothebait~~

TSUBASA!!!!!
or is Medal Suzdal Panic more appropriate?
Koi no Makyuu intensifies
and was like "who the fuck is that then"
yeah i saw tories and had a stroke because i thought it was talking about the tory party
tbf i should mention that i did actually want the UK to stay in the EU, but was a year too young to vote at the time. but even so, it is still not as simple as "just leave lol"
I live in the UK it *really* was not as simple as "just leave lol"
a majority of the UK's current problems are due to the policies that were put in place to allow brexit to actually happen
just look at brexit
no, you really can't
same. granted i failed my test and haven't tried again since, but its just a good lesson
"here, have a road that can barely fit 2 cars. also, the speed limit is 60 mph. have fun!"
i live in rural england and some of the roads here are... holy shit they're so small
she's basically The public face for terfs over here
yep
UK government is trying to block the new scottish gender recognition law. take a guess how JKR is involved
i can see why from some angles it might be appealing at first thought. but the second you look any deeper it falls apart almost instantly
I Refuse
it'll probably be a little bit before i start though, since i'm in the middle of both jojo part 6 and nanoha A's rn
~~i started watching sentai with gokaiger, i fear no anniversary season~~
noted
jk
~~start with healing good so everything else feels better??~~
if i wanted to start watching precure, what's a good first season?
ah i see
is it like the Kamen Rider Ghost of precure or something?
i have never seen any precure season so i'm just sitting here wondering what's wrong with healing good
i must also watch this because NANA WILLS IT
just to be clear, i did like ghost. it just didn't think it was that great compared to the seasons in the two years either side of it
ah i see
i am watching g-witch each week as well
i'm an absolute casual when it comes to gundam, only seen 00 and IBO
And yes, madoka very good
She may have done already! I believe she played a Precure. If only there was another...
<:blurryeyes:697653025933754370>
As an anime only I don't think touma is bad, but I will say I preferred both misaka and accelerator
Ouch
This just reminds me that I need to keep watching index. I've seen index 1, all 3 railgun and accelerator. Need to start index 2 soon
oh yea i forgot about Love After World Domination, i watched that too
i don't typically watch seasonal anime as it airs, but i watched lycoreco as it aired and i'm watching G-Witch
...oh my god, its been basically a year since i first watched geah
https://tenor.com/view/konosuba-explosion-anime-gif-23322221
i am known for having a pretty low bar for anime, so i'll probably like it either way
yeah tbf a rip-off is fine if its done well. i personally think symphogear is done well
okay so i watched the first ep of nanoha strikers. kinda alread miss it just being nanoha and fate, but i really like subaru already. although considering my love of both yuna and hibiki, i guess it shouldn't be surprising that i love the punchy character
its almost so obvious that its got to happen
i stand by my thought of them and the devices breaking through it with pure willpower though
(ftr i am mostly joking. i obviously don't like the og cast being handicapped, but yeah it makes a ton of sense from a politicking point of view)
but that's enough for the night, i need to sleep now
doesn't mean i have to think its smart!
yeah, i get it, and it makes sense
which seems stupid to me, why handicap yourself?
with the excuse of other divisions getting jealous of unbalanced power
yeah it just got said
at least things are happening now
but calling it now, they'll break through it with pure willpower when needed
ep 4 done, what is this "power limiter" bullshit?? sure, they're still stupid strong but its the principle of the thing
seeing nanoha school the recruits is nice though. even if she's not the focus all the time, its just nice to see she's as strong as ever
that said, i do hope something happens soon-ish
i do appreciate training arcs though, so i might appreciate this a bit more than people that don't like them
i get what you meant when you said it was slow now
nanoha strikers ep 3 done. while i *am* enjoying the development and character stuff so far, absolutely nothing has happened yet
Haruka Terui is great
we have a thread for gwitch too
nanoha strikers 11: ||*CHRONO IS MARRIED!?!?*||
i do appreciate the point they're trying to get across, though
nanoha strikers 9: ||okay so during the 10 year skip they just casually brutally injured nanoha. wonderful||
basically
its nice to have a talk-no-jutsu protag that is also willing to fight right away if a person won't listen. even as far back as season 1, when it was clear that fate wouldn't listen to her she just brutalised her with i think it was divine buster?
||holy shit nanoha just *brutalised* them both||
Nanoha strikers ep 8: ||seems like Tia is starting to learn gunkata, that's pretty cool. i'm not expecting it to see *too* much use, but simply having the skill is cool||
i stand corrected ||Yuuno is here!||
...i just realised that ||we haven't seen arf at all this season. and i don't think yuuno has shown up either?||
nanoha strikers ep 6 ||oh my god they're bringing back the fucking jewel seeds||
~~||Archer Illya vs Saber Alter|| my beloved~~
i really liked drei, but getting through s1 and 2wei was painful, with the occasional really good fight saving it
agreed
i could see that, considering how closely linked it is to 2wei
~~but the drei anime only has like half of the manga, then there's the movie that's the best thing in the entire prisma illya spinoff and then the drei manga still has ton of content left to use~~
because its confusing like that
zwei is season 2, zwei herz is season 3 and drei is season 4
yeah
They've only just been added to the game. They'll probably be in the anime eventually, but it'll be a while
let's be honest, that image get thrown around whether the shows are good or bad
i'm over half way through nanoha strikers, are nanoha vivid and vivid strike worth watching afterwards or should i stop with strikers?
ep 4: ||*fucking knew i recognised aoi yuuki's voice*. although i'd be lying if i said it wasn't the yell that gave it away||
build fighters ep 2 done, this is so much better than it has any right to be, i love it
you joke but i'd love that
okay, ty
gundam build fighters is the first build series, right?
because i am apparently unable to stick to a single series at a time, i just started the first ep of digimon ghost game
even better then
so what you're telling me is that i really need to watch this if i'm in the mood for fanservice and for my brain to melt, likely at the same time
the legendary ultra instinct shaggy
what's the Astraea F from?
00 in a vacuum is honestly perfectly fine, but being sandwiched between the Exia and the Qant hurts it a lot
i do prefer 00-Quant to 00, but i prefer exia to both
congrats, you've all converted me. it was definitely recency bias
but now that you mention it, it does look kinda silly
ngl i kinda forgot about the weird back face thing
that said, Exia stil bestia
okay so taking another look, it was definitely recency bias, i forgot how good dynames really was. still prefer arios and seravee to kyrios and virtue though, i think
maybe its recency bias, might look at the S1 designs again
~~that said, outside of Exia i prefer the gundams in S2 to S1. i love Cherudim~~
i enjoyed both seasons of 00, but i think i preferred S1 slightly
one of my fav gundam mechs
literally, the reason i sat through some of the bits i didn't like is because i wanted to watch Exia do shit
but ngl i enjoyed the political intrigue part of it and also, honestly, just. Exia Very Good
*laughs in 00 S1 being my intro to Gundam*
cool, ty. if its short i might give thunderbolt a shot first
i'll probably see them all eventually because i'm Like That, but just which one to watch first
just like basic concepts of each of them
well i've seen IBO and witch, and i've started build fighters and am really enjoying it so far, and gonna watch ReRise when i get there getting through the build shows. but what about the others?
definitely noted. how many movies are there?
keeping in mind that i've only seen 00, IBO and G-Witch, what gundam should i try watching next? (I have started build fighters, but i mean like a main gundam show)
from how far in i got i liked Wolfe, but a single character does not carry a show for me personally
i've heard about that, yeah. apparently the middle arc is the best?
ngl i tried watching like first 5 eps of Age, but i couldn't get into it
you have my attention
arm-mounted blades and drone weaponry are my two weaknesses, what can i say?
all I know is that I'm a basic bitch and (from the shows I've seen) my fav gundams are Exia and Aerial
i think 00 looks a bit better with the 0 Raiser? but still not ideal
it was only like 2-3 months ago, but my first gundam is 00. i plan to watch SEED eventually
yeah i distinctly remember costs being mentioned, like firing the rifle for the ramiel fight (screams geometrically), but never any actual numbers
how many eps is cross ange? now i kinda want to watch it and see the chaos unfold
Yuri and Haseo are badasses. there, there's your story
where's the ||grimgerde|| when you need it
Teddie is Teddie
its Teddie
Not in the slightest
One of my people
Is it like in that weird spot where it wants to reference things but they feel almost reluctant? That's usually annoying, yeah. That said, I haven't seen it
okay, i am now caught up on digimon ghost game. i am definitely enjoying it, but also its extremely episodic, because we're at ep 61 and ||we only got the 3rd mega last ep and still technically haven't started the main story arc||. that said, the individual episodes are entertaining and definitely make it deserve the Ghost Game subtitle imo
yeah nah i saw a load of the tropes and references they were throwing about and it was so fun to catch them. the henshin and role call was classic
i had fun with it. as a parody it did its job quite well, imo
shirabe but sentai

he should have gammamon with him tho
ayy, Hiro is there too
https://tenor.com/view/inazuma-eleven-inazuma-eleven-asuto-power-gif-15267831
he's also Asuto in Inazuma Eleven Ares
i have a problem
i have already mentally adopted this boy and we literally only have his name and design
https://tenor.com/view/rosa-rosadiaz-bb99-brooklyn99-gif-9847214
me @ Cure Wing:
i have never watched precure, would this be a good time to start? i know its an anniversary, but i started sentai with gokaiger so that's a non-issue
ep3 done, karen stood *no chance* holy shit
also giraffe
okay i'm not entirely sure what i just watched but i have decided i would like to watch more of it. i got interrupted partway through, but now ep 2 here we go!
Was planning to!
I'm off work tomorrow so I might just binge the whole thing
so in a complete impulse decision, i just started revue starlight. i'm in for a wild ride, aren't i?
gotta leave the movie for a day or two due to other commitments, but that was A Ride
and just finished ep 12
just finished revue ep 10. ||the duet was awesome, i saw the 1v1 coming a mile away, *but how dare they end the episode like that*||
i'm personally really liking how the fights are there to help tell the story. i adore bombastic action, its part of why i watched gear in the first place, but its nice to watch something different (for me)
i was in both band and a theatre/dance group when i was younger, so...
on one hand i don't think this show will end up in my favs at all. but i *am* enjoying the ride quite a bit
honestly that's kind of the part that i'm loving
yes, there are indeed lesbians doing theatre
also i clicked on this after like ep 5 i think? i hate that you're right, i can't unsee it
am i suddenly watching ||Homura's Theatre Phase|| or something?
i was already enjoying it, but i am suddenly Very Invested
*What the fuck is this*
so i just finished Revue Starlight ep 7
Yes, ||I did go insane when that happened. Why do you ask?||
Yesterday morning I would have gotten none of that. But now?
Wakarimasu
Wakarimasu
i especially like how medal suzdal panic feels like a natural progression of koi no makyuu. you can technically say that about all of them, since that's the entire point, but i just felt it The Most there
that was such a good set of lines though
valid
i did enjoy the mahiru revue too
*exactly*
as good as every single revue was in that movie, i'm not sure any of them actually managed to top Wi(l)d Screen Baroque for me
Wakarimasu
that was a trip and a half
just finished the Revue Starlight movie
apparently, yeah!
not the accuracy, the chance of staying asleep is the coinflip
and then he beat the second one too
That said, even if it wasn't punchy, Tusk was still a direct combat stand. So I'm looking forward to how November Rains properly works
Too soon to tell
For all we know, November Rains might become punchy too, is my point
I did mention that in the spoiler block
||well, mostly||
Tusk wasn't punchy
Part 7
i enjoyed it, but also it was my first gundam so i had no clue what i was getting in to
just watched the first ep of MagiRevo. i enjoyed it
Oh absolutely
Honestly thank fuck for that, it was so annoying
(Digimon Ghost Game form spoilers)
Gundam Exia whomst? I only know  ||Siriusmon||
such a banger

Same
Spirit Tracks still my fav Zelda game
