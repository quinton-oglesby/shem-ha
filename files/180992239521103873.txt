<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
praise
but depends how much you value your time
yes
oh
someone else is doing it ðŸ‘€
f
i know the feeling
should be a xd bikky there i think.
yea.
<@!120363283151585280> i followed you.
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
paused
i'm getting better at killing those add in the green carol. (still can't really touch red carol tho) 
anyway i have one up with half hp and both add dead.
i'll hit it a bit
how does her barrier at the start works?
just block x amount of dmg?
huh should be around that much.
since usd is not the currency i use hard for me to tell
doesn't make it look any better tho
or maybe just me
~~at the point he spend 10k gems on xd jii just to get 8 copies of ignite chris~~
i want to say dolphin... but probably a whale at this point.
tho i will slow down how much i spend now (till the next bait)
+mdp chris
for miracle
yea
it depends how well i do in the first try if phara randomly decide to spam her stun + poison... it can get worse.
i haven't tried magic carol yet since i raised new cards.
but miracle i can beat in 2 5cp
yea my first 3 are ignite chris xd bikky and burnbasa.
hopefully i can survive with tsubasa to turn 14 when she use her 2nd heal reduction. after she dies xd jii comes.  
tsubasa at most must survive to turn 8 when the first heal debuf comes
so yea if phara is being nice with her stun/poison i can do this. 
xd jii op... 
this was 5cp. also my first 5cp hard solo clear.
she stop using debuff at turn 21? or was it 28?
after that she never use the heal debuff again
