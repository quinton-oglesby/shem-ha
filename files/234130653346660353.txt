she is underappreciated
thank u for the aois
average symphogear possessed once a year actually statistical error
miku "lesbians" kohinata, who gets possessed once a season, is an outlier and should not be counted
Shem-Miku: "and i felt so trapped in my own body yknow... like i was hurting the people I loved and i couldnt do anything"
all the other mikus at once: "mood"

lol
just jiggling through edelgards brain
theres a whole titty
Thank you
the fact that they cut the episode **right there** is so cruel
just finished it!
Hibiki is such a useless lesbian they could fuck and she'd think it was just gal pals
Dont need a kiss for that
They're obviously in Super Gay Love
Like
They're dating
"this is kinda hot actually"
And then while she's being controlled shes like
does shem-ha possess tsubasa
like,,,,, from the store,,,,, I hope,,,,,,,,,,
killed in noise attack
that's me
Kirishira marriage too pls.
Well obviously they're in love.
<@269655454957830144> are you the real hibiki
it was v gay
dont neglect your gfs
why are they looking at the camera and not each other
I just love her.
Or hell. She did probably kill a lot of people.
If Carol died twice, is there 2 little Carol ghosts in heaven?
