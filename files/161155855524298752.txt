I never get the head tails since we call the sides as symbol / numbers...
Seems good
yes!
I like that edgebikki's crying/nauseous face as she forced herself to eat the food
That angerybikki is good
The hibikisick one is pretty nice tho
You want one for left and right after all
if she doesn't want to, it's alright too
<:ChrisEmbarrassed:738167509869527060> works out
Just have chris being kissed by basa and maria <:DoremySmug:689958198039281782>
<:AUChrisCry:799419916092178442>
she does have very blushy looks
not sure but... <:AUChrisCry:799419916092178442> is pretty cute although I guess we have a lot of chris
Somethinf that won't easily slide up at least
How will they know though? Since some people boosted because of like nitro, and some boosted through different booster... Hm
well I figure it'll just be nice to have a bigger place to talk about the already posted fics. And for the other things... well, I won't speak for anyone else, but I can ignore things I don't like. Kind of the same as the already existing nsfw content.
I would guess it will lean towards more nsfw kind of discussion (not the serious-discussion types) but will perhaps be more towards kink / fetish, or even for more text based talk. Like maybe nsfw games can be talked over there?
Maybe instead have nsfw discussion? <:ChrisThink:801442525524131891> so it doubles up on nsfw fics and on other nsfw talks
Either <:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556> or <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939> for me
<:blobsquee:711842986589290576>
Reiterating the sentence is good as agreement!
Sacrifice the <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939> for the new megane
I do like :KirikaGenius: though ~~time to convince <@203444794737950720> to put it in...~~
<:KirikaActually:688433197402554423> yeah this is really good
That's why the name is umactually <:umactually:708580798583930883>
If only I know the name. I only know the meme
Kirika's expressive faces are perfect
I like kirismart
MikuLaugh perhaps?
Girls in glasses is great indeed
Yeet to emote server
Smh matt glomp is a legit word tho. I think
No glomping is involved
Squee is nice
it's like "HM. LET ME EXPLAIN THAT TO YOU, WHAT A SIMPLE THING YOU HAVE ASKED"
holy shit it feels like kirikasmug
oh that looks super adorable
it got official server even I think
which is understandable
tbh it got pretty huge, just that they don't want to add in more channels outside of the scope of the original topic of the server
maybe can combine vtuber with <#371105434771390465> ~~that's what happened in the other server I'm in~~
mobile probably need to be on beta
yeah that is true
oh
unless you are on phone üòî
being a mod sucks
honestly pinging isn't minimodding? ü§î
yes. Very real
nah, I'm not good with being a mod as I would say I'm really biased type of person and also really conflict avoidance so I poof away instead of handling problems
I think the important parts are the temperaments for modship since there will be confrontations at times
that's why I was referring more towards the technology channel in general
I'm in a personal server, and a channel kicked out a bot, but when thread is made for that channel, the permission didn't seem to follow so the bot comes back. <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883> but well it's just light thing, but the perm for threads do seem to be fucky
I mean it's understandable they don't really want threads
but that turns technology into quite a varied thing
also usually talk about job hunting happens there because the people there tend to be those who are used to job hunt (and because there's a lot of people with IT proficiency there too I suppose)
I'm in another server (kinda big I guess? but that one also tries to not have too much channel bloat), well the technology channel is folded into STEM (programming included), social sciences, finance, cars and transportation
under general-chat?
sciences and papers can be folded over there as well
I'm more of opinion tech is better as a new channel, and it can be spread to cover more than just gaming tech
I only looked at those channels when I was looking for artist to comm from to be honest ü§î
<a:KirikaHyperFish:726644338309726218>
<:worrySalute:435125732658774036> have fun
pretty much watched over all 5 seasons in like,  a week <:SakuyaStronk:661255469570064405> definitely happy to do so though
yeah, luckily I somehow never got spoiled of it <a:nod:486219714633138178>
<:worrySalute:435125732658774036>
just finished the whole series a few days ago and deciding to join in the server üí¶
ah, hello

Welcome <:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
True but sometimes it happens
Be careful of every channel ~~and sometimes even general-chat~~
Welcome! <:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
welcome back rei! <:ChrisWave:744465189596037168>

RIN IS NOW HERE
welcome!
Aaaaa welcome back!
welcome <:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
Oh! Then be careful on the other channels than <#336297387863703552> , there might be spoilers
Yoo asel! <:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
<#336297674707828747> and its sister art chat is also pretty spoiler heavy (and <#357682999300718592> as well. Pretty much a lot of everywhere is heavy with spoilers)

https://archiveofourown.org/works/32046115 woo, finished an AK fic after I got random urge to ~~not sure how many people read fics especially of other fandom here tho~~
||gen is with ogawa||
Or is it 7th wheel
Chris don't deserve to be third wheel <:blobtriumph2:580597641805561865>
I prefer bayonet too, but I do love a good poly
Yeah I finished all of the seasons ||still wish shem-ha did some sort of psychological manipulation on hibiki because hey, getting the body of the wife should mean something||
Always thought they need tsubasa to buffer but it should work
Damn that's rare
MariaChris
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
aaahh adorable
omg that is _adorbs_
mariachris is good too
you understand my thoughts
||i'll never accept this. <a:kyaruscream:712538236710551623> ||
omg yes
Omg the opposite is so cute
If she ends up with tsubasa (and maria), then she'll also be the cook
Oh in the AU it's obvious. I mean like even in mainverse
~~tsubasa is the breadwinner~~
I think with Bayonet she'll end up be the cook, if only by sheer virtue of that's the only choice
<:wokemamo:747664272955277382>
that is cool
yooo
poor maria
aw
so do you think the maria is sad is because of outside circumstances or Fine caused it-
<:REEE:384749373981982730>
give her mental suffering but not physical <:sOphieBrickd:574822865128521729>
no don't do this to hibiki :c
brokenbird is a fun trope
_fine what did you do_ ~~and why is this hot~~
woah is that fine / maria
adorable üôè
woah. Miko shirabe
~~miku~~
Miku,,,,,,,
QuQ
This is so beautiful
Ohmygod

<:worrypray:500531964177154059>
||YES SOLO THAT'S A LOT OF WHY I LOVE THOSE AU YOU MADE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. BIKKI CORRUPTED BY DIVINE POWER IS JUST HUGE YES!!!!||

<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
_different kind of shem-biki_

https://twitter.com/soup_etc/status/1230579928690655233 HAHAH those two watching hibimiku <:KokoroLmao:641390803356483584>
shemha totally will have harem, don't you see what she did to miku during that mental-sequence ||that ear lick...|| <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
AU where shemha manages to get bikki into her fold <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

https://twitter.com/soup_etc/status/1292245669428658177 oh my god
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
https://twitter.com/soup_etc/status/1296152538098495488 that artist also made tons of miku
damn this is good
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
no pets
hibimikuhibimiku
bayonet! :bayonethug:
it's the best considering how cute they are
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
all hibikis are miku's
wait is miku also taking the god since the god also looks like hibiki-
oh wow that's a super sweet bday present she wants
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024> must be dream comes true for her
time to flee <a:KirikaWhatRun:741321705850535996>
now I'm thinking of two hibiki trying their best to make miku happy and miku still topping them both <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
edgebikki with normal bikki are also good
both miku and bikki being corrupted... <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
omg
who doesn't need therapy in symphogear
edge need therapy too <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:wokemamo:747664272955277382> the ANGER
that's so adorable
oh my god
so the bow is the true limiter
oh god
longhair <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
AHAHAH this doujin
accept the miku in your heart that says all bikki are good
yeah, the difference is... woah
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
this is like the demure chris and comparing it to the normal chris
wtf demure hibiki is so weird
god bikki really gives off the prey signal
hibiki just looks so confused <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
flatter is good I can agree, but man, just having longhair makes bikki feels more mature...
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
long hair bikki is good
holy shit
she looks like "what are you looking at, don't touch my miku"
this edgebikki pic üôè

hopefully edgebikki will find her miku soon :c
this is so cute üôè
and that miku glomping hibiki <:yay:467217812574699520>
those are really cool yeah I can agree
ohh
man that bikki art is good (and chris on the 2nd image)
ahh
that sounds good
woah taq
I saw shemha/bikki art and that definitely immediately makes me go "yep, where's MORE of this"
actually shemhabikkimiku <:YuukaPlsRember:702672714074292264>
I'll say shem-habikki is a huge guilty pleasure though
can agree there üôè
I still far prefer hibimiku (or mikuhibi), but hibihibi definitely is interesting
bikki pls
>bikki asking edgebikki to do things she's not ready yet
kanade, what are you aiming to do üëÄ
üôè
edgebikki just ATTACKS
omg
a good kiss
ayy
Dragongears are good
Man
Omg
Yooo they are cute
and destroy peeps
it feels worse than her at G
<:akisweats:718800367143354440>
That... Miku (?) Looks unsettling
_I commished a lot of them_
hey I love dragons
_anything dragon is good_
dragon gears are good
oh I need to follow them at once
I still can't believe it
lol yukine found the maid look too good
kanadeeee
omg
adroable chris

https://twitter.com/getuyoubi5/status/1315591290734608385?s=20
ohhhh that miku with dragon bikki
play as bikki, get them all <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
it's old style shoujo
that wolf bot is awesome
_THEY ARE GOOD OKAY_ <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
although I think I'm recently enlightened on maria/chris
it's so hard to articulate it
saaaaaame
_looking at those memoria arts_ <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I guess xdu does make a lot of alternative ships
woa
I still haven't feel convinced with hibimikuchris admittedly <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> Although they... kinda work? I think? feelsbadforchris
(tfw I read a lot of once upon a time fanfics when I got into a _reading binge_ without ever touching the original tv series) <:KogasaGun:430233871825502232>
I might swallow them easier in oneshot vs a big fic though
but once I am I tend to have... _ideas_ and _preconceptions_
yeah I think I can swallow them easier if I never know the original
thank you üôè
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
I mean it's just that even in an AU it's hard for me to think otherwise kind of thing, but it's just my problem and I'm not going to say peopl ehave to stop
that is true
how I wish I have the power of multishipper
my otp is too stronk <:peepohands:688451294175821829>
that's one dangerous miku
damn
oh god <:zoomeyes:461302320613949460>
||well then if it's fine... hopefully this time fine will love her more. "love"||
~~I vote basa! and maria~~
<:TsubasaDere:689195981841236109> <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
My god. What a beautiful chris
woah
two bikki agreeing that miku's the best
<:blobfistbumpL:618587963298676767><:BlobFistBumpR:356710467495788545>
this is probably one of those feelings "is it wrong to be jealous of myself"
poor hibiki
hahahahaa
and they are in that room wher ethey have to kiss to get out?
that's the hibiki from primeverse, and the miku from edgebikkiverse
OH
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> 10/10 fluffy and awesome
awwwwwwwwwwwww
mm adorable
xdu's AU is complicated
<:IchiGasp:598562950080364592>
true that lily, I guess sometimes it's better to just let the dead lie... <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ohisee
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> I mean didn't we know that she's like, on coma for a few  years
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

"fuck my kids, ULTRA BEASTS MORE IMPORTANT"
wait, lily's mom did that to her? wellthen <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
SUFFER
||remember that lily's mom is really BAD towards her. And imagining miku in that situation is well... <:YumiStare:688429724065988721> at least this time hibiki doesn't suffer but it's because it all went to miku||
I'll not comment because everyone is finding it wholesome <:akisweats:718800367143354440> it's cute though

<:NoireUwU:609578382904262656>
Damn prime basa is unintentionally flirting

hell yes
AAAAAAAAAAAH
yeah this works out
while miku is the queen that takes care of home affairs
bikki as the king that went out to war and bring back peace
I can accept that as long as miku's the queen
biki as a king
Pat miku

~~are you implying it's basa soul singing that caused noise to appear~~
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>

Beyond in xv with basa
But trying to remember back in the anime it's pretty hard to feel she's one
You know I remember that I get told maria is team mom
Adorbs
aw that's good chris
Basa in ichaival...
Also does the relic tuned to their soul or body...
Both bodyswap and possession have interesting possibilities

Chris is in basa
Hibiki is hibiki
Miku having fun
Oh my god haha
Now I ponder of hibiki in miku and have to use ssj with miku in hibiki and have to use gungnir
Man bodyswaps is still good

On that hibiki one the kinda rough thing I get is alsong the lines of
- hibiki feels cold
- chris scolding her for hugging her
- hibiki points out that those 2 (dmjii) is doing it
- chris pretty much saying it's those 2 somethingsomething
- then miku being asked if she's angry or not and she said she's not
"oh everyone in edgebikki's universe is happy???? we need to right the happiness = suffering chart"
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
~~I still believe that we might get MIKU POSSESSED again because THREE TIMES THE CHARM~~
just that edgebikki think she is
I'm doubting she's dead
shy kanade <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
the edgebikki's miku isn't noted with (another) iirc
> How will "another Kanade" be?
wait. Kanade and Miku are the only ones without another version now then?
wtf
man not destroying heels
üò§
but then you'll get lowered scores
following mask protocol at least
maybe
edgebikki is following proper social distancing
wheeze
then edgebikki with elekleid vs susanoo!miku <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
~~and then she get possessed by susanoo~~
inb4 next part we get it from kidnapped miku's pov where she'll try to rescue herself <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
no corpse no death
just kidnapped
I believe miku's alive

King's Raid server apparently has it
<:wow:384949028023959562>
I never heard ofthat
woah
a miku-focused event will be good <a:intensifies:637288837290131469>
actually does edgebikki get called hibiki (another)?
we need an AU miku
Sufferinnng
Ah
Those kind of suffering
Holding onto their beloved's corpse
Staring
Then the other will be alive
Either kirika or shirabe ded
Maybe I should sleep
Here I thought they'll keep the suffering to one dead and the other crying and alive
Oh oof
The feels
> Look at Kirika's face <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
<@203444794737950720> true, true üëÄ
Chris is good senpai
Gear VN but from bikki's pov
not existing is better than suffering exist
~~or maybe they don't exist~~
these AUs going darker than I thought they will
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> whelp
~~did she got a therapist?~~
tsubasa there try hard to be better to edgebikki
like iirc the tsubasa there is pretty okay right? Although they don't have chris? <:ThOwOnk:409892200290451476>

I saw chris/maria up there
Cute
Ahhhh
<:zoomeyes:461302320613949460>
hum, seems pretty cute <:OhIAwoo:492484587449090048>
these are nice arts even if idk who they are
now if only she also take miku this will be another bad end I really want to see wholeheartedly
I'm not sure what's the experiment she has done on bikki though, probably related on that fist thing <:ElfneinPresents:691733046633955439>
as she fell deeper and deeper into the coldness
so yeah "continue being fun for me hibiki"
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
besides it's not as if bikki can go back to her friends with bloodied hand that has lost gungnir
and beatrice was getting bored of destroying the world so she wants something "worth" it to break
hibiki promised to obey her
so in exchange of keeping the world snake away
ahhh okay I got it
and bikki made a promise
huh, it seems beatrice is experimenting on bikki here for sure <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
oh wait it's malice seed
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
if it's the dark seed one, primeverse
is this the one where bikki fails to fight off the dark seed thingy within her

The edgebikki is the one that is prickly and keep everyone at arm's length

At least there's some summaries out
I mean some works out

sounds good

yeah it's really good
I think there's a summary
||and in the end of that story parts, robokirika is dead <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ||
and the robokirika
well technically it's like there's alivekirika but in coma
then ||ver made the AI for the kirika and put it into the robokirika||
well, shirabe made the robokirika
the one with researchershirabe
uhhh one of the AU in the XDU

Elfnein
She's mikusexual maybe <:raydnbrikd:474283737715048450>
Honestly the only female parent we ever got that is fleshed out is nastassja
To her
Fudou
Traumatized after y'know
Either dead or uh
~~ngl he still hurts but compared to bikki's dad..~~
Well yea but idk why I find him at least- he just let things go and not insisting he's not bad
Basa's uh- dad isn't that bad
Although maybe if the illuminati didn't experiment on her
Fudou is the enemy
I blame those stained glass eyes
... and basa/miku has a lot of things to work on, with xv...
That is true pug, I'm just not going to discount AUs <:raydnbrikd:474283737715048450> (granted I think Maria/Miku can have an interesting thing going on... Since remember G)

Elaina? <:ZoomEyes:340489686285942796>
Although the way he treated sharon feels better than aubasa and that hurts to read through
Yatsuhiro is terrible but somehow I still can kind of forgive him kind
Yeah iirc au basa ran off <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> i need to reread to remind myself but i'm pretty sure of this
And she hates the family too much by that point
Because gen is cooler
Basa ran off
<:bayonethug:766518071950966815>
AU chris definitely has a huge abandonment issue (granted the main chris probably has one too)
True
Still tho, seeing ded gen...
Yea not saying it's bad
Stamina...
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
AU chris is like full on range support that dtill can do short range
~~granted if we count aubasa and auchris combi, they are stronger than the mainbasa and mainchris combi I think~~
That trained should only differ for chris
But main basa should be trained too right?
Yeah both are trained
That's why I go with "it goes both ways"
Don't thinj there is? Unless the big love she had for chris is counted
can go either way
it's a flip of coin I think?
blame gen

<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
physical copy you'll need to scan
compared to physical copy
you have easier time to share and ask for translation
if you have digital copy
well
if you like VN, JAST also does things
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
personal color sell their doujins on booth so I'm pretty happy, but I STILL NEED THAT ONE HIBIMIKU DOUJIN

a lot of anime women are good
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
But serena got oneee
Like, they are still have some differences, but you can feel they are still *them*
Because everyone's core personality sticks
The core is still there for sure
Because the another version so far has been superb
I hope they aren't forgotten
Only kanade and miku hasn't got the [another] denomination...
Because she doesn't get the miku [another] like the others
Although that's more of "miku from edgebikki's world"
Well from what we know in LS3, another miku is ||absorbed ny tesla's machine amd can be revived in his utopia||
<a:SoraBliss:737140462061748254>
need more AU Geahs
chris, shirabe and kirika too
or at least thats my assumption since like, serena and maria are definitely the another version
yeah, the [another] version
kanade and miku both have no IF version yet, but they took the miku from edgebikki version I think

ChrisMiku is cute though
~~basamiku, from the memoria~~
Idk why that is
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
But I'm pretty flexible for miku ships
Hibimiku is the best for hibiki
I'm sorry millhi
Even sg/miku is more okay <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

Aaahhhhhhhhh thr hibimiku up above and the miku and shemmiku's arts,,,,,
more of this is good
<a:aworrypetting:719119571235373066>
I like the fact the dark isn't being pushed off personally <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
instead she's rewarded to be hibiki so it's
:(
it should have been miku fails to be hibiki but has her own strength instead
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
~~dollhouse just further destroys miku's character beyond hibiki's extension tbh~~
Although someone translated all dialogues of bayonet charge <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
It's ok this one never got translated
~~poor au basa~~
The one that got taken care of by yatsu
Oh yeah her
Confirmed /s
One track mind
Miku's former track star
Because miku probs won't really get involved, since she's more one-track-mind
Basa and Chris also got enough I think
/brikd
~~hibiki~~
Miku needs more screentime than just making her to be hibiki's extension
The order is important!

```Scavenger once loved a young woman from her own tribe, who reciprocated her feelings. For whatever reason, they did not express their feelings to one another until Scavenger became Infected and was banished from her tribe. The next time Scavenger was able to meet the young lady, she had already passed away and with her the knowledge of their forbidden love. This memory is a keepsake that Scavenger will forever hold close to her heart.``` ü•≤

-> UBW or Zero, whichever, but watch the other afterwards
-> Heaven's Feel
also gil prototype is SO COOL
YES I ACTUALLY WANT PROTOTYPE TO CONTINUE UUUUGH. I remember seeing a bit of it and it was SO interesting ü•≤
I don't have much interest anymore in Fate <:CinnabarShrug:591699559294566426> ~~maybe if shirou is a girl... wait that's just the illya version I guess <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796> ~~
well it's up to people in the end
I guess?
well I do hear the VN is still the best so it's not wrong
the only thing is just that heaven's feel should be after fate and ubw route yeah? <:siptonai:585888549132304399>
it's not that much
I think I watched it after UBW anime
Fate/Zero is prequel ish you can touch somewhere I guess
the Fate route was never properly adapted, but you can try out the DEEN version I guess? After that it's just the UBW anime (NOT the movie), and then the Heaven's Feel anime movies

||because the story absolutely can be better and has the spice of it, just y'know, why the fuck do we get the boring mc instead of TSUBASA||
||also if the story's just better||
but overall it's just the false advertisement people feel :V
yeah censor thingy as well
so yeah, it's just the fact it doesn't live up to its pretty-much-kinda-lying-ad :V
(the gameplay and the dungeon is pretty good but I still hate its story overall)
I'll just put it under spoilers
idk
maybe?
yeah I probably should have spoilered that :V
and the mc is honestly ||should be kicked off for Tsubasa because she's 100% more interesting than this boring male mc who gets all the girls||
the story is a snooze
the best part of it is the gameplay
well considering at the time it was described as the mix of those two and seems to get a feel of... dark storyline, the way it went is pretty disappointing
good kiss

Bagpipe is the codename
Their coubtry is in civil war with reed being the draconic side and bagpipe on the lion side who is definitely trying to keep the draconic side either fully eradicated or something along those lines. Because if thwrw's a dragon then someone else has a legitimate blood for the throne :v
Pretty much opposite sides
This tho

ooo. I kind of want one too <:blobcatreach:366539036656926721>
they can do it on the state level right?
taiwan is also doing things pretty well
(trust me, I have seen someone like that and I'm very plainfully surprised that at least 80% of people I seen as friends also said that they are annoyed with that person)
nah, it's probable that there's more people being uncomfortable, they just didn't talk about it
still good to try bringing up to the mods
it makes sense to feel uncomfortable, I'll say. I have some experiences of that, and there's... not much you can do beyond bringing it up to the mods and hopefully they'll do something (and the person to do more things to be banned)
I don't care
but as long as they aren't touching real life kids
I don't like lolis
I don't want to murder anyone, but it's just... idk it's just fiction? Like
why is it not comparable though? If we are treating them as real, then killing them IS murder
like, if we are saying being attracted to fictional character is pedophilia, is killing them a murder?
antis are nuts. Fiction is fiction, and seriously, it's not hurting real life people
aight
but a random fanfic with let's say necrophilia? mm, blow it up
also I want to point out that these type of people tend to attack the smaller creators. I'm noticing that they tend to not point out GoT being problematic by having tons of rape and incest
(also for stuff like fanfics, I don't get why some kids can't just BLACKLIST the hell out of the tags they hate)
well I'm not going to talk to the kid, I'm more of just standing by the fiction is fiction
well in the end I stand by, it's fiction
because I'm not sure why do you think it needs justification
yea but I still don't believe a normal person will do weird stuff just because what they read in media

those that will tend to not be... well, mentally sound?
it's uncomfortable, I don't really like it and whenever I wrote stuff I imagine them older, but in the end it's just. It's fiction. That's what I stand by to
Personally? yes? I'm uncomfortable but like, it's fiction
it's not good in reality
haha no. It's fun in fiction, a lot of things are fun in fiction
*looks at what fb is doing* haha...
I personally feel that whle yeah, the fact it's sending off all those info to chinese government is sketchy, what about all these other apps that is also mining all my data everywhere and sell it to us government and all other companies? I just feel like it's being an excuse to attack china instead of attacking the root of the problem- the privacy concern (like I'll prefer it if they attacked all of them instead of just tiktok)
don't make perfect the enemy of good or something, is what should be considered right now I think?granted I shouldn't say too much considering I'm not in US
Seems like a case of bi/pan?
Glad to hear that! Supportive parents are always awesome
You can spend a long time thinkingnto torture people, as long as you didn't do it, it... Just well, it doesn't happen and no one's hurt
It's alright <a:2bpat:442103702900310026> I always feel it's what you do and you feel about it that matters the most
I say the fact you didn't do them is good enough. I don't think I'm that bad of a person and even occasionally I have very tiring thoughts of wishing death upon people
I ah... Usually find someone I trust with and chat with them in DMs (also the ones that are online), and also force myself to do deep breaths
ah okay
this is probably a faulty memory, but wasn't there an accident that happens because people have to change between metric and feet/knot for a rocket and it ended catastrophically? (something like the computer rounded it wrong or some such, so it ends up as the speed to go into the atmosphere wrong or something)
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
2chan is also super bad
too bad making stuff is usually put onto hyper-rich people's pockets
I just want something that will lead to - idk, things being okay
That is true
Telegram doesn't have censor and that's the place for a lot of harrassment and terrorism right?
"we aren't taxi!!! but we are regulating the prices like taxi!!!!!!!!"

man seeing the shitshow of uber

both fb and twitter are pretty right leaning no?
but apparently now it's used to intolerant of the tolerant or something
somethingsomething, tolerating the intolerant is bad
it's pretty much like that
>a guy being kind to a girl

<:hug2:582298530434252827>
thank you ten <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
like, okay, this isn't too related to the previous talk but like, just for example

I remember when ff.net is the _only_ place to go to. Like, the adult version isn't really famous and pretty much just clunkier (well, not like ff.net is smooth in the first place), and I remember the fervor whenever there was that TOO LEWD fanfic that get reported massively or something, and people hate that!

and that's kind of why AO3 is made, with a lot of tags and everything and WARNING put on the fanfic for you to stare at, and blacklist and such if you hate some tags. Which is good and I like it

BUT WHY IS THERE STILL PEOPLE THAT HATE ON STUFF THAT THEY EVEN SPEND TIME TO SEND HATE MESSAGE OR SPREAD THE STORY AROUND SAYING SOME OF THE WEIRDEST THING <:KirikaScared:672584678993297431> I- I just don't get it. If you hate it, _just blacklist those tags and ignore its existence_

I don't like certain tropes and I just stick that to personal dms and not spending time attacking people <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
why can't some people just be good <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000> why must they be an asshole

I mean over here it's a bit like that too but I just find it makes more sense for everyone to have one vote no matter where <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>

So no area wins

I HATE THIS ALL
I-
üò©
it's also pretty much ruining the environment and disturbing the people already living there
and then indo is also kinda ruining komodo island for whatever this group is that wants to capitalise on the island???
(especially since they pretty much passed the law through a fast track and people were geared to protest its existence)
there's also the thing with the job omnibus law which has a lot of problematic parts, although I haven't really researched that one. All I hear is that it wipes away the minimum pay and some stuff so I'm very iffy with that
o(--<
I hate that instead of making things cheaper, they went with... force people with this way? fuck them
also people tend to buy black market phones to skip that 30% tax, which makes sense
Indo put out that rule where you must buy phone locally to be able to conntect to the phone signal (aka you can't buy phone in other countries and bring it that way, you have to pay extra tax even though you only buy one. This fucks you up because tax is like 30% for phone)
Likw even just local stuff has so many things going wrong

people can do the vote where the vote will be moved if they are defeated?

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/crowd-storm-detroit-vote-count-election-2020-b1598248.html
huh so there's around 3.4m vote difference between biden and trump (not the electoral)
As long as you don't bungle the climax!
I'll hope it doesnct come to this then
Ah...
So can he really bring this to supreme court and in some ways make it his wins?
I'm hoping for higher wins so I hope a few more states flipped
Just make it people get something to vote
Yeah, I don't see there's a need to fine people if they don't vote
Over here voting day is pretty much holiday + there's shitton of ads that give discounts if you show the mark that you have voted, so even if you don't really want to vote well... There's still an incentive beyond just vote. Idk it makes an excitement to vote I guess?
but hopefully biden will win like, 2-3 more states
yeah biden only needs _one_ more state
ah...
well I can't deny that I did the same one some of my voting back then because I pretty much didn't follow local stuff
<a:stressedalyut:396142063445475328> well then...
... what <:NotLikeThis:281169932148932609>
No need to register or something, everyone's registered
Like, everyone can vote immediately
Make mandatory voting without the fines
I thought he was a decent guy sigh
<:NotLikeAlice:641390801804460043>
Someone knock me out with a chandelier to the head I feel like why the hell is a professor is believing in trump
God
That's what he's doing!
He's pretty much blaming electoral vote now
Oh god he-
Jeeze
<a:stressedalyut:396142063445475328>
"assuming if the votes are honest"
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000> tfw he's really believing the fraud votes is happening
And his tons of failed business
Yeah let's ignore his hundred million dollars personal loan from russia
"trump is a great businessman"
Tfw the more I heard from him <:NotLikeAlice:641390801804460043>
Anyway have to go again since this class is supposed to be no phone
Blargh
He was saying trump is wrong, but at the same time he dresses trump up more
He's pretty much glowing with trump evem if wrong is still wrong like- i don't get it
So why isn't he angry at trump too
Trump is also one
But
Yes he is
(he's pretty much going on the biden touching women a lot)
Man
Idk
Trump is also doing this?
Tfw i'm hearing my prof hating on biden but I'm also like
even if I'll end up hearing some people saying there's fraud in polling with that <:blobghostreee:405157461553840128>
it'll be nice if Ga flips
If they don't vote then oh well but they can vote now
won't incumbent wins?
ah
like the rest of the swing state <:zoomeyes:461302320613949460>
trump needs _all_ the rest of the state to become red to win no?
I'm sorry but m&m is just too good...
Candy???

I thought putin just uhh
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Using money instead of barters is still pretty good I think
https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1324391639628959745 huh. This is pretty interesting thread to go through
Wheeze
Feels weird that onion doesn't feel like a satire anymore
https://www.theonion.com/trump-files-lawsuit-in-pennsylvania-alleging-election-o-1845587740
I see
Huh...
Uh
I hear AZ is still flippable, and Ga might still turn back since there's still military vote (?)
Inb4 tie
So GA swinging to blue <:HYPERHONK:355591247815245826>
the true guess is 306 vs 232
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/638285044795834379/774277327613198357/unknown.png worst case scenario if AZ, NV and GA flips back to red? <:BlobSweats:357411435564761089>
oh no, I hope your mom and you will be okay <:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I feel like I have a lot of words to say but it's probably rather rude when I'm not an american <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I still feel the winner-takes-all is weird
I see <:zoomeyes:461302320613949460>
why does it go with whoever wins gets all the electoral vote instead of win percentage and divvy the electoral vote <:thonkpeek:357018485643149312>
man checking the popular vote is only 3.8m difference <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
okay good, try to uh- get rid of any of the scent on the body if possible
uhm
I'm sorry but it's just that the scent is on the envelope that has been coming suspiciously so far <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> that's just- suspicious
I was wondering if there's a chance the shopkeeper might be awkward and want to give stuff and give it but with that extra info on scent that's just- I'm not sure
Wait- okay that's even more worrisome
yeah, hopefully he's caught there, or if he's not he stops doing this. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
ugh, hopefully he's caught
well, but considering one just appeared today that's a little
well hiring someone to send is easy, or just him saying he's a courier is also possible
hmm
courier
I just accept it
if it's just opinion thing, I usually assign it to something random, like RNG thing and decide on what the RNG decides- or just go with what I want because sometimes the RNG picks something I don't want and now I can find what I want
damn
wait does that mean biden is now 7k lead in georgia?
<:hugs:586215487399133241> oh no :c
<:MadokaHug:616333748744487109>
Unless you are saying his tweets arenct trump tweeting
Not media
I'm looking at his tweets
Uh
>trump is not openly racist-
What
Also heard about stuff where he sold tons and tons of weapons to UAE even when advised by pretty much everyone not to? Is that one real <:NotLikeAlice:641390801804460043>
For biden
Moderate-right but still moderate
Biden is moderate
Is that that big of an assumption?
Considering trump is very, very right I feel majority of his supporter isn't moderate...?
What about the one done by US
Ah okay shem, no wonder
Unfortunately politics are always appearances
I don't think china is a friend especially when I'm in taiwan but americans probably won't need to worry for china for now. It's covid and whatever the fuck trump is doing to destroy everythinf while installing his cronies in government's key areas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PnkC7CNvyI I watched this and I was like "wtf this is dumb. Corporates with that much power will totally destroy people" <:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
liberatrians are just- bad honeslty <:MariaBully:689614085452464318> I saw some of their... rhetoric? and it feels a lot like they believe corporates will do good
Also not liking the decriminalizing drug (I feel like jailing people that used drug is like, pretty dumb... They won't stop doing it just because they are jailed...)
My prof continues to be bleh <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> said that the whole election is a lie anyway and such
Well they are the ones trampling everywhere
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
why is there so many east indian companies why can't they use ANOTHER NAME <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
dangit why they decide on VERY SIMILAR NAME
ah
ah
this one, right lank? The one that pretty much colonizes so many countries <:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
East India Company, VOC?
ah yes free market won't fail as we see it failing
<:Concern:724655255177920542>
https://youtu.be/jTYkdEU_B4o?t=719 I remember watching this a bit to try understanding and my brain bluescreened
libertarians are super- weird. And the systme they propose is dumb
dutch government can throw a pretty high fine on EA every week as long as they left those surprise mechanics in FIFA
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
~~also when will these companies that KEEP FUCKING UP ENVIRONMENT BE HIT WITH SUPER HIGH FINES THAT THEY HAVE TO CONSTANTLY PAY~~
hottake: corps need to think further than just short term profit and start to think of 100 years into the future
because rich guys have the monies or something
95% of people won't ever own big business <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> although idk about the numbers, this is just my guess
blargh
look at whatever the fuck disney did to copyright laws!
they already have too much!
like _why_ do you want to give more power to corporates
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
so it's just
ewwwwww even with government existing they are already pretty owning the people honestly
I dunno, I just don't get why do they want to get rid of gov so much. Like ok they are incompetent as hell, but I'd rather have government and corporates both standing, ensuring corporates aren't taking advantage of people too crazily and such
well, considering libertarians want to get rid of government... <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
ah <:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
so if you leave them, you pretty much have 0 thing
like money that is only usable within the corporate
like, I remember there was a time where corporates pretty much pay their employees with corporate money didn't they?
Fortune 500...
Just the top 0.1% or sth
No revolution
Well that's why I propose bapping billionaires instead
And not the billionaires
Instead of turning it every which way
I wish that we can all pitchfork the billionaires
I mean just look at how some stuff is constantly judged against western sensibilities
And some countries' political landscape will be hyper different
> I wonder how different our world would be if colonialism just...didn't happen.
One thing will be real is that there'll be a lot more different cultures still alive that is pretty different
like the eating worry of people not knowing if they can even eat tomorrow
but at the same time, I feel like there's a lot of misery that isn't _needed_?
ah, well I can't deny that
but do we need to progress when people are already happy <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> mrrgh
one of my ideal society is just that there's always a baselline of happiness for everyone, like a place to stay (that is nice okay, not a rundown shack or something), food, hygiene, outfit, etc. But everyone can become as rich as they want if they wish for it.

Like I know billionaires are bad and all, but I genuinely don't care there's one as long as everyone also doesn't need to suffer to live <a:ablobsweats:548314784471449610> but... I don't think this will ever happen no matter how good technology is in the future, I feel
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
When can we get money from being nice why is it always being bad
Blaaargh
That's shitty as hell
Like didn't bbc bans their journalist to go to trans pride stuff?
I still don't get the weird parts where people seems to like "you should give time for these [obviously very right-lean piece that kinda wants to break minority's rights] but these left-lean, progressive stuff? They are baaaaad!"
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
ah. Yeah I didn't realize the difference of these two words
<@!302063351767498752> imo, slavery shouldn't be a political issue especially at this day and age? <:OhIAwoo:492484587449090048> like- it should be simple. Humans shouldn't be turned into a slave (beyond some things but those aren't exactly something to talk about here I guess) and I don't see how that should be a political issue where it can be debated. Humans have rights to not be owned and that's that
eat the rich üç¥
Uhhh
https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1328200072987893762?s=21
People seem to love billionaires with how hard they try to protect them
/s
Oh no what a disaster
This sounds like a clearcut case
I have no idea, but I'm hoping that this will come to court and idk, disney will lose. Hopefully >.>
They are smoking the money they got
Sorry for that I'm just mad as heck

I also saw apparently parler ask for SSN?
he looks very adorable and good
<:MadokaHug:616333748744487109> <:MadokaHug:616333748744487109>
then perhaps I can point you towards professional services <:akisweats:718800367143354440>
mmh. First thing first is perhaps, try to ensure you get good rest, food and drinks
it's pretty hard to do goals when you are tired
hmm on no energy part, do you get proper rest, proper food and proper hydration?
Try to maybe change your goals to something more reasonable and then try to build what you should do to achieve tjat?
oh üòî
<a:lucinaSmart:397240947580076043>
conservatives should shut up and maybe think other people are humans
just drop the hammer (again)- //brikd
parler is... well from what I heard off twitter so this is like a telephone game, it's a social media site that aims to be uh... 'freer' than twitter
ugh <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
Well taiwan's like, also had that kind of wording so then they changed it a while ago as well
https://twitter.com/4CH1LLE5/status/1331737249667538946 geh <:NotLikeAlice:641390801804460043> I hate this kind of underhanded method
I'm in around more, although a lot of them are like splinter communities from 1 then some where they are just piled together
although this probably isn't the same for everyone, I find getting into different communities _online_ helps me a lot. Pretty much how I end up joining this place...

Although again, different thing for different people
Like immediately saying that to a stranger is just rude kind of thing
I think one could point something out... But maybe after they have seen it for a while?
Wait what? Trans panic clause? <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
TIL
Trap music?
Really don't get why people are so whiny they can't use it either lol
I never went to thailand to know which
Iirc it stems from the fact there's a lot of uhhh, well, I'm not sure if they are transitioned, or they are more of femboy / otokonoko, but there's a lot of them in thailand I think?
Like there's so often people that talked about "be careful with beautiful people in thailand because you know..."
And it just??? Annoys me???
I don't like it if it's used on irl people, especially since I know people that tends to label it as people *intentionally* deceiving them
Not having 30kg suitcase, what are you a noob? /Brikd
Excuse me can I have rapist be legally murdered then
Whatthefreakingfuck
Boars and hogs are very dangerous isn't it
(to which a bat is probably better)
I guess
I mean you can hit people with the gun
Iirc switzerland also has very limited the bullets as control?
Now I'm reminded of that one with 50 wild hogs attacking them or is that not real
Too long
https://www.facebook.com/241446929332714/posts/2518096145001103/ also on the talk about income inequality, there's this post that talked a bit about it
And I have seen too many of that to want more
And not the government?
People tend to attack the people
Also I have a lot of problems of turning china as an external enemy because uh
I thought the china thing is a lot of because capitalism and china was cheap labor back then?
I found a good post that talked about how in the past there was pretty good welfare all around?
I can screenshot it
Because it summarized a lot of what rep did
well that's personal thoughts though
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
quick death > suffering for months
I hope if it's deadly, people won't suffer too long!
I'm not sure if alien invasion is worse, but if they can fix covid at the same time-
I hope it's not marketing ploy though
that is true
<:KirikaScared:672584678993297431>
_not_ disappear and reappear and somewhere else as if it's the same item
yeah I saw it but like- I thought they all just appear at the same time
so they appear then disappear THEN APPEAR SOMEWHERE ELSE???

Apparently over here they believe that you can still show symptoms after 14 days (another 7 days) but those are rare enough you don't need to quarantine. (Here as in Taiwan)

honestly yeerks probably can handle my life better than me <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I still don't get why people liking fictiony stuff have to be burn at the stake
What dino said honestly
As long as they like things only in fiction and can separate fiction and reality
To correlate liking small body to pedophile is very heckle idea considering short people exist
Also short people exist that is adult
There"s ageplay you kbow
Do I still have my heart break and wish it doesn't happen irl? Yeah
I like a lot of illegal stuff in fiction
I... Don't think it does?
People can like *a lot of things* that are pretty much illegal and it should be fine as long as it's fiction, or it's done through consent
I'll once again say that fiction doesn't correlate to irl
I think noncon / rape are one of the top ones for that
People can also like to certain stuff because it gives them power over it. Or let them relish in it in a more... Positive way?
I just view it as fiction is fiction
I honestly don't like lolis
I mean the problem is I don't get why tos has problem with lolicon but not with murders but it's the rules. I still feel they are doing the "gta is bad because then people will shoot people" but it's the tos
It's to fictional stuff why should it matter? They can do it to galaxies being destroyed killing everyone (which is also illegal. Murder is illegal) and it's fine
... w-what?
What if they like it only because it's anime style and doesn't like irl children at all?
I mean I know some americans that see union as something bad
I only know police unions exist
You have my condolences for that, pharios ü´Ç

I remember ending up arguing with an american that ah... Apparently this is better for it to be like thos because otherwise american healthcare will go bad or something. That all the prices are good! It drives... Innocation and quality? Idk is that even true

when will mitch mcconnel or whatever his name is out of the senate
that is super true
Skgkskhs
Like why does a relief bill need to have "you get imprisoned for streaming" how does that *even connect*
Can we have a rule where a bill need to be connected to each other
What
Also can they stop adding weird things to the relief bill like that imprisonment for streaming <a:stressedalyut:396142063445475328>
Wew
<:PlumpThumbsUp:598349928661647372>
That's nice, mac
Although I honestly still don't get why some  people care so much for other people's sexual orientation
To be a supporter
Caring for others are really good way
Indo sucks
Aya reminds me how two people who are already fiances to each other and live together got grabbed by neighbors and paraded around naked because how dare they live together (and maybe have sex idfk) <:vacantmamo:665896084358561812>
Good job <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
like I just need that caveat of everyone is taken care of <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
can I say that as long as the country function as it should, aka taking care of people, ensuring people get the basic needs without fees (food, water, home, internet, etc, etc and no one should worry about basic material needs, also health), I can say that it's okay for billionaires to exist? although they probably can't in this kind of country <:vacantmamo:665896084358561812>
<:KirikaScared:672584678993297431>
mrrrrrr but anyway please don't say those two are the same
bahasa melayu
I think it's like dutch and german? but then again it's pretty alike at the same time
but there's differences
well same roots
Indonesian and malay are different languages
NO
just some bad blood
like uh... batik...
no, more of the things that happened
in general malaysia and indo has a pretty... strained relationship ish with each other
indonesian extremist dislike malaysia
no
idk
considering a decent chunk of indonesians want it too
I hate them
fuck
extremist in this case is _wanting to turn the whole indonesia to muslim nation with them at top probably_
only in aceh
eh, I don't mind about islam and such. Every extremist sucks
it's the biggeset, most extremist official muslim organization
fuck FPI
<a:ShirabeSob:775407675616788501>
people will also turns up to demonstrations about stupid things for the food
Indonesia for me
(although granted, his other opponent is someone I really don't want to be on the president seat either so... we were fucked)
with all the laws being passed and the kind of ministers being elected
granted from how it's going it seems this president is super smart of being good the first time then the second time shows his true self
yeah I mean the voter  base got bribed with one time food over here so
to the politician's pockets
it's corrupted away probably
okay maybe we have to move out of here now (?)
I think my problem is uh... more on the people? Like, people going on "oh no, they don't say I love you to each other, they aren't gay stop putting them being gay, they are straight"
I don't mind background characters having them and such
So yeah it's saying "nooo stop putting your politics into my game"
Well it came from gamers-ish community that always complain when lgbt is put into the game as a choice... Or female main character...
This reminds me of some bits "it's only not political if you agree to what's being said"
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Idk what is train in malay, but it's kereta in indonesian
Mobil and kereta
Than in indonesian
I would say it's essier to talk in english
Since I quite regularly went back and forth between indo and malay
and far healthier
~~what if they want to be controlled?~~ okay but in general that is a good point of view
I don't want to comment fully about this in this channel, but in general as long as the two sides agree. Or more sides... hopefully polyamory can be more accepted in the future
it's scary
I don't mind marriage. For me it's kind of a big thing to do with someone you love
fuck no
hope so
we are in same course and classes <:vacantmamo:665896084358561812>
well fuck that guy anyway, although I still have to keep myself be polite and etc, etc. <:heh:782946405856837652> suffering
he's not asking on broader situation
which means only on same sex couple
I mean any is okay but this one is in the context of "what do you think if you see same sex couple doing pda"
also after having people be pretty accepting of things, it's... pretty hard back in the middle of people that has those kind of thoughts. Legit have this guy telling us that he dislikes seeing samesex couple doing pda in public
if I say "these two seems to love each other" on a straight pair, it seems to be... more accepted, I would say. Compared to "these two seems to love each other" on a gay pair
I'm more of talking of the people surrounding it
So it's pretty hard
Like it permanently change things
Also giving birth for women's body is pretty hard too
Imagine damning so many people out of personal hate
It's personal hate too so it's like maybe 10 out of 10 million
<a:ShirabeSob:775407675616788501>
You know the sad part of this? I've seen people going "well welfare that took care of people will also take care of [x amount of people I hate] so I don't want it to exist"
<a:ShirabeSob:775407675616788501>
Like. I was searching for birth control in indonesia? Do you know that they need you to be married and have the husband there
Alhslhsho0l
It's expected of you to have a child or something
The problem is that it's pretty hard to want abortion in general
Blergh. Although I think that stems from the thoughts guys can't get raped (?)
IUD / implants for girls are good choices too
Althought guys' ways of this iirc is more permanent than girls'
Well, not having kids is a good way to not have child support issues
In general my thoughts are on a different matter because what I wish for is alike marriage but it's not
Not the disagreement
I think the problem is the very casual way of referring death
Can I say maybe we can have everyone that said abortions shouldn't be allowed to force them to pay for every children's food
People keep saying think of the baby's life but when the baby is born I doubt they'll help <:KogasaGun:430233871825502232>
I'm mostly on what choices can lead to most people be happy
I'm the same as circles, but the opt in or opt out shouldn't be hard or have a consequences
I can because that's what drives a lot of my behavior
Which is something other people feel to yoh as well, I presume.
I don't mind having my organs be taken but at the same time letting people having their organs taken as an optout is something I prefer because imagining to opt in is pretty hard
huh... I see, I see. Okay, seems like I didn't know much of the situation then
a bit weird?
ehhh, that is wrong too, but I feel like why not just use bi or pan I guess? <:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736> it is a bit like, bi gay which is
I'm not sure if I explained it rightly
iirc it's more on the... how can you be lesbian and still love a guy? Like there's sapphic as a term for liking girls more than guys. Don't need to put lesbian
yeah. The one in my mind is just those people being puritan as fuck. Like I'm not even 100% sure of the story by now, but they did it because they thought these 2 person that live together surely copulated and so drag them out and like, force them to be naked to be shown off to the whole village. It's. Fucked up
I have a bit of dislike on small village community thing, but that might be because it's very colored with wha thappened in indo. of course tehre's always good side, but with what I remember of people being _awful_ because of a few things it's... yeah.

I'm surprised
Facebook doing something
what kind of drugs are they snorting
how the fuck are they thinking biden is behind it
wait. Wait
Apple hasn't banned it right?

Well
So all this shows is that you can do domestic terrorism as president and still be loved by senate
iirc senate scale with population in the past, then it was changed?
is it possible in 2 years to increase the senate chairs according to the population numbers <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

They feel like trump is embodiment of what they should be able to do as well
There's one explanation that made sense on why trump is so successful. Apparently he just... Appeal madly to people that wants thr impunity trump shows
Idk how those thoughts held up with how trump acted now, but I have muted the political chat since honestly the people there is- a bit ewgh for me. Better just not see what upsets me
Ah yeah I guess that is true
I hear clinton isn't so bad especially compared to trump, but you can see that people think trump is better than clinton in... Idk, tons of people. Some people I know ~~especially businessmen for some reason~~
And people will probably started to go like "see trump isn't that bad!"
Considering 74m people voted for him again
It's international standards? Am I the weird one to think that *all* presidents should be allowed to get criminally charged
I hope trump will be held accountable. Also why the hell is president immune to criminal charges
like over here, while there's some people that vote by the parties, there's more people that goes "oh, x guy is better than the y guy"
isn't having candidates normal? But I always find it weird that you guys vote for the parties instead of the person
Didn't reagan ruins a lot of things that still affect everyone today
Heh I remember people all going that trump is businessman and he'll make america better <:worryclown:646330323180716070>
I forgot the right term
I think iris was meaning something of when society is uhh, on the overproduction scale, where the basic needs can be fulfilled and people don't need to work beyond what they wish to
oh <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> yeah that is true. Fun times of people being a huge assholes
why will feeding others need military intervention <:heh:796600446969315328>
~~didn't we actually able to solve world hunger, if we wish to~~ Then again I think I don't get the "throw away all those extra food because otherwise the price falls too much"
but it's like, one bot for cleaning, one bot for this, one bot for that...
I mean you don't make a robot to be better _at everything_
because by then, the works should be done by computers and robots <:heh:796600446969315328> I'm of the principle that labors should be done only by those that want to do it, and people get taken care of. All of them
yeah, which is pretty impossible <:heh:796600446969315328>
personally I do find it's best for humanity to strive to that kind of... world, where people don't need to work beyond what they wish for. So if people wants to study random things? They could! No need to worry for rent, food, etc

but then again, that needs technology to be better than it is right now, and people up top to be willing to let go of power so

True. Well I don't read the series to say they should do it one way or another
In less outrageous way, do you mean?
I hear goblin slayer is- a growth of a man from goblin killing machine into regaining his humanity?
huh, I didn't know anything about this topic, but I guess not surprising
(and it doesn't help that I don't like... the way it portrays the villains)
I remember feeling like "why is everyone that isn't on his side is always evil"
huh. This is interesting essay for sure. I'll definitely take a look at how the LN handles them before... deciding one way or another
me I'm interested
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042> oh...
Well no one said to look up berserk. Luckily, but I know the talk about goblin slayer was... Uh... That goblins are dangerous and rapist and such which is probably right but not the focus of the show? <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
The way people talk about it was more about the rape for sure. It's only recently I hear about the humanizing aspect
Huh. Wonder if I should pick up the LN. This definitely sounds really good
Imo racial bonus sounds fine, but... Not the alignment
I hear some... Problematic views held by the author for redo healer
even then, isn't the way to fix that is to have more mods and not insta-delete? It's just usually discord is very slow so this time it's immediate delete is... <:thinkeyes:412590216734310410>

I personally feel it's more understandable to not want to get between your pairs...
No
In general works are just so varied that I don't want it to be banned
In general most things don't manage, but at the same time completely eliminating it, is also going to hit things that can
||it serves to highlight the brokenness of her thoights when that happens anf that was amazing work by the translator||
Ehhh... I think we can never know that. Although I guess there's argument on just pushing the camera to look to the side but I have read one LN that completely works to discomfit me because the very fact it had the act written out
Eh.. i read through a bit before it's deleted but I disagree that it should be sanitized away. (Not sure on films or not, but honestly things should just have content warning and let people decide they want to see or not)

that's evangelion, armis :V
I don't mind of that, I just don't like... evangelical? Not sure, whatever that thing people do to try convincing others to join in or somesuch <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133> evangelism?
yeah, I guess missionaries are the words? I'm also not sure of whichever one that is that taught people to try spreading it, then if rejected will go and say "see, people are disbeliever and you can only believe in us"
They are the one doing all these things
I want to puke reading that
although it's not like fantasy doesn't have its share of blegh worldbuilding as well
because works that actually spend time to worldbuild makes it better
spice and wolf pretty sure is pretty medieval for the whole thing...? I didn't read the sequel much though
oh. Then I guess bookworm is quite the outlier then since the fact she's isekai'd with all those knowledge is why things are happening to her
considering how the world is, it can't really be helped
Bookworm or Re:Zero imo is also something that can't be done without the isekai part? <:ChrisThink:801442525524131891>
hmm, some books actually works the isekai premise incredibly well though and can't work with any other protagonist (unless you want to put in they got the knowledge some other ways... which is uh... I think won't be as good?)

although I would say isekai is also pretty old genre as well? Considering such things like alice in wonderland or that yankee in the arthur's court? (I only read alice in wonderland though)
although it had been very long ago since I last in one (and even then, most of the talk is on the chatroom)
I quite enjoy forums still
https://twitter.com/zenzeromante/status/1362868504400134147 hmm... not sure how right it is, but this is certainly giving an interesting viewpoint in how fandom now and back then differ <:ChrisThink:801442525524131891>
mine is hetalia fanfic <:CocoSweat:725405008505602078>
I tend to look at how they behave, although if that's not possible, I just think that people older than me is adult while younger is more child
eh, I feel there's still power abuse and imbalanced relationship that can still go on
I see... <:ChrisThink:801442525524131891>
although hm... now this remind me, what do you think of that rule of half your age + 7 kind for relationship <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
as long as everyone's in it is happy, it's good
Although I think poly and open relationship also differ?
I think the "you just want to cheat" is also a lot of moniker people use for poly
I think there's a difference between finding then attractive and wishing to be in relationship with them
Although considering laws, poly marriages probably can't work for now? As it might turn the relationship imbalanced
yeah, japan kinda falls hard by now as well, taiwan is the one I think doing the best so far
I thought NY managed to curtail it after a bit and actually doesn't have as much problem as some other states that has the leader not believing in covid?
that is very sad and very real at the same time
just destroy the need for jobs and that people just doesn't need to do anything much and can focus on their own betterment?
if they do that, can't they at least make people happier
are they even able to be okay outside <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Although it's ones that's like, historical romance things like that... Uh... That one queen from spain (i think) that is the first wife of henry viii
Huh. I think I remember reading some historical novel and don't remember if there's any disclaimer
Hm
Although maybe if they wrote about 2021 artists at 2100 where those artists probably no longer alive...
Historical novel is... Different I think? Like writing about 1900s vs about 2021 people are different

Holy hell. What is cryptoart anyway..? I saw it a lot but why does it even exist

also found some news from guardians that said the AZ vaccine is pricier in south africa (around 5$ per dose) vs 2.5-3$ per dose in EU <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
that's not... too bad I think?

Apparently there's a supervisor that really spent his time looking at who to fire and even nicknamed himself "the sniper"
Supervisor dependent too
Iiiit might also depend on which part? And yeah that
they had done that to 2 companies at the very least iirc
by undercutting them and buying them on cheap prices
and then takeover every promising companies
but useless in the big scheme of things, as they can continue undercutting people

I wish everyone can just have not difficult life but that seems so hard
(my thoughts, not sure if true)
they want house prices to keep increasing, and if people move to apartment then it won't increase as much
It's something like, male-male is fine as long as you are the top?
that leads to the whole _purge_ of everything

probably anyone with  manage permission?
administrator is designated separately though in the sentence

Also, by doing that, it'll also let the vaccine be useless because the covid will be able to mutate the more it passed through people
And yet they don't want to let the poorer countries find ways to make the vaccine themselves
Right now they are the ones hogging the vaccines (the ones saying no)
(except brazil)
You can see what's the type that says no

in house JP translators _are worse_
LMAO
in _US_
$80 per episode
(just to remind of the problem)
(also CR translators are paid very badly)
although over here or at <#371105434771390465> ...?
let me throw the short explanation the translator does
and the original japanese is also slang for suspicious
from 1930s
sus is a slang for suspicious
the original translator has talked about it
idk about the derp part, but sus works out and older than among us
sus is also a perfectly fine translation
Man poor mihoyo though
Maybe the best way is to never have exclusives both sides and instead just give both servers same thing?
Not right
While it happens because of gacha, I feel like the individual themselves are already well
I don't understand why are you tagging them, cocoa
(although do note that for me that problematic _fictional_ content for me should be okay, as long as it's appropriately tagged, so people can avoid it if they do wish)
if you aren't sure of the english, you can say what you mean in Indonesian and I'll help translate it
not liking problematic content is okay
I'm pretty sure it's more of inappropriate conduct in public instead of harassment if it's being consensual to one another...
do you mean "mereka melakukan ke satu sama lain" (to each other) or "melakukan ke orang lain" (just doing it to someone else)
<:TsubasaWorried:799504969241722941>
This makes that even worse
Ahhh
NFT is already bad but isn't this completely bad idea as well

I feel like this "liking a fictional, *cartoon* child image" means you are a pedo is still a weird stance, personally
*donuts
(she actually got tons of respect from her underlings because she's actually really good)
just some curse or something, not sure
she's still the older sister in the AU
||Current research indicates that between 31% and 57% of women have fantasies in which they are forced into sex against their will, and for 9% to 17% of women these are a frequent or favorite fantasy experience. ||
looking at some abstract... seems the amount of people with that kind of fantasies are definitely on the high end of the scale
so they are able to work through it
over their experience
it actually tend to let them feel more control
but I don't see ||rape|| ever get normalized, even if there's a lot work about it
to go on another kind of thing, for example, ||rape|| is a horrid thing. But some people get off from it- either as the victim, or as the culprit (||rape fantasies|| are a thing)
remember that pedophilia is a disorder, and that some people don't even like the fact they got off from that
because of what's done to them
an anime child legit won't get any harm
yes. as long as they don't go for real child. Or getting any real child stuff
like, what people like in fiction =/= what they like irl
people like illegal stuff done in fiction, and completely abhor it irl
which is what this "morality crusade" is so going on and on about
for me blurring the lines of what people like in fiction and what people do in reality and such doesn't feel right
like there's some things I feel like it's going from a fundamentally going at it on the wrong way
yeah, detox is the right word
I uh think, that you should uh..... maybe, take off from twitter and try to kind of... hm... how do I say it...
who follows you =/= what you do
for me I'm more focused pretty much on just fetish instead of the wider... things, because that's the part I have care for
I would say majority is yes
like of course I don't really want it to happen irl to me, but in fantasies? yeah?? it's not going to kill me to imagine those
They kbow it's bad, but since it's fiction it's fine to indulge
From this talk it's pretty much never depicts it
Like for example a few days ago with the ||rape fantasy part|| I talked about
The problem is when that very unconventional fetish is what it is about though?
While another from other nations will say it's shit
Like a story about multicast, of course someone from that kind of nation will say it pretty positively
I would say it depends on the aims?
Like, "yeah this imbalance where the victim cannot fight back is incredibly hot actually"
Not as the culprit
For me it's... Hrmm. This place feels a bit too open for me to say it, but it's more like, a fantasy for me, perhaps
everything can be analyzed, but does those people even aim for them to be analyzed is my question. Sometimes entertainment is entertainment.

Like, I would say people in general tend to have their own views. People won't get into some famous things, like for example, Game of Thrones and come out as "oh yeah, incest is all fine and dandy actually"
I feel it's kinda being, "I don't like it, and so it shouldn't exist" kind of feeling. I feel it's the same as those "I don't like gay in my fiction, and so there should be no gay in fiction"
I will never want people to have it happen to them
I hate it irl, like those things I like? I know I condemn them irl. I pretty much got so angry that I got scolded to look into them as much as I did a lot of times (since looking at them upset me at how it still happened and how the media/people treated them)
because then the assumption is that they want this to happen irl
okay then, so let me fall again to what of those people that thinks of being a victim of those kind of things?
like yeah, if someone _only_ collects nazi memoribilia there's something weird, but if the person collects _everything_ regardless?
(like, in one of my course, there's some that I picked up where it pretty much said, try to keep your employees happy... but that feels like never a priority in any company)
like right now learning about business administration in uni and it feels like... not real. "these are things that a good business should do"

and then feeling like 'does business irl even look at this???'
which, I'm not sure if it shows the university itself, or myself
(feels like I learn nothing from university when I finished my degree)
well the amount you pay for it feels like a scam, especially considering what I got out of it
I would say I got my CS degree while still being confused the hell out of computer science :^)
have been reading more paper because need to prepare for thesis next semester and it's like, "stop making your language is as stiff as it is, because I genuinely don't get what you are saying!"
honestly things should be explained in layman's term a lot. (I still don't get why academia need to be in such a high-brow language where everything reads obtusely)
money doesn't influence happiness, only when there's already a certain amount of it (aka people already have enough to pay their rent / food / transport / etc)
I just feel there's always a certain assumption done too much in these kind of things. It's far more likely a real life to affect fiction than the other way around

~~not gonna happen if the fossil fuel industries keep lobbying~~
it's actually pretty well made video
it's saying that instead of going vegan, the best is to push down less on wastage and explaining about the wasted crops (aka the crops that is inedible to humans) that is used to feed the animals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGG-A80Tl5g huh. This video is pretty good talk about the meat's emission. ~~in the end the true enemy is fossil fuel~~
imagine if research for med funding isn't tied to global pandemic
I'm happy for it, and yet also annoyed that it needs to be pandemic before research for cures get the funding
fuck investors :V

https://apnews.com/article/intellectual-property-coronavirus-pandemic-business-global-trade-health-c2f1ba1e6e150dc6c081b8eb6fe4f1e5
hm, true true
man can we attack fossil fuel industries first <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I do wonder on the amount of people for that...
like just more balance
granted I do think lowering meat consumption make sense
I see, I see <:thinkohya:346191855936995328>
<:thinkohya:346191855936995328>
although I personally think that food wastage is the higher problem still considering the amount of food waste happening everywhere <:notlikeishtar:775031340499861526>
I think it's counting only the US population, then use the world
(granted then where do the leftover crops go)
because does it count _if_ the cow has been killed
although the only part I'm questioning is honestly on the if the 1 year of vegan is less than 1% <:Thonk:310617895312818187>
like best to watch the video first? I feel like my explanation is going to be worse than that
which idk which humans gonna eat that
peanut peels
it's talking about the usage of like
uhh
although I do wonder what will happen if the city planning went towards more pedestrian / public transit
I don't think sentencing someone that has killed like, a lot of people to death is "stooping down to the same level" though
The only right answer is hindsight is 20/20
Hmm
The same argument happens for "what if they are innocent but oops they are dead now since that's the punishment"
Imo it's more inhumane to be constantly tortured I guess, even if it's a *slow* torture
Like I personally rather die than prolonged suffering of a few decades of isolation
How will you know the person will follow the forced labour
Because killing 1 for [however many] this person has caused, is certainly less bothersome too
(and suffering in complete isolation is even harder on sanity than death)
Rather than wasting money and food on them, I'd rather their death?

Why can't we have livable wage as minimum wage
<:NotLikeAlice:641390801804460043>
So I remember reading about some news of companies whining that workers aren't applying because unemployment wage is higher than their wage... Which makes me think of, why is there people still defending the companies in this matter? Afaik, unemployment wages are barely livable as it is (or even on poverty rates), so if it's even lower, why will people want to work there?

sleep well. Good luck on this lexi
you or whoever you'll be with won't be happy if one of you are forcing yourself
<a:pat:730998242883403838> that might be it. But at the same time... isn't it better to not be in a relationship, than forcing yourself to?
for whether you truly have feelings or not... I think the best way usually is to just go on as if there's nothing more for a while, wait and see how the love feelings go. Usually it'll settle down in time if it's not becoming stronger
there's nothing wrong to want to be happy
Like the main thing I think is to back off, if that's what they wish for, or accept that you'll probably be rejected if you do confess
nah you aren't being pathetic, but in my eyes, it's never wrong to end up loving / having a crush on someone, *even if they aren't looking for it*. It's what you do with that feeling that matters more

since I think this h0nde bot hits everything, has been seeing itin other servers I'm in too
the best I think is to get a bot from big servers that will ban an account from all servers the bot's in
I can' tput private on the server I'm in because the owner of the server isn't around and is sick <:notlikeishtar:775031340499861526> so I can't ask them if they want to shut down invites for now (especially since the server is being advertised everywhere and for their livelihood so it's really not my place to bop this)

well as far as I know for indo's police system it's shitty and no one really trusts it, especially us chinese peeps
also I think ACAB is also mainly focused on US stuff
https://medium.com/@OfcrACab/confessions-of-a-former-bastard-cop-bb14d17bc759 this is the one I kind of remember most of it from though
my opinion isn't on fully abolishing cops, but right now it's just too full on bad imo so I can see where it came from
like one cop complains upwards about fellow cops, and then the superior said that it's ok, it doesn't really matter kind of thing
I think the problem stems from uhh, iirc, that the good ones either go out, or in the end, follow the bad ones because the bad ones outnumber of the good ones

(this is from my vague memory of what I read of some stuff)
but at least that's better than just "yeah we investigated ourselves and yes, we are good and nothing's wrong"

I mean you can use Kanade and say it's kitsune without much a problem...
if it has more relevance to the Japanese myth for example, better use the name Kitsune, or if it leans more towards the chinese, then go with chinese name
my question is, will the character use that very legend? Like the story of the Chinese version, does the character use them? Will they have relevance? if not why not just use something like fox spirit?

The problem is buying legally has 30% price increase

I certainly try to vaguely have a bit of idea what is happening in Indonesia... Even if what I got is that it feels like Indonesia is spiraling down by lessening regulation on companies

hey if you have the money, you can make the charity to be bad
because giving them away will potentially lower the amount of people buying, and so lower the price to sell the same amount, so that's why they originally threw it away, or at least that's the reasons I remember reading
considering wiping out half of humanity probably will just lead to the companies making less, I don't think it'll solve world hunger because iirc a lot of companies already overproduced food, they just threw it away

from what I gather it's around

https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/16/22166064/star-wars-alien-novelization-disney-royalties-sfwa-alan-dean-foster
I wonder if Disney has paid the author for the star wars adaptation yet :V
https://denpapentateuch.blogspot.com/2021/08/essay-on-mechanism-of-moe-in-otaku.html oh yeah, a friend finished their paper about moe and otaku culture, and thought you guys might be interested to read it through as well since well, relevant to anime interest. (It's over here because there's some parts where it'll probably goes talking about the healing part, and while nsfw, isn't exactly the kind of talk I think talked about in <#336297808221044736> ? so I put it over here)
a part of me that is against for the living authors that is being a dick is... that by playing, you are also spreading their influence-ish? Like by playing it, it makes people "oh that one is being played" and so on and so forth, in some ways, that's why I'm a bit off on righteous piracy kind. Because that means people are still playing it, and there's soft power in there

But in the end it's all individual's choices anyway

```Abbott is among the Republican governors who have resisted public health mandates aimed at stemming the tide of the virus‚Äôs delta variant, which has caused a new spike in cases as the country attempts to reopen schools, restaurants and other businesses.

In a video posted on Twitter on Tuesday night, Abbott said that he has been vaccinated against the coronavirus ‚Äúand that may be one reason why I‚Äôm really not feeling any symptoms right now; I have no fever, no aches and pains, no other types of symptoms.‚Äù``` goddamn I'm reading these news about this texas gov and I swear what kind of thoughts are running on their head

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exodus_Cry seems to be the organization that's been pressuring MasterCard to change their policies btw
Yeah
Considering it's apparently from an organization that aims to abolish all porns
it's the mastercard and visa ruling
not the investment
this is apparently the reasoning
https://www.xbiz.com/news/258606/heres-what-the-new-mastercard-rules-mean-for-adult-sites-producers
banks, paypal, etc all of them cut off nsfw
that too, but mainly banks are the huge reason
it's the cycle of bloody banks controlling what is okay and not
https://twitter.com/PostCultRev/status/1428584131835748359 reading through this thread is also pretty good honestly
I can't really talk about how Only Fans's creator is bad, the problem is the whole thing is instigated by the bloody evangelical organizations pushing places like Mastercard to be craycray about things and that it just hurts more of the lower end of stuff. Honestly the problem is just that if payment processors refuses to accept AO stuff, then it's pretty much just killing the AO industry slowly but surely... or it'll just turn things to _only big companies_ and pretty much indies or amateur works are unable to do anything
Here's a thread about the hash thing
https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1428758281476927488
Also they say through image hashes?  This is incredibly easy to get through btw. Just saw another thread about image hash, and if thr image got 1px altered, even just color off by 1, the hash will be different immediately
And even then the manual reviews aren't working good enough considering the shit Youtube still does regularly, especially on indies
the problem is I doubt it'll really work, as I don't think technology is that good enough to be able to do this without mistakes, or low enough mistakes, or that apple can handle the mistakes
I honestly rather have stability than worrying how I'll live next month etc
also it's only on online games
Where punishing the few that took advantage of it is more important thannthe majority who needs it
Not anything else
It's meant to be punishing
They don't think it like that. I have talked, argued with some people and they think letting people do abortions means those people won't learn of consequences
I personally prefer taller guys (or just taller SO in general) but then again it's not a deal breaker or anything
you are free from consequences if you are big enough to get away from it
sorry for implying you aren't, yumi. I know you aren't, but- ah anyway, let's just drop it around there I guess. Trying to understand people against abortion is kinda tiring
guess it's true but... still. Feels limiting for no reason. I'm not good in explaining what I feel, I just feel that's a step to soothe people on the opposite side that I don't feel shouldn't need to. But... eh... ah whatever, I don't think you support it either, just yeah. I don't even know where I'm going with this
it's how some places are, yes
there's a lot of things that can go wrong even for this. It's torn. Not able to pay for the birth control. Etc. (Alright, this next example ain't america, but there's also places where wanting to get birth control can ends up with the doctor refusing it. I know in Indonesia the docs refused it unless there's a husband agreeing to it)
This is also thrown at me that time. If they don't want to have babies then don't have sex
Ugh

You pay money to get random virtual items
Yeah let me wonder how much EA got from.lootbox vs from sales <:CrispyDrunkNetzach:729769318530809937>
fuck capitalism
more like innovation to take money from your hands
what innovation <:heh:802218823842660412>
https://youtu.be/xNjI03CGkb4 this is also good video on those kind of thing
let me edit that
ah
I watch a bit of them until uhhh, I think I'm just tired of watching them I think
like those people pulling for FIFA I think
I just prefer it when they are free because at the very least they didn't ask you money before they demand even more money out of you in the bad way because lootboxes I'm pretty sure is also very bad in the amount
both are devious in different ways
in the end it's just hm
yeah
nah it's alright
upper ceiling of generous is definitely the type like cygames where they threw 300 pulls total for their 3rd anniversary for dragalia lost I think
that's not uh. Exactly generous
~~granted I don't much like power creep stuff because I'm more of meta type players~~
dokkan I actually hear it's not that generous and it actually got a lot of power creep?
makes it easier to not spend
I tend to stick to games that are more "generous" types now admittedly
ah yeah food fantasy
true
but nft games are also sucky in a lot of other ways including cryptobros
but in the end both are sucky
at least gacha is free to try
like the fuck, you pay to pay more
although I'm leaning more towards lootboxes being more unethical because they tend to be in already paid game
lootboxes and gacha are the same imo
NFT games are even worse and they aren't even fun <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796> gacha and lootboxes are also pretty bad too though yeah
Y doesn't have it
We are talking about the RGB and the remake series, which have slot machines in game
0 dlc and 0 way to buy extra money except by playing the game
Fire red and leaf green are like
Eh yearly release isn't bad
They can do that back in ps1-ps2 era
Done
Just don't put in the lootbox aspect
Easy to make it ethically
Yes those are bad too I'm just saying ubisoft shits are also shit
"yeah we made exp hard to get in game but if you buy the exp booster off our shop..."
Like exp shit
I also hate the thing with ubisoft where they sold you problem aolver for problem rhey made
The main problem imo is the extra payment
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>
consistent about giving the rating
man PEGI can't even be like
Lol
But pokemon's fake gambling isn't
Because it implies FIFA's gambling is fine
That's what I was getting to
Yes
Yes, but fake gambling isn't worse than FIFA's real gambling
It probably is I think?
https://twitter.com/PplsCityCouncil/status/1451641957445296130 on that one about the gun firing. W-why is there no gun safety after it had misfire incidents
People can have conflicts without being mean though?
Very informative thread
https://twitter.com/sl_huang/status/1451797888158375937 alright so this thread talks about the way it should be for a filming place do gun shoots
Yeah having life imprisonment is a good idea in this case
But that's why it works on majority and not on the rare cases
I would argue edge cases are edge cases @.@
I would vote for rehabilitation ala Scandinavian places
as far as I know, punishment didn't really deter people. Otherwise it would never continued
I know I'll never forgive my cousin no matter what he did
in the end it depends on the transgression and the friendship or relation
Sorry
Ah your words make me think no apologies is given
I think mel means like, not that there's no 2nd chances, but to get a sort of apology instead of the person making mistakes just combing back without saying anything and ignoring what had happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXyP-H80puQ this one?
which one
i'm too tired to exist, i don't need to see this
and i see that and i'm just
yeah they sent a vid with the thumbnail of ben shapiro's attack on transgenderism and pro abortion
(why does thesis need to exist ughhh)
ugh, a friend is sending ben shapiro's stuff and it's just rubbing me wrong. <:AngeSigh:787120893356802088> and i'm not in such a good situation where i can debate with good head because i'm back in my very stressed mode over thinking about master's thesis
but yeah that's why forgiveness is always... hard to pin down I guess
just something that had given me trauma for too many years
I can assure you it's not anything petty
well this is quite the thing that I would rather he doesn't exist near me
no idea, i'm not going to try to argue much because i know my current brain will definitely be too angery for too many things
I'll put it under spoilers because some phobicness
||so the part they agrees with shapiro is don't make man and woman gender as the same? that even if you don't feel you aren't male or female is up to you, but the reality is that both are different biologically. Anatomically and biologically they are built different, don't think of them the same, if you are thinking you are trans it's up to you, but better give trans their own place. Trans woman is not woman and Trans man is not a man||

https://twitter.com/MOOMANiBE/status/1455265391962251265 ugh, reading through this thread

yeah, like you put utensils on the side

*which is using different thing
*I mean outside of praying context
still wonder why do people even stab it up
deregulation is ok until it affects them negatively then it's ok to regulate
yeah but it's on another thing instead on on the games
<:notlikebolb:396525136645193738>
and there's also some artist who ends up doing NFT because better do it themselves than someone else stealing and doing it
doesn't help that there's some top artist there going NFT good
it's not, but it's the scam running on
protection from people stealing arts?
also I think there's also some rising NFT usage in JP artist because they are told that that's good for uhhh
yes that's dumb too
ergh
<:NotLikeAlice:641390801804460043>
like imagine games which is already complicated and then you add "yeah I have to add these... items... from other games... inside"
what about those... idk, stupid, NFT games going on? I don't even understand what they are aiming, with Square Enix wanting to join in with EA and ubisoft ugh
yes I wish people would realize that but unfortunately not

I still don't get why people are always so casually tipping off "yeah but at least you aren't furry" or anything like that like... ugh
what I remember off somethingawful is apparently it's where the talk/meme about how furry's bad is also from there
tbh if we can turn it so that to get more power it's best to make everyone more happy, maybe it won't be as bad? But I guess there's no way to
Like the fact crypto can crash from musk saying no he doesn't use it is... This is exactly a dystopian event, if that currency is irl thing to use
Also yeah I hear the carbon neutral corps said they have is actually them just paying and it really doesn't help
I mean as far as I know, I'm not a technological expert, my friends who are better in tech all agrees that crypto stuff while it might have usage in the past, has ended up becoming more of a scam than anything. It's poisoned well
~~also what about all those scam cryptos like those squidcoin that is just pump and dump~~
Is it phased out? I hear stuff like ethereum will change their way to less environmental damaging, but have they done it or is it just lipservice?
The money to buy all those electronics and to pay the electricity to run them
From what I see of cryptos, so far the ones who advantages are those whom has the money to mine- aka has the money to set up farms and those don't come cheap
or more
granted some people are in for the memes (that dogecoin), but some people are in from the beginning when btc are around jumping up? 2 years ago
they are in since the begining lol
no
I somehow doubt that the big rich people won't get into crypto. They have the money to survive stocks which can be pretty volatile. Why won't they get into crypto? They have the cushion to survive any hits from there
the eco narrative is felt more in the twitter than in publications tbh
these are the types of people who can just retire at age 30 and be comfortable
someone who already has a lot of houses and outright works in tech and pretty much doesn't need to work _ever_
holy shit I just saw this and this is so untrue from what I see. Some already rich people I know, turns to crypto when they see the possibilities and just turn themselves richer because they are able to take the major risk
I only unadd if things really go sour
it doesn't matter what it could have been used for, now it has turned into... this shitpile
but tbh while crypto could have been for the not wealthy back then, I would say it has changed now
if they only own one store but they get like 40k usd per month, that's should be high class level at minimum
I consider the amount of incomes to be honest
that's the only one I can think of
maybe landlord of one house can be middle class?
I didn't say that's all his assets is, but you know, the ownership of multiple houses I thought is obvious already
I don't see how this correlates to the fact people owning multiple houses are middle class
/s
it's ok houses are just cheap luxuries like phones iski
houses are what, a few hundred millions now?
as far as I know, middle class meaning is those who are definitely on comfortable amount of money, but they definitely still need to be frugal (and owning more than 1 houses especially in America is I'm pretty sure means you are high class at minimum)
wow that's a fucked up meaning of middle class
uh
or more idk how many he owns
having 8 houses is middle class?
who are in them quite a while
no I was talking about the rich people I know
I don't have problem with automation, I find it's a problem.because our society is capitalistic and demands we work in the increasingly small job amount I guess. It's not solving the job problem
because that feels more like you are pretending to be strong, than truly strong
(well, admitting it to friends)
honestly i feel it's weaker to not admit it when you need help
it's reasonable to not want to be tagged. I just don't get why people keep tagging, I in fact got scolded of not tagging because I felt bad about it (well yeah i know i should have tagged in that situation because sleep patterns in a public channel and so he won't end up finding my message, but i just got so used of turning off tagging...)

enjoying it doesn't make them bad person no, people can enjoy a lot of problematic content without agreeing to their existence irl and just want to let go in fiction.

The problem is that more of, if possible, do you really want to continue supporting problematic people? That's the core of it I would say

people are able to become farmer if they want to because it's a communal resource
from what I vaguely remember anyway
isn't communal farming makes more result as well and is overall better for the whole community?
I have seen a few suburbs in pekanbaru and they are just like, so not good. Houses are cramped next to one another anyway so it's the same
suburb just sprawwwwls so much
and prefer that than a huge house which feel empty anyway
I don't see much problem with apartments, but that might be because I got used of 5+ years of dorm-living and never got much problem

https://twitter.com/chadloder/status/1465831941157052416 fuxking hell this whole thread... Man sometimes it feels tiring
talking about meat and its effect on the emission, and it's like 50% milk/etc, and 50% meat
I remember the talk on how china is using their massively bigger economy to invest randomly in countries while taiwan uses their smaller amount of money to help better and it's still
taiwan barely manages to keep micronations to support them because taiwan invest them money, and yet china is still getting more support because people find china is better on their economy <:Yansive:906007926248976434>
<:narzacross:527554358343368706>
(I didn't even know foils will catch on fire in microwave until it suddenly does)
because most place here doesn't have microwave I never knew these kind of stuff
<:naruhodo:530610258822037504>
that looks incredibly dangerous
yeahhh
oh yeah that one about poaching egg in microwave
hope so <:HAhaa:621866800078127165>
I dunno
considering youtube won't do anything to the ones reported...
they got 0 repercussions
honestly the more I know sometimes the more I feel giving up I hate it
ugh
and yeah the facebook one is also
so I would say youtube doesn't seem like it'll do anything about it
ugh
also when reported about misleading content... youtube is like, "the thumbnail is cake and the content is cake it's fine"
(the thumbnail basically doesn't even exist in the video)
grooming content and stuff
but the story is like
I would say this one is kinda worse since the video is _all_ just cake making content
yeah that's really terrible
errrrgh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfcKCk6vPCE this is the video that covers it btw (it's good video, but it can be hyper distressing to hear some of the example videos so a content warning just in case)
what is that ü§î
holy shit. Watching this video telling about the... many, many bad videos, and then fb being ugh, super bad... is really lowering morale

the bad videos example is like, youtube allowing cake making content  (which is also content farm instead of true content), is filled with people making stories about some sort of grooming? or very distressing stuff like being held on gunpoint, or opening doors to stranger and they are someone who will save you from the bad life and such and holy shit hearing those are distressing
the last talk I had with my mandarin teacher here seems to be they'd rather be taiwan than republic of china and iirc the latest poll most of the youngsters want to be taiwanese
their economies are tied up too close to china to make offending them possible
and bigger country _won't_ do it
since one country one vote
well the thing is, the tiny countries can help because... with a few votes they can help taiwan recognized as real country
this is the video that talks about it iirc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GMoUmvw8kU
SUCKS
although man reading through ceo stuff makes me wonder why they are paid so high :V (also apparently dominos ceo is already below median)
```and reported total annual CEO compensation of US$6.3m for the year to January 2021. That's a notable increase of 15% on last year.``` well if they can give 6.3 million usd for the ceo....
otherwise, yes
I assume there's daycare at the workplace
I don't think you can go back home to nurse babies (since pretty sure your leave for pregnancy is only 1 month after birthing max and there's still a few months of nursing ü§î )
>don't be a dick to them
>considering how humans are to each other...
I think that thing is already impossible
I would say it has close relations though, as AI will probably use machine learning to learn
https://www.aiweirdness.com/when-algorithms-surprise-us-18-04-13/
I think there's some of those experiments on making AI trying to find the fastest way to move from point A to point B and it makes a lot of weird ways
rewatched it and it's still making as much sense as before, I like it. Computers unfortunately doesn't have that instinctive reaction in their brain unless it's defined ü§î
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PKx3kS7f4A btw this might be good one to watch cypher
they are megacorps precisely because they skimp on stuff
corps just don't care for people unless they are threatened enough with it
and that they are using those AIs and cameras to completely control the driver and keep cutting the driver's pay and such (and that the AI is not good enough anyway), so I don't see reasons why they won't fire people because they don't come during a tornado
can employees be blamed if they went to work if they know they'll get fired if they don't go
something along those lines
just that I was reading through the replies and it was like
"what, do you think businesses all should stop when there's a tornado warning? Every business will close for weeks at a time then lol"
ah yeah, in this chat yeah of course
you'll be surprised at how some people are saying "yeah these workers want to go to work, why are you blaming amazon?"
except for making things worse
in the end a lot of hullaballoo in politics are pretty effective because no one ends up doing anything üòî
but yeah it's just that the names are just poof now apparently or something idk. Do we even know everyone in the books
damn I don't even heard the other one
<@!379337518371307522> so it won't derail the channel, I'll talk more here

I think it kinda works since after his death, seems like it's not really talked about in official channels, and people also didn't really talk about it either beyond it's suspicious death. Or at least that's the vibe I got on the overall level
but just slowly growing bigger
so like, basic mistakes
(telling people to turn in their keys before their electronics or some such)
also lol apparently google has a very basic mistake that is only known by people who has been let off, but like, it's still a problem because it's people who has been let off that know about it
I don't think scammers care for ethics
it's an automatic thing I think, if it's not your own, it just tells the nearest iphone owner (if you are on android, tough luck, you don't know. There's an app by apple to help for this, but you have to manually scan for it)
feels pretty horrifying tbh
https://twitter.com/Sega__JEANAsis/status/1472198857639571461
no, but it's small and easily slipped to someone else's car/bag/etc
wait what the fuck, have you guys seen the talk about Apple's AirTracker thing... like if you don't have Apple it's pretty much let people able to stalk you as long as there's iphones around you, and it's live-tracking @_@
It's kinda the one with stranglehold on the kickstarter process itself
That will singlehandedly keep nft afloat
Also on NFT front the big problem is also how kickstarter is going to use NFT for its funsing
Good luck on the hospital and your mother, winglet <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
I thought for scanning you have to deliberately activate it
(i do have true wireless, I only use them at home)
I don't turn on bluetooth, I still use a wired one-sided earphone
android one exist, but not as seamless and manual scan... so yeah. Apparently someone else made auto-scan one but man, the BATTERY DRAIN
here's a nice thread talking about it
https://twitter.com/Lystrialle/status/1451941284264898575
kinda more of because japan is their own thing ish
no it doesn't work like intended
it works in the japanese sphere, especially with how some famous illustrators also said it's good :V
or at least the ones I saw
how it first started is iirc is how using this is good for artist, and that they can get a lot of money from their art
the problem is just not everyone has the money to go up to the litigation process
https://twitter.com/nfttheft/status/1471640210588852227?s=21 if anyone ever thought that NFT can still be used for artist :V
I know some peeps who managed to cash in during its height lol
no I'm not referring to dogecoin and elon musk /s

Sooo
There's no other choices
Well
(i also hate to download stuff for quick opinions)
Outside, needing people to download my stuff is annoying when I just need quick opinions
If there's something else like google that is comparable I would use it
Literally nothing else like it
(docs on phone is helpful when I randomly want to write extras in a story I already started)
Also allow user to just access wherever as long as they have internet?
I use them because it's pretty much singehandedly the easiest thing to use to share documents around?
Kill me
üò©
https://twitter.com/CloudyObsession/status/1471938807293489158 fucking heck. What the fuck google. Ugh. I hate the way internet is running incredibly fast to "prudes" level kind of situation

I'm so tired can someone change the timeline
Ugh
I guess I should download down my stuff every week or somesuch
Rip
Why is internet becoming increasingly prudish the more we go forward
So zzz
What are they talking about
Pretty sure blockchains also hate nsfw
Remember the toner or printer ink can stop putting out ink after certain dates even if there's still ink inside
Printers suck
I don't trust google editors just like I don't trust steam ones
Will annoy people quickly if I have them download my files üò©
I mean if you don't really share things around yeah it's easy, but with me who tend to need to ask for opinioms nearly everyday...
When can we sue amazon for gross negligence
Stuff like XC1 remaster and Spyro remaster are excellent
At least some good news for christmas for ukraine
Probably courts
honestly I don't think it even works
imagine having to think on nerfing cards from other TCGs because it's brought in
or gacha
uh... okay I'm not even sure where things are going but well I hope this means NFT is imploding even sooner (?)
so...
https://twitter.com/LeviSnoot/status/1475130734176346122
tbh the only thing interesting in this from what i see is just the thought of its possibility. It's fun to think of? okay, maybe? Idk, I never feel a need to but maybe that's because I stick forever to my single player games ~~other than gachas, to which my desire to bring things are merely the premium currency and not any other thing inside the game~~

But other than that, this is just a hell to think of on the design side, and probably also coding side and pretty much just not feasible :V
yeah because it's on game developer side to do all of those things of ensuring the code is compatible, having the set up and etc
you do know collabs in gacha is a fraught affair and also that there's a need to change it to fit the game? (also the aesthetic and skills differ)
imagine having to design for more stuff from another game while having your hands full already to design the game itself
yeah that's called auction house or somesuch in mmos
magic the gathering continues to have new cards
if the card is samey enough to be able to be brought to different card games, why isn't it just an extra to the game?
they redo their skillset and such because it's different games entirely
who have done the same design over and over
I mean even in the same publisher like cygames
should I point again the apple part lol
didn't another one word they prevented in the past is also suicide prevention?
this is more of apple though than tumblr
and the article itself isn't better
I remember reading their comments and it's very ü§¢ moments
Very eh site
I remember vaguely in the past that they are a kinda...
I'm not super sure either on sankaku complex as a source
She made great video essays that I enjoyed watching
That's terrible
Ugh
wasn't there some research that the start of covid is from europe or something or is that one a lie? I remember hearing that one a bit
Oooo good news (it's akso a thread)
https://twitter.com/PeterHotez/status/1475838044318183425?t=2YBKcZZq2T4Kr6vy49mSFg&s=19
Or carry them
There's also stuff where you pilot other people's account
The way I can see making money off playing games are streamimg content or edit your vids
the ones where it's sold to you so you make money
https://twitter.com/larsiusprime/status/1477337445637230592  also this is a good thread talking about those so called 'blockchain games' I guess
https://twitter.com/DigiEconomist/status/1477420461122375683 <:CrispyDrunkNetzach:729769318530809937> well taht's even worse than I thought (it's a short thread)
It's pretty much doujins
Even the original fans of the original isn't 100% will end up buying it
As someone who had read a lot of great fanfics too (which is better than the original) I don't really care either way. As long as they don't go and say it's canon or anything I don't really feel it matters? Not like everyone would buy it by the double virtue of it being a fanfic and needing to buy
For the hardness
Diamonds good for cutting though
Otherwise diamonds just look kinda eh compared to other gems tbh
I see it from, "look, that person doesn't take care of their body so much, why do they get access to healthcare" (same as the "look they don't take vaccine, why do we take care of them")
it doesn't sound like it stops anything, except for arresting more people probably
I really don't get curfews though
curfew is useless because of course it doesn't reduce spread, the disease spread WHENEVER it's not stopping because it's before 6pm or something
I'm in kinmen island and pretty much still 0 case of covid right now, but everyone still wears mask everywhere and such. AND we even got strict moments where 0 dine in allowed and such even though again, 0 case because taiwan's was increasing back then
tbh lockdowns work, places like taiwan manages to be on 'normal' level because their lockdowns worked. But some places don't really do proper lockdowns, or the people doesn't stay so it's like, EH. The lockdowns don't work because the people aren't staying
I'm glad
kellog's one succeeded
what the fuck
you guys reminded me of the record profit for blizzard and then they just laid off hundreds of people like
once more retail got the suckiest time :V
won't outside and everyone be separated-ish make it much less chance to happen? (and everyone wearing masks, which is how it is here but as far as I know some places don't have everyone wear masks...)
seems like it makes more problem then
imagine waiting in line then get curfew'd so  you don't get the food you need
those are effective enough without the curfews methinks
yea I mean like no dine in, people aren't allowed to be inside more than x amount, etc
if it's all closed the curfews aren't needed tho? <:rikohmmmmmmmmm:921660649745055794>
why not do no dine ins instead
yea but I thought no meeting large amount of people are already implemented
make sense
you can just landlord them from your parents' house
wtf mac
just have your parents house be given to you rad
both have to work
isn't that how it is in the current times
https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/stop-blaming-millennials-killing-economy/577408/ oh yeah I finally found out this exist
living with parents is the true meta /s
I mean considering these people are all those who I know for years and they have worked a long time in tech, and they all call it scam... üòÇ ;
there's also the fact people who I know worked in tech all are saying web3 now ends up as scams instead of truly web3, and NONE of them seem to be very hyped for it
how does it has no identity attached when the payment clearly come from someone, and it'll probably also comes down to a bank account later on
like this part is I think the part that makes me wonder, like, what does web3 add
https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/web3-fraud what about this talk ü§î
hmMm. The more it's talked about the more I feel, why not instead of having privacy, why not just have it be more transparent and we got a slice of pie instead. Google have to pay people they gathered data of and use to get money from :V
they aren't using it like that, it's more of me taking my conclusion from their behavior
I mean this sounds like something that can be turned to you as well? You are being the authority who keep saying that this is good thing, and that it *can* be used for good thing, even though the whole time right now it's not *used* for good thing
is pretty nuts

What I wonder if you buy his voice nft for example
it feels like those csgo knife packs but with even worse situation
but it won't because they get 30% profit
also that community market is something I wish would be closed
yeah the way it's set up now is kinda... ugh...

it's ok I never got psychology course
https://twitter.com/mcjulie/status/1498070513683468293 here's a thread that kinda breaks it down? Or at least it kinda makes sense in that
I remember seeing someone breaking it down... let me see if I can find it
although considering how some companies can be in removing some stuff, it's really questionable (granted this knowledge I got is on translator, not the... director as in matrix? but idk)

the one I know of is that some localization companies can be real asshole on translators by removing people who while have worked on the game, no longer worked in the company. Or just outright never putting their name in etc
Faster and easier
Iirc it also kinda goes downhill past few years as well?
Better resd through an article
https://www.npr.org/2017/07/26/539576135/fact-checking-website-snopes-is-fighting-to-stay-alive this is the vague memories I had
But on this matter iirc yes, altho I don't explain it clearly I suppose
Can't trust snopes anymore after they got bought off
Yeah that one's just wtf
Also kinda weird that they don't extend the license? Unless it takes very long time to get it back

if it's related to the other case I read below, there's one guy who got offered, if he apologizes the charges will be put away so maybe it's like that?

the fact it's not from the victim's pov kinda makes sense

especially with the writer not even being able to do basic research
the book is one of the worst book to be used as a 'standard' for holocaust so the backlash is understandable
what about those ones where you circle like 7 numbers and then the more numbers you get the same as the announced numbers you win [something] ü§î

Uhhh there's more talks on latter part of the tweet that might explain better?
Take vaccine, help reducing transmission as well. So the more people who can get vaccinated, well, vaccinated, the better
https://twitter.com/sailorrooscout/status/1513158242003791880?t=2FBAPZEm9zv8Gw6PaurKyg&s=19 a bit of better news thread
I really hate it when things really go this way sighs. So tiring to see really
*this is back when "computers" are more like those dots and holes thingy the SUPER old one
you remind me that when "programming" was mainly female job it's seen as bad and low paying and then when guys started coming in it suddenly becomes far more lucrative <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
I didn't know it helps lower transmission. Lowers infection and severity yes, transmission no
I blame mhy in that case

https://twitter.com/maxberger/status/1514592083474096128?t=tfuXswxrmkGGuBpeMTgQ3g&s=19 found a post listing a little bit of elon, which definitely shows the type fo guy he is and the danger of him owning twitter <:rikohmmmmmmmmm:921660649745055794>
isn't the more hypocrisy is more on how didn't they kinda kill the more lgbt friendly series they had even though they are pretty successful?
when criticisms are silenced, what do we call that then :V
Not sure what else other than free speecj to put these to tho
(and outside of that I also remember someone said how he retaliates hard by firing a guy who said there's safety problems)
Anyway the free speech in this matter is the problem of elon retaliating about union (so more union busting), on someone criticizing his car (because review)
Until you get judged anyway *looks at that rental case*

https://www.mediamatters.org/donald-trump/attack-twitter-right-shows-it-has-institutionalized-trumps-corrupt-use-government ugh üò© so some reps apparently sent threatening letters to twitter board to accept the takeover???
I still can't believe people love bill gates and saying he's good when he's one of the ones that stopped that one uni vaccine from being released for free <a:sleep:940639375648251934>
it's like, people said billionaires had no money, but then they always have money to do some ventures here or another somehow, someway, so it's like... maybe we have to stop these liquid assets thingy or whatever, I don't really know
I like that money is good in-between, but I hate the abstractiveness of money that happens from the high end of capitalism
I don't think it's good idea either, but I think the stocks and stuff makes money too abstract sometimes
Well I hope GDPR will work

The fact tesla need their own charging head annoys me <:blobpensive:591504491627544636>
Good <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
I can't wait for tesla stocks to fall down as well as other car companies go to electric cars
The only free speeches are always for the powerful and rich
Which I never heard the opposition to reps ever done anything against
Also did you guys forget the heavy gerry mandering done
As usual those would be ascribed to the "woke" crowd destroying everything tho
Considering how nothing's still happening to the 6 january thing it's kinda....
creativity and funding without needing it to be aimed to profit- because sometimes after it's researched it CAN be for profit but previously it won't :(
considering how bad elon treats his workers + how expensive tesla is and how bad the qc is, kinda eh ü§î
here's the article that talks intensively about this short termism and example on a company
https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/11/activist-investors/506330/
short termism is a thing that is happening :S
personally I feel the fact everything needs to MAKE A PROFIT NOW (or in like, a quarter? since there's a focus on quarterly profit) is what drives R&D even lower
I wish we can actually sue politicians if they lie in their promises
some conflict, yeah I can see that. But personally what I want to know, is more of, what kind of conflict do you think is needed I guess? Like yeah, in time of conflict our tech goes forward a lot especially on weapon side, but from what I'm seeing, sometimes it's because at times of conflict... they GET the funding? But otherwise they don't really get it, so it's kind of hmmm, on my side
because disagreement on small scale? I don't see those as conflict
I personally is on the scale of I don't think humans really need conflict to drive us forward, especially not the type of conflict that will be infringing others' human's rights, wars, etc, and a lot of other things that is still going on
in this case, you know you can actually say that, that you don't really know how best to articulate it so either wait for someone else, or just let it be? Instead of going angry about it
also seems like usa is backsliding very fast to third world country's type of rights
https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473 this is also decent summarizing probably
while the other side just... doesn't do anything except twiddling thumb and saying stuff like "oh shit it's bad!!!"
or like, 50-60%?
but when the conservatives seems to be able to do everything they want to <:Pepega:586019549669883915>
don't you love it that conservatives can do that while they are on backfoot and the supposedly on our side party doesn't do anything while they are on the advantage
https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1180506681459040256 whelp, guess this is forgotten I guess
oh wait people will stop wanting to destroy their life for the rich so I guess they don't want that
but if everyone get richer, the rich will get richer because people will spend
<:Pepega:586019549669883915>
south korea / ph / usa / uk /etc
I do have to wonder why is it that in recent years it feels like there's a lot of conservatism raising up like, in a lot of places
~~dems are just reps with better reputation~~
it feels very weird to watch backsliding to happen at 2022, but sometimes I feel like these people are just waiting
maybe, hopefully I guess. I don't have much hope, but... ugh... nothing to be done, I can only see it from my position
I see, so what I'm hearing is that there's no hope whatsoever
considering how much abortion rights have been eroded, the fact it's only now that they are revoking it, feels a bit too timely if we want to say it that way
ehhhhhhhhh, I feel like that's just an excuse from them to do so
the way they are wording they are supporting the revocation of abortion law in mississipi though :S
there's something I want to say when I read that but that might be too inflammatory (not to people here)
```‚ÄúThe inescapable conclusion is that a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation‚Äôs history and traditions,‚Äù Alito writes.``` ah yes
sometimes onion's titles become real so understandable
so I guess it works out for real
although then again iirc the aim was so "the tyranny of the masses didn't come true" or something like that
it still doesn't make sense to me at all
it's so bad
like you vote dems? if your area vote red just a little more your vote just becomes nothing
reminder there's a lot of gerry mandering and that a lot of US system is very against equal voting ü•¥ I look at it over and over and I still can't get why it's good
by now they should just say they are turning america into religious country
I bet they'll ignore the effect on the poor and only care for when it affects the rich
And sometimes not all dems agree so it's even worse
Except dems nevwr use it
Well china probably doesn't want to face the sudden america said you can't use american stuff but this time on pc maybe? Or at least that's what I:m getting
I do likw globalization and some advantage of it, but I also see how ripe it is for exploitation (that is still going on)
this way they can still poke windows and slowly build theirs
also preventing the case of huawei again I suppose
from the talks here it's mostly taiwanese instead of chinese. Chinese is mostly on the older generations, while taiwanese is VERY in the rise on the youth
yeah probably all of them
oh

I had legit seen takes where a woman said that Indonesia need to stop the whole give education to women part of the past (which was a LONG struggle back then <:NotLikeAlice:641390801804460043> ) so it's obv not just happening in a place
how do you agree on things that lower your own rights...
I still don't get how some women can support this, like, for guys ok, I can see how. But for the other side??? <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>

Election going on, the son of old dictator in PH runs again and for some reason, even though a lot of machines are broken, somehow the counting is keeping it crazy faster compared to the previous election
(some ph friends so I'm feeling the splash)
@_@
Ugh reading the PH news is giving me anxiety wven though I don't live in philippines
my guess is that it's until there's a cool new thing ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

mm, it's always good to find something to do, like studying some other things, making your own project and such
might be good to try focusing on studying more on that then? I mean not sure if it's applicable but back when I wasn't doing much, I went and study another language while writing a ton to see if I can change it to a sort of side income. (or do things like studying how to cook/bake is good... I got roped to help there a lot and it's always good to know how to cook)
you aren't doing something you find fun to study?
~~or have your soul destroyed over work because you know how it is, job destroys the soul~~

not killed, not shot, just got _hit_ with a bullet
https://twitter.com/senerisyt/status/1487905833811787776 I think a friend give an appropriate response with this
https://twitter.com/abdallah_fayyad/status/1524739030704922627 very amazing way of saying someone being shot
I just saw forbes article mentioning how a journalist got hit on the head by a bullet like... <:StareAway:842387187172769852>
but majority of news sites seems to be either like, very phobic or... you know, scrapes from other sites, or etc <:NotLikeAlice:641390801804460043>
reporters are pretty underpaid, and the investigative journalism even worse
some places are kinda... bleh on the news articles so it's a little bleh to pay for them
https://twitter.com/labuzamovies/status/1525248604524359680 you know, the more I see the more I feel worried about the future of some creative stuff <:NotLikeIfrit:794552011298570240>
https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1524409226721857536 oh wow, so that's why they are unveiling the diversity‚Ñ¢Ô∏è thing
yeah, a lot of stocks (and crypto!) are shrinking hard so money's tighter for people up there for their usual shenanigans
if they don't even know what they are talking about, can they stop CONTROLLING it. Oh wait no they just want to fucking control women
like is wishing for them to get a lot of very painful deaths are appropriate measure
I have seen tons of people who doesn't like irl kids while liking the loli looks <:Shrug:388950974817107968> as I said I don't agree on conflating images with irl stuff
i disagree on the conflation of pedophilia and lolicon (which this account from what I see also hates considering they don't want to interact with minors or MAP guys) <:A_HuTaoStareIntense:899444164570267648> 

also fuck any school who fire teachers who are gay too
I mean the guy so proudly say his tunnels is better than train or something
because afaik there's some who are still running and even doesn't get fired
honestly rather than lolicons i'd rather them focusing on the already known predators in politics (' - '
it's like isekai discussion, it's... the main sources
because lolis are specifically those 2D drawings?
loli drawings? yeah I really can't care about it
if they truly are owning CSEM and sharing those, yeah, go off, fuck them and throw them into jail
anime-type of human drawings are very different from the _realistic human drawing_
@_@... I see
h-how did that become slang for suicide
that's such an overreaction
i'm glad that my school is more middle-income level so there's no crazy bullying like my friend had in her school with the rich-kids, and also no... sex problem. Or at least none that becomes pregnancy <a:ablobsweats:548314784471449610>
why can't they just handle their own body arghhhh
Also you know I just realized the further hypocrisy of the right on this anti abortion stance. Like, they are sying my body my rights over vaccine, so why can't pregnant people be my body my rights over pregnancy?
Ok you two's answers make me laugh about this at least <:FrankaWheeze:851187727256387634>
considering this guy is saying that if women is distressed they can somehow cancel pregnancy... <:Pepega:586019549669883915>
the thought that you are the perfect person that knows everything or some sort I guess
he dialed back, but apparently after the reps backed off (back then, unfortuantely he'll be far more vindicated now considering what's happening) he apparently published a book where he's pretty much spouting the same thing
https://theweek.com/articles/472972/rape-cant-cause-pregnancy-brief-history-todd-akins-bogus-theory I can't believe this belief is held still
too many kids trying to do moral high ground while not really thinking there
Although can roe deer be as "tame" as those deers in nara?
Best pet is just virtual pet (or robot pet?) Where no matter what happens it's safe <:A_ThumbsupTao:793167286961438730>
like yeah, we can pay 10$ vaccines. But what about people who doesn't even have the wiggle room to get those?
I know the prices of vaccines can be prohibitive, even if the people around me are mostly middle-class and well, isn't hit as hard
ehhhhhhhh in this matter I feel it's good to not be grudgey as well ~lives~ but I guess grudges are more important to the countries than people's lives
I guess big pharma wins

It's weird I have to tell off some people to not use Indons when Indos are shorter and easier <:StareAway:842387187172769852>
I would go more on don't use the nicknames of the countries where it's truly used for insults?
idk why but I think of either the military commander type, or the ruthless businessman type
the problem is always that the ones without much wiggle room never really get much of a say üò© and even if they try to say so they just... get insulted, most of the time. Or told that they deserve those 'punishment'. Although maybe this is just me conflating too many things together

some people are crazy and it's best to not look at them too much
ah yes, such a prolife that they are voting to kill babies
so you get more workloads
have heard it happening at SG office spaces and stuff, I remember some people said that if they don't pretend to work (even though they have finished workload), boss will add extra
especially disliked how if you have finished your work the boss hurries and add to your job so you are actually incentivized to SLOW down üò©
not saying every job has to, but the jobs where employees have to sit down and be bored even though they have finished their job is bleh
wasn't there a test where it's shown that 4-day + shorter worktime is much better for efficiency and work rate but they still don't want to do it

I mean yeah but also that sweatshop is kinda incentivized I suppose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm7KUE1Kwts found it
kinda? Maybe? I remember watching a kinda short documentary on how western companies are now paying SEA companies (because cheap) for this and well, SEA companies got their job by bidding low + fast, so... kinda like that
too bad that some jobs are designed less to do that but more of grind people and take newcomers in (A LOT of things)
yes that's why bad boss/manager is really damaging
they don't pay enough tbh :^)

I mean I do have seen women saying that we should stop getting education like what the fuck
bruh
I feel it's even worse because she's saying thanks for limiting her own control over her body like wtf
still can't believe there's women with this belief
it's ok in indo where even getting birth control have the women be asked with ~where's your husband~, I got the same argument still
parents already can abuse kids they do want
??? I'd rather they just abort than have kids they don't want
already has to listen to people saying abortion is bad because otherwise people will keep doing free sex
I'm very meh on the whole limit on abortion overall, as there is barely any support for mothers 
*which I'm 100% sure is also going to be derisively said by a lot of people
Like why does it matter? If they don't want a child why should they have one? A child is living being
I really don't care it's frivolous reason, it's better they abort than they continue
Like literally using the pregnancy as punishment
Last time I had a huge argument about abortion, I had to listen to them saying that if abortion is legal then people will be too free to do sex to one another
A children shouldn't be used as a punishment for sex
Tbh I don't see why there needs to be a limit unless the country will help on everything from birth to the taking care of the child
I mean saying there's progress is kinda moot sometimes when it seems the government is doing hard to really go the other way (woman's rights are backsliding with the whole abortion thing, like in Texas they fricking have a phone support for reporting someone that might be doing abortion iirc)
wow looking down on the comments there's still people going "yeah and if there's no guns there will still be more deaths" <:NotLikeAlice:641390801804460043>

they come in, take only their kids and left again
oh wait no
honestly maybe, BUT, I still remember how the parents begged the law enforcement to come in and they refused to so it's like wow
unsure, but I'm not surprised if it's not only federal crime
<:NotLikeAlice:641390801804460043>
that if someone went to abortion clinic and the cops could just... get the data from google
https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/1532057374244360192 this is quite chilling to thought of
I mean even if you don't care doesn't doing this means you'll have harder time on taking what you need later on? Tbh it looks like things will topple... the only way I can think why this happens is that the packages don't come all at once so you can get the small item first then big item later üòÇ
is minimum wage going to raise üëÄ
the seasonal is probably why it pays high
literally sweatshops <:NotLikeAlice:641390801804460043>

I know delivery pays like pittance over here (Indo)
ah, seems at least warehouse pays well then
I'm not sure which is worse, warehouse or delivery because I have HEARD STORIES
ugh, the more I hear about it the worse it becomes
why the fuck is warehouse like this

https://twitter.com/tiredqueer510/status/1532873808528478209 reading this thread makes you really feel those pride flags they put up really mean nothing
Nono make them mine cobalts and those things
Or some techy companies ceo working in the mines üëº
Imagine forcing CEOs to do these warehouse job with those apps that stares at their time usage for 3 months
If only that's how it works
Ah yes employee working at home somehow makes them enslave employer

yeah it'll fall first <:StareAway:842387187172769852>
at least the gacha is being played tho
wasing money on gacha is the same as wasting money on on-sale games in steam that will never be played because they are busy playing [insert other games here] üôÇ
I really hope no one believes this is how it works <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
https://twitter.com/polevaultpower/status/1533263120788926464 if you want to read simpler thread about it <:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>

<:StareAway:842387187172769852>
also what the shit just happened in ohio
it doesn't matter that they are little if they have such huge power
and yet these little amount of people seemingly wield massive amount of power who is able to make the rules according to themselves
doing other things to calm yourself is good
through some talks, I do have seen cis people who enjoys the thought of being transformed into opposite gender but like, as through magical way and can be reverted back. So kinda like experiment?

Overall it seems to exist but of course, it's just separate thing from trans
if they think it works then there's something deeply wrong with their way of thinking as well <:Pepega:586019549669883915>
also really works because when people are anxious it's easy to be pushed to hate on the ~immigrants~
I personally feel that capitalism really doesn't work if it's not regulated super intensely
Hhhh
Why can't humans just work together
Ughhh
Not goingnto comment much on iraq, as what I know is mostly recent events especially the attack journalist situation
I do hear cuba's actually good and that most of its problem stem from US hating it doing socialism? Idk though
I feel on some stuff, the nationalizing thing China do is really good? ü§î like they apparently hit on those "education private lesson" thingy and turned it so it shouldn't be aimed for profit instead

also how they pretty much break up stuff like jack ma's stuff for example
it's fun!
the people with power just want to keep power and the easiest to do that is to destroy everything because who cares what happens after they die
Because CN love stuff is less obscene ?_? Like why the double standard between western film and this (just for example)
Looking around, it seems Mo Dao Zu Shi is one of those that is super famous in China too, and one of the best streaming in Tencent so there's no way the big gov didn't know
It's still weird that china do have stuff like gay tv series I think and a lot of gay series (mlm and wlw variety, although the one most people know probs is that one mlm one)
by now I don't think taiwan wants to combine back to china anyway
yeah, it's just centralized on the corporate <:HAhaa:621866800078127165>
Very fun situation
Heard from a friend that a gay couple got punishment over pda and it's apparently what, just sitting on lap
Lol SEA
not sure
(also there was apparently 2 days of civilian planes being grounded after 9/11?)
i'm pretty sure buying guns have less security than onboarding planes...
a republican is already saying how "after 9/11 we don't talk about banning planes" <:ExuStare:642065770527850512>
it can put you into beta testing without asking you
it can lock itself without anyway to open it, it just lock down its tires, it's pretty much sucky for charging because specialized (like apple)
it's more like what safety does tesla even have <:HAhaa:621866800078127165>
but safety??
<:Pepega:586019549669883915>
can we show those incidents of tesla to him
very expensive mistakes
bruh
fucking electric cars and all its subscription
is the car going to be good for the trade in
are you going to survive for the trade ins
like
I literally don't care considering how bad the safety is
<:NotLikeAlice:641390801804460043>
DO THEY HAVE DEATH WISH
AND THEY STILL WANT TESLA???
that they can outright die, or have the car outright malfunction by just NOT BEING ABLE TO BE MOVED FROM AN INTERSECTION  / ENTRANCE
<:Pepega:586019549669883915>
and so many safety reasons
like the fact things just get locked up
like there's so many dangers on tesla
why do they even want to get one??? what is the reason <:NotLikeAlice:641390801804460043>
hope people will stop buying tesla
Apparently those are Patriot Front (?)
Yeah I mostly talk about other series I get into as well as games now
<:Pepega:586019549669883915>
I love those city cars that's designed for urbans. Those models get bigger every year
if your phone app is doing half tesla did I'm pretty sure it's a malware
I probably will prefer that than slow death lol (granted dying from cancer from radiation also ain't fast)
I mean unless what is wanted is to just make them suffer I guess
which kinda what we don't want?
well the thing is, the problem with that, is that the russians who stayed there mostly flocked towards putin instead

~~remember MH movie with its isekai military~~
doesn't help that he got a cult going on in twitter
it's elon, not surprising
not sure how things got affected, but sometimes there is an effect I suppose
like that's a lot of my worry, what was once an affordable thing-- become expensive because of how it's used in another country
true, until you see nasi goreng (fried rice) being labeled as fried rice and suddenly rise in price like, 5x over original <:ZoomEyes:340489686285942796>
idk, to move to other type of food, I'm pretty sure you need to ensure you have all dietary concern meet aswell
over in indo tofu/tempe are pretty much staple food because of how CHEAP it is, (iirc it's turned into bourgeoise food there <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883> hoping this won't end up happening in indo because if it becomes expensive I fear for the protein intake) but anyway, tofu pretty sure is one of the meat substitute
(which is pretty important if you are going for vegetarian and stuff, since they have a lot of protein)
isn't stuff like tofu and tempe surprisingly expensive in western countries?
~~I would go so far as to say that a lot of problems plaguing humanity today is because of capitalism~~
what the fuck

medical freedom to deny medical to people of course
https://twitter.com/kromark/status/1536775573061632000 the one I'm hearing about <:NotLikeAlice:641390801804460043>
it really feels gross?
_just_ the very existence of trans people for example
I guess one example that is pointed by some comments I read is, uhhh, it depends on how's the joke is done I guess. LIke if the joke is like
~~although there's people who do pretend slurs as a joke~~
yeah that's why I end it with not alike
well I guess not alike
like it rankles me when a random person, not chinese or anything, call slurs upon chinese
especially if you aren't part of it
but kicking down certainly didn't give a good look
I'm not saying it got to always kick up
hmm

I'm pretty sure it's to make people laugh
https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1539237963523141633?t=PuUtXYDA_USHZPL-OMUj8Q&s=19
didn't cards that is used for mining is in pretty bad spot
like if we have 3 districts
A has like, 90 blue, 10 red
B has 45 blue, 55 red
C has 45 blue, 55 red

so in total we have 180 blue, 120 red

but in the case of USA, won't it still mean red wins
I'm not sure how that's 1 person 1 vote because at the event of losing at the 55% the blue pretty much just lost it
uhhhh, but when it's gerrymandered doesn't that makes the vote even more played? Like if you change it so that the blues are concentrated in few areas, (so those are 80-90%... then the rest has majority reds, and the end result is that it ends up with red)
since iirc it's picked by the president, and then last time there was that change of 3 judges last term
besides isn't scotus expressly different from the voting as well
well red is majorly worse so it's like, do you pick big conservative or moderate conservative
? isn't it like, the state is separated to districts, which is then have their own votings, and then depending on the majority of the result of the district, the whole state is then turned into that color (either red or blue because no 3rd party wins)
NO MORE STATE VOTE
~~when will we see an abolishion of gerrymandering and just goes 1 person 1 vote :V~~
besides it's not like red or blue matters because at the end reds will just continue gerrymandering that is still not fixed afaik
they are already planning to attack other stuff too so there's no hope lah
when fetus has more rights than you <:pepehands:744752920960172032>

v_v what am I even hoping for
<:heh:904986004212039691>
well as long as not voting for literally empty like harambe back then imo
to happen now
is there even possibility ike what happened back then
it's just nonetheless, you know
I don't remember
wait wasn't there some kind of victory a while ago
I guess nothing except pushing bipartisan stuff :V
https://twitter.com/discarddungeon/status/1540369546015637504 although I wonder if what happened like this thing can happen again ü§î

it's fun
while destroying indo's environment
so yes, fattening their own purses
then there's the ocean minister guy wanting to SELL OUR LOBSTER EGG???

LIKE INDONESIA FIXED THIS PROBLEM BACK IN THE 80s
and NOW WE GOT THAT DISEASE WE ERADICATED BACK
there's the importing cow and stuff from countries that haven't been signed to be free from those hooves and whatever disease
there was signing on destroying komodo island environment for "development" of foreign hotels iirc
(doesn't help that last fight it's either him, or a guy who keep going on protectionism and militarism so... bleh)
getting a few politicians who just decides to fatten up their purses, and I'm 100% sure the president is approving because he's on his 2nd term and it's pretty much his last term
so I can only hope other places can be
considering what happened in this term
I don't have a single hope for indonesia to become any better
I mean I'm not sure what else to be said, I already gave up in my own country already
we already know what's the poison in reds
like if you can go, 3rd party -> then if 3rd party lose it becomes whatever else? yeah, go nuts
my view is more of, there's not going to be enough to vote third party (because if you lost the vote, well... you just lost the vote, period), so rather than splitting already tenuous situation into 2 weak party and strengthening the major reds........
<:sadge:782586457730580530>
unfortunately some stuff are only put on twitter threads
https://twitter.com/AlexandraErin/status/1004400861865488384 apparently this is part of why some people can support some things they disagree <:NotLikeAlice:641390801804460043>
https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1540755940542119938 this thread seems pretty good outline of what the dems can do? (which they probably won't sadly?)
this is legal profession things
if you are working as a lawyer for the conservative side?
while the left side has more people so more competition
if you are conservative, you can find jobs easier because there's less people going there
no, more like
unfortunately job means it's time to become the right
~~capitalism rearing its ugly head once more~~
go be right to get job
Old abandoned buildings have certain feels to them
Maybe put it in a sort of gallery of sorts? I'm pretty interested
Not saying that's how it is now but pretty sure the past ones are... Real bad
Pretttttty sure the asylum of the past is less of a mental hospital and more of a jail for people. Really bad situation all around wheere you are pretty much dead the moment you are in
generally my thoughts are this, if to be born is to give the children not good life, why should they be born in the first place? :V
the price to be giving birth is also isn't small
but considering condition of orphanage...
I really wish if they insist for the woman to bear the children, they'll be ready to take care of the children if/when they don't wish for the child
sigh, looking at the abortion law is kinda sad
I still can't wrap my head around it
yeah, I can't believe people really want it to be banned like
3 months <a:raiseeyebrows:973767321355173908>
I hope it's reasonable and also give allowances for when miscarriage happen. Or those ectopic pregnancy...
no the thing is, by wondering whether it's murder or not is missing the point, first and foremost it's the woman's body
peoplee are allowed to not want to do abortion, they are allowed to forbid it from themselves. But it's that, INDIVIDUAL CHOICES. The main thing is to allow people the option
anyway, abortion is a matter of right over the body, and it's still super dumb that there's still places that banned it because the fetus is alive or something, ugh. >_> also kinda of avoiding the it's sitll the woman's body but anyway still
those seem to be good rules to live by
but still
I mean the basic thing is just, not murder, not being untruthful, not doing asusila things, not taking things you don't own, and not drinking/eating alcoholic stuff. Well a lot of them are appended with trying to not do these
I have deep belief of religion, but it's because I have looked and decided that what is there is something I can believe on
uh, did you forget the existence of religion
kinda seem to not be said anywhere
must admit that I didn't know the romani thing because well, probably because I didn't live there
people didn't see it like that, people see that people act up and so anything is justified <:HAhaa:621866800078127165>
on faces I can kinda understand where it comes from, but the hair cover too though <:grumble:849224390502776832> 

idk, I just have some muslim friends and it's kinda like... it is indeed their belief and desire to not let non family see it? ü§î so like... bleh
muslim is the only one, with covering the hair/face kind of thing, or at least I don't remember much of anyone else having big ones
buddhism doesn't really have one
christians at most generally is crosses, which can be hidden very easily
that's the intent, but as we all know that not all religions show their symbols
just some examples I remember talking about with an european friend
like the thing about not wearing symbols of religion in workplaces, and we know that christian don't really have that (or like, not obvious things), so while on the surface it looks like it's equal, it hits some religions harder than the others
tbh I would say it's more of... religion problem
yeah
sometimes people need to have more rules for more freedom
well on racist stuff there's definitely problems on europe especially on muslim stuff, the others though is... so weird

man if people really follow what they preach, things would have been better becauses most religions I know advocate being good <:HAhaa:621866800078127165>

It's nypost their headline is always terrible
many stories
it's explained on the 2nd paragraph, some stories seem to go with it's someone transformed into a boar-demon thing, or maybe there's a boar-demon thing already etc, etc
while not sure if it's the same as in brunei or not, it's mostly stuff like... hmmmm, maybe one of the good example is maybe something like voodoo? ehhh, kinda different than what is here though. Hmmm, wait, babi ngepet is good example

there's quite some stories where this boar-demon-thingy can steal other people's money and so you can become rich through it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it fulfills the mental high
wdym nothing, it fulfills the satisfaction that you controlled these people and so they die. Or not die. Or whatever
(if they do, they'll also look at ensuring mothers don't need to pay for ensuring the babies survive, giving money about it, and also caring for orphanages)
it's not about keeping babies alive :V
because they want control
and let's see where that goes with the witch lynching :V
it's pretty much a thing to get rich quick
it's different than the west stuff
Wow I just realized these nft ganes are pretty nuch like those company-based money thry give out as wage in the past

NFT games generally is those boring games where you have to do a thing over and over to get money
welcome to the content farm <:HAhaa:621866800078127165> (has long happened in the cooking videos)
yeah I mean I kinda don't agree with capitalism either, but then again I don't think that will ever be changed unless there's a huge jolt from the outside
anyway in the end it's not like UN will do anything to solve it I suppose, the higher ups want people to stay hungry for capitalism :V hungry people = desperate = easier to get money from
(counting it on 8 hour workday, it's around 37.5 usd/hour? Which I think is the living wage for places like cali apparently)
300 usd is enough for a month of living, and a middle upper in usa probably can get that in a day of work
we are being paid like peanuts for hourly wage
I'm someone from 3rd world,  you know?

the most I remember of him is the push for more women at workforce that works... on surface level (aka they do get more work, but in term of the more fraught type of work where it's mostly part time and stuff and doesn't really get protection, but hey, it looks like it works!)
I still can't believe some people are libertarians
granted these are more of libertarians than right wingers, I think
I mean I'm pretty sure there's some politicians who want people to stop wearing helmets...
they'll just say you made up the whole thing :V
Maybe

It probably won't happen if I go faster because I'm afraid

Nah it's only on cars
The microsleeps happen without me wishing for it
Depends on where you live, I stayed in slow lane
I drove at <30-40 km/h to note :v
I'm always anxious on a car but I'm also easily *so bored* I can end up doing microsleeps
unless car becomes super tiny does it really matter

yes, and that doesn't change the history of the company
I had gotten adware once and that thing is shitty to clean up
I still don't trust them
eh

then finally 1 august back in indo
then I'll be in singapore for a few days

ye it's ok the news cleared it up
so what I caught off your words were:
the texas politican is for the abortion (as long as it's for medical care) and they were fighting against biden for that

which is ???
yes I connected the for trying to make sure the girls can get abortion with the texas politican
and only after the news it's clear what you meant
yes, I was saying I gathered the opposite off your words
from what I gather off your words, I was thinking you were saying that the Texas people were suing Biden for banning emergency abortion (especially for medical care)
ahh, I think your words were being uhhh, the opposite of what you want it to mean
that the left keep... perpetuating hoax
they are calling it a hoax
but you know that's not what those people think
you know that's true
or something
because scotus went and said nO aBoRtIoN iSn'T iN tHe CoNsTiTuTiOn
I'm not sure what Biden is in this matter because the ones deciding it now is literally the states
but yeah I really don't get why there's a need to both sides-ing on some things

yeah, that's very real
tfw I only know mrt is only at jakarta at indonesia and I'm sure it'll still be filled even at middle of the night because nightlife is a lot
~~I mean I don't see trains running at the villages~~
although considering there's people working the graveyard shift...
so maybe can run 24/7 during weekend
a lot of teens and young adults probably also want to stay out longer
I mean I'm pretty sure it's not just rady

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCdwm2vo09I btw just watched this and it's really good video about how this image isn't really good to be used in journals anymore, and then also about a deep look in the history of computer science and stuff
like holy fuck triple lane
that's _huge_
hm
you know I wonder if electric tram is still used ü§î
honestly wish mrt and stuff run longer in places like singapore though, my plane will arrive at 9pm and it closes at midnight <:sadi:964985937933242410> (well should be safe)
the englithened strategy of centrist where you are supposed to both sides-ing and end up helping the far right
helping republicans?
... why is democrats supposed to exist again?
ah yes, the enlightened strategy of helping the enemy
like i' not doing it but people do also enjoy mingling with other hotel people at downstairs
it's not being separated, it's more like, you know, different aiming? a bit like gaybar I can think of
well, this way it probably is meant that you won't meet people that would be against you? some sort like that?
But I'm.pretty sure the D group keep trying to appeal to R
Some people said there's russian thing going on but idfk and either way, it's still dumb to pay money for your enemy either way imo
why not boost themselves to be so strong that they are more likely to be picked???
i guess it's true that democrats is just centrist who just wants to bow to reps :V
???
why can't they boost themselves
why the fuck do dems even exist?

What private sector does has no bearing on what indo gov does
Sigh
I hope the ninister will be changed and (a lot of other things)
Yeah itcs indo what do you expect
Here's the list

I think so, but that's still kind of a balm to the problem
Fuck indo gov
Yes
No fee, but if they ask for info or data you give to the government ehich probably is worse because indo gov leaks data like a sieve

When I'm at Kinmen I saw soldiers kek
The biggest presence I saw generally is more on the offshore islands, but iirc fhey also have mandatory military for a few years
I'm not saying it has to happen now or anything, just saying these because you know, it's weird to have some of these differences that seems outright thought as normal and equal when it's not and it just follows the old values again :v
I'm more of seeing the desire to keep paternity leave different seems to be the assumption that mothers naturally need to stay at home longer etc, it's the same thoughts
Also giving more connection between father and child
Yes, are you thinking that taking care of newborns are easy alone...
It's more of I'm thinking, why shouldn't it be the same? Shouldn'f both parents be there for the baby
Should have it be the same, because why not <:MikoThink:939313761783795722>
I discussed it elsewhere and got on the answer that, it should be expanded to give pregnancy leave to fathers as well
Yeah... I was just thinking, I don't know the answer but I know that thought is wrong
Yes, but also kinda more of, I just remember that someone argues that because women can get more leaves ( like pregnanxy and stuff) it's normal for rheir pay ro be lower and it's like... Kinda ugh
Wishing for life to be better but it probably will never be

Reminder that these companies also like to attack libraries and stuff, so having one becoming bigger and getting more influence isn't anything good, really
But that doesn't mean having the companies who sell them merging is anything remotely good
Like yes there's a lot of great stories on scribblehub or royalroad and there's people who support them
Nah, having big names behind you are still good
Which means even less manuscripts being bought
Yes...? The bigger problem is the merger
Or to be more exact, more of the same mainstream books
Less choices of publishing companies just generally means even less books being printed out
Even without that, a huge merger of that kind is still bad
Using 3rd world country as low wage is so normal by now lol. A lot of games and stuff also did it
I would say there's better chances if you throw your manuscript online and make your own audience than publishing it, but that's still hell on its own

both are at wrong, and I wasn't saying that the whole abortion being illegalized is wrong
no, but they can be criticized for it?
I mean they can change things up to do encryption so that they can't really check things, you know, like a lot of any other chat apps
while some of the blame is still on the abortion being banned (pro-life continues to kill lifes), it's not like tech companies are like, super wonderful in everything that they are always willing to follow the laws?
I mean they could refuse like how telegram refused to open their chatlogs to russian government :V

So uh not sure where you are going eith this

The important part of the news I assume

This feels illegal
https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1557112495889956864 also wtf
Also that some important stuff is only made because they aren't forced to make profit immediately
(iirc AWS funds their other parts to undercut groceries)
They made a lot, and that's why they can undercut other businesses
Amazon doesn't make profit because any profit they made is sent to investment of other things
yep, the fact that companies are encouraged to only look at a semester of time at a time is stupid
short-termism is a huge cancer in the capitalism industry
https://twitter.com/travis_view/status/1557853406055636992 not sure if this is related?
I mean it's a bit of, they are saying that the FBI and DoJ is corrupt and can't be believed now...
(iirc america had the best public transport system until car lobbies happen)
(also I hate how cities tend to be build with cars in mind <:argh:992693965939814520> )
I wonder why did cars win so much back then ü•≤ like why do people even like to drive, all it does is being like a death metal trap moving in high speed

alright got more new news from 'Indonesia government dun goofed aka being stupid again'

so indo government cut out the signature part in the passport in recent years for SOME REASON

and now people with new passport is unable to go to germany (and probably also on other schengen visa area)
current times cuba do have a lot of problems of being sanctioned by US no?
ahh
didn't a lot of cuba problem stems from US keep sanctioning them because they are being socialist? ü§î and that there is actually pretty good? well honestly idk how much is this manufactured or not though
foreign exploitation is bigger in more recent years, but it's still a HUGE factor on how bigger countries kept their economy high

-> their own country has high wage
-> so time to hire people from other countries to do same thing, only now they can force them to do things that is illegal in their own countries because it's international business
-> hire people for cheap too
although then again that's something done by majority of west countries
~~guess how did US become economic power though, does exploiting lower wage countries sound familiar~~
Indo immigration department said they get rid of the signature column for *efficiency*

The amount of money spent to pay union bust probably can pay the unionized wage for quite a time
Amazon is stingy af

But as usual of short termism of wishing profit to go higher every semester it's problematic
So the stock owners became happy

Also the outsource everything works in short term because well, it *is* cheaper
(and then have problems in a few years because no one knows how to navigate the code)
"outsource everything!! It's cheaper than paying these programmers"
Iirc that shuffle to the future problems are why there's so many managers like
That's problem for future managers <:KappaNitori:430233776493166592>

I'm legit confused because I also just got another update which I did but... Nothing changed ?_?
Confused
My emotes stayed the same too
Oh just got an update... Well i continue ro mot see anything different
and I'm on beta version :?
I... don't get any updates on discord though?
like, I think I remember reading of a post about people who is like "if gay marriage is legal, everyone will want to marry women so that's why it's not, isn't that normal" (said by a woman)
a lot of people don't realize their own sexuality, so when people get to know something, they get awakened to it, and that's probably what people think of "promoting"
that is looking at this too positively I feel? Like the fact they specify marriage as man and woman only seems to show what they really think about
it's like tiny step forward then massive leap backwards
like pretty much all the important things are all gone now, impossible
aka they get rid of a useless thing (because no one ever got criminalized over it I hear), _to completely codify something else_
did you read what they are doing after decriminalizing it, aka enshrining constitution to het marriage only
Or if you use ctrl+f, you only get the history from them in the channel you did that ctrl+f from

Brave is just hearing about crypto and stuff so yea <:MikoThink:939313761783795722>

but overall I just view it's better to be aborted than to be hated by parents
some places don't
isn't the thing is with christianity is that they are more focused on the future life (because eternal heaven or something), so yea
Neat, probably good to start moving then
Ah üëÄ kinda need something along those lines since I separate to around 3-4 profiles with different use (casual / work / vtuber / writing) so it'll be best if I can log in to same site with different mails xD

https://twitter.com/ShingetsuNews/status/1561476139843219457?t=6Arp4Qb1cUF6JPHfdDit0Q&s=19
Yeah I know these stuff but does firefox actually has like, those different session depending on profiles like chrome though
Even if you have, I think the toll of bumming off them will feel really bad anyway (source: me)
Might be good to ask what they know then?
Like I'm being supported still by my family (and this is all because my dad is still working! Don't think there'll be pensions too so mmph), and being jobless without even knowing if there's some sort of safety net is really killing me
Yeah I know, but at the very least it does mean that at least you can spend time learning instead of thinking "ok where's my next food coming from?"
You are pretty much only able to live with your family's generosity
Highest minimal wage here is 300$ and then there's no social security if you are like, got something that makes you unable to work
Also the fact there's social security stuff in usa is still good tbh
Although on healthcare I would say US probably isn't good to be think of as average since the whole thing is private + geared to insurance only isn't it
Don't need to be so mad
Yes I'm just saying I'm surprised?
That seems good to get some skills that hopefully can be turned to high paying jobs
Iirc we still import rice instead of trying to able to export rice
Pretty sure a lot because government thinks that importing already made stuff while exporting the raws is smart ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
Restaurant prices are the same as US now tbh üò©
You probably can also buy it yourself and then ask them to build it for you with like 20$ or somesuch
Prices same with if you buy them individually
Nope
I'm not in usa
Over here
Any pc store tbh
Because stores offer it for free
Yeah i know, was more of referring I can√ßt believe someone got paid hundreds in that
Damn over here the pc store build it for you for free as long as you order parts from them (and their prices are competitive too) xD

(you know, after the thing about blocking paypal and etc)
well the indo people I know don't even have that latter part, just outright hatred on chinese üôÇ !!

I think when people find out that part of the communication department was chinese, there's immediate a lot of comments going on about the chinese descendant and etc
idk, but that doesn't mean it's right
idk there's too many confusion <:toot:550693171479445504>

Since soekarno is the dude who wants to be neutral between us and russia

like even in western animation you can see how it goes
it's pretty close, but even in the animation industry itself it's very <:dogedepression:806230248328527922>
graphics is pretty low, then you got the design which is even lower
this video is pretty good in explaining what I'm meaning right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm7KUE1Kwts
very bleh
which is, while the fault of the company also lies at the local company offering low pay + unrealistic expectation, the fact the international company with more than enough power, decides to just accept it, and even advertise and continue to push the same pressures is
note I do am looking a lot at the graphics industry as well
a bit hard to accept that when the whole system is designed to be pressured and shuffled off the pressure to elsewhere :V
? is the business idea a scam <:kekw:826154314136682497>

Like I don't care for anything to be censored because when one gets censored it almost always starts to go slippery slope
Kinda what I mean on my 2nd post, they are just using diversity as their uhh boogeyman I suppose? The cause
but these are just them being boogeyman

there was some hullaballoo about pixiv some weeks or months ago on one of the employees sexually harassing someone else
like literally just need to see the japanese doctor university refusing to accept more female students even though they scored higher in exams
people who thinks that without diversity people with talent will be picked is probably one of those who get picked through other ways lol
HA
there's some groups who hate diversity completely thinking that just by through merits people of course will pick the best
westerners allergic to the words diversity by now because of being hatepilled
(even though these are literally corporate speak because iirc they still keep the sexual harassment manager...)

And then they refused after that
Majority of host already refused kiwifarm or accept a bit then kiwifarm becomes deadly
And that they say they are all for free speech and thatcs why they keep kiwifarm up?
Because cloudflare is the hoster?
I mean they sound like they are just throwing the blame off
LGBTQIA+ is adult content pretty much :v
The link on that tweet is towards how cloudflare explained why they block those sites

I suppose considering it nearly happens in ao3...
I don't see a reason why less harassment in the employee space would lead to a censorship
Doubtful honestly since this looks to be more of employee side
In the end for now it's empty words
I'll believe it when I see they have fired the guy
Why would they censor anything on their site
If they won't do anything to an employee who is sexually harassing someone else
Literally empty words
Well thing is there's nothinf about that cypher considering they are doing nothing with the sexual harassment :v
(which is still corporate speak because they didn't fire the sexual harrassing guy)
No sexual harassment is apparently woke <:shrug:582298635622940685>

If people want to sell sex, there's nothing wrong with it? If they don't want to then yes it's horrendous, but capitalism be capitalism, i would say even outside of works there'll be people who is freer with sex

this is SEA, paying below minimum wage is already existing
nah, just literal those contract with freelancers where you work with them 3 years and then just kill it
and my mom is saying that employees of course need to care for the company's too
reminds me of how I argued with my mom over job though, she was saying that people now are lazy employees while we are talking how companies now mostly prefer contract instead of truly hiring (and so, they won't be pushed to have to do insurance, pension and stuff)

and I'm disagreeing over it, like, companies don't really care, so why should people care-- just do what they need to do and clock out at the hour üòÇ

(indonesia but still)
I still remember that one woman who said women don't need education??
Like why
I still don't get why women supports male power or patriarchy so hard when it's obvious it'll cut back on women's rights
they won't because then the other 4 countries will probably find that their right to veto be scrutinized :V
<:TiredTalulah:688526708093354067>
I don't trust patriarchy to do right by me eeee
They could just let other people be on top no need to drag your whole gender to it
They could be on bottom it's up to them
Their rep is literally useless and "never call the police unless you have money or clout or know bigshot in the government"
They already have that
Surround them, drag people out when they can
Honestly this one sound spretty fine though
It's just better than making people panic
It's not the best yes
Not making things worse is at least, a better one
As I said, they won't help the poors since even helping people with stolen bike still led to them asking for money first
That's it
They are useless unless you are rich, or famous
And it doesn't add malicious intent to it
So it doesn't change
They already have useless rep anyway
Well
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I just don't trust them to not just actually want to hurt people
Tear gas is still definitely the wrong one
Doing nothing is at least won't make people suddenly trample everyone else
It's not riot, it's more of a brawl
But still teargases are still very useless in the situation unless what you want is to induce panic and also hurt them massively (tear gas iirc is massive irritant that isn't even easy to clear)
Anything straight to the area is dumb imo :v
Not a straight blast to the area
A shower of cold water?
It is not, but a tear gas in a middle of a brawl is definitely panic inducing. It's something more akin to an escalation instead of the deescalation one should go for

(I mean I'm not surprised indonesian police is incompetent af, they literally are mostly pos who just want money for everything. I still remember many accounts of people who got their motor robbed or something of high value and the police just like, shrug and ask for money before they'll move their ass)

I still count it all as thief, doesn't matter if it's leaked or not
It could have been added though, pretty easily at that. So many big site editing stuff adds in watermark when you use them
If the techbros themselves wanted, they could think about the possible harm, but no
The problem isn't tool, but how the fact the tech is forced upon people without any sort of consideration
But he didn't
*also*, do want to note that the dude could have added stuff like the generator putting AI watermark at the end to make it obvious
Without asking for their permission at all
Especially on the whole, using other artists as the main training
That would be cool indeed, if this sort of thing isn't more or less aimed that way (also, again, I'm still focusing more on the ethics side of it)

Cohost is tiny
Since a lot of big instances block pawoo which japanese ones tend to use
Mastodon sucks if you want to follow both anglosphere and japanese sphere
Mastodon and cohost (or back to tumblr) seems to be the one people going to

Yeah I guess but hmm... Do usa and these other countries that like to fund government toppling also do it to countries that got hit with military overthrow like what happened with myanmar rn
Like if they are so bad they should die on their own
If communism is so bad why does USA continuously fund regimes to topple it and also does sanctions on nations with those
üòî i won't deny that rn a lot of problem also stems from local politicians who just want to fatten their purse (for former colonized countries)

But man, sometimes I wish countries that colonized others would at least set things up to be better in the colonies instead of just sucking the resources out ~~and still going on now because raw exporting, imported to developed countries, then resell it for higher prices in the countries that sell the raws haha~~
I want to know what would have happened if europe never colonialized other countries
Isn't cuba's problems mostly stem from usa continuing to fuck with them economically

It's like saying local store owner are the same as richness as tobacco company owner
Wage?
Then how will I eat
Also there's difference of rich-rich and the uber-rich
No you don't
Some rich I can see, but like rhe super rich doesn't need to exist
There don't need to be billionaires
Wut
They *have a lot of job openings*

Money
There's huge palm oil industry here, ppl work there why? Wage

The billionaires are the enemy tbh
And I was saying that there's something wrong with the billionaires not just normal rich :v
Exploitation doesn't need to exist, just that because exploitation exist, those people who get ahead with exploitation got ahead so hard that they dictated everything
Also while full equality can't exist, again, I want to say that rich people can exist and is normal imo, but *full super rich where people literally can throw hundreds of millions of dollars without impact at all to themselves* are pretty much on different level
Also don't forget the exploitation of 3rd world countries by first world

glass ceilings imo still happen even in western countries though, where because a lot of women got accepted to lower rungs, it's thought as solved :V
that's a little hard when you consider stuff like glass ceiling happening. Or when some issues like deliberate kneecapping (like the tokyo university cutting women's exam scores down because they don't want to accept too many women))
not saying men can't do that, but yeah, kinda like that :V
or point at the failings and say that "see it's no good"
like if majority of soldiers are men, I don't expect women to be majority on top either, it's the same thing <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
honestly it's more of, "if 90% of people in the industry is women, why are the majority on top... is men?" something like that
men should just make better fashions for men instead of sticking to suits only /s
you know that's legit what I was given on why victoria's secret should be run by men <:StareAway:842387187172769852>
just pointing that I still feel it's weird to have 90% men at the top when it's 90% women that goes into the industry but what do I know (kinda paraphrasing) <:haha:1038747513462738954>
yeah it's not clear, but these are examples that I'm just remembering and I talked about before ~~and had people saying I"m looking too far into it~~
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/fashion/glass-runway-no-female-ceos.html
https://fashionista.com/2017/06/gender-inequality-fashion-industry
also if we don't want to look too far, fashion is kinda example where it's... weird that men has the most power?

most big fashions are for women (not saying men's don't exist, but even fashions catering for women, tend to have men at top), like there's a lot of women in fashion, but they tend to not rise high, so they are given the low jobs
there's reasons why glass ceiling exist
considering terfs are misandrist already and pretty much against the original point it's kinda lol
some people are just like that, they already dislike feminist's points so they used the obviously wrong points to discredit <:FiaSigh:816082775663706144>
and yet we keep getting told to be peaceful while the far right continues to spiral worse. Although then again I'm not the one with blood with my hand so I also don't want to say people should go down to violence ü•π it just sucks

Tbh i think he's saying that so to pretend far right isn't like that
I think there's difference between us learning and inspiration versus AI art but I have no idea how to say it beyond "i feel like those have false equivalencies"
wondering how much wage theft has been done by the big companies...
stealing is stealing, although if we are really casting the widest net ever
yes I feel like it's very much feel on this because on smaller creator

like here, for a creator whose income is like, 200$ a month, one piracy can equate to like, 1/20th of their income a month

VERSUS

a big company whose income can be counted in billions, one piracy equate to what? one tiny thing?
but it's whatever, if you want to say AI art is okay and all good that's fine too I just don't agree
I see there's a difference of pirating a small creator versus pirating like, disney for example
(also difference of personal usage and commercial always happens)
you can input your own drawing
you can program it, doesn't mean you can just use it without asking?
don't feed what others have worked without asking them
if you want your own AI writing your stories, feed your own stories and stories you have ASKED PERMISSION TO
if you are so insistent on AI art, why not feed your own art instead
I'm not saying it's evil, as I keep saying the problem is how it's done
I kinda eh on that
beforehand machine learning with arts always asked first
do they ask any of the artist if it's fine?
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
they never asked
my problem is again
especially considering it's entertainment
the end result doesn't matter if the way to get it is vile
so
is the AI itself wrong? no, but the humans use the AI to do these
it's never "okay we'll ask ALL the artist or writer or whatever", it's always "ok, we'll just... scrape it"
isn't
I'm saying the _ethic_ around it
I'm not saying the tech is evil
https://the-decoder.com/patient-images-in-laion-datasets-are-only-a-sample-of-a-larger-issue/ this is the one about medical
why would they do it from random artist
also considering AI tools isn't going to try taking off medical data from their database
my problem from AI art once again stems from (the problem of the ethics, aka the sourcing), it's kinda the same as that fuckin new writing AI thingy, scraping from AO3
Example: the higher ups in disco elysium developer fire the original writer team to hire ones from usa / uk
Businessmen are often deaf to other people's thoughts

If they are emulating cn can they just at least emulate the social security and free healthcare ir something
Fuckin indo
Look at all the recent things indo has done
Lmao. I think it's because he's on last term he's just doing whatever
the question is how did he reach the live animal testing permission tthat fast
I wonder ehy does essential worker's pays are so low when ceo is so ballooned up :v
Thanks america
Oh I just find out that the whole national ideology is apparently just capitalism and that lenism and maxism is illegal now

But otherwise I have no reason to turn off internet to play offline games
I played them for work so I can have my computer got its notifs
You have to turn off both
You are also going to still get ads
If you are connected to wifi
Uh
I honestly won't because idk when people will message me or whatsapp got important message from family or w/e
I wrote most ppl
But most ppl won't really turn off mobile data (just in case of important notifs) really
Well you can also do that
The game will run offline
Ads are hooked to another API
If it's not an online game then they literally lost nothing to leave it up (since you said ads... I assume it's those kindnof games)
Newly released stuff have ppl spend in droves
If it got massive launch release, them have to see if it's got staying power
From what I see, generally need to be already pretty big companies (or like, it's a branch of big companies)
It got the staying power *because* of the skin too i would argue
Also while mobile games do seem super profitable, I think it's important to note that when it's successful, it's massively successful, but when it's not it's just... Dead. Kinda need to be kinda big to hit the profit point

(Just pointing since I had some gacha games from unknown companies that just dies lol)
Valve won't since the csgo skins are madness
Or maybe you don't realize how competitive women are because it's different thing
https://twitter.com/VaushV/status/1601076980795199489?t=BCA4QPu9G9ainJ3rkLuFUw&s=19
Wew
Roads are already from taxes ~~even if it's not enough~~
Got all the good news without giving things up
Then never does
They will say they give it
What I mean is more of how the family tend to nurture a kid depends on gender
So not nature vs nurture really
So less competitive outwardly by nott talking about it :v
But the nurture of women tend to lean to don't be difficult
More of ppl are generally the same both gender
Although another possibility is the quashing done at childhood with which things are encouraged and scolded / punished
But both are competitive af
While women is less obvious
It's more of men do more obvious competition
Both genders make testosterone tho but tbh i'm still on
Also stuff like class ranking...
Mostly the fight is on who is most beautiful or who gets the best dude in the grade tbh
I'm saying it feels like that. It's the stereotype
Saying women can't be competitive feels like saying they can't be bullies because they don't punch the other students
(like the competition is on different thing)
Yes that's negotiation strategy
The one in power will cut it
No matter how little you ask
The reason why you go for the moon is so when the inevitable they'll cut it down, you can get at least some stuff you want
It's alright <:kannahug2:772804499684851773> honestly the questioning is already very ugh
Can you ask them back "so do you guys do this because you guys think it's easy"
And they wonder why women didn't want to join
I mean example is the train workers in the US. The main thing they need is the paid time off that isn't 1 month permission hell for the sickness or hospital or etc and that's the point that got struck down
A conspiracy
I feel like us also kinda helps soeharto topple soekarno but this is probanly

No worries I got it
All this shows is that hatred according to race always sucks
On the interwebz
I think recently there's quite a raise in chinese hatred too
Although i think malaysia is doing the same
I'm specificially referring to how indo treats chinese
During the moment before soeharto got ousted, there were a few days of ||raping and pillaging chinese women|| going on
<:sobear:1050379832166453288>
But i don't think it'll be as bad as current??
Like maybe not the best
Feel like we won't be as bad if that coup didn't happen
üíÄ
And chinese racism still continues
We just continue hating communist for fuck all reason
And then we never really recover
Yeah until soeharto
üíÄ
Now we are the worst
Tfw i remember mom saying that back then sg and malaysia send ppl here to study
Indonesia also had one of the best education at the 50s era iirc
Indo went from 2k idr per usd to 16k from his start to end i think
Completely hated the chinese though, no cny celebration during his regime for sure
Also some ppl still love him because his regime was stable (for certain people)
And also do massive corruption
Yeah dude keep rigging election
<:YvonneHeh:998998449729065080>
They should repay us for all the possible good indo could have become
<:sobear:1050379832166453288>
Soeharto is so bad
```The CIA, with some help from its British allies at MI6, eventually facilitated a coup that led to Sukarno‚Äôs government being replaced by the pro-Western dictatorship of Suharto in 1967. Suharto‚Äôs ‚ÄúNew Order‚Äù then embarked on a campaign of mass murder targeting (real or suspected) communists.

The overthrow of Sukarno was one of the ‚Äúmost successful‚Äù coups MI6 was involved with, a former agent who worked on propaganda operations in Indonesia told Lashmar and Oliver for The Independent.``` fuck you UK and US
https://medium.com/war-is-boring/the-cia-and-kgb-tried-to-blackmail-this-world-leader-with-sex-tapes-927fc7ddbd48
He did have 4 wives at the same time
Not 100% sure
I think
I think it was the ussr blackmailing him with evidence of him cheating on his wices
Sorry if I'm being too inflammatory
Dictator is ok as long as they aren't pro ussr and lick usa's boots
<:sobear:1050379832166453288>
And that's how USA put a dictator up woohoo
üòî
Didn't he send his video doing sex with his wives to ussr
He's tbh just want to be neutral
I have the feeling the classic case kf capitalism will hit again, aka the front cost of railways will be high but it'll be cheaper later on, while this electrifying railways is the opposite

also the man seems to have massive hardon for doing things himself and obstructing stuff so it might be possible he has bigger input on design

All i find out is i dislike it
Studied it all 4 years and
It's pretty useless since i hated programming haha
Game Application and Technology aka useless üíÄ
B.Sc
Would have been better if I found a job in that 2 years
Honestly useless
I got MBA already
(i do have 1 year ish job experience as content writer, but i tried to apply to those and never heard back)
Pretty nuch over the you are fresh graduate kind of situation üíÄ
27 this year
(below min wage)
With the pay
I hate having to work sat
<:meltingface:1008651028683567145>
Well the hours are normal hours (8.30 - 17.00)... Just the saturday hours...
But also it's just tedious as hell
Because it needs to bw right
üíÄ yeah you can't really not pay attention
I want to quit it for greener pastures, but thing is just, the work eats too much time and there's not much free time, so I can't really add more to my skills, but at the same time, it's also so low and pretty nuch a dead end job tbqh
Alright <:meltingface:1008651028683567145> when i get closer to 6 months imma talk again with my mom
Honestly sometimes it's just not possible

(Like my current work is pretty much busy stuff, but it's like... You don't really learn much. It's literally just logging transaction into the app... It's boring but time consuming) 

But because it eats your time you just kinda can't do stuff üíÄ i literally just be like "ok when back home... I just want to rest"

I'm trying to throw resumes everywhere but most of the time rejected because age tbh
I think it should be sticking to shorter form
I started at sept
I'm planning max around 6 months so until... March I guess
Guess will never be able to flee this until I have another job (which I'm doubtful to get)
Ugh
~~I don:t think there will ever be a raise~~
Man how long do I need to work before it's safe to put something into a resume I really dislike how much this current work is eating my time
Buy pizza and put pool table!!
```Quiet quitting is a new trend among Gen Z and Millenials who are tired of the hustle culture and the rat race. Although the term has the word "quit" in it, it does not mean resigning. Instead, it means doing only what is asked of them‚Äîand nothing more``` man I hate how doing what you are asked of is quiet quitting ‚ôø
mostly thanks to some ppl who really helps on that o+< I would say it's not really good for continuous income, but as occasional ones I can use it
interview?
Not really sth you put in resume
Nah my side work is fiction writing <:imwaiting:1039710990050279465>
Later
But I can do decent basic speak
My CN is the one I can do that haha
Might also learn video editing for trying out being vtuber <:YvonneHeh:998998449729065080>
Just not something I can really put in resumes
Yaaa, so it's not like I won't have any income if I stop either
Around 200 usd per oneshot
Honestly I do have side income that is massively more
Yeah i probably will talk about quitting once I have 6 months on the belt üíÄ
Wew
My cn is mostly ok, I just need to grind the vocabs
Yeah if it's close it's nice
Nah indonesian is SVO so it doesn't help üòÇ
The problem mostly just the work is tiring x-x
Yeah they are massive, that's why I want to get into it :P
Right now I mostly just wanted to study chinese and japanese so I can kinda slam the steering wheel to translator (since english - indonesia is very oversaturated), but yeah it just mostly came down to "this job tires me too much"

Kinda good to spread store or stuff like vtuber
I honetsly still like twitter more o+<
Tiktok makes z-library gone so i hate it :v
because you can't pay for pricier stuff that will become cheaper in the long run
so you'll overall paying more for heating stuff
while if you don't have a house, that means you go portable, or maybe cheap heating source that probably needs gas or stuff
or like for example heating, if you have a house, you can just install a heating stuff in the home, and pay according to electricity
it's not relatively, it's paying more overall because you have to go cheap
probably will end up buying monthly for cheap boots
rich can buy a great boots that last 5 years probably and will probably cost like 100$
while poor probably buy 10$ boot that last 6 months if lucky üíÄ (idk boots price but just example)
it's kinda more of meaning like, you can't buy stuff that is cheaper in bulk just as example, and stuff like you buy cheaper stuff that won't last as long, so you spend more in the same amount of time
still great read

Do we ever ask "why do we pay doctors for their ability to operate"
Also they are professional like any others
No guarantee of pay
Literally no protection
Translations also tend to be freelancers
What else, when they tend to be freelancers
The manga / comic industry
The anime industry
Also artists
The low low pay of authors
<:E_PaiSuffer:919761378682748928>
(even though we kinda needs entertainment)
Anyway all it shows is that the more capitalism goes on, the more entertainment get thrown to bottom bin (unless it's big names only, where they get all the money)
From some skimming

Ppl: "haha :)"
Well seeing how some ppl behave, yes

It's the classic essential worker doesn't get good wages
Yeah long ones should still be ok maybe
So the shorter ones realllly got shafted
Iirc pilots pay good but only if you are in the super long routes
I think it won't be as bad
Honestly if the pay for the shorter flights isn't so bad
Yeah it's 100k usd or more ish
https://www.brinknews.com/the-pilot-shortage-will-only-get-worse-as-the-decade-progresses/
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-is-there-a-pilot-shortage-covid-retirements-training/
Yeah that's why I said airlines need to just pay for the training
Mostly theirs since COVID only accelerates the problem
It's their fault anyway
Yeah fucking airlines need to just pay for training tbh <:Wheeze:932602402056577064>
Time to also have attendants to be a pilot surely that will solve the pilot shortage <:KappaNitori:430233776493166592>
On covid, well (this is not for the ppl with immune problem or weak ones) some healthy might still get long covid problems that will pretty much complicate things
What's wrong with that
Probably also from the tags in the sites (danbooru is biggest case of having good tagging system and you can see that the generic ai art really follows danbooru)
Personally feeling that's semantics
and considering SOME fucking AI art generator has super cumbersome way of letting artist opt out (aka you have to like, opt out ONE BY ONE images by searching it, that means they have the data)
I doubt it doesn't have metadata of where the source is, or what the image generally is because otherwise, how will the AI maths the things out :V
_ugh_
ugh

<a:pat:730998242883403838> yeahhhhh long covid still exist and we don't know who will get it
that's why I change it to only coworkers in the same company :V
I still feel hiding one's wages from fellow coworkers are advantageous to the company than to oneself
I mean what do one lose by having their company wage revealed to other people in the same company <:StareAway:842387187172769852>
maybe more akin to people in the same company should be able to know what everyone in the same company is paid?
how much x person earns is private, and then they find out how other people in the same position is paid more üíÄ
I'm not sure how much company wages is private life really <:StareAway:842387187172769852>
yeah not saying about how much they earn, just the wage in the company
yeah but how often does it happen? Over here I barely ever heard anyone asking what someone else is making (and me personally feel it's rude to ask tbh, but I also feel like, that's kinda stupid to think of)
and it feels like the whole "you can't show your pay" is long time vibe of that culture
people who are paying üíÄ
honestly I'm just seeing it in the case of companies not being that good in ensuring everyone is on same pay-- like who gets the advantage of the pay being private the most?
I feel like pay being privacy concern seems... not too much to be honest? ü§î ~~It's honestly mostly ppl who got high pay that worry lol~~
or just make everyone find out how long everyone is being paid but that's another discussion
not sure why that's a problem
everyone knowing what everyone else is making seems ok to me as well
Those are also crimes
On same position
Than the others
What about the somempeople's wage mysteriously is lower
Well what about wage theft
(my example is just example of forcing ppl onto things that isn't being done because billionaires actually is getting more tax cuts because they can pay politicians for it :vvvvv)
Yeah forcing billionaires to pay more tax will definitely ends up with them protesting but should we respect them on it (no, not really)
Why is it important wages is private
Maybe they do betting on the sides and win 1 billion dollars
Like i'm specifying wages, not their whole fortune
Think of why *wages* privacy is super important
Because i see it as it's detrimental in this matter? Just more of what you are used to
But in longterm seems good
Short term disadvantages sure
I mean even if they don't want to work together, doesn't this show that you should get out of the company. Unless you are the ones being paid higher
Company is less able to shaft you because everyone knows each other's wage
This way you got a basis of "yeah this company is shitty"
Also by knowing the relative pay of other people compared to yours, if they are being asshole and you see they are paid more than you in same position, maybe it's good to go look at other places? XD like even in worse case scenario
Since I saw he's getting pay of 20k usd per 2 weeks off his company? So it might be the order will be like 54k per 2 weeks?
Also it seems it might be in the manner of pay xx thousands per 2 weeks
https://apnews.com/article/texas-bankruptcy-e60736b0fb42add4afadf25fa1fde450 this is the associated press link linked in that one, so I suppose it's true enough
I hope so too üôè
essential jobs reallys hould be treated as essential, aka get paid better
ü•≤
I'm not even sure why that's relevant either, we are pointing out why it's not worth it to hold onto it as a privacy
you mean pessimism
Admittedly that's a much better pay than local though o+<

Yeah i think so. Pretty much kinda ruined butler's past too iirc
It destroys what is already there by making it worse
Yeah but the film was
<:savage:1038747653602803774>

I can recommend Fablehaven series too
Artemis fowl is good
Pirated copies exist

tfw watching some various videos about the alex jones case and wow, there's literally someone saying he's right 99% of the time... somehow
people point out at these incidents, but then forget that it's also "cancelling" when it is people who doesn't really get any pushback to their very hateful words- just look at jk rowling
tbh not that white... üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but anyway, generally what I see is that people are applying too many things on 'canceling' lol
uh what, cyno is pretty tanned though in his illustration? unless his beginning images are white? :? I never remember seeing any white images of him though
unfortunate that my words are definitely not echoing in the wider space and instead the moral puritans are winning :V
so fun that these people saying they are cancelled somehow still can make articles on the news and get millions of views on their twitter and also appear in tv programs huh
Reading or chatting ornplaying a game
Also spending time driving when i can spend that hour like
Yeah I nearly collided to someone else car <:imdead:1042604394849521755>
Probably so

I hate driving so much why do going everywhere need cars why can't public transport be good and why do my government want to push even more cars
Tweet can't be retrieved
Yeah üíÄ
Why i never enjoyed listening medium as much and wants captions everywhere
I can't focus enough on those enough that I can listen to them without the ability to rewind easily.

Heck, just doing *chores* and listening to podcast and I found myself wishing I can rewind a bit a lot to hear things clearer because i actually found some things unclear while doing stuff
And any living normally will be eroded slowly
Most humans will be stuffed into spaceship to work for the companies
Very cynical view I know but i'm almodt 100% sure it'll be like that
Yeah, terraforms that is used to further capitalism and probably will look like any other resort on earth tbh
Why would they terraform something and not immediately turn it to a tourist resort with super big oricetag
Imo that will just further the capitalism
Well as I said, interested in changing humans economies
It's not their country it doesn't matter :^)
Like massive deaths, alien is real and interested in changing humans economies for some reason, etc
If you mean the whole capitalism, i think it can only end through massive sudden change in status quo
I always keep wondering "if capitalism is so good why does it needs to have people to be on poor/poverty level in some places (cough, if not in their own country, in another) and can't have everyone has acceptable level of base welfare :v

I'm pretty sure that even if they can go 4 days work some companies just
Yep, sounds more of these good on paper but not going to happen for sure
This has the potential to go to very serious talks so that's why I post here but like... I do wonder that if these whole unlimited time off company has is just a front to give less than what they did before (this comes to mind since microsoft apparently changes to unlimited from 3 weeks PTO)

So as people applaud their decisions, it give rhe vibe that the companies actually is just going to give less PTO than they did before because now it's "unlimited", and so probably subject to agreements with the boss
Also the weird 20% royalty if on kickstarter but 25% if at any other platform for crowdfunding? (If the total money funded is over certain hundreds of thousands of dollars)
Also the fact they push it like, super fast too

Well luckily i'm not asked to add to house bills for now
The thing is just my mom will 100% be disagreeing so...
And I have some other method of income that works a while
*also i'm rn living at home so not much spending
Considering I have been searching since september...
Told my mom about it but she's ambivalent because that's apparently how the closing the book moment for accounting is
Also it's a bit of a problem because my boss is also my aunt
Yes work everyday
:')
(i know i can't resign until i have another job lined up but looking at this schedule for 3 months are just... Idk if i can feel okay)
I wonder how asshole it is to resign right before busiest time in the office because the hours are insane >.>;

Mon-sat (8.30-17.00)
Sun and any other holidays (8.30-15.00)
Lmao
Some ppl be happy with musk takeover and then they got layoffed
https://www.theverge.com/23551060/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-layoffs-workplace-salute-emoji
I don't think I can go on a warpath against my mom either
Nepotism that makes me further depressed but it is how it is
No contract since this was pretty much nepotism :v
Just... Tired
:s
"this is just normal hours for end of the year bookkeeping"
"you should learn how to do accounting, better for your future"
"That side income can just be done on the side, stop playing your games"
It's very true! Also i can learn shit on the side tjat i'm more interested in <:sopmodsmielfeic:626596770356527104> but mom will never agree so lol and lmao
So yes you don't want to really hear scolding
Literally had mom scolding us so badly when we forgot to being laundry inside when it rained hard (yes it's just wet laundry but the scolding was *so intense*)
I would resign if my mom won't be needling me forever
I'm better off resigning
HA
Considering no one else does
What negotiation there's literally no nego here
1 is susga freelance content writer, pretty much your pay is from your articles' click
2 is uhh, susga company, checked their google review and so many people are saying that they are left outaide for like, all day
3 is freelance translation company, i asked some question and to this day, I still haven't got a reply (this is since 23 nov 2022)
4 is another freelance translation company, i have signed nda stuff but well... They haven't give me a single job so I can't count on that
Oh yeah I have another one, 5, I got interviewed and they seem positive to me then they just don't exist now (this was beginning of december, so I guess I'm rejected)
*Oh yeah* another one, interviewed twice then they also rejected me
Literally 99% don't reply, i think only 4 ish replied?
I have applied to many stuff :|
"capitalism at its finest"
Anyway if ppl know some remote job to hook me up idk will be appreciated ü•≤
No idea and everytime i think about it i just want to stop existing
Minimum wage here is around 210 usd a month
But see why I want to like, work elsewhere? <:imdead:1042604394849521755>
If I don't have the job I can't
Or if boss is stingh probably 150-160 usd
My guess is during these 3 months my salary will be bumped to 200 usd
For mon-fri (08.30-17.00) + sat (08.30-12.00)
My current monthly salary is 133 usd :)
But it"s not somethinf I can slap on a resume
My side income is *more* than this job
well house is our own
ü•≤
Jobs that don't pay well and makes you want to kill yourself is a dime a dozen!

From rhe pay i would say i'm paid like halftime but have to do it fulltime
My immediate guess will be
"So do you have any other jobs lined up?"
"Can't you just do your side income with the work?"
"Can you even get any other job?"
Honestly I would do it and probs traumatize myself further but works
it's delays

```A total of 27 studies, pooling 7928 transgender patients who underwent any type of GAS, were included. The pooled prevalence of regret after GAS was 1% (95% CI <1%‚Äì2%). Overall, 33% underwent transmasculine procedures and 67% transfemenine procedures. The prevalence of regret among patients undergoing transmasculine and transfemenine surgeries was <1% (IC <1%‚Äì<1%) and 1% (CI <1%‚Äì2%), respectively. A total of 77 patients regretted having had GAS. Twenty-eight had minor and 34 had major regret based on Pf√§fflin‚Äôs regret classification. The majority had clear regret based on Kuiper and Cohen-Kettenis classification.``` here's an example of study, immediate easy find
maybe you should share the news links
isn't there reasons why blockers are kind of, better choice to give them extra time to think of ü§î
no they can talk about it not because they care too
like this doesn't mean that people suddenly become lefties because it's cool
like the whole lefties chart
also yeah, the fact it's more accept leans to people opened up to it more
*but news didn't talk about that do they

Time to complain how capitalism exist to make people suffer harder again-
You know that's how moral panic is spread right? They start it reasonably, *with one real example* and it goes to very wrong conclusion
>a lot
>One case
the way the story is framed is making it seems like transition is something people will regret
It was about helping people transition, but why is it focused on the one regret
as I said maybe share the news story you are talking about
tbh I don't see why blockers need to be restrained at all unless it's really expensive to make (although idk the situation)
good
Some people really be on cigar brainrot
Isn't being high is far healthier than nicotine...
Ahh
What is THC?

because capitalism and so we end up bowing to some people with enough money instead of some sort of divine rules or something
That I'm not sure of
it's the annoying catch 22
because then it means the university is negligent on keeping university B up to date in term of hygiene
so if building A uses them, and then building B people got long covid or some such, and then it can be seen if people in building A is less likely to get covid, then building B people can sue the university
üòî
from the comments, it seems the reason is... if it's shown that these lights actually can help lowering the transmission, the school can be liable on negligence
why take it off

Very pressure
Like being forced to stay at something that demands 80-90% of your time, not getting enough for the time you put in, nor is it something you even remotely interested in or want to continue is
Don't be like mine :v

yeah because content writing needs you to write many things in a day, with super low pay
And also I do like longforms that isn't rambling so this is pretty good XD since they do show news articles and then some clips of some of these other people too

Like you don't have to watch it, but I'm sharingnit because I think it's a good video over things?
Like the people she surrounds herself with and the ones she supported, as well as the affect if what are examples of what those people have said and perpetuate
It's very good analysis over what she has done, especially since like the youtuber said- a lot of what jkr has done tend to be simplified to "twitter drama" when it's... Already more than that

Capitalism and throwing away food because it'll be too cheap
I remember talking to someone else about how alot of unprocessed milk was thrown away in the factory because if they process it all it would make milk too cheap
Maybe if companies aren't completely only for investors it can be better?
Kill all stocks
Investors
But nonetheless it's capitalism that is aimed towards profit which is pretty much like
Money is the main one though
Capitalism sucks for the world :v

Because that meant you have to specifically research this to do it
Some people do have pointed out that these are generally stuff that most people won't find out because it's a little deeper into the culture and tradition generally, but isn't that actually is even more damning
When the more you dig in the worse it is
Then add bells and whistles depending on cilture

I never finished watching it

Pretty distasteful?
Yeah that post makes me understand why I feel the video was
https://cohost.org/highimpactsex/post/944394-on-that-people-make oh
It's all musk's master plan
there's some great yuri manga though at the very least <a:intensifies:637288837290131469>
romance on its own can be great though if there's those character friction
I tried reading sakura trick... and I can say that I pretty much dropped it after the first few pages
accept the gay üôè
to the face
it's as subtle as a brick
oh
it got on pretty huge discount so that's why I scooped it up <a:nod:486219714633138178>
<:wokemamo:747664272955277382>
~~the rooftop ghost is certainly very nice~~
need to play fatal twelve though, heard that one's yuri
since kinetic novels and all
mmm, I took a look at seabed and wasn't certain about it üí¶
>made in abyss
have fun in the suffering
there's just so many high school yuri stories
more variation
I think what is needed is something like
although I think my favorite right now is the weird isekai yuri one
yagate is pretty nice though
just be like me that sucks at imagining but got swept along anyway
they are amazing üôè
> Reading symphogear is like hearing music without volume
can admit that the music pretty much truly bumps symphogear up though
it's hard, but when done well it's amazing
you can read action, just accept that you don't know wtf is happening <:MHXAsmart:585932532764115175>
(bet I can finish it in 2-3 days compared to the 1 week it took)
I was watching through symphogear and it left me feeling "I wish this is manga just so I can finish it faster"
wtf you guys really watch anime like I read manga
>tfw can only ss the dialogues and that just doesn't work
:v
When I was watching there's so many scens I wanted to share on discord and I can't
I wish you can screenshot from CR
To be gay <:NoireUwU:609578382904262656>
Lmao
Considering the way A&S is written I have huge doubts it fits anime even (since it has a ton of focus on their thoughts right?)
~~does urasekai picnic counts as isekai?~~
one of my fav is probably bookworm for that
Granted the isekai isn't really needed but still, I love the chars in the manga ...
```The Magical Revolution of the Reincarnated Princess and the Genius Young Lady``` this one is pretty good isekai yuri
smh no symphogear
at least so I can understand the pairs <:YoumuTeehee:601143617075019778>
yeah I really should
||I was legit going "shit if this is straight, hibiki and miku would have kissed||
(‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
LIKE MAN THEY WANT TO LIVE TOGETHER FOREVER WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED THEM TO DO TO BE A GIRLFRIEND
I WISHED THEY"LL JUST SAY THEY ARE GIRLFRIENDS OR SOMETHING OR I LOVE YOU TOO IN THAT LAST MOMENT
I can agree <:peepohands:688451294175821829>
true, symphogear is pretty subtext but it's like... you are blind if you choose to not believe, especially on hibimiku üòÇ
tfw I tried recommending it to people I know like magical girl and yuri and they all already watch it <:FeelsBadMan:586019549854302218> wojo when will you watch,,,
or at least more popular
by making it a starter, it can be popular <:MHXAsmart:585932532764115175>
all of them doesn't work
I have lightshot :V
probs because I'm on chrome
when I watched symphogear 2 weeks ago, everything's just turned to black other than the subtitles lol
woah
mpv? <:thonkpeek:357018485643149312>
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
fuck CR and their black screen if you try to screenshot
mnyeh
give me more types
in straight we have so many types lah
oh yeah, I think the other part I wish is that there's more of weirder relationship on yuri like. Why is nearly everything is HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
idk but the chars feel good to me
it has a lot of self-narration lol
from what I read off the manga
adachi and shimamura is good
<:peepohands:688451294175821829>
just let them love like why is it so hard
they'll treat gay love the same as straight okay
but anyway I just wish that
>sleep in the same bed as a friend
>we keep to our own side instead of cuddling
well I do occasionally feed friends but there's like, different intimacies there vs what is shown on like hibimiku for example lol
tfw I'm barely close to my cousins while super close to friends
a LADY FRIEND
says that she's pretty much the warmest place and will always come back to her
j u s t f r i e n d s
>girls sleeping together in a bed
>cuddling
>bathing together
>pretty much stay in the same room
>walk hand-in-hand everywhere
"nono they are just f r i e n d s"
üò© gimme kisssssss
w a t
watch it on mute hanabi
I looked at valkyrie drive and no matter how low I've become on the "I'm desperate for yuri" I'm not going to touch that
and air grievances
no we have to COMPLAIN
risk the world by letting this god possess me so I can finally say the important words to my best friend
BEST FRIENDS
[sloppy kiss]
(in miku's defense, she probably is no longer thinking straight at that point)
oh wait
I'll totally go to be brainwashed so I can save my friend by fighting them
<:Pain:630521170248073258>
friendring
totally giving my bff a ring for f r i e n d s h i p
~~why didn't hibiki sing kimi dake ni instead of just instrumental~~
symphogear is only not subtext when you look at the music lyrics
soon ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
FANTASY
but yuri
I just want stuff like that
is so good
I mean stuff like akatsuki no yona
if I want yaoi I'll search for them but I want yuri
ten <a:APetForChris:752996305697243257>
üòî
things seems to go fast on first chapter, but no more chapters for now so will have to wait
hell yes wolfgirl x sheepgirl <:YuukaPlsRember:702672714074292264>
<:Kappa:543946747907538944>
just buy double
like miku's might be the housewife but she always give me the vibe she's the one that dominates the relationship
~~hey I'm thinking it occasionally still and I still believe that miku is the alpha of the relationship. Bikki's just far stronger than most omega :V~~
aw she's super cute
I'll go with omegaverse where miku is alpha and hibiki is her omega <:hehe:688451294645715049>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
immediate, no pregnancy
suddenly have baby
I mean one of the prompts have hibiki and miku on super high synchro rates with one another and then they
or magic
or... science babies
oh yeah, Mage and Demon Queen is pretty good too
I need to read through maria sama, I heard good stuff
||although if I remember right, that rape scene is pretty... <:YumiStare:688429724065988721> ||
I think I read through them, it's pretttttty good
<:MomijiPout:610152432873242661>
||I just wish we get just A KISS or I LOVE YOU TOO at the end|| but fine I should stop complaining about that, I guess the music instrumental is good enough
xv is just awesome honestly, definitely a good way to end it
it's... powerful
I can agree there
<a:tuzkiflail:568817802409148451>
I want something as big as akatsuki no yona but yuri
I want fantasy yuri and it's so hard to find
I think for straight it's because there's _a lot_ so there's always more choices
otherside picnic is getting adaptation too for more non-SoL yuri üëÄ ~~horror + yuri!~~
it's just super slowburn type
not sure, it's only one chapter so far
<a:adontfeelsoblob:580593586266046466>
I mean it's not wrong I'm just
||true, but keep dying sucks||
seems nice for the first chapter but remembering how the first one ended...
also there's apparently a new spinoff for kannazuki no miko
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608> I guess I should find the anime one of these days then
dangit
huh. Is the manga different than the anime <:YuukaPlsRember:702672714074292264>
she feels on the "just right" scale
I Favor the Villainess is pretty good too, but I feel this one gels the two mc much better
ye, it also has manga adaptation so pretty nice <:SakuyaStronk:661255469570064405>
```The Magical Revolution of the Reincarnated Princess and the Genius Young Lady
``` nah this one
also there's this isekai yuri that's pretty good too üëÄ (not I Favor the Villainess!)
that is true :v
maybe you need no space between the word and the *
the pain...
well uh- I'll just hope things will be staying sweet o(--<
yeah, they are really cute
man these two are just so cute
Like god
The manga is really creepy so far
If the adaptation good it'll be amazing
Recommending Otherside Picnic manga / LN if you want
_I'm glad I didn't spoil kanade's death to him because I talked about symphogear too much in that server_
_a friend finally picked it up and said that they saw how gay the first episode one and immediately commented on "wow that escalated quickly"_ <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
for me symphogear is for music and gay lol
if you want slowburn romance with fantasy, Akatsuki no Yona is one to try too
again, I'm not sure how it compares between the anime and manga, but I do hear people like the anime too so... <:derp:406931083092033537>
I guess I'm just biased
true
Silver Spoon too
it's pretty good
although then again FMA is like, one of the top manga I read
also <@!149704282793443328> I onlyl read the FMA series before it exploded, but I do think that you should give it a try? It's definitely one of the better ones out there. Also will be good for you to get some of the famous memes of them too <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
houseki no kuni?
yeah I tried the novel and it gives me the vibes of "actually, the story when he's building his guild seems better than the story we are given"
I still feel bad that I never got into overlord even though a lot of my friends are into it but it's fine I guess
SAO is just the regular OP MC kind of thing
lmao that's dumb as heck <:KokoroLmao:641390803356483584>
find a better group of animewatchers/mangareaders <:Rotsubrick:649809508662509568>
I remember liking jojo before the first season anime is even out, then I just lost my interest when it got more mainstream so it feels weird üòÇ
there's indeed a lot of jojo fans
~~the one I'm hearing people shitting on in my group is irregular high school, but they are doing a group watch so...~~
> "don't even talk to me until you've seen x"
is this a friend or a rando <:SiatanWat:712456911903260703> if it's a friend that's rude, if it's a rando that's- throw them out quickly
they are excited to share it, and I don't mind listening even if I won't pick it up
really? I guess I never really got people being that pushy
ehh, I mean it's like, I share to see if you'll enjoy it. If you dislike it then it's whatever
and I ask them to share them back when they find one I haven't read
~~I mean I share villainess isekai/villainess in a group all the time <:KokoroLmao:641390803356483584> ~~
but if I know they don't like something, I don't share those even if I like it
like they share what they like, and I share what I like
I guess I kinda just shares on whatever I enjoy kind of thing?
got ded
iirc the manga kinda just
hopefully then they'll pace it kinda better
> I'm going to watch shaman king
<@!202444817043685386> I wonder if they'll make yet another ending lol <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
I guess one of its nice part for me is... I can enjoy a lot of long fics for a while <:nadeshiwa:631367599418245130>
||after that it kinda just steadily goes down||
||the best part is during that part where he has to save that girl with the turning back time for who she touched||
then my interest dropped like a rock for some reason
I enjoyed reading BNHA until after the villain arc or somesuch
<a:aworrypetting:719119571235373066>
demon slayer is pretty nice. Definitely reading it because well, it's pretty good lol
yeah like, his guild is interesting! The people that creates this wacky characters are interesting! Then what I got is these wacky characters instead that kinda is sycophant to the main character
It's wack anime
the more I hear of nanoha the wilder it seems to be
oh <:zoomeyes:461302320613949460>
I'm pretty curious how did nanoha had a kid
I thought kumo is out already? huh üòì
üôè
https://mangadex.org/title/51857/the-magical-revolution-of-the-reincarnated-princess-and-the-genius-young-lady

no
just need the yuri isekai to get anime
good god
oh this is the moon god one
Batiting so hard it's yuri
But the name's Sakura Nadeshiko
It's pretty lood
I do sleep on same bed with them last time
So yeah, GALS being PALS encompasses a lot more than I thought

I thought the two are pretty cute <:HyperThonk:365325851107000320>
Solo pls, lank sent the image up there
cute girls üòå
the manga is really good so far üôè I'm still not having time to pick up the LN though (referring to urasekai picnic)
it's like creepypastas being drawn to life- for the manga case anyway
It's like unsettling kind
Hmm psychological I'll say
Unless you don't want horror
This is definitely one of my recommended works
https://mangadex.org/title/29407/urasekai-picnic
Horror yuri üëÄ
Uhh
Otherside Picnic
Yesssssss
~~can I recommend reading Akatsuki no Yona---~~ granted not yuri though
finding a good editor is like <:worrypray:500531964177154059> moments
I remember I saw a company that is like, MTL-ing whole series or something and they don't even hire an editor to at least make it readable or make sense
I feel like I saw them every [x] time
good luck

<:KagerouSmirk:430233754364280854>
use gtl to get the sentence -> throw it to deepl + babelfish (so you can use it with rikaikun)
deepl is also a good choice
the best way is to use GTL to get the kanjis into somewhere, then you slowly whip out a dictionary and try to slowly get through that sentence
novel-updates stuff is mostly MTL, and then you find the rare SUPER GOOD ONE <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
josei mahou shoujo when :^)
it's still magical girl wtf <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I guess that's also part of shonen but ehhh I always feel it's pretty shoujo beyond the action scenes
it always ends better?
also the fact that no matter how bleak things go
I do feel it's still a magical girl at its core. The friendship ~~and love~~ power üëÄ
not sure, never touched nanoha
pretty sure people talked about how geahs take a lot of cues from nanoha
https://mangadex.org/title/54052/it-looks-like-i-ve-fallen-into-the-world-of-a-reverse-harem-game ah yeah this one is also pretty good for reverse harem
it is reverse harem yeah
although honestly the few reverse harem I've read all develops the guys pretty well
akatsuki no yona üôè
what about reverse harem <:sOphieBrickd:574822865128521729>
ah
quintuplet? I heard positive things about it
it is xD
Totally the face that will play video games with you there :^)
Rayearth's manga is cool
You have toooo
||his true form is so cool||
But in the end it's syaoran
Tomoyo x Sakura are good honestly
> Oh and instead of transforming she switches into real outfits.
<@149704282793443328> yep! Tomoyo did her best making those costumes and videoing sakura c:
Like their other works are good but sakura and tsubasa reservoir chronicles and xxxholic is <:worryPray:454345388544098306>
The whole reason I love clamp I could say
Well yeah it's like one of clamp's beginning stuff
(i mean I love the manga already)
I still need to watch sakura, I hear that the anime is much better than the manga
No cardcaptor sakura either <:KyoukoPensive:661255469012221963>
No I mean if it's put there
cure is like, top left isn't it?
I think all the aesthetic purist and thematic purist is defo a magical girl show, but I'm not sure on yuri kuma arashi / and that bottom 2 on the right
although I guess there's that yuri one where she's with the enemy's commander (the commander defected <:MikuHype:688429715676987428> )
it's cute as hell though

hetalia is definitely not the first one to turn nations into humans I'm pretty sure even if it's one of the most famous
like calling a ship a 'she' is something done throughout history
I think for shipgirls it's mainly from how we tend to do anthromorphization (or however you write those)? Like attributing human things to items

NEXT PART
I NEED

AAAAAAAAAAH I FINALLY FINISHED READING THE RELEASED CHAPTERS OF OTHERSIDE PICNIC VOLUME 4
Imagine your phone unfolding like this everytime you send a text
Right
It should be fine
T.T
this one is so nice
https://mangadex.org/title/50198/hello-melancholic <@!183785454447886346>
I have forgotten all of this too tbh
when manga teach maths
well hope y'all find the stuff enjoyable, I try to only give the stuff on the upper level of enjoyment
agreed
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Holy Grail of Eris
but yeah, if you need one to start on
but I think overall really satisfying
the anthology has both good and bad ones
<https://mangadex.org/title/41728/though-i-may-be-a-villainess-i-ll-show-you-i-can-obtain-happiness> oh yeah this one is an anthology series for villainess

<https://mangadex.org/title/33099/this-girl-is-a-little-wild>
my favorite through all the villainess one
I'll go with Holy Grail of Eris
uhh
<https://mangadex.org/title/35225/of-course-i-ll-claim-palimony> -> definitely villainess vibe without being one
<https://mangadex.org/title/53611/queen-of-hearts-in-wonderland> still short but I'm curious where it's going
<https://mangadex.org/title/46775/seduce-the-villain-s-father> -> this one is pretty generic at start but I think by now it's grown to be pretty interesting
<https://mangadex.org/title/53012/shadow-queen> hell yes this one. REVENGE STORY
<https://mangadex.org/title/50201/shokei-shoujo-no-ikirumichi> -> twist being they are killing isekai'd people. Seems to be going yuri too so pog
<https://mangadex.org/title/43292/the-duchess-with-an-empty-soul> 
<https://mangadex.org/title/42822/the-holy-grail-of-eris> -> ONE OF THE BEST VILLAINESS STORY. AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<https://mangadex.org/title/54218/the-lady-and-the-beast>
<https://mangadex.org/title/51857/the-magical-revolution-of-the-reincarnated-princess-and-the-genius-young-lady> -> DEFINITELY A HUGE RECOMMEND TOO
<https://mangadex.org/title/31606/the-reason-why-raeliana-ended-up-at-the-duke-s-mansion> I like this one too
<https://mangadex.org/title/46790/the-stereotypical-life-of-a-reincarnated-lady> - the name is like this but it's surprisingly fun
<https://mangadex.org/title/49644/the-villainess-lives-twice> more revenge villainess, one of my fav though
<https://mangadex.org/title/45833/the-villainess-reverses-the-hourglass> revenge villainessss
<https://mangadex.org/title/45833/the-villainess-reverses-the-hourglass>

<https://mangadex.org/title/39432/marielle-clarac-s-engagement> -> isn't exactly a tensei / isekai but still a good one
<https://mangadex.org/title/38088/may-i-please-ask-you-just-one-last-thing> -> villainess feels ||and then it's revealed to have some isekai stuff too||
<https://mangadex.org/title/48015/my-fianc-is-in-love-with-my-little-sister> more of a timeloop story but still
should I perhaps just combined everything into a message? <:OhISee:365099161097338891>
https://mangadex.org/title/42775/crimson-karma
https://mangadex.org/title/40778/cheating-men-must-die I didn't expect this one to be good but it somehow is
https://mangadex.org/title/47286/beware-of-the-villainess
https://mangadex.org/title/46388/akuyaku-reijou-tensei-oji-san this one is funny as heck
let's start this
https://mangadex.org/title/39474/a-stepmother-s-m-rchen
And it's reallly long list
B3cause I have to peek through my mdlist lmao
On phone is annoying to do it
I'll take the list out when I'm on laptop
Gotcha
Ahh üëÄ
(reincarnation instead of isekai)
And what about tensei stuff?
Do you mind manhwa
I'll tag you once I grab them
Hmm
It hurts to see
Oh god what is that texture for the outfit
Yeah just need to be patient xd
she's trying her best
I think there's still a lot of villainess one I didn't share <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and I was on villainess spree
after a long while of following villainess tag
well this is like
<:Kappa:749277017198952550>
Too wholesome
This manga won't be
<a:patthepotato:750749346043002880>
Lol
And I'm following this from like first 5 chaptere or something
Now you joinnme suffering for next chapter
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
<:Kappa:543946747907538944>
then suddenly a year later they got one update that said they won't pick it up
that's the life
Looking up to magical girls
Girls are cute
glad you are enjoying it c:
hell yeah
I think she knew, but she has something against relationship iirc? She was pretty weird about it
and magical girl
and yuri
nah it's just pretty lewd and kinky
not sending a link here <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
it's a manga and you can find it at mangadex
a lot of gay catgirls in catulus syndrome
she's a cat
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
really hoping it
I'm hoping that the pairs will end up together
ah
like chapter 95 now, and apparently will end at chatper 100
yes I think they are? But it's going to end soon tho iski
<https://mangadex.org/title/21191/catulus-syndrome> that image above is from this manga
üôè
catching the gay
<:gasp:362517501961043971>
people don't watch stuff alone?!
https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/titles/100071 personally feel this one is better <:OhIAwoo:492484587449090048>
like at first it's okay then it just... doesn't work anymore
oh someone else with same opinion as mine on that series
//brikd out of this chat
_FANTASY LIFE---_
Same
I hear the anime has some weird pacing so it might be better to be read ?
<@!195044406343106560> looking up to magical girls got update <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
I think there's another one previously but not sure
Yep
Oh hey this. The novel was pretty famous some time ago. (As well as the other series the author made)
I love the way the myster's solved too
She's superb and he's good support
Gotcha
Ah
||they legit just ignore one of the most hyped part???||
<:15mins:721896936575074355>
||... What||
Did they show the way she solved that ||steelbeam girl case||

||With the 4 or 5 answers||
<:SiatanNotes:712457225964355594>
Probs will pick up majo no tabitabi first
I need to try reading 86 too
Also otherside picnic volume 4 ||finally has the yuri kiss I'm hoping for||
I need m o r e
https://mangadex.org/chapter/1122908/ FUCK THE NEWEST CHAPTER
<:SiatanWat:712456911903260703>
>was about to watch nanoha movie 1
>Sees it's 2 hours
Alright that needs bigger timeslot than what I have
yeah <:waaat:663767735670538280>
uh
https://mangadex.org/title/50198/hello-melancholic
hello, melancholic is also nice
some feels here and there but overall it's pretty fluff
https://mangadex.org/title/24924/hana-ni-arashi/
have you seen hana ni arashi?
especially since the author wrote where they found the stories in the afterwords of the LN!
I love creepypasta stories so this series is like "wtf that is so good" <:KirikaGlee:698939825927094384>
the light novel is pretty nice too!
<:worrySalute:435125732658774036>
on relationship note, I'll put it underspoilers:
||both sorawo and toriko have their own issues, really. And I think sorawo is still confusing her feelings a tad? But toriko has confessed, and they even kissed at the latest event at volume 4 <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> like toriko gets jealous when sorawo went to find someone else for help and such. But overall these two really like each other and support each other really||
isn't really wholesome
but what is happening around them and their past
their relationship is pretty wholesome
yeah okay if you want nice and wholesome you should avoid it
AH
and being called out on it as well lol
it's great to see their problems
pretty layered too
both of the MCs are like
give it a try!
(and hopefully you don't mind the kinda horror / creepypasta stories)
hope you enjoy!
I have read until volume 4 of the LN so it's pretty fun <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
but yeah that one's good, even if the relationship is pretty slowburn, but you can feel it!
why is the title changed <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
yeah that one
https://mangadex.org/title/29407/urasekai-picnic
uhh
that one is my fav right now (with A Monster Wants to Eat Me)
//brikd out
HAVE YOU SEEN URASEKAI PICNIC-
Maybe they are complaining it for others? They might not be affected but it still sucks
but code geass :^)
the aforementioned hand kiss I talked about in <#337805317276565525>
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/721886586383499315/786800275033686016/16076581839226804506166306860038.jpg
Geh
Nope
Idk Injust tried the first chapter of manga and just goes
Tfw I can't like sakura trick
I think I tried but can't really like it
Mangadex at least shows the latest chapter you read
I have too many yuri manga in my backlog that I now have problems when I need to find specific title
Catulus is almost done btw
:_) suffer with me
This one I think will go triangle
https://mangadex.org/title/44983/goukaku-no-tame-no-yasashii-sankaku-kankei-nyuumon
I dunno the girls are *weird*
I think I tried the manga for a long while and it just
Oh this one
Watashi, ore, boku, ware, etc
Not like they keep all the different I
But in the end I hope official ones won't keep them
Like fan stuff that's okay
Imo anyway
I also hope that the san / kun / sama etc isn't kept in official sub
Better off learning japanese
Since everything else is so loud
Lost on me
Subtitles are super important for me since sometimes what is said is just
Nah even for shounen stuff. I like to know character dynamics and stuff
It's magic how I can finish Gear
It's just hard to focus
I'm like even if I'm hype
Writing or manga? Can stop anywhere and I can reread so easily
Anime I have to focus so much
I just find anime's slow since I read fast
So I always try manga
Idk I'm just not the tyoe to watch anime
it keeps going higher
meanwhile I'm hoping to have it autoplay at 480p
Oh yeah I think that's one of the reason I love 5D. They tend to have dragons as their best card :)
Her dragon is awesome too
aki üôè
I sometimes want to punch jack, sometimes he's good
yusei is great
after he got thrown to prison
I forgot where I stopped
and idk where it went now
I need to watch 5D one day. I bought the CD complete but never finished it...
really enjoyed that last part ||where yugi and atem duel||
YGO is good, even though I only bapped the manga version of it and GX
ahh. This one is always cute and healing <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
ü•ö üî®
ah Gibiate. Read someone gave it a huge post and a 0 at another server a few days ago üòÇ
crunchy too busy paying its higher ups <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ura Sekai Picnic is something I hope to have a good adapt still
this one has pretty good list
https://www.livechart.me/winter-2021/tv
aaaa urasekai picnic is good <:heh:782946405856837652>
Hldkdhkkhdk || g o d that is so good wtf||
||I'M FREAJING OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF CLASS||
||OH MY GOD||
Gkekgdhgkslhdlhdlhhldlhdlhhld
Is this the free release or the paid <:BlobSweats:357411435564761089>
I thought gate is wish fulfillment for japanese military :^)
I think I'm ok with both neutral and purist for structure. Maybe
Granted I can count narnia as isekai <:KannaSip:598427103460982794>
Yeah I mean on thr first sentence zero
.hack is not isekai <:miku:655963156807417867>
Sao is more of .hack than isekai
Yo 86... I need to start the LN
I think that's the ones that fills the requirement
Yhere
<https://mangadex.org/title/45833/the-villainess-reverses-the-hourglass>
<https://mangadex.org/title/49644/the-villainess-lives-twice>
<https://mangadex.org/title/42822/the-holy-grail-of-eris> not exactly rhe mc but still very important. This is one of my fav manga too c:
<https://mangadex.org/title/53012/shadow-queen>
<https://mangadex.org/title/35225/of-course-i-ll-claim-palimony> admitredly this one is more comedy feels
Let me co tinue peeking my list
2 first
<https://mangadex.org/title/17720/koushaku-reijou-no-tashinami>
<https://mangadex.org/title/21562/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto>
<@297554276539170826> i have *some* recommendarion that might fill the "smart" female mc itch <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> not sure if it counts as as smart as lelouch or not tho
It's good but not something I want to ever reread
My heart hurt reading that
Scum's wish... <a:KirikaSob:775406148991451167>
Thought it's dolphines
Let love flow through you
AoT is nice but I dropped it back then since it went too edgy ~~and people said gear is edgier~~ <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
S2 has some promises but in the end fails a lot of the promises and has one of the worse end ever
~~digimon season 2 is still bad~~
nah, I was thinking it was digimon since the previous messages were all digimon <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
ah yeah my comment is on different series S2 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> sorry
oh wait carlos, what s2 are you asking about <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>  ~~i just suddenlyr ealized that I might have been thinking wrong series~~
isn't dante's inferno isekai since he went to another world (hell) /s
slayerdramon is good ok üò≠
best digimon line is dracomon (blue)
<:Kappa:543946747907538944>
they can't be applications because those are appmon
<:HibiMikuPeek:661660014288568361>
https://teletype.in/@kati_lilian/SJA8KwjjN pretty interesting interview from urasekai picnic's author
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
ahhh
(also part 2 is linked in the end of the interview)
it made sense
interesting
it's
it's from that interview from the scifi yuri writer, otherside picnic I Linked up there
and the background yuri
can't get this
```I.M.: Two wild beasts glaring and pouncing at each other. It's yuri, isn't it?``` I still
some tragedies are too much for me, but some I like it. I just need them working together <:heh:796600446969315328>
~~hibiki is now a spooder instead of hamster~~
or words + scents (for werewolf)
like with colors
it's great too since different monsters communicate differently
nono, this one is pretty serious and wholesome interaction
kek
pretty much a guy learning various monsters languages and the suffering of it <:heh:796600446969315328>
https://mangadex.org/title/26079/heterogeneous-linguistics <@!383228351168512001> <:HibiMikuPeek:661660014288568361>
||also it's the world where rape is pretty much how to get more magic or something. So yeah|| <:heh:796600446969315328>
I've heard some stuff about redo healer and it doesn't seem to be feelsgood kind of revenge...
<a:hype:721985314251604050>
||well that's really good symbolism going on there.||
<:OgawaRead:688429716507721770>

||kiss <:thinkohya:346191855936995328> ||
It is good but I want more ||lena's pov. God shin is interesting but Lena's just feel better to follow||
It's good but god it's so dark <:NotLikeAlice:641390801804460043>
I'm continuing 86's LN now
Have fun <:umu:796600638695014420>
Not LN but I hear Priory of Orange Tree is both fantasy book and has yuri and it's merely a oneshot so I'm hype <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> I miss reading regular fantasy
*needs more yuri*
Sorawo and toriko are good civ
A few days
Really recommend otherside picnic. I read through in like
Also otherside picnic's LN <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Thr first book of I'm in love with the villainess is also pretty good hanabi
It's ok cypher <a:patthepotato:750749346043002880>
Yep
Uhhh, just index
<:KyoukoPensive:661255469012221963>
<:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
<a:2bsweat:442103711070814214> I was already reading 86
Nightnight
Seems another tangent at hand
Wellthen
Q.E.D. is very nice detective mc if people want to read something that isn't conan <:heh:796600446969315328>
||now I'm confused on why they did anime original episode <:portdoll:796600541874487326> it's not like there's a shortage of cases||
||oh they did? Oh good <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> ||
idk. Probably didn't think that many people like it <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> I hear they are going to ||skip the kisaragi arc? Which is come on... that arc is very important... especially since|| ||when they went and save the US military, it showcases the relationship and personalities further||
Tfw i tried sakura trick manga and I don't think I finished 2 chapters <:heh:796600446969315328>
I want yuri fantasy novel <:45sad:602352963561717770>
I was reminded of its existence by updates in mdex
Goodnight dude
What else unless they are married? Close friends like hbmk? <:Kappa:543946747907538944>
Hakumei and Mikochi
Oh wolf children <:BlobSweats:357411435564761089>
naisu
https://mangadex.org/title/49731/the-witches-and-their-dear-apprentice
it issss. Nagori yu makes cute stuff
nagori yu is so good
I finally found the yuri harem I'm seeking <:woawdess:655089777888067594>
not my thing, but it's... not crazy bad
then it's kinda funny I guess
comedic + harem one
the comedic one
uh
eminence in shadow, if that's the one with uh
```I'm the Villainous Daughter, So I'm Keeping the Last Boss``` this one is pretty nice. A bit too short and abrupt but still adorable relationship
<:ChrisThink:801442525524131891>
The lily huh
that's very RFA
yes
ahh. My most memorable part of him is when he got _problems_ ||when he nearly died fighting azi dahaka||
but at least he's not _too_ bad... I guess. Kinda
yeah the main guy is annoying
the one that is close to animals and the one with... commands I think?
I also like the other 2 characters a lot
which is okay
like they have rigid rules where you have to find loopholes on that I really, really enjoy
I just... prefer the "game" in mondaiji tachi?
but like
NGNL is pretty good
man I quite like that one, surprisingly. Better than NGNL at least <:heh:796600446969315328>
mondaiji tachi
<:BlobSweats:357411435564761089>
So what is uma musume about anyway
Gasp
https://twitter.com/AlphaMike321/status/1353854845640433665 wait what <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> now I'm getting interested in uma musume...
Hope you'll enjoy them
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
XD
Even though it's awesome
He's one of the authors I don't see the works get talked a lot of
The original is manga
Yeah
https://mangadex.org/manga/1434/sengoku-youko
https://mangadex.org/title/222/hoshi-no-samidare

SNK keep making me think shingeki no kyojin <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
If you don't like ot's ok
One of the things imo just at least give it a try for a bit
It's naisu
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that's one good episode
boi
finally watched wonder egg 3
Ed is great though even tho he's a brat <:IshtarCry:650024823497687073>
This one is very comfy read
https://mangadex.org/title/19723/futaribeya
Hmm
Meanwhile I found far more high school yuri
Huh
https://youtu.be/XtgETh4fPuc
Let me grab the trailer...
In the first twitter link
Oh yeah
They have read through the japanese LN (which is 4 volumes already)
From what is written on the tweet, apparently less romantic elements and more of the strong feelings to one another. But still yuri
Not sure, only the key visual is out
It will get anime
Shokei Shoujo is that LN I linked a bit above in that yenpress page
https://twitter.com/moogy0/status/1355883227077095429 also spoilers on the twitter thread
The LN
Nono
Can't wait
9 march
Here's the yenpress
https://yenpress.com/9781975319700/the-executioner-and-her-way-of-life-vol-1/
The world has an organization kills isekai'd people and the right one is isekai'd. So the left one is told to kill her but when it's found out the right one has kinda power over time, well... She's told to bring the girl to the main hq and things happen. I only read a bit of the manga since it's not fully translated but it feels intriguing
I hope this means the LN will be officially translated too
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
This series got anime
Oh shit
https://twitter.com/Ann_NH/status/1355843421819166725?s=19
<:sOphieBrickd:574822865128521729>
because thighs are life
Ah this one
Np
A lot of people like it but I'm like
I also cam't get into the comedy in uhh. Daily lives of high school boys
Gekkan shoujo is nice

But iirc that one is pretty nice and I definitely ship the girl with the knight
Don't think it gets anime adaptation
I think the saintess one is... Decent?
It's nice to have opinions agreed on
If the harem ends up with both genders and a healthy poly relationship I'll give that a try
The fact she's weak is good
I need to read the LN though
Bookworm is plenty good, last time I read the WN
I know people praise stuff like quintuplet I guess?
I don't like harem animes, really. Or manga. It rubs me wrong
I try to check tags because it's where I trust it to know what possible warning I should have for content
And people sayimg the mc is a perv
And male mc
Harem tag and isekai
Tfw having opinion without qatching or reading
although according to a tweet, it's less ||romantic|| and more of ||I'll go through time and space to save you kind of thing. Which is my jam so I love it||
I mean even in the manga it feels gay already
yee <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
also the LN will be out at march
they look cute
this
https://twitter.com/Ann_NH/status/1355843421819166725
more gay isekai
Bookworm is nice because the mc has to be smart while kuma bear is brute force and a little bit of smart
But at least it moves faster than the WN
But then again it kinda skips a lot too
The manga probably is better
Oh
It's just cute girls doing cute things style of show
Where it's all bears
Kuma bear
But I also get distracted easily
Maybe it'll be better if I have watchers with me
Ahh
I just find watching slower than reading
It's ok
Manga is so easy, I can finish assassination classroom in like, 2 days
<:heh:796600446969315328>
Hard to get into anime
I mean people love the manga so it's., Yeah
Wew
I see people liking horimiya but it's another one I don't get (while reading, admittedly. Not enjoyable)
Idk my friends got it
I don't get why it's funny
Nope
Mrrrp
There's a manga about this iirc. Too bad nagori yu doesn't continue
It's the matter of so many girls liking one guy
It's not the matter of indecisive for me
Well I'll put it in the "I'll take a look once my backlog is less oppressive"
I know my reasons of never picking it up is
- losing massive interest in male mc
- i dislike harems in general (although weirdly, yuri harem is fine? But the problem tend to be harem series feel icky)
- heard the guy is a perv which brings it down another notch
- and also heard opness or some such

So... Yeah :heh:
I won't touch the anime
~~which I need to update~~
you can see my amazing amount of backlog
<:heh:796600446969315328>
but okay then, maybe will pick the LN up
smh
||but does it become also with guys <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ||
<:ByakuHmmm:410705563354136577>
<:PlumpJii:600711999520899098>
The premise of 100gf makes me go lolnope
Aka ancient chinese emperor
Has harem but it's because of the world set up
https://mangadex.org/title/21562/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto very good manga
Np ash <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
It's the stuff like in kusuriya
Unless
<a:HibikiAniDisgust:777603915716755457>
But throw me normal harem and I'm like
It's weird I don't mind girl harem or guy harem or reverse harem
Try wonder egg
Like ara fell in story mode difficulty
Some jrpg is possible to be finished in a day
<:worrythinkmag:628990757617008642>
is that plus typeset
https://twitter.com/khellertransla1/status/1355199950083207168
Also mangarock finally went legit and pays translator 1cent for translating and typeset like wtf <:heh:796600446969315328> do they want to kill the translator
They still pay the translator like shit while doing crazy stuff in their office <:15mins:721896936575074355>

I have read the LN
Benchpress me
<:BlobSweats:357411435564761089>
Buff girls
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Pretty good imo
Another one I enjoy
https://mangadex.org/title/24924/hana-ni-arashi
Have you read hana ni arashi?
So you know that one hmm
I know incredibly nice one, nsfw and only 4 chapters though
Aaaa
That needs to be translated
There's a lot of nice yuri
I hope that one will be translatrd too
but the novel is bliss
the manga is good adaptation
<:Salute:620075955288801300>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I'm following both the manga and LN for this one and it's been good
gives off different feel since the order is mixed
I probably will recommend to read it from the beginning too
XD
the manga is there to be picked up if you wish
it's ok
<:kanadesmug:798391267105046539>
have fun there <:KumoSmug:671902299299381258>
okay good
AHHHH
where does episode 5 ends?
Fits the other 2
She's really good
Kozakura <:umu:796600638695014420>
Hopefully good adaptation
It looks gooood
Aaaaaa
https://youtu.be/zVHSuUg3jHY
thigh <:CocoSweat:725405008505602078>
it's superb
yes
She's still cute
(my pfp is just like, someone I use as personification of myself)
Oooo. She's also cute <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<a:patthepotato:750749346043002880>
I won't say anything <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
Yona is good as heck <:BlobSweats:357411435564761089>
But it's good tho
Although I dropped it around 100 chapters in
Akagami is nice
although I still feel gear's songs are better... but still nice
the musics are very good
that's good stuff
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
finally watching 2nd episode of revue starlight
can't wait
üôè
<a:aworrysweat:545192936988475392>
woah
yeah I have all 3 ova
~~got so used with gear~~
I thought it'll be 13
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
oh revue is only 12 episode
gotcha
ahh
more gayyyys
||which in that case, makes more sense why hikari doesn't want karen to join...||
||they really want to kill one another so||
I hear the stage play is like
I still don't know why hikari ||went and tie karen up in her attempt to stop her... there must be an easier way||
ah she's good too
gives me good vibe
yeh
seems ||manipulative fun kind|| <:elsanalysis:665924356530110514>
I'm interested in that blue haired girl though
nana is cuuute
that voice is <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
best girl in the series righ tnow
I love
POWERFUL
THAT WAS
her revue,,,,

<:KanadeBlush:672455329451343882>

<:CocoSweat:725405008505602078>
Joly fuck
Aaaaaa
||TIMELOOPS????||
<:CocoSweat:725405008505602078>
I JUST FINISHED EPISODE 7
HOLY
OHM YGOD THIS SHOT. I'M SORRY THIS IS ||SUCH A DRAMATIC MOMENT BUT MY BRAIN WENT THE WRONG WAY||
fuck that looks just. God I like that shot
alright I have to continue watching, of the last 9 minutes...
||it's so nooooot wrong||
wew
||IT'S THE TRUTH||
||I CAN'T DISAGREE||
||GOSH||
~~also I'll have to find fanfic after this~~
<:CocoSweat:725405008505602078>
||4TH WALL BREAK||
THAT
YO
really nuts
that one I can agree is
IT IS SO GOOD
||NO HIKARI||
||WTF SHE WENT MISSING????||
||hikari don't reverse grip your dagger||
||that blood||
holy fuck
üôè
revue e10 WAIT THIS IS GOING GAYER THAN I THOUGHT <:CocoSweat:725405008505602078>
I use the ripple sub for the revue starlight
~~I definitely rooting more for maya and claude~~
episode 7 definitely is the massive hooker, and maya's episode 3 is the start of when the music makes me go ‚§¥Ô∏è
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
>wtf revue has more fanfic than gear
I watched 7 until 12 immediately
latter half pretty much is so good <:blissdoll:798543397791072266>
ooooooooooh
gib
<:wokemamo:747664272955277382>
my god
IT'S GOOD
ddslkjdsdsfdkjfdk
that was powerful
wow
but
there's still ova to look at
just finished episode 12
yeah
that was amazing
definitely didn't expect revue to be this good
holy shit
<:Bless2:598658978465185803>
wow
but
I'm sorry
the ones I think will get adaptation in the future probably marielle clarc and the alchemist one, perhaps?
I'm glad more shoujo stuff got it though
from wn to ln to manga to anime
damn, the writer is getting up there
saintess nice
oh saintess!
it's really nice
<:ByakurenPray:585667685598101506>
Wew
true, but it's nicer to read on my ereader <:umuSmugu:585942604747898882>
but I still have 4 volumes to go through anyway
I just saw it'll come out at 2nd march or so
<:blissdoll:798543397791072266>
I probably will put off reading the part 3 until the part 3 part 4 is out
so hype
I finally finished reading first 3 volumes of bookworm LN and it's really excellent <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> took me quite a while to do that
Bananice indeed
But if you don't wish to it's ok too
Well give it a try
Wew
I read through the tvtropes
Takarazuka
Uhh
I hope more of the yuri ln will be brouggt over like that princess that enjoys to tinker stuff and that one where onenof the couple wants to be friends only and the other lovers ~~and I'm sure I miss more~~
||same as LN, but iirc in the LN she does accept she was being too much, whereas in manga she kinda brushed it off? Maybe I need to reread...||
Mm, it has a little bit of change that made you go ||oh wait rei you can't say that, you kinda harass claire a bit too||
Yeah the LN worked out how rei behaved to Claire far better compared to the manga
saiyuki reload
wawe
rip
well jujutsu was pretty decent when I followed it in manga version
(pretty good straight romance, although the worldbuilding leaves a lot to be desired. But i like the main couple so it works out)
Man if there's a yuri like in the tales of marielle clarac that will be awesome
Executioner will finally get first volume soon
But yeah, this + the revolutionarh princess is the two I hope will get localization too
Found it
https://mangadex.org/title/48856/there-s-no-way-i-can-have-a-lover-or-maybe-there-is
Let me take a peek to my mdlist...
Machikado is 100% good
Best side
Kozakura is very good
Remake 02 and have TK and hikari be the mc and then let's truly have the dark ocean storyline
:o have fun phar
Revue Starlight is a recent show I really enjoyed
Yeah I think the 2 volumes are satisfying enough
use a certain extention
I think you have to like
||tfw I want to know how to crack things <:thumbderp:378956198491455489> although then again I want to buy from kobo||
ah, calibre is okay too
If on PC, sumatrapdf is nice
On android, you can use readera or lithium, have used both and it's nice
Not sure on ios sorry
very good cover
holy shoot
nice!!!
... what
<:OhISee:365689514146004992>
So how's this vs ex arm
||the two of them are good <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432> ||
||the karate kid and mechanic?||
Oh!
business management
<a:ablobexplode:634643935414976527>
brain cannot study both chinese and japanese at the same time while also doing Master's
~~my plan tbh. In a few more years, if I can manage to squeeze time to study Japanese, I'll be able to read LNs in its original form instead~~ <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I recommend picking up Side by Side Dreamers though, really nice one by Otherside Picnic author <:worryeyes:494734661486903297>
~~but a lot of stuff on NU is MTL'd~~
novelupdates
well considering this one is LN... <:thinkohya:346191855936995328>
https://mangadex.org/title/50201/shokei-shoujo-no-ikirumichi
nah executioner is good from what I heard (and the 10~ ish chapter out on the manga adaptation makes me excited for it)
don't think so
what
MORE OTHERSIDE PICNIC!! I HEAR VOLUME 5 HAS MORE GAY
JNOVEL COME ON
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
and Executioner and Her Way of Life
I'm still waiting for Otherside Picnic volume 5 translation
since I saw this
https://twitter.com/kb76837/status/1349970365737439233
there should be more books coming iirc
they are lovely though
tfw have finished the two books since forever ago üòî
not interested in that one <:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> ?!
magic knights...
AND KNIGHTS
<:ElfneinAAA:672437636362665984>
fantasy high school is okay too <:thinkohya:346191855936995328> idk why but there's something about that setting that makes me enjoy it. Especially when there's like... NOBLES AND COMMONERS thing going on
~~or just magic-based world~~
I just have huge preference for fantasy üò≠
more yuri that's not in high school üí¶
What happened to africa
alright
ahh
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
I think some people here watch uma musume right? Does it give yuri energy or...? <:ChrisThink:801442525524131891>
bonus episode 14 for bd only /s
everyone is really good and that dash of yuri is <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
the plot's... not exactly sure to rate it or not, but the characters are excellent imo
Finished reading the Executioner and Her Way of Life
even the manga feels like it's missing out *a lot*
not sure how good the adaptation will be though
yeah
ofc it's not as straightforward as I'm in love with the villainess but this one is also beautiful <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Since I just finished both volumes of roll over and die
I'm reading apothecary diaries now
As lonf as you enjoy them
Lol
||timeloop + yuri is always <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024> ||
My fav for yuri I think is otherside picnic for now (executioner is also very lovely)
That's okay
The slowburn is good
Legit was feeling that ||the alien bogged the series down <:BlobWeary:365326730690428931> ||
I still insist that the alien isn't need at all in the series
Uhh only to vol 4 since tjat's the official releases rn
I mean as in offi <a:rooZoom:527409773608566785>
Adashima is the shortest LN I read
Hope will be translated too
Huzzah
<:ColtYes:586032137967239184>
Is it a oneshot?
Oh that one!
More cute girls with guns <:ByakurenPray:585667685598101506>
Mecha need more cute girls
Not trashy but executioner and her way of life <:cottonexcited:302375749103517697> i have finished the LN that is out rn and it's so good <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
||i legit didn't realize haha||
It makes rewatching ||episode 2 like *wow*. That minute realization in princess's face...||
In general: more gay types are good and I'm happy to see 'em
||twincest??!! Well I mean I don't mind that...||
The fact that ||princess and ange are the other way around fucks me up||
I need more princess/ange
Hell yeah
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
The only disappointing part I think is that it feels too abrupt but I hear there's going to be movies as sequel?
Ofc
finished watching princess principal. Good stuff and gay
Wow
Definitely very strong series, I love the comics as well as the sides
Have been reading ancient magus' bride's LN series and it's really good
Yeah I think I like the fact they are traumatized and a lot of other things. The start was pretty decent but then it just kinda... Not enough balance between the two, I guess
Ah asuka. Tried to pick up the manga but it's so full of pain I can't continue
<@!782841825069236236> if you want to pick it up? If you like mistress/servant dynamic, this LN series are full of it
Mmmm reading through girl's kingdom is so nice <:MikuGay:336656810788388864> yuri but with mistress + maid stuff...
Hope not <:BlobWeary:365326730690428931>
But I mean so far theirs have no these kind of cry out right?
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>
Executioner is yenpress and otherside picnic is j-novel at least
Bloom into you, roll over and die are theirs as well
They picked a lot of yuri... <:NotLikeAlice:641390801804460043>
<:SolSusBait:780458382792196176>
Well I mean I'm feeling a bit fishy when it comes to them now
Geh. Roll over and die is also seven seas
I didn't read it as well, I just saw it's cut amd for me that's like. Man, this is a novel about this why are you cutting this out?
But... I don't get why this needs to be cut
I feel it's handled pretty well in LN
tfw homura is pretty much best part of madoka for me
wish there's more digital places with no DRM tho
and then if you aren't in US the options just thin out even worse <:heh:796600446969315328>
as long as it handles them well
oof
üò≠
oof
<:thinkohya:346191855936995328>
oh... is magia record good?
I only read through ccs, maybe I should pick up the anime again
alright I guess now I have quite a lot to go through
sakura is good and tries her best and fluffy
ccs is good
I mean I think it's obvious tomoyo loves sakura
got it, any recommended... subs?
oh yeah utena. Anime or manga?
kase san I think I tried the manga for a bit but idk why it doesn't gel well with me
I have finished bloom into you manga and LN both
I guess can just be yuri and good...? üò≠
the suffering of "I have finished the classic good"
wow
not sure why either, when I finished the other 3 <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
stopped around episode 4 season 1
also I have finished watching flifla and pripri and revue and now wondering if there's more of yuri with this kind of thing and I don't mind going to manga / LN as well <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
yeah, luckily that's not mine
_kinda_
well luckily my religion tend to not go under the religion that kinda get kicked around
break the rules if it's right, not just because
that's always true
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
I wish I'm really more into scifi because this sounds very crazy
woah
but I'll give it a try
that is disappointment <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
wait no magic? D:
definitely picking this up
well then
wow this sounds crazy as hell
it's alright, take your time
I managed to finish that one touhou LN... <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
(honestly I have easier time with TW / CW stuff in written form)
time to stuff this into my ever huge backlog of novels
oh yes this sounds good üßê
and not just LNs
I read novels <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
well then give me what is it because I need more yuri to stockpile
what about gay girls being evil together to defeat good
GIRLS FIGHTING TOGETHER
yuri action romance honestly is good
üôè
make sense, although I would say reading both version has been nice for me
or book 3
although do be warned that the manga is slower than the anime in adaptation but put in A LOT MORE details <:zoomeyes:461302320613949460> so yeah, the manga iirc is only up to... uh... pretty sure around book 2 ish
(and there's _only_ 4 books for the english version of the LN (up to book 6 for the japan) so it's not that much)
really recommend either the manga or LN :V
that exist?
oh
other than funi and CRÔΩÅÔΩéÔΩÑ„ÄÄÔΩéÔΩÖÔΩîÔΩÜÔΩåÔΩâÔΩò
what other streaming service with anime
so yeah there's more kozakura (and more of that karateka and her friend)
the manga hasn't arrived in that part, but LN has done it
the case I'm talking about isn't in the anime
checked and outside the 2 anime only cases
ah yeah
kek <:heh:796600446969315328>
which cases are in the anime part again? I know there's the kunekune, hasshaku, ninja cat, american soldiers one
is the lab part talked about in the anime? <:thinkohya:346191855936995328> like why kozakura has them monies to buy the stuff
might be
she really looks good in the LN

that emotes are good tho :V
like I know a friend that said it's one of his fav shows as well so idk <:cirnoShrug:509111217638604811>
I read through citrus and I find it's not that good...? I don't get how it's good honestly
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
good choice for that one
KUSURIYA
Because the audience want to be in it or something ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
Bd release /s
Tbh it only fall for me when it focuses on the villains and forgot the heroes
Ehh. I do like Izuku and doesn't mind the kid focus
I need to continue that but like, idk why it doesn't hook me? I have watched first 3 episodr twice and I think I fell asleep
No, but at the same time I also don't want low quality stuff <:harold:796610426225164299>
I just want more yuri to see <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
I remember wanting to poke nanoha a few years back, but I saw the amount of seasons and goes "yeah no, that's too much"
I guess after utena I should poke precure though. Not sure what else for MG I haven't poke <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ~~or finish wonder egg~~

~~still more of magical girl if from basa's perspective no?~~
lmao
<:kumosmug:824280008787755039>
where's the gay battle harem tho lank
but I still read it
even if it's too gorey for my taste
roll over and die is also nice
so a yuri pair + other things are üòã and stuff like executioner / otherside hits it very well
I'm big sucker for one main romance + other things
I feel that's the majority of yuri
ahhh. Understandable. I like more... spice in my yuri (or my romance I guess) <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> some SoL is good but I love more things going on! FANTASY STUFF!!!
ehh
if I stuff it in my ereader I count a file as a book
yes I guess? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
when it's decently long I count it!
||akari gets jealous and all on menou's disciple having her own ribbons that is given by menou in the past||
and fanfics
nah, I read normal novels too
yeah <:badkekw:744699080839659711> ||just that well.|| ||akari wants only menou to...|| ||kill her. The only one allowed.||
forgets the title but I can find it when mdex is back up. Whenever that is
even if they don't ||say I love you to one another||
it is gay
<a:sadgecry:782586470216761364>
https://youtu.be/IOhmVJoLXxs
executioner first volume is really good, hope the anime adaptation will be good too
<:harold:303611075717234689>
are you skipping executioner and her way of life millh
that one, then the other one with the girl liking her senior and then her senior likes her tutor and the tutor likes her ||and it ends with all of them together||
lol
so that's three
tachibana triangle is actually the one I forgot

very cute
at least I remember 2 poly yuri manga <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I think there's 2 in manga? but is trio a harem
I only ever block one person and he was being creepy in my DM so yes
Nicenice
<:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>
Glad the anime is doing good stuff with it
86 is neat
There's some nice ff fics for franxx though, which is too bad
Considering how quick franxx went away I don't know either way
Ah
Ah
||i'm a bit spotty but I read through some good fics from gridman||
||i probably is spoiled already on that as in that the whole thing is a... Simulation thing?||
I do heard good things for gridman tho
Is BNA girl mc? <:AstridThink:722790874001702963>
Wanted to try franxx then I heard it's disappointing ending and then also the straight as hell and I give up on that üòÇ
So yeah only touched KLK out of all of those since
I tried LWA and not interested and akko kinda... I don't like her as mc at all and so it's just mleh
<:FennyNote:826793286257082430>
Ugh need to finish utena...
Probably should take a look at gridman maybe. Although it's probably just a huge tease
I thought hugtto is pretty good?
My opinion on them are too tainted by franxx then I guess
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>
bless sorawo and toriko <:roobless:744772479389794346>
Sanity is overrated /s
||I don't mind cute, like futaribeya is pretty much just full on fluff without a care in the world. But that one still holds up||
cheerful amnesia... ||I think my problem stems from how it's just outright breaking all of my suspense of disbelief. I tried pretty long but in the end it's just... I can't||
our teachers are dating is nice I think. I remember reading a bit
once it found its groove it really moves along veryyy nicely
that one is really nice
I like it
TRIED FIRST CHAPTER OF I WANNA BE YOUR GIRL AND THAT'S INCREDIBLY GOOD
the ones I remember reading and liking
Catulus Syndrome (finished, definitely pick up if you like catgirls as well. It's super cute), A Monster Wants to Eat Me (still only 6 chapters, picks up some heavy themes as well as pretty dark), Otherside Picnic (if you don't want to try up the novel, the manga is really good choice!)
I think the one I don't really like out of those is amnesia, but it's still pretty good. My dislike stems from personal reason
will try to pick up I wanna be your girl though, that's the only one I haven't tried out of that list I think
aw there's no some of my favs there
<:Thonk:310617895312818187>
nina is the name of the mc
üòî
I would give mdex link but it's useless because mdex is down anyway
here's the title
```nina-san no mahou seikatsu

I love it
yeah it just
holy shit

let me see if I can get it
there's only one other I reallllllllly love in term of super amazing of arts
and those are very _awesome_
every chapter it feels like there's a 2 page spread
agreed 100%
manga only sphere
it's pretty much my fav in like
YEEEE
recommend you to continue if you wish, it's really nice (but if you don't want dark stuff it's understandable too)
also A Monster Wants to Eat Me so far is really incredible, and I'll keep recommending it :V (unless it really drops the ball which I hope it didn't) (this image comes from first chapter but I think it gives the vibes)

most of the time, it's people that has 0 idea on how translations work
https://twitter.com/katrinaltrnsl8r/status/1381639689522700295 this one is also a good explanation how a slang can come into the translation
https://twitter.com/ragingrei/status/1381696624984911872 <@!379337518371307522> here's the explanation the translator threw
Only read the wn for bikiwitch, but if you seek like, SoL comfy stuff, yeah that's the series
maybe end of this year they'll start translating...
guess it'll take a year or something
<:pepehands:744752920960172032>

I found some really nice art for File 18
I NEED IT
J-Novel please push out volume 5 and 6 for otherside
<:Bless2:598658978465185803>
Otherside Picnic is blessed
kek
tfw my favorite romance isn't even counted as romance in their genre
YagaKimi isn't bad
<:Thonk:310617895312818187>
instead
but for romance I will recommend wotakoi
nozaki kun is pretty good
unless it's those gamer kind of fanfic I guess
it doesn't in a story
I think numbers existence in games make sense
they are abstract numbers you have no idea the use of
they aren't communicative
I honestly feel number stats actually make things _more_ obtuse :V
bofuri does aim to play with the stats (and iirc the number isn't CONSTANTLY SHOVED TO YOUR FACE)
when the isekai is trying to do worldbuilding and stuff it's where things pick up
so the world end up pretty stale
the problem is that majority of the isekai as we talk about it (not as in the "go to another world" genre, which is something pretty old already from stuff like Alice in Wonderland, yankee in arthur's crowd, even some games like FFTA iirc is isekai), but it's just a lot of them are... not really inspired? Not talking about the top of the crop as it is (although *personally* top of the crop tends to be pretty crap for me and I have personal dislike on a lot of them)

I think the problem is that a lot of them is that they reallllllly like to use rpg stats without being fun with them and instead just be powerwank <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
and won't work any other way
bookworm is still good isekai
never get into DB <:KEKW:794644343881072640>
sadlife
>good art
>it's completely hidden by the bloody skills name
<:pepehands:744752920960172032>
<:KEKW:794644343881072640>
and then it's cut off by skills for like a few pages
especially in the manga where you already only get 12 pages each month
well it's tiring to see still
~~I do actually quite like .hack, although I have forgotten everything about it~~
SAO / .hack / Log Horizon is set in game world
yeah that is the problem I get it
I'm pretty okay with stats and skills (unless it went on and on and using multiple pages... I really don't need that 3 pages of skills or whatever)
granted, I think if it's a story about being in a game world
it reallllllly depends?
well
compared to stats
although I would say that at least skills can be more interesting to be used
I didn't pick it up because I don't have interest on harem-male protagonist
not sure
I think it's more of skills at for SAO?
m-maple your vit...
but the general trend is bad I can agree with
I mean there's good isekai
give me fantasy/romance yuri pls
<:AUChrisCry:799419916092178442>
makes me annoyed so much
not _use_ it
I like fantasy and isekai using it then just
eh, I prefer fantasy as a whole
_I like executioner_
Executioner and Her Way of Life is also pretty interesting take for isekai
<:pepehands:744752920960172032>
samsara isn't about getting more powerful tho
and the secondary characters are actually great and not just a piece of cardboard
that part with ||euphie <:sadge:782586457730580530> ||
never watched third season
first season is amazing, second season is kinda eh
I guess? But it just feels like the top stuff in the boom genre feels like it has a harem
I like magic high shcool idea, but I don't think I saw any where the story seems appealing to me
whatever the next boom, it'll be something that can be harem probably <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
and that the logic is very different
mm, I like the fact in bookworm, the mc constantly has to face that her morale from our world is very different from there
but then again who knows how much isekai take in since they already got this [sizeable] minimum probably
I do hear that for LN companies, they do limit isekai submissions since that's _too much_
so I'm not sure why you are quoting that a little facetiously, digi
we criticize their story, not the people
(amnesiac hero is a trope that can work, but a lot of times it's not used well and just used as a shortcut)
:^^^^^^)
it's the same as mc has to have amnesia in a lot of RPG
And angst
It's so sweet

86 is great
and they populated the google search too
they got ad/click revenue, they stole arts, etc
~~honestly looking at pinterest sucks~~
I mean you don't need to know the icon to see this üëÄ
Well hopefully it won't be terrible
Ic Ic
Ahh
Didn't sentai is the one that makes the horrible subs for some series. Isn't this bad <:notlikeishtar:775031340499861526> (iirc oregairu s3 and some other stuff)
Was reading the two chapters translations and it was amazing and pain
By the way, anyone know where to buy this one digitally? (The japanese version in epub version) https://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-story-of-unforgettable-witch/
<:heh:796600446969315328>
Hate how ebooks are mostly like that
(bought a doujin once there, I end up double dipping just so I have a pdf instead)
You can't download it and it'll be stuck forever on their frankly terrible webviewer or their app
Bookwalker is terrible

it does have aquarium from the teasers iirc
July 8th :o
https://twitter.com/aquatope_anime/status/1393128975531085824
I can agree on that. ||While Shin is great character, Lena is the whole reason I'm staying- like she's such a compelling and great character man üò≠ I love her everytime she appears||
still one of my fav in term of modern fantasy
granted not yuri
Ancient Magus' Bride?
just hard to get desire to watch üòî
I need to finish utena but I only reach episode 7 and I'm stalling myself to heck for some reason o(--<
everything is tokusatsu ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
instead of dumptser fire
that premise sounds like a doujin hentai plot tbh
86 <:ByakurenPray:819122210454634526>
https://j-novel.club/series/girls-kingdom it's pretty good
Since the characters are more enjoyable imo
Girls kingdom is the fluffy yuri I enjoy more
Ended up being too tired to continue
I didn't read the latest one but I did read pretty far of the WN and so far it's ||the latter. No idea if things change later on though, as the samey feeling took over||
make sense
there's still like tons more LN to go through üëÄ
so should be good until 4 at least
iirc it's more of like extra stories
kinda on the minority on that one <:Thonk:310617895312818187>
(I continue recommending otherside picnic for people that haven't picked it up. The LNs far better. Even the manga is better choice than the anime)
overall pretty nice read if you want something slice of life-y but fantasy
elaina's pretty good. Iirc they skipped majority of book 2 too
it's sitll 2 more months for otherside picnic volume 5...
roll over and die then read elaina
so painful <:pepehands:744752920960172032>
it's ok I need to continue reading roll over and die too
<:worrySalute:435125732658774036>
I have one part I really want to talk about <:KokoroLmao:641390803356483584>
ah ok I'll wait <:ByakurenPray:819122210454634526>
also have you read vol 7?
||lena's growth and her missteps are so good in this series||
<:ByakurenPray:819122210454634526>
||tbh I found myself feeling a bit dragged while reading through those books because there's no lena. Like shin's good but... lena's why I'm staying if you get me||
<:pepehands:744752920960172032>
Considerinf it's already a novel spin off and also a limited at that I'm not going to hold my breath <a:PlumpTears:611583877764612117>
fuggity I bet I can never read that too
what
mahou shoujo lena?????
molcar gonna get a movie

wow
<:naruhodo:530610258822037504>
I haven't seen anything so I'm just hoping for a good relationship between the chars
horse biography...
ahh üëÄ
(which is very different to a lot of yuri out there)
(granted my favorite yuri is Otherside Picnic)
it's ok I come into this for the yuri <:KEKW:794644343881072640>
I saw yuri fanarts and it definitely kindled my interest üëÄ
still haven't finished utena ü•≤
I need to watch this series indeed
uma musume really wins
oh wow
https://twitter.com/RanobeSugoi/status/1402202327545647124
Nah I'm meaning more towards this kind of meme
But if you feel MG needs more then you decide
It's a yes
Like if you think MG just needs girls ttansforming
Purist: [something] must be [insert criteria] for it to be inside the [genre]
Depends how purist you are with MG
Oneshot: Side by Side Dreamers
Best one: Otherside Picnic
Surprisingly good: Executioner and Her Way of Life
Pretty gore but good: Roll Over and Die
Cute Girls Doing Cute Things + Maid / Mistress: Girl's Kingdom
I have 3 on the top of my mind to rec for yuri LN
There's some good ones
man I need to pick up the blue reflection first though
nicenice
üëÄ!
more like "nah nevermind, not going to release"
üòî
man I kinda feel bad for that 2019 already finished animation but still not being published because ~backlash~
but I guess it's terribly managed anyway :V
rip CR original
https://twitter.com/CanipaShow/status/1405874331444338699
Mmm yeah
Steampunk spy <:JalterUmu:362263232771129364>
Btw Princess Principal is good too
Flip Flappers best one from the choices there
Or finish princess principal- <:raydnbrikd:474283737715048450>
Ez
Just try a few eps and see if you enjoy
I even try to stick to buying stuff digitally
unless I really love the series I don't think I'll ever do it
yeah those are too pricy
oh
ü•≤
honestly all 5 books are cheaper than my comm
it's not too pricy
now to wait üò≠
finally bought the 5th book
the trailer is gooooood
just read the original LNs :V
malicious trademarking is done everywhere, not just Japan
üòî
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
who the heck trademarket it tho
well they are doll's so I guess doll's frontline works too
don't know how it'll be animated though
the stills are pretty good
hm
all those things depend on who draw them though
nah if it's just girls using magic that's just fantasy
and megadimension
honestly if it's only comedy I don't think I enjoy it as much <:ChenShrug:634326390279241729> and I only played all 3 rebirths
I quite like the plot
yep
I take it seriously :V ofc there's a lot of comedy moment but it's not like it's the only thing
so...
rebirth 3 doesn't
like rebirth 2 makes me cry
:)
I think I still like conquest ending the best
hope you enjoy though
nah no plot spoil
I just played rebirth 3 a year ago so it's still pretty fresh
>plutia and iris heart is very different people
HAHA. It's more of iris heart just put away the laziness. The sadistic side is there on both
Comp)etely tenuous at best
Soooo
And everything else held no semblance to mahou shoujo
But they are already goddesses
That can work
If they are normal girls becoming goddess
Yeh
:v
I can't agree that neptunia is mahou shoujo because the only thing is just they are transforming girls
<:WOKE:721896915586777229> sssscomic is always so good
not sure, just that I think there's multiple anime like that
isn't there some series that went and skip some stuff when they adapted it and then when some IMPORTANT plot things come on next season they scramble to try and make sense of it? <:heh:796600446969315328>
if the original thing they do is better it's okay tbh, but I always compare adaptation to its source. The best is if both are good in their own ways that make it preferable to look at both <:heh:796600446969315328>
like when I'm reading otherside picnic's manga vs LN, I find the manga is still very excellent even if the LN's still better imo- but it's still something comparable to one another
(because if you don't enjoy the story then it's... not the same thing? I'm talking on the basis of adaptation here)
is it that you don't enjoy the story or is the animation that bad or what
86 is example of excellent adaption meanwhile it seems <:RosThink:826566635313299466>
from what I've seen of people that read the manga first, it seems the anime original stuff isn't likable (or at least, the other person I see)
awesome moment
it's such
Princess Principal Movie (seriously spoiler): ||HOLY SHIT THIS MOMENT WAS GREAT... and that ending üò≠ gosh||
but it's still solid <:KokoroLmao:641390803356483584>
more than the yuri
tons of gore
86 - solid, but pretty dark with death and... a lot of other things
Apothecary Diaries - some mysteries but Mao Mao is pretty much one of the most solid protagonist out there, got some light romance but overall it's more focused on Mao Mao as she navigates the imperial palace
Otherside Picnic - going to another world of supernatural with yuri on top, also horror and adventure pretty much
Girl's Kingdom - not sure if it'll be real  yuri yet but it does give very strong subtext and I'm just reading straight into it. Very light read with enjoyable cast, and maid + mistress kind of relationship everywhere and pretty much wholesome
Roll Over and Die - tons of gore and yuri, but it's pretty solid overall
<a:KeiBonkAranFast:835889527322574928>
yeah but what genre :V
~~Otherside Picnic~~
well other than that... Girl's Kingdom?
damn

~~kusuriya is apothecary's diary :P~~
I like mondaiji tachi more than NGNL since I love those game concepts <:KokoroLmao:641390803356483584> but the sequel kinda... sucks?
well if you are a pirate then there's pretty much some places for LNs... <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Side-By-Side Dreamer - quite a bit of confusion while reading through this but definitely enjoyable. If you like Otherside Picnic style, then imo they are still good
j-novel did them
oh I'm only throwing the officially translated ones
yeah, but I'm not sure if it'll be good considering the manga adaptation seems to be missing some important stuff
Executioner and Her Way of Life - Yuri. Quite deliberately poking against isekai. ||Timeloops||. Unique magic and overall enjoyable. Can't wait for the 2nd volume
like this is the one that is fun even though it keeps creeping up <:KokoroLmao:641390803356483584>
I love the power escalations too
honestly the world of Mondaiji is also fun
yeah it's super cool
<:KokoroLmao:641390803356483584>
maybe I should reread... one day. Once I finish my backlogs
kinda felt they fell by wayside later on, especially once we got to the ||embryo's plotline thingies. Although maybe it's because one of the part that I kinda remember a lot is that moment vs Azi Dahaka||
~~wish we got more out of the 2 girls in mondaiji tho, rather than focusing on the guy~~
yeah I find that I keep comparing it to mondaiji and enjoyed mondaiji better <:sadge:782586457730580530>
<:exuhyperstare:744751757690667109>
the side story was incredibly fun üò©
~~tbh felt like his two sister's more interesting~~
OSO has no comedy but the way it doesn't move forward is kinda eh <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:Kappa:543946747907538944>
just go bofuri instead
(I read some horse racing manga in the past)
<:KokoroLmao:641390803356483584>
so far pretty good. I think I kinda hope it'll talk more about the racing strategies though
special week x silence suzuka seems strong
also I finally picks up uma musume <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:worryeyes:494734661486903297>
but yeah, I know they are horse girls, but it's still... very ewwww to see
the female trainer seems more interesting but it's probably those same beats that annoys me a lot
he looks more like pervert in s1 for sure
yeah I don't like the trainers already <:KEKW:794644343881072640>
>first episode
>two times feeling up her thighs
I'd rather well written tropes, rather than a forced twist just for the sake of a twist ~~gods, some writers need to accept that people being able to guess future plots doesn't mean you need to scrap that plot, that actually mean you are good in foreshadowing~~ üò©
solid typicals is still good
can't wait for s2
<:naruhodo:530610258822037504>
<:WOKE:721896915586777229>
<:elsaanalysis:824279643745288282>
so this is actually half incest
I... see <:worryeyes:494734661486903297>
(aka 2)
if it's manga I would have picked it up already
just kinda busy to pick something up that I won't be 100% sure since it's anime (I still want to pick up blue reflection but I keep getting busy)
I'll wait until it's confirmed then before I pick it up
ergh love triangle <:notlikeishtar:775031340499861526>
read the manga <:Kappa:543946747907538944>
yeah I mistook that because I didn't remember the order of the words <:thumbderp:378956198491455489>
oh my god I get so confused when you guys are talking about kageki shoujo because I mistook it with another series <:vacantmamo:665896084358561812>
yeah, but at least they backed off
imagine thinking $100k is enough for licensing though
https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3xwx8/kickstarter-shuts-down-anime-streaming-app-that-seemed-too-good-to-be-true wew. pretty nice read about licensing thingies
also waiting for otherside picnic
<a:aworrysweat:545192936988475392>
since I'm waiting for the full version to come out instead
I didn't read any of the prepub chapter
ooo
reading through the Q&A for bookworm fanbook is real fun
about how there's people isekai'd into the world and they have to be killed because the very existence of those people are calamity bringers
it's uhh
I read the LN and it's one of my fav yuri LN <:thinkohya:346191855936995328>
Hmm
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-07-15/the-executioner-and-her-way-of-life-anime-unveils-main-staff-2022-debut/.175151
after exams then <a:aworrypetting:719119571235373066>
It's goooood
<@186660127825330177> too
Next chapter üëÄ
https://twitter.com/pripri_anime/status/1415507159635218443?s=19
if it's really gay then I have something to watch at the end of the season <:AranUwu:780821567080103947>
<:Leondetective:769731154503794728>
it almost formed a heart
https://twitter.com/gsc_kahotan/status/1415581903617396740?s=19
whisper of the love song or something along those lines <:redpls:744711933789339648>
woahh
<:wokemamo:747664272955277382>
wait is this true <:ZoomEyes:340489686285942796>
what if it has more side stories though
but damn I never knew the game has LN series
https://www.siliconera.com/kingdom-hearts-the-complete-novel-will-include-all-12-light-novels/ not suer where to put this so I guess over here ü§î
pretty good
I read through the 18 chapters out
I like her a lot, especially manga version where she recruits oguri cap <:omori_pog:782989937150263296>
<:uoooooh:864704745662709782>
SO COOL
MANGA VERSION IS JUST
not too bad, but man, why is the rudolf in anime is more comedic than the manga version
reaching episode 13 for the first season of uma musu
as long as the world building is interesting and done well, it's a good choice though. Fantasy series with good worldbuilding is good :V
<:uoooooh:864704745662709782>
~~I need more bourbon and rice shower interaction ASAP~~
boi that is good
EPISODE 4
üëÄ
yeah no one lives on the sun but y'know, it's weird that japan uses a lot of sun imagery and then the west be like "MOONRUNES"
>the poor trainer
:)
<:DogeEyes:831567325290823701>
should be sunrunes because japan is the sun country
I do like those training games
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I wish uma musu's gacha is in english so I can try it out
<a:ablobsweats:548314784471449610>
also I legit thought that season 2 will be about rice shower and bourbon <:goldface:585557178572865546>
tfw needing more of these two
aaaaaa
üò≠
Uma Musume season 2 episode 1

||wtf do they really start us with teio's leg having trouble||
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH. DAMN <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> !!!!!
fuck she's the cutest uma in the anime
so good
damnnnn
I'm still in the middle of episode 8
<:paimonuooooohhhhhh:849318467798564915>
SO GOOD
THAT'S
fuck Bourbon x Rice Shower
but I guess it's the one that make sense
||damn. Didn't expect teio to lose <a:Pensivewayo:528038699292688394> ||
adorbbbs
<:uoooooh:864704745662709782> wifes to one another already
Uma Musume S2E5 <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> !!!!
they are interesting
I like the horses
<:badkekw:744699080839659711>
I swear I want to just shove off all the Trainers
these two together is better
overall I think it's a huge upgrade from season 1
last 3 episodes are amazing though
it's fantastic but I think all the people saying it's super good lead to me hoping it's even better than it was
it's like those uhh, buy CD for voting for your favorite singer thing?
that might be one of the reasons then
ah
very high subtext
horse girls good
wtf
kita x dia are immediately top ship for me
<:uoooooh:864704745662709782>
the BD is also one of the best selling iirc?
<:uoooooh:864704745662709782> season 3 is probably coming, and with kita and dia so I can't wait for that as well
that's so good wtf
FINALLY DONE WITH 2ND SEASON OF UMA MUSUME <:uoooooh:864704745662709782>
I would say the way they put the subs are definitely a winner so the typeset pretty much push that one over any others
the latest book in the series is amazing too
good
hell yeah
Yeah a lot of horsies are related to one another
> rather than the original interpretation of being a grumpy puss that slowly worked her way towards self-awareness
what about deliberately being grumpy puss that teased their love but is also weak when teased <:KokoroLmao:641390803356483584>
because watching on 720p makes my video buffer, and I don't see much difference between 480p and 1080p when I tried once
<:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
I watch on 480p actually
well they can skip havingn an ending. That just makes it terrible
When it's official pls tag me üëÄ
<a:KokoLove:616963783746650112>
this series continue to be awesome and I love them so much
satisfying
god that's
and done reading it
<a:MioExcited:855873985019379763>
IS FINALLY OUT
volume 5
AHH

Oofie
üò≠
I do have a lot of weakness for the part with ||the egg and pet part|| but I hear it doesn't really live up to it so üò©
I stopped around... forgot the number ||but when the mc decided she's going back to school!|| because I pretty much lost interest
well unless it goes poopoo at the end to which it's sad
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I'm still hearing tons of good things about aquatope and can't wait to binge on that
I used the one <@331908049822547978> recommended to me (o.o
although the problem with revue's official is that they didn't translate the music part...? I remember finding some where it's just either
>very badly done
>only putting the lyrics of the music
>pretty much just skipped
although I guess both of them have that anyway
isn't that more of fansubs
seeing the amount of bad ends in aoi shiro and akai ito makes me glad I have gone that way for sure
meanwhile by now I have given up on trying VN without guide and just do it all with guides :V
üò©
I need to continue watching HF
how many animes adapted from vns that is good anyway
~~meanwhile I suffer from how the 4th part out of 4 VNs are NOT OUT YET AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH~~
ah ok be glad for that then :V
wait does angel beats part 1 ends on cliffhanger
man VN with multiple parts I wish will be released faster
>:V
because my problem is just how much it broke my suspense of disbelief
because I only played the first one's for like, the first few scenes
like is the newer ones better
idk if it's better for the latter ones though
I hate it
completely
sucks
it
Ôº©played the first a kiss for the petals
<:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
will buy it when it goes on discount again
oshirabu is in my wishlist
I need more yuri vn to play and recommendations <a:Pensivewayo:528038699292688394>
<:Pepega:586019549669883915>
since bad l2d just means they have tons of BOUNCE on the chest and that's ergh to see
eh live2d I feel isn't too good. Depends on the vn of course, but if they aren't using it good I'd rather they don't have l2d at all
open a guide <:brikdcana:287452290686648320>
best 4koma manga too imo
machikado is _good_
I need to give life with a tail a try... well soon ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. I'm back into my mood of "let's read MASSIVE AMOUNT OF FANFICTIONS"
yeah I just don't really remember much dragons-related stuff sorry :(
ah gotcha
~~mage and demon queen. Does it count if the dragon is dragongirl~~ <:brick:280095816121581589>
there's not much good ones with dragons imo. Unfortunately :V
it's the dragon no tamago pretty much
I said that you have said the name lol
Saihate no Paladin isn't too bad although the dragon only appears in one volume <a:Pensivewayo:528038699292688394>
oh yeah you have said it
there's that one reborn as a dragon that I remember not too bad, although it's kinda slow but I have long since dropped it at around 200~ ish WN chapter (haven't read the LN version, and not sure if I want to)
unfortunate
oof
man there's so little dragons in the good things I like. ~~where's my fantasy yuri LN-- wait that's executioner, but I need MORE fantasy dammit~~
pretty much my fav
otherside thouuugh <:HEART:800008082901958686>
but yeah, anyway, Executioner and Her Way of Life LN, and Otherside Picnic LN
well if you don't like it it's fine, I find it's catching since the start personally, just that the latter part really goes so much better that the beginning part is weak in comparison
tbh she's not a bad kid even back then <:badkekw:744699080839659711>
the first few books are a bit... yeah, but I find once she's at the ||temple|| the story really goes off
and the worldbuilding is excellent as well
expands
bookworm I find is one of the better isekai since it really
sad
bookworm--- <:brick:280095816121581589> 
if you don't mind a more supernatural flavor, Otherside Picnic is SUPERB. Literally my favorite
Executioner and Her Way of Life is good too (LN is >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> than the manga btw)
Pretty sure shirou keep stumbling across things
I don't remember if there is tho
Be opportunistic
But if there's a chance to kill him
although I think they have more pressing thing to do
yeah but my brain that is being wary immediately goes "even if they aren't a threat now, we get rid of them before they somehow become a threat"
saber's awesome though
she's kinda my favorite
I like UBW but that's because I do like Rin a lot
yea wasn't meaning on this, just that if a series' mysteries is so integral on its goodness, then the series probably ain't as good <:brick:280095816121581589>
I think mystery's good, and if possible is to go into a series without knowing, but if the series becomes bad when you know the mystery-- it's not... that good then? A good mystery should be nice even in suspense instead. <:ZoomEyes:340489686285942796> Well that's my opinion
<:omori_pog:782989937150263296>
I convinced a few people to pick it up and they enjoyed it
I just hoep you'll enjoy it when you start
yeah it's ok
hope you enjoy
<a:ArtiaThumbsUp:687600039945830458>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
it's perfect
||I mean it's very bait and switch with the first guy isekai'd got op power, then meet a cute girl :V||
<:brick:280095816121581589>
it's very cool
Executioner and Her Way of Life üëÄ LN version is FAR better than the manga btw if you have read the manga version
do you want another ||bait and switch LN|| like that <:brick:280095816121581589>
The LN's explained things better imo
OSO's nice but the latter part feels boring. I do read to volume 10 I think...
But I think that rule of 10% good 90% trash also applies to WN
Bookworm also got good WN
the original one is honestly pretty interesting. I remember giving... a watch? At the concept of the first version of fate where the mc is a girl and we have that arthur ||who also got stalked by the girl's sister?|| and then we have that gil... <:hmmHypereyes:862262441341091871>
shoko is so good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vXdJ8-LZdY man this poketoon is incredible
yeah apparently some people likes that <a:thonkingintensifies:423248193523023873>
or this kind of thing is something I don't really like imo? <a:thonkingintensifies:423248193523023873>
I really don't like the "invite" the reader kind though <:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
oh that isn't as bad
/s
||what do you mean that sounds like jealousy, that's hatred because they want to kill each other||
and be unhappy if anyone else pay attention to each other
that they only pay attention to each other
or maybe they have hatred to each other
AFFECTION
LOVE
can be like
no, it can mean a lot if they look at each other
with whatever that means
<:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
no they should look towards each other
idk it annoys me
instead of towards the reader
<:pepehands:744752920960172032>
I always prefer covers where they are looking at each other
and the reader is teh SI
<:vacantmamo:665896084358561812>
honestly with the way they are drawn I was expecting they would be harem members because they are looking at the reader
I mean I'm not sure if liking the boobs of someone else can be non-romantic <:brick:280095816121581589>
Reading through 86 really makes me hope the author will.be able to give a satisfying ending :s
Nah the ones who has imo is maria and geordo but maria should win :^) (but honestly the series is best not seen as "plot" kind of series, but as intercation between characters which is where it's charming as heck and why I still enjoy it. Also hoping fornmaria to win but this is the rare bisexual harem series to exist soooo)
https://mangadex.org/title/96471a2c-59f3-4a08-be7d-640bc0c022a4/may-i-please-ask-you-just-one-last-thing it's this
that one is great
Nvm then
<:XiaoThink:766742340860641310> oh
Accel World is the one where they use those crazy shoes right?
In general hypocrisy, flouting away the consequences, liars (although wven this is subset because if they are excellent manipulator I surprisingly end up liking them), etc is things I really hate
There's certain personality that I can't stand
It just depends om how they are
No
Uh
Just that I can't appreciate them
Not saying series is bad
It doesn't matter how they are down the line, if I can't enjoy them from the start I'm not going to finish it. I just dropped Alexandra Quick series even though itdc well written because the MC is a huge brat that makes me want to punch her
On MT, I'm one of those that didn't watch or read it even tho I do want to know the hullaballo, but I dislike a few things, its implications and the mc. And disling the mc pretty much mean the series just not going to be fun to go through, doesn't matter the rest of the characters and plots. Because you follow the mc and id you hate them it's just pretty much constantly seeing an annoying person while reading and probably will end with an anger and a huff :v
||and the whole implied yuri between elaina and her broom|| <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
does the anime has the part where the ||broom becomes human?||
~~I do like the story though~~
we just disagree with some things and agreeing on some like xc2 shouldn't have gacha <:coolfox:307701779641139201>
it's ok you are cool
rip
I mean I think I have a lot of disagreement with Aya a lot already even before this, it's fine, I just like to discuss sometimes <:badkekw:744699080839659711>
also I think one of the most obvious one where she can just leave off is... ||the one with the princess is the beast or something? My memories a bit vague there but I remember that one she can just leave instead of doing anything but instead she helped or something. _KINDA FORGOT TBH_||
was more of meaning that even if the upper part is burnt off, she probably can't eradicate every single roots
<:gasp:586922305515421709>
but tbh I agree with her that unless one is sure and _willing_ to handle what happens next. Don't do it
it'll be a problem for a while for sure, and besides how are we so sure the plants won't just grow back up <a:Chowyhehehe:860917008287006740>
majo no tabitabi is good :V elaina is fun and great protagonist and she's also surprisingly good person even if she hid it behind a lot of layers
the Games are very cool especially when there's forced ones :V
I read through mondaiji after watching the anime and it was great. I like the game system more there than NGNL because of how much they have to look between the rules <:KokoroLmao:641390803356483584>
one of the best bunny girl is from mondaiji tachi :V
and now there's like 2 extra volumes since I think tabitabi doesn't have s2 yet?
there's A  LOT lol
good, good
<:HYPER10MOLAPOG:713270385235329069>
there's the part where elaina saved the knight who forgets things after a day and that one was great as well
yeye. Hope you enjoy it <a:ArtiaThumbsUp:687600039945830458> but if you like elaina already honestly a lot of things are great there
honestly xc2 is those games that really encourage you to grind with the _auto_ system. I legit do a lot of stuff by do it and put it on my lap / on the side as I do my work <a:Chowyhehehe:860917008287006740>
oh there's already 5 books for elaina
you should. It's really fun and iirc the anime skips the whole volume 2 lmao
yeah can agree on that. I just spend my time a few hours farming common core and get as much blades as I wish to :V
I'm happy
also volume 6 is next month nice!!
(or buy digital version if you wish)
<:omori_pog:782989937150263296> do it
good nighto cypher
üò©
name's ominous
<:worryEyes:438351453669556234>
||but I do like her already from the start. Wish she's in full power modo more though <a:Pensivewayo:528038699292688394> ||
hey the cover is cool
>:V
YES THAT ONE IS GREAT. EVEN IF I FORGOT EVERYTHING BUT HEY DRAGONS <:brikdcana:287452290686648320>
wew
I need to reread mondaiji
<:worryEyes:438351453669556234>
that is very true
hey man
that part is very pog and hype
||that part where he fought against the azi dahaka||
my most remembered sequence is just
I don't remember either :V
||I wonder if NGNL is liked more is because of the 2 MCs being pretty much a huge hit for a lot of things <:brikdcana:287452290686648320> like neet, op, brocon/siscon, loli...||
I see
did it even make sense in the end
no, realist hero is the one isekai where he ends up building the kingdom and I think also a lot of machiavelli quotes
arriving tomorrow nice
woo
||that is true. But there's something about the empress... <a:KokoLove:616963783746650112> ||
yeah understandable
lmao
||isn't philine the mc if you play the game version tho||
smh üò§
||the mom is most interesting between them all :V||
||I want to pick the empress <:brikdcana:287452290686648320> ||
I hope that the arc 2's original game can exist <:Kappa:543946747907538944>
~~which I know can be dangerous, but just walking is boring so I'd rather read while walkking~~
I tend to read when I'm winding down before bed / walking to food place
<:pepehands:744752920960172032>
doyou find it easier to read like, in electronic form perhaps? <:XiaoThink:766742340860641310>
can't wait for 4th book
vol3 is so good <:pepehands:744752920960172032>
wow
Volume 3 is pretty good place to stop
Gud ash
<:blobteefsthumbsup:419320166447579156>
She's honestly charming that way
<a:45lul:590893369929105434>
_should have bought 100 more /s_
_I mean sometimes that's the only way to make sure it continues_
anime wages are pretty painful to see for sure
idk, but maybe no publicity is bad publicity or something
the fact it has anime altogether makes people know of the LN's existence as well
it just doesn't stick to my mind because of other things
the LNs are pretty good yeah
glad you do!
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
üò©
<:AranUwu:780821567080103947>
volume 2 iirc is almost full on new stories?
seems like you immediately devoured it
<:omori_pog:782989937150263296>
but it's probably deliberately left loose like that
more than 1 :^) /brikd
the manga is definitely on better side ye
üò©
but it could have been better
I guess. Just turns it into a regular yuri show when the original is already yuri show with horror with some other changes they made. <:AngeSigh:787120893356802088> I wanted to watch it then I heard the changes and it's just disappointing
More kozakura in LN
They ruined the pacing and order of events :s
Still cryinf at otherside picnic :c
Oh this also got anime now
https://twitter.com/SugoiLITE/status/1440621709090983946
it's definitely on the upper level of quality for sure. I want to punch the blonde hero though :V annoying shit that one is
<:pepehands:744752920960172032>
that's unfortunate
awe
<a:Pensivewayo:528038699292688394>
the fantranslation is a huge stall so I want the localization to pick up
heard there's some differences between LN and manga so I want to knoooow
yeah that one
I'm still hoping that princess x duke's daughter one with technological advances thingy will get localized <:NotLikeAtago:666111458504998933>
xd
that's the nice part of LNs imo, once you bought all the backlog, you really have time to save up to buy the next one
well bright side: It'll take a few more months before any new volumes are out
<:POGGERS:797340725565980683>
well even if S2 is there, I think they'll move to the next volumes after 3 too
<a:lae_pat:858067764610727966>
and that is understandable <:umu:361926169567690752>
imagine not wanting yuri smh
because for me adashima has such a BIG potential and then
||fuck that alien kid for keep ruining everything and she's just sucky to exist in the universe imo. This is SoL and there's no reason for that alien kid to even exist narratively. What she's used narratively can just be represented by the other 2 girls who is together. Also there's so much random rivalry going on that just annoys the hell out of me <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> ||
tfw I'm one of those that wants to like adashima but ends up completetly frustrated and hates it by now <:NTsad:864543779196370994>
Yessssss
Yes!
Aaaaaaaaaaa
https://twitter.com/yenpress/status/1441429733267460096
<:pepehands:744752920960172032>
ash reading more of elaina <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Sometimes some names are just annoying
Probably too used to the fanTL
I think that's the localized name. Which to me works out still. While anne-sophia fits pretty well I think that's not too bad and I'll get used to it
I like madoka but it's because of the dynamics between the characters especially homura and madoka :V
tried twice so far and stopped around episode 4
yuyuyu is good but idk why I never able to finish it
tbh I would say the fact machikado is good is that it's 4koma with plot <a:Chowyhehehe:860917008287006740>
considering the manga ||I wouldn't say it's no suffering though...||
hmmm
momo and shamiko are good pair
to answer I think it'll still go further ahead, or just it'll forever be hinted here and there like 300 years killing slime :V ... I haven't read volume 6 though. Will do soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
like it's great to read about benno's pov etc
the LNs best changes are additional povs
oh the WN's complete?
<:KokoroLmao:641390803356483584>
I was about to ask when it'll be over because it's still continuing even in JP and it's already 25 books
the LN can still go up and down depending on how it goes but so far it's 8+
ya, same score as what I feel right now
you feel the pain
it's average, but when you compare it to the LN
(I come to it from manga first btw, I found it got interesting worldbuilding from the manga, then some people comments on the LN's worldbuilding, so I pick up the LN and it's soooo much better) <:HAhaa:621866800078127165>
hopefully it's better than the manga adaptation
yeah
it's just painfully not as compellling
the manga, if I'm being generous is around 6, if not maybe 5
it's still faaaaaaaaaaar better
on the great side, not sure if it'll be superb but
when the LN is definitely on the 8+ scale
like the manga is just average
I'm still annoyed that executioner's manga adaptation is terrible compared to the LN
there's a lot more manga for yuri, but there's some excellent yuri LNs
<:Yansive:800798742566797322>
I have read a lot that I need more
finishing neo twewy in fact makes me thirst for more yuri
maybe I should drop the broken earth trilogy for a bit and finish reading elaina
hype
<:SakuyaStronk:661255469570064405>
the part with the wand is a üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è but I like it still
one of my favorite part I think is the ones where ||the broom comes back to life :V||
gogo. Elaina is very easy to just chow through in a few hours xd
Pretty enjoyable and got all the usual flavors although one is a bit... Hmm... But the rest is good
Woohoo finally done with elaina book 6
I just have some feels that lowers my enjoyment after volume 8 :S the wordsmithing itself is still very good though
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>
IcIc
Vol 8 is very far into the future since season 2 iirc is going to be vol 2 and 3?
I saw some 86 discussion, I wish I can discuss my feels after vol 8 but I think I'll have to wait again <:AmiyaSad:650829701530779667>
||I don't remember much of everyone else's either||
||like I pretty much forgot who dies except for fido because fido is non human and is a dog and so unique||
yes
but then again my memories bad
tfw I forgot who the person is already
<:pepehands:744752920960172032>
||Fido is honestly very good||
||Fido... <:kel_sniff:821363824711041065> ||
<:ZoomEyes:340489686285942796>
idk what that is
tfw erased again my 86 feels. I'll just wait <:kel_sniff:821363824711041065>
they are supposed to be both protagonist
like man, I know shin's the protagonist, with everything's going on, but Lena's more interesting one to go on
also lena's the best character in the series who should be the pov character more often instead of relegated to the side
just be like me and forgets everyone except _very_ few characters
yeah, but those are still pretty good.
like, the rest is good, but 1 has the tightest feel of all
I think 1 is the best
overall on that part ||pretty much everyone condemns what they are doing anyway, and outright calls what they are doing being delusional||
personally I think 86 engage with those points far better than a lot of other things that try to do that <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
I can't speak spanish so I have no idea lol
hmm
some has volume 8 and 9 spoiler and then 10's drama CD
and 1 of them in mandarin
7 of them in spanish
LMAO only 8 fics
not sure if elaina got the fics
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
the one elaina most likely to end up with is the broom tbh, just need to perma change her
I also honestly really like elaina's relationship with her broom XD
aww
~~yes I'm still salty that executioner's manga adaptation is pretty average~~
or average
<:Yansive:800798742566797322>
just a case of adaptation making the original seems bad
yeah it's unfortunate because the original is very quality
it's fine, I just feel sad that the adaptation can be better and they didn't
<a:ArtiaThumbsUp:687600039945830458>
They kinda ruined the horror vibe and also ruined the order of events :v
Far worse
Worse than the LN
Otherside Picnic - pretty much my favorite one
Executioner and Her Way of Life - this might be isekai, but it's still superb and it got good worldbuilding and I love the relationship going on
Girl's Kingdom - if you want something lighthearted this is for you, it's pretty much just maid x their mistresses so... yeah. But overall it's more towards something light
Roll Over and Die - more gore focused and such, but still it got really good beats in plots and stuff. Not isekai, but has stat-based things going on
that's what they did from the start
<:NTsad:864543779196370994>
||I'm so sad when I find out|| <:kel_sniff:821363824711041065>
man
oh yeah that cursed girl in the forest
elaina vol 6 <:AranUwu:780821567080103947>
yeah otherside manga is definitely up there at least
any servant who is female to male genderbend in fate? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@!87512939107450880> or <@!279341087494242304> you two around? Have a fate question <:XiaoThink:766742340860641310>
ÔΩèÔΩà„ÄÄÔΩóÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩî
god sucks in greek
<:GilLul:585944327042105346>
maybe?
huh
üò©
d'eon is kinda more like inbetween though, since iirc even irl is also like that
minotaur üò©
yeah
not europa's probably but I know that greek stuff in general is
I know cypher lol
<:NTthonk:776061145949536277> ic ic
rude
wow poseidon wtf
<:Yansive:800798742566797322>
>tfw canon genderbend
>fgo didn't do it
damn
<:rip:308515173537284097>
rather than the other way around
well there's some isekai where it's for poking criticism in isekai I guess <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796> JK Haru...
like I don't mind isekai, bookworm is super amazing and it's one of those that really don't work if it's not isekai. There's also Executioner which is another amazing isekai
I guess that might be it
lmao
babies are good at that <:brikdcana:287452290686648320>
eh I mean, it's born as a baby, and then he explore the outside world because they were isolated for a long time, is pretty natural. It's just that the first part of baby part is... doesn't really feel like it needs to be from another world I guess
nah, this one is pretty strong on exposition since the tradition and stuff in this one is pretty different and all
if you read it, that thought will not change. It's pretty awesome but there's really no reason to be isekai, although I guess his reasoning at the start is one?
kinda the same for me
besides it's not like I'm the same excited as with watching anime so it's
I usually just excitedly talk about a certain scene
just examples
I can't really focus for anime, but I can focus for reading
because there's a difference between reading and watching
also people's 10/10 is different
although I can't comment on prisma ilya and VE because I haven't touched both
I don't really agree with any of these but then again it's other people's opinion so it's shrug
I mean 10/10 is just what oneself consider masterpiece so it just depends on everyone
<:PepeLaugh:580592928703905792>
I still wait for the full release though
yeah j-novel do things like this, it's pretty cool
visuals and voices actually can limit the words imo
no?
uh
romance with some fantasy spice
yeah if you want romance it should be good
hear it's actually pretty sweet, I just can't after a bit of things

no isekai
no, not isekai maou
I gave that manga about demon lord picking up slave elf girl thing because there's a dynamic I want to explore with it, but I can't take the way it's written there after a bit so I just gave up on it. A friend still finds it super fluffy and cute and that's alright
what i dislike doesn't mean others should dislike it
yes, that's why I always insist on things being personal level
I have been reading this one quest with outright eroge abilities happening and the writing is good but I continue to feel complicated about it
I just have complicated feelings about it, especially when it's one guy with a lot of girls
it doesn't equate to bad
~~still feel that harem without the harem liking one another, or without the harem being a combination of genders are cowards~~
big boobs and harem tend to be a huge minus tbh for me...
some HP fics I still find to be better
it's coming of age story but with magic no?
in general I do look that things that go super popular tend to be... not as good as the less popular? ü§î not sure how to explain, and it doesn't mean that good stuff can't get super popular. It's just that there's a certain level of things before they got super diluted to really be liked by a lot of people
in terms of fans
I'm pretty sure LotR isn't as huge as harry potter
ü•≤
some LNs and novels
I did too
wreck my heart with a knife-- /brikd
<:brikdcana:287417418920361984>
get your heart wrecked in different way!
yeah both visual and words have different things they can hit you
```"the meal tasted the same way an industrial logging operation sounded"
"the diagram looked something similar to the concerning sensation of drowning"
"her ears were assaulted with the color neon blue blended with the iron taste of blood"``` this example is still one I think can be "felt" through text, but I'm not sure how visual will do it
like there's some things that can be written, but I don't think it can be explained visually? or at least it's difficult
although I do wonder of how some stuff can be shown through visual
since those tend to not be shown in visual mediums
also I think works where written works do better is ones where we also focused on the feelings of the characters
~~horror is better with less description <:CrispyDrunkNetzach:729769318530809937> ~~
some stuff is better with more description, some stuff is better with less
~~follow the rabbit down the hole~~ <:brikdcana:287452290686648320>
except just follow the words and see where it brings you
not sure what else to do
I mean I also don't really imagine things? Like examples of like, people say "don't think of pink elephants", and I just... think of the *words*. I don't think of the exact elephant animal. I just have the words floating in my head. My imagination's there, occasionally. But it's just... mutable, I would say
huh, unfortunate then :(
I thought they only did that for the first one?
that one
ahhhh
they changed from delrey?
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368> that's really unfortunate
that's why when people write, they tend to be told, "don't go and list the character's physical characteristic" (and I actually find if a story went "yeah I have super HOT bod with long, blue hair, and narrowed red eyes" is weird)
that's actually the reasoning?
the fact mental image is different from one another is
it feels like that
like there's some things I find super good, but then I saw that the popular one is this shitty #89 LN about isekai'd boy who ends up getting op power and a harem
I just say they have tendency, not hard rule :V
but nonetheless if anyone wants to read a black comedy with strong mc and also going to magical school but it's SUPER dangerous magical school, try to pick up Scholomance series by Naomi Novik <a:eyesshaking:896586121000124447>
Eragon and Eldest are still the best part of that quartet
I have always been avid reader, starting from comic book then it's novels... I think my first one was Eragon? Or at least that's one of my first owned novels
<:Yansive:800798742566797322>
yeah fuck school
scholomance is one of the best recent novel I read
if I stop reading because some authors make their story boring then I would have never found a lot of great works
realist hero is decent, it just went uh... harem for some reason. Not sure how I'll feel if I reread it now, but I remember reading first 2 novels super back then and it was ok? kinda there
not sure if it'll go realist hero
I mean I read executioner and it was pretty good
hopefully it'll be better
isekai can be good tool
https://yenpress.com/9781975337803/the-magical-revolution-of-the-reincarnated-princess-and-the-genius-young-lady-vol-1-novel/ still can't wait for this <:Yansive:800798742566797322>
~~alright I'm very cnfused from that video kek~~
watch princess principal <:HibikiDab:688190074395164696>
good discussion <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
icic :V well I just remember up to volume 2 so I won't comment on it much
<:rip:308515173537284097>
Pretty sure the main pair is the 2 scientists
This one went yuri?
pog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NakocJ9Ky0I here's the one with EN sub
Naruhodo
Ohisee
Yeah it's not outsourced
Will AK anime be good
The question is
Of pay and workload
It's pretty much sweatshop or nearly sweatshop level
That's an understatement
for bookworm
they pretty much juggle 3 things to translate, and I hear each part of J-Novel is still pretty thicc
the TL is nuts
https://twitter.com/Mr_Quof/status/1324046139486855169 lmao I mean
we are already halfway through the books already out in JP iirc
they release a book about bookworm around every 1-2 months
https://twitter.com/Daiz42/status/1452679686836862982 bookworm has one of the fastest LN releases indeed
vol 3 continues to be better imo
if you compare their thiccness...
so they are pretty madlad
<a:moneywhale:704285917929537648>

ez
you sell gold
it's gold coin
and she can easily flip back and forth between earth and the other world
nah, there's that isekai where the gal uses the other world to get money
Another is that in general, when I see reverse harems, guys don't lose competencies but the girls do <:Yansive:800798742566797322>
I think the big reason I don't like regular harem is that it tends to turns women into merely sex object (?) That their value lies in them liking the mc
that one is great
like the harem like the one the emperor has in Apothecary Diaries?
I just don't like them on meta analysis
where all the girls are just 1D personality where they love this one guy for some reason or another (not all harems are like this, but I'm sure a lot of them are like this)
more fun than the current harems
hey man, imperial china harem is
nah I just kinda don't like it in general as well. Some guilty pleasure in another way but honestly I just prefer that they don't really exist <:CrispyDrunkNetzach:729769318530809937>
~~rather wish the harem doesn't exist~~
childhood friend winning
ic
<:tamawut:585823303772667904>
*looks at smartphone isekai*
isn't there the classroom of the elite or something
there's a lot of isekai where there's geniuses
it's "cute" but like, there's no substance
and I didn't enjoy <:Yansive:800798742566797322>
I gave this and the author's Make My Ability Average a try
pretty boring for my taste
stuff
so it's uh
well it's funa
<:MarisaSmart:430234216035254272>
just be bi
then again I think you get some sort of harem in re zero
what if it's Re Zero isekai millh
I want that recipe to success üò©
Granted in that case it's picking 1 instead of all
Just read otome VNs
which is fine, everyone has their preferences
they are slower than reading, and yet also takes more attention kind of situation
i just find watching is far more taxing in term of attention
for me it's... novel / LNs > manga >>> anime
will become literal moonrunes then :^)
in general LNs are just rarer to be seen around unless online
because some publishers want to wait for physical >.>
although I do hear some recent LN problems are more of because the publishing is very, very backlogged
yen press takes forever to release >:(
bofuri is up to volume 3, whatever that means
let me check how far is LN
the scanlation of the manga is right there, the machine god part
this doesn't feel like a series that need to have all the extra explanations
I might try to read the LN but not sure if I want to do it when I'm already following the manga
yes, manga is reading
I didn't touch anime at all since animes are harder to focus on than books
man I never knew maple becomes gundam <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
like fantasy got its trope for example, chosen one. There's a lot of 'chosen one' kind of story (tbh i would say even isekai really run on chosen one territory)
and tropes aren't bad, it's just another tool
you can, there's reasons why tropes exist
[continues recommending bookworm to das intensifies]
the reason she's so ||strong in magic is also explained super well|| so i like it
i still really like myne too, even if she's whiny at the start but it be like that <a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
that's one of the isekai that imo is really unique and really work on the fact it's isekai for it to work
try out Ascendance of a Bookworm
~~I still feel sad that NGNL is more famous than mondaiji~~
i hope executioner got good adaptation :S
i find madoka more hooking to me than yuyuyu as i finished madoka while still unable to finish yuyuyu the two times i tried it
a lot of good and bad ones
still like hao more though
such a laidback guy
yoh asakura <:uoooooh:864704745662709782>
Worm is in my read list for sure
:V
it's already hard enough to find female mc stuff that fits what I like without this happening
ugh
because if you ask me the girl in the cover is super cute
they are legit bait
üò©
90% of the time, a female cover is just front for male mc
pretty good and the characters are solid
I read it through in one go, and I don't remember anymore but it overall hits me harder iirc
scum's wish at least really gut punch you
the yuri doesn't really save it, and the story doesn't really hits hard beyond "yeah everybody here is an asshole I can't care less for"
netsuzou trap is better but tbh in the end it's kinda pretty eh overall
instead it's the straightest NTR imaginable with the guy getting the most beautiful girl in school
if this went from het to gay NTR it would have been interesting lol
I follow the manga and it's nice one <a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
if it ever gets anime, that one "Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie" is a good one
non non biyori is pretty cute too isn't it
kase-san i think is also another nice one? i think that one also has anime?
the manga is great
IFTV is great
<:heh:904986004212039691>
that one kinda gets repetitive for me after a bit, but when it's nice, it's nice. The spin off is good too, focusing on belzeebub
<:SiatanFeelsBad:712457386488758312>
It's not as bad as watching eragon vs the novel but it's kinda like that
Not good enough
The problem is sometimes the adaptation is just
<:heh:904986004212039691>
A lot of terrible times to bw had
Niceness as in quality
<:CrispyDrunkNetzach:729769318530809937>
I knew this because I read the manga first
For now I would say the manga is tragically doesn't rrally show the niceness that is in the LN
```An¬†anime¬†television series adaptation by¬†J.C.Staff¬†will premiere in 2022.```
Should be soon
<:blobsmiletear:676123774369923092>
The manga adaptation was meh compared to the LN
Still fingers crossed that executioner adaptation will be nice
<:DoremySmug:689958198039281782>
tsun male elf is fun too
I also find faraway paladin pretty nice <a:Dorimelapp:832812484494622754>
imo read the LN üëÄ
<:CoolShion:689958199750557769>
hey man, I can't deny shilling that series
bookworm is pretty much one of my favorite, and I really goddamn love executioner
while there's a lot of bad stuff in isekai, I don't think I agree that isekai is bad overall. There's still some good stuff out of there (even if I still can't like the core of MT at itself, and so I won't argue about its quality or not) that is within isekai
For me SoL kinda needs a certain plots to hook me up. Or I just get bored eventually... Although good chars and such can work though
<:CrispyDrunkNetzach:906007277096542299>
Come from isekai
I have some hope now
Woah. That looks pretty nice
So hype though
It's very spoopy ye
holy shit it just looks INCREDIBLE <:HahaSweat:799121753540395009>
Otherside Picnic Volume 7 Cover
Rip
<:RosThink:826566635313299466>
It wasn't until thw anime came out people said about the ecchi parts
And since no one ever commented on it I don't remember
I just really don't remember them
Huh
I actually don't remember mieruko having ecchi in the manga?
the manga is really good
meanwhile mage and demon queen <:badkekw:744699080839659711>
if takt doesn't have the girl's love can it even be compared to symphogear <:CrispyDrunkNetzach:729769318530809937>
too many islands in SEA
comic = komik
pelawak is a comedian
everything not series
I think the physical book version just takes forever to come out because there's a huge backlog going on for everything
but I hope we'll see more ||broom or wand turning humans in the future :)||
elaina *can't* change too much
it's more of selling the constant adventuring
i don't think she'll ever change that much, the aim of the novel isn't some sort of self growth after all
comparison with LN btw

(it's very good comparison vs the LN)
Otherside Picnic newest chapter in manga. Totally normal things to say in a dialogue box, trust <:DoremySmug:689958198039281782>
gotcha
this one is also nice
if you want light novel
https://j-novel.club/series/girls-kingdom oh yeah
alright I put links for all 3 things I recommended
https://mangadex.org/title/4bc3e522-0301-467e-827c-eb2984ec8a79/kami-eshi-jk-to-ol-fujoshi this one is also surprisingly nice even with the age gap
https://mangadex.org/title/b77668ed-0810-4327-9684-46ca371e370e/the-two-of-them-are-pretty-much-like-this this one is also pretty good
have you seen Hana ni Arashi? It's good manga https://mangadex.org/title/bc86a871-ddc5-4e42-812a-ccd38101d82e/hana-ni-arashi
also if you have android I suppose you can just use tachiyomi
the UI still works though?
and dynasty-scans but dynasty I just read through nearly everything so I assume new updates are something I follow lol
I only read them on mdex
or until next updated I guess
<:MHXAsmart:585932532764115175>
just like it then forget until next month
I really lik ehow true it is that they are tolerant... when no one is like that near them
I like it
that one looks interesting iski
ho
these two are gay for one another
mfw
gotcha <:naruhodo:530610258822037504> should be put in my future list of watching then
does gridman or dynazenon are kinda yuri ü§î
<a:aHaatoNotLikeThis:728378116841406525>
üòî
baiting
üëÄ
for me it's their intimacy that is important, ones that is so close that it's more than families
<a:LuciaCheeks:710441879883350056>
||agreed, kissing will be great||
<:hmmThinkers:860882439513440256>
spoilers: ||no||
bigger spoilers, like this time serious: ||doesn't trusting someone so deeply you allow them access to the energy in your soull more intimate?||
man I can give examples on why I consider it yuri but it's spoilers hmm <:hmmThinkers:860882439513440256>
I quite have the wide net for yuri, as I accept something like homura/madoka ü§î
executioner is very yuri I don't know how else to say it. I mean I guess they don't really say I love you to one another but does it mean it's not yuri?
I hope the anime will be good since it does have a lot of action scenes
executioner is pretty good yuri
that one is pretty nice but it's also jumping around a lot üòî
seesh, where's my sweet couple times
yeah I was a bit tired of stories ending rightafter the main couple hook up
granted I guess this thing is 16 volumes :V
https://mangadex.org/title/8d2e6257-a8c2-4a82-9982-244157181ba4/ookami-heika-no-hanayome (the ookami I was meaning)
it went from them not having relationship (well, fake one), into real one and how that goes
Ookami is pretty good example I think
tbh I would love stuff like She's Not Just Cute or Ookami or Hana ni Arashi where it's their relationship that's the focus (after they get together)
finally :V
useless princesses üò©
might also be tired of that being together is the endgame lol
reading it feel like 1 step forward 2 steps back tbh <:shrug:582298635622940685>
otherside imo is pretty slowburn on the novel (-ish?) but overall thanks to the horror vibe going on and the real plot going on, I still love it as much
no
yeahhhh
slow burn is fine I think, I just feel like when it's SoL slow burn where things aren't happening between the two AND YET STILL HAVING THE NORMAL HIJINKS
too many minus point
hhhh
the fact LOVE RIVALS STILL EXIST
their date got disturbed
I don't mind it not being explicit, as it's obvious they kinda will end up together it's just
I figure 4 volumes are enough to give it a chance
granted I only read to volume 4 but that's enough for me to get annoyed <:shrug:582298635622940685>
I think my problem with adashima is
- alien existing (she's annoying because she can't just be ignored by her crashing into dates and such)
- there's also love rivals still going on, and with the glacial pace, makes it _annoying_
still don't get why that alien exist
adashima can be good if they get rid of that alien <:CrispyDrunkNetzach:729769318530809937>
üôè
sad
i hope it'll be yuri
I guess I can give it a try maybe <:blobteefs:356265467905572867>
this one right ü§î
wait I think this one has a LN? ü§î
`Princess Principal` and `Flip Flappers` are the ones I'm recommending since those two are recent favorites. Pripri's movie is so good too <:uWu:794552103577321512>
Fucking cheat and then an asshole on top
Still fuck him lol
Yes he's ded now
He's so reprehensible
Also fuck rahl
We'll see
(o.o
||Cyrene ||is super cute at least
Ah
How far is the manga?
Oh I'm reading through the LN so probably blew through the manga
I'm still sad over what happenrd eith ||cyrene :( she doesn't deserve that||
:pray;
She's very vehement on not liking guys that way afterall
Hope this means yuri :^)
üò©
waiting for 7 movies seems to be too long of a wait considering it's like 1 movie per year or two
<a:ThumbsUpanim:397545048910069761>
you havel ike 5 or 6 chaps to go through then ikxi
so goooood
ye ikxi new chapter
üò≠
ancient magus' bride why do you end this chapter on a huge cliffhanger
gaaaah
I played on easy so don't ask me intricacies
Gameplay is ok
I enjoyed the story and date and stuff
Very nice
Never played first but 2nd one is
Tfw the 2nd game is so good
üëÄ
Blue Reflection
Also just finished reading 2nd book of heroking genderbent and hm
||i think the hieral menace's sickness can be somehow the reason why prismer exist and that prism beast is actually from highland? Not sure but I somehow got the feels||
Other than that... ||Man I hope rin will regain herself because she's good. Rafinha with rin/cyrene will be great||
Or too long rambly thing that needs an editor
I'm pretty sure the overall thing on the series is that if you are on the mc's side, you are good all the way and if you aren't then you are bad all the way and that's it
ugh
well on last part I would say that can happen pretty naturally, humans can be weird like that, but yeah, on the overall level it's just
like I was meaning in narrative sense, it's set up to make it so that naofumi is the best
that the other heroes are trash and like, fuck them
is for "he's the best"
he's ok, but the way the narrative is done
<:DoremySmug:689958198039281782>
shield hero is just everyone else sucks, now look at naofumi he's the best
she's dutiful af
the girl hero is pretty nice
eeeh, the fact it's well written for me means it's above the rabble
the only thing that I really say no on is the other male hero because that guy is PoS but other than that it's pretty decent to good work for me
ü§î
yeah, he has to put it in floating subtitle box for people to know what he's talking about
that might be it
:X
I did hear the anime skipped some of the nice character moments between each other
oh
I read the manga and I think it's pretty decent? Like the focus is more on demihumans, the world itself doesn't shy away from how sucky the goddess is...
Ic
not sure what it's translated as for the anime
ah this is the name for manga
Tsuki ga Michibiku Isekai Douchuu
I hope you are watching the tsuki-something thing üò§ one of the decent one around
I just can't get over the one thing and it annoys me
something I will love
but yea the series honestly looks like
<:heh:904986004212039691>
same thing ish
well watch
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
you read so many isekai with male protag ash
I still need to read the LN but just really not in a mood for male protag
<:thumb:386185026582347791>
oh well
https://twitter.com/Daiz42/status/1335653730679730176 here's the thread if you want to see what they says ash
Like one of the best LN around according to the guy who talks about it
Reign of 7 spellblades I hear is really good
https://www.bookdepository.com/search?searchTerm=otherside+picnic&search=Find+book the place I know for physical of it
yeah, so 3 books for all 6
combination of book 1 and 2, book 3 and 4, and 5 and 6
Well last time I searched anyway
The physical for otherside iirc is also all omnibuses
I think
10 bucks ish
I thought the prices are the same-ish
the more I hear it the sadder it becomes <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I still don't get why they changed the order of the cases <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
the events are faithfully adapted, so I think it's pretty decent one to get into, but I think it still doesn't really manage to get into the sorawo's narration? ü§î <@!297542051057238017> I think you can talk better about it here
it's way ahead
manga is already 6 volumes and only finishing volume 2 of LN
LN is volume 6 already
I think so far it's 6 or 7 volumes and they are only finishing volume 2 of LN?
the manga is far longer than the LN in term of volumes
uhhh
what I hear is that the unfortunate part is that they didn't change the narration to have sorawo voice instead at the minimum (the whole LN is pretty much narrated by sorawo and you can really feel her character from the way she's written which I think is a ++)
like if a volume doesn't end with sorawo randomly narrating "gah, you are too beautiful and distracting toriko!" somewhere I don't believe it's a part of the story <:CrispyDrunkNetzach:729769318530809937>
it _is_ yuri
hey otherside picnic did have them kissing ||at like, volume 4 and such <:heh:904986004212039691> ... their relationship is hard to define though, but honestly if the two of them aren't in love with one another I'll eat tissues||
although executioner is pretty gay? Not sure if the gayness is up to what you wanted but for the level of gay I like that one fits
no, no gay yumi
well on that part, a lot of these revenge stories are dumb on that <:CrispyDrunkNetzach:729769318530809937> (well, not only revenge stories because I just finished reading the one where they thought healers+buffer are weak because they are on the back and so killed her)
:(
why do most adaptations suck
the life of having to care for friendship
the type of romance stories like in normal romance stories I guess
or like uh
if you like romance-focused stories you should try it out
it's still well done but like, the drama is part of the story, on how the relationship unfolds
it's romance drama
yeah, but then again I'm always a sucker for 2 lovers going off on adventure / and the other is because of the deep love (not soulmates exactly too, so even better)
yagakimi is pretty  nice yuri romance but I'll put otherside over it üëÄ (and executioner). Like it's welldone but it's not the best (?)
<a:NODDERS:916381296622698606> glad you enjoyed it~
well I won't say she stumble onto op bullshit ||and more of because what we see is her after the massive grinding lol||
just in case
also leadale is pretty ok from the LN, as long as you enjoy kinda OP mc enjoying life situation
the femc becomes weak imo but I finished it anyway :V
koroshi ai was decent but it becomes kinda normal romance with a killer kind of thing
bofuri is not bad when I read through the LN
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
They are so cute
Same me too
<:ElMolaPOG:717647049033646131>
I don't really like him on the overall level <:45shrug:618620359750713344> but it's hard for me to explain why I don't really like him, considering depending on things happening, ||I do like manipulative characters a lot.||
or manipulative people :V
or people who are bad
it's ok to like villains people
overall I just more of don't get why people think his action is good towards the girls when ||he has been specifically saying he did all that to manipulate them into loving him and such. Intent is pretty important as well. He 100% didn't help them because he thought it's good to help, he only help them because they are useful in his assassinations.||
I forgot his reasoning on who he kill though, but assassination is both easy to end up used against good people and not only bad ones :V
I think he's more of necessary evil than good
because the latter is like kinda good guy from what I remember but the former is from what I remember is eh, ||pretty sure he's manipulative guy, just that he did it "good" and so that is good someway or another||
this is the one where he got reincarnated to be best assassin and not the one where he's like, awesome guy who wants to be shadow lord or something and got a harem out of it
||uh yes doing those can be counted as one depending on how you did that and your words and what you do? (yeah it's good deed, but that doesn't mean it CAN'T be brainwashing through good deeds and manipulation).

It's different brand than the classic 'OHOHOH YOU ARE A WEAPON AND IF YOU DISOBEY YOU ARE IN A WORLD OF PAIN', but it's still one||
I count it as different world tbh (although in this way it means I don't agree that inuyasha is an isekai)
<:Thonk:310617895312818187>
Moon isn't different world
ah
I don't even know who <:ZoomEyes:340489686285942796>
once again I'm reminded that GL stuff doesn't really get much traction and money ü•≤ (I have a friend in WN business kind and they told me that GL doesn't even have top 100 while BL still have some)
<:mirrorforce:372204480105807872>
no u
Watching is cringer what are you talking about <:kappa:430211543330848770>
Or be western comics
The LN illustrations got some colors- (which I never see becausw BW ereader)
Smh <:blobcatpensive:380419932820733953>
Read bookworm :v
It s e l l s
Unfortunately people want the formulaic self insert :v
Recency bias is real
She's good too but I don't remember rayearth anymore after reading the manga a few years ago
S-ranked adventurer daughter is better <:pepehands:744752920960172032>
<:Madge:915738184372088853>
And then end result is marriage between them
The father daughter interaction was decent
~~still mad at that one~~
Hopefully doesn't end up like that guy who marries his adopted daughter manga/LN series :v
||I guess that's only felt after a while then. I knew first few chapters are very eh and considering I don't like how the story shapes up... ~~seems classic isekai harem with assassination setup from what I see~~||
Myne from Bookworm is the best isekai protagonist
||ehhh. He can probably do more on the interaction? I remember he was more of encouraging their feelings though instead of nothing. But remember I only read first few chapter of the manga and I got the feeling it's pretty eh and he got to the sleazy feelings.
~~tbh if it ends up with him setting them up to have their own lives than tied to him irrevocably and also ending up having a harem i would have liked it better~~ but probably different genre||
They are good from my friend's opinion so... Besides first season was decent from what I remember
Show by Rock?
tru
like so goood
more things happening and the other aubs not taking things lying down and POLITICS and stuff
I love this series
goooood
AAAAAAAAAAAAA FINISHED ANOTHER BOOK OF BOOKWORM
if it's not dragged out maybe I'll give it another chance but we'll see I guess
it's only 4 chapters right now you can give it a try yumi
(vira / katalina from gbf kinda hits it pretty well <:lazykyaa:341438898271944715> )
I like crazy obsessive type in certain ways that this one doesn't fulfill
then again I think I just find love rivals annoying stuff
idk why I just find her so unlikable <:shrug:582298635622940685>
Just disliking the character too much
Not the matter of poly
üò©
I don't like the other gal and so drops it
Oh this one
Gay
https://dynasty-scans.com/series/please_bully_me_miss_villainess_novel_ver
<:CrispyDrunkNetzach:729769318530809937>
aka they are in screenshots
dynasty scans
üò©
when the heroine helps to bully herself
Scarlet and the main MC (tfw forgot her name)
But the MCs are great
Uhhh not gay
Scarlet from Holy Grail of Eris is best villainess
This one is pretty good
Soonderay
it's just that I don't remember it existing
I mean it's not that it can't exist
heck, i favor the villainess is also good
(paladin, accomplishment of duke's daughter, bookworm, executioner, just for what I remember off my head)
lots of boring stuff yeah, but there's a lot of crazy good stuff
while isekai at least got stuff that interest me
yeah I legit don't remember anything from battle harem time because from what I remember they are all just harem stuff with some actions and so never took my interest

2 girls getting it on > 1 guy for some reason getting all the girls
<a:nomnom:772503915139825684>
I don't demand much
battle school animes don't have yuri while isekai at least got yuri, winning <:wokemamo:747664272955277382>
tbh I can't ship everyone with chris, only tsubasa and maria (kinda)
eh
I don't think that is battle harem though ü§î
<:CrispyDrunkNetzach:729769318530809937>
at least there's some yuri isekai, I don't think I see yuri battle harem with yuri as a focus
unfortunately if I want horny I have very specific tastes that I'm sure these stuff won't fulfill
``` received through the act of breastfeeding.``` wtf
yeah sounds like crippling myself better not go in
>the other 9/10
I forgot
the different world where it's magic or tech
but yea just doesn't seem fun if I can't get in another half because I don't want male mc
well ok I can't say it's too much when I'm following bookworm
but for now it's too much
I mean if I'll pick up the series I'll look at everything
even worse <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
index is a maybe to pick up, I'm still not even in a mood for male mc as seen as I haven't even pick up reign of 7 spellblades üò≠
why should I try out something I'm not sure to like <:kekw:744698885573705758>
but then again it's anime only so maybe the LNs better buuuuut ehhhhhhhh
I mean a lot of people I know and trust on their opinions also on the irregular is bad so lol
is thiiiis that one where it's uhhh, I vaguely remember there was one where the female characters are all tend to end up as guy's slaves situation and then this one female mc end up managing to upend the situation and such?
it just means it's mainstream imo
I mean I don't really trust sales on term of goodness lol
irregular is kinda boring from what I see off the summary? op guy etc, etc bleh
duke's daughter is also het
bookworm is SoL ||and will end with a het, I know who she ends up with after I looked for the spoiler||, paladin is... with no one I think
and my example of isekais aren't all yuri too so
so <:shrug:582298635622940685>
<:CrispyDrunkNetzach:729769318530809937>
go read bookworm LN
ÔΩìÔΩçÔΩà
everyone falls into the hole
(for me)
magic > tech
<:GretaThonk:899130339048452126>
lmao
this series continue to be blessed <:Prayge:916387476212437022>
https://dynasty-scans.com/series/please_bully_me_miss_villainess_novel_ver this one
ahh
The manga has (trigger warning) ||rape|| but I hear it's scrubbed out in anime <a:ablobthinkingfast:396521773622886403>
I hear kannazuki's anime is better than the manga
but the LN is just light years ahead lol
the manga so far has been decent adaptation for the series
like you can feel the pressure
(bookworm) the artist managed to do this scene really well <a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
do her brain lol
like instead of omni narrator
I don't even know why they don't do sorawo as narrator in the anime

(I'm not going to say eat my hat, but throwing away indomie is worse punishment anyway)
like nearly all her comments, if it's not sorawo liking toriko (and toriko's action to sorawo isn't liking her back), I will throw away my indomie
lol at sorawo almost constantly saying how attractive toriko is
the novel (and manga) is kinda more obvious about that
well
<@!297542051057238017> can back me up on the quality of the novel kek
I pray it to be good
the anime...
the manga is... very average
the novel is good
I guess summer it is
<:pepehands:744752920960172032>
is executioner not for winter?
huh
Ah spring
solo pls
üòî
shikimori getting adaptation üëÄ
https://twitter.com/anime_shikimori/status/1478576996091375620
leadale was decent, pupil of the wiseman... it's fun but i wish ||there's more summoning parts because honestly big reason I went into it is that||, bookworm's great, executioner great ü§î decent cast of isekai. Bofuri's also pretty fun i suppose
idk it's just weird feels
I mean it's pretty decent but
üò©
depends on how it's done I guess? Although I have lowered my standards a lot that I already accepted the hero-king into overpowered squire
menou pls do your job /s
I think momo proclaims her feelings a bit?
the constant narration of sorawo thinking toriko is too beautiful was gone! dangit anime üò©
well I know some of people here are like, if they aren't kissing they aren't gay/yuri, despite the fact the strong feelings are there

(although ok, some stuff like the adaptation cutting out a lot of the narration that WAS there)
there
just not classic yuri I guess
it's still yuri üòî
Now rhey just need to not fuck up!
It is cool!
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
Things be fucked
üò©
Hopefully will be good
So after this set
imagine not counting the sources
at the rate things are going it probably will get anime in x years or something
she didn't become a spider, she just becomes a spider kingdom's leader :V
yeah that one ash said
the spider I think is a zerg rush faction
the girl who ends up becoming spider kingdom leader thing
the one with zerg rush kinda went eh for me
it's a good way to bring the conflict of the prince
like the fact the other girl is a high schooler who is used to have parents / older than her decide for her and so she ends up passive even though she doesn't really know it
also the way the other girl is set up I think it builds off more seamlessly with isekai'd
i need to read the LN but since I also read the WN a bit for that one it's all muzzy
omnipotent saint is pretty good from what I remember off the manga
can't remember off the top of my head but I know I dropped some
there's some sucky female protagonist isekai too
noooot always? ü§î
MAR too
flame of recca is great
eh
just like everything else
isekai has possibility of good
It's surprisingly straightforward on people interacting with online game
Ye
also the fact she got ||more children|| than bf / wife is tbh pretty fun to read
yeah leadale is pretty nice and comfy overall
yea I finished first chapter it's pretty cute
after 3rd book I think it has some mystery going on though
leadale is just mc doing things and be op, if that's what you seek, then yes it's pretty nice
hated the guy too much
but yea I guess I can't talk on it too much since I dropped it after first chapter anyway
different message
oh wait
I mean in that case isn't it more likely to think that cutting it short is better ü§î
well that first chapter is pretty funny
(I like long hairs and I tend to not think on the logistics of cleaning it without magic while making some characters, so yes)
I somehow feel that's handwaved by the author liking long hair
üò© dammit mdex why is your search still sucky
I tried searching it it doesn't come out :V
tfw not on mdex
"son"
lol
for bookworm her gender is really mattering. If she's a guy she won't need to worry about some stuff tbh :V the fact she's a girl makes it so that she has to end up being married lol
but I can't find it
that one is amazingly funny
I still can't find the 2 guys crossdresses as girls and they end up liking one another so it ends up as yuri / yaoi at once manga again üò©
oh <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
not sure if i'll read it but i wonder if it exist
do wonder if there's any girl got genderbent as a guy isekai plot ü§î
<:pepehands:744752920960172032>
I bet there's not even an identity crisis
tbh if the person doesn't even think of themselves as a girl (reborn as a op squire is kinda pushing it) I can't really think of them as a girl
I can't even get through first chapter of tanya üò© really dislike the mc already
<:SurtrKekw:832348400468361227>
it's an AU where humans are put into alpha/beta/omega, omega can have babies, alpha is the one who do it to them, beta differs with each work
it's shounen ai tagged
alright, I don't need to explain üëº
lmao
A/B/O world
the whole channel talks about it! it's pretty great I'm watching more videos
he's great
ferdinand from bookworm
<@203444794737950720> btw here's a channel that talks the difference
This video is pretty good and damn I cried again
https://youtu.be/ILnTLxGlCjQ
But most often it's forgotten
Yeah i think there's one with 3 souls in a body
Oh this doesn't happen often lol

I like these chibi style so that's cute
or <#336297808221044736>
well you can just dm me
I didn't feel it's that horny personally I guess <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
this is a great example :V
I prefer it when the mc is the one weaker in the relationship <a:Chowyhehehe:860917008287006740>
they are saying there's more than smut ones <:Shrug:388950974817107968> I like those
can you give a few links? üëÄ I'm always happy to read more (omega female mc ones if possible?)
it is wholesome!
het I think is the easiest to find if you want published novels though
yuri omegaverse on ao3 isn't as huge as the yaoi counterpart, but it still got a lot of stuff
https://dynasty-scans.com/series/you_are_my_soulmate this one is sfw yuri, pretty good read :V
although I think there's one sfw yuri 2-shot with that
it's mostly smut stuff
this is the very short version
I can't even finish first chapter lol
ugh
I wish to like that one but the fanservice is like
is that the bahamut one
but I can say that if you like FUNA's style, they do follow it through their works so in general if the summary itnerest you, you should enjoy it
uhhhh, because I feel that they just make OP MC who just feel flat on the personality side and pretty much finish everything with overwhelming power? I tried the average abilities LN (that one feels so terrible I immediately close it again), and I also tried saving 80k gold coin in another world for retirement, also dropped it because it's boring
oh ikxi and I have the opposite feels on that author kek
the AK anime key visual

<:OhISee:365689514146004992>
Well I'm playing it tonight
Not sure, I never played it
If your means is 0$ then don"t spend beyond 0$
As I said, don't spend beyond your means
Then don't spend
As long as you don't spend beyond your means gacha is ok
<:Smugland:773355666903531530>
You have sinned
You already played genshin
The mobile game part itself apparently sucks tho with tons of powercreep
There's multiple school and apparently has tons of good storyline
Sounds cool
Ah
Someone compared it to holy grail war but all women <:A_ThinkTao:808987776073596929>
<:GlowNaruhodo:666111459771809803>
What do you guys think
Huh I heard granbelm's good?
also everyone's a girl and the 2 main lead seems gay
magic mixed with mecha and then they fight one another? hell yeah
done with first chapter, I think that's pretty interesting one
although it makes me think of bdaman ü§î
<a:aworryRobot:817262061271646208>
I'm liking the mecha's shown there
granbelm's OP seems pretty cool
it's so bless
yep ash
üôè
<:STONKS:703686480555409500>
I bet they'll end up together through the course of the story
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
by the way if anyone's liking bits of mysteries, enjoying a kinda eccentric protagonist who likes drugs and poisons, Apothecary Diaries is amazing, and the latest volume, 4 for the LN, is really good as well
is that even prologue and not arc 1
*i'm sorry but it's more of the animation and music*
I have to spread it
The animation and thr music is just
I know this is gacha but like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5Psp3pHqDY
I Favor the Villainess's LN Vol 4 <a:kyaadoctor:898379516609691648>
This and I Favor the Villainess are both great isekai yuri <a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
Then again the manga is <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Unless the anime bungles badly it shoullld be good
Executioner is good stuff
Just keep it in mind <:A_ThumbsupTao:793167286961438730>
Yea otherside separate each case by files, and then separate those again to smaller parts
~~otherside picnic is also short and divided by files if you do that-~~

Well ahem, anyway. Try to pick it up when you can
IcIc
<:blobpensivepray:766082696681488394>
Amazing
And vol 4 is like
They are wonderful tbh
You should read iiit
Elaina <:uoooooh:864704745662709782>
https://www.amazon.com/Love-Villainess-Light-Novel-Vol/dp/1638581118
22 feb 2022 for the paperback
Not sure on the physical let me check
The epub is out
Like holy shit the series really go up and beyond
Good stuff
I finished reading I Favor the Villainess volume 4
Aaaaahhh
admittedly that's very biased thought
~~the best chars in the anime is maya and claudine <:brikdcana:287452290686648320> ~~ /brikd
Ah
A)so iirc the stage play is ||literal killing?||
<:GayRat:614544911462826015>
Yeh
I hope for executioner to be one of the best anime <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
It's quite old by this time so I didn't think it would get one
It got anime
Yooo
https://twitter.com/nekogaeru/status/1485492580603559937
Yeh
It's now my favorite romance 10/10
It's so good but holy shit
I cried while reading that new chapter
Gods
The series is just
Yep
I can't
Like wtf
It's so heavy and good
<@!297542051057238017> have you read this one üëÄ
https://mangadex.org/title/6ecc62e4-25ad-4102-b0d8-580a8023d2fb/kimi-to-tsuzuru-utakata holy shit, just finished latest chapter and it's just like, becoming one of my most favorite romance ever I think. This is great. Not even finished but holy fuck this series is so good my heart is broken and destroyed by it
it's not bad to read
yea 3rd book of hero king
No good way to be shorter too
Oof
Like holy shit I never even talked about it unless it's truly about sizes. Heights are more likely than breast size üò©
Can we stop having this trope of jealous over chest size please? Like it's so overused by now and I don't even get it
||I did give a warning it broke my heart <:A_HuPensive:807551025942495274> ||
Not bad tho
I have no idea of more because I only watched first episode and got so distracted I haven't continue
Granbelm is girls fighting one another in a competition on a mecha
Maybe can try granbelm
Sometimes they have movies
Maybe can try 9anime.me
If only there's more good adaptation like 86 :v
(like, watching in general, not granbelm's fault)
I need to continue it, just so hard to find interest in watching üò™
https://twitter.com/moogy0/status/1480829084091527170 here's the thread talking about granbelm that makes me watch it
Yea it's ok just telling
I haven't watched nanoha pls <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
<:AngeSigh:787120893356802088>
well technically you can keep sorawo's narration even in anime right? since there should still be the big narrator and all unless there's no neutral narrator
one of the series that got the biggest loss between adaptation
since you went from manga to LN
I think you are even surprised at the way she narrates right?
_sorawo is cool_ üò≠
if there's going to be a season 2 (which I doubt), things will break down worse :V also I'm bad at articulating stuff so this person's wording might work better
so we are treated to sorawo's brand of crazy from vol 1
the adaptation completely ruins the order of events, as well as taking out a lot of the soul of sorawo's commentary from what I hear
still sad on otherside adapt ü§ß
like 86 is
hopefully the anime is good adap
the manga definitely lost a lot üò©
icic
üòî
OH ~~what about reading otherside picnic LN-~~
executioner and her way of life is still one of my fav <:wow:519174679483645953>
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
Recommending girls kingdom to look at unless you dislike rich girl/maid aesthetic
Very ubfortunate
it's also legitimate idk why they shuffle it too
if there's ever season 2, my basic thoughts will be:
- wow migiwa will finally be animated, people can see how cool he is
- wait how will the arcs work
the fact she finally did it ||even if she only did it for weapons|| is still like HOLY SHIT SORAWO
Wish it's more than 2 shot
That series is very good
idk it's hard
something
like what it means isntead of what is shown
uhh
it needs to fit what is being said
not changing order and such ü§î
while cypher was thinking 1:1 as in the events and stuff
I feel milh was talking about 1:1 complete _same_ of adaptation where it's literally follow _all of the words of the original_
I personally feel the events should be followed, and pick up the good stuff from the original 

~~reeee otherside üò≠ ~~
also I noticed the 1:1 fight above and I have a feeling millh and cypher was thinking very differently there <:kekw:744698885573705758>
<:CinnabarShrug:591699559294566426>
I read the one I read because it's yuri
I don't really try to find
I think the fanworks had fun with the setting though...? maybe
or that yeah
or something
people want to self insert as the guy
you know I actually remember reading a fanfic set in danmachi world and it seems to be interesting ~~idk how's the real series is tho~~
huh <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
I thought it was isekai?
Yes I don"t see a reason why it's not, although I guess my isekai definition is more like, reincarnated in another world, or moved to another world type... Eh, idk, it can be in it even as it's weird :v
Oh yeah there's great video about bookworm anime and LN differences
<:Smugland:906008324800143370>
I thought it's S3
Also stuff like bookworm / executioner, both are isekai but it's far from the 'tropes', but I won't change it that those are still isekai <:abbySip:635497270799892533>
Me picking up A Voidling Wants to Make Some Friends vs Narnia are so different feels even tho they are both, fantasy
Lanks, even fantasy as a genre is so wide the only usual samey part is the setting feels <:badkekw:744699080839659711> and even then it can differ majorly
I don't think a genre can be ruined
Ehh
someone else was saying that danmachi is isekai because they want it to not pollute fantasy though <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I do agree it's on subgenre of fantasy though <:SipCiv:648233164296421409>
??? it doesn't work like that
it's dumb to only put "yeah I hate it and so it's isekai"
and also, that isekai has its good stories as  well
all genres have bad series
it's not as if fantasy doesn't have bad series
with the fact danmachi doesn't have moving world I would agree it's fantasy
girls play eroge yes, but doesn't mean anything when most works seems to cater mostly to males so :V
<:kekw:744698885573705758>
or maybe it's different one with alike premise
that eroge one iirc is guy mc if it's the one I know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnTLxGlCjQ recommended watch for anime-only fans <:worrysip:646331395412852746> this channel is really good tbh
great stuff
one of my favorite mangaka is still the one that made Biscuithammer / spirit circle / sengoku youko
CA I think I just don't like how it handles the comedy and stuff, as I don't feel it really _fits_, but in the end it's just personal pref
I like it much better than that one so far ü§î so hopefully will stay nice
I think it's same author as cheerful amnesia
üò©
read it and be in pain with me because only 3 chapters tl'd
I'm not giving link since y'know, not supposed to be here I think :V
can search that on mdex
Dore ga Koi Ka ga Wakaranai
tfw I was about to share a comic that is yuri harem and 100% wish fulfillment but it's lookind decent, but I saw it has erotica tag so I guess nvm
ah yeah that one is cute
I need more yuri polyamory
<:uglysobbing:925279505537458256>
I LIKE DMMD BUT THERE'S NO YURI THAT FEELS LIKE IT
or maybe my interest lies in male-related plot that doesn't appear in female-aimed stuff üò©
https://twitter.com/gomanga/status/1491162619285508097?t=3W0HBSziy4v-HJBw74iy5Q&s=19 yuri giveaway
The insane psrt is just quantum
I decide to skip the insane part and focus on the right oart
It's 3-volume slow :v
They do ||kiss|| at the end
Oh
Ok so for the gayness it's uhh, how to explain tjis without sounding batshit insane
üß†
Quantum be like:
So probably
It has scifi stuff
It"s pretty gay. I'll give a look at fantl version later
Can hurt head tho
A classics imo
It's cute!
But it's lovely work
Hurt my head when I read it
If you like scifi + yuri this one's good
One of the best thinf I read
üò≠
This thing is coming out officially
Holy shit
https://twitter.com/gomanga/status/1491509642622558208?t=DD3bJZ7OUeJxHOt_BRQt8w&s=19
<:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
and also mobage
||eeeeeeeeeeeeh maybe but that is a little kinda eh way to end it still though. Like on the overall level while I like the main end (woo childhood friend win???)

IF that's the way things end I feel it's just too unclear since there's like, sudden 1000% acceleration <:Pepega:586019549669883915> ||
The ending spouler for that ||unfortunately it doesn't go 3p... Like why. You gave that polyamory teachers and what not and suddenly it moves. The 15th chapter just suddenly jump so much :(||
Uh
<:A_ThumbsupTao:793167286961438730>
Glad you enjoy it
But yep, good right?
It has 96 chapters rn in the app
Kek
üò©
the tsun is a bit too strong
no regrets
yea i dropped marriage contract one after a bit, but my friend told me it gets good after a while and I repicked it up
These 2 are good. Marriage contract is iffy at first 10 or 20 I forgot but after that it's just steadily being good imo
I have followed that one since it's on mdex on the first time, then mdex ded, then on dynasty scans, then it's bilibili <:kekw:744698885573705758>
Idk it's just installing off google play

And reading it is also free
It's free
Just use the bilibili app
I thought isekai would be higher
Just finished bookworm newest book yesterday
Meanwhile if reading I can go fast lol
Watched 0 episode so I'm still only on ep 2
I planned to watch granbelm during winter break
Anime is hard to watch
No
üò©
I should read it as well
or whatever people said was bad <:kekw:744698885573705758>
what about compared to that arifureta s1
Golshi is still alive
Just buy the horse merch
https://myanimelist.net/manga/113196/Heterogenia_Linguistic__Ishuzoku_Gengogaku_Nyuumon
Thwre's one about linguistics
If you don't mind reading manga
lank pls
it's good stuff
wtf
(there's a lot of great manhua but that series is good)
please bully me miss villainess is one of the best manhua
Hoping it'll be good
https://mobile.twitter.com/AIR_News01/status/1497150311776940032?cxt=HHwWgMCjzdeR-cYpAAAA
what will they do with sequel
wtf sequel
I'm just hoping the anime will be good so at least anime/LN will be a good combo for those who doesn't want to read or those who don't want to watch <a:waaa:872442529201680444>
I read the manga first and found it to be pretty boring ish then I read the LN and goes "wtf this is so good that manga is travesty"
compared to the source
_average_
well not super sucky but it's like
the manga sucks
and yes because I LOVE IT. Like it's one of my fav LN right now
the LN you mean?
executioner and her way of life miiiight be good especially since it's source is a pretty high profile thing (a GRAND winner of a writing compeition in Japan that doesn't get grand winner every year. It's pretty much one of the best prize in there) but we'll see I suppose. I'm hoping it'll be as good as 86 but who knows <a:waaa:872442529201680444>
||I actually feel like if it's not death, it will feel bullshit? üòî ||
||I think it's done well enough that ending will definitely be one of the good way it ends. well "good" but it's a good tragedy||
now it just needs to land right
it handles things incredibly wellll
it's still one of my fav romance I think
<:Pain:630521170248073258>
it's good stuff but
üò≠
<a:aworryHeadbob:499605571402465280>
it's not a bad show and overall pretty charming imo. And the music's nice so it's pretty bobby to listen to
just bands defeating souls or ghosts or something
i remember watching the first season and it's decent
the repressed gay
<:KappaNitori:430233776493166592>
also ch 2 introduces a very classic isekai protag
me too
https://mangadex.org/title/21b848be-1bfe-4f97-b92c-62d319d8a093/the-onee-sama-and-the-giant
oh yeah ash I saw another isekai (might be yuri?) and kinda edgy <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796> only 2 chaps so far tho
i'll reject reality
if machikado doesn't end with momo and the mc together I won't believe it
what is the original japanese <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
elaina should be good
hope executioner's adaptation will be good
https://twitter.com/MishimaKitan/status/1500357462956048387 a pretty short thread on her interview
well an update today <a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
Very cute
Give it a try
https://mangadex.org/title/73965527-b393-4f65-9bc3-2439ec44935a/that-time-i-was-blackmailed-by-the-class-s-green-tea-bitch <@!171395487247630336> have you read this one btw
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
that series got 2nd season?
woah
it's ok
they'll just pay thousands of dollars to upgrade offices that won't be used by the translators
they won't even pay higher numbers for freelance
anime subtitling people + translator's pricing going lower and lower
https://twitter.com/invalidname/status/1502327843208019971 whelp
They got good releases going and prettg sure they never cut out stuff
J-novel being good is what I can agree on tho
That's because bookworm translator is a little nuts iirc, they tl multiple stuff not just bookworm too
that's capitalism, baby! is strong on this one
whelp
isn't that more to transformers
ancient magus bride is good stuff
Also if any stuff you like is licensed under sol press
Crossick (from JP) seems genuinely together tho but not sure
The fact they look like cute girls (2d) <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
although I personally haven't watched vtuber, it's not too bad when I tried the WN (although the LN version seems to be much more readable)
although huh I'm surprised you didn't like vtubers
what about cute girls drinking tho
üòî
ASH DID YOU SEE WHAT I TAGGED YOU WITH <:AAAA:934314735237759057>
https://j-novel.club/series/vtuber-legend-how-i-went-viral-after-forgetting-to-turn-off-my-stream <@171395487247630336> idk but I feel you might be interested in this? <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
understandable
<a:pat:730998242883403838>
yea, but isn't that usually solvable by reading more and so your brain is able to understand it? <:rikohmmmmmmmmm:921660649745055794> or is that just me (my original language is Indo as well, so I know the feeling of english as 2nd language)
(10 is going to be out in may)
for english version
so far the LN's up to volume 9
ahh üòî although I would say that it's a muscle you can train! so at first it's 70 pages, then as you read more, you'll reach more pages... <:OhISee:365689514146004992> but if you don't want to and sticking to the anime it's aight too
yeah, and that's alright
you don't have to finish reading them in a day
I mean reading 50-70 pages seems good amount to me <:OhISee:365689514146004992>
||ah ü§î it has been a while since I last read them so don't remember how much things are in between.||
86 spoiler for the LN: ||maybe ending it after that part with the past researcher "ghost" thingy?||
true that
there's a lot of volumes to draw from for s2 <:KappaNitori:430233776493166592>
Princess Principal? <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
The 80k gold coin is from the same author as make me average ability iirc

It probs will end up as ded license

oh yeah I'm blind
>looking at people's pick of next season and see no executioner
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
tuesday let's go there then
woo
are these store all at the same mall
oh wait
angy
man I wish the news will PUT THE LINK TO WHERE THE STORES ARE
<:omori_pog:782989937150263296>
ü§ß
there's also some sort of eva and a backpack collab
wow tons of MERCH ~~for gacha~~
granted not exactly weeby and more like
systrend is the weebiest place I went so far lol
alright
<:speedyweary:936642033630728275>
<@!145705908716961792> <:Peek:888897116414566430> I'm currently at taipei and do you know where to go for weeb stuff <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796> I did go to the systrend one, and tomorrow planning to go to animate and toranoana
woo bought this LN <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/277648501020688395/957909218898378752/IMG_20220328_154840.jpg
No CN novel (only JP -> CN translated) unfortunately
<:potatobless:530552695900340245>
More stuff I found
Woo

so since I"m studying CN I figure it's good idea to try reading it
and official chinese translation
it got fan translation
https://www.novelupdates.com/series/stars-twinkle-in-tomorrow-world/
it's surprisingly not isekai, but post apoc
<:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
it's mili, they make things up all the time
Many great protag
||at least he died ish from a stab. No prolonged torture!||
I like it
that's pretty good
woo finally done first episode of executioner
<a:waaa:872442529201680444>
<a:BearPensive:585614908834578492>
I know that's why I specify girls
But when will we get the female mc and can still aim for the girls in persona <:brikdcana:287417418920361984>
honestly if you take out the whole dating part in persona it still works out :V
~~yes but is it easy to get in english... üò© ~~
I never played those if they exist since for a long while they didn't really get translated üò© (or fantranslated) and I only played stuff on DS back then... the only closest one is the ones where you have to handle stats while trying to woo the guys
otome games don't really have focus on sex from what I remember of playing them, it's usually more of picking one guy out of the rest of them
Idk if gay but the manga's good
https://twitter.com/tongariofficial/status/1511343901042688002
it's not a theory when it's true that a lot of LNs are WNs that now get an editor and artists for them (like, A LOT of things start from WN like roll over and die/bookworm/spider isekai/etc, etc)
```After School Re-Reincarnation!

``` the manga title
this one is merely a chapter title kek
omg this chapter's title <:KokoroLmao:641390803356483584>
9anime
if you don't mind yuri-ish feel, Executioner seems to be going pretty good

~~also Machikado Mazoku~~
they did? it seems more like they are selling subs to let you use stickers <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796> I mean they can still have subs and stickers at the same time lol
ü§ß
yes, but I wish discord store for just the graphics and stuff will exist
not commenting on anything else, but the way stickers and themes are done imo are better on line than discord :V
line does better with stickers and themes than discord for sure
üçû
||also yes princess lady is good||
üëÄ
massive commentaries, nice
If they aren't gay I'll eat veggies (i already eat veggies)
What feelings indeed
https://9anime.me/ if you want to see wh8ch mirrors are up
But some isekai is good and different <:blobpensive:570384231747026944>
<:A_HuTaoGun:807559900062023680>
Imagine not picking Ashuna from executioner
Good score, that series is good <a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
someone I follow said that it harkens alike to ||cult-ish feel|| and admittedly it does kinda feel like that ü§î but I guess I'll see how it goes
well it's just more of the outfit, the whole "stay here to study better, no communication with your parents" also is a little <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
<:rikohmmmmmmmmm:921660649745055794>
||the whole SINGING IS HEALING and then they just keep calling hospital on them like... <:rikohmmmmmmmmm:921660649745055794> very sus. Also their outfits and the master thingy lol. Idk, there's something weird underneath||
I'm just not feeling that okay with the basic premise lol <:C_HuSusge:922820985248432148>
I can agree on that
the songs are good
<:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
ok, I just finished watching both episodes after reading someone's commentary on it
Anyone watching healer girl? <:rikohmmmmmmmmm:921660649745055794>
ü•≤
there's some romance yuri LN that isn't even localized to english
yeah more of them will be good <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
right now I'm just going with "if it's het, will people still wonder if it's romance" and applies it
<:shrug:582298635622940685> agree to disagree
||on the gay parts, I still hold that if they aren't shown in romantic inclination with a guy, it's still yuri but we have disagreed on that point so||
||I still stand by that this series fit best as tragedy instead of happy ending|| <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
||I mean it's pretty obvious they are gay for one another||
I just read it and I'm in pain and crying
let me finish having my heart torn out in genshin first
<a:waaa:872442529201680444>
I haven't read it because I'm dreading it
ü•≤
that is very true
~~or maybe CN so I can buy it~~
i'm still half hoping it will get official EN translation :(
<a:waaa:872442529201680444>
is this unforgettable witch
also painful though
https://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-story-of-unforgettable-witch/
I have some free time before dying from thesis so yes
Smh
Also no one should be allowed to hurt euphie
Princess anisphia is great and I love her <a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
Manga iirc can be more confusing than enlightening too for this series
So unfortunate on that part
This series has manga adaptation but it's a little skippy on the worldbuilding part
Pretty great imo
https://starrynightnovels.com/dukes-daughter-and-the-seven-nobles/
You need to take a look at Deathbound Duke's Daughter where even if she got isekai'd, it still manage to throw her off a lot by virtue of being there earlier and etc. Got *awesome* worldbuilding too and the WN TL got pretty long (the LN is still only on 2nd mystery case while WN is on 4th iirc)
I'll just do both
understandable <a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
I can't wait to see more
VERY EXCITING
I peeked at the comic-walker of next chapter
||I'm pretty sure the LN doesn't talk anything about the sus woman?||
üëÄ
ALSO that last page
yeah
they are so lovely I swear to god
(chapter 17 btw)
magirevo newest chapters are all so good üò≠ <@171395487247630336> <@297542051057238017>
the manga got so much charm
I'll stick to buying the LNs
<a:bongo:486770424546459648>
but anyway princess anisphia / euphyllia are still one of the most heartwarming relationship I ever see
buying the novels work <:brikdcana:287452290686648320>
woo
fuck that guy anyway :V
kekw
Yes the novel's good. I have some opinions about 86 after reading through 7? 8? Books but that's unrelated to the writing which is good
Princess is great still <a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
Have fun tho on LN <a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
Still lots of events to go
Nope
But I do find it's good
But yea took me a bit before the story really lands on me <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
Not as thick as england from hetalia but still
They have t h i c c ones
Took me 2 tries iirc
I didn't like it at first then I continued reading and it's surprisingly enjoyable
It's hm
Damn this one got anime
https://twitter.com/SugoiLITE/status/1515250474399637504
true, euphy seems to be super liking her though even from the dragon attack time ü§î
this scene...
if magirevo doesn't end in yuri I'll scream <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796> like it's just... there's no way it's not yuri considering the way they are written in story üò© (like... even in the LN)
is there any way magirevo can end other than the two of the main leads being gay to one another <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
smh
üëå
the ED is banger
||wish we can see more part of the fight between princess and momo||
I finally finished ep 3, that is nice
menou's mask is so good <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
lmao, imagine dying from the sun exposure
yeah it's cool
<:noU:509117651751010324>
it's pretty cute
the manga's super wholesome other some weird plotlines but I guess pretty reasonable <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
this one imouto is pretty cute since it's the older brother got turned into the imouto of the imouto
<a:3_:967406815774146630>
it got great worldbuilding + great characters so on the overall it's on the up and up type
<:SmugNun:639685973923594240>
<:A_HeheTao:797584474681376768>
things are going cool and I can't wait for ash's reaction for whatever will happen
and yes ash you should give it a look :V
many people are gay for menou, 100%
<@171395487247630336> have you read "anemone is in heat" <:roobless:744772479389794346> it's so good...
granted, good series should still be good-decent even when they got spoiled!
better it be under spoilers than accidentally spoiling people üòî
well you can look at the manga
üò≠
take a look at otherside picnic ln iski <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
so I have high hopes
their last collab is really nice with R6S ü§î
yes
their recent event pv also is going through 3D stuff ü§î
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCq5BcP7peQ&list=PLs8TZNEg0UbjiBf18So83gZBtYr5Ype4N&index=6
the blacksteel manga is nice
I trust their manga will be nice though
that is very true <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
they are also making rhine lab manga so that'll be awesome ü•∞
well here's the trailer :V
who knows really
_hopefully_
also that AK is in house so hopefully that can be better
I love this one so much
<:AAAA:934314735237759057>
https://mangadex.org/title/1d2967dd-d157-4cbb-84ed-ea7cf7140d14/our-yuri-started-with-me-getting-rejected-in-a-dream OH FUCK YES THIS THING GOT SERIALIZATION
hopefully it'll be good

Not sure what that will do to your digestion tho

Comfy food
https://mangadex.org/title/ffd3aad0-7dcc-47ff-bb36-caa0b9409a2b/gohan-no-otomo
why not <:KappaNitori:430233776493166592>
at least make it 69% if you want to rate it that low <:brikdcana:287452290686648320>
smh the reviewers
wtf 68%
yeah <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
and the magic is also plenty unique imo
the worldbuilding is real good
<a:BongoCat:587653082993917962>
it's talked a lot here ü•≤
will cypher watch executioner <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
there's 2 executioners this season? <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
loving the latest chapter ||especially with how afraid princess anis is with the mom|| <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
The manga got such goooooooood emotes
Magirevo
Hell yeah
I'm assuming elaina's in the list
Which ones are you grabbing?
<:walletburn:562522695183630357>
rip ash's wallet
good books pushes people to learn <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
üò≠
love it
the OP and ED for the executioner is also realllyy awesome
<a:bonk2:888897117110816809>
/brikd
the anime believes in your smartness, rad!
half an ep is probably less than the amount you spend for reading it, probably <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
there's still some commentators going ||I wish the guy on the beginning come back to life and kill menou||, although they keep saying it's just a "joke" :V
ep 1 spoiler / first 50 pages or so one <:KokoroLmao:641390803356483584>
yes it's safe spoiler
some of my friends are on the opinion that ||the fakeout is kinda badly done and that it's probably better off if it's running on from menou's pov from the start if they wish to do that|| ü§î granted some of them are also running from others who see it without spoilers (?) I suppose...
I do wonder if the low scores are because of the ||fakeout at the first episode kek||
This is the one with contract sister isn't it
<:AAAA:934314735237759057>
I reread the twitter version a few times
It's real cute

It's only ps1!
LEGEND OF MANA ANIME???????
WHAT
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fghzYfngr1w
<:Pepega:586019549669883915>
wtf JP LN is already up to volume 8 or 9
that's incredibly fast
that got anime already???
||it'll all be pain and I just worry about evie and elsa :(||
üòî
as I said, iirc it doesn't have romance and *if* it has, it'll probably be het :V
i'm honestly the type who likes a strong dose of [main plot] with romance side plot kekw
(hachiman should be with saika, that androgynous guy, and yukino with yui <a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130> )
üòî
like oregairu not taking the yaoi + yuri path where I feel the relationship is FAR better
sometimes some series are unfortunately not taking the better path
I see the railgun name and pretty sure the series is not yuri and if it have romance it'll probs be het :V
<a:ablobsweats:548314784471449610>
Frieren and "evil" demons
I want to know about LNs and mangas ü§î
my main watches are focused on game stuff <:rikohmmmmmmmmm:921660649745055794> I want to watch some anituber but they seem to be focused on anime and that's just not as interesting to me... (' - '
oh wait no, this one because they talk about bookworm <a:ablobteefswithlegs:412511225662930944>
I don't think I watch any anitubers
we don't trust massive amount of anitubers
<:thinkCakes:322271146949083136>
imagine jumping straight to season 5
or it's just the sequel syndrome where people sticking to a series tend to have high regards of the sequels <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
I have read the manga, it was pretty funny <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
Ay nice bookworm
FUCK YEAH NEXT EPISODE
not sure how that can become ||villain||
idk man <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
(I almost thought we are talking about ruina again)
just 3 hours it's fine
||I thought orwell's for spying tho :V||
rady didn't see the usual trope üòî
damn
||and how intuitive she is||
I love how straightforward she is
princess is great
ayy lank watching the  next eps
theyare very cool
i like 86 mechas
Is that glasgow <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
Asshole tho
I can't deny that
||just turn her into capture target|| <:KappaNitori:430233776493166592>
as a villainess...
there's no other choice :(
please be happy
üò©
<@171395487247630336> look at that face
<:naruhodo:530610258822037504>
the original light novel also won the GA bunko awards, grand prize, that they only give there's worthy candidate (It's not given every year, and I think it had been a few years since the previous one)
it's honestly pretty good
<:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
no, we are talking about executioner and her way of life
||wdym, she has done lifetime of good deeds, she DESERVES those youth :^)||
||obviously the one we should be root for is orwell, gasp!||
very real, very true
||she's pure, just and strong priestess though!!||
<a:waaa:872442529201680444>

I hear the alicization one is pretty good but going through all of the other volumes to there... ü•¥
ü§î ic
does SAO even run with technology related stuff beyond the nervgear?
idk
or just op protagonist?
it probably should change it to wish fulfillment works or something :^)
isn't CBR is just like foxnews but for media stuff
just read on blibli, which is the official translation <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
than manhwa has one of the best expressions
I would say both of them are kinda not that good for one another in term of relationship, but at the same time, it's... the only thing they have I would say? the only solid thing the both of them own (yes, even if the mc is the stronger one physically, she's kinda not as strong mentally vs the other tbh, or at least from my vague memory)
but tbh it's like the slow but it still moves on ~~unlike adashima that doesn't üòî ~~
nah it's very obviously reciprocated ü§î it's just not fast
a lot of gore and body horror though
(roll over is actually crazy good btw, and it's yuri)
as the better part is focusing on the horror going on
roll over and die has some stats but most people will probably ignore its existence
fuck those stats ü•≤
Tmr morning have to poke AK's ex stages and then still have 4 hours of volunteer left
Soon
<:AAAA:934314735237759057> I still haven't read the book 4
that one I'm fearing more than a lot of things
ü•¥
I still need to read JK haru
and yeah, not liking good books is fine tbh, there's nothing wrong with dropping things
like it's good... but it's not one that I can really go on and on with <:NotLikeAlice:641390801804460043>
the books mostly left me in ulcers from worry and I had to recharge everytime
Imagine not autoing gacha while doing other productive things
very good
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
that's real strong ending
of executioner
damn I finished watching newest episode
older fandoms tend to have more completed works
it's rare, but some of them are superb üëÄ
that's why I was thinking of recommending completed ones :V
some does, but I drop them
yeah I read some insane long fanfics, but the ones I read tbh is fine? things happen and etc, but I didn't feel like it was a slog
i'm glad I didn't really find those <:blobteefs:356265467905572867>
ü§î I actually found published tend to be slower than fanfics, altho maybe that's if I was comparing to normal novel vs fanfics than LNs
(and otherside picnic one)
I can recommend some real good touhou stuff that's all completed
xd
but there's a lot of badly translated WN too which people read so it's whatever
some of them... worse
some of them are even better written than irl novels
some gucci stuff around
there's a lot of nice ones if you include ao3, and outside of fandom you read :^)
<:SmileButPoor:433986078270029824>
buy novel only and wait 1 year for next book
<:SmugNun:639685973923594240>
not counting the anglosphere of wlw
No there's more yuri untranslated still :^)
Rady in pain
reeee
but no the male lead somehow has sixth sense for a girl (who is crossdressing) and fell in love
this series COULD HAVE BEEN GAY
rady
I wish this series is gay :(
conan has romance, wdym <:KappaNitori:430233776493166592>
what about conan <:KappaNitori:430233776493166592>
<:HAhaa:621866800078127165>
you think this won't happen lmao
personally found it a bit boring ü•≤
I have since lost interest in healer girl after it seems it's just being cgdct üò©
gods. I love miss sunflower so much üò≠ this series is such a slowburn but the love the two mc held to one another is very obvious
I think that's 5th book
ah ok <:thinkCakes:322271146949083136>
like the events
how far are you again
üò©
This is the same problem I got that led me to drop the series entirely. I read through until 8 I think until I'm just tired about things.

(Also that it feels like we don't get as much lena's pov stuff really hurts me sighs)
not sure ü§î
well this is a father saying it to his daughter
ughhh reading this is skeevy af üò©
also they could have done it like princess princess, where some guys got asked to crossdress to help "encourage" the school boys <:KokoroLmao:641390803356483584> (everyone knows they are male)
now I feel like I need to reread for you in full blossom, although iirc that one has the guys kinda sus on her, and she got found out by some other people as well
üò©
unless they are indeed gay :V
???? where did the feelings come from
but before then?
I can get that
like IF after they found out about the gender they started liking
as I said, they suddenly got 6th sense
no one knows i'm crossdressing but somehow all the guys like me :V
I STILL DON"T WANT HER TO BE WITH MALE LEAD
she pretends to be a guy because you know it, medieval society, blablabla üò≠
this series is so bad for my heart
THERE"S SOMEONE ELSE WHO LIKES THE MALE LEAD AND AMAZING GIRL AND HE SHOULD JUST BE WITH HER
<:pensive_sob:701360892083699772>
THE QUEEN WORE SUITS MY MAN
ü§î
crossdress ending up het is more often than you think, my boy
crying
and so it's het
honestly I'm also realize I'm very tired of the "I crossdress but they somehow know I'm not without this ever being said over the course of the story"
And kinky
Looking up to magical girls? If that's not gay i'm not sure what is, just be noted it's pretty lewd
machikado mazoku is good
<a:nod:486219714633138178>
ahh that's really good <a:petting:971424062771449876>
<a:CatNodButBlue:890725570583859321>
and surprising character growth too
yeah, I finished reading it just now
https://mangadex.org/title/6cc77b74-4c4a-4a58-9ae1-682471d50840/fukakai-na-boku-no-subete-o alright I finished reading this, I cried it's really good ü•≤

I love the levitate + turtle pet
There's that one s-ranked adventurer but we focus on her father. I need to pick up the LN...
We reward maple
Fuck gamer mentality :^)
Ssh
<@171395487247630336> how does maple continues to be op

it's so bad it makes the source looks average
depends, executioner manga is the worst version between all 3
üò§
I have besties and I don't do that, checkmate, historians!

there's no non yuri explanation for this

let me see if I can find a gif...
they have their own belief system
it got churches but it's not christianity church
good enough
or do you not want it
do you want spoilers for after first half of the first episode
smhsmh
what about üò≠
Overall from what I hear, 7 is ok, recommendable if people likes the genre, 8 is good, 9 is definitely good, and 10 is superb
that's not just mal, that's just how it is now
<:KaminaTsubasaFish:744465375655100519>

momos eating peaches
many momos

I wonder why is pink haired girls tend to be named momo

honestly yeah

if you want to give a look
https://mangadex.org/title/2f4b6d9b-94a8-4ab2-9261-235ecc870f96/otohime-diver
who knows
this manga is wack
no she's a gold medalist apparently
wow lady why are you so angy
historians are wack
abs lady üôè
there's also awesome princess there
hope you enjoy it
üôè
anyway, so far everyone I recommended this series to enjoy it <:blobteefs:356265467905572867> the only one that dislike it is ayaya and they read the manga ~~which is very bad adaptation so~~ so we don't count that
rady's going to read it? :?
<:blobteefs:356265467905572867>
it's done too so there's no waiting
time to read the manga iski
have forgotten it thou
iirc in the manga they do end up dating?
this will be incredibly funny
yeah the main title has always been executioner and her way of life, the virgin road is in parentheses XD
wdym it's not besties /s
~~ln better make menou marry akari~~
so from the title, we are going on menou's virgin road, aka her wedding aisle
I never know that virgin road means wedding aisle
also wow
time to call executioner shokei shoujo
rady suffering from missing discussion
hm, she has always been the same book-lover in the book so I'm not sure how the anime affects things... ü§î
I guess I don't lose interest because I personally find it's fun for myne's goal to get bigger and bigger like it's a natural state of growth (?) I guess
really sad then ü•≤
might be losing budget
I hear the adaptation hasn't been going pretty good for it? ü§î but idk
but it probably will end when they hooked up type
was decent though iirc?
that one took a few volumes until something happen, and before then it has a lot of vitriol
murder the man <:Gungela:906009409069662229>
<:koiFlush:964453599981744179>
go on wedding aisle with your bestie
solo pls üò§
akari really likes menou
<:Pepega:586019549669883915>
or is it most of romance works
yuri just tend to be done after they get together
Depends on how much it adapts the source
<a:waaa:872442529201680444>
I don't have the resources to buy all the LNs I recommend
cut off time from something else that is also entertainment and put it into watching anime instead?
manon üëå
>reading CBR in the first place
The beginning is pretty hostile iirc
Many people are bonkers
As I said
<:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
I already see the disturbing part ||stuff like murders and stuff|| (happy sugar life spoilers), it's just... I don't enjoy those in this manga I guess
some people just like it ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
if I want to read that kind of thing, murcielago I personally find more fun (even if it's lewd as well)
I end up quitting way before it ends though
let's just say that a lot of the people there are fucked up in the head?
uhh
well just be warned that it's not as sweet as it looks or title
<:ExuStare:642065770527850512>
did you get any sort of warning
are you sure
that uh
it's great
she slowly learns too
that one is so cute <:uglysobbing:925279505537458256>
occasional stuff
tbh I still prefer the childhood friend the most, like the rest is good but they are... flings
https://mangadex.org/title/79ca6344-5468-4fa8-8eb7-859728b27156/dore-ga-koi-ka-ga-wakaranai
still annoyed with that ending
<:worryHangry:804374011571601418>
I can see love on the other hand
eh asumi I don't feel need harem ending
for 5 senses
there's that one by the cheerful amnesia author as well which is harem
it has always been
which is bleh in another way but I'll still read it because I'm hoping it'll still end with mc with renako
then it changed course
slowly
they moved
eh
:(
I like renako and mai the most
Still wish it doesn't
Yeah it unfortunately move towards gayharem instead
Still weird
Kind od thing
She's believing that lovers can't do what friends do
Asumi brothel also gets official licensing
Oh nah it's actually more of one is like, want bff and the other wants lover (unfortunately I wish it dwells on this instead of going to have a harem)
It's pretty cute
Finally I can read it without those sucky mtl
https://twitter.com/gomanga/status/1527024405678895104?t=DN7LlfcK5aPt1djstuyuRQ&s=19 this finally got official release
Mystery is hard to make!
Do wonder how many people can refuse wealth, good health and good looks as long as you "fix" a person's bug (essentially killing them mentally)
It's ok the guy's cringe
I found how a shameless harem mc thought
Altho now you point it out I wonder why it's really nice
Kekw
The one at the anime looks so nice to stroll through
https://twitter.com/yenpress/status/1527001089303789572
You can make anything
With enough money and will
XD
scp document going on up there
wow that's quite

<@99695384296701952> look, gundam mask (for 7 usd for 10 pieces to boot)
although from recent read, "She is the Protagonist" is one of the best transmigrated GL story I ever read <:hellakneel:774442148371234826>
although if I take off the must be gay... that live commentary one is definitely up there tbh
I Favor the Villainess (?)
<:uglysobbing:925279505537458256>
if it doesn't make money there won't be more!
the best way for it to happen is to ensure that yuri makes money so people will want to make yuri
https://mangadex.org/title/a944aace-6f03-4298-b864-aee895acab28/endo-and-kobayashi-s-live-commentary-on-the-villainess this one isn't exactly like the brief, but it got the comedy, and the characters are all great as well
https://mangadex.org/title/3ef126d1-5e41-4594-924b-cb6e5ca99bdb/isekai-tensei-ore-ga-otome-ge-de-kyuuseishu this one is also really good

https://mangadex.org/title/60e6eb5e-6798-4614-928f-064e65aabe16/jishou-akuyaku-reijou-na-konyakusha-no-kansatsu-kiroku
I'm trying to find a specific one and it's so hard!
ü•≤
ugh, I wish I can filter my own read list
comedy otome isekai? ü§î
hopefully you enjoy
aka never

at the very least make it THREE of them
I still can't agree with the end pair though
is also good
Beware the Villainess
please bully me, miss villainess is otome yeah
is great if you want to pick villainess one
Holy Grail of Eris
the only big minus is the sucky translation
I don't think there is ü§î
just be prepared haha
still good read
example üò©
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/890809086214569995/976051519625498644/IMG_20220517_172003.jpg
yeah
it's understandable ish but also
https://www.novelupdates.com/series/she-is-the-protagonist/
if you have no problem with kinda decent-ish TL but at the same time it's also kinda questionable, you can definitely give a look at it
üôè
on my kobo it ends up as 2700~ ish pages <:KokoroLmao:641390803356483584>
definitely VERY long though lmao
yeah it's honestly really good
BUT it has a lot of CN internet slang
reading it straight in CN is probably the best way to absorb it
and the premise is that:
```The villainess was held as a puppet with no free will in her last life, until a sudden event gave her free will, which she basically used to die, only to find herself reincarnated 3 years earlier with her free will and memories intact
at the same time the female lead gets brought to this world by the system, but because she was kidnapped against her will and was told she has to turn the villainess back into a puppet she refused to comply with the system and decided to instead team up with the villainess and fight the system
and of course they fall in love along the way```
it's a CN webnovel
ayyyy nice
She is the Protagonist got one of the sweetest, relationship growth I have ever seen
<:uglysobbing:925279505537458256>
tfw I want to recommend She is the Protagonist too, but the translation quality, as well as the fact it doesn't have official translations makes me unable to do it
https://www.books.com.tw/ this is real
it's ok
I should change my notes to i'm in love with the villainess then so people won't be confused kek
<a:happybread:690393396598013952>
otherside picnic definitely got some extras because one of my favorite authors wrote some nice fanfics for it
<@250295696714891285>
**Executioner and Her Way of Life** - pretty good worldbuilding even with the isekai, pretty nice overall, one of my fav LN for sure
**Otherside Picnic** - a mix of creepypasta + adventure + yuri, it's really my favorite (also if you read this, you can also read some nice fanfics as well)
**Girl's Kingdom** - kinda weird one, but it's a SoL yuri where the mc ends up as the servant of rich girl. It got a lot of mistress/maid aesthetic kind of pairs, so if you like that this is real nice
**Roll Over and Die** - pretty dark fantasy yuri, got a lot of very graphic descriptions of gore and stuff for warning
**I Favor the Villainess** - another isekai yuri, but this time the mc isekai'd as the heroine but she decides to woo the villainess
**The Magical Revolution of the Reincarnated Princess and the Genius Young Lady** - One of my favorite isekai yuri for sure, with a really great relationship going on between the two female lead. Very lovely
https://mangadex.org/title/c5d731f9-c1cf-4a69-a797-cd9c2a58316b/anemone-is-in-heat <@171395487247630336> have you read this cute one
and math only
she's 1st place in math
yeah
<:AAAA:934314735237759057>
wtf
but like
she's not wrong

tfw
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/277648501020688395/979284135656972288/unknown.png
it's ok this one is already finished :V
definitely can recommend
https://bato.to/series/85887
<:uglysobbing:925279505537458256>
THAT'S SO GOOD
AHHHHHH
these are the 2 main pair
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/890809086214569995/979333103757701120/unknown.png
she got such perfect look lol

it's actually super cute
the main pair are photographer + the actress
who got BF
that's her old flame
it's already GL lmao
<:Wheeze:932602402056577064>
have this great photo done by the director
SERIOUSLY <:AAAA:934314735237759057>
AIN'T A JOKE
KISSES ON THE LIPS
GIRL
BRUH
<:AAAA:934314735237759057> ?!?!
"my gf doesn't make a lot of money"
wow
NO THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE RIGHT
<:NotLikeAlice:641390801804460043>
<:AAAA:934314735237759057> ???
??? which best friends kiss on the lips
then when asked, said that they are just best friends
>drops bombshell she's dating a guy after a while (? the timeline isn't clear)
>kiss on the lips
bruh reading a manhwa I can't believe this girl
<:naruhodo:530610258822037504>
but do you not study
oh my god why is there so many smart people in this class
latest chapter I read put a good point and I can't wait to read more
oh ho
<:brikdcana:287452290686648320>
that's why you saved them!
imagine gazing at various corpses
it's kinda madness though
https://mangadex.org/title/fac1870c-2ca1-439c-bd97-020dbbd732f0/usotsuki-satsuki-shi-ga-mieru
yeah
ahhhh ü§î yeah that makes sense tbh but you know that majority of the time it's not going to happen that way
honestly it sucks that you are saving people and they give you shit about it
<:naruhodo:530610258822037504>
not even need to remember
wtf
<:LunaGalaxyBrain:662985567234949191>
win
just remember the whole book!
wow
<:rikohmmmmmmmmm:921660649745055794>
satsuki deserves all the hugs
like I wish the broom appears more ü•≤
the best character in elaina is her broom anyway
either way
which is ok
elaina is pretty good, but I can see why people don't like her
I believe everyone can learn to read, but it's fine to not want to <a:petting:971424062771449876>
<:Wheeze:932602402056577064>
and from vol 3 onwards, it's not adapted at all
there's a lot of stories the anime skipped
you should do it lin
the last story is the best
you shoullld
very enjoyable
I just finished latest volume a few days ago üôè
idk why you ask ash
<:kekw:744698885573705758>
well ash said they like elaina so
tfw her human form is incredibly cute
<:uglysobbing:925279505537458256>
smh
~~her wand into human is fun though~~
<:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
yes illindus did you not see when elaina has to make her broom into human
I find her as pretty unique and I wish hers and elaina's relationship is poked more :(
yea, just wish there's more
not hurting others for fun of it
I like quite a variety of protagonist, but the main thing is just
too bad the sequel didn't stay with the same characters üòî
just really cool
it's
like the whole thing you have to puzzle through the rules and stuff
I love the game systemmmms
mondaiji is real good
sleep well
üò©
or even your own freedom
definitely find the game format in mondaiji is just superior than NGNL though
I enjoyed NGNL but not enough to pick up the novels lol
my favorite is that girl with the animal whisperer power tho
it doesn't have official english, so just search mondaiji tachi
hey shiroyasha is great, I never disagree on that
for all the mystery solving I never could solve it myself so I just sit back and eat popcorns as the characters explain :^)
but I remember enjoying the anime a lot
the LN is better than the anime tbh
<:uglysobbing:925279505537458256>
I NEED MORE CHAPTERS
machikado mazoku is so good
<:SakuyaStronk:661255469570064405>
are you going to try out executioner and her way of life btw? üëÄ
it's more idol show than idol girl show I think
it just be like that
6 I think?
and yet if you ask me all the stories that happen in that book? I can only remember 2 out of...
like I enjoy elaina, AND I just finished the latest book a few days ago
I just barely remember stuff from things
not bad
nah
<:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796> I have forgotten everything for SBR unfortunately
hope you have fun :0
Himegami no Miko going GOOD üëÄ
and it's yuri
pretty much a wholesome 2 teachers dating one another
Our Teachers are Dating!
also reading this manga is so sweet
also personally think it's yuri :V
my favorite 4koma
really good though
it got plot but it's slow moving
oh shit this one has LN? I never know
yes
üôÇ
a lot of yuri <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
it's pretty good and fun to read through
it got massive amount of dirty jokes though
https://j-novel.club/series/vtuber-legend-how-i-went-viral-after-forgetting-to-turn-off-my-stream
it's actually pretty good
woohoo, a lot of tee-tee moment and a lot of dirty jokes
done reading the VTuber LN
<:mikupraiselove:781785731767992332>
You never know
This is fake btw since the episode is apparently not released in CN yet
yeah, just saying it's good
yeah it's isekai but it's more focused on seasoned adventurer thing
This onenis really awesome
Damn this thing got official translation
https://twitter.com/ComicBookYeti/status/1531651196792057858?t=3RQXOno1AfgTP5uJwJME3w&s=19
I wish deku went with more traps or stuff than extra powers :V
it's all just data right /s
damn

just need to get used to SOV? <:GWshizuPlsRember:395626879630966796>
kekw
studied german for 2 years then stopped
the rules are just as bad as german or something idk
Screaming about grammars
üôè
then things happen and now I'm studying chinese instead
I was
it's just b-movie schlock it's ok /s
how do you not see it as gay as those two tbh, the fact the soul touching happens, the sheer trust etc :V
it's such a deceptive adaptation!
|| <:baateefs:399415520987709440> I looked at some pictures and BOI things are looking awesome||
tagging to remind since I'm late in answering
(worldbuilding better on LN but the anime is doing massive awesome job)
one of the best isekai especially with its worldbuilding
really comes recommended üôè
Executioner and Her Way of Life
<:Wheeze:932602402056577064>
how did you feel ash
üòÑ
<:worryDevil:589499203856629790>
nice, nice
seems people up there are going real excited over what happened in the newest executioner üëÄ
Accidental pun, oooooor? <:ZoomEyes:340489686285942796>
B u t t
Yeah if it adapts to the end of first arc I think it'll be good
Yes üòÇ butt jiggle
Yeah as long as 11 and 12 are 10's quality everything's good (hoping s2 and s3 will happen)
So good
That momo eating nuts should be an emote or sth
Especially thr ||momo and ashuna talking part||
It works it's just too obvious I guess
Hope 11 and 12 will be as good
All is forgiven when you see ep10 though
So many reused animation
Lol that ep8
<:Butt:342613741642186772>
It's nuts isn't it
really hope more people picking it up
as good as I hope it's to be
that's good stuff
goddamn I just finished executioner ep 10
crazy indeed
tfw being told to do that to loli
everytime I see executioner it's always so good üôè
the mc is slowly learning her feelings
no homo ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/trying_out_marriage_with_my_female_friend_ch17 man this is one of my favorite series üò≠ it's so good
if the manga isn't finished, that's natural consequence lol
no downtime where characters interact allowed it's all plot ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
I remember their other, much fluffier work
their art is very distinctive
(not your kid)
then you wake up 15 years later with 3 kiddos
going to sleep thinking you want to confess
yeah it's very wacky
<@297542051057238017> have you read this one
goddamn it's wild
https://mangadex.org/title/4e029573-332f-4edd-b8e5-e42e19ca599c/ashita-kimi-ni-aetara alright I just finished reading this and
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
they need to resolve plot stuff
ü•≤
I know üò≠ it's pain
yeah executioner is 20th sept
üò≠
it's from seven seas website
shit 6 september
is this 9th june or 6th september

AYYY
oh? üëÄ
||hm not wrong, but I guess I'm just kinda a huge sucker for like, those For A Want of A Nail type of situation lol||
so either way it'll be fun
i like time travel though
we'll see I guess
if ||rei and claire won't be mc again? not sure if that's the right word, but something along those lines||
the former seems more fun in like, uhhh
<:uglysobbing:925279505537458256>
REEE
BOOK 5 WHERE
AH
o
I mean part 3 is pretty much ||continuation of part 2 isn't it? with the demons and stuff||
part 2 IS awesome
I WANT TO WOO THE EMPRESS
<:AAAA:934314735237759057>
still kinda wish the 2nd game really exist irl
:^)
hey hey, I Favor the Villainess got it
was thinking about trying the LN but thinking about the non existent ending makes me don't do that
I only touch the manga
pain
<:A_HuLipBite:842358244256382986>
I still feel the prince is the worst choice between the guys tbh ( o_o
will she ever get together with maria, I hope so üò©
I think there should be more though
the WN has 4 arcs already
<:A_HuSadge:814445957960826931>
one day
I'm still waiting for the 3rd book of LN to come out
that one is amazing!
ü•≤
Deathbound Duke's Daughter is one of the best otome isekai but it's not adapted to anime
maria is the best option in that one
I'm still SO angry over that

and yet the otome game version of that didn't have the girls as a route and also adding 2 extra guys
otome games are great too
true, true
#priorities
lmao

YESSS
I mean trapped in otome games are fine too. Unless it's those ones where you'll be killed
<:AAAA:934314735237759057>
it's ok I need more
https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/we_graduated_from_being_sisters_to_girlfriends
tfw my eyes focused on the shirt
<:Peek:888897116414566430>
I didn't watch the anime at all
The LNs always awesome for bookworm <:umu:361926169567690752>
man remembering these reminds me I really need to continue watching utena
I think the manga is scanlated
very recommended for the philosphy and scifi side too
scifi gay
pretty gay
https://sevenseasentertainment.com/series/qualia-the-purple-light-novel/
<a:HYPER:597532203639111681>
I'm waiting for the official localization to buy it
and yep. Qualia the Purple
||after all it has happened SO MANY TIMES. 20+ times?||
||my guess is she feels that if she's close, the deaths will happen again||
||how do you feel when you realize A-chan's true nature?||
qualia is still wilder but that one is... yeap
things were wild
yeap
üôè
Honestly still the whole reason I'm into asumi san (altho the parts where they do it is decent)
<:A_HuSadge:814445957960826931>
Shipping akane/kana even if it's impossible
damn that's really cool one to read through
finally done chasing up oshi no ko as well
<a:waaa:872442529201680444>
read and join me <:uglysobbing:925279505537458256>
bruh the new chapter for please bully me miss vilainess <:uglysobbing:925279505537458256>
it's pretty much what you like with all the kisses <a:AranDerpChowyhyperfast:857624635301822516>
https://mangadex.org/title/b0b29745-5ab9-4387-b694-f8a1d08d2db2/ironna-onnanoko-to-kisu-wo-shiteitara-yuri-kisu-ni-mezamete-shimaimashita <@171395487247630336> here, something you'll probably like
Akane is defo my fav though
üò≠
Book need to come soon
Fuuuuck
Especially on certain matter
Like knowing book 4 really recontextualizes a lot of shit
This series is pretty nuch reveal after another
I'm going insane
Book 5 at september
You'll want s3 too because book 5 and 6 I hear is insane
Kekw
2 cour s2 is just 2 seasons
Really good for akari
But tbh i think season 2 is at least needed because book 4 is
Just to finish the whole proper arc
Executioner need 3 seasons lol
Yesss ||i really love the dark stars lol||
just combine into a movie /s
<:REEE:384749373981982730>
BAD ADAPTATION
<:Pepega:586019549669883915>
no they'll give another season to smartphone
<:KogasaGun:430233871825502232>
<:die:976616898907217960>
or shield hero level
it's not MT level of success
yeah it's impossible
we need TWO more seasons man
<:uglysobbing:925279505537458256>
next episode is the last one
damn it's cool
finally done watching it
pandemonium is such a polite girl <:heh:904986004212039691>
<a:aworrySmashWall:903736148080345139>
I'm screaming
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
YEAH LIKE IT'S PRETTY MUCH YURI

like they KISS LIPS TO LIPS ON OP
<:A_HuTaoSip:803337762597502976>
||She kisses her in the OP
past akari flirts with her all the time
future her outright states that she is in love with her
momo is super jealous of her and the intimate relationship they have
they even do the yuri bath scene ||
unless you are ash üò†
are both yuri
anyway both
Machikado Mazoku
and
Executioner and Her Way of Life
https://tenor.com/view/machikado-mazoku-machikado-mazoku-shamiko-tail-slap-gif-25533672
demon girl next door is very cute
<@203444794737950720>
or at least that's my personal feels on it
no I don't think so
>executioner
>depressing
ü§î
I got more content in a book than in a manga
honestly I far prefer LN now
<:die:976616898907217960>
even with that base
one of the best romance manga
https://mangadex.org/title/af906856-ef0c-4c7a-aa61-27edebe9e834/sekai-de-ichiban-oppai-ga-suki
it's not the name
even though it's base is boob grope
but anyway: boob grope manga is a surprisingly super wholesome romance yuri manga
~~In asia I don't see hugs unless you are close family lmao~~
/brikd
tfw millhi's place is full of that boob grope manga I see
the constant ashuna trying to get momo to pay her a sliver of attention isn't love...? üòî
I personally find it weird that gay needs to be beholden to a far stringent level to be called romance ü•≤
<a:waaa:872442529201680444>
well my points are all able to be seen in anime
they have outright ||done soul touching, which is said to be MORE INTIMATE THAN ANYTHING BECAUSE YOU CAN'T LIE. The bath scene. The whole I LOVE YOU. THE WHOLE TIME LOOP||
even ignoring the OP
well millh
tfw I'm shorter
well my spine hurts... <:blobhmmm:430179754616946720>
thanks for the refresher tho illindus <:nierThumbsUp:964707838024876052>
yes
<:naruhodo:530610258822037504> I know, I just completely forget because memory loss
demon girl x magical girl is really cute though
demon girl tries her best to beat momo and ends up getting trained by momo instead and shenanigans happen

~~gods I forgot the beginning plot~~
I love worldbuilding parts
oooo yes yes let me listen
idk what soul is, idk if there's really a soul irl although I believe in reincarnation, but in executioner it's another part that makes 'you' I think
||yeah it's literally, the soul touching is supposed to be painful ish BECAUSE people wouldn't trust one another that deep. But then akari just moans from it...||
if something bad happens that means the trust isn't deep enough
the intimate relationship that forms between girls as ||they do soul touching||
executioner and machikado is pretty much gay <:derp:527990461722263574>
ü•≤
ü•≤
that's why I recommend picking the anime of Executioner and Machikado Mazoku
Must be hellish to draw transparent stuff
Can't belive they went with *working with plastic*
sentient umbrellas being seduced
wtf
https://mangadex.org/title/2eaf5694-96e6-465f-bde9-679ee763b588/umbrellas
the power of handholding
shamiko üôè
I really should try out machikado anime though
~~I didn't watch the anime and only the manga~~
woohoo
monsters
turns it into idk
just take off your spine
<a:petting:971424062771449876>
Can I recommend just banning CBR from reading list
Nice, nice üëÄ
Also: ||find a wife who will trip and make you marry her on knifepoint /s||
Good as always
Finished reading newest bookworm
this manhua really going all out on the enemies to lovers
lmao
HELL YESSSSSSSSSSSSS NEW BOOKWORM
hooo
*looks at all the great heroine-focused shows*
This seems cute though
https://twitter.com/VIZMedia/status/1537828182539350016
Not selling enough probs
fuck yeah brainy fighter whomst still got the sheer power
she's more in depth, but there's also no need to be super indepth for her kind of thing? Ashuna is still one of my fav because of her sheer smartness though
it's still gay af, it's just not as romance focused instead of adventure but if these girls are anything other than gay to each other I would drop it
crying and sobbing
<:A_HuSadge:814445957960826931>
<:brikdcana:287452290686648320>
time for ash to read the books??
Huh this exists
:3
It's enjoyable if you enjoy an exploration of different world
Only read the manga though
I really enjoyed it
Oh that series
<:badkekw:744699080839659711>
I like momo when she's with ashuna
I already tried it 2 years
eh
source: I have tried it
dark mode hurts my eyes way quicker
nah
~~light mode is better for the eyes~~
:V
the romance is really good
that manga is great
I still enjoy wish fulfillment stuff catered to me
Like it's not like it's bad or anything lol
I just don't enjoy the wish fulfillment for guys
Oh this one looks meh to me personally lol
Lol
No one really buys centaur's life because it's weird series
i'm sorry GF just makes me think of girlfriends
and that's why it become ether
probably too long for subbing purposes though
I bet ashuna did it to be like, ||here momo, I'M STRONGER THAN YOUR CRUSH SO LIKE ME OK||
Goodies
The nice parts of physical
üò§
They seem good together
The friend should be with the mc
Dragon!!!
Oh that's really fun
<:A_HuSadge:814445957960826931>
||I got that from the first 2 books, but I guess without her thoughts people will think she's just being manipulative bastard I guess <:REEE:384749373981982730> ||
I mean ||we also already see how she *really* is and she's already coming across as more calculating. Like, the clumsy ditz act is pretty much when she's not having all her memories and just her wanting to be close to menou||
i'm glad I'm a huge LN reader  <:Pepega:586019549669883915>
idk I just don't see how she's annoying
<:A_HuSadge:814445957960826931>
~~although some other friends dislike akari from the anime to not continue so that's wack~~
<:A_HuPray:791078347898880010>
another friend of mine also wanted to pick up the LN after finishing the anime
just try out vol 3 immediately and see how it goes
there's really nothing to do with it
but tbh as it's only up to vol 1 of LN in term of content
the manga's art is decent
<@297542051057238017> have you read the newest update aaaaa
Speeen the neck
I honestly don't know much about haremy isekai because I don't like them unless it's yuri harem lol
Also heard Arifureta (?) Got harem
Uhhh that one about genius classmates
Have you read smartphone
Just read all the other generic isekais, ez
Virgin road is executioner as well
~~like costco's profit is also from membership??~~
And probably membership really helps too
Also through that they convince people to get their other stuff
<a:waaa:872442529201680444>
USA the commerce center of the world
Unless outside of usa
Yea I refuse to buy books on amazon because it's harder to take off drm as well on theirs

<a:InaHammerTime:833498017029685289>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
lost too much in adaptation
yes, but at the very least I do enjoy the female mc <a:ablobteefswithlegs:412511225662930944>
üòÇ
i downloaded it in the past then just never got interested to start it
fair enough
i'm ez bait tbh
I would instantly read index if it's yuri <:KappaNitori:430233776493166592>
<:TakoBless:808121113921847356>
you are doing well
<:omori_pog:782989937150263296>
finish bookworm first rady
so far, no
I read until chapter 200+ on WN version
I guess that's how it goes with these stories
<a:waaa:872442529201680444>
tfw looking at the cover, is the mc still a spider <:ExuStare:642065770527850512>
Gay golf
akiba's trip is indeed, a trip
findoms
the truth behind the girls with maid uniform in akihabara??
üò§
he's even cooler tbh
very cathartic
he's killing corrupt people
if you want to give it a try
https://mangadex.org/title/01c60e88-6a8d-449b-a538-f4946070b108/akumetsu
he lives
he got killed
yeah
he doesn't die though!
amazing <:BeegRumia:652692438363668532>
is this that one about shinobi in all girl's village finding a guy (?)
I mean I personally don't feel kaguya sama is that high <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> but then again I have long since dropped that series
ü§î
ah the classic sequel rating boom
üôè
as long as it's good
https://mangadex.org/title/79ca6344-5468-4fa8-8eb7-859728b27156/dore-ga-koi-ka-ga-wakaranai
when the girl thinks of the harem she can get
üòÇ
Doesn't fit the hot scale nor the good scale
I remember reading through
Ehh
Yeah citrus isn't... The best v:
<a:waaa:872442529201680444>
Is it yuri
Even worse probably idk :v
Ah
Thought it's the one where she can go between isekai and our world and then she even brings mercenary
I dislike that kekw
80k gold coin for retirement fund thingy?
It's cool
There's one where rhe girl can summon a minivan of sorts
<:sadi:964985937933242410>
I still need to finish utena
some does <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:naruhodo:530610258822037504>
Hm
Aww
Nvm then
<a:waaa:872442529201680444>
Is vivy yuri <:ElsaPeek:970502484374196285>
Alright i'm convinced to give it a try in a bit then <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Sounds insane
<:naruhodo:530610258822037504>
How good's birdie wing?
absolute drama
fun if you enjoy seeing jockey and horse racing though
<:badkekw:744699080839659711>
although if we go manga, there's this one series that I feel most people never heard of, Sylphid and its sequel, Mars
koroshi ai is decent romance manga lol
rip can't be yuri because literally no women left on earth situation :V
lol I literally don't remember what saber marionette was about until I opened the wikipedia
smh
<:gasp:983024390084112454>
wtf I thought you are same age as me rady
just that they exist and I watch it because it's on the cable
admittedly I don't remember what's the plot of these series anymore
and Saber Marionette series
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Galaxy Angel feels like something no one watches
||there's so many times I can read OH HUMANITIES LOSE AGAIN AFTER ALL THAT HARD WORK|| üôÑ
i'm gonna also add that 86 goes boring after a few volumes so the fact it ends at the start as adaptatioon means it wins in that regard :V
100%
the start of infatuation
like the way these two look upon one another are like
<:blushy:965059239095713862>
gayyy
maybe he has a secret twin-
SAME VIBES
LIKE
<:15mins:721896936575074355>
<:badkekw:744699080839659711>
everytime I see this I keep thinking "wow hibiki's father is a golfer"
also: really feeling the sexual tension
<:KoishiWut:819122211520512010>
WOA what the heck happened at the end of that 3rd episode
ball name is cute

do it, it looks insane
<:badkekw:744699080839659711>
there's love confession already ash /s
HOW THE FUCK DID IT PASSED THROUGH BETWEEN CARRIAGES
<:KoishiWut:819122211520512010> what the fuck
tfw executioner <a:waaa:872442529201680444>
most of the time the original isn't done yet
so if you think the manhua's good it's same quality
it's the same ones for the manhua
well at the end it's still sweet story
because the system hates her
<a:waaa:872442529201680444>
but thou must
I hear 6
idk
||they finally are together||
yeah apparently vol6 of the LN
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I enjoy it more than adashima tho
bless this series
https://mangadex.org/title/e02f32f7-66d6-4eda-818e-a7e4e2c198a1/himawari-san
it's slow burn though
you should üëÄ
<@171395487247630336> have you read miss sunflower or not
Wake up
We have arrived at the border
<a:aworrySwingSadge:795201259510038558>
I prefer girl's kingdom far more but that one's not getting more volumes <:A_HuSadge:814445957960826931>
yeah I didn't enjoy it on the overall level :V
this anime goes places
<:KoishiWut:819122211520512010>
seriously what
WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED AT BIRDIE WINGS (EP 7)
golf going up in danger level I see
trutru
~~original can be bad <:brikd:969117353671524362> ~~
hopefully good
we'll see how it goes
:V
hopefully
there's even aquarium date!
well they do look like they'll be having dates
if it's gay...
ooo I'm looking at new anime next season and what's this? <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> will it be gay
tfw long spoilers
||the fact the leviathan is so cool and then the author be like, OHNO NO MORE LEVIATHAN AFTER THIS BOOK AND I JUST WANT TO SCREAM||
||on the plot stuff I just get bored of the constant human find something!! human lose against mecha!!! like literally win 1 step lose 2 steps ü§å ||
||admittedly, other than the plot problems, I also enjoy the girl's pov far more than shin, and I feel shin is getting more pov in the writing <:shrug:582298635622940685> but maybe that's just my vibe. I just... can't care too much about shin. He's pretty boring personally üòÇ he works at the first book though||
just feels like the story is way weaker with all the additional stuff
if people still enjoy it's up to them kek
it be how it is
that's why it's kinda super tight and reeal good
lol
and it was supposed to only be that one first book
admittedly might be because iirc the LN wasn't planned to have more volumes
after reading through 8 volumes
tbh I want to say that vol 1 is the best part
<:uglysobbing:925279505537458256>
smh millh
~~86 stops at the best point for the LN, don't @ me~~ <:brikd:969117353671524362>
bruh
<:alyuttilt:591613367102341121>
or is this different thing
sounds like those scammy apps where they said they'll have all these animes!! for free!!!
<:ExuStare:642065770527850512>
who the fuck is WIT STUDIO
<:galaxybrain:808446241531756615>
what if, skateboard maid
lol
I was more of referring you saying people don't watch X because it's wrong gay
I mean it's ok to not like it too? :?
lol
I'm pretty much in a group where it's just people watching gay guys stuff / reading BL stuff <:ElsaDelicious:991332490851651705> and it's literally things I don't hear anywhere else
probably just need different community for people who watch 'em
just used on golf
anyway birdie wings generally is a sports anime vibe
<:brikdcana:287417418920361984>
bromance is gay
the moment they show pandemonium stuff is definitely great, those parts feel really good in movement especially since the character themselves are aiming to evoke B-movie feels
yeah
executioner got some changes in term of how a character got introduced and it's better on that part <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> 

~~unfortunately it's missing parts that can't really be adapted, aka showing akari's inner thoughts~~ it's pretty good on menou side though, but in the end the weakness is kinda inner ponderation
but again, not all changes are good :V
well some stuff are better to have scenes changed
lmao
~~It probably happens because of the sheer amount of sucky adaptation :V~~
yes, but sometimes it feel like the changes are for the sake of changing? ü§î
on what possibly to be improved on and such
no I mean they don't even get like, being asked for comments and such no
sometimes the option to make it better is out of the author's hand no?
as long as the tweaking didn't make it worse <:Pepega:586019549669883915> otherside picnic...
1:1 is that mafia househusband "anime" :^)
Extreme hearts look interesting too

not for seeing shirou get his harem for the nth time
I look at prillya for illya
I can look at the 2 animes and 3 movies
if I want to see him
<:shrug:582298635622940685> Idk I just can't care less about shirou by now
honestly I'd rather them focusing on each other
eh
true, but having the 11 year old girls, all three of them lusting for the big brother is a tad
I just can't brain everyone wanting shirou
everything else is working fine
the biggest minus I'm giving it is, stop having everyone wanting shirou's affection
manga
picking up prillya is leaving me with some regrets <:TiredTalulah:688526708093354067>
<:OhISee:365689514146004992>
it's ok, the only one officially translated is either the animus or melty blood
man fate/extra is psp only tho isn't it
yes that's why <:blushy:965059239095713862>
I„ÄÄonly hear that hakuno is amazing
what about the one where you play as hakuno
bazett is really cool though
yea in manga you can kinda glaze over parts you don't really care for
oh phew I think I just finished the comedy scenes since now they are planning to get the last card
yea heard drei's really good
it's only the promise that he'll slowly pushed away I'm still pushing myself to üòÇ
yeah, they are just puking him out at zwei so much holy shit
but anyway my main complaint in prillya is stop shoving shirou as their love interest
sakura is the one I get the most
like sakura and rin in the VN routes I can see why
so it's like, it's all just _shirou_ and holy fuck it makes me want to strangle him
like them cooking stuff

it's all for shirou to like them
(or at least a focus on wanting to get him)
it's all shirou
outside of the fighting scenes
well a joke that goes on for all over the series (first series I can understand), but zwei is like
kinda turns them from "oh interesting character"

into just suddenly "oh they just want to bone him"
it's kinda like harem series but from the girl's pov
he's not receptive, but when you just constantly seeing the girls want him
pretty much the manga constantly shove that illya wants him, that kuro wants him, that miyu also kinda wants him? maybe more of as big brother so at least that a little different

then the rin / luvia pov where they also wants him
and this harem thing has gone on for too many chapters so I can't just forget it
it's ok there's nothing that interest me from my look of the 11 summaries
<:sadi:964985937933242410>
üò≠
tfw finished zwei and trying to hope there's something but no
Fuxk yeahhhh
It's amazing and cool!
I read the manga as well
No idea, I just want to see how it is in LN
Lmao
Pretty sure I'm still waiting for qualia the purple
But 7 seas feel same vibe?
I know yenpress is onenof the longest
Probably 2024 though since 7seas
So now I'll wait for official
I was considering reading the WN but I got distracted by stuff
Soundsgood
Pog
true dragon form üëÄ
but what if...
majority of the pssibilities are fun :V
there's a lot of creativity to be had, for sure
<:woosh:841931083032297482>
magic
rare human-dragon mix AAAA
very cute, very adorable
I'm feeling I'm too desperate xd
A far enough planet it looks like earth and has been taken over by BETA?

<:brikd:969117353671524362>
I enjoyed WEP and that one really goes
although I do need to finish birdie wings first
yeah, kind of waiting a bit before poking it up
I suppose tomorrow I have to finish this
that's so damn good so far
Just finished episode 10
damn
this goes even gayer??? <:ExuStare:642065770527850512>
birdie wings e10
bless this lady

:)
(You can see places where it's PILES of rubbish)
I'm sure it won't be as bad as indonesia and its thrhow trashes everywhere
if I go to europe it's definitely for a food tour
i'm glad I want to go to france for the food
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/890809086214569995/994201706789351494/unknown.png
yeah imagine wanting to go to france for kissing
it's cute though
https://mangadex.org/title/71937147-e3e7-4ba6-9cd9-912b8289223d/everyday-lily
she refused to kiss because she wants her first kiss near eiffel tower at night
when 2 yuri lovers found out of each other
<:argh:992693965939814520>
<:argh:992693965939814520>
where's next episode
wtf
ep 13 of birdie wing
YURI
this is it

Manga author do have hard time
Well rip
seems cute though
trying to read it
alright I gave up midway
she legit was saying
"it's ok! even if i'm human or tuna, my flesh is still red"
oh my god
time to hope it'll be translated to english
this looks cute
üëÄ
I want to read
gimme the link
true love
human x tuna
<:gasp:983024390084112454>
but well, illya answered like the shonen protagonist she is
imagine saving this world <:basil_hehe:911234429563850812>
<:Wheeze:932602402056577064>
||and I just immediately go eh||
legit seeing ||oh no we have to sacrifice this girl for saving the world||
tfw morality argument that I immediately throw under the bus
yess
miyu's best girl in the story
ü•≤
3rei one is good so far :V feels proper
prisma illya yeah
<:argh:992693965939814520> them
ü•∫ wow the first episode is pretty good
izetta and princess principal
<:Squint:831219730273927188>
the art style seems to be... very close or the same too, I think?
man izetta makes me keep thinking this is same universe as princess principal
oof
friend was recommending it with katana maidens and the girl in twilight because yuri
yeah
tfw her name keep making me think of the other fine
Have fun <:nierThumbsUp:964707838024876052>
Ay nice
Since I see you have started, how is the first episode
Lol
Time for the kiddos
Better to end it here than forcibly continuing it
Final volume (this arc)
https://twitter.com/gomanga/status/1545160805867393025?t=aAUzFT_TgXghKjGhdqre9g&s=19 <@171395487247630336> <@297542051057238017> end of this month <:argh:992693965939814520>
<@279341087494242304> I can't believe this is not yuri how üòî
<a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>
<:rikohmmmmmmmmm:921660649745055794>
I also just realize it's using girls for women and men for the men
if you know you know
<:Pepega:586019549669883915>
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/980444023498092624/995115833074388992/unknown.png
this suspiciously feels like those lolicon manga
<:badkekw:744699080839659711>
but the other way around
yeah
honestly if they want to go polygamy route I'd rather see the rare one girl with 2 guys who also like one another :V
<:Gungela:906009409069662229>
i'll put this wonderful image again <a:aworryNodders:786475509197701130>

idk just don't really have interest in guys <:shrug:582298635622940685>
yea I mean it's just kinda close to harem already anyway :V
tfw
also I have read kinda one like that ~~netsuzou trap I suppose is kinda like that?~~ and it's just kinda worse with the guy
maybe if I'm a guy I would find that better but I'd rather have 3 girls dating each other
that's literally this üò©
take out the guy
no
kinda have no interest in rereading through the dramas
sooo
then I forgot where I stop
they pretend yuri then they dated after a few volumes and a lot of fraught feelings and it was going good
üòî
IFTV anime when
this one took quite some time to be good so I'm kinda doubtful on the anime
I'm simple woman
If yuri i'll pick it up
I hear prima doll is decent?
I need next chapter <:QQ:990106090333151253>
superb
drei manga so far is like
I refuse to believe anyone who said miyu and illya aren't in love with each other
prisma illya 3rei
be gay do crime
anyway last one I made lol

yes but that's not enough in the dialogue box
yeah anime wording is fine
the difference is the ages
there's differences of man, woman, boys, girls :V
I should have retouched all the dialogues so they all look sharp but I'm lazy

just feels a bit off das all
like if it's using boys should love boys and girls should love girls it's ok I think? idk
:?
KILL GODS
meanwhile this one continues to be good
this one
yepyep
oh hey it's translated
<:JoonOhoho:610165643521818646>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
(which my friend has low opinion on at latter part of the wn but I'm still waiting for that)
I think the only decent one I can remember is kumo
or... the whole classroom work together ala that genius classroom?
they usually become revengefest thing or a lot of shit happening
üò¨
ah those
aw it's not yuri
Glad you like it
Yeee
The devotion...
*so gay*
I don't have much preference but they just feel
tfw the villainess and the soul feels gay
<:sadi:964985937933242410>
IG
yea that's my only minus but that's the whole reason the story happens so
<:thumb:386185026582347791>
<:STONKS:703686480555409500>
next month
yeah there's hope
yeah join me in suffering these so few chapters existing :V
ya what ash said
the recent one I remember is this, and then that one with... uh... evil prince guy? who isn't evil because the villainess now is good and interesting :V and then there's that one where the villainess is isekai'd and now just want to become an adventurer because of the original timeline just sucks
tiring
tiring sia
LMAO I have been seeing too many where the heroine is evil
but the characters are very refreshing
admittedly it kinda follows those lines
the standard where the villainess becomes protagonist and good and the heroine is evil üòî
have fun
ayy
And I'm still thinking it's kinda yuri
It is villainess
This chapter
https://mangadex.org/chapter/b49d2263-ce44-4098-a151-810cbf97b0d9
Xd
Just generally isekai thing
I mean outside of that series
The character tend to bring the morality and etc right? So does forcing the morality of ours to theirs is good or not
Like when a character is isekai'd from ours to another world
Nono iski, more of meaning that generally
Although now this makes me wonder if forcibly using our morality in another world is bad or not
Autowin is the most boring shit
But that's obv not what the author aims
It probably can be fun if it becomes more political and the mcs trying to drag the society to future tech and goes scifi (or maybe have magitech shit because magic interferes normal tech)
<a:dragoninsane:503393988812996617>
Insane girls
Making energy for everyone idk
Warp train
Hovercars/bikes
Yes but will they make teleporters and stuff
Or is it like just modern day
Will they try to make scifi level stuff then
This is literally nothing fun
Wtf
Tfw they have enough industry to create rubber
No overwhelm with higher numbers?
<:questioning:610376021182644270>
How do you defeat kidnappers with one
Is it at least sniper gun
Sthsth give them moralistic problem or etc
oh yeah that one
classroom of the elite?
isn't there one where the whole classroom is geniuses and they work together to make internet <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Lol
Maybe she's also a masochist
Time to sue post office
As long as she's not hurting others I suppose it's fine
Imagine not having yuri on the bookshelves smh
Although I suppose she's very excited for her fetish of scent
Yeah she's crazy millh
It's ok, what everyone else likes is trash <:Smugland:906008324800143370>

Have you read the one where rhe mc just makes magic comiket
This one was decent until it starts the romance <a:Pensivewayo:528038699292688394>
Just have the mc conveniently remembers how to make everything
Continuous invention wahoo
This doesn't change even in part 4 of the series
Ferdinand continues to be tired handling myne
I think one of the few protag that stops it (ish) is bookworm's although there's still a lot of times where she follow our morality
wait so it works like irl lab?

yeah I hate animemaru because some peeps keep using screenshot from there to show that the 2hu girls are actually straight <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Pretty sure I saw so many of that main girl with ichigo for gay fics

I still believe the two of them are bf/gf :V
tfw this author really loves math I think
<:lol:374082620528787459>
like even outside of executioner there's still other isekai
are you going to refuse the existence of I Favor the Villainess, and MagiRevo lol
the fact yuri isekai exist <:uoooooh:864704745662709782>
isekai at least feels more unique when they are truly utilized <:A_HuTaoSip:803337762597502976> (or at least I hear far more good isekai than battle high school)
Anime adaptation is pretty limited so it's really not a good way to see xd
there's also this as example
https://www.novelupdates.com/series/i-was-reincarnated-as-a-side-heroine-in-a-yuri-game-and-with-all-my-power-i-will-protect-my-favorite-character/
those 2 are very different thing? also isn't the usual manhwa adapt is more by western companies like netflix or crunchy
<:gasp:983024390084112454>
I think the physical will release later
FINALLY PREORDERABLE <:uglysobbing:925279505537458256>
Also last time rhey only talked and not show anything?? Idk i don't remember anymore and I just get my tech news elsewhere
Their news cover too much while not expanding on them i suppose
Yea I just find some of their stuff a bit too much
For sure
Their news channel really doesn't work to me
Yeah I really can't get to their other channels and also not even their main except the occasional piece lol
Linus is idk more for random vids. Polygon defo appears from recs from google but what I get generally is pretty good so never really get the hatred for it

I feel like I got more kotaku weird stuff than polygon at one point...
Since gematsu fills the niche completely for my gaming news need
I always use polygon for the general tech
<:shrug:582298635622940685>
Yes I still don't see it as a gaming journo
Gematsu is better or rpgsite if you want some more flavors
It's not aimed at that
Well you shouldn't use polygon for gaming news
Polygon is literally more of general tech news than gaming tbh
It makes parts of the site not trash so it's not super trashy because investigative journalism is rare af in this day and age
Like the occasional kotaku investigative posts, polygon also does it
Polygon got good news outlet too
Nah
It's not harem show but the mc has a harem is still true
The love interests can end up with one another
Unlesss
Just use harem because it's focused on the mc
Is it love triangle if more than 2 love interests vie for the mc's love
Tbh I do agree on 3rd as part of harem because the main thing is that all these girls want his dick? Or sth like that :v
The one where she starts with one then her friends all start to like her iirc is another (and I continue to hate it because I'd rather it focus on the friendship/lover dichotomy that is in the fucking title)
Kinda just the amount? Idk, maybe. Although I guess on 3s, polycule ending might happen while more than that doesn't really happen
More than 1 is a harem already
Dysfunctional relationship i see
I thought those 2 girls are into shinji or sth

Really old anime
Wow galaxy angel

that's how it is I suppose

<@87512939107450880> do you still remember some fate events? I'm trying to remember if medea ever managed to do the whole ||brainwashing thing to saber ü§î || like i feel like there's some where she did it but like I'm not 100% sure lol (tagging you since iirc you are fate fan hue)
Although there's difference of criticizing and bashing
I still feel my sunshine is better sequel than XV is
Also the part with the big hibiki is super disappointing ughhhh
AXZ's biggest disappointment is the massive unusage of screentime where you can cut it out and XV works just fine
Yukari Yakumo aka the best 2hu /brikd
Yuri wins

||but I blame scams on capitalism||
Wdym evil she doesn't do evil things ||besides scamming people||
Smh ash not trusting me
Elaina is just cute story of a cute witch trust
The anime where they just go "yeah here's teaser for next episode but the next episode is in 6 months"
Even for birdie wings lmao
If it's not split it's one season
I just view it, if it's split it's next season
Best girl done dirty
Miku forgotten in s3 and s4 <:sadi:964985937933242410>
Now next seasons...
S1 doesn't really have cast bloat i think
Has been years though so Idr anymore üò™
I personally found the exposition to be fine? :V or at least I don't remember disliking it
It's not correct but it explains well what people think
And separated by cours
Different arc
86 part 2 is longer to write than s2
Up to vol 8 spoiler: ||the story is just so not moving holy heck like everytime it's just "yeah you did that? The mech did something and now rip you" and it just happens again and again and it's Tiring.||
I don't like the plot by now
The writing is great
Tbh by vol 8 I got fatigue xd
Because vol 1 is pretty much complete book
:v
Well s1 is vol 1, and s2 is vol 2 and 3 I think that's ok to separate it
(personal thoughts: shin is better when his pov is only less than half of the books and not primary)
S2 I hear is very much glow up from the book 2 and 3, because those 2 are hyper mind numbing to read through <:Omegalilwoo:588629705062875136>
Also <@99695384296701952> saw the 86 discussion up there and I can recommend it even if you don't continue to season 2 because the series is originally planned as oneshot in the LN, and I would even argue thatit's the best part of the series after I read through till vol 8 or so :v

So yeah, just my opinion ofc but stopping at season 1 (which is book 1 adapt) is the best way to look to the series imo
<a:WhalePepe:842497282158886912>
~~time to read the various touhou doujin nio has made :V~~

It's far yuri-er in books
Ashuna is awesome and vibin

4th is the best
1st is weird mecha with some weird plot and forced het

Uoooh
so true evie, so true
The 2 plush that will secretly be on top of one another

This is what lycoreco is about right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZLJUvmLxm4
the wonderful scp document
but tbh I still disagree over that  they have to kiss for them to be yuri but oh well <:DoremyShrug:641390800059629599>
<:breadbrain:960551503892975647>
idk I have forgotten what I read through
both are confusing
yea I mean idk, it's like, good telling and such
yuri kuma manga and anime is so different they are just different works entirely <:kekw:744698885573705758>
nah I mean just in general kind of thing
xdd
not the best thing ever
after reading so many I put yaga kimi as good but like
ehh
adashima is even more boring than otherside imo but that's different matter <:Pepega:586019549669883915>
kinda hard to not consider it when the whole thing is that it CONTINUES
yeah but as it's an adaptation
they both ||kiss, and sorawo just continue to run away from the blonde's feeling||
if you read the books
no
anime onlies won't though
but it'll happen
otherside picnic is slowburn type
Korra is gay + iirc it's continued in the comic?
need to watch these two one day ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
Arcane i also hear is good
For harley quinn
ü§î
The animation I hear is really good
I hear Arcane and Harley Quinn got it <:ElsaPeek:970502484374196285>
literally one of the most underrated anime I think?
I know this one but only because I have a friend who likes it because of it's animation
<a:waaa:872442529201680444>
I can't wait to reach part 5
Wew
for side stories?
since didn't they plan to release comic and LN?
I was saying more stuff
uh
:V
the LN
well there's more lycoreco isn't it
<:PrayTao:929546792591319080>
<@203444794737950720> can support
Sad
>isekai talk
>No ascendance of a bookworm being said as good
Like she almost always ||disturb any of the date they had, kinda ruin some of the possible development adachi might have, and just being annoying without much pay off||

I wish the author would focus on the other pair since they feel like good foil
The alien imo is just erroneous piece that is not just useless, but outright negative to the story
Yeah that's when ||they hooked up after all|| but I'm already too tired of the way it's done so üòÇ
I finished book 4 and pretty much goes "ehhhh"
(well plus aliens)
But how slow it is + ||the whole sudden rival|| makes me drop the novels
My complain is the alien
Finally i'll watch another gundam other than gundam 00 s1
üëÄ
Gay robots?
Yeah it's always too late :(
>later
Yeah because they weren't developed at all <a:waaa:872442529201680444> i could see them being used for some of those alien's thoughts, as well as showing how the pair works and contrasting with how adachi and shimamura are being especially at the starting chapters
Without a need to introduce scifi elements
Which i think can be done by the other pair
Bless

as someone who reads the LN long time ago, I do hear that on the overall level, the anime's pretty good, and if you prefer politics between players it really pokes between that

Also feels like realistic game players situation, who is suddenly thrown to a deep end. Generally a good work with character exploration and nice plot (? I think? I have forgotten everything but I did enjoy what I read back then)
alright now onto bocchi e4

she's still being anxious gal
NOR does she just suddenly have super easy time even with her bandmates
especially since it's not smoothed over
I personally do like bocchi's social anxiety though
for K-On, I do hear that it's better because it's also focused more on the band than whatever K-On did? idk :V I didn't watch K-On so take whatever I say with a grain of salt because I only heard of what others said
I tried akebi manga and got bored 2 chapter in so I won't comment <:Pepega:586019549669883915>
Also the fact that the director/scriptwriter/whoever did the whole thing that poke the chapters -> episode, and that they manage to adapt it super well is like, I kneel
Is incredibly good
I just find bocchi super compelling, and the usage of real life photo to animation
But idk i don't feel birdie is better than bocchi
Except birdie wings
I don't touch those others so i won't opine on which is better
Well at least candidate
It's anime of the year tbh
Do it, bocchi feels so real for us social anxious ppls
Bocchi is good stuff
Bocchi going upp
<a:roflmao:482047050209296384>
even bloom into you didn't finish adapting
every message they sent to one another is through unique medium
it's very unique
eats plant seeds <:nom:505406448235184131> 

like crunching them on the teeth and able to read them that way (and only that way)

the other ways are like, cutting open a bull? I think? I kinda forgot but it was cutting open an animal and going to the heart and feeling there for the message
(the messages' forms are super cool)
<:stonks:834286109026287638>
Read more novels where the girl eats seed to read the message from the girl she loves
The manga goes on drama and confession and dates etc
Probably not going to reach it for anime
~~ash still doesn't count akari and menou as romantic relationship iirc <:brikd:969117353671524362> ~~
end of book 2 <:Dorime:832351239391936583>
<:OmegaKasen:641390805377875988>

vlc yeah
Only big nitro
The power of joining random servers
I have 100 servers already :v
Will need to steal that emote
Thank
<@171395487247630336> iirc you have the bocchislime emote right?can you send it
Can just have less social anxiety
Just walk in <:kekw:744698885573705758> some family type restaurant might refuse if they only have 4+ people seating, but otherwise they usually have a pair type of seatings
I don't like fighting games :P
Ôº©don't have much interest in fighting games technicality...
it got too into fighting games
I have read this a bit and got bored XD
Anyway later have to drive to work
https://www.novelupdates.com/series/i-was-reincarnated-as-a-side-heroine-in-a-yuri-game-and-with-all-my-power-i-will-protect-my-favorite-character/ this is also good
If you don't mind CN wn, this one is good too (just kinda uh... Questionable translation) https://www.novelupdates.com/series/she-is-the-protagonist/
Soon tm
Magirevo is next year for adaptation
ILTV is the central focus and apparently will get adaptation
Executioner is defo liked back, just not as onvious on first 2 volumes which is what the anime adapt
**Executioner and Her Way of Life** - pretty good worldbuilding even with the isekai, pretty nice overall, one of my fav LN for sure
**I'm in Love with the Villainess** - another isekai yuri, but this time the mc isekai'd as the heroine but she decides to woo the villainess
**The Magical Revolution of the Reincarnated Princess and the Genius Young Lady** - One of my favorite isekai yuri for sure, with a really great relationship going on between the two female lead. Very lovely

Well the 3 i have on hand
<:OmegaKasen:641390805377875988>
The anime stops before rhe yuri part
If you pick up the LNs or WNs yeah
IFTV
a lot of side content stuff can survive but I think the side content also need to be accessible (iirc yuyuyu's novels are just... well.. JP only), also instead of them needing one another, it's mostly each one's standing on its own I think?
The ln and manga is nice
Yes
man ancient magus bride is good af (chapter 92)

<a:waaa:872442529201680444>
rip bocchi fell by 2
Have to buy
Oh ln vol 3 us out?
Vol 5...
She really does good
Wew
It's ending soon?
Woa
Nope. I think I only remember setsuna's gundam goes red and that's it
Yes i'm weird with weird taste
Granted also mever finished
I somehow watched 00 s1 fine lol
Too much dudes /s
Was finding me losing interest kekw
Just idk
I was watching it for a while, and I expect it to be dark
Anime is just so hard to follow
Idk I'm just not able to tolerate it for certain stuff üíÄ
I just can't stand the dark rn lol
No, more like
Gundam was going too dark for me while bocchi was light but serious enough <:copium:1038747551962247278>
üíÄ
Bocchi because it's the only one I can follow
~~tfw I found bocchi's pretty funny but it's because I found most comedies don't work with me... the only comedy I enjoy previously was nozaki kun~~
I feel it's more of bocchi joking about herself that everyone else follows (altho the only minus is only her family but tbh most family i know will do the same thing-ish)
It's pretty serious imo
But in the end it's bocchi that truly decide to do it
You can see that the other characters generally push bocchi to do things
Ehh
No idea i just like how the series handle bocchi's anxiety in super well done way
Idk
Suh, technicality
Lol
Because i have forgotten nearly everything except the memory part
Lazy to rewatch it
That other magical girl anime, plastic memories (i actually cried but then i for some reason never continued)... What else i wonder
So many stuff i start and never finished...
üíÄ
By now I just drop shit if i can't be bothered
But probs i just have stronger desire to finish stuff lmao
I think i watched them all properly since I downloaded them
<:clowntao2:1028266378190405652>
Somehow i finished a whole season even though i think i fell asleep
Maybe i'll give diy a try
Ah yeah non non biyori
I got bored of it üòî
This one
https://tenor.com/view/nyanpasu-gif-21749467
Damn I forgot that old SoL CGDCT anime
Does diy also have stronk character moments? I know i got bored of stuff like uhhh,
üíÄ
didn't enjoy daily life of high school boy
yes
I would argue it's better stopping there rho for the LN...
86 was planned as a oneshot ye
? whodis
Tbh the more i talk, the more i realize despite the series trying to sell you lena and shin are equal protagonists, ||lena really got far more shafted. Shin got a lot more alone scene compared to Lena, and even got the whole 2 books for himself. There's also the fact of some latter books I won't say that is heavily Shin's and I feel that despite Lena's there she's starting more of to be just a love interest than herself blah üíÄ||
Instead what we see is ||shin and co on vacation üíÄ||
Yaaa I wanted to see her growth as she tries her best ||and got that red highlight||
I wish there's more Lena pov üòî
<:OmegaKasen:641390805377875988>
Add that plus not caring much for shin and you can see why it's grating
Understandable
Probably doesn't help I don't care much for Shin and the books always focuses on him üíÄ
I hear the book 2 and 3 adaptation is really good so be glad for that, i read through it and I honestly get pretty bored throughout lol
The prose and such are stillgood
Not because of writing quality, still good
I read through to around book 7 and I have pretty negative opinion at the end
No I mean just stop at first book xD
it's setting up enemies to lovers, but with your yuri standard, no it's not :V
Gay vibes only
damn that's dedication indeed
oh wow

I have seen worse stuff than bokita so I prefer that
<:badkekw:744699080839659711>
people make edits a lot of times, especially for shipping
yes? that sounds just in good fun?
<:Wheeze:932602402056577064>
that sounds _so normal_
for bokita
episode 11 honestly makes me really üëÅÔ∏è üëÅÔ∏è lol
pog
than kita and ryo <:kekw:744698885573705758>
but I do feel bocchi and kita has more vibes
it's not happening in canon because I don't think it'll go further than subtext
I mean the fact there's more bocchi and kita scenes than kita and ryo aren't... wrong? <:lol:374082620528787459> 

~~altho I do like ryo and nijika more than with kita so~~
RENEW OTHERSIDE PICNIC ANIME üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

other than that, hm... because of my newest obsession I'll probably want a Path to Nowhere adaptation with female chief (or both appear and I'll just want it fruity for both sides)

Kind of want an adaptation of Time War but that one is like, impossibru to be done with all the way the prose did things üòÇ 

not sure what else
NEW OTHERSIDE PICNIC COVER üëÄ
wonder if it'll have it with the anime popularity
does it even have official english release
üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
ah ok, a lot then
out of 5
3 more volumes at least iirc?
Literally the only thing I managed to follow every week, and I do like how it handles bocchi and everyone and the interesting mix of anime and other animation styles, and then the whole ost and such... Bocchi is aoty for me :v
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/86_(term) i thought it's to this
Rwby is also anime
It still is anime it we went by that definition yes
all cartoons are also anime because anime means animation :^)
Both manga and LN are still great reads tbh

LN is already vol 3, and manga is already halfway through vol 2

||And the gay part is vol 3 lol||
Yurisekai can have multiple too www
<:shrug:582298635622940685>
I'll wait until later
```A world where wars are fought with spies. With a mission success rate of 100%, the remarkable, yet rather difficult to deal with, spy Klaus is being tasked with an almost impossible mission by the agency, harboring an insane 90% chance of failure and death‚Ä¶which for some reason involves seven inexperienced girls?!```
It's also harem
Look at the summary
I know the LN has the dude as main pov
Until i'm 100% sure the dude is not going to appear i'm not touching it lol
Well idk if the author ever said anything but that's how I got intwrested in reading the series. Multiple.ppl saying that haha
I still find goblin slayer weird in how it wants to be against ||rape||, but the way the story is written has some weird sexual focus occasionally and feels very fanservicey (*I only read through a bit of first volume and this was why i dropped it)
It's rhe usual flavor
It's harem
Just accept that most anime yuri didn't really reach the yuri part if it's adaptation, or that it tends to be subtexty and pick up webnovels or manga or light novels :^)
Executioner and Her Way of Life didn't reach the gay part but they are kinda gay (for the anime)
No- that adaptation sucks
Honestly by now I just want more good webnovels for yuri lol
;v
Out of 33
Too tired to continue more for nowz but I give 5 volumes a read already
Maria sama definitely isn't that good from what I read lol
<:YvonneHeh:998998449729065080>
5 volumes
Because maria sama I don't find good so far I read through like
Lol
Soon you are done
Yaa
Finish Princess Principal

And then for books you can try Otherside Picnic
:D
feeling hype for the end of the month
(I don't want to touch the series but I remember a friend being miffed about the anime designs)
that one iirc has far better design in the LN
https://www.youtube.com/@organicjapanesewithcuredol49/featured also here
https://bunpro.jp/dashboard pretty decent for grammar
That's why
<:galaxybrain:1047551628577873980>
Stop baiting make girls kiss girls and boys kiss boys
Need it to be real yaoi yes
Also one and two sucks a lot with overused jokes until third finally redeems itself
Still disappointed how little illya exist in the movie of prillya *that was how I first touched the series
So true
Cecile asked for trashy ones I'm giving trashy stuff :^)
<:brikdcana:287417418920361984>

oh shit
https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/i-m-in-love-with-the-villainess-she-s-so-cheeky-for-a-commoner-light-novel-vol-1
It's from how the WN is done in JP sphere iirc, since they only show the title. So having title that makes ppl know what it's about i think is far more advantageous
Yep. Kind of why they took rhings off after too iirc
not yuri but gud
<a:EssexHyperNod:738588941942259742>
it's pretty cute series

HUNGER
he's defeated by
yeah he deserves better
to move on from velma show, this manga has been pretty fun so far :V
A more erotic cgdct where they pretty much kinda like one another?
Well i would say the mc and the "mom" (the one who drew mc's vtuber) are strong subtext, one of the girls the mc says to do it with pretty much tell her to just come ||she was from lesbian jav situation thing i think||

And rhen the next gen has some girls who want to hit on the mc...
What if another girl also profess her love to her
Well
<:ExeNaruhodo:838716844076564480>
Unless you don't count this as yuri

I wonder if it'll be like streaming xD
https://twitter.com/AIR_News01/status/1616014577891938305?t=KSRRJxBPhM1RtJt9BRun-A&s=19
Honestly is there ones that don't have production issues
I don't see why it matters of how the sound is made lol

the scene happening is definitely not going to endear much people to his existence though
~~oh yeah didn't he got a lot of fan service for him too, which in some ways is for watchers~~
It just kinda sounds very... Annoying ish? (Admittedly i can say i have not much interest in watching the anime) but that's the part that stuck to ne the most for the complaints
:g
It reeks of those het harem where the dude mc is the special person (male) within this group of women
Isn't the problem with Tusk is how he's special and stuff? Like pretty much the only dude that can use this thing that can only be piloted by women previously?
sensei exist as a character that got fawned over that the characters sometimes forget some other chars iirc

although I do hear they also do chess or something idk
<:YvonneHeh:998998449729065080>
well, just the same as those?
well some people love Sensei ~~as self insert~~ so I guess
also I don't think it doesn't have that much story? Pretty sure it has a lot, the problem is on the Sensei's existence :P
use ~~ on both sides
what do you think
they already have to do insane hours just to keep up with the current release
<:kekw:744698885573705758>
they aren't paid enough for that shit
it's the combination of crazy amount of shows, the overworked animators, the fact they aren't paid a lot... :V
it has always been hell
Soon tm
It's not out yet
<:rikohmmmmmmmmm:921660649745055794>
https://twitter.com/moogy0/status/1617799864750071808?t=-ERDS1RbwSI1LKwK30Enlg&s=19
the mc is afterall, fightsexual
shonen with some sprinkle of dramas
it's more of shonen i would say
It's a few degrees removed from subtext unfortunately
<:sadi:964985937933242410>
Quof and the team is insane
Holy shit
Hm nothing of interest beyond bookworm
And hasn't died
Another eden has collabed with persona since forever
or something
THE DRILLS TO DRILL THE HEAVEN
those drills are really huge
a man reincarnated as a girl
the other way around exist a lot though!

*oh
Ih
Nuh why
The LN and manga is enjoyable af
The source material is good!
But in the end if you don't have interest it's fine lol
I think even without the just like me bocchi is very well made- i get bored off SoL stuff too but this one interest me enough I can keep watchinf it everyweek
Do ittt
It's good series
Enjoyed it
